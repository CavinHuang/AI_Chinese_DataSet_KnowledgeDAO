["Q: Two Macs signed into Google with same IP address I don't know if this goes here or somewhere else, but it's about my Mac, so I'll post it here.\nI got an e-mail saying my Google account was signed into on a Mac. I looked at the location and IP of said Mac, and it matches the only Mac that I have. The strange thing is, it shows two separate devices for my Mac. The only difference between the devices is the browser: the one that it says I'm using is using Chrome 52.0, and the other one is using Chrome 35.0.\nIs this a bug, or is something wrong? Is there a way to remove this \"second\" Mac from my devices?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: If you recently updated Google Chrome using the built-in updater (available from chrome://help/), that could cause Google to recognize two different browsers.  If you haven't updated Chrome, or just want to go through the process:\nClick on the Google Account icon in the upper right-hand corner of your Gmail window and click on the My Account link.\nFrom there, choose Sign-In & Security, scroll down to Recently Used Devices and click on Review devices (aka the Devices & Activity page as described in Google's Security support article).\nClick on Secure Your Account and follow the various prompts; you'll be signed out of your Google account and required to re-enter your password or possibly authenticate via 2FA, if you already had that enabled.\nAfter you have logged back in, return to the Recently Used Devices to verify only one browser.\n", "Q: Unable to receive USSD sessions while iPhone 5s screen is locked While my iPhone's screen is locked, I am not able to receive any USSD session on it. There is no notification of it as well. If I keep my screen on I receive it fine.\nIs this a phone restriction or some network problem?\n\nA: USSD session messages no longer turn on the screen. This was intended to save battery.  \nI for once had a problem that the USSD message would arrive when the iPhone was in my pocket and the screen would be ON until I manually dismissed it, which would drain my battery.\n", "Q: Permanently disable Safari caches I'm disabling the cache from Safari developer menu, but each time I reboot my computer, the cache is re-enabled.\nI'm looking for a permanent solution for disabling the cache.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: *\n\n*Empty the cache from the Develop menu.\n\n*Quit Safari.\n\n*Lock ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Safari/Cache.db from Finder's Get Info inspector.\n\n\nThis prevents Safari writing to the cache.\n\nIf you're here looking for how to disable cache now the option mentioned in the question is removed in Safari 11, see How to disable all caches in safari 11?\n", "Q: How to let htop display all columns correctly when using the Homebrew Terminal profile?

There is a TV, however, and I was thinking of bringing my 3rd gen Apple TV to be able to watch some media on the screen. The plan is to create a local hotspot on the phone; let the Apple TV connect to it and then use Airplay to play already downloaded content from my phone.\nWill this work? I can't test it without the data plan without leaving the country.\nThis post discusses a similar issue, but they seem to have a working data connection.\n\nA: Yes this works! \nYou must switch on Bluetooth on both devices. \nAfterwards go to the Control Center and check if AirPlay is diplayed. When the AirPlay Button don't show up you might restart and try it again. When it's working you have to turn on 'Mirror'. That's it.\n\nA: It works. As long as you can turn on a local hotspot on the phone, you can let the Apple TV connect to it and use AirPlay to stream content from the phone to the TV. Furthermore my friend could connect his iPad to the hotspot and stream video from his device to the TV.\n", "Q: Moving Files and Photos iPhone5s to/from older non-apple devices I have an iPhone 5s, an old laptop running Windows XP a Tesco Hudl, and a Samsung Galaxy 3.  How can i easily move files and photos to and from the iPhone without using my limited data allowance?  \nThe only version of iTunes I found to download will not run on Windows XP. The iPhone Bluetooth will not talk to the Samsung Bluetooth or the Hudl. \nIs there a way of doing it using the Wi-Fi bearing in mind I rarely have access to a separate Wi-Fi network/router?\nThe phone signal is usually very poor. The USB stick that works in the Hudl, the Samsung and the laptop will not work in the iPhone even with an adaptor. I have taken to calling it the idiot phone. \n\nA: You can get photos from the phone using Windows Photo Gallery - assuming you can still find a version that will run on XP.\nTo the phone will require you to find an equally ageing  iTunes. \nYour problem really isn't the iPhone, it's still being on a version of Windows that hasn't been supported in years.\n", "Q: How do I fix Notification Centre? It is blank in \"Recents\" mode Within the last two weeks, the right tab in Notification Centre (\"Notifications)\" became completely blank, without warning, and with no apparent trigger. The sort order mode is \"Recents\".\nHow can this be fixed?\nI have tried to restart the Macbook in question, and Notification Centre itself using Activity Monitor.\n(Mac OS X Version 10.11.6 (15G31))\n\nA: A workaround: change the sort order to \"Recents by App\" in the Notifications section of System Preferences.\n", "Q: DHCP on Airport Extreme I have DHCP setup on an Airport Extreme to provide IPs for a network of iMacs and some iPads. \nThe Airport's WAN port is connected to a switch that is used for a VOIP phone system. Would the DHCP service on the Airport conflict with the DHCP service for the phone system or will the Airport only provide IPs for its clients on its LAN ports? \n\nA: In your setup, hooking up the WAN port to the LAN of your VOIP will not cause conflict and will work exactly as you described.\nWhat you have done is create a segmented network on your internal LAN.  The picture below is a good representation of what you have configured.\n\n", "Q: Reduce size of 'bottom corner' for seconday click Is there a way to reduce the size of the 'bottom' corner of the touchpad that responds as the secondary click?  It's way to big and I would like to make it the bottom corner, not bottom quadrant.\n\nA: As such there is no way to reduce the size of the 'bottom' corner. What you can do is enable \"Click or tap with two fingers\" if clicking at bottom corner doesn't work out well for you. This option is available in Trackpad menu of system preferences.\n", "Q: How can one open a specific tab in preferences via Terminal? So I know I can use open /System/Library/PreferencePanes/Keyboard.prefPane to open Keyboard preferences. But how can I open the 'Shortcuts' tab specifically?\n\nA: You can use AppleScript from Terminal using osascript:\nosascript -e \"tell application \\\"System Preferences\\\"\" -e \"set the current pane to pane id \\\"com.apple.preference.keyboard\\\"\" -e \"reveal anchor \\\"shortcutsTab\\\" of pane id \\\"com.apple.preference.keyboard\\\"\" -e \"activate\"  -e \"end tell\"\nReplace ‘shortcutsTab’ with one of ‘keyboardTab’, ‘InputSources’, ‘shortcutsTab’, ‘Text’, ‘Dictation’ or ‘keyboardTab_ModifierKeys’ to change the tab it opens.\nTo find the list of available tabs in other preference panes, use\nosascript -e \"tell application \\\"System Preferences\\\"\" -e \"set the current pane to pane id \\\"com.apple.preference.name\\\"\" -e \"get the name of every anchor of pane id \\\"com.apple.preference.name\\\"\" -e \"end tell\" where ‘name’ is the name of the preference pane.\n\nTo select a specific category of shortcut, you can use System Events to select a row from the left table.\nosascript -e \"tell application \\\"System Preferences\\\"\" \\\n          -e   \"set the current pane to pane id \\\"com.apple.preference.keyboard\\\"\" \\\n          -e   \"reveal anchor \\\"shortcutsTab\\\" of pane id \\\"com.apple.preference.keyboard\\\"\" \\\n          -e \"end tell\" \\\n          -e \"tell application \\\"System Events\\\"\" \\\n          -e   \"tell application process \\\"System Preferences\\\"\" \\\n          -e     \"repeat while not (window 1 exists)\" \\\n          -e     \"end repeat\" \\\n          -e     \"tell window 1\" \\\n          -e       \"repeat while not (row 1 of table 1 of scroll area 1 of splitter group 1 of tab group 1 exists)\" \\\n          -e       \"end repeat\" \\\n          -e       \"select row i of table 1 of scroll area 1 of splitter group 1 of tab group 1\" \\\n          -e     \"end tell\" \\\n          -e   \"end tell\" \\\n          -e \"end tell\" \\\n          -e \"tell application \\\"System Preferences\\\"\" \\\n          -e   \"activate\" \\\n          -e \"end tell\"\n‘i’ is the index (counting from 1) of the row in the left column of the preference pane tab. The new lines (using ‘\\’ on the previous line) and white space outside of speech marks are just for formatting and can be omitted.\nBe careful of the use of ‘repeat while not’ which waits for System Preferences to open to the necessary page, however this freezes the code until that point, and if System Preferences is preoccupied with something else such as logging in to iCloud which can't be interrupted, this will freeze until you manually quit.\n\nA: Further to the answer from @grgarside (I don't have sufficient reputation to post this as a comment, sorry) not all IDs match the pattern com.apple.preference.name (which tripped me up for a while).\nAs of macOS Sierra (10.12.2) there are 19 preference pane IDs that match that pattern, 8 that match the pattern com.apple.preferences.name (note the s) and two outliers (com.apple.prefs.backup and com.apple.Localization).\nTo get the ID of the current pane (that you already have open in System Preferences) use:\nosascript -e \"tell application \\\"System Preferences\\\"\" -e \"get the ID of the current pane\" -e \"end tell\"\n\nTo get every available ID use:\nosascript -e \"tell application \\\"System Preferences\\\"\" -e \"get the ID of every pane\" -e \"end tell\"\n\n", "Q: Can one install Automator .workflow services via Terminal without user consent?

No computer control of scanner.  Any help? thanks  \n\nA: I NEVER use the drivers from the supplied media. I ALWAYS download the latest from the manufacturers website by googling (in your case) \"Canon MG3600 Mac Driver.\"\nChoose the top result that has \"canon.com\" as the domain (eg not an ad or a site specializing in driver downloads as they often bundle adware with the drivers) and you will (almost always) go right to the page where you can download the latest and greatest driver for your make and model of printer, scanner or any other 3rd party device that requires a driver.\nIt is possible that you got a Windows only CD or merely a defective disc. Regardless of that download the driver from the manufacturers site to ensure you have the latest and greatest version.\n\nA: As suggested by Steve Chambers, downloading the newest drivers is important to ensure that you have the best possible version of the drivers. For example, the MG3600 drivers were updated to ensure compatibility with OS X El Capitan, which may or may not be the case of the drivers on the disc that has likely been sitting in the printer's box for several months (even assuming there are, in fact, Mac drivers on that disc).\nIt does not appear the MG3600 is sold in the US, so here's a link to drivers that contain many languages including English: http://support-hk.canon-asia.com/contents/HK/EN/0100670801.html\n", "Q: Can I use a Thunderbolt 2 device with my 2011-era MacBook Pro? I'm asking for a friend who has a 2011-era MacBook Pro. She needs extra USB ports, and it looks like what she needs is a Thunderbolt device. The 2011 MacBook Pro has Thunderbolt 1, of course.\nIf she buys a Thunderbolt 2 device, will it work with her 2011-era MacBook Pro? She's going to upgrade her laptop at some point, and it would be nice for her to have the Thunderbolt 2 device so that it works at a higher speed out of the box once her laptop is newer.\n\nA: Thunderbolt 2 is backward compatible with Thunderbolt 1. So it should work no problem unless the product manufacturer says otherwise. Thought you only gets half the speed since the port on the computer only have Thunderbolt 1.\n", "Q: Mac Pro (Early 2008) - Unable to print in color to HP 4730 MFP When I print from a Mac Pro (Early 2008) running El Capitan (10.11.6) to a HP 4730MFP, all my color prints come out black and white. However when I print from my Lenovo running Win 10, they print just fine in color. The print driver for the machine is PCL v5.1. Somehow I feel the driver is not translating properly on the Mac side. I called MAC and they said they no longer support drivers for that machine. When I reset the printing system and re-add, it won't even work if I select the apple driver from the software drop down list. It gives an error code 49.4C06. It only works when I select the PCL Generic driver which unfortunately does not have the option to print in color. \nIs there a workaround? Maybe a third party app that would work?\n\nA: This has been resolved. The generic postscript driver did the trick. PCL is device dependent which means that the drivers for this language utilize the printer hardware for creating some of the printed data, usually graphics data such as fill areas, underlines or fonts. PostScript on the other hand is a device-independent page description language developed by Adobe, which is used to print and display pictures and text. It is used heavily in Macintosh platforms and for graphic applications in several platforms. Hope that helps someone.\n", "Q: Need help deciphering TestDisk results to fix HDD Background - \nWhile trying to use asr in terminal to copy a failing HDD's contents to empty external HD #1, I facepalm set the target as BACKUP HD #2. \nWhen I hit enter, asr went through it's normal steps, and then hit PSTT 0 100 start restore and hung there for longer than I expected it to.

AFAIK it tries to detect special empty blocks (2) followed by the occurrence of the string HFSJ in the third block - which marks the beginning of a HFSJ volume. A similar sequence is used to detect the last blocks of a volume. Such 1536 Byte \"blocks\" are more frequent than TestDisk can handle.\nI prefer a different approach:\nExternal disks partitioned by Disk Utility to one (visible) HFS+ volume usually have a typical partition scheme:\ndepending on the the Device Block Size (either 512 B or 4096 B) and the total size of the disk they either contain a 200 MiB or 300 MiB EFI partition as first partition after the partition table, then the main volume and finally a 134.2 MiB partition or free space of the same size. The last blocks are occupied by the second (\"backup\") partition table.\nThe standard Apple GUID partition scheme of a 512 B disk looks like this:\n                0           1         PMBR\n                1           1         Pri GPT header\n                2          32         Pri GPT table\n               34           6         \n               40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n           409640  part2-size      2  GPT part - partition type\npart2-size+409640      262144      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n    total_size-40           7         \n    total_size-33          32         Sec GPT table\n     total_size-1           1         Sec GPT header\n\npart2-size usually is: total-size - 671824 in 512 B-blocks.

The size of the main partition is reduced or enlarged respectively.\n\nSince gpt only writes in the first and the second partition table (and doesn't overwrite volume content!) you may test now which partition sizes may fit.\nThe basic gpt commands are the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*show the partition table:\nsudo gpt -r show diskX \n\n\n*add a partition:\nsudo gpt add -i (i) -b (block-nr) -s (blocks) -t (GUID) diskX\n\nwith i: index number, b: start block, s: size, t: partition type\n\n*remove a partition:\nsudo gpt remove -i (i) diskX\n\n\n*destroy partition table:\nsudo gpt destroy diskX\n\n\n*create a new partition table:\nsudo gpt create -f diskX\n\n\nRepairing your disk:\n\n\n*\n\n*detach any external disk, thumb drive etc except the corrupted one.\n\n*Open Terminal.app and enter diskutil list to get an overview. In the output you will get the disk identifier of the external disk (e.g. disk2; below I assume it's disk2, your disk identifier may differ!)\n\n*get the device block size:\ndiskutil info disk2 | grep \"Device Block Size\"\n\n\n*get the partition table of the disk:\nsudo gpt -r show disk2\n\n\n*Unmount the disk:\ndiskutil umountDisk disk2\n\n\n*if you find partitions remove them all with e.g. sudo gpt remove -i 2 disk2, sudo gpt remove -i 3 disk2 and  sudo gpt remove -i 1 disk2. If no partition table is found create a new one.\n\n*examining your disk's properties (probably a 4096 B disk) I would try the following now:\nsudo gpt add -i 1 -b 6 -s 51200 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B disk2\nsudo gpt add -i 2 -b 51206 -s 732482666 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk2\n\nthen verify a potential volume with\ndiskutil verifyVolume disk2s2\n\nor if this fails remove the partitions again with sudo gpt remove -i 2 disk2 and sudo gpt remove -i 1 disk2 and choose a different EFI partition size:\nsudo gpt add -i 1 -b 6 -s 76800 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B disk2\nsudo gpt add -i 2 -b 76806 -s 732457066 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk2\n\nthen verify a potential volume with\ndiskutil verifyVolume disk2s2\n\n\nA different method to find relevant partition boundaries are outlined in this answer: how to fix GUID hard drive corrupted to MBR and several other answers.\nIn principle, it's similar to the TestDisk method but with some (human) interpretation of detectable/detected characteristic volume structures. Therefore it's not automated and slower.\n\nIf your asr task has overwritten important parts of the previous main volume, it can't be salvaged.\n", "Q: Why is launchd saying \"service already loaded\" but \"launchctl list\" doesn't show the service?

I'm new to mac, so far when restarting everything worked reliably as it did before and was more or less in the same state.\nCan I as a dev lean on not loosing any state information when restarting? Can every application be restored completely and when does data loss occur ? Are there any known bugs ?\nBefore getting too comfortable with the feature I want to know how much I can rely on it to restore everything to the previous state, otherwise I will be more cautios with restarts, so I think this info is helpful for any dev using mac osx as a platfom to develop.\n\nA: In practice you can't rely on it.\nThe hooks are there in the OS to allow perfect restoration but each app has to be written to keep track of its changes and most aren't. Often that is the correct design decision as it allow the app to start in a controlled state rather than work out all the possible changes.\nIf you want the same state don't log out just put the machine to sleep.\n\nA: No. It will lose or potentially corrupt some state. It seems to depend a lot on which applications are open. Sublime Text is great about managing its state, but XCode is not just to offer 2 examples.

How do I get OS X installed? i have no backup or installation  discs.\n\nA: The 2009 iMac does not support Internet Recovery, so you'll not be able to download and install Mac OS X directly from the iMac without any external installation medium.\nYou'll to acquire the installation DVD, insert it into the drive and power on the Mac while holding down the C key on the keyboard.\nIf you have another Mac, you could possibly download the installation DMG from the App Store and burn it to a DVD or transfer to a USB drive for the iMac.\nAnother option would be to request the installation discs in an Apple Store - if they still have a supported OS for sale.\nA third option is to use eBay or similar to purchase a used installation disc.\n", "Q: How do you remove the Automator gear icon in the menu bar? I have Automator workflow applications that I run from keyboard shortcuts. It is great, however, a small gear icon always appears.\nI would like to remove it. \n\n\n*\n\n*How do you do this?\n\n*I usually remove all the pixels from the image of menu bar icons of applications, so they are invisible in the menu bar. I could easily do this with Automator (or the Automator application launcher), but can't find where the menu bar icons are stored. Where would they be stored?\n\n\nA: If you are using a shell script, you can add \"killall ScriptMonitor\" at the top of it.\n\nA: You can install Bartender to manage and hide the menu bar items. You can either choose to hide it completely, or stuff it under a separate standalone menu bar.\nThe spinning gear originated from a core system app called \"ScriptMonitor\" which you can find in the following file path:\n/System/Library/CoreServices/ScriptMonitor.app\nIf you own Bartender, you can manually add the add by clicking on the plus icon found in bottom right part of the preferences. The gear icon will appear briefly, but it should remain hidden while the processes are running.\n\n\nA: If you are starting a long-running process with \"Run Shell Script\", redirecting its output should be enough. For example:\nlong-running-process &>/dev/null &\n\nThe gear icon appears then goes away shortly after, I think it is better than nothing...\n\nA: I've had success with cYrus's answer, and success on Catalina with the open source Bartender alternative Dozer\n", "Q: Find my iPhone app won't install on iPhone 6s The \"Find my iPhone\" app won't install on my iPhone 6s.

Just out of curiosity, I went to the App Store, and did a search for the app. Interestingly, the little \"cloud\" icon would seem to indicate that, although I have downloaded it in the past, it is NOT installed. This is not actually the case - it IS installed. \n\nTry going to your main page and swiping down - this will enable the search feature.

I have some older iPhone and iPad (iPhone 5S and iPad Mini) with iOS 8. When I charged it and powered it up again, and search for app in the App Store, it will ask me to verify the account in my other apple device.\nSure, my iPhone 6 Plus and Macbook both popped up the \"Allow or not\" and verification code popups, but in the older device, there is no way to type the code in.\nIf I don't create yet another iTunes account (and want to use the existing iTunes account), and not to be forced into upgrading to the newest iOS, how can I possibly make it work?\n\nA: This stumped me for several attempts, until I carefully re-read the pop-up window with the verification code (I didn't take a screenshot, I'm going from memory):\nenter the verification code after the password INTO THE PASSWORD field (my CAPS)\nSo, there is no separate box or window for the verification code.

That said, this question is not a duplicate, as I need an answer not listed there. One of the solutions was holdign down command-option-P-R as the computer turned on. This does not work for me, even though it should. Apple support has said I would need to come in to a store, but as it's a long drive, I would prefer to find an answer that does not require me to drive there. If nobody can answer this, please tell me what they would do at the Apple store, if you know. \n\nA: What they would do in the store is work with you to make sure you don't really have access to the Apple ID. They would also seek to identify you as the original purchaser - if you can provide proof of identity and proof of purchase, they might have a procedure to erase the lock.\nI would work with AppleCare on the phone or internet to see if they can help with the Apple ID. Then you can decide to drive in person to Apple or perhaps see if there is a closer Apple Technician that could assist you with an unlock. The benefit of Apple is they don't charge money for this service - and you might pay someone else to assist.\n", "Q: iMessage shows ICE instead of contact I am trying to have an iMessage conversation with my family, but instead of showing their name it shows \"ICE\" because that same number is listed in my In Case of Emergency (ICE) contact. Is there anyway to change it so it shows their name not \"ICE\"\n\nA: iPhones have a neat feature that allows you to put your emergency contact information on the lock screen so no one has to unlock your phone to access it. You can set it up through the Health App on your iPhone.\nSince your Contacts won't be accessible on your iPhone without your passcode, this is a reasonable alternative. \nIf you set this up, you could theoretically delete the entry in your Contacts that is listed as ICE, thereby fixing your problem with the contact name showing up as ICE. \n", "Q: My Iphone 6 is damaged because of pressure My Iphone 6 was laying on the bed and i wasnt aware of where it was, so i laid down on my bed and my knee was putting a lot of pressure on the screen and the screen cracked and now my iphone is black and has lots if different colors on screen .

Practically, while fans start spinning when I turn the Ministack on, they do not resume spinning when drives return from standby/idle and stay off. This caused already a couple of dead hdds in our setting and other drives experienced temperatures around 70C.\nStrangely the enclosures are quite clean inside, this could mean that the fan behavior has been consistently this way since we bought them. The enclosures have been bought through official channels between 2014 and 2015.\nI am starting to believe this might be a production related or architectural related problem this model has. The day after I contacted Newertech the enclosures where unavailable for purchase. Usually I had good experiences with the company, but data storage is very important so I am trying to get to the cause of this issue. \nI tested different settings by turning the enclosure on, accessing the drive, letting the drive idle (usually 10 min) and go into standby, reaccessing the drive and inspecting fan behavior. I switched HDD vendors, cable, interfaces, computers, OS-X versions, this leaves the enclosure.\nCould someone please give me a feedback? I would like to figure out if my enclosures just all went bad with the same problem or if we all have a very huge problem! My drives heated up to 70C and should be around 40C, with 60C the maximum advised temperature from the drive vendor.\n\nA: Not long ago I experienced a similar situation with a new enclosure and drives. It was very frustrating as it is really difficult to troubleshoot an intermittent fault.\nIn my case, I reworked/replaced some of the cabling and this solved the problem.\n\nA: I have a macPro 2009 flashed for 2010 so Sierra (and now High Sierra) can operate. I have a USB 3.0 PCI-X 4 port card installed which has been working well since at least Yosemite.I have one port connected to an m-beat 7 port (USB 2.0 2ports, the rest USB 3.0) powered hub. For me, disconnects started in Sierra. Every so often the dive(s) attached to my hub would disconnect and reconnect, whether they be USB drives or Hard drives. I tried everything written, including installing 3rd party kexts, disconnecting the power to the hub etc. I even bought a new m-beat “just in case”. I then did some research and in the end purchased a TP-Link UH720 powered 7 port hub (with 2 extra charging ports). This unit is powered by a 12Volt power source, which means it is stepped down to 5v somewhere before going to the out ports. This, I think is the cruncher. Hubs with a 12v supply tend to be more stable. Since installing the TP-Link, it has been rock steady over 48 hours with no drop puts whatsoever.\nReply\n", "Q: How to clean my Mac from malware like ps4ux only been using it for 2 months.

My problem is sometimes I run a command in Terminal that launches other applications.  Whenever a new application is launched in OS X, it seems to think that it should automatically change to the \"Main Desktop\" and set the newly launched application as the active application.  This bothers me because I would like to just run an application in the background without the OS deciding what I should be staring at.\nIs there a way to disable or work-around that behaviour?\nNote: this, I believe, unfortunately is the same behaviour when you have any application in full screen as your main focus application and you launch another application from the Dock.  It takes your focus directly to that new application.\n\nA: There is no way to change this behavior. The reason is because your full screen application is contained in a separate virtual desktop, leaving the \"default desktop\" available for any other apps to run (like the case of efficiency on multiple screens). OS X & macOS work like that. Every aspect of the OS was designed in a way to be \"clutter free\", so a window on top of a window is a big no no for apple, and will be avoided if possible.\n", "Q: modprobe: FATAL: Module wl not found.on Macbook Air running Kali Linux 4.3 trying to setup Wifi Trying to setup Wifi on Kali Linux 4.3 for Broadcom Limited BCM4360 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter [14e4:43a0] (rev 03)\nI keep getting stumped with the 'modprobe: FATAL: Module wl not found.' error \nAny help would be greatly appreciated !!!

Could it be that whatever kind of virus that I stupidly got on my computer was monitoring my login password???\n\nA: Before killing false culprits at random with a great chance to damage your working environment, I suggest you to first attack your original problem.\nDownload a correct malware hunter:\nMalwarebytes.\nDisclaimer: I don't work for them, they have a free version.\nI tested it on many versions of OSX (Mavericks, Yosemite...) and found and fixed some well hidden crapwares left undetected by leader commercial anti-virus.\nWarning: There are a lot of bad and good methods to get rid of Trovi found on the web. Avoid to download from unchecked sources, as you wouldn't drink from any found bottle.\nI didn't test the following, but trust its author since many years.\nI advise you to apply the receipe from Linc Davis:\nHow to remove Trovi from Safari\n\nA: Safari extensions will be in ~/Library/Safari/Extensions/ or possibly /Library/Safari/Extensions/ for global extensions.\nSpotlight won't search in 'system' locations, so for this type of search I always use EasyFind (freeware) which will search anywhere, for visible or hidden files/folders, file contents etc. It doesn't index, so is slower than Spotlight, but much more thorough.\nI'm uncertain as to whether a referenced, yet missing, extension could cause any issues. Normally, the .plist will tidy itself up to just show the currently installed ones; I've not seen any that I didn't specifically put there, but it might be worth making a copy of the .plist & simply erasing the unknown/unwanted listings.\n\nA: First I tried Tetsujin's answer: I looked in ~/Library/Safari/Extensions to check but it was an empty folder besides Extensions.plist and also /Library/Safari/Extensions did not exist.\nNext I downloaded Malwarebytes by recommendation of daniel Azuelos, and when I ran the scan it said my computer was clean.\nThis virus I think is very advanced, for it would change the homepage and search engine of all of my browsers no matter how many times I changed it back. Ultimately, I restored to a Time Machine backup that was made the day before the infected package was installed.\n\nA: It is usually bundled with adware.\nDownload and run Malwarebytes and see if it catches anything. Try downloading AppCleaner as well, and manually drag potentially unwanted programs to AppCleaner. Programs like MPlayerX, MacKeeper, CleanMyMac, MacOptimizer, TuneMyMac, etc. As far as Trovi goes, simply open Safari and navigate to a different webpage (google.com or something similar). Reset your homepage. Clear your history and cache. Check your extensions. And delete any you see. Last resort...hold Shift + Click Safari and it will reset it for you. Clear out everything.\nThat should clear you up pretty well.\n", "Q: How to remove date from Calendar.app dock tile? I want to remove the current date from the Calendar.app dock tile. I have changed its icons (by replacing the icns-files inside the .app) however it still shows the current date over the icon. How can I remove this date?\n\n\nA: Disclaimer: This is an untested (edit: now tested by OP) modification of the Calendar.app, you may do it at your on risk. Back up your computer to an external drive first.\nDoing the following will stop the Calendar dock icon from having that date overlay.\n\n\n*\n\n*If we right-click on Calendar in the Applications folder, an option comes up that says \"Show Package Contents\". That will reveal some (not all) of the inner workings of the Calendar app.\n\n*If you navigate to _CodeSignature and then CodeResources, you will find some of the resources the Calendar app uses to operate. Searching for dock inside that file reveals data keys including\n<key>Resources/Calendar.docktileplugin/Contents/_CodeSignature/CodeResources</key>. This points us to a file that may well control the Calendar icon (notice Calendar.docktileplugin).\n\n*So let's go there. Follow the file tree: back up one step, go to resources, and find the Calendar.docktileplugin folder. Deleting this folder will stop the Calendar app from automatically putting the current date on top of your calendar icon (Edit you might want to save a backup of this plugin as I mention in Edit 2 below). \nThere you have what I believe is the solution to your problem. \nEdit: If the Calendar app crashes on launch, try deleting the original key (from step 2). If that doesn't work, my solution might not be so good.\nEdit 2: Save a backup of the Calendar.docktileplugin folder (like maybe on your Desktop) before deleting it and remember where it went so you can always put it back if the Calendar app just crashes or if you want to restore the Calendar icon to original anytime.\nLet me know if this helps.\n", "Q: Access photos from Iphone 5 with a smashed screen that has never been paired How can I access the photos taken on an Iphone 5 that now has no screen? The phone was never 'paired' with a PC. The problem is that any form of interaction with a PC requires use of the phone screen e.g. to confirm pairing.\nI use Linux but have access to a Windows machine. Please let me know any hacks. I have tried to install Itunes on the Windows machine but can't pair due to a lack of screen access. It would probably be quicker for me to completely circumvent Itunes and Windows and plug into the linux machine and work from the command line if anything along those lines is possible.\n\nA: iOS requires screen interaction on iPhone 5 to enable the USB port to access data.\nUnless you have FBI budget to buy an exploit, the cheapest path forward is to pay someone to get a screen connected long enough to trust your chosen computer. You mOught spend $50 for that service, so it's really a matter of are the photos worth anything. If so, worth sacrificing something else in the family budget since backups were not kept. \nOnce the pairing record is set - you can browse the device without a screen attached - this allows your screen repair to be very temporary. At that point, your recovery proceeds like unprotected devices of old.\n\n\n*\n\n*How to recover photos from an iPhone 3G?\n\nA: Unfortunately as you said that you'll need to access your screen priorly and in order to achieve that you'll first need to repair your iPhone.\nApple offers a Damage Screen repair program but they do indicate that you should perform a full backup as they can't guarantee that you won't lose the information on the phone or that they will swap it out, but if they can replace the screen then so can you if you're a bit handy, there are many places where you could buy a replacement screen repair kit for cheap like this one or this one on Amazon.\n\nPlease note that I'm not affiliated with any of these links nor do I endorse any of them.\n", "Q: Russian keyboard vanishes each time my Mac is started I'm using El Capitan on my Mac Mini now but it started when I used Yosemite.

I'd then switch to the form, click the first box, press a hotkey and the first item would be \"popped\" from the list and pasted into the box. I'd then click the second box, press the hotkey again and the next name would be popped and pasted.\nAs a bonus, it would also be cool if I could do the reverse: click an item, press a hotkey and it's appended to a text file (or a list that can be easily exported as an unformatted text file). I've seen that lots of these other tools can build a list within the app itself, but I really need the output to be in a text file to use for other purposes.\n\nA: The closest I have seen to these requirements is Flycut (free on the App Store)\nIt's extremely simple to use, though it won't automatically pop an item off the stack then move to the next one.\nHowever, when you invoke Flycut (assuming you are starting at the top of the stack), you can just press the down arrow key ↓ to go to the next item.

I am upgrading the hard drive to an SSD. I understand you have to download the software to a bootable USB. Which software should I download, Yosemite or the original software that came with the MacBook?\n\nA: If you bought Yosemite in the past, you can see if this version of OS X appears in the App Store as items you purchased. If so, you should be able to download the installer.\nThe instructions to create a bootable installer are given at the Apple web site: Create a bootable installer for OS X. Below, I have include a excerpt from this site.\nUse the 'createinstallmedia' command in Terminal\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the OS X installer from the Mac App Store. Quit the\ninstaller if it opens automatically after downloading. The installer\nwill be in your Applications folder.\n\n*Mount your USB flash drive or other volume. You could also use a\nsecondary internal partition.\n\n*Open the Terminal app, which is in the Utilities folder of your\nApplications folder.\n\n*Use the createinstallmedia command in Terminal to create the\nbootable installer. Examples of this command are in the next\nsection. For detailed usage instructions, make sure that the\nappropriate Install OS X app is in your Applications folder, then\nenter one of the following paths in Terminal:\n\n\nPath for El Capitan:\n/Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia\n\nPath for Yosemite:\n/Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia\n\nPath for Mavericks: \n/Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia\n\nExamples\nThis is the basic syntax of the command. Replace volume path with the path to your USB flash drive or other volume, and replace installer path with the path to the Install OS X app. \ncreateinstallmedia --volume volumepath --applicationpath installerpath\n\nExample for El Capitan:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app\n\nExample for Yosemite:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app\n\nExample for Mavericks:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Mavericks.app\n\nIf you can not download Yosemite from the App Store.\n\nNote: What is written below has only been tested on Macs that are not using Core Storage.\n\nAnother alternative would be to create bootable USB flash drive OS X Recovery Disk. Basically, you would be coping your Recovery partition to a flash drive. You can the boot to this flash drive to download and install Yosemite on your SSD.\nTo create this Recovery Disk, you will need to download the OS X Recovery Disk Assistant v1.0. Even though Recovery Disk Assistant only refers to Lion and Mountain Lion, the Assistant will also work with Yosemite.\nUsing you HDD as the external bootable installer.\nYou could try purchasing USB external drive enclosure for your HDD. Or at least, purchase a SATA to USB adaptor. You then could try booting to the Recovery partition on the HDD. If successful, Yosemite could then be downloaded and installed on the new internal SSD.\nIf there is no way to perform a new installation of Yosemite.\nThis solution requires creating a El Capitan USB installer flash drive and connecting the HDD via a USB port.\nBoot from the USB installer and launch the Disk Utility application. Create a partition on the new SSD. Restore the Yosemite partition from the HDD to the SDD. This is referred to as cloning.\nNote the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*The two drives may need to be using the same sector size. There are\nonly two sector sizes currently in use: 512 bytes and 4096 bytes.\n\n*You made need to reduce the size of the hard disk partition to be\nsmaller than the SSD partition. You may need to do this while booted\nto Yosemite on the HDD.\n\n", "Q: My Macbook’s hard drive is encrypted using FileVault 2. Will adding a new user with a different password break the encryption? I want to add a separate account or accounts to use as chroot accounts for an FTP server, and I want to use different passwords for these accounts.  I know the AES-128 key used by FileVault is calculated from the password, so will using a new password cause FileVault to try to encrypt using a different key, making the ciphertext inconsistent?  Or does FileVault calculate the key based on the password you used when you first encrypt the hard drive?  I'm not sure about this, and I don't want to break my computer.\n\nA: FileVault 2 will encrypt the boot volume and allow you to unlock that volume based upon existing user accounts.\nAdding a new user account on OS X El Capitan (10.11.6) will automatically add that account to FileVault 2's list of enabled users.  So no, you won't revert your existing setup or remove an existing account's ability to unlock an encrypted volume.\nThe built-in fdesetup account is also very useful (requires sudo privileges):\n\n list       [-extended] [--offline] [-verbose]\n            List enabled users, or locked volumes.\n\n enable     [[[-user username ...] [-usertoadd added_username ...]] |\n            [-inputplist]] [-outputplist] [-prompt] [-forcerestart]\n            [-authrestart] [-keychain | [-certificate path_to_cer_file]]\n            [[-defer file_path] [-forceatlogin max_cancel_attempts]\n            [-dontaskatlogout]] [-norecoverykey] [-verbose]\n            Enables FileVault.

This does mean that you need to treat Downloads as a temporary location, when you download you then move it to a directory you use.\nIf these do not suit your problem I think you need to expand how things could mess up - also how are they backed up - if you go through this in detail then I think you will see you need to change your working practice\n", "Q: If I sign up for the 3 free months of Apple Music, do I keep Match-ed songs when the trial ends? If I sign up for the Apple Music free trial (which now includes audio fingerprinting iTunes Match), will I keep my (DRM-free but watermarked) Matched music when the trial ends?\n\nA: You would need to be sure you have downloaded a copy of all music before the period ends.

On the Mac mini I used Firefox but on the iMac I am starting out with Safari.\nI publish a blog with a new post every day. Frequently, my daily post includes a copy of something that has been published on another blog and contains links to other sites beyond that.\nHowever, when I copy and paste that content across to my own blog it does not automatically copy across the embedded html links that were in the original. Firefox did copy across those links.\nIs there a setting in Safari that will change the way a copy is made so that those html links are included without any other keystrokes required from me?\nDid that all make sense?\n\nA: As far as I have seen Safari does not copy the URLs when you select text with URLs in them. However that may be more of a function of the destination. I say this because if you select text (pictures too) from a web page that has hyperlinks in it, paste it into an MS Office document and MS Word preserves all formatting, including hyperlinks, pictures and formatting as it appeared on the source web page.\nSo you may have to use Firefox on your new iMac to do that particular thing assuming you don't want to copy the source of the page just the intact URLs.\n", "Q: Apple Music songs when canceling account and starting a new one If I cancel my Apple Music membership and start a new membership will I be able to play the songs I downloaded from my previous membership?

However, it only works one file at a time.\nTo work in mass the script needs:\n\n\n*\n\n*to loop through all the .numbers files in a directory\n\n*to write csv files to a specified directory\n\n\nA: Automator is the tool for the job.\nYou can do a \"watch me do\" and have it export an already open file to a new folder as csv. Then stop recording the script.\nAt that point, you can add an acton to process files and folders so the script will one by one open each file, save it to the new location. As long as the names aren't conflicting, you would have an easy tool.\nBetter would be to script the actual export options, but start simple and then add the batch processing.\n", "Q: How is the Compressed Mem column in Activity Monitor calculated?

Now I'm thinking it's actually (1)!\n\nA: Through various tests on my machine, I have discovered that: The app is using 2.6 GB in addition to the 1GB of compressed memory.\nOn the Safari Webpage Content processes, if you max out the memory used on your machine, you will see the memory go down as compressed go up. This is how I tested it, and I assume it will work for other apps, but safari usually uses the most memory for me.\n", "Q: Can't download El Capitan from Appstore.

I'm stuck with this spinning wheel at the top left corner where the \"Back\" and \"Forward\" buttons are with the \"Download\" button grayed out after clicking on it. No response or any indication that it is downloading.\n \nAny ideas? Support is out for the day, so I hope I can get an answer by tonight. \n\nA: This is not really a true answer. But eventually after attempting to download El Capitan several times, it all of a sudden began to download. Once it downloaded I put the OS on a flash drive, booted off of it, wiped the drive, and performed a clean install. After that the system has been operating flawlessly. I guess when they gave it to me, something must have gone wrong during the install that got overlooked? not sure. \nTo be honest I do not know what software I was trying to install first when this all began. But it was something simple. This happened to me on every installation of any product that involved using an installation package. i.e. Adobe flash, Teamviewer, my logitech mouse drivers. It was happening on everything I tried to install. I just don't remember the first thing it was I tried to install.\nAnyways now it's all up and running after the clean install, and performs flawlessly. Hopefully this doesn't occur to me again. \nThanks,\nSicariuxs\n", "Q: NTFS and Veracrypt VS HFS+ Encrypted? I want to create a backup disk where I occasionally connect it to my macOS and copy important things manually.\nI may also connect this disk to Windows in rare cases.\nI also want to encrypt the disk/container.\nI accept to lose the ability to use this disk on Windows. (which may occur if I choose HFS+ encrypted)\nWhat is the most reliable and fast way to achieve this?\nUsing NTFS and Veracrypt?\nUsing HFS+ Encrypted?\n\nA: If you format the disk exFAT you will have a disk that is read and writable on both systems. Then on the mac side you can create an encrypted disk image on that drive that is only accessible on a Mac. You can also create an encrypted .zip file on the PC (with 3rd party software) that is only readable on a PC.\nAlternatively, if you don't mind partitioning the drive, you can create a drive with one NTFS and one HFS+ partition on it then you can encrypt both at the file system level and each will be accessible only on their corresponding operating system.\n", "Q: El Capitan - Increasing/Resizing the BootCamp Partition Size I'm running OS X 10.11.5 El Capitan with a 240GB SSD. I made a 50GB BootCamp Partition using this guide because my usb/dvd wasn't being detected. I found myself searching for space because I somehow only have ~16gb left after installation of several programs. I need around 2-5GB more. \nUpon research, I found this youtube guide which basically makes a 3rd partition, booting in Windows, and then using MiniTool Partition Wizard, have the windows partition \"take\" the 3rd blank/unused partition. However, upon further research, I've seen this thread among several others that say that this method does NOT work on El Capitan. It primarily has something to do with the partition mapping and how adding a third one makes you unable to boot in Windows. There are comments that say it works on El Capitan and some say it doesn't. I'm not sure if those who managed to make it work did 10+ steps in between or if those who didn't manage to make it work simply weren't resourceful enough, and I'm not taking a risk by figuring it out on my own.\nI then found Paragon Campture which seems promising as it says it support El Capitan. I know this isn't free and I'll have to shell out cash, however, I'm okay with the free 2GB reallocation. My main concern is that I haven't seen as much feed back (I'm pretty sure I'm looking at the wrong places) about Paragon on El Capitan but so far, they seem to be the most solid choices. It would greatly help if I got feedback from anyone who used Paragon on El Capitan.\nI know the old method is to scrap the Windows Partition and reinstall one using the Boot Camp Assistant, however, as I stated above, I took a pretty darn long way around installing Windows on my Mac and I don't wanna do that again.\nAny feedback on these software, or any tips on how to make MiniTool Partition Wizard work on El Capitan, will be very much appreciated.\n\nA: The product I have used for years to solve such a problem is Winclone. According to Russel Scheil at Twocanoes Software, the Basic edition is all you should need. You install Winclone as an OS X application. The steps to create a larger Boot Camp partition are given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Winclone to create a compressed backup up of your Boot Camp\npartition. This backup can be stored in any Mac OS Extended (HFS+)\nformatted volume.\n\n*Delete your Boot Camp partition.\n\n*Resize your OS X volume.\n\n*Create a MSDOS (FAT) formatted partition. This partition will need to the same size or larger than the original Boot Camp partition.\n\n*Use Winclone to restore Windows to the MSDOS (FAT) formatted\npartition. Winclone will change the partition to NTFS format. If\nWinclone is running under El Capitan, you will first need to disable\nSystem Integrity Protection (SIP) before restoring Windows.\n\n", "Q: USB port problems on new MacBook Pro? I have been using Duet and a Wacom with my MacBook Pro Retina (2012) for a year and have been very pleased with it. \nLast week I got a new MacBook Pro (2015). I've been using the Wacom with it with no trouble. Today I connected my iPad 2 as a second display and it started chiming every second just like you said. As if it's not getting enough power (even though System Information says it is getting 1000mA when only 500mA is required, and there is 500mA extra available). \nSo now Duet can't run with the iPad chiming because it is constantly disconnecting. I tried various cables, but everything works on the old MacBook just not on the new one. \nSo I've reset the PRAM and the SMC. I tried charging the iPad to 100% before connecting, with the Magsafe charger connected and without, switching USB ports, disconnecting the Wacom, etc. \nMost of the time it just chimes, occasionally it stays connected and charging, at which point Duet will work. Then after a while it disconnects and I can only get it to chime again. \nThis does not occur with the other MacBook Pro, which is running the same Mac OS (10.11.6) and the same version of Duet (I tried downgrading, it worked once and then no more). \nDoes anyone know how I might diagnose this as a hardware problem, before I bring it in for service?\n\nA: To diagnose Hardware problems on your mac, you can follow the instructions located at https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT202731 it typically takes around 10 minutes to diagnose. \n", "Q: Can't ping local devices by network name after DNS change Today I was changing the Wifi network adapter settings to give my MacBook Pro a static IP address on the local network (disabling DHCP), and for this I had to add the DNS servers that I looked up in my router's admin interface.\nUpon adding the first DNS server with the \"+\" icon in the DNS tab of the adapter advanced properties, all the entries that were already present in the list of DNS servers vanished without me taking notice of what they were. (I figured they weren't so important). So I added both DNS servers provided by my router's status page as well as the router IP address (you never know).\nAfter applying the parameters, I noticed I could not ping my Raspberry Pi with it's network name raspberrypi anymore, nor could I connect via SSH to it with this name. I have to use the IP address instead.\nThis leads me to believe I lost a DNS server in the process. How can I find out which DNS server to add in order to be able to ping devices by network name again?\nThanks\n\nA: Your router's DNS servers won't know about your private device names, but chances are your router will. Add your royter's IP address to the list of DNS servers and drag it to\nthe top of the list. \n", "Q: spotify doesn't care about mission control settings I have my Mission Control (el capitan, 10.11) settings the way I like:\n\"When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application\" is OFF.\nThis works very well except for Spotify. Also, I have Spotify \"locked\" for a specific Desktop.\nIt's very annoying to do a cmd-tab and switch 3 desktops. And then, it doesn't switch back with another cmd-tab.\nHow can I make Spotify obey the Mission Control setting?\n\nA: Spotify doesn't support multiple windows. The reason for this statement is absence of New Window in File Menu. So it switches to the desktop it is at. \n", "Q: What is the best way to connect an external 4K display to an iMac 2015 for optimal performance I'm experiencing some kind of ghosting problem when connecting my iiyama 40'' monitor to my iMac 27'' retina 5K display (osx 10.11).  Not sure about the term ghosting but when moving screens (and mouse pointer) on the external monitor, they behave sluggish and the contrast whith the movement on my retina display is huge and therefor a bit annoying (it is not display lag).  I also had the same problem when connecting my iMac to a Samsung 4K tv (UE40JU6000) even in 'game mode'.

A friend of mine asked me to set up their new external HD for both Time Machine and file storage, and to transfer over files from their old HD. I started to partition the new drive using Disk Utility, but the partition option was greyed out. The entire disk was formatted as exFat, so I thought to reformat it as HFS+. I began to do so with diskUtil: diskUtil erasedisk hfs+ External /dev/disk2 (Note: this is on a Macbook Pro running El Capitan)\nHowever, I mistyped. The new drive was not disk2, it was disk3--I had started to erase the old disk instead, which has important data in it. I realized my problem in an instant and ^C'd my way out of there, but the damage was done. Here's the sitch:\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminal output says:\nStarting erase on disk2\nUnmounting disk\ndiskutil:interrupted\n$ diskUtil list\n...\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk2\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS                         999.8 GB   disk2s2\n\n\n*As you can see, OSX recognizes the drive as GPT and the partition as HFS+.

(It gave me a warning that said something about being unable to fix it and to try using chkdsk).\n\n*I am not 100% certain what the state of this HD was before I half-formatted it. It was first used and formatted on a cheap Windows laptop when Vista was the newest Windows OS, so I would think that it was NTFS on an MBR scheme before I violated it.

I need to recover about 700GB of data, perhaps NTFS/MBR, on a drive that thinks it's HFS+/GPT. All of the data has got to be there, more or less at least, but I need help accessing it. If you have any insight or knowledge that could help me out, I would truly appreciate it.\n(Lastly, I've downloaded and installed some data recovery software from Easeus. It's running a \"scan\" on the drive, and I suspect it'll fix my problem if I dish over $90 or so. This is just a last resort, though. I'd really rather not have this headache become an expensive one, and since it's picking a lot of data, I know there's gotta be a way to solve this with some elbow grease.)\n\nA: You should be able to restore at least the boundaries of the old NTFS volume:\nWindows (like OS X) uses some default partition schemes to partition and format a disk.\nAn MBR/NTFS disk usually has an MBR in the first block (block0). The first partition usually starts at the 1 MB boundary (that's block2048) with a special block - the NTFS Boot Sector - and ends with a special block. Both blocks start with EB 52 90 4E 54 46 53 20 (hex) or ∂RENTFS(x20). The last 4096 blocks (2 MiB) are empty space usually.\nDepending on how much was written while creating (\"erasing\") the new main HFS+ volume (usually about 120 - 160 MB after the process finished) the success of a data recovery may vary.\n\nDetach any external drive except the broken one!\nTo recover the old NTFS volume boundaries you have to delete the GUID partition table and restore an MBR partition scheme:\nTo remove the GUIDpt, first open Terminal.app and get an overview (below I assume the disk identifier of the falsely formatted disk is disk2):\ndiskutil list\nsudo gpt -r show disk2\n\nThe result is similar to the one below (your total size - here 1953525760 blocks and the main volume - here 1952853936 blocks - may differ slightly):\n         0          1         PMBR\n         1          1         Pri GPT header\n         2         32         Pri GPT table\n        34          6         \n        40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n    409640 1952853936      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n1953263576     262151         \n1953525727         32         Sec GPT table\n1953525759          1         Sec GPT header\n\nRemove the GUIDpt:\ndiskutil umountDisk disk2\nsudo gpt destroy disk2 \ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk2 bs=512 count=1\n\nSearch the disk for the string ∂RENTFS(x20) in the last sectors of the disk:\nhexdump -s 930g /dev/rdisk2  | grep \"eb 52 90 4e 54 46 53 20\"\n\n-s: Skip offset bytes from the beginning of the input. The size is KiB/MiB/GiB. In my example the disk has a size of 931.51 GiB, so I searched the last 1.51 Gib only.\nThe result is e8e0bffe00 eb 52 90 4e 54 46 53 20 20 20 20 00 02 08 00 00 with e8e0bffe00 being the offset in hex.\nConverted with a hex2dec service this means an offset of 1000203091456 (dividing this by 512, the result is equal to block 1953521663).\nSince this block is the last one in the previous volume you can determine the old volume size: 1953521663 (last block) - 2048 (probable start block) + 1 (counting starts with 0). The result has to be divisible by 8!\nYou may also check the first blocks of the disk with:\nhexdump /dev/rdisk2  | grep \"eb 52 90 4e 54 46 53 20\"\n\nYou should get at least one line like this: 800 eb 52 90 4e 54 46 53 20 20 20 20 00 02 08 00 00.

A few weeks later I made a copy of that home folder, renamed it \"B\", and created a personal account for her, short name also \"B\" and allowed it to \"adopt\" the \"B\" home folder. Account B also has admin privileges.\nUsing account B, she gets \"You don't have permission to view its contents\" messages when she tries to access her ~/Documents folder (and probably other folders as well but I don't have her machine in front of me at the moment). Seemingly, adopting the copy did not include taking ownership of its contents.\nIs a recursive chown the proper fix? I'm hesitant to blast ahead and just try things as she's leaving for college tomorrow!\n\nA: Since account \"B\" didn't exist when you copied that folder over, then the files would not be owned by that user.  You can do a recursive chown to correct the situation.\nHowever, I might suggest that you use the Finder's tools to make the modifications for you.  If you select that folder in the finder and select File > Get Info (or command-I) you can then adjust the owner in the \"Sharing & Permissions\" section to change the owner and apply the changes recursively.  To me, this approach would have a lower risk of issues cropping up later.\nWhen she is off at college, remember that you can use Messages to do Screen Sharing.  You can click on \"Details\" in the upper right corner and ask to share her screen.

We want to bring it into the family account for monitoring and such.  Can I reset the device and assign a new Apple ID for the child?  And should I assume any purchases made under the old Apple ID are lost forever?  (We have no access to the account.)  \n\nA: To start, let's talk about the music on it. The music is sort of tied to the Apple ID (not iPod itself). By \"sort of\", I mean you need that Apple ID to download it, but signing out of the Apple ID and into a new one won't delete it. For example, if you were to purchase music under one Apple ID and then signed out of it and into another, the music would remain on iPod, but if the music was then deleted (like when iPod is reset), you would be unable to re-download it, since it's not tied to iPod itself.\nWhat you need to do is use iTunes to sync iPod to the iTunes Library on your computer. Once you're sure the songs (and anything else you want to keep) are all there, you can go ahead and reset it.\nIf it's running iOS 6.1.6 or earlier (to check, go to Settings > General > About, then look under Version), then yes, you can reset it and assign a new Apple ID to it without any problems. If it's running iOS 7.0 or later, however, it depends on whether or not Find My iPod is enabled (to check, Settings > iCloud, and look for Find My iPod at the bottom). If so, resetting it will trigger the device's Activation Lock and you won't be able to set it up. In that case, you will need the Apple ID password of whomever gave your child this iPod to disable Find My iPod, but once it's off, you can go ahead and reset it.\nOnce it's reset, use iTunes to transfer whatever content you want back to it.\nIf you have any questions about any of this, just comment them below my answer.\n", "Q: How to use the secondary mac's keyboard when using Target Display Mode I basically want to be able to connect my MacBook to my stationary Mac and  use the keyboard and mouse on the MacBook.

For one embodiment, a network interface and a fan controller receive power during the network state maintenance but a display or audio components do not receive power during the network state maintenance. The inventors are Ethan Bold, Stuart Cheshire, J. Rhoads Hollowell, Joe Liu and Dean R. Reece.\nHere's Apple's background and summary of the invention: \"The various embodiments described herein relate to power management of a processing system. In particular, embodiments include the processing system entering a dark wake state from a from a low power state by powering up select components, maintaining a network state, and returning to the sleep state.\n\"Computer systems are often used to perform various tasks over a network. When a computer system connects to a network, it establishes a network state with a server or another networked device. In order to make efficient use of network resources, network states may expire and can be periodically maintained or renewed. Additionally, a computer system may periodically update a network state.\n\"If the computer system is placed in a low power state (e.g., a sleep state), however, the computer system typically terminates the network state (e.g., allows it to expire) or periodically \"wakes up\" to a full power state (including user-perceptible components such as video and audio), to maintain, renew, or otherwise update an existing network state.\n\"Exemplary embodiments of methods, apparatuses, and systems for powering up select components of a computer from a sleep state, maintaining a network state, and powering down the select components of the computer to return the computer to the sleep state are described. For one embodiment, the select components include a network interface and do not include a display or audio components. For one embodiment a fan controller receives power during the maintaining of the network state.\n\"These embodiments allow a system to appear to a user to be asleep while performing maintenance of the network state but also continue to protect the system from overheating by keeping the fan controller on. The fan controller can include subsystems which monitor temperature and determine whether to turn a fan on or off; for example, the fan controller can include temperature sensors and processing logic that determines, using information from the temperature sensors whether to turn on or off a fan or other cooling device in order to protect the system. For one embodiment, the fan controller receives power even while the system is in one or more levels of sleep.\"\n-- Dennis Sellers\nIt would appear that your computer is performing a Dark Wake, but is unable to maintain good thermal management, possibly due to high ambient temps, and is therefore returning to full sleep for a cool-down period.\n", "Q: External display : why 59Hz instead of 60Hz on Macbook Pro 15\" mid-2012 @ 2560 x 1440 via DisplayPort I connected an LG 27UD88-W to my 2012 15\" Macbook Pro via DisplayPort.\nHowever, it does not seem to connect at the expected 60Hz for the 2560x1440 resolution, but instead it shows 59Hz.\nOne could argue \"oh well, you won't notice that 1Hz\" but that is not the point.\nI like to understand things.\nDoes anyone have an explanation for this?\n\n\nA: You can pretty much always attribute this one to a rounding error in the way the information is displayed to you. The actual refresh rate is somewhere very near 59.97Hz, leading whatever function they've run the number through for parsing to only display the whole number digits, and not perform any actual rounding.\nThis does lead to some interesting effects though. Some applications will do this and end up with a V-Sync rate that's not actually synced (They fake it and do framerate lock instead, leading to 59fps when you actually need 59.97fps exactly.)\n", "Q: How do I run Launchd as root?

So adding a plist in ~/Library/LaunchAgents and loading/starting it, will run a task in behalf of the user logged in - and only this one, because no other user has access to this folder. You can't run a launch agent with the rights of another user and the key UserName is no valid option in there.\nA launch agent in /Library/LaunchAgents will also run in the realm of the logged in user. But every user logging in will initiate it. So two users logged in at the same time will each start an arbitrary agent task with the respective rights/permissions.\nThe system's LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons folders are forbidden area, so you are left creating a launch daemon in /Library/LaunchDaemons.\nSince launch daemons already run with root permissions use the following plist local.hosts.blocking.plist in /Library/LaunchDaemons/ (naming conventions regarding label/error file and standard output file already included):\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>  \n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">  \n<plist version=\"1.0\">  \n<dict>  \n    <key>Label</key>  \n    <string>local.hosts.blocking</string>  \n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>  \n    <array>  \n        <string>cp</string>  \n        <string>/etc/hosts_BLOCKED_sites.txt</string>  \n        <string>/etc/hosts</string>  \n    </array>  \n    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>  \n    <array>  \n        <dict>  \n        ....\n        </dict>  \n    </array>  \n    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>                                                                                                                                                          \n    <string>/tmp/local.hosts.blocking.err</string>\n    <key>StandardOutPath</key> \n    <string>/tmp/local.hosts.blocking.out</string>  \n</dict>  \n</plist>\n\nApply standard permissions to the plist: root:wheel/644 and load/start it with:\nsudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/local.hosts.blocking.plist\n\n\nA: The asker mentions LaunchAgents a couple of times and @klanomath's answer is correct: in this case a LaunchDaemon is probably the appropriate approach.\nHowever for Googlers that are trying to give a LaunchAgent elevated sudo/root privileges, I recommend checking out or this answer on this question about LaunchAgents.\nIt describes a method of having selectively elevated privileges for the user and command you're running, allowing launchctl to run sudo without an interactive password prompt.\n", "Q: Use Automator to copy single folder to multiple locations I have several website project folders in a structure like this:\nClient Work\n\n|- Client 1\n  |- client1site\n    |- admin\n      |- core\n\n|- Client 2\n  |- client2site\n    |- admin\n      |- core\n\n|- Client 3\n  |- client3site\n    |- admin\n      |- core\n\nThe diagram above just shows the key folders, there are others.

This doesn't just apply to right-clicking.  Really I could have titled this:\nWhere is the \"blank space\" when in list view in Finder?\nOpen a Windows Explorer window in Windows and change to \"Details\" view.  Notice that at the far right of the window, there is basically an \"empty column\" or \"blank space\" where you can right-click to activate a context menu for actions within that folder.\nSimilarly, if I want to drag and drop a file(s) or folder(s) into that active folder, I can drag it to that \"blank space\" and avoid accidentally placing the files into a subfolder or activating an exe/batch file.\nNow, the same behavior is available in macOS... to a point.  In \"icons\" view, I can always find a \"blank space\" to click between the icons.\nHowever, in the other three views - list, columns, and Cover Flow - I find it incredibly annoying that there seems to be no place I can safely right-click (and similarly no place to safely drop a file or folder that I am moving).\nNote this only applies when there are enough files or folders within the folder to require scrolling.  If there are only a few files in the list, then you can easily right-click in the empty space below the files.\nSo, my question is this:\nGiven a folder full of files which requires a scrollbar to view all the contents, where can you safely right-click to display a context menu, or safely drag and drop a file or folder?\nI did find this almost identical question: How to copy-paste in Finder when there's no right-click space?\nHowever, no one seems to answer whether or not there is any such space.  Based on this previous question, is the answer simply that there is no reliable blank space in macOS that allows you to open a context menu or to drag a file or folder?\n\nA:  Opt ⌥  + right click will show the overall 'folder' contextual menu as opposed to the 'item selected' menu.  \n...though, irritatingly, only in Column View.\n\nA: As noted in the other answer, drag-and-drop into the open folder can occur anywhere there is no text.\n\nAll contextual options that are intended to affect the currently open folder can be accessed from the gear menu icon on the Finder toolbar (with the exception of the View submenu, as that is addressed by other icons on the Finder toolbar). I haven't changed my toolbar in years, so it's possible it's not there by default - if not, it can be added by right-clicking on the toolbar and selecting Customize Toolbar.\nNote this menu does change depending on what's selected. If you have an item selected, you will see some options specifically for that item, but most of the general items from the right-click menu (New Folder, Arrange By, etc.) are present regardless of whether an item is selected or not.\nYou can also have no items selected by using Command+click on the item that is selected to deselect it.\n\nA: The place that you can right click on \"blank space\" in list view is below the list items. This is only available if the window is larger than the list it contains. If the list of items is longer than the window and it needs to scroll, there is no place in the window that you can right click on blank space.\n\nDropping files into a window is easier.  If you drag an item on any of the text in a list view, it will highlight the row and you will drag onto it.  However, if you drag an item onto the space that doesn't have text, it will put a blue outline around the window, indicating that you are dropping into the window, not into one of the items listed.\n\n", "Q: Voice Memos on the iPad iPhones have a dedicated Voice Memos app. iPads don't, despite running the same OS and also featuring a built-in microphone.\nSince the answer to 1 is probably \"no\", what current alternatives do people use? \n(ideally free simple app that works the same way like Voice Memos on the iPhone) \n\nA: *\n\n*There are no clones of the voice memos app for iPad. \n\n*Options include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Microsoft Onenote     (this one is a little more complex, and has different features, including adding additional photos, videos, lists, etc.)\n\n*Audio Memos Free - The Voice Recorder by Imesart S.a.r.l.

It may be possible to have a \"data sync only\" with a Nokia device, but not an Apple device.\nI found articles describing altering the 8-pin, but those resulted in shorting and other problems, so this is not advisable. \nI also identified no apps that disable charging in the iOS App Store.\nOn thing you could do is turn on iTunes wi-fi syncing. Plug your iPad into your computer. Open iTunes. Click the checkbox that enables wi-fi syncing under \"Options.\"\nMy iPad Pro says that it has to be plugged in to sync automatically, but I was able to do it manually without it being plugged in. Just go to General > iTunes Wi-Fi Sync > Sync Now.\n\n\nA: I know this question is old, but if anyone comes looking for it, I found a trick that seems to work if both devices have USB-C.\nTake a USB-C to USB-A cable and a USB-A to USB-C dongle. Then connect the dongle end to the iPad and the USB-C end to the Mac. That way, the iPad will behave as the host in the USB protocol, so the Mac won't charge it (and the iPad doesn't supply enough power to charge the Mac).\nIf anyone is wondering \"why would you ever do this?\", my use case is when using SideCar — it makes no sense to drain power from the laptop when the iPad is perfectly able to last hours on its own battery. Apparently it works for SideCar, but not for syncing via Finder. I put the iPad in Airplane mode to make sure it's not fallbacking to wi-fi.\n", "Q: Can't use or change my system password.

I've noticed the machine hasn't slept well last night. There were events logged every couple of seconds in system.log throughout the entire night that the lid was closed.\nI think it might be that two processes are preventing sleep while on A/C.\n# pmset -g\nSystem-wide power settings:\n[...]\nsleep                10 (sleep prevented by UserEventAgent, UserEventAgent)\n\nCan I stop these processes (or any other process) from preventing sleep?\n\nA: There are dozens of things that can prevent sleep built into macOS, and third party software can also disable sleep.\nThe first troubleshooting step is to run this command in Terminal:\npmset -g assertions\n\nThat will list the reasons your Mac is not currently asleep. Normally running on battery power you should get:\nAssertion status system-wide:\n   BackgroundTask                 0\n   ApplePushServiceTask           0\n   UserIsActive                   1\n   PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep    0\n   PreventSystemSleep             0\n   ExternalMedia                  0\n   PreventUserIdleSystemSleep     0\n   NetworkClientActive            0\n\n[further details removed for brevity]\n\nWhich means the only reason your mac isn't sleeping is due to user activity on the mouse/keyboard.\nIf you see something else (like PreventUserIdleSystemSleep) then your mac probably won't sleep at all and you should read the other details provided by pmset -g assertions to investigate further.\n\nA: UserEventAgent suggests an input device was in active use. This may be a faulty mouse, keyboard, or other input device like a gamepad.\nTry disconnecting all your externally connected devices and seeing if this behaviour continues.\nAnother cause may be a pet or vibrations causing a device to register movement.\nIs Wake for network access enabled? See System Preferences > Energy Saver for this setting. Waking for network access will occasionally wake a sleeping Mac to examine and maintain the network environment.\nAlternatively, consider using a third party tool to help put your Mac to sleep despite power assertions.\n\nA: In my case it was because I was running the iPhone emulator that comes with XCode. Closing the emulator down removed sleep prevented by UserEventAgent.\nI only had one occurrence of UserEventAgent though. When I ran pmset -g I got this:\n~$ pmset -g\nSystem-wide power settings:\nCurrently in use:\n [...]\n sleep                10 (sleep prevented by UserEventAgent)\n\n\nA: In my case the culprit was a Bluetooth keyboard with low batteries. Recharging the batteries fixed the problem. \nActually I got what I deserved because I ignored the \"Keyboard batteries low\" notifications for a week. My MacMini got so upset (they don't like being neglected) that she could not sleep... :-)\n\nA: For anyone mildly interested in saving energy I created this function and saved it in my .bash_profile, then to sleep I just open up terminal and enter the sleepAndClose\nfunction sleepAndClose {\n  osascript -e 'quit app \"SecuritySpy\"'\n  osascript -e 'quit app \"VLC\"'\n  osascript -e 'quit app \"qemu-system-x86_64\"'\n  pmset displaysleepnow\n}\n\n", "Q: How to stop iOS from showing tomorrow's birthdays everyday My iPhone, for some reason (I haven't set up anything like that), shows the next day's birthdays everyday at 12:00 (at noon).

The SMC appears to work, so it's simply not allowing power-on due to a problem elsewhere in the computer. \n\nA: The DC in board in any Mac is a little computer in and of itself. It's a little more complicated than the computer (processor/controller) that's embedded in a lightning cable / thunderbolt cable / your MagSafe charging cable but less complicated than the computer in your power adapter.\nThe light going orange means that the charge board doesn't sense a fully charged battery. That's all that's really alive - so you would need to have a technician to take apart your computer to isolate why it's not starting.\nUnless you want to take on that role - the best advice would be to run through the normal steps when a computer will not start.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204267\n", "Q: In AirPort Utility, what is the menu item \"Restore Default Settings\"?

The Macbook is in a vertical dock in closed clamshell mode. It's plugged in with the screen off, and I've got a cheap Anker keyboard and Magic Trackpad 2 connected to it. When it's plugged in via HDMI to the monitor, whether the monitor is on or off, the CPU load is constantly at 100% with the fan spinning rather loudly. \nActivity Monitor shows the CPU load is almost all from kernel_task, and ~3% user, ~97% system. \nWhen I unplug the HDMI cable, the fan stops going and CPU usage drops immensely. \nIs this behavior from my Macbook as unusual/harmful as I would think, and what can I do about it?\nEdit: Google Chrome and Xcode are running significantly slower on the monitor than they do on my Macbook itself.\nEdit 2: As soon as a posted this, my fan stopped whirring so rapidly (though CPU usage did not drop from 100), and Activity Monitor showed that CPU usage is about 15% each from 5 different Google Chrome Helpers (?) and only 1% from kernel_task. What on earth?\n\nA: In the end, after I let Activity Monitor calculate things for a few minutes, it was Google Chrome Helpers causing the CPU load and not the connection to the monitor. I quit Google Chrome and killed its Helpers, then restarted Chrome about an hour later, and the problem fully subsided.\nIf the CPU load doesn't come from one of the apps, and really is only happening because of then monitor connection, see bmike's answer.\n\nA: The behavior of kernel task taking CPU is a protective measure so you don't really need to worry about it.\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU usage is too high with Yosemite and an external monitor\nWhat you can do is keep the system cool otherwise, reduce the pixels or refresh rate on the display or choose a smaller display.\n", "Q: Adjust width of spacer between Mac OS dock icons Many of you might know that it is possible to add a spacer to the Mac OS dock icons with:\n$ defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add '{\"tile-type\"=\"spacer-tile\";}'\n$ killall Dock\n\nbut the problem is, I find them a bit wide by default.

I am confused. I was wondering if this means something is downloading because I just trying to sync music from my ITunes on PC, to my IPad, but everytime I click on a song, it says \"Item Not Available.\" Do the arrows mean something is downloading? If not, what are they an indicator for?\n\nA: This is the iTunes sync indicator, which indicates that the device is syncing with iTunes over USB or Wi-Fi.\n", "Q: iPhone 5 no longer responding to touch My iPhone 5 touchscreen is not responding to touch! Last night, my phone was working just fine. I plugged it in overnight to charge, and when I checked my phone this morning, the touchscreen had broken.\nHere's what's going wrong now:\n\n\n*\n\n*The touchscreen isn't responding (I can't slide to unlock), though the screen is on.\n\n*There are a bunch of lines on the screen, which disappear after the phone stays on for a few seconds or when I click the sleep/wake button.\n\n\nThe power button and home button are working as they should, I just can't get past the lock screen because I can't swipe to unlock (it's not registering the swipe or any taps).\nWhat can I do to fix this?\n\nA: I would recommend bringing the phone into your local Apple Store or using the official Apple repair site to send it in.\nSometimes, even when there is no obvious cause for screen damage, it can still happen somehow. This happened to a previous phone that I owned, I sent it in and the screen was replaced, fixing the problem.\n\nA: None responsive touch coupled with visual lines on the visual display is indicative of a damaged lcd screen. \nThis can happen in numerous ways, but ultimately end up in a screen replacement which usually solves the issue 99% of the time.\n\nA: My iphone 5s touch screen stopped working. It did work again after a while for like 5h and then stopped for good.\nI decided to put it in a ziplock bag, get a bit of the air out and then I put it in the freezer for about 1-2h. Before I put it in the freezer the battery was at 7% then when I took it out 1% and it shut down.\nI had it on charge for 1h but it didn't want to open at all so I took it out and left it till I woke up in the morning. I opened it , it was at about 47% battery and the touch screen was working and it still works (3rd day).\n", "Q: How to use an Apple ID when using hdesetup? In setting up FileVault in System Preferences>Security & Privacy, there is an option to use your Apple ID as a method to de-crypt the HD, once its been encrypted. The command-line equivalent is fdesetup, and on consulting its man page, I could not see the equivalent in its switches/options. Maybe I'm not quite understanding the implications of the terminology used in the man page, but I could not see how to do it. Does anyone know if specifying Apple ID decryption can be done via fdesetup?\n\nA: fdesetup doesn't support that feature. You can use other options such as creating or rotating a personal and/or institutional recovery keys but you can't store your recovery key with Apple using the command line.\n", "Q: Setup my new Mac I just bought a MacBook Pro and it's a beauty.

I use windows and macbook both. The problem is, plugging and unplugging from Mac is very much pain. If I accidentally remove it without 'ejecting', Mac doesn't recognise is next time I plug in. This is a very irritating problem and it keeps coming. Sometimes, while moving laptop here and there, connection gets loose and hard drive gets unplugged without 'safely ejecting'. Windows only warns, but recognises it every time I plug it in. Please suggest a solution. I don't wanna do all commandline stuff to make it work each time.\n\nA: What do you want to use this drive for?

Using stock Terminal.app on El Capitan, the effort is to set up a shortcut in a sense, that upon press it would execute a specific command.\nConsulting man pages for bind command following steps have been taken but yielded no results.\nFirst approach was to place the setting inside ~/.inputrc file and let the login session do its work.

Ideally, I'd prefer to recover the missing space from disk0s2 and merge it into disk0s4.\n\nA: The problem has finally been resolved... I went into Internet Recovery (but normal Recovery will do as well) and \"reactive\" the partition with Disk Utility. The old version of Disk Utility that is used when in Recovery mode allows to do this whereas the new version in System Preferences has pretty limited functions.\nBasically, the partition had just disappeared before... When using the command sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0 I had 4 partitions, but one without any identifier.

However, I do not hear any weird noises from the drive, and Disk Utility results seem OK.\nThe system has, of course, experienced increased demands since purchase. Besides running a more modern OS, I also make heavy use of Dropbox whose initial boot indexing process requires a lot of work for the drive; and I also have a Time Machine that is frequently backing up lots of media. Spotlight and Alfred also seem to weigh down a bit some time after system startup, as well as antivirus programs I have had installed (not at the same time) such as Avast and Sophos Antivirus.\nOn the other hand, I can't see that these applications are always active when I encounter drive performance issues.\nIs this drive performance to be expected with a five-year old HDD drive given these demands – or do the performance inconsistencies signal hardware problems?\n\nA: Before even looking at anything else...\nTwo antivirus apps on one machine is not good; they fight each other.\nAvast is also known to be cripplingly slow, with Sophos not faring much better.\nAV-TEST is the closest to an actual 'authority' on the subject.

This just blew my mind. Take for example Medieval II: Total war. \nRequirement for windows: 512 Mb RAM + 11 Gb free space on hard disk + 128 Mb GPU\nRequirement for mac: 4 Gb RAM + 32 Gb of free space on hard disk + 256 / 512 MB GPU\nHow come the requirements are so much higher? In particular the size of the games, it's more than double the Windows version! What is going on?\n\nA: The problem is you are looking at a game, Medieval II: Total War, that was released for Windows in November 2006 (last patch released in 2007 as far as I can tell) and for OS X in January 2016. The Windows version runs on 2000/XP (Windows 2000 was originally released in 1999), whereas the minimum for Mac is OS X 10.10.5, which came out a bit under two years ago. In other words, the game was ported to Mac very recently and therefore requires a modern computer to run it. I am not sure why the disk storage requirement is so much higher; I suspect it's either a typo or the assets in the Mac version have been significantly enhanced.\nIf you compare Total War: Rome 2, another game in the same series but one that was only released a year apart on the two OSes, you will see system requirements that are much more similar. In fact, the Mac version actually requires less hard drive space. It does require more RAM, but I would guess that's more to do with the underlying OS than anything else.\nI looked at some of the games in my Steam library to further confirm that system requirements are not inherently higher for games on Mac. SOMA actually has identical requirements for the two OSes. Marvel Heroes 2016 is very similar for both. The Witcher: Enhanced Edition has slightly higher requirements for Mac than Windows, especially in RAM, but again it runs on much older Windows OSes (XP) than OS X (10.8 minimum). Team Fortress 2 has nearly identical requirements.\nUltimately it comes down to several things: release time frame (again, comparing a game that came out in 2006 with a port that came out in 2016 is not going to yield similar results); the skill set of the developers involved (a studio who may not be as familiar with Mac may not be able to optimize a game as well as one who is, e.g. Aspyr); whether the game is wrapped in an emulation layer (such as Cider or Wine, which some large publishers do as an alternative to having a company like Aspyr port the game to a native Mac version); and ultimately, how much the publisher cares about the quality of the game and spends time (and of course money) optimizing the game for the target platform.\n\nA: There are two types of games for OSX: native apps (games that are actually made for mac, these run great) and ports from windows. The second kind use special tools to make the games originally written for windows run on mac. One example is Aspyr (https://www.aspyr.com). The Problem with these ports is, that the game was never designed to run on mac and so does run very poorly after the port. This results in much higher system requirements.\nEven worse, some developers just stick their game into an emulator like wine, which is pretty unstable and messy. Wine can be a good way to run games on mac in some cased and under certain circumstances, so maybe your desired game fits these criterias. Since Wine is free you might want to have a look at: https://appdb.winehq.org for your game and see how it performs.\n", "Q: Setting maximum number of running processes I've got program that create N processes, where N is input argument given in command line.

(multiple Apple IDs connected) I recently bought a new iphone se 64gb. I turned it on, signed in to my icloud account and selected my previous iphone's backup from icloud. After this, a screen displayed a message: Setting up your apple id. The screen after this message, displayed a prompt for password of an unknown email account that I have never used or known! This prompt suggested me to :\nEnter the Apple ID password for unknown_email to use for store purchases (including the App Store, Itunes Store and iBooks Store).\nI clicked the back button and switched off my new iphone se. Contacted apple via email, chat and telephone and even went to an apple store. Over telephone I was suggested to setup as a new phone and then reset it completely and then try the backup option again... the problem was still there. After that I was suggested to restore it via itunes. I updated it and restored it via itunes, and still the problem remained. \nI had bought this iphone via Amazon India and I tried returning this iphone via the amazon website and was told to contact the apple support number for returns. \nPlease could anyone recommend me what I should do?\n\nA: I remembered I had this issue when I was restoring an iPhone 5s backup to the iPhone 6 I bought at launch in 2014. I had a string of unknown email addresses pop-up asking for passwords to enable store purchases. Obviously the phone could not have been used or stolen as I received it on launch day directly from Apple.\nThe issue is that content originally purchased from an iTunes store was obtained from other people and on your prior device at the time of backup, such as music, eBooks or videos.\nIn turn, when you make a backup of your device, for purchased content iTunes/iCloud doesn't store the content directly in the backup. It simply logs (essentially) the content ID and the account used to purchase it. When you restore a backup, it prompts you to login to each account that the backup knows about so it can re-download the purchased content.\nIf you bypass that password screen for the unknown email, you will simply get an error message stating:\nSome items could not be downloaded. If they are on your computer, you can restore them by syncing with iTunes.\nAfter the restore is completed, sync with iTunes to add the content back directly from your computer.\nThe device is not stolen or compromised, nor is your Apple ID.\n\nA: Activation Lock would explain your inability to set up a phone new to you:\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201365\nIn it there is a section on what to do before paying for a device:\n\n*\n\n*https://icloud.com/activationlock\nWhat you do depends on the serial number / lock status of your device.\n\nWhat if I purchase a device that is still linked to the previous owner's account?\nContact the previous owner as soon as possible and ask them to erase the device and remove it from their account. Learn how to remove a device from a previous owner's account.\n\nIf yours is locked or the sale didn't clearly indicate you were buying a locked/disabled iPhone, save a printout of the lock status report page and contact the seller to arrange a refund of your money.\n\nIf yours is not locked then Amazon is correct. You'll need to work out your Apple ID.\nErase the device and set up as new. When you sign in to iCloud make sure you can get to the app store and download a free app with the AppleID you use. If you are part of a family plan - look that over to get a list of all the AppleID you expect to be attached to any purchases in your backup.\nThen erase the phone and repeat the restore from backup. All the extra AppleID are due to downloading an app from another AppleID - either when you signed in to a second ID to download an app or synced it via iTunes or it's a family purchased app.\nYou'll have to either get the password or cancel the install of each app that's not tied directly to your Apple ID.\n\nA: You only get this prompt after restoring from backup? Did you ever get it (or similar) when pushing updates before? If anyone installed an app into your phone, using another Apple ID, it would want that ID before updating that app. I used to see this when my wife updated her phone, and an app I had purchased was installed (before Family Sharing, that is).\n", "Q: Chromecast receiver for OSX Is there a working Chromecast receiver for OSX. ie I could send audio or video from a phone or another PC to stream on there laptop?\nI know there were some experiments previously, but not sure anything is working now.\n\nA: Several options include:\n\n*\n\n*Reflector 2\n\n*AirServer Universal\nAnd if you feel brave and are able to compile Python, LeapCast may be an option.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: El Capitan - Losing internet connection every 20/30 minutes MBP Early 2015 keep losing internet connection!

There's an app called UTM that I've recently been working with and have been quite surprised by what I've been able to do on my iPad Pro 11 2nd Gen.\nThe app does NOT require jailbreaking.  In iOS 11-13, it just needs to be side-loaded since it isn't an appstore app (not surprising).  On iOS 14, Apple patched the trick that was used to get JIT working. As a result, the next best workaround is significantly more involved.  You can find those instructions here. But even then, you still do not need to jailbreak the device.  As to why it isn't just in the appstore, according to the developers of UTM:\n\nApple does not permit any apps that have interpreted or generated code therefore it is unlikely that UTM will ever be allowed. However, there are various ways people on the internet have come up to sideload apps without requiring a jailbreak. We do not condone or support any of these methods.\n\nThis is just doing the exact same thing that Docker Desktop does for multi-arch images for Windows and Mac OS - utilizing LinuxKit, buildx and qemu.  It is Open Source, however, so you can view the code to ensure it's safe and build out the app yourself.  The site for the app is getutm.app.  The source is on GitHub in utmapp/UTM.\nThe readme in the repository as well as the info on the site are detailed and easy to follow. There are multiple prebuilt VMs available here for several different Linux versions:\n\n*\n\n*Arch Linux ARM\n\n*Debian 10.4 (osy's developer edition) ARM\n\n*Debian 10.4 (LDXE) ARM\n\n*Debian 10.4 (Xfce) ARM\n\n*Debian 10.4 (minimal) ARM\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04\n\n*Ubuntu 18.04\n\nThere are also prebuilt images for Android(v2.2, v4.4 and v9.0) as well as ReactOS(v0.4.14), but this is specific to Docker, so the Linux versions are what I'm concentrating on.\nOnce you've installed UTM and then added your Linux machine (prebuilt or by creating your own image - details in the readme.md file in the repository above) just follow the instructions here\nI assume, however, that it won't be long before there is a Docker Desktop release for iOS, as it's just a build with the XCode debugger attached (same as for MacOS).  since Docker Desktop is available for Windows and Mac, however, you could just use a windows vm (Windows 10 for ARM actually runs well, considering.  And it isn't just Windows RT ask over again!  This is a FULL Windows 10 install that can run x86, ARM32 and ARM64 apps.) inside the UTM app running Windows 10 for ARM and the Docker Desktop for Windows and that way not only is Docket availabke within the iOS device, but you would be able too build out different images from there as well as do your docker build and deployment from inside it as well.  But, if you're more comfortable on Linux, this is how you'd do it.  Hopefully this will help someone.\n\nA: Docker is an automation tool, which facilitates deployment of applications using Linux feature called Linux Containers. Docker provides neither virtualization nor emulation environments. As of today, running Docker containers requires using Linux (support for other operating systems, like Oracle Solaris and Windows Server is in the development phase).\nDocker for Mac and Docker for Windows are separate products that run a Linux virtual machine inside the host OS and provision containers inside that machine.\nThere is no way of running a Linux virtual machine in iOS, hence iOS cannot be a \"host for Docker\".\nBesides operating system, even if you ran Linux on iOS, you would need to also consider the CPU (that is also true for Raspberry Pi recommended in the comments under the other answer). Most available Docker images use binary packages for Intel/AMD architecture, not ARM limiting the use cases compared to running it on MacBook.\n\nA: iOS would be an extremely poor choice for docker use. Setting aside that code needs to be signed to run on iOS, these general design considerations raise problems to implement docker on iOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apps don't run in background\n\n*memory is severely constrained\n\n*CPU is constrained\n\n*power is constrained\n\n\nThe iOS design makes running persistent server tasks difficult and in the end, wouldn't it make sense to run docker on a swarm of networked raspberry pi and just orchestrate the setup and configuration from iOS?\nFor that I run prompt and ssh into Linux or Mac hosts to set up docker instances and control them. \n\nA: As of iOS 13, the operating system specifically disabled creating executable regions of memory and launching sub-processes for 3rd party applications. This makes applications like Docker somewhat technically impossible.\nUnless the solution requires jailbreaking, which in turn fragile and creates other security risks.\n", "Q: Core dumps have been disabled. To enable core dumping, try \"ulimit -c unlimited\" before starting Java again When I play Minecraft, usually on servers, my game constantly crashes, and the reason for this is: 'Core dumps have been disabled. To enable core dumping, try \"ulimit -c unlimited\" before starting Java again!'\nI am running on OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.5\nI am running on Minecraft 1.8\nI have contacted Minecraft support, and they didn't help me at all, but I soon noticed that Java was the issue.\nI know that typing ulimit -c unlimited would be a temporary fix until the next time I run the game, but is there a way that I could make a permanent fix. I'm looking to fix my crashing issue. I'm looking for any clue that may help fix this issue.\n\n\nA: First of all the crashes aren't caused by the core dumps. Very basically a core dump is just the system dumping all the data that an application has in memory into a file AFTER an application has crashed. To help developers try to diagnose the cause of a crash. The error \"Core dumps have been disabled. To enable core dumping, try \"ulimit -c unlimited\" before starting Java again\" is just telling you that it wasn't able to gather this data.\nThe actual crash in this case appears to have been caused by one of the mods you have installed. The important part of the crash report is these first few lines...\nDescription: WDL mod: exception in onWorldRemoveEntityFromWorld event\n\njava.lang.null.NullPointerException: WDL mod: exception in onWorldRemoveEntityFromWorld event\n                    at wdl.WDLHooks.onWorldRemoveEntityFromWorld(WDLHooks.java:153)\n                    at wdl.litemod.LiteModWDL.worldClientRemoveEntityFromWorld(LiteModWDL.java:104)\n                    at com.mumfrey.liteloader.core.event.EventProxy.$event0000d(EventProxy.java:224)\n\nUnfortunately there isn't enough information here to tell us which mod.\nFirst thing I'd recommend is making sure you have Minecraft and all your mods up to date. If that doesn't solve the problem, then I'd recommend removing each mod one by one and playing a bit each time. Then when the crashes stop you know which mod was the cause. Process of elimination.\n\nA: I found the problem in java runtime version, I made the necessary update from https://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572?locale=en_US And start the Android SDK successfully \n", "Q: Install Win10 x64 on MacBook Pro mid 2011 with Boot Camp I have to install Win 10 onto my mid 2011 MacBook Pro (El Capitan) using Boot Camp.\nI have two SSD on my machine (one was switched with the SuperDrive) and they works greatly normally.\nThis morning I woken up and I wanted to install Win 10 onto one of my SSDs. I use yet VirtualBox and tried also Parallel Desktop. But today I want to use Boot Camp.\nThe situation is:\n\n\n*\n\n*my Mac doesn't support USB boot to install Win\n\n*I have already installed the drivers (via Boot Camp) on a pen drive\n\n*I have a beautiful DVD RW (that I burned at least 6 times only today)\n\n*I can use the Superdrive externally\n\n*I don't know how to burn correctly the Win10.iso\n\n\nStep 5.: why?\nBecause Boot Camp doesn't recognize the Win10 DVD (message: \"The installer disc could not be found\"). I tried many DVD burning formats such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*HFS+ (okay, this option failed obviously, t's my fault: it's an Apple format)\n\n*DVD UTF\n\n*PC (Joliet)\n\n*ISO9660\n\n*Joliet 103 characters (solo)\n\n\nusing Burn.\nI tried also to burn the ISO via El Capitan's Disk Utility. Same error.\nThe destination disk is correctly formatted Ex FAT Master Boot Record.\nI don't know to do.\n\nUPDATE\n\nI noticed that the error message The installer disc could not be found was referring to the USB Boot Camp Drivers.\nSo, it was not a DVD problem. I didn't plug the USB drive with the drivers. My fault. Now I plugged both Superdrive and the USB with the drivers. \nFinally Boot Camp Assistant now is happy and left me to continue. After click Continue the Mac rebooted automatically, but... I seen a black screen with a intermittent underscore at top left of the screen (this is a little good sign: it was the Windows boot).\nBut the BIOS (?) seems to be locked, no messages, no alert, nothing... only this intermittent underscore. I waited 15 - 20 minutes and nothing changed. I tried to press Enter, Space without any result. So I have to reboot the machine.\nFrom the Mac OS X partition I can see:\n\nSo I think the DVD results bootable.\nWhat could be the problem now? :(\n\nA: The correct way to burn the Windows iso file to a DVD using El Capitan would be to do the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the iso file in the Finder.\n\n*Right click on the file and select Burn Disk Image \"File name\" to\nDisc....\n\n*Follow the instructions given in the pop up window.\n\n\nIf the Boot Camp Assistant application will not recognize the external DVD drive, then you can try the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Insert the burned DVD in the external DVD drive.\n\n*Restart type Mac and hold down the option key.\n\n*See if the DVD icon appears with the label \"Windows\" in the Startup\nManager.\n\n*Select the icon and see if you can boot from the DVD.\n\n\nIf you can boot from the DVD, you probably can use the external DVD drive to install Windows. First, you will need to create a MSDOS (FAT) formatted partition to install Window on to. This usually is the 4th partition on the drive.\nIf you can not boot from the external DVD drive, the one possible option would be to install directly from the Windows iso file. See web sites here and here for some examples of how to do this.\nBy the way, how did you acquire the Boot Camp Support Software? Did you use the Boot Camp Assistant to download or did you download from a web site?\n\nA: According to Apple the earliest MacBook Pro that supports Windows 10 is the Mid 2012. Which means that Apple does not officially support Windows 10 on your computer.\nHowever I have heard (oh... here and there.) that you can often get Win 10 installed by installing the latest supported Windows OS, which in your case is Window 8.1. And then upgrading to 10 within Windows 8.1 itself.\nDo remember though that some drivers may not work, so some devices may not work or work well. note that people have had success updating/installing drivers from the manufacturers website (video, audio, etc.) after sleuthing out the make and model that Apple used in their system, rather than using Apple provided drivers from Boot Camp.\n\nA: The problem is hardware.\nAfter many frustrating tentatives finally I installed successfully Win via Boot Camp.\nHow?\nFirst, my MacBook Pro 2011 doesn't supports DVD booting form any external drive, this due to EFI firmware and some hardware.\nSo my situation was:\n\n\n*\n\n*on my Mac I have SSD 1 500GB with El Capitan and SSD 2 250GB empty, future location of Win\n\n*install El Capitan on SSD 2 (to use Boot Camp) in a smallest partition possible (30GB El Capitan + 220GB empty)\n\n*open the Unibody  \n\n*unplug both SSD drives \n\n*restore the Superdrive in his proper slot\n\n*put the SSD 2 in the SDD proper slot\n\n*left SDD 1 outside the Mac for a moment\n\n*remount the unibody\n\n*boot the Mac with the new El Capitan (from the 30GB partition of SSD 2)\n\n*follow the standard Bootcamp procedures to install Windows (all versions are OK, I tried Win 7, Win 8 and Win 10, all them worked) in the 220GB partition on SSD 2\n\n*open the unibody\n\n*unplug the Superdrive\n\n*put the SSD 2 in the Superdrive slot (with the proper adapter)\n\n*put the SDD 1 in the HDD slot (with the 2.5 inches adapter)\n\n*the end\n\n\nPRO:\nA. Now Mac boots magnificently both from Win 10 and El Capitan.\nCONS:\nA. Installation very long and boring\nB. Bad partition situation\n\n\n*\n\n*SDD 1 500GB with my Old El Capitan\n\n*SSD 2 250GB partitioned as follows:\n2.a) 30GB partition with a new El Capitan\n2.b) 220GB partition with Win 10\n", "Q: What is the equivalent of ipconfig/displaydns (and flushdns) in OS X? I need to find how to display my DNS cache on the mac. I have tried \nmulti Google searches but failed to come up with a good solution. \nThe best I found was how to remove the cache with the command \nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder which is great but I need to see the cache to see if the change works.\n\nA: As @PrasseethaKR and @kjagiello point out, on High Siera mDNSResponer has moved from syslog to log function. In addition, your DNS lookups are now considered private and will show as such in both Console and log stream.\nTo view your DNS lookups in real time on High Sierra open an Terminal and run:\nsudo log config --mode \"private_data:on\"\nlog stream --predicate 'process == \"mDNSResponder\"' --info\n\nTo go back to using private just run the following command.\nsudo log config --mode \"private_data:off\"\n\nAFAIK you cannot view the contents of old private messages, only messages logged with private_data:on can appear. To view your entire history use the show command  Because it can return a large amount of data I also use --last to limit the data, e.g. the last 2 hours would be...\nlog show --last 2h --predicate 'process == \"mDNSResponder\"' --info\n\nCheers!\n\nA: To see the DNS cache, you can use the following command in Terminal to dump a snapshot summary of the internal state of mDNSResponder to /var/log/system.log:\nsudo killall -INFO mDNSResponder\n\nThen to review, you can either use Console and filter using mDNSResponder or since Terminal is already handy just use:\ngrep mDNSResponder /var/log/system.log\n\nTo flush the DNS cache, use the following command:\nsudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n\n", "Q: Can you work with Vim on iPad Mini with an external keyboard? I'm considering to buy an iPad Mini and use it -- among other things -- for programming using Vim. I would connect via SSH to a Digital Ocean server and start Vim there. I would use an external (physical) keyboard when working with Vim.\nWhich app should I use on the iPad to get the best VIM experience over SSH and which issues (e.g. due to keyboard layout) I have to expect?\nPS: Note that I don't intend to use the iOS port of Vim.\n\nA: I use Prompt 2 to connect over SSH to my server. It's a paid app, but I never had an issue with it, it's really reliable. If your connection is good enough you won't appreciate any lag. Vim works great with it.\nCan't tell you about external keyboards.\n\nA: I recently bought Ipad Mini 5th for same purporses, I'm still not sure about about this idea at all, but ssh/mosh works really well using \"Blink\" app, git can be used directly throught \"Working Copy\" app, vim works smoothly throught mosh, also there is theme supporting, and different fonts for terminal, also I found app \"Dash\" usefull for documentations, and \"HTTPBot\", for debugging REST (or any others) APIs. Hope it'll helps someone who want to try this idea.\nP.S I'm not sure about size of screen and development workflow using just one port (if it's lightning, not a usb-c)...so you have to think twice before implementing something like this.\n\nA: Have used Reflection for years. It's a breeze to work with, and feels lightweight while using it, but there is much power behind the app (plus, it's free) \nAnother option is Serverauditor, I frown upon it because of in-app purchases, but it is a solid app. \n", "Q: How do I measure the performance impact of antivirus applications? I'm evaluating Antivirus software suites for my Mac, and would like to measure the performance impact they have on my computer.\nI am not looking to do a expert-level thorough examination, but rather get a crude measure with some snapshot data points (or time-series data if possible).\n\n\n*\n\n*What are the main metrics I should monitor? I'm thinking about the application's CPU usage – but is there anything else?\n\n*Is there a user-friendly way to do this (using an application or Terminal tool)?\n\n\nIf there is a general answer that applies to measuring any type of application, perhaps the question title should be changed to “how to measure the performance impact of MacOS applications”.\n\nNote: There are of course a few AV comparison sites out there. But I've been slightly perplexed when looking at their results. For instance, one year ESET Cybersecurity Pro gets a top score in the performance department, but the next year it scores much lower and the article will say that it's a drag on the computer. I gather that one way to find out what works is to test them yourself.\n\nA: AV-TEST state that their method is to use a large number of files & record the time taken to download, then repeat using each antivirus & see how much it slows down.\n\nPartly disappointing system loads \nFor the load test of the security packages, 839 files, representing a\n  volume of 30.6 GB, were copied on a reference system, and many\n  downloads were performed. The time needed for these tasks served as\n  the reference value in the test. As soon as a protection solution was\n  installed, it was required to complete the same tasks. The relevant\n  times required are listed in the latest test chart. The results,\n  however, could not be more diverse. The reference time was 246\n  seconds. As already mentioned, the packages from Bitdefender and ESET,\n  with 249 and 253 seconds, hardly put the brakes on the system. The\n  other values from Symantec, Canimaan Software, Kaspersky and AVG are\n  good up to the clocked 268 seconds, however they're not great. But\n  after Sophos with 284 seconds, the values continue to increase\n  significantly: from 292 to 466 for Avast. The nearly unbelievable\n  value of 1387 seconds was measured for Dr. Web. That is more than 5.6\n  times the reference value.\n\n[the referenced chart]\n\nIn my own, less than scientific tests, I could feel the slowdown using Sophos or Avast, long before I read about them on the AV-TEST site.\nRegarding system load, they appear to be less specific. One can only imagine they are looking at Activity Monitor, but there's no direct information, only the rather vague\n\nThe two charts with the test results quickly reveal that the\n  protection solutions from Bitdefender and ESET, despite 100% detection\n  rate, cause little or no burden on the system. They require for their\n  own performance a mere 1 to 2% of system resources. Most of the other\n  solutions in fact require up to 10% system resources for security\n  performance, in some cases even m ore.\n\n", "Q: Timemachine - Turn off \"No Backup for X Days\" for secondary Disk On my MacBook Air I use TimeMachine with two USB-Disks. (Latest El Capitan)\nMy primary disk is located at my house, the secondary at my parent's house.\nAs I am not always at my parents, this \"No Backup for X Days\" pops up daily:\n\nDoes anybody know a way, how I can disable the notification for the secondary disk while leaving the notification for the primary disk?\nThanks\n\nA: Since the backup volume is offsite, you can simply remove it from the list in Time Machine settings whilst it's away from home. When you add it back, Time Machine will pick up the existing backup. That's what I always do myself.\nAs for performance, the first backup after adding the volume back has a longer preparation step (presumably for computing the diffs) but that also happens anyway after a few weeks when Time Machine stops maintaining the diffs as changes on the file system occur in real time.\n", "Q: Airdrop not working in mac ( OSX 10.11.6 El Capitan ) with iPhone 6s (iOS 9.3.5) Problem:\nAirdrop is not working in Macbook pro 2015 model ( OSX 10.11.6 El Capitan ) with iPhone 6s (iOS 9.3.5). Both OS are latest updated. \nNote: Tried mac connecting with two iphones (6 ans 6s). Although both iphones are able to connect with each other using Airdrop\nWhen I open Airdrop in finder window in Mac it is not showing me my iPhone.\nAlso when i try to share some image in iPhone then it doesn't show me mac in Airdrop.\nSteps Tried :-\nI have set airdrop settings to Everyone.\nAlso bluetooth and wifi are working perfect on both the devices.\nIn firewall also nothing is blocked. Even tried with firewall disabled.\nAlso tested in safe mode and test user but not working.\nAlso tested with icloud signed out but that also not worked.\nShould i reinstall the Mac OS X again? Any suggestions.\n\nA: I would not expect AirDrop to work in SafeMode as most kernel extensions and features are hobbled / disabled. I also wouldn't reinstall unless you feel that's needed for another issue.\nI don't see a good troubleshooting article from Apple - but this has some hints: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203106\nSpecifically - when you have hotspot enabled on iOS - AriDrop doesn't work.\nAdditionally, if you have any internet security, firewall, vpn software installed, that can cause problems on the Mac side.\nThe initial discovery of devices happens over bluetooth - so if you don't see other devices - look for bluetooth interference or issues with that hardware. If you see the other device, but the transfer is slow or fails, you can track that on the Mac side:\nnetstat -nr | grep awdl0\n\nThat will show all the IPv6 network connections and you can run sudo tcpdump -i awdl0 to trace the network traffic that is used to transfer files over AirDrop.\nYou are on the right track - powering off bluetooth and wifi, restarting both devices, powering on bluetooth and WiFi and then retesting. Worst case, you need a third device to see which of the two works with another device that you know works with AirDrop.\nIf that doesn't work - look at this answer on the thread below for more in-depth tools to debug AirDrop using graphical tools and the command line:\n\n\n*\n\n*Debug AirDrop between MacBook Pro and iPhone 6s Plus\n", "Q: One certain person can't hear me when I call. I have an iPhone SE and when I tried calling my\nBoyfriend, he couldn't hear me. I called my\nMom to see if it would happen but she COULD hear me. I could hear him clearly. This has never happened before and we've called multiple times. Why can he specifically not hear me? He used his phone earlier and was able to hear other people. What should I do to fix this?\n\nA: First, just try again, make sure it wasn't just a glitch.\nThen, to fully test...  \nReboot all 3 phones, yours, boyfriend's, mom's.  \nRing each person to test - that's 6 phone calls - you to mom, mom to you, you to boyfriend, boyfriend to you, mom to boyfriend, boyfriend to mom.\nThat last couple might feel odd, depending on how well they know each other, but it's the only solid test to see if it is specifically just an issue between you & your boyfriend.\nIf only one/two of those tests fails [the expected ones], the next test would involve each person travelling far enough that they are certain to be using a different phone mast & repeat the process.\n\nA: I've had something similar with an Iphone 6s. Some people could barely hear me, had to turn on the speaker, while others could hear me just fine.\nWhen something else broke, I've send it back for warranty and at Apply they acknowledged the problem(s) and I received a new one (because It could not be fixed).

On Windows, VLC's playback speed can be discovered on status bar, but the Mac version doesn't have a status bar. Where should I go to see the current playback speed?\n\nA: On the Mac version of VLC, to see the playback speed, you have to click the Playback menu. It won't be shown on the default window.\n\n\n\n\nA: You can also setup the OnScreenDisplay which will display playback speed changes, step forwards, step backwards and other changes during playback.\nGo to VLC -> Preferences -> Subtitles/OSD -> Enable OSD.\nSave settings and quit the vlc app so settings get applied.\n", "Q: iTunes Wi-Fi Sync, copy photos from iPad to PC? I want to copy photos from iPad to PC (iTunes). On iTunes, I click the iPad icon, and then click \"Photos\" from the left panel. It shows \"Sync Photos\" on the right. But the problem is that when I click the Sync button, the pictures on the iPhone are not copied to the PC. Only the reverse was true (PC -> iPad).\nDoesn't Apple support copying photos from iPad to PC? Or did I do something wrong? How can I copy photos from iPad to a PC on the same home network wirelessly?\nIf possible, I do not want to use the USB cable, because it is cumbersome than Wi-Fi Sync. I do not want to use iCloud as a middle man (iPad -> iCloud -> my PC) either, because I know a lot of people's pictures were leaked through iCloud.\n\nA: iTunes can't download pictures from iOS devices to your computer, not even when connected via USB. The sync option allows you to upload pictures from a selected folder from your computer to the device.\nOn Windows, you can use the system camera import option –some methods on how to enable it if it's not working are described here–, Windows Live Photo Gallery, Photos app on windows 8 and 10, and a long list of apps; all of them require you to plug your device to your computer.\nThere appear to exist pure wireless alternatives, one called \"Wifi Photo Transfer\" - link to CNET review; and \"Wifi Transfer App\" - link to the App Store; look at the \"Customers Also Bought\" section as there appear to be a lot of apps that do what you want. I haven't tried any of them.\nIf you'd rather never worry about manually syncing, and don't want to use iCloud Photo Library marvelous service, that even takes care of reducing the space used by your pictures, I suggest you try Dropbox that does what you want –via internet though, and if you either have bad passwords, reuse them, or, god forbid, Dropbox passwords are leaked or stolen and you don't react quickly you may be in trouble. Google has another alternative, closer to iCloud Photo Library in functionality, but you'll have to install Google Drive on your PC and activate the Photos folder inside Drive in order to have a hard copy on your computer. Also, depending on your settings and how many pictures you have, you may have to pay with Google or Dropbox (and iCloud as well).\nLastly, you may enable My Photo Stream, which in my opinion is very complicated but it automatically copies your pictures (via iCloud) to your computer; if iCloud Photo library is off there is no way to view your pictures online thus your fear of your pictures leaking is at least minimized because a third person looking to steal your pictures will have to set up a device with your iCloud credentials in order to retrieve said pictures, and it will alert you of that event on all signed in machines.\nYou can also add Two-factor or two-step authentication to your device if you are worried about your privacy.\n", "Q: Will a EVGA GeForce GTX 750 Ti Graphics Card plug n play with Mac Pro 2009? Upgrading my Mac Pro early 2009 - MacPro4,1 running OS 10.6.8, looking at GeForce GTX 750 Ti Graphics Card and wanted to make sure it would plug n play?\n\nA: While your Mac Pro does have a PCI-e slot, it is only type 2.0, x16 width meaning that the GTX750 will not run at its maximum capability.\nAdditionally, recent Nvidia CUDA drivers for OS X do not support 10.6.8, meaning you would likely need to upgrade your OS to at least Mountain Lion (10.8) or greater.\nSo, no, it seems unlikely that your proposed card would work as \"plug and play.\"  This site may be of use:\nhttp://www.macvidcards.com/drivers.html\n", "Q: How do I extract X.509 certificates embedded in executables? This should be very simple, but I am unable to find a straightforward answer to this question. I have a few Mach-O binaries that have certificates embedded in them. Some of these might not be signatures, but rather root certificates that the code uses to verify other signatures with. Some of these might also be signatures. I'm working on some of Apple's core executables here, so that might help. How can I extract these from them?\n\nA: Apple's root certificates are available via Keychain.app in the System keychain. Both expending too much effort, confirm the certificates you are trying to extract truly differ from those in the System keychain.\nBe sure to review Apple's published source code for their tools, code signing, and signature verification at https://opensource.apple.com or ask on the Apple cryptography mailing list to chat directly with Apple's security engineers.\nMach-O Maybe?\nAssuming the embedded certificates are stored in a data segment of the Mach-O files, see the article Parsing Mach-O files for details about how to access this content.\nThe open source tool MachOView will probably provide enough insight to judge if the certificate is encoded as a Mach-O segment.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use a Mac's USB ports remotely through VNC/Remote Desktop? A little background: my organization, a hospital, is in the process of rolling out more iOS devices throughout the enterprise and we are provisioning them through Apple Configurator (w/ Cisco Meraki MDM) which has been working well so far.\nHowever, this is mostly a PC shop and there's only one Mac computer for the device provisioning as of right now, so the question was brought to me if there was a way that we could host a Mac server in our data center and have the USB ports \"redirect\" so to speak from the local machine to the Mac server in order to provision these iOS devices without having to p-card multiple Mac computers?\n\nA: No, pretty sure you won't be able to use a Mac server and then connect iOS devices to PCs and prepare them using Configurator remotely. You can add more USB ports using a hub to increase the number you can connect simultaneously.\n", "Q: If I change my computer name how does it affect my computer's paths? I wanted to change my computer's name and did so.  I used it for a while but when doing other programming related work felt like I was hitting a wall sometimes because of pathing.  \nI changed terminal name by executing a command line command and did the rest through Users in System Settings inside of Advanced Settings that you can access by pressing control and clicking on the User.  \nEx. starting up a MySQL server/accessing MySQL command line tools/Python or php acting up.\nCan changing my computer's name result in this kind of affect?\n\nA: Not sure what you mean- you can't change the computer name in the Users & Groups pref pane, you do that in the Sharing pref pane.

So, the time has come to replace my mid-2012 MacBook Pro.  When I purchased this laptop four years ago I paid extra for the 1TB internal drive upgrade; a couple of years later I upgraded again to a 2TB internal drive.  Now I am looking for a newer laptop, and I am frustrated to find that there seems to be no way to get anywhere close to that kind of storage in a newer (post-2013) MBP.  The largest size SSD I can find is a 1TB upgrade, and that is prohibitively expensive.\nI know people love the SSDs because they are faster, smaller and lighter.  But surely I am not the only user who values capacity over speed -- right?  What do people do if they need more storage with the newer laptops?\n(I recognize that the only real answers may just be \"Don't buy a newer laptop\"  or \"Wait for Moore's Law to catch up with your needs.\"  I'd prefer a more practical solution.)\nEdited:  Regarding \"Wait for Moore's Law to catch up with your needs\", it looks like that may be happening already, as SanDisk has just announced (September 20, 2016) a prototype 1 TB SD card:  http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/20/12986234/biggest-sd-card-1-terabyte-sandisk.\n\nA: The wireless networking on Apple hardware is really as fast as spinning hard drives can shove data so there's not much benefit to putting large storage in a device as I see it.\nWe run the MacBook pro in places where an iMac used to be needed with iSCSI initiators to connect to SAN, AFP and SMB shares to file servers, thunderbolt and USB 3.0 access to drives.\nIf you benchmark the speed of the SSD in that hardware, you'll see why it's so pricey. If you think of that as fast cache - high speed storage premium tier and then look at your workload - you can think about how you can place low access speed requirements and long term storage elsewhere and let the system cache the files needed locally.\nApple is going that way for iCloud, Photos, iTunes - having a large library and letting the system go out to the cloud as needed to retrieve files. If that change doesn't arrive at a pace you like or you really need to bring several TB of storage with you - there are great options with thunderbolt and USB 3 as well as networked storage to fit many sizes and price points.\n", "Q: iCloud Apple ID uses old defunct email After updating my iPod I'm asked to enter the password for the iCloud account, which has an Apple ID which uses an older email which no longer exists. I don't remember the old password.\nIs there a way to update to my current Apple ID? I don't have access to the old email for verification. \nIf it's not possible I could live without it as I don't really use iCloud.\n\nA: AppleID is tied to purchases though. Are you using a NEW AppleID for the iPod? If so, use THAT login for iCloud. If not, just create a new ID with an email account you currently use. You'll lose access to purchases from the old ID, and any documents saved in the cloud though.\n", "Q: Reverting a CoreStorage Volume I broke an installation of Deep Freeze on a Macbook by upgrading it to El Capitan. I'd like to get Deep Freeze to work again, but \"This version of Deep Freeze cannot be installed on a Mac that has CoreStorage volume\". There are many guides to reverting a CoreStorage volume on the internet, but the steps aren't working for me.\nI open terminal and type \"diskutil cs list\" and get the list of volumes on the Macbook, the revertible area tells me \"Yes (no decryption required)\". When I type \"diskutil cs revert [logical volume UUID]\" I get the error \"The given UUID is not a valid CoreStorage Logical Volume UUID.

Appreciate any help regarding this.\n\nA: I ended up stumbling across the answer to my own questions (although David is right, I could have avoided it by following his steps).

Networks around me are either completely undetectable, or only one of them shows (not the one I own).\nMy Wireless card is an Airport Extreme BCM43xx. The ioreg -l | grep 14e4 command shows that the card is specifically 14e4:4328.\nIf it is a firmware problem, then is there any firmware I can install? I only know b43, which might be linux only. Note that wireless does not work in Recovery HD either.\n\nA: Try changing the channel of your WiFi router. Might fix confusion of the AirPort. To do, see the documentation for your router, for suggestions as to which channel you should choose, option-click the wifi button in the status bar, click Wireless Diagnostics, and then after the application opens, click window, and Scan. This will tell you the best channel to choose for your router.\n\nIf changing the channel doesn't fix the issue, try running the Apple Diagnostics Tool. \nOR\nIf your iMac is pre-2013, try the Apple Hardware Test after completing the steps above with the exception of the Diagnostics tool. \n", "Q: Results of find cannot be encapsulated in quotes On Linux, handling spaces when I am using the results find only requires wrapping the variable in quotes. This doesn't work on OS X. This code, for example, doesn't work:\nfor file in $(find . -name \"*.txt\")\ndo\n    ls -l \"${file}\"\ndone\n\nEven wrapped in quotes, parts of file names separated by spaces are treated as their own result. How do I fix this?\n\nA: From Bash Pitfalls (which also explains in detail why for file in (find ...); do doesn't work):\n\nWhen using find use it properly eg. use -exec\nfind . -type f -exec some command {} \\;\n\nInstead of ls consider,\nfor i in *.mp3; do    # Better! and...\n    some command \"$i\" # ...always double-quote expansions!\ndone\n\nPOSIX shells such as Bash have the globbing feature specifically for this purpose -- to allow the shell to expand patterns into a list of matching filenames. There is no need to interpret the results of an external utility. Because globbing is the very last expansion step, each match of the *.mp3 pattern correctly expands to a separate word, and isn't subject to the effects of an unquoted expansion. (If you need to process files recursively, see UsingFind.)\nQuestion: What happens if there are no *.mp3-files in the current directory? Then the for loop is executed once, with i=\"*.mp3\", which is not the expected behavior! The workaround is to test whether there is a matching file:\n# POSIX\nfor i in *.mp3; do\n    [ -e \"$i\" ] || continue\n    some command \"$i\"\ndone\n\nNote the quotes around $i in the loop body above.\n\n\nA: Your code doesn't work on OS X or Linux.\nfor file in $(find . -name \"*.txt\")\ndo\n    ls -l \"${file}\"\ndone\n\nFirst the shell performs the expansion of the command substitution $(find . -name \"*.txt\") The results resemble the following-\nfile with spaces\\nanother file with spaces and so on. Now, the shell performs word spitting based on the value of IFS- the internal field separator. The value is usually white space, tab, and newline.\nRun the following code:\nfor file in $(find . -name \"*.txt\")\ndo\n    echo \"${file}\"\ndone\n\nNow let's change the IFS to just the newline character.\nIFS='\n'\nfor file in $(find . -name \"*.txt\")\ndo\n    ls -l -- \"${file}\"\ndone\n\nYour code will work though I advise you not to change IFS and find alternate solutions.\nBoth GNU find and BSD find are very robust and can handle file names with spaces. You can avoid the loop and get similar results with one line\nfind . -name \"*.txt\" -ls\n\n", "Q: Disable password authentication for making inbound ssh connection only I have set Remote Login to \"on\" for my Mac OS X so that I can ssh into it from somewhere else.

I have multiple Safari windows for tab organization. I usually have multiple tabs in each window.\nWhen I click on a link from an app other than Safari, it opens the link in a new tab in Safari, as Safari is my default browser. \nThe problem is that it often opens in a Safari window that is currently minimized or that I am currently not using. So it doesn't open the link in my main, active, current window (basically the one I have used last). Instead, it chooses its own \"default window\" to open links in, which may be a window I'm not even using. \nHowever, I would like these links to always open in the window that I used last, and not in a window that I'm not using. Is it possible to make links always open in the last active window you used, or at least set the \"default\" window which will open new links?\nI am currently running macOS Sierra 10.12.1, with the default Safari version that comes with it. \n\nA: This can be done with an AppleScript app which opens the link in Safari and making this app the default browser.\nI've found two versions while testing: either open in new windows or in new tabs if there's already a window in the current space.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Script Editor.app (or even better Script Debugger)\n\n*If you want links to open in a new window use this\n    on open location theURL    \n        tell application \"Safari\"  \n            make new document with properties {URL:theURL}  \n            activate  \n        end tell  \n    end open location  \n\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want links to open in a new tab (if a window is available in the current space) use this:\n\n\n    on open location theURL  \n        tell application \"System Events\"  \n            tell process \"Safari\"  \n                try  \n                    set frontWinName to name of window 1 \n                on error  \n                    my openNewWindow(theURL)  \n                    return  \n                end try  \n            end tell  \n        end tell  \n\n        tell application \"Safari\"  \n            try  \n                tell (first window whose name is frontWinName and miniaturized is false)  \n                    set current tab to make new tab with properties {URL:theURL}  \n                    activate  \n                end tell  \n            on error  \n                my openNewWindow(theURL)  \n            end try  \n        end tell  \n    end open location  \n\n\n    on openNewWindow(theURL)  \n        tell application \"Safari\"  \n            make new document with properties {URL:theURL}  \n            activate  \n        end tell  \n    end openNewWindow  \n\n\n\n*\n\n*Save as app\n\n*If you don't want the app shown in dock\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click the app, go into the package and find Info.plist \n\n*Add this in Info.plist\n    <key>LSUIElement</key>  \n    <true/>\n\n\n*Set the app as default browser (I used RCDefaultApp).\nIf you want to see how annoying the default macOS link behaviour is I suggest switching back to Safari as default browser after some hours ...\nI'm still on 10.14.6 and don't know possible restrictions in Catalina. \n\nA: As a developer I researched the possibility of extensions being able to achieve what you want by always opening a new window when clicking a link contained outside of Safari itself. I'm sorry to say I don't think this approach is going to be possible.\nUnfortunately, Safari does not give extensions a way to determine the origin of a new tab/window. What I mean by this is that a new tab can be created because the user clicks a link in an email, command-clicks a link in Safari, opens a Safari bookmark while holding down Command, clicks a link within a PDF document, or any one of several other actions that will open a page in a new tab. Regardless of the method, Safari does not provide how the window was opened to a Safari extension.\nSince all these events look the same, no extension can force links from outside Safari to open in new windows without also affecting links opened in other ways (including while browsing within Safari).\n\nA: Although it doesn't natively open in your desired window, you can always grab the tab and reposition it to another safari window directly after it has opened. \nNot sure if this helps or not, just a suggestion. \n", "Q: Troubleshooting AirPrint on HP m201dw I just bought an HP m201dw printer, and while I can print wirelessly from my desktop wired to the router, I can't use AirPrint even though it is advertised as supporting it.\nWhen I try to print a document from my iPad, I get an error message saying, \"No Printers Found.\"\nHardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*HP m201dw printer, initially configured to a Windows 10 PC through USB to select wifi network, but now running wirelessly only on the main network on a dhcp-given ipv4.

Any insights on how I can start using AirPrint from my iPad?\n\n\nA: The Windows PC isn't likely using AirPrint, at least not by default, so it's probably using another protocol such as IPP. Looking around I see there's a Bonjour Print Services for Windows utility from Apple. If you install that are you able to use Bonjour to print?\nHave you checked for any firmware updates on the printer? Can you browse to the printer's web configuration page to confirm that AirPrint is enabled? Perhaps disable it, restart the printer, re-enable and then restart again?\n\nA: Ok, I finally got this working. In short, the router was not forwarding multicast between wireless devices.\nBackground\nSeveral discussions mention a \"Wireless Multicast Forwarding\"  option in the Advanced...Wireless Tomato router configuration page, however it appears it was removed in this particular TomatoUSB version.

Is there any way to use all three of these together?\n\nA: As far as multiple pairs of Bluetooth headphones simultaneously, no, not without additional hardware. While you can obviously pair your iPhone with multiple Bluetooth devices, it can only output audio to one Bluetooth device at a time due to limitations in the A2DP audio profile that is used to transmit audio to the Bluetooth device.\nYou also cannot output audio to both wired headphones and a Bluetooth audio device at the same time.

The \"Pop\" sound I'm talking about is the one found in: System Preferences -> Sound -> Sound Effects -> \"Pop\". \nIs there a way to stop playing this sound? \n\nA: OK, the problem was one of the programs making a notification, while the display banner for that program is turned off in my notification settings, resulting in only this pop sound alert (without displaying anything). That caused confusion.\nThe solution was to disable these notifications whatsoever. If you have similar problem – check your notification settings and look for programs with banners turned off, but with the sound enabled.\n", "Q: How to install GIMP resynthesizer on Mac OS? I'm running El Capitain and have GIMP installed but can't figured out how to install the resynthesizer. I copied the files from the linux version of the plugin into the plugin folder of GIMP but GIMP does not seem to detect it.\n\nA: There are currently two relatively easy ways to get to this plugin. \"Easy\" as in \"still a pain\", just like the other, third and fourth option.\n\n\n*\n\n*The batteries included approach, as recommended b resynthesizer: download a build from GIMP on OS X. Sadly development seems to have stopped about a year ago. Currently the latest version is 2.8.12 built for Sierra. (Original website no longer active as of May 2019. On Sourceforge the version recommended by Resynthesizer Gimp on OSX Gimp-2.8.18p1-Sierra.dmg 2017-01-08)\n\n*The 'some plugins already included approach: download a binary from Partha, Photography and Related Musings. Does not include the resynthesizer plugin itself but has recent builds against which building the plugin itself is a bit easier. Latest builds available. Currently at McGimp 2.10.8 Standard Edition (2019).\n\n*Use the help of MacPorts to build everything GIMP from scratch/source including all build-dependencies and then  go to GIMP Resynthesizer Plugin Suite and build that as well from source.\n\n*Install the official or any other binary for GIMP as usual on macOS, then install a virtual machine and a Linux in that, with GIMP and the resynthesizer plugin ready-made to play well from a package repository. Use that for the Enhance filters (if you work exclusively in the Virtual Machine you might of yourse skip the macOS part of installing GIMP)\nThat said, its probably easiest (and a huge hassle) to just install two versions of GIMP, like in the 4th option. A recent one without the plugin but all the latest core features, and either an older GIMP with plugin, or the GIMP on VM route. \n\nA: To add some approaches not covered in @LangLangC's answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using Homebrew you can run brew cask install lisanet-gimp to get a version of GIMP with some parts of the resynthesizer ready to go, including the most important Filters > Enhance > Heal selection. This suffers from the same problem as the lisanet offerings in @LangLangC's answer: it is out of date. For example, there is no support for .HEIF files.\n\n*There are now prebuilt Mac versions of the Resynthesizer and other plugins available at https://github.com/aferrero2707/gimp-plugins-collection/releases/tag/continuous. There is a thorough tutorial on how to install the files from this site here.\nIn short you download the current version of the plug-in (currently ResynthesizerPlugin-Gimp-2.10-osx.tgz), extract it, and put the extracted files in your plug-ins directory, which may be inside your application bundle. (/Applications/GIMP-2.10.app/Contents/Resources/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins)\nI also had to Ctrl+right-click on the resynthesizer and resynthesizer-gui executables in the Finder and tell OS X it was okay to open them despite the fact that they were downloaded from the internet before everything worked.\nTo avoid these GateKeeper hurdles, run this command before installing the files:\nxattr -csrv ~/Downloads/ResynthesizerPlugin-Gimp-2.10-osx\n\n(Obviously, the path used in that command to remove the downloads-are-dangerous-flag should reflect the actual location of your files…)\n\nA: \"Resynthesizer\"\nI've been chasing my tail like a dog all afternoon over this.\nGimp update 2.9.22 update promptly deleted any signs of \"Resynthesizer\"; healing is gone.\nAs a plugin, the Mac version is not available because it is part of some modified version. I believe mine was McGimp.\nDownloaded McGimp (2.9.7), it's not included.\nI looked and saw no early versions of any custom modifications stating it was included. libregraphicsworld.org: nothing.\n\"Resynthesizer\" for Mac does not exist any more.\nIt is total bs when they claim Gimp had \"Content Aware\" years before Photoshop. Um, no. There was a plug-in for Gimp, requiring a grad student programmer to install it, but no one thought it was important enough to make it a standard filter or fill function.\nI searched all over. There are dozens of tutorials on how to use it, usually boasting \"we're first\" ad nauseam, but no one mentioned where I can download and install it in a Mac, manually or otherwise.\nGimp may have had the plug-in floating around somewhere, but Photoshop had it installed and easy to use in a logical location.\n[No, I do not work for Adobe, otherwise I wouldn't be trying to find it for Gimp.]\nGimp, still doesn't have it; neither do I.\nTime to have a beer.\n\nA: This version seems to have the plugin built and included:\nhttp://gimp.lisanet.de/Website/News/News.html\n\nA: Several things I had to work out. First is make sure you are in your usr Library Gimp folder and not in the Application Contents folder. \nSecond, after you put any .py in the plugin folder you have to \"turn it on\". Mac does this to protect you. Open Terminal and go to the folder where the plugin is, then type \"chmod u+x \" This will give the plugin execute rights. For example \"chmod u+x plugin-heal-selection.py\". Then start Gimp and it should be there!\n", "Q: Where are my photos stored? I am new to OS X. In my About this Mac -> Storage, I have 21GB of photos. However, I have checked the Photos application and there are nothing in it. \nI am not sure where these photos are stored as I don't usually use this computer for storing photos. I guess they might have been imported when I plugged in my iPhone, somehow. What is the best way to track them down?\n\nA: In the Finder, under the File menu, select \"Find\" (Command+F). In the window that opens, leave the first pulldown menu at \"Kind\", go to the next pulldown and select \"Image\" then hit enter. Assuming you set the search to \"This Mac,\" the Finder will then list every image file on your computer, allowing you to see exactly where they are. \n\nA: Try using the shortcut Command+Space to open search and type \"Pictures\".  The result you want to click on should be the second or third result.\nAnother method is to open Finder and navigate to the Pictures directory in your home folder. \n", "Q: Toggling a file's \"hidden\" status Using Automator, I want to be able to toggle a folder or file's \"hidden\" status.

Some days are more often than others. After reading several topics I came to the conclusion that the wireless adapter on Mac is more susceptible to network noise (when many devices are connected to a network) then it drops (sometimes it takes a while to connect). You can do one of the following approaches.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple menu -> System Preferences -> Network, Select Wifi and on the settings \n\n\n \nThen \n \nthen Press OK and then Apply.\nOR\n\n\n*Change the router radio channel to 2.4Ghz. Make sure your WI-Fi access point is set to automatically choose the best radio channel to use - as your radio environment changes constantly and the access point needs to be able to cope with this.\n\n*If your Macbook Pro doesn't have Ethernet connector, you should get an Ethernet adapter to avoid the frustration.\nI hope it helps.\n", "Q: How to set the screen brighness keys to affect the external monitor? I mean instead of affecting the brightness of the built in display of a Macbook.\n\nA: Unless it's an external Apple monitor or built-in screen (i.e. on MacBook or iMac), the brightness of the monitor itself cannot be controlled from the keyboard. There is software available to control what the computer is outputting, therefore adjusting the brightness before it ever reaches the monitor, but there is no way to adjust settings on the monitor itself.\n\nA: As Tubedogg mentioned, the brightness controls control only your Macbook's screen. To control brightness on the monitor, try using the buttons found on the monitor.\n", "Q: Where is Flash installed on OSX? This question is similar, but it's for Windows.\nWhere is flash installed on OSX?\nI've searched the whole filesystem with find, and I see Flash files in the following places:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Application Support\n\n*/private/var/db/receipts\n\n*/private/var/db/BootCaches\n\n*~/Library/Caches/Adobe/Flash Player\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/Flash Player\nWhich of these locations (if any) is where Flash is installed? Or is it in another location?\n\nA: There is no stand-alone application for Flash Player like most software, as it is simply a browser plug-in. If installed, the plug-in file should be located at either /Library/Internet Plug-Ins or ~/Library/Internet Plug-Ins and should be named Flash Player.plugin.\nNote if you have Google Chrome, it is built-in to the browser. In modern versions of OS X, Flash Player is no longer installed by default, so if you haven't installed it manually from another browser, it may not be on your system at all.\n", "Q: ICloud, and iPhoto When I have some downtime, I try to tidy up, and delete photos on my iPad, but only some of the photos have a delete button. Is this because those particular photos (ones without a delete option), were not taken on the ipad? With photo streaming, you can end up with thousands of photos, and I often will take a photo of something as a reminder, instead of writing it down. But then when it comes time to delete said reminder photo, I can't.\n\nA: Pictures that can't be deleted on your camera roll were synced from iTunes.   \nYou can delete them or modify what is synced with iTunes on a Mac or PC.  \nIf you don't have access to the computer with which you first synced those pictures to your device you can follow the steps described in this Apple Support document to delete them:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Create a folder on the computer that you now sync with, and add a single photo to that folder.\n  \n*In the Photos tab in iTunes, click the box next to \"Sync Photos From.\"\n  \n*In the pop-up menu next to \"Sync Photos From,\" choose the folder you created in step 1.\n  \n*Apply the change.\n  \n*Uncheck \"Sync Photos From.\"\n  \n*Apply the change again.\n  \n*Your synced photos will now be removed from the device.\n  \n\nNote that you will lose those pictures with this method, so you may want to check if you have other copies, or save copies by sending them by email for instance.\nPictures taken with other devices when Photo Stream is activated can be deleted normally.\nFrom the My Photo Stream FAQ:\n\nHow do I delete photos from My Photo Stream?\nYou can delete photos from My Photo Stream on your iOS device or Mac when you tap (the trash icon) or click Delete.\n(...)\nWhen you delete a photo from My Photo Stream on one device, it will be removed from Photos and iCloud. The photos you import from My Photo Stream to your other devices won’t be deleted.\n\n\nA: If you use iCloud Photo Library then you should be able to delete any photo from any device since everything syncs with the servers. From kbase HT204264:\n\nEven the photos and videos you delete on one device, delete everywhere that you use iCloud Photo Library. And if you want to get back a photo that you deleted, you can find it in the Recently Deleted album for up to 30 days.\n\nBefore I switched to iCloud Photo Library I know I wasn't able delete photos that were synced from iTunes.\n\nA: The photos that you can't delete are synced to your iCloud from another device. If you want to delete them, you can delete them from the device they were taken on or (IIRC) delete them on iCloud.com.\n", "Q: Run script for delete HD Is there a way to run a script on a Mac that literally will do \n( sudo rm -rf / )?\nI need to schedule a complete wipe of my hard drive on next Friday at 6PM.  I'm not very familiar with scripts so there's no clear answer for me.  Can I run a script that doesn't involve me to grant the sudo password?  I do have my root user password.\n\nA: Just create a launch daemon with \nsudo touch /Library/LaunchDaemons/user.local.rm.plist\nsudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/user.local.rm.plist\nsudo chmod 644 /Library/LaunchDaemons/user.local.rm.plist\n\nOpen an editor:\nsudo nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/user.local.rm.plist\n\nand edit in the following content :\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>user.local.rm</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/bin/rm</string>\n        <string>-rf</string>\n        <string>/</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>Hour</key>\n        <integer>18</integer>\n        <key>Minute</key>\n        <integer>00</integer>\n        <key>Weekday</key>\n        <integer>5</integer>\n    </dict>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nLoad the launch daemon with:\nsudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/user.local.rm.plist\n\nThis will remove almost any file and folder of your internal disk next friday. My virtual machine stopped working with an empty root folder and (according to the status bar) ~6 GB of disk space occupied. Finally it may be less though and the \"6 GB\" was just the last reportable value.\nThis will not erase (=overwrite with random data) your files and folders completely: any decent data recovery tool will probably restore almost all previous content. \nIn El Capitan this only works if SIP is disabled!\n\nA: You can probably do this in a script- if you can do it on the command line then you can do it in a script, too. But it seems messy- not sure how much will actually get erased before the system just hangs. Wonder what will be left behind.\nI'm curious what problem you're trying to solve here (other than erasing a disk at a specified time)... Are you reinstalling an OS when you're done? If you can setup a NetBoot server then you can create a NetInstall or NetRestore image that will auto-erase a specific volume name.\nAnother idea is to just delete the user account, assuming the data you're concerned about is contained within the user's home directory.\n\nA: Same answer as klanomath.\nIf you're paranoid, you could replace rm by srm for a secure remove but it can take a lot of extra-time. \nIn the klanomath .plist file, you can write:\n<key>ProgramArguments</key>\n<array>\n    <string>/usr/bin/srm</string>\n    <string>-r</string>\n    <string>-m</string>\n    <string>/</string>\n</array>\n\n", "Q: iPhone Contact Reverts to Old Data After Edit I have several iDevices that I use: iPad, iPhone and an iPod, all of which sync contacts with iCloud.  I am experiencing the phenomenon where I update a contact on my iPhone and instead of syncing the new data to iCloud where the other devices can pick it up, the phone is pulling the old data down from iCloud and over-writing the updates I just made.\nAny ideas what the problem could be?\n\nA: Hmmm... In general when I run into syncing problems like this I'll log in on icloud.com with my Mac to see what's in the cloud (versus what my devices show).\nFor problematic devices it's recommended to remove the account (or just disable Contacts from iCloud in this case). When prompted, choose to delete the local data. After a few minutes enable it again and then be patient everything syncs.\n\nA: I found the issue was due to Linked Contacts and using multiple email contact accounts.\nSolution 1: Scroll to the bottom of the contact when editing, select the linked contacts and edit them in turn. Note, when editing a linked contact there is the option to remove it as well.\nSolution 2: Stop iOS devices using multiple contact sources (gmail, iCloud, outlook etc.) and chose ONE of these - I suspect iCloud best. \nGive this some thought as you may 'lose' contacts from your device although they'll still be in that account (unless you remove the duplicates using solution 1 first)\n'Settings > Contacts > Default' will let you chose default contacts account. 'Settings > Accounts & Passwords' will let you control what accounts are accessed for what purposes.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I've had this problem as well. My problem is that I changed the ringtone of my wife to ALARM so I could hear it on a noisy day and wanted to change it back. I deleted the European numbers associated with the contact and changed the ringtone to the default. After a random amount of time, it reverted to ALARM and added the erased European numbers. Hmm. \nGo to the contact. Tap edit. Scroll to the bottom. See if the contact is LINKED to another contact. In my case \"Baby\" (my wife) was LINKED to another contact called \"Baby\" that had that European number. Somehow it kept reverting and merging the two. Not only that, it would say \"Call from Baby or two others\" each time the ALARM would sound. I just erased the LINKED contact and changed the ringtone again. Hopefully this is the answer. \n\nA: I have the same problem, but attribute it to poorly formed contacts that I have been dragging around for over a decade, migrating from one system to another, to another, and so on.  \nI now just create a new contact when I want to edit an old one, manually duplicating the various fields, then deleting the old contact. \n\nA: For me I had iCloud contacts and gmail contacts, they are somewhat the same contacts, but I had to disable the iCloud group - edit the contact (the gmail one), then disable gmail group and enable iCloud - edit the contact, then re-enable gmail contact group.\n\nA: It seems to happen a lot, if you sync with Google (or maybe even iCloud), what works for me is to Disable Google DAV cards in Contacts preferences (and maybe the iCloud one in your case.. And you can turn it straight on again afterwards with no issue - in fact keep the Contacts preferences open, uncheck the \"Enable this account\", create/update your contact, and then check the box again and you're done)\n", "Q: Unable to disable apple music I found a setting to show or hide apple music (Music -> Show Apple Music). I turned it off, but now when I go to the music app it shows me the apple music ad with no buttons for ~2 seconds and then the app crashes. Restarting/Resetting the iPhone has no effect. When I re-enable apple music the app works again. I have iOS 9.3.5 on my iPhone 4S. \n\nA: It's very likely a software issue – since iOS 9.3.5 is a relatively recent update, it is bound to have some bugs. If that's the case, you'll need to wait it out until the next update, which will probably be iOS 10 in September.\n", "Q: Master volume control for multiple audio output OSX Few of the third party apps like soundflower and boom used to provide a master volume control for multiple audio output on OSX (aka combining USB audio output and 3.5mm output etc). None of the mentioned apps work anymore, say soundflower app cannot be loaded and boom 2 has a volume control but will not change the volume of multiple output devices. Is there someway on 10.11 to control the master volume of multiple audio output?\n\nA: AudioMate gives you control over individual devices on menubar but it cannot change a master volume control for multiple audio output. Soundflower has one flaw that all your device must have the same output or it will not run - for example all of them set to 48K Hz 2ch-16bit. If you have a 4ch USB and a 2ch 3.5cm you will need to change your 4ch USB to 2ch, likewise on bit rate and frequency.\n\nA: I discovered this whilst searching for something else…\nMultiSoundChanger (freeware, open source)\n\nA small tool for changing sound volume even for aggregate devices cause native sound volume controller can't change volume of aggregate devices\nFeatures:\n\n*\n\n*Changing sound volume of every device (even virtual aggregate device volume by changing volume of every device in aggregate device)\n\n*Changing default output device\n\n*Native appearance (looks like native volume controller)\n\n*Media keys support\n\n\n", "Q: Splitting a thunderbolt connection I have a MacBook air and want to attach a external graphics card but it's already attached to a monitor, so the thunderbolt port is in use so does anyone know of a hub-like device to make my 1 thunderbolt port have 2 plugs. For clarification I want to take the 1 thunderbolt port in my Mac and add a hub (like 100$ or less) so I can instead have 2 thunderbolt ports. (If it's not clear, I want you to submit possible hubs I can buy (off Amazon if possible))\n\nA: To use an external GPU you need to have the connections in this order Mac > eGPU > Monitor. You should not use a thunderbolt hub, as support will become very limited (whether or not an eGPU can be run off of a hub), and performance will be greatly decreased (graphics need to go from Mac > hub > eGPU > hub > mac > hub > Monitor).\n", "Q: Repeated \"styles\" folder in trash I am having recurring \"styles\" folder inside my trash and when I try to delete it, it is showing \"the operation cannot be completed because the item \"styles\" is in use! Is this a virus?\n\n\nA: This answer by Matthieu Riegler suggests the following when dealing with a Trash that won't empty (this does not, however, address WHAT the files are or whether they are malicious):\n\nWhen you have problems to empty the trash, rm -rf ~/.Trash/* in the terminal does the job for you.\nYou have to keep in mind that there might be multiple .Trash directories. \nFor example on a USB stick or a external Drive, OSX will create another .Trash at the root of the drive. So you might need to use  rm -rf /Volumes/DriveName/.Trash.*\n", "Q: Cannot change region of Apple ID without credit card details I have an iPhone 6s Plus. I want to change the country and region but I'm being asked to enter my credit card details, with no other option. \nWhat should I do? Is there an option without entering credit details and changing the store to US?\n\nA: This Apple support article explains that a valid payment method is always required when changing regions.\n\nWhen you change the country or region of an existing Apple ID, you must provide a payment method and update your billing options. If you want to remove your payment method after you change the country or region, you can change your payment information to None.\n\nYou may be able to set up a new Apple ID for a different region without entering credit card information, but any apps purchased (whether free or not) with that Apple ID would require that Apple ID be signed in to get updates.\nTo create a new account without a payment method, go to the App Store, iBooks Store or iTunes Store on your device. Tap Get on any free item and follow the steps for setting up a new account. When prompted for a payment method, None should be on the list. If it's not, you must enter a payment method.\n\nA: You can also change a region with by buying an iTunes prepaid card from the region you intend to change to\n\nA: The best thing to do is to contact apple support in your country.  I requested a call online and they phoned me back within the minute and sorted it out immediately. Fantastic service and free!\n\nA: I believe its not possible to change to region B once you have set up a credit card in region A unless you have a credit card that is valid in B (or at least thats how I think it works) however i'd expect that apple support can probably change your region for you. \nAs a small side note, if you don't have a credit card associated with your account you can change region as much as you want (unless you have unused balance)\nTL;DR:\nI don't think its possible, ask apple support.\nEdit #1:\nDecided to quickly google this. Here is a link that probably does a better job at explaining than me.

Right now, when setting up an ad-hoc network, using the \"Create Network\" feature in OS X/macOS, the device creating the network is \"lost\" – meaning that it can't be used for normal internet connectivity anymore. \nMy question would be, if it's possible through some CLI utility or an app to create an ad-hoc network, but still be able to use the Wi-Fi to connect to the Internet?\n\nA: In the early days of 802.11b, you could set a radio to either be in Access Point -> Station mode, or AdHoc, but not both simultaneously.  And, depending on the vendor, client devices, such as PCMCIA cards, couldn't be AP's without special firmware or software.\nNowadays, operating systems and chipset vendors have blurred the lines between infrastructure networks and adhoc to make tethering and home sharing easier.  Nevertheless, just as you can't connect to more than one SSID (wireless network) at a time, you can't host an SSID as an AP and join another one as a client.  Also, most client devices (computers, phones, and tablets) don't have the radio hardware necessary to be a repeater.\nTo do what you want, you'd need two WiFi adapters, one integrated and one USB, or an external device that acts as a WiFi-Ethernet bridge.\n\nA: Nope, as far as I know you can do this with Ethernet but not with WiFi.\n", "Q: Is Siri able to recognise a contact nickname and action on it?

So I thought that I give her a nickname \"girlfriend\" and ask Siri to \"call my girlfriend\". This does not work. Siri asks me who my girlfriend is even though her nickname is defined as \"girlfriend\"\nSo what is the easiest way for me to call her using Siri? I have 2,000 names in my contact list with many first names that are the same like her. \n\nA: In the Contacts app, edit your girlfriend's card to give her a Relationship of girlfriend. This will solve your problem in the most official of ways.\nSee more detail here.\n\nA: It is possible to add a phonetic name that will help Siri understand.\nEdit the contact, and scroll to the very bottom of the contact info. Tap Add Field, then choose Phonetic First Name or Phonetic Last Name. Fill in the field with a phonetic spelling of the name you want Siri to pronounce or understand. Use combinations of letters that make the best sense for phonetic spelling, and you’ll get better results. \nSo in your case, you can try to set Phonetic First Name to \"my girlfriend\". Note that if you set it to just \"girlfriend\", Siri might have problems if you say \"my girlfriend\".\nOne strange side effect of this, is that the contacts list uses the phonetic name for sorting, so in this example your girlfriend will be sorted in the contacts list uas \"my girlfriend\", and not the original spelling.\n", "Q: Windows Installation on MacBook Pro I am keen on installing Windows 8.1 or 10 on my MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013). Some say Windows don't work well as OS X interferes with it. Is it so ? \n\nA: Windows runs on a Mac independent of the Mac operation system (OS X). Included in OS X is a utility called the Boot Camp Assistant which aids in installing officially support versions of Windows. In your case, both Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 are supported. You will need a 16 GB or larger flash drive to install Windows on your model Mac. While I personally have only installed Windows 10 on iMacs, I would assume you should not have any problems installing on your MacBook Pro.\nOnce Windows is installed, you will be able to boot between the Windows and OS X. Windows can be selected from the OS X System Preferences application. OS X can be selected from the Windows Control Panel or directly from the Desktop.\nMore information can be found at the Apple web site: How to install Windows using Boot Camp.\n", "Q: Option / Preference to toggle folder summary at base of finder window in OSX 10.10 When i did i clean install from osx 10.8 to 10.10 a year or so ago i lost the option to have a summary of the folder i was in at the bottom of the finder window. Recently i seem to have pressed a short cut that has brought back the summary, but i have no idea how i did it.. any ideas ? \nI have included a image of the summary bar below :\n\n\nA: This is not really a \"folder summary bar\" but the \"Status Bar\". It shows the number of items in the opened folder and the available free space on the volume containing the folder. To toggle visibility of the Status Bar use either the key combination cmd ⌘/ (en_US keyboard layout) or the Finder menu View > Hide/Show Status Bar.\n", "Q: External storage device formating error?

Back up as many of your files as possible, reformat the disk, and restore your backed-up files.\n\nHow do I solve the problem?\nSpecs: OS X Yosemite 10.10.5\n\nA: You could easily wipe the drive and start fresh - use care that disk 3 is really the disk you wish to erase everything.\ndiskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ UntitledUFS disk3\n\nIf that fails, you likely have a hardware error (unless the failure is your OS or not using an account with sudo permissions). If that succeeds, you could then use Disk Utility to rename things as you please or learn more about diskutil and use it to rename / repartition / reformat the drive going forward.\n", "Q: SD card corrupt after hot removal Accidentally removing a card reader without first ejecting the Sandisk 256GB MicroSD in it has caused the SD card to become corrupt. When inserting it now, OSX prompts that it cannot read the card and offers an option of initialising it. This doesn't work, and Disk Utility gets stuck \"waiting for the disk to re-appear\" when I try to format it.\nIn Disk Utility and in /dev list, the card shows up as 8MB rather than 256GB. I am hoping that I haven't damaged the controller and that the card might be fixable. Any thoughts?\n\nA: Just setting up a new volume is pretty easy with:\ndiskutil eraseDisk ExFAT SD256 disk44\n\n(I chose disk44 above for the example but you will need to choose your disk number after making sure you're not erasing the boot volume or other critical disks - check your backups and disconnect any external drives you aren't prepared to restore from backup)\nSee Cannot unmount disk0 resource busy and When erasing media in Disk Utility, how can I change the default format? for a little extra visual or other options of diskutil that work on a volume instead of destroying all data on the disk.\n\nA: I had the same issue using a SanDisk Ultra 256GB MicroSDXC UHS-I Card. Card became corrupted when a child removed it during a 100 GB data transfer process using macOS 10.14.3 (Mojave). Long story short the SD card was recoverable but not using Disk Utility, diskutil nor dd on Mac.\nWhat worked for me was to boot from a USB card running Tails using the Opt key at boot on my Mac then use the graphical Disk Utils app installed to format the card without a partition table.\nAfter the reboot Mojave presented a dialog stating it couldn't read the card and provided an Initialize... option which I was then able to use to successfully format (erase) and repartition.\nI ended up using a GUID Partition table with an ExFAT file system for cross-platform portability. The lesson learned here for me was never let a kid near an SD card during a back-up process.\nEdit: Turned this into a blog post with photos.\n\nA: When all else fails...  I try the other platform -- find a PC that supports the SD card and try formatting it there. \nGood luck!\n(Back in the day, I got my first 1GB USB stick from a friend who often brought it to me for reformatting on my eMac (1GHz G4!) after removing it from his PC without ejecting.)\n", "Q: Mount and repair external hard drive with command line tools Is it possible to force-mount an external Fujitsu hard drive with command line tools, if it can't be mounted using Disk Utility? Whether it doesn't matter? I ask because this is not my Mac and at the moment I don't have it\nI have an error message the disk 'name of the disk' could not be mounted\nInfo: MacBook Pro/OS X Yosemite\nAnother question: Can I repair this disk through command line tools?\nI have an error like this exit code 8 something with filesystem and error using Disk Utility:\n\nError: Disk utility can’t repair this disk. backup as many of your files as possible\n\n\nA: Yeah, if Disk Utility is telling you it's time to backup and erase then it's not looking good. Perhaps other disk repair utilities can help? But you might just want to heed the warning and backup and erase.  :)\nYou can force unmount volumes but you can't force mount them.

When I delete an application, preference files in ~/Library and other places usually don't deleted as well. How should I handle these files, should/can I delete them without impacting the system?\n\nA: Just delete the files from the old apps. Never had a problem. Note: if you reinstall the apps, they will not retain any data from the old install. \n\nA: I use App Cleaner from the Mac App Store now, and the user interface is great. I used another app with a similar name, AppCleaner, but I like the one from the App Store more. The Pro version of App Cleaner is $3.99, I believe, and is an in-app purchase.\nThere is no harm in leaving those extraneous preference files in place as they are usually quite small. Let's say you install Airmail, try it out, and then decide you don't want to use it. You can move the app to the trash and delete it. If you leave the preference files in place, you could download it again in the future and your preferences (should) still be in place.\nIt is my personal preference to use App Cleaner and remove all related files when I delete an app.\n", "Q: Does Apple have access to photo data in the cloud in order to optimise them? In order for Apple to optimise the photos and videos on my devices, does it's cloud servers have access to the photo and video data? How else are they able to resize them? This is concerning for privacy reasons.\n\nA: Apple clearly has access to the files, but my understanding is the files get encrypted on your device before they are uploaded. \nI would start with https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303 where Apple says photos are encrypted in transit and in the cloud.\nWhether you or Apple has a valid decryption key depends on date and time and iOS version and your settings on your account. Even though it's clear all data is encrypted while it is in transit and in the cloud for photos, they are likely decryptable by Apple alone without needing your password since you can browse them at https://iCloud.com and most browsers cannot handle decryption of that volume of data locally and securely. So, you should probably not upload anything to iCloud you don't encrypt yourself in a way you know Apple can't unlock if that's your main concern. \nThe optimization almost certainly happens on the device for two reasons. \n\n\n*\n\n*To allow Apple to not need the decryption key going forward (this is evolving as Apple reacts to governmental requests for data collection and unlocks). \n\n*To allow Apple to not have to pay for the CPU bill to do the optimization. \n\n\nA: I hypothesis (I have ver little evidence for this) that due to the encryption requirements for photos in the cloud, that Apple cannot access the photo data to perform the optimisation steps itself. So the device, first uploads an original copy, produces an optimised version including thumbnails, then deletes the original. Consumer devices (devices that didn't produce the original) then download the original version, produce an optimised copy for it's specifications, then deletes the original.\nAlso while on Wifi, the devices are capable of passing the originals directly to each other, rather than over the cloud, but I don’t know if they do.\nThe implications for this is that the process sacrifices network bandwidth for privacy, while a side plus being that the computation cost for doing this for all of Apple's millions of customers and their thousands of photos and videos is offload from their servers and onto the customer's various devices. Apple already explained that their data mining for the new improved event summery and slideshows in the new OS's (iOS 10 / macOS) will be done on device, not in the cloud.\nI imagining this must be the case, unless Apple has some fancy photo / video format that allows the to resize the photo / frames somehow by handling the data in it's encrypted form. But that seems like magic to my CS understanding...\n", "Q: What did iOS do before multitasking? Was there an app switcher or did you have to stop an app and start a new one?\n\nA: Initially, iOS did not have multitasking. Their first attempt was in 2010 (holy crap!). The iPhone just didn't have enough ram and wasn't optimized for it. In 2010, Apple enabled the core apps to multitask, but not 3rd party. I remember jailbreaking my device to bypass that to allow all apps to multitask, but it was buggy. iOS has come a long way folks, with 64bit processing and better memory management.\nFor further reading, take a look at the Wikipedia article.\n\nA: FWIW, Apple has always allowed some of their own apps or services to persist in the background, i.e. the Phone, Mail, push notifications, Find My iPhone, and so on, based on the need and functionality.\nOne thing to consider is that multitasking today on iOS is still limited, especially when compared to desktop operating systems (and perhaps some Android environments). \nBeginning with iOS 4, Apple gives you the illusion that all your apps are running by having created the app switcher. While some of the apps may still be running, most are in hibernation, depending on what background tasks they've registered to run and what RAM is available.\nThe app life cycle has generally behaved like this since day one:\n\n\n*\n\n*User taps app icon\n\n*Launch screen is shown\n\n*First screen (view) is loaded\n\n*User does stuff with app\n\n*User pushes home button (or, with later versions, tapped screen of another app)\n\n*Previously opened app gets signal that it is no longer in foreground\n\n*App gets signal that it's about to be suspended\n\n*App is suspended (state saved in RAM)\n\n*App's state is moved from RAM to disk (flash) when RAM fills up\n\n*User returns to app\n\n*If state is recent enough, state is reloaded from RAM or disk\n\n*If state is stale, app starts over fresh\n\n\nNuances in how state is dealt with have changed over the years, and developers have been increasingly given more control over what they can do in between states. \nWhen people go through and \"force close\" all their apps, they essentially are throwing away any state saved by the app, and killing any background tasks that app may have started.  Many think they are helping to reduce battery consumption and keep RAM clean, but Craig Federighi pointed out that by doing so they may actually cause more battery drain, since the CPU is doing more to reopen those apps every time instead of merely bringing them out of stasis.\nAlso since iOS 4, developers are now allowed to create tasks that can persist even if an app has been suspended, such as audio playback, monitoring network traffic (VoIP), background data refreshes, and location updates.  This is effective because only a portion of the app is running and using resources. \nAs devices get more powerful (more CPU, more RAM, more storage, bigger battery) and as code gets more efficient, these additional tasks prove to be less of a drain on resources.  Newer things like widgets and the forthcoming Siri, iMessage, and CallKit extensions can make it appear like popular apps are always doing something in the background. \n\nA: The app switcher came with limited multitasking. Before that, you pressed the home button and the front program stopped running. \n\nA: First off --- iOS being a Unix flavor, very similar to the Mac OS, has ALWAYS been \"multitasking\" in the deepest sense. Many processes run concurrently on the iOS device all the time.\nWhat was limited is USER INTERACTION with programs. User could not interact with more than one program at any given time. \nAlso, even in the old times, where pressing \"home\" was needed to switch from one app to another - the old app was NOT killed. It was moved \"to the background\", which means - it has no access to the screen, keyboard, camera, etc. and it can maintain only very little system resources while in the background. \nTo completely quit an iOS App you had to double tap the home button and when all running apps started to shake, you could press the little \"x\" to kill them one by one. Only then apps were really killed. \nThe reason for this UI decision, was that only this way Apple could achieve good UI responsiveness and battery-life, with the very very limited system resources of older iOS devices. \nThe situation hasn't really changed much since then - only in specific scenarios, background applications receive little more resources to keep on going (networking in the background, Audio playback in the BG, picture-in-picture, and so on). \nSystem is multitasking as ever, but UI allows more complicated scenarios of more-than-one app partially visible to the user at the same time. \n", "Q: Mail.app in Sierra accumulating Gmail drafts Just now using MacOs Sierra's Mail client. Compared to what happened on El Cap, which worked fine. It seems that now Gmail is accumulating drafts, in other words, once the email is sent, there may be one or many drafts of the email in the drafts folder. Probably corresponding to how many autosaves happened.\nCan I stop this from happening?\n\nA: I don't know if it's just a Sierra issue, but I experienced the exact same thing when I upgraded to El Capitan. That's what happens when you check \"Store draft messages on the server\" in Mail > Preferences > Accounts > Mailbox Behaviour.\nI fixed the issue in the following way:\nUncheck the checkbox for the drafts. You won't be able to see the same draft email on multiple devices, but you'll avoid this annoying behaviour. You can also set, at the Gmail web interface, the Gmail \"Drafts\" folder not to show in IMAP so that you won't have an extra, unneeded Drafts folder.\n\nA: I had just fixed this problem in El Cap when I updated to Sierra, and it came back in full force. The solution is simple though. In this version of the Mail app there's no more checkbox for saving drafts on the server, but you can manually select where Mail stores your drafts for you.\nAs before, go to Settings > Mailbox settings and in the Drafts drop-down menu select either [Gmail]/Drafts or [On my mac]/Drafts. \nSelecting the latter option will prevent Mail from sending your drafts to the Gmail server, resolving the problem with leftover drafts.\nObviously, this does mean that you can't work on your Mail drafts in the Gmail web version.\n\nA: This happens on gmail and on exchange/office 365 for me. It happens on and iOS for me too I addition to macOS so I just delete them later. I can't tell if it's intentionally designed on the gmail / exchange side or an optimization when you connect to a load balancer and don't have one actual server to send mail. \nApple's iCloud seems to handle this better and you could always run an on-premesis outbound mail server if you cannot allow drafts to accumulate or just clean them up periodically or disable saving drafts to the server. \nMy long term solution was to move my personal mail to iCloud and my business mail to FastMail. No more google and their take on IMAP has made my life with native mail clients much better. \n", "Q: Time Capsule user account password change I installed a Time Capsule at my office to handle backups of all Macbooks (8). \nTo ensure a minimum of privacy, via Airport Utility-->Disks I created One account per each user (Changed Secured Shared Disks-->With accounts).\nI used a default password so each user would then sign in via Finder and then change it to something else.\nI've been trying to figure out how a regular user with no access to the Time Capsule main password would go in and update his own password.\nWhen I connect from finder to the Time Capsule a modal comes in to sign in and there's a button to change password.\n\nClicking on change password triggers a new modal to input old password, new password and verify.\nAfter I click Change Password I always get an error like this:\n\nIf I sign in with my assigned password, I can access to my Shared disk account without problems so it cannot be an invalid IP or server name because I can access, I just can't change the password.\nHow do you change a user password on a user account within Time Capsule without using Airport Utility when you know your current user account user & password but you don't know the device password of the Time Capsule.\nThanks!\n\nA: This seems to be a recurring problem with TC devices. I have managed to setup users on a TC in the past, but never had others attempted to change the password. That may be a limitation to the user who created the accounts/setup the TC. Are they able to create their own accounts from their machines? If so, that may help you with the issue. \nIn closing, I know most people get the TC with the hope of being able to backup and use it as a NAS, but there are a lot of limitations with it. Right now, there are a lot of other solutions that can accomplish Time Machine backups, and act as a full-fledged NAS. I am currently running such setup on a Netgear Nighthawk, and I love being able to backup my Mac AND Windows machines.\nFurther efforts: Start by digging Through this post. My second suggestion is to post directly in the Time Capsule Apple forums.

What is the problem?\n\nA: Have you tried holding down the power button until the light goes out completely (10 seconds or longer)?  Then push the power button again and see if it boots.\nYou can try to reset the NVRAM (holding down CommandOption P and R at boot-up) and the SMC (if NVRAM doesn't work).\nSee https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063 and https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295.\n", "Q: OS X browsers option maximize\\zoom I know that how to maximize windows has been discussed in several places.

Dropbox supports them too. I use homebrew so I just did\nbrew install tag\n\nNow, I can easily find anything. Doing my Tax Return? Simple, just show files tagged Tax and 2016. Want to see a favourite photo from 2012, easy just view files tagged 2012 and favourite. Need a recipe? That'll be files tagged recipe.\nThe joy is that with a hierarchical system, you must choose whether that PDF about Image Processing in C++ goes in the C++ directory, or with the PDFs or in Image Processing - with tags, put it any place. Love it!\n\nA: Experts recommend that you should set up the minimal hierarchical folder structure that is logical for you, and use tags for all other categories.\nFor example, Kerry Gleeson's classic book The Personal Efficiency Program (1994, 4th edition 2009) recommends the following three folders: 1. Working, 2. Reference, 3. Archives. \"Working\" would contain files related to projects you have not yet finished (organized into subfolders by project); \"Archives\" would contain finished projects (perhaps organized into subfolders by year or month); \"Reference\" would contain files that are unrelated to particular projects. David Allen's classic book Getting Things Done (2001) recommends similar categories.\nBut Gleeson and Allen's recommendations are just examples; use whatever folder structure seems right for you. That's one of the lessons of the book The Science of Managing Our Digital Stuff (2016) by human–computer interaction researchers Ofer Bergman and Steve Whittaker. Bergman and Whittaker describe \"the user-subjective approach to personal information management\" which has three principles:\n\n*\n\n*Organize stuff by project, just like Gleeson and Allen recommended, as I mentioned above (and in addition to creating a project folder in your folder hierarchy, you can also create a tag for the project, and create a Smart Folder to retrieve all items tagged with that project tag, including email and calendar events, as described below);\n\n*Organize stuff by its importance to you, which means that stuff you think is important should be highly visible and accessible, and stuff you think is less important should be less visible, so as not to distract you with clutter (part of the purpose of the \"Archives\" folder mentioned above is to make older, closed projects less visible, and hierarchical folders in general are great for hiding stuff that is less important);\n\n*Organize stuff by context, which means in connection to related attributes: internal context includes your thoughts while you were interacting with an item (these thoughts can be put into tags, as Brett Terpstra describes in a quotation below), external context includes the place where you were or the other items that you were using while you were using an item (these contexts can be put into tags or links); social context includes other people related to the item, such as other people who have edited the item; and temporal context includes when you last edited an item, why, and what state you left it in (this information is put in, for example, a file's date modified and date created, and in the file versioning system available in macOS since Lion (10.7), and more explicitly in the \"commit\" messages used in version control systems such as Git).\n\nYou can manage tags in many ways, which I will describe in detail below:\n\n*\n\n*in the Finder,\n\n*in Spotlight searches and Smart Folders,\n\n*in third-party apps,\n\n*on the command line,\n\n*in scripts,\n\n*in Save dialog boxes, and\n\n*in many apps, by clicking on the title bar of a document window to see and edit a list of tags for that document.\n\nIn the Finder, make sure you have the Edit Tags button enabled in the toolbar of Finder windows (it is enabled by default, but if you disabled it you can enable it again from the Finder menu View > Customize Toolbar...) and the Tags list enabled in the sidebar of Finder windows (it too is enabled by default, but if you disabled it you can enable it again from the Finder menu Finder > Preferences... > Sidebar). You can customize the list of tags in the sidebar from the Finder menu Finder > Preferences... > Tags. In the Finder, you can select file(s) and then add or remove tags by using the Edit Tags button (add a keyboard shortcut in the Keyboard system preference pane if you wish) or the Get Info window (command + I) or the Inspector modal window (option + command + I).\nYou can search by tags in the search field in the toolbar of Finder windows: just start typing the name of a tag, and a menu will drop down with a list of tags: click on the desired tag to finish the search. (Then click on the Save button if you want to save the search as a Smart Folder.) You can search for tags in Spotlight searches by typing the prefix tag: and then the tag name. In both of these search fields, you can also search for multiple tags at once and use the Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT (or the minus sign –, which means NOT) to narrow search results: for example, tag:trip NOT tag:france is equivalent to tag:trip -tag:france. If you search your entire computer with Spotlight, you can also edit the tags of any email (from Mail.app), calendar events (from local or iCloud calendars in Calendar.app), or reminders (from Reminders.app) that appear in the search results; this is a great way to tag items from multiple apps for inclusion in a single tag search result or Smart Folder.\nThe Finder is not always the best way to browse by tags. Some people have called tags \"Finder tags\"—but this phrase is a misnomer because tags are an extended attribute in the filesystem and are not limited only to the Finder! You can also tag files and browse by tags in third-party apps such as Fresh and Leap from Ironic Software. I find Leap to be an especially excellent way to manage tags, thanks to its tag cloud and many ways of viewing files that are not available in the Finder. You can also index your files in the information-management app DEVONthink, which reads and writes standard tags but also allows you to organize tags into a hierarchy, which allows for what librarians call faceted classification.\nThe easiest way to use tags on the command line is to install James Berry's command-line tool tag, which can be installed with either of two package managers: Homebrew (brew install tag) or MacPorts (sudo port install tag). After installing tag, you can use it to search for tags and to tag files on the command line; for more information, consult tag --help or man tag. You can also use tag in scripts, either stand-alone shell scripts or as part of an Automator workflow.\nHere is the tagging philosophy of software developer and tag enthusiast Brett Terpstra:\n\nThe beauty of tagging, as you may know, is that you can easily assign multiple categorizations and topics to each item, rather than just having them exist at one location which defines it as a type or part of a static collection. I still use the shallow hierarchy of folders that drill down to individual projects and topics, so it's not a \"one pile\" deal. I couldn't function like that; it's difficult to weed, and if metadata is lost, so is the file, essentially. I use folders to maintain filesystem sanity. I use tags and other metadata to maintain my sanity.\nI also use tags on iCal events, emails, web sites and other elements of my system. They're easy to filter in searches and allow me to make a project \"folder\" that contains more types of data than Finder would normally make convenient.\n[...]\nThe secret, which I've learned from a few years of doing this, is to tag intelligently, sparingly and consistently. Being liberal with tags like \"important\" or \"flagged\" just means more upkeep and reviews that have to be done to keep the tags relevant. While tags like \"neat\" or \"supercool\" seem silly to me, I use one \"inspiration\" tag on anything that I'm saving just because it's, well, inspirational. I have a Smart Folder in Finder that pulls up everything with that tag, and then I can filter the files based on date, type, etc. If I add additional tags, they are pretty general, such as \"color,\" \"webdesign,\" or \"productivity.\" These are big buckets I can dive into when I need an idea, or a kick in the pants. The tags on project and research files tend to be more specific, and I can drill down to precise sets of files by typing a few words in Tags or HoudahSpot.\nTo keep the cruft down, I use tags which aren't already defined by other metadata like the creation or modified date, the filetype, the filename, etc. I do tag files with the name of their parent project or topic, even though it's often redundant to the folder hierarchy. This allows me to tie projects together across multiple folders, disks or even servers. Sometimes a file is more strongly tied to a topic than it is to an individual project. Say it's a general reference item or a stock photo that I gathered while working on a specific project, but that I know I'll need again. I put it into a reference folder or photo collection, and tag it with the related project. It's easy to view it in the context of the project with a tag search, but part of a larger collection of similar items at the same time.\nWhen in doubt, I usually choose tags based on the first thought that pops into my head. Chances are, when I'm looking for it again in a year, I'll have the same thought. It doesn't always work, but I've had a pretty good success rate over the last couple of years. As often as possible I try to reuse tags; a tag that reveals one or two files is a useless tag. My \"Yearly Review\" includes weeding out tags that have very few associated files, or that could be merged into more common tags.\n\nKeep in mind that you may lose your tags if you transfer files to a filesystem that does not support tags, or if you use a version control system like Git that does not support tags. Some important reading on this topic includes:\n\n*\n\n*Brett Terpstra's blog post \"How to lose your tags\"\n\n*The Ask Different question \"Are tags portable, and if so how?\"\n\nA: I am very strict with myself about my file organization. Documents go in the Documents folder. Photos go in the Photos folder. Movies, Music, etc. I have used the tags to mark files that I am currently working on, like Developer resources or website pages, called \"Recent.\"\nI continued with this theme of tagging folders with various similar natures - family related, work related, insurance related... And soon, I ran out of colors. I didn't want duplicate colors. The only open with adding additional tags is red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple... and colorless.\nThe discovery of the colorless tag was a game-changer. I found the various colored dots in my folders bothersome, so when I switched them to colorless, this problem was solved. Now, in Finder, I can click on any tag I want and pull up the files related to that tag. Within Documents or Photos, I might have several folders having to do with different family members. But the \"Family\" tag shows me all of them. This is how I keep my files organized now.\n", "Q: Where did my Finder Filter go?

I thought this feature was only for apps, not for documents.\nThis is a C# script file, and I've told it to open it with Visual Studio Code. I can open VS Code with no problem, so it doesn't seem to be the permissions on that.\n\n\nA: The document is likely marked as executable.\nYou need to remove the executable bit from the file. This does not affect the file's contents, only how it is handled by the operating system. You can do this with the command line tool chmod:\nchmod -x <path to file>\n\nFile Marked as Executable\nAll executable files pass through macOS's security checks. As this file is not a signed executable, the checks fail.\nAs this is a mistakenly marked-as-executable file, the ability to open bypassing the checks are disabled; there is no executable to actually launch.\nThis problem is fairly common when moving files between operating systems. Differences in the importance of file type bits effectively get lost in translation.\n\nA: I was facing this problem for all .php files.\nIt can also happen for files with other extensions. \nIf you are using MacOS High Sierra or Mojave- All you need to do is right-click on any of the file > Get info > Open with (here choose the app you want to open the file with)> Click on change all.\n\nThat's all you need to do. Now all files with this extension will open easily.\n\nA: This answer applies if you set the app for that particular document, not for all documents of that type (e.g. by using Get Info on the document, and changing the \"Open with\" pop-up menu, but not clicking the \"Change All\" button).\nThere are two critical pieces here. First, if you set a document to open in a particular app, what it actually does is attach some metadata to the file (think of it like sticking a post-it note onto the file) that says to open it with that particular app. Second, if a document is quarantined (because it was downloaded from the internet, or created by a sandboxed app, or some other reasons), it's considered untrusted, and the gatekeeper security policy will be applied to anything like executable in the file.\nThese two features can interact in an unfortunate way: that \"open with\" note is an instruction about what to do, and therefore (sort of) executable code, and therefore the gatekeeper security policy applies to it (even though you created the note, it's \"part of\" the untrusted file, and therefore untrusted). Thus, double-clicking a document (with \"open with\" metadata) can get you the untrusted app warning/error.\nFortunately, as long as you want all files of that type (.cs in this case) to open in the same app, there's a solution: in the Info window, Open with section, select the app you want (e.g. Visual Studio Code), and then click \"Change all\". This removes the metadata from the file, and instead makes an entry in your Launch Services preferences saying that you prefer to have files of that type open in that app. Since the setting is now a personal setting rather than a note attached to an untrusted file, the problem goes away.\n\nA: This is probably because the file was downloaded from the internet; Safari marks it as quarantined to make it harder for malware to execute. \nYou can test this easily by doing xattr <file> and checking if one of the output lines is com.apple.quarantine.\nIf it does, the solution is simply to do xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <file>. Note that executing that command for a file not in quarantine will give an error that the attribute was not present. So it is safe to just start with that; if the warning is given, look for another solution.\n\nA: Your Mac is protecting you from \"unidentified developers\" by default. By default you can't run apps that aren't downloaded from the app store. Try this: open Preferences->Security & Privacy->General, change \"Allow apps downloaded from:\" to \"Anywhere\". That should solve message from coming up.\n\nA: Try right clicking on the file and choosing \"Open with...\", and opening it with the application you want to use. This time, you should get an \"open anyway\" option.

The slideshow feature of the built in Photos app does not really work - it crops the video, and adds a gray border.\nI have tried a number of apps for this purpose, none of which actually seem to do the job very well or at all.\n\nA: Turns out the VLC app was the only decent solution I could find.\n", "Q: Old TM data to new installed macbook For more than a year my macbook air used a time-machine (local network, synology). After completely new fresh install of my macbook air, i reconnected time machine. In TM, data before the fresh install is not shown if i enter time-machine. Only the backup made after the new install is shown. How can i access the old data? On the TM itself it looks like old and new data is merged.\nKind regards\nGeorge\n\nA: If I recall correctly, Time Machine will notice if there are existing backups on the disk you select and ask if you want to reuse the old backup data.\nI haven't tried personally but looks like you can use the tmutil command to inherit a backup, too:\nsudo tmutil inheritbackup /path/to/backups\n\nSee also:  http://pondini.org/TM/B6.html\n", "Q: Missing scaled resolution for external 4K display on MacBook 2016 I'm running my MacBook 2016 attached to LG 27MU67-B operating fine in native 4K resolution. But the choices for scaled (DPI)resolution are somewhat broken.\nIn display preferences pane I'm presented scaled resolution setting choices as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*3840 x 2160\n\n*1920 x 1080\n\n*1680 x 945\n\n*and more useless resolutions.\n\n\nI'm currently forced to use 1920x1080 which results on a ridiculously zoomed in UI. The highest resolution is native resolution which is a bit too small to work with. With a MacBookPro 2012 I get a 2400-something resolution, which is not available on the MacBook. Is this limit imposed by the MacBook hardware ? Or is it possible to activate more higher resolutions than 1920x1080 but lower than 3840 x 2160 with a defaults write trick ?\nThis is a screenshot of my currently possible settings:\n\n\nA: Select the highest resolution and then alt-click the Scaled radio-button.

Then it turns on to show my lock screen and dies straight away. \nIt has been doing the same thing for the past 4 hours. What should I do?\n\nA: We'll need to troubleshoot the charging method first - then the device itself.\nTroubleshooting the charging method, adapter, cable:\n\n\n*\n\n*Compare packaging and writing on the cable:\n\nTo identify counterfeit or uncertified cables and accessories, look carefully at the accessory's packaging and at the accessory itself. Certified third-party accessories have the MFi logo on their packaging. An Apple Lightning to USB cable has \"Designed by Apple in California\" and either \"Assembled in China,\" \"Assembled in Vietnam,\" or \"Indústria Brasileira\" on the cable about seven inches from the USB connector. You'll see a 12-digit serial number at the end of this text.\n\n\n*Compare connectors and laser etchings:\n\nYou can use the Lightning connector, USB connector, and laser etchings to identify counterfeit or uncertified Lightning accessories. Compare the images below of certified Apple accessories and counterfeit or uncertified Lightning accessories. These are only a few counterfeit products.

Don’t use the USB ports on your keyboard.\n\n*Plug your cable into a powered USB hub, docking station, or other Apple-certified accessory.\n\n\nIf your device won’t charge or charges slowly:\nIf you have very low battery and plug into power, a black screen or a black screen with a red battery might appear for a few minutes. Follow these steps and try again after each:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check your charging cable and USB adapter for signs of damage,* like breakage or bent prongs. Don't use damaged accessories.\n\n*Use a wall power outlet and check for firm connections between your charging cable, USB wall adapter, and wall outlet, or try a different outlet.\n\n*Remove any debris from the charging port on the bottom of your device, then firmly plug your charging cable into your device. If the charging port is damaged, your device probably needs service.\n\n*Let your device charge for a half hour (If your device is unresponsive afterward, learn what to do).\n\n*Force restart your device: Press and hold the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons at the same time for at least 10 seconds, until you see the Apple logo. Then let your device charge for another half hour.\n\n*If your device still won’t power on or charge, take your device, charging cable, and charging adapter to an Apple Retail Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider for evaluation. You can also contact Apple Support.\n\n\nSource: Apple\n", "Q: How can I prevent Mac terminal ssh from disconnecting when the screen is automatically turned off? I frequently use ssh on my MacBook to connect to other servers and run long-running commands there. When I do this, I leave the lid open to let it run, but then if I don't go to make coffee or something, it automatically turns the screen off, and this also causes the ssh to disconnect.\nI tried to find how to prevent this automatically in the Terminal settings and in power saving settings, and couldn't find anything relevant. To prevent this disconnection I play a video silently, and this doesn't let power saving turn the screen off, but this is weird and lame to begin with, and if I forget to do this, then my session is lost. Is there anything better and more automatic?\n\nA: Keep your computer awake for 1 hour:\n\ncaffeinate -t 3600 &\n\nKeep your computer from idling until a Terminal command finishes\n\ncaffeinate -i long_running_script.sh\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-d just prevents the display from sleeping\n\n*-m just prevents disks from sleeping when idle\n\n*-s keeps the whole system awake\n\n\nhttp://brettterpstra.com/2014/02/20/quick-tip-caffeinate-your-terminal/\n\nA: As mentioned by Jakuje in the comments above, I strongly recommend using screen (or tmux) for long running commands or sessions that you would want to resume if disconnected for any reason.\nAnother approach would be to install mosh (https://mosh.org/) to make the connection. You can use it just like SSH and but it has support for intermittent connectivity (e.g., your laptop going to sleep) so that you can resume the connection without interruption from a user perspective.\nHowever, I suspect your problem is not necessarily from the screen turning off, but from the SSH session timing out due to an idle connection.  You can edit your ~/.ssh/config file and add in an entry similar to the following\nhost your.remote.host\n     ServerAliveInterval 180\n\nwhich will cause your client to send a packet to the server every 180 seconds if it doesn't receive a packet from the server.\n", "Q: Missing Calendar inbox on desktop I receive notification (in both the notification center dock) of changes to our (family) shared calendar, though unlike my iPhone and Macbook Pro, the inbox is nowhere to be found on my iMac (Late 2013).

Doing so removed the notification from the Calendar app, along with the inbox button. I took note with the Calendar application and notifications open (they typically greeted me on startup).

I like to store all of my mac configuration in a version-controlled dotfiles repository so I can quickly get back to ground zero when I make a new mac. \nHow can you disable the shift key slowness that occurs when you do Ctrl+Shift+Up Arrow and Ctrl+Shift+Down Arrow from the command line?\nI've tried defaults write com.apple.finder FXEnableSlowAnimation -boolean false; killall Finder, which I found at How to disable slow motion effect in Mac OS X (shift key)?.

Here's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*I used the MacPro Firmware updater to change it's version from 4,1...5,1.\n\n*I installed a 480GB Mercury Electra 3G SSD which I bought from OWC in the next available slot.\n\n*I installed Sierra Public beta. It's been updated twice, and now it's at 10.12 Beta (16A313a)\n\n*I now noticed that the wifi icon in the toolbar has a big X on it, and it says that no wifi \nIs it possible that there's a new incompatibility with the wifi card with Sierra, or that somehow adding the new SSD caused a problem?\nDoes anyone have experience with this and/or have any hints?\n\nA: Apple decided to try and piss off as many educational customers as possible by not including basic broadcom drivers from their AirPort wifi cards.  Even the later 4321 cards do not have a driver in MacOS Sierra and some of them shipped with Mac PRO 2010's.  So Apple even lied to their own owners about what models would be supported.  I have two Mac Pro's one is a 2009 and the other is a late 2010.  The late 2010's wifi does work.  The original card from the 2009 does not work and the upgraded BCM94321MC also does not have a driver in Sierra.  My 2nd Mac Pro has the following Wifi that does work.  Apple Airport Extreme BCM94322MC.  Comedic isn't it the BCM94322MC works and the BCM94321MC doesn't.  I ordered a second 22 to fix this issue.\n\nA: Just an fyi, the BCM94321MC is not an updated card. That card has been around since at least 2006/2007 as it is the same card that shipped in the original (silver) Apple TV.\n\nA: It maybe an issue with the new software.

There is a guide here.\n", "Q: iCloud won't allow me to mark some mail as \"Not Junk\" I have a consistent issue of some legit emails showing up in my Mail client (OS X Mavericks) as junk.  They are also marked as junk in icloud.com which is why they are coming in as junk to my mail client.  The problem is, these emails can't be marked as \"Not Junk\" even in icloud.com.  I can mark them \"Not Junk\" and they will immediately be marked as junk again and reappear in my junk folder.\nHow can I get iCloud to accept that these messages are not junk and leave them set that way?\n\nA: Found a real solution!  If I save the sender of any of these \"problem\" emails to my address book within iCloud, then they are automatically not marked as Junk any longer.  Hooray!\nSimply open the mail, click on the address of the sender, and click Save.

It is possible for a MDM to disable almost all apps on an iOS device by issuing a configuration profile that specifies \"no apps\" in the Restrictions Payload.  When disabled, apps simply disappear from the device home screen.\nMy problem is that if I distribute configuration profiles with this restriction and then later distribute new profiles removing the restriction, all of the app icons on the device reappear but not organized as they were before they were disable.\nAny ideas on how to prevent or workaround this?\n\nA: Kidslox have a workaround they call Icon Fixer.  I haven't tested this, but came across it a while ago.\n\n... Once downloaded, the Icon Fixer ‘app’ will appear as a greyed out icon on your device. It’s basically an app that never fully installs and this frozen state is what keeps the apps in order when using Kidslox.\n\n", "Q: Can you do a group Google chat with Messages? How do you do a group Google chat (Hangouts) with iOS Messages? Specifically I would like to do a group chat via iOS Messages with multiple people who use Google Hangouts either where they initiate the group chat or I do.\nThanks all for any ideas or suggestions!\n\nA: You can do a group conversation in Messages, but there's no way to automatically have it set up based on a group from Hangouts.\nTo start a group conversation in Messages for iOS, tap on the paper/pencil icon at the upper left of the threads list, then simply enter as many contact names or phone numbers as you like. When you send a message, it will create the group automatically.\n", "Q: Rename a music playlist from \"Purchased\" to actual album name on iPhone 6, iOS 9? I have a free music album from the iTunes store that shows in my iPhone playlist as \"Purchased.\" I want to rename it to the album name.\nCan I do that directly on the phone, or do I need iTunes? How do I do it?\nIf it makes a difference, then the album is U2 Songs of Innocence. You know, the album that everyone was upset about it because it suddenly appeared in your playlist, whether you wanted it or not.  \n\nA: You cannot rename 'Purchased' - that is where all your 'officially purchased from Apple' [whether you had to pay for it or not] music sits. \nYou are free to make a new playlist & copy any tracks you wish to it, exactly as you would for any playlist, on phone, pad or Mac.\n", "Q: Mount Android Phone on Desktop Is there a way to mount my Android phone on my Mac Air desktop in order to transfer files like images and music?\n\nA: Use Android File Transfer, created by Google itself, and it gives you a Finder window to at least transfer files via USB connection. I noticed, however, that you have to use the Samsung cable they provide to power the phone, and not some cheap knockoff USB cable.\nIt would be nice to have a way for the icon to mount on the desktop via a Bluetooth connection -- but that's just not possible yet.\nThere is also the free Handshaker application in the Apple Store that is more full-featured and intuitive than Google's Android File Transfer. So far, it's looking like my best option and I don't see quirks except that I had to enable Android Developer Mode and then turn on USB Debugging on, as well as uninstall Android File Exchange because it conflicts with it.\n\nA: It is possible to use \"Android debug bridge\" (ADB) command line tool. It is intended to use it for testing and deploying apps under development, however it enables users/developers to run commands like adb ls to list all files and adb pull sdcard/DCIM/Camera ~/Documents/ will copy all the files in the sdcard/DCIM camera folder to Documents. Read more on how to install and use the tool here. Note adb requires the phone to have enabled developer mode and USB debugging. Read more here; https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html \n\nA: Still, if there was another app to accomplish this, it would be much better as this official app hasn't been updated in over 5 years. Also, handshaker has recently broken. (At least for the time being)\n", "Q: Access permissions for command file created with bash I wrote myself a simple bash script which is a wrapper for compass create function, plus it creates a command file in the directory for compass watch (so that instead of manually typing out the directory and watch every time, I just double click on an icon in the project folder).

Apple doesn't take processor microcode updates seriously, that microcode should be revision 22 at the very least.\nThat said, it is also possible for that MCE to be caused by memory corruption or signal corruption.\n", "Q: How to fix iTunes corrupting music during transfer? I have an iPhone 5s on 9.3.5 and every time I add music to the device, the files play with artifacts(glitches) on the device itself. Meanwhile the files on the computer play perfectly fine. Any solution ?\n\nA: Two possibilities I can think of...\nOne is that the phone needs re-booting or resetting & restoring from a backup. If you keep encrypted backups in iTunes this wouldn't be too disruptive to test.\nThe other is that the bit-rate of the tunes is too high for it to keep up.\nYou may benefit from reducing the bit-rate of tunes transferred to the phone, which you can do from iTunes prefs.\n\nThe first sync after you set this will be a lot slower than normal, as it converts all the tunes to be transferred. Subsequent syncs should be back up to speed.\nYou are unlikely to be able to perceive much sonic difference from a phone if you down-sample to 128k AAC.\n", "Q: CPU temperature using sysctl I'm trying to get CPU temperature from the terminal using sysctl.\nCommand:\nsysctl machdep.xcpm.cpu_thermal_level\n\nOutput:\nmachdep.xcpm.cpu_thermal_level: 0\n\nBut the given temperature is not correct(Original temperature is: 51c).\nHow does the temperature is calculated by sysctl?

Currently, according to Display preferences, it looks like 1680x1050, and that is the smallest option.\nI want everything to be WAY WAY smaller. My eyes are super good and I bought a MacBook with a retina display for a reason - so I could fit more stuff on the screen. \nNotice how in the attached screenshot underneath the picture of the MacBook, it says \"Looks like 1680x1050\". That is no good. I need to fit a lot of stuff on my screen at once. \nAn example is when I open up League of Legends in Retina resolution, the cursor becomes extremely tiny for 3 seconds. That is how I want my whole Mac to look like.\nIs there any way to set the scaling to 100%, like you can in Windows?\n\n\nA: I have a 15\" MacBook Pro with Retina Display and by itself, the highest resolution I can set in System Preferences > Hardware > Display > Display > (o) Scaled, is 1920x1200. To get an even higher resolution, e.g 2880x1800 I use a third-party utility named Display Menu. It's available in the App Store for free.\n", "Q: How to increase size of mouse pointer for presentations? How to make the mouse pointer appear larger in size?

I live in a building that has wireless internet.  How do I use it while also having access to my wifi network, which connects my Mac to my other devices (Philips Hue, Belkin Wemo, streaming music from my Mac to my Apple TV, etc).\nI'm using the latest version of macOS/OSX on a Mac Mini, plus an iPhone and an iPad.  I also own an Apple Airport Extreme, which I'm using to serve my local wifi network.  I also have a 1st gen Airport Express that I haven't used in ages, but it's old enough that the OSX Airport Utility app can't configure it (I think it's from 2006?).\nUPDATE:  I answered my own question.  See answer below (tl;dr: I bought a new Airport Express & added it to my setup)\n\nA: You can connect your Mac Mini to the building's wireless network, and then via Ethernet to your AirPort Extreme. Then setup Internet sharing from Wifi to Ethernet and you'll be able to have both internet from your wireless provider and a local wifi network for your IoT devices and streaming setup.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the ethernet cable to the Mac\n\n*Launch “System Preferences” from the  Apple menu and click on “Sharing”\n\n*Click on “Internet Sharing” from the left menu\n\n*Select the pull-down menu next to “Share your connection from:” and choose “Wifi ” or \"AirPort\"\n\n*Alongside “To computers using:” check the box next to “Ethernet”\n\n*Click Ok\n\n\nThen open Airport Utility and configure your AirPort Extreme unit as follows: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open AirPort Utility, located in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder. Select the base station you want to set up, then click Edit.\n\n*Click Network, and then choose Off (Bridge Mode) from the Router Mode pop-up menu.  \n\n\nWith NAT and DHCP turned off, the base station acts as a simple bridge between the wired and wireless computers on the network.\nOnly your Mac Mini should connect to your building wireless network; if any other device of yours connects to it you won't \"see\" it on your local network.\n\nA: UPDATE: I answered my own question as follows:\nI bought an Apple Airport Express and set it up on my building's wifi. Then, I connected it by ethernet cable to my Airport Extreme's WAN port. My Airport Extreme is still functioning just as it always has, broadcasting my local wifi network. I've been testing this for over a week now and it's been flawless. Best of all, the current Airport Express model can be found on ebay for under $40 shipped.\n", "Q: WatchOS 3 and iOS 10 - Exercise times So I'm running iOS 10 and Watch OS 3.  I turned on my workout on my apple watch and went for a walk for 28 min.  When I was done, I checked the workout and it says 28 min.  If I go into my 'Activity' on the watch or my iPhone, it says my exercise for the day was only 11 min... But I can click on the workout and see it was 28 min.  Any ideas?\n\n\n\nA: WATCH determines a certain activity threshold beyond which it will consider an activity to be exercise. This threshold is specific to each individual, and takes into account your heart rate throughout the day vs. during an activity, your previous activities, etc.\nYour average heart rate for that walk seems high enough to be considered exercise, although once again it is difficult to tell the exact threshold WATCH is using for your specifically. With that in mind, if we assume that the average heart rate is high enough, then that leaves us with the pace.\nAccording to Apple, an activity needs to be at the level of a brisk walk or faster for it to grant credit. You may try checking periods where you might have walked faster or slower, and seeing if you can correlate those to the bars on the Exercise graph.\nI hope this helps. I’m sorry if it can sound demoralizing to have an electronic device “judging” your activity level, but don’t get discouraged!\n", "Q: Weird behaviour of mysql-connector-c++ in OSX I'm developing an application in c++ in OSX Yosemite that uses mysql. I've installed both mysql and mysql-connector-c++ using brew. \nI could use the library without any problems until recently, butnow I'm having some problems. \nBasically, when I try to run my application I get the following error:\nlibc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type \nsql::SQLException: Unknown MySQL server host 'K@??' (0)\n\nI've checked and I'm correctly passing the host name, which is localhost. I've tried to reinstall mysql-connector-c++ but the problem remains. Does anyone have any idea on how to fix this?\nI'm using mysql version 5.7.14 and mysql-connector-c++ version 1.1.6_1.\n\nA: I also got this problem. I guess the reason is the mismatch between macos and mysqlconn. The latest mysqlconn binary release only supports up to macos 10.10 and the latest macos is 10.11. I compiled the driver myself and the issue has gone. So you can try to compile that yourself and it should work. Here are the commands I used:\ncmake -DMYSQL_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.7.15/bin/mysql_config -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/\nmake;make install\n\nThen you can just include ~/include and ~/lib for your header and libs. Hope this works for you. If this still does not work, try to check whether you used the same gcc for both mysqlconn and your program. brew now installs gcc 6.2 but mac only carries 4.2.\n", "Q: How do I send text messages from an iMac OSX El Capitan to an Android phone? The recipient is not registered on iMessage, which leads me to believe he is not on an iMac.  I have received txts from him on my Android and I have his phone number.  Is there a way to do it on OS X without purchasing additional software?\n\nA: iMessage uses a connected iPhone to send text messages from your Mac to anyone, including Android. Unfortunately you're using an Android phone so you're going to need a third party app.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2009 won't go to sleep when lid is closed My macbook pro 2009 stopped hibernating after closing the lid, also keyboard back light seems stopped working as well, I tried LabTick but no luck.\nAssertion status system-wide:\n   BackgroundTask                 0\n   ApplePushServiceTask           0\n   UserIsActive                   1\n   PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep    0\n   PreventSystemSleep             0\n   ExternalMedia                  0\n   PreventUserIdleSystemSleep     1\n   NetworkClientActive            0\nListed by owning process:\npid 139(coreaudiod): [0x0000008f000101e7] 00:09:05 PreventUserIdleSystemSleep named: \"com.apple.audio.Boom2Engine:0.context.preventuseridlesleep\" \n    Created for PID: 348. \n   pid 98(hidd): [0x0000004900090168] 00:10:15 UserIsActive named: \"com.apple.iohideventsystem.queue.tickle\" \n    Timeout will fire in 109 secs Action=TimeoutActionRelease\nNo kernel assertions.\nIdle sleep preventers: IODisplayWrangler\n\n\nA: Looks like that well-known Mac-borker..

I had this running the public beta. I have since wiped all data using the reset functionality. My question is... will it continue to update? \n\nA: In order for it to update to public beta software the phone needs to have a profile downloaded on the device which can be obtained from Apple's beta site assuming you signed up for it then you could just log in with your Apple ID and download it which will then give you the updates for the beta software.\n", "Q: Deleted GarageBand but taking up space I deleted GarageBand by dragging the app to the trash, but in the system information it says it is still taking up over 20gb, where are these files located?\n\n\nA: If you installed loops - you'll have to clean them out: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201503\nIf you made projects, they could be stored anywhere on the disk - probably in a /Users folder.\n\nA: I had the same problem if the people above did not help, take these steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Download OmniDiskSweeper (a comprehensive file removal app) from the App Store. \n\n*Open the app and click your main drive.\n\n*Give the application about 5 minutes to size your driver \n\n*GarageBand and the loops should be under the same folder I'm pretty sure its either \"Users\" or \"Applications\", click the item you would like to delete and press the \"delete\" button on the bottom right of the application. \nYou can also use this app to delete unnecessary files or garbage files.

But I don't have permission to modify this list file(Info.plist) on EI Capitan 10.11.4 or 10.11.5. Before 10.11.4, there is no this permission thing, I can't see why apple doing this.\nAnyone knows how to modify the Info.plist(directory: \"/usr/libexec/SmartCardServices/drivers/ifd-ccid.bundle/Contents/\")?\n\n\n\nA: The culprit (as suggested by klanomath) is likely System Integrity Protection, that protects (except others) also the /usr directory. To switch it off\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch off your Mac\n\n*Boot into recovery (when you press power button, you should be already holding cmdR keys, hold them as long as the display is clear white)\n\n*In the recovery system, go in the menubar to Utilities > Terminal \n\n*Terminal window will pop-up.

I click 'restart' to allow the computer to update but it never does. The dock and desktop wallpaper remain but the menu bar at the top and all icons on the desktop disappear. \nI have the same problem exactly whenever I go to shut down the computer. I click shut down and again the dock and background stay but everything else vanishes. It is as if it has only partially gone through the process. \nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Your problem is in no way related to Security Update 2016-001.\nWhen your Mac want to terminate a system update, it should go through\na normal Restart... as the one you see in  > Restart....\nAnd to achieve this restart it must terminate correctly all the\nprocesses actually running.\nYour actual problem is caused by one process which refuse to exit correctly.\nThe first and easiest way to diagnose which process is the culprit\nconsists of using the combination to force quit any ill behaving\napplication:\ncommand ⌘option ⌥esc\nIf my hypothesis is correct you might see a typical application\nflagged as not responding. This mean that this process became deaf\nstupid and won't hear the signal sent by the system to tell it to exit.\nIn this case, just kill it with the Force Quit button.\n\nA: If you can log out of the account - do that. It will likely show you which program is hung. You can use the force quit option (in the same Apple Menu as log out).\nOnce you've failed at force quitting apps and logging out, you can force a shut down in terminal (if terminal can open)\nsudo shutdown -h now\n\nIf that fails, you would hold the power button down and / or pull the power plug.\n\nA: I've been having the exact same problem and finally took time to troubleshoot. I restarted in Safe mode (hold down shift after chime). I hold to manually restart (held down power button) because my stalled restart problem wasn't just for to software update--it also got stuck when using the Finder to restart. Once in Safe mode, my Mac automatically picked up the software update process, finished it and restarted on its own. So far, so good now.\n\nA: Force your iMac to shut down and restart by holding down the command and control while pressing the power button.\nWhen it restarts and the login screen comes up, cklick the restart icon.\nThat worked for me. Had to do it twice since I also had the iTunes update to do.\nEdit: I'm sorry, but my solution doesn't solve the actual problem (the iMac not restarting).

It reports its size as 52.2 MB.\nThere is one big caveat, though - depending on what the Safari v7 installer did to his system, it may not work to reinstall v5, in which case he may need to reinstall the OS.\n", "Q: What is a MIDI Network Directory, and why is the connection refused? I am for the first time attempting to sync my two computers running Ableton Live using the OS X virtual MIDI Network driver over Thunderbolt.\nThe connection works if I use the MIDI Network Setup option \"Who may connect to me\" set to Anyone. But if I set it to Only computers in my directory,  I get the error message: \n\n(IP address) refused the connection request.\n\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the MIDI Network Setup Directory?\n\n*Why do my two computers see each other in the Directory menu box, but can't connect unless the option is set to Anyone? Computers seeing each other in the box suggests to me that they are in the same Directory, but apparently they are not. Or if they are, what could be the issue?\n\n*Is it safe using the setting Anyone? I ask because the computers primarily connect via Thunderbolt, but they are also on the same Wi-Fi network, and I wish to keep that network as safe as possible from outsiders.\n\n\n\n\nNote: To get to MIDI Network Setup, open the application Audio MIDI Setup and in the menu bar select Window → Show MIDI Studio (⌘ + 2) and then double-click on the Network icon.\n\nA: There are two categories of participants or contacts that will show in the window labelled \"Directory\". In one category are all the computers automatically discovered on the local network using Apple's Bonjour, a.k.a. mDNS or Zeroconf. These are displayed with a green dot icon. In the other category are computers added manually as contacts using the '+' button. These are displayed with the icon of a Rolodex-type contacts card (though on some versions of macOS, this icon may not display).\nThough it's not explained very well, the setting \"Only computers in my Directory\" refers only to the latter, manually-added contacts. This provides some level of security, so that not just anyone on your local network can join your MIDI session, which would be the case if all automatically-discovered computers were allowed, as happens with the \"Anyone\" setting.\nWhether the \"Anyone\" setting is safe depends on your threat model. If you were giving a concert at a club, using its shared public WiFi connection, an audience member could join their laptop and control your equipment during the performance. Whether that's a bad or good thing is a matter of opinion.\nThere is no setting for \"Only computers in my local network\". The \"Anyone\" setting would allow anyone on the Internet to connect, if the session's port is open or forwarded in the router. Again, this may or may not be what you want. There aren't any known vulnerabilities in Apple's MIDI Network tools that would allow a remote computer to take over your computer or network, so barring that, they only thing they can do is send and receive MIDI.\nIn order for the \"Only computers in my Directory\" setting to work, you must manually add the other computer to your Directory, even if you already see it via Bonjour. In that case, you'll end up with two entries for the same computer/port, one with a green dot, and one with a contact card icon and a \"reconnect\" checkbox. The other computer must also manually add your computer to its Directory. You can put whatever you want in the \"Name\" field. Typically you'll be using a private network (e.g. 192.168.*.*) and not have domain names, so you need to enter the IP numbers in the \"Host\" field. This can be a problem if you're using DHCP to obtain the IP numbers, and the numbers change. You can't use the Bonjour names like myMac.local, presumably because anyone on the local network can set their own Bonjour machine name and thus could gain access to your MIDI session.\nThe system provides only a rudimentary type of authentication using IP numbers rather than passwords or keys. This keeps it simple, and the risks are relatively low, because generally the worst that could happen is some intruder could ruin your music performance. It is not recommended to use the MIDI Network to control hospital equipment, nuclear reactors, or giant robots, though I've done at least one of those things.\n", "Q: How to auto mount encrypted USB sticks after hibernate? I use 2 tiny USB sticks as extra storage space on my Mac. When I close the lid, I send the Mac to hibernate mode. Is there a way such that I auto mount the encrypted USB sticks right after I unlock the Mac?\nWhat I currently do, is simply detach and put in again the USB sticks, so they are automatically mounted and decrypted. But that is obviously pretty annoying.\n\nA: You can use a program called ControlPlane to automatically eject your USB drives when the system going to sleep.\n", "Q: Why doesn't my iPad support Low Battery Mode? As advertised with the release of iOS 9, Low Battery Mode can be activated on most modern iPhones to conserve power.\nMy question is, why doesn't the iPad support Low Battery Mode? It would seem to have the capability to – is there an official or proven answer as to why not?\n(I am using an iPad Air 2)\n\nA: 'Why' is always difficult to answer.\nThat it doesn't appear to work on iPads would seem to be of concern to many people, but there doesn't appear to be any answer as to why.\nSee Where’s The Low Power Mode in iPad, iOS 9 Users Want To Know or\nLow Power Mode Not Available on iPad in iOS 9: No Solution Till Now & others on Google. No-one seems to have any answers.\n\nA: The other answers try to answer the question as asked.\n\n2022 update:\nLow Power Mode finally became available on iPads starting with iPadOS 15.\n(iPads running older versions of iOS, back to at least iOS 11, can enable it if they are jailbroken.)\n\nA: iPads already have so much battery life, and generally they are not used as a means for emergency communication, like the iPhone. There would be more of a need for iPhones, because it can be more costly if they die. I also think Apple wants iPads to always be running at full power, and low power mode disables some features that decrease CPU usage and such things like that. That is my speculation at least.\n", "Q: How do I get Spotlight to find apps in non-standard folders? My work computer has a handful of personal applications that I store not in /Applications, and not in ~/Applications, but in another folder (/usr/local/data/Applications) for several reasons. However, despite this folder being within Spotlight's search index (it's not excluded from Spotlight's index), Spotlight doesn't find the apps there when searching.\nIs there any way to address this? Does Spotlight have a preference list property for \"list of directories that I know contain apps\" or something?\n\nA: Based on a bug report filed with legacy-homebrew, it appears that even using the command line to tell Spotlight to index the /usr/local hierarchy doesn't work. Apple considers this a system directory and so it won't be indexed.\n", "Q: SSH problem after security update 2016-001 with an Ethernet to USB adapter After installing security update 2016-001 whenever a remote server outputs a lot of text very fast, the SSH connection is dropped with this error message:\nCorrupted MAC on input.\ndebug3: send packet: type 1\nssh_dispatch_run_fatal: Connection to XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX port 22: message authentication code incorrect\n\nThis happens when using an Ethernet-USB adapter only (which was fine previously,) over wifi it works fine.\n\nA: It turned out to be an issue with the Ethernet adapter or its driver (TP-Link Gbit USB3 adapter.) After that update it just started dropping packets sporadically, whereas another adapter was working just fine. Unfortunately, the latest version of the driver was published in October 2015, so no fix for this one.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Early 2015 barely charging I got a second-hand MBP about a week ago and today I noticed that when I ran the battery to around 50% it wouldn't charge back. I installed coconutBattery and it shows the charging rate fluctuating at 0-10W.\n\nHow do I make my MBP charge properly? Could this be due to faulty charger? I already tried a SMC reset.\n\nA: Just to clear this up, this was a 13'' MBP. \nI've tested with other chargers and other people's MacBooks and found out my charger was faulty. Got a new one and everything is fine.\n\nA: That charge rate does seem low, but I am no expert.  Do you have the original charger?  Also, which machine do you have?  \nThere are different chargers for the 13 and 15 inch models.  The 15 inch models are 85 Watt chargers and the 13 inch models are 60 watts.\nAs for the chargers going bad, yep they die all the time.  Usually the cable frays, but the components in the charger also die from time to time.\n", "Q: Profile manager pending on some devices I have this problem that most of the options in the system preferences are greyed out, even when I log in as an admin. \nBut I need to log in to my iCloud account to get some software to run on these machines. So I changed the restrictions payload and tried to push it. \nBut for some reasons only 4 of the 12 Macs will update the settings. \nAll Macs are turned on and connected to the local network and the internet. \nI tried to figure out if any settings on the machines 1-4 are different from 5-12. The IP is manually inserted with the same DNS server address. They are all running on 10.10.5 and even the caching seems to work. The protocol on the server does not give me back any error message. \nI can not even remove the device from profile manager.\nWhat could it be? Port problem? Certificate? \nI don't know what to search for. Any suggestions how to get into system preferences? Terminal works if I log in as admin. \n\nA: As an admin you may be able to bypass the managed preference settings. Log out and then back in while holding the Option key. If allowed you'll see a dialog allowing you to disable managed preferences.\nAs far as the clients not receiving the profiles check the system.log file for errors. Look for entries from mdmclient. On the server, check the Profile Manager logs in Server.app or in /Library/Logs/ProfileManager/ probably starting with the profilemanager.log file.\nIs this a user-level profile or a device-level profile? I think user user-level profiles are only installed when the user logs in.\nIf all else fails you can try removing all profiles:\nsudo profiles -D\n\n", "Q: Messages on iPod touch 5 not working Before the messages app on my iPod 5 with iOS 9 was working fine, but yesterday I was signed out for some reason.

I had to do this because I had more than 500gb of photos. \nNow they are all imported to the photos application, and I have verified they are synced up to the cloud.\nIs it safe at this point to delete the photo database file from my external HDD, and then reopen the Photos application and start from scratch using my Mac's HDD with \"optimize storage\" enabled?\nI assume it would just download everything from the cloud in a storage optimized way.\n\nA: Don't do anything with the external hard drive yet, except eject it and unplug it, so you have a good backup in case anything goes wrong. That said, the following steps should do what you want.\nFirst create a new library on your Mac's hard drive by holding Option while you open Photos, then clicking Create New.\nIn order to use this with iCloud Photo Library (ICL), you must designate the new library as the system photo library. Go to Photos menu > Preferences > General tab and click Use as System Photo Library. Next go to the iCloud tab and turn on iCloud Photo Library, then choose the Optimize Mac Storage option.\nAt this point it should start downloading thumbnails and some original files (\"optimized\" means it caches all thumbnails locally, then uses a certain amount of the space available on your hard drive for original files).\nThis answer is based on the Apple support article Designate a System Photo Library which states, at the bottom, that setting a new system library and turning on ICL will merge into (not overwrite) the existing ICL that Apple has stored on their servers. It's possible it might not, and in that case, you may not be able to do what you want.\n", "Q: App Store: Are app names more important or app display names when it comes to searchability? If I register an app named Kim Kardashian and my app display name is also Kim Kardashian, does that hold less/more weight as an app registered as kimkapp with display name Kim Kardashian - Khloe and Kourtney's Celebrity Sister when searching Kim Kardashian in the app store?\nI'm wondering how much value there is in reserving that Kim Kardashian name if the app display name is more important for app store optimization purposes.\nThis:\n\nVs.\n\n\nA: The app display name is taken into consideration when apps are being searched.  However, that's only 1 thing Apple considers when determining what apps and what order apps are returned during a search.  They can also use app review score, how long the apps been in the store, reputation, etc.  \nIn short, nobody outside of App Store staff knows exactly the formula used to determine how search results are displayed.  Right now everyone is just guessing what they think will be returned.  The best thing to do is name your app properly and use the right keywords.  This link will help guide you in doing that: https://developer.apple.com/app-store/search/\nApple just announced they will be limiting app names to 50 characters (not 50 letters so spaces and special characters count).  \n", "Q: Increasing Mavericks Time Machine backup size for remote backups We are using Mavericks OS X server with the Time Machine service. We had originally setup our Time Machine server to limit remote backups (backups of desktops and laptops) to 1,000 GB of space. \nHowever, some machines need 2,000 GB of backup space, so we increased the Time Machine backup destination to 2,000 GB. But, when workstations backup to the OS X server, they complain about not having enough space and the backup size is just a few GB shy of 1,000 (e.g. 992 GB). \nWe restarted the server and the client, but the problem persists. \nOn the client, the backup destination was removed, Time Machine turned off, the destination was added back and Time Machine turned back on but still the problem persists.\nWhy am I not able to get more than 1,000 GB of backup space even though I've configured the Time Machine server to limit to 2,000 GB?\n\nA: Here's what you need to do to resize an existing Time Machine sparsebundle without loosing data on a Time Machine server (OS X Server):\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off Time Machine Server.\n\n*Turn off Time Machine Client(s).\n\n*Resize the disk image and the partition following these instructions. Execute these steps on the server, where the drive is attached if possible.\n\n*After 3 completes, turn on Time Machine Server.\n\n*Remove backup destination on client and add it back.\n\n*Turn on client Time Machine and perform a backup.\n\n\nI followed these steps and I was able to increase my backup destination from 1TB to 2TB without loosing backup history.\nHere are a few issues I ran into and how I worked around them:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Resize Image icon was greyed out in Disk Utility. This was because my logged in user didn't have read/write access to the sparse bundle. Rather than change those permissions, I logged in as that user and could resize image.\n\n*Nothing appeared to happened after I told Disk Utility to resize the image. This is apparently a defect in Disk Utility. While there are no indicators resizing the image worked, if you go to the partitions tab, you will see the image was increased.\n\n*It took 4 days to complete. Increasing the partition size appeared to have kicked off a disk check of sorts. That process and checking multi-linked directories took about 4 days to complete. This was on a directly attached 7,200 RPM drive array attached via USB 3 with about 1TB of backup history.

I'd like my screen shots to only be named with the current date time, preferably in a format like:\n2016-09-02-16:02:48\n\nHow should I go about doing this?\nSo far I've tried inserting an empty string into com.apple.screencapture name\nas shown:\n$ defaults write com.apple.screencapture name \"\"\n$ killall SystemUIServer\n\nBut OSX is still inserting a space as shown below:\n\nSo there's two problems I'm having:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I change the date time format so there are no spaces?\n\n*How do I make sure there is no leading space in the screenshot filename?\n\n\nThanks :)\n\nA: You neither can rename a file to the proposed name - it contains several colons (:) which are reserved (= forbidden) characters in the HFS+ file system - nor does defaults write com.apple.screencapture ... allow a different date format.\nOne idea though is creating a launch agent to rename all files in a dedicated folder starting with \"Screen Shot ...\":\nA very simple solution, assuming you restore the default naming convention for screenshots and replace user_name by your short name below, is then:\nCreate a file named \"screencaprn\" in e.g /usr/local/bin with the content:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmv /Users/user_name/Desktop/Screen\\ Shot*.png /Users/user_name/Desktop/\"`date \"+%Y-%m-%d-%H.%M.%S\"`.png\"; $2>/dev/null\n\nChange permissions:\nchmod +x /usr/local/bin/screencaprn\n\nThen create a launch agent in ~/Library/LaunchAgents with the name \"usr.screenshot.rename.plist\"  and the content:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>usr.screenshot.rename</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/bin/bash</string>\n        <string>-c</string>\n        <string>/usr/local/bin/screencaprn</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>WatchPaths</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Users/user_name/Desktop</string>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThen load the plist with:\nlaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/usr.screenshot.rename.plist\n\nThis works but has a delay of up to 10 seconds (thus changes the seconds and sometimes the minutes of the original named screenshot file e.g. Screen Shot 2016-09-03 at 03.24.02.png to 2016-09-03-03.24.05.png) and adds one com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (usr.screenshot.rename): Service only ran for X seconds.

In fact, you could not mess with System Preferences at all and just get Hazel to rename the screen shot files for you.\nNote: you won't be able to use the : colon character in filenames.\n\nA: j̶u̶s̶t̶ ̶u̶s̶e̶ ̶2̶ ̶c̶o̶m̶m̶a̶n̶d̶s̶:̶ ̶\nd̶e̶f̶a̶u̶l̶t̶s̶ ̶w̶r̶i̶t̶e̶ ̶c̶o̶m̶.̶a̶p̶p̶l̶e̶.̶s̶c̶r̶e̶e̶n̶c̶a̶p̶t̶u̶r̶e̶ ̶n̶a̶m̶e̶ ̶\"̶$̶(̶d̶a̶t̶e̶ ̶+̶%̶Y̶-̶%̶m̶-̶%̶d̶)̶ ̶$̶(̶d̶a̶t̶e̶ ̶+̶%̶H̶-̶%̶M̶-̶%̶S̶)̶\"̶ \ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture \"include-date\" 0\n\nPlease note that you can't use the : in filenames on macos.\nI̶ ̶u̶s̶e̶ ̶2̶ ̶d̶a̶t̶e̶ ̶v̶a̶r̶i̶a̶b̶l̶e̶s̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶a̶c̶h̶i̶e̶v̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶t̶e̶m̶p̶l̶a̶t̶e̶:̶ ̶̶2̶0̶1̶9̶-̶0̶7̶-̶0̶2̶ ̶2̶3̶-̶0̶4̶-̶0̶4̶.̶p̶n̶g̶̶ \nyou can also change the default screenshot location (in my case this is a folder in iCloud)\ndefaults write com.apple.screencapture location \"~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com\\~apple\\~CloudDocs/screenshots\"\n\nUPD: its not correct solution. the name will be the same for each screenshot, and generated date - its the date when you run these command\n\nA: See How do I change the default screenshot name in OS X Lion? for changing the rest of the name. The space is inserted by the string format indicated in the strings file, most likely due to the need for localization of date and time values. If you combine changing the plist name prefix with changing the formatted tinestamp you can make it do whatever you like. \n\nA: Another solution is a long-running daemon that subscribes to the file modification service and changes the filenames when they are created.\n", "Q: Is Mac a computer or an operating system? I encountered this question when taking Apple's online survey:\nMy question is: What does the \"A Mac user\" mean here? Someone using OS X or someone using a MacBook?\n\n\nA: Given the context it's pretty obvious to me that it's referring to the operating system.\nYou wouldn't see a question like \"Do you consider yourself a car driver or a coffee drinker?\"\nThe option of \"Windows\" clearly binds the question as one of operating systems.\nWhile I've not done any research here, I'd be immensely surprised if it wasn't the case that the vast majority of people who use Mac operating systems are also on Mac hardware. So any situation where the clarification is needed can be considered an irrelevant edge case for the purposes of the survey. Such cases are suitably accounted for by the last option.\n\nA: For the canonical / proper definition of Mac, I would defer to the vendor: http://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/trademark/appletmlist.html\n\nMac = computer\nMacintosh =computer\n\n\nA: Mac is the brand of computers (specifically, the hardware) made by Apple. The Macs on sale today are the MacBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac, Mac Pro, and Mac Mini.\nMac computers run on macOS (which was called OS X up until its rebranding in mid-2016). macOS, not Mac, is the equivalent of Windows, but since Apple wouldn't ask \"Are you a macOS user\" (the equivalent of \"Windows user\") and wouldn't ask \"Are you a Windows computer user\" (the equivalent of \"Mac user\"), they use the fairly reasonable grammar found in your screenshot.\nYou can also use an anology to sum it up: Mac is to PC, as macOS (previously OS X) is to Windows.\nTL;DR: The first line of Wikipedia's entry on macOS pretty much sums it up:  \n\nmacOS is a series of graphical user interface–based operating systems developed by Apple Inc. for their Mac line of computer systems.\n\n\nA: It's both. Mac computers (also known as Macintoshes) run macOS.\nNon-Mac computers cannot run macOS (at least not legally), so there is essentially no difference between being a Mac user and being a macOS user. Macs can run other operating systems (including Windows), but someone using a Mac primarily for Windows is quite unusual.\n", "Q: Pages can't open file: error -60005 I have a .pages file I've worked on as recently as May.

I then deleted my trash can and rebooted in regular mode and the problem was fixed. \n", "Q: Macbook Air charging inconsistently I read the related entries. My Mac Air  11\" from 2011 was charging intermittently when plugged in and shutting off suddenly regardless of battery charge level or adapter connection. This problem has been going on for at least a month. I have improved the condition and isolated the possibilities.  SO Now:   \n-I have reinstalled OSX 10.9 (this was updated for firmware etc)\n-Virus Scanned and removed infected files\n-cleaned magsafe and adapter connections\n-replaced battery (which was working perfectly for months before this issue) it is still in very good condition.\n-main disk has been cleaned out and has lots of space\nAfter the cleanup and OSX reinstall this morning, sudden shutoffs seem to have stopped..  If I wiggle the adapter/Magsf connection it will switch its status on the menu bar.    The charging speed and efficiency are inconsistent... then on a hunch I plugged in a USB drive adjacent to the magsafe.  as soon as I did this the battery went into charging mode at what seemed like an average rate...  Magsafe area cooled off..  now after plugging and unplugging I have repeated similar result and my charge has reached 70%.  \nMy only conclusion is possibly a physical problem with the magsafe i/o board (Ac adapter is also new).\nWhat does someone more experienced reckon?\nI'd like to know if there is some more direct way to verify that it is the Magsafe board?  (I live in Japan and they don't want to touch anything because I changed the battery, regardless that I had no warranty left)  also I/o boards are about $90 here,  so I want to exhaust options...\nThanks!\n\nA: i CHANGED THE io board.  it mostly fixed it.  I did some sys maintenance which further improved things.  Finally I realized that my original surmise was correct but that the power supply also hd  faulty cable.  now it runs like new..  mgsfe, as convenient as it seems..  has been  nightmare of cable replacement for me.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro late 2012, want 2 external monitors I know this question has been asked a million times but I can't seem to find the right answer for my MBP late 2012. \nI have 2 monitors. One connects to my Thunderbolt via a Thunderbolt to HDMI cable. It works fine. \nI bought the Elgato Thunderbolt 2 dock believing that I could plug in my Thunderbolt cable into this and then plug my second monitor into the HDMI port. Of course it doesn't work and I'm pretty sure it's not going to work....\nAny thoughts on how I can connect 2 monitors? Both have VGA and HDMI ports. \n\nA: Mactracker lists a 2012 MBP as a 13 inch Retina model (MD212LL/A, MacBookPro10,2) with an Intel GPU and using up to 1 GB of shared memory.\nMactracker also says:\n\nSupports an HDMI-compatible device while using one Thunderbolt\n  display or support for two Thunderbolt displays\n\nIf the model you put down is indeed this one, then you'll need 2 Thunderbolt displays. Or you can run one monitor through the HDMI connection and another one through the Thunderbolt connection.\nWhat this model can't do is run two HDMI monitors which it sounds like you're trying to do.\nI highly recommend both everymac.com and Mactracker as sources of info on older Macs. Both have a wealth of information which would have given you the answer(s) you've been looking for. \n", "Q: Can I decrypt and read a partition without booting it from another mac? I have a HDD with a OS X data partition on it that is encrypted with FileVault. It also contains NTFS and ext4 partitions. This is not a boot partition. My boot partition was on a separate SSD. I can not use the boot partition to boot OS X anymore.\nCan I take out the HDD with the encrypted partition, plug it with a USB dock into a macbook and unlock/read the data?\nNOTE: I just need to recover one small folder from the partition that I could transfer on a usb stick.\n\nA: You can unlock/decrypt and read any FileVault2 volume – either system or data partition – as long as the invisible Recovery HD partition (for a bootable system partition) or a Boot OS X partition (data partition) is still present and a password is known. Both partitions are usually following the respective encrypted partition. Boot OS X is no bootable partition as the name may suggest but a 134.2 MB partition probably holding some informations about the encrypted data partition.\n\nA: Yes, that'll work just fine. The Finder should prompt for the password when you connect the disk. I do the same thing with target disk mode all the time.\n", "Q: iMac Internet Surfing Issue I have an iMac (Retina 5K 27\", Mid 2015) with OS X Yosemite v10.10.2.

This problem is not specifically related to iTunes version 12.4.3, but has been appearing since 12.3.3 far as I can remember. I also had it on OS X 10.11.4 and 10.11.5.\nAll my podcasts from a particular site no longer download.\nI have many other podcasts (from other sources) which have no download issues at all.\nIt seems iTunes on my Mac has problems dealing with HTTP/1.1 redirects (302) for podcasts; I get the little round circle with exclamation mark in front of the podcast, and when i click on it :\n\nI decided to launch Wireshark to see what was happening, and came to the conclusion iTunes seems to have a issues with a redirect it gets from the website.\nThe HTTP/1.1 request from iTunes asks to \nGET http://rf.proxycast.org/1153838588270485504/16256-18.04.2016-ITEMA_20963865-0.mp3\n\nwhich yields an empty page. The server responds with a 302 redirect to \nhttp://media.radiofrance-podcast.net/podcast09/16256-18.04.2016-ITEMA_20963865-0.mp3\n\nwhich is the working podcast indeed. Moreover, when I open that URL in iTunes (File > Open Stream) it works also. Yet despite this working URL, iTunes does not seem to be able to download / play the podcast though the redirect.\nNot even directly from iTunes Store:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/fr/podcast/continent-sciences/id115153984?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4#\nIt happens for all podcasts of that company, which seems to have redirected all its podcasts from rf.proxycast.org to media.radiofrance-podcast.net\nSo my guess is that my iTunes has trouble dealing with this redirect. Unless it is something else, but I don't know what.\nI tried accessing the podcast from another device (PC) and the podcast is all fine.\nReinstalled iTunes, recreated the iTunes .xml file, no change.\nUnsubscribe, delete, resubscribe. Tried many things. Nothing helps.\nAny ideas about where to look?\nHere is the Wireshark TCP stream:\nGET /1179796318600568832/16256-27.06.2016-ITEMA_21019982-0.mp3 HTTP/1.1\nHost: rf.proxycast.org\nConnection: close\nUser-Agent: iTunes/12.4.3 (Macintosh; OS X 10.11.6) AppleWebKit/601.7.7\n\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\nDate: Sat, 03 Sep 2016 11:07:53 GMT\nServer: Apache\nSet-Cookie: e=V8qvCQqAhy4AAX6jDnMAAAGD; path=/; expires=Thu, 28-Sep-17 11:07:53 GMT; domain=.proxycast.org\np3p: policyref=\"/w3c/p3p.xml\",CP=\"NON DSP COR CURa PSA PSD OUR BUS NAV STA\"\nLocation: http://media.radiofrance-podcast.net/podcast09/16256-27.06.2016-ITEMA_21019982-0.mp3\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\n\nEDIT : the podcast URL is http://radiofrance-podcast.net/podcast09/rss_16256.xml\n\nA: The problems turns out to come from my ESET Endpoint Antivirus 6.3.85 (and earlier) on OSX 10.11.6 (and earlier). More particularly ESET's Web Access Protection.\nWhen I disable it, everything works fine. \nTo recap, the problem appears with any software accessing URLs like \nhttp://rf.proxycast.org/1181578500855832576/14489-02.07.2016-ITEMA_21024836-0.mp3 (1)\nThat URL redirects to\nhttp://media.radiofrance-podcast.net/podcast09/14489-02.07.2016-ITEMA_21024836-0.mp3 (2)\nURL (1) actually breaks in iTunes, Safari, Chrome, Firefox.\nURL (2) works fine anywhere.\nI tried excluding the domain \"proxycast.org\" from the URL scanning list, but that does not solve the problem completely.\niTunes still fails to handle correctly the redirect it seems, as does Safari. Chrome and Firefox do play the URL.\nRight now the only, temporarily acceptable workaround I can find is to exclude the IP address of (1) scanning by ESET.\nThis will only work of course until that IP changes.\nSo to conclude:\nThere is an issue linking HTTP redirects, ESET Endpoint Antivirus for Mac OS X, and iTunes for OSX (or Safari). \nPS: I don't have this issue with those podcasts on other machines, Mac and PC, that do not run ESET.\n\nA: I can confirm it was the ESET version.\nWith ESET version 6.4.246 the problem no longer exists.\n", "Q: Quicktime freezes every single time I'm finishing a recording I used to be able to take screencasts with QuickTime just fine for over a year now. But suddenly, every time I try and go above 3 or 4 minutes, by the time I finish, QuickTime just freezes. I can only kill it. When opening it the next time, it presents to me only part of the recording.\nWhat could possibly cause this?\nI got Yosemite v10.10.5 and QuickTime v10.4 (build 833.7)\n\nA: @fbara was right: It is the ram, but it is not obvious. Basically, what I am recording now requires a whole variety of software to be open at the same time, quickly reaching the limits of my Air's 4GB of RAM.\nOnce you use more than 70-80% of your ram, stuff starts getting compressed and swapped, and apparently, Quicktime cannot quite work with that.\nSolution: Get more RAM and send complaint letters to Quicktime for not informing you why your recordings fail.\n", "Q: Is there a way to display how much of the hard drive's read/write capacity is being used? I am interested in understanding how much of my 7200 rpm hard drive's capacity is being used, because sometimes performance is very slow and choppy.\nThe Disk tab in Activity Monitor gives information about Data read/sec and Data written/sec – but is there a way to display such information relative to what it's capable of, e.g. a percentage measure.\nMaybe there is a separate utility that could assist with this? Or perhaps, for technical reasons, this is not the way you measure drive performance?\n\nA: You're reading exactly what you want. A percentage throughput would not give you more information, just less accurate information as to the state of your I/O. Your drive should be pushing about 150MB/s at the most (Spinny disks aren't too fast in general, and worse when mostly used).\nI am interested in helping with your main issue of slow and choppy HDD performance. If this is a MacBook or MacBook Pro unibody non-retina, you may have a degraded SATA cable. My first one went out after 2.5yrs in a 2012 MBP. A friends' went bad after five years in her 2010 MBP. It's very common across the support forums too. If you feel data access has gotten slower, or you've started having issues with freezing, spinning beach balls, and/or crashes and reboots, swap the cable before the drive, or both together. Not changing the cable led to my frustration over the slowness of two day shipping twice too often now.\n", "Q: Can not unlock my MacBook Pro once I locked it with Find my iPhone I thought that i lost my MacBook Pro so I used Find my iPhone to lock it.\nNow that I found it an interrogation point is appearing on my screen \nbut there is nowhere I can write my pin.

When opening documents in iWork'13, the documents are converted and may wind up looking different if they were created in iWork'09 (see Apple support article ”Working with iWork'09 files\"). Documents created with even older versions of iWork can, I believe, not be opened in iWork'13 at all and must first be converted with iWork'09.\nHow can I find all iWork documents on a Mac which haven't been converted yet to iWork'13? Searching for all documents with a particular extension doesn't seem to be possible as iWork'09 and iWork'13 use the same file extensions. \n\nA: I’ve put together an Automator Workflow to find all iWork documents that have not been converted yet. The workflow uses this shell script:\nfind \"${1}\" \\( -iname '*.key' -or -iname '*.pages' -or -iname '*.numbers' \\) -and \\( -type d -or \\( -type f -and -not -exec bash -c 'unzip -qq -l \"${0}\" Metadata/DocumentIdentifier >/dev/null' '{}' \\; \\) \\) -and -print\n\nTechnically this script finds anything with the “key”, “pages” or “numbers” extension which doesn’t look like an iWork’13 document: documents created with iWork’13 are stored as ZIP archives and contain a “DocumentIdentifier”, whereas documents created with iWork’09 are ZIP archives without this “DocumentIdentifier”. The script also matches on directories, as the first versions of iWork stored documents as package directories.\nThe last action in the workflow creates an alias to the documents found by the script, making it easy to browse the results in the Finder. I recommend you change the action to use another folder than the Desktop though, as there may be a lot of results.\nEdit: I have learned that the iWork document format as a ZIP archive with a “DocumentIdentifier” seems to have been introduced in iWork'14 rather than iWork'13, and is only used when saving to a Mac locally, not when saving to iCloud (as mentioned in the Ars Technica review of iWork’14). So the above script finds anything with one of the iWork extensions that does not look like a locally-saved iWork’14 document. I don’t feel a need at the moment to refine the script to only find pre-iWork’13 documents so I will leave it as it is. \n\n", "Q: How do I back system and application settings up on my Mac? I want to reinstall OS X completely on my machine. \nI have backed up all of my documents and made a list of applications that I have, so that I can install them later.\nHowever, one thing that I do not know how to do is how to back my settings up. On a previous occasion, I tried to back the ~/Library/Preferences folder up and restored it on the clean installation, but for the most part it didn't work.\nHere are some examples of the scope of what I would like to back up:\n\n\n*\n\n*System settings (e.g. trackpad options, sentence highlight color, dock options, three-finger drag option, Accessibility options, etc)\n\n*Keyboard shortcuts (also a part of system settings)\n\n*Printers that I have added (important for me)\n\n*System app preferences (Finder, Safari, Preview, etc.)\n\n*Third-party app preferences (Little Snitch preferences/rules, Bartender preferences, Amphetamine, etc.)\n\n\nI don't need to back things like Safari bookmarks, emails or calendars up as I use iCloud for them.\nDoes anyone have any good suggestions on how to do this effectively?\n\nA: Use Time Machine. I know it sounds a little snarky, but this is really exactly what it's for. With a current Time Machine Backup, you can install OS X and then restore from your backup... et voila!\nTime Machine has crafted exclusions to not backup files that are either counterproductive or unnecessary when restoring a backup onto a clean installation. \n\nA: Alternatively if you have an external drive you can back up all of your user profile (all the drive if you want too...) and then once MacOS is reinstalled use the Migration Assistant.app to migrate all your settings using the backup as the source, easy peasy.\n", "Q: .profile configured, no error message, but no change New to editing my .profile, so please bear with me if my question seems somewhat trivial.\nI downloaded software to convert a proprietary data to ASCII, the software being from Trimble.

Moved that file to my USB flash drive using Rufus, and when I boot while holding the option key my flash drive isn't recognized. Not sure what else to do but Bootcamp only supports Windows 8 or later.\n\nA: I assume your MacBook Air is 2015 or newer model. If so, then you can not install Windows 7 on this model. The reason is that Windows 7 requires a BIOS boot method and Apple removed the ability to BIOS boot operating systems starting with the 2015 model year Macs.\nThe instructions for installing Windows 8.1 are given at the Apple web site: Use Windows 8.1 on your Mac with Boot Camp.\nThe instructions for installing Windows 10 are given at the Apple web site: Use Windows 10 on your Mac with Boot Camp.\n", "Q: Space with Hiragana Input For whatever reason Memrise requires you to input a space character in some Japanese answers (I'm very much a beginner, so this may not be as weird as I think). However when I have my input set to Hiragana with Romaji typing method, pressing space converts what I've already typed into Kanji even though I have Live Conversion disabled (I think that's what it's doing, they're not Kanji I recognize but I don't know what else they might be). Obviously this is very annoying as I keep getting answers wrong when all I'm missing is a space or I'll have random Kanji in the middle of what I'm typing.\n\nA: It turns out that holding shift while pressing space will input a normal space character if you have the Shift key action set to Enter Romaji mode.\n", "Q: Syncing Contacts to iOS on Mac OS X 10.6 What is the oldest Mac OS version that can do iCloud sync from Contacts/Address Book to a current iOS 9 device (iPhone SE, in this case)? The goal is to sync contacts between my Macbook running OS X 10.6 and my iPhone.\nIf iCloud sync is not possible, what synchronization options in 10.6 would allow for contact synchronization to current iOS?\n\nA: According to http://www.apple.com/icloud/setup/mac.html iCloud requires 10.7.5 or later. \nSince iCloud encrypts data between the client and the server, you won't find third party options. I would get whatever software you need on 10.6 upgraded and then upgrade the OS or set up virtualization to run 10.6 from within a newer OS if iCloud data sync is needed. \nPerhaps you could find a different cloud sync between to that's likely more work and aisle than the above. \n\nA: As bmike pointed out, iCloud requires OS X 10.7.5 or later, so syncing Contacts via iCloud is not an option for you.\nHowever, iOS can sync contacts seamlessly through other services, notably Gmail, Yahoo Mail, and Outlook. Since I sync contacts through Gmail, I've provided a guide to help you get started.\nIf you have preexisting contacts in iCloud\n\n\n*\n\n*Export your contacts out of iCloud as a vCard. Here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to icloud.com in any web browser and sign in to your iCloud account.\n\n*Click on Contacts.\n\n*Click on any contact in the All Contacts section and then hit Command+A to select all of your contacts (or Control+A if you happen to be using a Windows computer).\n\n*Click on the gear icon in the lower left-hand corner.\n\n*Click on Export vCard.\n\n*Choose to save the vCard on your Desktop.\n\n\n*Import your contacts into Gmail. Here's how:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to mail.google.com in any web browser and sign in to your primary Gmail account.\n\n*Click on the Mail drop-down menu near the top-left of the Gmail window and choose Contacts. \n\n*Go to the More button and select Import.\n\n*Click Choose file and find the vCard you saved to your desktop in Step 1.\n\n\n*Go to the Settings app on iOS, and go to Mail, Contacts, Calendars (on iOS 9 or earlier) or Contacts (on iOS 10). If you don't yet have your primary Gmail account setup on your iPhone, follow these instructions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Hit Add Account (on iOS 9) or Accounts -> Add Account (on iOS 10). \n\n*Choose Google, and sign into your primary Gmail account (the one you added your contacts vCard to) on the following screens. \n\n*Back out all the way to Mail, Contacts, Calendars / Contacts to continue.\n\n\n*Tap on the Gmail account you just added, then toggle Contacts on. Back out one step, then toggle Contacts off for iCloud. (Choose Delete from my iPhone if the prompt appears.)\n\nIf you don't have preexisting contacts\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Settings app on iOS, and go to Mail, Contacts, Calendars (on iOS 9 or earlier) or Contacts (on iOS 10). If you don't yet have your primary Gmail account setup on your iPhone, follow these instructions: \n\n\n*\n\n*Hit Add Account (on iOS 9) or Accounts -> Add Account (on iOS 10). \n\n*Choose Google, and sign into your primary Gmail account (the one you added your contacts vCard to) on the following screens. \n\n*Back out all the way to Mail, Contacts, Calendars / Contacts to continue.\n\n\n*Tap on the Gmail account you just added, then toggle Contacts on.

OS X Yosemite introduced Extensions, which are listed in the Extensions panel in System Preferences. Currently, the list of \"Actions\" extensions on my OS X system contains only one item, \"Markup\".\nHow can I find more applications and utilities that can be installed as extensions? Is there a categorical list of extensions somewhere?\nI tried searching the Mac App Store as well as Googling in general, but \"extensions\" is such a general term that it produces far too many unrelated results and makes it difficult to find true system extensions. Ideally, I'd like to find a list specifically about proper extensions (if such a list exists), or a better way to search for them (if there is one).\n\nA: You can search the Mac App Store for apps supporting a specific extension type. For example, searching for appex:com.apple.share-services will show apps that support the share extension. Not all macOS apps are distributed through the Mac App Store, so this isn't an exhaustive list.\nCommon Mac Extension Types are listed below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Action: com.apple.ui-services\n\n*Audio Unit: com.apple.AudioUnit-UI\n\n*Content Blocker: com.apple.Safari.content-blocker\n\n*Document Provider: com.apple.fileprovider-ui\n\n*Finder Sync: com.apple.FinderSync\n\n*Photo Editing: com.apple.photo-editing\n\n*Share: com.apple.share-services\n\n*Today: com.apple.widget-extension\n", "Q: Script or workflow to modify find and replace backslashes in clipboard I need to do a lot of copying filepaths written by people using a PC (which uses backslashes) to a Mac (which uses forward slashes), and I'm tired of manually switching them every time.  I have to copy the filepath from our shared web browser, paste it into my file browser, and then go in and manually remove the backslash and replace it with a forward slash.\nThat last part is really what's killing me since basically every filepath I copy has several backslashes in it that I want to paste! What I want is something that will modify the contents of my clipboard so I can just paste it into my Mac file browser without having to manually replace the slashes every time.\nIn short, I want any \"\\\" in my clipboard to change to a \"/\" before I paste it. Can anyone please help me with this?\n\nA: Using an Automator Service and AppleScript code, here are two examples of how you can change backslashes to slashes in a string.\nThe first one takes the selected text passed to the Automator Service, makes the replacements and sets the output to the Clipboard. Which from there you can manually paste wherever you desire that can accept pasted text.\nThe second one takes the selected text passed to the Automator Service, makes the replacements and then replaces the selected text passed with the modified text in place, that is providing the source selected text is editable.\nThere is a slight code difference between the two, in the on run subroutine and a single setting difference between the services. Both require first selecting a text string and then either a right-click to select the service from the Context menu or accessing the service from the Application_Name > Services > menu. The on replaceText(find, replace, textString) subroutine is the same in both examples.\nAppleScript code for the Clipboard method service:\non run {input}\n    set the clipboard to replaceText(\"\\\\\", \"/\", input as string)\nend run\n\non replaceText(find, replace, textString)\n    set prevTIDs to AppleScript's text item delimiters\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to find\n    set textString to text items of textString\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to replace\n    set textString to \"\" & textString\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to prevTIDs\n    return textString\nend replaceText\n\n\nAppleScript code for the replace selected text method service:\non run {input}\n    set input to replaceText(\"\\\\\", \"/\", input as string)\n    return input\nend run\n\non replaceText(find, replace, textString)\n    set prevTIDs to AppleScript's text item delimiters\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to find\n    set textString to text items of textString\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to replace\n    set textString to \"\" & textString\n    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to prevTIDs\n    return textString\nend replaceText\n\n\nTo use the AppleScript code in an Automator Service:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Automator, create a new Service with Service receives selected text in any application and Input is entire selection, then either leaving unchecked the [] Output replaces selected text check box for the clipboard service (AppleScript code for the Clipboard method service:) or checking the [√] Output replaces selected text check box for the for the replace selected text service (AppleScript code for the replace selected text method service:)\n\n*Add a Run AppleScript action to it and delete the default code.\n\n*Copy and paste whichever code for the method you choose to use.\n\n*Save the Service with an appropriate name, e.g., Replace backslashes with slashes on Clipboard for the first one and or Replace backslashes with slashes in selected text for the second one. Or of course whatever you prefer.\nNow select some text that has backslashes in it and then select the service's name from the Services Context menu (right-click) or the Application_Name > Services > menu.\nIf using the Clipboard method, then paste the now modified selected text wherever you want or if using the replace selected text method, it's already replaced having selected that Service.\n\nA: *\n\n*Keep the Windows quoted path entries into a plain text, name it to paths.txt, such as\n \"C:\\Program Files\\xyz\"\n \"C:\\Windows\\System32\"\n\n\n*Then do it in Terminal: \ncat paths.txt | sed -e 's#\\\\#\\/#g' > converted.txt\n\n\n*The result such as\n\"C:/Program Files/xyz\"\n\"C:/Windows/System32\"\n\nif you want to get posix paths, try \ncat paths.txt | sed -e 's#^\\\"\\([a-zA-Z]\\):#\\\"\\/\\1#' -e 's#\\\\#\\/#g' > converted.txt\n\nthe converted result will be:\n\"/C/Program Files/xyz\"\n\"/C/Windows/System32\"\n\n", "Q: How to disable mouse acceleration in OS X El Capitan while allowing mouse pointer speed to be adjusted Bashing Apples (Intro etc)\nSkip to below sections if you are not interested in reading the info about why I posted this question and my criticisms of mouse acceleration.\nI have been searching for an answer to this question for a few days. I have now found a solution to my problem which I am satisfied with, and so I have added a question and answer on askdifferent in the hope of helping future users.\nI struggle with the new OS X mouse driver, with the magic mouse 2, as it has mouse acceleration, which I really, really cannot stand. Perhaps this is subject to personal preference, but for those of us who have been using mice for our entire lives (20 + years) with no acceleration, it is just impossible to adjust to anything different.* If you don't understand my complaint, imagine you have been using a US or UK keyboard layout for your entire life and type without looking at the keyboard, and then your next employer insists that you type only using a French layout keyboard. You wouldn't be very happy in that job, and you wouldn't work efficiently either.\n*I'm not opposed to new ideas, but for me mouse acceleration is a bad one.\nI don't understand why Apple decided to add mouse acceleration without a way of disabling it in the system preferences. I would be interested to know what percentage of the OS X user community have serious problems with it, and what percentage have just re-learned how to use a mouse.\nAnyway, hate to appear to be a biased Apple basher, but this is one of a few reasons why I don't use an OS X computer to do my serious work.\nCommonly Referenced Solution (Doesn't work)\nThe commonly quoted solution is to type\ndefaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.mouse.scaling -1\n\ninto the terminal. This does disable mouse acceleration, but leaves the mouse completely useless for many users as it then tracks extremely slowly. Again, this is down to personal preference, but I work in a lab, and there is always a chronic shortage of desk space. I have about 15cm of mousepad available while typing this right now. So I can't feasibly work with a mouse which tracks this slowly.\nSolution I found to be usable\nI searched for Magic Mouse 2 alternative driver and found smoothmouse.com. I'm in no way associated with this project, and I don't like to advertise software in my answers to questions on stack exchange websites, however in this case the package is free, so I will make an exception. (You don't have to pay anything.)\nAfter installing, there is a new icon in system preferences. The tool allows you to completely disable mouse acceleration, and set a mouse tracking rate. I assume the range of values available will be suitable for most users.\nIt is fairly simple and there are no other configuration options, however if you are like me and want to disable mouse acceleration while allowing the pointer movement rate to be adjusted, then this should work for you.\nSummary\nI hate to be another Apple basher, but there are things I love and hate about my Mac, which has been used as a very expensive iPod for the last 4 years (essentially since I got it).\nThis is the end of my question, and answer, however I would like to share a few more details about my experience of Mac and OS X because I feel they are relevant to the question. In addition, I hope someone who works for Apple picks up on this question at some point in the future, and says \"Hey, guys, we've got a problem here, which is frustrating some of our users.\"\nSo here is a brief history of my experiences. I am employed in science and most of my work involves processing data and writing programs to do so. Occasionally I like to use GIMP to create a Meme. I also write a lot of documents in TeX/LaTeX or using Office programs. Sometimes I even edit data using a spreadsheet program. These are all things which Mac and OS X do not do very well.\nNow, to present a fair argument, there are some things OS X does do extremely well. Browsing the internet, replying to (short) emails, watching Youtube videos and playing music with iTunes are the most common examples of things I do, which Mac and OS X allows me to do efficiently. Unfortunately my phone does the first 3 better (except the DAC sound quality is probably inferior, not that it makes a difference for youtube audio quality).\nThe reason why OS X makes it difficult for me to edit large amounts of text is that I make spelling and typing errors. To correct an error, I have to move the mouse and right-click to get a list of corrections, or double click to highlight the word and replace it. On a linux machine, I don't have to move my hands away from the keyboard, as I have a right click context menu key where the (right side of space) command key is on an OS X keyboard. I don't have that on OS X, and this is a big efficiency issue for me when working. As a consequence, I don't like to write programs or type documents or reply to long emails using OS X. I haven't found a solution to this yet, but if someone knows of one I would be very grateful to know.\nFinally, I mentioned editing images with GIMP. I find it very difficult (impossible) to do this using a trackpad, which is why I recently bought a Magic Mouse 2. This is why I suddenly found there are issues with not being able to disable mouse acceleration, and why I posted this question and answer.\n\nA: An exact copy-and-paste of the answer in the question above is below. You will not miss any information by not reading this answer and reading the above question.

Is there a benefit to copying (with Carbon Copy Cloner) large amounts of data (400 GB) from one physical drive to another (both WD My Passport external USB 3.0 HDD), rather than to a separate partition / volume on the source drive?\nI imagine that using the same drive might be slower, since it must do both read and write. While with separate drives, each drive does only read or only write, so maybe it's faster.\n\nA: Copying data to a different drive negates the risk of losing all your data due to physical failure of your primary drive (as would be the case if you merely partitioned it and used the other partition as a backup). \nSince that’s the principle cause of data loss (way easier to repair a corrupted partition scheme than a broken HDD/SSD), it makes sense that copying data to a different physical device is the most effective method of backing up — it’s the only one in which true redundancy exists. \n", "Q: How to use AppleScript to create a new Rich Text Format file from clipboard text? I have an Automator Service that takes the current text on the clipboard and writes it to a new .txt file.

By original formatting, I am referring to stylistic data such as typographical emphasis (bold, italics, underline), font size, and text color.\nOn a whim, I tried the following command:\ndo shell script \"pbpaste > /path/to/your/clipboard-file.rtf\"\n\nBut this command resulted in an .rtf file that my computer was unable to read or open.\n\nA: This answer has been updated to reflect rubik's sphere's misunderstanding between what Rich Text is (what was originally asked about) and what's actually being worked with from Google Chrome, being HTML. (See comments moved to chat.)\nI'm leaving the original answer as is, and below this new content, as it does technically answer the original question as asked. It also contains relevant information to the overall process of dealing with Clipboard content in the context of the original and modified question.\nThe code below is example code to be tested and run within (Apple) Script Editor, as aside from the first sentence in the question, no explicit and specific usage within Automator has, yet, been given.

It will have all the attributes as the RichText content on the Clipboard has, as it did when copied to the Clipboard.\nOpen Script Editor and copy and paste the code below into a new Untitled document and then run it from Script Editor, reviewing the output in Events/Replies. Run it a couple of times, with and without Rich Text content on the Clipboard and with and without the existence of the file, on the hard drive, defined by set theRichTextFileName ... at the start of the script.\nYou'll see the code makes sure the file doesn't exist, so as not to overwrite an exiting file of the target name and location and if the Clipboard doesn't contain Rich Text content, it displays a message for that too.\nNow if using this in an Automator Service e.g., where Service receives selected rich text, then the code can be modified not to trap for an error if Rich Text content isn't on the Clipboard as the service will not appear on the Services menu if Rich Text is not selected in a document.  Also if you want to overwrite the target file at its designated location the code around that can be removed too. I'll give those code examples as well.\n\nExample code to paste into Script Editor for testing and review:\nset theRichTextFileName to POSIX path of (path to documents folder as text) & \"New RichText Filename.rtf\"\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    if exists theRichTextFileName as POSIX file then\n        tell current application\n            display dialog \"The file \\\"\" & theRichTextFileName & \"\\\" already exists!\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with title \"File Already Exists...\" with icon caution\n        end tell\n    else\n        tell current application\n            try\n                set richTextfromClipboard to get the clipboard as «class RTF »\n            on error eStr number eNum\n                display dialog eStr & \" number \" & eNum buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with title \"No Rich Text Content on Clipboard...\" with icon caution\n                return\n            end try\n            try\n                set fileHandle to open for access theRichTextFileName with write permission\n                write richTextfromClipboard to fileHandle\n                close access fileHandle\n            on error eStr number eNum\n                display dialog eStr & \" number \" & eNum buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with title \"File I/O Error...\" with icon caution\n                try\n                    close access fileHandle\n                end try\n                return\n            end try\n        end tell\n    end if\nend tell\n\n\nExample code to use in an Automator Service e.g., where Service receives selected rich text:\nset theRichTextFileName to POSIX path of (path to documents folder as text) & \"New RichText Filename.rtf\"\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    if exists theRichTextFileName as POSIX file then\n        tell current application\n            display dialog \"The file \\\"\" & theRichTextFileName & \"\\\" already exists!\" buttons {\"OK\"} default button 1 with title \"File Already Exists...\" with icon caution\n        end tell\n    else\n        tell current application\n            set richTextfromClipboard to get the clipboard as «class RTF »\n            set fileHandle to open for access theRichTextFileName with write permission\n            write richTextfromClipboard to fileHandle\n            close access fileHandle\n        end tell\n    end if\nend tell\n\n\nExample code to use in an Automator Service e.g., where Service receives selected rich text and overwrites existing target file:\nset theRichTextFileName to POSIX path of (path to documents folder as text) & \"New RichText Filename.rtf\"\n\ntell current application\n    set richTextfromClipboard to get the clipboard as «class RTF »\n    set fileHandle to open for access theRichTextFileName with write permission\n    write richTextfromClipboard to fileHandle\n    close access fileHandle\nend tell\n\n\nThe image below is of an example Automator Service that creates the New RichText Filename.rtf file from selected Rich Text from the Create Rich Text file from Clipboard service on the Services Context menu (by right-click) or Application_name > Services > menu, when Rich Text is selected in a document.\n\n\nNow these are just examples and additional logic can be coded to tailor it to meet ones needs. As an example, code could be added to automatically increment an existing file's name so as not to overwrite it, or prompt for a new file name and complete the operation vs. aborting with a message that the file already exists, etc.\n\nUpdate for use with a do shell script command:\nIf you really want to do it using a do shell script command, then use the following code while replacing /path/to/new rich text file.rtf with a valid path filename to a location you have write permissions. Note not to remove the \\\" before and after /path/to/new rich text file.rtf in the actual command as this handles the path filename if containing spaces. If the path filename does not contain spaces, then the \\\" before and after /path/to/new rich text file.rtf does not need to be used.\ndo shell script \"osascript -e 'try' -e 'get the clipboard as «class RTF »' -e 'end try' | awk '{print substr($0, 12, length($0)-13)}' | xxd -r -p > \\\"/path/to/new rich text file.rtf\\\"\"\n\nHere's the command line showing as wrapped text, for easier viewing:\ndo shell script \"osascript -e 'try' -e 'get the clipboard as «class RTF »' -e 'end try' | awk '{print substr($0, 12, length($0)-13)}' | xxd -r -p > \\\"/path/to/new rich text file.rtf\\\"\"\n\n\n*\n\n*While one can copy and paste (recommend) the code, nonetheless here's how to type the Double Angle Quotation Marks, which are also available under Parentheses in (Special) Characters, e.g. optioncommandT in TextEdit. \nNote: Keep in mind the spacing in «class RTF » is meant to be offset in this use case.\n\n\n*\n\n*Typing Double Angle Quotation Marks\n\n\n*\n\n*« Left Double Angle Quotation Mark, press: option\\\n\n*» Right Double Angle Quotation Mark, press: shiftoption\\\nNote that, as written, this do shell script command overwrites the output file if it already exists, without prompting! It will either be a zero length file if the Clipboard does not contain any Rich Text content, otherwise the file will be of necessary length to contain the Rich Text content from the Clipboard. Obviously, additional logic could be coded into the osascript command however if you need more complexity then this you're better off using the method first presented in this answer. Or using an external script being called by do shell script command that handles all the necessary logic and error handling based on the complexity of the overall conditions this will be applied under.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why such complexity vs. do shell script \"pbpaste > /path/to/clipboard-file.rtf\"?\n\n\nThat's a good question and while pbpaste does have the -Prefer {txt | rtf | ps} option, nonetheless pbpaste -Prefer rtf may not output Rich Text even if it exists on the Clipboard. Or what it does output, if not ASCII Text, will not be a form of Rich Text that is understood, by e.g TextEdit, and or will not contain all the Rich Text attributes if any, that the Clipboard content contains.\nThis makes it necessary to get the Rich Text content on Clipboard in a different manner and why get the clipboard as «class RTF » is being used instead. When using a do shell script command with this, it requires additional processing to utilize the data returned, as it's in a data wrapper when returned and not immediately usable, thus requires further processing.\nAs an example, Hello World! in Rich Text on the Clipboard can look like this in ASCII Text:\n{\\rtf1\\ansi\\ansicpg1252\\cocoartf1187\\cocoasubrtf400\n{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fnil\\fcharset0 ComicSansMS;}\n{\\colortbl;\\red255\\green255\\blue255;}\n\\pard\\tx720\\tx1440\\tx2160\\tx2880\\tx3600\\tx4320\\tx5040\\tx5760\\tx6480\\tx7200\\tx7920\\tx8640\\pardirnatural\n\n\\f0\\b\\fs36 \\cf0 Hello World!}\n\nThe above format unfortunately is not easily usable, if at all, in AppleScript and I believe that's why being grabbed as Hex encoded data is required.\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm basing this on the fact that even though the get clipboard info command for the Clipboard content in this example returns {«class RTF », 265} among the info returned, nonetheless while the ASCII Text form of this Rich Text content is 265 bytes long it is returned in Hex format at over twice the bytes with the data wrapper.  The fact that it's returned in Hex by get the clipboard as «class RTF » in both the Script Editor or using osascript support this supposition.\n\n\nHere's the same Hello World! in Rich Text on the Clipboard in Hex:\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nHowever, what's returned by get the clipboard as «class RTF » for the Hello World! example above is:\n«data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»\nThe Hex encoded string is in a «data RTF » wrapper which needs to be removed before converting the Hex encoded content to ASCII Text to be written to a disk file by the use of I/O Redirection, e.g.>, in the do shell script command example above.\nSo, the output of osascript -e 'try' -e ' get the clipboard as «class RTF »' -e 'end try' gets piped (|) to awk where it creates a substring, printing only the Hex encoded content itself, not the data wrapper portion, as that would not be processed properly by xxd in the next step of the process.\nIt then has to be piped (|) to xxd for conversion to ASCII Text to be written to a disk file using I/O Redirection, e.g.>, to the target path filename. \nThe image below is of Clipboard Viewer toggling between ASCII Text and Hex encoding views, showing Hello World! copied from a Rich Text Document, the one used in this example.\n\n\nI hope this provides a better understanding of how AppleScript works with Rich Text content on the Clipboard, as either way conversion from a Hex encoded string to ASCII Text has to take place and this is being done transparently in the original example code while requiring additional processing outside of AppleScript code being processed by osascript when using the do shell script command in this context.\n\nA: RTF files, unlike TXT files, are not just plain text but have a basic structure. To create an RTF file, use the following structure (instead of just the plain text from your keyboard):\n{\\rtf1\\ansi\\deff0 {\\fonttbl {\\f0 Verdana;}}\n\\f0\\fs16\nHello World!\n}\n\nSource: https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/rtf-pocket-guide/9781449302047/ch01.html\n\nA: \nHere's functions based on the answer by user3439894 for printing the rich text version of the clipboard converted to HTML or the HTML version of the clipboard.

A valuable feature of the Google Play Store is the ability to command a device you've signed in on to download an app without needing to go searching for the app on the device. I would like to do the same on iOS, but the iTunes Preview interface doesn't look like it supports signing in and cuing up app downloads on a device. Is it possible to tell an internet-connected iOS device to download an app from your computer either online or through the iTunes store browser?\n\nA: Yes - iOS supports this out of the box with many MDM frameworks to push updates to iOS devices over the air. There are some free / open source MDM, but I would recommend something hosted like bushel that has better support and has been running a while. \n\n\n*\n\n*http://bushel.com\nIf you need to host the MDM yourself, Apple's server app includes Profile Manager and would be my recommendation for your first server.

Since there are no more free ports on the Macbook, my question is:\nWould this configuration work?\nMacBook TB Port -> TB Display -> 2nd TB Display (Daisy chain)\nMacBook TB Port -> Cinema Display (Via Mini DisplayPort)\n\nUpdate: Please note that Apple's official claim (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204154#18) being able to only connect up to 2 displays has been proved wrong by connecting a 3rd display via HDMI: How many external displays can I power with the 15\" retina MacBook Pro?\nSo, I wouldn't rely to much on what Apple says.\n\nA: No. The Thunderbolt 2 controller will only support two displays max, no matter how to you connect them to the TB2 ports. If you want a third display and HDMI is not an option, you are going to have to use one of those USB display adapters. \n\nA: According to Apple's FAQ - no, two external displays is all that's supported.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204154#18\nYou might try connecting them anyhow since often you can still get signal but it won't refresh at full speed or you might not like the performance.

Displays connected via Mini DisplayPort video adapter or cable to the Thunderbolt port of an Apple Thunderbolt Display will not work.\n\nSo you'll need a USB to whatever adapter for the third display unless you can daisy chain the Thunderbolt displays.

This is similar to how you would expect the middle-button to paste when using for example Linux.\nSo jitouch is not really triggering a special command or sending a non-standard event - it is really just sending the middle-button click event as usual.

I'm guessing that symbol hndl_unix_scall64 is near where the calls go wrong.\nUpdated 2016-09-04: added examples of original and destination paths. Also, add this diagnosis finding.  When I use Picard's internal scripting to truncate the length of its path segments to 160 characters, then the file saving succeeds. The afpfs_FindForkRef failed -1 are still poured into the console log by the hundreds, but only for a couple of seconds. Then they stop, and Picard does not hang. So, the overall length of the path, or the length of segments of the path, may be relevant.\n\nA: From experimenting, here's a workaround.\nUse Picard's scripting to limit the length of each segment of the path to which you rename the music files. This prevents the hang from lasting long, which answers one of the questions. \nIn Picard's File Naming options, use the script function $truncate(field,length) to limit the size of each path segment. Thus, instead of:\n$if2(%albumartistsort%,%artist%)/%album/\n  $if($gt(%totaldiscs%,1),%discnumber%)$num(%tracknumber%,2) %title%\nuse this (and the limit 160 is arbitrary; 300 and 100 also seem to work):\n$truncate($if2(%albumartistsort%,%artist%),160)/$truncate(%album%,160)/\n  $truncate($if($gt(%totaldiscs%,1),%discnumber%)$num(%tracknumber%,2) %title%,160)\nThere is no evidence that the hang is a state problem. It seems to be provoked reproducibly by the behaviour of the application. So, apart from changing the script you have Picard run, there is no need to reset the computer or server. That answers another of the questions.\nThis still does not answer what causes this hang, and how to prevent it at the root cause.\n", "Q: Universal clipboard between macOS sierra and iOS 10 doesn't seem to work okay! I've installed macOS sierra (beta) on my MBP & iOS 10 (beta) on my iPhone 5S. Both of them have the latest release. I've connected them in the same wifi network and Bluetooth connection is also active on both of them. So the two-way copy-paste should work seamlessly on these devices. The problem is, copying on MBP & pasting on iPhone works fine but the reverse doesn't. What to do to make this working?? \n\nA: I solve the problem by restarting the iPhone 6. Then Universal Clipboard works as expected.\n", "Q: panorama photos on iPhone 6 are too narrow I'm trying to take panorama photos with the camera of the iPhone 6s and the resulting files are shorter than what I am seeing when I capture. \nThe photo I've attached (scaled down because upload-limit) should have an angle of estimated 160 degrees instead of maybe 110 degrees. Basically, the image saved is shorter than the preview indicates on the phone. \nBut when I open the image in the Mac photo-app it shows only the first part. So to say: The beginning of the desired panorama. The rest (further to the left of what is shown) is somehow gone.\nI'm doing it exactly the way it is explained in several youtube-videos: Keeping the arrow as exact as possible over the line while turning the device.\nAm I doing something wrong or what troubleshooting approaches work to get a wider panorama photo?\n \n\nA: What I have figured out myself by trying:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold the iPhone vertical (Portrait mode). \n\n*Start the picture-taking by pressing the software button.\n\n*Turn the phone in the direction in which the arrow points. \nMove the phone rather slow but steadily.\nKeep the tip of the arrow as close on the line as possible.\nYou are shown some kind of thumbnail image. That is the panorama view which you got already recorded. If the whole thing works you can see how the panorama view grows.\nBy the way: \nYou can change the direction of the arrow before you start the picture-taking by tipping on the arrow.\n\n\n*Finalise the picture-taking by pressing the software button again.\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to filter Activity Monitor by unresponsive applications? It can sometimes be a slight nuisance to scroll through the whole list in Activity Monitor to find unresponsive applications – especially when this happens often and there's a lot of processes going on.\nSearching for \"red text\" as a visual cue is what I usually do. But is there some neat way to filter, or sort, the list to easily find unresponsive applications?\nOr, is there some other utility or method, outside of Activity Monitor?\n\nA: When three or more apps are not responsive, it's almost always a symptom of a failure elsewhere. I would select one app and run system diagnostics on it. That gets a full picture of what is wrong and then you can log out and make a list of all the unresponsive apps - they will be the only ones remaining. \nWhen you log in again, start the one app that was hung. You'll quickly know if it has issues or was just waiting for some other resource. In time you can narrow down which apps are \"collateral damage\" and which are primary failures. \n", "Q: MagSafe LED sometimes won't light up I have a Mid 2014 MacBook Pro with Retina Display. As of a week ago, occasionally when I plugged in the MagSafe Adapter, the LED doesn't light up. The problem is fixed by unplugging the power adapter from the MacBook and plugging it back in.\nShould I worry with this? Is it an indicator for something wrong?\nLast time I remember with my previous MBP, I had the same issue and it was getting worse, and then the logic board died.\n\nA: This issue can often be caused by debris in the MagSafe port, I sometimes get small metallic particles, attracted there by the magnet. If this is the case, brushing the port with a dry cotton swab can fix the problem ( see here: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT203207)\n", "Q: TiVo videos on a Mac?

Thanks!\nPS.: I tried to post the link to each solution, but I can't post more than 2 links because of my reputation. If someone needs them, I can share on the comment section.\n\nA: Obviously, Spotlight's index is misbehaving, and you did the right thing using the mdutil command. If repeating that command merely provides the same \"Index is already changing state...\" result, then the situation requires you to manually remove Spotlight's data directory. It's simple enough to do and it's perfectly safe, but it would still be wise to run a backup before proceeding. Then:\n1.) In the Terminal, issue the command\nsudo rm -r /.Spotlight-V100\n\n2.)

Restart (in standard mode) after Safe Mode startup is complete. Spotlight will begin indexing using the preferences you have set for it.\n\nA: In Finder, go up to where it says \"Finder\" in bold in the menubar (upper left) and select \"Preferences.\" Under the \"Advanced\" tab, make sure \"When Performing a Search: Search this Mac\" is selected.\n\nThen go into System Preferences and select \"Spotlight.\" Under \"Search Results,\" make sure everything is checked off.\n\nEDIT #1:\nGo into System Preferences > Spotlight > Security.

I plugged the charger into a PC and its not blinking and there's actually no light at all. How long will it take for it to start again? I really need help and don't know how long it will take.\n\nA: Depending on how depleted it is, it may not charge at all since the battery protection circuit could be completely offline and block power in that mode, effectively disabling all power. I came across this a few times and I fixed it by opening the device and applying regulated power directly to bypass this issue and get the controllers working so it could charge itself and get back into normal working condition.\nIn your case, if it was completely empty and then stored for 8 months, it is possible that this is the situation you're in.  Normally, a small leakage current still flows which allows the charging controller to turn on and make the device start working, but that does not always work. Using a proper charger helps if the device is built to recover only when applied the correct voltage with enough amps.\n", "Q: iTunes Connect: No options when trying to add IAP I'm helping a client set up their application profile on iTunes Connect and am running into a strange issue when trying to create in-app purchases.\nWhen I go to the Features tab and select \"In-App Purchases\", then hit the \"+\" button, a dialog pops up asking \"Select the In-App Purchase you want to create.\" There are no options to select, and there are only two buttons, \"Cancel\" and \"Create\", of which \"Create\" is greyed out.\nThe account is up to date with all agreements and IAP is enabled in the app's provisioning profile.

I wanted to know if there were alternate ways to edit an info.plist file that is inside of a kext file. From a Google search I saw, it seemed like it's not something you can easily edit.\nMid-2010 MacBook Pros have an issue related to the GPU that causes frequent GPU panic crashes. Someone on the Mac Rumors forums posted a solution which involved editing a plist inside of a kext file. This is their solution.\nI specifically need to edit the info.plist file for the AppleGraphicsPowerManagement.kext file which is located in /System/Library/Extensions.\nI was wondering if it would be possible to edit the plist without needing to disable SIP? Thanks in advance for the help.\n\nA: All files under /System/Library is protected by SIP. So in El Capitan you can't do that without disabling it. \nBoot into Recovery HD, open Terminal under Utilities menu, and type:\ncsrutil disable\n\nRestart you computer. Navigate to the kext file, right click Show Package Content. Now go to Contents then you can find the Info.plist file. You might needs to change permission of the file before you can edit it. After you're done, boot into recovery again. Open Terminal and type:\ncsrutil enable\n\nThen reboot and you're done. \nBut in later versions of macOS you may also have SIP enabled and only disable the kext-sign requirement, which may be a bit more secure than having it disabled entirely:\ncsrutil enable --without kext\n\nNote that your changes might be reverted at a macOS update.\n", "Q: Locally save photos and delete from iCloud So I'm trying to delete some photos from iCloud but keep them stored locally on my Mac (and ideally iOS devices but that doesn't really matter so much). Is there a way to do this?  All research I've done shows me how to delete the photos locally but keep them on iCloud!  \nRunning El Capitan 10.11.6 and iOS 9.3.5\n\nA: The easiest way to do this is to make an album into which you put all photos that you want to keep, then drag and drop them from Photos into a folder on your hard drive. After the copy has finished, right-click on the photos in the album then choose Delete (not Remove from Album as that won't delete them from the library). This will remove them from iCloud as well.\nKeeping them on the iOS devices is trickier as there's no separate area to store them. You could create a shared album in Photos, copying the photos into it before deleting them from the regular album. (Shared albums are not included in your regular Photos library, so they won't be copied back to your iCloud Photo Library.) This would then make them available on the Shared tab of any iOS devices that use the same Apple ID, or any users you invite to the shared album for that matter.\n", "Q: Boot Camp External Drive only able to connect to my computer I followed these instructions (Is it possible to use Boot Camp with Windows 10 from an external HDD?) to install Windows 10 to my external SSD (Samsung T3).

I need to connect a MBP 15\" to an external monitor with 2560 x 1080 resolution (this http://www.trustedreviews.com/lg-29ea93-review ).\nI already tried HDMI to HDMI but the text looks very bad (sharp).\nI guess I need to use Thunderbolt to Display Port but I don't know which cable adapter is the correct one.\nThen my question is which is correct connection and what cable do I need to buy?\nThe MBP has:\n\n\n*\n\n*Thunderbolt\n\n*USB 3\n\n*HDMI\nThe monitor has:\n\n\n*\n\n*DisplayPort\n\n*DVI-D Dual Link\n\n*HDMI\n\n*USB 3.0\n\nA: You can connect your monitor to a Thunderbolt port using a DisplayPort to Mini DisplayPort cable like this one; other lengths are available if 3 Feet is not long enough for your purposes.\nI connected my LG 25UM65 (2560x1080 native resolution) to my MacBookPro11,3 (mid 2014 15\" Retina) three different ways, HDMI to HDMI, Thunderbolt to DisplayPort, and Thunderbolt to HDMI. The Thunderbolt to HDMI connection is not useful (the maximum resolution it offers is 1920x1080), but the other two connections both work at 2560x1080@60Hz, and the visual quality is comparable across the two connections (but both look blotchy compared to the Retina display). A UHD display (3840x2160) is a better choice than 2560x1080 to maximize the display quality of Thunderbolt 2 (DisplayPort 1.2).\nIt's possible that a better HDMI cable will improve the display quality (the one I'm using is labeled HDMI HIGH SPEED). You can determine (and change) the resolution and refresh rate from System Preferences (Display) by choosing Scaled rather than Default for display (using the Alt key while choosing Scaled can provide more choices on some displays). A 2015 Mac's HDMI port is capable of driving 2560x1080@60 Hz, provided the display has a suitable HDMI input (HDMI 1.3 is sufficient, but HDMI 1.2 probably isn't). If your display has multiple HDMI inputs, you might try all of them to see if that makes a difference.\n\nA: I also have the LG monitor.  It worked fine HDMI to HDMI, UNTIL I did the upgrade to OS Sierra.  OS Sierra apparently doesn't support that resolution.

Whenever I share images using WhatsApp, the app does not respond until the image share/upload is completed. Nothing works, keyboard or back navigation. The app works as usual after image sharing is completed. I have tested this issue with iPhone 6 and 6s too. What might be the issue ? Is this a bug in WhatsApp ?\n\nA: That sure sounds like the program is designed to work the way you mention if you test the same version of the app against three different devices. \nIf you have current iOS on all devices, the next step would be to contact the developer. When they program the upload, they can choose to let the upload happen in the background or in the foreground. The blocking of the UI indicates they chose to use foreground or that your devices all have disabled background processing for that app.\nYou might check your settings and then if you can't see any way to change the foreground / background context them. \n", "Q: AppleScript in Distiller I found a simple script to run Adobe Distiller on some file.\non run argv\n    with timeout of (8 * 60) seconds\n        tell application \"Acrobat Distiller\"\n            Distill sourcePath item 1 of argv\n        end tell\n    end timeout\nend run\n\nHow can I change page size inside this script?\nOr should I modify x.joboptions file and ask Distiller to reload it?\nHow can I do it?\nI'm new to AppleScript, and the documentation for Distiller API is not enough for me.\n\nA: The right answer is probably this:\nDistill sourcePath in_file destinationPath out_file adobePDFSettingsPath opt_file\n\nAnd the paths have to be absolute, not relative.\n", "Q: iPhone 6s: apps greyed out after restore from another phone's backup So I had an iPhone 5 for a few years.\nI bought a 6s recently and after restoring a backup from my iPhone 5.\nAfter the restore, most of my apps are greyed out.\nWhen I tap an icon, the name of the app switches to \"Waiting\" but nothing seems to happens.\nOn top of that, it seems like my passwords have been lost.

The iPhone 6s is larger then the iPhone 5, so therefor the apps that work on a 5 probably won't work on a 6, or at least they will look a bit weird. Leave the phone connected to the internet and let it do its thing, if after a while the apps are still \"Waiting\" then the only other reason for this is, the apps just aren't compatible. \n", "Q: Terminal - Sudo DD Error I am trying to make a bootable Kali Linux ISO on my MacBook Pro Mid-2012.

The flashdrive I am using is formatted as MS-DOS (FAT) and I am using OS X El Capitan.\n\nA: It appears you specified the of parameter twice. For Mac OS you probably don't want /dev/sdb2 (that's more likely a Linux device).\n\nA: You what to use this syntax:\nsudo dd if=kali-linux-2016.2-amd64.iso of=/dev/diskN bs=1m\n\nWhere N in diskN is the correct number for the external USB drive you're trying to write to.\nIf it's disk1 then use this command:\nsudo dd if=/Users/jordanbaron/Desktop/kali-linux-2016.2-amd64.iso of=/dev/disk1 bs=1m\n\nYou do not nor should you, in this case, use conv=noerror,sync as you do want it to error out if there is an issue, not keep writing. If the whole process doesn't produce an error then all should be good anyway.\nThe reason for bs=1m over bs=512 is it will be more efficient and actually take a little less time as it is not having to constantly seek and write 512 bytes at a time, it's doing it 1 megabyte at a time. (You could even use a higher value.)\nNote: In order to write to the target disk using dd the disk must first be unmounted, not ejected.  Use diskutil unmount diskN or diskutil unmountDisk diskN, where N in diskN is the correct number for the external USB drive you're trying to write to. You might also have to use sudo with the diskutil commmand if necessary.\nLastly, it doesn't matter how the target device is formatted or partitioned as it is going to be overwritten by the ISO Image and will then appear that size and formatted the filesystem the ISO Image is using. The remaining space on the USB drive will not be immediately accessible, although in some cases it can me made accessible afterwards.\n", "Q: Have to press down hard for keys on keyboard to work?

Is there another method for cleaning them better. Or something else that could cause low responsiveness?\n\nA: The link provided in the comment has good advice, but not everyone can take their Apple gear to a professional — this is especially true if you live in a country that does not have an Apple Store or do not live in a larger city. \nSo, if you can't get your laptop to a professional, then you'll have to take care of the keyboard yourself until you can. \n\n\n*\n\n*Double-check your keyboard settings in the System Preferences, you\nmention \"slow keys\" but there are two settings in there: \"key repeat\"\nand \"delay until repeat\" which affect the timing of keystrokes to\nresponse.\n\n*Hook up an external keyboard (any USB keyboard will work, though you\nmay loose some Apple-specific functionality if using an non-Apple\nkeyboard).

Let me explain.\nThe model you have linked to at http://www.lg.com/hk_en/monitor/lg-IPS277L is the Hong Kong model and this has a headphone socket. However, if you were buying the model from another country (let's use Australia as an example) it may not have the headphone socket: http://www.lg.com/au/it-monitors/lg-IPS277L-ips-monitor\nThe model you have linked to is now discontinued, but you can still access the manual downloads etc from: http://www.lg.com/hk_en/support/support-product/lg-IPS277L\nIf you download the manual it seems to confirm the headphone socket exists, but does not make any real mention of this anywhere. However, the same manual is used for both the LG IPS277L and the LG IPS237L (they are identical, one is basically the 24\" model, the other the 27\" model).\nNow, if you happen to read the review on this page about the LG IPS237L, it is clear that for this particular model you can do exactly what you want to do. \nI suspect that as long as you have a Headphone port you will be right.\n\nA: If you want high-grade, super-clear sound, you must keep a purely digital connection, or at least use a TV with an actual line-out and balanced cabling, if you want to go analog.\nAlthough it does sound like you maybe already own the TV, but then want to buy an Apple TV; so if that's the case the answer is very simple, yes that will work, of course assuming your TV has a headphone jack.\nSo in other words, I would suggest buying a different TV; make sure you buy a TV with some type of digital out.  In this sense I think '@norcal Johny' is right-on here, with his answer above.  Surely though if you haven't just already tried this out, you are planning a future purchase or a gift. \nIf you use the setup that you asked about, your audio is likely to get degraded in at least the following steps: \n\n  \n*\n  \n*Internet compression (if applicable) & wireless degredation\n  \n*Poor re-amping from the [likely cheap] headphone-amplifier inside the TV\n  \n*Noize from using unbalanced RCA cables\n  \n*Noize related-to that fact that your plugging a hot signal into a line-input, likely, on your amp.\n  \n\nDISCLAIMER:  Your idea, may actually be the most common way people get audio out of an Apple TV.  It is not suitable for so-called \"audiophile\" listening though, for sure, in my opinion even not for the average cinema fan, if you're really into nice, rich sound.  As well, in my observations, the sound from Apple TV in general is somehow distorted at least slightly, to begin with, perhaps due to the wireless transmission.\n\nA: Knowing your audio cables is important. There are so many variations that I will limit it to what is normal for your situation.\nMost personal and home electronic/audio devices well use or have a variation of the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Headphone jacks (1/8\" or 1/4\")\n\n*RCA jacks \n\n*Digital Audio Cable\n\n\nHeadphone and RCA jacks are the most commonly used methods and will most likely be your best solution. (If you had a hi-end sound system, my recommendation would have been different. [ Digital Audio ])\nMost home stereos provide RCA and Digital audio inputs. \nSo in your situation the best method is to go with  1/8\" to RCA audio cables from the TV's audio out to your Receiver's Audio In. \nThe wires can be found at most places from Amazon to Walmart.\n\n\nA: HDMI supplies audio as well as video.  If your TV has an HDMI input and there is video playing, the audio will play as well (from your TV).  If you hook up external speakers to the TV, whatever sound the TV is playing will play from the external speakers (providing you set up your TV for audio through the headphone jack).  Some models may automatically shut off audio from the built in speakers whenever there is something plugged into the headphone jack or you may have to go into the menu of your TV, under audio, and set it up for only audio out through the headphone jack.\n", "Q: Prioritise Wi-Fi over GPS Location on iOS I am trying to find out a way I can prioritise WiFi via GPS location.

Now, I get that Retina is quite superior so I may immediately catch abnormalities in an external display - but I assure you, that's not the case.\nThe HP font is significantly rough on the edges, contributing to a blurry font (and a string of headaches).\nI called HP, and they tried to get me to buy their $67 paid support to give me the \"drivers\" for the monitor that I know they don't have.\nEither I need to get an easy fix here, or I call Apple, OR you folks can be kind enough to refer me to any other affordable and sleek looking external display at BestBuy or Amazon.ca\nI still have a return policy on hand with this bestbuy, so I may be able to exchange it for a display that doesn't have these silly issues.\nThanks!\n\nA: How are you connecting to the display?\nI've used screens in the past (a particular model dell springs to mind) which applied sharpening to the HDMI input by default, resulting in \"crunchy-looking\" type. That could be worth checking.\nIt's also fair to say that the MacOS doesn't always handle transitioning windows from retina to non-retina screens -- I've seen plenty of instances where the windows fonts in FCPX become extra-jagged until some magic combination of moving the window from screen to screen and/or rebooting the mac solves the issue. That's with a mix of screens, including the thunderbolt display.\n", "Q: Mac Pro - Early 2009 - 4,1 wont boot under OSX Having some issues with Mac Pro I’m hoping you can help with.\nI received a Mac Pro 2009 4,1 from my work place after a user noted it ‘it just died’\nOur guys here looked at it and could only conclude the fault could be hardware related but they were unsure what exactly. \nI took it home and installed a hard drive I had to hand with Windows 7 pre-installed, powered in on and after about a minute it loaded Windows normally despite not hearing the Mac start up tone. \nWhile browsing around in Windows I noticed the keyboard and mouse would go unresponsive intermittently.

Fails. Probably has something to do with it being an ISO file?\nAttempted firmware restoration here: https://support.apple.com/kb/dl976?locale=en_GB\nThis fails due to the power button remaining solid when held in\nSo at this point I’m fairly certain (unless I’m missing something) the fault is hardware related.

Although my admin account is listed as the \"owner\" of the top level folder and all of its sub-folders and contents, a student with an admin account of their own can drag one of these files to the trash and delete it by using their admin privileges. Is there any way to prevent this? Can permissions be set at a root level that would prevent deletion without running a terminal command?\n\nA: No. Admin accounts can modify any ACL or permission you make to keep them out.\n\n\n*\n\n*Admin = root on OS X\nI would consider placing the files on a file server and control access over file sharing (where your account is the only admin) or remove admin permissions from the accounts that cannot be trusted to not be malicious or careless. \n", "Q: Detect if user hits Stop I have a program where the user may hit Stop and stop the program while running at any given time.\nI'm looking for a way to detect if the user hits the Stop button in Script Editor (producing the -128 \"User canceled\" error), so I can do a little cleanup before the program closes.\nIs there a way to do this?\n\nA: You can use a try block like this:\nrepeat -- your loop\n    try\n        --\n        -- your code in the loop\n        --\n    on error err number n\n        if n = -128 then -- User canceled\n            --\n            -- code to  cleanup before the program closes\n            --\n            return -- exit this script\n        end if\n    end try\nend repeat\n\n\nA: Script Editor is above the script.

I am fairly new to working with \"Finder\" and I am finding it easiest to do everything I need with the file system through the console. I have had to install alot of software and on the 128GB MacBookAir I want to keep the used disk space down...\nFollowing the download and installations process I went in the the Downloads folder and deleted all of the .zip and .bin files to free up around 12GB - however I am now worried as upon removal I noticed that instead of listing the 10 installation files being deleted it said 25,000+ files. I now look at the \"All My Files\" folder and this is empty - I am worried that I have accidentally removed all the files from this folder.\nQuestion. Have I removed all the file from this folder like a prime n00b, or was this folder listing all of the contents of the compressed files in the Download folder, and when I removed these the \"All My Files\" contents updated to reflect this? \nThanks for your time.\n\nA: The \"All My Files\" folder is actually a virtual folder, using Spotlight to find all the documents, pictures and videos which you may have and displaying it to you in a categorized manner.\nDeleting the contents of \"Downloads\" will potentially remove some documents you may find listed in \"All My Files\" (if they were located inside Downloads), but does in no way remove every single personal file of your computer.\nOn the other side, if you inadvertently opened \"All My Files\" thinking it was \"Downloads\" and removed all files there, everything what Spotlight can find will be placed into the Trash.  Since \"All My Files\" gets opened by default when opening a new Finder window, it is a possibility.  This behavior can be set inside the preferences of Finder.\nAdditionally you stated that you preferred \"console\", which I interpret as using Terminal or command line (Console is actually an application which allows you to see log file output) over GUI, which is very powerful and can easily lead to dataloss when forgetting to type certain characters, especially when using \"sudo\".\nExample would be rm /Library/* vs. rm ~/Library/*.  The first would go for the system-wide Library folder while the second would use the Library folder of the currently used user.  Removing all the contents of the Library folder, user or system-wide, is a bad example, however, both folders do exist and just one character can have a profound difference.\nFinally, when one (or more) of your files where so-called application or package bundles, it is normal that you delete one file and Trash when emptying shows the number of each of the bundle files.  This would not explain \"All My Files\" being empty thereafter, but depicts the difference in putting a file (bundle) into Trash vs. emptying Trash.\n", "Q: Apple Macbook Pro Late 2011 freezing screen on startup It's been a couple of days since my Macbook Pro (Late 2011) started to freeze its screen on startup. \nThe first time it happened I was just using my Mac for some Matlab simulations (which I do really often) while listening to music on Spotify. The screen froze, the mouse cursor disappeared, no commands seem to get any answer, but the song kept playing (even advancing to the next one as soon as they finish). I decided to shutdown the Mac by pressing and holding the power button. After that, I tried to turn it on again, but I got the following screen:\n \n(For those who cannot notice any difference between this and the \"regular\" screen, this one has some dashes and dots, and the loading bar started to get \"thinner\"). \nand as soon as the Apple Logo disappear, nothing happens: the Mac get stuck on a gray screen. I waited for hours to see if something happens but nothing changed.\nAfter a couple of hours, I tried to turn it on again, and it worked just fine: I've done everything I usually do, which includes all the activity I was doing before the Mac had the problem for the first time (mainly Matlab simulations, spotify, programming, etc), and turn it off like I usually do. \nAfter some days, I've got the same problem again - this time on startup, and as soon as I managed to turn the Mac on again I decided to reinstall everything, thinking it could be an OS problem. I didn't change the OS version (still on El Captain), just made a clean install.\nThe Mac was working just fine for the past few days, but today it started all over again, and right now I can't even turn it on. \nWhat I've done so far:\n- I changed my SSD (a 240gb Kingston SSD) with a spare Hard Disk that I have: nothing changed.\n- Like I said, I've reinstalled the OS, and the only applications I've installed so far are: Spotify, Matlab, Google Chrome, and MacTeX. I've been using all of these applications for a long time, and I never had any kind of problem.\n- I ran all disk utility tools before and after reinstalling the OS\nMy Mac:\nMacBook Pro Late 2011 (15-inch).

I know I have way too many pictures in Photos so I got a huge Dropbox subscription to add pics before deleting from my hard drive to free up space. However, now it won't let me download pics since there is not enough free space on the hard drive to do it, so I'm caught in a Catch 22. My ultimate goal is to put pics in Dropbox and external hard drive and delete from computer so that I can have a place to access them when I need them.\n\nA: Are you syncing your Photos app using iCloud? Using that in conjunction with the setting \"Optimize Mac Storage\" should solve your problem (provided you have enough iCloud storage space). When set up this way, Photos stores your entire library on Apple's servers, and only downloads full-resolution photos and videos onto your local hard drive as you view them. If you have a lot of empty space, it'll cache more of them locally, but if you start to run out, it will get purge the high-res versions to make room. The thumbnails remain for browsing. \nThe big advantage to this over moving things manually onto Dropbox, external drives, etc etc is that your photos and videos stay right there in Photos, and are available on all your Apple devices without any real work on your end. Everything is backed up, and you aren't spending all this time manually shuffling things around. The one (and only, IMO) disadvantage is that you need to pay for whatever level of iCloud storage suits your Photos library size. \n\nA: Photos is storing all your photographs in a local file in your user folder on your main hard drive. Even when you move a photograph to another location, Photos keeps the photograph in this file unless you delete the photograph from Photos. When you delete a photograph from Photos, the photograph goes to \"Recently deleted\", but it is still in this local file! You have to delete the photograph from Recently deleted to get that space back. If you do not delete the file, it will delete itself after 30 days — this is the same way Photos works on iOS. If you have a lot of photographs, this file can get really huge.\nTo locate this file: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Finder\n\n*Press Command + Shift + G to open the \"Go to the folder:\" dialog box.\n\n*Type ~/Pictures and click \"Go\"\n\n\nThis will show you your Pictures folder inside your user folder on your Mac. \nThe file I am talking about will be called \"Photo library\" followed by an underscore ( _ ) and the date the library was created (for example: \"Photo library_2015.11.05\"). However big this file is, it is most likely the source of your problems with not having the free space you expect. \nThe quickest way to safely free up space is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy your Photo library file to an external hard drive (if it is a big file, it might take a while to copy over)\n\n*Rename the Photo library file so there's no confusion. For example, something like \"Photo library_external_drive\".\n\n*If Photos is open, you will have to quit Photos (Command + Q)\n\n*Before opening Photos again, hold down the \"option\" key — the easiest way to do this is to hold down the \"option\" key and then click the Photos icon in the Dock. This will open the \"Choose Library\" dialog.\n\n*From the \"Choose Library\" dialog, click the button that says \"Other library...\" and choose your external drive, then the Photo library file you just copied over (this is where having renamed the file is useful)\n\n*Once you have selected your renamed Photo library file, click \"Open\"\n\n*Verify that all your photographs are there and that everything is right before doing step 8\n\n*Go back to the Pictures folder inside your user folder (you could use Command + Shift + G and ~/Pictures again to be sure) and delete the Photo library file (Command + delete). Because you renamed the file on the external drive in step 2, you know that you're not deleting the file you just copied. \n\n\nTo get your free space back you will have to empty the trash. Once that is done, you will get back however much space this file has been taking up on your system.\nThe next time you open Photos, it will use the new library file that you copied and renamed on your external drive without issue.  \n", "Q: How can I make Mac Partition visible in Bootcamp (Windows 10 Anniversary Update)? Today I installed Windows 10, version 1607, on my MacBook Pro (Retina 15in Late 2013).\nBefore this I had Bootcamp setup with Win7. So, I started out by deleting the old Win7 Bootcamp Partition using the Bootcamp Assistant on Mac and then created a new partition and went on to install Windows 10.\nEverything seems to have gone smoothly: Partitioning, Installation of Windows 10, and the Apple Bootcamp drivers.\nHowever, the Mac Partition does not show up in Windows File Explorer.\nI found this related thread Why I can not see mac partition under windows installed with bootcamp?\nI have run the commands with the following results:\n\nIt looks like my MBP is not using CoreStorage.\nFileVault is deactivated.\n... and on my prior Windows 7 Bootcamp partition (that I deleted before setting up a new one for Windows 10) the Mac Partition was showing up correctly.\nHere's a pictures of Windows 10 Disk Management:\n\nDoes anyone know what's going on here?\n\nA: Apple officially supports Windows 10 on the newer Macs. Generally these are the 2012 and later models. The originally released version of Windows 10 was number 1511. The Windows version can be determined by opening a Command Prompt window and entering the command winver. Below is example. \n\nFor version 1511, read only access to HFS+ formatted partitions can be enabled by installing the Boot Camp Support Software. \nRecently, Microsoft has released a new version numbered 1607. This is referred to as the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. This version has a bug that can prevent read only access to HFS formatted volumes. Therefore, if you are using version 1607 of Windows 10, you may not be able to access HFS formatted volumes even if you have installed the Boot Camp Support Software. Until this bug is fixed, users will have to use version 1511 or find another way to copy data from HFS formatted volumes.\n\nA: Apple HFS+ drivers DO work after 1607 Anniversary Update, they just have problems mounting the drives. You can mount them manually with the risks associated with it. (Personally, I have encountered exactly zero bugs/problems in several weeks of hard usage and testing on 3 computers, so I started recommending my method on the net. I am writing this warning anyway, as mounting a partition forcibly may still have unforeseen consequences I have yet to face.)\nFirstly, make sure you have drivers from 6.0 installed, 6.1 does not have HFS+ drivers. You can reinstall to be sure, or\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Windows\\system32\\drivers\\ check if AppleHFS.sys and AppleMNT.sys is there. \n\n*Run regedit, go check if \"AppleHFS\" and \"AppleMNT\" keys exist in \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\\"; each should also have some string and dword values in it.\nPersonally, I would extract these two .sys files from a 6.0 install, Google on how to install them via registry tweaks, and make the habit of always using the most up-to-date bootcamp drivers. Apart from bug fixing and optimisations, new Macs a few years into future will just not function properly on 6.0 drivers.\nReboot after installing your Apple HFS drivers. Nothing will show up on 1607 after reboot, but I would still feel better to install these drivers before we try and mount them.\nSecondly, make sure you are not using CoreStorage. I am reasonably certain \"read only\" HFS driver can't do any harm, but it's better to be safe than sorry. \nIf you are good to go, you have two options:\nOption #1: mount your bootcamp partition via DOS Devices registry edit:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run regedit, navigate to \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/system/CurrentControlSet/Control/Session Manager/DOS Devices/\"\n\n*Right click > new > add string\n\n*Enter your drive letter by adding \":\" In \"data\" type \"\\Device\\HarddiskVolume#\", where # will be the volume number of your partition as it would be detected in MS-DOS. In your case, it SHOULD be 2, as it is the 2nd partition of disk0. (In MY computer, disk0 has 1 partition, my macOS partition is 2nd one on disk1, so MY partition number is 3, just count your partitions starting with 1.)\nYour registry entry should (provided nothing is changed in 4 months you posted this) show \"D:\", \"REG_SZ\" and \"\\Device\\HarddiskVolume2\" for name, type and data respectively (assuming D: is the drive letter you want for your macOS partition). \n\n*Never use letter C: or any other drive letter that may contradict with your Windows installation, as this may render your Windows unbootable. (Or may not, it's just a matter of luck whether Windows chooses to mount DOS devices first, or it's own disk management.) It is (probably) safe to do trial and error on volume #, it won't break anything even if you accidentally select your Windows partition, it will just mount it twice with different letters.\n\n*Reboot and your macOS partition should be there.  \n\n*Before using, go to properties of your new disk in \"This PC\" and your \"file system\" should be HFS and it should report used and free spaces correctly. If it is RAW, never try to reformat, check your AppleHFS.sys install. \nOption #2: use a program that can mount disks via Session Manager (in other words, it will make the registry entries for you). \n\n\n*\n\n*Download ext2fsd even though you probably have nothing to do with ext2 or linux.\n\n*Open Ext2 Volume Manager. In \"File System\" tab, your macOS partition will show as \"HFS\". If you installed ext2fsd before successfully installing bootcamp drivers, it will just show as \"RAW\". (kind of proving bootcamp drivers DO work)\n\n*Right click, select assign drive letter (or change drive letter).\n\n*In the pop-up menu, select the drive letter first, then select the tick \"Create a permanent MountPoint via Session Manager.\" It -weirdly- closes the pop-up before you click \"OK\". (Ext2fsd is a little buggy, you should select drive letter first, then select the tickbox. If you want to change drive letter, I suggest removing the existing one first, then re-add it from scratch)\n\n*Reboot, and the macOS partition will be there just like before anniversary update.\nIn both options, your diskpart or disk management will still show your HFS partition as RAW, (so does minitool partition wizard etc), but it will function normally, and you should be able to confirm it as HFS in properties menu. In analogy, this method tries to define your partition letter like defining a legacy COM or Printer (LPT) port.\n\nA: You can use HFS+ for Windows® 11 by paragon software. Worked for me.\nhttps://www.paragon-software.com/home/hfs-windows/download.html\n\nA: Followup on Andraxxus's answer.\n1. Option 1 did not work for me. Run command line \"diskpart\", \"list volume\", shows that the mac hfs+ partition was not mounted. While \"select disk 0\", then \"list partition\" will find presence of the partition.\n2. Option 2 ext2fsd will run, but after rebooting windows 10, windows will run scanning and repairing drive C. Then, the drive D: is gone again. Solution : Go to regedit, navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager, Change the BootExecute string to \"autocheck autochk /k:C *\" \n", "Q: Secret to long-lasting relationship: Shut Down or Close Lid? The guy at the Apple store was like: \"I just close the lid, and that works fine for me. I also shut it down every 1 (or 2) weeks, to clear the RAM\".\nThat makes sense, but it sounds like his personal experience. Is there anything official/unwritten law on what we should do when we are done with our Macs, at night for example.\nI am a person that almost accesses the laptop (MacBook pro 15'' Retina) every day. It's brand new and I wish for a long-lasting relationship with it!\n\nA: On the software level his advice should be fine. The only difference could be battery life. Hibernation still consumes a tiny bit of energy and is therefore using the battery. Shutting it down completely should make your battery last a little longer which means that you're using slightly less recharge cycles. But let's be honest, the difference is near to zero - so don't worry about it. His advice should be fine.\nA bigger concern should be your screen.

Then you can tell the IM is in that state by the green light on the keyboard (if it has one for capslock).\n\nA: I'm doing to go something similar, except with Japanese/ English.\nI wrote the following script:\n#!/usr/local/bin/bash\n# Checks current keyboard input source (aka language)\n\n#These are the strings that MacOS uses to identify the current input source\nENGLISH=\"U.S.\"\nHIRIGANA=\"com.apple.inputmethod.Japanese\"\nKATANA=\"com.apple.inputmethod.Japanese.Katakana\"\n\nWESTERN_LANGUAGE=$(defaults read ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.HIToolbox.plist AppleSelectedInputSources | grep 'KeyboardLayout Name' | sed -E 's/^.+ = \\\"?([^\\\"]+)\\\"?;$/\\1/')\n\n# If the current language is not western one, then check a different variable\nEASTERN_LANGUAGE=$(defaults read ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.HIToolbox.plist AppleSelectedInputSources | grep -w 'Input Mode' | head -1 | sed -E 's/^.+ = \\\"?([^\\\"]+)\\\"?;$/\\1/')\n\nif [ $WESTERN_LANGUAGE == $ENGLISH ]\nthen\n  echo \nelif [ $EASTERN_LANGUAGE == $HIRIGANA ]\nthen\n  echo  \nelif [ $EASTERN_LANGUAGE == $KATANA ]\nthen\n  echo \nfi\n\nThis determines the current language and shows a relevant emoji.\nYou can combine it with xbar (rebranded bitbar) and show the current language in the menu bar; you'll also want to have the script run after you change the language (you can prob use iCanHazShortcut to bind a keyboard shortcut to that).\nA simpler way is to go into the Mac Keyboard settings and have it show an icon for the current input source (not sure how well that works if you're using a 3rd party input source).\n", "Q: Homebrew not updating to latest commit I'm trying to update Homebrew on my Macbook Pro, but Homebrew says it is already up-to-date.

I use a lot of screenshots (save the screenshot to clipboard and paste it in PowerPoint). When using the retina display, the presentation file size becomes a lot bigger compared to the same task using a normal display. That makes sense, since the same size images would be 4X as many pixels.\nThere seems to be a solution. You can go to File > Compress Pictures. However, I don't think that compresses the images properly. I can set the resolution to a very low setting. That makes the images very blurry and the file size is reduced. However, the file size it still much higher than using non-retina images without any compression. The non-retina presentation is smaller file and better quality in the end. I think that the way PowerPoint calculates the resolution, that still somehow does not take into account the retina conversion by the OS.\nIs there a way to use PowerPoint with a retina display, but still keep the images to a reasonable size? Can I keep PowerPoint in non-retina mode somehow?\nLooking at previous posts, there used to be an option to \"Open in low resolution\" in File > Get Info, but that does not seem to exist anymore.\n\nA: Try saving the screenshots to a JPG file and then inserting them into the Powerpoint.

Sometimes it just stops playing. Other times, it switches to a song in the Music.app that had not previously been played, queued, etc.\nOrginal car had a Kenwood head unit with a USB port. Now the car is a BMW 328i with the stock system -- also hooked up via the iPhone's lightning port to the car's USB.\nI've had this problem in two cars now, and it's only when playing via the iPhone 6 via the lightning to USB. When playing podcasts/music via Bluetooth, this never pops up as an issue, but I want it plugged in so that it charges, plus I get track info and album art on the car's screen via USB.\nIt's an intermittent problem, but seems to happen most often at the beginning of the day for the commute into work or on the way home.\nI typically listen to podcasts in the car and it happens with both the native Apple Podcasts app, as well as Overcast. I've also had it when playing Pandora and even the Apple music app.\nIt's been happening quite awhile (over the course of owning two cars). Phone is currently running iOS 9.3.5, but has happened over the course of the last 2-3 major iOS upgrades.\nI have tried multiple lightning cables, and as stated before, it's happened in multiple vehicles.\nAny ideas to make it stop pausing/stopping/switching to a seemingly random song without having to resort to Bluetooth?\n\nA: My knee-jerk reaction is to say: This sounds to me like a possible problem with the cable or the Lightning port on the phone.  It's as if the phone is getting some kind of remote control command via the cable.  I've seen similar skipping behavior with a bad Apple earbud cord.\nThat being said, I have an iPhone 6s and a new Nissan NVP 3500 that I too connect to the car via USB.  If I'm not playing anything at the moment, it will start playing the first thing alphabetically in my library.  If I'm playing something already, or if the two were connected via Bluetooth before I connect the cable, it will continue as if nothing was wrong.\nOn a quirky note, sometimes the stereo and the phone will haggle for a bit, then the phone will play the audio through its own speaker and the car will give up trying to access the phone in iPod Out mode.  In that case, I have to reboot the phone altogether to get it to play nicely with the car.  I chalk that up to running the iOS 10 betas.\n", "Q: Reducing Pocket app size I have the Pocket app on an iPhone and an iPad. When I check storage usage, they are over 2 and 4 GBs, respectively. Why is the size so big in both cases? The app itself is under 100 MBs according to the App Store. All the saved articles are just text. I have no videos or images.\nMore importantly, is there a way to reduce the space taken up by the app? There does not seem to be a way to delete archived articles.\n\nA: Pocket's customer support gave this information to another user who had a very similar problem (albeit in 2014):\n\n[When an item has] been Archived or Deleted ... we attempt to remove all associated files. However, we have learned more recently that some information can be retained under certain circumstances. This is why logging out and back in dropped Pocket’s storage usage so dramatically.\n\nLogging out and back in causes the entire local storage to be cleared, at which point only items on your List (not Archived) are re-downloaded.\nThey also said they were adding a way to limit storage usage as well as make cache cleanup more efficient, though that does not seem to be true in your case.\n", "Q: Restored system now some apps won't start I recently restored my 2013 MacBook Pro El Capitan system back to Mavericks from my Time Machine external drive. The restore was successful except a few that wont start: Calendar, Terminal, Messages, App Store. I tried loggin in as guest, same problem.\n\nA: If these were 3rd party apps I'd say that you need to reinstall them but they aren't so it's a bit... odder...\nIt may be that the Time Machine restore put back files that were created with a later version of the app that the older version understands. I would start with deleting the preferences files for those apps in ~/Library/Preferences. Look for files that start with \"com.apple\" and end with the app name. You could also check in /Library/Preferences. Delete the preference file(s) and try the app again.\nApps like Calendar have a file that they automatically open. you may have to just delete the primary calendar 'document' which (I believe) have their own folder in which they reside: ~/Library.\nFinally clear the caches folders Delete the contents of /Library/Caches and ~/Library/Caches and reboot.\nAt least that is my best guess.\n", "Q: Bootable cloud backup services?

It will contain enough historical data - old installs I've lost the disks for, audio plugins where the authorisation site no longer exists, etc.  \nI also make sure to have Recovery Partitions on more than one drive.\nA further step would be to have an additional Time Machine drive, which normally lives off-site.\nI just checked - Backblaze is also available for iOS & Android - though it's not something I've ever really investigated.\n", "Q: My mac keeps panicking Recently my mac has started panicking and I don't really understand why.\nThe reason for the panics aren't always the same either.\nSometimes the reason for the panic is the same but the thread is different.\nAll the panics so far are in this gist (which as of posting only contains the most recent one).\nThe only thing I can pretty much say is I doubt it's Avira as I installed it right at the beginning and this issue is a recent one; I mention this because I read that sometimes kernel extensions can cause panics and Avira has a Kernel extension.\nIt happens whether I'm in the browser (Chrome) or my terminal (iTerm2).\nI have 3 spaces open, 2 browsers and one terminal.\nI'm running Tmux in my shell for multiplexing.\nOne last thing, unrelated, but why do some of the panics error with Bash? I switched my shell to Zsh.\n\nA: \nThe only thing I can pretty much say is I doubt it's Avira as I\n  installed it right at the beginning and this issue is a recent one\n\nThat could be evidence to the contrary - even a minor OS X upgrade can cause a third party kext to become deprecated, resulting in persistent panics. \nUnless you completely uninstall the software, you won’t be able to rule it out. A quick google search of Apple Support Communities shows a multitude of panics related to Akira’s drivers. \nAnother alternative would be to unload the kernel extension temporarily* and test. Open Terminal and enter the following command (replacing with the actual name of the kext):\nsudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/thirdpartykext.kext\n\nConfirm it’s unloaded:\nkextstat | grep com.avira.kext.FileAccessControl\n\ngrep should return nothing. Proceed to reboot your machine. \nIf you’re unable to recreate the panic, then you’ve isolated the issue. Contact the developers of the software, report it, and wait for them to roll out an update. \n\n*To reload the kext, you’d run:\nsudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/thirdpartykext.kext\n\n", "Q: saving contacts on iPhone 6 without bringing documents and data This has always been frustrating.

The new version 12 of Parallels Desktop For Mac has a new configuration option. In the configuration panel > Hardware > CPU & Memory > Advanced Settings > Hypervisor is a popup menu for:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hypervisor\n\n\n*\n\n*Parallels\n\n*Apple\n\n\n\nWhich one do I should I be using when running macOS Sierra as the guest OS?\nWhat exactly is the difference, the pros-and-cons of each?\nThe Parallels app Help has no mention of this new setting.\n\nA: This post in Parallels Forum clearly states to use Parallels Hypervisor:\n\nHi, Apple hypervisor comes short of the following matters comparing to the Parallels hypervisor:\n\n*\n\n*Performance: slower on VM startup and shutdown\n\n\n*Stability: may crash more frequently\n\n\n*Functionality loss: no PMU, nested virtualization, thermal monitoring, energy profiling\nParallels Hypervisor is the best one.\n\nBy PaulChris@Parallels, a Parallels Support person.\n\nA: The Apple Hypervisor is a user-centric lightweight hypervisor that Apple provides so developers don't have to write kernel extensions (KEXTs).  From everything that I have gathered, this is primarily for a dev environment \nFrom the Hypervisor documentation on Apple Developer:\n\nThe Hypervisor framework provides C APIs for interacting with\n  virtualization technologies in user-space, without the need for\n  writing kernel extensions (KEXTs). As a result, apps created using\n  this framework are suitable for distribution on the Mac App Store.\n\nThe Parallels Hypervisor is a more robust Hypervisor that isn't \"user centric.\"  Meaning that it can be invoked at the OS level, not just at the user level.  You also get much more robust features like the Adaptive Hypervisor Technology that allows you to allocate CPU resources across the host and guest VM's\nMy take...\nIf you are looking to run a Window 10 VM for testing or a specific app, then either Hypervisor will probably work just fine.\nIf you are looking to load up a Linux host for dev work that you want accessible whether or not you are at your machine, you probably want the Parallels Hypervisor.\n\nA: Apple are in the process of reducing a developers ability to introduce kexts (kernel extensions) onto your device. They are doing this because software houses that rely on kexts have as a rule proven more than capable of producing sub optimal systems capable of destabilising a Mac. Both VMware and Parallels use kexts; both companies products are easily capable of destabilising a Mac and both companies produce sub optimal software. I have used both VMWare (Fusion) and Parallels on a Mac; out of the two I found Fusion to be the most stable.\nCPU usage across both products? Well, Windows if you leave it to 'idle' has a nasty habit of updating. So that's going to bugger up any preconceived ideas of which system is the most efficient. I've seen some 'framework' virtualisation applications cropping up and I have to say slim is best; when they weigh in at around 20mb instead of nearly half a gig, I think that speaks for itself. Veertu Desktop was the first to come onto the App Store and weighed 13MB. Parallels Desktop \"Lite\" is 234MB?!? Why? Veertu Desktop was a little crude, but it ran like Usain Bolt with NO evidence of ANY hypervisor instabilities. It's a real shame they didn't finish the job off.\nThe hypervisor framework (released in Yosemite, around 3 years ago), will enable software suppliers to get virtualisation products into the Mac App Store. The framework is not for developers, it is a mechanism to be used by developers to get you the products you want. There are quite a number of free products now appearing that support this framework. As a developer I cannot wait to see more virtualisation products to come out that I can run Windows on (for software development). I look forward to kext free virtualisation. The compromise is likely to be a reduction or removal of gimmickry that burdens the host system. So, no fancy window skins; who's interested in that anyway? No 'side by side' (the hidden windows desktop); again not interested I always run in a window or full screen. No accelerated gaming, though I'm not sure on that one. But, if you seek a gaming machine go native or build one. I seek stable, optimised, fast and efficient virtualisation. Currently neither VMWare or Parallels supply this.\nI was considering trying out Parallels Desktop Lite; but if it's bug free and works, why do I need a £60 per yer subscription? By European law, if the product is buggy I'm entitled to a fix; I shouldn't have to pay for it. I'm not keen on companies whose business model is to bind me into a subscription because they're providing me with buggy bloated software.\n(@basil) update: this is parallels lite running high sierra\n\n\nA: From About Parallels Desktop system extensions on macOS Big Sur (and later), October 2020:\n\nAt WWDC20, Apple was quoted as saying that “System Extensions improve the reliability and security of macOS, and deprecated kernel extensions will not load by default in macOS Big Sur”. Eventually, to make Parallels Desktop fully compatible with the new macOS Big Sur 11.0, Parallels Engineering has gone through years of engineering work of rebuilding Parallels Desktop and its features using the new macOS system APIs. This extensive and time-intensive development resulted in the all-new Parallels Desktop, explicitly designed to work and integrate with new macOS Big Sur technologies, and at the same time, deliver performance and productivity improvements to benefit Parallels Desktop customers.\n[... snip ...]\nFor now, our team continues to work on supporting both Parallels and Apple hypervisors and continues collaborating with Apple on implementing the rest of Parallels Hypervisor features to Apple Hypervisor. We recommend using Apple hypervisor, and if you notice any difference between Apple and Parallels hypervisors for your use case, please let us know.\n\n(Emphasis mine)\nTL;DR: Security changes in MacOS have motivated Parallels to build on top of Apple's native system APIs.\n\nA: From my own experience on a retina Macbook Pro 15' 2015\nAn idling Windows 10 VM running VS 2015 on VMWare Fusion is around 100% CPU\nthe same on Parallels Hypervisor is around 50~60\nwith Apple Hypervisor, it's about 20%. \nCrashes and lockups happen more or less as frequently whatever vm software or hypervisor I use.\nYou should try either setting and check what fits better for your use. \n\nA: My take is that these technologies evolve very rapidly, so it's best to try these things out on your own.\nPerhaps in 2017 Apple Hypervisor is faster, but now perhaps it is the other way around. For me, as of July 2021 Parallels Hypervisor led to less memory usage and a faster computer.\n", "Q: Youtube's HTML 5 player freezes all the time, how do I disable that and force flash on Safari I hate Flash but Youtube's HTML5 player stinks on Safari.\nSee this video it freezes all the time on Safari (El Cap).

A couple of years ago I dual booted ubuntu with reFind, however recently I erased my main partition to clean up my mac. Now I would like to dual boot arch also using reFind, so I mounted my EFI partition and found this:\nBOOTLOG\nBOOTLOG.OLD\nscreenshot__001.bmp\nscreenshot__002.bmp\nEFI/\n    APPLE/ \n        CACHES/\n            CAFEBEEF/\n                (empty)\n        EXTENSIONS/\n            Firmware.scap\n        FIRMWARE/\n            MBP91_00D3_B0D_LOCKED.scap\n    Ubuntu/\n    tools/\n        gptsync_x64.efi     \n    reFind/ \n\nSo I deleted the ubuntu and reFind directories since I want to start with a fresh install of reFind. My question is were the files contained in the APPLE and tools directories created from the old reFind install, in which case I can delete them, or are they integral to the standard mac boot process (so I shouldn't mess with them)?\n\nA: You can delete everything from the EFI partition if you wish. OS X will recreate what it needs when the operating system starts. Basically, OS X copies the Firmware.scap file from the boot partition to the EFI  partition.\nThe files and folders marked below for deletion are not part of OS X.\nBOOTLOG                            <---- Delete\nBOOTLOG.OLD                        <---- Delete\nscreenshot__001.bmp                <---- Delete\nscreenshot__002.bmp                <---- Delete\nEFI/\n    APPLE/ \n        CACHES/\n            CAFEBEEF/\n                (empty)\n        EXTENSIONS/\n            Firmware.scap\n        FIRMWARE/\n            MBP91_00D3_B0D_LOCKED.scap\n    Ubuntu/                             <---- Delete (Part of Ubuntu)\n    tools/                              <---- Delete (Part of rEFInd)\n        gptsync_x64.efi                 <---- Delete (Part of rEFInd)\n    reFind/                             <---- Delete (Part of rEFInd)\n\nThe rest of the files were put there by OS X or related software.\n", "Q: Clean install- erasing disk vs erasing volume I just created a bootable flash drive with El Capitan on it. I restarted my computer and went into disk utility to erase. I see that there is the disk 'APPLE SSD ...' That is 251GB, and there is the volume within it 'Macintosh HD' that is 249GB. If I want to do a clean install which should I erase? And what is on the 2GB leftover that is not taken up by the volume? Any comments are greatly appreciated, thanks.\n\nA: A discrepancy between the drive size and the size of the boot partition is not unusual. Some of this missing space is consumed by the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*The hidden Recovery partition\n\n*The hidden EFI partition\n\n*Space used by the file system on the OS X partition\n\n*Space used by Core Storage (This is optional depending on your Macs\nhardware)\n\n\nWhen you have booted from the flash drive, you can erase your disk to maximize the OS X boot partition space by repartitioning the drive. You should create a single \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" partition. The required hidden partitions will be created automatically. If you have single SSD drive, then you are not required to use Core Storage unless you need encryption.\n", "Q: MBP: F1-F9 & Right Shift Not Responding MBP function keys f1 through f9 are not responding: brightness up/down, keyboard backlighting up/down, etc.\nSeems to be a fairly common problem looking through forum posts online.\nSeems to have something to do with windows - people are having problems with VMware / boot camp, etc. My problem is probably of the same variety.\nVolume keys work (f10, f11, f12).\nfn + function key also has no response.\nTried toggling the use fn key option is keyboard settings but that only seemed to make volume keys (f10, f11, f12) respond with random functions.\nAny ideas?\nedit; formatted the disk - reinstalled os - still the same.\n\nA: Okay, it's a bit hard to try and troubleshoot this via lots of comments to and fro, so I will use this to try and get you sorted.\nI'm assuming that since you've already tried formatting the disk and reinstalling OS X that you already have a recent backup. If not, do one now.\nTry an external keyboard\nAs I mentioned in the comments, have you tried using an external keyboard? Any USB keyboard will suffice - give it a go and report back your findings.

Firmware upgraded to a '10(5,1), 24GB RAM, upgraded processors to two quad core 3.46 GHz Xeons', NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 2GB. I'm looking at the next upgrade options and an SSD comes to mind. As you probably know, the '09 and '10 have SATA II, not III. \nWhat I want to know is the performance gain from a HDD to a SSD running at SATA II, as opposed to III, worth the upgrade? Can SATA II SSDs be found at a lower price than SATA III drives, if they can be found at all?\nI know I can either get a SATA III card or a PCI SSD and not have the performance hit, but that adds enough to the cost of the upgrade to not fit in the budget at this time.\n\nA: Empirically, the answer is 'Yes'.\nI have a very similar machine - 4,1 -> 5,1, dual 3.46GHZ Xeons, 64GB RAM & also an older 3,1.\nBoth now have an SATA III 840 EVO 1TB as boot drive [best available at the time of purchase] in the first optical drive bay [leaving room for your usual 4 HDs in the regular bays. Adapter bracket a few quid/dollars/shekels from eBay.\nOn the 4,1 it connects directly to the cabling in the bay, the 3,1 needs a longer SATA cable down into the main body, under the cooling fans, where the two 'secret' SATA ports are.\nNo, they don't run at SATA III speeds, but boy do they make the entire machine more responsive. Boot time down from a couple of minutes to 15 seconds. iTunes [the slowest to launch that I know of] now launches in about 5 seconds. Finder is zippy & responsive, no more waiting for it to fill a window.\nYou get so used to the speed you don't notice it until you have to use a machine with a spinning HD again.\nSpeed test - SSD\n \nSpeed test - HD\n \n\nA: Yes it’s worth the upgrade. Even over a SATA II bus, the performance boost will be immediately noticeable with a SSD:\n[]\nFrom Is A SATA 3Gb/s Platform Still Worth Upgrading With An SSD?:\n\n\"The real key is getting an SSD into your machine. Just have a look at what happens when our 840 Pro goes up against the fastest desktop hard drive we've ever benchmarked, Western Digital's ValociRaptor. The disk didn't stand a chance in any of our synthetic or real-world tests.\"\n\nI’d also recommend purchasing a SATA III SSD as they are backwards compatible. You’ll find a much wider selection at pretty much the same price point (in some cases, cheaper). Additionally, you’ll be able to use it in your next machine ;)\n\nA: The performance gain with an SSD comes from the zero seek latency/time, all data is instantly accessible. That's where an SSD in consumer computers is beneficial. Massive IOPS or extreme bandwidth and NAND speeds won't help a user that much, but has a real impact in server applications and large data transfers (i.e. to and from RAM).\n", "Q: iPhone 6s Plus calendar not properly syncing to Outlook 2007 My boss has an iPhone 6s Plus + iPad Pro + Win10 PC with Outlook 2007. He set the devices so each has their own default calendar, but all calendars are set to sync in iTunes. He refuses to utilize any cloud services for calendar sync, and use iTunes exclusively to sync everything.\nHowever, some events on iPhone were not synced to PC. Some events that can be seen on PC were not seen on iPad. Months of events go missing on iPad despite having set to sync and show all calendars. AFAIK events on iPhone is the \"most updated\" version.\nWithout going for iCloud or any cloud services (which he simply refuse to use), how to have all 3 calendars sync correctly? Is there a way to export calendars from iPhone and import in iPad?\n\nA: Avoiding cloud in 2016 is strange, especially with Apple devices. However, you can set both devices to properly sync with Outlook 2007 using the software called Akruto. It works like Exchange server on your PC and allows syncing via Wi-Fi and over the Internet (without the cloud, through a 3-rd party DNS service).\nHere's the link: http://www.akruto.com/sync-iphone-with-outlook/\nWhat's good is that you don't have to install any apps on your boss' phone, everything will show up in the native calendar app.\n\nA: I used a program called Sync2 to sync outlook calendar with iPhone.

A weird question - I'm not a designer, but think a few of emoji provided with apple keyboard would very well describe the nature of my app. I would like to include them in my app icon design. \nCan I use Apple emoji on app icon for submitting my app to iOS App Store?\n\nA: I would say no. \nApple review guidelines state that you must own the rights for any images you display in, or on, your app. https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\nGuideline 2.3.9 states:\n\n2.3.9 You are responsible for securing the rights to use all materials in your app icons, screenshots, and previews, and you should display fictional account information instead of data from a real person.\n\nAlso, Apple gives violations of this guideline as one of the top reasons for rejection and/or removal from the App Store. If you include artwork that you don't own, you might get thru Review but they're getting stricter and might remove it. \n\nA: EDIT:\nLegally it's extremely unlikely that you are allowed to do that as @fbara explained in his/her answer, but you can definitely give it a try and worst case I'd expect the app to be kicked off the store. Seeing as other apps have already done this successfully its not impossible to get done, just not as reliable as using your own assets.\n\nSince icons are nothing more than just an image, yea its definitely possible.\nNow about whether or not apple will allow you to use the emojis, I didn't find anything saying that you can or cannot use them. However there are countless apps which already do so, so I assume it should be fine.\n\nRemoved line 1 as it probably doesnt answer what the question really was asking\n\nA: I am not a lawyer, but I interpret the following to mean you can use glyphs provided in the Apple Color Emoji font (on an Apple-branded system running macOS) to generate read-only icons to be used in the App Store (or anywhere else).\nFrom the macOS Monterey software license agreement:\n\nE. Fonts. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you may use the fonts included with the Apple Software to display and print content while running the Apple Software; however, you may only embed fonts in content if that is permitted by the embedding restrictions accompanying the font in question. These embedding restrictions can be found in the Font Book/Preview/Show Font Info panel.\n\nAn image icon to be used in the App Store would be, by my reading, embedding the font. From from the Show Font Info panel for the Apple Color Emoji font (Version 17.4d12e1):\n\nEmbedding: Preview and print embedding. This font may be embedded in documents and temporarily loaded on the remote system. Documents containing this font must be opened “read-only;” no edits can be applied to the document.\n\nSince an icon file is a read-only document and no edits can be applied to the document, the use seems permitted.\n", "Q: Stop Docker from automatically starting on startup I installed Docker on OS X, and now it automatically loads every time I log in.

I generally keep a clone of my current system on another drive (or partition) after a new OS installation, then I can quickly re-boot and continue to use the software. I actually keep a legacy Mac these days running 10.6 and 10.8 just for this support.\n\n*Consider a virtual machine.

I \"share my location\" with my husband and on this particular day he checked my location and it showed I was about 1 to 1 1/2 miles away at a park (that I have never been to). I was home at the time and the wifi may have been down but I can't figure out why it was so far off.\nIf there is no wifi, wouldn't the cellular service ( I have Verizon) give the correct location? I even checked the Location History on my phone and it shows me home during that time period and does not show any history at that park location? What would cause it to be so far off? \nThanks.\n\nA: Location accuracy uses (from best to worst) gps, wifi, and cellular triangulation.     Your question would take a lot of text and links to completely answer so I'm just going to try and give it a high-level approach.\nMany things have to happen correctly for your husband to get your exact location: you need to have a clear signal from the gps satellite, the cell signal on your iPhone needs to be good with a low latency (delay) sending your coordinates, and if the gps signal isn't very good but there's wifi available to you, the wifi location lookups need to happen quickly (again, over the cell signal).  Now, if you move, this entire thing needs to start all over again.\nCell signals can only triangulate your approximate location between the 3 cell towers.  They can't get an exact location, like a gps signal.  If the cell towers are miles apart, like they usually are, it can report your location as far away from where you actually are.  If the cell signal is bad, it's guessing at your location (based on where you were in that triangle) from the last time it 'saw' you.  \nLike I said, this is very high-level and it's very easy to go into more detail (and really confuse you!) with a simple Google search.  Why it didn't report your exact location when you were at home, with wifi, I'm not sure.  Maybe it did report your exact location but your husband's cell or wifi signal was poor so he was sent a 'guess' based on the last time his iPhone saw your iPhone.\nIt's very difficult to troubleshoot these types of issues online.  If you notice this type of inaccuracy happening more often, it could be indicative of a deeper problem with your iPhone so a trip to Apple might help solve the problem.\n", "Q: stuck booting into broken Bootcamp (Win 7) volume. any ideas on how to get back to OS X? I've got a 10.11.6 (El Capitan) tower with separate drives for OS X and Windows 7 via Bootcamp, which I also use via Parallels. I went to shut down the Win 7 VM via Parallels yesterday and it wanted to 'finish' installing a bunch of Windows Updates. I let it run for hours and it was still stuck on 1 of 32(ish) so I reluctantly killed it. After this it was failing to boot up again, so I figured I'd reboot the entire machine into Win 7 to fix it... big mistake apparently.\nThe automatic repair options in Windows are all failing to correct the problem. Rolling back to a previous known good state fails. System restore fails. Safe mode blue screens at login. I have a Windows 7 install CD but can't get the system to boot to it and restore the OS. Tapping F8 at startup gives me some more options but restore via CD doesn't seem to be one.\nThe worst part is that holding the option key down at boot leaves me with a black screen so I can't select to boot back into OS X. I tried using 'X' from the list here but no dice on that either (just proceeds to fail to boot into windows again).\nWould love to hear any other ideas about repairing the windows installation or getting back into OS X.\n\nA: I pulled the windows drive and put it in a windows machine to repair it and got it booting over there, but it still wouldn't boot when put back into my Mac Pro.\nI was able to get my Mac Pro to boot back into OS X by resetting NVRAM (command-option-P-R after startup sound until you hear it again). Apparently this contains boot disk preference and resetting it along with pulling the windows drive let it 'find' OS X again.\nI believe the reason that OS X Recovery and holding option for the Startup Manager don't work for me is due to an aftermarket GTX 760 graphics card. It works great on successful boot, however it doesn't behave the same as the OEM card did in the EFI.\n", "Q: How much data is used during factory reset recovery mode for the Mac OS? I boot my Mac air into recovery mode over internet command+option+R (recovery drive has been deleted/overwritten).\nI am using mobile tethering to recover this device, just enquiring as to how much data will be used during this process if anyone can advise? I am unsure of the size of the recovery image it wants to download.\np.s this is my only available recovery method, there are no ethernet ports on the laptop and it will not pick up our business Wi-Fi (we use WPA2-Enterprise which is supported but on a Cisco Meraki account basis, so it's not a case of SSID / Pass).\n\nA: Each size (Internet Recovery Mode and OS X reinstall) is comparable to the sizes of the respective dmg files containing the Base OS X/full OS X install.\nSo booting once to Internet Recovery Mode requires the download of about 650 MB and restoring your original operating system – which depends on your MacBook Air model – requires an additional download of about ~4.7 GB (Lion) to ~5.7 GB (Yosemite).\nYou can't download and install El Capitan directly because the original system of the newest MacBook Air was 10.10.2.\n", "Q: How to restart Bluetooth service from command line On Linux, if one wishes to restart the Bluetooth service, they simply launch a terminal and issue the following command:\nsudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart\n\nWhat is the equivalent on Mac OS X?  I would like to restart my Bluetooth without having to restart the entire computer.\nI am using Yosemite.\nUpdate:  Of the various command line options provided by Testing below the only one that seemed to work was the last, which is this:\nsudo kextunload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport\nsudo kextload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport\n\nUpdate 2: The above command no longer works and I wonder if it ever did.  The first time I tried it it might have been something else that restarted my bluetooth services.  The only thing that will work for me is a restart of the entire machine every morning.\n\nA: For my Macbook Pro 2017 with macOS High Sierra 10.13.6, I restart bluetooth using the following bash script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsudo launchctl stop com.apple.bluetoothd\nsudo launchctl start com.apple.bluetoothd\n\n\nA: On High Sierra, none of the command line options worked for me.  I was able to plug in a wired USB mouse and use the Shift + Option with Debug/Rest solution.\nI tried the blueutil solution on my High Sierra, and it worked like a charm.  I regularly have Bluetooth on my 2015 MBPR with an Apple Magic Mouse hose up, and have to restart. Yeah, I could open the lid and use the track pad, but it's on the other side of the wall from my desk space. \nYou can install blueutil using Homebrew:\nbrew install blueutil\n\nOr you can compile and install it by hand using:\ncd ~/tmp/\ngit clone https://github.com/toy/blueutil.git\ncd blueutil\nmake\nmake test \ncp blueutil ~/bin/\n\nNow run:\nblueutil -p 0 && sleep 1 && blueutil -p 1\n\n\nA: This 3rd party command line tool seems to work all the way up to High Sierra, abstracting away the differences between OSX versions: https://github.com/toy/blueutil\n\nA: sudo pkill bluetoothd\n\nNOTE: Works for me on macOS High Sierra\nMy Logitech MX Anywhere mouse does not work after sleeping sometimes. As I've read it's not because of mouse, it's a macOS Smart Bluetooth bug. But my Apple keyboard always works, never has this issue.\nSometimes I wake up my computer, the Apple keyboard is working but the Logitech mouse is not working. So without the mouse I cannot restart Bluetooth from the system (I could close the lid but my keyboard also goes away, so cannot restart it again).\nI started to use this command from the terminal, it stops the service but when the service stops it automatically restarts it self. And my mouse starts working within a second!\n\nA: On El Capitan, it's kind of tricky because it doesn't allow you to unload system services. However, a brute-force method is:\nsudo pkill blued\n'blued' is the OS X bluetooth daemon, and it will automatically restart when terminated (at least when I tested it on my El Capitan machine). Other related daemons are: com.apple.bluetoothReporter, com.apple.IOBluetoothUSBDFU, and com.apple.bluetoothaudiod (you can look at the daemons running using sudo launchctl list)\nYou can also try:\nsudo launchctl stop com.apple.blued\nsudo launchctl start com.apple.blued\n\nIf you have an older OS X version, it's cleaner:\nsudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist\nsudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist\n\nor \nsudo kextunload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport\nsudo kextload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport\n\n\nA: One thing to mention is the daemon name blued (at least until macOS 10.11 El Capitan), has been changed to bluetoothd.\nSo based on the version of the macOS, you need to change the daemon name in the below command(s).\nAnother thing to note is that, unload then load the daemon's plist(instead of stop then start or sending HUP signal) may not work due to the SIP(System Integrity Protection) introduced in El Capitan.\nBut it should work when you disabled the SIP or on macOS before El Capitan.\n$ sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist\n$ sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist\n\nEven in the SIP environment(after El Capitan) you can simply launchctl stop then launchctl start the daemon.\n$ sudo launchctl stop com.apple.bluetoothd # or blued based on macOS version\n$ sudo launchctl start com.apple.bluetoothd\n\nIn case you just want the status(on|off) of bluetooth to be changed, not wanting the daemon to actually restart, you can do the following, \n# Let bluetooth be on \n$ sudo defaults write \n/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth ControllerPowerState -int 1\n\n# let bluetooth be off \n$ sudo defaults write \n/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth ControllerPowerState -int 0\n\n# Then reload the daemon\n$ sudo killall -HUP bluetoothd # or blued based on macOS version\n# On a macOS system which has proctools installed, you can replace `killall` to `pkill`\n\nBlueutil is cool stuff, but it is using some private APIs of IOBluetooth.framework, so it may not work on the future version of macOS.\n\nA: Found this page on GitHub Gist with commands that worked for me (I am running Yosemite v. 10.10.5). You can simply type the following in the terminal to restart the bluetooth daemon without restarting:\nsudo kextunload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport\n\nsudo kextload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport \n\nbluetooth daemon\n\nA: I am running Yosemite v10.10.5 and none of the other comments / gists worked for me at all.

I am assuming when the map expires, that I am SOL if I try to use it.\nWithin the Google Maps app, one can download maps for offline use: great when traveling abroad, especially when there is no connectivity.  What is the reason for having the maps expire after such a short time span?  Is there a way to increase the number?  It's odd in the sense expiration is 29 days and not a round number.   \n\nA: There hasn't been any info from Google as to why the maps expire in 30 days.  \nA theory postulated in this Android SE site states\n\n...I'd say it's highly likely that this time limit is related to contractual limitations at least in some areas. Kindof like how iTunes rentals expire, or Spotify Premium offline playlists expire: if there was no expiry date at all, then there's no difference between 'accessing' and effectively 'permanently buying for free/cheap'.\n\nI also guess that Google wants to refresh the business list in the downloaded map data.  They charge businesses to advertise (not appear) in Maps and so they have an interest in keeping the downloaded data 'fresh'. <-- my $0.02\n", "Q: Search iOS App Store by sharing features included with app iOS 8 introduced sharing extensions.\nBut what apps show up in what share lists?:\n\nActivation rules tells the system when to offer a particular app's extension.

I've searched for hours, downloaded 20 [free] that seemed like they would, and none of them do.\nOne could imagine a generalized search function categorizing apps by what they share, and what sharing extensions they provide.\nIs there a way?\n\nA: No, there's no way to search the App Store like that as Apple doesn't expose that data. Most apps don't even list the ability in their description text, so while you could try running a Google search, e.g. https://www.google.com/?ion=1&espv=2#q=site%3Aitunes.apple.com%20text%20share%20extension, unfortunately it won't work too well.\n", "Q: Accidently deleted some small sized partitions when installing Windows. OSX Partition wont boot First off my problem is incredibly similar to this thread where the answer was almost reached but wasn't fully finished. Accidently deleted some small sized partitions when installing WIndows(Bootcamp). OSX Partition wont boot\nI did the same thing, when I went to install Windows I saw four partitions two large ones: OSX and Bootcamp and two small ones which I thought I accidentally created. Unwittingly I deleted the two smaller ones via the windows installer, I now believe they were the recovery and EFI partitions. Anyhow when I went to reboot holding the option key there is nothing bootable that shows up, just a blank grey screen.\nI did the cmd+opt+R and tried to reinstall OS X in place but the OS X  partition isn't mountable. I also ran some things in Terminal to give a better idea of what's going on.\nI have very important files I need to get to so reinstalling isn't really an option, I need to fix this and make it bootable or need to do data recovery. Any input is very welcome! Next time will use Time Machine....\n\n\n\nA: You didn't delete any partition. Instead the MBR got bogus by using Windows' Disk Management tool.\nInstead of the MBR you should have a pMBR. After removing the bogus MBR you have to destroy and recreate the GUID partition table:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Internet Recovery Mode\n\n*Open Terminal in the menubar Utilities -> Terminal\n\n*Get an overview (especially the gpt command is important!):\ndiskutil list\ngpt -r show disk0\n\n\n*Unmount disk0:\ndiskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0\n\n\n*Delete the MBR:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk0 bs=512 count=1\n\n\n*Destroy the GUID partition table and create a new one:\ngpt destroy disk0\ngpt create -f disk0\n\n\n*Rebuild all previous GUID partitions:\ngpt add -i 1 -b 40 -s 409600 -t C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B disk0\ngpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 166939584 -t 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk0\ngpt add -i 3 -b 167349224 -s 1269536 -t 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk0\ngpt add -i 4 -b 168620032 -s 68356096 -t EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 disk0\n\nIf you get a resource busy error after one of the steps, just unmount disk0 again with \ndiskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0\n\nDepending on your Mac model this will render your Windows installation unbootable. Check one of David Anderson answers how to restore a proper MBR entry to boot Windows if you have a MBR-bootable Mac (in contrary to GUID-bootable Macs since ~2013).\n\nA: Your GUID Partition Table (GPT) look OK. You MBR table appears to have the wrong values. You can correct this by entering the following commands in a Terminal application window. I assume you will be doing this while booted using OS X Internet Recovery. \nINPUT=$(printf  \"e  1\\nee\\n\\n1\\n\\nq\\ny\")\ndiskutil  unmountdisk  /dev/disk0\nfdisk  -e  /dev/disk0  <<<\"$INPUT\"  &>/dev/null\n\nThis will restore your MBR to a Protected MBR (PMBR) which is required for GPT partitioned drives.

It was not clearly explained, whether new iPhone 7 will be only compatible with affiliated brands rather than free to connect with any wireless headset. \n\nA: In a word, yes.\nThe iPhone 7 & 7 Plus both use Bluetooth 4.2 technology.  Considering the vast majority of wireless headphones use bluetooth, this means the iPhone 7 & 7 Plus will be able to pair with them just as previous iPhone models have in the past.\nFrom Apple's iPhone 7 / 7 Plus technical specifications page, under the Cellular & Wireless section:\n\n802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi‑Fi with MIMO\nBluetooth 4.2 wireless technology\nNFC\n\n\nA: Since this was just announced and the technical details haven't been posted, I'm only about 99% sure about this but I would say yes.  \nI'm pretty sure Apple will follow the established Bluetooth protocol so any headphones or speakers out now should work fine with the 7. \n", "Q: For a Western Digital Duo, what's the difference between creating a RAID using WD Drive Utilities vs. OS X (diskutil)? For a Western Digital Duo drive, is there a major difference between the two? OS X Disk Utility doesn't have the RAID feature now, but OS X can still create RAIDs via the command line and diskutil. WD Drive Utilities can modify RAID configuration, erase drives, etc. If formatting a RAID, is there any reason to choose one method over the other? (Namely, performance and stability.)\n\nA: There is in fact, a major difference between the two.\nThe WD Duo has hardware RAID built into the device whereas OS X RAID utility is software based RAID meaning you use CPU cycles to manage the RAID processing overhead.  \nThe WD \"offloads\" the RAID processing overhead onto itself and presents just a drive to OS X.  OS X doesn't have to do anything more than it already is doing to access it.  The WD Drive Utilities is just a management tool for the RAID array, not the RAID software itself.\n", "Q: How does one start a bash command that doesn't close on Terminal quit? I want to run a command, and not have it quit when Terminal closes.\nFor instance, if I run top & ; disown, top quits when I quit Terminal. I want to keep top alive.\nI know this is possible since the command open can do this. (For example, open -e opens up TextEdit, and when you quit out of Terminal, TextEdit stays open.)\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Use screen:\nTo start a session and a process within run screen command (e.g. screen top). Detach from the session with ctrlActrlD.\nNow you can close the Terminal session window or quit Terminal at all and the process started previously is still running.\nAfter (re-)starting Terminal you can get a list of all detached sessions with screen -list.  Use the pid to reattach to a session: screen -R [pid]. To stop the reattached session's process use the common commands (e.g. ctrlC for top) and exit to stop the session.\nIf you want to start a process in a new immediately detached session use:\nscreen -d -m command (e.g. screen -d -m top). This will create a new screen session while you get a new prompt in your currently open shell session.\nPlease check man screen for a lengthy description, key bindings and customizations.\n\nA: I think the key here is based on this statement:\n\nFor instance, if I run top & ; disown, top quits when I quit Terminal. I want to keep top alive.\n\nThe moment you quit Terminal, it immediately kills whatever you were running.  This is where terminal multiplexers come into play.\nThe solution to this is to use tmux.\ntmux is a \"terminal multiplexer\" but one of the best features about it is that it continues running even if you close Terminal.\nFrom their man page:\n\ntmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen. tmux may be detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached.\n\nSo, if you want to launch top, you could detach from it while it continued in the background even if Terminal is quit.\ntmux is available through homeberew and MacPorts.\n\n*\n\n*HomeBrew:  sudo brew install tmux\n\n*MacPorts:  sudo port install tmux\nDetailed installation info can be found on their respective sites.\nAs for using tmux, just launch Terminal and execute tmux.  You will get a Terminal screen with a green bar.\n\nExecute (for example)top.\n\nQuit and relaunch Terminal.\nTo get a list of sessions:\ntmux list-sessions\n0: 1 windows (created Wed Sep  7 18:13:21 2016) [132x24]\n\nAttach to that specific session\ntmux attach -t0\nAnd the session comes back up.\n\n\nA: When using a command you want to continue you would normally add something to the effect of:\nnohup yourcommand &\n\nThe nohup stops it from receiving hang signals, and the & essentially runs it background so you can continue to do your own thing.\nHope that helps!\n\nA: Some programs are launched as a child process of the Terminal window, so closing it will close the program. In that case, launch such programs on a separate process accordingly:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter the full path to the executable on the command line (/Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/safari)\n\n*Use the open command and the appropriate flag, such as -a for app (open -a Safari), which launches applications in a separate process (pid). Once running, you can simply close the Terminal window and the application will remain open, as opposed to using direct executable execution by whatever means you are now using.\n\n*The “osascript” command, which is OS X’s Terminal command for running “open scripting architecture” scripts like AppleScript (osascript -e 'open app \"Safari\"').\nAll three have a separate means of quitting the processes, but which are similar to each their respective means for starting them.\nKeep in mind that these are not the only three, but rather the most arcane commands available to you. I supply them because I reason that anyone running commands in the terminal is already familiar with each and every stock command available in every standard UNIX/Linux/FreeBSD distribution, and readily knows how to use the relevant ones to spawn, kill, suspend, fork, resume, join and detach threads and processes—those being FreeBSD's sole reason for existence as the operating system installed on the machines of the world's most profitable company.\nAnyway, one last thing: only the current user can run processes using the above commands; launch processes with these commands under a different user, you must enable the super user account (su), and then prefix each command with sudo.\n", "Q: How do I submit sticker apps in itunesconnect? Apple just released the GM seed for Xcode: https://developer.apple.com/download/\nIn the sticker app submission details here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/app-store/sticker-submissions/ I am unable to find how I can submit a sticker app through iTunesconnect.\nThis is what I see when I click the +:\n\nIs there supposed to be a New Sticker App link?

I am trying to switch from Windows to the OS X, but I have one problem.\nHow can I drag file to the running application on dock?\nFor example, I have running Chrome which is on full-screen mode (on another desktop) but I want to drag file to imgur.com for upload.\nIn Windows I just simply drag file to the app on taskbar and app shows and I can drag file to the browser.\n\nA: Specifically for full-screen windows, grab the file with the mouse, and without letting go of it, use Command+Tab to switch to the application you want to drop it onto. Once the application window appears, you can drop the file where you want. The reason it has to be done this way is full-screen applications are given their own desktop (\"Space\") that doesn't interact the same way as windows in all other Spaces do.\nIf the window isn't full-screen, it's easier as detailed below.\nFor a minimized application window, drag it onto that window's icon (which will be on the right side of the Dock near the trash) and continue holding for a couple of seconds while the window un-minimizes itself. For Chrome specifically, you can then drag it into the address bar or some target on the page.\nFor an icon on the left side of the Dock, do the same thing except when you hold the file over the application's icon, it will display all windows from that application (including those on other Spaces). Drag the file over the appropriate window, again holding for a couple seconds, and that window will come to the front.\nYou can show all open windows on the currently visible Space(s) by pressing F3 (if you have the System Preferences > Keyboard > \"Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\" setting enabled, you'll have to press Fn+F3) and do the same thing as you would above with the individual windows.\nIf the file is on the desktop itself, it's actually even easier: press F11 (or Fn+F11 as noted above), then grab the icon, and while still holding it, press F11 again. Whatever window(s) was/were previously present will again appear, and you can drop the file where you want it.\n", "Q: How do I transfer data and settings from one Apple Watch to another? I have an Apple Watch. I have had it for a while. I just bought a new Apple Watch. (Both are Series 1, just different sizes.)\nI would like to transfer all my data and settings from my old Apple Watch to my new Apple Watch and then sell my old Apple Watch.\nIs it possible to migrate my profile from one Apple Watch to another?\nIf so, what is the procedure?\nAll the search results I have found have to do with moving an Apple Watch to a new iPhone or restoring a backup to the same Apple Watch. Perhaps it is possible to restore a backup from an old Apple Watch onto a new one?\n\nA: iMore provides a step-by-step set of instructions to restore an old backup onto a new watch that I have summarized below.\nThe first step is to unpair the old watch from your phone. As part of that, a backup of your watch's information and settings will be created on the phone.\nNext, pair your new watch following the normal procedures - launch the Apple Watch app, tap Start Pairing, and align the watch in the viewfinder.\nOn the following screen it will state \"Your Apple Watch Is Paired.\" From here, tap on Restore from Backup, and you should be given the option of the backup you made when unpairing the old watch. Tap on that.\nYou will then need to agree with the terms and conditions, as well as enter your Apple ID username and password. Tap through the remaining screens of setting options, including a passcode, and finally it will begin the process of restoring your backup, which may take several minutes. \nOnce the restore is complete, you will have your new watch set up with all your settings and data.\n", "Q: Is there a possibility that older OS X apps will break in the new macOS? I've been using an app named CourseNotes for college and just noticed it has not been updated since 2014. I've used it for years and has a lot of important notes in it, and I don't seem to get the same functionality in apps like EverNote. \nIn the new upcoming macOS, is there a chance it will break and I will lose this data?\nI've been scanning the Internet for days and I can't seem to find a good answer. Contacting the developer has resulted in no answers whatsoever.\n\nA: Yes applications can break when a new OS is introduced. The APIs that it calls could have been changed or possibly removed.\nThis is why many apps will get updated just after an OS release and why developers get a beta test of the OS so they can check.\nIf the developer is not active anymore then you have to be the one who tests it. In large organisations there is often a complex plan to upgrade an OS: all the applications that the organisation uses have to be tested before agreement to update the OS is given. This is one reason many organisations have stayed on old versions of Windows (e.g. Windows XP) because they can't get all apps to pass or no-one has given the budget to test.\n\nA: It will most likely still work, but there's also a chance that it won't. No one can say until someone has tried it and even if you find someone who can confirm that it works for them, you should still be cautious as there is no guarantee that it will work for you.\nCourseNotes looks to have been abandoned by the developers. There have been no further updates on the app's site or the developer's twitter or facebook accounts since 2014.\nThis means that you should really think about how important the content that you have input into the app is to you and for how long you will want to continue to access it. If you have invested a lot into it and you want to continue to access the information long term, you need to look at how to migrate your data out of it and into something else.\nIf you still want to upgrade your OS, you need to ensure that you have a backup that you can revert to if you find that after you update CourseNotes doesn't work.\nThe simplest thing to do is to create a bootable image of your computer's hard drive onto an external hard drive. You will need an external hard drive that is at least as big as the space taken on your internal hard drive. You can create the image by using an app like SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner. Once the image backup is done, test it to make sure that you can boot your computer from it.\nOnce this is done, you can complete the OS update and confirm if the app still works. If it doesn't, boot from the external image drive and clone it back onto your internal drive. \n", "Q: How do I change the iTunes country while maintaining Family Sharing? My whole family is moving to different countries. My sister and I are going off to university in Europe and my parents are moving to Southeast Asia. And we are all linked with Family sharing as we share Apple Music. \nSo how do I change my location on Apple with my parents being in a different country? Can the \"child\" even be in a different country?\nThis only thing I can think of doing is getting a new family sharing set up, but I'm still not sure it can allow different countries. \nShould I abandon the Family Sharing altogether?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Family sharing is country-specific. You cannot have accounts in multiple countries in the same \"family\".\nThat said, if you don't change the region of your iTunes accounts, nothing will change. Once you change the region of the account, you will only be able to be in a \"family\" with other members in the same region.\n", "Q: Download code needed for updating to macOS Sierra GM When I click on the GM download link it asks for a download code or a gift card number?

With the imminent release of iOS 10, I'm wondering if I should upgrade my iPad 2 to iOS 9 now. Specifically, I'd like to know if I will still be able to do that after iOS 10 is released? (Currently at iOS 7)\nI know that I'll be forced to upgrade one day, as some app I like won't support iOS 7 anymore, but I'm also aware that it will make my iPad even slower, so I'd like to hold off as long as possible. But, I don't want to end up in a situation where I can't upgrade to 9 anymore, e.g. because Apple stops signing for 9 after the release of 10?\n\nA: iOS 10 is not available for the iPad 2.\nBecause of that, you will continue to be able to upgrade to iOS 9.3.5 at any time in the future. Apple continues to sign the last available firmware for all devices, which will be iOS 9.3.5 for the iPad 2.\nExamples of how the last supported version of iOS for a device continues to be signed: here\n\nA: You are free to upgrade your device anytime, if current iOS has support for your iPad device version.\nWhile you're not sure, google some reviews what's the performance of iOS 9 like on iPad 2, as this process is just one way and you cannot get back older iOS.\n", "Q: What is the recommended amount of video memory to assign to OS X El Capitan running in VirtualBox? What is the recommended amount of video memory to assign to OS X El Capitan running in VirtualBox?\nCurrently, I've set it to 48 MB on ad hoc basis, and would like to know if this is something I should adjust. I've seen a few different figures. Clearly, the default 16 MB setting may be too low.\nI am running the VirtualBox on an iMac with a 2 GB AMD graphics card. In case that can be used to accelerate the VirtualBox, then I'm assuming that there is some leeway to increase the video memory setting. But is it necessary, and how much is indeed recommendable?\n\nA: Your allocated video memory depends on what you are going to be doing with your VM.  For instance, I use 8MB for my headless FreeBSD machines and 256MB for my Windows 10 VMs.  Windows Servers 2008 or 2012 get anywhere from 16 to 128MB of RAM depending on what they are used for.\nHowever, if you set it to 256MB (max for one monitor) you should have ample memory to run El Capitan.\nI do recommend maxing out the memory in your iMac, however (32GB RAM).  That has made all the difference for me.\n", "Q: Where's iPhone 7 microphone located? From Apple’s official specs the bottom side holds two grills in addition to the Lightning port. Apple shows that the right grill holds built-in stereo speakers and a built-in microphone. The left grill only holds a built-in microphone. This suggests that only the right grill has speakers and that there are two microphones (one in each grill). \n\nThis is somewhat confusing, because it means the left grill only exists for cosmetic purposes. Also, why would they put microphone and speaker so close?\nAre my assumptions true? Is there only one microphone or two? Are there also speakers in the left grill, or only in the right?\n\nA: The iPhone 7 has four microphones (and yes, that grille is there strictly for symmetry):\n\n\n*\n\n*Two of them are located on the bottom, on either side of the Lightning port. The one near the old headphone jack has been there since the original iPhone, but iPhone 6s added another by the speaker grille as well.\n\n*One is located on the back, between the True Tone flash and iSight camera. This microphone was added in the iPhone 5. You can check out photos of iPhones prior to the 5, and it is not there.\n\n*The last one is located inside in the earpiece. This microphone was also introduced in the iPhone 5, to perform noise cancellation on the voice coming in during calls. Phil Schiller mentioned both #2 and #3 during the iPhone 5 keynote.\n\n\nAll 4 microphones are used for active noise cancellation (reducing ambient sounds) and beamforming (detecting the location of the sound source), with one being picked as the most appropriate for recording (depending on closeness to the sound source, and on clarity). For instance, while shooting video, the rear microphone would usually be picked. Since iOS 10, you can record videos in stereo, so two microphones are picked in those cases.\nDo note that all 4 microphones are always listening for “Hey Siri” functionality. You can test this simply by holding up any of the microphones to your mouth and whispering “Hey Siri.” No matter which microphone you whisper into, Siri will trigger. Whisper away from them, and Siri won’t come up. iOS picks the best microphone at any given time.\nFinally, the microphone located by the speaker grille may be used to cancel out noise from the speakers while sound is playing, just as the one inside the earpiece does for voice coming in (and now also for sound playing on an iPhone 7). And of course, sound isn’t constantly playing through your speaker, so in most instances it can simply be used for regular noise cancellation and beamforming.\nIn summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 6s, 6s+, 7 and 7+ have 4 microphones.\n\n*iPhone 5, 5c, 5s, SE, 6 and 6+ have 3 microphones.\n\n*iPhone 4 and 4s have 2 microphones.\n\n*All older iPhones include a single microphone. \n\n\nSince Apple has a tendency to remove technical specs for iPhones it no longer sells, here’s a screenshot of the iPhone 6s’s bottom dual-microphone setup, for posterity:  \nAnd iPhone SE:\n\nPS: On iPhone 4 and 4s, the second microphone is also located at the top rather than by the rear-facing camera.\n\n\nA: iPhone 6s also included the microphone in the first bore of the right speaker grill (unlike iPhone 6). It's probably a noise cancellation feature and will have the same function in iPhone 7. \nYour comment on oscillation problems are valid, and it's highly unlikely that Apple would use a mic so close to the speaker if it would include any function other than some error sampling / noise cancellation.\n", "Q: Is there a command to view Primary Volume Descriptor in iso images?

The command is:\ndrutil dumpiso <image> <block>\n\nwhere <image> is the name of an ISO image file. For example, drutil dumpiso image.iso 16 displays block 16 from an image file named image.iso and guesses the block's format.\n", "Q: two click to minimize window I got my new mac and when I maximise the window (with the upper green button) and I want to minimize  it I need to click on two buttons(since the minimize button ,middle button is greyed out...) \n why is that ? and how can I fix it that when I max the window I can min it in one click \n\n\n\n*when I click on app to close I still see the app in the dock with black dot under it, and I need to right click and close it , how can I avoid that ?

Full-screen moves an app into its own Space & removes the menu bar, unless you hover the cursor near the top of the screen. You can escape from this by hovering at the top & clicking the green button, or often the  Esc   key will perform the same task.  \nMaximise will preserve the Menu Bar & share the screen with any other app also open.\nTo specifically Maximise, rather than Full-Screen you need to hold  Opt ⌥  [sometimes labelled  Alt ⌥  the same as Windows] as you click the green button [you will see the twin arrows in the dot change to a + sign instead, see below]. Opt/clicking again will then Restore, same as Windows & you will also still have the yellow button available to Minimise.\nFull Screen\n \nMaximise\n \nYour other issue, with applications remaining in the Dock is that Mac, unlike Windows, does not quit an app when the last window is closed. (There are some exceptions to that, System Prefs, for example, will quit if you close the window.)  \nThis is an essential difference between the two platforms.  \nIf you want to quit an app, use  Cmd ⌘   Q  or Quit from the File menu.\nThis allows your current workspace in that app to be remembered & restored the next time you launch the app. Windows cannot do that.\nIf you close all windows first, then Quit, that workspace will be forgotten.\nIt would be well worth spending an hour or two going through the Apple knowledge base on Mac Basics to familiarise yourself with how it works.\nI would especially have a look at Spaces & Mission Control [multiple desktops] because that may be your ideal way to work without having to maximise/minimise all the time\n", "Q: I want to upgrade my current phone to either iphone6 or 6s should I wait until the iphone 7 has been shops for a week so that the prices drop>?

I figured out how to get all those reminders, though:\ntell application \"Reminders\"\n    activate\n    set myRemList to every reminder whose due date is less than (current date) as list\n    repeat with myitem in myRemList\n        log (get properties of myitem)\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nIs this code usable (any fatal mistakes I'm not aware of)? How can I remove the alarms?\n[Edit]\nHere's an example of what I want to achieve:\nConsider this one which reminds me to call Jon Doe:\n\nThe item is due today and a reminder is set to notify me at 14.00 (2 pm). When my planning has changed there are few of those items, popping up their reminders (\"call jon doe\" in this example). I want that \"remind me\" property to be unticked for all overdue items.\n\nA: There was no fatal mistake in the code shown in the OP, however the proper way to use current date, in this case, is by letting the current application do it, not Reminders, as it actually errors out but does recover, hence not fatal. Nonetheless one should write code that's not going to needlessly error out. So, before the tell application \"Reminders\" code block, set current date to a variable and use the variable within the Reminders code block, as shown in the code further below.\nNote that I personally do not use the Reminders app, however going by what's exposed in Reminders's AppleScript Dictionary, the following properties, not marked asr/o, are what can be programmatically changed for the reminder class.\n\nname (text) : the name of the reminder \nid (text, r/o) : the unique identifier of the reminder \nbody (text) : the notes attached to the reminder \ncompleted (boolean) : Is the reminder completed? \ncompletion date (date) : the completion date of the reminder \ncontainer (list, r/o) : the container of the reminder \ncreation date (date, r/o) : the creation date of the reminder \ndue date (date) : the due date of the reminder \nmodification date (date, r/o) : the modification date of the reminder \nremind me date (date) : the remind date of the reminder \npriority (integer) : the priority of the reminder \n\nAs a test, I created a reminder named \"Test\" and set the remind me [√] check box to yesterdays date, so as to conform with the search parameter in the code further below.\nThen, in Script Editor, I used the following line of code to get its properties.\ntell application \"Reminders\" to get properties of reminder named \"Test\"\n\nIt returned:\n\n\n*\n\n*{due date:date \"Saturday, September 10, 2016 2:00:00 PM\", modification date:date \"Sunday, September 11, 2016 1:49:35 PM\", class:reminder, body:missing value, completed:false, completion date:missing value, id:\"3F0EF538-5DF6-4F1C-8024-922B5D45EB9B\", name:\"Test\", container:list id \"9EB58C9B-EF63-4B72-88C3-A4FFA3C7272F\" of application \"Reminders\", priority:0, creation date:date \"Sunday, September 11, 2016 1:49:13 PM\", remind me date:date \"Saturday, September 10, 2016 2:00:00 PM\"}\nI then manually unchecked the remind me [] check box and ran the ... get properties ... code again.\nIt returned:\n\n\n*\n\n*{due date:missing value, modification date:date \"Sunday, September 11, 2016 1:49:35 PM\", class:reminder, body:missing value, completed:false, completion date:missing value, id:\"3F0EF538-5DF6-4F1C-8024-922B5D45EB9B\", name:\"Test\", container:list id \"9EB58C9B-EF63-4B72-88C3-A4FFA3C7272F\" of application \"Reminders\", priority:0, creation date:date \"Sunday, September 11, 2016 1:49:13 PM\", remind me date:missing value}\nThe primary difference between the two was the first and last items in the list, i.e., the due date and the remind me date, went from due date:date \"Saturday, September 10, 2016 2:00:00 PM\" to due date:missing value with the same for remind me date, having remind me date:missing value too.\nSo I tested the code below using both preferences, due date and remind me date just to see if there was any difference and there wasn't, as removing one removed the other.\nThe following code will remove both the due date and remind me date from any Reminder that's older then current date and has not been marked completed, at the time the code is run, as this is what occurs, at least to the properties of a reminder, in one has manually unchecked the remind me [] check box.\nset curDate to current date\n\ntell application \"Reminders\"\n    activate\n    set myRemList to every reminder whose due date is less than curDate as list\n    repeat with myitem in myRemList\n        if completed of myitem is false then\n            delete remind me date of myitem\n        end if\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n\nThe code above can also be written as shown below. This actually is a better way to write it, as it makes for a smaller list returned because it's then only creating a list of items (reminders) that have not yet been marked as  completed. As after all, ones already marked as completed are not going to trigger an \"alarm\".\nset curDate to current date\n\ntell application \"Reminders\"\n    activate\n    set myRemList to every reminder whose completed is false and due date is less than curDate as list\n    repeat with myitem in myRemList\n        delete remind me date of myitem\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n\nBased upon your edited OP, if this does not do what is needed, then I do not know what else I can offer, as I can only work within what properties are exposed and editable.\nNote: I was not able to reproduce the reminder as shown in your edit, i.e. the line starting with \"due\" directly under the [] At a Location check box and above \"repeat None\". However, what is now offered as the answer to \"remove all alarms of all overdue reminders with AppleScript on OS X\" does mimic the manual action of unchecking the remind me [] check box, which is what you've now asked for through the edit made to the OP. I hope this resolves your issue.\n", "Q: Apple App Store: Create app page for upcoming app From yesterday's iPhone 7 release event, Super Mario Run by Nintendo will be available on iOS soon. After searching same on iTunes, I found out that its iTunes page is available with NOTIFY button instead of the regular GET button.\nHow to do that? What is provision provided by Apple to show app's iTune page without actually uploading app ?\n\n\nA: Notify is a feature created by Apple which appears to be solely for their Nintendo app launch partnership at this current time. It's not available for general developer program members yet and it is unclear if/when it will be available in iTunes Connect.\n\nThe feature is currently only for Super Mario Run as far as we can tell. Whether it will apply across the entire app store is yet to be determined. It's also unlike the \"Pre-order\" button from the music and film sections of the iTunes store, since it doesn't give you the option to purchase the content ahead of time.\n\nSource: http://www.cnet.com/news/new-itunes-notifications-will-tell-you-when-mario-is-live/\n", "Q: Removing 3rd party extensions I found that I have a lot of unknown 3rd party plugins installed in my Mac. \n\nI thought they are Safari extension, but Extensions popup menu in Safari do not show these extensions. \n\nHow to remove these unknown extensions?

Disc 1 and Disc 2 of double albums are not consecutive despite the information, names etc are correctly uploaded.\nHow to get such albums displayed in sequence using the cover flow option?\nThank you for any contribution\nHave a good day\nAlessandro\n\nA: Whenever I import a two disc set into iTunes, I edit the metadata so that the album names match across the two discs, rather than having disc numbers as part of each album name. It is still easy to see which disc is which because the metadata includes disc numbers (separate from the track numbers) which are independent of the album name.\nAs I recall an iPod sorts first by disc number and then by track number (or maybe iTunes does that and the iPod inherits the result), so the tracks play in what seems like the correct order.\n\nA: I don't know if you solved the problem, but no matter where you get the tracks from (internet, cd etc) the tags can be wrong. A space at the end of the name results in two different albums or artists, and this is not immediately visible. You should select the tracks in iTunes, go to File>Get info and give all of them the same artist, album, date etc and in the fields \"disc\" enter (for example in a 3-disc release) 1 of 3 for the first, 2 of 3 for the second, 3 of 3 for the last.\nPlease note that the tags you change/see in iTunes have nothing to do with the file names you see in the directory, desktop or wherever they're stored.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use Safari on OSX with \"panes\" like vim splits I'd like to have two \"tabs\" open in one window, but with the content of the two displayed pages simultaneously visible like this:\n==================\n|  content of 1  |\n|  content of 1  |\n-------------------\n|  content of 2  |\n|  content of 2  |\n===================\n\nI don't want the toolbar and location bar atop each content area, but I could tolerate this.\nThe difference between this arrangement and just two Safari windows opened one atop the other is that if I resize the single containing window, the panes resize in lockstep with it.\nBy the way, it would be even better still if I could have these groups of panes within a tab, and tab between such groups (again, like vi(m) tabs/splits).\nThis doesn't seem remotely possible with basic Safari, but maybe a plugin enables it?\n\nA: I am not aware of anything, Safari extension or otherwise that would allow you to split a tab in that way (one over the other, both visible, if I understand correctly). Though I am not the end-all oracle of Safari extensions. Searching Safari extensions repositories (apple or others) would be how I would approach this.\nPerhaps there is such an extension for Firefox, Chrome or even Opera that I am not aware of?\n", "Q: iMessage Plugin Gone from Messages So I accidentally deleted the iMessages plugin from the Messages app on El Capitan. Now the app is broken and nothing works. Anyway I could get this back?\n\n\nA: Oddly enough this usually has a simple fix to it. Yes you may have to reinstall MacOS but that can be done over top of what you already have with no danger of losing anything. However another approach might be in order.\nDownload the latest combo update from Apple here. Run it, and reboot when done. it is likely to fix the issue. \nIf not then boot into recovery mode and reinstall your OS. You will then likely have to re-apply any subsequent updates again to the base system that was just reinstalled.\n", "Q: How do iPhones and Macs handle OS storage? This topic came up yesterday from a friend of mine who owns both a Macbook and an iPhone 6. His iPhone is almost out of storage space; about 500MB remaining, and he claims this is due to all the iOS operating systems he has installed over his time with the phone. He also says that this is the same with Apple computers. When he installed up to Mavericks, he lost a lot of storage space because the new operating system \"installed separately from the previous one\", taking up more space. \nIt just doesn't make any sense, and I feel like he is wrong, but I'm not sure how to explain it, nor can I find any data to back up his claim or the opposite.\nSo, the question(s) is, how is storage of the operating systems accomplished for Macbooks and iPhones? Are previous versions of operating systems indeed stored on the phone, even after updating to the newest one? Would this contribute to his lack of available space on the iPhone? Finally, how could this be resolved without taking it to an Apple store?\n\nA: When IOS is updated the old operating system is replaced. the same is true for MacOS. So Tetsujin's comment is correct, if less than helpful ;-). But understand the caveats.\nIOS sometimes does not delete old temporary files and the file system fills up with junk that is difficult to delete. If you back-up the phone in question to your computer, erase all content and settings and then restore from the backup just created those temp files will be gone. So trying this might give you some of your \"missing\" space back.\nFor MacOS when a new version is installed (EG Yosemite to El Capitan) the installer is usually left on the computer in the /Applications folder. I will usually make a restore USB key with that installer and then delete it as they are often fairly large (5GB or so).\nWith the Mac temp/cache files may also build up with time and utilities like the (free) Onyx will clean up those files and often free up some space.\n", "Q: Using Two External Monitors for my MBP (E. 2015) but resolution is low on the other one I'm using my MacbookPro Early 2015 to connect two external displays.

I tried using the Alt/Option method and it is able to use 1920 x 1080 but the resolution is squezzed horizontally. \nAny way to fix this?\nPS: It also detects the display as a projector for some reason and my Asus as a TV\n\nA: If the Samsung display has other inputs, you're likely to have better luck with digital inputs (DVI or HDMI) than with analog inputs (VGA). You'll need a different Mini DisplayPort adapter for that.\n", "Q: How Finder tracks location of items in the sidebar In Windows File Explorer if I create a shortcut to a folder on the disk and then rename/remove/move to trash the folder I will be no longer able to click and open the link.\nOn Mac if I drag a folder to the Finder sidebar and then do the same operations with the folder, Finder will track it somehow and let me open the folder even if I move it to the Trash.\nWhat macOS API is responsible for this?\n\nA: I'm not sure if there's an API for it, per se, it's simply the way it operates. Items in the Finder sidebar are actually aliases to the original item.\nFrom What Are Aliases, Symbolic Links, and Hard Links in Mac OS X:\n\nWhen you create an alias for an object, the system creates a small data file that includes the current path to the object, as well as the object's inode name. Each object's inode name is a long string of numbers, independent of the name you give the object, and guaranteed to be unique to any volume or drive your Mac uses.\n...\nWhen you access an alias, the system checks to see if the original item is at the pathname stored in the alias file. If it is, then the system accesses it, and that's that. If the object has been moved, the system searches for a file that has the same inode name as the one stored in the alias file.\n\n(Or do you mean an API that allows you to create aliases from your own application?)\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 2014 shuts down at random intervals Thanks @fbara for suggestion to add more details\nDevice: MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)\nOS: 10.11.6 (15G1004)\npmset -g log from one of the times it occurred\n\nUUID: (null) 2016-09-07 20:15:11 -0700 Start                  powerd\n  process is started 2016-09-07 20:15:11 -0700\n    Summary- [System: No Assertions] Using Batt(Charge: 81) 2016-09-07\n  20:15:11 -0700 Assertions             Kernel Idle sleep preventers:\n  IODisplayWrangler 2016-09-07 20:15:43 -0700 Assertions            PID\n  104(hidd) Created UserIsActive\n  \"com.apple.iohideventsystem.queue.tickle\" 00:00:00  id:0x0x9000001f5\n  [System: PrevIdle DeclUser kDisp] 2016-09-07 20:16:52 -0700 Assertions\n    PID 261(Google Chrome) Created NoDisplaySleepAssertion \"Playing\n  video\" 00:00:00  id:0x0x500000223 [System: PrevIdle PrevDisp DeclUser\n  kDisp]\n\n\nA: Please make sure you also check your Macbook for excessive dust inside! \nI have a Macbook pro which shutdown randomly (and gave the shutdown cause -128 error, and also the reference code PPT004 - the battery requires service).

This sounds a bit SPAM-y?\nIf you have created a 'process' that does some checks and then if there is work to be performed - it does its work and when finished goes back to \"sleep\".

I'm really not sure whether this is really on-topic, but here goes...\nHow does the iPhone Upgrade Program work?\nI understand the information on the Apple site - I pay them monthly, no interest, with a small upfront payment & after a year I can get a new phone.

In the \"Getting the latest iPhone has never been easier\" section of the upgrade program site you posted it says you have to pay 11 monthly payments (you might as well think of it as 12 months because the upfront payment is in essence your first month). So when you have paid the monthly installment 11 times, you have 2 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn in the phone for an upgrade while restarting both timers (the 11 monthly payments + 1st down payment and the 20 month full contract).\n\n*Continue paying for the phone until the 20 month contract is done and the phone is 100% yours.\n\n\nThe important thing here is that you are never paying for your old phone once you upgrade it.\n\nA: One thing to note about whether option 1 or 2 is correct for your initial question, you can only have one iPhone Upgrade Program running at a time under your name. You could never be in the situation described in option 1. In order to not return the old device (iPhone 7), you would have to pay off the remaining balance due on it in order to start a new program (loan) for iPhone 7s/8/10th Anniversary Gold-Plated \"Yeah, Sure, Now You Think Dumping the Headphone Jack is a Great Idea Since All the Android Devices Have Done It\" Edition.\nTo answer your related question, you can sell your iPhone to Apple for \"up to\" £240. You are likely to get more for it elsewhere, though, and selling your current iPhone (which you did not buy under the Upgrade Program) is not required to purchase a phone with the Upgrade Program.\nOnce you are in the program, though, if you wish to upgrade at this time next year with a new installment plan, you will be required to return the phone you get this month or pay off the remaining balance on it (~8 months of payments) in order to do so.\n", "Q: How to switch input in split panel terminal?

BitDefender scans your machine when prompted (good for an ongoing issue) but does nothing in the background. \nIf you want constant protection in the future (that promises to block malware from being downloaded onto your Mac in the first place, and has fulfilled its promise twice for me) you can try Avast, which is also free (but not available from the Mac App Store, just their website). \nHope this helps, let me know if your problem reappears in the future.\n", "Q: Automator: Applescript to execute keystrokes for each nested folder in Finder Help!!\nI have put in many hours trying to solve this and feel it is time to get some help :)\nI am trying to write an Applescript in Automator that will execute certain keystrokes in Finder for the parent folder and each sub-folder.\nSo far I can only get the keystrokes to be applied to the parent folder that is selected during the execution of the script; the sub-folders remain as they were without having had the keystrokes applied.\nThe keystrokes are specific to Finder and make the folder arranged by \"Kind\" and sorted by \"Name\".\nHere is my code:\nactivate application \"Finder\"\n\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set theFolders to every folder of (choose folder) as alias list\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    repeat with eachFolder in theFolders\n        keystroke \"2\" using {control down, command down}\n        keystroke \"1\" using {control down, option down, command down}\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nThe code makes sense to me in my limited knowledge of Applescript, but obviously it is not working correctly.\nAny advice?\n\nA: If I understood what you want, i.e. select a folder and then it and every sub-folder within it, including sub-folders of subfolders etc., gets these setting applied.\nIn order to pass the keystrokes to the target folders each needs to be the active window in Finder first, then System Events can send the keystrokes.\nSo, I'd write the code as in the example below.\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    set parentFolder to (choose folder) as alias\n    set theFolders to every folder of entire contents of parentFolder as alias list\n    set theFolders to {parentFolder} & theFolders    -- # Adds the chosen folder to the list of folders to be acted upon.\n    repeat with eachFolder in theFolders\n        open eachFolder\n        delay 0.5\n        activate eachFolder    -- # This is done to ensure the target folder's window has focus before being acted upon.\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            keystroke \"2\" using {control down, command down}    -- # Sets: View > Arrange By > Kind\n            keystroke \"1\" using {control down, option down, command down}    -- # Sets: View > Sort By > Name\n        end tell\n        close eachFolder\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n\nIf you're wanting to act only on the top level sub-folders within the parent folder, then in place of: \nset theFolders to every folder of entire contents of parentFolder as alias list\nUse the following:\nset theFolders to every folder of parentFolder as alias list    \n\n\nNote that the delay 0.5 may not be absolutely necessary however I added it because without it, the series of opening and closing folder's windows can go by so fast it's disconcerting and slowing it down a bit eases that. Although it may also be necessary, depending on how fast/slow the processing takes place, to ensure each folder's window in the repeat loop is actually available and has focus in order to receive the keystrokes. In either case, the value of delay may/can be changed as necessary/wanted to allow the tasks to properly occur and in a visual manner that appears more natural then a barrage of opening/closing windows leaving one to wonder, what just happened. \n\nA: @user3439894 deserves the credit for answering this.\nThe code proposed by user3439894 was:\ntell application \"Finder\"\nactivate\nset parentFolder to (choose folder) as alias\nset theFolders to every folder of entire contents of parentFolder as alias\nset theFolders to {parentFolder} & theFolders    \nrepeat with eachFolder in theFolders\n    open eachFolder\n    delay 0.5\n    activate eachFolder \n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        keystroke \"2\" using {control down, command down} \n        keystroke \"1\" using {control down, option down, command down}    \n    end tell\n    close eachFolder\nend repeat\nend tell\n\nThis did not work as written and returned the following error:\n\nSo, not being an Applescript expert I messed around a little bit with the 4th line of code:\nset theFolders to every folder of entire contents of parentFolder as alias\n\nand changed it to this:\nset theFolders to every folder of entire contents of parentFolder as list\n\nand it worked!\nA few comments about this.\nI used it to modify the viewing arrange/sort parameters of thousands of folders - most of which I don't look at, but since it was automated and easy, why not. I ran it with a delay of 0.1 instead of 0.5 and it worked fine. I did not try it without a delay.\nThe only kink I ran into was there seemed to be some kind of cumulative black hole associated with the code. When I ran it on my directory that had thousands of sub-folders, it took nearly 7 hours to complete the operation. My MacBook fan kicked in as the CPU temperature rose drastically. Strangely, the time required to execute each set of keystrokes somehow increased with time - it literally just got slower and slower. I was not able to do any diagnosis since the routine was not running in the background, but actually running as if I was doing it manually.\nI let it run overnight and found that my computer was still sluggish i.e. all programs ran slow and the little spinny wheel popped up for the simplest of tasks. I did manage to open Activity Monitor and noticed that the WindowServer process was using some ~130% of the CPU - how that is possible, I do not know, but that is what it said. So I rebooted and the problem went away.\nHere is a screenshot of the Automator summary shown at the end of the process:\n\nLike I said, just under 7 hours. But it was worth it!\nIf I were to do it again I would run it only on the parent directories that I access with some regularity.\nNow I can finally get back to what I was intending to do in the first place before I found this \"problem\" :) Malcolm in the Middle: Hal tries to change a light bulb\n", "Q: iOS 9.3.5 Apple Music can't play albums any more The first song repeats forever.

Normally I back up with Time Machine locally, CrashPlan remotely, and I use CarbonCopyCloner weekly and store the images on an external drive not connected to my machine.\nI thought this would be a cinch, since I had a clone from just a few days earlier.  However every restored clone exhibited the same issues, even when restoring from weeks before the issue began to appear.\nSo my fallback was to restore from Time Machine.  I nuked my boot drive and reinstalled Mavericks fresh, then restored from Time Machine.  Somehow that process removed my Recovery Partition so I installed Mavericks again on top of the restored drive, and everything appeared fine after that.  The previous issues all vanished.\nNow the trouble is, Most of the directories on my separate \"data drive\" (the 1TB internal drive that came with my iMac) are set to \"No Value\" for the owner.  Of course I'm the admin on my system, so I can do a Get Info on every single one and change them, but then there are folders within folders within... you get the idea.  It's a total mess.\nNow I can of course set the value of the top level folder to what I need it to be and apply to enclosed items, but that sets the user AND permissions of every single file and directory below, to the same thing.  This is merely a documents drive (symlinked from various user directories on the boot drive like Downloads, Documents, etc.) so I think it should be safe to do so, but I still really don't like the idea of giving every single file permissions of 755 along with the folders (or every folder set to 644 along with the files).\nSo, first is there any way I can get the permissions all back to what they were before and should be now?  Disk Utility won't do it since it's not a system volume.  And secondly, if there isn't a way to get the permission back to normal, is it safe to just make everything 755?  And by safe I don't mean in a security context (this is my personal machine at home, not worried about anyone accessing files they shouldn't), I just mean safe for the operation of OS X Mavericks.\n\nA: You can change just the owner and leave the permissions alone. In fact, on the command line those are separate operations. If the problem is just ownership you can use something like:\nsudo chown -R username /Volumes/blah/\n\n", "Q: What are the software differences between a standard and plus version of an iPhone? (e.g. 7 vs 7+) Apple is pretty good at documenting the hardware differences between iPhone models such as the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. \nHowever, I know there are software differences as well that don't seem to be documented. When making my decision to purchase one over the other, I want to consider these differences as well.\n\nA: iPhone X Plus vs. iPhone X features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Horizontal rotation on home screen, which can speed up folder browsing.\n\n*Uses regular horizontal size class when device is rotated to landscape orientation. This allows apps such as Notes to display the list of notes on the left hand side and the note details on the right-hand side in a split pane view.\n\n\niPhone 7 Plus vs. iPhone 7 features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bokeh effect as @tetsujin mentioned.\n\n\nA: One key 'software' difference is the soft-focus capability of the 7 Plus, using the dual camera setup to create an artificial depth of field in portrait photography.\nSee Two cameras in iPhone 7 Plus allow synthetic zoom, soft-focus backgrounds, usually only obtainable using wide aperture lenses with short depth of field.\nThough it requires the dual 28/56mm lenses to make this possible, the actual blur, or bokeh effect is done entirely in software.\nThis feature alone is what would sway me to the 7 Plus; I've always hated the lenses on mobile phones.\n", "Q: Missing icon styles for Vanilla LibreOffice after update As title says, my installation of LibO (from \"Collabora\" -- the one in the Mac Appstore) is now missing several icon sets with the recent upgrade.

My MacBook recognised the battery and it had no random shutdowns for a while. However, it was a bad choice because the new battery barely lasted me for a few months before it started to expand. It pushed against the MacBook trackpad until it cracked the trackpad glass.\nWith that, I decided to say goodbye to my old MBP and I bought a new MBP in Jan 2017.\n\nMy MacBook Pro (13-inch, Early 2011) (aka MacBookPro8,1) running OS X 10.10.5 Yosemite has just crossed the 1000 battery cycle count mark.\nIt now suffers from random shutdowns without me prompting anything. I am sure it is not a userland software problem.\nWhat I have done:\n\n*\n\n*reset my SMC several times\n\n*checked Console.app for .panic files - none exists\n\nSo I read further and found that Apple says upgrade your SMC to 1.69f4 (SMC 1.7). My current SMC version is 1.68f99. However, the update installer throws an alert:\n\nThe update is not supported by your system.\n\nTurns out the system requirements are\n\nOS X  10.7.5\nOS X 10.8.2\n\nbut I am running Yosemite. Any advice?\n\nA: any luck with your issue? I am having SMC related issues on my early 2011 13-inch MacBook Pro (aka MacBookPro8,1) too. Also want to update SMC to 1.69f4 but on Sierra I'm not allowed to.\nCuriously, the description for this update on Apple's website doesn't specifically list the 13-inch model. Also curiously, digging into the .pkg file there are 4 other packages, named MacBookProSMCUpdate, MBP18, MBP91 and MBP92, which contain the SMC file for the following models, respectively:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBookProSMCUpdate: 2010 17-inch MacBook Pro \n\n*MBP18: 2010 15-inch MacBook Pro\n\n*MBP91: 2011 15-inch MacBook Pro\n\n*MBP92: 2011 17-inch MacBook Pro\n\n\nThis info was retrieved from the names of folders/files buried within payload files.\nThat all seems to indicate that, although this update is listed on Apple's website as for the early 2011 13-inch MacBook Pro, the software inside is intended to use in other machines. Either that or Apple used totally inconsistent naming for the files and folder inside the package.\nWith some more digging, I found that I COULD manually install an SMC update through an EFI command-line mode in rEFInd. I have not yet attempted that as I'm aware of the risks and don't want to finish bricking my Mac with a wrong SMC firmware.\nSo i guess my question is: Has anyone with the same Mac model successfully updated its SMC firmware with version 1.7 (1.69f4) and can confirm that it is INDEED intended for this Mac model (MacbookPro8,1)?\nIf not, is there any other official word from Apple regarding the right number of the latest SMC update for this model?\nAny hints are appreciated!\n\nA: There seems to be a problem on the Apple KnowledgeBase page.\n\nMacBook Pro (15-inch, Early 2011) MacBookPro8,2       1.68f99 (SMC 1.6)\n    MacBook Pro (13-inch, Early 2011)     MacBookPro8,1       1.69f4 (SMC 1.7)\n\nBoth of these packages have the same name without version numbers when downloaded.\nBoth seem to address the same thing or kind of problem:\n\nMacBook Pro SMC Firmware Update 1.6:\n\nThis update addresses a rare issue on some Apple notebooks where a battery that has accumulated more than 1000 charge cycles may unexpectedly shut down or stop functioning.\nPost Date: Jan 30, 2013 –– File Size: 666 KB ––\n  System Requirements: OS X 10.6.8, OS X  10.7.5, OS X 10.8.2 or later\n\nContainin the actual files : 2010MacBookPro13SMC16, 2011MacBookPro13SMC16\n\nMacBook Pro SMC Firmware Update 1.7\n\nThis update is recommended for MacBook Pro (Mid 2010) and MacBook Pro (Early 2011) 15 and 17 inch models.\n  This update addresses a rare issue on some Apple notebooks where a battery that has accumulated more than 1000 charge cycles may unexpectedly shut down or stop functioning.\nPost Date: Dec 12, 2012 –– File Size: 703 KB ––\n  System Requirements: OS X  10.7.5, OS X 10.8.2\n\nContaining the actual files: 2010MacBookPro15SMC17, 2010MacBookPro17SMC17, 2011MacBookPro15SMC17, 2011MBP17.smc \n\nThat makes the version\n\"SMC Update 1.6\"\nthe right one for your model MacBook Pro 13inch 8,1 Early 2011.\n\nWhat is the problem on Apple's page?\nThey seem to have switched the SMC version numbers around, wrongly.\nOn a MacBook Pro 8,2 15inch Early 2011 the version number is 1.69f4. (Can't check 13inch now.)\nEffectively Apple says per the table on its knowledgebase page: \"Upgrade to SMC1.7\" but meant to say 'upgrade to SMC1.6'?\nSMC1.6 contains Version: 1.68f99. (That's what the binary identifies itself with at least)\n2011MBP13.smc   Version: 1.68f99\n2011MBP15.smc   Version: 1.69f4\n\n\nAs to the supported versions of Mac OS X form which to run thiese updaters:\nMy 2011s went from Snow Leopard straight to Mavericks. Either this update (1.7 in this case) was supported in Mavericks as well or I booted temporarily into a version of (Mountain) Lion on an external drive just to apply this update.\nTherefore it seems that you guessed at the problem and found bad advice on Apple's part on one page relating to version numbers that you read correctly.\nIf you are already on the latest SMC version for your machine, it may be a hardware problem with your battery after all.\n\nAs a limited workaround in general to get the latest versions of firmwares: Apple doesn't distribute these as standalone packages anymore, as the above (outdated) page demonstrates.\nYou might still get the latest for your machine by installing a later version of macOS onto an external drive, which now should prompt an update of those components en passant. These versions should then still be available in or work with Yosemite, if you want to keep that system.\n(As I can't check 13inch, for SMC I have no data, but your EFi BootRom will get an update if you install High Sierra at least.

I really need Dual boot on this machine for some work.\n\nA: Your Windows 7 DVD probably is defective. Either that, or the optical (DVD) drive is defective. I assume you are using your internal optical drive. If not then, then the external optical drive is defective or may not be compatible.\nI assume you your firmware is up to date. Although, on a 2011 model, this should not be the cause of your problem.\nTry this. Insert the DVD in the optical (DVD) drive. Restart the Mac and hold down the option key. A DVD icon should appear with the label \"Windows\". Select this icon and continue booting. If everything is OK, then the Windows installer should start. (If prompted, you may have to hit the space bar on the keyboard.) I assume the installer will not start, thus indicating either the DVD or the optical drive is at fault. If the installer starts, then exit and post a comment below.\n", "Q: SRM gone in macOS Sierra (10.12) I've just updated to macOS 10.12 and when I try to execute srm in Terminal, it says -bash: srm: command not found. \nIs srm removed? How to fix this?\n\nA: Since this question was originally answered two things have happened:\n\n\n*\n\n*homebrew-dupes was merged into homebrew-core\n\n*srm was deleted from homebrew-core\nIf you try to install it now it will give you details of the deleting commit and a suggestion to create your own tap if you still need it. I have done so here.\nYou can install it using Homebrew: brew install khell/homebrew-srm/srm\n\nA: From this comment:\n\ncan you come up with a better idea or safely removing files from SSD\n  on newer macs? – Niktin Roman \n\nThere's no need for srm; provided that TRIM is enabled on your machine1\nTRIM support handles this for you. When you delete a file from your drive, the OS will mark the file space as \"not in use\" - this applies to  any drive. On an SSD, unlike a HDD,  a TRIM command is sent to wipe any data in that marked space.  This allows your SSD to be able to write data to that marked space as if it was brand new and never used, and  skip the traditional  deletion process.\nIf you are looking for more security, turn on FileVault.\nPer Apple Support:\n\nNote: With an SSD drive, Secure Erase and Erasing Free Space are not\n  available in Disk Utility. These options are not needed for an SSD\n  drive because a standard erase makes it difficult to recover data from\n  an SSD. For more security, consider turning on FileVault encryption\n  when you start using your SSD drive.\n\nI also advise against using srm because it issues more and unnecessary write operations to the SSD, thus shortening it's lifespan.  From the man page:\n\nsrm  removes  each  specified file by overwriting, renaming, and\ntruncating it before unlinking\n\n\n1 TRIM comes enabled by default if you your Mac came with an SSD preinstalled.  if you added an SSD after the fact, then you must enable TRIM by issuing the command sudo trimforce enable in Terminal.\n\nA: rm has a -P switch that will overwrite the file three times before deleting. Better than nothing, I suppose.\n\nA: Not yet running macOS 10.12 however under OS X 10.8.5 the man page for srm in the NOTES section states:\n\nDevelopment and discussion of srm is carried out at\n  <http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=3297>, which is also\n  accessible via <http://srm.sourceforge.net>.\n\nNow you'd have to download the source code and compile it for yourself. This would require Command Line Tools for Xcode be installed. Not sure if still applicable under macOS 10.12 however, see How to Install Command Line Tools in OS X Mavericks & Yosemite (Without Xcode) for details. Or in Terminal use the following command: xcode-select --install\nI downloaded the latest source code and it compiled without errors under OS X 10.8.5, although that doesn't mean it will under macOS 10.12 but it's probably the only choice you've got if srm has been removed.\nThat said, I probably would only srm on rotational HDD's not SSD's.\n\nA: Use Homebrew, as suggested here:\nbrew install homebrew/dupes/srm\nbrew link --force srm\n\n\nA: UPDATE: In recent macos versions (released in ~2021 or later) this does not work anymore\nTo securely delete a file/folder on MacOS Sierra without external utilities use rm with the -P switch:\n## delete a single file\nrm -Pv wikileak1.txt\n\n## delete a folder recursively\nrm -Pvrf ~/.wikileaks\n\nFrom the man page:\n\n -P          Overwrite regular files before deleting them.  Files are\n\n\n             overwritten three times, first with the byte pattern 0xff,\n             then 0x00, and then 0xff again, before they are deleted.\n\n\n -v          increase verbosity\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: In case you installed GNU coreutils from homebrew with the default names, e.g. brew install coreutils --default-names, then, depending on how you configured your PATH, the GNU version of rm could shadow the Mac version at /bin/rm and it won't accept the -P option.\nUse which -a rm to double-check.\n\n\nA: There are plenty of good reasons not to use secure deletion tools (srm, shred, rm -P, etc) on modern systems (with TRIM-enabled SSDs and/or journalled file systems). @Allan's answer in particular is spot on.\nHowever, if you really, really want to restore srm, someone's published a Homebrew tap here that works. Ie:\nbrew install khell/homebrew-srm/srm\nsrm secrets.txt\n\n(After you've installed Homebrew, obviously.)\n\nA: sudo port install srm\nthat will do\n", "Q: Where is my macOS installer file located?

I already own, and still use my original release Apple Watch, released Spring 2015. I love the bands that I own and have no need nor interest in another one.\nApple's Gallery and Pre-Order page lists the body and bands together, is it possible to buy a Series 2 Watch Body only, and forego the band?\n\nA: Apple Watch bands fit the watch based on its size, either 38MM or 42MM, and are interchangeable between both series, however at the present time Apple only sells the Apple Watch, either series, with a band. There is no SKU available in the computer to order without a band.

Is there a way to let iTunes automatically play a song after listening to a song I searched (not a part of a playlist), supposedly a \"related\" song?\nI'm aiming for something like Youtube's \"Up next\" feature, also available on Soundcloud.\n\nA: So, apparently that's the radio / station feature. Just need to click the three dots button of a song and select Start Station.\nThing is, that button (Start Station) was grayed out for me.

Does disabling \"App Refresh\" in the Settings on iPhone (with iOS 9.3.4) actually stop an app from running in the background?\nBecause I actually disabled \"App Refresh\" for all apps (globally). And then I started the app Nike Running, and then after it started, then I started Pokemon Go.\nSo Pokemon Go should be the foreground app, and Nike Running should be the background app.  However, when I stopped walking or continued to walk, the phone did vibrate with the Nike Running voice about the walk pausing and resuming. So it looks like Nike Running is running in the background despite the App Refresh being disabled?\n\nA: Here's Apple's definition of Background App Refresh:\n\nApps can continue to run for a short period of time and are then set to a suspended state so they are not actively in use, open, or taking up system resources. They will instantly launch when you return to them. Certain tasks or services can continue to run in the background. To lessen the effect on battery life, normal app background refreshing is scheduled for efficient times, such as when your device is connected to Wi-Fi, plugged into a power source, or being actively used. When Background App Refresh is on, apps that take advantage of this feature can refresh themselves in the background.\n\nA key part of that definition is ...apps that take advantage of this feature....  Perhaps Nike coded their app to take advantage of some of those features while continuing to run in the background (to update your exercise location, stats, etc).  \nThere's a good read for this on Background App Refresh in Layman's Terms and I would recommend you read it to get a better understanding on how the system is setup and how it's used by apps.\n", "Q: Will the new lightning EarPods work with iPad? The new iPhone 7 has no headphone jack, meaning that Apple has to release EarPods with a lightning connector. Will these new EarPods work with older devices?

If I factory reset my iPhone 6 (currently running iOS 9.3.5), which version of iOS will be installed after the reset?\n\nA: Erasing All Contents and Settings (what most people call “factory reset”) does not change/remove your operating system. Whatever OS you had installed prior to the reset will remain after your iPhone reboots.\n", "Q: Finder - No Services Apply I have services set up, particularly the one for opening Terminal from a folder.  However, it doesn't appear in the context menu and in Finder > Services, there is nothing except \"No services apply\"  \nI'm using El Capitan 10.11.6 \nAnyone else have this problem?\n\nA: You have to click on a file or folder to select it and then the Services menu will work. You can get to the Services from either the Finder menu bar or by Control-clicking (right-clicking) on an item.\n", "Q: How can I check what permissions an app store app will be granted? Before I download an app from the Mac App Store I'd like to know if what if any permissions it gets. Is there a way to check? My understanding is that certain apps can ask Apple to grant permissions beyond the default. If true how I can check what those permissions are?\nAlso, while we're at it what are the default permissions? Ideally I'd like Mac App Store apps to have no permissions. In other words, can read file out of their standbox, can't read my contacts, can't send notifications, can't look at my photos, etc etc etc.\n\nA: Apps are not granted any permissions by default. The first time an app requests access to each of Location, Contacts, Calendars, and other such data, an OS dialog will show prompting you to allow or deny access. Once you've allowed or denied access, this access is maintained and can be changed in System Preferences Security & Privacy. All Mac App Store apps are sandboxed.\n", "Q: What color space is iPhone's 7 \"Wide color display (P3)\" Newest iPhone 7 claims to have \"Wide color display (P3)\". What exactly is this, a color space? Could this be Adobe RGB, or just a different space created by apple?\nHow does it compare to sRBG and Adobe RBG?\n\nA: Ok I've found it. It's DCI-P3 standard:\nhttp://appleinsider.com/articles/16/09/09/apples-wide-color-screen-on-the-iphone-7-will-lead-to-more-faithful-color-reproduction\nMost modern android smartphones are already able to display the circle inside the red square, but probably are converting Adobe RGB or DCI-P3 color space to sRBG instead of displaying correctly the original one.\nComparison sRGB vs Adobe RGB vs DCI-P3:\n\n\nA: Your answer is a good approximation, but there's one detail I'm mentioning here for completeness:\nApple devices use a color space called Display P3, which is very similar to DCI-P3, but uses a different gamma of 2.2 rather than the 2.6 that DCI-P3 uses. Software that processes photos or videos needs to account for this difference; otherwise colors will come out wrong.\nHowever, Display P3 has the same gamut as DCI-P3, so at a high level, you can think of them as the same thing.\n", "Q: Need old music transferred to new computer My computer crashed and actually caught on fire destroying everything that was in it. I purchased a new computer and a new ISP and email address. But, my new computer does not have my ITunes library in it, just 1 song. I have contacted Apple about this. They sent me a link to get me started but, it really doesn't help me because of the old email address is not the current new address. Because of the different ISP's. I am stuck. I have Windows 8.1.\n\nA: Your old Apple ID is probably still valid and I imaging the old password will still work.\nFor example, if I have an email address blahblahblah@something.com and create an Apple ID it's just using that email address as my username. It is not actually using your email account's password to authenticate. Does that make sense? I'd just try logging in with your old Apple ID (email address) and your last known password.\nIf all else fails then I hope you had a rescue email address setup for your Apple ID!\n", "Q: How to access WebDAV shared folder on Mac OS X Server Mac OS X Server supports WebDAV and allows iPhones/iPads to connect, store and retrieve files.\nWhile Mac OS X can access WebDAV servers from the Finder using \"Connect to Server\" (Command+K) attempting to connect to the root of a Mac OS X server or any other assumed location results in an error:\n\nThere was a problem connecting to the server “theserver.domain.com”.\n  Check the server name or IP address, and then try again. If you continue to have problems, contact your system administrator\n\nI can only guess that there is some special URL/URI that is necessary but what?\n\nA: Here is how it partially works.\nThe server's WebDAV interface is presented from a virtual directory \"webdav\". If your server is at \nhttps://theserver.domain.com \n\nthen the beginning of your WebDAV access starts at:\nhttps://theserver.domain.com/webdav/\n\nThis will typically be your \"home folder\" if the server is setup to offer users home folders.  \nAnd while it does not represent your actual directory structure , all other shared volumes are tacked on to the end of that. So if you mark a folder as shared with \"WebDAV\" thusly:\n\nthen the access would be:\nhttps://theserver.domain.com/webdav/swap/\n\nCaveats:\n\n\n*\n\n*URI is case sensitive\n\n*username aliases are not respected, you must use the \"short name\" for login, even from the Mac OS X Finder's friendly login dialog\n\n*Wiki storage access with WebDAV ... still not clear on the URI\n\n", "Q: 17\" MacBook Pro (early 2011) 16GB RAM, 1600 MHz? Crucial and OWC both say that the 17\" MacBook Pro (early 2011) supports 16 GB. But both only offer 1333 MHz when I select to buy.\nRightnow I've got a single 8GB 1600 MHz chip, have had it for years and it works fine.\nWould this model have issues with two 8GB 1600 MHz chips?\n\nA: Your MacBook Pro has two memory slots designed to take 204-pin PC-10600 (1333 MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM memory chips.\nApple's official position is that this model supports up to 8GB of memory, but real world tests have proven the machine to work fine with 16GB, so both Crucial and OWC are correct in what they say.\nIf both of them sell the 1333MHz chips, assuming they are 204-pin PC-10600 (1333 MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM memory chips, then these will work as they are the correct specs for your machine. Xaxxon's comment about the likely speed of what your 1600MHz chip is running at is correct. Paying for 1600MHz chips are just a waste of money.\nIf it was me I would go ahead and purchase two of them and install them into your computer to get the 16GB you want.\nYou could try just purchasing one and adding it to your machine, but you may be risking inconsistent/random performance issues having one 1600MHz chip and one 1333MHz chip installed simultaneously. \nOf course, it's up to you and you could just test this and see how you go. But, if it's cheaper to purchase the two at the same time as opposed to buying one and then another later, I'd just buy the two new 1333MHz chips. Having two identical chips is the safest option.\n", "Q: Could not unlock file inside Application contents For using RoboVM on OSX, I need to edit a file called info.plist, which resides inside the contents of the application called Android Studio.\nLast year I managed to edit the file for Android Studio 1.5 (right image), but I now installed Android Studio 2.13 and I didn't succeed (left image).\nIt seems that the contents of this application are read only. How do I edit this file? I only need to change one value.\n\n\nA: Assuming you're an admin you can add write permission to the group using the chmod command:\nsudo chmod g+w /path/to/info.plist\n\nUpdate:  Turns out they were launching the application directly from the disk image, which was likely mounted as read-only. Copying it to the local disk lets you make changes like this.\n", "Q: Mac Finder: Getting the path of a directory or file as as string In Windows it is possible to right-click on a file. Then select \"properties\". In \"properties\" the file-system path is shown. Can then be copied by marking and storing (into the clipboard).\nI couldn't figure out a way to do that in Mac. \nTherefore my question:\nCan I retrieve the file-system path of a directory or file via the GUI of the Mac Finder?\n\nA: Ctrl-click (or two finger click) on the file you want the path from, then press Opt and select \"Copy as path name\" (or what it's called in english) from the context menu.\nYou can also just select the file and then press Opt-Cmd-C to copy the pathname to the clipboard.\n\nA: I don't see a way to do it with just Finder. The best I could do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a Terminal window.\n\n*Drag the file you want into terminal.\n\n*Select the filename in the terminal window.\n\n*Copy the filename to the clipboard.\n\n\nSafari will also work. It's a file URL, so you will have to be careful with your selection.\n\nA: You can drag the file or folder from Finder application to the dialog box. The full path of the file or folder will appear in the dialog box. Additionally, you can drag a file or folder into the Terminal application or many other apps, to expand the path. \nAlso, if you enable showing the Path Bar in the Finder application, then you can drag any part of the full path to a dialog box. The Path Bar can be enabled by selecting View➔Show Path Bar from the menu bar or by using the option+⌘+P key combination.\n\nA: I'm using macOS Mojave. It's easy to find what you want, just go to folder and click on gear icon on top of window, there you can see option called \"Copy 'folderName' as Pathname\"\nThat is it!\n\nA: I love the control / option copy as path trick, but can never seem to remember it, so I end up using Finder services menu to let you extend this function. By design, Apple only shows a path for network share files in the get info pane so you'll need to attach a service to Finder to get this in general (for reasons, I'm sure I'd love to hear over a drink). \nThat being said, I use Path Snagger 2 and am super happy with it as I can control POSIX/SMB/HFS and file://whatever format for the path that gets copied. You can process several files at once, control all sorts of tweaks to how the path is constructed. I also don't have to do multiple clicks and I copy off paths all the time so it's worth the expense to me.\nI could see making an AppleScript or swift script to do this for free as well if you had a well defined string you wanted to get from the location of a specific file that would be general to all files once you coded it. This would only be good if you didn't know to connect it to services for quicker execution than the built in way or needed a different format for the path. \n", "Q: Video file does not appear under Windows Explorer I have a Windows 10 pc and attached an iPhone 6S to it. All files appear in Windows Explorer except one. It is a 4K Video going over 13 minutes. Is it too big? Is the file system the problem?\n\nA: You have to install iTunes to get a better driver.

The default Win 10 driver can't do this ...\n", "Q: Is there a Calendar program out there with features that can make the \"days\" be linked from 5am to 5am (one day), rather than from 12am to 12am? What if you're a person that sleeps and wakes at funky hours and wants to schedule things from 11pm-1am, for example.  In such a case, the event would be split up into two different days.  But for this weirdo, that's actually the middle of their day.  I'd like to be able to view my \"day\" in one go, rather than having to flip back and forth between the end of one day and the beginning of another.  Are there any calendars that allow for this kind of flexibility?\n\nA: If you change the start of a \"day\" to be 05:00, then it wouldn't really be a day anymore.   You're best bet may be to change your timezone to be 5 hours off.\n", "Q: How do I get Terminal.app pasting behavior in iTerm 2? I often paste stuff into my terminal from websites, sometimes with newlines in wrong places, sometimes with newlines where you would expect them. However, iTerm seems to ignore any paste that contains newlines. This often leaves me confused as to wether I copied the contents of the text I wanted to paste correctly, and when I've found out that I copied them the way I wanted to, I have to reformat those lines in some text editor which all unnecessarily breaks flow. Above that, iTerm also has this weird feature that always pastes slowly instead of just putting the clipboard contents there. I know these things might have been implemented for safety reasons, but I can tell you now that I am going to execute every command I want to execute, wether they have newlines in them or not. \nI've fixed this last annoyance kinda by altering some sort of delays or something in the preferences, but I would kinda rather get rid of these features and let iTerm behave as Apple's terminal app, or any OS X application for that matter. Anyone know how to tackle this problem?\n\nA: You hit a bug. Upgrade to 3.0.9 to fix it.\n", "Q: My son added an app on my laptop. How can I update it? My son added Pages back when he was living at home and using my laptop. He now has his own and I still use Pages. I would like to update it as it has been a few years without updates now. I am even happy to pay for it again since he is probably using it on his laptop too from his cloud. But I don't want to lose my current documents. What do I do? I cannot update using my Apple ID and it will not let me purchase it since it is already on the computer.\nDoes this question even make sense?\n\nA: You'll not lose any of your documents if you delete the Pages Application from your Mac and, then, buy it again using your own AppleID. This is because documents are stored on as individual files on your computer not within the Pages application.\nIf you want to update the current installation, you have to use the AppleID that your son used to install it.\n", "Q: iTunes keyboard shortcut service only works when in focus I have created an Applescript that will favorite the current track.

If I press the shortcut when iTunes is not the window in focus, I don't even see the Services gear appear in the system tray, indicating that the script is not running. \nHow do I make the script run regardless of what window has focus?\n\nA: It was a set up as a service that takes no input and runs in any application.\nBut that wasn't the problem. Indeed, @Tetsujin seems to be correct. It was a conflict with a keyboard shortcut in the application that had keyboard focus. I used a different shortcut and it works.\n", "Q: iOS: block ads in Apps without Jailbreak and VPN tunnel (normal 3G/4G network) For example in RT app there are annoying ads. There is no way to pay subscription without ads.\nHowto block ads in Apps (in Mobile Safari I block them all)? I found only apps that offer a VPN tunnel (you need 100% to trust them) and solutions for iPhones with Jailbreak.

I updated to macOS Sierra (16A319) and was checking my storage where I saw this extra division greyed out saying Purgeable.\n\nWhat is the significance/meaning of Purgeable?\n\nA: There's a post here:\nLink\nthat makes the case that this also includes local time machine data, which makes sense given the size I see tagged as \"purgeable\".\n\nA: Run this: (from Terminal)\ndiskutil secureErase freespace 0 /dev/disk1s1\n\nThe /dev/disk1s1 is replaced with the volume that you wish to get your space back from.   Run:\ndf -h /\nFilesystem      Size   Used  Avail Capacity iused       ifree %iused  Mounted on\n/dev/disk1s1   466Gi  370Gi   64Gi    86%    xxxxx   xxxxxxxxx    0%        /\n\nAnd look at the first filesystem part.\nIn my case, I had 64GB 'purgeable', after running this command I had 2.8GB.\nI wasn't able to install XCode before because I was 'out of space' - I lothe this 'feature' of OS-X because the OS reports the space as not free, even though you can create a file and remove it (what this command does).\nStill can't get back the last 2.6 GB    (Not to be confused with the GiBytes reported by df -h  so don't worry that the numbers don't match)\n\nA: Purgeable is a distinct concept from the \"Store infrequently used files on iCloud\" functionality.  From Mac Help (available from the Help menu, search for \"purgeable\"):\n\n“purgeable space” — or space that macOS can free up when needed by  removing files from your computer. You can’t manually remove the files  that are designated purgeable, but macOS removes them as space is  required.\n\n...\n\n\"Purgeable: Contains locally stored files and documents that can be removed when space is needed, and then downloaded or generated again when the files are needed again by you or your Mac.\"\n\nEffectively the OS has various caches, temp files, copies of things it downloaded, etc. that are being keeping around out of view of normal users, but they can be deleted if space is needed.\nIf you turn on the optimized storage feature, which removes local copies of infrequently used files and stores them in iCloud, then these infrequently used files may or may not be counted with along with the system purgeable files.  But even without turning on that feature, there are other purgeable files present.\n\nA: Don't forget your Trash Bin! I first saw \"Purgeable\" when I threw about 20gb of files in the trash (which was the same as the purgeable amount).\nYou can also view \"Purgeable\" from the Disk Utility menu, FYI\n\nA: These are files that the system, or you, hasn't accessed in a long time and so are stored in iCloud. If you're running low on disk space, macOS can safely delete them, keeping a 'shortcut', on your system.\nWhen you need the file again, the system will download it for you in he background. This site has a good overview of the feature if you want to read more.\n\nAs your Mac begins to run out of space, your oldest files are quietly and automatically stored online, leaving Download icons in their places on your Mac, so that you can retrieve them if you need them. (A new graph in the Disk Utility program shows how much space you stand to retrieve this way, marked Purgeable.)\n\n", "Q: nginx.vim syntax highlighting Attempting to use a VIM syntax highlighting plugin for editing nginx config files on El Capitan.

But now, after an update or something, it saves every video and picture to my camera roll. I don't want them on my camera roll because it takes up space and if I delete them from my camera roll it won't let my play the project on IMovie because it says \"Items are missing.\" What can I do? Please help. Also, this is on my IPhone 5s.\nSee my new comment down below..\n\nA: In a sense the basis of your question is in error. \nWhile iMovie is saving videos to your camera roll, this isn't using any extra space on your iPhone. That's why you get the error you're getting after deleting the files - because that's where iMovie is trying to access the video from.\nBasically, what happens is the video is saved to your camera roll, but project specific info is saved within iMovie. Once you have totally finished a project, you can export/share/save the final version and after that you can delete the video you took from your camera roll (if you want).\nIf you like, you can actually prove this to yourself by doing a simple test:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > General > Storage & iCloud usage\n\n*In the Storage section, tap on Manage Storage \n\n*Wait for the list of apps to appear (this may take a while if you have lots of apps). \n\n*Tap on iMovie (likely to be in your top 10)\n\n*Take a note of how much space is used up by Documents & Data \n\n*Now go to your actual iMovie app and take a 30s video\n\n*Go to your Camera roll and try to email this video to yourself \n\n*You should get a warning saying that this attachment may be too large to email. This message will give you the size of the video. Take a note of this.\n\n*Cancel the attempt to email the video.\n\n*Repeat the first 5 steps.\n\n*You should note that while your iMovie Documents & Data have grown a little, it will not have grown by anywhere near the size of the actual video itself. The reason this has grown is because it's storing project info, not because it's storing the video again.\n\n\nHopefully this little test will put your mind at ease.\nDon't forget to delete your test video.\n", "Q: IPhone Cv Attachments Sometime I get email from recruiters asking for my cv in word format.

Apple has removed PPTP VPN support in Sierra due to security concerns. See: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206844\nUnfortunately, I need to connect to an organisation that only supports PPTP (not my decision).\nI know about Shimo, but it's $50 and has a lot of features I don't need.\nI was hoping to find a free or open source solution? A command-line-only option would be fine for macOS.\nI'm even open to more esoteric solutions (e.g. a lightweight linux VM that connects to the VPN, and then shares the connection with host OS, but not sure how feasible this would be or how to do it).\nEdit: I see the command-line tool pppd is still present in macOS Sierra, so perhaps it's possible to call this directly?\nEdit 2: I tried following this tutorial with an options file from the ArchWiki, and a custom route in /etc/ppp/ip-up, but it gives an error (publish_entry SCDSet() failed: Success!) when I try to run the pppd command, the pppd daemon doesn't seem to be running, and the ppp0 interface isn't showing up in ifconfig. I don't know much about networks and network interfaces, so I'm finding this very confusing! Any help would be much appreciated.\n\nA: The FlowVPN client is free (and works with any provider).\nIt supports PPTP and OpenVPN on macOS Sierra and High Sierra:\nhttps://www.flowvpn.com/download-mac/\nJust overwrite the FlowVPN server address with any server and it connects.\n\nA: Just paid $55 for Shimo 4. It works. A google search for Shimo 4 VPN will guide your to the correct link. It supports PPTP, L2TP, OpenVPN, SSH, and a few more. I even found I can connect to some L2TP server with Shimo while I cannot connect with the built-in OS X VPN client. The price is a bit expensive, but it works pretty well for me, so I paid for it. I guess they might have some sales boost as the new OS X rolled out.\n\nA: I found this when searching for how to fix a error I was getting in Shimo when trying to connect to PPTP VPN.  I didn't get many helpful search results so even though this doesn't answer the original question, others might land here looking for help for this error:\n\nLCP: timeout sending Config-Requests\n\nI'm running a trial of Shimo on OS X 10.12 (Sierra) and the VPN server is on Windows 2012 R2.\nI also posted this answer on another question because it helped me work out the solution. A recommendation posted by @wgui was to use the 'silent' option which didn't work but the description given for 'silent' lead me to figuring it out.\nThe fix for me was to use the 'passive' option.  In Shimo, it can be enabled in the 'Expert' section. You should see it as one of the choices given when you add a parameter key (just leave the value blank). Once it was set my connection worked fine.\n\nA: VPN Tracker also supports PPTP it's not free but presumed to be the most professional VPN Software for the Mac. PPTP connections are automatically imported into VPN Tracker if launched on El Capitan prior to the upgrade and if the connection fails, there is a professional support team. Yes it's a paid product.\n", "Q: Should I make a backup of OSX before bootcamping Windows 10 I have the Mid 2012 Macbook Pro. I want to know if I should make a backup of osx, before dualbooting windows 10. I already have all my files backed up to the cloud, but not osx. Do I need to do so? Also, how is the performance of windows 10 on a mac? Am I able to un-dualboot windows 10 from my mac, if i dont like it?\n\nA: I would strongly recommend making a backup before setting up Boot Camp. Setting up Boot Camp involves repartitioning the disk into an OS X partition and a partition for Windows, but OS X doesn't know how to format the Windows partition into NTFS. So, it formats the Windows-to-be partition in the FAT32 format, and expects you to use the Windows installer for reformat it into NTFS. If you don't do this quite right, the Windows installer may reformat the OS X partition as well, causing complete data loss.\nThus, it's much safer if you have a full backup. Just in case.\n\nA: Usually you would want to make a backup of OS X (macOS) before dual-booting Windows 10 just in case something messed up the hard drive you can go back to it. Regular Time Machine backup is good enough. Unless you want to take some risk, you can do it without a backup. I didn't do any backup before installing Windows 10 and it worked just fine, I don't need to restore or anything.\nHow Windows 10 performs depends on how good your CPU is and how much RAM you have. Usually when I am using just some apps, like Edge, MS Word, etc., they only consumes around 2GB of memory. Windows 10 is pretty well optimized so the performance shouldn't be very bad on MacBooks. If you want to remove Windows 10, you can go back into Bootcamp Assistant on your Mac. If Windows 10 is installed Bootcamp Assistant will have an option to remove Windows 10 for you.\nMore information on removing Bootcamp can be found here.\n\nA: You should always have an up-to-date system backup, not just when you do something potentially destructive. So yes, activate Time Machine and make backups regularly.\n\nA: As others stated, there is no excuse for not having at hand an effective backup. This is even more true before a serious reorganisation. Before any serious reorganisation, like here installing Boot Camp, I would suggest having a bootable clone is even better than simply having a complete Time Machine Backup. Should anything go wrong with your reorganisation, you can instantly restart from your clone and be immediately in business and able to restore if you wish by a simple co-lone-back from your booted clone. You don't have that luxury with a Time Machine backup (which is a non-bootable image). \n", "Q: Do iOS apps run in the background? Let's say if I install a dozen games and utilities on the iPhone, and then also installed chat apps like WhatsApp, WeChat, Line, then\n\n\n*\n\n*When the iPhone restarts, can all these apps start up as well and take up valuable processor time and system resources?\n\n*What if I start an app, and then explicitly double tap on the Home button, and then slide the app out (to exit it). Can it or part of it still run in the background now or later?\n\n*Since WhatsApp, WeChat, Line, and Facebook Messages all notify me of new messages, it looks like they will be running as soon as I restart my iPhone. Are they using my CPU in the background? Also, it seems that even if I turn off App Refresh in Settings, the apps can possibly still run in the background. Is that true?\nOne big concern is, if I do install all Angry Birds variations, a few casino roulette games, and all Cut the Rope versions and don't bother to delete them (the phone has 128GB storage). Then, will all these apps possibly run at iPhone restart time or just randomly and take up processor time and system resources (such as RAM)?\n\nA: Apple has very strict guidelines for how—and when—apps can run in the background.\nThe following are the only scenarios in which a third-party iOS app can use CPU in the background.\nBackground Fetch\nAny app can use \"Background Fetch\" (aka Background app refresh) to fetch content in the background for a few seconds, about once a day (on a timeframe regulated by iOS, out of the developer's control). Background Fetch takes up very little battery and CPU, and is mainly used by news/weather/social media/mail apps to update your feed so that when you open the app it won't be completely out of date.\nAudio, Voice over IP, Bluetooth Communications\nIf an app plays audio in the background (over AirPlay or through the phone's speakers), iOS permits it to run in the background until it ceases to play the music; if an app allows you to make data-based phone calls (like Whatsapp or Skype calls) in the background, it can stay active, using CPU for the duration of the call; and if an app communicates to Bluetooth Accessories (like the Pebble app communicating with the Pebble Smartwatch), it can stay awake permanently in the background.\nNewsstand downloads, remote notifications\nNewsstand apps (as long as they are approved by Apple to be a  major news organization and show up in the Newsstand part of the App Store) are permitted to download new content in the background; any app (like The New York Times app) that needs to display notifications generated outside the app (for example, breaking news notifications), can stay awake in the background to recieve such \"remote\" notifications.\nLocation Updates\nIf you allow an app to \"always\" use your location (i.e. in the background), then it can be active at any time in the background. Apps like Facebook, Find Friends, and others use this to update location-related information, though other apps can use it to surreptitiously use it to do tasks in the background (but only if you specifically allow them to access your location).\n\nA very common misconception is that \"swiping up\" on an app to kill it stops it from operating in the background: this is wholly untrue. Apps that have one of the above seven reasons to operate in the background can operate in the background regardless of you \"swiping up\" on them, and apps that don't have one of these seven reasons can't operate when they're not on the screen even if you don't kill them.\nAnother misconception (that you seem to have!) is that switching off \"Background App Refresh\" will stop an app from operating in the background; in fact, that only disables an app from using Background Fetch, but it can operate in the background if it has one of the other six reasons too regardless of the Background App Refresh toggle.\n\nSo are the apps you have installed using CPU, memory, battery, or data in the background? You can easily find out! Go to Settings on your iPhone, find the Battery section, and take a peek. If an app shows \"Background Activity\" under its name, then it's been using CPU in the background; otherwise, it has not been doing anything in the background.\nHere's an example screenshot:\n\nOn this iPhone, Podcasts has been operating in the background but none of the other apps have. Going into Battery Settings is a simple way to tell if Angry Birds has been running in the background.\n\nSo, to answer your questions directly:\n\nWhen the iPhone restarts, can all these apps start up as well and take up valuable processor time and system resources?\n\nOnly if they are specifically configured to run in the background, you can check if they've been doing that in your iPhone's Battery settings.\n\nWhat if I start an app, and then explicitly double tap on the Home button, and then slide the app out (to exit it). Can it or part of it still run in the background now or later?\n\nYes. For example, if Facebook uses location services (as it does), then swiping up to kill the Facebook app will not stop it from using your location in the background, and while it's using your location, it can perform just about any other task in the background too.\n\nSince WhatsApp, WeChat, Line, and Facebook Messages all notify me of new messages, it looks like they will be running as soon as I restart my iPhone. Are the using my CPU in the background? Also, it seems that even if I turn off App Refresh in Settings, the apps can possibly still run in the background. Is that true?\n\nWhatsapp, WeChat, Line, Hangouts, FB Messenger, and other chat apps use the remote notifications capability to check for new messages in the background every once in a while. This is expected behavior (and you can check how much they're doing it by checking their app-by-app battery usage, again in Battery settings), and shouldn't drain your battery too much. And indeed, turning off App Refresh for those apps will not have any effect, as the apps use remote notifications and not background fetch to operate in the background.\n\nTL;DR: Apps can use your phone's resources in the background, you can see how much they're doing in Settings -> Battery.\n\nSources of information:\n\n*\n\n*I am an iOS and Mac Developer with 2 apps on the App Store\n\n*Article: Swiping up on apps doesn't affect whether they're running in the background\n\n*Post: What turning off Background App Refresh really does\n\n*Image: Background modes in Xcode\n\n*Stack Overflow Answer: Strict rules on running iOS apps in the background\n\n*Stack Overflow Answer: How WhatsApp and Skype run in the background on iOS\n", "Q: Cannot Update Apps on MacOS App Store When I try to update an app, and I go to the 'Updates' page, I Get this error in a dialogue box:\nCould not load data from the Apple software update server.\nI checked my Internet connection, everything is fine.\n\n\nA: Please backup all your data.

I often work on my Mac while on the go, and then I play music using iTunes over my EarPods connected via the mini-Jack plug.\nThe button allows me to pause the music, but now in Sierra, every time I press it, I am asked whether I want to allow Siri.  Refusing will simply bring the window up again when I press the button.\nI don't want to use Siri on Sierra.  At all.  How can I prevent it from trying to activate when I press play/pause on my EarPods?\nAdded after reading comments: When I enable Siri, Siri doesn't activate when I press the button, unless I press it really long.  But when I disable Siri entirely, it asks whether it's allowed to activate every time I press the button, even if it's just a short click.\n\nA: It may be related to the fact that although you \"disable\" Siri, the process is still running. You can easily see that in the Activity Monitor, by searching for Siri.\nIf you try to kill it, it will be restarted by launchd. To stop the automatic restart, disable it by editing /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Siri.plist and setting Disabled to false.\nTo do that, you first need to disable SIP (system integrity protection), edit /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Siri.plist, then enable SIP.\n\nA: Sounds like a bug in Sierra. Submit a report. For now, enable Siri and just don't use it until it is patched.\n\nA: On Sierra, you could only fix this by configuring the AirPods when paired with an iOS device.\nOn High Sierra, however, in the Bluetooth preference pane, once they're connected, an \"options\" button will appear:\n\nWhen clicked, this gives you an options list, which can independently configure the double-tap action for each ear:\n\n\nA: You can disable it entirely in System Prefs > Siri\n\nPic from MacWorld : How to make Siri activate when you say ‘Hey Siri’ to your Mac with macOS Sierra which I imagine would be only of peripheral interest if you wish to disable it completely.\n", "Q: How to remove photos without masters from library in OS X Photos app?

It just says Update Requested and nothing happens.\nSome of my friends have the same issue and some not.\nWhat's the reason and how to resolve this?\n\nA: Here's some basic steps to try to get the update downloading again (via iGleeksBlog).  You didn't mention what you've already tried so I'm assuming you didn't try any of these yet:\n\n1. Network Reset\nOne of the first things you should make sure of is a stable network.\nIf you’re on cellular or spotty Wi-Fi, there can be problems when your\niPhone tries to contact Apple’s servers to download the update.\nOnce you are stuck at “Update Requested…”, it’s best to turn off the\nnetworks on your iPhone and reconnect it. If you are on a 3G or LTE\ndata network, try to switch to a stable Wi-Fi service before updating.\n2. Hard Reset\nIf network is not the issue, you can try doing a hard-reset to get the\nupdate working again. To hard-reset your iPhone/iPad:\nPress and hold the Power and Home button till the screen goes black\nNow, press the Power button to boot the iPhone/iPad After you\nhard-reset, check the Software Update page again. Either the “Update\nrequested” changes to downloading or you get to start all over again\nto download and install the update.\n3. iTunes\nIf you see the “Update requested” for hours after you’ve initiated the\nupdate, and all the above methods haven’t fixed it, there’s probably\nonly one way of getting the update done – via iTunes. Surely, this\nbeats the very purpose of an OTA (simplicity) but given that the\niPhone is stuck in the update, you might want to switch to the old\nmethod.\nConnect your iPhone to the PC/Mac, fire up iTunes and from the Summary\ntab, click on Update. In most cases, iTunes will automatically show a\npop-up that says there’s an update for your iPhone/iPad.\n\n", "Q: What will happen if I copy more pictures to my iCloud account than my iPhone has in spare space? I have lots of pictures and videos stored on a NAS (that isn't backed up).

Will it just max out, or is there anyway for it to ignore those? Otherwise what's the point of being able to purchase more iCloud storage than your iPhone has?\n\nA: In the Photos Settings in the Settings app on your iPhone, you can select optimize storage.\nThen will it only save often viewed pictures in full quality, and rarely viewed as a thumbnail, if you're looking at a picture on your iPhone it'll automatically start to download the picture in best quality.\n", "Q: I can no longer boot into macOS after resizing my bootcamp partition The Problem: My macOS partition doesn't appear as an option at boot\nBackground: I had a main el capitan partition and a bootcamp partition.

The third partition should have a GUID (Type) of 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC and an attribute (Attib) value of 0002000000000000.

The computer should now use the new\npartition table.\nThe operation has completed successfully.\n\nThe Mac firmware and El Capitan OS X operation system both rely on the GUID values in the GUID Partition Table (GPT) to aid in determining the format of a volume stored in a partition. Since the GPT contains the wrong GUID value for both partitions 2 and 3, you can not boot your Mac from either of these partitions.\nThe Windows 10 operating system is a little less restrictive. Windows 10 will look at the contents of a partition and try to determine format of the volume. Windows may do this even if the partition has the wrong GUID value in the GPT. This is why windows detects the HFS formatted \"Macintosh HD\" and \"Recovery HD\" volumes while the firmware used to boot the Mac does not.\nThe GUID of DE94BBA4-06D1-4D40-A16A-BFD50179D6AC represents a Windows Recovery Environment partition. Evidently, you do not have such a partition. When I install Windows 10 on my 2013 iMac, a partition of this  type was created. It is about 450 MB in size and followed after the \nWindows 10 partition. Other users have posted their installation of Windows 10 did not create this partition. So if you had this partition, it is possible EaseUS erased it. Anyway, you do not need a Windows Recovery Environment partition for normal use of Windows 10.\n\nA: For anyone having this problem with an AFPS partition.\nThe previeous answer works as well.\nWhen asked for the Hex code for your partition\nHex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = 700): \n\nJust press L and Enter until you see the code for the APFS partition.\nYou don't have to change any attribute values since the recovery partition is inside the APFS container/thing. So you only have to modify the GUID for one partition, your OSX partition.\nThen after writing the changes and restarting the OSX partition should be there for boot.\n", "Q: Icons in Safari's pinned tabs Pinned tabs are very useful feature in Safari and I'm using it all the time.\nBut, I'm having some experience problem with it.\nWhen I pin several tabs from the same domain but different subdomains, I'm getting the first letter as the icon of this pinned tab to be exactly the same. Then it takes me a while to find the tab I was looking for by switching through them one by one.\n\nIs it possible to manually change the icon for these tabs or at least make it to use the first letter of the subdomain instead of the domain name, so it will be much faster accessible?\n\nA: There is another workaround: Add the webpage of your pinned tab to your bookmarks. The pinned tab will then show the first letter of your bookmark title. So this way you can at least make sure that all your pinned tabs have different letters, which might already be sufficient :D\n\nA: The Icons you see are coming from the web server. If Safari does not find a favicon then it makes one up using, you guessed it, the first letter of the domain.\nOn the very off chance that you have access to the web server you can upload a unique favicon  to each subdomain. Otherwise the answer that Tetsujin has provided (using submenus in the favorites bar) may be the closest you are going to come.\n\nA: Not a fix, but a workaround...\nIt sounds like you really need sub-menus rather than pins.\nPinning a couple of dozen pages really doesn't feel very efficient, vs using the Favourites bar - toggled on/off from the View menu or  Shift ⇧   Cmd ⌘   B  \n\nWith either single-click, or drop-menus -\nThe first item [to the left of Stack Exchange, blurred] with a small square rather than down arrow will open an entire set of bookmarks at one click.  \nThe others each have drop menus, including sub-folders, each for a specific set of pages across several subjects. They can also all be opened at a single stroke if you right click.\n\nI think once you've got more pins than you can easily differentiate, this might be a better idea.\n", "Q: Messages.app AppleScript handler Override 10 second script timeout I have a working Messages.app Applescript handler.  Most of the handlers are empty, except the \"on message received\" handler.  This handler runs a shell script which responds with outputs that are expected to be sent as responses to the message sender.\nThe issue: My Script takes between 6 and 12 seconds.  In the cases it takes over 10 seconds, Messages appears to have a default Applescript handler timeout of 10 seconds.  After 10 seconds a popup is delivered and Messages becomes unusable until the \"Wait\" button is pressed.  Upon pressing the button, the handler finishes, and all is well.\n\nPossible Solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ideal: Disable/Change the Applescript messages timeout.\n\n*Make handler script pass enough information to respond to the same message into the script running under nohup or $ [script] & then have the script launch it's own Applescript to respond.\n\n*make Applescript try to click \"Wait\" button in messages before responding (not sure if this would work).\n\n\nThank you for any help!\n\nA: Unfortunately Apple hasn't made this easy on us. They have provided no way to change this timeout and sometimes it's the script itself taking too long to run (because Messages.app is terrible at running scripts). I run a rather extensive applescript handler myself, and I interact with Messages.app through AppleScripts run by other processes. Sometimes things freak out and I'm not around to fix it. The workaround I've come up with is to check for a window with the \"Wait\" button and to click it. Sometimes though, my scripts run right after another and I end up with possibly dozens of windows like the screenshot you pasted. In my case, it is easier to force Messages to quit and then re-open it. I wrote a small AppleScript that does exactly this. You can compile it as an application with \"stay open after run handler\" selected and it will always make sure Messages is working and open without error windows. You can find it here: https://github.com/davidnewhall/IndigoAppleScripts/blob/master/Restart_Messages.applescript\nThe other option you could (easily) develop is to run your script in the background and respond once the data is available; that's probably a better approach. You can run osascript from the command line (or a script) to run an AppleScript. There are plenty of examples in my github repo of how to send messages externally.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Back up Mac using CarbonCopyCloner with command line only? Background:\nI never expected to have only command line access to my Mac, but the day has arrived!  :)  Due to a video card problem, any attempt to boot the normal OS or recovery partition results in a kernel panic.  However, I can boot into Single User mode!

I have GarageBand taking 2.46 GB space on my system even after I deleted the app. Couldn't find any other files when searched via spotlight. \n\nIs there any way to find these files and remove them?\n\nA: The \"Storage Management.app\" now allows you to remove the instruments.\n\nMore information on Storage Management is in \"A modern and faster alternative to Disk Inventory X\" (macOS 10.13.5 shown)\n\nA: On a fresh install of Sierra 10.12.2, the GarageBand files are:\n/Applications/GarageBand\n\n/Library/Application Support/GarageBand\n\n/Library/Audio/Apple Loops/Apple/Apple Loops for GarageBand\n\n/Library/Receipts/com.apple.pkg.GarageBand_AppStore.bom\n\n/Library/Receipts/com.apple.pkg.GarageBand_AppStore.plist\n\n/System/Library/Receipts/com.apple.pkg.MAContent10_AssetPack_0325_AppleLoopsGarageBand1.bom\n\n/System/Library/Receipts/com.apple.pkg.MAContent10_AssetPack_0325_AppleLoopsGarageBand1.plist\n\n~/Library/Application Scripts/com.apple.STMExtension.GarageBand\n\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.STMExtension.GarageBand\n\nDelete those and you should be GarageBand free.\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*You might want consider also removing /Library/Audio/Apple Loops/Apple and /Library/Application Support/Logic (those loops aren't GarageBand-specific — Logic Pro uses them, for example).\n\n*If you're comfortable with the command line, you can delete this list programmatically. I recommend using the tool trash. First copy the above list and save it in a new file. Then run\nxargs trash <pathtothefile\n\nFor example if you save the list on your Desktop as garageband-files-to-delete.txt, you'd run\nxargs trash <~/desktop/garageband-files-to-delete.txt\n\n(this may require sudo. you could also use rm -rf instead of trash, but that's dangerous).\n\nA: I used CleanApp to remove applications from macOS. You can try it or any similar uninstaller, but you need the application installed to remove it.\nAlso check \"Delete GarageBand to Save Precious Gigabytes of Mac Storage\".\n\nA: You can use locate command to locate all files used by GarageBand, e.g.:\nlocate GarageBand\n\nNote: To rebuild db for the first time, run: sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb.\nThe main locations are:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Applications/GarageBand (app it-self)\n\n*/Library/Application Support/GarageBand\n\n*/Library/Audio/Apple Loops/Apple (GarageBand subfolder)\n\n\nAlso check for any user's data files at the following locations:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Application Support/GarageBand\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/GarageBand\n\n*~/Library/Caches/GarageBand\nSee: Uninstall Mac Applications.\n\nA: I have been using \"AppDelete\" to completely delete other applications from macOS. It is very small and does one thing and does it well: it finds all of the files associated with an application and asks if you want to delete them. It even does a dry run to show which files will be deleted, to let us pick the files. \nAppDelete is fully-functional to try before you buy it. The developer keeps it up-to-date and it runs on macOS 10.12 Sierra.\n\nA: Download and unzip the free AppCleaner app. Set its preferences to allow it to remove protected apps. Drop the GarageBand icon into the app. Let it find all the GarageBand files and folders. Delete. Done.\n", "Q: Wacom Bamboo Create Driver for MacOS 10.12 I have a late 2015 Retina iMac running MacOS 10.12, and have connected a Wacom Bamboo Create tablet via the USB cable. It works, sort of, moving the cursor around the screen when using the finger. However, none of the other features work, including using the Bamboo stylus. \nWhen I try to install the drivers from the Wacom support site dated January 2015, the installation fails.  When I open system preferences, the Wacom icon is there, but when I click it is says that:\n\nThere is a problem with your tablet driver. Please reboot your system.\n  If the problem persists reinstall or update the driver.\n\nI rebooted the system, reinstalled the Wacom driver, and got the same result.\nDoes anyone know how to get this driver working? The Bamboo tablet is perfectly good and I really want to use it. again.\n\nA: On 10/12/2016, Wacom posted Driver 5.3.7-6, which is certified for macOS 10.9x - 10.12x. I installed the driver and it works as expected.\nUpdated Wacom driver. \nUPDATE -> macOS 10.13 High Sierra\n(9/17/2017)\nThe current drivers work after upgrading to macOS 10.13 (High Sierra), but the installer removed the Prefs Pane (System Preferences) module. This means that you can continue to use the Bamboo after upgrading, but you will not be able to make any changes to the settings. I have put in a trouble ticket with Wacom on this, and will post any updates here as I receive new information.\nI will also do some more research to see if there is a way to get around the prefs pane issue.\nSECOND UPDATE -> macOS 10.13 High Sierra\n(10/22/1017)\nWacom has posted updated drivers that support macOS 10.13 High Sierra:\nhttp://www.wacom.com/en-us/support/product-support/drivers\nBut they do not support the older devices, which include the Bamboo Create.\n\nA: The existing drivers support up to 10.11x, so my bet/wishful thinking is that Wacom will release 10.12 drivers when 10.12 is out of beta (Sep 20th).\nStill, I've got an Intuos working half-decently in the Sierra beta, so... maybe try trashing some wacom-specific preferences files?\n\nA: This worked for me: On the Wacom driver download page, most of the hardware-specific drivers were written over a year ago. There are only two or three drivers for any Wacom equipment that claim to work with MacOS 10.12. With that in mind, I cleaned out all traces of previous attempts to install, then tried installing the most recent Bamboo driver, not knowing whether it should be Bamboo or Intuos, since Bamboo has been promoted to Intuos...but the installs failed. Then I tried the installer for \"Business Solutions interactive displays\", obviously not meant for my Bamboo tablet. But it works. Better, in fact, than the Bamboo driver.\n", "Q: Blocking Ads in Safari on iPhone 5 I have an iPhone 5 with iOS 10, which does not support Safari Content Blockers (like Purify, Peace, or 1Blocker) because of its 32-bit chip. Is there a way to block ads in the native Safari browser without using Content Blockers?\nOne potential strategy I thought up is using iPhone's Web Restrictions features (accessible via General -> Restrictions -> Websites) to block content from certain sites (i.e. Taboola ads) from loading. I've tried doing this by adding taboola.com to the Never Allow list, but I have had no luck.\nIs there a way to block ads in Safari on the iPhone 5?\n\nA: There is no way to block ads using Web Restrictions, so far as I know.\nYou do have two options for blocking ads, though, which I will explain below.\nNote: if you do have an iPhone 5S or newer, you should stop reading and just use Content Blockers, which are by far the most desirable option. However, if you do still sport an iPhone with a 32-bit chip (iPhone 5 or earlier), here are two ways to block ads:\nUsing a VPN\nYou can use an app like Opera's new free VPN to block ads and trackers in any app, including Safari. Basically, once you set up their VPN (which is actually free and has no restrictions), all of your internet traffic will be routed through one of their servers, where they remove ad-related content and send the rest to your phone. \nAdvantages of Opera's VPN: \n\n\n*\n\n*Ads are blocked in all apps, including Safari.\n\n*No cost\n\n*Also anonymizes your IP address and secures you on insecure Wifi networks.\n\n\nDisadvantages of Opera's VPN:\n\n\n*\n\n*Internet speeds may be slowed considerably (in my experience from 75mbps to 9mbps at its slowest)\n\n*Opera can spy on everything your doing, but they're a fairly trustworthy company and probably aren't doing that.\n\n\nUsing a different browser\nYour other choice for blocking ads in web browsing is downloading a separate browser app that has ad-blocking built-in. This is the one I would choose, simply because of all the disadvantages of using a VPN. I have used Brave Browser a lot: it's a simple browser that replaces Safari but works just as well (it remembers passwords for you, blocks ads, increases security with HTTPS Everywhere, and works with password managers like 1Password). It's entirely open-source, and made by the engineer who co-founded Mozilla.\nAdvantages of Brave Browser:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ads are blocked\n\n*No cost\n\n*Uses HTTPS Everywhere to increase your security\n\n*Can't spy on all your other internet traffic\n\n*Works great as a day-to-day browser\n\n*Doesn't slow your internet speed like a VPN does\n\n\nDisadvantages of Brave Browser:\n\n\n*\n\n*Doesn't block ads in your other apps\n\n*Doesn't make Safari ad-free\n\n\nI hope this guide has helped you, if you have any questions please leave a comment below and I'll comment back.\n\nA: Weblock allows you to block ads by using a Wi-Fi proxy, and this is something I've used personally. Unfortunately, it doesn't work on a data connection, and that's where Adblock comes in handy: Adblock will apparently work on a data connection as well.\n", "Q: Can I track my workout and listen to music with Apple Watch Series 2 without having to carry my iPhone? I do not have any experience with the Apple Watch, currently I am just using an iPhone. Before I buy an Apple Watch I would like to verify my question.\nI know I need to pair it with an iPhone. But from what I have gathered, the new Apple Watch Series 2 is much more independent then the previous version.\n\n\n*\n\n*Tracking should be possible with the GPS module.\n\n*Pairing a bluetooth headphone is possible.\n\n*Playing music without iPhone is also possible.\n\n\nAm I right? Or are there any limitations I have missed?\n\nA: You are correct on all three counts.\nThe Workout app will work without your iPhone, at least. Third-party apps might need to be updated to be completely independent. Strava, for instance, won't start without an active iPhone connection, but Runkeeper will.\nBoth the first generation WATCH and Series 2 support syncing of a single playlist up to either 2GB or 250 songs.\n", "Q: Can I upgrade iMac 27inch 5K Display's RAM from 8GB to 32GB/64GB? I am new with Apple products. i just bought iMac 27 5k, 3.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 , 8GB Ram, 2TB Fusion Drive. i wanted to know if it is possible to increase its RAM? i asked the dealer here in Pakistan but they say you can't upgrade the RAM. you will see to send the to Apple USA which will be another expensive story.\nI want to know if i can increase its RAM to 32GB or 64GB?\nAlso what are the good supported ram which was not really expensive but affordable. can you guys directly what kind of ram i need and how to upgrade the ram? i have no idea what of ram i need to purchase online, its so confusing \n\nA: Yes, you can upgrade the RAM, and have many different options. I bought the very same system you did, and it came with 2 4 GB chips in the four available slots.  I ordered two 4 GB chips for $100 US from https://www.macsales.com, received them 3 days later, popped them in the two open slots and the system recognized the full 16GB; even though the chip pairs are from different vendors, I had no problem with it.\nIt is incredibly easy to change the RAM on the iMac and MacSales even has videos to show you how to do it. You can take it all the way up to 64 GB. The best way to see if you need more RAM is to open up Activity Monitor and watch the swap space in the memory tab. Under normal circumstances, the only time swap space is used is when the system needs more RAM than is physically installed. So if you see a lot of swap space being used, that means you are using up all the available RAM.\nOne note: Unix-based systems like Mac and Linux use far less RAM than Windows, so do not compare the two platforms for RAM capacity needs.\n", "Q: Mac App Store failed downloads I've been having problems downloading several apps and updates from the Mac App Store.\nOne thing they have in common is that all of the problematic downloads are from Apple: Xcode, iTunes update, macOS Sierra beta, OS X El Capitan update.\nMy main suspicion: My ISP has a problem with Apple downloads. I also tried downloading Xcode from the Developers site and got a persistent \"Invalid response\" error.\nSome quirks I noticed:\n\n\n*\n\n*While downloading mac OS Sierra, a 2.15 GB download, every time I try, at the end of download, the progress report goes back and forth from 2.14 GB to 2.15 GB after ultimately failing. The same thing happened on another Mac downloading.\n\n*Trying to re-download Xcode or the iTunes update, the progress is reported an order of magnitude faster than my Internet connection, like 3/4 megabytes per second. That can't be true.\n\n*Xcode on the Purchased page doesn't have a DOWNLOAD button, rather, it has an INSTALL one.\nWhat I have done so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset application from the Debug menu.\n\n*Found cache folder from Activity Monitor and deleted it.\n\n*Several reboots.\n\n*Logged out/in the App Store.\n\n*Checked for unfinished downloads.\n\n*Trying to solve using answers from: Xcode failed to download.

Here’s how to reset your PRAM/NVRAM:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the command-option-p-r keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. mouse speed, time and date/timezone, etc).\nReset the SMC\nYour computer's System Management Controller (SMC) can also be reset. The instructions for resetting your SMC depend on three things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does your device run from a built-in battery? (In your case, yes)\n\n*Does your device run from a removable battery? \n\n*Does your device just run off power from the wall?\n\n\nNow, for the sake of others who may come here looking for answers to the same issue, I will provide the process for all three. \nFor MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, and MacBooks where you can’t remove the battery on your own (i.e. it's a built-in battery), here’s what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shift-option-control (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nFor MacBook Pros, MacBooks etc that you can remove the battery from, here’s what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Disconnect the MagSafe plug (power cable) from the computer\n\n*Remove the battery\n\n*Press the power button for 5 seconds and release\n\n*Put the battery back in\n\n*Reconnect the MagSafe cord (or power cable)\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button\n\n\nFor iMacs, Mac Pros, Mac Minis, etc that only run from a power point in the wall\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Unplug it from the power\n\n*Press and hold the power button for 5 seconds\n\n*Plug it back in and turn it on.\n\n\nHope this helps. Please report back and let us know.\n\nA: Finally, the problem resolved by itself. I don't know how and why, but now I can connect any Android device.\nVery strange bug.\n@Monomeeth, thanks for guide anyway!\n", "Q: Free alternative to Charles Does anybody know a free alternative to Charles (an HTTP debugging proxy), preferably with a GUI and similar features?\nFeatures that I'm interested in:\n\n\n*\n\n*Inspect HTTP requests/responses (header, body, etc)\n\n*JSON syntax highlighting and formatting\n\n*Request filter (by host, URL, etc)\n\n*Search\n\n*Would be awesome if it could render HTML (Charles can't do it)\n\n\nA: Take a look at HTTP Toolkit. It's a great Charles Proxy alternative that I've been building, and I think it's exactly what you're looking for. It:\n\n*\n\n*is 100% open source, and all the features you're looking for are free\n\n*has a fully powered editor for request & response bodies, powered by the same internals as VS code\n\n*does targeted interception - it can launch browsers, terminal windows, or Android interception all automatically for you, and then intercepts only that specific traffic. That means no interference with the rest of your machine, no noise from other apps, and no need to globally trust an new certificate authority.\n\n*requires zero setup: open the app, click a button, instant HTTPS interception\n\n*has a far more powerful & flexible rules engine for building rules to rewrite and breakpoint your traffic\n\n*looks beautiful, is much nicer to use, and works fully cross-platform\n\nA picture's worth a 1,000 words:\n\n\nA: You can also check out mitmproxy which even has a web interface. You can inspect HTTP request/responses and even filter requests by certain parameters. \nIt doesn't render HTML like you asked but it sure gives out the raw response which might be enough. \nAnother suggestion I can think of is the developer tools in Firefox which render HTML and also support request filtering. You can obviously inspect HTTP requests in Firefox too. \n\nA: Proxyman is exclusively built on native macOS and it's designed with intuitive UI, so you can start proxying HTTPS easily and quickly.\nThe free version includes all essential feature and all debugging tools, such as Repeat and Edit, Breakpoint, Map Local, Map Remote, Scripting\nYou can intercept the HTTP traffic from iOS and Android devices too. Proxyman also has Built-in automatic scripts to override HTTP Proxy and certificate for iOS Simulator and Android Emulator.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm a creator of Proxyman (https://proxyman.io | https://github.com/ProxymanApp/Proxyman).\n\nA: You are the two following Charles like :\n\n\n*\n\n*Fiddler\nFiddler for macOS runs on mono, so don't expect the same smooth appearance like you get on Windows.\n\n\n*WireShark\nWireshark is more relevant for capturing everything over the wire (and then filtering by protocols) and not directly useful(easily) for scripting HTTP responses on the fly. \n\nA: User BurpSuite by PortSwigger\nhttps://portswigger.net/burp\nThe community edition is well enough to inspect HTTP/HTTPs traffic and more, only it cannot render HTML.\n\nA: You can also check out Proxycat which has a macOS version and an iOS version.\n", "Q: where can I adjust emoji suggestions in iOS10 I want to adjust emoji suggestions in iOS 10, like what car is suggested after typing \"car\" in a message.\nOr how can I add word-emoji links?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: You can't. This data is hard-coded in /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreEmoji.framework in the file FindReplace.strings.\nHowever, you can use those files on macOS to look up the keywords that differentiate the various cars. Here they are, I have made bold the unique words that can be used to summon each type of car.\n\nrace car, racing car, formula 1, formula one\n\npolice, cop\n\npolice, police car, cop\n\n(not available)\n\ntaxi, cab, taxi cab\n\ncar, automobile, hatchback, vehicle\n\ncar, sedan\n\ncar, jeep, SUV, automobile\n\ntrolley, tram, street car\n", "Q: Accidentally \"Removed Attachments\" via Mail.app I was trying to clear up space on my HD by running \"Remove Attachments\" in Mail.app on my Gmail accounts.\nToo late I realized this deleted the attachments from server (Gmail) as well. They all show \"[The attachment ___ has been manually removed]\".\nNow I see I should have just deleted locally from my HD, but is there any way to recover these attachments? Are they still on Gmail somewhere?\n\nA: I have just accidentally \"manually removed attachments\" from Mac mail and because I had opened them first (word documents) I was able to open Word and go to \"open recent\" and they did open and I was able to save them properly.  Just as well because I had been unable to find them in the files that were modified today.\n", "Q: ScriptEditor application signed but not accepted by Gatekeeper I created a small AppleScript app to launch a webservice locally using the built-in PHP webserver. It's an interface to generate XML configurations.\nSince macOS Sierra those apps are moved to the AppTranslocation directory if they are not signed. I just became an Apple Developer to be able to export the script from Script Editor.app as an app, signed with my Application Developer ID. Yet, when I push everything to Github and download the package as a zip file, the signed app is still executed from the AppTranslocation directory. What might be the issue here?\n\nA: Consider distributing your application within a code signed disk image, dmg, file. The contents of a code signed disk image are not subject to “Gatekeeper Path Randomization” (GPR).\nSee How do I create a nice-looking DMG for Mac OS X using command-line tools? for a guide to creating a disk image.\n", "Q: Installing Windows 10 via Boot Camp & official Microsoft retail USB TL:DR version.\nIf I bought an official retail USB key of Windows 10, can I use it as-is in Boot Camp Assistant or do I need to make a new key from a downloaded .iso?\n\nA question on Super User prompted me to try research this, but Apple's Boot Camp instructions are somewhat confusing...\nFrom Apple KB : How to install Windows using Boot Camp\nemphasis mine.\n\n2. Get a Windows disk image\nWhen you purchase Windows, it comes as a disk image file (ISO) that\nyou download, or as an installation disc or USB flash drive. If your\ncopy of Windows came on a DVD, you might need to create a disk image\nof it to work with Boot Camp. If your version of Windows came on a USB\nflash drive, you can download an ISO from Microsoft.\n\nOK, deep breath...\nDoes that actually mean that if someone went to the trouble of going to a real store & buying a real copy of Windows 10, in a box, with a USB installer & serial number on a card - that all they really gained was a serial number on a card & they still have to go through the process of making their own USB stick from a downloaded .iso?\n\nIf you follow Apple's KB trail to try figure this out, this is what happens...\nYou start from Apple KB : How to install Windows using Boot Camp & click the link at\n\n\n\n*Use Boot Camp Assistant to install a new copy of Windows.\n\n\nwhich takes you to How to install Windows using Boot Camp, my opening gambit from above & the link\n\nyou might need to create a disk image\n\nwhich takes you to Create an ISO image for Boot Camp from Windows installation media\nthe second paragraph of which states...\n\nIf your copy of Windows came on a USB flash drive, see Use Windows 10 on your Mac with Boot Camp for more information.\n\n...which takes you right back to where you started, ready to go round again...\n\nA: I believe that you will need an actual .iso image of the version of Windows you have purchased retail. Fortunately that is both easy and legal, just go here.\nDownload the same version you bought and save it to your Mac's hard drive. I would use a different USB key so you don't lose your original. But then if all you need it for is Boot Camp on the Mac go for it and use your Windows USB key with Boot Camp.\n", "Q: How do I count words in a PDF file on OS X? I'd like to count words on a PDF file on OS X. The inspector doesn't contain the word count.\n\n\nA: Use the GhostScript tool ps2ascii,\n$ ps2ascii MSWiM_2016.pdf | wc -w\n*** Warning: composite font characters dumped without decoding.\n    8964\n\n\nA: Simply open it in Microsoft Word and the word count appears at the bottom:\n\nWord's File/Properties/Statistics also has more statistics:\n\n\nA: I put together a small GUI app \"PDF Word Counter\", which returns the word count for inputted PDF files.  It has no advantage over the other answer (ps2ascii) in terms of the word count returned, but it can be a good solution for those people who don't like to use the command line.\n\nA: There's an open source tool called PDFbox (from Apache) that has some command line tools that you can use to extract the text so that it can be counted with wc.  The command (because it's a Java jar) would be as follows:\n% java -jar pdfbox.jar ExtractText -console foobar.pdf | wc -w   \n\n-console is required because it will automatically write a text file with the same base name as the source (i.e. foobar.pdf → foobar.txt)\nThis option is much smaller that what's included with Ghostscript, though it does require a JRE (Java Run Time Environment) installed though that's pretty easy to do.\n\nIt's available via MacPorts or directly from source.  It's a Java jar file, so I suggest copying it to /usr/local/bin/ and creating an alias to it for convenience\nalias pdfbox=\"java -jar /usr/local/bin/pdfbox.jar\"\n\nPut that alias in your shell profile - ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zprofile for Bash or Zsh respectively.  Then you can issue the command as follows:\n% pdfbox ExtractText -console foobar.pdf | wc -w\n\n", "Q: text width in textedit or another program How do you adjust text width?\nI am sign writing a sign for a friend into timber,  all i want to do is print out the stencil so i can use it. Everytime   I enlarge the text the width changes ! I want tall skinny letters as I am limited on the sign length \n\nA: If I understand you correctly, you want your text to increase in height but not in width. The typical text editor/word processor doesn't support this, there are at least two options you could investigate on\n\n\n*\n\n*Get a proper word processor (Pages, LibreOffice, MS Word) and either pick or install a font which matches your need\n\n*Get a drawing app which allows you to stretch images (a lot of them do) from the App Store\n\n", "Q: search Apple Notes -> jump or highlight position where match search term in note I search all my notes for \"fix\".

It has a long format of \ndrwxr-xr-x@\nand even I changed the name of it, it does not display in Finder. All its contents are accessible from terminal through.\nI use OS X 10.11.6. \nIs it a bug in the OS X?\n\nA: Short answer\nNo, this is not a bug in OS X.\nLong answer\nMac OS X volumes contain quite a few files and folders that are invisible from the Finder. Usually they're hidden for a good reason and most users won't ever need to see them. Basically, because people shouldn't muck around with them unless they know what they're doing, Apple has designed the system to hide them.\n501 folder\nOn volumes other than the boot volume, a .Trashes folder is used to store files & folders that've been moved to the trash but not yet emptied. Because every user has their own personal trash can, subfolders are created under .Trashes for each user, named according to their user ID number. For example, if user #501 throws something on a volume named \"Harry\" into the trash, it'd be moved to a folder named /Volumes/Harry/.Trashes/501/.\n", "Q: Search results in Notes on macOS always empty No matter the search term, the search results in the Notes app on macOS are always empty:\n\nThis has been going on for a while. On iOS, the same searches work fine.\nI have tried turning off iCloud, restarting, and then turning it on again. Didn't help.\nAny ideas how to debug and solve this?\nI'm on El Capitan.\n\nA: @MacManager pointed me in the right direction. The problem was that I had excluded ~/Library/Containers from Spotlight. This is where Notes' data is stored.\nI did this years ago way before the \"modern\" Notes existed and had totally forgotten about it. I wanted to stop Alfred from giving me results from that folder.\nApparently, the Notes app uses the Spotlight index for searching inside the app. \nOuch.\n", "Q: How to recover the built in Directory Service data? AFAIU, OS X has a collection of built in users, and one of these users is 'mysql' user.\nThe reason I am making this guess is, the first time I have installed mysql server using the dmg, it installed fine. However, later I have uninstalled it and deleted mysql users. When I wanted to reinstall it later again from dmg, the installation kept failing until I recreated the 'mysql' user and 'mysql' group.\nSo, is there any way to recover the built in Directory Service data (such as Users, Groups, etc.)?\n\nA: There is a daemon that backups the directory /private/var/db/dslocal nightly. If the backup hasn't occurred since the removal of the user then the info could be restored. The archive is /private/var/db/dslocal-backup.xar.\nAn alternate solution for \"system\" users and groups:\nRebuild the corresponding user and group plist's from /private/etc/passwd and /private/etc/group.\n\nA: I don't believe there's a way to restore system users- perhaps re-run the installer? I'd probably just look at another system with the same version of the OS to compare. In this case, you may have been able to copy the following files (and then correct permissions):\n/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/_mysql.plist\n/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/groups/_mysql.plist\n\n", "Q: Whenever I open the Mac Terminal it shows \"no such files or directory\" Whenever I open my Mac Terminal something goes wrong. I am getting:\n\n-bash: USERNAME: No such file or directory\n\nThis issue started to happen suddenly. I don't have any clue why it is happening.\n\nA: Whenever you open terminal some scripts are automatically called.\nPrograms (and users) add different commands to those files to set up their environment.\nIn default OS X configuration you are running a Bash shell which might run the following scripts:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.bash_profile (most probable)\n\n*~/.bashrc\n\n*/etc/bashrc\n\n*other can also be included from the above\n\n\nYou need to check (display for example with command cat ~/.bash_profile) each of them and search for the string USERNAME that is in the error message.\nThe next step depends solely on the content of the file.

You might not be doing anything wrong with the /etc/hosts code at all; however, there's a good chance the changes you are requesting are never making their way into the file in the first place.\nI'd also try mv instead of cp. mv won't change file permissions, it just unlinks the target and renames the source: so you'll need to remember to swap first (e.g. mv /etc/hosts /etc/hosts_default && mv /etc/hosts_BLOCKED_sites.txt /etc/hosts, reverse the order when you want to unblock, remember to flush DNS cache after each change, and ensure that /etc/hosts_BLOCKED_sites.txt has the same permissions/ownership as /etc/hosts before starting)\n", "Q: Automatically parse dates in Safari for adding to calendar In Mail.app, when the text looks like an appointment (date and time, etc) you are offered a shortcut to add it as an event in the Calendar app. There is no such thing in Safari (as far as I can tell.)

On my Early 2015 13\" MBP, on both El Capitan and macOS Sierra, I notice that some windows -- particularly Google Chrome, of which I have the latest stable version -- often seem to resize themselves slightly upwards without my consent, not taking up quite the full length of available area between the bottom dock and the top bar:\n\nSee the dark gap between the bottom of the Chrome window (the area with \"0 votes 0 answers\" - that's a StackExchange webpage) and the light-blue dock showing my application icons? I'd like to have the OS automatically squeeze that gap for me.\nI am not willfully doing anything weird like dragging my windows around with the mouse or resizing them when this happens. I think it happens when I close the downloads bar at the bottom of the Chrome window, most often.\nI often use Alt + Click on the green button to force a window to be maximized-but-not-fullscreen, but if it's in this intermediate state where it's \"not-quite-maximized\", this key combo does nothing.\nI don't want to run the window in fullscreen so that I have instant access to and visibility of menus and can always look at my dock without having to move my cursor to it.\nConfession: I come to MacOS with a heavily Windows-based UI familiarity, and I'm used to the paradigm of having window dressings like menus and the Windows Taskbar taking up part of the screen, but being able to easily maximize windows with the \"Maximize\" button. Indeed, this behavior is consistent for the majority of popular GNU/Linux window managers, too. It's only on OS X / macOS where I'm seeing this strange behavior of windows that like to slide a few pixels underneath the bottom dock, or pull themselves up a little over time.\n\nA: I believe this happens when dock scales up depending on a number of apps running and icons become a little big bigger.

I have noticed that many developers chose to distribute their apps inside DMGs, versus zips or other archive formats. DMGs take more time to make, and need to be verified and mounted whereas archives can be unarchived and ready to go. Also, you have to unmount a disk image before deleting it.\nWhat are the benefits of distributing applications via DMG?\n\nA: DMG is a disk image file format.\nIn the 'old days' software was distributed on physical media (eg. CD-ROMs) which were read-only and ensured the software remained as intended by the software developer. Today, because of broadband internet, software is more easily downloaded, but software developers still need to ensure their software remains as they intended. Otherwise corruption (intended or otherwise) could occur during the file transfer. \nBecause DMG files are disk images they help reduce the risk of corruption by offering a way to package data in a fairly secure manner. These files behave like a physical disk. In so doing, the operating system interprets them in the same way as if you had just inserted a CD-ROM into the computer. That's why you need to eject them as you would a CD-ROM or external drive. The difference is that the DMG file itself remains on your computer, unlike a CD-ROM that is removed when ejected.\nIn addition to behaving like a physical disk, DMG files offer the benefits of verifying the integrity of their contents when they're opened. Not only does this offer the ability to compress any data contained within them, but  also provides read-only options so they can serve only one purpose - the purpose of distributing software.\nSo, in a nutshell, DMG is a disk image format while ZIP is an archive format. They may seem to both do the same thing, but in reality they don't.\n", "Q: Can you permanently disable rootless on OS X? When booting to recover and running csrutil disable it just writes it into the NVRAM, unfortunately I reset the NVRAM very often so it's annoying to have to do that all the time. It's also annoying right now when I need to use something which requires me to turn off SIP when I can't reboot, (I am copying a bunch of files).\n\nA: The following should be possible.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install rEFInd to your EFI partition.\n\n*Use the Mac Startup Manager to make rEFInd the default system to\nboot to.\n\n*Configure rEFInd know of OS X and to not search for any other\noperating systems. (This decreases boot time.)\n\n*Configure rEFInd to operate silently and to boot OS X.\n\n*Configure rEFInd to disable all or part of SIP before booting OS X.\n\n\nNormally when you start the Mac, OS X should startup (after first silently booting rEFInd). SIP will be in whatever state you configured rEFInd to set it to.\nIf you reset NVRAM, then you may have to hold down the option key and instruct the Startup Manager to make rEFInd the default to boot to. I say may because I am not sure if resetting the NVRAM changes the default operating system to boot to.\n", "Q: Install Windows 10 on old Macbook Pro without optical drive I'm looking to install Windows 10 on an old Macbook Pro (13 inch, early 2011), which I've replaced the HDD in with a SSD. I was able to do this using a flash drive, and managed to get everything working except the audio (Windows wouldn't recognize my computer's internal speakers).  After doing some research, it appears that this problem occurs when you install Windows via EFI boot, so the recommended solution is to install Windows using a burned DVD.  Unfortunately the optical drive in my Macbook is broken, so this method isn't available to me.  I have to tried to install Windows on a partition of my SSD using Virtual Box, but it's not clear to me how to get around the fact that my drive is a GPT partition scheme. (Windows 10 won't allow me to install to my BOOTCAMP partition because it is a GPT scheme)  \nIn short, I would like to install Windows 10 in BIOS (to avoid audio issues) on a partition of my SSD without using the optical drive.  Any suggestions for accomplishing this would be appreciated, thanks.\n\nA: Try this method. If you have any problems or questions, post a comment below. BTW, this is not the only method that works. Other variations exist, so if this one does not work, I can suggest another.\nBasically, you will be creating a virtual disk to replace the DVD or flash drive that you would normally use. You will be installing Windows to boot using the BIOS boot method. Good luck! \n", "Q: How to upgrade system default vim? Finally, vim 8.0 has been released! However, the pre-installed vim is vim 7.3 on my system(OS X El Capitan), and I want to upgrade it to the newest 8.0 version. \nSo how can I do this without messing things up? Would it be a good idea to simply override the vim in /usr/bin/vim? And what about compiling it from source?\n\nA: You can install vim with Homebrew overriding the current system's vim with the --with-override-system-vi:\nbrew install vim -- --with-override-system-vi \n\nRemember to restart your terminal after that to make sure the new symbolic links work as expected.\n\nA: Get the Homebrew* package manager.\nInstall vim formula (as of today it is Vim 8.0.2) with:\nbrew install vim\n\nCheck the messages it produced for any manual actions you might be required to perform, although with Vim formula there should be no issues.\nOne more thing you should do is to check your environment variables for those that might contain a full path to the system vi/vim, like EDITOR and update them to use the /usr/local/bin/vim.\n\nIf you had Homebrew already installed, before running the install command, update the local repository with:\nbrew update\n\nIf you had Vim already installed with Homebrew (or if in the future you'd like to upgrade the Vim version), then run:\nbrew upgrade vim\n\n\n* Homebrew is an open-source, actively maintained package manager for Mac OS X. It keeps the packages in /usr/local/Cellar folder by default. It stores links to the executable files /usr/local/bin and puts this directory ahead of system directories in the PATH environment variable. Your /usr/bin/vim can thus be left alone.\nHomebrew will also take care of all the paths and dependencies for installed packages.\n", "Q: Two different apple id 's contacts sync together I have sign out my apple id and deleted my contacts then sign in my friend's apple id and merge his contacts.Then sign out his apple id.But the problem is when i have sign in my own appID,contacts were combined together.now our contacts are synced.i don't understand why this has happened and i don't want him to have my contacts.what should i do now???\n\nA: You mentioned, \"I have sign out my apple id and deleted my contacts then...\", if you are sure about that, you don't have to worry about your friend getting your contacts. \nAfter your friend signing in their Apple ID on your phone, you or your friend probably might not select to delete the contacts after signing out from your device. That would be the reason that you can see your friend's contact. \nYou can easily restore your contacts via iCloud (https://www.icloud.com/#settings). \n", "Q: I think an iPhone 6 is causing connection issues with other devices connected to my router (with Ethernet), how can I avoid it? I have a MacBoook Pro with OS X 10.9.5 connected to my router with a Power Line Connection and Ethernet, which I did because I use the laptop to play an real time online game which needs mostly a stable ping and no ping spikes, and using WiFi at a distance was deteriorating the gaming experience.\nThe problem is, someone in my house has bought an iPhone 6 (after I installed the PLC, so I'm not quite sure if the problem arises all the same if the MacBook is connected by wifi), and by trial and error I highly suspect that it interacts with the internet connection to other devices. Whenever the phone came home, if I was playing, the connection went nuts. Not that ping went high, but overboard. To the point of not being able to navigate normally either: websites, youtube videos, etc. I mean, charging any light website shouldn't need that much speed, and still it doesn't work.\nI would think that it's not possible that an iPhone 6 with a few apps, which sometimes isn't even transmitting any significant data, could take up that much bandwidth (the local connection is supposed to be around 10Mb/s, and I've been able to enjoy 1,5Mb/s download speeds with torrent). \nSo I don't really know what the cause is, or how to solve it. Is it truly a bandwidth problem? How does the router determine how much bandwidth is allotted to each device/output (wifi/ethernet)? Could I change the router settings (it's a normal low-end router given by my internet provider) to make the computer a priority, so that the iphone only takes reasonable/excess bandwidth?\n\nA: Troubleshooting is basically a process of elimination, but this one may be a little hard to do through the comments, so here we go.\nTEST 1\nLet's start by doing this test:\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch Wi-Fi off in your iPhone settings (not just disconnect). \n\n*Totally shut down the iPhone. \n\n*Use your Wi-Fi as usual to play your real-time game for about a half hour and make a note of the results.\n\n*Switch the iPhone back on but do not switch Wi-Fi back on.\n\n*Use your Wi-Fi as usual to play your real-time game for about a half hour and make a note of the results.\n\n*Switch Wi-Fi back on in the iPhone and connect it to your Wi-Fi.\n\n*Use your Wi-Fi as usual to play your real-time game for about a half hour and make a note of the results.\n\n\nAfter following the steps of test 1 you should have three sets of results to share back. This will greatly help you and the community to narrow down your problem, one way or other.\nTEST 2\nOkay, Power Line adapters are notoriously 'fussy' and it doesn't take much for something to interfere with the quality of their connection. Let's do this test:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect both ends of the Power Line connection, totally removing them from power etc.\n\n*Connect your MacBook Pro directly to the router via ethernet.\n\n*Ensure the iPhone is not connected to your Wi-Fi and play your real-time game for about a half hour and make a note of the results.\n\n*Now make sure the iPhone is connected to your Wi-Fi network and play your real-time game for about a half hour and make a note of the results.\n\n\nLet us know the results.\n", "Q: Displaced Xcode text on file new project \nAs you can see from the image. the text is displaced.

I don't have access to it and never will. \nIOS 8 badgers me constantly to join that WiFi network.   Anytime I wake the iPad I have to tell it 1-2 times.  No. No. No. No. No.  How do I get iOS to stop asking about that particular network, without turning off \"ask to join networks\" altogether?\nAs you know there are several ways a notification can occur.  Badges, banners and alerts.   The \"WiFi helper\" always uses an Alert, which is the most intrusive one.  You know what I mean.  Is there any way to convince iOS to alert you to WiFis with a banner?  (Like my Android does?) \nI know I can turn off \"Ask to join networks\" altogether.   I don't want to do that.  I want the feature, I just want it to behave less lamely.   Did they fix it in iOS 9 or 10?  I am reluctant to upgrade because this iPad 3 is already sluggish and freezes a lot on iOS 8.  \n\nA: Short answer is no. \nYou can have Ask to join networks turned on to be notified (as you've already noticed) or off to not be notified at all. There's no intermediary position on a stock, non-jailbroken device. \n", "Q: How to access recent files or folders in Finder or in file dialogs? Most of the time I spend in Finder dialogs is trying to find the file or folder I accessed a few minutes ago.\nExamples\n\n\n*\n\n*I use an image editing program to create a funny picture. Then I go to a website to upload the picture. Now I have to find it all over again in the upload dialog.\n\n*I'm making a game. Say first I create a sound effect to use in the game and save it to the project folder. Next I create a sprite in an image editing program. When I save it, I want to save it in the same folder. Now I have to find the folder again.\n\n*I download a zip file. After it has downloaded I want to go to the folder to which it was downloaded to extract it.\nIn other words, this happens all the time.\nIs there any way to access recent files or folders in Finder or in file dialogs?\n\nA: Yes, there is a way, although a commercial one. It will cost you $34.95 and AFAIK there are no competitive solutions.\nThe Default Folder X program wraps the dialog boxes with it's own frame allowing you to navigate to: a recent file or folder, a folder you configured as favourite, a folder that you used recently with a particular application.\nSo it fits into all of your three scenarios. Additionally you can open recent and favourite places in Finder by using the icon in the menu bar.\n\nA: The option offered by techraf is one way to go, but I do think there is a built-in OS X option available that will meet your needs (or most of them).\nIn every OS X 'Open' dialogue box or 'Save as' dialogue box you have a drop-down menu which you can click on to select other locations. Clicking on this will also list your recent places and allows you to open from or save to these as needed.\nDepending on your setup, you may need to click on the arrow button appearing next to the field (on the right) to make the drop-down visible.\nAs an aside (and you're probably aware of this - but for the benefit of others) on a related note you can access recent applications and documents under Apple Menu > Recent Items. \nYou can also increase/decrease the number of recent items listed here by accessing System Preferences > Appearance on older systems or System Preferences > General on newer ones.\nHope this helps.\n[EDIT]\nOkay, here are some images showing an example of how to view recent places in Mac OS X Save As dialogue boxes and Open dialogue boxes. These examples are based on OS X El Capitan, but other versions also work in a similar fashion.\n\n\nPlease note:\n\n\n*\n\n*Various applications may display these dialogue boxes differently, but all offer the ability to view recent places\n\n*In my images, Desktop is shown in the Where drop-down menu. However, this may be different depending on your circumstances\n\n*If you can't seem to see a list of recent places, make sure if there is an arrow next to the Save As field that it faces down (see below)\n\n\n\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I created an intelligent folder \"current folders\" which shows all folders that are opened within the last day and with type equals folder.\nThen I added this to the folder side bar.\n\nA: Here is another way to do it. You can install fswatch. And then run a script that will watch for file changes in a specific directory, and then create a symbolic link (or symlink) in the \"recent\" folder, which you can add as an often used folder in finder.\nfswatch /Users/<USERNAME>/somedirectory | xargs -I {} sh -c \"ln -s '{}' /Users/<USERNAME>/recent/\"\n\nYou would need to run this on startup or in the background.\nThe nice thing about making a symlink is that it doesn't copy the actual file - it just makes a pointer back to the one that you recently modified.\nThis solution also works on Linux.

The instructions for resetting your SMC depend on three things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does your device run from a built-in battery? \n\n*Does your device run from a removable battery? \n\n*Does your device just run off power from the wall?\n\n\nNow, since I don't know what computer you're using, I will provide the process for resetting the SMC in all three scenarios. Just use the one that is appropriate for your machine.\nFor MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, and MacBooks where you can’t remove the battery on your own (i.e. it's a built-in battery), here’s what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shift-option-control (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nFor MacBook Pros, MacBooks etc that you can remove the battery from, here’s what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Disconnect the MagSafe plug (power cable) from the computer\n\n*Remove the battery\n\n*Press the power button for 5 seconds and release\n\n*Put the battery back in\n\n*Reconnect the MagSafe cord (or power cable)\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button\n\n\nFor iMacs, Mac Pros, Mac Minis, etc that only run from a power point in the wall\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Unplug it from the power\n\n*Press and hold the power button for 5 seconds\n\n*Plug it back in and turn it on.\n\n\nHope this helps. Please report back and let us know.\n", "Q: What happened to Automatic Termination? In Mac OS X Lion (10.7) Apple introduced a feature called \"Automatic Termination\" where apps would automatically quit after a while of inactivity.\nI personally only ever saw this working with Preview and a few other apps. Neither Apple nor third-party developers seemed to adopt it much. And in recent years, I haven't seen a single app automatically quit, not even Preview.\nMy question is, what happened to this feature? Does it still exist? Do any developers make use of it? And why did Apple themselves stop using it in their apps?\n\nA: The answer of Graham Miln is very complete, there's just a few notes I'd like to add:\n1) An app can support Automatic Termination or Sudden Termination or even both. The difference between these two is: With Automatic Termination the system can quit the app \"at will\" but it will quit it \"normally\" (just as if you choose Quit <AppName> from the <AppName> menu), allowing the app to perform some work on quit, so it can be restored back into that state when being reopened. With Sudden Termination, the system can \"kill\" the app \"at will\" without any chance for the app to perform any actions prior to dying as it will die instantly, which is much faster.\n2) Apps can support either form of termination without declaring it in their Info.plist file, so the grep not listing an app doesn't mean the app won't support either feature. Actually the Info.plist entry only changes the default behavior of an app. The default behavior is to support neither one, unless the code enables either one explicitly. When declared in their Info.plist file, the behavior is the other way round: The declared feature is enabled by default, unless the code disables it explicitly. \n3) The reason for controlling these features in code is that only the app itself can know if is currently really idle or actually waiting for some event to take place and thus must not die at the moment. So an app can temporary switch both off while waiting for something to happen or processing some data internally and then switch them back on once done.\n4) In both cases, the system decides when to terminate an app and when not (\"at will\") and in many cases the system just doesn't want to as it has no reason to do so. E.g. if the system runs out of memory, it will aggressively look for apps it can terminate to quickly free up memory for those that shall continue to run but as long as there is no shortage, what advantage would it have for the system to kill these apps? Next time you use them they only need to be restarted which is a waste of processing time when there was no reason to quit them in the first place. And memory shortage is not defined by the amount of free memory you have (you have no shortage just because all memory seems in use) but by the so called \"memory pressure\". Activity Monitor can show you the memory pressure of your system. So just because an app supports either form of termination, it's not said that the system will actually make use of that feature.\n5) With the introduction of XPC services in 10.8, some apps started to use these little helpers for performing their processing tasks. XPC Services implicitly support Sudden Termination. Despite belonging to an app, XPC Services don't display any UI (and don't show up in Dock), so you won't notice when they are started and when they are terminated. That means instead of having the system terminating the whole app to save resources, resource intense apps can use XPC Services and the system will terminate these XPC services if required which often makes it unnecessary for the app itself to support either form of termination as terminating the app will now hardly save the system a lot of resources if the main resource usage is caused by the XPC Services of that application.\n\nA: Automatic Termination remains part of macOS. When implemented correctly, you should not see it in action.\nTo discover which applications know about Automatic Termination, issue the following command in Terminal.app:\ngrep -r NSSupportsAutomaticTermination /Applications\n\nRequires More Code\nSupporting Automatic Termination requires additional and, frequently involved, effort from the application developer.\nThe application needs to deal with an environment where it could be required to quit at (almost) any time; that means being able to save and restore state quickly, with no user interaction, and at (almost) any moment:\n\nAutomatic termination is a feature that you must explicitly code for in your app. Declaring support for automatic termination is easy, but apps also need to work with the system to save the current state of their user interface so that it can be restored later as needed. The system can kill the underlying process for an auto-terminable app at any time, so saving this information maintains continuity for the app. Usually, the system kills an app’s underlying process some time after the user has closed all of the app’s windows. However, the system may also kill an app with open windows if the app is not currently on screen, perhaps because the user hid it or switched spaces.\n\nAsk Apple\nWhy Apple appears to have removed support from some of their applications in OS X 10.11 is a question best directed to Apple.\nA Matter of Priorities\nAnyone who writes Mac applications must judge if this is a feature worth implementing and if that engineering time is better spent elsewhere. This will always be a matter of judgement for the developer, so I suspect your question can never be definitively answered.\nTell Developers\nIf you have applications you want to support Automatic Termination, tell the application's developers. If enough customers value Automatic Termination, then developers will make the time to implement it.\n", "Q: What are the technical and security features of the iPhone 7 fingerprint reader?

Generally these are the 2012 and later models. The originally released version of Windows 10 was number 1511. The Windows version can be determined by opening a Command Prompt window and entering the command winver. Below is example. \n\nFor version 1511, read only access to HFS+ formatted partitions can be enabled by installing the Boot Camp Support Software. \nRecently, Microsoft has released a new version numbered 1607. This is referred to as the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. This version has a bug that can prevent read only access to HFS formatted volumes. Here is a link to an Apple Communities web site that also confirms this bug exists. Therefore, if you using version 1601 of Windows 10, you many not be able to access HFS formatted volumes even if you have installed the Boot Camp Support Software. Until this bug is fixed, users will have to use version 1511 or find another way copy data from HFS formatted volumes.\nParagon Software offers drivers that allow read/write access to HFS+ file systems. They offer a 10 day trial period for you test the drivers. I have not done this. So I do not know if the bug also affects their drivers. Another alternative would be to allow OS X to read/write to NTFS formatted volumes.

Googling for that distinction landed me at https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/106394/what-are-other-contacts-in-the-new-google-contacts\n\n*Turns out that on Android and using Google Contacts you can star-favorite and search through contacts that are not part of your contact list. You can see these at the bottom left of the contacts site or go to https://contacts.google.com/other\n\n*The saddest part of this all - a contact you have starred or marked as favorite is NOT in your contacts list export, does not show up on your iPhone, and the only way to fix it is to unfavorite that contact, because only then you can see that it's a \"Other contact\" and fix it by selecting it and clicking \"Add to contacts\".\n\n\nThis is how google describes these other contacts:\n\nPeople you’ve interacted with in Google products, as well as any contacts you’ve hidden from your list. These contacts appear as autocomplete suggestions to help you communicate and share. Go to your Google Account to control how these contacts are saved.\n\nHow Google should fix it on their back end\nGoogle should probably convert every single \"Other contact\" that has a phone number to real contacts.\nA favorite or star should always be in the contacts. And perhaps the concept of \"other contacts\" should be higher up in the menu at contacts.google.com and not the bottom left most. At least if the amount of \"other contacts\" was mentioned somewhere, I could have figured this problem out without spelunking.\nI suspect the \"original sin\" bug might have been that contacts added by some older apps did not do whatever google contacts expected them to do. So real contacts accidentally ended up in the \"Other contacts\" bin by mistake. My original phone was a Galaxy S II, so perhaps the Samsung contacts app had this issue.\n", "Q: Can I use USB headset with iPhone? I have a USB headset. It works just fine on a PC or a Macbook without any install.\nIf I connect it to an Android phone with micro-USB port, via some micro-USB to full-size USB adapter, it doesn't work. It can even restart the whole phone.\nFor iPhone with the Lightning port, is it possible to connect a USB headset to it via some Lightning-to-USB adapter?\n\nA: I've tried the Apple USB -> Lightining dongle with USB headphones. It delivers audio from some audio apps, but not the phone. Even with the phone app, I can hear the dial tones, but not the conversation. The conversation comes out from the phone's speaker.\n\nA: If your USB headset uses a split between USB power and an auxiliary line for the audio input you can use a battery pack to power the headset with the USB cable and use the dongle that comes with the iPhone 7 to connect the audio output from your iPhone 7 to your headset. Otherwise if you rely on getting audio transmission through USB data you will be out of luck unless somebody makes an external driver dongle for the iPhone.\n\nA: \nFor iPhone with the Lightning port, is it possible to connect a USB headset to it via some Lightning-to-USB adapter?\n\nYes.  I have done this myself using the Apple Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter.\nhttps://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK0W2AM/A/lightning-to-usb-3-camera-adapter\nI was able to use a USB audio adapter to plug in headphones.  I had no real need to do this but to prove it works.  I have other, more convenient, means to connect headphones to my iPhone.\nIt's called a \"camera adapter\" but it will work with a number of USB device types.  I tested it with mice, keyboards, and audio devices, they all work.  If the sound comes out the wrong audio device then selecting it manually will fix it.  Sometimes the iPhone will not switch to the headphones that were plugged in.\n\nA: You may be able to connect a USB headset to an iPhone 7, but it will not work until the required USB drivers and the ability to install them are available, which will probably not happen.\n", "Q: What is the difference between the original Apple watch, and the 2016 announcement of \"Series 1\" As of the latest announcement in 2016, there appears to be 3 types of Apple watches\n\n\n*\n\n*Original (Series 0?)\n\n*Series 1\n\n*Series 2\n\n\nWhat isn't clear is the distinction between the original Apple watch and Series 1. \nPrior to the announcement, the original Apple Watch (Series 0) listed at $349.

I upgraded to an SSD earlier this year, and the experience has been great!\nI use Time Machine for backup on a weekly basis on to an external hard drive and have noticed that the size of the backups have grown ~5X. Earlier, with a hard drive, the size of the backup was ~10GB, and now, the backup size is ~50GB.\nI suspect this has something to do with the way SSDs work, specifically something about SSDs having to rewrite huge sections of memory even if only a part of the section needs to be changed. \nHas anyone had a similar experience?\nHardware: I am using Micron's Crucial BX100 SSD on an early 2011 MBP running OS X El Capitan (Version 10.11.6)\n\nA: \nI suspect this has something to do with the way SSDs work, specifically something about SSDs having to rewrite huge sections of memory even if only a part of the section needs to be changed.\n\nThis happens at the storage and controller level - it is completely transparent to the operating system.\nYou have already found the main cause, but one thing you didn't notice was that the day after you changed your drive, Time Machine did a complete backup from the beginning. TM noticed a new device ID on the drive and made a new backup. It is possible to join backups IF you do it before the first run after the drive change, but it involves some tinkering in the Terminal.\n\nA: Discovered later that huge backup size was being created by a VM that I am also running on my Mac. Stopped backing up the VM directory and things are good.\n", "Q: Installing Windows 7 without DVD/Flash Drive - stuck at step 5 I was following this amazing guide on how to install Windows 7 without Bootcamp and got stuck at step 5. It should create files, but it didn't. I got the following result in Terminal:\n\nAfter doing what David told me to do, I noticed it created the partition on 'disk0s5', or at least it has this as its identifier.\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE           IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB         disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB       disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS HDD                     749.7 GB       disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB       disk0s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                249.5 GB       disk0s5\n/dev/disk1 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE           IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        +2.0 GB         disk1\n   1:                 DOS_FAT_32 BCSS                    2.0 GB         disk1s1\n\nIs it alright to just switch things around and replace every Terminal command containing 'disk0s4' with 'disk0s5', so it locates the right partition?\nThanks in advance. :)\n\nA: Usually the OS X operating system is synchronized with the values stored in the GUID Partition Table (GPT). In other words, partition 4 in the table for disk0 would be be identified as /dev/disk0s4. In your case, the identifier is /dev/disk0s5.

Around the year 2000, Apple wrote a press release that every Mac since 1984 would avoid the Y2K problem, and could process dates for the next several thousand years.\n\nThe good news is that since their introduction in 1984, Macintosh computers have had the ability to make the transition to the year 2000. In fact, the Mac OS and most Mac applications can handle internally generated dates correctly all the way to the year 29,940. \n\nThis statement was made when Mac OS 9 was the most recent operating system.\nSince then, OS X (now called macOS) is the dominant operating system, which is derived from Unix. Does this mean that any version is vulnerable to the Year 2038 problem, a problem comparable to the Y2K problem that affects Unix-like systems? Or does the statement Apple gave about being compatible to the year 29,940 still hold true?\n\nA: Well, as far as El Capitan 10.11.6 is in question, answer is not as easy as using Perl script.\nIf we try this\nmacmladen@buk $ touch -t 205012121212 my\nmacmladen@buk $ ls -al\ntotal 104\ndrwx------  7 root root    4096 Dec 25 13:42 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 23 root root    4096 Dec  4 17:06 ..\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root       0 Dec 12  2050 my\n\nSo that proves macOS in lowest, system layer is safe from Y2038 bug.

Most installs of 10.6 and all installs of 10.7 \"Lion\" fixed the main cause of the problem. It's almost gone, but the year 2038 bug might survive in a few apps.\nMy old PowerPC Mac runs OS X 10.4.11 \"Tiger\". I went to Date & Time in System Preferences, and tried to enter a date after 2038, but it reset the date to December 31, 2037. It knows that something's wrong in 2038.\n\nOS X is derived from Unix by way of BSD. Apps for OS X use BSD system calls for things like opening files and connecting to the internet. BSD has a long history and some of its system calls come from the 1980s. One of its system calls is gettimeofday(), which first appeared in 4.1cBSD. UC Berkeley released 4.1cBSD in 1982, more than half a century before 2038. The time from gettimeofday() is an integer of type time_t. It counts seconds, where zero is the Unix epoch of 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.\nIn my old PowerPC Mac, time_t is a signed 32-bit integer. This causes the year 2038 problem. A signed 32-bit time_t has a range of -2147483648 to 2147483647. This can only hold times from 1901-12-13 20:45:52 UTC to 2038-01-19 03:14:07 UTC. When this overflows, gettimeofday() will flip the date from Monday the 19th of January 2038 to Friday the 13th of December 1901.\nThe fix is to transition from 32-bit time_t to 64-bit time_t. For OS X, this transition happened along with another transition from 32-bit pointers to 64-bit pointers, but 64-bit pointers require a 64-bit processor. Apple has only provided 64-bit time_t for 64-bit processors. It is possible for 32-bit processors to handle 64-bit time_t, but Apple never provided that feature.\nApple's compilers have supported 64-bit integers on 32-bit processors since OS X 10.0 \"Cheetah\", when time_t had 32 bits and off_t had 64 bits. In Unix and BSD, off_t is the size of a file, or an entire disk. A 32-bit off_t would limit OS X to disks under 2 GiB. Apple defined off_t as 64 bits, so OS X worked with larger disks. Apple defined time_t as 32 bits in 10.0, so a transition to 64-bit time_t needed to happen later.\nFor my old PowerPC Mac, the header file <ppc/_types.h> defines __darwin_time_t as long. For Intel Mac, the header <i386/_types.h> does the same. In OS X, long has the same size as a pointer. So when pointers became 64 bits, long also became 64 bits, and time_t also became 64 bits, fixing the main cause of the year 2038 problem.\nApple's 64-Bit Transition Guide says, \"Prior to OS X v10.6, all applications that shipped with the operating system were 32-bit applications. Beginning in v10.6, applications that ship with the operating system are generally 64-bit applications.\" I know from Wikipedia that 10.6 required an Intel processor and 10.7 required a 64-bit Intel processor. A Mac running 10.6 on a 32-bit Intel processor must have had 32-bit apps. I conclude that most Macs running 10.6 and all Macs running 10.7 have 64-bit apps with 64-bit pointers and 64-bit time_t. Apple released 10.7 in 2011, well before January 2038.\nWith 64-bit time_t, the year 2038 bug is almost gone, but it might survive in a few apps. Old 32-bit apps might still run on newer systems. Also, 64-bit apps might contain coding mistakes or outdated designs, causing them to convert a 64-bit time_t to 32 bits. This is a problem for all systems, not only macOS.\n\nThere is also Mach time. The kernel of OS X mixes BSD with Mach. Most apps get the time from BSD using gettimeofday(), but there is a way to go around BSD and get the time from Mach. This is more difficult: the program would call mach_host_self() to get the host port, then host_get_clock_service() to get the CALENDAR_CLOCK, and finally clock_get_time().\nIn my old Mac running 10.4 \"Tiger\", <mach/clock_types.h> declares the time as an unsigned int (inside struct mach_timespec). This is an unsigned 32-bit integer, with range from 0 to 4294967295, which is from 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC to 2106-02-07 06:28:15 UTC. This would exchange the year 2038 problem for the year 2106 problem. It can't reach year 29,940.\nI suspect that host_get_clock_service() was obsolete since 10.0 \"Cheetah\", because Apple provided faster ways to get the time. These were BSD's gettimeofday() for calendar time, and Apple's mach_absolute_time() for monotonic time. The preference for gettimeofday() put the problem in 2038, not 2106.\n", "Q: My iPhone can't text friend's Android, but my wife's iPhone can A friend of mine just switched from iPhone to Android.  He can text me without any problem, but I can't text him at all. I have tried everything I can think of but no message will ever reach him.  They are of course transmitting as SMS since he is no longer on iMessage.\nThe strange part is, my wife's iPhone (4s running iOS 6) can text him perfectly fine, no problem at all, so whatever is happening seems to be on my end.\nAny suggestions on how I can sort this?\n\nA: This occurs because Apple still believes the phone number is using iPhone, but it can vary from device to device whether this impacts sending and receiving messages to that number (and how long it takes for that to resolve).\nThe quickest way to resolve it is for your friend to read the Apple support article Deregister iMessage. The deregister process can be done from the old iPhone (if it's still available) or online. It still may take a few hours for all Apple devices to recognize the number no longer uses iMessage, but it could take much longer without completing the deregister process.\n\nA: You mentioned in a comment that the friend uses an iPad. Therefore if you send him an iMessage, it’s delivered to his iPad and not the Android phone. Settings > Messages > Send as SMS only applies when the iMessage cannot be delivered but it is not the case when it’s successfully delivered to the iPad.\nI can imagine two solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your friend must turn off his iPad (airplane mode is enough) when he cannot check it.\n\n*He must deregister iMessage for his phone number, keeping only e-mail address as the iMessage ID. Then start a new conversation with him on your iPhone. Type his name to the To: field and select the item with the green phone number. This selection works for my friend having iPad and a “dumb” phone. However, I haven’t tested the procedure of deregistering iMessage.\n\n\nA: If your friend is a Verizon customer, and uses Verizon's Messages+ app, it might be that your friend has unintentionally (or intentionally) muted your conversation on his/her new Android device.\n", "Q: Access VirtualBox shared folders in Yosemite tl;dr: How to access folder shared in host system from within Yosemite run in VirtualBox (guest)?\nI have added a shared folder in my VirtualBox (went to virtual machine's settings, then to Shared Folder and added a new shared folder path there).

I made \".iso\" image and connect it to the guest OS as CD. The disadvantage is a one way direction from Host to Guest but for me it was ok because I needed to pass some files for testing.\n\nA: AFAIK the shared folder feature of VirtualBox only works with the VirtualBox guest additions. The additions can't be installed in a OS X/macOS guest. Thus you can't use this feature.\nInstead share a folder in the OS X/macOS guest system by enabling \"File Sharing\" in System Preferences > Sharing > File Sharing.\nIf the default public user folder is not sufficient, add another folder and determine user permissions. The protocol can be chosen by hitting the \"Options\" button.\n\nDepending on your host system you can also configure a shared folder there.\n\nVisibility of the guest's shared folder:\nLet's assume the host system's only physical network interface (e.g. an Ethernet adapter) has an IP in the network 192.168.0.0/24.\nIf you attach the guest's network adapter to the Bridged network > (Host's) Ethernet adapter and configure the guest's Ethernet adapter with a (unique) IP of the 192.168.0.0/24 network, the shared folder of the guest is visible for all hosts and virtual hosts in the 192.168.0.0/24 network. To access the folder your hosts have to talk afp, smb (or nfs - which has to be set up seperately) of course.\nIf you attach the guest's network adapter to the Host-only network > vboxnet0, the shared folder of the guest is visible for all guest hosts attached to the vboxnet0 network on the same machine and the host machine itself.\nIf you attach the guest's network adapter to a NAT network > vboxnatnet01, the shared folder of the guest is visible for all guest hosts attached to the vboxnatnet01 network on the same machine and the host machine itself. If you enable port forwarding properly the shared folder is also visible for other hosts or virtual hosts in the 192.168.0.0/24 network.\n", "Q: Itunes 12.2 format playlist as songs not working I am aware that there is supposed to be a little dropdown in the upper, right-hand corner of Itunes that allows one to change the format of a playlist.

The best tools to get this are diskutil and gpt – both command line tools which have to be executed in Terminal.app.\nOpen Terminal.app and enter:\ndiskutil list\n\nTo execute a command you always have to enter the Enter key.\nThe command above will yield something like this (depending on the number of disks in your Mac):\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            499.2 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n/dev/disk2\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk2\n   2:       Microsoft Basic Data tower 1                 1.0 TB     disk2s2\n\nThe example shows the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*disk0 is your system drive containing an EFI partition (disk0s1), your main system volume \"Macintosh HD\" (disk0s2)  and a recovery volume (disk0s3). All partitions sizes (0.2 GB + 499 GB + 0.7 GB) add up to the total size of the disk (500 GB)\n\n*disk1 is a 1 TB drive only containing an EFI with a size of 200 MB and with 999.8 GB empty space\n\n*disk2 is a 1 TB drive containing one 1 TB volume probably formatted to FAT32, ExFAT or NTFS\n\n\nNow one can deduce that the missing volume tower 2 once resided on disk1.\nAfter a reboot the disk identifiers of the second and the third disk may be exchanged! So always execute diskutil list before manipulating partition tables!\nTo get a closer look on disk1 use gpt:\nsudo gpt -r show /dev/disk1\n\nThis will reveal:\n      start        size  index  contents\n         0           1         PMBR\n         1           1         Pri GPT header\n         2          32         Pri GPT table\n        34           6         \n        40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n    409640  1953115495         \n1953525135          32         Sec GPT table\n1953525167           1         Sec GPT header\n\nThis means:\n\n\n*\n\n*The disk has a GUID partition table (GPT)\n\n*The first partition (index = 1) is an EFI type partition (C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B), starting at block 40 and with a size of of 409600 blocks (~209.7 MB)\n\n*Starting at block 409640 1953115495 blocks (~1 TB) of the disk are not allocated to a partition.\n\n\nYou can assume that your \"lost\" partition (with the volume name tower 2) once resided here.\nAfter adding a partition it has to be formatted and a file system has to be created. The file system may be (beyond others): HFS+, ExFAT or NTFS\nIf you know the previous file system you can continue restoring a partition. If you don't know the file system you can determine it by searching for typical file system headers.\nTo determine a previous HFSJ volume use:\nsudo hexdump /dev/disk1 | grep \"48 46 53 4a\"\n\nThis will search for the string \"HFSJ\" on your raw disk. After getting the first results simply enter ctrlC to abort the command.\nOn your type of disk you should get the following results:\nc805400 48 2b 00 04 80 00 20 00 48 46 53 4a 00 00 01 ff\nca13e00 48 2b 00 04 80 00 20 00 48 46 53 4a 00 00 01 ff\nca40e00 48 2b 00 04 80 00 20 00 48 46 53 4a 00 00 01 ff\n...\n\nHere the important line is the first one: c805400 48 2b 00 04 80 00 20 00 48 46 53 4a 00 00 01 ff with c805400 being the offset in hex. Converted with a hex2dec service this means an offset of Byte 209736704 (dividing this by 512 Bytes/block, the result is equal to block 409642). Typically the 3rd block of an HFSJ volume contains the string \"HFSJ\". So you have found the beginning of an HFSJ volume: block 409640 (BlockF).\nThe end of an HFSJ volume can be found accordingly because the 3rd last block contains the last HFSJ occurrence:\nsudo hexdump -s 930g /dev/disk1 | grep \"48 46 53 4a\"\n\nThe option -s means: Skip offset bytes from the beginning of the input.\nWith the last offset (and doing the math like above) you can determine the last block (BlockL) of the previous HFSJ volume by simply adding 2 blocks. The size of the HFSJ volume is then (BlockL-BlockF).\nWith all necessary data gathered you can now try to restore the lost volume tower 2 with the sudo gpt add ... command.\nTo add a partition entry you have to execute:\nsudo gpt add -i number -b number -s number -t type diskX\n\nwith\n\n\n*\n\n*-i index number\n\n*-b number of the first block\n\n*-s size in blocks\n\n*-t partition type\n\n\nI don't know neither the first offset nor the second offset of your volume tower 2, but the command below may work and the entered sizes are probable defaults:\nsudo gpt add -2 -b 409640 -s 1952443704 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk1\n\nAfter adding this entry in the partition table the volume should be mounted automatically.\nCheck the disk and the volume with:\ndiskutil verifyDisk disk1\ndiskutil verifyVolume disk1s2\n\nIf a repair is necessary use the \"prefix\" repair instead of verify!\n\nIf you have any questions or can't find the string \"HFSJ\" please add a comment with @klanomath!\n", "Q: iPhone 6s running iOS 10 claims watchOS 2.2.1 is up to date when I attempt to update my Apple Watch Today, iOS 10 and watchOS 3 launched, however when I try to update my Apple Watch, I get \"watchOS 2.2.1 Your software is up to date.\"\n\nObviously, it's not. According to this article, watchOS 3 is for sure out. The paired iPhone is an American (just to rule out possibility of any regional differences) iPhone 6s running iOS 10.0.1. I've tried opening and closing the app, restarting my iPhone, clearing RAM (by holding the power button down until the Slide To Power Off appears, then holding down the home button)---nothing. This iPhone was in the Beta Seed Program, but I just deleted that profile and restarted the iPhone just in case. Still doesn't work. Also, my internet connection is good enough (LTE at 5 mbps), so that shouldn't prevent it from at least searching for the update. I'm out of ideas here. Is there something I can do to resolve this now?\n\nA: I forgot that I had installed the beta profile on my watch as well as my phone.  As soon as I removed the beta profile from within the watch app and rebooted both phone and watch I was able to update to watchOS 3.\n\nA: This is typical and usual at major OS launches for short windows of time after release. Apple has hundreds to thousands of update servers and they roll out the announcement of the update progressively.\nIt is highly disruptive to get a stalled download since that uses CPU and battery - so preventing 10 downloads when the servers can only accommodate 2 makes each update go more smoothly once it starts.\nI've not seen the slowness take more than 8 to 20 hours to level out - so if you are locked out for 2 days or more, you might contact support and/or try a different network connection.\nIf you want to try restarting the watch and the phone, perhaps that will jog a full check.\n\nA: I had to delete the beta profile from my watch and iPhone. The update showed up right afterwards.\n\nA: I had exactly the same issue! I found that deleting the watch beta profile, followed by restarting the watch and clearing phone RAM worked!! Hope this helps x\n", "Q: MacBook crashes with so much of heat while the lid is closed Sometimes, while I close the lid of my MacBook as it usually is while you don't use it, and leave it on the desk without connecting it to an adapter, I find that my MacBook is insanely heated. When I open the lid and check out the Mac, the OS has crashed and the trackpad doesn't function, forcing me to restart the Mac.\nAfter the restart, the alert is shown with a message like: Because a problem occurred, it has been restarted.\nThis has occurred multiple times, possibly over more than 10 times in 2 years, also on my older MacBook Pro Retina. However, why does this occur while the lid is closed and the computer isn't working?\nAnd finally, is there any possible way to prevent this? I don't remember if this problem happens when I connect it to an adapter.\n\nUPDATE\nIn Diagnostic and Usage Messages pane in Console.app, I found the following log message:\n9/14/16 06:54:57.000 kernel:\ncom.apple.message.domain: com.apple.kernel.tcpstat\ncom.apple.message.signature: tcpinfo\ncom.apple.message.signature2: mDNSResponderHel\ncom.apple.message.signature3: launchd\ncom.apple.message.summarize: YES\n\nAfter that, the computer seemed to be not working and the next log message is the one when I found it was not working and thus restarted, which occurred in 2 hours later.\nThe last log message before the following:\n9/14/16 06:54:44.436 Exchange Rates:\ncom.apple.message.domain: com.apple.coretls.client_finished\ncom.apple.message.signature: tls\ncom.apple.message.signature2: redacted_bundle_id\ncom.apple.message.value_events: 1\ncom.apple.message.value_alpn_received: 1\ncom.apple.message.summarize: YES\ncom.apple.message.value_ocsp_peer_enabled: 1\ncom.apple.message.value_ocsp_response_received: 1\n\nThere are 6 more logs at the exactly same time from the app, and the next log files before them is from com.apple.usage.app_activetime, occurred 2 seconds before them.\nSo maybe it the app Exchange Rate the one that caused the crash and forced me to restart? If so is there anything on me that prevents this (except uninstalling it, which is not a solution here)?\n\nA: The system is designed to let the CPU idle when heat becomes an issue. Crashes indicate a bad software install or faulty hardware. Either of those can be worked out with Apple Support.\nIf you want to troubleshoot the software yourself, make a backup and then perform an erase install.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904\nIf you can crash the Mac with a clean install and no restore of your data or installation of third party apps - that's a perfect test to isolate hardware as the faulty item.\n", "Q: How do I turn off typing suggestions in iOS 10? Several iOS 10 apps enable typing suggestions by default, even if these were disabled prior to iOS 10. This is especially notable in Messages, where the suggestions include emoji. \nHow do I disable typing suggestions in iOS 10?\n\nA: If, like mine you do not get the option to change the keyboard on your messages app. Go to Settings > General > Keyboard > Predictive.\nHere you can switch it off.\n\nA: Tap and hold the language key (the one that looks like a globe or possibly an Emoji smile face) and set the toggle for \"Predictive\" to off. \n\n\nA: The problem with this is that it also seems to shut off autocorrect and predictive text within the text bar -- I want nothing to do with the suggested words that can be tapped, but I like the autocorrect and suggestions that hover while typing. If that makes sense.\nUpdate: Actually, this only seems to happen when turning off predictive text within the settings app. So this is good. \n", "Q: iOS 10 message effects send to phone number but not email address If I send an iMessage to my son using his phone number, the new message effects work without issue.  If I send an iMessage to him using his email address (still in Messages), they do not work and show the parenthetical text (\"Sent with xxxx effect\") when he receives the message.  When I send it, I see the desired effect.  Neither of us have reduce motion or anything of the sort turned on.  Note that they are both \"blue\" iMessage conversations.\nI've tried deleting the conversation where it was failing (to his email) and that didn't change anything.  \nIs there a reason why he would see the effects if I send to his phone number vs. his email address?\n\nA: This may sound bizarre but you obviously have searched and checked and/or corrected the most common reasons of why it does not work correctly.\nThere is one thing that I am seeing a lot of on forums that you have not mentioned.\n\nI fixed this by going to Settings/Messages, then turning iMessage on\n  and off.\n\n", "Q: Auto Unlock not working on MBP Early 2013 - iOS 10 - watchOS 3.0 - macOS Sierra GM For some reason, I cannot get \"Auto Unlock\" to work. \nCurrently running macOS Sierra GM on a MBP Retina Early 2013, watchOS 3.0 and iOS 10 GM.\nI've already disabled Two-Step verification and enabled Two-Factor verification for my Apple ID. All devices appear registered on iCloud devices.\nAny ideas of what could be the reason?\n\nA: As mentioned in other answers, the auto unlock feature is officially supported only on Macs that were introduced after mid 2013, and include both Bluetooth 4.0 and 802.11ac. As an owner of a 2012 retina MacBookPro, I was disappointed to find that the feature did't work. \nHowever, it is pretty easy to replace the older Airport chip with a newer one that is used on mid 2013 models (model number of the chip: BCM94360CSAX, can be found on eBay etc for around $10 or so). After replacing the chip, the option for auto unlock appears on the preferences and you should be good to go (for me, required also nvram reset and logout from iCloud). Obviously the operation voids warranty, and some have reported it to cause issues on OS X recovery install over wifi. Still, it seems to be currently the only option for enabling the feature, and as an added bonus you get also the better transfer speeds of an 802.11ac chip.\n\nA: It's not a hardware limitation if you have Bluetooth 4.0, you can see it in apple>About this Mac > System Information > bluetooth > LMP Version\nThey just used the easy way to enable or disable the feature if model greater than 2012 it's enabled otherwise not, despite having the correct hardware.\n\nA: The feature appears to require not only Bluetooth 4 but 802.11ac.  Ostensibly this is because 802.11ac time of flight calculations are used to estimate the distance to the watch.  (EDIT: It's not actually 802.11ac but 802.11v, but you need the newer network card to support 802.11v, see below.)\nI feel for you, as I too cannot get my \"Macbook Pro (Retina, 15-Inch, Early 2013)\" to enable Auto Unlock.  It's kind of frustrating that they state you need a model newer than 2013, when it's really a model newer than \"early 2013.\"\nEDIT:  I agree that requiring AC doesn't seem to make much sense, since the watch itself isn't 802.11ac, but it seems to be true.  Newer official content by Apple now state \"mid-2013\" instead of \"early-2013\" as the cutoff.\nThis blog post describes the process by which upgrading the network card to an 802.11ac card (BCM94360CSAX) enables the feature.  Unfortunately, the complete instructions to upgrade your MBP by Mark Bingley are at a currently-broken link on another blog, though maybe this link will come back in the future.\nOthers have reported success after upgrading the wireless in an early 2013 MBP, and even a 2010 Mac Pro (apparently after installing a new wifi/BT4 card).\nEDIT 2:  Oh, and here's this for a \"link to a reputable site\" site that explains it.  Apparently you need a modern network adapter to get 802.11v support (yes, v), which is used to measure network latency; in this case it is used to measure the lightspeed roundtrip time-of-flight to the Apple Watch to ensure you are within 3 meters for auto unlock.\nNeither the Apple Watch nor the MBP use 802.11ac at all to communicate.  The issue is that older network cards in Mac hardware prior to the mid-2013 MBPs (specifically BCM43xx adapters) do not support the 802.11v timestamp field.  Or so that article states.\n\nA: Ok, so first of all, thanks for all your inputs.\nIt seems like there is no official way to enable Auto Unlock on my MBP.\nAs I can read on the How to upgrade section of Apple macOS page, it says\n\nAs my Mac is an early 2013 model, it seems like is not supported by this feature.\nIn case of any doubts, I've already done the following\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable Two-Factor Authentication on all my iCloud devices\n\n*Installed macOS Sierra on my MBP (clean install)\n\n*Installed iOS 10 on my iPhone 6 Plus (clean install)\n\n*Installed watchOS 3 on my Apple Watch\n\n*All my devices are listed under \"Trusted devices\" on iCloud \n\n*Handoff and Universal clipboard are working between devices.\n\n\nAnyways, I'm looking at Continuity Activation Tool , maybe they can release a newer version that fully supports macOS Sierra and enable it somehow.\n\nA: Had a similar issue. It was really bugging me. Here's what I did to fix it. Assuming your watch is on watch OS 3.0 (required). Try simply rebooting the watch after you've made all of your other setting changes. Totally worked for me. I hadn't rebooted the watch since the update.\n", "Q: Can I hide purchased music from the Music app in iOS 10? At some point or another, I bought some albums on iTunes. In some cases, I've also ripped these CDs and imported them into iTunes. In older versions of iOS, I could hide purchased music from the Music app, but now that purchased music shows up, leading to duplicates like this:\n\nIs there a way to hide purchased music in iOS 10?\n\nA: This Apple Support page describes how to hide/unhide purchased music.\n\nHide your purchases\nYou can hide music, movies, TV shows and apps in iTunes on your Mac or PC. You can hide books in iBooks on a Mac or iTunes for Windows on a PC.\nTo hide purchases on an Apple TV, use the iTunes steps.\nYou can hide apps in the App Store on an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch if you use Family Sharing.\nIn iTunes\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open iTunes.\n  \n*If you’re not signed in, sign in with your Apple ID.\n  \n*From the menu bar at the top of your computer screen or at the top of the iTunes window, choose Account > Purchased. If you use Family Sharing, choose Account > Family Purchases.\n\nIf you’re using Windows and can’t see the menu bar, learn how to turn it on.\n  Depending on what you want to hide, click Music, Movies, TV Shows, Apps, or Audiobooks at the top of the window, then click All. All of your purchased items appear. \n  \n*Scroll to find the item that you want to hide. Hold your pointer over the item and look for the x icon  in the upper-left corner.

The item hides.\n\n\n\nA: I've tried everything...disabling apple music and manually deleting purchased playlist that apple decided to put back on.  Only solution I found is to log out of itunes.\n\nA: any of above ways doesnt work for me. The only solution for me is just sign out your itunes account in you iphone (settings > itunes & app > tap your account then sign out\n\nA: The only thing that works in ios 10 is to log out of itunes store account and match, then use a computer to sync everything. I much preferred being able to log into match, DL the tracks I wanted to hear, then turn match off so the car stereo and other usb devices would only see the downloaded files. This ios version is an absolute calamity for music playout. Ripping cds is actually easier and cheaper than using the store now.  \n\nA: Yes you can, using iTunes (make sure it is the latest 12.5 or newer version) click Library > Songs. Make sure you have the cloud icon column revealed and click View and make sure All Music is checked.\nYou should see all the music available to you for download to your local machine. Click the cloud icon to sort, select all the cloud songs, and delete. This essentially hides them from your view, until you go into Store > Purchased to view your history of songs you've bought in the past.\nWhen you go into Music on your iPhone it should remove all those pesky cloud icon songs\nI found this article, which helped me: https://www.igeeksblog.com/delete-hide-purchased-music-on-iphone-ipad/\n", "Q: Cannot use Dictionary When I Try to use Apple's built in dictionary, I only get Wikipedia:\n\nAs you can see, I have enabled English and Français, But I only get Wikipedia.

Will “Erase All Content and Settings” update my iOS to the latest version? I am currently on iOS 8.4.\n\nA: No, \"Erase All Content and Settings\" will not update your device. Your device will remain on iOS 8.4.\n\nA: Excuse me being late to the party.\nI'm an avid JailBreaker myself, and I am on iOS 8.4 like you. \n8.4 is the highest iOS I believe that's JailBreakable within the 8 Range.\niOS 9 is currently at 9.3.5, which is not JailBreakable.\niOS 10 apparently may have difficulty being JailBroken in the future, JailBreakers say it's a much harder challenge than ever before.\nUsing 'Erase all Content and Settings' on your iPhone will cause the iPhone (if jailbroken) to erase all its contents and settings. Your tweaks, apps, everything. The iPhone will be as if it came fresh from the box.\nHOWEVER. Jailbreaking your iPhone modifies the iOS structure, it adds, changes and deletes files and folders in iOS, and the iPhone's local reset feature isn't aware of this.\nIf you use the 'Erase all Content and Settings' option, your iPhone will either BootLoop, or it will restore correctly.\nIf you're lucky for your iPhone to restore correctly, when you rejailbreak it, Cydia also has a chance to fail installing properly. Thus every time you try to open it, it crashes.\nThere's no current fixes I am aware of when this happens, other than to update / restore your iOS to the latest firmware.

Since there's no swipe to unlock I'd like things to be as similar to the way they are in iOS 9 as is possible.\n\nA: Everything you've described is exactly how it works in iOS 10, with one exception (noted in the third paragraph).\nPressing the home button once goes to the lock screen. Note that if you're using a 6s or later, the Touch ID sensor is so sensitive that pressing the home button with a registered Touch ID finger generally leads to the device going directly to the home screen. This has been the case since the 6s (and iOS 9) came out.\nThe new Raise to Wake feature in iOS 10 allows you to raise the device towards you to turn on the lock screen without pressing any buttons. I've noticed that it will turn the screen back off rather quickly if you don't start interacting with it nearly immediately.\nResting your finger on the home button unlocks the phone. The only change is that instead of going to the home screen, unlocking now stays on the lock screen but provides additional functionality since it's unlocked. You can override it staying on the lock screen by toggling Settings > General > Accessibility > Home Button > Rest for Unlock.\nPressing the home button twice does take you to the passcode screen where you can use Touch ID or enter your passcode. Again, if you use a Touch ID registered finger, it will likely unlock the device by accident, and this has been the case since the iPhone 6s debuted.\n\nA: In settings->general->accessibility-> home button-> toggle \"rest for unlock\"\n", "Q: Unable to add outlook account after updating to ios10 After updating my iPhone to IOS 10 yesterday, I am unable to add an outlook account.\nSo here's what I'm doing:\n\n\n*\n\n*I go to settings->mail->accounts, then tap \"add account\", and select \"outlook\". \n\n*A pop-up appears which loads Microsoft’s login page. I enter my username and password there, and click \"login\".\n\n*The page then asks me for a code from the two-step verification app. I enter that code and press \"confirm\" (or whatever the button is called).\n\n*After that another page appears which says that I am about to grand the following permissions (access to mail, contacts, etc.) to IOS, and asks me to confirm that.\n\n*I press \"Yes\", and then this window simply dissapears, leaving me back at the screen with mail provider selection (the one with \"outlook\", \"exchange\", \"google\", etc on it).\n\n\nThe outlook account is never added to my phone. However if I login to my outlook account from my PC and go to security settings->permissions, I can see that the permission for \"IOS\" has been created properly, it's just that the account is never added to my phone for some reason. Is there a way to fix this somehow?\n\nA: Use Exchange instead of Outlook as mail provider. It offers exactly the same functions, including push notifications. Create a new app password in your Outlook account security settings for login.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with a gmail adress. It was not able to add the account because it was not safari set as the browser used to open link from outlook app\n", "Q: Remove Ad Malware Safari El Capitan I used to have 10.11 yesterday when I saw multiple ads from multiple sites opening when I'm viewing webpages using Safari. I updated to the latest version of the OS, 10.11.6 but it hasn't fixed the issue. I've restarted the OS multiple times. I've tried MalwareBytes as it was suggested in forums. I also tried removing all safari data from Library folders to reset Safari and it still hasn't fixed the issue.\nThe malware redirects websites I visit to offerland.info / bestphoneapps.mobi / mobrevflwms.com and many other sites.\nSolutions would be appreciated.\n\nA: Other malware removers..\nMacScan 3 - [Subscription $50 pa] with free trial. idk whether the free trial will let you actually remove anything it finds. Prime task is to remove bad cookies. I've been using it since v1 & have never 'caught' anything it couldn't kill, though that in itself doesn't prove it will kill everything, only the ones I've seen.\nFor an actual 'antivirus' - rather than me post a list, it would be better to refer you to AV-TEST, which is the closest thing to an actual authority on the subject, or specifically their most recent Mac report . As of their last report, July 2016, they list 4 products with a 100% hit-rate, yet only two which can do that without leaning on your machine & slowing it down, BitDefender & ESET. Neither of those are are free.  \nThey update the report twice a year, so the main link should remain usable in future, as the specific July 2016 report falls out of date.\n", "Q: \"Keep\" function in iMessages iOS 10 What's this \"keep\" function appearing next to each message in the new iOS 10 iMessages app?

Nothing also happens when I try to do this with any other apps.\n\nA: There is a version of El Capitan specifically being kept available for any Mac that needs the stepping stone to Sierra, or that can run El Capitan but not Sierra.\nIt's on the App Store at https://itunes.apple.com/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1147835434?mt=12 \nYou cannot use it to revert from Sierra to El Capitan, for that you need to already have El Capitan in your purchase history.\nAs far as I'm aware, but cannot test, you cannot use it to upgrade to Sierra if your machine could do it without the stepping stone.\n\n", "Q: is an iPhone bought in the US compatible with Germany?

Power/Energywise.\n\n*Do I need extra/different adaptors?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, the service coverage of Apple products is worldwide. Though having AppleCare+ will save you some money because you may only have to pay for shipment of parts, etc. Refer to section 6.2 here.\n\n*Yes, as all Apple products come with standard power adapters and they're compatible anywhere voltage-wise, you may just have to use a universal power adapter in Europe. Otherwise, you can just use the USB to Lightning cable and use your own power adapter there in Germany.\n\n*See answer above.\n\n\nA: I think it is available, as I bought my iPhone in Korea and use it in China.

A postflight script may load launch agents and daemons installed by the pkg installer and set their owners and permissions.\nIn your case you would use a postflight script like this one:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsudo /bin/launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/net.company_name.blocksierra.plist\n\n\nBTW: Using if [[ $Version -ge 11 ]] will unload and delete the launch agent when El Capitan is installed.

I've updated my phone to IOS10, one of the features I quite like is the bedtime app (and no longer needing a 3rd party app). Whilst the features are pretty easy to figure out I can't seem to figure out... how to turn off the Bedtime app alarm if you wake up before it?\nE.g I woke up before the app, left the room, came back and the alarm was going off. Ideally I wanted to stop it before it started.\n\nA: To reiterate you will do the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Swipe up from the bottom of the screen. This will bring up your control center.\n\n*Tap timer.\n\n*Tap the bed time tab.\n\n*Switch off the whole thing by sliding the switch somewhere near the top to off.\n\n\nNote, I'm visually impaired  so I'm depending on what my screen reader says the switches are to slide. If I'm wrong adjust where the switches are on your interface.\n\nA: After setting it up, there is no way to turn it off; you can just edit the time you want to wake up and the hours you want to sleep. You can, however, turn off the wake alarm.\n", "Q: Do Mac disks need to be defragmented? I cannot find any defragmenting application on the Mac, so is defragmenting disks for Mac necessary?\n\nA: If you are defragging Mac hard drive just to increase its performance, then you can resolve these issues very efficiently by the help of below mentioned free tips: -\n1.Quit all the open apps to free up some memory. Many times, they become the primary cause of system slowdowns. \n2.Reboot your Mac system. It will clear all the caches, free up memory and also allows the user to install any necessary core updates\n3.Updates your Mac OS X to the latest version to perform better than the previous version and updating OS X will fix certain bugs\n4.Try to make sure that you have at least of 10-15 % of your total hard drive is available at that time to adequate proper cache and other temp files\n5.You also need to check for a failing drive using the help of Disk Utility. If the drive is failing and won’t repair, then you need to fix it using the help of proper methods like the one mentioned here.\nOlder version of OS X needs to be defragged, if necessary. You may consider one such application mentioned here. However, Mac OS Yosemite and its later version don’t need defragmentation.\n\nA: The general argument is you don't need to defrag.\nSSDs certainly not, HDs not really, but you can if you like.\nThere are arguments for defragging periodically on a drive that is around 30 - 70% full.\nI used to use iDefrag on my boot drive, once after each OS update. It claimed to be the only app that correctly preserved the 'hot zone'. The perceived difference was minor, but I felt worth the effort. Since I moved to SSDs I haven't even launched it.\nI don't think I've ever bothered defragging a non-boot drive.\nThere's a well-reasoned argument on the Apple forums at 'can you or should you defrag your mac' though I think with modern high capacity drives, it becomes even less necessary.\n", "Q: iPad Air 2 not turning on My iPad Air 2 was working fine until yesterday. Then I turned it off for a while, and when I returned, I plugged my headphones in and typed in my passcode to go to the homescreen. However, the iPad froze before the homescreen loaded, so I switched off the iPad to restart it. Since I turned it off, I have been unable to get it to turn on again (the screen is black). I plugged it in and it made the \"I'm charging\" ding but the screen didn't turn on to show my lock screen. I clicked the on sleep/wake button and home button a few times but nothing happened. It was fully charged before this happened. What can I do to turn on my iPad again?\n\nA: My own iPad Air shut off by itself last month (with the charge reading at 80%) and wouldn't turn on, even when I plugged it in. After 30 minutes of it being plugged in, the screen was still black. However, I left the iPad charging for about an hour and finally the screen came back on.\nTry charging it for an hour, and plugging it into iTunes to see if you get a response from it.\n", "Q: OSX tags from terminal/console Is it possible to create some script to show all the finder-tagged items in terminal/shell? \nI'd like to create something like this:\nls-tag \"Music\" to display all the items of Music tag\n\nA: No script is needed to accomplish that.

I am 11 years old, and I have made an app I want to post to the App Store. Is there any way to do that, or do I have to use my mom's account? (I have an Apple id because of Family Sharing)\n\nA: The Apple discussions thread can i be an apple developer under 18? is exactly what your are looking for :\n\nNo. An adult would have to do that for you. To have a developer\n  account you must be 18 or older.\n\n…\n\nYou can always start a corporation and the individual age restriction\n  is not relevant anymore.\n\n\nA: Yes and no.\nStrictly speaking you need to register as a developer and to do that as an individual you need to meet minimum age requirements. Typically this is 18, although it could be different in various countries.\nAlso, depending on your jurisdiction, there may be other requirements you must meet before being able to register as a developer.\nIn your case, you could have a parent register and then use their developer account. When uploading an app you need to complete a number of metadata fields, one of which is who the app is copyrighted to. So you could still put your name in that field.\nAnother option is to set up a company (or something similar) in which case there wouldn't be the age restriction. However, depending on your jurisdiction there could be an age requirement for registration of a company.\nA good place to start (if you haven't already) is to explore https://developer.apple.com for answers to your questions.\n", "Q: Is there a way to automatically change my keyboard language when I switch between windows on macOS?

However, you can change it to something other then what I made it.\nThat said though, the output for the visibleWindows is just a string of numbers representing the concatenated id's, as that's how it's written to output.

Swarm, Yelp, etc., appear similarly.\nThe built-in #images and Music iMessage apps work correctly, as do simple sticker packs.\nI've tried power-cycling my phone with no effect. I've also tried disabling and re-enabling the apps in \"Manage\" with no effect. Does anyone know what causes this behavior?\n\n\nA: Had the same issue.

Hope that helps!\n", "Q: Music ratings on iOS 10 I used to be able to change the rating of a music track on my phone, and they would get downloaded to iTunes when I synched my phone to my MacBook.\nThey seemed to have changed this in the new iOS, and there's only the heart button, but nothing else.\nHow I set the rating stars 0 to 5 with the iOS 10 update?\n\nA: Apple removed the ability to rate songs with stars in iOS 10.  You can now only use Like (heart) or dislike (no heart).  \nYou can, however, use Siri to rate a song while it's playing.  You can tell Siri to rate a song from 0 to 5 stars.  Of course, that pauses the song playback to it's not an ideal solution.\n\nA: The ability to rate songs has been added to iOS 10.2.\nAnother great option, and I'm quite critical of missing UI features like this, is to use a widget (previously mentioned but not linked) called Music Rating Widget. You can view the currently playing song's rating, change it, skip to the next song, and pause from the widget window.\nAlso, Cesium Music Player is a complete Music app replacement that does both song ratings within the app and includes a widget for rating as well. I'm particularly fond of this one because it has many other features that the default Music app is missing. (horizontal/landscape mode, view song meta data like year released, in addition to being able to easily view and set song ratings)\n\nA: The rating option has returned to iOS 10.2, but the other answer that explains this doesn't describe how to get to it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to iOS Settings > Music > Turn on \"Show Star Ratings\"\n\n*Go to the Music app, play a song you wish to rate\n\n*Tap the light grey playing song bar at the bottom of the app (with the pause and FF symbol)\n\n*Tap the ellipsis at the bottom right\n\n*Tap \"Rate Song\"\n\n*Rate it\n\n\nA: I had the same problem.\nI have bought (very cheap) and installed \"Music Rating Widget\", from the AppStore, which allows you to rate from the notification center while playing.\n\nA: Update (for iOS 10.3+)\nSince iOS 10.3 star ratings can be enabled as follows:\nSettings > Music > Show Star Ratings (enable)\n-\nImportant: Apple Music songs can not be rated with stars. It works only for music that\n\n*\n\n*was added manually to iTunes (MP3s, M4A, AAC)\n\n\n*is available in your iTunes Match library and/or\n\n\n*was bought in the iTunes Music Store (iTMS)\n\nShow/change an active song's rating:\n\n*\n\n*Open Music.app\n\n*Show the currently playing song. You may need to tap the Mini Player near the bottom.\n\n*Tap the ellipsis (...) in the lower right.\n\n*The song popover appears. Find \"Rate Song...\". It's located below \"Share Song\" or \"Create Station\".\n\n*Tap \"Rate Song...\"\n\n*In the new popover change the star rating.\n\n*Confirm your changes by tapping \"Done\".\n\n\nShow/change a song's rating in a list view (iPhone 6s/6s Plus/7/7 Plus or newer):\n\n*\n\n*Open Music.app\n\n*In any standard list (playlist, album view) force press on a song\n\n*The song popover appears.

You cannot see a rating, however.\n\n*Please send a feedback to Apple. Please, do it. Apple actually reads feedback.\n\nFeel free to use my text:\n.\nSubject:\n\nMusic.app: display/set song rating with stars is missing\n\nFeedback Type:\n\nBug Report\n\nComments:\n\nDear iOS team,\nplease bring back the Music.app feature to see and set star ratings for songs.\nSince installing iOS 10 I cannot see or set my song ratings for my music with stars (0-5 stars). I used this feature very often until now.\nWith Siri I can only set a rating, but I'm not able to see it. However, this does not work when I'm offline.\nIs there another way to see/set a song's star rating in iOS 10?\nThank you\n\n\nA: So, this is a huge issue for me, however, i found a way around it (for a price). Download Cesium out of the app store and it restores the old look and feel of the music app without the Apple \"bloat\". It looks JUST like the old one, so there shouldn't be anything new or surprising with it. Just a simple replacement. I think it's like $1.99. Good luck!\n\nA: I found an acceptable method for rating songs with iOS 10 :\nThe app \"Music Rating Widget\" let's you rate songs either from app interface and the notification center. The rating is fluid and even easier than in iOS 9. The only inconvenient is that there is no seeking bar to advance through the song (useful for batch rating).\nOf course the ratings are written into the songs and are found in iTunes when the phone is synched.\nThe app is paid but as it's only 0,99 euros, it's very affordable.\nThis method i's for now satisfactory, but I guess there will more and more apps in the near future. I also asked the developer to improve the app by adding the seeking bar.\nHope this will be fixed.\n", "Q: Apps won't download I have a brand new iPhone SE, literally opened it two days ago, and for some reason my apps won't download or update? I do not have any paused downloads, and I made sure my iTunes works without internet, and I really do NOT want to restore my iPhone to factory settings, what should I do?\n\nA: I assume you already tried restarting your iPhone and it didn't work. Go to Settings -> Itunes & App Store -> tap on your Apple ID and then tap \"Sign Out\". Reboot your iPhone and then open the App Store. Try to download an app. It should ask your Apple ID now, so enter it and you should be good to go!\n", "Q: iOS10 restrict \"Look Up\" feature to dictionary alone I have just upgraded to iOS10 and found that the \"Define\" feature (that appears after selecting a word) has been replaced with \"Look Up\", which now\npulls the suggestions from various sources on internet besides the local dictionary.\nIs there a way to restrict this \"Look Up\" feature to search in local dictionaries alone? I couldn't find any solutions on the internet as of today (14th Sep16).\n\nA: The instructions are in the \"About Lookup & Privacy\" that you read before using it for the first time...

In WatchOS 3, there is an AirPlay button at the very bottom of the control center.\n\nWhen I press it, the only option I see is Apple Watch.\n\nBut on my iPhone, I'm playing audio from SoundCloud. I'm there able to assign the audio playback to AirPlay devices:\n\nAs noted in the image, I'm not using a real AirPlay device but a virtual one, via Airfoil playing on my Mac. But it should still behave like a real AirPlay device.\nSo, is this new button in the WatchOS 3 control center just for \"AirPods\" and the like?\n\nA: On the Apple Watch, go to the Settings app, go to Bluetooth, and pair each of the devices you want to use.\nThe Apple Watch is connecting directly to the device by Bluetooth, not using your iPhone's connection.\n", "Q: Change order of iMessage Apps? I'm using iOS 10. Is there a way to rearrange the order of iMessage apps as they appear when you tap the App Store icon in Messages? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Rearranging the apps in the grid doesn't affect the order that they show up when you're swiping side to side between iMessage apps. My guess is that Apple expected people to largely use the app draw to select the iMessage apps they want to use, with the horizontal scrolling view functioning more like the app switcher for the phone, with the most recently used app appearing first.\nSo the horizontal order is based in the order in which you've opened the iMessage apps from the app draw - with the most recent at the left and oldest at the right. To get the order you want in the horizontal scrolling view, first open the app draw. Select the one you want at the right hand side. Then reopen the app draw and select the one you want to the left of that, and repeat, ending with the app you want at the left hand side of the iMessage apps.  \nSo to get the below order mapped over to the horizontal view I'd open the app draw and select '#images.' Then reopen the app draw and select 'grammarsnob,' reopen and select 'giphy,' reopen and select 'Alto's Adventure.'  \n \nIt's not very intuitive, but I guess they're going for Snapchat levels of UI confusion.\n", "Q: What is a semi-untethered jailbreak? I've read about a semi-untethered jailbreak by Pangu. What does semi-tethered mean? What are the differences between that and a normal jailbreak?\nI have an iPhone 5 on iOS 7.0.6, and before to try upgrade to 9.3.5, I would like more information.\n\nA: The semi-untethered Pangu jailbreak only works on iOS 9.2 to 9.3.3, and no, you cannot upgrade specifically to iOS 9.3.3.\nBut, to answer your question about what a semi-untethered jailbreak means, taken from the Jailbreak Subreddit,\n\nAfter rebooting your device, your tweaks will not function and your device will appear to not be jailbroken. To fix this, open the Pangu app, lock your phone and wait for it to [refresh].\n\nA normal jailbreak as we know it is called an untethered jailbreak. Back in the day, there were also tethered jailbreaks. Tethered meant that every time you rebooted your iOS device, you were required to re-jailbreak with a computer (or else your device wouldn't even boot!). Untethered meant that the device can jailbreak itself automatically every time during the boot process. Semi-untethered is a mix between the two - it needs to be jailbroken every time you reboot, but it can be done by an app on the device instead of needing to do it with a computer.\n", "Q: deleted photos still take up storage I have deleted all my pics including from recently deleted and i have 45GB in icloud but still my photos are taking up a lot of space even though there is nothing in the photo album. Please help urgent issue!!\n\nA: I had this problem for a long time with my 16gb iPhone. After a lot of looking I discovered iExplore and this tip:\nhttp://iexplorer-support.macroplant.com/customer/portal/articles/1325738-how-to-delete-all-photos-from-an-iphone-or-ipad\nEssentially, Photos caches lots of files and due iOS bugs, the caches don't always get cleared up.\nI used the solution on the above page and cleared up 2GB of space.\n\nA: I have resolved my problem using iExplorer (mentioned by @billyork23). In my case, it is the thumbnail data of old photos. You can locate it under:\nMedia/PhotoData/Thumbnails\nand delete all .ithumb files. It saves me 1.5GB.\nP.S. The iExplorer does not require jailbreak or anything.\n\nA: I am no expert but theres a few things to consider. first doing a reboot might help. second its possible a app have alot of photos for the graphics of the app. also when you delete a file (i.e. pictures) it just marks it as free space and its possible something isnt considering it as free space. i might be wrong i am not completely sure.\n\nA: I would suggest using the google photos app, as you will have unlimited storage if you were to use the \"High Quality\" Image choice. And then the app will ask you if you would like to free up device storage, and accept. That, personally is the best option for me. \n", "Q: How can I sync the new \"people\" (face recognition) metadata across devices in Photos (iOS 10 and MacOS Sierra)? The new Photos updates for iOS 10 and MacOS Sierra includes a much more powerful and integrated approach to organizing photos by who's in them.  It's built around powerful, on-device facial recognition.\nBut once it does its automated thing (finding the faces it thinks are the same person), there's still a lot of manual merging and labeling to be done if you have a lot of photos and are as obsessive about organization as I am.\nFor example, if you have, say... three thousand photos of your daughter, Photos will find almost all of them, but may guess they're 5 or 6 different people.  So you have to merge the buckets that all are one person, assign them a name (so you can search by it), etc.\nBut unlike other changes (edits, deletions, organization into albums, etc.), manual changes to \"people\" data don't seem to sync at all by default.  \n\nIs there really no way to do this?  It seems bizarre that one of the flagship features Apple's touting in this Photos update doesn't play at all with what was Photos primary selling point over iPhoto - everything synced on all your devices.\n\nA: Photos People syncing was added in macOS 10.13 High Sierra in 2017.\n\nNote: If you use iCloud Photos, the people identified in your photos are synced across your devices.\n\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/photos/phtad9d981ab/3.0/mac/10.13\n\nA: Patience. It may sync in a future update, a goof in the current iOS 10 user guide gives us a hope it will:\n“People are synced among devices where you’re signed in with the same Apple ID.”\nExcerpt From: Apple Inc. “iPad User Guide for iOS 10.” Apple Inc., 2016. iBooks. \nThis material may be protected by copyright.\nCheck out this book on the iBooks Store: https://itun.es/us/Cf0Odb.l\n\nA: Before High Sierra release (and the corresponding iOS annual release) this metadata did not sync. Now that data does sync.\nMacworld speculates on the reason behind it:\n\nIt’s not clear yet whether [facial recognition data will ever sync] because Apple’s push at its recent [2016] Worldwide Developers Conference was for local analysis of private information that’s never uploaded to the cloud.\n\nI haven't watched it myself, but apparently Phil Schiller and Craig Federighi stated on John Gruber's The Talk Show that it will not happen, that the features are device-specific and will not be synced via iCloud.\nEdit: The help file for Photos in macOS Sierra was updated with this:\n\nNote: People identified in the People album are not synced across devices.\n\n\nA: You can sync Albums (groups of photos) but you cannot sync Faces (groups of photos)? It would be enough if the analysis ran locally, and then grouping the photos on all devices. After all, the smart album is just a list of photos that (either analysis or user claim to) contain a specific person, and not that different from a syncable album\n", "Q: Is it normal to have the home directory under git?

DiskUtility's Repair temporarily fixes it, but why? I have an external 5 TB USB drive (HFS extended) which contains one encrypted disk image (HFS extended) of an equal size (practically 5 TB). All the external disk's work files are inside the encrypted disk image.\nOver time the available free space naturally shrunk and shrunk; and recently I did a bit of a clean up.\nSome folders had accumulated ridiculous amounts of files so I decided to use terminal (instead of Finder) for the task, ie. files were removed with rm.\nMoreover, I noticed some backup folders had (partially) duplicated content. I knew the filenames were unique, so I created a catch-all folder and moved all suspected duplicates to it (namely, with mv via terminal—probably not the best option in hindsight) effectively killing the duplicate files.\nNow I'm sure I have plenty of free space available, but Finder doesn't seem to know it nor remember it.\nAfter every remount, Finder, Disk Utility app and df report the space usage as follows (disk2s2 is the regular volume, and disk3s2 is the encrypted one):\n$ df -h\nFilesystem                                 Size   Used  Avail Capacity   iused   ifree %iused  Mounted on\n/dev/disk2s2                              4.5Ti  4.5Ti  317Mi   100% 610375939   40592  100%   /Volumes/Snake\n/dev/disk3s2                              4.5Ti  4.5Ti  285Mi   100% 610178600   36496  100%   /Volumes/87\n\nWhich is to say I have 285 MB free space ≈pretty much what I had before clean up.\nNow—if I run \"Repair\" in Apple's Disk Utility app (on the encrypted disk image, ie. disk3s2), I get no errors, but free space is updated (and presumably corrected):\n$ df -h\nFilesystem                                 Size   Used  Avail Capacity   iused    ifree %iused  Mounted on\n/dev/disk2s2                              4.5Ti  4.5Ti  317Mi   100% 610375920    40611  100%   /Volumes/Snake\n/dev/disk3s2                              4.5Ti  4.2Ti  316Gi    94% 568746945 41468151   93%   /Volumes/87\n\nie. 316 GB available and no effects on disk2s2.

(The Gi or Ti refers to gibibytes and tebibytes, base 2 units for a billion and trillion bytes instead of the base 10 gigabytes and terabytes.)\n\nIf these don’t agree, it’s likely a Spotlight error. Apple relies on Spotlight to mark and calculate remaining storage. You can delete the Spotlight index and rebuild it by following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Spotlight preference pane.\n\n*Click the Privacy tab.\n\n*Drag the startup volume into the Privacy window.\n\n*Click OK at the warning, and the Spotlight index is deleted.\n\n*Select your startup volume in the privacy list, and click the - (minus) button.\n\n\nThat restarts indexing. This should reset your storage.\n", "Q: Sync Apple notes app on MacBook to Android I recently got an Android phone, and I wanted to know how to sync Apple Notes to Google Keep. I have added my Gmail account to the Apple Notes app, but I don't see the notes showing up in Google Keep. What do I do?\n\nA: Synchronizing Apple Notes to Gmail puts the notes under a Notes section within Gmail itself.\nGoogle Keep has a synchronization feature, but it's only accessible from Google Keep apps on other platforms and cannot sync with or import from any non-Keep apps. Several years ago, Google stated they were going to be introducing sync to Google Drive within a few weeks, but that never materialized. (The only available interaction with Google Drive is to export a note to Drive as a document, but the reverse is not possible.)\nYour options are to continue to use Apple Notes and interact with them in Gmail, or to use the Google Keep web app or a relatively poorly-reviewed Chrome app.\n", "Q: Setting up automatic red / green notifications for continuous testing and TDD? Note: this was originally posted under stackoverflow, and someone sensibly downvoted it since it's really OS X specific.  So I'm reposting it over here, since it's been generally helpful.\nI like doing Test Driven Development (TDD), and so I would like a way for my test suite to run whenever I make a change to a source file or test file.\nIn addition, I'd like the results of the test to display in an ephemeral \"Growl\" style window in the corner of my screen, showing a green icon if all tests passed and a red icon if one or more tests fail.\nI know there is such a mechanism for node.js in mocha, and for ruby environments there's guard-rspec. But how do I create one for my [fill in the blank] testing environment under OS X?\n\nA: Under OS X, you can create a simple solution using two off-the-shelf utilities: fswatch and terminal-notifier and three simple bash scripts.  Here's how:\ndownload fswatch and terminal-notifier\n$ brew install fswatch\n$ brew install terminal-notifier\n\nset up project directories\nMy project directories are laid out as follows, but of course you can choose alternate strategies:\n$PROJECT_ROOT/\n  logs/\n  lib/\n  scripts/\n    icons/\n  tests/\n\ncreate three bash scripts\nfile: scripts/run-tests\nThis is a simple script that invokes your framework's tests.  In this case we're running python's unittest, but you can customize it to suit your needs:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Run unit tests over the test directory\n\nPROJECT_ROOT=$( cd \"$( dirname \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\" )/..\" && pwd )\n\nPYTHON=python                                                           # customize for your needs\nexport PYTHONPATH=\"$PROJECT_ROOT/lib\"                                   # customize for your needs\n${PYTHON} -m unittest discover --start-directory \"$PROJECT_ROOT/tests\"  # customize for your needs\n\nfile: scripts/growl-tests\nThis script invokes run-tests and captures stdout and stderr in log files.  It then displays a growl-like message based on the results of run-tests. You must customize this script to parse the results of run-tests and decide whether to display a red or green icon.  The example shown here parses the output of Python's unittest.  If you use a different system, you'll need to make appropriate changes to the script.\n#!/bin/bash\n# Run tests and display results in a \"growl\"-like window.\n\nPROJECT_ROOT=$( cd \"$( dirname \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\" )/..\" && pwd )\nTEST_RUNNER=\"$PROJECT_ROOT/scripts/run-tests\"\nSTDOUT_LOG=\"$PROJECT_ROOT/logs/unittest_stdout.log\"\nSTDERR_LOG=\"$PROJECT_ROOT/logs/unittest_stderr.log\"\n\n# Run the tests, copy stdout and stderr to STDOUT_LOG and STDERR_LOG\n# respectively\n$TEST_RUNNER > >(tee \"$STDOUT_LOG\") 2> >(tee \"$STDERR_LOG\" >&2)\n\n# Capture the exit status of TEST_RUNNER.  We will use this for the\n# red / green distinction in our Growl display.\nTEST_STATUS=$?\n\n# The following lines are specific to the Python `unittest` output,\n# and aren't required for the red / green display.  We extract a few\n# extra bits of info so the Growl window can display something like:\n#     Ran 452 tests in 8.300s\n#     FAILED (failures=3)\n\n# extract \"Ran n tests in n.nnns\"\nTEST_SUMMARY=`tail -3 \"$STDERR_LOG\" | head -1`\n\n# extract \"OK\" or \"FAILED (failures=n)\"\nTEST_RESULT=`tail -1 \"$STDERR_LOG\"`\n\n# Compose the two strings to make the entire message\nGROWL_MESSAGE=\"$TEST_SUMMARY\n$TEST_RESULT\"\n\n# Pick a sound and an icon based on TEST_STATUS\nif [ $TEST_STATUS -eq 0 ] ; then\n    GROWL_SOUND=\"Submarine\"\n    GROWL_ICON=\"$PROJECT_ROOT/scripts/icons/GreenBead.png\"\nelse\n    GROWL_SOUND=\"Purr\"\n    GROWL_ICON=\"$PROJECT_ROOT/scripts/icons/RedBead.png\"\nfi\n\n# Now display the results in a Growl-like window\necho \"$GROWL_MESSAGE\" | terminal-notifier -sound $GROWL_SOUND -contentImage $GROWL_ICON\n\nfile: scripts/autorun-tests\nThis script invokes growl-tests once at startup, and then again whenever some file is modified.  Under most circumstances, this file may be used verbatim without any modification.  \n#!/bin/bash\n# Run tests automatically whenever files change in the PROJECT_ROOT\n\nPROJECT_ROOT=$( cd \"$( dirname \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\" )/..\" && pwd )\nTEST_RUNNER=\"$PROJECT_ROOT/scripts/growl-tests\"\n\n# run tests once at startup\n\"$TEST_RUNNER\"\n\n# Run tests whenever anything under PROJECT_ROOT changes\n# Note that we explicitly exclude the log files, since they get\n# written as a result of running the tests.

I do this for every major iOS version update and I've never had any issues before.\nMy problem is that during the setup process after updating to iOS 10, I select to restore the phone with an iCloud backup, but the restore process fails every time with a \"Cannot restore backup\" error.\nI've read everything I could find in Apple Support regarding iCloud restore and iOS 10 upgrading and no article mentions this issue.\nIs this a bug with iCloud? Is there any other way I can restore my apps to my iPhone from that backup?\nEDIT:\nTalked to Apple Support, one of the solutions they gave me was to put the device in recovery mode, then restore again to iOS 10 and then attempt to restore de backup. Didn't work for me but maybe it helps someone.\nEDIT 2:\nI just spoke with Apple Support again and they told me that the backups are safe and not corrupt. They also told me that a lot of users are starting to have this problem and they don't have a solution yet.\n\nA: If the backup is corrupt, you'll be out of luck.\nIf it's just that Apple's servers are swamped right now, after the iOS 10 launch, then you may have better luck tomorrow or the day after.\nIt seems time to trot out the old adage...\n\"Any data not stored in at least three distinct locations ought to be considered temporary.\"\nEven though you got away with it 9 times out of 10, there's always a 10th time.\nSomebody gets bricked with every update; make sure it's never going to be you.\nBackups are those useless things that take up valuable storage space & are totally pointless...\n...until the day you need them.\nYou really should also have had a local iTunes backup, encrypted to preserve passwords etc, & that backed up to Time machine.\nOptional off-site copy too - Backblaze etc -  in case the building burns down.\nThe smartest way to do any update.\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch iTunes, plug in device.\nWhen asked if you want to update click Download Only.\n\n*Whilst that's busy, switch to the Apps view in iTunes - download all available updates.\n\n*When complete, switch to your device view & Sync.\n\n*Back Up Now [with encryption, which preserves your passwords]\nYou now have fully up to date retrievable restore point, should anything go wrong.\n\n\n*Once the iOS download is completed, then you can Update.\n\n\nA: Ok so here's what I did to solve my problem.\nAfter calling Apple Support, they told me that the backups are fine as I said in my edit. The thing is, they don't know when they are going to fix this issue and my phone was unusable so I had to find a way to restore it.\nWhat I did was first downgrade to the latest version of iOS 9 (9.3.5) which was the version I last backed up with. As iOS 10 was just released, Apple is still allowing iOS 9 restores, but this wont last forever. I did this by downloading the IPSW of that iOS version and then restoring it into my iPhone with iTunes, then the iCloud restore completed successfully. After that I backed up my phone using iTunes, because this problem only happens in iOS 10 when you are restoring from an iCloud backup and not a local one. Then I just updated my phone again to iOS 10 and did a restore using my local backup and everything worked great.\nThis may not be the easiest solution for everyone, but it's a good workaround for the currently buggy iOS 10 iCloud restore.\n", "Q: How to deal with non-working key on the keyboard? I've problem with my Macbook Pro (with El Captain installed on it) where one of the keys (such as r) doesn't work at all, so each time when I'm typing a word with \"r\", I've to keep pasting it from the system clipboard. It's very inconvenient.\nI'm planning to see Genius Bar, but since then, I'd like to find a better way to deal with such problem.\nI've also consider external keyboard, but it's another inconvenience, where you have to carry it physically with you.\nIs there any way of rebinding a keyboard key into another one (like r into §)? Or do can you suggest something better?\n\nA: As suggested in the comments and in this post, using Karabiner app should work with the following configuration of private.xml file (edit in Misc tab):\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <item>\n    <name>Use § to type R</name>\n    <identifier>private.replace_r_key</identifier>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::DANISH_DOLLAR, KeyCode::R</autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\nand enable newly created item after reloading the file in Change Key tab.\nTo find out the right key code, use EventViewer in Misc tab.\n", "Q: How can I set up DNS for Bonjour and AirPrint to advertise printers across subnets Several printers do not stay connected to clients--even though everything has static ip addresses--and they are not searchable across networks i.e. they do not appear with Bonjour.\nIdeally I would like to setup DNS so that in all of my networks, printers could just be added with Bonjour, and then as well, the settings would continue to work the next day, assuming the IP addresses, etc. did not change.  \nApple says very clearly at the top, here to \"use DNS to print across networks,\" but unfortunately does not explain how to do this!  I suspect that gesture was aimed at converging Windows users.\nAll the resources I find online, seem quite old--for example, here is information that was really exciting, and from Apple, all 3 printers are listed here--but in the OSX Server interface, or the latest OSX, there is not even a way to add many of the services people describe.\nTo be specific; these are all HP Printers, which support Airprint, and the server is running Yosemite with 5.0.1 (the same problem existed on server 4 as well), with the clients either on Yosemite or 10.11.\nThe firewall settings for layer 2, 3, and 7 are all correct and not interfering with this, as far as I know (have experimented, with it off).  Also I have experimented with enabling and disabling IPv6.\n\nA: I have solved this problem by allowing a selected group of the guests to be on the same LAN as the printers; however blocking them significantly with firewalls so that only the printers and a few other machines needed, can be reached from that specific wi-fi network.\nIf you see that I have provided this answer to my own question;  I'd still love to hear how to configure DNS for Bonjour in the current versions of OSX and Server, and otherwise forward Airprint or other protocols as examples.\n\nA: You need to study and research an internet standard (described in RFC-6763) called \"DNS Service Discovery\", short: DNS-SD.\nAll further info you need for that is hosted on DNS-SD.org and on ZeroConf.org.\nThere, have a look at \"How to set up Wide-Area AirPrint\". Draw your conclusions about how to achieve the same with AirPlay.

Does anyone know which plist in the system, etc, that is actually referencing? because it does not work for me, and home drives do not auto-mount.\nWhen you click \"add network home\"  it adds text like {{{home drive}}} into the list of mount points (it looks exactly like that, but with less than and greater than signs instead of curved-brackets).\nThis specific question is regarding a small network where upon login, users get several mount points authenticated, and one not authenticated (they were originally set up using .mobilconfig files generated in profile manager, and previously in Workgroup Manager).\nI've limited this question now to focus on the \"home drives,\" because I believe so far, that overlapping device & user-group profiles were causing some of these problems, but I've removed these, and now, the OSX User/Networked home drives still do not auto-mount.\nAs a nice reference for the 2 steps involved in setting this up, see the question and answer on  this Server Fault forums post.  I should also add that mounting doesn't seem consitant at all, and sometimes other mount points don't come up, but this seems to related possibly to other factors.\nUsers login, most of the time they get these SMB shares, which via the config profiles are allowed to show up on the desktop (Finder settings), as well as get auto-mounted in Users & Groups.  The problem is that they just don't show up sometimes!  The Server logs are fairly clean, dnslookup is fine, the Server names all match the fqdn so the usual LDAP-related issues are in check.\nOSX server is running on a Mac Mini running Yosemite with Server v. 5.0.1 (the same problem existed on server 4 as well), with the clients mostly on El Capitain, although I've seen this also in a mixed enviornment.  This occurs in only about 20% of User accounts, with no pattern in the directory service information that I can see.\n\nA: I'm beginning to form my own answers on this, but the full understanding will take a lot of research and log review, so please edit, post other answers, and/or comments here!\nIn an older guide for OSX Server, I've read these comments, but surely rather than being required to allow guest access to those shares, a local account on the Server can mount them, or maybe that information is from before the authenticated-mounting made its way to OSX:\n\nBe sure to enable guest access both for the share point and for the\n  protocol under which it is shared.\nNote: Automounted share points are available to clients only when their computers start up.\n\nOne element of this problem can be explained by reading over the Open LDAP documentation, which Apple's Open Directory is based on.  I have seen from time to time, at least once of the messages they describe, in the Open Directory logs.\nDeep within OSX there may be inconsistencies of BerkleyDB versions, which for the simple-end-user in a perfect world could be resolved between the ideal combination of versions of OSX on the client, OSX (on the server), and Server.app or other changeable componts, also on the server.\nfrom the link: \n\nC.2.9. ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Can't contact LDAP server (-1)\nUsing SASL, when a client contacts LDAP server, the slapd service dies\n  immediately and client gets an error :\n SASL/GSSAPI authentication started ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Can't contact LDAP server (-1) Then check the slapd service, it stopped.\n\nThis may come from incompatible of using different versions of\n  BerkeleyDB for installing of SASL and installing of OpenLDAP.

Go to Settings > AirPlay > Security and choose the setting that's right for you:\nTo give access only to users in the same room as your Apple TV, choose Passcode or Onscreen Code. Each time someone with an AirPlay enabled device tries to connect to your Apple TV, their device asks for the passcode shown on your TV.\nTo give access only to users who have your password, choose Password.

I read that the AT&T version of the iPhone 7 does not support CDMA.\nI am trying to understand what that means for me if I upgrade.  I get that it means that I will not be able to switch to Verizon and keep using my same iPhone.\nBut I don't know if it means that I will have other issues while using my iPhone 7.\nFor example, as I understand it, if I go to a place where AT&T has poor coverage, then my phone roams and gets coverage from other carriers.  (At least this is how it used to be.)\nDo I lose this ability if I get an AT&T iPhone 7?  Are there any other drawbacks to the intel chip in the iPhone 7?\n\nA: CDMA is primarily used in the US. Nearly everywhere else uses GSM. If you are an AT&T customer, you will not roam onto a CDMA network. AT&T sells GSM phones, so their roaming partners would naturally by-and-large need to be GSM carriers as well.\nWikipedia has a list of carriers around the world with active CDMA networks and it's extremely short.

It's really not needed.\n\nA: WhatsApp is using the new CallKit VOIP framework that allows apps such as WhatsApp and Skype to integrate more directly with iOS. This allows, for example, incoming calls to show up on the lock screen like cell phone calls do. As you've discovered it can also integrate with the native Phone app's call history (\"recents\"), contacts and so forth.\nThere is no setting to disable this as it is a fundamental change to how iOS handles VOIP apps.\n", "Q: Xcode free space requirement I am trying to update Xcode to 8.0.

Ideally, I'd like the ability to email a \"link\" that, when clicked, would automatically open the directory in Finder.\nAgain, this method must be compatible with special characters, and should be easy to explain to less technically savvy users.\n\nA: In recent (Mojave 10.14 - Catalina 10.15) versions of macOS Finder, you can easily get a copy of any of the path variants:\nEdit->Copy the good old ⌘-C becomes just the filename when pasted as text:\nfile.ext\n\nEdit->Copy as Pathname with added option (⌥⌘-C) becomes: \n/Volume/Share on some server/file.ext\n\nEdit->Copy as Link with added control & option ^⌥⌘-C becomes exactly what the question asked for in this case:\nsmb://someserver/Share%20on%20some%20server/file.ext\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Right-click the file or folder in Finder > Services > Copy full path\n\n*Paste the path into the email (I used Apple Mail)\n\n*The recipient just has to choose the whole path in the email and right-click it > Reveal in Finder\n\n\nYou don't have to escape spaces in the path with backslashes! The share has to be mounted already.\n\nIf you don't find a service like \"Copy Path\" or \"Copy full Path\" you can simply create it yourself:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator\n\n*Create a new service\n\n*Search for “Copy to Clipboard” and drag that into the rightside panel of the Service\n\n*Set ‘Service receives selected’ to “files or folders” and ‘in’ to “Finder” at the top of the service.\n\n*Save the service as \"Copy Path\"\n\n*Depending on your system you can copy the path either by right-clicking an item > Copy Path or Services > Copy Path.\n\n\nA: If you're on Mojave, they've changed the default so now command-option-C on a file copies the smb path with the URL rather than the /Volumes/ path.\n\nA: I created an Automator workflow that gets the full path to file or folder. It replaces the (/Volumes/mountName) with the actual server address and encodes the path as URL. (Meaning you can send this to a colleague who might not have the server mounted or mounted differently):\nMOUNTCHECK=$(echo \"$1\" | cut -d \"/\" -f2)\nif [[ \"$MOUNTCHECK\" == *\"Volumes\"* ]]; then\n  MOUNT_NAME=$(echo \"$1\" | cut -d \"/\" -f3)\n  FILE_PATH=$(echo \"$1\" | cut -d \"/\" -f 4-)\n  MOUNT_INFO=$(mount | grep \"$MOUNT_NAME\")\n  MOUNT_USER=\"${MOUNT_INFO/\\/\\/${USER}@/}\"\n  SERVER=$(echo $MOUNT_USER | awk '$0=$1')/\n  echo $SERVER$FILE_PATH\nelse\n  echo `echo $1 | perl -pe 's/File//g'`\nfi\n\nDownload the Automator workflow.\n\nA: My go to tool for this is a Finder extension available on the Mac App Store:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pathsnagger-2/id722364475\nIt's super helpful for all sorts of common gyrations whether you need to convert between the Apple syntax or windows syntax for a share and is super speedy for getting a link you can paste if that's all you need.\nAnother useful thread on SMB efficiencies:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to make Windows-style SMB share paths launch correctly?\n\nA: An easier method for sending links would be this:\n\n\n*\n\n*You copy and paste the path of the folder from the \"Get Info\" dialog where you are getting your folder path screenshot. If you highlight the path like so:\n\nYou can copy the path using Edit > Copy or Command+C.\n\n*Paste the path into the email using Edit > Paste or Command+V\n\n*Make the path a link - this will vary between email clients. As the link address, put in the file path.\n\n*When your coworker gets it, they click the link in the email and it should open the folder in Finder (assuming they have the SMB server currently connected).\nThis worked for me on El Capitan with Outlook as a mail client.\n\nA: I ended up writing an Automator Quick Action / Service for this:\nhttps://github.com/ideasonpurpose/NAS-Location-Sharing-Workflow\nA small amount of configuration will be required, to specify e.g. the server address address of your nas drive(s). Details are in the repository readme.\nWe have been making very heavy use of this within my company for nearly a year now, and it has been great. The key thing to makes it work is that we have code (an automator service) to handle both ends—both the sharing of paths and the opening of received paths. File:// and SMB:// links proved much too unreliable; different programs treat them differently.\n", "Q: How do I save images in Messages to my hard drive? I want to save some phone space and dump pics to Photos, and some cloud pic storage. Is there any easy way to dump pics from all convos?\nYeah I know about iExplorer. I was wondering if there was something on the Mac that I could script. \n\nA: This isn't quite as quick as a script via Mac, but if you know there are a few specific convos that have most of the images, you can access them all at once: \n- open message thread you want pics from\n- keep scrolling up (tap on IOS clock to do quickly) as far back as you want pics\n- tap on a photo\n- once photo is open, you should be able to see a little \"list\" indicator on bottom right - 3 bullets & lines\n- tapping the list icon will open all photos from that date forward\n- you can browse through & save from there\n- same procedure to take pics from camera roll & save to mac from there\nApologies if this was already obvious to you or not quite the shortcut you were hoping for - but it's what I've found useful as I only have a few people that I regularly exchange lots of photos with!\n", "Q: Folder of 24 gigs has only 12 gigs nested. How to account for mysterious bloat? I have a ~/Library/Developer used by Xcode.app in El Capitan. The Finder > Get Info reports a size of 24 gigs. But the two nested folders each report only 6 gigs each. So ( 2 * 6 ) = 12, and ( 24 - 12 ) = 12. Where is the other 12 mysterious gigs? \nI am showing invisible files/folders. So I believe I have not overlooked any other content. I did recently delete much content from there, and emptied the Trash.\nHow can I track down this huge discrepancy?\nUsing the du, the “display disk usage statistics” tool, where -d is depth (Display an entry for all files and directories depth directories deep) and -h is \"Human-readable\" output (Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte).\nOuter folder:\ncd ~/Library; du -d 1 -h;\n\n…\n 11G    ./Developer\n…\n\nInner folders:\ncd ~/Library/Developer; du -d 1 -h;\n\n706M    ./CoreSimulator\n4.4G    ./Shared\n5.9G    ./Xcode\n 11G    .\n\ncd ~/Library; du -d 1 -h;\nBut the Get Info reports twice that, 24.x gigs.\n\nA: tl;dr\n\n\n*\n\n*Use du tool to see the truth.\n\n*Or, maybe wait a couple of hours.\n\n\nDetails\nWhile shooting a screenshot of the Finder > Get Info showing 24 gigs and the results of the du command-line tool showing only 11 gigs, the Get Info panel changed with an automatic update. This was after a reboot and after 1-2 hours of repeatedly showing 24 gigs. \nSo the Finder must be caching information about the folders long after deleting gigs of data in a large numbers of files.\nAs suggested by tubedogg, use the du command-line tool to see accurate readings of your folder sizes.\n", "Q: Using Applescript in Automator app to run ffmpeg ffmpeg runs exactly like I want it to.

I have a brand new iPad and upgraded to iOS 10.\nI have thousands of purchases on iTunes that I don't want cluttering the lists in the Music app.  This was very easy on my iPhone 6 (iOS 8.4).\nI don't see an option in Settings > iTunes, Music, or iCloud.\nHow do I hide them?\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't have a computer to do this through iTunes on a PC or Mac.\n\n\n\n\nA: Yes, you can 'hide' them.\nFrom the main screen, tap on Downloaded Music.\nYou'll then be on a screen which is basically exactly the same as the previous one with options for Albums, Artists, etc, which will only show music on your device.\nTo make it more accessible, I suggest tapping Edit in the main Library screen and dragging the Downloaded Music row up to the top. Note also that whatever you make visible or hidden on this Edit screen will also take effect on the Downloaded Music screen (eg making Compilations visible, Artists invisible, etc).\nNote, there is no option to get rid of the initial Library screen. IE we want to effectively make the Downloaded Music screen the top level - there is no way to do that.\n\nA: Okay. This is super annoying... but I think I figured it out. If you pull up the original list of songs in your music and scroll by song, the cloud songs will show up with a cloud next to them. Click and hold each individual song and then click delete from library. Again, super annoying, but even after syncing my phone again on my computer those songs stayed deleted. Hope this helps!\n\nA: This feature does not exist on iOS10.\nWith iOS9 you could toggle \"Only Downloaded Music\" option from within the music app, which hid any purchases in the cloud (i.e. songs not actually downloaded to your device) from your device library.\nAs an alternative they have a Downloaded Music category in the Music app.\nHowever really the Downloaded Music category is not a sufficient option, nor is hiding all the purchases from our iTunes account (as this would make them unavailable on other devices if wanted).\nThe best suggestion I could make is provide feedback to Apple http://www.apple.com/feedback/ in the hopes that they restore such an option in the future.\n\nA: I figured it out.\nWith my iPhone plugged into my laptop and after authorizing it via iTunes so that I had access to my purchases, I went to 'Account'and scrolled down to 'Purchased' after clicking it, all of my purchased music popped up. I clicked the first purchased song and scrolled down while holding shift before clicking the last purchased song so that all 300 and something songs were highlighted and right clicked/delete. Immediately, all of my years old purchased music was removed from the library on my phone.  \n", "Q: How does the Lightning to 3.5mm adapter DAC compare to the internal iPhone DAC? This question is in light of the new iPhone 7, but is relevant to older iPhones as well since the adapter works with all Lightning iPhones running iOS 10.\nSince the Lightning port is digital-only, the Lightning to 3.5mm connector must contain a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC). Since the sound quality will depend largely on this DAC, how does it compare to the DAC contained in the iPhone and used traditionally for the headphone jack?\nEdit: After receiving the adapter and subjectively A/B testing it with my Sennheiser 598 headphones for an hour or so, I did not notice any difference between my iPhone 5 analog output and my iPhone 5 with lightning to headphone adapter. See @timothymh's answer for quantitative details.\n\nA: It is imperceptibly worse than the standard iPhone DAC + amplifier + headphone jack.\nRegarding the debate over whether it contains its own DAC, iFixit looked into this, in collaboration with Creative Electron, by x-raying an adapter and investigated what they saw. According to iFixit, it is likely that it contains, at minimum, “a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and amplifier, and its counterpart, an analog-to-digital-converter (ADC).” If you’re interested in learning more about that, read their article.\n\nAlso on that page, they refer to German computer tech magazine c’t, which conducted a detailed study into the sound quality of the iPhone 7 with adapter when compared to an iPhone 6s and an iPad Air with and without the adapter. Below is their English translation of c’t’s findings:\n\nIf you compare the contents of the various columns, you can see that there is very little difference in output with and without the adapter, though dynamic range and output power are very slightly reduced—well below the threshold of human perception. From iFixit’s article:\n\nSo, is it a difference you are likely to notice? If you sit in a quiet room with a really, really good pair of headphones … and you’re a canine, the answer is: maybe.\n\nThe numbers do show a reduced output impedance on he new models, which will improve frequency response with certain headphones. For optimal performance over the full frequency range, headphones with x impedance should be driven by an amplifier with an output impedance of no more than x/8. The iPhone 6s, with its 4.5Ω impedance, can drive headphones with impedance greater than 36Ω, which excludes many smaller in-ear models. The adapter's 0.37Ω impedance can accurately drive headphones as low as 3Ω—lower than any on the market. \nIn summary, if you have high-quality in-ear monitors, you may experience a small but noticeable increase in audio quality with the new adapter. Everyone else will experience an imperceptible decrease. \n", "Q: iOS using wrong public key to encrypt mail I've recently updated most of my certificates as they've expired at similar times.\nIt appears that iOS mail is encrypting mail to one of my recipients using their old certificate, as such they cannot decrypt it when they receive it.\nI checked in the one profile that is installed and it only contains my own certificate and key. Where are my recipients public keys kept? I need to check them and delete the old ones. Otherwise how do you tell iOS which public key to use when encrypting mail?\n\nA: There is no list, you can scroll through to edit the public keys of the emails you received.\nThe only way is to open an old mail (signed with the old public key), hit the certificate and manually uninstall it.\nIt seems that iOS on iPhone has a bug since version 9.x that causes that new public keys of certs can not overwrite the old versions automatically.\nSee the discussion here:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/29015875?start=0&tstart=0\n\nDo NOT follow Apple's advice in the support document \"Send an encrypted message to someone outside your Exchange environment\". Specifically, do NOT manually trust the certificate by hitting View Certificate>Install because (I believe) this will keep a trusted certificate in your keychain after this certificate expires and is replaced. iOS will not let you install an updated certificate with the same RFC 822 Name (email address), and will continue to encrypt using the same trusted-but-expired certificate. After hitting Install, you'll have to Reset All Settings to get rid of it (bad).\nRather, View Certificate, then request a copy of the Root Certificate Authority (.cer) and, if necessary, the Intermediate CA (.cer) that signs the sender's cert. Install these .cer certificates in your System Profiles. In my experience, I need both the Root and Intermediate CAs for iOS.\n\n(btw: I had exactly the same problem)\n", "Q: What is the content of the unsubscribe message? Introduced in iOS 10, a standard message for unsubscribing can be sent in a couple of taps from any Mail message that was sent to a list.\n\nSince this feature allows the Mail app to send an email on my behalf and from my e-mail address (I suppose), I would love to know what message the recipient receives.\n\nA: It'll not send an e-mail, it'll just try to find an unsubscribe link and activate it.\n", "Q: Strange icon in my menu bar This strange icon decided to appear in my menubar this week, and I have absolutely no clue as to what it is.

I get the following error:\n\n\n  Can't connect to the server because the name or password is incorrect.\n\nThe server is a Mac Mini running Yosemite with file server configured with Server.app.\nDesktops are iMacs running El Capitan. They all connect via SMB by default when clicking on the Mac Mini icon on the sidebar.\nI can replicate this problem on my MacBook Pro running El Capitan. I am connecting via afp://myserveraddress and smb://myserveraddress in Finder.app via \"Connect to Server\" menu.\nI find that on my MacBook, copying and pasting files works while I am connected via AFP but not while I am connected via SMB.\nBut I cannot simply turn off SMB on the server, we also have Windows and Linux desktops that needs to connect to the server too.\nWhat do I have to do so that Macs can connect to the server via SMB as a majority of the users would only be able to connect by clicking on the Mac Mini icon in finder rather than going through \"Connect to Server\" like me.\n\nA: This has been resolved by upgrading the server to El Capitan. Copy and paste files on the sharepoint works now when accessing from MacBooks and iMacs running El Capitan.\nUpgrade note, I find the order of steps for the upgrade important. The following are what I find the shortest and easiest steps when done in that order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup. (I used Time Machine, but use whatever works for you.)\n\n*Run Install El Capitan.app, I had it saved to the local disk, otherwise run it from the Mac App Store.\n\n*Log back in after the upgrade has rebooted the server.\n\n*Run all El Capitan updates via App Store.\n\n*Update Server.app. (Via App Store.)\n\n*Open Server.app and ensure that file service is turned on. It was turned off in my case so I just turned it back on after double checked the file and sharepoints and their permissions.\n\n*Test with client computer with smb://myserveraddress in Finder.app via \"Connect to Server\" menu, this is so that you know it is working with SMB.\n\n\nOut of the above, step 4 and 5 are the most important. In my case the latest version of Server.app was not compatible with older version of El Capitan (I didn't have the latest version of El Capitan as I didn't upgrade it from Yosemite through the App Store). So after upgrading to El Capitan, always install all updates available for El Capitan before proceeding to anything else.\n", "Q: Can I remove a photo or video from the Memories feature in iOS 10's photo app?

MacBook 13 Retina Early 2015 with latest 10.11 El Capitan updates.\nI changed my admin MacBook user password, tested the new password by locking/unlocking and then putting it and myself to sleep. The next day the password did not work.\nI then used the Apple ID to reset the password. My disk was encrypted with FileVault so some of the other options were not viable.\nAfter entering my Apple ID with password, it shows a window and says:\nRecovering file vault key\n\nThis passes, flicks up a brief window about Finding a recovery, but it is so fast I can't read it all and then lands me on a page with:\nReset Password Completed\n\nYour user account password has been reset.

No password was emailed and no password reset is offered on reboot.\nApple Support's last suggestion was to reformat the MacBook.\nI continued trying various themes of changing the password using my Apple ID. I noticed sometimes after turning off wifi and only using ethernet via thunderbolt, I sometimes get an option to enter a new password. It tells me the \"Password Reset Completed\", however, this new password I entered still does not work after reboot.\nI also tried logging onto the Apple ID management and enabling two factor authentication. The two factor auth works, but any new MacBook user passwords don't work (if I am lucky enough to make it to that screen).\nThe MacBook shows as logged in on the Apple ID management site and the iCloud site. I tried removing the device (I believe this logs my account out of the device). After changing the password again with Apple ID, it still does not work.\nSide note: I also tried to turn on the guest user after I made my initial password change. The guest user is not available at the login screen, only my admin user. I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but thought I would mention it.\nAny ideas would be great if I could avoid a reinstall.\n\nA: Strange... If you wait long enough at the EFI Login Window does the text at the bottom change to say something about restarting into Recovery to reset your password? If so, hold down the power button to shut down then hold it down again to startup in Recovery.

I can see via Activity Monitor that storedownloadd is receiving a lot of packets and responsible for my ~1mb download. When opening the App Store, I can see only one update (Xcode 8). Can I deduce that this is what's being downloaded?\nIf not, how can I?\n\nA: The App Store may not record exactly what everything it does is, but you can try looking a couple places:\n/Library/Receipts/InstallHistory.plist has a list of program installation history for the computer (most recent installation at the bottom, with the highest numbered entry). \n/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.plist will give you the number of pending updates as well as the last time the App Store checked for updates.\nYou could also try running /usr/sbin/softwareupdate --dump-state, which dumps the current state of the update daemon to /var/log/install.log.\n(As a side note, in my experience XCode updates are usually over 1 GB in size, so an XCode update would definitely run for an extended period and download lots of data.)\n", "Q: How do I access BIOS on my MacBook Pro (13 Inch - middle 2012)? On many Intel based computers, pressing the delete key shortly after powering on the computer, allows you to enter BIOS (or equivalent to it). How do I enter BIOS or equivalent on my MacBook Pro?\nPlease note it is traditional Intel Mainboard i5, without EFI.\n\nA: The closest equivalent is holding option at start. That runs the firmware that allows you to select network boot or external or internal bootable OS. \nThere is no open firmware anymore where you can enter commands, so you can just reset NVRAM or let the option boot read the current NVRAM settings. Anything you would set in bios, you can write to the non volatile ram from any OS X booted OS and then those variables and settings are applied next boot. \nThere is no bios and no concept of a user navigable hierarchy of settings to adjust before any OS loads to Apple hardware. Most of what you might do “in BIOS” isn't possible. \n", "Q: OS X does not remember my network passwords anymore My OS X always forgets its Wi-Fi network passwords after disconnecting or sleeping.

It isn't an issue with the image as it works fine on any machine with an internal Ethernet port but just not on any MacBook which needs a Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet adapter. I have also tried using a USB to Ethernet adapter and still have had no luck.\nWhen I try and netboot using the N key I get the flashing globe which would indicate the machine is requesting an IP address, but then it seems to time out and boots into the current Mac OS installation on the disk. I have checked the DHCP settings and everything is fine on that side. If I try holding the option key to bring up the Startup Manager it only sees the internal disk and not any of the images on the server. But if I go into Startup Disk preferences it sees all the images but selecting one of them and restarting I get the same behaviour as when I boot using the N key. It seems like it isn’t loading the driver for the the thunderbolt adapter until it loads the OS. I’ve checked in the logs on the Server and I don’t see any entries that relate to the MAC address of the adapter for DHCP or BDSP. Its a real shame that you can't do a NetBoot in verbose mode (not as far as I know anyway) so you could actually find out where it is failing.\nDoes anyone know why the Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet adapter isn’t get recognised until the OS has loaded? If this is by design then Apple have really messed up as how would you be able to do a NetBoot/Install/Restore without the adapter being recognised when the firmware loads?\n\nA: I NetBoot with those all the time (Thunderbolt mostly). This is an Apple dongle, right? As long as it's connected before you start up then it'll load the driver.\nYou can NetBoot in verbose mode. Set the Startup Disk in System Preferences then restart while holding Command-V (I usually set it permanently on test systems: sudo nvram boot-args=\"-v\").\nNot seeing any entries from that adaptor's MAC Address in the server's system.log means the traffic isn't making it to the server for some reason. You can confirm by getting a server-side packet trace (assuming you're using en0):\nsudo tcpdump -i en0 -s 0 -B 524288 -w ~/Desktop/NetBoot.pcap\n\nI usually filter in Wireshark for bootp or tftp to see how far along things get.\nYou can get a client-side packet trace by using either a \"dumb hub\" (not as common these days) or mirroring a port on the switch (assuming your network gear can do this).\n\nA: Was a weird server issue. Completely re-configured the server and now builds are working perfectly. Still not sure of the underlying issue but its been good for the last few months.\n", "Q: need for 1000 dpi non PDF image from powerpoint The journal does not want pdf nor 300dpi. They want 1000 dpi. How do I get there from mac powerpoint?\n\nA: Journals ask for esoteric and often silly image requirements all the time*. Unfortunately you're starting with an image in PowerPoint. It isn't a graphics program though, it's a slide deck program and your options are limited. This time, you will need to export as a vector (PDF), open in Preview, and then export as the DPI desired by the journal.\nStart here for help: Changing the target DPI when saving slides as images in PowerPoint 2011\nNote that if your image is just that - an image, NOT a chart or graph or text, but literally a photo - exporting at higher DPI will just give you a blurrily-enlarged version of your current image, NOT a crisp, clear, high-resolution file. In that case, you'd need to re-create your image at a higher resolution starting from the original source files, which (if they are not at or above 1000 dpi) might literally be not possible.\n...and next time, use a proper graphics program to create your images. If cost is an issue, open source ones exist, such as Inkscape or GIMP, that will get you closer to what a journal wants when it comes time to publish. The MS Office suite is ubiquitous but that doesn't mean it's the proper tool for the job.\n(*The journal requirement is silly, really, because PDF is a vector format - which means it's resolution-independent, and looks good at any size. Most journals prefer vector images. Some refuse them, for no good reason. The ONLY time a vector isn't superior is where the original artwork is something other than lines and curves, such as photographs/photomicrographs. For graphs and charts, vector is much superior.)\n", "Q: Can only print PDFs I have Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.6, iMac 27 inch late 2013.  I can print any PDF but nothing else.

If I save to PDF, you get a blank PDF except for a tiny box in the middle.\nI have removed and reinstalled the print drivers. I have tried the Command+Option+P+R keypresses at startup. \n\nA: Try resettings CUPS (Common Unix Printing System). To do this right click on the printer in System Preferences and select Reset Printing System.

I want to know if he can view my contacts and chats?\nIf yes, then how can I delete that?\n\nA: He can only view your info if he's logged into WhatsApp using your ID and password.  It doesn't matter under which account the app was downloaded/updated from the App Store.  \nWhen you're done with the iPhone, and before you give it back to your friend, be sure to log out of WhatsApp.\n\nA: there is no \"logging in and out\" of what's app.\nthere is \"verifying your phone number\" or \"deleting the app\" (or deleting app data both of which will force a new verification) or \"deleting your account\".\nverifying your phone number is the same as connecting your account (based on your phone number) to that particular installation on that particular phone.\nit's a little tricky when you change the sim card in a phone without taking one of the above actions. or when you change phones but keep the same sim card. or even trickier when you change phones and sim cards.\nif you give your phone where what's app is installed to someone without deleting the app (or app data) or deleting your account or verifying your account on your new phone they will continue to have access to your what's app just as if the phone was in your hands.. \nwhat's app does not know whose hand is holding the phone that it's connected to.\neven if you remove and keep your sim card and give the phone to someone without your sim card installed there will be no \"automatic\" effect on your what's app account installed on that phone.  if you give your phone AND your old sim card with the same number on it to someone they would be able to re-verify your account since they have the same number even if you deleted the app.  they may or may not be able to access historical data depending on whether or not you made backups, but contact info and group settings should reappear unless you have \"deleted\" your what's app account before handing over your phone and phone number.\n", "Q: How to enable location settings for the app when app is not on the list of location services? \nThe screen above describes situation.

Furthermore, the control itself is disabled!\n\nWhy might javascript be permanently disabled? How can I re-enable it?\nIt obviously makes it difficult to debug javascript when it's disabled on my debug device.\n\nA: The following is based on my observation.\nBy default the Safari JavaScript is enabled, because most of the website that I visited that extensively using JavaScript are working in Safari. The problem starts only when I Clear History and Website Data and go to Settings > Safari > Advanced.\nI think as soon as you hit Advanced \"for the first time\" the program just has an issue as no previous settings are set, thus setting itself to Disable.\nI exited from settings and visit the previous website that are using JavaScript, obviously all of them either don't show up or become a Dumb website except you click a link that uses anchor. \nSolution: Just go to Advanced again and set Enable the JavaScript setting.

Today I read: \n\nApple today released an updated golden master (GM) version of macOS Sierra to developers… The new GM seed is build 16A323, while the build released last week was 16A320. \n\nAfter downloading, in the Finder > Get Info of ‘Install macOS Sierra.app’ I see ‘Version: 12.0.49’ but no build number.\nHow to identifier the build number of a macOS installer? \nMy goal is to verify what installer I may be using.\n\nA: To determine the macOS Sierra GM build number use:\ncat \"/Applications/Install macOS Sierra.app/Contents/Info.plist\" | grep -A 1 DTSDKBuild\n\nPlease apply the leading portion of the path if your Install macOS Sierra.app resides elsewhere.\n\nA: The most reliable way of telling the build number is to check the SystemVersion.plist file inside the installer's OS image file (and not the build number of the installer app itself).\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount /Applications/Install macOS Sierra.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg\n\n*Mount /Volumes/OS X Install ESD/BaseSystem.dmg (hidden file)\n\n*Open /Volumes/OS X Base System/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist and examine the build number under <key>ProductBuildVersion</key>\n\nA: Hmm... I know when you're booted from the same major version of the OS (10.12, in this case) you can open System Image Utility and select the Install Assistant from the Sources menu and it'll tell you the build number.\nBut, it will only show the installer (or other volumes) that it can image, which have to match the major version of the booted system. So if you're in 10.11 now and want to see the build number of a 10.12 installer that won't work.\n\nA: To determine the macOS High Sierra build number use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app/Contents/SharedSupport/BaseSystem.dmg\n\n*Open /Volumes/OS X Base System/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist\n\n*Find the version number under <key>ProductBuildVersion</key>\n\nA: MOST UPDATED ANSWER for 2020.\nSince macOS Mojave, a lot of things have changed. I hope this newer answer remains valid for at least a couple of releases. I'm listing down few different methods, just in case one becomes obsolete.\nBelow commands assume you have already cd to /Applications/Install macOS XXX.app/Contents\n\n*\n\n*cat Info.plist| grep -A 1 DTPlatformVersion should give you the full version like <string>10.15.6</string>\n\n\n*cat Info.plist | grep -A 1 CFBundleShortVersionString should give you should give you the minor version (postfix after 10.x) like <string>15.6.00</string>\n\n\n*cat version.plist| grep -A 1 CFBundleShortVersionString should give you should give you the minor version (postfix after 10.x) like <string>15.6.00</string>\n\n\n*cat SharedSupport/InstallInfo.plist | grep -E '[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,2}\\.[0-9]{1,2}' should most probably be able to give you the version in format XX.XX.XX\n\nA: To find the build number once macOS Sierra is installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose Apple Menu > About This Mac \n\n*Choose System Report... to start System Information app\n\n*Choose Software from left side  \n\n*From right side find \"System Version: macOS 10.12 (build number here)\"\n\n", "Q: Mail.app won't start This is really weird.  Sometime later than July this year, Mail.app would go \"not responding\" as soon as launched, never opening any window.\nsystem.log shows a lot of errors, but the very first is\nSep 15 19:55:02 Adminadabs-MacBook-Pro Mail[7758]: AllSignatures.plist: Syncing with cloud -- merging; local data, no cloud data not reachable, error: Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=260 \"The file “ubiquitous_AllSignatures.plist” couldn’t be opened because there is no such file.\" UserInfo={NSURL=file:///Users/wgroleau/Library/Mobile%20Documents/com~apple~mail/Data/V3/MailData/Signatures/ubiquitous_AllSignatures.plist, NSFilePath=/Users/wgroleau/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~mail/Data/V3/MailData/Signatures/ubiquitous_AllSignatures.plist, NSUnderlyingError=0x7ffa81dd8de0 {Error Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=2 \"No such file or directory\"}}\nThe first thing noticed in that message is a mention of \"cloud\" but not \"iCloud.\"  Just in case they're the same, I note that in system Prefs for iCloud, Mail is NOT checked, nor is Keychain.\nNext is that some file associated with signatures is missing.  That file is so deep in the file system, I couldn't have deleted it by accident.  But in going through backups, I find two more oddities:\nFirst, that though Mail quit recently, that Signatures directory is missing from ALL backups.  Time Machine prefs have no exclusions.\nSecond, that my earliest backup is the beginning of this year, when I'm sure I have been using this drive a lot longer and it is only 39% full.\nWhat other than Mail would delete the entire signatures directory and/or prevent its backup?  If it were done by a function within Mail, I would not expect Mail to be disabled by it.\nHow can this be fixed with no backup available?  Could I copy someone else's signatures and then edit them back to mine? \nUPDATE: The admin account and a non-admin account on the machine also have no signature directory, and Mail runs fine for them.  SO, I conclude that the directory was created when I created the first signature, and some other plist is telling Mail it needs to open those signatures.  Where would that plist be?\nANOTHER UPDATE: I scanned the directory and found that the last file mod date in ~/Library/Mail was 3 Aug.  I restored a 1 Aug from Time Machine and launched Mail.  The convert to new version dialog appeared.  When it \"Imported 1005 of 1005 messages … Time remaining: About a minute,\" the beachball appeared.  Still there twenty minutes later and the Dock icon is \"not responding\"\n\nA: I mentioned that Mail was not checked in iCloud, but later, it was checked.  I'm supposing something restored from backup did that.\nI turned it off again, and mail worked!\nBut .... why did it not work before the restore when that was turned off?\nAnd why should having it ON break Mail?\n", "Q: How do I pair iOS Remote with iTunes? I'm using iOS 10 on an iPhone 6, with the latest Remote app (updated today). I want to use it to control iTunes on my MacBook Pro, running OS 10.11.6. Both devices are on the same wi-fi network and have Bluetooth enabled.\nIn the iOS Remote app, I click \"Add a Device\". It tells me to go to iTunes and click the Remote button in the top left of the window. But there's no such button! Where do I find it?\n\n\n\nA: OK, I finally figured this out.\nFirst I opened Remote and clicked \"Add A Device\".\nThen in iTunes, I clicked the phone icon below the volume slider. This became a drop-down menu, and one of the items was a Remote icon. (This didn't work every time; I first had to disconnect and re-connect my phone to the wi-fi network.)\n\nFinally, I was able to enter the code in iTunes, and it paired the devices.\nI didn't need Home Sharing turned on.\n\nA: You mentioned, you have wifi and bluetooth on. You only need wifi on. You must also first have home sharing turned on in iTunes.\nFor Home Sharing, you’ll need to use the same Apple ID across all your devices. Here’s how to check the Apple ID on each device:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your Mac or PC, open iTunes and look under File > Home Sharing. To\nuse a different Apple ID with Home Sharing, choose Turn Off Home\nSharing, then set up Home Sharing again.\n\n*On your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, go to Settings > Music or\nSettings > Videos.\n\n\nIf you have Remote 2.0 (or later) and Home Sharing is turned on, you can set Remote to pair automatically with any of the iTunes libraries on your Home Sharing network.\nPair Remote with an iTunes library\nTap Remote on your device’s Home screen.\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap Add an iTunes Library.\n\n*A 4-digit code appears.\n\n*Open iTunes on your computer and click the Remote button Play icon\ninside a white circle, inside a gray square near the top left of the\niTunes window.\n\n*Type the 4-digit code.\n\n\niTunes pairs the library on your computer with the Remote app on your device.\nPair Remote with your Home Sharing network\nTo use Remote 2.0 (or later) with Home Sharing, every iTunes library you want to control must have Home Sharing turned on.\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap Remote on your device’s Home screen.\n\n*Tap Settings\n\n*Tap to turn Home Sharing on.\n\n*Type your Apple ID and password, and tap Done.\n\n*Tap the iTunes library or Apple TV you want to control.\n\n", "Q: List of specific apps on my iPhone with Siri integration How do I see that list and the commands I can use for each app?\n\nA: These two options may help, although it's not exactly what you're after.\nOne\nWhen using Siri, at the bottom left of the screen, you'll see a '?'. If you tap on the question mark (?) Siri will list the apps you can use with Siri and tapping on an individual app will list some examples for you. \nAnother way to access this screen is to just say something like \"Hey Siri, what can you do?\".\nTwo \nGo to Settings > Siri > App Support \nThis will list 3rd party apps that you can allow to process requests via Siri. For example, if you have LinkedIn installed, it should be listed here.\nSummary\nAs far as an exhaustive list of apps and how they can be used with Siri, I do think this is an unrealistic expectation. After all there are over 2 million apps currently in the App Store. How would you make this work in a practical sense? How could it be populated/maintained in a timely and useful manner? I'm not saying it'd be impossible, just that it's not really practical and the benefits would not justify the effort involved.\nInstead, as developers take advantage of the Siri APIs the onus is really on them to highlight and 'sell' the virtues of their product. I know that's what I'll be doing.\n", "Q: Xcode 8: Unable to Accept License Agreement on OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 I have downloaded Xcode 8 from App Store. on clicking Xcode icon it is showing the following:\n\nAfter clicking on Agree button it asks for the username and password.

On the other hand, the two major domestic airlines certainly support Apple Wallet with their boarding passes.\nThe question is:\n(a) Is it possible to hide the credit card section, or, at least, to move it below the boarding passes?\n(b) Is this why the double-click short cut doesn’t work to show the Wallet from the lock screen?\n\nA: For devices supporting Apple Pay, the feature cannot be disabled and is shown at the top of the Wallet app. There is no option to hide the feature or disable it using Restrictions.\nDouble-clicking the home button only works if there is a card in Apple Pay, upon which the default Apple Pay card is shown and other Wallet cards/passes can be presented. Unfortunately without any Apple Pay card this feature is unavailable.\n\nA: There is a workaround to Apple Pay in Wallet, if you only want to show a boarding pass... (This is a slightly different answer from the one above. I didn't turn off/disable Apple Pay - I just got around it.)\nI was presented by the (un-dismissable) \"Pay with Touch ID...\" message. I couldn't expose the full boarding pass (which was partially shown on the screen.) Swiping up, left, right didn't work.\nBUT... tapping on the boarding pass moves it into view. (Duh! Whew!)\n\nA: The Wallet contains every virtual card or pass you have but it is meant to be location-aware so that it can offer the appropriate card/pass when you need it.   Check Privacy -> Location Services -> Wallet to see if you are allowing the Wallet app to access your location.\nI have many cards cards & passes in the Wallet app.  If I am standing in an airport and location services is enabled for Wallet, then the phone's lock screen typically has a Wallet notice that I can tap to immediately open the boarding pass.\n", "Q: Why iterm2 keyboard shortcut settings don't work on window launched using F12 I've followed the instructions here on how to make alt→ and alt← skip words backward and forward..\nthis works just fine on the original window displayed by iterm2.. however when i press F12 and the window shows up.. those keyboard shortcuts don't work any more.. any idea why and how to fix it?\n\n\nA: On the Preferences Window of iTerm choose keys and below on the left side you see the Hotkey Configuration.

OS X El capitan \nversion 10.11.6\nMacbook pro 13-inch\nWhenever I connect to projector, the projected screen has a old picture of me and it is quite embarrassing when I am presenting in front of professional crowd. I already removed that picture from the Desktop pictures folder but every time I connect projector, it still shows the same.\nThis is not happening when I connect to external display (monitor) though.How can i change this? \n\nA: I suggest you plug into a projector and then use the Desktop & Screen Saver Control Panel to change the background of the desktop being projected to something else. The new background should then stay the same anytime you plug a monitor/projector in.\n\nA: As far as I'm aware, the desktop picture is stored separately for each desktop you use & can only be edited from System Prefs > Desktop & Screensaver whilst that desktop is in use.\nThe file that stores them all is at ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.desktop.plist\nIf you edit that you could at least find where that picture is on your machine & either edit to another picture, or move the original so it can't be found.\nIt's not something I've ever tried editing & my own .plist isn't much help as I have the same picture across 2 monitors & 6 spaces... so there's a lot of repetition - so you might want to make a backup of it before messing.\n", "Q: Remove suggested apps option in iOS 10 As far as I can tell, suggested apps show themselves based on location.\nThere are two places where these suggested apps show themselves to me:\n\n\n*\n\n*At the bottom left of the multitask screen when I double press the home button\n\n*At the bottom left of the lock screen\n\n\nCNET's Disable iOS 8's 'Suggested Apps' feature article describes how to get rid of the small app icon appearing in the bottom left.

Specifically, add the line: \ndo shell script \"pkill -1 -l Finder\"\n\nThe second argument to pkill -- the '-l' -- is for debugging purposes.

In iOS 9 I could continuously touch an old message and press send as a text message (or something like that). Now in iOS 10 I don't see anything relevant.\n\nA: So, does the other person have an iPhone or something else? If it's something else, then it will automatically send as an sms. If the messages fails to send, and you try multiple times to send it, it will ask if you want to send as an sms instead of an iMessage (at least I think it will still do that).\nIf anything else, you could always go into iMessage settings, sign out of your Apple ID and then turn off and on iMessage.\n\nA: This is still available but you first need to enable 'Send as SMS' under the global settings for the messages app. (I assume this is off by default, as I had the same trouble as the questioner.)\nOnce you have enabled the option, then there is an extra menu entry when you hold down on the message (the reactions menu will pop up, and an action sheet at the bottom with 'Copy', 'Send as Text Message', and 'More...' will appear).\nIf you haven't turned on 'Send as SMS' in messages settings the menu will only contain 'Copy' and 'More...' - this also seems to be true for any messages you sent before enabling the option. So you need to send a new iMessage first, then press and hold on that while it is sending or after it has been sent.\n\nA: Not sure about iOS 10 but I figured out a way that works in iOS 11 and posted this video example:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih3ABR9lswE\nWhat you need to do is tap on the message right after you send it and then a menu pops up that lets you choose \"Send as Text Message\".\nThis doesn't always work for some reason but I think has to do if your current thread is sending to a phone number versus an email address that's tied to an Apple ID.\n\nA: It still works, you just need to hold down on the message longer than before to get the text message option.\n", "Q: How to remove word suggestion bar in text messages in ios10?

Unfortunately your question really hasn't provided much detail, so this answer may go into more detail than you wanted.\nPOP v IMAP\nFirst of all I am guessing that you're using what's called a POP email account and that you've probably set your email clients up to not delete emails from the server. This is only a guess because your question provides little detail.\nBoth POP (Post Office Protocol) and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) allow users to download their email from an email server. However, POP simply downloads email to your computer, and usually (but not always) deletes the email from the remote server. This is the way email accounts were always set up originally, but problems arise when you have more than one device (desktop, laptop, tablet or phone) you want to access your mail from. This means you have to delete or file or mark as read, etc etc the same email on every device.\nIMAP, on the other hand allows you to keep your email on a remote server. This two-way protocol also allows you to synchronise your email among multiple devices, especially useful since most people have at least two devices - their laptop and smartphone. Basically, if you're using IMAP and mark an email as read, it gets marked as read in your web based inbox or other email clients too (because the changes are happening on the server, not just locally). However, this won’t be the case if you are using POP, because your emails are downloaded to your PC and the changes won’t reflect on the server.\nHowever, there are reasons why you may prefer POP. For example, depending on the email server, storage space for your messages may be limited. Also, reading messages while offline requires use of your e-mail program's Offline mode (assuming it has one). And, in some cases, accessing and working with emails can be slower when using IMAP.\nIn summary, both protocols offer their advantages and disadvantages. Today many will argue that POP is deprecated and IMAP is the only way forward, but in reality there are still very good arguments for using POP over IMAP. In the end, it gets down to what you value personally.\nYour situation\nNow you should be able to see why I said I'm guessing that you're using a POP email account. Basically, if you were using an IMAP account you would have seen the emails you deleted on your desktop also disappear from your iPhone.\nNow, I'm not saying you should change from POP to IMAP, I'm just explaining what has happened in your case and why.\nSo, if your goal was to free up space on your iPhone, then you need to do it directly on your iPhone, rather than on your desktop. However, if your goal was to reduce space on both, then you will need to do it separately on both, or consider changing your setup to use IMAP instead.\nIf you'd like to change your setup and need help in doing so, it'd be best to post another question providing more details of your situation and asking for advice on that.\nSteve Chamber's suggestion may work\nJust a quick word on Steve's comment re your question:\n\nThe easy way would be to delete the account from the phone. That will\n  remove all the data. then re-add the account and any deleted data\n  won't be there.\n\nSteve's suggestion may also help you achieve what you want if you haven't got a lot of emails still on your server. For example, if you've set up your email clients so that emails remain on the server for only a day or week after being downloaded, then Steve's suggestion may be a quick fix because your iPhone will only re-download a smaller number of emails. However, if your email clients are not deleting emails from the server, or leaving them on the server for a long time before deleting, then Steve's suggestion won't be very helpful.\n", "Q: Can I use Applescript to go to the end of a text document?

He upgraded to iOS 10 and now it's asking him to \"approve the phone\" on another device. Logging in on iCloud.com does not work. Please advise so he can continue setting up his phone without resetting all of his data!\n\nA: Dear tubedogg & Gabriel,\nAs Gabriel pointed out, this problem is NOT related to iCloud Keychain, but actually to Two-Factor Authentication. Unfortunately, this problem has not been solved even by iOS 10.0.2 released on Sep. 23rd yet. If you automatically turned on the authentication during your update to iOS 10x, here is the solution.\nSTEP 1: When you update the iOS, skip \"approve the phone\" by pushing the button of Cancel. You can retry it later.\nSTEP 2: Complete the iOS update by following the instruction.\nSTEP 3: Make sure that your Two-Factor Authentication is ON at this moment by either of the following options:\n Option A) Read a notification email from Apple.\n Option B) On your iPhone, go to [Settings] --> [iCloud] --> tap your profile of Apple ID --> Password & Security --> Two-Factor Authentication\nSTEP 4: Turn OFF the Two-Factor Authentication. During this process, you will be required to reset your Apple ID (iTunes & iCloud) password. But no worries, no date will be deleted. If you received the notification email about the Authentication, you will find a link of \"turning off the Authentication\" in the email.\nSTEP 5: After completing the Authentication OFF, retry \"approve the phone\" by going to\n[Settings] --> the red flag. Without doing anything, your iPhone will be automatically and immediately approved. All set.\nYou can get the Two-Factor Authentication back ON anytime later if you wish.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: (This applies only to iCloud Keychain. All other iCloud data will be transferred even if you choose to skip the approval process.)\nDoes your husband have an iPad? If so, accept the request from that device and try again.\nOtherwise…\n\nIf you can't access any of your other devices that are using iCloud Keychain, you can still set up iCloud Keychain on another device if you have these items:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Your iCloud Security Code\n  \n*The device that is using the SMS-capable phone number you provided when you first set up iCloud Keychain. A verification code is sent via SMS to this phone number. If you can't access this number, contact Apple Support, who can verify your identity, so that you can complete setup on your new device.\n  \n  \n  After you complete the setup, your iCloud Keychain will be pushed from the cloud to the new device. If you use two-factor authentication with your Apple ID, enter your password and the six-digit verification code that's automatically displayed on your trusted devices and authorize the new device. Then turn on iCloud Keychain.\n\nSource: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT204085\n\nA: I have the same problem. I don't think it is related to keychain though. It only happened after IOS 10 was downloaded and the phone asked me if I wanted to use two factor authentication. I agreed and then it took me to a screen that said to approve the phone but would not allow me to input a authentication code only a spinning wheel was visible like it was attempting to load something but never did. I do have an IPAD and once I started that up it told me that my phone was trying to access Icloud which I allowed but it changed nothing on the actual Iphone. \n", "Q: iOS Photos removing individual face photo from People folder How do I remove a photo that has accidentally been put in the wrong people photo album?\nI have a photo of my dad (who is now deceased) that has appeared in the album for my father-in-law (who is very much alive). I can't find a way to remove an individual photo from the new people album once it is in it.\nI don't want to hide the whole album of my father-in-law, just remove this one misfiled photo.\n\nA: The \"Not This Person\" option only shows up if you select the person from the \"People\" album, and not through the Spotlight search.\n\nA: Select your father-in-law from the \"People\" album, tap the \"Select\" button in the upper right-hand corner, tap on the mislabeled photo, tap the \"Share\" icon in the bottom left, then from the list at the bottom of the screen select \"Not This Person.\"\nIf you need to select multiple photos, check all applicable pictures from the scrollable list at the top of the Share sheet prior to pressing \"Not This Person.\"\n\nIf you don’t see this control, you are likely browsing photos from a location other than the People album. Use the back buttons in the top left to navigate all the way back to the top-level list of albums, then tap into the album corresponding to the person who has been wrongly identified in photos.\n\nA: iOS 15 in 2021 adds a new \"Review Confirmed Photos\" feature for removing potential wrong matches from a person's various photos/faces:\n\nAlbums > People > select a person; \"•••\" > Review Confirmed Photos\n\n\n\nSource: https://twitter.com/gregheo/status/1440052462673481730\n\nA: As above 'Select your father-in-law from the \"People\" album, tap the \"Select\" button in the upper right-hand corner, tap on the mislabeled photo, tap the \"Share\" icon in the bottom left, then from the list at the bottom of the screen select \"Not This Person.\". \nIf you cannot see 'Not This Person' in the list, try swiping left to see more options or tapping 'More'\n", "Q: Music on iPhone isn't visible in Google Play Music app On my old Android device, I used Google Play Music. It would sync the music that was on my Android device (music app) into Google Play Music.\nI synced MP3s using iTunes from my computer to my iPhone, but they don't show up in Google Play Music.\nI don't enjoy switching from app to app just to listen to different music. Help?\n\nA: I feel like what was actually happening on Android is that it was uploading files from your library to the cloud and then making them available in Google Play Music (one of its major features). It also could have been reading the music library on the device directly. I'm not completely sure, to be honest, but for purposes of this answer, it's mostly irrelevant.\nFor iOS, though, you will need to upload the music to Google Play Music using the Google Play Music Manager on your computer. Once that's done it will be available on Google Play Music on your iOS device (and Android, for that matter).\nOtherwise, you would need to use the iPhone Music app to listen to the MP3s you synced onto your iPhone, or another app that supports directly using those MP3s.\n", "Q: Galaxy S7 user with inactive iPhone 6 - Can I get iMessage with my active phone number? I have a pretty unique and specific scenario. \nHere's some context. My friend lost his iPhone 6 in my house last October. Since he had insurance on the phone, he was able to replace it. I ended up finding it four months later. To complicate matters, Sprint said the phone's IMEI is blacklisted because the phone is listed as lost or stolen. My friend is contacting Sprint to let them know that he has found the phone, and he will let me keep the phone since I found it.\nI already have a Samsung Galaxy S7 with my active Sprint number (415 area code). I prefer to use my Samsung for daily use with that number. \nWhat I am looking to do is use the iPhone just for iMessage, so that I can still be in touch with friends and family who have iPhones while I'm out of the US. I only want to use the iPhone 6 to use iMessage when connected with Wi-Fi because I am going overseas for work in January. I might pause the active Sprint ph#(415) account while out of the US since I wont be able to receive SMS messages while in Europe and Asia but still considering all options.\nAssuming my friend is able to get the phone's IMEI off the blacklist, will I be able to activate the iPhone with my Sprint phone number and get iMessage up and going, then go back to my Samsung Galaxy S7 once I get iMessage account running? Are their any easier ways to get my end goal of communicating thru iMessage without any obstacles?\n\nA: Once you start using the iPhone on your account, and activate iMessage, you will no longer be able to receive SMS on the Galaxy from any contacts who use iPhones, because from Apple's perspective, your number will now be an iMessage number.\nIf you wait until you're ready to leave to do this, that will work. However, if you pause/cancel/whatever your service with Sprint, you will only be able to receive iMessages if the person has the email address associated with your Apple ID in your contact on their iPhone, and you have that email address set up for receiving in iMessage settings on your iPhone. If your service stays active, messages from other iPhone users will still be received by your phone via your phone number, but only if you're connected to Wi-Fi (or enable data roaming, which would probably be a bad idea if you like keeping your money).\nOnce you get back, assuming you want to resume using the Galaxy, you'll want to deregister your number from iMessage or you will back in the same predicament as far as not being able to trade messages with iPhone users.\n", "Q: Can I pair an iPhone6 running 9.3.5 with an iMac using 10.9.5? I've been trying desperately to pair my iPhone 6 which is running iOS 9.3.5 with my 27 inch iMac (late 2009) running 10.9.5 with no success. I have tried turning Bluetooth on and off on both devices, and was able to get the pairing code to show up each time, however when I click on the computer name the iPhone message says:\n\"Connection Unsuccessful- Make sure the computer is turned on and in range\".\nor it says:\n\"Connection Unsuccessful- \"Username iMac\" is not supported\"\nIt should be noted that on the computer the iPhone is showing up in the Bluetooth drop-down menu from the top right. Also, it shows up in the Bluetooth preferences, but goes back and forth from being paired, and not connected. \n\nA: As stated in this article, many older Apple machines, and specifically the hardware specified in the question, have no Bluetooth 4 support.  \n\nThe information on that site provides links not only to iMacs, but most Apple machines. \n\nA: It is not supported to pair an iPhone and a Mac via Bluetooth and use the either of one as a Bluetooth speaker/receiver. Both are in simple terms in the wrong device class\nBut you could use a third party tool to make your Mac an Airplay receiver. The one solution I found was AirServer. Start this tool on your Mac and it should show up on your iPhone as an Airplay destination.\n", "Q: How do I save iBooks pdf on iPhone to computer so I can delete them from iPhone?

When I first bought the computer I synced my phone then started deleting them from my phone, then they started deleting from the computer.\nWhat did I do wrong?\n\nA: To delete them only from your phone, follow these steps:\n\nIn the upper-right corner of the iBooks window, tap Select.\nScroll to find the item that you want to delete, then tap it.\nIn the upper-left corner of the iBooks window, tap Delete.\nTap Delete This Copy.\n\nIf you tap Delete from All Devices, it will remove it from iCloud, which will cause it to be deleted from all devices (including your computer).\n", "Q: iOS 10 double click home to pay issue iPhone 6s I find that it is virtually impossible to double click from the lock screen to open wallet and make a payment using a iPhone 6s and iOS 10.   \nIf can remember to shift my thumb and use the edge of the thumbnail to double click the home button then all is good.  On the other hand, I find myself fumbling on paying  at a checkout, unlocking and relocking several times. \nThe problem appears to be that with iOS 10 as soon as your thumb hits the home button the phone gets unlocked.  Yet double clicking home to open wallet must be done from the locked state.\nIs there a better way to deal with opening wallet while standing in a checkout line?  Or do I need to teach myself in that case to double click with my thumbnail instead of thumb print?\n\nA: You can change the behaviour of the Home button in iOS 10, although this may reduce the way you'd like to use the new lock screen features in iOS 10.\nTo change the Home button behaviour, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > General > Accessibility\n\n*Scroll to and tap the Home Button setting\n\n*Change the Click Speed and/or Rest Finger to Open settings\n\n\nTest the changes out and see if it works for you.\n\nA: I had this exact question and asked a guy at the Apple store the other day. He mentioned two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a finger you don't have registered to unlock your phone. For example, I have only my thumb and index finger on each hand registered. If I use my middle finger, it won't unlock because it doesn't recognize my fingerprint and give me the time to press it twice. This doesn't work if you have all of your fingers registered, though.\n\n*If you're using Apple Pay, you don't even need to open up your wallet.

It will work perfectly as it was in first Macbook.\nSide note:\nYou can restore your internal \"Macintosh HD\" hard drive to an external hard drive using Disk Utility in Recovery Mode, then boot from your external drive on ANY Mac. This is ideal if you want to switch between your home Mac and work Mac with only carrying 1 external hard drive which you can even encrypt before it gets lost or stolen. (Enable FileVault in System Preferences before restoring/cloning)\n\nA: Assuming that the SSD has an operating system (OS X) installed, then it just means the MacBook Air will boot up from the newly installed SSD and have access to all the apps and files installed on it.\nIt also means the MacBook Air will have all the user settings of the other owner (eg Admin password, user accounts, desktop background image, system preferences, Apple ID, etc.).\nSo, assuming there's nothing wrong with the other SSD, the computer will function perfectly, but it does mean you'll need to change the settings to suit you - unless of course it's now going to be used by the owner of the other MacBook Air.\n", "Q: App downloaded from cousin's Apple ID is greyed out and cannot delete it from iTunes My cousin downloaded an app for me on my iPad Air while using his Apple ID.

I have a brand new Apple Watch Series 1, an iPhone 6 running iOS 10.0.1 public beta, and an early 2011 MacBook Pro with an upgraded AirPort card and Continuity Activation Tool running the latest Sierra public beta. Handoff and AirDrop and other Continuity features have been working fine lately between my phone and my laptop, but how do I get Auto Unlock to work? I tried following these steps for enabling Auto Unlock in general, but System Preferences isn't showing me an \"Allow your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac\" checkbox. How can I make that box appear? Thanks!\n\nA: What hardware is required for Auto Unlock?\nAccording to Apple’s macOS Sierra beta 2 release notes, Auto Lock requires a 2013 or later Mac. That means that even 2012 Macs with Bluetooth 4.0 don’t officially support Auto Unlock.\nWhat software is required for Auto Unlock?\nTo use Auto Unlock, you’ll need to be running macOS Sierra Developer Preview Seed 2. You’ll also need to have the watchOS 3 beta installed on your Apple Watch. Apple indicates that the latest version of watchOS 3 (beta 2) needs to be installed, but I was able to get Auto Unlock working with watchOS 3 beta 1.\nYou’ll also need to have Two-Factor Authentication established for the iCloud account associated with your Mac and Apple Watch.\nHow do I set up Two-Factor Authentication?\nTwo-Factor Authentication can be set up via the Apple ID website. Beware that a small number of users are complaining of being locked out of their accounts when enabling 2FA on the developer beta.\nKeep in mind that Two-Factor Authentication differs from Two-Step Authentication. You must be using Two-Factor Authentication for Auto Unlock to work. If you need assistance, a full guide for enabling Two-Factor Authentication.\nOnce 2FA is enabled, Apple encourages users to do the following:\n\n*\n\n*On your Mac, open System Preferences →  iCloud, and click the Account\nDetails button. Click the Security tab, and make sure Two-Factor\nAuthentication is on. On your iPhone, open Settings →  iCloud and tap\non your name to reveal account details. Tap on the Password and\nSecurity item, and make sure sure Two-Factor Authentication is on.\n\n*On your iPhone, open Watch →  General →  Apple ID, and verify your\nApple ID is showing.\n\n*How do I enable Auto Unlock?\n\nEnabling Auto Unlock is handled on your Mac via System Preferences → Security & Privacy.\nI’m not seeing the Auto Unlock setting in System Preferences\nAfter performing a clean install, it can take minutes for the Allow your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac checkbox to display in System Preferences → Security and Privacy → General on your Mac. This delay occurs while your devices are iCloud pairing. If you performed an upgrade instead of a clean install, you should not experience any delays.\nIf you’re still having problems getting Auto Unlock to work, try rebooting all three devices (Mac, Apple Watch, paired iPhone). Also, double-check to make sure you have Two-Factor Authentication enabled, not Two-Step Authentication.\n", "Q: iOS 10 disable erase all data after 8 failed attempts I was looking trough settings since I've upgraded to iOS 10 and noticed that settings to disable erasing all data after 8 failed passcode is greyed out on enable setting and I cannot disable it or click it.

By shop, I mean one of a number of street shacks in Southeast Asia.\nThe price is less than half the cost of Apple doing it and I'm pretty sure it'll go fine. But I thought I'd check in with you first. What can I check for to see that nothing else has been replaced in the phone? For example, the battery or camera? What else? Is there a way to quickly verify that those things haven't been replaced?\n\nA: If you are implying that the service guy stole or will steal your iPhone parts, they won't. Because the products they do replace it with is actually the real deal, so your parts is not more genuine than the parts you can buy from eBay or Alibaba. The iPhone is made in China, and these China factories sell these items themselves online. I bought a few products from China and compared with the broken items and they were identical. \nApple will obviously overcharge you for the same product and service, because it's Apple :P The guy on the street can't charge as much otherwise he won't get any customers, he needs to stay in the market. If he has a shop in a shopping mall, he can obviously charge more. But the products are the same, they just make more profit.\nTo answer your question, the only way to see if somethings been replaced is to see if the quality is the same. Check if the camera is just as good, battery lasts long, etc. Or open the phone and take before and after photos?\nIf you don't trust anyone, just buy the display from eBay or Alibaba (or iFixit) and fix it yourself with this guide on how to replace the display.

If this information does not match, your enrollment will be delayed and you may be asked to provide a copy of a government issued identification.\n\nA: Sure you can enroll in ADP from a different country, all you'll have to do is that you'll have to have the ability to pay Apple $99/year.\nHowever, the main issue will be submitting your app in the app store and then getting paid for them.\nStripe Atlas may be the only reasonable option for that IMHO. I haven't tested it though.\n", "Q: Is there a way to display audio bitrate in Finder? I want to have a quick and easy way to check bitrate of compressed audio files, without having to open iTunes/Quicktime etc.\nEither a Finder option (Get info/Inspector/List view) or perhaps an AppleScript via Right click > Service would do, via output to Terminal or system pop-up.\nAre there any established solutions out there, or will we have to look at a scripting solution?\n\nA: You could fashion a service in Automator using the Terminal.app and your shell with something like:\nmdls -name kMDItemTotalBitRate file\n\n", "Q: How can I disable Universal Clipboard on macOS and iOS? I've looked into the iCloud settings on both my Mac and iOS, but I can't seem to find an option to disable this feature. Is there a plist entry somewhere that I can use, or is it forced on?\n\nA: Disabling Handoff is currently the only way to disable Universal Clipboard.\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac: Go to System Preferences > General > uncheck Allow Handoff\n\n*iPhone: Go to Settings > General > Handoff > uncheck Handoff  \n\n\nJust so you know, Handoff uses a secure communication channel to transfer information between devices signed into the same Apple ID. \nData does not travel to Apple's servers or even over the internet. Devices advertise availability to each other via Bluetooth and data is transmitted over Wi-Fi, but only on the local network. \n", "Q: How to disable scroll acceleration in macOS Sierra? A few releases ago OS X introduced scroll acceleration, which means if you keep scrolling in some direction, the speed of the scroll will be greater and greater. You cannot disable this from the UI. It is extremely annoying if you want to scroll through a long website or a long source code in an editor.\nUntil macOS Sierra you could disable this using DisableExtremeScrollAcceleration tool. But this tool is no longer working.\nIs there any way to prevent the scroll acceleration?\n\nA: System Preferences>Accessibility>Mouse & Trackpad>Trackpad Options>Scrolling>Without Inertia\n\nA: Try USB Overdrive. I was having the same problem as you and this fixed it. It works with MacOS Sierra.\nCredit to this post\n\nA: I don't have the rep to upvote or comment on Sky D's post, but it was spot on:\nFor trackpad:\nSystem Preferences>Accessibility>Mouse & Trackpad>Trackpad Options>Scrolling>Without Inertia\nFor mouse:\nSystem Preferences>Accessibility>Mouse & Trackpad>Mouse Options>Scrolling>Without Inertia\n\n\nA: After many years of frustration with macOS & wheel mice, I've developed Smooze. You can use this app free for disabling acceleration ( you would only pay to use other features of the app)\n\n*\n\n*toggle the \"Animate Scroll\" to Off and you're good to go.\n\n\nSmooze website\n\nA: macOS Sierra introduced a scroll wheel deadzone where input would be ignored unless you scrolled at a minimum speed. Scrolling the wheel one notch at a time would not produce any movement on the screen. This deadzone made people scroll the wheel faster than before, thus hitting the acceleration threshold even faster (though it's always been there). The scroll wheel deadzone has been removed in the 10.12.2 public betas.\nWith defaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.scrollwheel.scaling -1, there should be no scroll wheel acceleration in apps (that use native scrolling).\n\nA: I found the \"fix\" for my Logitech mouse.\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences\n\n*Control Center (available when you install Logitech control center)\n\n*Select your mouse and click \"configure\".\n\n*Select mouse wheel.\n\n*On the bottom, there is a \"acceleration\" label with a slider. Set it to \"null\" or \"max\" (I can't see the difference.)\n\n\nI also had an issue with my back/forward buttons. Within the same control panel, I had to reconfigure them as \"key strokes\" of \"cmd + left arrow\" and \"cmd + right arrow\".\nEdit: Logitech released an updated version of their control center, which fixes the issue. \n\nA: Here's what I've found, so far it seems kinda working:\nhttp://dolphm.com/disable-mouse-pointer-acceleration-and-scroll-wheel-acceleration-in-os-x/\nType into the Terminal:\ndefaults write .GlobalPreferences com.apple.scrollwheel.scaling -1\n\nThen relogin.\n\nA: I wrote a small program to fix this behavior: https://github.com/emreyolcu/discrete-scroll\nYou may download a binary here. It runs in the background and allows you to scroll 3 lines with each tick of the wheel.\n\nA: Alternatively you can use SteerMouse. I've been using this for a few years.  It costs $20, but for me it was worth it.  Default mouse acceleration settings always annoy me.\nAnyway, after install:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open it up via System Preferences -> SteerMouse.\n\n*Select the 'Scroll' tab.\n\n*Click 'Roll Up, and in the next dialog choose Mode = Linear.\n\n*Do the same for 'Roll Down'.\n\n\nPics below:\n\n\n", "Q: What happens to my data if I cancel my iCloud Storage subscription? I have a plan of $0.99/month. Now I want to cancel my subscription.\nI have 30GB of iCloud Data. I don't know what happen with all my data in iCloud. Will I still be able to get access, or it will be deleted once I cancel my subscription?\n\nA: According to this Apple iCloud Support page:\n\nIf you downgrade your storage plan and your content exceeds the storage you have available, new photos and videos won't upload to iCloud Photo Library and your devices will stop backing up to iCloud.\niCloud Drive and iCloud-enabled apps won’t update across your devices, and you won't be able to send or receive messages with your iCloud email address.\nTo use iCloud after exceeding your available storage, remove backups, photos, documents, or email messages you don’t need. You can access photos, videos, and documents for 30 days after you delete or disable iCloud Photo Library and iCloud Drive.\n\n\nA: This is the message Apple emailed when my 50 GB storage was cancelled.\n\nYou have used up all of your 5 GB of free iCloud storage.\nAll the photos, videos and documents that are currently in iCloud will still be stored safely, but any new ones will not be saved to there.

I just got a new macbook pro (used to use a dual boot linux/windows system). I'm still getting used to some of the features. \nOne thing I've noticed is when an application is open, it would show in the dock at the bottom of the screen and there would be a dot below the icon indicating that it is open. WHen open instances of the same app is open, there is no visible indication of how many instances are open. Is there any way to enable this? For example if I had 3 google chromes open, I'd like to be able to see in the dock that there are 3 open without having to right click on the icon. Perhaps 3 dots would show instead of one dot?\n\nA: Apple only provides Mission Control (ctrl↑) and Application Windows (formerly Exposé: ctrl↓) for window management. Yes, this was (and still is) my least favorite change after switching to macOS.\nUnder  → System Preferences → Dock, you may also uncheck Minimize windows into application icon to avoid “losing” minimized windows, but this can quickly clutter your Dock.\n", "Q: Make OS X Partition active from Windows I have recently noticed, that I needed more space on my Bootcamp drive, so I unallocated 10 GiB in macOS using DiskPart. After that I rebooted into Windows and used \"MiniTool Partition Wizard\" to assign that space to the Windows partition.\nIt rebooted and expanded the partition as I expected, but afterwards I wasn't able to boot into my macOS again. It is cleary still there, but it seems, that I have to set a flag to make it bootable again.\nAlso booting into Recovery Mode doesn't work anymore - it's loading very, very slowly and gets stuck at 100% (I even left my notebook over night).\nDoes anyone know, how to set this flag using Windows?\n\n\nA: I have fixed this issue myself, using a tool called gdisk. I converted the partition table back to GPT. The only problem now is, that i can see the recovery partition from the normal system and i can't really boot to it. No big deal for me, because I can use my mac normally again.\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot to Internet Recovery by holding option-command-r on boot until the globe is shown.\n\n*In Terminal within Recovery, run the following:\nINPUT=$(printf  \"e  1\\nee\\n\\n1\\n\\nq\\ny\")\ndiskutil  unmountdisk  /dev/disk0\nfdisk  -e  /dev/disk0  <<<\"$INPUT\"  &>/dev/null\n\nFor more information, see the source of the commands and other answers to try in Accidently deleted some small sized partitions when installing Windows.

At work I use an iMac which I'm going to have to reset to factory settings after my job ends. Since I only have access to slow, unstable internet, I thought it might save some time to download the El Capitan installer from the App Store in advance and create a bootable installer drive, rather than using internet recovery.\nAfter I (erase the drive and) use the bootable installer to reinstall the operating system, will the resulting installation be associated with my Apple ID in any way? Or more generally, will it have any personal information associated with me? I'd like to leave a completely fresh, un-personalized installation of OS X for whoever is going to use the computer next.\n\nA: If by reinstall the OS, you simply mean reinstall it and not run first-time setup, the resulting installation will not be associated with you in any way.\nIf you intend to run first-time setup, obviously do not login with your Apple ID during that process, and of course don't input any personally-identifiable information either.\nThere is metadata in a receipt file in the installer file itself that is associated with your Apple ID. That is not transferred to the resulting installation, though.\n", "Q: What's the correct way to back up all Photos from the Photos app? I downloaded the macOS Sierra (GM) and installed it on my MacBook. Before I installed it a backed up all my data that isn't stored in the cloud or somewhere else.\nI'm using iCloud Photos to sync all my photos and videos with iCloud. Every photo and video is already in iCloud so I may don't need to back up my Photos library, but I did - just in case something goes wrong.\nSo I wiped off all the data from my MacBook to do a complete and clean installation of Sierra. Finally everything works fine and I'm going to get all my photos and videos back to the Photos app.\nMy backup of my photos and videos has ~13GB and I really have a slow internet connection, so it would be nice if I could use the backed up library instead of downloading everything from iCloud.\nAs soon as I open my library with Photos it starts importing and optimizing etc. and all photos and videos are there. But it starts uploading every single photo and video to iCloud? How can I tell Photos that my photos and videos are already in iCloud and it should stop uploading?\n\nA: The Photos app in macOS Sierra is able to do a comparison between what is in the cloud, and what is stored in the local library on your Mac. (Likely through some means of signature/hash function).\nTo provide some insight with actual numbers - My Photos library is approximately 53GB, and only required about ~1.5GB worth of bandwidth to validate/sync the library after migrating the library to a different Mac with a fresh install of macOS Sierra (1.5GB includes any photos that it also needed to sync since the last my library was active). \nWith that being said, you can be confident that your bandwidth limitation, or capacity, should not have to handle the full file size. However, be mindful that if there are other cloud services (iCloud Drive) they too can utilize bandwidth.\n\nA: The correct way is exactly as you did it. Photos.app should determine that the photos are identical to the ones already in the cloud. A limited amount of data may be used to accomplish this, but it should not use anywhere near the size of your whole library.\n", "Q: Somebody used my Apple ID on a new iPod touch One of my friends got this error on his iPhone (this is the translation of message in English) :\n\nYour Apple ID and telephone number are in use in iMessage on a new iPod touch.\n\nThere is no iPod touch so someone used the account.

Again, I can toggle the extension manually with Shift + Alt + U, but the script won't do it,\nI also tried this:\ntell application \"Google Chrome\" to keystroke \"u\" using {option down, shift down}\n\nIs the script actually supposed to work, making the problem reside somewhere else, or is there something wrong in it?\n\nA: Try this code instead.\ntell application \"Google Chrome\" to activate\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"u\" using {option down, shift down}\ndelay(1)\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"r\" using command down\n\nI actually ran this applescript along with yours. First time I did not test yours seeing you called for a key code but gave it a keystroke value. When I ran your code, it gave me syntax errors(even with proper key code and keystroke values). When I ran my code, it compiles properly and runs the script as intended. \n", "Q: Open AppleWorks spreadsheets in Mac OS X when Numbers won't work I have a number of old AppleWorks spreadsheets that I'm trying to open.  I've tried a number of solutions that I've found while searching for an answer (below), but none of them really get me to where I want to be.  Anyone know of a simple solution?\n1. Open in Numbers.app\nWhen I try to open them in Numbers.app, I get the following error.  I think the issue may be that these documents were not made in the final version of AppleWorks (many are so old they were made when it was still called ClarisWorks).\n\nImport Error\nThe document was created with an unsupported version of AppleWorks.\n\n2. Use an old Mac to convert them to the most recent version of AppleWorks, then use Numbers.app\nUnfortunately I don't have an old Mac to do this with.\n3. Use some hacky solution to extract text from the files\nI was able to open the file with text editors, but I'm aiming to keep the formatting and functionality and not spend lots of time parsing text.\n\nA: These files will open just fine in LibreOffice. Mac OS X (tested on OS X 10.11.5) does recognize that each of the files I want to open is an \"AppleWorks Document\" (as can be seen in the \"Kind\" column in Finder.app), but it does not know that LibreOffice can open it.\nAfter you've downloaded and installed LibreOffice, there are a few more steps to get them open:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the AppleWorks document you want to open.\n\n*From the contextual menu's \"Open With\" submenu, select \"Other…\".\n\n\nThis will open the \"Choose Application\" window.  In that window:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the \"Enable\" pulldown menu, select \"All Applications\".\n\n*If you want LibreOffice to automatically open this document going forward, check \"Always Open With\".\n\n*Select LibreOffice.  You'll get a warning staying that \"It's not known if this application can open\" the document. Don't worry about that!\n\n*Click \"Open\".\n\n\nYou should now be looking at a well-formatted spreadsheet in LibreOffice. It looks like the original formatting has been maintained; the spreadsheets I opened have colors, italic, bold, etc.\nOnce you've got it open in LibreOffice, from the \"File\" menu select \"Save As\" and you'll have the option to save it in any number of supported formats, such as Excel. Once that's done, your AppleWorks spreadsheet data has been brought into the modern world.\nIf you always want AppleWorks docs to open with LibreOffice, follow these instructions.\n\nA: LibreOffice works great on old Appleworks spreadsheets. I had to open them directly (rather than drag-and-drop), a tiny issue.

I just got an iPhone 7 Plus and noticed that the EarPod's cable is much longer than the one I had with the iPhone 6s.\nDo both the iPhone 7 and the 7 Plus come with longer earphone cables than the 6s and the 6s Plus?\n\nA: You've answered your own question - if you see that they are longer, then they are obviously shipped with longer headphones - but for everyone else, I compared them.\nThe distance from the cord split to the ends of the headphones is the same; however, the distance from the edge of the connector to the split is approximately two inches longer on the iPhone 7 (Lightning connector) EarPods than on the iPhone 6s EarPods.\n\n\nA: yes. It is longer for both iPhone 7 and 7 plus.\n", "Q: Associating Protocol handler in Mac OS X Many tools support an item link feature using protocol; with a given link, I can open the page with the tool that created it. \nFor example, I can open the DEVONthink page that I made: \nopen -a \"DEVONthink Pro.app\" x-devonthink-item://2AD2E3D2-58B5-455F-99D4-C91D68C5F959\n\nCan I teach Mac OS X that the x-devonthink-item is the \"DEVONthink\" protocol to make the command like this? \nopen \"x-devonthink-item://2AD2E3D2-58B5-455F-99D4-C91D68C5F959\"\n\n\nA: Protocol handlers are registered with OS X in application bundles (specifically, in the info.plist file in the bundle's Contents directory). This should be done by the application that supports it. In other words, you should be able to straight-up run the second command and have it open DEVONthink. Based on this page it sounds like that's how it works, but you say it doesn't, so there's a relatively easy way to do it for any program.\nIf not, or if you just want to register your own handler, here are some steps (modified from Launching External Applications using Custom Protocols under OSX).\nCreate an AppleScript file that contains the following.\non open location this_URL\n    do shell script \"open -a 'Applications/DEVONthink Pro.app' this_URL\"\nend open location\n\nOn the second line, you are defining what should happen when your protocol is called. this_URL will be the full URL entered (on the command line or elsewhere), including the protocol. In your case, you want to pass the whole URL including x-devonthink-item into DEVONthink. If you were creating your own protocol, you might only want to pass part of the string, so keep that in mind.\nSave the AppleScript as an Application bundle. Once saved, find it on disk, right-click on it, and choose Show Package Contents. Inside the Contents folder there will be a file called info.plist. Open this in a text editor (not TextEdit, as it will almost certainly screw up the file format).\nAt the bottom of the file will be\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nDirectly above this, add the following:\n    <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>\n    <string>org.personal.dttrick</string>\n    <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>\n    <array>\n        <dict>\n            <key>CFBundleURLName</key>\n            <string>Pass To DEVONthink</string>\n            <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>\n            <array>\n                <string>x-devonthink-item</string>\n            </array>\n        </dict>\n    </array>\n\nSave and double-click on your app. Nothing should happen, and that's fine - but in the background, it's registered the protocol with the OS.\nFinally, back in Terminal, run your desired command:\nopen \"x-devonthink-item://2AD2E3D2-58B5-455F-99D4-C91D68C5F959\"\n\nDEVONthink should open with the specified item. I don't have DEVONthink and couldn't test it; I am relying on the command you originally provided as working. If not, you'll need to modify the shell script in the AppleScript to reflect what the actual command needs to be.\n", "Q: Download all music in Apple Music library (iOS 10) I just got a new phone on iOS 10 and I have an Apple Music subscription. I have the setting turned on to automatically download music when it is added, but all the existing music in my library hasn't downloaded. Is there a way to make it download everything, or do I have to do it manually album by album?\n\nA: This isn't a perfect solution but it kinda works. On the Mac make a smart playlist that matches everything in your library. \n\nThen on the iPhone, download that playlist for offline use. \n", "Q: How to permanently disable resume on El Capitan Notice: This is not a duplicate! Other questions had to do with older versions of OS X or had to do with temporarily disabling resume.\nEl Capitan has made my iMac very, very slow. A hard reboot should clean the slate so I can recover from OS hangs, but now windows and programs that were open when I shut the iMac down (with the power button) are restored to their previous states.\nHow can I disable this completely?

I am trying to put it and an old version of QuarkXpress on an old 40 GB external hard drive.  I need access to both to open up some old important files.\nWhat are my options?\n\nA: Option 1: Run OS9 Emulator and install QuarkXpress:\nFound here for free: emaculation.com\nOption 2: Change filename to work on current QuarkXpress:\nAssuming you have QuarkXpress on your new mac all you have to do is add the .qxp filename extension at the end of your old filenames and it will open on new versions.\n", "Q: Charger will only charge for a few seconds before needing replugging I use a clone charger wire for the iPhone. It looks very similar to an OEM version but is slightly different.\nWhen I first started using it, upon closer inspection, I noticed that the metal connection end was a bit angled (when viewed sideways). I applied pressure to make the metal bit stick straight out.\nFirst of all, I feel kinda stupid since it worked fine even though it was bent.\nNow the thing only charges my phone for a few seconds before:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone says this accesory may not be supported\n\n*iPhone acts as if I just pulled the charger from the port and stops charging\n\n\nAll while it's still plugged in and supposed to be charging.\nWhat is wrong with the cable?\nEdit: I accidentally dropped my iPhone while plugged in. The metal bit just bent like 30 degrees. I carefully bent it back into place.\n\nA: More than likely, you broke the lightning connector solder joints on its PCB\n\nWhen you dropped your iPhone and bent your connector, you weakened the solder joints (yellow box).  When you bent it back, it probably broke the joint enough where it makes a very poor connection to no connection at all.\nIt's time for a new cable.\n", "Q: Why can't I shuffle songs within a specific album under the latest version of iTunes 12.5.1.21? Prior to the update, I was able to select the \"Shuffle Songs\" button in the upper-mid Information Bar, click on a specific song in an album and then hear a mix of songs only from that album.\nFor example: If I clicked on a song from the album L.A. Woman and I had shuffle enabled, I would only hear other songs from that album.\nUnder the current version, If I select a song from L.A Woman, I will get that one song and then a mix of songs from my entire library.\nIn this example, the next song might be from Frank Sinatra, the Dead Kennedys, or anything else.\nHow do I disable this \"feature?\" \nI don't want to have to click \"Shuffle Album\" to hear the songs shuffled. \nOften I will start with one song I want to hear, hear another song from the random shuffle on the album, and then select a new song to hear from the same album\n\nA: Select Control > Shuffle\nIn the drop down/slide out menu check 'Album' instead of 'Songs'\n", "Q: Can the text message field in iOS 10 Messages be moved to be more friendly to left-handed users? I have noticed that with iOS 10 Messages that the text message field is in a very inconvenient place for left-handed users.\n\nAs you can see, the lesser-used photo, gestures, and store button are in easy reach of the left-handed user's dominant thumb while the frequently-used text message field is far away from it. The inverse is true for right-handed users.\nIs there any way to changed this so that the text message field is under a left-handed user's thumb? Perhaps as an accessibility option?\n\nA: No, there's no documentation from Apple that indicates whether or not the buttons in Messages can be moved to the opposite site.  This is actually a good opportunity for the app development or jailbreak tweaking community.\nI would recommend contacting Apple and giving them your feedback.  \n", "Q: Mac starts up automatically My Mac OS X El Capitan seems to start up on its own, out of the blue. Even though I have powered it off. It starts at random.\nI do not have any startup program or anything scheduled for this to happen. Any insights?

For the last few days, my MacBook started to sleep when I change the inclination angle of the lid. On repeated pressing of the Shutdown button, it wakes up. \nHas anyone else experienced this? Does anyone know the root cause?\n\nA: Usually it comes down to one of a few things. Here are a few based on the info there is to go on.\nReset the System Management Controller \nTo resolve nearly every power related issue on a Mac you can reset the SMC (or System Management Controller0. This will dump and reset settings for anything power management related, and is long known to resolve problems with things like fans, heat, sleep problems, display issues, etc.\nOn any modern MacBook Pro or MacBook Air with a built-in battery, which is just about all of them nowadays, this is how you do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the Mac and connect it to your MagSafe adapter and a wall\noutlet as usual\n\n*Hold down the Shift+Control+Option+Power button at the same time for 5 seconds.\n\n*Release all keys at the same time\n\n*Boot the Mac as usual\n\n\nTry a PRAM/NVRAM Reset\nIf the above trick failed, a PRAM reset can at times do the trick, and this is done upon restarting the Mac similar to an SMC reset:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot the Mac and as soon as you hear the boot chime, hold and keep down the Command+Option+P+R keys together\n\n*When you hear the boot sound again, the PRAM has been reset so you can now let go of the keys and let the Mac boot up again as usual\n\n\nLastly, it can be hardware that is beginning to fail or failing.\nA good way to check is by running Apple Diagnostics located on your computer.\nThere is a process in which it should be run and you can read the full documentation at Apple's website.\n", "Q: Cannot setup two-factor authentication I'm trying to set up 2FA on my iCloud account but I get this message:\n\nAny ideas on a solution? There's also no option in the security settings on my iPhone to enable it. I'm running the latest versions of iOS and macOS.\n\nA: Thought I'd share because I went down the rabbit hole on this and it turned out pretty simple.  \nI was not able to turn on two factor authenication because I had a couple of old apple devices (an old iphone 4 i was using for music and a phone that hadn't been charged in 5 years) that DID NOT HAVE A PASSCODE ENABLED. \nApple wasn't able to turn on two factor unless every device on my appleid account had a password set.  \nI just deleted from my account and it worked.  This took a week of back and forth with (a very nice) apple rep. \nGood luck!\n\nA: Had the same issue.\nIn my case I apparently missed/junked/deleted the verification email sent to me by Apple.  A call into support and they resent the email and I was good to go.\nBefore you call a quick search of your email for appleid@id.apple.com might save you some time.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: If you have enabled two-step-verification you need to disable it first. \nGo to your AppleID website, login and edit the security section.

I wonder if photos (stored in iCloud Photo Library) are stored locally until local space runs out. From what I have read there is no persistant storage, only caching. Kind of like on the iPhone with the most recent photos available offline (depending on the amount of local storage available).\nSome background: I would like to have photos on my Apple TV and take the unit with me when I visit friends and parents. There hook it up to the TV and enjoy the photos together with everyone.\nThis would also affect my buying decision which version to get (32 or 64 GB). Having to download the photos (and videos!) on the spot would be quite the show-stopper.\nI would be very grateful if any of the owners in here could check and verify if iCloud Library photos are stored locally on the Apple TV.\nThank you so much for any help in this matter and help me find the right model for me.\n\nA: Nothing built into the system or available via the app store lets you have safe long-term purely local storage without a cloud backup.\nApps that pass the approval process have a few kinds of data, but for any significant data, they can be broken into two groups: data that's marked as \"cached\", and data that's marked as \"backed by iCloud\".\nBoth kinds of data can be deleted by the OS without any warning.\nData that's marked as \"cached\" is deleted when that happens. \nData that's marked as \"backed by iCloud\" will be re-loaded from iCloud (possibly from a local caching server on your network if you have one) the next time you need it -- but also takes up part of your iCloud storage quota (even if you have a local caching server).\nIf you want to load content for offline usage, and you're not expecting to be able to play it back again a week later after doing other stuff on the device, then the \"cache\" type data is probably fine work for you.\nOtherwise, you need to either store the data on a server somewhere (possibly as simple as a thumb drive plugged into an off-the-shelf router), or you need to sideload an app that breaks Apple's appstore rules.\n", "Q: Inverse trigonometric functions in Calculator Is there a way to calculate inverse trigonometric functions in El Capitan's Calculator (ie. arcsine, arccosine, arctangent, etc.)? I've tried the usual alt, cmd, ctrl modifiers with the sin/cos/tan buttons to no avail. I'm especially annoyed because Spotlight does calculate arctangents and the result is claimed to come from Calculator itself, so I don't know if they dumbed the interface down or what.\nExamples of operations that work from Spotlight but I have no clue how to do from Calculator:\natan(1)  # arctangent of 1 in radians\natand(1) # arctangent of 1 in degrees\n\n\nA: To calculate atan() and atand() in Calculator under OS X El Capitan, do the following…\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Calculator.\n\n*Press command2 on the  Mac’s keyboard, to show the Scientific Calculator.\n\n*To calculate inverse trigonometric functions, click the 2nd button (left side, second row, first button) on the calculator (or you can press and hold the shift key on the Mac’s keyboard during a given operation) in order to change the tan button to display as: tan -1\n\n*To change between calculating degrees and radians, toggle the button in the lower left corner of the Scientific Calculator between Deg and Rad.\n\n\n*\n\n*The default is to calculate degrees and the Rad button is shown.\n\n*To  calculate radians, click the Rad button so it shows Deg.

After you hear the boot chime, you know you will have successfully entered Single User Mode because you will see a bunch of white text on a black background scroll by.\nWhen the Single User boot sequence has finished, you’ll find a small command prompt at the bottom of the screen prefixed by a hash sign (#), when you see that type the following command exactly:\nfsck -fy\n\nOnce fsck completes, if you see a “File system was modified” message, then you should run “fsck -fy” again until you see a message stating “The volume (name) appears to be OK” – this is standard procedure of using fsck.\nType “reboot” to leave Single User Mode and boot the Mac back into OS X as usual.\nOnce OS X is booted again, it can be a good idea to confirm all is well by going back to Disk Utility and running the “Verify” tool to check on the drive's health.\nIf the above does not work\nI hate to share this with you, but I have never seen a fix for this, other than connect the drive to another Mac and recover any files you can access at this point. \n95% chance a reformat is the only solution. \nTry to save what you can and hopefully there are no important files on the drive. \n", "Q: Unable to use auto layout (ctrl + drag) on xcode after some time of using I am having a problem with Xcode. It works correctly but sometimes after a period of using it, when I ctrl + drag an element on Interface Builder autoLayout popup shows and disappears immediately. Also, when I want to set constraints manually, I can't do that, because every single click is recognized as a double click as shown in the gifs below.\nI tried to find the cause of this, but I can't. To solve it I have to restart /logout every time which is annoying. I observed that in most cases this starts when I connect external monitor to my MBP and use Xcode on that screen.\n\n\n\nA: Another person, had this same problem where performance plummeted on an external display.\nWhat I ended up discovering was that the external monitor issue was indicating that there was a UIView that interface builder couldn't quite figure out properly for auto-layout.\nIn his case it was a UIToolbarBarItem that contained a UIView that contained a UILabel. Once I removed the offending UIToolbarBarItem the performance issue resolved itself. It went from being completely unusable to smooth scrolling.\nYou should check if you have a UIView inside something that might cause auto-layout to perform poorly.\n", "Q: What data can only be migrated to a new iOS device using backup and restore? I think this will be a useful community wiki reference: excluding device settings, what iOS user data (the kind of data that is created and stored over time) can only be migrated to a new device through the use of iCloud/iTunes Backup and Restore from Backup?\nThis can be relevant to anyone buying a new iPhone or other device to replace an old one — if you decide to set the new device up as a \"New iPhone\", even though you had data on an old iPhone Backup, you will immediately start creating two streams of data that cannot be merged without using 3rd party tools.\nThis contrasts with data that can be re-downloaded to a new phone after logging in with an Apple ID (iTunes app/music/video purchases, iCloud Mail/Contacts/Calendars/Drive), as well as data that can be migrated piecemeal using iTunes (app documents).\n\nA: Apple Watch Data\nAs this support article indicates, the only way to pair an Apple Watch with a new phone and maintain continuity of your data is to restore the new phone from a backup.\n\nA: Health Data\nThe Health app provides a way to export all data in XML format, but the very same app offers no bulk import functionality from this XML format. Health data is included in iCloud/iTunes backups.\n\nA: Messages\niMessages are distributed using end-to-end device-specific encryption, so it is not possible for message history to be redistributed to a new device.

I already have a 2' monitor attached and I want to know if I get a GTX 970 and attach it with one of these things (Using thunderbolt) if it will function properly and that I'm not burning $600 for something my computer can't handle.\n\nA: Unfortunately not, your Macbook doesn't have Thunderbolt, only Mini DisplayPort. For best results, your mac should have Thunderbolt 2 to take full advantage of the speeds.\n\nBy the way, I have Macbook 2011 and I had 2x Thunderbolt displays at 2560x1440 with my integrated HD3000 512mb without a problem. But it was fast as hell when I added a SATA3 SSD with 560mbps read. Hard drives are bottlenecking! :)\n", "Q: What is “Protocol Capability Request” and how to resolve? I try to activate an Apple iPhone 4 CDMA but my carrier says:\n\nAs per our technical team confirmation received, the device is not able to send the MEID in response to \"Protocol Capability Request\" message requested by OTAF during *228 call, might be the device is not supporting MEID and is supported only ESN (Old 8 digit). Though the MEID/pESN is written on the device but in actual it is ESN based device, as this is an open market device.\n\nI don't know what I have to do now.

My computer runs Yosemite and has no working internal Bluetooth chip.\nI therefore connect a Bluetooth adapter through USB.\nRecently, this USB Bluetooth adapter broke. I bought a new one, and inserted that instead.\nThe interesting thing is that my previously paired devices still appear in a list, but they are not paired anymore. Instead, I get an option to pair them again.\n\nMy theory is that this happens because the USB Bluetooth adapter has some sort of ID number or something and that the devices are paired to that, not the computer itself. \nIs this true? If yes, what is this ID number called?\n\nA: Every Bluetooth \"thing\", for lack of a better word, has a unique identifier. If it didn't, devices wouldn't be able to differentiate from one another. Walk down the street with AirPods here in a month or two and without a unique device identifier, you would get everybody else's music/conversations/whatever coming through your AirPods as you got within ~30 feet of them.\nYour paired devices are still in that list because your computer remembers devices that were previously paired to it.\n", "Q: Removing Internet Account without losing old messages in Messages App I use Gmail and Messages app on OS X.

If I go to remove the Gmail Internet Account, I get a warning:\n\nDeleting this account will remove its data from Mail, Messages.\n\nI realize that I can simply disable the account, but I want to remove it all together while preserving the historical messages.\n\nA: Here are the instructions for Messages and Gmail.\nBacking up Gmail / Any or All of your Google Products Data\nGoogle Takeout: The simplest of the backup snapshot offerings is the one provided by Google: Google Takeout. From your Google settings, you can export just about all of your Google data, across all your Google applications. Google Takeout dumps the data either into your Google Drive or lets you download a pile of ZIP files. It's easy, comprehensive, and free.\nCreate an archive with your data from any or all of your Google products.  https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout\nLocate your Messages archive\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Messages app, go to Messages > Preferences.\n\n*Check the \"Save history when conversations are closed\" box.\n\n*In the Finder, head to the Go menu and select Go to Folder.\n\n\nType in ~/Library/Messages\nYou should see two folders: Archive and Attachments along with a file database labeled \"chat.db\".\nArchive holds all your past messages from conversations that you've closed or saved; Attachments holds all the images and video from those conversations. The chat.db holds all the information from your active message history.\nArchived conversations are labeled pretty clearly: They're all in folders labeled by date closed, and individual files give you the name of the participant along with the date and time. Open one, and you'll see the conversation pop up in Messages. \nYou can't edit, search, or export conversations to a different format, but you can copy and paste sentences and load it through the Messages App while having an archive. \n", "Q: What does this button do in the iTunes device sync status bar? When an iPhone is plugged in and syncing, the status bar shows a message like:\n\nSyncing \"Phone\" (Step 2 of 6)\n\nOn the left side of the bar there is this icon:\n\nIt darkens when clicked, which implies that it's a button. If I had to guess from the icon alone, I would say \"rotate clockwise\", but that doesn't make sense in this context.\nHovering does not display a tooltip. Clicking it does not have any visible effect.\nWhat is this button?\n\nA: It is the skip button for skipping the current process. The button usually only shows on skippable actions and is most commonly shown for an iOS device iTunes backup.\n", "Q: Swimming workout on \"original\" Apple Watch watchOS 3 introduced a new workout type, swimming. However, this seems to be available only on the new series 2 Apple Watch. \nIs there a way to start a swimming workout on the old Apple Watch (not Series 1, the original from 2015)\n\nA: No.\nAlso the original Apple Watch is not made for swimming - it probably won't survive it if you take it swimming every week. The water will simply get in and destroy it.\nI would advise buying the new watch for this purpose.\n", "Q: Is there an Iphone key logger for non-jail broken phones? I would like to know if a key logger can be installed on a non-jail broken IPhone?\nThanks\n\nA: In the practical sense, yes you can. You can use an exploit for the iPhone software to gain access to install the keylogger. If you want me to tell you how, I can't/won't.\nOn the nitpicky \"theoretical\" side - no, you cannot. If you use an exploit for the iPhone to gain access to install the keylogger, you could say that you have really jail-broken the iPhone. Thus you cannot install a keylogger on a non-jail broken iPhone.\n", "Q: Which are the ways to access \"Now Playing\" in WatchOS 3? I make use of the Now Playing view on Apple Watch to switch between songs playing on my iPhone's Soundcloud app.\n\nHowever, I haven't yet found a satisfying (fast) way to access this view.\nIn WatchOS 3, the only way I know of is to click the \"Dock\" button on the side, and then swipe through the active apps to the location of Now Playing, and then click it. I think it's cumbersome.\nI was hoping that there would be a complication to access this view, but for some reason Apple hasn't included one.\nThere is a Music complication, and once in that app, there is a \"Now Playing\" button. But strangely it doesn't seem to be linked to what's playing on my iPhone at the moment, even when I've set the Source to my iPhone. Perhaps this \"Now Playing\" function is reserved for Apple Music only.\nSo, my question is, what are the possible ways to access the Now Playing view? Is there something I'm missing?\n\nA: As of watchOS 4, you have a few options for accessing the Now Playing screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set the Dock Ordering setting for the Dock (Watch App on iPhone > Dock) to Favorites and choose the Now Playing \"app\" as one of your Favorites\n\n*Add the Now Playing complication to a watch face (unfortunately, it's only available for Complication sections that are big enough to show the title of what's playing)\n\n\nI actually included this in a roundup of things I think should work with Siri on the Apple Watch but don't.\n\nA: Update the wake screen setting to show the last used app.\nGo to General > Wake Screen > On Screen Wake show Last app on the iPhone App.\nYou can choose from options include session, 8 minute, 1 hour, always.\nNow the watch always wakes up to the now playing screen.\n", "Q: Kextual Healing: How can I remove Kexts that appear on startup? On my Mac I have a load of Kexts appearing that read like this (there are 14 or so):\n\nThe system extension \"/System/Library/Extensions/BJUSBLoad.kext\" was installed improperly and cannot be used...\n\nNow they didn't start appearing after I consciously did anything, and I've read various threads about it elsewhere. I wonder if there is a programming solution here (using Terminal, perhaps) - something that will suppress the kexts? They mostly seem to relate to hp printer drivers, that sort of thing. Stuff I never use.\nNone of them seem to relate to things in my Login Items in System Preferences.\nAfter discussing this on StackOverflow, I received some advice to run kextutil -n on them:\nkextutil -n /System/Library/Extensions/BJUSBLoad.kext\n\nSo I did that, and got this: \n\n/System/Library/Extensions/BJUSBLoad.kext - dependency 'com.apple.kernel.libkern' not found. Diagnostics for /System/Library/Extensions/BJUSBLoad.kext: Warnings: Personality CFBundleIdentifier differs from containing kext's (not necessarily a mistake, but rarely done): IJ170b...etc. \n\nThe message goes on, and ends like this: \n\nKext has no executable or compatible version, so it should not declare any OSBundleLibraries.\n  Code Signing Failure: not code signed\n\nAny idea why or what I need to do?\n\nA: See this Apple Support Communities thread - it addresses your exact problem (specifically, this response). \nIf you still have issues, prevent the kext from loading by using sudo + kextunload instead of kextutil. For example: \nsudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/BJUSBLoad.kext \n\nkextutil would be appropriate for debugging purposes (corrupted, missing dependencies, deprecated, etc) in the hopes of repairing it. kextunload is the tool you are looking for - see the man page for more info on it. \n", "Q: How does Safari name the 'Apple Touch Icon' files? The touch icon files used in Safari are stored on a mac in the folder ~/Library/Safari/Touch Icons, and each file in a .png file, with what seems to be an arbitrary name.\nBy swapping an image in this folder, I can change the image displayed in Safari in the bookmarks bar.  However, I can't do the same for the bookmarks without an image already in the folder.\nDoes anyone know how Safari names these files, and how it connects a bookmark to this image?\n\nA: If you bookmark a page that shows an icon for it under the Bookmarks menu, it (the image) is stored in the ~/Library/Safari/WebpageIcons.db file, which is an SQLite version 3 database. Images stored within the database can be in different formats, e.g. .ico, .png, etc.\nIf you really want to change the icon, that's in the database, I've done it with DB Browser for SQLite.\n\nA: The PNG files are named using a MD5 hash of the website URL. For example, the name for the Google image is stored by hashing www.google.com to get 0A137B375CC3881A70E186CE2172C8D1.png\n", "Q: Smaller Album artwork in iTunes 12.5.1.21? I have hundreds of different albums in my iTunes library and would like to see as many of them as I can while still remaining in windowed mode. Unfortunately, iTunes does not have a clear option to display albums in a smaller format.\nI have gone under Preferences and selected \"List View\" as Smallest and I have also tried using Command-J to select View Options but neither has had any impact.\nHow can I make these unnecessarily large album cover icons smaller so that I don't have to scroll through the equivalent of several pages to see my entire library?\n\n\nA: I don't think there is anyway you can make them smaller.  The Grid view, in Album View, I think is inoperable to size change.  For me, I like larger album covers so I deleted the microphones in Artist view (and Artist view itself) and use List in the Album View.  Of course, I can expand to about 14\" x 14\".  The only smaller album coverwork are the microphones but they seem to be controlled by the iTunes Store box sets, so many people have missing artwork---and lots of microphones.  That's why I eliminated them. \n", "Q: Music Home Sharing not visible in iOS 10 How do I access Home Sharing for Music in iOS10? I'd like to stream music from my Mac iTunes Library.\nWhen I go to the Music app, there are no contents:\n\nHome Sharing is active in iTunes on my Mac serving the audio. I can see the Library contents using the Remote app, and I can also access the Mac Library from another Mac.\nHome Sharing is active on my iPhone, I'm logged into my Apple ID in my iOS Settings > Music.\n\nHas this feature been removed, or is there something I'm missing here? This Apple support page, last updated May 2016, says it should be possible in what appears to be iOS 9.\n\nA: I hadn't actually opened the Music app since I upgraded to iOS 10, but I did so to see what I could find for this question. On the main screen, I immediately have a Home Sharing option, and tapping on it goes to a screen with my computer's name. See screenshot below.\nI'd suggest logging out of Home Sharing on your iPhone, waiting 15 minutes, and logging back in. Also make sure you're running the latest version of iTunes (12.1.5.21 as of this writing).\n\n\nA: Also make sure computer where library is is not sleeping or home sharing option does not seem to appear on IOS device. \n", "Q: Is my iPhone bugged? Is there any way to determine if a non jail broken iPhone is bugged?, is it even possible to bug a non jail broken iPhone?\nThanks\n\nA: Yes, there are ways - though detection depends on what kind of bug we're talking about.\nIs it possible to bug a non jail-broken iPhone: Yes.\nRemember that a bug does not have to be in software - it could possibly also be in hardware. It also doesn't have to be in the actual phone, it could be placed in the cell network or in your providers systems.\nIn order to detect bugging, you could use equipment to scan for out of the ordinary radio emissions. You would also need to use a tool such as Wireshark to monitor network transmissions from the phone.\nHowever a bug could elude such detection by being for example remotely activated or timed. Then you would need to employ your detection tools when the bug is actually active.\nAll in all it is very hard for an \"ordinary Joe\" to be certain that a phone is not bugged.\nHowever, it is very unlikely that your phone is bugged if you really are an \"ordinary Joe\".\n", "Q: Suppress Time Machine Old Backups Dialogue Via Command Line Instead of letting Time Machine run automatically I use a shell script and the tmutil startbackup command to trigger backups, which gives me a much greater degree of flexibility. Specifically it lets me perform hourly backups to a local drive during my normal hours, with a separate network backup at night (since it tends to be a lot slower).\nUnfortunately, I've discovered today that if the network drive is filling up enough that old backups need to be deleted, then the dialogue informing me of this will prevent the backup from proceeding until I hit okay, but since it occurs after I normally leave my computer my machine just ends up staying awake all night waiting for me to do something about it.\nWhat I'd like to do is suppress this dialogue for my overnight backup, but leave it them enabled/re-enable it for my hourly backups. Is there a way I could do this? There doesn't appear to be any capability in tmutil itself. Is there a defaults option I could change perhaps?\n\nA: I don’t know whether you can suppress the dialog through tmutil directly.\nThe alternative, as you suggested, is to temporarily turn off the “Notify after old backups are deleted” option of the Time Machine options preferences through defaults:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist AlwaysShowDeletedBackupsWarning 0\n\nUse “1” instead of “0” to turn the option back on.\n(I should perhaps specify that this answer applies to El Capitan, I don’t know about Sierra, though I assume this hasn’t changed.)\n\nA: Try read this article Control Time Machine command line`and this for  delete Old Backups\n\nA: The defaults command to adjust the Time Machine backup interval is as follows, it belongs on a single line:\nsudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-auto StartInterval -int 14400\n\nThe last number is the time interval in seconds, making hours grouped by 3600 second segments. If you wanted to wait 4 hours between backups, the number would be 14400, and so on. The default setting is one hour, or 3600 seconds, which can be restored with:\nsudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-auto StartInterval -int 3600\n\nHit return and the default backup schedule will be restored again.\n\nThere is also a free program you can use to schedule times outside or terminal.\nhttp://www.klieme.com/TimeMachineScheduler.html\n", "Q: iOS/Restore issue I wanted to run something by an expert before I tried this. So if I was to update an iPhone from iOS 9 to iOS 10, would I be able to restore the now-updated iPhone to iOS 9 using an iCloud backup? Or would I need to revert it to iOS 9 via .jpsw before being able to restore the phone's data?\n\nA: No, you cannot restore to a prior version of the OS. The backup only contains your data, it does not contain the OS itself.\n", "Q: Apple Watch contact names missing after watchOS 3 update After updating my Apple Watch to watchOS 3 some of my contact names are missing in Messages and Phone etc. Some are showing name, others just show the phone number. The iPhone does show the contact names where the watch doesn't.\n\nA: This answer's a bit late, but I finally figured out the issue.\nYour Apple Watch's contact list is most likely out of sync with your iPhone.\n\nTry checking your Apple Watch's contact list though the phone app. If it looks like some contacts are missing, it's likely that the contact list isn't synced properly.\nThe easiest way to manually re-sync your contact list is to create a dummy contact \"AAAAA\" on your iPhone. Once it's been resynced, all your contacts should start displaying properly again.\n\nA: Just found an answer!\nMust have been a glitch or something. Just unpaired my watch and repaired it using the backup and everything is like normal.\n", "Q: Unable to SSH to OS X Server over alternate port Mac mini running OS X Server 10.11.6, CommuniGate Pro, and nearly no other stock OS X Server services. \nServer's owner recently found himself on a network that blocked ports for both VPN connections and SSH, so we're trying to set up the server to allow for an SSH tunnel via SOCKS proxy to port 443, which is nearly always left open. (We have no plans on running web services over that port on this box.)\nResearch indicates this should be a two-step process: 1) edit /Library/Server/Web/Config/Proxy/apache_serviceproxy.conf to remove web listeners on ports 80 and 443; 2) edit /etc/ssh/ssh_config to add an SSH listener on port 443; then reboot. \nUpon doing so, HTTP services indeed are turned off on 80 and 443, but I can't connect to SSH on port 443. Works fine over 22 still. Nmapping the server indicates that there's nothing open on port 443. Is there something else I need to do to open this up?\n\nA: Here are steps to get SSH listening on port 443. Note that if you have SIP disabled, you can directly edit (as root) /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist and therefore can skip steps 1 and 3, and use the above path in steps 2 and 5. Note in that case you will want to run the unload command before editing ssh.plist.\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the existing ssh.plist file into /Library:\nsudo cp /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh2.plist\n\n\n*Edit the file as root:\nsudo nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh2.plist\n\n\n*There are two things that need to be changed.

I have a late 2009 iMac. The specs are in pic below. This machine got a new hard drive last year and is running 12GB of memory, yet it often lags and is not as zippy as I would like.\nI am curious if there is anything that can be replaced or upgraded to make it perform like a newer machine or are the un-upgradable parts just too long in the tooth? Thanks for the advice.\n\n\nA: One the trade-offs to all-in-ones is not being able to upgrade most of the parts. You could try upgrading to an SSD but you're not going to see huge performance gains. The primary bottleneck at that point will continue to be the CPU (and possibly graphics).\n\nA: Although your question states it often lags and is not as zippy as I would like, you don't really provide examples of how it lags and in what sense it isn't zippy? Often these measures and improving them really get down to what you're using your machine for?\nIn any case, your particular model has four memory slots and can accept a total of 16GB of RAM, so you've almost maxed that out already. It's not clear from your post whether you're already using all 4 slots to achieve your 12GB, but if not you could opt to add the additional 4GB of RAM. To what extent this helps really depends on what you're using your iMac for?\nTubedogg is correct that you could upgrade your hard drive to an SSD. However, I disagree that you won't see huge performance gains from doing this. Not because Tubedogg is wrong about the CPU and graphics card potentially creating a bottleneck, but because we don't know what you mean by the computer lagging and not being zippy enough?\nAs an example, I have seen 2008 vintage MacBook Pros and iMacs upgraded with hybrid drives and SSDs that appear more zippy than current model MacBooks and iMacs still running hard drives. They just boot so quickly in comparison and can launch applications a lot faster, etc.\nHowever, if you're using your iMac to perform processor intensive tasks, then upgrading to an SSD will have little impact in terms of that.\nOne thing you don't mention is the speed of the hard drive you had installed last year? The stock standard hard drives installed on this model were either 500GB, 1TB or 2TB, but the good thing about this model is that they were 7200rpm hard drives. Unfortunately, many people end up replacing these at some point with 5400rpm hard drives, and the performance hit is noticeable. So, if this is what has happened in your case, then it'd be a factor in your iMac not feeling so zippy. And, if that was the case, replacing the hard drive would be worth considering.\nHowever, if it was me, I'd start thinking about buying a newer iMac (it doesn't have to be a new iMac, but you could opt for a well-equipped model only a couple of years old) and keeping this one as a second computer to be used for another purpose (kids computer, sharing your iTunes library, etc).\n", "Q: Sending All Traffic Over VPN Tunnel (IKEv2) in OS X 10.11.5 I recently setup VPN connections on my Macbook Pro running OS X 10.11.5 via the Apple Configurator.

You can change it to 1, 3, 6 months back, or All Events.\nThat restored my missing older events.\n", "Q: iOS 10 face recognition - how to reset the list of detected people? I found some errors in the list of detected people, wrong names attributed to photos.

The entry will disappear and the photos will go back in to the untagged pool.\nSource: How to unconfirm faces in iOS 10?\n", "Q: What is an iPhone app with good support for Twitter lists? I follow 1.1K people on Twitter so my newsfeed is unusable. I've found it useful to get mobile push notifications for 9 thought leaders but have problems viewing the notifications.\nSometimes when I view one Twitter mobile notification, it clears the rest from the iOS notification center so I have to open the app and go to that user's account and find the tweet. If I have more than 2 tweets disappear I basically have to give up.\nTwitter lists let me filter my newsfeed but take a few taps to get to. Is there an iPhone app that lets me get mobile notifications for activity on a Twitter list or lets me set my default view to a list?\n\nA: I found \"Tweetlist 4 for Twitter\" ($5) when searching the app store. Here are some potential work-arounds: \n\n\n*\n\n*Notifications seem to clear when I click \"Notifications\" at the bottom of the Twitter app for iOS 10. Try clicking on each notification in succession without clicking on anything in the the actual app. Works most of the time. \n\n*A foolproof solution is force touching the notification (if your phone supports it) so that you preview the tweet without even opening the app (only works for individual tweets - doesn't work for \"recommendations\" or \"highlights\").\n\n*TweetDeck can be used on the mobile web (as well as desktop web/app). You can add your lists as columns and collapse the sidebar so you can see better. You can also click the share button and press \"Add to Home Screen\" so the web page functions more like an app (edit: this doesn't work as you can't get past the login page but there is a paid app called \"DESKTOP LOGIN for TweetDeck\" for $3 but it has bad reviews because it isn't worth the money given that it's basically the same as using it in the browser).\n\n*Another idea is to set up SMS Notifications. Settings -> Mobile -> Text Notifications -> Check 1st Box: \"Tweets from people you've enabled for mobile notifications\". That way you'll have a running feed to make sure you didn't miss anything, I haven't tried this myself. SMS Notifications Twitter Help Page\nPS: Disappearing notifications are frustrating but I've always been optimistic that Twitter will fix it in the future! Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, has declared that they will make efforts to improve Twitter in 2017.

The 'Load Remote Content' is a great feature and I like to use it. Is there a way to make a whitelist of sender addresses for which remote content is loaded automatically, whilst remote content of addresses not on the whitelist are not automatically loaded?\nSuch whitelist will help me having the media content local and therefore the emails readable even after some time (media may have been deleted on server side by the sender after some time).\nIn addition such whitelist will be more productive, since I do not have to press for each email the button 'Load Remote Content'. Today many companies send their brand in an image, or add images to direct the reader to their Facebook/Twitter or whatever social media page. For these message I always have to press the button 'load remote content' since I do not know if other media content may have been added to the body of the email which the sender wants to share with me (eg photo).\nThe reason why I do not want to automatically load remote content is to not give feedback to spammers that my email addresses are active. Spammers usually work with a small media added to the email (usually 1 pixel image). When spammers see your email address active, they 1) continue spamming you 2) selling/giving your email addresses to other spammers.\n\nA: You can try using Mail's built-in Rules.\nIt is located here:\nMail -> Preferences... -> Rules -> Add Rule\n\nThen you can fill up the info.\nLike for example, let's say there is Facebook sending you an email every day. You can add a rule to maybe send it to the inbox or you can archive it etc.\n", "Q: How can I fix the tiny type in iOS 10 Mail? The update to iOS 10 has made type in Mail messages often appear too tiny to read. How do I restore readable type in iOS 10 Mail?\n\nThis is not a question about how to globally adjust text size (the text is fine elsewhere) or about how to zoom (that really doesn't fix the problem), but about how to make text that appears unreadably small some mail messages appear as it did in iOS 9.\n\nA: Try force quitting mail (double click the home button on your device to enter the task switcher and swipe the card for mail upwards). Then re-launch mail to see if the text is appropriately sized.\n\nA: Here is the process I just used that I read on Apple Support Communities:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Mail settings, turn off \"Complete Threads\"\n\n*Close the Mail app (double click home button, swipe Mail app up)\n\n*Open the Mail app from home screen\n\n*In Mail settings, re-enable \"Complete Threads\"\n\n\n\n(So far this solution is working, but even just closing and re-opening the app works for a time. I will update this answer with information on if this was a permanent fix or not.)\n\nA: This has been a persistent and annoying problem for me. But I just discovered that enabling all of the threading options in Mail version 11.2.2 seems to fix the problem, and turning the options off seems to bring it back.\nI wish Apple would fix this right.\n\n", "Q: proxychains suddenly stopped working When I run some program with proxychains, it shows an error like below:\n%> proxychains brew update\n[proxychains] DLL init: proxychains-ng 4.11\n[proxychains] DLL init: proxychains-ng 4.11\ndyld: warning: could not load inserted library '/usr/local/homebrew/Cellar/proxychains-ng/4.11/lib/libproxychains4.dylib' into library validated process because no suitable image found.

Other times, it will do a complete restarting and I will loose all my unsaved data.\nWhat causes one vs the other? Preferably, I would like it to always resume instead of restart.\n\nA: This is likely the cause of your system going down while in the process of performing a reboot. The most common cause of this is system updates loading in the background. Lots of times these updates will require a restart after installing. In addition, do you happen to have the computer scheduled for reboot?\nThis can be confirmed in System Preferences > Energy Saver > Schedule.

Set the Option to 'This Desktop'.\n\nThis method, of course, is not an automatic process & requires setting up by hand. One advantage is that you quickly learn which Space belongs to which app & can then use shortcut keys -  Ctrl ⌃   [number]  by default.\nSetting System Prefs > Mission Control to disable 'Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use' will make the assigned Space numbers stick.\n\nThis method will only work correctly if you don't manually move any app window to a different Space. Spaces cannot correctly handle apps split over more than one Space.\n\nA: It should remember your choice if you change it to fullscreen before quitting. Another option is to use the Single Application Mode:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock single-app -bool true\nkillall Dock\n\nWhich may not be exactly what you want.

I'm wondering if you can save a Digital Touch drawing made in iMessage on iOS10.\nFor example I made this drawing:\n\nPlease do not reuse without permission\nI took a screenshot of it but it's not the best option.\nOnce in the messages, if I press and hold the drawing I can \"Copy\" it, then  paste somewhere else (for example in a Note). But the resolution seems lower.\nIs there a way to keep it as an image in the best possible resolution?\n\nA: You can save it. After you send the drawing, underneath the word \"keep\" should appear. Click on it to save the drawing.\n\nA: I learned that once you send the digital touch message you can save them.\nGo to the recipients name at top of chat and select info (the “I” icon). From there all the photographs, movies, and attachments you have sent can be selected to your phones. Hold a photo or attachment until the options \"copy, delete or more\" pop up.

The error was: \"Not allowed to use restricted network port\" I'm having an issue with iOS 10.0.1 and Safari 10. In iOS 9 and Safari 9, I am able to go a web site on port 4190. As soon as I use an iOS 10 device, I get this error message using Safari 10:\nSafari cannot open the page.\nThe error was: \"Not allowed to use restricted network port\".\nI read online that some ports are blacklisted. Best I could find is a KURL.cpp blockedPortList, but I don't see port 4190 blocked. \nI see the error message is in this piece of code:\n#define WebKitErrorDescriptionCannotUseRestrictedPort UI_STRING_INTERNAL(\"Not allowed to use restricted network port\", \"WebKitErrorCannotUseRestrictedPort description\")\nAny ideas?\n\n\nA: The reason the port is blocked is because Apple considers it is a port that is open to trojans and viruses, so it automatically blocks those ports. it has to do with the release of Xcode(how mac programs are designed and written)\nApp Transport Security\niOS 9 introduces a new security feature that blocks non-HTTPS traffic in your app. However, this is a new feature that is only enabled for apps building with XCode 7 and iOS 9 SDK today. It will not break existing apps.\nSince the changes above require recompilation, this will impact your development process and manifest itself as a breaking change.\nTo fix, edit the MyApp-Info.plist file and add the contents of this patch.\nUPDATE: In short, the port was closed by Apple due to viruses. It worked on the older versions of Safari because the app was made on an older version of the program to used to create it (Xcode). So basically by updating, you installed a version of Safari that will not open those ports blocked by Apple.\n\nA: After looking at the latest source code for Safari (Safari Technology Preview 13), it seems the blockedPortList now includes port 4190. I realized it was in the browser code when connecting to port 4190 gave the error right away, but using Safari 9, there was would be long delay and an eventual timeout if you tried connecting to a resource on port 4190 that did not exist. \nhttps://trac.webkit.org/browser/releases/Apple/Safari%20Technology%20Preview%2013/WebCore/platform/URL.cpp\n3659, // apple-sasl / PasswordServer [Apple addition]\n4045, // lockd\n4190, // ManageSieve [Apple addition]\n6000, // X11\n6665, // Alternate IRC [Apple addition]\n6666, // Alternate IRC [Apple addition]\n6667, // Standard IRC [Apple addition]\n6668, // Alternate IRC [Apple addition]\n6669, // Alternate IRC [Apple addition]\n\n", "Q: Should we use smb or cifs to connect to a Linux NAS? If it is a Linux NAS (WD EX2100 or EX4100), should we use\nsmb://MyCloud\n\nor\ncifs://MyCloud\n\nto connect to it if for some reason, it doesn't show up at the side panel of Finder?\nThe above line is to be typed into \nFinder -> Go -> Connect to Server\n\nand for a Windows PC, I think it is to use smb. For an NAS, we can use either smb or cifs but which one should be used?\n\nA: CIFS is roughly the same as SMB version 1 (it's more complicated than that, but they're close enough for our purposes). Apple's implementations of SMB version 2 (introduced in OS X v10.9) and version 3 (OS X v10.10) were a bit buggy, at least at first. If you use an \"smb://\" URL in the connect dialog, it'll use the newest version that both the server and client support, and if you're still seeing weird behavior from that... then you can use \"cifs://\" to force it back to the old version 1 protocol, which might fix it (see e.g. this ZDNet article, which also gives a way to force version 1 via the nsmb.conf file).\nIf you aren't having trouble with the newer version of the protocol, or you are but switching back to the old version doesn't help, then use \"smb://\" -- the newer versions of the protocol are significantly faster and generally better.\n", "Q: Turning on iCloud Photo Stream If you turn on iCloud Photo Stream, does it automatically share all your old photos with everyone? Or just the recent ones?\n\nA: Photo Stream doesn't share photos with anyone. It simply makes your photos available on multiple devices of yours (signed in with your Apple ID) for up to 30 days or 1000 photos, whichever comes first.\nIt does not work retroactively. Only photos taken after it's turned on will be uploaded.\n", "Q: How do I change the position of the Dock? I want to keep the Dock on the left/right/top side instead of the bottom side of my screen.\nIs there a setting in System Preferences or a Terminal command that allows me to change this?\n\nA: You can change the position of the Dock by following these steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate your Dock. It is usually on the bottom prior to changing the position. You might have to hold it there for a second so it unhides. \n\n*Locate the separator between your apps and the trash can and other folders. In older versions of macOS, this is a dotted line. In the example screenshot, this is between Google Chrome and the Downloads folder. \n\n*Right-click that seperator to open a context menu. \n\n*Open the submenu named Position on Screen. \n\n*Pick your new Dock position. The default is Bottom, but you can change it to Left or Right. \n\n*The Dock will now appear on that side of the screen. \n\nA: System Preferences > Dock > Position on Screen\n\nIt allows left / right / bottom.

The apps without registration facilities already in the store (such as Amazon's Kindle app, for example) are of wide appeal and people are able to register themselves outside of the app to use it.\nI know there some companies who distribute apps via ED to \"selected\" users (i.e. those on their panels), such as UserTesting.com. They don't have apps in the Store.\nThat said, this is my opinion and who knows what Apple will ultimately do.\n\nA: An app I made for my company also uses an external program to register users.\nTo avoid possible problems with apple I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Created a demo database that apple can use\n\n*In the \"notes for reviewing\" I explained the authorisation process\nI said that if they want full access they should email us the authorisation code generated by the app and we will grant them access.\nIn the end the app was approved and I never got a request from apple for db access.\nAs long as you explain in detail how the app works, apple won't give you any trouble I expect\n\nA: That will not be a problem. \nBusinesses use same practices for employees that connect to work databases. You do not have to give access to everyone just to have your app approved. You just need to meet certain design and security requirements in general.

I get notifications from apps like Snapchat or Facebook Messenger.

Apps that are in a suspended state aren’t actively in use, open, or taking up system resources. With Background App Refresh, suspended apps can check for updates and new content.\n\nNotifications are pushed from the server to your device at the time of an event (new email, message, whatever) and are unrelated to Background App Refresh.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra, Security, and Tex Live Utility After a fresh install of macOS Sierra, I installed the macTex distribution without any GUI programs. After that, I installed the latest release of the Tex Live Utility to update my tex distribution via a nice GUI.

I have an Early 2013 MacBook Pro and an Apple Watch, both of which have the most updated version of the OS installed. I followed these instructions to get it to work (checked 2 factor authentication is on, I have a password on my Watch), but I do not see the option to use my Watch to unlock under System Preferences. Any ides on why it does not work? Could it have something to do with me having 2 Apple IDs, one for iTunes and one for iCloud?

It should work. \n\nA: I tried gnzlbg's solution and it didn't work for me. So I powered off the iPhone and restarted. It still didn't work, perhaps because I still had the phone connected to my computer. I disconnected, power cycled again, and now it works. \n\nA: I disabled iCloud Music, Music Match, and all that stuff from the iphone, turned it off, turned it back on again, and now everything syncs fine...\n\nA: Just in case everything fails, go clear the iTunes or Music cache, then restart iTunes or Music.\nThat should fix it. :D\n", "Q: Apple network share - how do I restrict access for user or staff group? I have a Mac mini acting as a file share server with external hard drive as a 'shared drive'.\nI have separate accounts for each user. Previously they were all in the same 'Team' group and could read and write every subfolder in the 'shared drive'.\nHowever I have a new user that should only be able to access one subfolder, so I'd like to restrict permission for that user. However when I look at the info of the folder on the shared drive, there is no option to remove 'staff' group from permissions list.\nIf I create a folder on the system hard drive I can see the 'staff' group permission and can remove it. However on the external drive there is no option.\n\nEdit: I figured out that I had 'Ignore ownership' enabled on the external drive which allowed any registered user to connect. I disabled this and re-enabled permissions on each subfolder which allowed me to finely control access.\n\nA: I'd probably change the group from staff to something else. Or remove the group access using:\nchmod g-rwx /path/to/folder\n\n", "Q: Download icloud photo library without paying? I wanted to disable the iCloud photo library and the information said that I could still download my photos for 30 days, so I did. After disabling the library I got an email with the instructions to download the photos to the Photos app on my Mac. \nHowever, it seems that the only way to download the backup of my photos is to reactivate the iCloud photo library for which now I have to upgrade my iCloud plan and pay. I just want to download a backup of my photos and be done with iCloud. \nI wasn't told upfront that if I wanted to download a backup of the photos during those 30 days I would have to pay for an upgrade plan I don't want. \nHow do I do this without having to pay/upgrade to a plan that I don't want?\n\nA: Go to www.icloud.com, select the iPhoto library, and on the top right corner there is an option to mark photos you want to download and download them through the browser. Then you can read them to your photo library on your mac. \nI could not find an option to download all the photos as a \"Photos library file\" so that one can switch the Photos library directly to it on the mac.

I wanted to make a mixed video of all the people in my pictures but accidentally merged them all as one.\nWhat can I do to un-merge them as seperate people again?\n\nA: Tap on the existing (mixed) person. Tap Select at the upper-right, then tap on each photo that is not the person whose name is at the top of the screen. Tap on the Share icon at the lower-left, then tap \"Not this person\" on the bottom row of options. You may need to scroll to see it.\nThis will remove them from the current person. Where they go from there is a separate issue. I haven't found a way to manually tag a photo as being a particular person, but it's likely they should reappear in the Add People section. You may need to do further work to get all photos of a particular person back together at that point (i.e. merging and using \"not this person\" as needed).\n\nA: After following the other answer, the problem that I had was the person I removed from the mistakenly merged profile could no longer be found under the people profile section so I was unable to create a new profile for him.\nI called Apple help desk and they asked me to simply take another photo of the person with my phone or add another image of the person to the phone. The facial recognition software then detected the new photo and created a new people profile for this person again. Worked like a charm! \n", "Q: Cloned disk from older MacBook not booting on new MacBook Pro I have an old MacBook (2-3 years old), it is running 10.9.\nLast night I cloned the hard drive and tried to use it as a startup disk on my new MacBook Pro (June 2016, with 10.11 installed).\nAll I got was a no entry sign on startup.

This wasn't a problem in iOS 9 or earlier. However, now iOS 10 has added a new feature such that one doesn't have to switch keyboards to type in another language, which causes trouble: now I have both English and French dictionaries and both keyboards, and for example, when I type \"critique\" in the English keyboard, a word existing in both dictionaries, iOS will then prompt the French suggestions (de, le, la etc.), even though I never mean to switch to French -- I just want to normally type \"critique\" as an English word, but of course iOS can't detect my intention.\nAnyway, now I want things to go back to what they were in iOS 9 or earlier. And I have to keep both the dictionaries and the keyboards. Is it possible?\n\nA: Leave feedback with Apple or they will never fix this. All they need is a way to turn it on and off. \nOne good way is to use the Apple Support iOS app and check if you’ve missed an easy step. If not and this is truly by design, they should get you a feedback link where you can request this change in functionality. \n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Support by Apple\n\nA: So far the only workaround seems to be using another keyboard, for example, google's gboard or microsoft's swiftkey — both are heavy on data-collection but if you do not enable Allow full access in settings they are still fairly usable.\nFor gboard make sure you disable Multilingual typing in settings. To quickly access gboard settings long-tap the cogwheel ⚙️ icon. Normal single tap on ⚙️ can be used to switch between installed languages.\n", "Q: Is there a way to Reindex/\"Reinstall\" AirPlay Devices in OS X? I'm using Airfoil as a way to broadcast my iMac as an AirPlay device on my home network. This utility does, besides creating an \"Airfoil\" server, also create an actual AirPlay device that can be seen under System Settings > Sound and by Opt–clicking the Sound/Volume icon in the OS X menu bar.\nFor some reason, the Airfoil AirPlay device (reachable in the below menu) has suddenly stopped working. When trying to send audio to it from my other Mac, I get the system pop-up \"Could not connect to xxx-Airfoil\".\n\n\n(Ignore the current checkmarks in this image. It's the \"Airfoil\" AirPlay device I'm trying to access)\n\n\nHowever, when using the Airfoil application menu directly to access the computer via the Airfoil service (not AirPlay in the audio output tab), audio transmission works as intended. So my conclusion is that there is something wrong with what/how OS X \"knows\" about the AirPlay device.\nQuestion: Is there a way to get OS X to \"reindex\"/reinstall the available Airplay Devices?\nSomething like (in pseudo-terminal command):\nairplayutil --reindex devices\n\nI've tried reinstalling Airfoil and its sister-application Airfoil Satellite, and also tried rebooting the computers. Not sure why it suddently has stopped working – I'm still on El Capitan.\n\nA: Typically when I see issues with AirPlay, particularly when you've taken the troubleshooting steps that you have already, it is a network issue and not a software issue.\nSo here are a few things to try/verify:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can you AirPlay from this Mac to other AirPlay receivers?\n\n*Are you on the same physical network as the AirFoil receiver (including same Wi-Fi network—and the same frequency band (2.4 GHz vs. 5 GHz)?\n\n*Is Bonjour working? \n\n*Are all multicast filtering options disabled on your switch/router (or conversely, is multicast traffic permitted)? Note that if your router autoupdates, a setting or default may have changed.\n\n*Have you tried temporarily disabling all firewalls on both machines?\n\n", "Q: how will users be informed if an app is not running on their current iOS version?

(iTunes 12/macOS Sierra) I have many music tracks on my computers which are free downloads from SoundCloud. They usually don't have all the proper ID3 meta-data.\nIn iTunes 12 (released with macOS Sierra), is there a way to sort the \"Artist\" view, not by Album?\nAlmost every single Web DL track will have the header \"Unknown Album\" which feels a tad bit ugly and useless.\n\nOn the image below, I'm in the \"Artists\" view of an iTunes Remote Library. I've looked around at View Options and some other obscure buttons sprinkled here in there in the iTunes UI, but can't find a way to disable these headers and just display the tracks themselves.\n\nA: To add the proper ID3 meta-data, you can simply select the tracks you want to put in same album, then cmd+i and change the artist or album artist to make them fall into the same album. Example: name both the artist and album artist of all the selected tracks, \"Soundcloud\".\nOr you can select Songs on the left pane, then click on Name, Artist, Album, etc. column headers to sort them according to your choice. :)\n\n", "Q: Upgrading to 10.10 ether via USB drive or app store, in September 2016 I've got a mac mini running 10.8.5 that I want to upgrade to a newer OS. The most recent OS I can upgrade to is Yosemite 10.10.5 (due to the fact some software we need to run doesn't work on 10.11 or the upcoming 10.12).\nI've got the installer for Yosemite 10.10 saved to a USB flash drive from when I did a previous clean install. Am I able to use this on my 10.8.5 machine if I want to do a standard upgrade not a clean install? \nIf not am I still able to upgrade to 10.10 via the App Store? \n\nA: App Store \nYou can easily check whether upgrading via the Mac App Store is an option by going into the App Store app and seeing if it's available for you. \nGenerally, what should happen is the App Store will give you the option of upgrading to the most recent OS that'll run on your Mac Mini. Your question doesn't specify which model of Mac Mini you're running, but any Mac Mini from early 2009 onwards can run macOS Sierra, so you're likely to get the option of upgrading to that, which you don't want. \nYou may be able to still use the App Store by going to the Purchased tab and seeing if Yosemite is listed (it will be if you've previously downloaded it using the same Apple ID).\nUSB Drive \nRegarding your USB option, this may work depending on what version of the installer you have or how you put the installer onto the USB drive (e.g. Is it bootable from the USB)?\nAssuming everything has been done right, then Yosemite supports the usual installation options, including \"upgrade install\".\nRemember: \nThe best approach (as always) is to do a full backup prior to attempting the upgrade, regardless of how you plan to do it.\n", "Q: How to install or port data to a Fusion / Hybrid / SSHD drive I have a late 2012 Mac mini that came with a 500 GB HDD installed from the factory. It's almost full so I want to upgrade it to a 1 TB Fusion Drive, as the cost for a 1 TB SSD is still steep. The Mac mini is currently running 10.8.5 (I'm not sure if it's even compatible with Fusion Drives) and I'm going to upgrade the machine to 10.10.\nDo I need to do anything in particular to use a 3rd party Fusion / Hybrid Drive? \nIn the past when I've moved to a new drive, I just put the new drive in an enclosure and then backup the old drive (whilst still inside the machine) using Carbon Copy Cloner. Will this work with a Fusion / Hybrid Drive? As I guess the OS files need to be saved to the SSD part of the drive. \nFor reference I was thinking of using a Seagate SSHD drive like this Seagate SSHD Laptop. \n\nA: No, there is nothing special you need to do.\nAt the risk of oversimplifying things, the way that hybrid drives work is that they monitor the data being read from the drive and, over time, they identify what files are regularly read from the drive. The drive then caches the most frequently accessed files to the high speed NAND flash memory.\nThe net result is that hybrid hard drives blend HDD capacity with SSD speeds.\nA couple of years ago I actually installed a 1TB Seagate hybrid drive into a 15\" MacBook Pro (late 2008) model and the improvement was amazing. Well worth it in my situation!\nIn terms of how you go about doing this, it's really a matter of personal choice. I've used Carbon Copy Cloner, Time Machine and others. In recent years I've just used Time Machine to manage all my backups and then restore data that way. I also use two Time Machine backup drives for each computer.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Strictly speaking, this won't be a Fusion drive as far as OS X 10.8 or 10.10 are concerned. The operating system will see the new part as a single drive, and Seagate's firmware will do all the \"Fusion\" parts on its own. This should be as simple as your previous storage upgrades.\n\nA: There is one very important thing to do and that is to enable TRIM support\nsudo trimforce enable\n\nIn OS X prior to Yosemite, you had no way to enable TRIM on 3rd party drives.  But in Yosemite and later (10.10 and on) Apple included the ability to enable TRIM on non 1st Party (OEM) drives.\nWhy TRIM?\nFrom Apple Insider:\n\nPart of the ATA standard, TRIM helps optimize garbage data handling in SSDs by earmarking files no longer in use for permanent deletion. Unlike conventional spinning hard drives, SSDs perform erase operations before writing new files, meaning multiple erase/write operations could create a backlog of garbage bits that gradually slow the system down. \n\nAs for cloning my drive, I am not a fan of simply copying the image of a drive from one to the next unless I am doing disaster recovery.  What I would do is a Time Machine back up, do a fresh install of the OS of my choice, then migrate the data from Time Machine.\nIs this more time consuming?  Yes.  But I have found it much more reliable.\nThat said...\nAs for your setup, I would probably create my own Fusion Drive.  Instead of buying a single HDD, there are 2nd hard drive kits you can get that allow you to install two drives in the Mac mini.   The instructions on how to install are on iFixit.com\nThis (IMO) gives you more flexibility.  You can use them as two separate drives or create your own hybrid/fusion drive using CoreStorage\nAs for your drive choice, (also IMO) I would say away from anything Seagate.  I prefer Western Digital just based on the number of failures I have with Seagate drives.  I have found WD to be much more reliable.  It also seems I am not the only one according to USA Today\n", "Q: Podcasts Playing Too Fast My Podcasts are playing too fast. I have searched the web and there should be a 1x button close to the rewind button, but I do not see it. (See Attached Screenshot). I have a Iphone 5s running IOS 10.

After several unsuccessfull attempts to enter the passcode, it become locked permanently and asked me to connect it to iTunes. When I connect it to computer, iTunes says \"iTunes could not connect to the iPad “Ilya V. Schurov’s iPad” because it is locked with a passcode. You must enter your passcode on the iPad before it can be used with iTunes.\" And iPad still doesn't allow me to enter passcode. I also turned off \"find my ipad\" feature and cannot erase iPad with iCloud.\nSo I finally decided to use Recovery mode. I followed the official instructions, entered the recovery mode and began the restore/update process. Unfortunately, to proceed, iTunes have to download iOS 10 which is about 2GB. It seems that Apple's servers are overloaded and iTunes says it will take about 24 hours to complete the download (or even more). However, as the documentation says,\n\nIf the download takes more than 15 minutes and your device exits recovery mode, let the download finish, then repeat these steps.\n\nIndeed, after 15 minutes iPad exits recovery mode and restarts. The download is then stopped.\nIt is obvious that the repeating of these step will not help. Any other ideas how to restore iPad in this case?\n\nA: This constantly happens to me and people I know.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the .ipsw file - links to true Apple Software are listed at https://ipsw.me\n[files hosted by Apple, the site simply makes the files findable, as Apple doesn't publish the locations]\n\n*Place the file in ~/Library/iTunes/iPad Software Updates or ~/Library/iTunes/iPhone Software Updates depending on device.\n\n*Launch iTunes & connect your device\nThe ipsw ought to be discovered automatically.\n\n*Follow the on-screen instructions\n\n\nipsw.me has links to all iOS versions, however generally only the latest is still being signed by Apple & will therefore be the only one that works for a restore.\n\nA: Same thing happened to me, it gives an option to update and restore but not just restore. 15 minutes isn't enough time for two updates. Press the \"x\" and it should come up an option to update and an option to restore, update first then do a separate restore!\n", "Q: Saving Voicemails from my iPhone 6s I have Voicemails on my iPhone 6s from my mother who recently passed.  Please advise the best way for me to save these. \n\nA: One fairly straight forward way of doing this is to grab another iPhone / iPod Touch / iPad and use the Voice Memos app to record them while they're playing on your iPhone on speaker.\nOnce you've recorded them you can Share them from the Voice Memos app by sending them via email to yourself or using one of the  other options.\n\nA: I've used iExplorer to get the Voicemail from both my iPhone and backups made in iTunes of my iPhone, to have separate copies of all the Voicemails. They can then be played right in Finder in Icon view, just click the file, or played in QuickTime Player, which is the default for files with the .arm extension which the Voicemails have.\n\n", "Q: In Pages, trying to bold everything that is inside {curly brackets} I have a source document that I'm trying to clean up, it's essentially plain text. But the author has bold text indicated with { } brackets, and italics indicated with < > brackets.\nI would like to be able to automatically convert these to the proper style. Is there a way to accomplish this? It's nearly 200 pages, and on some there are 30+ instances on a single page. This will be weeks of work at the rate I'm going.\nI've got the latest Pages (and no older version to fall back on). Is there a way to do this? \n\nA: I would recommend simply editing the file in .rtf, as it contains support for bold and italic but isn't anywhere near as complex as Pages files.\nRTF uses a tag based system denotes certain properties with the backslash \"\\\" as the control word, which is somewhat human readable.. Take a look at these two pieces: one the formatted .rtf and the other the plaintext (or code.)\n\nThis is a test.\n\n{\\rtf1\\ansi\\ansicpg1252\\cocoartf1404\\cocoasubrtf470\n{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fswiss\\fcharset0 Helvetica;}\n{\\colortbl;\\red255\\green255\\blue255;}\n\\margl1440\\margr1440\\vieww10600\\viewh10400\\viewkind0\n\\pard\\tx720\\tx1440\\tx2160\\tx2880\\tx3600\\tx4320\\tx5040\\tx5760\\tx6480\\tx7200\\tx7920\\tx8640\\pardirnatural\\partightenfactor0\n\n\\f0\\fs24 \\cf0 This \n\\b is\n\\b0  \n\\i a\n\\i0  test.}\n\nStripping out the metadata, we still have a valid .rtf file, just with less formatting (which we don't need anyways.)\n{This \n\\b is\n\\b0\n\\i a\n\\i0  test.}\n\nWe don't even need those newlines.\n{This \\b is \\b0 \\i a \\i0 test.}\n\nWith this, it becomes pretty trivial to convert your text: all we need is find and replace. First, create a .txt with all the data and open it in your favorite text editor–even TextEdit will do.

I have several folders and files that I would like to link to a local folder that happens to be a Dropbox folder. Specifically I'd like to put Finder aliases to some files and some folders into a folder that is on Dropbox. What happens when I do this? What is synced to Dropbox? Is it just the Finder alias itself (a special kind of file only meaningful on macOS) or are the linked-to files or folders copied to Dropbox?\n\nA: The Finder alias will appear as a zero-byte file in Dropbox. Any files linked to it will not be uploaded.\nIf you would like to have Dropbox sync the contents of the alias, you can instead use what's called a symbolic link. Basically, it's an alias that the operating system (and Dropbox) treat as indistinguishable from the actual folder. This question on SuperUser answers how to create a symbolic link.\n\nA: I tried putting an alias for my Documents folder in Dropbox (before macOS Sierra put the Documents folder in iCloud), and it didn't work. If I went to my Dropbox account online, there was a folder called \"Documents,\" but it never synced any of the content. \nI now use Cloud Storage Helper, which I believe uses symbolic links.\nBe super careful about using that app, though. Without thinking, I put my Pictures folder in Dropbox - the Pictures folder contains Photos.app data. Every time I added a photo to Photos.app, it had to update Dropbox. And with thousands of photos, that file was at least 12Gbs. It took forever and caused horrible lag.\nJust in case anyone finds themselves in a similar situation, to fix this, I disabled Dropbox syncing then deleted the Pictures folder from Dropbox.com.

Even they have different time lengths and belong to different discs.\nFor example, in the above screenshot, SHOW (3:32), the first track of the second disc has an iCloud status icon Duplicate, whereas SHOW  (3:30), the first track of the first disc is successfully uploaded to iCloud/iTunes Match.\nWhy does this situation happen, and how can I successfully upload these tracks to iCloud/iTunes Match?\n\nA: iTunes match analyzes every song before uploading or matching it.\nEven if a song appears to be different (different length, different title) it may in fact be the same song with a bit more silence at the end.\nYou can only upload songs that are different from the songs that you have uploaded before.\nIs this second disc some kind of special edition of the first one?\n\nA: I've found a workaround for it.  iTunes seems to recognize tracks as different ones when they belong to different albums, even if these are the same audio.\nSo here's a way to fix it: make these tracks to temporarily belong to different albums, and when these tracks get successfully uploaded to iTunes Match/iCloud, merge these two albums into one album.  Here's a screenshot:\n\nThese tracks are well uploaded to iTunes Match/iCloud so that they become visible to Apple Music for Android.\n", "Q: iOS 10 people album: How to change the name of a person I added a name for a person in the people album, but  there was a typo.

The screen is black when I turn on the laptop.\n\nA: Unfortunately your question provides no details in terms of the model of MacBook Pro you have or what type of other Mac you may have access to. This is important because the easiest ways to transfer data involves hardware - eg. the ports available, whether the hard drive is easily removable, etc.\nBelow are some options for you. Which ones are valid will depend on your hardware.\nExternal monitor\nPlug your MacBook Pro into an external monitor so you can access/use it. This will give you a whole heap of options, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connecting an external hard drive to transfer data across\n\n*Use file sharing to make the MacBook Pro accessible to other computers\n\n*Set up your computer to use iCloud to sync your data to another Mac\n\n*Making a Time Machine backup and using this to transfer data\n\n*Use a USB flash drive to transfer data\n\n\nAnother point to consider with this approach is that you could still keep using the MacBook Pro by connecting it to a monitor.\nUse Target Disk Mode\nStart up your MacBook Pro in target disk mode using these steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure the MacBook Pro is off.\n\n*Connect the MacBook Pro to the other Mac using a FireWire or Thunderbolt cable. \n\n*Power up the MacBook Pro while holding down the T key. \n\n*Since your MacBook's screen isn't working, you won't see when it's ready - so just wait until you see the MacBook Pro's hard drive appear on the desktop of the other Mac.\n\n\nNow you can access the MacBook Pro's data just like it was on any external hard drive.\nRemove the hard drive\nDepending on your MacBook Pro model, removing the hard drive may be a fairly easy process. If this is the case for you, then remove the hard drive and place it inside a hard drive enclosure (they're not expensive). This allows you to connect it to another Mac as an external drive. Not only can you transfer your data, but you can keep using the drive as an external drive for more data storage or backup purposes.\n", "Q: Font Installs, But Not in FontBook I've tried to install two TTF fonts, but they don't show up in FontBook.\nMessage in Console is:\nSandbox: FontValidator(897) deny(1) file-read-metadata /\n\nA: The files were already present in ~/Library/Fonts but they had different permissions than the other files.

(iCloud Drive) The Store in iCloud function that was introduced with macOS Sierra looks interesting to try out. It will store both the Desktop and the Documents folders in iCloud Drive instead of on the local drive.\nI want it to store only the Desktop folder in iCloud, and not the Documents folder. Is this possible? \nI noticed that by turning On and Off the Store in iCloud function, the files that had already been transfered to iCloud Drive (when the function was originally turned On) stayed there – and empty folders called Desktop — Local and Documents — Local were created in the user home directory.\nSo is it possible to make use of this circumstance, to keep only Desktop files in the iCloud? Will applications that make use of the Documents folder decide to use the iCloud folder or the local folder?\n\nUpdate MacOS Catalina:\nI don't think toxefa's answer below is working anymore with macOS Catalina. Upgrading the OS created a new empty Desktop folder in the user home directory. I tried deleting that Desktop folder via Terminal (rm -rf /Users/<yourusername>/Desktop) and then created a symlink per the answer ln -s /Users/<yourusername>/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Desktop /Users/<yourusername>/Desktop, but after reboot the symlink is gone and a new empty Desktop folder is always created in the home directory.\n\nA: Doesn't look like there's a way to single out the Desktop via the 'Manage Storage' GUI. \nHowever, you can always just symlink any directory from your iCloud drive; that way you can ensure that only the Desktop folder is being synced. This is with the caveat that while your Desktop files are being stored in iCloud, they're still taking up space on your HD before, during, and after sync. If you do it on every Mac then you'll keep your Desktop in sync between them all (files added, deleted, changed etc); this might not be what you're after though.\nIf symlinking isn't something you know how to do, instructions are below.\n\nBackup (via TimeMachine or whatever you use).\nThen fire up Terminal and run the following to move your Desktop folder into your iCloud Drive:\nmv ~/Desktop /Users/<yourusername>/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/\n\nThen just symlink it to the usual 'Desktop' location:\nln -s /Users/<yourusername>/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Desktop /Users/<yourusername>/Desktop\n\nNow anything that you add to ~/Desktop (by dropping things onto your desktop etc) will actually be dropped into your iCloud drive. They are of course still taking up local space on your machine. When you delete something from your desktop then it's gone from the 'Cloud' as well. The benefits of this are more for sync between machines (+ access via your iPhone of course).\n\nIf you've got another mac, move anything you value from it's desktop folder into your iCloud Drive 'Desktop' folder first, then delete ~/Desktop on that machine and symlink again as above.\n\nA: Move all (or some of) your documents to a newly created Local Documents folder in you home folder. Only an empty Documents folder will get synced.\nThis is suggested by Gary at Macmost.com.\nps. : This will not work for the reverse problem of syncing Documents but not Desktop at the Desktop folder is rather a special one.\n\nA: Why not just enable iCloud and empty out your Documents folder before you enable syncing? You can make a myDocuments folder that won’t sync or another name. Changing your system agains the clear design intent can and likely will yield instability or breakage when Apple ships updates. As you see, it's already broken once and I hope someone reverse engineers this for science (so we can all learn how this is implemented), but this seems quite contrived of an example if you are going to enable iCloud sync in the first place.\nI would just let the system have the empty folder it wants to sync on Catalina and be in awe that it worked in the past.\n", "Q: Basic questions about DMG and copying Mac OS Install CD as a backup I have a Mac OS X Install DVD (Leopard 10.5.6). \nHow do I store a copy of this Leopard Install DVD to my PC Laptop? \nI want to have it as a backup. My MacBook won't boot so I will need to reinstall the OS. But before I do that I want a backup of the OS Install DVD in case the DVD won't eject from the MacBook. \nThe info on Google is about making \"bootable USB sticks\", but I just want to store a copy of the Mac operating system on my PC laptop.\nHere are my questions.\n1) I cannot simply copy the files of the Install DVD and paste it onto my PC Laptop. Is this correct?\n2) I need to get a DMG image file of the Install DVD. Is this correct?\n3) Is the Install DVD already a DMG file? Or do I need to create a DMG file?\n4) On my Windows laptop, I put the Leopard Install DVD inside, but none of the folders contain a DMG or ISO file. Is it hidden? Is it because I am on a Windows laptop?\nScreenshots of the files inside of my 10.5.6 OS Install DVD being viewed on a Windows laptop:\n\n\n\n\nA: You can always get the CD out. If the drive works, hold the mouse or trackpad button and power on the Mac. If the drive doesn't work, it won't accept a disc as the arms gripping the disk won't unlock and retract. In case they already are retracted, the CD will go in but will not be gripped, so it will come out by holding the Mac on it's side and letting gravity do it's work.\nWith regards to the backup issue: it's a hybrid DVD, probably dual-layer. To read it, you need disk cloning software for optical media with raw read capability. You then can burn it back to a DVD whenever you like.  \n\nA: Have you seen this article? http://www.sysprobs.com/create-iso-mac-installation-dvd-rip-mac-dvd-windows\nHope this helps. \n", "Q: Where did the button to hang up the phone from the lock screen go on iOS 10 Since upgrading to iOS 10 I've noticed that often when I want to hang up a call, I now have to unlock the phone, navigate to the phone app to finally press the red \"hang up\" button.\nPreviously there would be some basic phone controls like \"Mute\" and \"Hang up\" even if the phone decided to lock while you were on the call.  Now all I see is the contact information and call duration where the clock would be and \"Press home to unlock\" on the bottom.  No phone controls.\nHow can I reenable the phone controls on the lock screen?\n\nA: As long as you are not on speakerphone, you can always end the call using the power button. Just press it once.\nBy the way, this feature exists since 2007 when Steve Jobs revealed the original iPhone.\n\nA: On the lock screen in iOS 10, a swipe right gets you to that new lock info screen (this used to get you call controls), a swipe left gets you the camera.  I had the same reaction, how do I get to call controls?!?\nIt turns out, you just need to tap the phone number or contact name displayed on the lock screen, and you will get the call controls.  This makes sense, in hindsight, as the swipe right now has a new behavior, but it wasn't obvious to me either.\nAlso, the sleep/wake physical button hands up the phone, so that's often easier than using the screen in many situations.\n\nA: This is definitely a bug. Tapping on home button does not work for me as it pulls up unlock code screen - I need this feature still so that family members can use my phone. My hands are too small to reach the top of the screen while operating the phone with one hand (i.e while driving). I have never been so frustrated with iOS, nor felt so unsafe while driving.\n", "Q: Changing display color profiles easily Is there a way to easily switch display color profiles, instead of going to System Preferences > Displays > Color > Display Profile?\nIt doesn't seem to be AppleScript-able. There used to be a menu-bar utility called ProfileMenu, but it no longer works in macOS Sierra, and is no longer supported.\nYou can get the selected profile using AppleScript, but it's read-only, so you can't set it:\ntell application \"Image Events\"\n  get display profile of display 1\nend tell\n\n\nA: I found a little tool called customdisplayprofiles, which lets you switch profiles by running a command like customdisplayprofiles set /path/to/profile.icc. I put that into a shell script in ~/Library/Scripts/, and now I can switch profiles from the menu bar again. You can find the .icc files in /Library/ColorSync/Profiles/ and ~/Library/ColorSync/Profiles/.\n", "Q: Specify Minimum Font Size in Safari 10.0, macOS Sierra The Minimum Font Size option seems to be missing in Safari 10.0 / macOS Sierra.  It's been replaced by Page Zoom (prefs > advanced).  I'm specifically asking how to prevent Safari in Sierra from ever using a font size below a certain value.  I don't want to have to fix this on a site by site basis.\nLet's say I want to set 11px as the minimum font size in Safari on macOS Sierra.

I've found that some recent iMessage messages that were sent to me showed up only on my iPad instead of both my iPad and my iPhone. There are other questions at Ask Different that address how this could happen, but my concern here is getting the message streams back in sync so that both devices show the same history of messages. In other words, I want to get the missing messages to appear in the message stream on my iPhone (with the correct timestamps). Is there some way to force the iPhone to sync with the iPad or with a master message database at Apple?\nBoth devices are running iOS 9.3.5.\n\nA: There is no master message database at Apple. If it's been less than 30 days, and if Apple's servers think your iPhone hasn't received the messages in question yet, they may yet show up, but it's unlikely.\nThere's no way to force the issue because messages are only saved for up to 30 days or until delivered, whichever comes first.

How people know what's possible to be changed via CLI in OSX / macOS if com.apple.finder.plist is a binary file and calling cat command for that file  shows only a binary gibberish output?\ncat ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\n\nI've found great option in macOS Sierra:\n\nKeep folders on top when sorting by name\n\nWhat's the name of it's defaults write so that I can add it into my settings script?\nBasically instead of guessing I would like to know where to find all possible options. Does Apple provide it somewhere? I know this site but it's not up to date...\n\n\nA: To read/write .plist files, use the defaults command.\nThe key that gets set when checking the [√] Keep folders on top when sorting by name check box under Advanced in Finder Preferences is named: _FXSortFoldersFirst \nTo set this in Terminal (or script) use the following command:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder _FXSortFoldersFirst -bool YES\n\nTo unset, use the following command:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder _FXSortFoldersFirst -bool NO\n\nNote that in previous OS versions, Finder needed to be restarted using killall Finder to have some settings, when changed by defaults, work properly. In macOS 10.12, this is not necessary for this particular setting, however the Finder window does need to be refreshed by some means, e.g. toggling from list view to icon view and back.\n\nIf you want to toggle between List view and Icon view in the bash script vs. using killall Finder after using defaults write ..., use the following code block:\nosascript <<END\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set theWindows to every Finder window\n    repeat with i from 1 to number of items in theWindows\n        set this_item to item i of theWindows\n        set theView to current view of this_item\n        if theView is list view then\n            set current view of this_item to icon view\n        else\n            set current view of this_item to list view\n        end if\n        set current view of this_item to theView\n    end repeat\nend tell\nEND\n\nNote: This method may not work with all setting changes made to Finder, although it works for _FXSortFoldersFirst, nonetheless killall Finder may be required for some settings. It's just to early to tell with macOS 10.12.\n\nA: The user .plist file does not contain every possible option by default: it only contains those values that the user has modified.

Apple AirPods are supposed to work for iOS devices, Apple Watches and Macs. Apple states that the OS requirements are:\n\nRequires iCloud account and macOS Sierra, iOS 10, or watchOS 3 (source).\n\nI am a prospective buyer of AirPods. My question is what the experience is like, when using the same pair of AirPods to switch between an iOS device and  a Mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*How is pairing/switching done?\n\n*Can the experience be called “seamless”?\n\n*Are there any caveats that should be known from a user-perspective?\n\n\n\nNote: This is not a buying recommendation question, the goal is to produce an objective description of the pairing/switching process between iOS/macOS devices.\n\nA: iOS 13 Update: Quickly connect to AirPods in control center by force touching Bluetooth and selecting AirPods.\n\n“Seamless” switching\nAirPods allow for \"Seamless switching\" because you can easily connect Device B without disconnecting the AirPods from Device A (unlike other Bluetooth headphones/speakers).\nHow to switch AirPods between devices signed into your Apple ID\n\n*\n\n*Airplay in apps that support it\n\n*iPhone Control Center: Swipe up (or down from top right), force touch on the now playing widget in the top right (or wait for the airplay icon and click that)\n\n*iPhone Bluetooth: Force Touch \"Settings\", select Bluetooth\n\n*Mac Bluetooth in Menu Bar: System Preferences → Bluetooth → \"Show Bluetooth in Menu Bar\"\n\n*Mac Sound in Menu Bar: System Preferences → Sound → \"Show Volume in Menu Bar\"\n\n*Apple TV (inside apps that support it): Swipe down from top and select “Audio”\n\n*Apple TV (alternative): Hold Play/Pause button (in “TV”/“menu” view)\n\n*Apple TV Settings: Open Settings, remotes and devices, Bluetooth\n\n*Apple Watch: Tap the AirPlay icon in the control center\n\n\nIt’s clearly not a perfect process, but Apple has to balance simplicity with functionality and I don’t think they foresee users constantly switching devices.\n\nA: They will have seamless switching as of iOS 14, iPadOS 14 and macOS Big Sur.\n\nWhen your other devices are signed in with the same Apple ID as your iPhone, AirPods automatically switch between your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Mac.\nFor example, if you’re listening to another device with your AirPods but you want to listen to your iPhone instead, start playing music, a podcast, or other audio on your iPhone. Your AirPods switch to iPhone automatically. Your AirPods also switch to iPhone when you make or answer a call on iPhone.\n\nMore details here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/switch-airpods-automatically-iph08b253c17/ios\n\nA: Directly from the Apple AirPods product page:\n\nAutomatic setup. Seamless switching.\n  AirPods connect automatically with all your Apple devices. They’re simultaneously connected to your iPhone and Apple Watch, and sound switches instantly between the devices. Want to listen to your Mac or iPad? Just choose AirPods on those devices.1\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Requires iCloud account and macOS Sierra, iOS 10, or watchOS 3.\n  \n\nAirPods have the same Bluetooth technology as your iPhone / Apple Watch. They connect automatically with your Mac as the iOS devices do. On your Mac you just change 'Speakers' to AirPods. \nThis is a big hunch: iPhone is paired with your Apple Watch / AirPods and communicates with your iCloud account to your Mac to 'trust' these devices.\n\nA: It’s not as seamless as switching from an iOS device to an Apple Watch. AirPods have to be manually switched from iOS to Mac. You can do this from the Bluetooth menu on the Mac. I also develop an app called ToothFairy that makes this easier. It lets you quickly switch your Mac to the AirPods by clicking an icon in the menu bar or by pressing a hotkey. It makes the process more seamless by showing you whether the AirPods are corrected and by automatically retrying if connecting fails the first time.\n\nA: I'm an AirPods user and so far I have not found them to switch seamlessly between my 2016 MacBook Pro and iPhone 7 Plus.\nThe switching is manual: select AirPods on the MacBook Pro, or connect Bluetooth on the iPhone. If a call comes through on the iPhone whilst on a Skype call on the MacBook Pro, you will have to pick up on the phone.\nThe \"simultaneous\" promise, so far, is marketing BS. Maybe it will work in a future software/firmware release.\n\nA: I think you'll probably find that your devices need to have Bluetooth 4 in order for the AirPods to work seamlessly. That would be the same list of devices as can fully support Continuity -- broadly speaking, anything that was first released in mid 2011 or later.\n", "Q: How to create duplicate pair of keyboard media keys for use with iTunes and streaming websites I've recently installed the Google Chrome extension Streamkeys which allows the user to use keyboard commands to perform common playback actions on popular streaming sites (Youtube, Soundcloud, and many major sites).\nFor macOS, Streamkeys default setting is to use the global Mac media keys (⏪ ▶/❚❚ ⏩).\nDue to Chrome design, global keys cannot be rebound to use modifier keys like SHIFT + ▶/❚❚.\nI like the idea of using the media keys for global Soundcloud/Youtube control, so what I'd like to do is to rebind the keyboard so that iTunes instead uses modifier keys like SHIFT + ▶/❚❚. That way, I can have the best of two worlds.\nQuestion: How can I \"duplicate\" these three keys to a new location and use them to control iTunes, while still letting Chrome think that they are in their old location? In other words, I would effectively like two pairs of the same keys, only that one pair controls iTunes and one pair controls Chrome Streamkeys.\nIs this even possible, and am I thinking about it the right way, when assuming that I would need \"duplicates\"? Just rebinding the keys would probably not work, since Chrome would still find the keys and \"take them\" for Streamkeys?\nNote again: this is about global control. It is not the same as in-tab in Chrome or in-app in iTunes.\n\nA: Install Karabiner\nWhich can be found there: Karabiner: a keyboard customizer for OS X\nAnalyse which keys are involved\nWithin Karabiner menu select Launch EventViewer... and type on\nthe music control key you would like to program.\nHere is the output you should get:\n\nMake a private.xml\nRead the Karabiner documentation on the topic: private.xml Reference Manual\nCreate the ${HOME}/Library/Application Support/Karabiner/private.xml\nwith the following content:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <item>\n    <name>Shift standard music control keys</name>\n    <identifier>Shift standard music control keys</identifier>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_PREV, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L, ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_PREV</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_PLAY, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L, ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_PLAY</autogen>\n    <autogen>__KeyToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_NEXT, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L, ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_NEXT</autogen>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\nDepending of your taste, use vi, emacs or TextEdit\n(of course not Word).\nIf you want to be clean, I would suggest you to proceed as I did.\nCreate a source with the above content in:\n${HOME}/Documents/src/Karabiner/music.xml\n\nand then install it within the Karabiner directory:\ncp ${HOME}/Documents/src/Karabiner/music.xml \"${HOME}/Library/Application Support/Karabiner/private.xml\"\n\n( The \"…\" use is necessary because of the space within Application Support. ).\nLoad your private.xml\nTell Karabiner you will use a custom setting:\n\nand load it:\n\nTest it\nCheck that this let you achieve the mapping you want to get with Chrome.\nI didn't check this part of your request, and I am not sure I understood\nit fully.\nReport success or failure, since this may help some other users .\n\nA: Alternative solution that tends to the issue of the OP, but doesn't answer the question:\nIn case someone is having the exact same issue with Streamkeys uptaking the place of media keys that should also control iTunes, I found that the best way to mitigate this issue is use the Chrome extension Extension Automation to activate Streamkeys only when sites you specify have been opened in a Chrome tab. So if Soundcloud, Youtube or any other site that you may specify isn't open in a tab, iTunes controls will work as normal.\nRebinding the Streamkey shortcuts in Chrome to something like Shift + Ctrl + (7/8/9) is also possible solution, of course.\n", "Q: Macbook 5,1 doesn't sleep correctly I have just bought a Macbook 5,1 Unibody Late-2008 (the Macbook which looks like a Macbook Pro).\nThe seller told me that the WiFi was not working anymore.

Do you think just removing the Camera cable is enough to switch Airport off completely?\nI have tried to install several OS from Moutain Lion to El Capitan and the results are the same, the computer doesn't stay on sleep. And now, after two days of work and installations, the computer doesn't want to shut down anymore. Instead, when I choose Shut Down, it restarts ..\nI don't know what to do.\nJust a small note, the previous owner had replaced the Optical Drive with a 1TB hard drive. The hard drive works correctly.\n\nA: I have seen many forum entries about problems with removing optical drive to put a second hard drive. It seems the camera/airport cable doesn't like that or may be damaged.\nIn my case, as I said, the Wifi and Bluetooth were not working anymore but the fact that there was a problem with the Airport card probably troubled the OS.\nSo I decided to unplug the camera/airport cable from the motherboard to completely remove the faulty Airport card.\nIt is done like that\nThis solution worked : now, I don't have Wifi/ Bluetooth nor iSight camera, but the computer sleeps perfectly fine and I was able to upgrade OS without any problems and it still sleeps.\nSo I presume that the faulty Airport card was still sending bad information that made the computer wakes up with no valid reason even with all Wakes' conditions unchecked. I hope that may help other people.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences -> Energy Saver -> Then untick Wake for network access.\nThis might solve the issue.\nSleep tips: Closing the lid works, but to be safe go to the Apple icon top left, then select sleep, then close lid after everything is off.

When you install OS X, it creates Recovery Partitions, which seem to be taking the rest of your available disk space.\nYou could try running Disk Utility from the OS X install DVD/USB and try to erase ALL partitions. If you don't have the installer disk, you can boot into Internet Recovery mode by holding Command + Option + R at boot chime.\nAlternatively, if you have a Windows install DVD/USB, you could boot into Windows installation, press shift+F10 and use DiskPart to format the entire drive.

I know that we can AirPlay photos, videos and music from an iOS device to an Apple TV or AirPort Express, or AirPlay enabled speakers. But can we also airplay content from iPhone or iPad to another iPhone/iPad?\n\nA: There is one way that I personally know of, and that is using Rogue Amoeba's Airfoil for Mac/Windows and Airfoil Satellite for iOS ($29 USD).\nHow to send between two iOS devices is outlined in this article (from 2012, but the principle is the same).\nBrief version of the article:\n\n\n*\n\n*You first install Airfoil on your computer, and make it act as an Airplay server.\n\n*From the iOS device playing the audio source, you then use the normal iOS AirPlay controls to pass audio to your computer.\n\n*You then download Airfoil Satellite from the App store to your second iOS device, and use that application to receive audio from your computer. You just need to assign the Satellite app as a \"client\" and it will stream audio as usual.\n\n\nIf you are thinking of streaming audio from video sources via this method, then audio will obviously not be synced in real-time with video.\nI have however used it for playing video on my iPad and then \"taking the audio with with me\" on my iPhone.

I don't know how it got there. After commenting it out, connections work again as expected.\nI think there should be no security risk in using the default ciphers.\n\nA: This the same problem on my recent upgrade to High Sierra.\nTry editing the file /etc/ssh/ssh_config and look for a line\n#   Ciphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,aes128-cbc,3des-cbc\n\nIf it is commented out, uncomment it and save the file.\nJust removing the comment cured the issue for me.\n\nA: Add these lines to ssh_config and all works again\nHostkeyAlgorithms +ssh-dss\nKexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1\n\n", "Q: OS X El Capitan and older not available on App Store? So it turns out I can not install Sierra because I have a Mid2009 Macbook Pro. I wanted to update to El Capitan, but it turns out its no longer available on the app store?\nAny ideas, how to get El Capitan? \n\nA: I am downloading it now from the App Store and it seems to be working fine.  I did not go through the App Store, but used the following link:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206886\nAfter going to the link there is a section on how to get El Capitan from the App Store if you do not meet the system requirements for MacOS Sierra.  Click on that link (pasted below) and it will open the App Store to the El Capitan App download section.  Simply click on 'Get' and it will start downloading.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1147835434?mt=12\n\nA: Edit 2019: The game has changed a lot since this QA was posted. I'd advise seeing the duplicate flagged above.\nYou can obtain El Capitan only if you are on a Mac which cannot run Sierra or higher.\nAll macOS versions, El Cap & earlier have now gone from the app store if you are on Sierra or higher. \nEdit 2016: This is true for any OS except El Capitan  - Apple are leaving it available so devices ineligible for Sierra can still obtain it.\n\nYou need to already have it in your Purchase History, otherwise once it's gone from the App Store, that's it, it's gone.\nYour only real alternative is find a friend who can get it\n... or you'd have to trust some dodgy insecure torrent etc [not at all recommended].\n\nA: Here is the answer I got this morning from Apple support:\nHere is the direct download link for El Capitan. Once you download it, you will need to click on the El Capitan Installer in your Applications folder for it to complete the installation -https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1845?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n\nA: Yes, that previous link for 10.11.1 requires that 10.11 is already installed. You can no longer find 10.11 by searching the App Store (why, who knows?), but this page has a link for upgrading to 10.11 El Capitan from the App Store if your Mac doesn't support macOS Sierra.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206886\nAfter installed, then you can update to 10.11.1 with the other link posted above.\n", "Q: Can anyone recommend a stop watch or timer which stays always on top? My requirements for software or a script are:\n\n\n*\n\n*I want to count hours when i am programming or browsing\n\n*Digits should appear on top on every app like browser or editor\n\n\nCan anyone recommend a stop watch or timer app which  stays always on top on every application for macOS?\n\nA: ActivityTimer is a Timer that's free in App Store and has an option to display countdown time in the Menu bar in digital or analog form.\nI do not know that it can count up (like a Stopwatch).\n\n\nA: If \"on top\" can mean \"stays visible in the menu bar\", then Horo is a quite nice, simple timer app, with a free version: https://matthewpalmer.net/horo-free-timer-mac/\n\nA: I use Apimac Timer, which has a free edition. It can count up (stopwatch), count down (timer), or display the current time. In \"iconized\" mode, it stays on top of other windows.\n\nEdit: Whoops. After some seconds, the free version abandons iconized/always-on-top mode and displays an ad for the paid version.\n\nA: I use Harvest, which stays on the menu bar. Tons of options– rounding up or down, billing statements, estimates, etcétera. Free for one person with two projects. I love it. I've been using it for over ten years now. iOS version too, synced.\n", "Q: Speed up Mission Control animations in macOS Sierra Introduced in macOS Sierra, the user can control how fast the Mission Control animation moves to the “end view”, by how fast the action is performed on a trackpad.\nI think the default setting is much too slow, and I don't want to overdo the gesture each time just to get better efficiency out of the animation.\nThis 2012 article refers to settings like these:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -float 0; killall Dock\n\nfor fast animations, and to reset:\ndefaults delete com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration; killall Dock\n\nI have tried them in Sierra and they don't work.\n\nA: Here's a quick list of animation-related tweaks for macOS Sierra.\n\nDon’t animate opening applications from the Dock\ndefaults write com.apple.dock launchanim -bool false\n\nSpeed up Mission Control animations\ndefaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -float 0.1\n\nRemove the auto-hiding Dock delay\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 0\n\nRemove the animation when hiding/showing the Dock\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0\n\nIncrease window resize speed for Cocoa applications\ndefaults write NSGlobalDomain NSWindowResizeTime -float 0.001\n\n\nOnce done, you'll need to killAll Finder && killAll Dock to restart those programs.\nYou can find a lot more by searching for \"dotfiles\", and the source for the changes above (as well as many, many more) can by found in this particular dotfile by Mathias Bynens. \n\nA: Aidan Marr is correct. BetterTouchTool can be used to get the old behaviour.\nFirst, disable three finger swipe up in System Preferences > Trackpad.\n\nThen, use BetterTouchTool as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the \"Trackpads\" tab at top and \"Select Application:\" \"Global\" at left.\n\n*Click \"Add New Gesture\"\n\n*Select \"Three finger swipe up\" as your gesture and \"Mission Control\" as your action.\n\n\n\nThe old behaviour is now restored and you will be able to use:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -float 0.1\n\nNote, that you can use a similar process for \"App Exposé\"\nBonus Tip: Since \"Mission Control\" is still a standalone App on your system you could use the utility of your choice to invoke it. For example, you could have Keyboard Maestro invoke it with a particular keystroke. Invoking the app this way uses the old (pre-Sierra) behaviour.\n\nA: Adding onto Shelton's answer here:\nThe application BetterTouchTool (paid application, but you get a free trial to start off) allows you to customize trackpad gestures, and it appears that it does not follow the speed of your gestures.\nThe animation is as fast as it was in El Capitan - or seems that way at least.\n\nA: I can recommend TotalSpaces2 which can hack newer OS X versions and disable spaces animation. It's paid software but there is free trial: https://totalspaces.binaryage.com\nNote: requires disabling System Integrity Protection for installation: https://totalspaces.binaryage.com/sipsettings\n\nA: I used:\n\ndefaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration–float 0\n\nSo I just deleted the space between duration and -float, and it looks like it worked actually!\n", "Q: Move a full screen app to second monitor In Mac OS X El Capitan, is there a shortcut to move full screen apps between monitors?\nMy current method is first bringing the app out of full screen mode, then drag it to the second monitor and then maximize it again.\nI wish there was a shortcut to just move it from monitor 1 to monitor 2.\nedit: I'm not talking about moving between workspaces on a single monitor... I am talking about 2 monitors.\n\nA: In case you wanted to do so with your keyboard only, expanding @Fralec's answer:\nI use Spectacle (as of 2021, no longer being maintained) as well, and the following sequence does the job:\n\n*\n\n*Cmd+Alt+F - Exit from full screen on current monitor\n\n\n*Shift+Cmd+Alt+→/← - Move to next screen\n\n\n*Cmd+Alt+F - Enter full screen on the next monitor\nHope that does the trick for you :)\n\nA: You can use BetterTouchTool to configure a keyboard command triggering a two-step action, which first moves your application to the next monitor, and then makes it fullscreen.\nTo switch the fullscreen app back to the first screen, just press the keyboard command twice and it will move over.\n\n\nA: You can use Mission Control (formerly known as Exposé) to move full screen apps across monitors. Mission Control initially shows lists of workspaces across the top of all monitors, and when you move the mouse cursor up into that area they change into thumbnails. If you drag one of the thumbnails from one monitor to another, the workspace corresponding to that thumbnail moves to that monitor. A thumbnail for a primary desktop can be rearranged within its own monitor, but it can't be dragged to another monitor.\nTo clarify what I mean by primary desktop, each monitor initially has a workspace without full screen applications, and additional workspaces for full screen applications (which, in El Capitan, can contain one or two applications apiece). What I'm calling a primary desktop is that initial workspace. The + in the upper right corner of each monitor while Mission Control is active can create a new desktop, and a desktop created that way can be moved across monitors, but the desktop which was not created that way remains on its own monitor. \nKeyboard shortcuts and trackpad gestures are available for Mission Control.\n\nA: Many Tricks Moom seems to have this functionality also. I just found out about that $10 app today (I've been using the mentioned Spectacle for the task, however, Moom also has a feature to re-arrange windows to chosen locations, etc.)\n\nA: I use a free app called Spectacle to manage my windows.\nIf you hold Shift+Alt+⌘+→ or ←, you can easily move your window from one monitor to another.\n\nA: Its simple 3 steps:\n\n*\n\n*Let's get the title first\nOpen the Finder, select Window then the complete title Move to UE......\n\n\n\n*Now Create a Shortcut in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts\nAdd a shortcut as I have added in the image for All Applications and the shortcut keys you prefer.\n\n\n\n*You are done. Use it, add more\n\n", "Q: Find files in Terminal by kind - not extension? I have about 50,000 files in a folder tree which show up as the correct \"Kind\" in Finder (\"Sound Designer II audio\") but which have no extension.\nI want to find all these and rename them to *.sd2 in Terminal.\nCan the find command be used to find by \"kind\" without any extension?\n\nA: To search all files with a distinctive kind use the command:\nmdfind 'kMDItemKind=\"Sound Designer II audio\"'\n\nIf this is not sufficient you can also use the type code (yyyy below is a place holder only)\nmdfind 'kMDItemFSTypeCode=\"yyyy\"'\n\nYou should be able get an (unknown) type code of a Sound Designer II audio file by executing mdls \"/path/to/Sound Designer II audio file\" | grep kMDItemFSTypeCode\n", "Q: With Safari, can I allow pop-ups for specific sites? I have chosen \"Block popup windows\" in Safari's security tab, yet there are a couple of sites for work that still use popups for login etc. Is there a way to add exceptions (in advanced settings or directly in the plist file perhaps?) Or maybe via a Safari extension?\n\nA: Yes, with Safari Version 12 or higher, you can allow popups for a specific website. Here are step-by-step instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the URL (when you're NOT in a text entry mode)\n\n\n*Select \"Settings for This Website...\"\n\n*Select \"Allow\" under \"Pop-up Windows\"\n \n\nA: There isn't any exception list for popups in Safari.  It's an \"all-or-nothing\" approach for now.\nI recommend telling Apple your thoughts on the Safari feedback page: http://www.apple.com/feedback/safari.html\nEDIT 12/20: This answer is correct as of the time it was written.  Since then, Apple has added the ability to control popups per site.  This answer by @matt-chandler is the correct one for newer versions of Safari.  I'm leaving this answer here in case it helps people on older versions of Safari.\n", "Q: Cant get any sound from MacBook Pro with headphones plugged in When I plug my headphones into my MacBook Pro or when I return to my MacBook Pro after the headphones have been plugged in for a while, sometimes I get no sound, the Sound icon in the Menu bar is greyed out and when I click the Sound up button on the keyboard I get the below icon (see screenshot). If I take the headphones out and wait a couple of seconds then replug them in they work again. \nHeadphone wise I've seen this happen with a range of headphones from Apple EarPods to Bose noise canceling headphones. \nI've seen this happen on two Mid 2012 MacBook Pro models, a 15\" and  13\", both running OS X 10.10.\nAny ideas what's causing this and how I can be resolved? \nJust in case any one mentions it, I'm plugging the headphones into the 3.5 mm headphone jack not the cinema audio port.\n\n\nA: The next time it happens please option-click (hold 'option' while clicking) on the volume icon in the menu bar.\nThere you should see all available sound cards and headphones.\nPlease let us know what entries you can see.\nI get to very same response if I plug in a USB mixer.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 13 with Retina display consumes 10% battery overnight with the lid closed, is this normal?

and PRAM\n5.Putting the pc in safe mode\nUpdate 2 :\nAfter talking to Apple costumer services they told me too:\n1.Remove a program called Dropbox.\n2.Remove an extensions from Safari, in my case It was an addblocking one.\n3.Try to create a test user to see if the battery still drains.\nUpdate 3 :\nAfter talking to Apple costumer services for several times, they couldn't pinpoint the problem so they told me to have my pc checked for hardware problems. Thing I will do after my school exams ends...\nThe problem still persist's even after this steps.\n\nA: Update : This doesn't work with Catalina, see Django Reinhardt's answer instead.\nI was suffering the same issue before, my MBP 2015's battery was draining slowly but when I don't use it so frequently, this caused so much pain.\nThis method helped me so much; now I can go out with my Mac with 20% charge and make my day.\nThere is a significant difference between MacBook Pro 2015 and the previous models of MacBook Pros. You can check these settings by this command line;\nioreg -l | grep IOPlatformFeatureDefaults\n\nThe output on your mac would be like this;\n\n{\"TCPKeepAliveDuringSleep\"=Yes,\"DNDWhileDisplaySleeps\"=No,\"TCPKeepAliveExpirationTimeout\"=43200,\"NotificationWake\"=Yes}\n\nTo make your MBP sleep deep like the old versions you should first restart your computer into recovery mode. To do that you should restart your mac and hold CMD+R until you hear the start up sound.\nAfter that open terminal and type this;\ncsrutil disable\n\nThen restart your MacBook again.\nGo to this destination, you can access inside kext files by right clicking -> Show Package Contents\n  /System/Library/Extensions/IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/X86PlatformPlugin.kext/Contents/Resources\nFind your board id with:\nioreg -l | awk '/board-id/{print $4}' | sed 's/[<\">]//g'\n\nOpen <your_board_id>.plist (e.g. Mac-E43C1C25D4880AD6.plist) file by a text editor and edit these settings just like these;\n<key>TCPKeepAliveDuringSleep</key>\n<false/>\n<key>NotificationWake</key>\n<false/>\n<key>DNDWhileDisplaySleeps</key>\n<true/>\n\nTCPKeepAliveDuringSleep keeps your MacBook connections open when its sleeping, so it keep Wifi connected.\nNotificationWake wakes your Mac randomly to check notifications especially make this one false.\nDNDWhileDisplaySleeps means \"Do not disturb on sleep\"; MacBook does get disturbed by notifications when it's asleep.\nMy personal opinion is this process should be done by every 2015+ MacBook user because MacBooks are not cell phones that ring for notifications. Apple should have made a toggle button for this.\nDo not forget to enable System Integrity Protection again. You should restart into recovery mode and on terminal type \"csrutil enable\" and restart.\nUPDATE: This reportedly no longer works with the latest versions of macOS. See this MacRumors article for more info.\n\nA: This is not normal, but it is, at the least, very clear in the logs that there are ACK packets being processed, and your wireless card is preventing the laptop from sleeping normally. The logs are in line with developer notes for events available to make the computer wake up, and log that it is \"slow\", so far example, as OzzieSpin said in a comment above, your computer is waking up abnormally--unless (as also several comments above discussed, it is trying to connect with something)--for example verify, bluetooth is off, nothing is connect to the computer in any way, including the SD card slot,the computer was not connected to any type of server e.g. smb shared-drives or ldap, and there are no programs at all running (yes, including Safari, or Drop Box, which both could cause exactly these symtoms), including those you don't expect (see for example your \"start-up\" items under Users & Groups in System Preferences, and $USER/Library/LaunchAgents). Would you please post the output of sudo ifconfig?\nYou can verify this by looking at this nearly identical post on Apple's website, where the OP comes back after receiving Apple support, and decides that the issue was an incompatible wireless access point or router, and a firmware upgrade on the router solved the issue, apparently.  That link as well as this one, contains long lists of things you need to check, directly from Apple, and \n\nI would be surprised if your issue doesn't go away after walking\n  through those posts alone.\n\nMoving on a bit further, the usual action, if I had not seen those posts would be to reset your SMC (instructions by model, here), and PRAM. Plug in your laptop to the wall, close all applications/save your data, then hold down Cmd+Opt+Shift and press the power button. The screen should turn off instantly. Then, wait 10 seconds. Next, while it is off, hold Cmd+Opt+P+R then press the power button. Keep holding those buttons until you hear the chime, the screen lights up, then turns off again.  After ensuring you'd turned off services (see the links above), and then reset the hardware, you could mostly eliminate the computer as the sole source of the issue.\nAs a side note here, since Sierra literally just came out, then depending on your situation, you might wait until the bugs are worked out a bit before upgrading.  \n\nA: The problem is the macOS continues to check for updates (including email, software, news, etc.) while your MacBook Pro is asleep (this feature is called \"Power Nap\"). This means it's very quick to get up and running when you open your MacBook, but it also means your battery goes down while it's asleep.\nThe problem some people have is that even with \"Power Nap\" disabled, their battery still goes down as MacOS continues to check for updates (it's possibly other software checking online for things).\nTo fix this, you can tell you MacBook Pro to disconnect from the Internet while it's asleep, preventing online checks.\nTo do this, you need to set the tcpkeepalive setting to 0. \nOpen up Terminal and type:\nsudo pmset -b tcpkeepalive 0\n\nAfter you enter your password for sudo it gives you a warning saying some features may not work properly. This is fine, it simply disables Internet access during sleep.\nYou can check it is set correctly by running:\npmset -g\n\nWhich should show \"tcpkeepalive 0\"\nAnd you can, of course, reverse it at any time by running:\nsudo pmset -b tcpkeepalive 1\n\nSimple!\nNote: You can also force your Mac not to connect to the Internet when it's asleep even when connected to a power supply, if you like: sudo pmset -a tcpkeepalive 0. (Personally I don't mind as long as it's not using my battery, so -b is fine for me.)\nAlso note: The results from pmset -g will vary depending on if your MacBook Pro is connected to power or not when you run the command. It will reflect the current tcpkeepalive setting, depending on its current power situation.\n\nA: Here's a less invasive solution that worked for me: enable Do Not Disturb while while the MacBook is sleeping.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences -> Notifications\n\n*Under the Do Not Disturb section, add a check mark next to \"When the display is sleeping\"\n\n", "Q: macOS 10.12 Sierra will not forget my ssh keyfile passphrase After creating a new encrypted id-rsa key file with ssh-keygen and using it for the first time, I cannot get macOS to forget the passphrase. This is similar to how to make OS X not remember ssh key passphrase question but worse.\nI tried rebooting, killing the ssh-agent, locking all my keychains but it still seems to be stored somewhere. However, I cannot find it in any keychains. This seems to be very insecure. The answers to SSH private key password never removed with Keychain/ssh-agent also do not help. \nIn fact, the dialog that used to appear asking you whether you wanted to store the passphrase or not does not seem to exist anymore.\n\nA: ssh-add -K -d\n\nThis can remove passphrases previously stored in the keychain. Since macOS 10.12 Sierra, to avoid the passphrase stored in the keychain again, be sure to do ssh-add first.\n\nA: To disable storing passphrase in keychain you should add following lines to ~/.ssh/config file:\nHost *\nUseKeyChain no\n\nIf you already have passphrase stored in keychain you can delete it using commands:\ncd ~/Library/Keychains/<UUID>/\nsqlite3 keychain-2.db 'delete from genp where agrp=\"com.apple.ssh.passphrases\"'\n\nIf you would like to have a behavior like in OS X El Capitan or earlier (i.e. passphrase stored until logout or restart) simply add to ~/.ssh/config:\nAddKeysToAgent yes\n\nYou don't need to start ssh-agent.\n\nA: Thanks to Clive, I have a better understanding of this new 'feature'. When you type in your passphrase Sierra adds it to your Keychain but not to the ssh-agent. If your identity isn't in ssh-agent there is no way to manage it with ssh-add. To manage (ie. remove) your identity from Keychain you need to add your identity to ssh-agent by using ssh-add. Once you have added your identity to ssh-agent you can use ssh-add -K -d to remove it from both ssh-agent and Keychain. If you want your identity to be added to ssh-agent every time you use ssh add:\nAddKeysToAgent yes\n\nto your .ssh/config. This will ensure that ssh-agent always has your identity. \n", "Q: Unable to connect Time Machine to WD MyCloud EX2 on Sierra I updated to Sierra yesterday and now my Time Machine backups to my WD MyCloud EX2 NAS aren't working any more.

Because of this, it feels like the computer is laggy when scrolling a page, but it's probably due to the way the software scrolls. \n\n\nSierra just came out, but I'm not that hopeful that Logitech are capable of tending to issues like these, so I'm afraid I will have to do something about it myself.\nI have tried checking the settings of System Preferences > Mouse and System Preferences > Logitech Control Center > Vertical Scroll but came up with nothing except temporary band-aid tweaks to make it feel better.\nEdit, Broken Mouse Buttons: Also related to this, is the issue that the Forward/Back buttons on some Logitech mice have stopped working. I was able to mitigate this issue by binding those buttons to keystrokes in Logitech Control Center, e.g. (⌘ + ←) and (⌘ + →) for Google Chrome. Possibly, something like BetterTouchTool, Steermouse, or USB Overdrive could be used to intercept the OS functions Forward/Back in case the keyboard shortcuts above aren't global for all applications. Regardless, with BetterTouchTool, you can set application-specific keystrokes and bind them to mouse buttons.\n\nA: Smooze helped me get rid of all annoyances, after several months of problems. After having tried some common suggestions like USB Overdrive and SteerMouse to no results, I tried this new app which also appears to be actively developed with new updates at the time of this post.\nI found that Smooze was able to create the scrolling behaviour I like – which is non-smoothed linear scrolling with no acceleration curves. It also provides very customizable settings for those who likes smoothing, with different curve selections and speeds.\nThe paid version includes some additional features, like cursor gesture shortcuts, but I think you can solve the issues with the free version.\nNote: If you're planning to use this app, you should uninstall Logitech Control Center or it might not work as you'd like. If you're dependent on LCC for special buttons like the Thumb Button and so forth, I recommend that you get something like BetterTouchTool and create custom bindings instead.\n\nNB: My model is Logitech Performance MX.\n\nA: MacOS 10.12.2 fixes the Smooth Scrolling inertia issues with and without LCC 3.9.5 installed.  \nUnfortunately, with LCC 3.9.5 installed on 10.12.2, there is an issue with highlighting text and scrolling, where the highlighted text loses its focus. There's a separate SE post for this issue.\n\nA: The 3.9.5 version, published on Sep 22, 2016 by Logitech solves most of the issues. The scroll is smooth again in Chrome. Unfortunately the inertia is still a bit high in native apps like XCode, but not as bad as before I guess.\n\nA: Until Logitech fixes their drivers, I can confirm that using USB Overdrive is a viable workaround for the single-line scrolling issue on Mac OS Sierra using Logitech Gaming Software for Mac v8.87.92. I have not tested it with Logitech Control Center since my G700 mouse does not work with LCC. \nWhat's interesting is that I have both LGS and USB Overdrive installed together, and all my mouse bindings in LGS continue to work correctly. I have USB Overdrive configured for \"G700 Laser Mouse, Any Application\" and under \"Advanced Options\" I chose \"Configure Missing Buttons to do Nothing\". I then configured Wheel Up and Wheel Down for \"Scroll\" using speed \"Accelerated\" (I also tested \"1 Page\", \"1 line\", \"2 lines\" etc) and it works correctly.\nI now can scroll one line at a time using the mouse wheel in all my applications.\n\nA: Since the latest version of the Logitech Control Center still has a lot of issues (most notably, OS freezes/crashes), and since I was already using BetterTouchTools, I just uninstalled Logitech Control Center. \nThe scroll works fine without LCC and the only thing that was missing was the mouse button actions (back/forward and wheel left/right), but that was easily fixed using BetterTouchTools.\nNo more macOS crashes! :D\n\nA: It's odd - that's the experience I had after upgrading to Yosemite several years ago with my Performance Mouse MX – I'm surprised you had it working past that point!\nFor me, the best solution (though it did not perfectly mimic the previous behavior) was to install BetterTouchTool and use the \"advanced\" configuration options to get it to mimic the inertia and acceleration of the original behavior (in a way that playing around with the default OS X settings was unable to accomplish). Here's a screenshot of that dialog (not configured):\n\nI tried installing new & old versions of the OS X Logitech drivers and control panel to no avail; a few months later, I ended up switching to a combination wired/BT Razor mouse instead (even though I don't game) just to experiment with this issue and discovered it only affected/plagued Logitech mice..\n\nA: This is a problem with more than Logitech mice.  I had this problem with an old, generic Dell USB mouse as well.\nUSB Overdrive solved this problem right away.\n", "Q: Apple Watch unlock feature for macOS Sierra requires turning off 2-step-verification Yesterday I installed macOS Sierra and now I want to enable this new feature - unlocking MacBook with Apple Watch.\nI opened Security & Privacy settings and tried to check this option (Allow your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac). It asked me for my iCloud (Apple ID) password, I provided it, but then it showed me the following message:\n\nSome additional info (if it's relevant):\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)\n\n*macOS Sierra 10.12\n\n*Bluetooth LMP Version: 4.2 (0x8)\n\n\nAnd yes, I have two-step verification enabled in my Apple ID for about a year now:\n\nSo, to have this feature enabled I need to reduce protection of the entire Apple ID? Can I bypass this requirement and use the watch to unlock my Mac?\n\nA: You need to disable two-step verification and enable two-factor authentication.\nIf you follow the steps in this article, it will show you how you can use your Watch to wake-up your Mac.  One of the key parts is at the bottom of the article:\n\nFor those of you using the original Two-Step Verification instead of the Two-Factor Authentication feature introduced with iOS 10, you will need to disable Two-Step Verification on the Apple ID management site and then enable Two-Factor Authentication on an iOS device. A passcode also needs to be established on the Apple Watch. \n\n\nA: No - Apple's code to perform the unlock explicitly doesn't support two factor. I was willing to change my security, but understand your concerns.\nThe workaround would be to use a third party unlock service like https://www.macid.co and use their software to unlock your computer.\nSadly, I don't think their implementation is as efficient, reliable or secure as Apple's so I'm making the change Apple asked. My speculation is two-step will be shut off within a year and that two-factor will become more secure than it is today. Those are guesses and opinion, though.\n", "Q: Disabling Voice Control, or at least muting it (iOS 10) I have an iPhone 6S recently updated to iOS 10.0.1.  \nHolding the Home button for about 1 second activates Voice Control, with a characteristic loud double beep.  This is very easy to activate accidentally, which is especially undesirable if I am trying to discreetly check my phone during a meeting or something.  It's also easy to accidentally push the button when the phone is in my pocket (and locked).\nI have no interest in actually using Voice Control at all, and it's very important to me that my phone not make unwanted noise.\nIs it possible to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Voice Control entirely?\n\n*Stop it from beeping when activated?  (It doesn't respect the hardware Mute switch.)\n\n*Reduce the volume of the beep?  (It doesn't seem to respect the ringer volume.)\n\n*Prevent Voice Control from activating when the phone is locked?  (I would also prefer that unauthorized people not be able to use its features.)\nI saw Disable voice control on iPhone 4s, ios7.1 which suggests turning on Siri.  Indeed, Siri has options to disable access on lock screen, and to turn off \"voice feedback\", making it silent.  But for privacy reasons I do not want to enable Siri.  \nSince that question relates to much older versions of hardware and software, I am hoping that something has changed since then.  (Also, unlike in that question, my Home button works fine physically.)\n\nA: As of iOS 10.2.1 (maybe as early as 10.2), it is possible to disable Voice Control.  \nSettings > General > Accessibility > Home Button\n\nThere is a setting PRESS AND HOLD TO SPEAK.  Set this to Off.  The descriptive text is \"There will be no response when you press and hold the Home button.\"\nI would like to thank Bob Briscoe for providing this answer, which he received from Apple Support. Since the question is protected, he cannot post an answer himself, so I am posting on his behalf.\n\nA: There seems to be no way to disable it under iOS 10.\n\nA: There is a possible work-around. I haven't tried it myself, but here are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Under Settings > Siri, enable Siri (temporarily; you will be disabling it again later).\n\n*Under Settings > Touch ID & Passcode (or simply Passcode for devices prior to iPhone 6), turn on SIRI (again) on this screen, a new option should have appeared called Voice Dial. Disable it.\n\n*Go back into Settings > Siri and disable Siri again.\n\nA: You can lower the volume for it or mute it altogether.\nWhen the voice control screen pops up, press on your iPhone's volume down key to the desired level.\n\nA: You either have Siri on, but remove her access to the home screen, or you have voice control on the home screen. There are no currently options to disable both.\nWith Siri on but no access to the home screen you won't have the pinging, but you'll have to live knowing Siri knows everything about you. If you disable her, the voice control ping comes back to the home screen. Hopefully Apple updates this garbage \"update\" soon.\n", "Q: Microsoft keyboard requiring double capslock press after Sierra update I installed Sierra last night and my Microsoft Wireless Comfort keyboard suddenly started requiring me to press CapsLock two times in order for it to activate caps lock.\nI plugged in an Apple keyboard to test, and that still works as intended. \nIs there a setting that I'm missing?\n\nA: Installing IntelliType for your Mircosoft Confort Keyboard Ergo 4000 on macOS X 10.11 (El Capitan) or later will not work. Microsoft didn't update their driver in a while (since 10.7) and didn't sign the extension as they should have done for it to work with the latest versions of macOS.\nYou could eventually deactivate the security features, but I don't think it worth taking this risk for a keyboard driver. The keyboard works fine without driver, only missing the \"Favorites\" buttons.\nIf you really want to customize the \"Favorites\" shortcut buttons, ControllerMate seems to be a great driver with a great mapping that makes them easily customizable. It is up-to-date and compatible with macOS 10.14 Mojave.\n", "Q: Install Keynote on a third generation ipad I have a third generation Ipad with ios 9.5.3.\nIn the app store I can try to buy Keynote.\nEverytime I do that, the app store begin telling me that I need IOS 10.\nBefore IOS 10, how could people get keynote on a third generation ipad?\nAnd now?\n\nA: You should see a message to download the latest version compatible with your iOS version.

I want to turn off the little squiggle in the bottom right corner of the Messages keyboard (the one that activates drawing mode). How can I do this? Is there a setting?\n \n(I know the keyboard in the bottom right screen turns off drawing in landscape mode, but I want to permanently disable the feature.)\n\nA: You can just delete the default Apple keyboard in the settings in favor of a different one. For example, you could download Google's keyboard Gboard, then go into the Keyboard settings, and delete the only labeled \"English\". \nHey presto, now you only have the Google keyboard, and it won't bring up the drawing mode whatsoever.\n\nA: To Turn off handwriting in landscape mode go turn your phone to the side to activate it. Then tap on the keyboard in the bottom right. This should keep the iPhone to a keyboard when you go to landscape.\n\nA: Unfortunately you can't on Apple's keyboard, there's no setting to turn it off.\nApple decided to include some additional features to the keyboard for the larger devices.\nYou can, however, send Apple a feedback. Sometimes they change some introduced features or add an option to disable certain behaviors.\n\nA: This is to address those who use 3rd party keyboards and can't get the setting to 'stick'...\nTo correctly disable the handwriting mode:\nThe first step is where most people aren't addressing the iOS keyboard needing to be set as default as a condition of retaining settings after they are made regarding itself.\nCrazy, I know.\nSet iphone to default iOS keyboard in settings, \nOpen an sms conversation and tap the text input area to get a blinking cursor\nRotate to landscape\nTap the keyboard icon bottom right, type something, send it.\nYou may at this point consider yourself finished and designate your favorite 3rd party keyboard in settings, confident in the knowledge that you won't ever have to be blinded by a huge white screen when in another app in landscape and try to reply on the fly.\nI use SwiftKey on both iOS and Android exclusively.\n\nA: Go to a message, turn it sides to get the canvas, then press the keyboard button in the corner. This now makes the landscape mode the keyboard instead of the canvas.\n\nA: Turn your phone to the landscape mode where you see the free writing displayed. In the right lower hand corner, tap the keyboard and it will turn it off. It won't prevent your phone going to the keyboard in landscape mode, though @bombtwinz \n\nA: Unfortunately there are no settings built in to iOS to permanently disable this feature, only work-arounds.\nVarious online sources show that the recommended fix is to install another keyboard app from the App Store that doesn't include a drawing feature (ex. Swift Keyboard, Gboard, etc.)\nFor those that don't want to download another 3rd party app to fix their problem, there is a Temporary quick fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start a text message and then tilt your phone to get the (annoying)\ncanvas.\n\n*When it pops up you will see a keyboard icon on the bottom right; click\nit!\n\n\nFrom now on the canvas feature will not pop up again.\n", "Q: What happens to shared photos when i delete them locally? I am running out of space on my 16 GB iphone 6 (shocker.)\nI have about 400 family photos that i've taken, and added to a shared album.  All of these photos are stored locally on my iPhone. \nIf i remove any of those photos from my phone to free up space, are they also removed from the shared album?  (that would be bad.)\nMore generally: what are the semantics of shared photos? are they copies? symlinks? \nSettings: \n\n\n*\n\n*General>Icloud>Photos\n\n\n*\n\n*ICloud photo library is on\n\n*optimize phone storage is checked\n\n*upload to my photo stream is on\n\n*icloud photo sharing is on.\n\n\n\nI have backups and syncs to my macbook on a fairly routine basis, and i'm also using google photos specifically for photo backup independent of any of the above settings. \n\nA: Removing photos from your Camera Roll will not remove them from Shared Albums. It will, however, remove them from iCloud Photo Library, both in iCloud itself and all of your devices.\nIf you have iCloud Photo Library turned on and the Optimize Phone Storage setting enabled, there's no way to further reduce the amount of storage taken by photos in your camera roll other than simply deleting them (again, subject to the caveat in the first paragraph).\nDeleting photos using Photos.app should not affect their storage in the Google Photos cloud. (Deleting them with Google Photos will cause them to be removed from the Google Photos cloud.)\n\nA: As tubedogg pointed out, the photos removed from Icloud Photo Library will still be available from the shared albums (because they are copies) BUT be aware that shared copies are scaled down to a resolution of 2048px on the long edge (5400 px for panoramic photos).\nSo if you share a 20 megapixel photo via Icloud Photo Sharing, the shared photo will be something like 3,5 MP (generally, not related to the deletion). \nSee https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202786 for more on these limitations.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra Download Time Est 33 hours I have tested my network download speed (hit 132 Mbps, but that was to server within 100 miles), changed the DNS server address to 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4, restarted my macbook, but the download time will not change! Please tell me there is something else I can do to fix this.

Once you're connected, DNS is not even relevant. Your own ISP's DNS would normally be faster anyway, as it's [theoretically] optimised for your connection.\nRebooting your router/modem & all network hardware, then your Mac may help a bit, fresh everything up.\n\nA: this always happens, think of the size of the update, imagine thousands of people doing that at once, hundreds of gigabytes, will rack up very fast, give them time, and your update will be with you, in time, the best time is to leave it to update at US nighttime, when the servers are at the least load. \n", "Q: Hide Siri's window on macOS Sierra After asking Siri a question on macOS Sierra -- her response window just stays pinned in the upper right corner.\nIs there a keyboard shortcut or another siri command to hide that window without having to click the small \"x\" button?  Maybe a way to make it automatically close after some time has passed?\n\nA: Without Type to Siri enabled, you may close the Siri window at any time by pressing the ESC key. However, I am unaware of a way to automatically close Siri after some time has passed or by using the keyboard with Type to Siri.\n\nA: If you've enabled \"Type To Siri\" and find that ESC doesn't close the window, try typing \"nevermind\" and hitting enter. In my case, Siri replies \"ok\" and the window closes.\nA further refinement is to set up a keyboard shortcut for nevermind \"nmd\" to save on the typing.  \"bye\" also closes the window but Siri says it is \"Nice talking with you\" and that is more annoying than \"ok\".  Of course you can also suppress Siri read responses, and you probably have if you're using \"Type To Siri\".\n\nA: Another option (besides the esc key) is cmd+..\nThis is useful if you're on a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, and you're in an app where the esc has turned into something else (like while playing full-screen video).\n\nA: there is a workaround for that which actually works pretty awesome. i hope its ok to post the link:\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/3096187/macs/how-to-make-siri-activate-when-you-say-hey-siri-to-your-mac-running-macos-sierra.html\n", "Q: Cannot ping my local machine I have just updated my Mac to macOS Sierra 10.12.

So if you put the following in your /etc/hosts file:\n127.0.0.1:3000 foo\n\nthen a curl foo should send a GET request to the local host on port 3000.  However there is a wrinkle, because aparently on OSX 10.11.6 it doesn't use /etc/hosts instead it uses /private/etc/hosts, so then adding the above line to that file should work.

Thank you in advance. \n\nA: WatchOS 2 is supported only on devices running iOS 9 and higher.\nThe only way to run an Apple Watch using an iPhone running iOS 8.4 is to have an Apple Watch with watchOS 1.x.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra Installer not launching: The application “Install macOS Sierra” can’t be opened So, I downloaded the second GM before the public release, tried to open it and got this error: The application “Install macOS Sierra” can’t be opened.\nI then downloaded the public release from the Mac AppStore, same problem.\n\nI tried using chmod +x /..../Contents/MacOS/Install/InstallAssistant, made the app open but immediately stops responding.\n\nNote: I did download both files from another Mac, put them on USB and brought them home, I always used this method and it worked, not working now.\nI'm on a late 2013 MacBook Pro (15 inch).\nAny suggestions or ideas on why this error is occurring?\n\nA: I know it sounds stupid, but I compressed the file and transferred it to my personal Mac via USB, decompressed and it worked, but seriously couldn't find out what was causing that error. \n", "Q: How do I get into an app from Notification Center on iOS 10? In iOS 9 and earlier, you could tap any notification center row to be brought into the app, usually deep-linked to the source of the notification. Swiping on the notification revealed other options.\nIn iOS 10, 3D touch or long press is used to get those other options, but simply tapping on the notification does not get you into the source app. Is there a way to do this in iOS 10?\n\nA: Every notification can be 3D touched (or long-pressed) -- not just those with other actions. After popping open the notification, tap on the application name and icon in the notification header to open the app.\n\nA: I believe it's a bug in iOS 10.0.1. It seems to work about half the time, with no particular pattern between which notifications work and which don't (i.e. it's not a particular set of apps that work or don't work). One interesting note is that if a tap isn't working, and I 3D Touch the notification, even tapping on the resulting \"enlargement\" (for lack of a better word) sometimes doesn't work, either.\nFrom the lock screen, swiping left-to-right on a notification opens up the app (unless the phone is still locked, in which case you get a passcode screen first).

Is there any difference between an iPod 5th Generation (80GB, late 2006) and an iPod Classic (160GB, late 2009)?\nThe 80GB iPod works perfectly with a USA-SPEC PA-12 adapter for a BMW car stereo and a simple 30-pin to USB adapter for input to a receiver. The newer 160GB iPod is not recognized and will not play.\nI also have a SONY RDP-X500iP Dock. The newer 160GB iPod works with it, but the old 80GB iPod does not.\nCan anyone help me with these two iPods?\n\nA: Well, of course there are differences. :)\nHowever, the only difference I can see that may impact your usage is that the latest version of the OS that will run on these iPods is different. The 160GB iPod can run up to version 2.0.5 of the OS while the 80GB iPod can only run up to version 1.3. So I suspect your issue may have something to do with what the OS supports.\nIn terms of the USB connectivity via the built-in 30 pin port, they both support USB 2 high power charging, so it's not likely to be a physical port issue.\nYou could probably find a different 30-pin to USB adapter that will work for the 160GB iPod for input to the receiver in the BMW, but that may involve a fair bit of trial and error.\n\nA: The USA-SPEC PA-12 adapter and SONY RDP-X500iP speaker dock support a limited number of iPod models.\nThe user guide for the USA-SPEC PA-12 says:\n\niPod Classic is not compatible with Hybrid Mode if its firmware is 1.1 or newer.

My startup disk was formatted as \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)\". Then I installed macOS Sierra, and it prompted me to turn on FileVault. I did, not remembering that the disk was already encrypted, and it went through the slow process of encrypting the data.\nIs my disk double-encrypted now? I assumed it wouldn't have asked me to turn on FileVault if it was already encrypted. Should I turn FileVault off again?\n\nA: Don't think it's double-encrypted.

Also make sure Google Photos is not running in the background, or else it could think it is Wifi and upload the 500MB of photos you took recently.\n\nA: Hotspot = WiFi. When you connect from the client, you access it through the WiFi settings. There's no way to limit the type of data or usage used as from the client's perspective, it's not a cellular connection.\n\nA: I was facing the same challenge, and I found out there is an application that will block access to all applications expect the one you choose too.

I don't know of a way to recover from this specific error without reinstalling an OS, though I speculate that grabbing the /System/Library/Kernels/kernel file from a healthy Mac and putting it on the computer could help recover.\nSince I'll be reinstalling an OS anyway, I might as well install Sierra for real.

I updated to MacOS Sierra, and since then I have been getting a message (via CleanMyMac which tells me this sort of thing) that ZoomWindow is not responding.\nI get the impression that ZoomWindow is part of the system, but anything I find on the Internet is either uninformative or useless.\nWhat is ZoomWindow, and should it be unresponsive like this?\n\nA: ZoomWindow is a process that runs under \"Accessibility\" options (System Preferences). I had this turned on because of poor eyesight, and occasionally I would want to use a keyboard shortcut to zoom in on a specific area of the screen (think of the Magnifying Glass in Windows). I never stopped to think that it would be a constantly-running process that was using RAM and (very little) CPU, but when you're running a system as old as mine, you need every tiny resource you can free up. I turned off the \"Accessibility\" option in my Taskbar, but all that did was prevent the little \"Accessibility\" icon from showing up; ZoomWindow (or some derivative) would always be in Activity Monitor.\nJust messing around with it, I discovered you can turn this process off by going into System Preferences, Accessibility, then selecting Zoom, and UN-checking the box that read \"Use keyboard shortcuts to zoom\"; also, you want to check \"More Options\" (from the Accessibility window), and make sure \"Enable temporary zoom\" is also UN-checked.\nI had tried to Force-Quit the process countless times in Activity Monitor, and each time, it would close, then immediately come right back; by using the steps described above, I opened Activity Monitor and discovered that the ZoomWindow process was no longer running.

I have mapped NAS drives to connect to on startup, using System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items.\nKeychain does save the login information, but it only appears pre-filled, and the network locations aren't automatically mounted on start-up.\nSo every time I boot the machine, I am presented with a \"Connect\" dialogue with pre-filled passwords.\nIn El Capitan, there was no need to manually authorize mapped network locations.\nI don't know if changing to an iCloud-based Keychain and Two-Factor Authorization in conjunction with the Sierra updated changed anything.\nI have tried removing the mappings from Login Items and adding them again, as well as rebooting etc. I have tried this on two separate computers and I have the same issue on both.\n\n\nA: @Winterflags I believe you're experiencing a glitch, because I'm using Mac OS sierra and it worked 100% as intended/expected.\nIf you want to repeat my steps, I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Finder > Connect to Server\n\n*I browsed and connected to another mac in the house and selected root volume\n\n*As the login details were already in Keychain, the volume opened.\n\n*Finder > Go Computer - this showed my local volume and the mounted volume\n\n* > System Preferences > Users & Groups > my account > Login Items\n\n*I dragged the mounted volume to the Login Items. It showed the volume name and its kind is \"Volume\"\n\n*Logged out.\n\n*Logged back in - volume auto-mounted without any prompts.\n\n\nI guess I would go with Harv's suggestion. Remove all keychain entries dealing with that volume. Maybe, for good measure, change the password used to access the volume so that you know it's different from anything that might be in keychain. Try again and see if your results are different.\nGood luck.\n\nA: There is an update from Apple. \n\nWhen connecting to a server that requires a user name and password,\n  macOS Sierra 10.12 or later asks you to click Connect, even when the\n  name and password have been saved in your keychain.

My friend has a 17“ Macbook Pro, I think a 2010 model. \nIt has had massive problems for a while: trivial finder operations that typically take fractions of a second (like opening a new window or changing a directory) would take minutes to complete; apps would randomly hang for a half hour.\nThere was clearly something amiss and I was going to save her data, wipe the drive and install a new OS. However, in the meantime my friend installed an OS X update (not Sierra, but a regular package with minor updates). \nInstalling the update froze the computer for three days. The progress bar would move a little bit during the first day, then nothing. Once it was clear nothing was going to happen, we turned it off. Now, unsurprisingly, it won’t boot: you can see the apple and the OS’s progress bar; once that is loaded, the machine will reset.\nI’d like to download Sierra and install it right away, but there’s important data on the drive, including an iTunes library that hasn’t been backed up in a long while. So it’s pretty important to try and build on the system’s old state.\nIs there a chance the Sierra installer can fix the old system and do the upgrade, or do I need to find/download a DVD with the original system, and do a repair install first?\n\nA: While your friend's MacBook Pro is compatible with macOS Sierra (MBP Mid-2010 or newer) I suggest to fix the issue first.\nIt sounds as if the HDD is corrupted. Try replacing the HDD or to boot from an external HDD (USB or FireWire).\nMake sure everything runs smoothly before upgrading to a major version of OS X / macOS.\n", "Q: iPhone 5 show iOS old iOS (9.3.5) as available update not the latest iOS (10.0) My iPhone 5S shows iOS 10.0 in available update but for iPhone 5 it shows different.

On that hard drive there were some files that I wanted to delete, as per usual I moved them to the Trash. Now that they're in there they can't be deleted because due a to a message saying that the \"folder is currently still in use\". I located the folder to be on my newly added hard drive in its /.Trashes/ folder. I accessed this directory through the terminal and executed the command \"sudo rm -rf /.Trashes/\", however upon execution the message \"No such file or directory\" is noted after each of the folders within. I keep reading that this problem is something to do with 32 bit and 64 bit architecture confusion but if I'm honest I don't really understand what this means. \nThere is no option to reinstate the folder in the Trash (\"Put back\") and I can't forcefully remove the folder on my new hard drive that is stopping it from being in use. I've also accessed my /.Trash/ folder on my OS hard drive and done the same command (\"sudo rm -rf /.Trash/\") with no such luck.\nDoes anyone have any idea how I can go about deleting these files so they're removed from my trash and new hard drive?\n\nA: Removing a .Trashes directory or a .Trash directory is the wrong approach. You want to just remove the files and directories within your .Trashes or .Trash directory. Assuming your shell is bash you can list those file system objects in your .Trashes directory with find. In this example the secondary hard drive is named backup.\nfind /Volumes/backup/.Trashes/\"$UID\" ! -name \"$UID\"\n\nIf the results are the files you wish to delete then you can add -delete to the find statement. Please be very careful applying this option.\nfind /Volumes/backup/.Trashes/\"$UID\" ! -name \"$UID\" -delete\n\nFor files in your home folder's .Trash directory\nfind ~/.Trash ! -name .Trash -delete\n\n", "Q: Screenshots getting piled up in the folder on Sierra When using Yosemite and El Capitan, I set up a folder where screenshots are sent by default. Once screenshots were taken, they'd be added to the bottom of the folder, all in a grid and such.\nEver since I upgraded to Sierra, however, the screenshots, even though sent to the right folder, are put in some random position in it. As a result, they get piled up on top of other screenshots that were already there. Is there anyway of fixing this? What could be causing it?\n\nI realized this is happening on all of my folders, not just the screenshots one.

After upgrading to macOS Sierra yesterday, I notice that the system keyboard shortcut to shut down the computer no longer works.\nAs documented here, before the upgrade you could shut down the computer using Control–Option–Command–(Power button or Media Eject).\nAfter the upgrade, the system seems to ignore the \"Control–Option–Command\" combo and merely sleep the display as if I had tapped the Power button alone.\nDo you know of any documentation on how to restore the old shortcut?\n\nA: Ctrl + Cmd + Opt + Power/Eject still works in macOS Sierra. I just tested it with an upgraded install (El Capitan to Sierra) on an MBP Mid-2014. Please see if another keyboard shortcuts overrides the shutdown command:\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts\nAfter upgrading to macOS Sierra my keyboard shortcut for Spotlight (CMD + Space) was changed to Ctrl + Space.

This shortcut seems to work now: Control + Power will bring up the window for shutting down. \nFound here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236\n\nA: According to Apple Support, there are two shortcuts for shutdown:\n\nControl–Option–Command–Power button or \n  Control–Option–Command–Media Eject \n\nI tried the power-button shortcut on my MacBook Pro Mid 2012 with macOS Sierra 10.12.4 and it worked similar to the old eject-button shortcut (maybe a little slower, but that could be the new OS). I assume Apple added the additional shortcut for newer devices that don't have optical drives and eject buttons, but they neglected to maintain the eject-button shortcut for the older machines within the Sierra update. Just more infinite wisdom from Apple.\nUPDATE: I found that the standard Control–Option–Command–Media Eject does indeed work with Sierra. It seems that, at least on my machine, the key remapping program Karabiner and the Sierra-compatible version Karabiner Elements causes the Eject button to not register at all. When I disable Karabiner, the shutdown shortcut works normally. I did, however, find that Karabiner Elements does allow another key to be remapped as Eject. This won't work well on the limited internal keyboard, but for the external wired keyboard I set up one of the useless function keys (F19) as the Eject button. Now, Control–Option–Command–F19 works with the external keyboard and shuts down the computer.\n\nA: Work around:  system Preferences> Shortcuts > Move Focus To The Menu bar (which is CTRL F2)  Turn that on, and use it to navigate to the Apple Icon, then use your Down Key to Navigate to Shut Down, or Restart or whatever...\n\nA: You can press \n\n\"Ctrl + Fn + F1\"\n\nand the window will pop up with options to \n\n\"Restart, Sleep, Cancel, Shutdown\"\n\nDo selection using \n\n\"Ctrl + Tab\" and press \"Enter\"\n\n\n\nA: Also with fn + power.

I would like to be able to record on my calendar a quick symbol to indicate that I exercised that day.  Is that possible?\n\nA: There are several possibilities to add symbols to iCal/Calendar.app:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Emojis. Emojis are Unicode characters and will be displayed without special software. Use Cmd + Ctrl + Space to insert emojis or any other special character.\n\n*Use the find function. Use a unique name for your event (\"Exercise\"), go to month view (Cmd + 3) and search for your event (Cmd + F)\n\n*Use a separate calendar to hide your other calendar temporarily. You will only see your exercise events.\n\n\nYou cannot add graphics to a events' title so it stands out easily.

You need to specify the location of ffmpeg.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Terminal, run:\nwhich ffmpeg\n\n\n*Replace the ‘ffmpeg’ in your Automator shell script with the output of this command.\n", "Q: Spotlight borked after macOS Sierra update Config: Late-2013 rMBP running 10.12 (16A323)\nIssue: Spotlight appears to be mostly non-functional since upgrading to Sierra. I originally noticed it when searches failed to bring up anything in Mail, and Spotlight itself will only surface results from Dictionary.\nWhat I've Tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add my primary HDD to the Privacy exclusion list in Spotlight preferences (this resulted in a weird (null) error). The idea is adding, then removing will force a reindex.\n\n*Run mdutil -sv / to find out what's up, resulting in \"Error: unexpected indexing state. kMDConfigSearchLevelTransitioning\".\n\n*Run sudo mdutil -E / to delete and rebuild the index, resulting in \"Error: Index is already changing state.

Actually indexing, despite both known ways of confirmation indicating it isn't? And, if so, citation(s) on that being the case / when can I expect it to be showing that it is indexing?\nB. Actually borked? And, if so, any other ways I can try to resolve absent nuking the partition, doing a fresh install, and restoring from Time Machine?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: After leaving my Mac alone for the weekend, my fears were confirmed and there was never any change to this Spotlight issue. Given the other threads here and elsewhere, it appears that Sierra has some challenges when doing an in-place upgrade. \nResolution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Confirm you are fully backed up (multiple backups preferred). THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP!\n\n*Reboot into Recovery Mode (hold down Command-R while Mac begins to boot).\n\n*Open \"Disk Utility\" and erase the macOS partition (You did confirm those backup(s), right?).\n\n*Once HD is erased, exit out of \"Disk Utility\", open \"Install macOS Sierra\" and install Sierra from scratch. \n\n*After install completes, restore from backup. \n\n*Get back to your life. ;-)\n\n\nA: Did you reboot after #4 above? I think that should work... If not this may help:\nsudo touch /.metadata-never-index\n\nReboot...\nsudo rm /.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist\nsudo rm /.metadata-never-index\n\nAnd reboot again.

One thing I noticed is that the office software that had previously showed up in the dock wasn't installed. When I look up Pages on the Appstore it shows a 20€ price tag. How can that be?\n\nA: If it was associated with your Apple ID before the OS X reinstallation the reason is that you are haven't logged into the Mac App Store with your Apple ID.\nGo to 'Store > Sign In…' and enter your Apple ID credentials.

Was bought in the Apple Store and activated by me with my Apple ID a few years ago.\nToday, on 10:00 pm, when I was riding a subway train, connected to its free wi-fi, black screen with white apple appeared suddenly, when I was browsing, as if it was rebooting. It glitches like that sometimes, very rare and not very long (unlike the real reboot). But this time after the logo there was something different - on the lock screen in the notification area, there was the text \"Activation required\" with an icon of a circled exclamation point.\nAfter swiping the screen, the system said that this iPhone is linked to the Apple ID, and offered me to enter my Apple ID and password, the ones that \"were used to set up this iPhone\". It also was showing my email with some hidden symbols. The screen was titled \"Activation lock\". It looked similar to this, but with my email dotted: https://phoneunlockingshopca.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/official-bypass-icloud-activation-lock-remove-icloud-account.png\nI successfully logged in, and then there was an iMessage alert: \"Your carrier may charge for SMS messages used to activate iMessage\", as if it was the first setup. But all my data remained in place.\nThen I went to https://www.icloud.com/activationlock/ and it said that my activation lock was on. And didn't say how exactly to turn it off. How to bring it back to normal?\nWhen I google about the activation lock, everything seems to be about \"previous owners\" cases. But there were no previous owners, and I am able to unlock my phone for now. And no cases like mine in the search results.\nI'm interested, what could have triggered it? What data could have been compromised? I remind you that there were no messages about lost mode or erased iPhone, no scammer messages asking for money for the unlock, nothing like that. But still, it's pretty creepy. My email's and Apple ID's passwords are different and pretty secure, I have 2-factor auth on them too. Also, when Pokemon Go came out, I created second Apple ID to download, but surely didn't log in back to that account for weeks, just used my main one as always. And never had any other Apple IDs on my iPhone.\nWhat a person should do to trigger what I experienced today? What data did he need to know? And can a free wi-fi network be a factor? And what about the time, as if it was scheduled? Or was it an iPhone glitch without any third party involved?\nWhat can I do to secure my phone and accounts besides changing passwords?\n\nA: Activation lock being on is a good thing; it means that your device cannot be activated on a different account or carrier until it's disabled, usually at the time you sell or otherwise dispose of your device.\nI'm not sure what would cause it to randomly pop up like it did - the first (and really only) thing that comes to mind is your carrier making some adjustments on their end that caused your phone to need to be reactivated, but as you saw, no data is lost during this type of activation. It's also possible that something was corrupted on the device that required reactivation with the carrier to resolve. You would also see this screen if you put in a new SIM card.\nYou should change your password for your Apple ID to be on the safe side, but it's unlikely that any third-party, aside from your carrier, was involved in this incident.\n", "Q: Hide Location Menubar icon I updated my Mac to macOS Sierra yesterday, and now the location icon (which shows that an app is using location services) is almost always present in the menubar. The app using location is Siri and Dictation (not using dictation so it's definitely Siri's fault). Short of disabling Siri or blocking it from using my location, how can I get that location icon to get off my menubar?\nEdit: Now Weather, Calendar, and Siri are all using my location constantly.\n\nA: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy. Under Location Services, scroll to the bottom of the list and click the Details button next to System Services.

I need to insure 18 MacBook Pro 15 retinas and 18 MacBook Pro 13 retinas for a school making a large purchase where the students are permitted to take the laptops home for homework. Does an insurance policy exist that will cover this? Both en masse or individual policies will work since parents will need to pay for their share of the policies. However, since parents are paying, the policy premium needs to make sense.\n\nA: One of the companies I used in the past and still recommend today is Safeware.\nThey have solutions specifically for edu customers covering both in house staff and the student population at large.  Their claim service is pretty good - having done quite a few myself.  \n\nA: Four years ago our kids' school issued over 900 iPads. All students were provided with a compulsory protective case and the iPads went to/from home each day, and all students were allowed to have them at home during school holiday periods. \nThe school had a policy which covered the iPads for broken screens. The policy covered the first time a student broke the screen, and for each subsequent break the parents had to contribute half of the cost of repair (or opt to arrange their own repair at their own cost). \nThis year they issued Surface Tablets to the senior high school students (about 350) to replace their iPads. These are also covered by insurance.\nObviously with 36 MacBooks your coverage will be different, and the economies of scale aren't comparable, but the point is that you'd be able to get some sort of coverage.\n\nA: Yes, you can get devices insured in bulk. Although most companies will have you sign up within 30 days of purchasing the devices - but there may be a policy within your school for property damage. \nAlternatively, you could use a third party warranty/insurance company such as Protection\nDisclaimer: I work at Protection.

The only way to get ⌘-click to open in a new tab is to actually hold the key down while clicking (which defeats the purpose of sticky keys).\nIs there a way to restore the old behavior?\n\nA: I haven't found a way how to restore the old behavior however there appears to be a new (probably inconsistent) system:\nFor example, if you press command it is used only for one click (somehow not in browsers). A second press on command locks it and now it works in browsers too. The third press on command unlocks it and you are in the same situation as before.\n\nA: I have the same problem.

The campus I work for (I'm a student, not faculty or staff) is having issues with iOS 10 (for sure, haven't been able to get a single device running iOS 10 to work, even though 9.x.x worked just fine.  It instantly says \"Unable to join network\" every time you tap the network name) and allegedly Mac OS Sierra not connecting to their 802.1x WPA2 Enterprise network.  In doing some troubleshooting in my own personal time, I discovered that their certificate is self-signed.  Could this be contributing to the issue?\n\nA: Found out the issue was indeed the RADIUS certificate, as Apple deprecated the SSLv3 cryptographic protocol and the RC4 symmetric cipher suite in iOS 10 and macOS Sierra.\nMore Info Here\n\nA: FYI SSLv3 and RC4 are related to transport, not certificate signing.  So the issue probably is more related to building the EAP tunnel to the RADIUS server or processing authentication, not the certificate verification.\nIt's common to see self-signed certificates in these deployments because the CA requirements vary among different clients, so it's considered easier to just use a certificate that will essentially never expire\n", "Q: Notes Application not able to open after upgrading to MacOs Sierra I have Macbook Pro 15\" Retina display.

I started to have troubles with really high CPU usage when I replaced my battery. I didn't buy an original Apple one and from the first boot I had issues with the kernel_task process. I managed to solve this on Yosemite by moving the plist file for my Mac model following this tutorial: How to fix kernel_task CPU usage on Yosemite worked perfectly! \nAnybody knows a way to do this or where to find this file on Sierra? I can't find a IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext dir\n\nA: The path: /System/Library/Extensions/IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin.kext/Contents/Resources\" is still existing and it indeed contains a lot of plists with Mac identifier names (e.g. MacBookPro8_1.plist). The whole path starting with /System is protected by SIP though. To modify (i.e. move) files here you have to disable SIP.\n\nI strongly recommend to leave the plist where it is and search for the real culprit. In your linked example it's not really the kernel_task but the AirMail process which bogs the CPU. One solution is then to disable/modify Airmail. \nSince you didn't add an Activity Monitor screenshot I don't know the real reason why your CPU is forced to its knees.\n\nA: For me it worked excluding the internal os x discs from spotlight.\nI have a partition with os x & one with data, it worked to exclude these drives within the prefs of spotlight (privacy tab).\n", "Q: Rebooting machine with macOS Sierra takes very long time Since I upgraded my Retina MacBook Pro with macOS Sierra GM (16A319), rebooting the computer takes 20-30 minutes. I select Restart... from the apple menu, everything logs out, then the Mac hangs on a black screen for the rest of the time. I even have a mouse cursor. After a while it reboots normally, and booting takes 10-15 seconds as usual. If I force shut down, I can boot normally (except for the warning, that the computer was not shutted down properly).\nI've tried selecting Boot disk in System preferences, change the boot disk from terminal, but it seems the problems is with the shut down operation.\nI have only TripMode's kernel extension beside Apple's own modules.\n\nA: Ok, I've found the solution: mysqld is the problem, version 5.7.13 can't be stopped (even from Activity Monitor or with kill), so macOS waits for it to stop until a very long interval.\nSolution: Untick automatic startup in MySQL preference pane, reboot once slowly, then the second reboot will be fine.\n\nA: I had the same issue and it seems to be fixed when upgrading to MySQL 5.7.15\nCheers\n\nA: It seems it's mysql is keeping it in the loop during the reboot.\nYou'd need to check your build of mysql from terminal, you will see something alike that from MacOS Sierra:\n$ mysql --version\nmysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.9, for osx10.9 (x86_64) using  EditLine wrapper\n\nYou'll notice, that you having an old build, which needs to be updated.

At any rate, it is causing a small utility I made some years ago to throw a rather annoying error.\nAs I haven't yet had the time to dig into the under-the-hood changes in Sierra, I'm not sure how to fix the error. Does anyone have experience dealing with errors relating to AppTranslocation and fixing them?\nCode and error follow:\nCode:\ntell application \"Finder\"\nset currentDir to POSIX path of ((container of (path to me)) as text)\nend tell\nset currentDir to quoted form of currentDir\nset lib80211 to quoted form of \"AirPort Utility 5.6.1 Launcher.app/Contents/Resources/Apple80211.framework/Versions/A/Apple80211\"\n\ndo shell script \"export DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=\" & currentDir & lib80211 & \"\ncd \" & currentDir & \"AirPort\\\\ Utility\\\\ 5.6.1.app/Contents/MacOS\n./AirPort\\\\ Utility\"\n\nError:\nsh: line 1: cd: /private/var/folders/t4/7k5z832d2tjd4xpzvvq43n4m0000gn/T/AppTranslocation/23AF67A4-3DF7-4982-A1A3-B019CDACB4C2/dAirPort Utility 5.6.1.app/Contents/MacOS: No such file or directory\nsh: line 2: ./AirPort Utility: No such file or directory (127)\n\n\nA: Well, after a fairly significant amount of trial and error (and a bit of reading about how AppTranslocation works in macOS 10.12 Sierra), I've discovered a fix.\nIn essence, you have to open the *.dmg and then move the contents to some other folder in Finder. The catch: If you move both simultaneously, AppTranslocation may 'tag' them (seemingly permanently) and continue to run every time you try to launch either *.app); this seems like a bug, and I intend to report it to Apple.\nThe Solution\nRe-download the *.dmg (as others have stated) and move the two files it contains one at a time into a folder (preferably Utilities, but it's up to you where you want them to reside). Once you've done this, run the Launcher and everything should work as before.\n\nA: Another solution would be to execute a shell script that removes the quarantine flags after you've copied the files. The command would be like this:\n/usr/bin/xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/fileOrFolderOrApp\n\n\nA: The problem seems to be simpler than that—It looks like the update removed Airport Utility 5.6.1.app from under /Applications/Airport Utility 5.6.1.\nI copied the directory back in place from an old backup and things work again.\n\nA: It's working perfectly for me under macOS Sierra 10.12.

I've a lot of photos and videos taken on my iPhone. I'll usually copy the files of the photos/videos periodically from my iPhone to my PC. But this method of copying files manually is messy because the filenames of the image stored on iPhone sometimes can get confusing.\nI'm copying these files not for restoring them to my iPhone later, but to free up space.\nI'm not using the backup feature in iTunes for this because that backup is only an image of the phone and it doesn't let me view the photos.\nIs it possible, on a Windows 10 PC, that I can store, transfer and manage photos/videos from my iPhone to PC such that I can view the pictures/videos and recognise the albums in the Photo App on my iPhone? \nAlso, it will be great if there is a way to somehow organise and preview Live Photos!

I am overseas at the moment and I have bought a SIM which has plenty of data, but the plan doesn't include SMS. I have tried activating iMessage again as my phone number is different, but it is stuck on waiting for activation. When I turn on iMessage it comes up with \"Your carrier may charge for SMS messages used to activate iMessage.\"\nDoes this mean that iMessage uses SMS to activate? I have a little bit of credit for calls which I'm assuming if you send a text it uses a bit of it since the plan doesn't include SMS. \nIs there any other way I can activate iMessage?\n\n\nA: To activate iMessage for a phone number, the device sends a silent SMS with a verification code. Carriers approved by Apple do not charge for this SMS. Activating without sending an SMS only activates iMessage for your Apple ID email address, not your phone number.\n", "Q: Tab key not working properly in dialogue boxes in macOS I change the setting ‘Full Keyboard Access’ (the Keyboard settings in the ‘Keyboard Shortcuts’ tab) from ‘Text Boxes and Lists Only’ to ‘All controls’.

But I tried to disable it and it told me that local files will be deleted but kept on iCloud. This makes sense as it is the same logic as with the Photos.app. \nBut is there a way of keeping the local content and deleting the iCloud content of the Documents and Desktop folder? Essentially, how can I revert my enabling and have everything local again?\n\nA: You could hold down the option + click on the document folder and drag it to another directory (essentially copying it) and then disable sync, so it does not affect the files you just created. Do the same for the Desktop Folder.\nBest if you can copy to an external drive, to avoid any chances of losing the local files, until you resolve the unsync and deletion of said files.\n\nA: I had a bigger problem in that the documents in the iCloud folder were not current files but from 2 years previously. (In retrospect I realized this was because I updated Sierra on my laptop with older document files before updating the desktop with all my current files. I couldn't even locate my current documents. SOLUTION: I went in Time Machine back three (fortunately inactive) days before I installed Sierra, found my document files and \"restored.\" Then, in finder, created a new folder Entitled \"MYINITIALS-Docs\". Then when the restored files had downloaded into the \"Documents\" folder in iCloud, copied them to my new folder. No, not elegant but it worked. All my documents are on my desktop. Now I want to cancel and delete the iCloud storage of all my documents.  \n\nA: If you turn off icloud upload on finder in settings; icloud; icloud drive; finder, it will keep all your stuff in the icloud section in finder even if it hasn't uploaded completely or at all. You can just drag it back where you want and it will ask if you're sure you want to delete it from icloud (just say yes/ok) and then its all good.\n\nA: I have Time Machine backing up twice a day. Backed up files inside  TM will not sync or be synced. These are my local copies i could rely on if something happens.  Their life is short, the actual  version will soon be backed up.\n\nA: I've got the same situation. My solution:\nClose opened apps and open terminal (iTerm - I recommend) and there (first go to your home):\ncd\nmkdir Desktop.mvd Documents.mvd\nmv Documents/* Documents.mvd/ && mv Desktop/* Desktop.mvd/\n\nThen turn back off Desktop & Documents Folder option from iCloud Preferences. If you will see empty Desktop and Documents folders on iCloud drive in Finder - you can simply remove them. Check that you have locally Desktop and Documents folders in Finder (not under iCloud)\nNext you can go back to terminal and move your files back:\nmv Documents.mvd/* Documents/ && mv Desktop.mvd/* Desktop/\n\nThat's all\n", "Q: My USB Apple Keyboard stopped working after upgrading to Sierra I have an iMac (late 2015), which I use with a wired USB Apple keyboard.

My WiFi can see 12 networks belonging to neighbours, locked and password protected, some with silly names. Network/Wi-Fi/Advanced allows me to remove names from the list, but only for networks I have joined. How can I remove the others? \n\nA: Network > Wi-Fi > Advanced allows you to remove preferred networks. Preferred means that they are recognized (i.e. previously-connected-to) networks and you can set a priority order should multiple networks be available simultaneously. These networks will still appear in the list of available networks when they are nearby after removal from Preferred.\nThere is no way to remove network SSIDs from the list of currently-available networks.\n\nA: You cannot remove someone else's network, unless you can convince them to turn off their hardware or hide their SSID.\nOne option is to get creative writing an applescript to hide all networks if your preferred network is available.\n", "Q: How do I disable/configure macOS Sierra's auto throttling of the CPU for processor intensive tasks I'm using an iMac (late 2015) with an Intel core i7 (quad core) 4GHz CPU with 32GB ram and a 3TB Fusion Drive. I'm a software developer working on a huge codebase that used to take about 30 minutes to build and run unit tests on my beast of a machine. Of course, running the build meant that the CPU usage was up through the roof and the fan working at its fastest speed.\nI upgraded to macOS sierra yesterday, and my first attempt to build the project I'm working on took three and a half hours! During this time my computer and fan were as quiet as a sleeping baby.\nI did some investigation and found that whenever a process uses too much CPU power to the extent of making the fans audible, in just a couple of seconds I see the CPU usage of this process falling down, and after a few minutes, the fan sound goes down too. It seems that in Sierra a feature was added to make sure that the CPU doesn't overheat by throttling the processor usage for high CPU demand processes automatically.\nWhat I need to know is how to disable/configure this feature, because it's killing my productivity. I really love the other great features in Sierra, but I would certainly downgrade if there is no way to disable this auto-throttling.\n\nA: Here are a few broad steps from a post on \"Disable OS X kernel_task throttling\" which you will need to try since I don't have an iMac on hand.

I had to recently completely wipe my computer and reinstall everything.  I just imported my photos from an external hard drive and that worked fine but the only issue is when i go into Photos, all of my pics are out of order.  \nSurprisingly can't find any way to sort by date of image (versus date imported which would be the same for all images). Am I missing something?  \nHow can there not be a \"sort by date\" option for images in an album?\n\nA: The Photos Timeline view is sorted by the date embedded in the photo, not by date added. All other views are also sorted by the date of the photo except the All Photos album, which is date added. You can't change the sort view of any of the application created albums.\nThe last import view shows only the last import, and does not include photos from PhotoStream.\nWork around: you can create a smart album and it gives a variety of ways to sort the photos in the new smart album (date range, title, keyword, etc)\n", "Q: How can I pause the download on Mac App Store and then resume it later? I am downloading macOS Sierra from Mac App Store. But I have electricity problem here. Due to which my iMac will lose power after 2 hours. Now I want to pause the downloading so that I can resume the download later on.

When you buy an app at the App Store you will simply see \"installing\" under the app's icon. If you go to Launchpad you will see the app with a thermometer chart showing the progress of download. If you click on it you can pause it, and the word \"Paused\" will appear. But clicking it again does not seem to resume the download. Instead go back to the App Store, click on the purchased menu item. There you will see the app and a thermometer chart showing the paused download. If you click that you will resume the download.

After upgrading to macOS Sierra the sleep keyboard shortcut doesn't work anymore. How do I re-enable it?\n[Edit] I was using (cmd+opt+eject) before, apparently it's (ctrl+shift+eject) after the upgrade. Others might have different experiences, but the shortcuts have definitely been reset.\n\nA: Things definitely have changed:\n⌥⌘⏏ (Cmd-Option-Eject) to put your machine to sleep no longer works in Sierra.\nSupposedly, ⌃⏏ (Ctrl-Eject) has taken its place, but it doesn't work on my late-2012 iMac.\nAt least according to the documentation, that is the only change - compare below.\nSadly, you cannot bring the old shortcut back (at all?), because defining keyboard shortcuts in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts doesn't allow you define shortcuts involving ⏏ (Eject), and, in fact, even shortcuts that are permissible do not seem to put the machine to sleep (flickers briefly, but stays awake).\nSleep-related shortcuts as of macOS Sierra:\nSource: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236\n\nSleep-related shortcuts as of OS X El Capitan:\nSource (link effectively dead, redirects to the Sierra page): http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1343\n\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge there are only three macOS keyboard shortcuts that have any sort of sleep functionality. These are as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power button - Hold for 1.5 seconds while your Mac is awake to display a dialog asking if you want to restart, sleep, or shut down. \n\n*ControlShiftEject - Puts your display to sleep.\n\n*ControlShiftPower button - As above, this puts your display to sleep.\n\n\nIt seems to me that the second keyboard shortcut is the one closest to what you're describing - instead of CommandOptionEject it's ControlShiftEject.\nIs this what you're after? Or had you in fact been using CommandOptionEject previously?\nYou can also check out the Mac keyboard shortcuts page for a more detailed description of macOS keyboard shortcuts.\n\nA: If you're looking for the same dialogue window that holding the power button used to preset, you can access it by using the fn+Power  combination. No need to hold anything down. I'm not sure if this is a change in macOS Sierra, but I just found the combination this morning by accident. Hope it helps!\n\nA: I also had the problem that the sleep shortcut would not work anymore after macOS sierra (Using Control+Shift+Eject).\nIt looks like one have to press the buttons for a longer time to trigger sleep (About 1,5 seconds). \nOn El Capitan sleep was activated immediately.\n", "Q: Using a Magic Trackpad 2 upside down The Magic Trackpad 2 seems nice... except it's upside down.

I just installed macOS Sierra and when I log into the Recovery mode, I do not have the Utilities menu in it. Only the 4 options, Restore From Time Machine Backup, Reinstall macOS, Get Online Help and Disk Utility. \nHow can I access Terminal from OS Recovery?\n\nA: After battling this problem for hours I just found a great, reliable solution!\nIf you reboot holding Command-R-S then you can get into an undocumented combined recovery mode and single user mode, this will go directly to the command prompt without the graphical interface but you will be in recovery mode and can enter the csrutil disable command successfully.\nI did this by triggering the reboot from the device selector dialogue in the regular recovery mode on Sierra on a Macbook 2010 but it probably works via other methods.\nSo happy to have found a reliable workaround for this at last, hope it will benefit others.\n\nA: Clearly too late for you now but it seems that with Sierra, in order to get the recovery programme opening fully (properly) \"Command-R\" needs to be held down during the full length of the booting process. Only then do you seem to get the full menu bar appearing as normal.\n\nA: This is a bug in the recovery Mode, also the same issue if you create a USB Device for install. Try to load Recovery Mode again and choose one the the four available options that should get the menu back.\nI've tried boot from USB Device three times until the menu was visible.\n\nA: You need to click the Utilities menu, as shown in the image below, then click Terminal.\nIf you do not have the Menu bar showing then you can either try rebooting to see if that makes any difference or just click, e.g. Disk Utility and then close it to see if it will bring the  macOS Utilities Menu bar up. (As noted by dante12)\nOtherwise try holding down Option-Command-R to start up from OS X Internet Recovery to access Terminal from there.\n\n\nA: The usual recovery mode/installer task bar has several menus. Terminal is usually reached from the Utilities menu.\nUpon boot, the task bar that is first presented is that shown with the \"language chooser\" dialogue, which just has a language chooser menu.\nOnce the language has been chosen, the task bar should change to the usual menu, but instead the \"language chooser\" task bar remains.\nIn order to get the correct task bar to appear, moving the cursor around at the top of the screen (making the task bar appear and hide repeatedly) will quite quickly (only took me a few seconds) result in the correct task bar appearing.\nYou should now be able to open Terminal from the Utilities menu.\n\nA: I too had this problem and it was super frustrating. I've had to deal with this deleting the .plist thing ever since I installed an aftermarket battery. It's really not that difficult, but when you have to disable the SIP it adds an extra annoying step. The worst thing of all was that, when using OS Sierra and booting in recovery mode, I couldn't see the terminal from the menu bar. I just had that stupid \"Language Chooser\". Making a USB book disk worked, but only after I restarted that way twice. The first time I still didn't see an option to access terminal. It's really annoying that it might or might not show up. It's like I'm blowing dust out of an NES cartrdige. Thanks for all the helpful info in this thread though. I can confirm after jumping through those stupid hoops I was able to get my computer working correctly again. All that for virtually no difference in the stupid OS. Either way, USB boot disk is that way to go in order to get to terminal from Recovery. \n\nA: I had the same problem. I tried to boot from USB install but it didn't work. Took me a day to figure this out but I solved the problem by putting back the original battery and booting from USB install. The terminal and all the recovery mode features reappeared. \n", "Q: Notes on MacOS Sierra I just upgraded to MacOS Sierra and I lost a week-long of notes in Notes. It happened, after I restored a backup from a week ago and then installed Sierra. All my notes sync with iCloud, but there simply aren't any notes now from since last week. \nIs there any kind of way to recover those notes, because they are reaaaaaally important to me...\nThanks:)\n\nA: No.  They are gone.  iCloud, for a lack of a better word is a \"sync conduit\" between your devices; it's not a backup.    This means that a change you make on any of your devices is what gets synced.\nWhen you restored the 1 week old backup from Time Machine, more than likely, Notes did a sync which overwrote what was on iCloud because it \"assumed\" that was the latest data to be synced.  \nWhat you should do in the future....prior to upgrading your OS do a manual Time Machine backup so it saves the latest state. This way you know for a fact that what you restore is your most recent version.\n\nA: Restore a more recent TM backup, and your notes will be fine again !!\n", "Q: How can I make allow users with older versions of iOS to download an older version of my app I've updated my app and due to some of the functions I'm releasing it has to be for iOS 10 and up.  I understand that there is a way for users that have not upgraded to iOS 10 to be able to get the older version of my app but I haven't been able to figure out how to enable that in the app store.  I just tested on a device and currently if you have iOS 9 it will tell you that you can't get the app because it is only supported on iOS 10.  No option to download the previous version.\nAccording to the redit article below Apple enabled the behavior I want.  I just don't know how to turn it on for my app.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1mjw36/people_with_old_ios_devices_you_can_now_install/\n\nA: The feature has been around for a number of years. It's enabled for every app by default and an opt-out for developers per app version. You can remove an older app version from download through iTunes Connect → My Apps → app → App Store → Pricing & Availability → Last-Compatible Version Settings → Available Versions.\nThe key information as to why you are seeing the feature not working is mentioned in this page:\n\nSome of your customers may not have a device that's compatible with your latest app version. To allow them to continue using your app, we make the last-compatible version of your app available to them.\nIf one or more of your app versions have significant usability or legal issues, such as infringement, deselect it below. This isn't recommended for any other reason. Any version you deselect won't be available for redownload from iTunes in the Cloud. You can't deselect your current App Store version.\n\niTunes Connect Last-Compatible Version Settings, emphasis mine\nDownloading a previous version of an app requires the app be downloaded from iTunes in the Cloud, i.e. the app must be in the user's purchase history. This means it does not apply to new downloads, but rather re-downloads.\nFor a user to download an app which requires a later version of iOS, they must first either:\n\n*\n\n*purchase/get the app on a compatible device\n\n*purchase/get the app in iTunes\n\nThis adds the app to the user's purchase history and is now eligible for last-compatible version download through the feature popup as you mention.\nsample:\n\n\nA: Because you indicated in iTC that your app supports iOS 10 at a minimum, users will only be able to download that version from the App Store.\nYou will need to change your app to support earlier iOS versions in order for users to have access to the previous version.  By making the app decisions you did, users not on iOS 10 will not be able to use your latest update.  \nUsers on earlier iOS versions must prevent your app from being updated from the current version on their iDevice in order to keep that version working.\n", "Q: Updating Keychain entry manually prevents next access from GUI tools afterwards: Always asks for permission I stumbled upon this using Tunnelblick and Viscosity. Adding a configuration to those VPN tools it is possible in the GUI during the first connect to specify user&pass and save them in the keychain. The next connections will then use the saved credentials from keychain.\nHowever if I change the password in the keychain using the security terminal command (add-generic-password -U-s-a-w) or via keychain access application, afterwards both Tunnelblick and Viscosity will show the \"Permission to access keychain: [Allow, Allow always, cancel]\"-dialog if I try connecting the next time. \nIs there any way to prevent this dialog? \n\n\n*\n\n*I looked a bit in the Tunnelblick source code, but couldn't find a check for \"keychain tampering\" or anything that could force this dialog from Tunnelblick's side.\n\n*If it is an configurable OS level protection?\n\n\nA: For macOS Sierra:\nTo add an object and allow access (with user prompt), use the \"-T Application\" option. (Several applications can be used)\nsecurity add-generic-password -a \"account\" -s \"name\" -w 'password' -c aapl -T /Applications/Utilities/Keychain\\ Access.app/Contents/MacOS/Keychain\\ Access\n\nThen to allow access without user prompt you need to modify the ACL for the object:\nsecurity -v set-generic-password-partition-list -s \"name\" -S \"apple:\"\n\nThe partition-list syntax is not very well documented. You might be able to see how Tunnelblick uses the ACL from the output of \"security dump-keychain\".\nSource: man security\n", "Q: Change album's main picture in Photos I have an iPhone 6s with iOS 10.  In the Photos app, there are Albums and each Album has a cover photo.  \nHow can I change the cover photo of an Album?\n\nA: I don’t beleive there is any way to choose the key photo directly on the iPhone. There also isn't a way to perform this selection on Photos web app at https://icloud.com\nIf you are using iCloud photo library and have a Mac, the Photos app on your computer show the same albums as your phone.  Open the album your interested in changing the cover photo for, right-click (or control-click) the photo you want to use and select ‘make key photo’.  Once the changes sync up to the cloud, this change should be reflected on the phone when it syncs down those changes.\nAlso complicating things on iOS, there are two kinds of albums, those created by iOS itself (Selfies, Panoramas, etc), and then there are those albums you create yourself.\nIn those albums created by iOS, the most recent picture will be the so-called cover photo.  \nWith an album you create, the cover photo will be the first picture in the album.  \n\nA: On my iPhone, I can drag the photos around to rearrange their order. Following the advice from above:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Open the album you wish to change the cover of (this method only works for albums you created yourself, does not work for default ones like Selfies)\n\n*Tap select at the top right corner\n\n*Perform a long tap (tap and hold) on the photo you wish to make your cover photo\n\n*Then if you drag your favorite photo so that it is first in the list, it will be used as that album's cover photo\n\n\nA: I finally stumbled on the solution!  The photo you want highlighted needs to be in the first position in the album. Here is how to move a photo:\nClick on the album, hit select in upper right corner. Once there select the photo and drag it to the first photo in the album. Make sure not to 'tap' the photo, but hold your finger on the photo and drag to the first position and bit done.   \n\nA: Tap the person in the People album.\nTap Select.\nTap Show Faces to focus on just the person’s face in each photo.\nTap the photo that you want to use.\nTap the Share Extension, then > Set Key Face.\n\nA: On your iPhone or iPad, click open an album you've created (won't work on albums iOS creates). Click Select in the upper right corner. Hold down the picture you want as your cover photo, until it \"moves\" or gets slightly bigger. Then slide it to the upper left position (first picture). Click Done and it's saved as the cover picture.\n\nA: \nOpen the album your interested in changing the cover photo for,\n  r-click the photo you want to use and select ‘make key photo’. This\n  change should be reflected on the phone.\n\nDoesn't work. Also, I could have sworn that there was a \"Make Key Photo\" option in the share menu in the iOS version of Photos during the beta...\nEdit: Never mind. The updated \"key photo\" selected on macOS EVENTUALLY appeared on the iOS version, two days later.\n\nA: iOS Photos: Change Album thumbnail/key photo\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Photos app\n\n*Open the album that you want to change its album thumbnail\n\n*Choose the photo you want to become the album thumbnail\n\n*Choose \"add\"\n\n*Choose \"new album\". \n\n*Name the new album\n\n*Now a new album is created containing only the selected photo\n\n*and you are returned automatically to the album you opened in step 2\n\n*Now select all photos from that album by tapping \"select all\"\n\n*Tap \"add\"\n\n*Select the album that was created in step 5-7\n\n*Delete the original album\n\n\nA: Couldn’t get success from any of the methods I saw here so on Mac I copied the photo I wanted as the cover and pasted in at the end of the album. Now I have a double of that that pic but it worked! Cover has changed when I view it from iOS or from Mac.\n\nA: In the places album take a selfie. It automatically makes it the photo displayed on the places folder.  Of course, any other selfie will replace it when taken\n\nA: Finding the way to do this on my iPad has been driving me nuts for years! Today I finally found the answer. Here's the key: The album icon will be the first photo you PUT IN the album. It will not work if you simply move an image to the first position. So, if you have 100 photos in an album:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add all of them to a bogus album you keep handy for this purpose.\n\n*Remove all of the photos from the actual album.\n\n*From the Bogus album, add the desired icon photo to the actual album.\n\n*Finally, add the rest of the photos to the actual album.\n\n*Remove photos from the bogus album so it's empty for the next time you have to do this.\n\n\nNote: I'm using an iPad Pro with the latest iOS\n\nA: Much much easier way guys.  \nINCLUDES THE IPHONE GENERATED ALBUMS \nOpen say the main all photos album. As you know the most recent photo is the cover. Go find any photo you want as the cover.  \nClick select\nClick the box with arrow out the top bottom left of screen \nClick duplicate \nThis creates a new copy of that photo which is now the most recent one.  You can choose to delete the original or have both.  I mean it’s one picture.  \nDown side. Yes the most recent will replace this.  But this isn’t really an issue unless you most recent pic happens to be something R Rated or worse !!\n", "Q: RMBP unable shut down after upgrading to macOS 10.12 Sierra (16A323) After updating to macOS 10.12, it cannot shut down (tried multiple times).

I figured I'd just restore it to factory default, provision it with our blueprint, get it on our MDM and be done with it, however, at some point in the restore process, Apple Configurator throws this unuseful error, and the device is stuck with a tiny bit of progress on the iOS installation screen.\n\nI was able to find a second device that (presumably) ran into the same problem, and when unplugged from the Apple Configurator, I get the iTunes connect a cable a screen.  Even the power button seems to no longer work, and attempts to reimage these devices don't get any further than where they're currently stuck.\n\nAnyone run into this before, or have any suggestions on what to do, now that we seem to be creating iBricks?\n\nA: I came here looking for a solution to this very problem. Fwiw, I find that I can un-brick the iPad by closing AC2 and restoring it in iTunes. Unfortunately, that does not supervise the device.\n\nA: As pointed out in nitronblue's answer, the iPad can be \"unbricked\" by doing a firmware restore through iTunes.  The devices seem to have gotten stuck in DFU mode, and iTunes was the easiest way (by far) to get them bootable again.\nAs far as fixing the issue, the Mac Mini I was running Configurator from had a macOS Server update (v5.2) available that was released on September 20th.  Applying the update and rebooting has allowed me to successfully provision iPads again.\n", "Q: Is there a way to delete the last 3 backups from Time Machine? I just updated to Sierra. As I am having problems to setup my Exchange email I want to reinstall El Capitan and use the Time Machine to get all the systems back. \nI already used my Time machine to backup 3 days of to Sierra.\n\nA: To answer your direct question, yes, you can delete backups by going into Time Machine, clicking on the backup in question (on the right-hand column), then right-clicking on your computer's name in the sidebar in the Finder window and choosing Delete Backup.\nYou should be able to downgrade without deleting backups, though. In order to do so, you'll need to do a few things.\nFirst, disconnect your Time Machine drive so nothing happens to it during the following process.\nNext, if you have any critical files that were created since you installed Sierra, copy them to another drive or a cloud service like Dropbox.\nAt this point you'll need to create a bootable USB flash drive with the El Capitan installer on it.\nDownload the El Capitan installer from the Mac App Store again. When's it done downloading it will try to run, and that will cause an error that it can't be run - don't worry about it. Just move to the next step.\nFormat the USB flash drive as HFS+ and name it whatever you like, but don't include spaces - the example used here is ElCapInstaller. If you change the name of your drive, change that name where it appears in the below command.\nOnce you have your USB flash drive ready, create the installer by opening Terminal and copying and pasting the following command:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/ElCapInstaller --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app --nointeraction\n\n(Again, replace ElCapInstaller with the name of your USB flash drive if you changed it.) This may take up to 30 minutes or more but it will tell you in Terminal once it's complete by showing \"Copy Complete\" and then \"Done\". Wait for \"Done\".\nReboot your computer with the flash drive still attached and hold Option as it's starting up. You will be shown options for startup disks. Select the flash drive you previously created by double-clicking on it.\nAt this point you want to reinstall El Capitan by erasing your hard drive. Otherwise you won't be able to proceed. Remember, you have a Time Machine backup in case anything goes wrong.\nAn OS X Utilities window will appear. Select Disk Utility and click Continue.\nOnce it launches, select the Mac’s hard drive in the left column. Click the Erase tab, and in the windows that appears, name your hard drive and select one of the OS X Extended formats, then click the Erase button to wipe out everything on the hard drive.\nOnce Disk Utility is done reformatting, quit the app. This will take you back to the OS X Utilities window.\nSelect Install OS X, click Continue, and proceed through the installation process.\nOnce the installation is complete and you're at the desktop, re-connect your Time Machine drive and run Utilities/Migration Assistant in your Applications. This will walk you through the procedure of restoring your files from your Time Machine backup. Obviously you will need to select one from before you upgraded to Sierra.\n", "Q: Calculator Paper Tape window not capturing any information I am able to bring up the Paper Tape window, but no calculator entries end up on it.

In macOS Sierra, the window edges are sticky and grab the edges of the display, the top of the Dock and the bottom of the menu bar when being moved around.\nThis is very useful most of the time, but sometimes I would like to disable it. Whilst it is possible to move the window away from the edge and move it back again which seems to override the sticky edge functionality, I'd like something to prevent the initial grab in the first place.\nIs there a way to disable macOS Sierra's sticky window edges?\n\nA: There are a few ways to override the sticky edge:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move the window faster. There is a speed threshold after which the sticky effect won't take place.\n\n*After the edge sticks, simply keep moving in the same direction. The window will unstick. No need to move back and then forward again.\n\n*As mentioned in the question, move back and forth.\n\n*As mentioned in another answer, hold the option key while dragging.\n\n\nA: Hold down option when dragging. Will disable \"sticky\" edges as needed, when needed, without disabling it all the time by default.\n\nA: Applying the option 'Keep Folders on top when sorting by name', in Finder's Advanced Preferences section appears to work for me.\n", "Q: How do I disable Cmd-D in Terminal?

I have a complete installer of El Capitan as a pkg file and I need to install it.  But first I need to make it an app.\nI can't do it through the MAS because el Capitan is no longer available.\nIs it possible to convert a Package into an App?\n\nA: Theres no need to  are this an app. Here’s what to do, since the .pkg file is basically a folder (if you will), it includes the “app” that the installer runs.\nI think you are wanting to burn/run the installer from a disc/USB? (if not, you can run it from the .pkg file itself by double-clicking and mounting the installer.\nThat being said, this is how to locate and save the .dmg file locally.\nWhat you want to do is:\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on the .pkg file > select \"Show Package Contents\"\n\n*Open the Contents/SharedSupport folder and locate the file named\nInstallESD.dmg.\n\nCopy InstallESD.dmg to another directory of your choosing.

This can take a while to complete, so wait for the “Done” message before continuing.\nWhen you see “Done”, that’s it, your OS X El Capitan installer drive has been created, it’s bootable, and you can use it to update as many Macs as you want to with OS X 10.11.\nTo boot from the installer drive, hold down the Option key during Mac system start, and select it from the startup volume menu.\n\nNote: the OP is trying to create a bootable disc via MAS and Terminal method. In the instructions it tells you to download and save the installer, to avoid deletion after install completes and saving it for future use. It goes on to say load the .app to continue with creating the bootable disc/usb. This is why, I assume the user has worded his question as such.\nI wish people would actually wait for the OP response without thumbing down prior to knowing, if indeed the answer is right or wrong. Or maybe explaining why the answer is wrong by submitting an answer or correcting a wrong one.\n\nA: It no longer seems possible to View Package Contents using a right click in macOS (version 10.15.7 Catalina in 2020). However you can use the pkgutil command in the Terminal to expand the .pkg file as described here:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/251038496\n\nA: Whilst norcal johnny's answer is good, it's missing some vital steps.

Its screen at the top is kind of feeling a bit weird, and I've heard a story of sellers here in my country removing the tamper sensors in iPhones before selling them. How do I know that it hasn't been opened, since if it has, it removes the water resistance of the iPhone?\n\nA: Buy your device from a reputable company.\n(Apple, BestBuy, AT&T, etc)\nThat's the only surefire way you are going to know that the phone (or device) you just shelled the equivalent of a half a rent check for a non-ocean view 600 sq. ft. studio in Miami Beach is of the highest quality, reliability and most importantly authenticity.\nAs always, the old adage always holds true:  If it's too good to be true, it probably is.\nNow, the iPhone 7 has been out less than a month since being released and you are buying one through the secondary market, you should be wary.

Sprint is my carrier. I had tried all of the solutions above before finding this page. None of them work. I spent a few hours chatting with both sprint tech support and sprint worldwide support (via a WiFi connection). After giving up trying to find a resolution to the sms issue, they informed me that my plan included free data roaming. (I hope to God that’s actually true because i know it didn’t used to be.)\nAnyway, I don’t know why I could send sms messages to my parents from Mexico to the US, but not to my wife here with me in Mexico. Every time I tried to send her a text, regardless of the iMessage and Send as SMS settings, I would get an error stating:\n\nI.e. I tried iMessage on and off and send as sms on and off.\nIncidentally, even though I had no icon indicating a data connection, I was receiving sporadic connectivity such as app notifications for emails and other communications but whenever I tried to use an app, I would get an error saying I wasn’t connected to the internet, such as:\n\nAlso, while I was able to call my parents, every attempt to call sprint via their 888 number immediately “call failed”.\nOther things I tried: I made sure that I was sending messages to my wife’s phone number and not her iCloud address. I tried changing the phone type in contacts from iPhone to mobile. I tried adding 1 in front of her number. I also tried adding + in front of the 1. I tried turning off automatic cellular network selecrion and switching networks manually (settings->cellular->network selecrion->automatic).\nFinally I discovered a workaround. You can send sms messages to google voice numbers and luckily, both my wife and I have google voice numbers. I had forwarding turned off on my GV account, so I had to turn it back on in order to receive, since using the GV app requires a data connection.\nFor anyone who tries to look for an actual solution, instead of a work-around, please note, every time you test a solution above, you have to make sure WiFi is off. Note also that Apple disabled the option to tap and hold a message to send as sms. It’s supposed to work automatically if you enable send as sms, but that only works if you have iMessage enabled and there appears to be a bug where if you turn iMessage off and try to message someone whom you’ve imessaged before, it refuses to send an sms in some cases. It converted to sms when I messaged my parents even though the thread had been iMessages up to that point, so I’m not sure what other circumstances are needed to encounter the bug. It could have to do with the location of the recipient, whether it’s a group thread or not, or... it’s anyone’s guess.\n", "Q: Selective Backup in Apple Mail Email Client I have an IMAP Gmail account which I have logged in through Apple Mail email client on my Mac book pro.

Does anyone know how to get rid of it?  Surely if I turn the feature off, the menu item should not stick around!\n\nA: The issue is in fact related to the \"Start Dictation\" menu entry of the 'Edit' menu, which is introduced by the OS wide dictation add-in. \nA suggested workaround is to rearrange the top menu bar: \n\nMy solution was to disguise the Edit menu. Changing its name did not\n  work, but moving it in the menu bar from fourth to fifth position did.\n  (For that I used View > Toolbars > Customize Toolbars and Menus.)

It's like the trackpad doesn't depress at all.\nI've done some research and some people said it could be a battery issue, with the battery expanding, and other people said maybe it was a software update that could have happened. I haven't done a significant software update in a while, so I don't think that's it.\nAny experiences out there with this?\n\nA: I went in to the Genius Bar and got an answer, so here it is!\nNote that this may not work for everyone, but it did work for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*The first thing the tech did was have me save everything and power off the computer. Wait until the screen is completely off and everything is powered down. \n\n*Plug in your MacBook. \n\n*Press the following keys in the bottom left of the keyboard: ctrl+option+shift (holding them all at the same time) and then tap the power button key in the very top right.\n\n*If the light on the charger is amber, it should flash green and then go back to amber. If it was already green, it will stay green.\n\n\nThis is called an SMC reset, or system management controller. \nThe way the tech explained it to me, this resets how the computer distributes power, and should make the computer send the correct amount of power back to the trackpad. I don't know if that's exactly how it works, but that's basically how he explained it to me.\nAfter doing this SMC reset, the trackpad started working immediately. Hopefully this works for you as well!\n", "Q: Format a pen drive in NTFS format I've formatted my pen drive in FAT format but it's not showing in a Windows laptop, so I'm thinking the formatted pen drive through OS X is not compactible with other OSs. How can I format a pen drive through OS X El Capitan?\n\nA: OS X and macOS can't format partitions as NTFS or write to NTFS without third-party software (read is built in).  Both Windows and Mac support read/write to FAT and you can erase a disk and set the format to FAT in Disk Utility which can be read in Windows. If Windows cannot read the FAT volume then this is a separate problem with the disk or Windows as it should work.\n\nA: Your flash drive is partitioned using the GUID Partition Table scheme. You need to partition the flash drive using a Master Boot Record scheme. Also you should choose to only have a single partition. You can use either MS-DOS (FAT) or ExFAT formats, but the MS-DOS (FAT) format is more reliable. You do not need to use the ExFAT format unless some files exceed 4 GB in size.\n\nA: I would advice formatting any drive you want to use between OS X and Windows to exFAT. exFAT supports read/write both on OS X and Windows. You can easily format you drive to exFAT using Disk utility: WD guide and official Apple forum thread. \nFAT-32 also works between Mac OS X and Windows just fine, but it limits you to 4GB per-file. exFAT doesn't have such limitation. \nIn your question you mentioned:\n\nI've formatted my pen drive in FAT format but it's not showing in a Windows laptop\n\nIf you want to stick to FAT-32 then try to reformat your drive once again using Disk utility on Mac or format it under Windows. On Windows you might want to uncheck the Quick format option to ensure better formatting.\nAlso make sure the USB port you're connecting your drive to is working and the drive itself is not corrupted.\n", "Q: What's a good solution for a couple extra hours on an 11\" MacBook Air? My son has a MacBook Air which was required for school (a).\nHowever, it sometimes comes dangerously close to running out of power near the end of the school day despite the fact that we've (I think) set it up correctly for low power consumption.\nI have suggested taking the power adapter to school, or even getting a second one to carry in his backpack) but apparently many of the classrooms don't provide enough wall sockets, or don't have them handy to the desks.\nThe local Apple store was spectacularly unhelpful given that they only sell such devices for non-laptops.\nWhat's a good solution for him to plug into his laptop during recess/lunch to get the battery levels up to a point where he'll easily see out the day? Something that would give an extra one to three hours would be ideal.\nAdditionally, if anyone has some really good tips for lowering power consumption, I'd be happy to hear them though, of course, my question is really about a suitable power device.\n\n(a) I asked if a Linux laptop would be okay and they said yes, but my son would likely get beaten up in the playground :-)\n\nA: I am able to actively use my MacBook Air for around 7-8 hours. It is just a basic advice but it works fine for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Lower the screen brightness - it's relatively easy to control brightness on MacBook (F1 or F2).\n\n*Lower the backlit of the keyboard or, as your son is using his laptop in school during the day, it even makes sense to fully turn off the backlit (F5 or F6).\n\n*When the battery is getting to 25-30% I would quit all the cloud based apps like DropBox, OneDrive or iCloud. In Dropbox you can just pause syncing, which is a really handy feature.\n\n*Quit all the unnecessary apps. For example if in the class kids had a need to use MS Word and in the next class they don't need to use it, then show your son how to quit programs what he's not using.\n\n\nI'm not sure if this will give MacBook Air battery two extra hours of life, but I would say from an hour to hour and a half.\nOne more thing would be somewhat reasonable usage of the battery. Meaning not leaving laptop to charge for hours when the battery is full and vice versa draining the battery all the way to 0% and then start charging it. Li-ion batteries don't like to be fully drained. Charging the battery with the mentioned above mindset could help it live longer.\n\nA: As a start, I would suggest your son does the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure his Energy Saver settings (System Preferences > Energy Saver) are such that they reduce his power usage\n\n*Adjust screen brightness (System Preferences > Display) or via the F1 and F2 keys.\n\n*If he doesn't already, get in the habit of not booting the MacBook until he first needs it at school.\n\n*Reset the SMC (see instructions below)\n\n\nReset the SMC\nYour computer's System Management Controller (SMC) can also be reset. The instructions for resetting the SMC depend on three things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does your device run from a built-in battery? (In your case, yes)\n\n*Does your device run from a removable battery? \n\n*Does your device just run off power from the wall?\n\n\nThe MacBook Air fits into the first group above. Follow these steps for resetting your SMC:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer\n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nHope this helps. Please report back and let us know.\n\nA: You don't mention the model of the Air so I'm not sure of its specs but there are two apps that can help prolong battery life and I use both:\nTurbo Boost Switcher deactivates the CPU's turbo boost mode, which it's estimated can save 10-20% of battery life. \nGFXCardStatus can stop the Mac switching to the discrete (i.e. non-integrated) graphics, and also save power. \nI know you're looking for a gadget to do the job here but really just a little common sense and a few apps will do equally well. \n", "Q: iPhone text messages are delivered to my work iPad! My iPhone text messages are delivered to my work iPad, what is happening and how can I put it right?\n\nA: You need to change the iMessage setting on your iPad. Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > Messages\n\n*Tap on the Send & Receive\n\n*The next window will list all the accounts and/or numbers you can be reached on with the iPad\n\n*Uncheck the iPhone mobile phone number listed\n\n*Make any other necessary changes\n\n*Exit your settings\n\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: How to exclude a sub folder from iCloud drive in macOS Sierra? I have my Documents folder synced with iCloud drive, I want to exclude some sub folders from the iCloud drive is there a way to achieve this?\n\nA: update 2022: this method doesn't work anymore. you need to change the directory name to *.nosync, as described in other answers.\nAdding one empty file named .nosync to a folder will prevent that folder from syncing.\nYou can also use this as a file extension to specific files, but the folder treatment is quite useful.\nOnce you've had a folder sync, you can now also prevent it from syncing on some (or all endpoints) with a utility named Bailiff, if for some reason you don't want just to delete the files from iCloud entirely and instead want to prevent the next \"initial\" sync.\n\n*\n\n*https://eclecticlight.co/downloads/\n\nA: Here are all the file/folder names excluded so maybe one of these could be used for a workaround:\nFilename:\n\n\n*\n\n*is .DS_Store\n\n*begins with (A Document Being Saved\n\n*contains .nosync (in any case)\n\n*is .ubd\n\n*contains .weakpkg\n\n*is tmp (in any case)\n\n*is .tmp (in any case)\n\n*is desktop.ini (in any case)\n\n*begins with ~$\n\n*is Microsoft User Data (in any case)\n\n*is $RECYCLE.BIN (in any case)\n\n*is iPhoto Library (in any case)\n\n*is Dropbox (in any case) \n\n*is OneDrive (in any case)\n\n*is IDrive-Sync (in any case)\n\n*is .dropbox (in any case)\n\n*is .dropbox.attr (in any case)\n\n*is icon\\r (in any case)\n\n\nExtension is (in any case):\n\n\n*\n\n*tmp\n\n*photoslibrary\n\n*photolibrary\n\n*aplibrary\n\n*migratedaplibrary\n\n*migratedphotolibrary\n\n*migratedaperturelibrary\nExtension is more than 2 chars and filename is ~\nSource: reversing iCloud daemon.\nHopefully in a future version of the OS they let us put .nosync inside the folder to exclude it, or have an .IgnoreList like Resilio has.\n\nA: I created this Automator workflow to do it from the context menu in Finder https://github.com/tsdexter/iCloud-NoSync\n\nA: It looks like directories that are named \"tmp\" or end with \".tmp\" are not synced. A cloud icon with a line through it appears next to the directory along with anything inside of it.\n\nA: Rename the folder or file:\nmv fileorfolder fileorfolder.nosync\n\nCreate a symlink that get's synced:\nln -s fileorfolder.nosync fileorfolder\n\nRepeat on every machine.\n\nA: Adding the .nosync file to the directory is not working anymore.\nThe directory has to be renamed to contain .nosync. Moreover, according to this thread on Reddit, it should be possible to chain the words like my_file.nosync.noindex to not only mark file as not-to-sync but also to hide it from Spotlight.\n\nA: Node developers:\nTo add an empty file named .nosync to every node_modules subfolder, run this shell script from a parent directory:\nfind . -name node_modules -exec touch {}/.nosync \\;\n\n\nA: The answer that worked for me really well was added as a comment above (https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/335629/117233), but for the sake of being thorough, I thought to add the actual code.\nThe way it worked for me was the following:\n\n*\n\n*Delete the folder you don't want to sync (or rename it if the content isn't auto-generated, e.g. node_modules)\n\n*run the following in the parent directory of the above:\n\nmkdir NAME_OF_FOLDER.nosync && ln -s NAME_OF_FOLDER.nosync NAME_OF_FOLDER\n\nThen copy your content to the NAME_OF_FOLDER.nosync folder.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: You can, if you want to say exclude node_modules, make a dir/node_modules in an unsynced folder, move the files there, then create a symlink to that folder where the original node modules were. All code will run the same except iCloud sync which excludes symlinks.\n.nosync doesn't work for this because node_modules must be called node_modules and should also not ever be synced.\n\nA: I just create folders directly under my user home that I want to keep only locally (separate from my iCloud folders).\n", "Q: MacBook Pro: necessary specs for virtualization So I am a software guy who is pretty oblivious when it comes to personal computer hardware. I really want to ditch my old pc for a macbook, but I'm not really sure of the right hardware specs I should be searching for.\nThe most intensive work I'll be doing is running lots of vagrant vms with virtualbox (max of about 15ish). So what specs should I be looking for: cpu, ram, storage, cores, ect?  Which specs are the most important?\nIf this might be a better question for SuperUser let me know and I'll try to migrate the post there.\n\nA: Depends on specs and activity of the boxes. 15x one core and 512MB RAM will run on a Core i5 and 16GB RAM. If the boxes are going to need more RAM, you'll need to run fewer boxes at a time. A VM typically requires about 100MB RAM on the hypervisor side, macOS and any tools you might have running also need some memory, so those are the constraints of the system you'd be working with. More RAM isn't an option, it's soldered on, and 16GB is the limit.\n\nA: In a sense your question will invite opinions rather than facts, but here are my thoughts based on my experiences.\nIn a sense it depends on the type of vagrant boxes you intend to run, especially since they're no longer tied to VirtualBox. However, for me I've always found the most important hardware requirement for any virtualisation was the amount of physical RAM I had installed. So make sure you invest in a MacBook with (or capable of having) plenty of RAM.\nBeyond that I would say a lot gets down to your software settings for your vagrant boxes. Here are some interesting reads that may be of interest:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to make vagrant performance not suck\n\n*Vagrant VirtualBox extremely slow despite 8GB RAM SSD HD 2.53Ghz core 2 duo\nI hope this helps!\n", "Q: After restoring all of my files are sitting under my documents. How can i clean up? I had to erase and reinstall everything on my macbook pro.  I was having issues restoring from timeline so I did a manual copy over from an external hard drive onto my computer.  \nThe issue is that I don't see the Pictures, Music or Movies folders in Finder any more so I just put all of my files inside \"My Documents\". \nI thought that itunes would reorganize my files when i imported everything into itunes but it doesn't seem like it as the machines still thinks i have 200+ GB of documents.

How can I get Siri on macOS to sound as high-quality and natural as Siri on iOS?\nI have downloaded Samantha voice for Mac before. I even tried deleting Samantha's voice and redownloading it, but Siri's voice is still like a robot!\nWhen I change Siri's voice to Male (or any other accent or language) and then revert it back to Female, the voice gets better (still not the Siri I have on my iPhone), but then again after a few moments, it's back to default system voice.\nWhat is going wrong here?\n\nA: I had the same problem but figured it out. First of all, it does take some time for the high quality voice to silently download in the background, and get enabled. But for me, weeks went by and the low-quality voice remained. Here's why:\nIt has to do with your App Store System Preferences. I had all the checkboxes under \"Automatically Check for updates\" disabled, including \"Install System Data Files and security updates\". (This is to avoid any surprise bills when I'm tethering with my phone). Well, it turns out, when this is disabled, it won't download the voices from Apple's CDN (example URL: http://swcdn.apple.com/content/downloads/06/40/031-72924/0p9g9iuul9uaojp42eatzq4 b3zr38r4dgw/CustomVoice_en_GB_martha.pkg)\nI haven't narrowed it down to this one checkbox (I enabled all of them) but I'm pretty sure it's the culprit. After enabling these checkboxes, I toggled Siri off and on a couple of times and watched the console - finally it downloaded and installed the voices and placed them in System/Library/Speech/Voices . You can keep an eye on System/Library/System/Library/Receipts to see when it actually installs the voices. Mystery solved (for me anyway). \nApple really needs to add a warning message or an override when you enable Siri if it's not going to be able to provide the high quality voice. It took hours of real digging to figure this out.\n\nA: As it turns out, Siri's enhanced voice quality doesn't come preinstalled on macOS Sierra (just like on iOS). After you install macOS Sierra, your Mac will start downloading Siri's enhanced voice, which is a ~1.35GB download.\nIf you're facing the same problem and you still can't hear Siri's enhanced voice, even after a few days of installing macOS Sierra (like what happened to me), I advise keeping your Mac plugged in and awake at night (or a couple of nights if you have a slow connection), the enhanced voice should download overnight when you're not using your Mac.\nThere is also a thread on MacRumors forums regarding this issue (http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/low-quality-siri-voice.1981561/).\n\nA: The things that worked for me is to uncheck the box \"enable Siri \" and check it again, it will ask you to set again \"Hey Siri\" however its quite simple \nHope this solve your situation \nRegards \n", "Q: Reinstall MacOS Sierra I've already installed macOS Sierra.\nBut I've also performed a \"general\" cleaning and I suspect some files were gone.\nNow the whole system is slow, some things doesn't behave the way they used to.\nIs it possible to download again macOS Sierra from AppStore and simple reinstall it?\nI mean, install macOS Sierra over macOS Sierra that is already up and running (not so well...).\nThanks a lot for your help. \n\nA: The short answer is YES.\nIt is possible to install Sierra over Sierra.  The procedure is no different than installing one OS over another.  Personally, I would wipe/format my target drive (using Disk Utility) first.  Be sure you have a backup of anything you don't want deleted forever.\nThere are a couple ways you can do this:\n\n*\n\n*Internet Recovery (Hold Command R while booting)\n\n*Download Sierra from App Store and create a USB installer (preferred)\n\nBoth methods will utitimately work identically once you have the installer loaded.  With option 2, if you choose to restart or want to do it all over again, you won't have to download the image repeatedly.\nTo create the installer, you just need an 8GB or larger USB flash drive and the installation image.  Once downloaded, format the USB drive with a GUID partition, Journaled and call it Sierra (or something easy for you to remember).  Then, issue the following command:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Sierra/ --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app/ --nointeraction\n\nRe-install to your hearts content.\n", "Q: Sierra Finder aliases appearing as generic icons Since updating to macOS Sierra, many Finder aliases appear as generic document icons rather than as the informative icons that were available in previous versions of OS X.\nIs there something I can do to fix this?\n\nA: It is a bug in 10.12.1, there is no current permanent fix.\n\nA: It seems to be a Finder refresh issue. If you kill the Finder.app and relaunch it, the normal icon will show up.\n\nA: I've seen this too. It refreshes for me when I do command option up arrow (open new window to parent folder, closing existing window), then command option down arrow (go back to original window). Or sometimes even just closing the window & reopening it.\n\nA: Do a \"Get Info\" on the alias, and you should see that the correct icon is displayed at the top left of the Get Info window.\nCopy the icon and paste it back.  When the window is closed, the correct icon should appear in the Finder window. This should survive a reboot.\nOnce the icon has been pasted back in, the size of the alias should grow larger.\n", "Q: What does the checkbox for some apps in iCloud > Options > Documents mean? In System Preferences > iCloud > Options > Documents, there are checkboxes for \"Apps that store documents and data in iCloud.\"\nFor many apps, it's clear what the checkbox means: the app can, optionally, store a document in iCloud that can be accessed from any of my devices.\nBut there are also checkboxes for Mail, System Preferences itself, and Weather. None of those create documents. In Mail's case, the mail is stored in IMAP accounts, so what would having the checkbox checked mean? What would having the checkbox unchecked for either System Preferences or Weather mean?\n\nIn the top-level iCloud system preference, there is a separate checkbox for Mail. That checkbox, when checked, shares the configuration information for all e-mail accounts one has.\n\nA: Firstly, the checkbox for Mail just means it syncs Mail.app settings via iCloud and also it enables the iCloud Account in Mail.app or turn it off. \nSecondly, System Preferences settings are also synced via iCloud, for example iCloud syncs my preferred Wifi to any new iOS or Mac I enable iCloud on.\nLikewise Weather locations for any city you setup is synced over iCloud.\n", "Q: What happens if I use unencrypted time machine backup from a mac that has FileVault turned on? I just got a mac and it asked me if i want to use FileVault to have an encrypted disk. I choose yes so that is setup now.  I now just bought an external hard drive and I plugged it in for the first time and set it up with time machine.  \nI realized after it started backing up that there was an option stating: \"Do you want to encrypt your backup?\" and I did NOT have that checked.\nSo I didn't have that checked and I am trying to figure out a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it redundant to do encrypted backup from an already encrypted computer using File Vault?\n\n*Given my computer is encrypted but my backup is not, does that create any problems?  Is the external hard drive basically the same as if my machine wasn't encrypted?\n\n*Should I chnage the time machine backup to be encrypted?  Is there any downside>?\n\n*Any other things to consider in this decision?\n\nA: In your current setup your backups are not encrypted whatsoever. That means if someone steals your external disk your data is fully accessible to an attacker. That challenges the idea of using full disk encryption / Filevault2 in the first place.\nI would recommend to either\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an encrypted sparse bundle image on your external disk and use that as your backup drive. The process is somewhat tricky as it requires tinkering with the sparsebundle image. The process is explained here and here.\n\n*Encrypt the external disk entirely. The disadvantage is that you will need the password to open that disk on other Macs. The advantage is that the entire content will be encrypted. To do this simply right-click the disk and select Encrypt...\nEither way make sure you note the encryption passwords for Filevault and the backup disk somewhere else than on your computer or the backup disk, as you risk locking yourself out of all your data and backups.\nAs mentioned in the comment there is the downside that encryption slows down disk performance. That is also true for Filevault2 disk in your Mac. But Intel CPUs are pretty optimized for encryption operations these days and performance degradation should be low.\n\nA: FileVault 2 is a full disk encryption mechanism. Individual files are not encrypted so that is why you would need to enable it on your time machine volume.  Without doing that, all your files on the backup drive would be readable. \nPerformance is not so much of a problem on recent machines especially with SSDs. Furthermore you are not encrypting individual files on the fly. \n", "Q: Why is macOS is unable to verify my Yahoo user ID Through System Preferences > Internet Accounts\nI enter my Yahoo user ID and password and am getting error message, \"unable to verify user id and password\".\nI have enabled POP in my Yahoo account and reset password to ensure it's accurate. \n\nA: In Apple Mail, add a new account and after entering a full name, email address and password, hold down the Option key. The Create button will change to Continue, allowing one to manually configure the account settings.\nUse the following settings:\nIncoming Server - imap.mail.yahoo.com\n\nOutgoing Server - smtp.mail.yahoo.com\n\nIncoming Port - 993 (requires SSL)\n\nOutgoing Port - 465 (requires SSL/TLS)\n\nUsername: full email address (example: bill@yahoo.com)\n\nPassword: the password you login to Yahoo with\n\nMake sure to identify four mailboxes as special: Drafts, Trash, Sent and Bulk Mail (Junk).\nFor example, in the left pane under the heading \"On My Mac\" under the Yahoo account, select the Draft folder. Then on the menu bar select Mailbox > Use This Mailbox For > Drafts.  Do this for the other 3 mailboxes to make sure your mail gets sorted correctly.\n\nA: The easiest way to override this error is by deleting Yahoo from MacMail box and then add it under 'Other'. You will be prompted to add the new email manually. Once added, go to MacMail to login, make sure to use the temporary password provided from the yahoo account (steps below) and not your yahoo password.\nHere are the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to https://login.yahoo.com/account/security? (You may need to sign in to your account again) and click on the app passwords section.\n\n*Select your non-Yahoo app from the drop down menu and generate an app password for it.\n\n*Open that app and enter your email and the app password that you just generated to sign in.\n\n\nSince app passwords are one-time use, you won't need to memorize it or use it in other places.\n\nA: That error is not due to an incorrect pass, that would be along the lines of, \"wrong password email combination\", that is just saying its unable to complete the transaction between yahoo, and your MBA. Login to your yahoo, and check if it has denied it login, due to being something like a, suspicious login. If thats not the case then there must be an issue with Yahoo, do you own an email account of another provider you could try? Before ruling it out as an issue with your MBA. \n\nA: When I was having problems with my Yahoo account on my Macbook Pro, I deleted my Yahoo account and added it back. It seems once a year or so I start having issues with my Yahoo account on my Macbook, either it won't send the emails or I have trouble receiving them. I deleted my Yahoo account on my Mac then I added it back under \"Add Account.\" But, I did not add it under Yahoo account, I added it under \"other\" account. Typed out my email address and then for password I went to my iphone and hit the \"account key\" and went to the bottom option \"get an app password.\" That gave me a 16 digit temp password and I was able to add my Yahoo account back to my Macbook without anymore problems. It sent and received emails afterward without any further problems. Perhaps that will work for some of you? I know these constant security measures that we are facing can be a real pain in the behind but it's only because there are so many dishonest people out there causing problems for all of us. Good luck! \n", "Q: Hombrew is asking me for a version of Xcode the OS doesnt support I need to download certain apps through homebrew, one of them being pygtk, but when putting the rather simple command that should install it homebrew says my Xcode (6.4 because I am on Yosemite) is outdated and that need the 7.2.1 which I can't install because it's not supported in Yosemite. How can I fix this? \n\nA: This may mean that you can't install pygtk through homebrew on Yosemite. You may still be able to compile from source, even with your version of Xcode.\n\nA: You could see this answer on stackoverflow which tells us Xcode 7.2.1 is the last support Xcode for Yosemite and supplies a URL for those with a developer account (Xcode_7.2.1.dmg). The URL appears to be valid (starts a download). I've used Xcode 7.2 on Yosemite.\n", "Q: Spilled water on Macbook Pro 13 inch, early 2015 I've spilled 5-10 mL of liquid on my Macbook Pro (13 inch, early 2015)  some hours ago. I purchased this laptop a few months ago. It has 16 GB of RAM and 512 GB storage, though this is probably irrelevant. The liquid came in contact with the trackpad (including the edges of it). I did not turn it off. Rather, I ran the Apple Diagnostics Test and it came out fine. Several hours later, I ran the diagnostics test again and it was fine. The laptop, including the trackpad, is functioning normally at this moment.\n\nWhat is the likelihood that the laptop, particularly the trackpad, will develop problems in the future? \n\nAlso, \n\nIs it worth the time to go to an Apple Store and get this checked out? \n\nNormally, I wouldn't even ask; I'd take it to the Apple Store just in case. However, I am very busy this weekend and a visit to the Apple Store will take a good 2 hours of my time, at the very least. Resassurance from experts on this site will give me peace of mind. \nMoreover, I would also appreciate a comment from people who know a thing or two about the hardware of this laptop model regarding how 'water protected' the trackpad structure is. I am, again, mainly worried about liquid having leaked through its edges.\n\nA: You won't know anything until you take it apart, that is the sad truth. In the mean time, keeping it angled with the vent up and the trackpad down will hopefully make any liquid that got in stay away from the motherboard until is evaporates. If any corrosion is happening, you may not notice until an electrical connection is actually disrupted by it. \n\nA: OK, having wrecked a couple of Macbooks myself because someone spilled liquid into them, I'll tell you what to expect:\nFirst, power it off and remove the battery if you can (but I don't think you can with your model) and prop it up so any liquid can run out. Give it about a day for the liquid to dry.\nOr better yet, get it to a repair shop if you can. They'll know how to take it apart and dry it out. Note that it's important to remove the liquid and not dry it in place. A hot-air hair dryer would not help; you could just as well air-dry it yourself. Jets of compressed air that actually blow the water out of the machine would be better.\nOtherwise if you have a teeny-tiny phillips-head screwdriver, and the guts to do it, dismantle it yourself and pat everything dry that you can reach. Keep very good track of which screw came from where.\nThe bad news:\nAfter the liquid dries, the residue remains on the circuit boards. It will almost certainly contain sugars or other corrosive chemicals. These will slowly eat away at the circuitry. So you think you dodged a bullet with the spilled drink, but in about three years you will start to experience unexplained flakiness. I spent about $400 replacing parts in mine before I remembered the mocha someone spilled in it three years prior and realized that I would certainly have to replace the motherboard itself.\nThe good news:\nIn your case it was just water, and just a little bit, and not on the motherboard. There's a good chance that you did dodge a bullet. And in any event, you have probably another three years to start saving your pennies for a replacement.\n\nA: If you spill water on your MacBook or MacBook Pro - if you have an air purifier, target it to the keyboard/screen where the liquid is until it's dry.\nI put my MacBook Pro in an upside-down v-shape over a towel and then positioned my air purifier a few inches away from the keyboard/screen - in 5-10 mins my computer was working just fine! Right after I spilled a 1/2 glass of ice water on it I could not even turn it on!\nI think an air purifier works much, much better than a fan - I think the air purifier just sucks the water right out in literally minutes! If you have a high quality air purifier, it can save your Mac Book!\n\nA: I drowned my 2010 Macbook Pro with a fresh full cup of hot black tea (no sugar or milk). I immediately turned it over in the v-shape. When I moved it 2 hours later to a heater on pilot light only, (lightly warm), a waterfall came out the back end. At the heater it came on, then died again all by itself. I saw water dripping from the disc drive on the side. I pound it against my thigh to get out as much as possible. Then, the fan came on.  I did not want it to operate, so I opened up the back. The fan then stopped. I looked under the battery. There was small puddle of water, so wiped it up. However, I did not disconnect the battery because I didn't know how, safely. I also wanted to look under the hard drive, but I did not have a star wrench.  It sat without back upside down for 18 hours, (covered with a think cotton shirt), when I took it to my Mac repair person.\nHe said to get a new computer, because of the corrosion that will likely happen. It was running and started up, but acting strangely. It has been a workhorse for me; I've taken it all over Europe teaching with the powerpoint, emails, surfing, etc. etc. My right arm. Being female, sad to have drowned it. It has 500 storage and updated RAM 3 years ago.\nI shopped for alternatives, like the new Airbook. I used to do video, that's why i got a Pro.  But I don't anymore, so think Airbook will be good enough for me and my budget.\nMeanwhile, I am using it. The repair man had no time for it, but because I love it, I am nursing it.  finding out its problems.  Lost the sound. Did I also loose the camera (unknown). seems the Shift and or Command key is locked down because it is selecting multiple emails and paragraphs on Word.  So, I saw someone clean the shift key on the You tube (could not hear it), so I'll try that.  It starts up in safe mode, so can't do a back up. But repair man said the hard drive is fine, so that will just go into a new computer.\nSo no YouTubes or Zoom Meetings.  I do webinars, so had to get my iphone doing that. iPhone clatters and clicks on Zoom, so that is not a reliable option. The display screen is fine, sometimes loads strangely, but it loads, fine with me. But choosing a file to attach, I get the multiple options. So shift key and command key is next on my list to clean.\nNow I can't edit, because it is selecting everything! So have to go! thanks for listening.  Hate to ruin a good workhorse.  But onward.  There is a new computer in my near future.  \n", "Q: My phone was purchased the US, and don't have purchase proof. Can I get it swapped in India? I purchased my phone from US and brought it back to India. Now, its rear camera is not performing well, and there is also touch problem. I'd like to get it swapped. However, I lost my purchase proof. Can I still get it swapped without the invoice?\n\nA: fbara is correct - there are too many variables for anyone here to give you a definite answer here. But here is what I can tell you. \nIf your iPhone is still covered by Apple's global warranty, then it will still be covered. If you purchased an Applecare plan, and it's still within the period of cover, then it will be covered. If it's out of Apple's own warranty period, it may still be covered depending on your local (India's) consumer laws.\nWhether or not Apple will swap your phone will be up to them to determine. They will need to assess the faults and will then decide whether it's a repair or replacement proposition, or indeed one in which you need to pay some money.\nOne thing you can do is check your serial number here. \nChecking your serial number will advise you if it still has a valid purchase date, what repairs and service coverage it has, and whether you're still eligible for technical support over the phone. If you're not sure where to find your Serial number, the easiest way to do it is to go to Settings > General > About and it's listed about halfway down.\nFinally, it is definitely still worth you calling Apple about this - even if checking your serial number shows your coverage has ended. Apple has been known to still honour repairs and replacements for products outside warranty periods depending on individual circumstances. They may also be able to arrange a swap by putting a hold on your credit card to the value of a replacement phone and just shipping you a replacement. As long as you send the other one back within a certain period, you'll never be charged.\nIn summary, just call Apple. In India the toll free number is 000800 1009009 (as long as you're calling from a landline, otherwise you may be charged by your provider if calling from a mobile).\n", "Q: Why am I getting an “invalid active developer path” when attempting to use Git after upgrading to macOS Ventura?

As a follow on step, you may need to reset the path to Xcode if you have several versions or want the command line tools to run without Xcode.\nsudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app\nsudo xcode-select --switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools\n\nI found the solution in this question, Command Line Tools not working.\nYou may get an error message: \"Can't install the software because it is not currently available from the Software Update server\". In this case xcode-select --reset works as pointed by akozin.\n\nA: Here are the steps I needed to go through for Mojave:\nFirst xcode-select --reset.\nNext I needed to upgrade xcode tools to the latest version: sudo softwareupdate -ia --verbose (NB: this runs all available updates from the app store, there is a way to specify that you only want to update one app/program, but I don't know it off the top of my head).\nYou can try this command another time if it shows some inconsistent behaviour during the first try.\nFinally verify that it worked by using a git command of your choosing, e.g. git status.\n\nA: I tried the xcode-select --install but I was forced to install it from the App Store.\nThen all git stuff ran smoothly.\n\nA: xcode-select --install and xcode-select --reset didn't work for me.\nI had to download it manually from Apple Developers website: https://developer.apple.com/download/\nChoose the Command line of your current OS. \n\n\nA: The accepted answer is correct, but also note that git does not make it obvious if the error is coming from remote or from local. If you are running OS X on your remote, your install problem may be on the remote side and you'll see the same error on git clone and git pull but NOT on git status.\n", "Q: Unlock with Apple Watch on Sierra not working I have it enabled on my 2013 Retina MacBook Pro, my Apple Watch is on the same wifi network, and bluetooth is enabled as well. When I wake up my Mac, it says “Unlocking with Apple Watch” for several seconds, then it times out and prompts me to enter my password. I don't receive any notification on my watch either. I tried disabling and re-enabling the feature, but that doesn’t have any effect.

When the passphrase is provided by the user, this\n         option also specifies whether the passphrase should be stored into the keychain once it has\n         been verified to be correct.  The argument must be ``yes'' or ``no''.  The default is ``no''.\n\nSo just do the following:\necho \"UseKeychain yes\" >> ~/.ssh/config\n\nA: I had this problem before and I've found a way to bypass this. I just created a file named config in my ~/.ssh folder, where I've added the following lines:\nHost github.com\nHostName github.com\nIdentityFile ~/.ssh/github\nIdentitiesOnly yes\n\nI am not sure why, but Host and HostName both are important. In my case if one of them was not present then the solution didn't work.\nThen, I just did an ssh-add -K and it was working even after the restart.\n\nA: If you are using a different version of ssh (e.g. installed via homebrew) the above solutions will not work out of the box. For instance, AddKeysToAgent yes and UseKeychain yes in the .ssh/config file are not recognized by non-Apple ssh versions and will cause an error. The same for the -A or -K option for the ssh client.\nThat means @mluisbrown's answer will not work at all. You can use method 1 of @Giacomo1968's answer and explicitly use the macOS ssh-add utility in your .bash_profile to add all keys to the keychain, i.e.:\n/usr/bin/ssh-add -A\n\nAs mentioned by a comment above, you may have to add a key to the keychain first: e.g. /usr/bin/ssh-add -K .ssh/github\n\nA: I found that ssh-add -K gave me \"illegal option -- K\".\nThis was because ssh-add was a strange version coming from /usr/local/bin (installed by brew?). I was able to add the key by specific use of the ssh-add located in /usr/bin:\n/usr/bin/ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\n\nA: As of macOS Sierra 10.12.2 Apple added an ssh_config option called UseKeychain which allows a 'proper' resolution to the problem. Add the following to your ~/.ssh/config file:\nHost *\n   AddKeysToAgent yes\n   UseKeychain yes     \n\nFrom the ssh_config man page on 10.12.2:\n\nUseKeychain\nOn macOS, specifies whether the system should search for passphrases in the user's keychain when attempting to use a particular key. When the passphrase is provided by the user, this option also specifies whether the passphrase should be stored into the keychain once it has been verified to be correct.  The argument must be 'yes' or 'no'.  The default is 'no'.\n\n\nA: As explained here, this is the recommended method since macOS 10.12.2:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the following lines to your ~/.ssh/config file:\nHost *\n    UseKeychain yes\n    AddKeysToAgent yes\n\n\n*Any key you add to the ssh-agent using the ssh-add /path/to/your/private/key/id_rsa command will be automatically added to the keychain, and should be autoloaded upon reboot.\n\nI'm adding this answer because:\n\n\n*\n\n*Other answers tell you to add the IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa line, but that option is not needed for autoloading the keys (and it'll actually bind that particular key for the host section your add it to, which you won't want if you use different keys for different hots).\n\n*The accepted answer mentions UseKeychain, but that is not enough to persist the keys in ssh-agent after a reboot.\n\n\nA: Amending ~/.ssh/config to add UseKeyChain for all hosts \nis enough to stop this recurring nightmare ;)\nHost *\n UseKeychain yes\n\nIf the file is empty or doesn't exist simple create and/or add the above configuration.\n\nA: I updated to Mac OS X Sierra (10.12.6). I could ssh into other hosts but not into github.com.\nThis is what I had to insert into ~/.ssh/config:\nPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes ssh-dss,ssh-rsa\n\nAfter that change, I could use github as before.\n\nA: I've written a short post about this topic that might help you.\nA solution is calling ssh-add -A command on every startup.\nJust add .plist file with the following content to the path ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ or create one with Lingon app:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>ssh-add-a</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>ssh-add</string>\n        <string>-A</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n<!-- @@@@LingonWhatStart:ssh-add -A@@@@LingonWhatEnd -->\n\n\nA: I had this issue as well when attempting to deploy some code using Capistrano. Very frustrating. Here are two methods I know of to deal with this issue.\nMethod 1: Add all known keys to the SSH agent.\nSo one solution I found is to run ssh-add with the -A option—which adds all known identities to the SSH agent using any passphrases stored in your keychain—like this:\nssh-add -A\n\nNow this works but it won’t persist across reboots. So if you want to never worry about this again, just open up your user’s ~/.bash_profile file like this:\nnano ~/.bash_profile\n\nAnd add this line to the bottom:\nssh-add -A 2>/dev/null;\n\nNow when you open a new Terminal window, all should be good!\nMethod 2: Add only SSH keys that are in the keychain to the agent.\nSo while the ssh-add -A option should work for most basic cases, I ran into an issue recently where I had 6-7 Vagrant boxes (which uses SSH keys/identities for access) setup on a machine on top of the more common id_rsa.pub in place.\nLong story short, I ended up being locked out of a remote server due to too many failed tries based on SSH keys/identities since the server access was based on a password and SSH keys/identities are SSH keys/identities. So the SSH agent tried all of my SSH keys, failed and I couldn’t even get to the password prompt.\nThe problem is that ssh-add -A will just arbitrarily add every single SSH key/identity you have to the agent even if it’s not necessary to do so; such as in the case of Vagrant boxes.\nMy solution after much testing was as follows.\nFirst, if you have more SSH keys/identities added to your agent than you need—as shown with ssh-add -l then purge them all from the agent like so:\nssh-add -D\n\nWith that done, then start the SSH agent as a background process like so:\neval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\n\nNow, it gets weird and I am not too sure why. In some cases you can specifically add the ~/.ssh/id_rsa key/identity to the agent like so:\nssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n\nType in your passphrase, hit Return and you should be good to go.\nBut in other cases simply running this is enough to get the key/identity added:\nssh-add -K\n\nIf that’s all worked, type in ssh-add -l and you should see one lone SSH key/identity listed.\nAll good? Now open up your .bash_profile:\nnano ~/.bash_profile\n\nAnd add this line to the bottom; comment or remove the -A version if you have that in place:\nssh-add -K 2>/dev/null;\n\nThat will allow the SSH key/identity to be reloaded to the SSH agent on each startup/reboot.\nUPDATE: Apple has now added a UseKeychain option to the open SSH config options and considers ssh-add -A a solution as well.\nAs of macOS Sierra 10.12.2, Apple has added a UseKeychain config option for SSH configs. Checking the man page (via man ssh_config) shows the following info:\nUseKeychain\n        On macOS, specifies whether the system should search for\n        passphrases in the user's keychain when attempting to use a par-\n        ticular key. When the passphrase is provided by the user, this\n        option also specifies whether the passphrase should be stored\n        into the keychain once it has been verified to be correct.  The\n        argument must be ``yes'' or ``no''.  The default is ``no''.\n\nWhich boils down to Apple seeing the solution as either adding ssh-add -A to your .bash_profile as explained in this Open Radar ticket or adding UseKeychain as one of the options in a per user ~/.ssh/config.\n\nA: There is a similar question answered in this thread on Askubuntu. I found a great solution for that by adding a plugin for oh-my-zsh shell that I switched to from bash.\n", "Q: What's the fastest charging power adapter for an iPhone 7 Plus? With my previous iPhone 6 Plus, it was recommended that I use a 12W adapter and I found that (or at least convinced myself that) the phone charged faster with the 12W than with the 5W. However my iPhone 7 Plus ships with a 5W adapter.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I charge my iPhone 7 Plus with a 12W adapter?\n\n*Will my iPhone 7 Plus charge faster with a 12W adapter?\n\n\nWhat's the fastest charging power adapter for an iPhone 7 Plus?\n\nA: For some reason, Apple often chooses not to include the best charging option with its devices. This is particularly odd with 9.7” iPads, which ship with a 10W power adapter. Those haven’t been available for sale from Apple since 2013.\nAccording to the Apple Online Store, the 12W USB Power Adapter is compatible with the iPhone 7 and 7+.\n\nBoth 4.7” and 5.5” iPhones can use up to 10W power adapters to charge faster, as measured by an ammeter and System Information.\nEither way, power is drawn by the “receiving” device, so there is no risk in using an adapter that provides more power. If the charger can provide the requested wattage, it does; otherwise, the highest power output is negotiated.\nIf you plug into a Mac’s USB port, your Mac will deliver 2.1A (10W) to iPads and to the larger iPhones (6 and above). It will deliver 500mA to WATCH and 1A to smaller iPhones (SE and lower).\nI have tested this with a 2013 iMac. It is possible that newer Macs are able to provide 2.4A to iPads.\nUpdate 2017/03/22: iPad 5 and iPad mini 4 now ship with a 12W power adapter. According to the chosen verbiage, this may be the standard going forward.\n\nWhich power adapter should I use to charge my iPad?\nThe 12.9-inch iPad Pro, 9.7-inch iPad Pro, iPad (5th generation), and\n  iPad mini 4 come with a 12W USB Power Adapter. Some previous iPad\n  models came with a 10W USB Power Adapter. If you need to purchase an\n  additional adapter, choose a 12W adapter because it can charge all\n  iPad models.\n\n\nA: I did a comparison of charging devices with my iPhone 7 Plus, see the review here: http://www.genesgreenmachine.com/comparing-usb-chargers-using-iphone-7-plus/\nWhat I found was the iPad 12 watt charger delivered about 10 watts to the iPhone 7 Plus, and there were several other chargers that produced similar wattage delivered to the iPhone 7 Plus.  I did this review more for personal reasons, as I use a pedal generator to charge my phone and wanted to know which charger put the most watts into my phone, making the most of my pedal charging time.\n\nA: You can use the 12W charger with iPhone 7 Plus. It will charge it much faster than a stock 5W charger. I have iPhone 7 Plus myself and using 12W charger all the time.\nI measured many chargers and stopped on original Apple 12W iPad charger. Works the best for me.\nYou can measure the charge on your own phone with a free app - Amperes Lite.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amperes-lite-battery-charging/id1253789580?mt=8\n\nA: iPhone 7 circuitry is able to handle the use of Qualcomm or other 2.4 amp chargers with a Lightning MFi Certified cable to charge quickly :)\nDifferences in how long it takes to charge are negligible when compared to the genuine charger and cable it ships with.\n", "Q: Apple Mail: no search results after Sierra update After a Sierra update, Apple Mail is not searching anymore, and Spotlight provides incomplete results - it does not provide a top lists e.g. searching for \"Excel\" does not show Excel or it does not provide results in Mail.

Spotlight will reindex the contents of the folder or disk.\n  \n\n\nA: Another approach is to delete Apple Mail's \"Envelope Indexes\" as suggested in this forum post:\n\nPlease delete your Envelope Indexes. For this, first you need to quit Mail, then delete any Envelope Indexes in your user Library/Mail/V2/MailData. Deleting the Envelope Indexes will force Mail to rebuild its database, and then hopefully it will search properly again. (Mail will ask you to \"import\" your messages,\" but it's just rebuilding its database.)\n\nThat was posted in 2014, and as suggested in this answer you may need to change from \"V2\" to \"V3\" or \"V4\" as appropriate given your system version:\n\nfolder name could be different depending on your backuped system, \"V2\" is for Mavericks, \"V3\" is for El Cap, \"V4\" is for Sierra\n\n", "Q: Silencing \"Your disk is almost full\" notification After upgrading to macOS Sierra, I'm getting the notification that \"Your disk is almost full.

I'm sorry if this is too trivial of a question, but this is the first time I've updated OS where my computer is loaded up with important third party apps. Am I correct in thinking that only a factory reset would remove apps (aside from deleting them individually)?\n\nA: To add to @Tetsujin 's answer as well as give it more depth, that entirely depends on the application it is and the version you currently have. Whatever version of MacOS was out when your last update was released is the version that update was made for, and the changes to MacOS from that point onward could all harm app stability or break the app entirely... or do nothing at all.\nDifferent apps have different needs, and when a part of macOS gets changed and that app needs it, the app sometimes needs updating to work consistently again. Depending on the apps needs this is more frequent on some than others. The built in Stickys app for example, or TextEdit I doubt ever need updates ever because of their simplicity. The updates that come out for them would be new functionality or eye candy.\nOn the other hand some applications are very picky in their function. Take the older version of ProTools HD as an example, which needed an $8000 processing card in your Mac Pro to run. Updates were very frequent and the app would need several updates per MacOS release, but it pushed the hardware to the limits.\n\nA: In theory, & usually in practise, simply updating your OS will preserve all data - apps, documents, emails, pictures, music, settings & prefs etc - that were there beforehand.\nA current backup is always recommended for the 1 in 1000 chance that something goes wrong.\n", "Q: How do I edit RAW in Photos on iOS 10?

I'm using the iCloud Photo library on both.\nOn my Mac, I've spent a lot of time tagging faces and have done so on many of my ~35,000 photos. However, they do not seem to sync onto the iPhone Photos app. There, I'm supposed to do the whole tagging again, which I certainly don't want to do, given all the effort.\nFrom what I've read so far, it seems that Apple has somehow not included this feature yet. Is that correct? Is there anything I can do about it?\n\nA: With their focus on privacy Apple have deliberately made the decision not to sync certain information between devices.\nThey have documented this in a Knowledge base article called Use Photos and iCloud Photo Library on multiple Mac computers.\n\nAfter you sign in, these items appear in the Photos app on all of your\n  Mac computers:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*All original photos and videos\n  \n*All folders and albums\n  \n*Smart Albums\n  \n*Keywords\n  \n*Memories\n  \n*Key photo selections\n  \n  \n  These items are available only on the Mac where you created them:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Books, cards, and calendars \n  \n*Slideshows \n  \n*Keyword shortcuts\n  \n*Unused keywords \n  \n*Last imported album (this album contains photos you most recently imported on a specific Mac)\n  \n*Names and faces in the People album\n  \n\n", "Q: Why can't I move notes from my \"On My iPhone\" to iCloud? I have an iPhone SE running iOS 9.3.3.  I use the Notes app extensively to share between my iMac running Mavericks, and my phone and iPads.\nRecently I accidentally moved 4 notes from iCloud, to the phone itself.  I thought this was trivial and I could just move the notes back, but I cannot.  There is no option to do so.\nFirst, I should say that I am running the \"new\" Notes app (the one with doodles, photos, etc.)  Second, when I go into my local folder on the phone and hit Edit, I  get the \"Move All\" option, but iCloud is not presented as an option to move to, only my local phone and a New Folder option.  There is no way presented to move the notes to iCloud, either en masse or individually.\nI have tried turning Notes off/on in iCloud, as well as signing out & back in to iCloud, without success.\nHow can I get these notes to move back to iCloud again?\n\nA: Without using a Mac or iCloud.com, I think the best way is to simply copy and paste the contents of each note into a new note that is on iCloud. Thankfully, you only have four notes, so it's not too time intensive to do.\n", "Q: Ignore App Store updates in El Capitan? In previous versions of OS X, it was possible to right click on an update in the App Store and choose an option, \"Ignore this update.\"\nIn OS X 10.11.6, nothing happens when I right click on an update in the App Store.  I do not get any menu.\nAccording to this article, system updates can be ignored, but not third party apps.\nIs there any way at all to ignore available updates in the App Store for selected third-party apps in OS X 10.11?\n\nApparently the current answer is \"no\"; however, I can hope that a workaround will someday become available, and this is the site where it should go.\n\nA: Did you miss the Easter Egg?\nFor Software Updates, right-click the description text right under the title:\n\nGot it from here: Hide Software Updates from the App Store in Mac OS X (last comment), though they say it doesn't work for Yosemite. I haven't checked if you can hide regular app updates the same way. I'll \"update\" this when one comes along.\n", "Q: iOS iMessage keyboard not popping up My keyboard on iMessage won't pop up.  Just the subject/message line is showing at the bottom.  I searched the internet for solutions and tried what was suggested: powering off/on and hard reset (sleep/wake+home).  The only thing next to try is backup and restore but that will take a long time.  Is there something else I can try first?\n\nA: I had the same problem. Turns out that my iphone was trying to connect to an Apple bluetooth keyboard. I turned off bluetooth on the iPhone and the keyboard re-appeared immediately. No need for a reset or hard boot.\n\nA: The solution that worked and is faster than powering off/on was to go to settings/general/keyboard and deleted the 3rd party keyboard I had installed.\n", "Q: What iOS camera apps produce realistic HDRs? Many HDR photos have an over-processed look with colors that are oversaturated and otherwise unrealistic, halos, excessive texture and local contrast, and so on. I don't like that.\nWhat camera apps exist on iOS that capture realistic HDR photos?\nThey can use exposure fusion, or tone-mapping, or some other algorithm, as long as the result is natural-looking. I care about the result, not the algorithm.\n\nA: I am not sure if this will stay posted since it requires a recommendation.\nI use VividHDR and have dumped my desktop program for this gem. \nIt uses 5 shots unlike my previous 3 shot and the results are amazing. A user can still make it look unrealistic with tone-mapping settings but other than that I think you should look into.\n\nApp features:\nFull resolution HDR images.\nUniversal app\nTake 3 or 5 bracketed shots or just leave it to us to decide.\nIntelligent algorithms to automatically analyze the scene and get the best exposures to capture details accurately in both highlights and shadows to deliver the best HDR image. You can get 7 stops of additional dynamic range over the regular camera.\nFast processing\nvividHDR brackets, shoots and generates your HDR. Snappy fast. All this is done at the full resolution supported by the device and is always ready for the next shot. \nPresets and styles\nControl the look and style of your HDR image. Choose from a set of presets obtained from advanced tone mapping techniques. You also have the option to change the preset immediately after capture in the auto-preview mode.\nSharp HDR images\nYou do not need a tripod to capture great HDR images. Intelligent algorithms automatically compensate for camera shake. Advanced ghost removal techniques ensure that you get sharp images even with moving objects and fluttering leaves in your scene. \nLazy HDR \nLazy HDR mode to capture now, style later. Change the presets and edit in non-destructive manner at any point of time for HDRs shot in Lazy HDR mode.\nEditing \nFine editing and post-processing controls for final touches to your HDR images.

In the window appears a message that says FileVault encrypting and a blue thermometer under which there's written counting the remaining time that keeps going back and forth. \nIs there someone that can help me to solve this problem? \nIf I try to disable FileVault, it says that I can disable once encryption process is ended.\n\nI'm upgrading from OS X El Capitain version 10.11.6. When I try to stop FileVault it says I can't disable because the encryption process in still ongoing.\n\nP.S. I don't have an engineering background, so please suggest actions what doesn't involve manipulation with code or similar. Thanks a lot!\nIt's really an interesting system: it's 2 days I don't switch off the pc hoping that the coding process finishes and it's still calculating the remaining time..... \n\nA: It may be paused... Look in diskutil cs list output for \"Conversion Progress\" near the bottom.\nConversion Progress:   Paused\n\nIf it says \"Paused\" like above then on 10.11 you can use fsck_cs to fix it. Use the Physical Volume disk id from your diskutil output (disk0s2 in this example):\nfsck_cs -y disk0s2\n\n\nA: You need to wait till the encryption progress is completed. Afterwards you can simply install macOS Sierra on your encrypted harddisk and don't need to do anything else.\n", "Q: How can I make the face recognition process continue? Right now, if I go on the People section of photos.app, a message says it has analysed x photos, while the remaining y photos will be analysed when I'm not using the app and my Mac is connected to a power source.\nWhat exatcly is meant by \"not using the app\"? Should it be open, but not the foreground application? Hidden? Closed? Can it run while the Mac is in sleeping? (I saw in the logs photoanalysisd   asking to run at priority Maintenance).\nI'm asking because it's not making the progress I would expect andI'm having trouble understanding exactly how should I leave it.\n\nA: According to this blog post Photos.app should be closed, as photoanalysisd is suspended while the application is open.\nThe explanation given in the Photos application is definitely too vague. Still, I have the same issue of not experiencing the progress that I would have expected (4.900 / 12.000 in seven days).\n\nA: I came across this issue too. However, having followed the instructions for quitting the Photos app and staying logged in I only saw small progress. HOWEVER, I soon discovered that I also had Photos set up as my screensaver, therefore as far as I can figure this violates the rule used by the OS to process the photos when not logged into to Photos. I have changed my screensaver to use the National Geographic images and now it is processing the photos a lot quicker. \n\nA: I found that by setting photos as hidden log in items and then restart the mac triggered photoanalysisd into action. \nMy setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac Mini 2014 MacOS 10.15.2 \n\n*Photo library is on an external fusion drive (SSD+HHD)\n\n*40000 photos and videos (~300GB)\n\n*put hard drive to sleep when possible off\n\n\nAfter that I find the PID in activity monitor and renice photoanalysisd and photolibraryd. I don't click on photos app after restart. Now photoanalysisd is ~130% cpu usage.\n\nA: Technically speaking, \"Photos\" uses PhotoAnalysis.framework, and this framework runs in the background if CoreDuet scheduler allows it.\nCoreDuet allows photoanalysisd to run if:\n\n*\n\n*Laptop is connected to Power source\n\n*Have more than 30% battery power\n\n*Photos app is not running\n\n*No one is working with the computer\n\nSo if you want photoanalysisd to run, you should prevent your laptop from sleep, connect it to power source, close photos app and do not touch your computer and let it process your photos when it is idle.\n", "Q: A Way to Save Desktop Layouts with Multiple Presets Anyone know if there's an app that will not just let you save window positions for multi-display setups, but also create presets for different situations?  \nFor example\nClient A (saved as a preset)\n-all windows open and size to saved positions\n-different finder windows open to specific folders and views\n-browser open to specific tabs at specific addresses\n-terminal opens up directly to desired directory\netc...\nClient B (saved as a preset)\n-same idea but maybe different programs, finder locations, etc..\nI took a look at \"Stay\" but it doesn't seem to be what I'm looking for.

For example, I am in Toronto, Canada and if I ask Siri a similar question: \n\nWhat's the latest in Toronto\n\nSiri first asks for confirmation to use a Twitter account to recommend more personalised results if you don't have one signed in or don't allow Siri access to Twitter. Siri will display a list of Tweets related to the location of Toronto. \n\n", "Q: How can I use tabs in Mac Mail? One of the new featuers in macOS Sierra are tabs in more apps, including Mail.\nHow do I use tabs in Mac Mail? Clicking \"View\", \"Show tab bar\" displays a bar with one tab, but I can't find a way to open a new tab.\n\nA: For tabs to work in all situations, you need to enable them in System Preferences->Dock (set the appropriate option to \"always\"). Afterwards, you can (in Mail) select \"File -- New window\" or press Opt-Cmd-N to create a new tab. \n\nA: If you hold down option while selecting File > New Viewer Window, a new viewer tab will be created regardless of any Dock System Preference setting.\n\nA: Not sure if your question was ever answered but all you have to do is use \"option-command-n\" to create new tabs on the tab bar\nthe other shortcut, \"command-n\" just creates a new email window. if you hit again command-n it'll create a tab inside the new email window!\nBoth commands are shown under the \"file\" menu\nHowever tabs will only open if you've selected \"use tabs when opening new docs- always\" under dock preferences (system preferences/dock)\n", "Q: How do you ask Siri to message whatsapp group? I know the new IOS allows you to ask Siri to send a whatsapp message to a person, can Siri message a whatsapp group ?\n\nA: I figured out today how to do it. \nFirst, you need to be sure that the name of the group can be easily understand by Siri. As I know from myself some group names are too complex for Siri. It will be simple if the group name is like a person's name. \nSecond, you need to add the group name to your contacts without any number etc. just create a new empty person with the group name.\n\nA: Due to SiriKit API limitation, Siri can send a message only to a sigle \"entity\", which could be a contact or an existing group but, actually, you can't write a message to multiple entities in a single action. \n", "Q: Time Machine \"waiting\" I'm looking for a file on Time Machine and it says \"waiting\". It is a file in a recent backup. Why is time Machine \"waiting\"?\n\nA: If you have entered time machine via the top toolbar, you will receive the \"Waiting\" message (as shown in the image) when trying to navigate to an older backup. This is simply because time machine is waiting to load that backup.\n\nBe patient and wait for it to load\nIf it is taking a very long time to load, visit This Link for troubleshooting\n", "Q: Car audio doesn't work in iOS 10 (\"No song\") Ever since I upgraded to iOS 10, my phone no longer works in my car (connected over Lightning to USB port). It isn't a connectivity issue (I've received \"device unsupported\" before with bad connections) because the dash shows \"No song\" rather than \"No device\", but Spotify and Siri no longer run through the audio and iOS 10's (revamped) audio controls do not function. Is this an iOS 10 bug?\n\nA: After much troubleshooting, the issue was the Music app being \"deleted\" (hidden). Even if not running the Music app—and using Spotify, Maps, etc.—the car audio does not function properly without it. Restore the app via the App Store and the car audio comes back as it was before.\n", "Q: Highlight the groups a contact is in? There is a keyboard shortcut for \"Contacts.app\" which does not appear to be documented anywhere (correct me if I'm wrong) which allows you to highlight the groups that the selected contact is part of, assuming the Groups pane is visible.\nYou just hold down the \"Option\" key.\nHowever, there is another mode that I have only ever activated by accident, where these highlights stay on.  You can click or arrow-key from one contact to another, and the highlights will change accordingly without holding down the \"Option\" key.\nThis is a really useful way to view Contacts.  Unfortunately, all my efforts to either (a) find the documentation for this, or (b) activate this mode on purpose have failed.\nI am using El Capitan, but I recall seeing the same behavior all the way back in Snow Leopard, and I couldn't figure out how to make the highlighting stay on then, either.\nHow can I make this highlighting mode stay on, to quickly and at-a-glance show which groups a particular contact belongs to?\n\nA: I think you found a bug.\nWithin All Contacts,\nif you select one contact entry,\nhold down ⌥⇧, maintain them, and select a second contact entry\nthen the highlighted group will stay on.\nFrom there, if you use the keyboard arrows, this highlighting will remain on, but won't be correct.\nMy analysis is that in this sequence of events the ⌥ key up\nisn't managed correctly.\n", "Q: Using the same Apple ID on private and business iPhone I have a private and now a company iPhone. I like to have two phones to seperate business and private.\nI need to install an app from the Apple Store on my business iPhone, so I need an Apple ID on this phone. Obviously, I already have a private one.\nCurrently, I do not sync any data with iCloud (but Google, which will not be configured on my business device), so I wonder if there is any disadvantage of using my private Apple ID on my business phone? \nMy company allows the use of a private Apple ID. In particular what I want to know, if I use my Apple ID will my company be able to influence or monitor anything on my private phone (iPhone search, etc).\n\nA: There are two separate questions here but hopefully they won’t get mixed if I’m careful about wording things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your company can install MDM profiles and unless they do, you only expose what addresses and traffic you send when you connect to their network or VPN or install their apps. Apple protects you since there are no hidden backdoors and if you have a company MDM - you will see it in the profile portion of the settings app and it has to list what it does.\n\n*You can choose to use a private AppleID in the App Store and that won’t let the business see what you do in the store other than seeing the side effects.\n\n\n*\n\n*With MDM - they can see all apps installed - so if you installed a sports betting or game - they would see that IF they have MDM or if they see that app talking to the servers that run that app.\n\n*They can send apps to your phone on iOS 11 without needing you to be signed in, so it’s up to them if you should use an AppleID or just use MDM to push the “work apps”\n\n*Work can erase the device but not get data from it with MDM in general. Unless they get your passcode or you back up to their servers, Apple ensures data is secure with your password so unless they have surveillance or a key logger on a computer and capture your password - your password and account is yours and it’s your choice to use it on a work device or not.\n\n\n\nSo - If you really want to keep work from personal - sign up for and maintain a work AppleID so you don’t mix the streams. For many people, using a personal AppleID for just the App Store is super low risk and you can manage to not auto install apps and control what app history you wish to share with work. Without MDM, they can’t modify settings, wipe the device, lock the device, unlock the device. With MDM they can do those things, but you will see they can do it and ask about their policies so you can make a good choice.\nI wouldn’t mix normal AppleID like messages or Photos or iCloud or GameCenter with work and pleasure - this answer just is about apps and access to app data. That second item could leak more data like contacts or conversations you would rather be yours.\n\nA: You're able to switch between Apple ID's on 1 phone when you want to install a particular app. Just keep in mind what Apple ID your currently using when installing new apps.\n", "Q: How to switch between Today and Notifications tabs in Notification Center on macOS Sierra? I want to be able to switch between the tabs (Today and Notifications tabs) in Notification Center using a keyboard shortcut. Any way of doing it on macOS Sierra?\nI know it was possible on Yosemite, but I never had Yosemite so I couldn't verify that.\nEdit: I want to be able to run an apple script, not use a keyboard shortcut. Using the apple script I can then place it in a third-party program to get my results.\nAlso, the code below worked partially. For starters, is it possible to place an if/else at the beginning so it works like this:\nif Notification Center is already opened, then move onto the next thing (which would be switching between the Today and Notification buttons) but if it is not open then open it and switch the buttons.\n\nA: I did a little googling and couldn't find a native keyboard shortcut other then to just open Notification Center, to whatever view it was last on, and this has to be User set in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Mission Control > Show Notification Center. This of course just open Notification Center to whatever view it was last on.\nHowever if you go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts, there is \"Full Keyboard Access: In windows and dialogs, press Tab to move keyboard focus between:\" and two radio buttons, \"Text boxes and lists only\" (the default) and \"All controls\". If you select \"All controls\", then you might be able to use, e.g. tab, enter, arrow keys to navigate the Notification Center. I'm not able to test that at the moment and why I said \"... might be able to use ...\".\nThat leaves an AppleScript workaround to be used in either a third-part app that can use the script assigning a keyboard shortcut or an Automator service that a keyboard shortcut could be assigned to.\nThe AppleScript code below toggles the state of the two buttons in Notification Center.\ntry\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell process \"SystemUIServer\"\n            click menu bar item \"Notification Center\" of menu bar 1\n        end tell\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            tell process \"Notification Center\"\n                if value of radio button \"Today\" of radio group 1 of window \"NotificationTableWindow\" is equal to 1 then\n                    click radio button \"Notifications\" of radio group 1 of window \"NotificationTableWindow\"\n                else\n                    click radio button \"Today\" of radio group 1 of window \"NotificationTableWindow\"\n                end if\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend try\n\nYou can also modify the code to just act on just a given button if you want.

Yes.  Why wouldn't you be able to?\nThe AirPort Extreme is just like any other WiFi router in as much it is a router, a switch, and a WAP (Wireless Access Point) like any other wireless router.\nThe Sony speakers are just like any other WiFi speakers in as much they are clients on a WiFi network.\nThe real question here is does iOS support streaming to multiple AirPlay speakers simultaneously?\nCurrently, the answer is NO.

I want to upgrade the hard drive in my iMac (21.5\" Mid 2011) from 1TB to 3TB.\nOWC sell an \"in-line digital thermal sensor\".  They describe the need for this:\n\nUnlike Prior Generations, Apple iMacs from late 2009 to current 2015 & later utilize digital reporting and even custom firmware for SMC drive temperature reporting. OWC's Exclusive HDD Kits include our custom digital monitor that 'talks Apple SMC' and maintains proper temperature reporting and Apple Diagnostic compatibility allowing you to upgrade an existing 3.5\" HDD with any 3.5\" SATA HDD of your choice up to 8.0TB\n\nBelow is a picture of the sensor, which they sell here:\n\nGiven this \"talks to the Apple SMC\", I was expecting it to be connected to the SATA data connector.\nBut oddly, it isn't: it fits \"in-line\" to the SATA power connector.  (The two connectors on this assembly plug into the existing power connector in the iMac, and into the power connector on the hard drive... see OWC's video starting at about 4:13 for instructions.)\nI've looked at the Wikipedia description of SATA power connectors but don't see any mention of this kind of signalling.

In OS X 10.11.6, I want to use a line of file paths output from terminal as input to another command. Right now, when I triple click on a line, the line gets selected, but with trailing whitespaces including a new line - this makes it hard to use that path in a command. Here is an example session that illustrates the problem:\n~/testdir : ls -1 # there is a single file called \"foo bar\" \nfoo bar\n# I selected the above output line with a triple click. \n# This selected the line including newline at the end. \n# I copy this to clipboard (Cmd-c). \n# I then call wc below, with an open quote.\n# I paste the output(Cmd-v)\n# I close the quote in the next line. \n# This gives an error as shown below\n~/testdir : wc \"foo bar\n> \"\nwc: foo bar\n: open: No such file or directory\n# Now I use up arrow to recall last line, and delete the whitespace before closing quote\n# This works fine\n~/testdir : wc \"foo bar\"\n       1       2      12 foo bar\n\nHow do I avoid this duplicate effort each time - i.e, how do I select the line without whitespaces, so only foo bar gets selected?\n\nA: When a line in Terminal contains whitespace there is no method, that I know of, which involves just clicking to highlight the line sans the newline character.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can single-click at the start of the line (or any inception point) you want to copy then press and hold the shift key and single-click the last word, or character, of the line you want copied.

I guess my problem was related with capturing the new basestation, after going over the setup of the second Basestation and rebooting everything works now! I corrected also some certification related problems. I used the excellent Admin Tool Radius to set alt up correctly, an incorrect setting might have been the cause of my troubles!\n1) I would like to know what kind of RADIUS support does Server App provide?\nIt appears to provide full support.\n2) Since adding a second Airport basestation does not work, I guess I will have to configure a RADIUS server outside of Server App, probably following this video: https://vimeo.com/53774350?\nStill excellent tutorial, slightly outdated in macOS Sierra.\n3) What happens to the Server App's Airport Basestation configuration I had active for the first Basestation? Can I still configure Services and mapping from Server App?\nIt works in our case\n4) Should I just keep the Basestation activated in Server App, but deactivate the authentication requirement over WiFi and configure a separate RADIUS server?\nIt works in our case. No need to set up the Radiusserver again. My incomplete Radius Server was probably a certification related problem.\n5) How about certificates: Server App already has a global certificate, can i use this instead of building a new one?\nRadius will use the certificate used in the Server App. I used the excellent Admin Tool Radius to set it up.\n6) Will the access group (which is mentioned in the video) be visible in Server App?\nIf you choose \"show system accounts\" under Server>View then it should show up. But there is no need to set an access group, since RADIUS will use Opendirectory.\nSo everything is working now. As I said I just went over the single steps again, the problem I had was probably related to the Certificate or a mistake in the Client setup.\nNow I just have to figure out how to get the RADIUS logs into Console, since they do not appear there in macOS Sierra!\n", "Q: Will reinstalling OS from recovery mode preserve iTunes library? I have a Macbook Pro with a broken OS (computer was turned off during an  update and won’t boot any more).\nThe Macbook contains some user data that hasn’t been backed up in a while, including a valuable iTunes library.\nWill those data be preserved when reinstalling OS X (Yosemite) from recovery mode, or is there an easy way to get hold of it again?\n\nA: Reinstalling OS X or macOS from Recovery mode or an Installer will not delete any files. \n\nA: Yes, it should. The last time I restored an OS (El Capitan) the user data was preserved, but I would definitely recommend booting from recovery then trying to back up before restoring. Once you make the changes, if something breaks then it's too late unless you have a backup. Consider Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper! to facilitate. \n\nA: As long as you don't explicitly erase then you should be okay. You can also use target disk mode or something else to try and make a quick backup before moving forward.\n", "Q: Spotlight taking a lot of power on macOS I recently installed macOS, but I have noticed that \"Spotlight.app\" has had high CPU usage.

However, I cannot click on them to bring them to the front, so it is practically useless.\nI noticed this behavior since Sierra and wonder if this is intended behavior or just a bug.\nBonus question (Since I don't have access to macOS 10.11 or lower): Has this behavior existed before?\n\nA: i think i know what you're talking about. expose used to have this really annoying \"feature\" where it required a mouse move before it would register a click. so if i used expose and the window i wanted was right under my mouse cursor, i couldn't just click it. i had to move my mouse a little, then i could click it\nbut, i just tried reproducing this in macos sierra and the problem is gone!\n\nA: My interpretation of the question's scenario is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter App Exposé with a four-fingered downward swipe, then \n\n*Swipe left or right with three fingers to show the open windows from each of the other open apps (this works whether or not any windows are full-screened at the time). The windows on screen will not show the blue border highlight typical of Exposé on mouseover, and clicking on one of them will (in most cases) exit Exposé without changing focus to the clicked window. \n\n\nIf you reproduce this state and then perform a downward three- or four-fingered swipe, the windows will \"bob\" a little and the blue border highlight will reappear; clicking on the highlighted window will bring it to focus and exit Exposé, which I suppose is the expected behavior. (I believe this is what an earlier answer was alluding to.) The arrow keys will also cause the blue highlight to reappear and allow a window to be selected. \nMy personal opinion is that the initial lack of response to mouseovers is a bug and not intended, but I have no evidence either way. Hopefully these workarounds help, though. \n\nA: When your are in the exposé view you can\ndo a four finger swipe down, then you get a soft of visual bump effect and afterword you can select the window of a other open program. This is necessary to click on it. Maybe this was made switch faster to your former window, but it doesn't´t feel natural.\n", "Q: Wake On Lan (WOL) iMac 2009 El Capitan, Sierra, not working System:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2009) \n\n*El Capitan 10.11.6 \n\n*Non-Apple modem/router\n\n\nWake on LAN isn’t working. I have tried a variety of methods: iOS apps (Fing, iNet, Mocha); Mac applications and scripting on another Mac (WakeOnMac, wakeonlan perl script).\nYes, I’m on a local network, and yes I’ve ticked the ‘Wake for network access’ in System Preferences. Also checked with pmset -g that womp = 1. I have also tried overriding networkoversleep (1).\nI initially believed the Ethernet (which directly connects the iMac to the router and should make this process more reliable) disconnected during sleep. I tested this by opening System Preferences > Network and leaving that open while I sleep it. When I woke it from sleep, the Network Preferences panel was still open (obviously) and Ethernet (at the top) showed as Disconnected and features a red dot beside it. It reconnects very quickly, but that’s no good for WOL.\nI have now tested installs of Mavericks, Yosemite and macOS Sierra on a separate partition. Mavericks and Yosemite both allowed WOL (despite the Ethernet 'disconnecting' issue still being there, suggesting it doesn't actually disconnect). macOS Sierra, as El Capitan, does not allow WOL. The pmset settings and 'Wake for network access' etc. are all the same.\nDoes anybody know of an obscure network setting somewhere that disables WOL despite it being enabled in pmset?\n\nA: Wake on Lan only works if the Mac is sleeping. You cannot wake up a Mac that has been shutdown no matter what third party apps you have. Mac's are not designed to Wake-up from LAN when shutdown for security reasons.\n", "Q: re-enable mouse scroll inertia in Sierra In previous versions of macOS (OSX), when I scrolled fast, the page woule keep sliding a bit, as if there was some inertia keeping it moving.

When I click to dismiss a notification dialog box in OS X Yosemite, it doesn't disappear immediately: it makes a kind of puff-of-smoke animation before it disappears. When you have more than one notification on the screen and click to dismiss the first one, not only does OS X do the puff-of-smoke animation but it also does a sliding animation to move the next notification box up to the top of the list. All of this takes time, which is not only annoying, but a real waste of time when you have to dismiss many notifications on the screen.\nIs there a way to shorten the duration of those animations, or better yet, dismiss all visible notifications in one step?\n\nA: You can dismiss all visible notifications by opening Notification Center and clearing notifications using the X at the top-right of the notification list.\nObviously this will remove all notifications for that particular date, so if you have others you want to save, this won't work. This is, however, the only way I am aware of to dismiss notifications en masse.\nI'm also not aware of any way to remove the animations you mentioned.\n", "Q: Is iPad Pro's GPS supposed to be not as accurate as iPhone's GPS? I have an iPad Pro, and noticed that its GPS will tell the location off by about 100 feet to 150 feet. Sometimes it says it cannot find any GPS signal, when the iPhone 6 has no issue at all.\nThe spec page of iPad Pro says that it has \nAssisted GPS and GLONASS\n\nat first I thought the aGPS is not as accurate as regular GPS, but then, it is the same specs as for iPhone 6 or iPhone 7.\nSo can it be fixed by software or will it require a hardware fix?\n(if the GPS is to find a cafe or restaurant, it is no problem.  But when playing Pokemon Go, it is annoying to be not at the exact location -- except one advantage is that you can scan an area slightly off to the real location, so it is like you can scan 2 areas at the same time if you use both the iPad Pro and the iPhone).\n\nA: WiFi-only iPads do not include a GPS receiver; only the Wi-Fi + Cellular models do. That is why at times you can’t even get a GPS signal at all.\nBut when there are Wi-Fi signals around or when you have an Internet connection, your iPad can use that to figure out its location.\nYou don’t need a cellular signal in order to get a GPS lock. I’ve gone on plenty of hikes in the boonies with no cell signal, and ended up with a perfect map. The “assisted” part of \"Assisted GPS” only uses cell tower triangulation to acquire a quicker GPS lock.\nI don’t see a reason why Apple would disable the GPS radio unless you activated the iPad on a carrier network, so you should be able to use GPS on an iPad + cellular without a data plan.\n", "Q: Drag and drop so slow? I've had my MacBook Pro for around half a year. Before I used Windows all my life. The problem I'm having with my MacBook Pro is that it's very very very slow when I try to drag a file into a program when compared to Windows.\nFor example, I have a .jpg image on my desktop. I'm on my desktop and I drag the file into my Chrome or Firefox browser I can upload it to Imgur or something. While I drag the file from the desktop to the program on the dock, it blinks a few times... it then opens the program and sometimes I have to hold the file into the program.\nAll this is much faster in Windows. Is there a way for me to do this faster? I'm even willing to install a program to speed this up. Thanks everyone!\n\nA: When you drag onto an application on the Dock or an unopened folder in Finder, the operating system isn't sure if you just intend to drag-and-drop, or if you want to place the dragged item in a specific place once the folder or application is opened.\nIn an application like a web browser, where a window can have multiple tabs, the application doesn't know which tab you're trying to send the item to, or if you want to open a new tab with that item to view it, or ...\nIf you drag-and-hold over an application or unopened folder, after a few seconds the application or folder will open (or un-minimize). This is called spring-loaded folders. There's no way to disable this. In the case of folders, you can continue to open subfolders in this manner until you find the location you want.\nIn the case of some applications, you can change what happens with the dragged item.\nIn Chrome, for example, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*drag onto the tab bar to open a new tab with that item for viewing\n\n*drag onto the Bookmark Toolbar to create a bookmark to it\n\n*drag into the address bar to open that item in the current tab\n\n*drag onto a target in the loaded tab (such as your Imgur example)\n\n*drag onto another tab in the tab bar to bring that tab to the front, and then into the address bar or a target location on the page loaded in that tab\n\n\nTo answer your direct question: Having the application window or folder open somewhere on your desktop (even if it's on a different monitor that's hooked up to your computer) will allow you to drag directly into the open application window and drop it immediately without delay.\nSimilarly if, somewhere on the screen, you can see the icon of a closed folder that you want to drag an item into, you can let go as soon as your mouse cursor is over the closed folder and it will drop the item into that folder without delay or opening it.\n", "Q: python script to create a desktop icon Right now I'am using npm start to open a desktop app (i.e nodejs server) which uses electron framework.\nSo when ever I want to open that desktop app I have to open the terminal, go the application directory and use command \"npm start\" to open the nodejs server i.e desktop app.\nI want to write a python scrip to create a desktop app, and when ever I double click that desktop icon, it should internally uses 'npm start' command to open that desktop app.  \nCan any one please help me, and my application directory is as:\n/Desktop/Electron/charityapp.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*cd ~/Desktop\n\n*echo '#!/bin/sh' > run-my-app\n\n*echo 'cd ~/Desktop/Electron/charityapp' >> run-my-app\n\n*echo 'npm start' >> run-my-app\n\n*chmod +x run-my-app\nThen just double-click on the icon on the Desktop\n\nA: Just an addition to the other answer:\nif you wouldn't like to see a terminal window opening up each time you double click the bash script file you could create an Automator bundle.\n\n\n*\n\n*After opening my favorite option are create an application or a\nservice (you can later bind a shortcut to this)\n\n*Then select, Library → Utilities and double click on Run Shell Script\n\n*From there, in a couple of my previous I used this setting Services recives: no input    in: any applications\n\n*In the Shell option you can choose /bin/bash instead of the in-script #!/bin/sh and then add the lines of scripts:\ncd ~/Desktop/Electron/charityapp     \nnpm start\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You could even choose python script here, but in this case I don't know how to help you.\n\n*For a shortcut after saving the you-service-name can be seen in\nSystem Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Services. \n\nA: Open textedit & paste it: \n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport os\n\ndef main():\n    os.system(\"npm start\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\nSave it, remove its extension (using Finder is okay) & run\nchmod +x /Users/ankii/Desktop/testapp\n\nPython script executable opened by text editor\n", "Q: How do I clear the purgeable area on my disk? I cleared space on my disk by deleting files and emptying trash. But, I am unable to make use of the space that I freed up. That is, as you can see the disk reports 142 GB as Available with 83 GB of that as purgeable.\n\nSo I should have plenty of space to to copy over a 70 GB file onto the disk. Yet when I try I get an error stating \"Not enough disk space to copy\", like the following image shows:\n\nHow do I clear out the purgeable space to make it truly available for use?\nI've tried rebooting in the hopes that a restart clears out the purgeable area, but had no change trying that.\n\nA: I was able to cause the purgeable area to get cleared by copying over temporary smaller files which eventually caused the purgeable space to be cleared. Once the large purgeable area was cleared then I could delete the temporary smaller files and copy the large one that I intended.\nNote, that deleting the smaller temporary files caused my purgeable area to grow again, fortunately it grew small enough that I could copy the large file over. Hopefully Apple refines this over time. \n\nA: You can create a huge file that will force macOS to clean purgeable files to free you space. Do do so, type this command in a terminal:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=~/hugefile bs=15m\n\nIt will create a file called hugefile in your home folder, which you can check the size with Get Info and stop when it's big enough for you, using ControlC. Or you can simply let it run until you are out of space in the disk and things start to stop working.\nThis command takes a long time to allocate the memory, you can also stop it when it's 5~10GB and duplicate the file CommandD to create copies and speed up the process.\nThen, you just need to delete the files, obviously.\nIn your case, you already have the file you want to copy, so you could split it into 50 GB chunks and copy one chunk over. Then let the system purge files and repeat. Once you have all the data over, you can combine them - adding the second file to the first, deleting the second file, etc...\n\n\n*\n\n*How to merge files after using split command from terminal?\nThe main problem is that “purgeable” space is not one monolithic item - it is potentially local time machine or filesystem snapshots, cached data, derived data, iCloud photos at full resolution that will be downsampled as you start to get closer to no free space available.\nThe system will self correct if you can bring the data over in two pieces in your case, or in n-pieces in the general case.\n\nA: There seems to currently be no way of getting a list of what the OS considers purgeable files in order to delete them, but there are some candidates to consider, such as cached files.\nThis particular file can grow quite large, and once removed reduces the purgeable data size;\n/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.coresymbolicationd/data\n\nTo get an idea of the size of the file, you can run ls as the sudo user;\nsudo ls -la /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.coresymbolicationd/data\n\nA search for the file provides a few links to queries on its size, such as this Q&A here.\nDetails on the file itself are scarce, but it seems related to symbol lookup for crashed and problematic processes; as is evidence in this linked Q&A, with more information this post. Follow on the Q&A linked above, it does seem safe enough to delete, this file.\nRemoval of the file would need to be done with sudo, details are provided in the Q&A post. The gist of it is to move (as sudo) the file to somewhere in your home directory (e.g. ~/Documents/SymbolDataDelete), reboot the machine and then delete the file.\nNote: the symbol file will be created again, this appears to be normal, but you should be able to better manage the size it consumes if it becomes too large.\nWarning: using sudo can be dangerous... use with care.\nOn the expected results; I don't anticipate that this single file will be the sole contributor to the purgeable data (assuming the cloud drive is off etc.), but it did clean up about 95% of the purgeable data I had.\nGeneral observations\nIt may seem obvious, but a reboot cleans out a lot of the temporary and cached content. Give it a few minutes after the restart. Personal observations have been that after a couple of weeks, a reboot cleans up in the order of a gig of purgeable space...\n\nA: If time machine is the taking the space, than using tmutil can help.\nList of snapshots can be checked using:\ntmutil listlocalsnapshots /\n\nAnd cleanup upto 100GiB using:\ntmutil thinlocalsnapshots / $((100 * 1024 * 1204 * 1024)) 4\n\nLast two arguments are:\n\n*\n\n*amount of space to try to reclaim (using $(( )) to calculate 100 GiB)\n\n*urgency, 1 is default, 4 is highest (didn't find better description)\n\nThere is a mention of tmutil in a comment, but not of thinlocalsnapshots.\n\nA: Another option to flush purgeable disk space is to manually create empty disk images, either from Disk Utility (with Cmd+N) or from the terminal, like this:\n$ hdiutil create -size 25g empty.dmg\ncreated: /Users/enekoalonso/empty.dmg\n\nThis command takes a few seconds, using the default image parameters.\nAs a note, we cannot create an image larger than the free space available, but using a value close to that will trigger macOS to release a good amount of purgeable space.\nThis process can easily be repeated as needed, until almost all purgeable space has been released.\n\nA: Final step which worked (using Catalina 10.15.7 on an iMac with an APFS formatted Fusion Drive)\n\n*\n\n*Confirm that a recent backup is available for the system before proceeding to reduce the risk of losing data.\n\n*Boot to recovery mode and reinstall the Operating System.

If I decide to cancel iTunes Match for a bit and then resubscribe do I go through the whole 'match' process for my music again?\n\nA: I actually wrote an article on this.

How do I do this? I can find no information about how this maybe done.\n\nA: If you have a Mac you can connect your iPad to, it's fairly straightforward to record the iPad's video output in Quicktime -- although you might just as well use Quicktime to screen record from the Mac's copy of FaceTime in that case.\nLast I checked, Apple still doesn't allow general-purpose screen recording apps in the app store (apps in the Games category can do it, but not elsewhere).\nThere are a few apps which claim to allow you to do screen recordings on the device without jailbreaking, but all the ones I've seen install via alternative mechanisms and so 'buyer beware', as it were. I haven't tested personally.\nEdited to add:\n@Allan To screen record your iOS device on a Mac is pretty straightforward, provided you have the necessary software versions (iOS 8 or later, macOS Yosemite/10.10 or later):\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iOS device to your Mac using a Lightning cable \n\n*Open Quicktime (player) on your Mac and from the File menu, select\n\"New Movie Recording\".\n\n*A window will appear, which will likely default to showing you the\nlive view from your webcam. Click the dropdown button by the red\nrecord button, and in the list of sources you'll see the name of your\niOS device (e.g. Derek's iPhone) listed under both the Camera and\nMicrophone sections of the input sources list. Select it in both\nplaces.\n\n*You should now see your iOS device screen mirrored on the Mac (you\nmay need to unlock your device and 'trust' the Mac if you've not\nconnected before). \n\n*Press the record button in Quicktime to get started.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra Missing App Icon in Dock and \"Check for Updates...\" Fails for Certain Apps After doing a clean install of macOS Sierra I occasionally get the 'missing app icon' (the original app icon with a question mark superimposed).

Therefore the best way to update is to download an updated copy of the app from the developer's website and manually move it to the /Applications folder.\n\nA: Close the app. Move the app from /Applications to another path and then move it back to /Applications.\nIt worked for me (the app was just Sketch.app)\n", "Q: macos Sierra Fn key acts like a long press with delay I have recently updated to macos Sierra and have a very strange thing happening with my Fn key.

If I press the delete key a second time (while holding the Fn), then it does act as expected.

I use this dozens of times a day. But I also love Safari's PiP feature. I can't use both at the same time. :(\nThe other answers here are providing solid workarounds, giving us the best options available in place of Safari's PiP feature, but just in case anybody's confused, they do not actually utilize the native macOS PiP functionality. They are all different tools trying to imitate Safari's feature.\nFurther, Chrome's deployment of a PiP feature is not based on the native macOS functionality at all (as of version 71.0.3578.98). It's a custom piece of code Chrome wrote to create the same kind of experience that you get in Safari, but it is severely limited in that it cannot show PiP when you're fullscreen in a different app, which is generally how I use PiP. You have to be in the Chrome window that has that particular tab that you're pulling the video from. You can do this in fullscreen, so long as you stay in that Chrome window. The only way to be working in another app and have the Chrome PiP visible is to have both the Chrome window and the other app's window sitting on the desktop. You cannot go into fullscreen mode.\nSorry – I know that's verbose, but it's kind of a convoluted issue.\nHope that helps someone!\n\nA: Chrome 69 now natively supports PiP here.\n\nA: Picture in Picture for macOS: https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/picture-in-picture-floating/id1099477261\n\nA: For Chrome and Firefox you need to install a plugin which you can find by search on the store.\nChrome\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/picture-in-picture-viewer/efaagmolahogmekmnmkigonhfcdiemnl\nFirefox\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/pip-picture-in-picture-video-f/\n\nA: Update : there is a new nice official google extension for PIP in Chrome : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/picture-in-picture-extens/hkgfoiooedgoejojocmhlaklaeopbecg\nPersonally, I am using both : the Helium extension for its transparent feature and the Google extension for its speed.\n", "Q: Google Chrome shuts down when my MacBook Air goes to sleep No error messages come up and upon initiating Google Chrome again, it goes to my homepage.

The description says, \"this version of OS X El Capitan is for users running OS X Snow Leopard who would like to upgrade to macOS Sierra.\"\n\n*I clicked the download button. This finished up as an application, /Applications/Install OS X El Capitan.app. However, I did not have OS X El Capitan in my app store purchase history. (Clarification: after the second download started, I did have an \"OS X El Capitan\" entry in my purchase history on the Snow Leopard computer.)\n\n*Copied the macOS Sierra and El Capitan installers to my file server.\n\n*On my current Mac, copied Install OS X El Capitan.app to my /Applications directory. \n\n*Ran the Install OS X El Capitan app. It ran as expected, and I had Mac OS X 10.11 on my current Mac.  So far (6 hours) it appears to be doing well.\n\nA: It depends on your circumstances. It can be difficult to find old OS downloads.\nIf you purchased it previously it will be in the App Store under the Purchased tab. \nIf your mac came with it pre-installed you may have to go the internet recovery or Recovery HD route, but that would entail wiping your hard drive in order to do the install. You could then migrate your user data from a Time Machine backup or similar. \nAlternatively, if you have a bootable backup of your El Cap system (assuming you had it installed) you could reinstall that. \nMore specific answers will require more specific information from you (it's generally a good idea/helpful to provide more information so that answers can be geared towards your situation and others in the same situation can benefit). \nWhatever you do, make sure you have a full working backup (which you have tested) so that you can revert should something fail. \n\nA: Contrary to what is said here (and above about past OS releases where the N-1 installer is removed soon after version N launches) Apple now has an article with links to the store and detailed requirements for getting and installing OS X El Capitan that works. (And yes, even after Sierra and High Sierra are out – and apparently now independent from previous \"purchases\" of that operating system. It is also not appearing in the purchased tab whether or not it was purchased or not.).\nApple says on https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206886 - How to download OS X El Capitan:\n\nOS X El Capitan remains available for Mac computers that can't upgrade to macOS High Sierra, or that need to upgrade to El Capitan first.\nIf you still need OS X El Capitan, use this App Store link: Get El Capitan. To download it, your Mac must be using macOS High Sierra or earlier.\n\nThe direct link to the App Store is (currently) here.\nCurrent advice here on this site seems to use the help article HT206886 to check for an updated link if the Mac App Store one fails you.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1147835434?ls=1&mt=12\nGiven the information in the question, the information Apple provides means currently that on Sierra and High Sierra accessing the link given will provide you the opportunity to download the El Capitan installer from the App Store.\nThe fact that this currently gives the error \"not possible because your current system is newer\" can only mean three things: 1. that there is a bug in recent versions of the App Store on Sierra or High Sierra, 2. that this policy has changed recently but the KB article doesn't reflect that change 3. that Apple simply lies on the above page which is quoted accurately here.\nAs memory tempts me to remember that I did download El Capitan from a newer system, it seems options 1+2 are more likely.\nHowever, this does not apply to the conditions listed in the question by OP above.\n\nA: I am not allowed to comment yet, I cannot even up-vote, so I will reiterate Pwdr's first solution - \"If you purchased it previously it will be in the App Store under the Purchased tab.\" Consider this an up-vote.\nI also needed the El Capitan installer, and based on Pwdr's answer, I went to my App Store Purchased tab and found the installers for El Capitan, Mavericks, and Mountain Lion. I am downloading all of them.\nThis issue is a sore spot with me because I wanted to upgrade from Leopard to Lion years ago, but I had to first upgrade to Snow Leopard. The Apple store did not have Snow Leopard anymore, just Lion, and referred me instead to one of their \"partners\". Why does Apple expect a partner, like B.Buy, to provide better service than themselves? I ended up paying a premium at a Mac store for Snow Leopard ($50) that I used long enough to upgrade to Lion, and then to Mountain Lion.\n", "Q: RADIUS log not visible in Console under macOS Sierra We only have Radiusconfig log viewable in Console, but the Radiuslog is not visible. Although it exists under /private/var/log/radius. In older operating system versions the RADIUS log was greyed out in Console, but you could activate it and view it, in macOS Sierra it does not show up in Console.\nIs there a way to solve this?\n\nA: Most of the log info that was being redirected into custom logs (via asl) is now just going into the system log. The best way to find out about an individual service is to use the log command (man log). The radius server is radiusd, so I would expect to see useful info from:\nlog stream --predicate  '(process == \"radiusd\")' -info\n", "Q: Display Distortion on Retina Macbook Pro 2014: Is it always the LCD? I have a 15\" MBP Retina from mid' 2014. Out of the blue the bottom 2/3 of the display turned a dim grey. Randomly this part of the screen will ghost images, flash white, and return to translucent grey. I have ruled out a software issue by resetting PRAM, SMC, and booting it into Windows.\nMy question is this: What possible parts could be causing this?\n\n(On a possibly related note... I noticed under About This Mac > Serial Number: Unavailible)\n\nA: Combined with the lack of a serial number I'm thinking hardware damage. Possibly liquid spill or drop damage. Any pictures of the logic board?\n\nA: It’s either your display or your GPU. There are a few ways simple ways you can isolate the issue on your own. \n1)   The next time it occurs, take a screen shot using the key combination shift+command+3. If the same distortion appears on your screenshot, then the problem is with your graphics processor and you to get your logic board replaced. If the distortion does not appear on the screenshot, then the issue is with your display and you need to get your display replaced. \n2)   Connect your machine to an external monitor (via HDMI or display port) - if you see the same problems occurring on the external display, then it’s your GPU. If not, then it’s your MBP display. \nIt’s also worth running Apple Diagnostics to see if any issue is detected. Hold D at the startup chime to run it. Just be aware that it’s prone to false negatives since it’s 1) running a test on itself and 2) not every component is tested. See the reference codes here. \nUnfortunately, the bottom line is that this is indicative of a hardware issue. You’ll still need to bring the machine in for servicing after you isolate the problem. If you purchased AppleCare with the machine, you’re still in the three year window though. Best of luck. \n", "Q: iOS 10 stuck on approve this iPhone from another one of your devices I have a MacBook Pro with El Capitan 10.11.6 signed in to iCloud.

This application has been written in Python and transformed into a Mac application using Pyinstaller . It is hence not a 'native' Mac app. \nThe *.pkg instalation process should copy the MyApp.app into ~/Applications/MyApp and the related database into ~/Library/Application Support/MyApp/MyAppDB.sqlite3\nFor this purpose I've used Packages, however the program seems no to copy the db into the ~/Library/Application Support/ folder since no new folders or files are created there after the installation process, only the ~/Applications/MyApp folder is correctly created where the app gets copied.\nWithout the database the program crashes. I've added a bash script which creates in a post-installation manner the missing folders into ~/Library/Application Support/MyApp/ and copies there the MyAppDB.sqlite3 file. Unfortunately the file has only read persmissions and I cannot change that. \nHence my question: \n\n\n*\n\n*any expierience with Packages and how to sucessfully add files to other folder \nthan ~/Applications ? Maybe I'm doing something wrong... ? \n\n\nMany thanks in advance for your help!\n\nA: Check the Installer Log\nHave you checked the Installer log file, /var/log/install.log, for errors or problems? Maybe the package is working but not installing where you expect.\nA Better Approach\nAs Mark comments in your other question, try to avoid needing to install files in multiple locations.\nApple's developer tools for creating packages are:\n\n\n*\n\n*pkgbuild\n\n*productbuild\nQuick Fix using pkgbuild\nTry the following approach for a quick fix. Note this installs to /Applications and not ~/Applications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Prepare the files for packaging:\n~/installer/\n~/installer/Applications/\n~/installer/Applications/YourApp.app\n~/installer/Library/\n~/installer/Library/Application Support/\n~/installer/Library/Application Support/YourApp/\n~/installer/Library/Application Support/YourApp/MyAppDB.sqlite3\n\n\n*Create the package with pkgbuild using a command like:\npkgbuild --root ~/installer/ --install-location / ~/Desktop/MyApp.pkg\n\nAvoid this approach! Why?\nThis approach is not recommended because the install-location is root /. A robust installer will never install directly to root.\nProblems include, what if the package's Applications, Library, or Application Support permissions differ from the user's permissions or ownership? What happens if the user has symlinked one or more of these files?\nInstead a distribution package containing two standard packages should be used. One standard package will have an install-location of /Applications and the other with /Library/Application Support. This approach tells the installer tool to handle all the ownership, permissions, and symlink problems for you.\nIdeal Approach\nIdeally, a Mac application will be distributed as a self contained application bundle. If the MyAppDB.sqlite3 needs to be modified, a well behaved Mac application should copy a default database file from within the application bundle to the appropriate Application Support folder and use the copy as needed.\nBe aware that if your application is sandboxed, the Application Support folder at /Library/Application Support/ will not be visible to the application. The application will be given its own, contained, support folder. This means that installing a database to /Library/Application Support/ will not behave as you expect.\nIf you can bundle everything in to the application, then a single call to productbuild will create a safe ready-to-distribute outside the Mac App Store installer package. Better yet, you could avoid an installer package entirely and distribute via a disk image or zip file.\n", "Q: How can I disconnect my Internet connection and still be connected to my TimeCapsule? How can I disconnect my Internet connection and still be connected to my TimeCapsule?\nThe only way I know of to disconnect Internet is to turn off my Wi-Fi, but I then I cannot reach my TimeCapsule, and that's what I still want to do.\nThanks!\n\nA: Yes, this is possible. \nConfigure the Time Capsule to \"create a wireless network\", name the network and set up a password for the network.\nWhen doing this, ignore the error messages about having no Ethernet cable connected to the WAN port on the Time Capsule and/or not having an internet connection.\nOf course you'll need to connect your Mac to this WiFi network for backing up.\nHope this helps!\n[EDIT]\nThis edit provides the actual steps for creating a wireless network from the Time Capsule.\n\n\n*\n\n*In most cases you would usually connect your DSL/Cable modem to your Time Capsule using the ethernet WAN port. However, in your case you won't need to do this since you're not wanting the internet.\n\n*Open Airport Utility (usually located in the Utilities folder of macOS). Or, if you happen to be on a Windows machine you would usually go to Start > All Programs > AirPort\n\n*Follow the instructions on the screen for creating a new wireless network.\n\n\nNOTES\n\n\n*\n\n*I've made the assumption you're still wanting to backup wirelessly - but you do also have the option of connecting the computer directly via ethernet cable. This would involve different steps.\n\n*Different versions of Airport Utility provide different options, so if my steps don't make sense please provide the version of OS you're running as well as the version of Airport Utility.\n\n*If you have problems, it may be worth returning your Time Capsule to factory settings - use something pointy to press and hold the Reset button for about 5 or so seconds (you'll know when as the status light starts flashing).\n\n*If you get stuck, you can also visit Apple's Airport page which will provide additional info, including access to manuals etc.\n\n\nLet me know how you go.\n", "Q: How to downgrade from El Capitan to Snow Leopard? I am not happy with El Capitan, and it is also not compatible with both music hardware and software that I have, so I want to go back to Snow Leopard on my late 2009 iMac.\nAfter installing El Capitan the CD drive on my iMac is not working, and I was unable to install Snow Leopard from it.\nSo I made a bootable USB that gets recognized when I hold option when the machine is booting. When I choose it, I get the white screen with the Apple logo, but it doesn't go into the installation phase. I have formatted my drive and no longer have El Capitan on it.\nHow can I install Snow Leopard? It looks to me(and I'm hopefully wrong about this) like El Capitan has blocked the option to downgrade to an earlier OS, and it is a bit infuriating that I am not in control of hardware that I have spent a lot of money on.\n\nA: As Monomeeth pointed out, a firmware update which requires 10.6.3 might have prevented me from installing from the CD and bootable USB.\nI was able to get an image of 10.6.8 and restore it to my hard drive, and I am now finally running Snow Leopard! \n\nA: I am adding this as an 'answer' to provide more context as to what solved the OP's issue (and to save others from reading through the comments history). Hopefully this will help someone else in a similar situation.\nIn the OP's case he has a late 2009 iMac which previously had Snow Leopard (10.6.x) installed. He updated to El Capitan (10.11.x) and found this was incompatible with his music hardware and software. The OP then needed to go back to Snow Leopard and despite having both a Snow Leopard installation disc and a bootable USB installer, he was unable to install Snow Leopard.\nThe key bit of information that was missing in the original question was that the OP's iMac was one of the quad core models. These were options for the 27\" model only and both variants (i.e. the i5 and i7 versions) had a firmware update. Because of the OP's music requirements I had no doubt he would have installed this update (and in fact Apple recommended that all users install it).\nHowever, this prevented the OP from installing Snow Leopard because the firmware update itself requires as a minimum Snow Leopard (10.6.3). The installers the OP was trying to use were obviously for 10.6.2 or earlier.\nSummary\nIf you have a quad core i5 or i7 (late 2009) iMac and can't reinstall Snow Leopard, ensure that the version of Snow Leopard is either 10.6.3 or above.\n\nA: Solving a problem to install Final cut studio in Snow Leopard. I also had a BIG problem and hopefully this will help.\n\n\n*\n\n*Partition your drive in El Capitan, find out how on YouTube.\n\n*Try to buy or find a Leopard install disk. El Capitan will read it OK. \n\n*Once you selected the partition where you want to install Leopard proceed to the installer.\n\n*Restart and again repeat selecting the same partition of Leopard, then you can install Snow Leopard and it will work.\n\n*Now with your drive having 2 partitions, when starting your computer simply press the alt (arrow) key and select either El Capitan or Snow Leopard to boot.\nHope this will help anyone facing the same problem I faced.\n", "Q: How to select a paragraph using 3D Touch On my iPhone 7 using iOS 10, I can hard press on the keyboard to move the cursor around. I've noticed on a few occasions that, instead of moving the cursor around, hard pressing on the keyboard will select a paragraph of text. However, I haven't figured out what aspect of hard pressing on the keyboard triggers a paragraph to be selected.\nSo my question is: how can I select a paragraph of text using by hard pressing on the keyboard and using 3D Touch?\n\nA: When you use 3D Touch, there are two levels of pressure that it can detect. In order to use the keyboard as a trackpad (to control the cursor position) you only need to press to the first level of pressure. This is important because the \"deeper\" or second level of pressure is what enables selecting text.\nOnce you have control of the cursor, move it so that you are in the middle of a word (if you weren't already). Then \"click\" harder on the screen and the current word will be selected. Drag the cursor around to select additional words.\nTo select an entire paragraph, after getting control of the cursor, you need to \"triple click\" just as you would on a real trackpad or with a computer mouse. The difference is the \"clicks\" are hard presses on the screen.\n", "Q: macOS Sierra scrolling behavior in Terminal is really weird After upgrading to macOS Sierra, one of the things that bugs me is the altered scrolling behavior in Terminal, using the Trackpad.\nSee screencast here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUWO6-oOLoA\nWhen scrolling using the Trackpad (second part of the video), the scrolling is very sensitive and jittery. There's no way to scroll just one line of text for instance.\nAny insight into this behavior, or way to revert to the previous one?\n\nA: This has been bothering me all during the Sierra betas and I couldn't get anyone to address it.\nThe issue is that there's a minimum scrolling speed now. You can really see it if you use inertia scrolling. You let go and it slows down but then when it gets to a certain speed, it never goes slower than that. And then it stops abruptly at the same time it would have if it had been slowing down normally.\nWhat you're seeing is a side-effect of this.

Why/how? The permanent ipv6 address of my machines changed with the advent of macOS Sierra.\nNote that we're not talking about the privacy enhanced temporary addresses. What I'm talking about happens even with \"sysctl -w net.inet6.ip6.use_tempaddr=0\" in effect.\nThe difference is that ifconfig shows a \"secured\" flag on the end of both the link-local and prefix-assigned addresses on Ethernet and WiFi interfaces. The host portion of the address differs from what the EUI-64 expansion of the host MAC address ostensibly would be. Additionally, the 0x2 bit of the top byte of the host portion is zero, which indicates that it's a \"non-unique\" address, though the addresses do seem to remain consistent across reboots.\nMy guess is that Apple is constructing the host portion of the link-local address by running the EUI-64 through a cryptographic hash function or something like that.\nIs this new addition to sierra documented anywhere? Can it be turned on or off?\n\nA: There hasn't been any documentation made available for this feature (so no information on how the addresses are generated), which is indeed new in Sierra, nor can it be disabled. Apple announced this feature at WWDC 2016.\nEssentially Apple is generating IPv6 addresses that are unrelated to the MAC address in order to prevent tracking of users based on MAC addresses assigned to Apple. The link-local address is generated once and does not change (since there's less privacy concern in local-only communication), whereas the non-temporary address will change when connecting to a new network.\n", "Q: How can I use AppleScript to type text into a new window? I'm trying to make an applescript that will write itself into a new window of Applescript Editor. But I can't figure out how it will paste itself with quotations. The code I have right now is \ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke \"n\" using command down\n    keystroke \"tell application (System Events) keystroke (n) using command down end tell\"\nend tell\n\n\nA: Quotes that are meant to be literal need to be escaped with a backslash and instead of using keystroke, use the following example to create a new AppleScript document containing the wanted code:\ntell application \"AppleScript Editor\"\n    set text of (make new document) to \"tell application \\\"System Events\\\"\\n\\tkeystroke \\\"n\\\" using command down\\nend tell\"\nend tell\n\nCopy and paste the code example above into a new AppleScript document and press the Compile button.  It will then look like:\ntell application \"AppleScript Editor\"\n    set text of (make new document) to \"tell application \\\"System Events\\\"\n    keystroke \\\"n\\\" using command down\nend tell\"\nend tell\n\nThen press the Run button and it will create a new AppleScript document containing the following:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke \"n\" using command down\nend tell\n\nWhich if you then press the Run button of this new document, it creates a new blank AppleScript document.\nNote: Depending on the version of OS X/macOS the tell application \"AppleScript Editor\" line may be tell application \"Script Editor\".  You can still paste the example code, as is, into Script Editor and is will automatically remove the Apple portion from AppleScript to show as tell application \"Script Editor\".\n\nA: You are probably looking for an AppleScript quine.

I just upgraded to iOS 10 on my iPhone 5. Besides slowing down my phone greatly, the messages app has gotten cluttered with useless features. One of these is that each contact's photo now shows up at the top of the screen when I am messaging them. Besides the fact that: 1. most of my contacts don't have photos (so I just see giant initials), and that 2. the photos are too small to distinguish anything for the contacts I have that DO have photos, I have a problem with how much space these photos take up on the screen. There's just not enough screen real estate to justify showing me 2 less lines of messages in order to show me giant bubble initials or a microscopic static image of someone.\nSo, how do I remove contact photos from messages in iOS 10?\nMessages app in iOS10:\n\nvs. iOS 9:\n\n\nA: There is no way to change the layout of the Messages app to not display photos at the top of the screen.\nIf you go to your list of conversations and then tap on one, as the screen transitions you can see the difference in the height of the navigation bar at the top that contains the photo. (The conversation list uses a standard-height navigation bar that should be identical, or within a few pixels, of the height in iOS 9.) I took screenshots and measured - it's 42 pixels. Using normal-sized text (as set in the Settings app) that's approximately one line of text.\n\n", "Q: Music app suddenly switches to speakers With the new iPhone 7 and iOS 10, I came across a problem that I ran into very rarely with the iPhone 5s/6s.\nRecently, I was sitting in the bus, when suddenly the Music app switched from headphones to speakers. It's not a pleasant way of getting attention. (I think I pressed the home button, activating Siri and then pressed it again)\nJust two days later, I plugged in my headphones and started to play music and again, it started playing using the speakers until I unplugged the headphones and plugged them back in. (This time, I didn't do anything wrong)\nBasically, I can't diagnose this issue, because it is non-deterministic and I don't see a clear pattern for this. However, from a personal perspective, I slowly develop the phobia of people in the train being annoyed because my music is on speakers without me even noticing. This information may not contribute to solving the issue, but I just wanted to point out the personal aspect that comes along with it.\n\nHardware / software used:\n\n\n*\n\n*iPhone 7\n\n*iOS 10.0.2\n\n*Headphones connected using the lightning adapter that came with the phone\n\n*The default music app\n\n*No jailbreaks or any other modification\n\n\nA: This sounds like a serious issue with the iPhone 7 lightning-to-audio adapter. \nYou're going to have to diagnose the issue:\nTry buying a new adapter to see if that fixes the issue, and also try using the native lightning earpods to see if those consistently work right. If a new adapter fixes it or if the issue can't be reproduced while listening with lightning earpods, it's the audio adapter's fault. If the issue isn't fixed by the new adapter but is fixed with the lightning earpods, you probably have some headphones that aren't compatible with the iPhone 7 (for whatever reason). If all else fails, just talk to apple at https://getsupport.apple.com and try to get yourself a hardware replacement.\n", "Q: Scrolling with MacBook trackpad: Is it possible to do with only one finger while a key pressed?

In previous versions of OSX, I could use Ctrl Shift  Power on my built in keyboard, or Ctrl Shift  Eject on my (old) Apple bluetooth keyboard to lock the screen. \nAfter upgrading to Sierra, that shortcut stopped working. Using Karabiner-EventViewer I discovered that pressing the built in power button triggers SysKey 0x6, and the Bluetooth keyboard Eject triggers no events. \nWhats going on, and how can re-enable that shortcut?\n\nA: In macOS High Sierra (10.13) there is a 'Lock Screen' option built in the Apple menu. \nAnd finally a shortcut ctrl + cmd + Q :-)\n\n\nA: Hold down the power button for about a half second. This will sleep the computer. If you have it set to lock when the computer sleeps, you're good to go. However, if you hold it down too long, it will ask to restart the computer.\nEdit: As ingenious stated, some keyboards do not have a power button. In that case, attempt to locate a sleep button or try another method.\n\n(source: andrels.com)\n\nA: You could use Hammerspoon and define a key binding/shortcut. I use \nhs.hotkey.bind({\"cmd\", \"alt\"}, \"S\", function()\n      hs.caffeinate.startScreensaver()\nend)\n\nin my ~/.hammerspoon/init.lua sequence to bind  Option+Command+S to the screen saver; that I have set to \"Require a password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins\" in System Preferences → Security & Privacy. You can also use\nhs.caffeinate.lockScreen() \n\nbut I prefer the screen saver approach. See the Hammerspoon docs for all the automation magic it enables.\n\nA: You can put your mac to sleep with ⌘ command + option + ⌽⏻. \nBefore that, have the setting as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nWorks for me on macOS Sierra!\n\nA: There are different ways to lock your screen.\nNote: These shortcut tips are for Sierra and below. In High Sierra, there is a new entry under the Apple Menu (with shortcut) to lock the screen.\n1. Use keychain\nOpen keychain -> Settings. Choose from there Show keychain status in menu bar.\n\nYou can now choose from the menu bar to lock your screen. \n\nWith this option, you need your password to log in next time.\n2. Use Hot Corners to lock your screen\nFirst, go to your System Settings -> Desktop & Screen Saver and choose Hot Corners on the bottom right.\n\nNext, choose one of the corners the option Put Display to Sleep. I prefer bottom right, but this is by each user different.\n\nThat's all. One note: You can configure in the Privacy Settings when the display will be locked. For example, if you have it set to five minutes, you need to enter your password after the time in your setting is gone. You can change this to immediately, for example.\n\n3. Lock Screen (with Shortcut)\nBecause @Flimm asked for a shortcut to lock the screen, here is a solution below High Sierra.\nUsually, there are two solutions. You can use CTRL+Shift+Power Button or\nCTRL+Shift+Eject-Key to lock the screen.\nBoth solutions are not my favourites, and for that reason, I've created a Shell Script with Automator. Thanks to Taylor who gave me this hint.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Spotlight and type Automator to open the Application.\n\n*Create a new Document.\n\n*Choose Service to make as global Service.\n\n*On the left Pane, choose Utilities; and on the right column, double-click Run Shell Script. You see a Window with the Cat-Command.\n\n*Delete the cat-Command and copy & paste the following Shell-Script into the empty Window:\n\n\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend\nMake sure that on the top right of the Automator-Window, both pull down-menus are set as no input in any application.\n\n\n*Click on the top right to the Run-Button (marked with green circle) and test if it works.\n\n*Save your workflow now as Lock Screen, for example.\n\n*Open System Preferences, Keyboard and click on the Button Shortcuts or Keyboard Shortcuts.\n\n*Choose on the Left columns Services and search for your saved workflow.\n\n*Add your favourite Shortcut (e.g. I have Cmd + Alt/Opt + L).\n\n\nFor better understanding, I have put the pictures below.\n\n\nApple Support Documents Mac Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nA: If you have a 2016 or later MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, you can assign one of the Touch Bar virtual keys to lock the Mac. It's under System Preferences/Keyboard and use the \"Customize Control Strip…\" button.\n\nA: You can setup a keyboard shortcut of your choice by creating a Service using Automator.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator (Cmd ⌘Space then enter Automator).\n\n*Create a new Service.\n\n*In the left pane, pick Utilities → Run Shell Script (or use the search field), and drag it into the Actions pane (the right one).\n\n*Just above that action, select Service receives no input in Any Application.\n\n*Enter \"/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession\" -suspend as the text of your shell script (be sure to include the quotes).\n\n*Save your service and give it a name.\n\n*Open  → System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Services → General (at the very bottom of the list).\n\n*Make sure the service you’ve just created is checked/enabled.\n\n*Click none to assign a keyboard shortcut to it.\n\n\nNow try your keyboard shortcut. You'll be kicked to the login screen. It might appear as though this logs you out, but it does not.\nThe service is also accessible from the Menu Bar → Application Name → Services. I think the very first time I set it up, I actually had to click it from there before the keyboard shortcut worked, but that might have been a fluke.\nIf you prefer to sleep your display instead of locking the screen, use pmset displaysleepnow as the shell script. This will put your display to sleep, though in that case your screen will only lock after the set timeout specified under  → System Preferences → Security → General. You could even go crazy and setup both services.\n\nA: Apple removed has removed this shortcut for security purposes & due to issues with bluetooth connectivity.You can utilize Hot Corners as a work-around.System Preferences>Desktop & Screen SaverYou get to choose what hot keys trigger the actionWhen I hold down Command and drag my mouse to top left corner, my computer locks it's screen.\n\nA: I am currently using a MacBook Pro that's running MacOS Sierra, version 10.12.4. Coming from a Windows and Ubuntu background, I found it odd that a Mac doesn't have an easy shortcut for locking the computer. However, what worked for me are these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences >> Security & Privacy.\n\n*Choose the General tab.\n\n*Set your Mac to require a password immediately the screensaver starts or your computer wakes from sleep.\n\n*Finally, whenever you want to lock your computer, just press the key combination of Ctrl + Shift + Power button.\n\nA: In macOS Sierra 10.12.6, I used the Keychain Access application > Preferences > Show Keychain Access in menu bar.\nI've just upgraded to macOS High Sierra 10.13.1 and that preference is no longer there. \nThanks to @pjc90 above, I now know about the \"Lock Screen\" option in the Apple menu, and the keyboard shortcut (finally) \"Command ⌘ + Control ⌃ + Q\".\n\nA: I needed this and was able to accomplish it with the following Apple Script inside of a shell script that does some other stuff, but this should be all you need:\nosascript <<EOD\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n                key code 12 using {control down, command down}\n        end tell\nEOD\n\n\nA: To lock screen:\npress control + Command + Q\n", "Q: iPad autofills incorrect information Why does my iPad think I am in another state? When I go to Maps, it shows the correct location. When I want to order something off the internet, it autofills Oregon and I am in California. I did buy a refurbished iPad.

Yes these are apps on Mac, so they have the ability to manage and control your iPhone.\nHere comes my first concern: since iOS is using the sandbox structure, we can't see folders when iPhone is connected to a computer, how could these apps find cache folders and delete files? Did they  jailbreak the phone? I'm running iOS 10.0.2.\nMoreover, I realised these apps could be malware, as I found a log file that showed my Mac serial number. What consequences I might have if the SN is disclosed?\n\nA: iOS apps that run on the device itself are sandboxed. Software running on an external device is not nearly as limited since it has more direct access to the device.\nThe reason you can't directly see folders on the device when you connect it to a computer is software - the drivers that let the computer OS recognize the device are set up to not show it as a removable storage device in Finder.\nNo, you did not jailbreak your phone.\nAnyone who has physical access to your Mac can obtain the serial number (as can any application running on it). The appearance of the serial number in a log just means it was logged to your computer. It doesn't actually tell you anything about what was done with it. The serial number is not private information, anyway.\n", "Q: New mailbox not getting created in new macOS 10.12.1 After I had migrated to 10.12.1, I started facing issues in creating new mailboxes in my mail account in the official Mail app. Earlier, I simply used to create a new mailbox and it used to appear immediately on the left-hand side along with other mailboxes. But now, when I create a mailbox, it asks me the Location and Name, and then nothing happens. Nowhere the mailbox is and I have a tough time to find a solution of this.\nI tried creating a new folder in my email account by logging into the web interface (Squirrelmail), and it showed up as a new mailbox, but the reverse is not working.\nIs this a known issue in 10.12.1? Any workaround / fix for this? I am having my own domain and using IMAP to configure the same in Mail app.\nThanks.\n\nA: I was having this issue as well, but stumbled across the answer, at least on my system. In the Mailboxes sidebar, try hovering over the name of the Mailbox within which you've tried to create new mailboxes...you should see a '+' as well as a 'Show' option appear to the right of the Mailbox name.

Create a service using Automator\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Automator (usually found within your Applications folder)\n\n*Go to File > New.\n\n*Select Service and click Choose.\n\n*In the top right hand of the window that appears, ensure that \"No input\" is selected from the Service receives drop-down list.\n\n*Ensure the In drop-down list is showing \"Any application\".\n\n*In the second column containing the long list, find \"Run AppleScript\" and double-click on it.\n\n*This will add the Run AppleScript window on the right.\n\n*Now, replace the ( Your script goes here ) with the following code:\n\n\nset exceptionsList to {\"HD1\", \"HD2\", \"HD3\", \"HD4\"}\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set diskList to the disks\n    repeat with mountedDisk in diskList\n        if name of mountedDisk is not in exceptionsList then\n            eject mountedDisk\n        end if\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n\n*In the first line of code, add your exceptions by changing the references to HD1, HD2, etc to any names of drives you do not want to eject. For example, HD1 should be replaced by your Macintosh HD (or whatever it's called). You may also want to add any Time Machine drives to the list, etc. You can add more by adding a comma and placing the name within quotes. Likewise, you can remove any you don't need.\n\n*Save the service using a meaningful name (e.g. EjectAll).\n\n\nNow to the next step.\n2. Creating your shortcut\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts.\n\n*Select Services from the sidebar.\n\n*Find your service (it'll be in the list on the right-hand side).\n\n*Add a shortcut by double clicking on the service name.\n\n*Now go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy.\n\n*Select Accessibility in the sidebar.\n\n*Click on the + sign (you may need to unlock the padlock if it's locked).\n\n*Add Automator.\n\n*Add Finder (to find this you will need to navigate to /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app).\n\n*Exit your System Preferences.\n\n\nNow you should be able to do two things:\n1. Eject your drives from any application by going to the Services list within any Application menu (e.g. Finder > Services, Safari > Services, Mail > Services, etc) and select the service you just created. This will eject all drives not within your exception list.\n2. Use the keyboard shortcut to run the service.\nNOTE: I am aware that for some users keyboard shortcuts do not seem to work even though they've been assigned to a service. This is a whole other topic, but if this happens in your case, at least you should now be able to eject all drives from within any application you're using.\nHope this helps you and others. \n", "Q: What is the font used on Console.app in macOS Sierra? Looks like Console.app went through some changes in macOS Sierra. I really liked the font used in that app but can't find it anywhere in the app (probably they disabled changing the font altogether).\n\nA: The font used in the Console.app on macOS Sierra is the SFMono-Regular font.\nThis can be found in /Applications/Utilities/Console.app/Contents/Resources/Fonts\nMore versions can be found in Xcode8 directories for example here:\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/SharedFrameworks/DVTKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Fonts/\n", "Q: Connecting to Cisco AnyConnect VPN without stored certificate or shared secret Many people have discussed configuring the OS X built-in VPN client to connect to Cisco VPNs in place of the AnyConnect client. However, all discussion focuses on copying critical config information (shared secret or certificate, in particular) from a PCF or Profile.xml file included in a site-specific AnyConnect installer.\nThe AnyConnect installer where I am now (version 4.2.01035) seems not to deploy any profile information. /opt/cisco/anyconnect/profile contains only AnyConnectProfile.xsd (a standard schema definition, not anything specific to this configuration). There’s no sign of any profile XML or PCF files that I can find in /opt/cisco, /Library,  or $HOME/Library.\nThis matches the UI experience: there don’t seem to be any preconfigured profiles. Instead, on first launch I just get a blank VPN field in which I simply enter a hostname by hand (in this case, ucbvpn.berkeley.edu) and hit connect. This gives a login prompt including a group selection dropdown, and username and password fields. Simply entering a username and password initiates the connection in the mode specified by the given “group,” and everything works fine.\nI cannot, however, figure out how this configuration can be fully transferred to the OS X native VPN client. Transferring a chosen group name from the list seemingly auto-discovered by the AnyConnect client, but the OS X VPN configuration seems to also require explicitly entering either a shared secret or a certificate.\nMy best guess is that the Cisco client is operating in a perhaps new mode where it can negotiate directly with the server to auto-discover any necessary configuration information, and that it’s not stored on disk anywhere. Does anyone have any experience with a setup like this, or have any suggestions of what else to try?\n\nA: I believe that the AnyConnect client can be used to connect to a number of different types of VPN offered by Cisco.  The process you describe above leads me to believe that you are connecting to an SSL-VPN. SSL-VPN does not require the use of a shared secret for the first layer of encryption.  Instead the client and the server auto-negotiate that first layer encryption using SSL.  You are then asked for credentials and a group membership.  The remainder of your VPN session is uniquely encrypted following Authentication.\nYou could script the connection so that instead of having to enter your credentials each time, you can store them in your keychain, and simply initiate the connection from the shell, or other script.  I did so a few years ago here:  http://www.wellingtonnet.net/code/2014-02-04/cisco_anyconnect_client_mac.html\nI have noticed that with each update of AnyConnect, I have had to tweak this script, so use it as an example and go from there.  It has been about a year since I last needed to connect via AnyConnect.\n", "Q: logging out of old Apple ID into new one I know that if I log out of my old apple id and sign into my new one that I will still keep my apps, but i'll need the password to update each app belonging to my old Apple ID. \nbut i'm just wondering if i don't want to do that, should i delete all of the apps of my phone and re-download using my new Apple ID to save the hastle?\nalso, i don't want to re-buy all of my music—will that remain on my device?  I do not want to waste unnessisary money. \nthanks!!\n\nA: Anything purchased under the existing ID will remain on the device but as you note, you will have to switch logins to update those apps. Whether the hassle is worth it is something only you can answer. Obviously for free apps, you probably want to download them with the new ID.\nMusic will remain and since there are no updates, you don't need to remain logged in to that account.\nWhen/if you upgrade to a new device, you will be prompted for the username and password that was used to purchase songs (videos, books, apps) in order to authorize the new device to play/use them.\nAs a side note, if you set up a new Apple ID because your email address changed, in the future, don't do that. Simply login at appleid.apple.com and you can change the email address associated with your account, which also changes the username. For the vast majority of people, one Apple ID is all you will ever need.\n", "Q: OS X Yosemite - cannot remember Keychain access password Is there any way to recover this?  Can I change it without knowing my current password?\n\nA: No. You cannot recover the contents of the keychain without the password. There is no way to reset the password retaining the keychain data.\n\nIf you want to access a login keychain after changing user's password, the keychain will still be accessible using the old password.\nIf the problem is reappearing password prompt after a login password change, you can delete and recreate the keychain, but the original data is non-recoverable.\n", "Q: Does the iPhone 7 Plus camera really \"zoom\"? I'm confused about the use of the term \"zoom\" in much of the discussion about the iPhone 7 Plus. As near as I can tell, just as has been the case on all previous models, there's no optical zoom at all. There's the usual digital zoom (cropping) and what's been added a second lens with a longer focal length, that is switched to (under favorable conditions) when the zoom level goes over 2x. So what's really going on is an automated switch from one lens to the other as cropping passes the 2x mark. Is that what's going on, or am I missing something? \n\nA: Apple states the iPhone 7 Plus has \"optical zoom at 2x\" and digital zoom up to 10x (versus the iPhone 7 having digital zoom only, and up to 5x).\nFrom developer notes:\n\nThese two cameras [can operate as] as a single virtual camera that automatically switches between physical cameras for zoom — in effect turning two prime lens cameras into a single zoom lens camera.\nThe Dual camera's defining feature is its ability to smoothly transition between wide and tele cameras, acting like a single lens camera with optical zoom at 2x.\nThe point at which the cross over from wide-angle to telephoto happens depends on a variety of factors including current focus position, current zoom factor, and current exposure.\n\nFrom a developer's point of view, when accessing the cameras, they can choose to target one of the two cameras specifically or can access a hybrid \"virtual\" camera that automatically switches as the user zooms.\nApple is not necessarily incorrect when it states that 2x is optical zoom, since at that point the image is entirely \"zoomed\" through physical lenses and not in software. That said, there is no lens on the device that is independently capable of optical zoom, so the term is also not really being used in its traditional meaning.\nBeyond 2x, zoom is entirely digital.\n", "Q: Mapping ⌘→ to ^Q→ in iTerm2 doesn't work I'm trying to make iTerm2 and tmux play nicer with eachother (without using the builtin tmux functions; I'd like my windows and panes managed by myself).\nTherefore, I want to map ⌘+→ to a key sequence starting with ^Q (my tmux prefix), followed by →.\n^Q is 0x11, and → is ^[[C, i.e. 0x1b 0x5b 0x43. However, if I try to make this mapping in the iTerm Preferences (Keys→Key Mappings, with the \"Send Hex Codes\" setting), it doesn't work, i.e. it doesn't switch my panes as I would expect.\n\nIf, shortly after pressing ⌘+→ I press → again, the active pane to the right is selected, so the ^Q must be coming through. If I just map it to 0x1b 0x5b 0x43 (→), it works, too.\nIs this a limitation of iTerm2 itself; can I not send longer key sequences? Is it sending the keys too fast for tmux?\nI also tried using the \"Send with vim special keys\" setting, but it doesn't seem to work at all; if I enter \"<C-Q><Right>\" it sends that text literally.\niTerm2 Build 3.0.8 on macOS Sierra.\n\nA: I found this on iTerm2's FAQ page.

I have a 21\" iMac late 2010 running OS X 10.11.6 & a 13\" MB-Pro late 2011 running the same. In /System/Libary/Core Services in the MBP, I have the following contextual menu:\n\nWhereas on the iMac, I have this one:\n\nCrucially, the latter one lacks \"Make Alias\" which I want to do for the Applications folder (& have already done so on the MBPro). Both the Applications folder and the enclosing folder \"Core Services\" have exactly the same permissions and ownerships on both machines. Both users on both Macs are non-admin users.\nCan anyone tell me why these contextual menus are different and how to get the iMac one as per the (larger) MBPro?\n\nA: The “Make Alias” option doesn’t appear in the contextual menu if it’s not enabled in the menu bar (the option is in the File menu). You should find that the option is enabled on one Mac, but not on the other. The only explanation I can think of is that this is due to differing permissions or due to differing enablement of the new “System Integrity Protection” feature of El Capitan (if the latter is enabled, it prevents everyone, including the “root” user, from writing in the “System” folder). The “Make Alias” option puts the alias in the same folder as the aliased item, and therefore you need to be able to write in that folder to select the option.\nAn alternative way to create an alias, in a different folder, is to drag the item while holding down the Option (⌥) and Command (⌘) keys.\nThere’s an Apple support article titled “OS X El Capitan: Create and use aliases” you may want to check out.\n", "Q: iTunes 12.5.1.21 on Windows 10 Version 1607 cannot detect iPhone 6s and iPod Touch (5th Generation) I have an iPhone 6s and iPod Nano 5th generation which I use with a Dell PC (15R 5521) running Windows 10 version 1607 (updated to the latest version). \nThe latest version of iTunes (12.5.1.21) is installed but it does not detect either of the devices. \nI have tried reinstalling iTunes (doesn't work), trying to update drivers for iPhone and iPod (from Device Manager, doesn't do anything).\nAny help or suggestions because I'm at a loss.\nThanks! \n\nA: If you are on Windows 10 N or KN, try installing the latest version of the \"Media Feature Pack\". \nThe latest version at present for Windows 10 v. 1607 is the Aug 2, 2016 version, which you can download here.\n", "Q: Set a personalized alarm clock schedule on iPhone I need to set a schedule of alarms using the below formula:\nDay:yes Day:no\nFor example, starting Monday:\nDay:alarm\nMonday:yes Tuesday:no Wednesday:yes Thursday:no Friday:yes Saturday:no Sunday:yes Monday:no Tuesday:yes Wednesday:no Thursday:yes Friday:no Saturday:yes …\nAnyone can help?\n\nA: You can't do this with the Alarm mode within the default Clock app in iOS. However, you can do this using either the Reminders app or the Calendar app.\nWakeup alarms\nFirst of all, if you want this to work as a wake-up alarm in the same way as the Alarm in the Clock app, you need to change the sound associated with the app. If this is what you want, these are the steps involved:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings\n\n*Tap on Sounds\n\n*Scroll down to and tap on either the Calendar Alerts option or the Reminder Alerts option\n\n*Scroll down to the list of Ringtones (past the alert tones) and select the ringtone you want to use as your alarm.

Does this mean that I have to change the entire screen. I read somewhere online that I might have to change the entire screen.\nCan't apple just change the rubber gasket?\nWhat if I just leave it as it is? Will the screen come off? :O :O\nPicture for reference:\n\n\nA: Okay, first things first. It's definitely worth you taking it in to an Apple Store (if you're able to) or phoning Apple support about this. I have known Apple to replace this even if you're technically outside their warranty period. Of course, each case is different, and it will depend on the What, When, How and Why of your situation. In a nutshell, it doesn't hurt to ask.\nNow, regarding whether this has to involve the replacement of your entire screen, the answer is not so straightforward.\nOfficially Apple does not supply the rubber as a separate part, instead it comes with a new lid/screen replacement. However, I have known Apple to replace the rubber on its own, so they can do it.\nAlso, I'm personally aware of this being done by following the same steps of replacing the screen - except that you only go as far as removing the old gasket and then follow the steps in reverse to add the new gasket and put everything back together again.\nIf you have no joy at Apple you can choose to repair it yourself (if it's not something that scares you).\nTo repair it yourself you can purchase a new gasket from places like eBay.

Notice if you disable resampling, \"pixels\" is no longer an option on the drop-down menu next to Height and Width, because resizing does not change the number of pixels, so you can't express the new size in pixel dimensions.\nResampling an image changes the number of pixels in the image. Resampling would generally be used when preparing images for the web, since you have a target PPI (see below) and need to reduce the pixel dimensions while maintaining that PPI.\nOne important thing to know before going further: The number of pixels in an inch, or PPI, determines the sharpness of an image. The more pixels in an inch, the sharper an image is. If you have an LCD monitor whose physical dimensions are 12\" wide x 9\" high, with a resolution of 1920x1080, it would have 160 PPI. A monitor with the same resolution but physical dimensions of 16\" wide x 12\" high would have 120 PPI and would look noticeably more grainy or blurry.\nResizing\nIf you make an image smaller without resampling, the resolution will increase to compensate, since when you resize, the number of pixels present does not change. \nIf you make an image larger without resampling, conversely, the resolution will decrease. Your image will become blurrier because while no new pixels are being added, the pixels are spreading out to cover more space and PPI drops.\nResampling\nIf you make an image smaller by resampling, the number of pixels present will be reduced. This means PPI stays the same, since while you are reducing the dimensions of the image, you are reducing the number of pixels present at the same ratio.\nIf you make an image larger by resampling, the pixel dimensions will increase and PPI will again stay the same. In order to accomplish this, pixels have to be created where there weren't any before. Your image will again become blurrier. The program has to estimate what pixels should be added based on the existing pixels, and it won't be perfect, resulting in jagged lines and overall blurriness.\n", "Q: Why can't I create a directory under /opt without sudo? Mac 10.11.5 (El Capitan) here. I just tried creating a directory under /opt:\nmyUser$ mkdir /opt/bupo\nmkdir: /opt/bupo: Permission denied\n\nWhy would I need to prefix this with sudo and then authenticate myself in order for this command to work? If I were to use sudo mkdir /opt/bupo, then what user would actually be creating + owning this bupo/ directory, would it be root?\n\nA: Only the root user can write to the root of the file system. So, it is safe to assume that the /opt directory is owned by root. The default umask would make that directory read, write, and executable to the owner;\nread and executable to the group; read and executable to others/everyone.\nIf you use sudo mkdir /opt/bupo the directory would be owned by the root user.\n", "Q: iPhone 7 and 7 Plus wallpapers in iOS 10 On apple.com some variations of this wallpaper are shown on iPhone 7 and 7 Plus screens:\n\nI can't find them on my iPhone 7 (iOS 10.0.2). Are they available exclusively for 7 Plus?\nHere the same question: https://discussions.apple.com/message/30744677#30744677 (but no answer).\n\nA: They are not available by default but you can find them online here.\n\nA: No. These wallpapers are just for advertising the iPhone 7 / 7 Plus. These wallpapers will not be available in the Settings > Wallpapers > Stills . As Tom S said, You can download these full resolution here. Just Tap and Hold on the image and select save to camera role / save to photos. after that, you can go to Settings > Wallpapers > choose new Wallpaper. you should be able to see \"All photos\". In that, just select the preferred Image, A preview screen will open. There, turn on perspective zoom, as it give an active felling to the wallpaper, or turn it off if you want to conserve more battery.\n\nA: These wallpapers (as well as new emoji) will probably be available with iOS 10.2. At least they are available with 10.2 beta 1.\n", "Q: How to open .plist files in macOS Sierra without using Xcode? Problem\nI just went to use Property List Editor to look at a .plist file and it no longer works in Sierra\n\n \nMy Setup\nMid-2010 15\" MBP\nmacOS Sierra 10.12\n \nCrucial Comment\nI do not want to use Xcode to open .plist files, it's too much for such a simple task. The Property List Editor was perfect.\n \nWhat I have Found\nAs of 2016-09-13 The Apple Developer website describes Xcode as the only option to edit .plist files (search for: About Information Property List Files)\nApple mentions using Xcode to generate and work with .plist files but there has to be another way.\n \n\n*\n\n*Is the Property List Editor App done in macOS Sierra?\n\n\n*If so, other than Xcode, are there any simple programs like the Property List Editor that people recommend?\n \nThank you for your responses!\n \nUPDATE\n\n*\n\n*This is not a \"duplicate\" question. This question is specifically for those who are used to using Property List Editor and have lost it as an option when upgrading to macOS Sierra. So keeping this question thread will help others with the specific issue, especially if they are not a fan of using Xcode to work with plist files and/or do not know how to work with plist files through terminal.\n\n\n*The solution linked in the \"claimed\" duplicate thread can be useful to those familiar with terminal.\n\n\n*Those familiar with terminal, you can also use rlwrap and PlistBuddy, which IS currently working in macOS Sierra. See: A  Simple PlistBuddy Tutorial\n\n\n*Those not familiar with terminal who want to avoid Xcode: sorry, I haven't found a solution for you but I'll keep looking into it. If anyone else has a suggestion please add it. If there are other *exchange posts with software recommendations please feel free to link them for other users in the future.\n\nA: OBSOLETE (2020)\nI have used Pref Setter in the past to edit .plist files graphically.\nbrew cask install pref-setter\n\nAny text editor (including Text Edit) will work if the file is non-binary.  If you right click on any .plist file and click \"Get Info\", under \"Open With\" there should be an option to change the default editor for it, which you would then change to Pref Setter. If you click on \"Change All\", it will change it for every .plist file on your system.\n", "Q: Smart Mailbox no longer working The Smart Mailbox I have set up for Wells Fargo emails has stopped populating since January 2016. Previously it had populated properly since I made it in 2010.\nI have since received many Wells Fargo Bill Pay emails - but they don't populate into the Smart Mailbox.\nI have created another Smart Mailbox with the same name but with a number one (1) after. It shows exactly the same emails.\n\nA: What fixed it for me was this procedure, i.e.:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Go to the Applications > Utilities folder.\n  \n*Open Activity Monitor.\n  \n*Select “All Processes” from the View menu.\n  \n*Search for “mds”.\n  \n*Select and quit each instance of “mds” and/or “mdserver” separately (force-quit if you have to).\n  \n\nI had only one instance of “mds”. Force-quitting it was enough to instantly solve the problem. Kudos to MacIssues!\n\nA: I had the same thing with an unread mail smart mailbox.  I found the solution was to check in system preferences under spotlight.  go to the privacy tab and check you dont have your HDD tagged.  Dont know how it became tagged but removing it meant that once the Mac had completed the indexing my smart mailbox started working again.\n", "Q: pwd in bash is wrong after sending directory to trash If I move a directory to the trash that I'm already cd'd into that directory, pwd will report no change in location.  I will still be able to do everything in bash normally as if there was no change in the directory, even though Finder says it doesn't exist.  \npwd should always be accurate. This does not appear to be the case.   \nFor example, I'm cd'd to this path:\n/Users/me/Desktop/goingToTrash/subdir \nIf I move to trash /Users/me/Desktop/goingToTrash, pwd will report that I'm in /Users/me/Desktop/goingToTrash/subdir, even though the finder says it doesn't exist.  So if I recreate the deleted directory, bash will be working from the old directory (I'm assuming in the trash, haven't verified yet) instead of the new one I just created, and pwd will provide no clue this happened.  \nMuch worse, if I \"move to trash\" a directory and I'm cd'd to one of it's subdirectories, then recreate the directory structure, from a sub directory I can cd ../subdir, I'm magically back into the \"new\" directory, even though the parent was \"moved to trash\" instead of remaining in the directory structure that was moved to trash.  \n\nA: This behavior actually has nothing to do with the .Trash directory.  You can get into a similar situation by moving your current working directory to any other location.  The pwd command and echo $PWD will both be inaccurate. \nWhat I have found is that starting a new bash process will correctly identify the new location of your current working directory.  Therefore a workaround would be to simply \"refresh\" your current bash process with a new one with the command exec bash.\n\nA: YMMV when there is an inaction between the shell and the Finder.app. It is best to use-\n/bin/pwd\n\ninstead of the builtin pwd.\nYou can add this line to your ~/.bashrc and reset bash to \"fix\" this problem.\nalias pwd=\"/bin/pwd\"\nAn alternative to /bin/pwd (with or without the alias) is pwd -P. The -P option to the builtin pwd is explained in the output of help pwd.\n", "Q: Can't opt out of Beta downloads I opted out of beta downloads under System Preferences > App Store, but I still see macOS beta downloads in the Mac App Store.\nHow can I fix this?

At that time, you can upgrade to the stable commercial release and you will no longer receive beta notifications.\nIf you further wish to leave the beta program entirely, after unenrolling in System Preferences go to the Apple Beta unenroll page and click the link at the very bottom of the page.\n", "Q: Why preview is showing a black box instead of an image? I just updated from El Capitan to macOS Sierra and I found a problem with preview. \nWhen I open certain PDF with images in it, sometimes the image appears black and sometimes I see it.

We have some Mac Pro workstations, and a number of people with Linux and windows laptops would like to be able to run GUI programs from those workstations remotely, ideally with X11 forwarding.\nI know you can use Xquartz to get windows from a remote Linux machine, but is it possible to do it the other way around? That is, is it possible to use X forwarding to get windows from a remote Macintosh machine? If so, how?\n\nA: When I tried that a while back the app would open on the Mac instead of the Linux machine. Then I remember reading a while back:\n\nX forwarding only works for X Windows System-based applications. To do remote work on an OS X system, it’s better to use Apple Remote Desktop.

On my Mac, 5.73 GB is used by the iTunes Media/Mobile Applications folder. I would like to remove that folder, and from what I've seen in the other question I should be fine removing the mobile applications from iTunes. However I can't seem to find those mobile applications anywhere in iTunes anymore. Maybe in the redesign they removed or moved it? What is the proper way for me to remove the applications?\nFor more details, I used to have an iPhone 4S on iOS 7 that I no longer use, and I would update apps on iTunes and sync them to the phone. I also have an iPad 2 on iOS 9 which I may have occasionally used iTunes to put or update apps onto the the iPad but I don't need to do this and generally don't. (In fact, I don't even know anymore how it is possible to update or install apps with iTunes for the iPad... is it?) I also have an iPhone SE on iOS 9 (will probably be iOS 10.1 in a month or two), and I don't use iTunes to sync apps on that either (at least not practically, for that and my iPad I don't know if there is some setting somewhere that says to sync some apps), but when I first set up my iPhone from a backup of the 4S in iTunes I think it may have included apps that it copied over via iTunes.\nWhich also leads me to a followup question: If I remove the folder via Finder or somehow via iTunes, and I need to restore the iPhone from a backup, would the phone need to re-download those 5 GB of apps online? As it stands it doesn't seem that new apps I put on my iPhone SE are saved in iTunes so maybe I'd have to do that either way.\n\nA: If you sync a device with the computer, and the apps don't already exist on that computer, they will be transferred from the device onto the computer. (This may only apply to apps newly downloaded since your last sync.)\nIf you're using iTunes 12.5.1, it's now accessible through the drop-down menu that allows you to switch between Music, Movies, Podcasts, etc., as Apps. If it's not visible on that menu, choose the Edit Menu item on the menu and check the box next to Apps, hit Done, and then click on Apps.\nOnce in Apps, you can remove them by right-clicking on an application (or selecting several and then right-clicking) and choosing Delete, then Delete Apps, then Move to Trash.\nYou can set your computer to automatically download new apps that you purchase on your device under Preferences > Store tab > Automatic Downloads and check the box for Apps.\nIf you restore a backup from iTunes, it does the restore and then does a separate sync step where it loads the apps back onto the device. I don't know what would happen if the apps weren't on the computer to be put back on, though. If you restore from an iCloud backup, the apps are re-downloaded over the internet.\n", "Q: Is there a way to stop an app creating its own space at the back of the stack when you maximize it? Is there a way to stop an app creating its own space at the back of the stack when you maximize it?

This has been the case for a while. There is no way to change it that I am aware of.\nThe settings that affect which space an app can be in only apply to non-full-screen windows.\n", "Q: What happens with your apps if you restore from iTunes backup? It is my understanding that restoring from iCloud causes apps to re-download automatically. If, however, I backup to iTunes, and iTunes does not have copies of my apps in the library, and I need to restore the device, what happens to the apps? My guess of what the desired operation should be is that the iTunes backup tells the device which apps it should have, and the device could then start automatically downloading them from the app store, organized the way they used to be and all (with the hopes being you have enough bandwidth for 5GB of app downloads). Is that how it works?\nAnd is there any way to backup apps from the device to iTunes to avoid the bandwidth issue?\n\nA: Indeed: restoring from an iCloud backup works the same way as restoring from an iTunes backup and all of your apps will automatically redownload.\n\nA: If your iTunes account is different from your iCloud account, then it appears that an iCloud backup will not restore your apps. That is what has happened to me. \n", "Q: 3TB Fusiondrive split, Need help My Fusiondrive has split and I really need your help.\nI made a backup and I am ready to delete everything clear slate.\nHow can I get everything fixed?\nThanks a lot for your help.\ndiskutil list\n\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            121.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3\n\n/dev/disk1 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *3.0 TB     disk1\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            2.5 TB     disk1s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk1s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data 200gb                   208.6 GB   disk1s4\n   5:       Microsoft Basic Data 200gb2                  208.5 GB   disk1s5\n   6:                        EFI NO NAME                 104.9 MB   disk1s6\n   7:       Microsoft Basic Data 4                       354.4 MB   disk1s7\n   8:                        EFI NO NAME                 104.9 MB   disk1s8\n   9:                        EFI NO NAME                 104.9 MB   disk1s9\n  10:                  Apple_HFS 3                       67.5 GB    disk1s10\n  11:       Microsoft Basic Data 5                       471.9 MB   disk1s11\n  12:                        EFI NO NAME                 104.9 MB   disk1s12\n  13:                  Apple_HFS 1                       471.9 MB   disk1s13\n  14:                        EFI NO NAME                 104.9 MB   disk1s14\n\n/dev/disk2 (internal, virtual):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:                            Macintosh HD           +2.6 TB     disk2\n                                 Logical Volume on disk0s2, disk1s2\n                                 E6BEBC47-429D-4A0B-BBAA-78283E95CE02\n                                 Unencrypted Fusion Drive\n\n\nA: I managed to delete everything in the command line and i now have 2 drives (ssd and hdd).

When I right-click on a link in Firefox in Mac OS X, I get a menu like this:\n\nNow most of these items have keyboard shortcuts, so I can quickly press a single key instead of moving the mouse to a specific item. For example:\nt = Open Link in New Tabk = Save Link As... etc. \nHowever I have no easy way of finding out what they are. \nIs there a way to highlight or visualize these shortcuts, for example by underlining them like this:\n (photoshopped example)\nThis is also how Windows does it. Something like that possible on Mac as well?\nP.S. This doesn't specifically relate to Firefox, just took this as an example but I would love to see keyboard shortcuts in general.\n\nA: You can see system keyboard shortcuts in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts (or by searching Google).\nFor keyboard shortcuts that correspond to menu items, they can be seen in the menus at the top of the screen, across from their corresponding commands.\nRegarding the contextual menu, I just tested with the Desktop, Google Chrome and Apple's Messages. Pressing a letter takes me to the first item that starts with that letter. (For items that start with the same letter, also type the second [and third, etc.] letter to jump to the correct item.)\nI don't believe Firefox's behavior is normal on Mac, so I would say filing a bug report with Firefox would be the most appropriate course of action. I'd think changing to how the rest of the OS works would be ideal. Short of that, putting the shortcut right-aligned across from the corresponding item would work best, since that would match how menu bar menus work.\n", "Q: Additional characters when I press longer How to turn those additional characters off?

I quote:\n\nAfter much reading I learn't there are multiple ways to construct the\n  same unicode character, and so for efficient comparision there is a\n  concept called normalisation ( http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/ ).\n  After normalising with the same algorithm the representiation of any\n  character will be consistent.\nSadly there are multiple normalisation algorithms and no concensus on\n  which to use. Apple use NFD, where as most other operating systems use\n  NFC. NFS does not specify a normalisation method, so OSX cannot\n  confidently convert out of the box.\nAll I needed to do to fix this was to tell NFS that my NFS shares used\n  NFC. Then all the files with the odd characters appeared and read\n  fine.\nI did this by adding this line to /etc/nfs.conf on the Mac.\nnfs.client.mount.options = intr,locallocks,nfc\n\nWorks perfectly.\n\nAddition: \nThe options intr,locallocks are not related to character encoding so the solution should be workinf=g without these, i.e.\nnfs.client.mount.options = nfc\n\nAlthough I haven't tried this as these two options make sense in my usage scenario.\n", "Q: CloudMagic is about to stop working on September 30th.

The last CloudMagic version is supposed to stop working on 30th September 2016.\nIs there a way to prevent it from happening? Maybe I can block some IP address? I really like it, but I'm not going to use their new subscription.\n\nA: There are two ways Cloudmagic could make their app stop working on a certain date:\n\n\n*\n\n*The destruction date could be built in to late versions of the Mac client itself, checking on startup if it's September 30th yet or not.\n\n*The Cloudmagic server (yes, your email is on their servers, that's why they starting needing money to support it) could start checking to make sure every client it's giving data to is Newton and not Cloudmagic (on Sep 30): most likely Newton has a special verification key that Cloudmagic doesn't, which was added in the name-changing update.\nRegardless of which of these routes the developers took, there's nothing you can do to prevent the built-in destruction date. \nEdit: You should note that updating to Newton will get you a 12-month free trial with no strings attached; I'm taking advantage of that right now.\n", "Q: iOS: Photos app taking 800 MB after deleting all photos I have iOS 10 with Photos library taking 32 GB on iCloud.

I've tried SMC and PRAM resets, taking the battery out, and external mouse and keyboard with limited success.\nA few months ago, the internal keyboard and trackpad would work intermittently, but after a week or so, they quit working altogether. The power button still works. Though, I'm now experiencing issues with the computer's bootup. Sometimes when I boot it up, it shows the Apple logo and then quits. This didn't happen before. And before I get into it, the internal keyboard and trackpad don't work during bootup either. I can't use them to boot into safe mode or reset the PRAM or SMC. I need an external keyboard for that.\nI was traveling in Southeast Asia at the time with no Apple store within a few thousand miles, so I didn't go see anyone about it. I read forum after forum, and asked questions. I was told (and convinced) by several people that the problem was a swollen battery. In Malaysia, I took the bottom off of my computer, which seemed to make it a little more stable. It created more room in the computer body, and lent credibility to the swollen battery idea. In Asia, I just couldn't get what I needed to take the battery out and try it. I went to an internet cafe in Indonesia and borrowed a mouse and keyboard. I was hoping to install a driver to use my iPhone as a new wireless mouse and keyboard. My experience was less than stellar. The computer was super jumpy. The mouse and keyboard barely worked. I'm not sure if it was the computer's fault or the cheap equipment at the cafe. Restarting the computer didn't seem to do anything.\nFast forward to London, I was at my mother-in-law's house. She had the security I needed to work on my computer as well as an external mouse and keyboard. They worked great! The computer was not jumpy like it was in Indonesia. I took the battery out (please don't give me flack about how my battery is non-removable, I know what I'm doing). To my surprise, the internal keyboard and trackpad still didn't work.\nI'm back in Berlin where I now could go to an Apple store, but I'm also in the best place to work on it myself, and I'd like to take one last stab at it before I pay some extortionate fee to have it fixed. Does anyone have any ideas, that don't have to do with the battery, of why this could happen to a pretty new computer?\n\nA: Firstly, it's definitely worth you taking it in to an Apple Store. I have known Apple to do repairs and/or replacements even when the item is technically outside their warranty period. Of course, each case is different, and it will depend on the What, When, How and Why of your situation. In a nutshell, it doesn't hurt to ask.\nSecondly, although it does sound like you know what you're doing, can you confirm you used the correct procedure for resetting the SMC for your particular MacBook? The steps should be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your computer.\n\n*Keep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) plugged in.\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button.\n\n*Let go.\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button.\n\n\nThirdly, since you've now got access to an external keyboard and mouse, have you tried starting in Safe Mode? If so, what happened? If not, can you try it now and report back?\nFinally, since you've now got access to an external keyboard, have you tried using Apple Diagnostics? You can do this by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure your MacBook is plugged in to a power source.\n\n*Do a full shutdown of the computer.\n\n*Press your power button and immediately press and hold the d key until you see Apple Diagnostics start.\n\n*Let the process finish and take note of the results.\n\n\nPlease share your results.\n\nA: So I read this somewhere in a apple forum and it worked.  I have an 2015 MacBook Pro. My key board was not working after sleep and then it just didn't work anymore. Super annoying.  I was plugging a usb keyboard in and using it with no issues.\nI turned off (unchecked) the \"animate opening applications\" \nYou can access this in Dock Preferences\nThen I deleted all unused Bluetooth devices and went to advanced options and UNCHECKED the 3 options listed\n1 - Open Bluetooth set up assistant at start up if no keyboard is detected\n2 - Open Bluetooth setup assistant at start up if no mouse or trackpad detected\n3 - Allow Bluetooth devices to wake this computer.\nSince I did this no issues on the wake up problem with key board not working.\n", "Q: autossh in background does not work anymore Prior to my updating to macOS Sierra, autossh worked just fine.

In order for this to work, I had to add ssh-add -A to my .bashrc, now things work as expected.\n", "Q: IKEv2 VPN on macOs 10.12 Sierra When I try to configure an IKEv2 VPN on macOs Sierra the following errors occur:\nnesessionmanager    Failed to find the VPN app for plugin type com.apple.neplugin.IKEv2\nneagent Failed to process IKE SA Init packet\n\nFrom the first line it seems it's not supported at all.\nHave you experienced the same issue?\n\nA: In my situation, setting server-side in ipsec.conf:\n leftsendcert=always\n\nsolved the problem.\nFrom ipsec.conf documentation:\n\nleft|rightsendcert = never | no | ifasked | always | yes\nAccepted values are never or no, always or yes, and ifasked, the\n  latter meaning that  the peer must send a certificate request (CR)\n  payload in order to get a certificate in return.\n\nMoreover, I had to add to the Keychain the root certificate and trust it in order to validate the certificate sent by the server and I read that if you have intermediate certificates you have to trust them too.\n\nA: May be related to known bug https://github.com/lionheart/openradar-mirror/issues/6082 and https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7453073\n", "Q: Can you remove PDF's after you add them to iBooks?

The laptop's keyboard works fine. I have not fiddled with the keyboard configuration, other than changing to my regional layout and swapping modifier keys (it's a windows keyboard).\nIt worked flawlessly1 before the upgrade. I know very little of how to troubleshoot macOS, what should I do?\n1 I just remembered that, no, it wasn't all that flawless; from time to time the keyboard would stop responding, and I'd have to unplug and plug again. Don't think it's related, but...\nPD: It happens with all external Keyboards. Tried with a few. All of them where ISO, and it seems the problem is in macOS treating my ISO keyboards as ANSI; the laptop's internal keyboard is ISO though, and has no issue. I've done a clean install of Sierra, and it's still wrong.\n\nA: In my case the issue seems to have been caused by a utility called Karabiner Elements.\nIt helps me use the Caps Lock key as an additional Escape key. After uninstalling it I removed /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist and restarted the machine. After restart the Keyboard Assistant was able to correctly identify the keyboard.\n\nA: I've had to install Karabiner Elements and then change the Keyboard Type (available on the tab Virtual Keyboard) to ISO.\nUpdate (July 2018): After installing a MacOS update (10.13.6) the problem has appeared again. However the latest version of Karabiner Elements (12.1.0) doesn't have the Keyboard Type option anymore. There is a Country Code which was set to '1' when I opened Karabiner. After messing around with this value with no success for a while, I've restarted the Mac, which has fixed the issue.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my keyboard and a German layout. Although I had \"German\" set up as \"System Preferences/Keyboard/Input Source\" most of my keys had the wrong mapping. E.g. the key right to the Left Shift Key on my keyboard is \"<>\" instead it was mapped to \"^°\".\nThe problem was that my keyboard was setup as an ANSI-type of keyboard (used in the US). Instead it should have been set up as a ISO-type (used in most european countries).\nThere are several possible solutions to this mapping problem as described by Tom Gewecke on his Blog.\n\nThe fix for this is to run the Keyboard Setup Assistant again. Sometimes there is a button for \"Change Keyboard Type\" visible in \"System Preferences/Keyboard\".\nIf not, you can try trashing the file\n  /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist\n  and restarting your machine.\nAnother possibility may be to open Terminal and type:\n  sudo open /System/Library/CoreServices/KeyboardSetupAssistant.app/Contents/MacOS/KeyboardSetupAssistant\n\nWhen the Keyboard Setup Assistant appears again after reboot be sure to choose the right type of keyboard - ISO.\nIf none of that helps follow the above link to Toms post with further options.\n\nA: I've been plagued by this for a while, with \\ and ` getting switched on a regular basis.  macOS starts thinking my keyboard is ANSI rather than ISO, and it isn't possible to change it without restarting.  That is no good when in the middle of writing a complex regex.\nA workaround I have found is to use Ukelele to create a bundle of 2 keyboard layouts one that has the same mapping as printed on the physical keys, and one with the \\ and ` switched.\nOnce installed, I can then switch between the keyboard layouts without having to reboot, and can stop fighting with macOS to recognise my ISO keyboard!\n\nA: Had a similar issue as described above, resetting the modifier keys helped miraculously. I had switched the Ctrl/Options keys before upgrading to macOS Sierra 10.12.1 Beta. \nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys... > Restore Defaults\n\nA: Using a nordic layout (Icelandic), it seems that High Sierra identifies nordic ISO keyboards incorrectly. On my old Logitech Cordless Pro, the right windows key is incorrectly mapped to AltGr (Right alt), and on my new Microsoft Sculpt keyboard, there is no key mapped to the AltGr key. \n\nA: In SystemPreferences->Keyboard->InputSources\nclick the +  sign left below, go to Spanish/Español and select it:\non the right check if you have selected the correct one (Spanish or Spanish-ISO).\n\nA: I had same issue. I've had Logitech M705 and it comes with unifying receiver. Then connected another USB wired keyboard and this layout issue occured. MacOS detect Logitech Receiver both keyboard and mouse. When I started keyboard configuration it asks for Logitech Keyboard layout until removing the unifying receiver. If there's no unifying receiver configuration tool ask for USB keyboard layout and detects neighbour-to-left-shift correctly. I resolved it that way.\n\nA: Trashing /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist, restarting the machine and giving the \"proper / expected input\" instead of the right input of the shift solved my problem. Thanks @aga\n", "Q: Display resolution options disappeared after upgrade to Sierra After I upgraded an MBPr to 10.12 Sierra, the 4k external display connected to it shows significantly less options under Display > Resolution > Scaled (pressing Option to see the resolutions). Before, I always used it at resolutions between 2160p and 1080p, generally 1440p, but those are gone now.\nWhat could cause this? How would you troubleshoot it? I'd rather fix it without having to force the resolution in configuration files (like I had to do years ago), but that'd be better than this situation.\nThanks!\n\nA: I purchase a new MacPro (the little black trash can) and shortly after, chose to install the Sierra update. Upon restart, it would not recognize my Apple Cinema's high res settings. After 3 hours with Apple tech support, they filed a report to Apple engineering who solved my problem with this solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine\n\n*Unplug all of your monitor's connections (in my case, 2 USB and 1 Thunderbolt) and reconnect using only the ports on the RIGHT side of the Mac.\n\n*Voila!

Is there any way to turn off GPS when doing a workout to save battery?\nCheers\n\nA: According to Apple, the built-in GPS of the Apple Watch series 2 will not kick in if the iPhone the watch is paired to is within range. \nSo, depending on your workout, having the iPhone with you (or nearby) will result in the iPhone doing the grunt work to conserve power usage of the Apple Watch.\nAlso, even if your iPhone isn't nearby, the Apple Watch GPS will not kick in unless you're actually doing a workout. For example, if you forgot your iPhone at home when you went to work and did nothing but sit in a car or at your desk the whole day, then the GPS would have never kicked in.\nAs for a setting to manually switch the GPS off, there wasn't one in the beta versions of WatchOS 3, but there are rumours that a future update may add this option.\nHope this helps.\n[EDIT]\nI just wanted to clarify that whether the Apple Watch GPS kicks in or not will also depend on the actual workout. Basically, if it's an indoor workout it won't, if it's an outdoor workout it will (i.e. if your iPhone isn't nearby). However, if it's a swimming workout the GPS only kicks in if it's an open water swim (i.e not in the pool) and you're doing freestyle.

You can use the following AppleScript code to toggle the state of the Menu bar and Dock.\nAssuming that the state of both the Dock and the Menu bar are in sync.

I have bought a lot of pop music and classical music on the iTunes store. Some classical music album is like $9.99 for 100 songs, and I think I have about 500 of them in total.\nWhen driving a car, I tend to like to listen to some pop or rock, but since there are so many classical songs, they would play often than not.\nIs there a way simply to play all songs except classical, or except classicalm, movie soundtrack, and opera songs?  Perhaps by using something in the Music app or by Siri. (I tried \"Play rock music\" using Siri, and what I got was \"Starting Facetime with Rutso, mobile\" and immediate calling at 6am in the morning.)\nPlaylists shouldn't be used, because if I set up a playlist for current pop and rock music, and then if 15 other songs are purchased later, the playlist will again need to be updated constantly.  Besides, it is a lot of routine work to add 200 rock and pop songs to a playlist.\nThe iOS version I have is 10.0.2.\n\nA: You can use an app like SmartPlaylist to create smart playlists on your device.\nYou can also create a smart playlist on a computer in iTunes then sync it to your phone. Even though you can't create smart playlists on the device, they do still update automatically as new music is added to the device. No manual maintenance is needed.\n\nA: Open the Music app, make a new playlist, put in all genres except classical.\n", "Q: Sierra Spotlight vs mdfind vs finder I have seen several Sierra/Spotlight questions posted but none are what I am experiencing.\nI am not receiving any errors when re-indexing. My migration to Sierra from El Capitan went without a glitch. However Spotlight does not return accurate results. Files I know exist do not show up.\nMy first and second thought was there is a corrupt mdstore, Rebuilt mdstore multiple times to no avail.\nObservation 1  - mdfind in terminal works as expected. Finding all the files expected. However Spotlight does not.\nObservation 2 - In Finder when using the first available search box the results are wrong and identical to spotlight results\nObservation 3 - In Finder when using secondary search boxes (click + sign to open up additional search boxes) and clearing the first search box then all files are found as expected identical to mdfind.\nSo now I only use mdfind or finder with detailed search boxes and all is ok\nIs this a bug in Spotlight and not an mdstore issue?\nSound like a bug to me\nthanks\n\nA: Regarding Observation 1: \nAs far as I understand, this is a long-standing bug in the way Spotlight is constructed (going back to Lion or even earlier). In Sierra it has just been acerbated to the point, where I have completely abandoned Spotlight and am using the Find (CMD+F) function in Finder. With this function I find all the files I am expecting to find and have also a larger array of options to choose.\nAccording to my understanding the issue arises as Spotlight searches by strings and has some odd rules for defining strings, which appear to not be consistent at all. \nRegarding Observation 2 and 3:\nIf a Spotlight search has been started the CMD-F function only returns the same as the Spotlight search. I can't figure out why it does do so. So you need to shut down the Spotlight search first to get a result with Find that is different from the Spotlight search result. It looks like the search results are not refreshed in between the two searches.\nFurther Observation to the issue of not refreshing search results: \nYou search a file with Spotlight. Upon locating it you move it to a different folder. You use undo. From now on the file is found by Spotlight in the original folder even if it is moved again. But don't delete it - it is not a copy - it actually has been moved, Spotlight just refuses to acknowledge this.\n", "Q: Hard drive partitions destroyed by FileVault Short summary: User attempted to decrypt FileVault protection and got impatient; now can't get hard drive working at all. No file recovery needed (good backup, thank God), just need to get the hard drive to the point where I can actually work with it.\nI have another system with a similar 1 TB drive, and used gpt to manually copy its partition scheme to the problem drive; it won't mount (from klanomoath's assistance to another user).\nAlso tried initializing the disk using Windows (NTFS); partially successful. It almost looks like FileVault somehow still has hold of the drive, even though everything, including the partition map, has been overwritten. Can't figure out how to just write enough of a format onto the drive so that Disk Utility has a place to start.\nI just need to get this drive working, and don't care what data is destroyed. Can anyone tell me what I'm missing?\n\nA: I would highly recommend using Disk Maker X to create a bootable USB disk to reinstall OS X/macOS. Here's what you'll need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Another Mac with access to the App Store (if the one you're trying to fix doesn't function enough to complete the following steps.\n\n*A USB drive/stick with a capacity of at least 8 GB. Also be sure it has absolutely no data on it, since it will be formatted.\n\n*An internet connection in order to download Disk Maker X.\n\n\nFirst, download macOS Sierra on whichever Mac you're using by searching for it on the App Store, but don't install it! Next, download and install Disk Maker X on whichever Mac you're using. Then, open Disk Maker X and follow the steps listed. After that, make sure the Mac you're trying to fix is off. Plug in the USB Stick, then press Option and press the power key. Select the USB disk in the window that loads, follow the setup process, and you should be good to go! Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nA: There's always the brute force method. This should clear anything and everything on the drive no matter what Filevault or anything else did to it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect the drive to a working machine. Mac or Linux, either will work here, but we'll continue as if on a mac. This should also work from inside the installer, as you can get to both Disk Utility and a terminal from there.\n\n*Open Disk Utility, and note down which device the drive is using. On my personal system, this looks like:\n\nAnd the device name is \"disk0\" as shown on the bottom right. Make sure you have the main drive, not anything else under it. (That is, the drive itself, not any partitions). In my image, that's the \"Crucial LGT..\" not \"Macintosh HD\"\n\n*Open Terminal.\n\n*In your Terminal, become root with sudo su - and entering a password\n\n*Make sure you've closed disk utility - we're about to confuse it.\n\n*Run: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/DEVICENAME bs=1M\nFor the love of all things holy, make sure you get the device name right.\nThis will take a long time, but should throughly zero out the contents of the drive to allow it to be used with anything else.\nOnce this process finishes, reboot the machine. The drive should now be usable.\n", "Q: Unresponsive mouse wheel on macOS Sierra Since I upgraded to Sierra, mouse wheel scrolling has become a lot worse. When I scroll the wheel fast, it behaves like it did before and scrolls a bunch of lines, but when I scroll the wheel one notch at a time, nothing happens.\nI use a Steelseries Sensei gaming mouse but I also tested with a basic Dell mouse. (There's no model number on it.) As of macOS 10.12.1, this issue affects all programs.\nAre there any workarounds? Please don't suggest USB Overdrive or any other nagware.\nEdit: I found a video (not me) which shows the issue perfectly. Clearly it's not just me.\n\nA: I've looked for many solutions and USB Overdrive, is the only one that I've found that fixes it. Would love to hear if there are others, because I agree the nagware aspect is annoying (although it's only on boot, so it's not actually that bad).\nInstall it, then, in the settings, set \"Wheel up\" to scroll up \"2 lines\" and \"Wheel down\" to scroll down \"2 lines\". For whatever reason you have to use \"2 lines\"—\"one line\" still exhibits the issue. It's possible your mouse will require different settings. \n\nA: I've found this guy made an invisible app wich solves a problem.\nhttps://github.com/yolcu/discrete-scroll\nRuns in background and scroll 3 lines on tick.\n", "Q: How can I recover files off this disk that won't mount?

Block0 doesn't contain a file system!\n\nTo verify/repair a file system, you have to choose a particular partition and the volume has to be mounted. The common external disk has two partitions: the EFI and the main volume - so try:\nsudo fsck_hfs -f /dev/disk4s2\n\nIf the external disk has more than one visible volume, enter diskutil list and choose the appropriate partition (e.g disk4s3 or disk4s4).\n\nIf fsck_hfs fails to mount and/or repair the disk, try a data recovery tool like Data Rescue, R-Studio, Disk Drill etc.\nIf they also fail contact a professional data recovery specialist like Kroll Ontrack.\n", "Q: How to magnify OS X keyboard viewer? The keyboard viewer is so tiny, but it does not seem to be resizable (other than full screen, which hides what I want to type into!).\nTaking a screen image of it is awkward at best and when the result is magnified, not only does clarity suffer greatly, but you can't \"type\" by clicking on the image.  You can of course look at the image and click on the viewer (or just use the real keyboard) but that's not optimal either.\nIs there a way to make the actual keyboard viewer fully usable by someone with aging eyes, or must I settle for an irritating workaround?\n\nA: You should be able to make the Keyboard Viewer bigger by just click/dragging any of the corners.  \n", "Q: Where is documentation for CJK input methods (Its)? How the Chinese Pinyin IM & Japanese Kana IM work is obvious (at least to me) but I have been experimenting unsuccessfully for a while with one of the Korean ones.

If you start the directions to a location and then turn data off, Apple Maps too takes you there. However, I have seen this only when going to a place close by. Not sure of the behavior when going to a distance farther away - like going to another city altogether.\n\nA: There was a study about it recently and it compared the data used on average for 10 miles and for 20 minutes driven.\nGoogle Maps uses the less data, 0.67 MB every 10 miles and 0.73 MB every 20 minutes on average.\nOn the other side, Apple Maps uses 1.33 MB every 10 miles and 1.83 MB/20 minutes.\nIf you want to use less data you should turn off trafic data and satellite view.\nI’ve tested caching for long trips <60 miles and it worked in both apps, so you can use the one you prefer!\n", "Q: Keychain issues after Sierra I've updated to MacOS Sierra a few days ago, and it has been really unstable (a lot of freezes and hangs, specially in XCode).\nI noticed that in Console, the following two lines appear repeatedly, for different apps and services:\nswitching to keychain-db: /Users/user/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db from /Users/user/Library/Keychains/login.keychain (0 1 1 1)\nnot switching as we're not in ~/Library/Keychains/: /Library/Keychains/System.keychain (0)\n\nIs there any issue with keychain?

My iPhone 5S (16GB model) has 1.9 GB available of a total capacity of 12.1 GB. I see that the iOS 10 update requires 1.4 GB. But I am assuming I will get much of that back. Can anyone give me a specific amount?\nEdit: My iPhone is currently running iOS 8.1.3.\n\nA: Compared to iOS 8, iOS 10 seems to need about 300MB to 900MB of additional space. On the other hand, if your iPhone has automatically downloaded the iOS 10 installer, installing it will free up the space it is taking up. On my own iPhone, the installer is about 1.1GB. You may or may not have manually removed the installer (which is possible on iOS 9, I don’t remember whether it was on iOS 8). Depending on that, you will either gain some free space, or might lose quite some of it.\nThe Ars Technica review article on iOS 9 said:\n\nWith just a handful of exceptions, iOS 9 isn't going to give you space back, but, even when it does consume more space than iOS 8.4, its impact is negligible. You rarely lose more than 100 or 200MB.\n\nAnd, in comparing with iOS 9, the Ars Technica review article on iOS 10 says:\n\nOnce you convert the numbers to reflect the way iOS 10 reports storage capacity, what looked like an increase in available space is revealed to be a slight decrease. Usually it's somewhere between 200 and 700 megabytes, a drop in the bucket on a 64GB-and-up phone or tablet but a more significant fraction of a 16GB device's precious free space.\n\nSo combined, and with some exceptions, iOS 10 needs about 100MB+200MB to 200B+700MB of additional space compared to its two predecessors.\nNote that the iOS 10 review article mentions storage is now reported in base 10 rather than base 2, the article explains the details and how this was taken into account when comparing iOS 10 to iOS 9. (I’m afraid the above is mixing and adding base 2 and base 10 numbers, but the numbers are small enough for this not to matter much.)\n", "Q: If i sign out of the find my iphone app will the sound still go off?

So anyways, I got rid of the virus and thought everything was good, except the computer was very slow, so after a lot of Apple Support, I decided to wipe the hard drive, reinstalled OS X.

You may only have three that you are actively using, but there are dozens running in the background doing all sorts of things from indexing for Spotlight to watching for new software updates.\nRAM being used is not a bad thing, especially when you have so much free (per your screenshot). You paid for it as part of your computer; why wouldn't you want to use it?\nApple's support article states that unless the graph to the left is showing red (or, to a lesser degree, yellow) that you have absolutely nothing to worry about.\nGiven that your RAM usage is not particularly high, the sluggishness is likely coming from elsewhere. Even if you just look at pure numbers (which is absolutely not the way to read RAM information), you still have over a gigabyte of free RAM and zero swap-file usage.\n\nA: Okay, having taken a closer look at your screenshot it appears that spotlight is indexing your drive. \nDepending on the size of the drive, Spotlight indexing might take a day or two if you have a lot of files. This is because it makes a database of all these files so you can find them easily later.\nThis process should be a one time event, although doing a reformat/install like you have will trigger it again as you've wiped the drive.\nThis almost certainly is causing your computer to be sluggish. After indexing is complete, things should return to normal.\n\nA: Your memory looks great. Every bit of memory should be used to cache files and code and program data. Everything in your activity monitor image looks great and correct. \n\nIf you have slowness, no need won’t to look at memory until it’s in the red. Yellow lets you know you’re getting closer to red but still doesn’t slow down the system to swap. You’re safely in the green.\nNow that ram is set aside as a potential cause, for your performance question - you’ll want to look at things like network and CPU to be sure you don’t have a resource constraint before measuring the specific timings of specific applications to see what changes you make affect the performance. \nThe cpu tab is where you’ll want to look now that you know the ram numbers are not weird and at in fact correct and normal. \n", "Q: iCloud drive and git repository I have upgraded some of my Macs to Sierra. Now, I'm wondering whether I want to enable iCloud on the Document folder or not. It seems useful if it works well. I'm syncing some of the PDF files between iPad over iCloud, and my experience was \"so-so\" compared with Dropbox based sync (I'm using PDF expert on iPad).\nI'm particularly interested in how git repository work (or not work) well on the iCloud drive -- I have multiple Macs; I know the iCloud drive is slow in sync. \nDo you have any experience or recommendation on this?\n\nA: I imagine you'll to face the same issues as with Dropbox, when all the little files in the GIT repo are updated with every commit. I understand that the iCloud sync kicks in periodically, so you then depend on how reliable or quick it is (and it seems it can be variable). With Dropbox, I've found this can slow things up while the files are synced and even mess up a repo.\nI keep most of my repos in ~/Projects - after all, you can always pull and push (if your remote is on GitHub/BitBucket/etc.) from any machine. If you think it's worth trying, this blog post from 2014 suggests setting up a bare repo in iCloud.\nOverall, though, reading around suggests that we \"use a dedicated service for git repos designed to store git repos\". The aims of GIT and those of iCloud, Dropbox, etc. don't always play nicely with each other, especially if your connection is interrupted or the iCloud service is slow for some reason.\n\nA: I have had bad experiences with this, although specifically in the case of multiple macs syncing the same cloned repo.\nI have a couple of Macs onto which I clone a fair number of git (mostly GitHub) repos. The Macs each have a number of iCloud drive synced directories (in fact I've gone all-in and am syncing Desktop and Documents).\nI have tried to clone into the iCloud-synced directories. However, I have been having lots of problems with this. It seems very easy to get into a condition where iCloud (not git) gets so confused that one machine effectively stops syncing, even files that have nothing to do with the cloned directories, and even if I carefully re-sync each of the two clones to the exact same state. I don't know if the problem is files under .git/ or just something like race conditions between versions of the actual repo files.\nI've tried to use Apple's various iCloud logging tools under brctl but that has generally not helped.\n(Most of this has been posted as a question over on the main SO site: has anyone else seen this or anything like it?)\n(This is somewhat different from this question which mostly seems to care about a single Mac with iCloud drive, and I don't think users in that situation would see the same issues that I am.)\n\nA: As others said, there are plenty of issues with storing the git repo in a cloud service. My Mac was constantly syncing to iCloud due to me having an IntelliJ Java project in a folder being synced with iCloud Drive. My git repo was in the same IntelliJ project folder. My fan was spinning nearly constantly because the bird process was at 99% CPU usage constantly.\nI recently solved this for myself:\n\n*\n\n*Make a bare git repo in a folder synced to the cloud (spoiler: and push your current code into it).\n\n*Make a dev folder outside of the cloud folder. This folder should not be synced in the cloud. This is where you write code from this point on.\n\n*Pull from the bare repo to your dev folder.\n\n*Write code in the dev folder and push to the bare repo as a remote whenever you make a commit.\n\n*If needed, pull from the cloud synced bare git on other computers that you work on.\n\nThe above prevents the cloud storage application from constantly syncing all of the changes that occur when compiling in the project and committing to git. Only the pushes to the bare repo will get synced to the cloud, which reduces the cloud syncing activity.\nI push every time that I commit now. I think the files generated from the compilation and build process were the root issue for me.\n", "Q: Locking cells in numbers Is there an easy way to lock individual cells or a group of cells in Numbers to prevent the data in the cell from being changed?  \n\nA: The short answer is, no, however you can lock a table.\n\n\n*\n\n*To lock a Table, select it and then, from the Menu bar, click: Arrange > Lock\n\n\nThe longer answer is, if you want to protect* a cell or concurrent group of cells, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Overlay the target cell or concurrent group of cells with a rectangular shape.\n\n*Open the Inspector, click the Graphic tab, move the Opacity slider all the way to the left (0%).\n\n*Lock the shape in place, from the Menu bar, click: Arrange > Lock\n\n\nThis allows the contents of the cell or concurrent group of cells to be seen but not able to be modified unless the graphic shape is unlocked and either moved out of the way manually, set it to the back from the Arrange menu or remove it.\nTo relock the cell or concurrent group of cells bring the graphic shape back to the front from the Arrange menu or manually move it back, if it was moved, and then lock it again the Arrange menu.\nNote: * While the method proposed herein keeps one from directly mouse clicking a cell under the translucent shape, it does not stop one from clicking into an adjacent cell that is not under the translucent shape and tabbing to a cell underneath, then modifying it. This method is meant as a workaround to keep one from using the mouse directly on a cell underneath and as a reminder the cell(s) in question is(are) meant not to be modified as easily as any wide open cell.\n", "Q: Since running out of battery on my Mac, fonts are missing and apps don't open properly This first happened when I ran out of battery on my Mac. When I charged it, it was acting very weirdly. My desktop background is black and when I login the background is black. When I open Hamachi it says \"Failed to connect to engine\", Stuff is missing such as desktop pictures and letters that I used to see are now a box with a question mark \"[?]\".\n\nA: I would try resetting your SMC\nSystem Management Controller (SMC), a circuit that deals with power management, temperature monitoring and fan control, status lights, keyboard backlights, and a few other components. If your SMC becomes confused, you could experience problems like excessive fan noise, slow performance even though Activity Monitor doesn’t show the CPU being overtaxed, apps that take forever to launch, batteries that don’t charge correctly, problems with sleep or wake, and so on.\n\nBefore you can reset your SMC, you must shut down your Mac. After that, the procedure varies depending on the type of Mac you have.\n\n\n*\n\n*Desktop Macs: Disconnect the power cord (either from the Mac or from\nthe AC outlet). Wait 15 seconds and plug it back in. Then wait\nanother 5 seconds and turn the Mac back on.\n\n*Portable Macs with non-removable batteries: Make sure the Mac is\nplugged in to AC power. On the built-in keyboard, press and hold the\nShift, Option, and Control keys on the left side and press the power\nbutton. Release all the keys at once, and then turn the Mac on\nnormally.\n\n*Portable Macs with removable batteries: Disconnect the AC power cord\nand remove the battery. Press the power button, hold it for 5\nseconds, and then let go. Put the battery back in, reconnect the\npower cord, and turn the Mac on normally.\n\n\nYou can also try starting up in safe mode\nFollow these steps to start up into safe mode.\n\n\n*\n\n*Start or restart your Mac.\n\n*Immediately after you hear the startup sound, press and hold the\nShift key.\n\n*Release the Shift key when you see the Apple logo appear on the\nscreen.\n\n\nAfter the Apple logo appears, it might take longer than usual to reach the login screen or your desktop. This is because your Mac performs a directory check of your startup disk as part of safe mode.\nTo leave safe mode, restart your computer without pressing any keys during startup.\nIf you don't hear a startup chime after pressing the power key, see what to do if your Mac won't turn on.\nIf you're using FileVault\nIf your startup disk is encrypted with FileVault, you can still hold down the Shift key immediately after powering on your Mac to start up in safe mode. You might be prompted to log in twice as part of this process – first to unlock the startup disk, and a second time to log into the Finder. You can let go of the Shift key after you see the first login screen.\nIf an issue doesn't happen in safe mode\nIf an issue doesn't happen when your Mac is started in safe mode, try restarting again without pressing any keys at startup. If the issue appears to be resolved when you start up normally, it was possibly caused by a cache or a directory issue with your startup disk that safe mode fixed.\nIf you restart your Mac normally and an issue comes back when you reach your desktop, try disabling any login items that automatically open when you log in.\nIf your Mac restarts or shuts down in safe mode\nIf your Mac automatically restarts in safe mode, OS X might have found an issue that it's trying to fix. \nSafe mode performs a directory check of your startup disk, similar to what happens when you choose to verify or repair a disk using Disk Utility. If OS X finds an issue, the directory on your startup disk is repaired and your Mac restarts. \nIf your Mac turns itself off when you start up in safe mode, check the power connection on your Mac to make sure it's plugged in securely at both your Mac and the power outlet. If you're using a MagSafe power adapter, make sure the LED on your power adapter is yellow or green. Then, try starting up in safe mode again.\n", "Q: How to change the Organiser for Family Sharing I have set up Family Sharing on my daughter's iPad Pro and I am the Organiser. I also added my daughter as a family member. How can I delete myself as the Organiser and add my wife instead? I hope after doing that my wife can replace my bank details with hers.\n\nA: The only way to change the person who is responsible for the payment method (in other words, change the Organizer) is to turn off Family Sharing and have the new person start it over again.\nIn the Settings app go to iCloud then tap on Family, then your account in the list at the top, then Stop Sharing. This will disband the family.\nAt this point, your wife can go to the same location (Settings > iCloud > Family) to start Family Sharing again with her account as the Organizer. This will then use her selected payment method for any charges made by the Family members.\nYour daughter's account will have to be re-invited to the family. Your wife can also invite your account and once you accept, mark you as a Parent so that purchase requests from your daughter will go to both you and your wife.\n\nA: I believe you can just remove your payment info from your apple account and then have your wife add her payment info and she will be able you be the payee.\nYour Apple ID is the personal account that you use to access Apple services like the App Store, iTunes Store, iCloud, iMessage, the Apple Online Store, FaceTime, and more.

Around the time the 5s came out I went into AT&T to grab a new phone. For some reason I couldn't get logged into my apple account during setup so the AT&T employee completed the activation while using their account.\nEver since then when I did factory resets and after I entered my own apple credentials it would always ask me to log in with their account as well. Didn't bother me too much and I figured it was something particular to the phone.\nHowever, I just bought a new 7 and the same issue has come up! After I log in with my account it asks me to log in with this strangers account. Obviously the accounts are linked in some fashion but I've checked every single account setting I can and I have no idea how this could have happened. \nAnyone have any ideas?\nEdit: It's not a used phone, but were new out of the box at AT&T. Also, doesn't sounds like it's an activation lock because it has followed me across phones.

That would perhaps require a little mind-reading, to know which end you wanted to work from ;-)\nFor your specific situation, if you start with  Shift ⇧  held, then  Cmd ⌘   → , then just  →  - 'to end of line plus one character'\nAlternatively, holding  Shift ⇧ , then  ↓  followed by a number of  Opt ⌥   ←  would be quicker than just  ←  - 'to middle of line below minus several words, one at a time'\n", "Q: App promo codes - do they renew?
