Kinda like search and replace, except I have to search for expression not character, because 1 is written is other expressions I don't want to change. and I want to change the value of 1 per line. Each expression is on a new line.\n\nA: Vim has a way to increment a number automatically: <c-a> (or Ctrla) in normal mode.\nSo, using a macro, it is fairly easy to construct an increasing sequence of numbers in Vim. Start at the line containing a+ 1 =b and a+1=c and:\nqq\nYp^Aw^A\nq\n\nThe ^A stands for pressing Ctrla. Then use @q to repeat the macro. So 4@q would produce:\na + 1 =b and a+1=c\na + 2 =b and a+2=c\na + 3 =b and a+3=c\na + 4 =b and a+4=c\na + 5 =b and a+5=c\n\n\n\n*\n\n*qq starts the macro (q) saving in the register q.\n\n*Y yanks the current line (linewise)\n\n*p pastes and you end up at the beginning of the next (formerly current) line.\n\n*<c-a> you increment the first number in the line (and the cursor moves to it)\n\n*so you move to the next word and increment again (w<c-a>), this time affecting the second number.\n\n\nA: Besides using a macro you could also use find and replace\nyy2p\n:%s/\\v\\d+/\\=line('.')/g\n\n\n\n*\n\n*yy2p yanks the line and past it two times\n\n*:%s tarts a search and replace\n\n*\\v\\d+ searches for all numeric characters\n\n*\\=line('.') evaluates the line function as replacement for all matches\n\n\nyet another option is\n:pu! =map(range(1,3), 'printf(''a + %d =b and a+%d=c'', v:val, v:val)')\n\nhard to remember but you don't have to yank, search or macro anything.

However, I am not sure how I might have properly searched for the answer to this question (and obviously I should learn to search previously answered questions better to not bother people in the future). I cannot imagine what the right search string is (googling how to read in files and rename them in Linux is awfully generic and I waded through suggestions not germane to this sort of file format manipulation).\n\nA: You can use capture groups and backreferences e.g.\nrename -vn -- 's/\\.(pdb)\\.(\\d+)/_$2.$1/' *.pdb.*\n\nto match a literal period \\. followed by (literal) string pdb, followed by a second period \\. and then a sequence of one or more digits \\d+, copying the string and digit sequence into numbered capture groups $1 and $2 respectively and then re-substituting them in reverse order with an underscore in place of the first period.\nOptions -v and -n are for verbose output (listing any changes made) and no-operation, allowing you to test the correctness before committing to making any actual substitutions: you will need to remove the n option to actually apply the changes.\nThe -- marks the end of command options - this just makes the command more robust in the rare case that you have filenames that start with a hyphen.\n\nTesting it in a directory containing files file.pdb.1 file.pdb.2 file.pdb.3 file.pdb.4 file.pdb.5 (among others):\n$ rename -vn -- 's/\\.(pdb)\\.(\\d+)/_$2.$1/' *.pdb.*\nfile.pdb.1 renamed as file_1.pdb\nfile.pdb.2 renamed as file_2.pdb\nfile.pdb.3 renamed as file_3.pdb\nfile.pdb.4 renamed as file_4.pdb\nfile.pdb.5 renamed as file_5.pdb\n\n\nA: The strictest way possible, so that only filenames starting with file.pdb. followed by at least a digit will be renamed, using rename:\nrename -n 's/(file)(\\.pdb)\\.([0-9]+)/$1_$3$2/' *\n\nIf the result is the expected one, remove the -n option:\nrename 's/(file)(\\.pdb)\\.([0-9]+)/$1_$3$2/' *\n\n\nA: Apart from excellent rename answers you have received already, you can use bash parameter expansion:\nfor i in *.pdb.*; do mv -i \"$i\" \"${i%%.pdb.*}_${i##*.}.pdb\"; done\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The pattern ${i%%.pdb*} will get the file portion of name file.pdb.#\n\n*${i##*.} will get the digits after .pdb.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04: New user created from command line has missing features I am trying to create a new user in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS from the bash command line.

But according to the django book, this is where django-admin should be.\n\nA: There are a number of different ways in which you can install Django depending upon your needs and how you want to configure your development environment.\n\n\n*\n\n*Global Install from Packages:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install python-django\n\nYou can test that the installation was successful by typing:\ndjango-admin --version\n\n\n*Global Install through pip:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nNow you can install pip. If you plan on using Python version 2, install using the following commands:\nsudo apt-get install python-pip\n\nIf, instead, you plan on using Python 3, use this command:\nsudo apt-get install python3-pip  \n\nNow that you have pip, we can easily install Django. If you are using Python 2, you can type:\nsudo pip install django\n\nIf you are using Python 3, use the pip3 command instead:\nsudo pip3 install django\n\nYou can verify that the installation was successful by typing:\ndjango-admin --version\n\n\n*Global Install through pip.\n\n*Global Install through pip.\n\n\nfull Details and all rights goes to the owner from digitalOcean\n", "Q: Am able to log in via ssh but not able to use scp in ubuntu 14.04 reinstall I am able to log in via ssh but not able to use scp in ubuntu 14.04 after reinstall.

As long as you are sure you have the right system, you can remove the entry for that host on line 21 of the /home/dynamix/.ssh/known_hosts file.

I have an intel 64 bit CPU. I am wondering can I install this version: ubuntu-14.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso\nI really want to install the 64 bit version. But the name contains amd, so I am not sure if it's compatible with my machine. Thank you!\n\nA: AMD64 is the same as x86-64, just another name for the same architecture - it doesn't have to do anything with actual cpu vendor. \nQuoted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64:\n\nx86-64 (also known as x64, x86_64 and AMD64) is the 64-bit version of\n  the x86 instruction set\n.... .....\nThe original specification was\n  created by AMD, and has been implemented by AMD, Intel and VIA.\n  Various names are used for the instruction set; prior to the launch,\n  x86-64 and x86_64 were used, while upon the release AMD named it AMD64\n\nQuoted from https://askubuntu.com/a/84775/150504\n\nIt's merely a convention due to the fact that AMD created the 64-bit\n  extensions to the x86 (Intel 386/486/Pentium) instruction set. At that\n  time, Intel was pushing Itanium as the only 64-bit solution, and Intel\n  didn't copy AMD's extensions until it was clear that AMD had created\n  something that was being used widely. The #define AMD64 was used to\n  distingish this 64-bit instruction set from Intel's Itanium\n  instruction set.\n\n\nA: Yes, you can install it - amd64 (sometimes called x64) is the name of the architecture and it's not made specifically for AMD CPUs.\n", "Q: Turn .vmwarevm into .iso I was wondering if anyone knows how to take the .vmwarevmand the files inside it and turn it into an .iso.

I don't want to mess up my system. Some concrete advice required here.\n\nA: If you don’t create a separate home partition while installing Ubuntu, you don’t have to reinstall Ubuntu from scratch.

If the window (the file) already occurs in the list, its chronological position is updated. Furthermore, the script deletes all (oldest) windows when the list exceeds a length of ten (windows). \n\n\nIf the list of recently used windows changes, the list is written to a hidden file in your home directory.\nScript [2] reads the hidden file, created and updated by scrip1 [1].

It must've been available for a long time now but v3.36.2 has it for sure.\n", "Q: Ubuntu first login I've installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my windows using wubi installer. It installed successfully and when I first login, there's only the terminal is available. I've logged in by entering my user name and there waits an error. The home directory itself isn't created for me.

Is there a way to add our own color scheme to it? \n\nA: You can add CSS themes into the directory:\n/usr/share/notepadqq/editor/libs/codemirror/theme\n\nAll the themes are stored in there (Except the Deafult, which can be found at /usr/share/notepadqq/editor/libs/codemirror/lib/codemirror.css). The syntax seems relatively simple if you wanted to create your own.\nIf anyone knows where I can find a Notepad++ 'Default Theme' replica, I'd be forever gratefull :D\n\nA: I'm not 100% sure it's the same method, but for Notepad++ you can do this by using the Settings > Style Configurator... menu, in the top menu bar. There should be an option to create your own.  There are a bunch of default themes: In the settings menu > Preferences > Appearance > Color Scheme (drop down menu).\n\nA: As of 5th October 2020, the below works :\n\n*\n\n*Set the env variable :\nexport QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct\n\n\n*Install qt5ct and run it. Within qt5ct(qt5 config tool), you can change the theme for qt5.

(This wrong time is UTC, don't know if this is coincidence).\nI do have a dual boot with windows, but I don't think that is the problem, because in my config file /etc/default/rcS the entry for UTC is already set to no.\nAnyone have an idea?\nhwclock from util-linux 2.20.1\nUsing /dev interface to clock.\nLast drift adjustment done at 1396258906 seconds after 1969\nLast calibration done at 1396258906 seconds after 1969\nHardware clock is on UTC time\nAssuming hardware clock is kept in UTC time.\nWaiting for clock tick...\n...got clock tick\nTime read from Hardware Clock: 2015/07/02 09:10:34\nHw clock time : 2015/07/02 09:10:34 = 1435828234 seconds since 1969\nThu 02 Jul 2015 11:10:34 CEST  -0.516481 seconds\n\n\nA: \nHardware clock is on UTC time\n\nIf your hardware clock is using UTC time, the system needs to know it! Change the UTC configuration of the clock in the /etc/default/rcS file to yes. The system will presume your clock is UTC and apply offset accordingly. Of course, your clock should also have the correct time. Once this is set, with hwclock --set --date=\"02/07/2015 10:21:00\" (--date should be provided with the local time, even if the hardware clock use UTC) your system should use the correct time. Now you can use ntp daemon, for example to keep your clock on time.\n\nA: Try sudo ntpdate -u time.nist.gov. ntpd is probably running already on that port so it needs to use a different one.  Windows assumes clock is in local time when it updates the clock from ntp. Your Linux is assuming it's in UTC.\n\nA: Ok, for future reference, here is the final solution (with some help from the other answers).\nThe problem was that the hardware clock was wrong, and that apparently due to firewall issues the ubuntu clock can't update automatically. \nThe time of the hardware clock can be changed, either manually by doing\nsudo hwclock --set --date=\"02/07/2015 10:21:00\"\n\nfor example (with date in local time), or by connecting to time keeping servers online (which didn't work for me because of the firewall issues)\nsudo ntpdate -u time.nist.gov\n\nThen the System Time of the Ubuntu kernel still has to be updated to this new time, otherwise the time shown will still be wrong, and, more importantly, Ubuntu will overwrite the new hardware time again. This is easily done with\nsudo hwclock -s\n\n\nA: First check you have corretc time zone, run the command:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata\n\nif tzdata is not installed:\nsudo apt-get install tzdata\n\nYou can now sync and correct your time settings with command ntpdate:\nsudo ntpdate time.nist.gov\n\nhere you can find a list of time servers around world : http://www.pool.ntp.org/ \nCheck this answer https://askubuntu.com/a/641160/150504 for more information \n", "Q: Alienware 14 (Mid 2013) Ubuntu 15.04 switch off lights I am a new Ubuntu user and have 15.04 version.

I have a box installed in a network with no Internet access with the exception of OpenVPN to my server. Everything else is blocked leaving the LAN segment the box is on.\nThe box opens a connection to my VPN server, so now I have p2p1 and tun0. The setup for /etc/network/interfaces is:\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The primary network interface\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.56.211\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    gateway 192.168.56.251\n    dns-nameservers 192.168.100.20 192.168.50.35\n\nThe OpenVPN connection comes up and connects as you would expect, allowing me to SSH into the box via the VPN from outside the LAN.

I an cope with it being limited like that, but ideally I just want to fix it so the routes are correct!\n\nA: In my case, eth1 is the device I want to be an available gateway on my LAN, and ppp0 is the name of my VPN connection when it's active on that machine (connects via eth0 but for deadswitch security we won't name it in the routing).\nSetup your IPtables for NAT from the LAN to the VPN-connected gateway:\niptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE\niptables -A FORWARD -i ppp0 -o eth1 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\niptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o ppp0 -j ACCEPT\n\nRemember to save your iptables and activate IP forwarding.\n", "Q: Remove duplicated dots from file name I have a dir with tons of files inside which have been named in malformed such as file..txt ,file2..txt ,etc...\nSo how to easily remove this second . from file names?\nAny applicable method is appreciated including awk,sed,grep,etc...\n\nA: Using rename (as per heemayl's suggestion I narrowed down the globbing only to filenames ending exactly with ..txt):\nrename -n 's/(.*)\\./$1/' *..txt\n\nThis will match the filename until the last dot and replace the match with everything but the last dot.\nIf the result is the expected one, remove the -n option:\nrename 's/(.*)\\./$1/' *..txt\n\n\nA: I have a working solution, still working for better one:\nfor f in *; do mv $f ${f%.txt}txt; done\n\nThank to @heemayl note:\n\nRather than using *, use *..txt to get the files as only * will cause\n  problem when you have any file without . and with only one\n\nSo becomes:\nfor f in *..txt; do mv $f ${f%.txt}txt; done\n\n\nA: Another rename variant:\nrename 's/\\Q.././' *..txt\n\nusing \\Q avoids escaping the dots (See http://perldoc.perl.org/perlretut.html)\n\nA: You may try the reverse order.

Can I create a new ext4 encrypted partition with kernel 4.1 on Ubuntu 15.04?\n\nA: Linux 4.1 comes with a new Ext4 feature to encrypt directories of a filesystem. Encryption keys are stored in the keyring. To get started, make sure you have enabled CONFIG_KEYS and CONFIG_EXT4_FS_ENCRYPTION kernel options and you have kernel 4.1 or higher.\nFirst of all, you need to update e2fsprogs to at least version 1.43, which is still WIP at the time of writing so we need to fetch it from the git repository:\n$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/fs/ext2/e2fsprogs.git\n\ne4crypt source has disabled a relevant section in its source code, enable it by editing misc/e4crypt.c and removing these two lines near line 714:\n    printf(\"arg %s\\n\", argv[optind]);\n    exit(0);\n\nNow build and install new e2fsprogs:\n$ sudo apt-get install devscripts build-essential gettext texinfo pkg-config debhelper m4\n$ debuild\n$ sudo dpkg -i e2fsprogs_1.43-WIP_amd64.deb\n\nCheck your version now, it should be 1.43-WIP:\n# e2fsck -V\ne2fsck 1.43-WIP (18-May-2015)\n        Using EXT2FS Library version 1.43-WIP, 18-May-2015\n\nTo work with keys, we need to install the keyutils package:\n$ sudo apt-get install keyutils\n\nLet's make a directory that we will encrypt. Encryption policy can be set only on empty directories:\n$ sudo mkdir -p /encrypted/dir\n\nFirst generate a random salt value and store it in a safe place:\n$ head -c 16 /dev/random | xxd -p\n877282f53bd0adbbef92142fc4cac459\n\nNow generate and add a new key into your keyring: this step should be repeated every time you flush your keychain (reboot)\n$ sudo e4crypt -S 0x877282f53bd0adbbef92142fc4cac459\nEnter passphrase (echo disabled): \nAdded key with descriptor [f88747555a6115f5]\n\nNow you know a descriptor for your key. Make sure you have added a key into your keychain:\n$ keyctl show\nSession Keyring\n1021618178 --alswrv   1000  1000  keyring: _ses\n 176349519 --alsw-v   1000  1000   \\_ logon: ext4:f88747555a6115f5\n\nAlmost done. Now set an encryption policy for a directory:\n$ e4crypt set_policy f88747555a6115f5 /encrypted/dir\n\nThat's all. If you try accessing the disk without adding a key into keychain, filenames and their contents will be seen as encrypted gibberish. Be careful running old versions of e2fsck on your filesystem - it will treat encrypted filenames as invalid.\n\nA: First off a disclaimer: I've not done this with Ubuntu, but on a machine with Debian \"Stretch\" installed using a custom Linux 4.2.3 kernel that I enabled EXT4_FS_ENCRYPTION on.\nThe instructions given by kmeaw don't work for me exactly as posted.  A few things were left out (command line parameters and steps).\n\n\n*\n\n*Update e2fsprogs as shown above\n\n*Generate your random salt.  I used the following to store it in a \"safe place\":\nhead -c 16 /dev/urandom | xxd -p >~/tmp-salt.txt\necho 0x`cat ~/tmp-salt.txt` >~/.cryptoSalt\n\n\n*In order to use ext4 encryption on the file system, the \"encrypt\" flag must be set in the super-block.  This is not the default when the ext4 file system is created.  Using the \"tune2fs\" utility from e2fsprogs 1.43 or later, set the \"encrypt\" option:\nsudo tune2fs -O encrypt /dev/sda4\n\n\n*Mount or remount the file system so the kernel knows about the change (maybe it's automatic, but I have only done this on a separate partition, so I'm not sure.)\n\n*Create a directory on the file system that is mounted with encryption enabled:\nsudo mkdir -p /secret/home/$USER\nsudo chown $USER:$USER /secret/home/$USER\n\n\n*Create the key in the keyring and use it to set the policy for the directory to be encrypted (the sudo command is not needed here):\n$ /usr/sbin/e4crypt add_key -S s:`cat ~/.cryptoSalt`\nEnter passphrase (echo disabled):\nAdded key with descriptor [0132fed69f946c86]\n$ /usr/bin/e4crypt set_policy 0132fed69f946c86 /secret/home/$USER\nKey with descriptor [0132fed69f946c86] applies to /secret/home/theuser.\n\n\n*After each reboot, the add_key command can be used set the key for decryption of the directory and its descendants:\n$ /usr/sbin/e4crypt add_key -S s:`cat ~/.cryptoSalt`\nEnter passphrase (echo disabled):\nAdded key with descriptor [0132fed69f946c86]\n\nEnter the same password used in the previous step, and you don't have to remember the descriptor hex string.\n\n*You can also use add_key directly. This will use a filesystem specific salt (So all folders under that partition will have the same salt)\n$ /usr/sbin/e4crypt add_key /secret/home/$USER\nAdded key with descriptor [0132fed69f946c86]\nKey with descriptor [0132fed69f946c86] applies to /secret/home/theuser.\n\n", "Q: Can't Boot Into Windows XP I set up Ubuntu 14.04LTS on an old Dell Laptop as a dual booting system.  I have attempted to boot into WindowsXP on startup just to see if it would work and it gives me a blue screen saying that \"windows has been shut down to protect...\"\nI don't really need to boot into Windows, I just know that you are supposed to be able to, it boots into Ubuntu without an issue.  Is there something I could do to get past the error?  I am not an expert but I could successfully follow any instructions that this community is willing to give me, thank you.\n\nA: First of all, you can try to update grub (command update-grub).\nIf this didn't work, you can try to boot from a windows cd and do a repair install. Afterwards (as windows will have destroyed your grub boot loader), you need to reinstall grub from a linux live cd.\nIf you don't want to risk your data, create an image first. You may also want to mount that image inside a virtualbox container - if you don't really need to boot into windows anyway, this may be a more useful option.\n", "Q: How do I get IP of installed network printer I have installed a network printer in my Ubuntu 14.04 machine by using system-config-printer. This GUI program offers a \"Find network printer\" function, that explores the local network. It returns a list of printers names, associated with IP adresses.\nSo let's say I choose one and successfully install it.\nNow after a while I realize the one I installed is the wrong printer. So I do the process again, and... oh wait, there are several printers of same type (and name), with different IP adresses!\nOk, no problem, lets just check the IP of the one I just installed, so I make sure I don't install the wrong one again. So the question is: how to I get the IP of an installed printer ?\nApparently, the \"properties\" dialog (sample below) does not give access to this information (no, its not hidden in the URI line).\nNo success either by using the CUPS webserver through http://localhost:631, it seems to be basically another way of getting the same information.\nEdit: the question isn't related to the printer below but is more general: as the OS is able to fetch the printer's IP at the network exploring step, I assume that information is stored somewhere. Where is it stored and how do I access it ? Or maybe it isn't stored anywhere ?\n\n\nA: According to the HP Laserjet 2400-series User Guide, the IP address is available on the control panel of the printer itself.\n\n\nA: Look at the arp-scan command (similar to ip neigh). You will probably have to install it:\nsudo apt-get install arp-scan\n\nAnd to give further detail:\nsudo arp-scan --interface=eth0 --localnet\n\nWhere eth0 is your device (or wlan0 or wlp2s0). You can find your device with ifconfig or:\nip -c addr\n\n\nOr try installing nmap (sudo apt-get install nmap) and type nmap 192.168.1.0/24 substituting 192.168.1 with the first three parts of your ip address (find out using ip addr).\n\nA: lpstat -s\n\nSometimes it doesn't have to be complicated.\n\nA: A bit late but this might help.\navahi-browse --all -t -r\n\nA: To expands on @JUH's solution above... \navahi-browse --all -t -r\n\nIs the proper solution for autodiscover printers.\nUnfortunately many printers simply don't expose their IP address in any usable form to you, the end user.  This is by design. https://www.cups.org/doc/network.html\n\nMost network printers support a protocol known as Bonjour, which is a combination of zero-configuration networking (ZeroConf), multicast DNS (mDNS), and DNS service discovery (DNS-SD) standards published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the same group that defined TCP/IP and all of the networking we use today\n\nQuoting the mDNS page:\n\nWhen an mDNS client needs to resolve a hostname, it sends an IP multicast query message that asks the host having that name to identify itself. That target machine then multicasts a message that includes its IP address. All machines in that subnet can then use that information to update their mDNS caches. Any host can relinquish its claim to a name by sending a response packet with a time to live (TTL) equal to zero.\n\nSo to properly find the IP address of an mDNS printer, you'd need a tool capable of reading the cache.\nQuoting one of the OP's comments:\n\nThanks. In my case, lpoptions shows indeed a lot of info, but not the IP. The concerned field looks like device-uri=hp:/net/hp_LaserJet_2420?zc=HP2420ROOMXXX, so again the same as what I get from GUI tools. So I assume the IP isn't stored in my machine... \n\nThis makes avahi-browse the best tool for the job... (or if you got here looking for a Mac utility, Apple offers one called dns-sd)\nQuoting the Avahi page:\n\nAvahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local network via the mDNS/DNS-SD protocol suite. This enables you to plug your laptop or computer into a network and instantly be able to view other people who you can chat with, find printers to print to or find files being shared. Compatible technology is found in Apple MacOS X (branded \"Bonjour\" and sometimes \"Zeroconf\").\nAvahi is primarily targetted at Linux systems and ships by default in most distributions. It is not ported to Windows at this stage, but will run on many other BSD-like systems. The primary API is D-Bus and is required for usage of most of Avahi, however services can be published using an XML service definition placed in /etc/avahi/services.\nSee also the nss-mdns project, which allows hostname lookup of *.local hostnames via mDNS in all system programs using nsswitch\n\n\nA: Using lpoptions\nlpoptions  -p <printer_name> | awk '{for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) {if ($i ~ /device-uri/) {print $i}}}'\n\n\nExample\n$ lpoptions  -p TOSHIBA_e-STUDIO2330C | awk '{for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) {if ($i ~ /device-uri/) {print $i}}}'\ndevice-uri=socket://192.168.20.43\n\n\nTo get an overview lpinfo\nExample\n$ lpinfo -v | grep -P '://'\nnetwork dnssd://HP%20LaserJet%201022n._pdl-datastream._tcp.local/\nnetwork dnssd://TOSHIBA%20e-STUDIO2540C-07279076._printer._tcp.local/\nnetwork socket://192.168.20.201\nnetwork socket://192.168.20.203\nnetwork socket://192.168.20.204\nnetwork socket://192.168.20.205\nnetwork socket://192.168.20.206\nnetwork socket://192.168.20.207\nnetwork socket://192.168.20.43\n\nor nmap\nnmap -sT <adress_or_address_range>\n\nand grep the service printer\nExample\n$ nmap -sT 192.168.20.43\n\nStarting Nmap 6.47 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2015-07-03 08:38 CEST\nNmap scan report for 192.168.20.43\nHost is up (0.0017s latency).\nNot shown: 991 closed ports\nPORT     STATE SERVICE\n21/tcp   open  ftp\n25/tcp   open  smtp\n80/tcp   open  http\n139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn\n445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds\n515/tcp  open  printer\n631/tcp  open  ipp\n8080/tcp open  http-proxy\n9100/tcp open  jetdirect\n\n\nA: \nI am also using ubuntu14.04.

To my surprise, Ubuntu works perfectly from the HDD. No shutdown or restart issues.\nUPDATE 1\nI reinstalled Ubuntu on the second Disk (HDD) and it started to behave exactly as on the SSD. I try to restart or shutdown and immediately it freezes and I cannot do anything unless I force shutdown.\nIs there anything wrong with my current install or it's just something related to my computer? \nEdit I get same issues from the Live USB (Try Ubuntu)!\nUPDATE 2\nUbuntu 15.04 live USB: same shutdown and restart problem.\nSo it seems that it is something related specific with my system.\nBut what is it?  \nUPDATE 3\nReinstalled Ubuntu, and now I have Grub on my EFI partition. Also, removed the second HDD (from the DVD bay), so now I have only Windows 8 and Ubuntu 14.04 installed on the SSD. I have also re-did the boot-info and updated the link.\nNow, another problem is that I have started to get kinda randomly freezes and 100% hangs at shutdown and restart. It's just getting to the point of getting to my nerves! What is going on of this whole mess?\n\nBoot-info report: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1181907689/ \n\nMy system:\nLaptop Asus N56jr, Intel i7 4th gen,  16GB RAM, 500GB Samsung 850 Evo,\nNvidia GeForce GTX 760M.\nOs: Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04  \nCurrently, I have the latest Bios update and could not find any update for my SSD firmware.\n\nA: So, after lots and lots of tests I may have figured it out. I updated the kernel from 3.16 to 3.18 and then I also installed the latest Nvidia driver tha shows in the Ubuntu Software Center. Although it's not the latest Nvidia driver I think that was my problem to begin with. \nI also tried installing the latest Nvidia straight from the Nvidia website but I just get error after error. First it tells me that I don't have the right GPU for the driver, then I got the runnig X server and then something related to a failed script.\nSo, right now I will try Ubuntu like crazy and see what happens next.\nUPDATE - Victory!!! - Nvidia updated driver solved my problems\nI just reinstalled Ubuntu (just for the sake of finding out what was going on) and of course the shutdown/restart hang reappeared. That meant I could recreate the problem. So, I tried restarting a few times with no success. Then, I did a Software Update which installed a bunch of updates but kept my the current 3.16 kernel. And shutdown and restart were still not working. I then went to Additional Drivers and updated the Nvidia driver to the proprietary and tested driver. Restart and VOILA!!! Is working fine. In the end the 3.18 kernel did nothing to help my problem!\nSo, if you are having Ubuntu freezes/hangs while trying to restart or shutdown, there's a big chance you are having some kind of driver problem!\n", "Q: Cannot open shell script files on ubuntu 15.04 On ubuntu 15.04 64 bit, I cannot properly run a .sh file shell script file.

Thank you.\n\nA: Are you sure the executable flag is set for that file?\nYou can also run it from command line even without the executable flag set:\nsource <path/yourscript.sh>\n\nAlso, you should make sure that the first line of the script is #!/bin/sh or #!/bin/bash.\n", "Q: How to install ATI Radeon HD5470 proprietary drivers on Ubuntu 14.04? I seem to have a problem with the drivers. I tried everything. Every single fix that I found on this forum and I can't install the proprietary graphic drivers for my ATI Radeon HD 5470.\nWhen I go to additional drivers - I have 3 options: \n\n\n*\n\n*Default\n\n*Fglrx\n\n*Fglrx-update\n\n\nWhenever I try to install some of the 2 or 3, When i restart my laptop, it gives me error: \nLow graphic mode\n\nand I can't start my pc unless I boot into recovery and remove the whole Fglrx packages.\nI tried downloading and installing from the ATI website, no luck. Still the same error. Can someone tell me what am I doing wrong?\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem. I used the following technique\nFirstly remove all previously installed drivers :\nsudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx fglrx-amdcccle\n\nNow install them fresh :\nsudo apt-get install fglrx fglrx-amdcccle\n\nAfter the installation is done use the command given below\nsudo amdconfig --initial\n\nNow reboot your system. Your computer will have drivers and Catalyst Control Center. As the command sudo amdconfig --initial is very important as i found it on amd web site some while ago.\nNote: if you don't want to waste lots of time on downloading and installing firstly try this command  sudo amdconfig --initial and restart. It may work. But i had to uninstall everything so use the whole post i described.\nIt should definitely work. Best of luck\n\nA: I have had same problem first you have to install flgrx update, and then reboot it give the error, and then you have to enter the tty push Ctrl + alt + f6, and then you have to type this in the tty:\n     sudo apt-get install lxde\n\nand then this\n     startx\n\nand it starts the LXDE, and then enter start button and use preferencs, and then the upper gfx card Adm menu, and set every thing to default, and then you can reboot and Ubuntu works whit the flgrx update.\n", "Q: Thunderbird: Show mails from sender - easy and fast Imagine you read a mail from \"Dr. Foo Bar\".\nNow you want to see all mails send from or to him.\nHow do you do this?\nI only know the complicated way: \n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrlshiftf search for mails in \"from\" (with annoying typing the mail address again)\n\n*Ctrlshiftf search for mails in \"to\"\n\n\nWhy is there not such an entry in the context menu of the mail sender?\nIs there no easy to use way to jump from reading a mail from \"Dr Foo Bar\" to a list of all messages from/to him?\nUpdate\nMails can be stored in different folders. Solutions which only work for one folder won't help me.\n\nA: To search all emails in all folders, sent to or from a particular email address:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on an email address and select \"Copy Email Address\"\n\n*Right click on the [Search... <Ctrl+K>] box  select Paste, then Enter or just type CtrlK, CtrlV, and Enter\nHowever, you might not like Thunderbird's default search results view.\n\nIf you prefer the view when you click on \"Open email as list\", shown below\n\nthen the best solution is to install a Thunderbird plugin, which will make this the default.\n\n\n*\n\n*From the menu select Tools > Add-ons\n\n*Type \"search as\" into the search box\n\n*Click the install button next to Search as list 3.0\n\n*Restart Thunderbird\n\n\nA: You might consider the quicker quicksearch add-on. It allows you to right-click on a message in the message list and immediately do a search in the quick search box for that sender's email address or domain. There are some things to note:\n\n*\n\n*The Ctrl-Alt-H keyboard shortcut doesn't work in some versions of Thunderbird.\n\n*It includes the display name in the search, not just the email address.\n\n*The domain search parses the address poorly, so you may end up with example.com> in the search box.\n\n*You can't right-click on the sender address in the message panel; only right-clicking in the message list works.\n\nThat said, it does this one job pretty well in my experience.\n\nA: I don't think there's an easy way to see both send from and to in a single window.\nBut you can easily sort by sender from your inbox view, just select an email from that person and click on the From header:\n\nYou can do the same in your \"Sent\" folder too.\n", "Q: How can I partitioned may SEAGATE hard drive on Ubuntu 14.40 LTS?

See, in the New partition tab is inactive. Now how can I do this . Plz advice me. Thnanks.\n\n\nA: You need to unmount the drive by right clicking the ntfs partition and click unmount. Then you will be able to shrink the current partition or delete the drive and make the new ones you want.\n.\nEdit:: To rename the dive you right click the dive and click label., then a popup windows will appear and there is where you can set the drive name.  You can also rename each partition that way as well if you can \n", "Q: Bash Script to search a webpage I've Googled my problem, and it's getting more confusing. \nI want to write a bash script that will search this page for a specific string and echo if it's found. For example, if I wanted to search for the string \"Game Developer\", which exists on the page, it would echo \"Found Game Developer!\" \nI'm not sure where to even begin. I'm using Lubuntu 14.04.2 LTS \nThe best I could come up with is this:\nwget -q -O- http://www.centennialcollege.ca/programs-courses/centres-institutes/applied-research-and-innovation/for-students/job-postings/ | grep -c \"Game Developer\"\n\n\nA: I's switch to using grep's -q argument. This just exits with zero if it finds something. This allows you to use traditional exit-code logic like && or || to chain on actions.\nwget -qO- http://www.centennialcollege.ca/programs-courses/centres-institutes/applied-research-and-innovation/for-students/job-postings/ \\\n| grep -q \"Game Developer\" \\\n&& echo \"Found Game Developer\"\n\nOnly just read the comments. If you want the count, -c (as you've done) is as good as you'll get but if you do only need a boolean output, -q is faster as it exits 0 as soon as it first matches, rather than going on to find future matches.\nIf you want to capture and output the count, split it in two:\nCOUNT=$(wget -qO- http://www.centennialcollege.ca/programs-courses/centres-institutes/applied-research-and-innovation/for-students/job-postings/ | grep -c \"Game Developer\")\necho \"Found $COUNT game developers\"\n\n", "Q: LXD and Juju management Would it be practical to create LXD containers on different servers and in the container use Ubuntu and juju?  If it is, could juju see LXD containers as different machines?\n\nA: LXD containers\nThere is a LXD provider in the works for Juju. It was demoed recently: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyXLRDN0ERo You can see the blueprints and test it by building from the feature branch. afaik, it currently doesn't have support for creating LXD containers on multiple machines.\nLXC containers\nWhat you currently can do, however, is create LXC containers on multiple machines. To deploy wordpress to a new lxc container on machine 1 you run juju deploy wordpress --to lxc:1. This will create a new lxc container on machine 1 and deploy wordpress into it.\nHow the container is networked depends on the type of environment. Maas will set up networking for you. In manual provider, the container is on a private network with the host machine (so containers on machines other than 0 will not be accessible by Juju). However, in manual provider you can hack around this by letting the containers dhcp to the host network. I made a Charm that bridges the network of lxc containers to the host network.\n", "Q: Installation bug in mysql-server-5.6 E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1) I'm trying to remove mysql-workbench.

I tried it on my laptop just to see what would happen and I could never get Ubuntu to install. \nI always recommend setting up partitions manually (if you know how) as well, and install from that route.

The helpful link above I followed pretty much verbatim.\nFirst, I did have to setup my swap file to be sure it would be used to store files during a hibernate in order for it to resume later.  For that I used the info in this link:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq\nAs far as Rhythmbox losing its library after reboot I was able to overcome this issue as well.  I believe the main issue here was the linked files becoming unlinked during the reboot, an issue that really has nothing to do with Rhythmbox or any other music player/manager.\nHowever the issue is related to a dual boot Win7/Linux system. I did not have the NTFS volume, where the library (actual music files) were located configured or set to mount upon reboot.  There were a few other things I learned along the way.\nIn order to solve this issue I followed some helpful links:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions\nI created a shared partition in Windows and named it Data.  I then moved my music, pictures, documents, downloads, and videos to this NTFS volume.  I used Gparted Live cd to add a /home and a new swap volume.  I then configured the ftsab, grub, and initramfs files to setup the new swap for a resume state per the swapfaq link above.  Then I created a mountpoint\n\nsudo mkdir /media/Data\n\nwhere the Data volume would mount on reboot. I added\n\nUUID=F0EAFE30EAFDF2A8                     /media/Data     ntfs-3g defaults,windows_names,locale=en_US.utf8  0       0\n\nTo fstab to actually mount the volume per the info in the Mounting Windows Partitions help wiki above.\nMy volumes look like this now:\n\n/dev/sda1: LABEL=\"System Reserved\" UUID=\"1E98FB2198FAF5DD\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" PARTUUID=\"a287a9ef-01\"\n/dev/sda2: LABEL=\"Win7OS\" UUID=\"6016FE5E16FE349E\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" PARTUUID=\"a287a9ef-02\"\n/dev/sda3: LABEL=\"Data\" UUID=\"F0EAFE30EAFDF2A8\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" PARTUUID=\"a287a9ef-03\"\n/dev/sda5: LABEL=\"Ubuntu\" UUID=\"b010e611-6efb-49a9-bff0-59b9533d659b\" TYPE=\"ext4\" PARTUUID=\"a287a9ef-05\"\n/dev/sda6: LABEL=\"HOME\" UUID=\"3cd8964d-59e2-43e3-8f15-bee9600f95b3\" TYPE=\"ext4\" PARTUUID=\"a287a9ef-06\"\n/dev/sda7: LABEL=\"Swap\" UUID=\"8bcb4169-f5ab-4ab6-b644-23e528088d41\" TYPE=\"swap\" PARTUUID=\"a287a9ef-07\"\n\nMy Hibernate works and my Rhythmbox does not lose any of the library files after rebooting.  Thanks to those that made comments and helped me direct my attention where it needed to be.  I hope this helps others in future.\n\nA: So there are a couple things you can do here. First for Rythmbox this could be a duplicate issue of: Rythmbox Does Not Remember My Music. See if the solution here has provided your fix.

Is Oracle JDK actually better or is it fine to just stick with OpenJDK? Installing Oracle JDK seems like a hassle compared to the simple sudo apt-get install default-jdk for OpenJDK. Are there any differences between the two I should be worried about?\n\nA: I think that it depends on what you are going to be doing. There are probably some compatibility issues for random features. I have not run into any myself, but you may be better off using the JDK from Oracle. Webupd8 does a great job distributing the JDK via a PPA which makes it pretty easy to install on Ubuntu. \n\nA: OpenJDK is more Open and thus also better to debug, fix and configure.

If you are still not able to install it after running apt-get update then it is possible that you may not have this repo enabled on your server. \nYou can check to see if this repository is enabled by running the following command in a terminal: \ncat /etc/apt/sources.list | grep universe\n\nThe output of this command should look something like this: \ndeb http://mirrors.linode.com/ubuntu/ precise universe\ndeb-src http://mirrors.linode.com/ubuntu/ precise universe\ndeb http://mirrors.linode.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates universe\ndeb-src http://mirrors.linode.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates universe\ndeb http://mirrors.linode.com/ubuntu/ precise-backports main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb-src http://mirrors.linode.com/ubuntu/ precise-backports main restricted universe multiverse\ndeb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise-security universe\ndeb-src http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise-security universe\n\nIf you get no output, then add the following lines to /etc/apt/sources.list \ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise universe\ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise universe\ndeb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates universe\ndeb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates universe\n\nIf the output is commented out with # then remove the comments from /etc/apt/sources.list \nThen you should be able to run apt-get update and then apt-get install python-guestfs\n", "Q: History command in graphic interface of OS Does Ubuntu store a history of command executed in the graphic interface (not in a shell session)? \nFor example if, by mouse, I click on System Settings, then click on Network, do these steps correspond to commands (for example exec commands)? \nIf yes, does Ubuntu track these commands in a log file?\n\nA: Each of the programs that you interact with in a GUI typically have their own logs for various things. AFAIK there is no way to find a universal log of everything you do in a GUI like you would with the history command. \nPerhaps if you enable debugging in your Desktop Manager you could get additional output, but each program that you interact with will have its own logs somewhere. \nIf you are using unity, you can learn more about debugging here. \n\nA: Unfortunately, many actions of GUI programs are implemented in the program itself, not using external commands.\nSo that does not exist, and is not easy to implement.\nBut if you just want to monitor(It's not log file, it's video record) your GUI actions for some time you can screencast your Desktop using some apps such as kazam ,or record my desktop...\n\nA: Yes when clicking on system setting in the background it's associated with a command , because in ubuntu we just invoke some script(i.e, execute a file) to do some activities , so you can also open system settings from Terminal  for versions >= 14.04 -> unity-control-center else gnome-control center  , so this way it works it's associated with some command always in ubuntu . There are some applications which record our activities like Activity Journal so ubuntu must be saving our activities that we do somewhere but i don't exactly know the location where they were stored .\n**For  applications in ubuntu there is a graphical view , go to /usr/share/applications/ you will find icons of every applications like in windows then right-click properties so that you can see the command associated with it . **\n", "Q: Want to install Ubuntu on Chromebook I have an Acer C720, with a 64 gb SSD,  in which I would like to install Ubuntu. But I don't want the \"crouton\" version. If I follow the directions from here (https://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/764181-how-to-install-linux-on-an-acer-c720-chromebook) will I get a \"real\" version of Ubuntu? If not how should I proceed?\nThanks\n\nA: The real version of Ubuntu on Chromebook is called Chrubuntu.\nI have done this, and even got it working great, but after a few months it wouldn't boot. There's no way I can tell you how to do it in one post. Go for it, but remember it's imperfect. Here's the most important resource:\nreddit.com/r/chrubuntu\nHowever, I'm going to say that you shouldn't do this. It's a hassle (think 8 hours of setup time), when another distro now supports Chromebooks out of the box. You can use pendrive linux's universal installer to install the Chromebook flavor of Bodhi linux, and you'll find yourself probably much more at ease\nMake sure you get the chromebook flavor: http://bodhilinux.com\nOf course you still have to configure the Chromebook itself to allow it:\nhttp://jeffhoogland.blogspot.com/2014/01/howto-bodhi-linux-on-acer-c720.html\n\nA: You need to enable developer mode and then enable legacy boot. Then, enable boot from USB. Then, do a standard Ubuntu 15.04 install with a flash drive. This process will delete ChromeOS.\n\nA: As far as I can establish by quickly examining the script, yes. The script downloads a base Ubuntu version from:\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-core/releases/$ubuntu_version/release/ubuntu-core-$ubuntu_version-core-$ubuntu_arch.tar.gz\n\nwhere $ubuntu_arch and $ubuntu_version are the Ubuntu arch and version specified/needed.\nHowever, it then modifies bits, presumably to make it work on Chromebooks. This seems to include settings for the touchpad, setting up software repos (mainly those used in standard Ubuntu), and making a patched kernel (using this amongst other things), as well as flashing new firmware.\nSo parts like the kernel and hardware/driver configuration may not be the same as in the 'standard' Ubuntu versions, but are necessary to make it work on Chrombooks. The software (desktop, applications & programs etc) used should for the most part be exactly the same as available in \nstandard Ubuntu installs as I think is uses the normal repositories. \n", "Q: Cannot connect to wired connection after clean install (both 14.02 LTS and 15.04) I just built a new PC and successfully installed Ubuntu without any errors.

Can somebody explain the difference between dual booting ubuntu 14.04 and windows 8, and installing ubuntu on another internal hard drive? And how you would do this?\nI'm a relatively new ubuntu user but I really love it, but I also want to be able to play games so I want to have both windows 8 and ubuntu 14.04 running without a drag on my computer. I see some websites that recommend dual booting for this, and others that say this will mess up my computer and should install ubuntu on another internal hard drive instead. This is making my head explode. \n\nA: Simple: There is none ;-)\nDual-Booting just means that you will on boot up (after the power button is pressed and BIOS shows POST messages) NOT immediately be greeted by an Operating system as you have two installed. Instead you will be given the option to chose which one to start (Actually you can even dual-boot without that menu but let's ignore that for a second).\nBasically an OS is installed on one (or more) partition(s) on physical drive(s) of your computer.\nRoughly speaking it creates a special section on the disk which is the either the Master Boot Record (MBR) on BIOS Systems or an ESP partition on EFI systems where it installs the boot-loader. Either way these are small bootable files which launch the appropriate operating system.\nAlso this software (on Ubuntu most likely GRUB) will provide your \"chose OS to start\" menu. It can detect other installed OS's like other Linux distributions or Windows (actually it  chainloads the windows bootloader but that's just a side-note).\nTo setup your PC like this install one OS first (beginning with Windows is recommended) and then the second. Assuming the second is Ubuntu you just select \"install alongside Windows\" in the installer and it will find unallocated space on a system to assign to Ubuntu. Also it will install a boot-loader as formerly mentioned and will instruct it to search for a Windows install.\nIt should detect it automatically. On booting you can select which OS to start.\nBottom-Line: There's no real difference and Ubuntu should do a good job with guiding you through the process.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 Login fails and returns to login I recently upgraded my desktop from an NVIDIA 560ti graphics card to a 970 SC. Before upgrading the card, I updated to Vivid Vervet with no issues. After upgrading the card, my login screen is blown up (maybe 720p) as opposed to 1080p on the old card, and login attempts result in some text flashing by and a return to the login. \nI also tried booting into the LiveUSB version of 14.10, but this failed too.\nI'm certain the problem lies in the new graphics card. Several other threads suggest installing new or experimental drivers, but I can't even access the terminal. Is there any official support for the new card, or am I out of luck for now?\n\nA: There were a lot of questions on askubuntu about constantly returning to the login screen.\nI've upgraded machines with AMD and nVidia cards from 14.04 to 15.04 (through 14.10) and on both I had this issue.

Is that possible to simple tell what kind of license is used in Ubuntu Server?\nI would like to know if thats possible to let the Ubuntu Server in basic configurations is \"distributed under GPL\" or \"distributed under AGPL\" etc...\n\nA: There is no single license for Ubuntu. Ubuntu is a distribution of thousands of different packages that each have their own license.\nFor example the Linux Kernel itself is released under the GPLv2, but other components like some binary drivers that may come with Ubuntu are proprietary. \nThis page explains this a bit further. \n", "Q: apt-get install caused all packages to be removed I am very upset by this, and I simply cannot understand WHY it happened. The reason why I am so upset is because I have people which use my Teamspeak server, and I am currently away on vacation, thus I don't have physical access to the computer.\nAnyhow, I was trying to set up a IKE2 VPN, and I was trying to install Openswan.\nMy server is running Kodibuntu (media center ubuntu distro), and I used SSH to access it.

However, you could take a peek at the .bash_history(sp?) for any other people that may have rights to make changes to your server. Another option if you input 'N' at the very last is to try and run apt-get -f install and see if that doesn't help. That command 'should' fix your broken packages problem.\n\nA: I don't think this has anything to do with when you isntalled iproute. The only time that massive packages get removed like this from my experience is when you remove packages that are linked to meta packages. For example if you remove Evolution, it likes to remove a whole bunch of gnome stuff since the gnome stuff were dependencies for Evolution and by removing it you told the package manager that you no longer needed those dependencies. \nThe only way you are going to be able to troubleshoot this is with access to the machine. I think looking through the bash history would be a good place to start. Look for other packages that were removed previously. \nAlso, when you saw this message: \n0 upgraded, 4 newly installed, 138 to remove and 1 not upgraded. \nYou should have stopped immediately and began troubleshooting. Apt is telling you that it is about to remove 138 packages, apt means it. \n\nA: *\n\n*I don't agree with levlaz's answer, when meta packages are removed, related packages are listed in automatically installed and are no longer required list. APT will not force you remove them, only if you run explicitly apt-get autoremove to remove them.\n\n*AFAIK, It looks like a package version or a package architecture conflict:\nThe following NEW packages will be installed:\n  cupsddk iproute libatm1 libdb5.1\n\nLooking for similar ones in the packages which will be REMOVED, I see only iproute2. (note: if it was a package architecture conflict, we will find same package name ex:iproute in to be REMOVED list, this wasn't the case)\nWell, that shouldn't happen. As in trusty and later releases, iproute is a transitional dummy package for iproute2 :\n\nThis is a transitional dummy package to get upgrading systems to install\n  the iproute2 package.

I am planning on installing Ubuntu but I'm not sure if the windows based games that i already have will carry over (ex. Battlefield 4, Call Of Duty Advanced Warfare, and Grand Theft Auto 5)\n\nA: Not sure for every game, but wine is a tool which you can use to execute some of the windows based applications and games.\n\nA: I'm also a gamer. I decided to set my system to dual boot. I already had a SSD drive that wasn't being used so, I put the Ubuntu disk image onto a flash drive and used the installer to create the partition for the OS and a partition for the swap file and told the installer to put the boot loader on the Ubuntu drive then, went into my BIOS and set it to the Ubuntu drive as #1 boot priority and the windows drive to #2 boot priority then saved and exited. If you do it this way you can still run your games without having to emulate windows with wine (slower). Also, if you install like this, don't forget to eject and remove the flash drive prior to trying to boot to the Ubuntu drive ;)\n\nA: In geenral no, but instead you can use some applications that run .exe files from inside Ubuntu, such as wine, playonlinux ....\nThe most known is wine.\nyou can install wine using the command:\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nOnce wine is installed you can create a Windows environment inside your Ubuntu so you can install and use some windows app inside.\nHere you can find lits of apps that works with wine.\nAnother Option to use Virtual machines such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Xen\n\n*VBox\n\n*Qemu\n\n*VMWare\n\n\nHere you can find a list of available virtual machines for Ubuntu.\nNow back for your question, here result of your needed games within wine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Battlefield will work under wine \n\n*Call Of Duty Advanced Warfare works great\n\n*Grand Theft Auto 5 is not working yet but Grand Theft Auto 4 works great\n", "Q: How do I use GNUPG to create a signed message?

I have a .desktop file that launches an app, and it uses the .desktop icon:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=My Ro\nType=Application\nComment=Web Application\nExec=/path/to/myapp -test\nIcon=/opt/giteye/icon.xpm\nName[en_US]=My Ro\n\nI want to use a shell script instead to launch this app because with shell script i can pass the script command line arguments which then get passed to the launching app.\n#!/bin/sh\nnohup /path/to/myapp -test \"$@\" &\n\nHowever with shell script the icon is not that of the shell file. It uses the default icon of the myapp. Is there anyway to make this behave as the .desktop and make the shell launch the app with custom icon?\nEDIT - I tried giving the desktop entry path to shell\nOne desktop entry:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Firefox\nType=Application\nComment=Web Application\nExec=/home/yasir/Desktop/launchers/Mozilla\\ Firefox\\ -\\ test.sh\nIcon=/home/yasir/Desktop/customFx.png\nName[en_US]=Firefox\n\nAnother desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Firefox Safe Mode\nType=Application\nComment=Web Application\nExec=/home/yasir/Desktop/launchers/Mozilla\\ Firefox\\ -\\ test.sh -safe-mode\nIcon=/home/yagt/Documents/fxSafe.png\nName[en_US]=Firefox Safe Mode\n\nShell:\n#!/bin/sh\nnohup /usr/lib/firefox/firefox \"$@\" &\n\n\nA: There arises no reason to do this. That's exactly why it is not possible. If you are going to pass arguments other than the arguments allowed, then you will be invoking it from a command line, in which case there is not reason to have an icon. In that case, you wont be using a .desktop file, but a script directly.\nAdd...

I have just installed CCSM to enable wobbly windows. CCSM presented me a dialog with a warning to use the program with caution. Several programs have such dialog, usually with a check box to whether show again or skip the dialog the next time the program starts.\nI have disabled the CCSM startup dialog, but now I think it should have been better to have left it activated. It is a very small annoyance, I know, and I don't mind having it the way it is. Nevertheless, I thought it would be nice to know where this setting/flag is saved since I can't find a way to re-activate it from CCSM, and also if the majority of programs have a standard location/way to save that preference.\n\nA: compiz store a file called 'firstrun' under the ~/.config/compiz-1/compizconfig path. So all you have is to delete this file and then run CCSM again so it will shows you the warning dialog.\nsudo rm -f ~/.config/compiz-1/compizconfig/firstrun\n\nTip: In general you don't have to use sudo within your home, but here you have to use sudo even in your home dirs since this file and other Default.ini are owned by root.\n", "Q: How to use Python like Windows? For example , I write a Python program by vim , but how can I run it ? It just show a editor program when I double tap on it .\n\nA: Type \npython name-of-python-script-here.py\n\nin the terminal. Make sure the directory of the terminal is the same as the location of the file you created in vim.\n\nA: You can alternatively add a shebang at the start of your Python script and mark the script executable, which will cause it to run correctly when executed normally.\nAdd this line to the top of the script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nNote that due to difference between Python 2.x and 3, usually that will default to Python 2.7, so use this if you want Python 3:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nThen make it executable.  This tells the shell/GUI that this is a program that can be executed.\nchmod a+x <name of script>\n\nThen you can run it without putting \"python \" in front - either by just typing <name of script> at the prompt or double-clicking or whatever in the GUI.\nWhether you do this or not is a matter of taste, you may prefer to invoke them with python <name of script> or by this method.\n", "Q: I'm having some issues working with parallel ssh I'm trying to figure out how to issue the same command to an entire cluster.

I went into 25_custom and wiped all the entries into which were not needed(to boot into at the time of startup - like all the unnecessary EFI entries).\nsudo gedit  /etc/grub.d/25_custom\nsudo update-grub\n\nPlease make sure to make a backup  of the files you are editing. Make sure that you are not storing any of the backup files starting with 25_custom...if you store it with 25_custom_today'sdate etc....EFI boot loader will still read the entries from that....For folks who have HP Laptop - this will definitely work for you.Thanks for all your help.\nUpdate\nFaced this issue again with my Dell XPS Desktop. This time I need to do the same for custom_40 and custom_41. Please refer to anything under /etc/grub.d to find out the issues specific to your machine.\nAnother alternative to do this:\nUse grub-customizer - graphical user interface\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\ngrub-customizer\n\n\nNow highlight the entry and remove it\nSave the changes once done.\nWith next reboot - you can check those unwanted entries are gone.\n and good part about grub-customizer is that in the right side - it has the removed items - one can revert back some or all of them if you have deleted something by mistake.\nAlso don't forget to purge the old kernels so that you can save on disk space also.\n\nA: To remove EFI entries from UEFI efibootmgr is used.\nYou can list entries by\nsudo efibootmgr\n\nAnd remove entries by\nsudo efibootmgr -Bb <entry_number>\n\nEfibootmgr manual\n\nA: To clean your Grub entry you have to decide which menuentry to remove, First let's edit the custom file script in  the /etc/grub.d dir contain same content of your grub.cfg.\ngedit /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nCopy all contents and go to the file  /etc/grub.d/40_custom\nsudo gedit  /etc/grub.d/40_custom\n\nAppend the copied content to the lines founded in the 40_custom.\nNow In this custom file just remove all menuentries that you don't want to appear in your Grub menu. Take sure to remove the node of the menuentry which is enclosed by { }\nNow when you  finish Save the 40_custom file and exit from gedit\nThen run the command:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis command will create a new boot menu in the file /boot/grub/grub.cfg that contains the custom menu items that we have specified.\nYou can check, ahead of rebooting, just to be sure, by using the command: gedit /boot/grub/grub.cfg. This will open the file in read-only mode.\nIf the file is as you expect then go ahead and reboot else check where you have an error.\nyou can read some articles for more info such as this and this.\n", "Q: Fstab - mount a folder that has mounted folders in it I have an ftp server where I am binding all of the home directories to a folder that has folders in it which were bound to other hard drives.\n[Anime hard disk] -> mounted to ftp/Anime/\n[ftp] -> mounted to kevin/\nI want all of the folders inside the ftp folder to show up in all of the users directories with all of its contents.

So what you have to do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a live USB/DVD and boot into Ubuntu Live\n\n*In Gparted you start from the live environment, unmount the partition.

How can I do a disk low level formatting in Ubuntu on an external hard disk so that any data recovery tools like test-disk or photorec cannot retrieve any data once formatted to ext4 or any file-system? As I was playing around with Test disk, I found that it can recover almost all old files even after formatting it many times and I want to use my external hard disk as new because it is only one year old and in warranty but without any old data.\n\nA: The dd command by Maythux is a good one to go with, though I've read somewhere (sorry for no source!) that it's good to overwrite with zeros then do a second pass with random writes, then zero it off on a third pass.\nTo use dd to write random patterns:\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdX bs=512\n\nI have seen some examples of dd using smaller block size (down to bs=4) which I think will make the write slightly more random, but take longer.\nBe super careful that you select the correct drive when using dd as it's very dangerous if you make a mistake!\n\nA: NaA, but some additional informations, expecially about SSDs\n\nThere are lots of methods and lots of debates around the topic; basically this is about the type of the support (magnetical disk or flash disk) and about the sensitivity of your informations.\nData which are really sensitive might be considered undeniably safe only when the physical drive is destroyed, since, theoretically [but not too much] (placeholder for the link if I ever manage to find it again) laboratory methods capable of measuring differences in the magnetic / electronic fields of a support, joined with the knowledge of the algorithm used by firmware of the drive to handle the data might be able to extract even data that has been overwritten multiple times.\nHowever, for the purpose of erasing a hard disk containing personal data, each of the methods above will work fine against a software recovery attempt; it might be noted, however, that methods using low-level utilities are not good to be used on SSDs, for multiple reasons.\nThe first one being that writing a flash-based memory (expecially multiple times) is not really healthy for the memory itself, altough the wear-leveling issue is highly overestimated (expecially on MLC SSDs), i.e.: you indeed don't want to dd a SSD drive every day, but once, twice or even thrice (or even more) in its whole life-span is absolutely not a big deal;\nThe second one being the fact that commercial SSDs usually come with additional replacement cells, which are initially not being used by the drive, and which are intended to act as a replacement for cells being damaged during the usage of the drive; this leading to, possibly, the SSD controller unmapping such damaged cells (possibly containing sensitive informations) at some point of the drive's life making them physically inaccessible from low-level tools.\nSo, if you're using a SSD, the best solution is probably sticking to the manufacturer's ATA SECURE_ERASE command implementation (as described in meuh's answer), hoping that this will be robust enough for the purpose.\n\nA: I want to elaborate on a detail in the question that no other answer has touched upon: low-level formatting. In the past, a distinction was made between two types of disk formatting:\n\n\n*\n\n*Low-level formatting -- This refers to creating the data structures that define the sectors and tracks on a disk.\n\n*High-level formatting -- This refers to creating a filesystem on a disk.\n\n\nSome decrepit old fools like me still twist our sentences into pretzel shapes to avoid using the word \"formatting\" alone because that's ambiguous. For years, in the Unix/Linux world, high-level formatting was always referred to as creating a filesystem. The word \"formatting\" has been creeping into various utilities in this context, though.\nIt's important to note that, to the best of my knowledge, no modern hard disk supports low-level formatting by users; that task is done at the factory and cannot be done again once the disk leaves the factory. Hard disks in the 1980s and maybe into the early 1990s did support low-level formatting by users, but those disks are all museum pieces by now. You can still low-level format a floppy disk, if your computer is old enough to actually have one. This was often necessary with floppies, since different computers (Macs vs. PCs, say) used different types of low-level formats, so if you got a Mac floppy and wanted to use it on a PC (or vice-versa), you'd have to low-level format it.\nAlso and FWIW, I looked into it a few years ago, and I could find no references to actual tools that could be used to recover data from a disk that had been wiped by using dd to zero out all its sectors. It's theoretically possible to do so by disassembling the disk and using special hardware to read it. If the disk holds national security secrets, going beyond dd might be advisable (and is required by many national security agencies); but I wouldn't worry about protecting your credit card numbers and Flickr password with anything beyond dd, at least on a hard disk. SSDs use fundamentally different technology and I've not looked into them in any depth.\n\nA: I use shred when selling old hard drives, use man shred for more information:\nshred -vzn 0 /dev/xxx\n\nYou can specify n number of times to overwrite and z to overwrite it all with zeros at the end.\n\nA: If you want absolute peace of mind (and still want to use it afterwards) give it the Guttman method.\nIt is overkill.  A standard three-pass overwrite - clearing with zeros, filling with ones, then overwriting with a random string of either - is industry recognised and still the defacto means to certifiably sanitize a hard drive.  If your drive is without bad sectors and the eraser can access all addressable areas - your data is gone.\nIt might be worth noting that there are no trading names which claim to be able to recover previously overwritten data.\nInfact, there are good reasons why a single pass might well be enough.  There is really only one clinical circumstance where data could \"theoretically\" be recovered under laboratory conditions: by using 'some sort of' molecular magnetic microscopy on what would have ideally been a previously clean (and preferably intact) drive - measuring the minute differences in residual charge thought to represent previous logical values and then reconstructing bit by bit with the aid of probability analysis.  It is vague and deemed to be so prohibitively expensive - especially for newer hard drives - that it is questionable whether some agencies could be capable of even justifying the attempt.  Your data certainly isn't worth it!\nObsolete hard drives are thought prone - but beyond one pass the chances of recovery approach zero.\nThe belief that this can be reliably done by any agency is very likely a myth allowed to perpetuate to overstate a nation's perceived range of capabilities.\nConversely, the mere suggestion that such data recovery methods are no longer (or never were) possible on (post-modern) hard drives is quite possibly the rumour which enables agencies and nation-states to keep the capability unannounced.\nSo if you want to, give it Guttman's ridiculous 35-pass wipe.  Even more, encrypt it first and throw away the key (aka crypto-erasure - a method sufficient on its own).  If you want total peace of mind - shatter the platters.  If you're sane - wipe it three times, or just once if you're going to be actively using it again pretty soon. \n\nA: I think it is maybe not as secure as professional tools or dd or something like that, but if you just need to overwrite the whole file system's data part (! not disk), you could just format it normally and then create a huge file filling up the whole space with\nyes \"string pattern\" > /mnt/device-to-kill/huge-file\n\nThis will create/replace the file /mnt/device-to-kill/huge-file, assuming that your external device is mounted as /mnt/device-to-kill. \nThe content will be string pattern overly and overly repeated. If you don't give a pattern as argument, default is y. The command will not stop writing data until either the disk is full or you abort it with Ctrl+C.\nThe advantage of this method is that even an unexperienced user can't destroy anything accidentally. If you specify a target file on your HDD, it will create/replace that one and fill up every free byte of disk space you have, which should at most produce a crash and minor loss of unsaved data. It does not touch existing files.\nThis is also a disadvantage though, as you have to format the file system before to delete all files normally, as the command only overwrites free space. Besides this, it can only overwrite the data part of your partition/device, not parts reserved for e.g. file tables (FAT, MFT, whatever depending on your file system).\nConclusion: This command is more for newbies that fear to accidentally destroy more than they want instead of experts that need 110% secure data destruction.\n\nA: Modern discs implement the ATA secure erase\nfeature, which you can do with the hdparm command using the --security-erase option, after first setting a password on the disk.  Note that there are caveats, including\n\n\n*\n\n*possible firmware bugs\n\n*possible disk controller timeout for a possibly long-running operation\n\n*you shouldn't do it over USB\n\n\nFor some discs this will take hours, as each block is rewritten. For others it can take seconds as it just means changing a global encryption key held by the disc that transparently encrypts/decrypts all data going to/from the disk.\nThis is true for hard discs and SSDs. It's the firmware than counts.\nAnother article also\nsuggests that --security-erase has the advantage that it may also wipe\nout the hidden areas\nHPA host protected area\nand DCO device configuration overlay.\n\nA: If you want totally wipe the hdd the best is to use dd:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=512 \n\nReplace sdX with your drive letter\nAnother possible tools:\n\n\n*\n\n*srm\n\nThis command is a replacement for rm command. It works under\n  Linux/BSD/UNIX-like OSes. It removes each specified file by\n  overwriting, renaming, and truncating it before unlinking. This\n  prevents other people from undelete or recovering any information\n  about the file from the command line. Because it does lots of\n  operation on file/directory for secure deletion, it also takes lot of\n  time to remove it.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*wipe\n\nA: This doesn't really answer your question, as you want to use the HDD. However, it's important.\n\nIf this is really important data that should never be recovered, it's not safe to use the disk any more. Apple Macs offer a 35 overwrite feature - which they claim is what the government requires, but it's complicated:\n\nEffective immediately, DSS will no longer approve overwriting procedures for the sanitization or downgrading (e.g. release to lower level classified information controls) of IS storage devices (e.g., hard drives) used for classified processing.\n\nIt is thought that some of the 3-letter agencies (FBI, CIA, MI6) require physical destruction of magnetic media (e.g., melting in a furnace).\nYou do have a few options - the one I've relied on in the past is hitting it with a hammer lots of times, then wiping the magnets over it.\nHowever, I'm a student and nobody wants to hack into an empty bank account, so it didn't need to be as secure. Plus, I wasn't going to bin the Hard Drive - it's now a bird scarer for the allotment.\nIf you work under confidentially agreements (especially those involving the government) you need something a little more secure.

Just want to see if it fixes it without the need to logout.\n\nA: The problem likely is that 14.04 (with GTK 3.10) is not listed as supported from that source - v1.1 says it is for 14.10 (with GTK 3.12), and v2.1 says it is for 15.04 (with GTK 3.14), which use newer (and different) versions of GTK. This page seems to be the extension's source, but seems to only lists the versions on the page you mentioned.\nThose versions should still work to some extent (1.1 may work better than 2.1), but probably will have issues like the ones you are describing. Issues could also be caused by not having the needed GTK engines ('murrine' and 'pixbuf' in this case) installed.\nHowever, you should be able to find a version of the theme that works from elsewhere - e.g. using the noobslab themes PPA as suggested here:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/themes\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libra-theme\n\nYou can also download the deb files from that PPA directly from here.

Both systems are in same LAN.\n\nA: From commlineFu:\nconnect via ssh using mac address\nInstead of looking for the right ip address, just pick whatever address you like and set a static ip mapping.\nsudo arp -s 192.168.1.200  00:35:cf:56:b2:2g temp && ssh root@192.168.1.200\n\nAnother command:\nssh root@`for ((i=1; i<=255; i++));do arp -a 192.168.1.$i; done | grep 00:35:cf:56:b2:2g | awk '{print $2}' | sed -e 's/(//' -e 's/)//'`\n\nthen all you have to change the MAC and choose any IP you wish to use and change root to a valid user\nNote: Those commands is just a hack an in really they are using the IP itself not the MAC.\nExample using second command:\nMy LAN IP range is 10.1.1.* .The MAC of server want to connect to is 00:15:17:5f:XX:XX . The user on the host machine is called maythux\nSo the command will be:\nssh maythux@`for ((i=1; i<=20; i++));do arp -a 10.1.1.$i; done | grep 00:15:17:5f:XX:XX | awk '{print $2}' | sed -e 's/(//' -e 's/)//'`\n\nNote i make for loop to 20 just for timing and i already know ip is less than 20, in case you dont range so keep it to 255.\nAnd boom I'm prompted for password of user maythux in the host pc\n\nTIP:\nInstead you can normally use SSH with using IP, if you don't know the IP of some systems you can get it from the MAC, take a look for my question List all MAC addresses and their associated IP addresses in my local network (LAN) , you'll find many answers how to get an IP knowing its MAC\n\nA: Don't know what exactly is the use case of yours.

There are also universal bash libraries for argument parsing, but you would have to distribute them with your script, and they are quite long and complex.\nWhy?\n\n\n*\n\n*The answer suggesting using getopt is not a good choice - its support of long options is a GNU extension, so scripts using it are not portable. Plus getopt has its own issues besides that.\n\n*The answer suggesting writing bash argument parsing code also has an issue - maintaining relatively long hand-written code like this doesn't feel right.\n\n\nFinally, arguments that begin with dashes are commonly known as optional and treated as such - they should not be required and if they are omitted, a sensible default should be available. Therefore, the original script you are somehow unhappy about, may actually be the best solution.\n", "Q: Thunderbird 37.1.0 disable Send Now keyboard shortcut I would like to disable the Send Message Now shortcut (Ctrl+Enter) in Thunderbird 31.7.0.

I'm trying to use Grub2 as the boot manager on an EFI system in standalone mode. (The only persistent harddisk has OS X on it; Linux and Windows drives may or may not be present at times, hence the standalone mode.)\nI'm using SuperGrub2Disk, which is one EFI executable, and as I understand it Grub2's executable in this mode has an embedded disk image that it mounts for its root partition, with a copy of its own config file inside.\nI'd like to override or amend this config file with an external grub.cfg. I've tried placing it next to the grub EFI executable or in the root of the ESP partition, but it's not being recognized. I've also tried to load it from a grub command line by the following command:\nconfigfile (hd3,gpt1)/grub.cfg\n\nThis seems to have no effect other than clearing the screen - even though the config file is there as confirmed by ls.\nCould anyone tell me if there's a way to use an external config file with an EFI standalone blob?\n\nA: GRUB 2 binaries include hard-coded references to their configuration files. I haven't really been keeping track of all the gory details, but as I understand it, there are two EFI GRUB 2 binaries for Ubuntu on AMD64/x86-64 systems:\n\n\n*\n\n*grub2-efi-amd64 -- This is the version of GRUB 2 that's used on computers that do not use Secure Boot. As I understand it, the binary itself is linked on your computer from pre-compiled components included in the package. The resulting binary refers to a grub.cfg file on your Linux installation's /boot/grub directory. Thus, you can't use the grubx64.efi binary installed from this package on one computer on another one, because the binary is customized for the computer on which it was created.\n\n*grub2-efi-amd64-signed -- This version of GRUB 2 is compiled and linked on a Canonical system so that it can be signed with a Secure Boot key. One side effect of the requirement that the binary be signed is that it cannot be customized for your system, and as a result, this version of grubx64.efi looks in the same directory as the binary for grub.cfg. On an Ubuntu system, this grub.cfg file searches for /boot/grub/grub.cfg, but in principle it could be customized to do something else.\n\n\nThus, in your case you can't use the unsigned GRUB 2 binary; if you want to use a stock Ubuntu GRUB 2 binary, you must use the signed one. Alternatively, you could build your own binary, as described here, among other places.\nIn your case, though, I don't think GRUB 2 is really optimal. Both rEFIt (which is now abandoned) and my fork of it, rEFInd, feature dynamic scanning for available boot loaders. Thus, if you install rEFIt or rEFInd to your internal disk's EFI System Partition (ESP) and put the boot loaders for your OSes on their respective removable media, rEFIt/rEFInd will provide you with options to boot those OSes if and only if the appropriate disk is plugged in. This behavior, however, will depend on proper management of your boot loaders, placing each one on the ESP of its respective disk; if your boot loaders are all stored on your internal disk's ESP, rEFIt/rEFInd will show non-functional OS options at all times, just like GRUB 2 would. In either case, using rEFIt or rEFInd will obviate the need to delve into the morass of manual GRUB 2 configuration.\n\nA: I would expect that a grub.cfg placed in the same directory is read and executed by a GRUB UEFI image with both of them usually being stored on the ESP, but I don't know that much about Mac setups. (On another note the embedded configuration has very limited functionality.)\nMay be creating the GRUB image yourself without an embedded configuration brings you one step further to a solution, these posts might help:\n\n\n*\n\n*2.1. Creating the binary and 2.2. Creating the configuration file in How to create UEFI-only bootable USB live media?\n\n*Add a (boot) partition for Macs\n\nA: A standalone GRUB 2 UEFI application can be created, containing an isolated GRUB 2 installation that reads a configuration file in the same directory as the application binary.\nThis process is described in the Arch Linux wiki, but can be done on any distrubution (as long as paths are adjusted accordingly).\n", "Q: Low-graphics mode error during installation I downloaded ubuntu 14.04 and made a bootable USB stick.

The tool does not reports this time.\nThe disk is a WD My Passport Ultra, that comes with hardware encryption but dunno how to use it on Linux. Looks like the software it is only available for Windows and MAC.\n\nA: Caveat: I have not tried this myself \nWhat does the INITIAL encryption do in practice?  \nFor all data:\n - Read a bunch of the data\n - Process it in a special way\n - Write it back to disk\nAdd the time to null out all free space (write zeroes).\nAnswer:\nSo the processing time should be similar to reading out all contents, then writing it back, with a slight penalty for processing it in between.\n\nFor estimated read speed of a drive:*\nOpen a terminal and type/copy + execute this  (press ENTER on it).\n\n\ndev=\"/dev/sdb\"; echo \"About to do READ-speed test on $dev\"; sudo hdparm -Tt $dev\n\nman hdparm will tell what it actually does.\nUse lsblk to find out things to type into dev=\"...\"\n", "Q: How to generate Openssl .pem file and where we have to place it I want to generate a OpenSSL .pem file to allow the remote login via ssh using .pem file at the place of password.\nI am able to generate key as well as .crt and .pem file using the following\nsudo openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 2048\nopenssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr\nopenssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt\nopenssl x509 -inform DER -outform PEM -in server.crt -out server.crt.pem\n\nBut the problem is that where I have to put it at server side or what changes I have to made in /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to allow remote login via ssh using .pem file.\nI want that client connect my machine in the following manner.\nssh -i server_crt.pem username@my_ip\n\nWhat changes exactly I have to make for the implementation.\nThanks\n\nA: First you need to upload public key to the server you are willing to connect to, public key is in .pub file:\nExample:\n# ssh-copy-id -i ~/my-certificate.pub root@12.34.56.78\n\nAfter this it should be working and you should be able to login using:\n$ sudo ssh -i ~/my-certificate.pem root@12.34.56.78\n\nChanges are made in file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on server machine, open with text editor such as nano, you will see lines starting with something like: ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAAX ...\nI personally generate the key file using $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -v, which generates the .pem and pub file. When you get asked: \n\nEnter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa):\n\nenter the name of the .pem file for example: my-certificate.pem\nStep by step from generating key to login:\n\n\n*\n\n*Generate the key with $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -v and when asked to enter file in which to save the key, type my-certificate and when asked to enter passphrase, press Enter (empty passphrase) and confirm by Enter.\n\n*You will get two files generated, one will be my-certificate and one will be my-certificate.pub, rename the my-certificate to my-certificate.pem, so you will have two files, my-certificate.pub and my-certificate.pem\n\n*Upload the public certificate to to server: ssh-copy-id -i ~/my-certificate.pub username@ip\n\n*Make .pem file on your computer read-only sudo chmod 400 my-certificate.pem\n\n*Login with $ sudo ssh -i /path/to/my-certificate.pem user@ip\n\nA: As a plus of the best answer.\nBe sure that these optionals are open in this file on server: /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nRSAAuthentication yes\n\nPubkeyAuthentication yes\n\nAuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys\n\nRemove these comment marks.

In that folder a series of files gets created. \nI would like to run a script every Sunday at 02:00 and compress each folder which is older than 2 days.\nI would not like to have everything compressed to one folder, but each folder to get compressed individually. If the compression is successful, then the original folder can be deleted. \nI have tried to create a script but all it does is to compress them to a single file. also it does not delete the original folders.\nHow should I proceed?\n\nA: You can use xargs -n 1 to only pipe a single file argument into the compress command.   \nBe careful about spaces.\n\nA: find /path/to/directory -mtime +2 -exec ls \"{}\" \\;\n\nIs a useful snippet to list files over 2 days old, though it only counts full days, and there's an element of rounding that happens there, so using minutes with the -mmin option may work better. I've also seen people relpace the -exec with print0 and pipe the output to xargs, handles unusual filenames better than echo would. You can specify the type of file find is looking for too, to make it only find directories, I think this is the -type option\nYou can replace the ls in the command with other commands, I often use ls to make sure I'm happy with the output, then replace it with mv /path/to/target when I'm removing files over a certain age. I suppose you could use a tar command in place of the ls to achieve the compression you want. \nYou could script this, and call the script as a cron job, cron is the script scheduler on Ubuntu (and other linux systems).\nThat should start you off!\n\nA: This single command should do the job, so it can simply be entered into your crontab:\nfind /opt/abc/* -maxdepth 0 -mtime +2 ! -name '*.tar.gz' -exec tar czf {}.tar.gz {} \\; -exec rm -rf {} \\;\n\nI haven't tested it that thoroughly, but I am sure it won't accidentally delete stuff.\nIt will, however, delete archives, if they have the same name as a directory in question before the .tar.gz, as GNU tar will overwrite, if the creation switch, c, is given. It will be safer if you archive into another directory:\nfind /opt/abc/* -maxdepth 0 -mtime +2 ! -name '*.tar.gz' -exec tar czf /opt/abcompressed/{}.tar.gz {} \\; -exec rm -rf {} \\;\n\nAlso, the archives will contain the directory structure /opt/abc/<dirname>/<files>, which I wasn't able to work around yet.\n", "Q: Recover of important files on hard drive impossible I was updating my Ubuntu from 14.04 to 14.10 because I think it should correct a bug that was really annoying me.

I'm using tftp server (tftpd-hpa) for booting from PXE via LAN. I know, that default block size for TFTP protocol is 512 bytes, and for it download speed is very slow. It can accelerate changing default 512 bytes block to for example 16268B.\nBut I don't know how to set blksize, when I tried add it as option in TFTP_OPTIONS= in /etc/default/tftp-hpa I got tftp-hpa services error about bad config file.\nSo my question is How can I set tftp block size bigger than 512bytes (no max block size option)\n\nA: I was able to get this working with xinet.d running the tftp-hpa service.\nIn the xinetd.d/tftp file, I added --blocksize 1468\nservice tftp\n{\n\n        socket_type             = dgram\n        protocol                = udp\n        wait                    = yes\n        user                    = root\n        server                  = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd\n        server_args             = -s /tftpfolder --verbose --blocksize 1468\n        disable                 = no\n        per_source              = 11\n        cps                     = 100 2\n        flags                   = IPv4\n}\n\nAfter looking at the behavior, clients that do not specify a blocksize option per the RFC will continue to get the default 512 blocksize unfortunately.  Clients that do provide the blocksize option can now get up to the maxblocksize option I have set.  Mine is set under the fragmentation size, as we are running over WAN, but you can likely use the larger size as long as your clients can request a larger size as well.\n", "Q: Newbie needs installation help I have installed Ubuntu onto an old Dell laptop from a USB stick and chose the dual option of using Windows Xp or Ubuntu during the installation options.\nI then allocated about 50:50 partition drive space using the slider.

I removed the USB stick and rebooted but now all I get is a black screen with a flashing prompt. \nHave I lost my Windows Xp? \nIs there something I can do to get things back to normal?  Thanks in advance for any help.\n\nA: You needed to allocate unassigned space within Windows XP beforehand, I do not believe doing so in the Ubuntu installer will work when the goal is to dual boot.\n\nA: I hope you lost windows XP , when you were trying to dual boot , from windows you need to allocate some space for ubuntu and then install ubuntu on that freespace ,  as you changed the partition to 50:50 using slider , you are disturbing the windows partitions thereby you lose your windows and it does not functions as it did previously , when trying to dual boot necessary steps have to be followed carefully .\nTry this :\nInstalling Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\n", "Q: How to access Ubuntu ~ and . folder I have read many Questions and Answers here. In some of them there are directories that I cannot find on my computer, for example:\n/home/username/.local/\n~/.local/share/Steam\n\nWhat is ~, what is folder start with ., and how I can access these folders?\n\nA: ~ is a special shell replacement. It's replaced with your home directory (typically /home/$USER but not neccessarily). It's a shortcut we use because it's nice and short and it's impossible to know everybody's $HOME.\nFiles and directories prepended with a dot are hidden. In Windows it's a boolean setting on files, in Unix it's based on the filename. You can still access them though:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Ubuntu's default file browser you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Toggle the display of hidden files\n\n*Use the address bar to manually go to the path (Control + L to toggle raw address mode).\n\n*Use a run dialogue (Alt+F2) to run nautilus <full path>\n\n\n*In a terminal you can cd directly to the path.\n\n\nA: ~ is for accessing your home directory , if you type  cd ~  you will reach your home directory.\nFor example you want to go to Music directory from any directory just type: \ncd ~/Music \nIf a directory name starts with dot . it means that is hidden however you can access it from cd .foldername, also there are other uses of dot like: \n1)  cd .   u remain in the same folder where you are before entering this command \n2) cd ..   go to previous folder from the current folder \nNOTE : Folder and Directory are used interchangeably  \n", "Q: How to install road-rash game into linux? how to install registry files manually into wine?

Should you despite this decide to do so, run the graphics driver installer after installing it and it should do the rest. However, if you run further release upgrades to 15.04 and the upcoming 15.10, you will lose the Intel drivers again until the installer is published for these newer releases.\nThe second issue described in your question seems to be a font loading issue, as only the letter h is affected.

I have two machines:\n\n\n*\n\n*A server running Lubuntu (ragendbin)\n\n*A PC running Windows 7 (farore)\n\n\nI have been using SSH to access the Lubuntu server from the Windows PC. However, until now I have been just using Password Authentication, which obviously is not secure. Today is the day I decided to persevere and generate some keys.\nUnfortunately, it is not working. When I click on my generated .ppk private key file from my Windows machine (trying to open it with Putty) I just get an error message saying:\n\nPuTTY Error: Unable to open connection to C: Host does not exist.\n\nBelow are the steps I went through. Can you tell me what went wrong? Keep in mind that I already had the opensshserver installed on the Lubuntu server, and was using Password Authentication.\n\n\n*\n\n*I created my keys using \nchmod 700 ~/.ssh\nssh-keygen -t rsa\n\nI saved them as id_rsa in the .ssh folder, and created a passcode for them. \n\n\n*\n\n*I turned off password authentication, limited SSH access to just my user and turned off X11 forwarding in sshd_config :\nPasswordAuthentication no\n\nX11Forwarding no\n\nAllowUsers ***\n\n\n*I limited SSH in ufw.\n\n*I then created a file named authorized_keys in the .ssh folder, and copied the contents of id_rsa.pub into it and saved it.\n\n*I transferred the privated key (id_rsa) to my Windows machine, opened it with puttygen.exe, saved it as a .ppk file. \nNow when I try to open that .ppk file with PuTTY itself, I get the error message.\nWhat am I doing wrong? Thank you.\n\nA: The main thing you're doing wrong is expecting PuTTY to open the .ppk file: as far as I know the key file itself contains no information about the target host (indeed, that wouldn't make sense since the same key pair may be used to access different hosts).\nInstead, you should open PuTTY normally, and configure a session to use the key file by selecting Connection --> SSH --> Auth and browsing to the .ppk file under Private key file for authentication:\n\nAlternatively, you can run PuTTY's pagent in your Windows session and add the key to that: PuTTY will then attempt to authenticate via the agent each time instead of requiring explicit specification of the private key file.\n", "Q: Opened file Highlighting in Linux Ubuntu console First(I am using linux in terminal, (console mode),(no graphical extension),\nlike on server.\nThe question is following:\nIs it possible to install some kind of script, that highlights \"opened file\",\nfor example in green color(or any other), (only filename, nothing complex)?\nWhy? because that sometimes I and my collegues edit same files on server.\nIt is not very neccesary, but it is conveniet, You agree?\nOf course text editor promts you about you are to save already edited file,.\nJust in case,\nAnd of course not heavy  script, because it just does what it does.\nThanks anyway.\n\nA: One possible way to see it (but often not useful for your objective, see later) is using the fuser command, from the psmisc package. \nThe command fuser -a * will work as a sort-of ls, and will print a process id if something is keeping a file open. For example: \n⌂71% [romano:~/tmp] 1 % fuser -a *\n/home/romano/tmp/example.log:\n/home/romano/tmp/example.pdf:\n/home/romano/tmp/example.tex:  \n\nthen in another windows/terminal/virtual console/connection do a cat >> example.tex to keep the file open, and: \n⌂71% [romano:~/tmp] 1 % fuser -a *\n/home/romano/tmp/example.log:\n/home/romano/tmp/example.pdf:\n/home/romano/tmp/example.tex:  7742\n\nfuser tells you that the process with PID 7742 is keeping the file open.\nNevertheless, a lot of editors do not keep the file open; they read it in memory (remember that unix-like OSs have virtual memory), and then close it. For example, opening the file example.tex with vim has no effect on fuser output.) \nSo the double-editing avoidance is left to the editor; vim or emacs use a lock file and warn you on opening it twice.    \nYou can also see the comments and answers in this SO Q&A. \n", "Q: High load but nothing shows up on system monitor, what could be the cause?

Nothing seems to account for the high CPU.\nUPDATE: Updated to 15.04 - system monitor shows 2% CPU use, load indicator says 1.27 (out of 2).\n\nA: First, you should make sure you understand what load measures. I'm not sure what you are considering high load. If you have a dual core system, a load of 2.0 would mean that your system is constantly busy. If you have a single core system, then a load of 2.0 would be really bad. See http://blog.scoutapp.com/articles/2009/07/31/understanding-load-averages.\nOn the processes page, what do you have selected on the View dropdown menu button? You probably want to make sure you have \"All Processes\" selected. If you don't, things started by other users (likely root) like Xorg (which will use some memory) will not show up.\n\nA: Well from your images it seems as tho you have every program under the sun running.

I try to install with apt-get install flgrx, but it install other driver (HD R9 270X or something like it).\nI tried with the amd site files too but when I install those files and reboot, Ubuntu starts in graphics safe mode, so I have no idea of what I need to do to install it.\n\nA: FGLRX is very generic. It is not specified to fit one specific graphics card, but to support as many features as possible with as many different chips as possible. Also, the chip detection isn't as exact as it could be. As an example, my AMD A8500M series APU is detected as AMD A4500, but I don't have any problems with that, as all promised features are available.\nSo it is no problem at all if something else is being displayed. If you're installing the FGLRX driver, it is easier to do so via the Additional drivers tab in the Software & Updates utility.\nIf you want to install a later version from AMD's website (if there is a more recent one than in the Ubuntu repo's), you should run the following command after installation and reboot afterwards:\nsudo aticonfig --initial\n\nThis will create a default graphics configuration, which shouldn't crash the X Server, if the driver was properly installed.\n\nI've experienced the following method to work the best, although it can appear quite complicated for unexperienced users:\nIn the driver selection on AMD's website, select Linux (not Ubuntu) as operating system. Select the correct architecture (x86_64 for 64bit, x86 for 32bit) and download the provided archive.\nExtract the archive after the download has finished. You won't find a Debian package, but a shell script or a .run file instead. Open a terminal in the directory you extracted it to and make it executable:\nchmod +x <filename>\n\nFrom here on, I'll assume its name to be installer.run, although this will never be the case unless you rename it.\nThis script can either directly install the driver or generate packages for the installation, for more information run\n./installer.run --help\n\nWith the argument --listpkg, it will list the supported platforms for package generation, such as:\nPackage Maintainer(s): Alberto Milone <alberto.milone@canonical.com>\nStatus: *UNVERIFIED*\nUbuntu Packages:\n    Ubuntu/gutsy\n    Ubuntu/hardy\n    Ubuntu/intrepid\n    Ubuntu/jaunty\n    Ubuntu/karmic\n    Ubuntu/lucid\n    Ubuntu/maverick\n    Ubuntu/natty\n    Ubuntu/oneiric\n    Ubuntu/precise\n    Ubuntu/quantal\n    Ubuntu/raring\n    Ubuntu/saucy\n    Ubuntu/source\n    Ubuntu/trusty\n    Ubuntu/utopic\n\nSo as long as you don't use Vivid Vervet yet, you can create a package for your systems. I use 14.04.2, so I'll create a package for Ubuntu/trusty (this requires root):\nsudo installer.run --buildpkg Ubuntu/trusty\n\nIt may happen that you have to satisfy some dependencies before, in this case it will either attempt to do so automatically or tell you which packages are required. You can install them with\nsudo apt-get install <package1> <package2>\n\nAfterwards retry the creation. Repeat this until the generation succeeds (the program tells you so). The actual package generation can take quite a while. Below, you can see an example output I received on my system after a successful package generation:\nCreated directory fglrx-install.FJxoRh\nVerifying archive integrity...

Just type the ls command to see them. There will be three or four packages. You can install them with the following command:\nsudo dpkg -i <package1> <package2> <package3>\n\nOr, faster written:\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nAgain, dependency problems can occur. In this case run the following commands after dpkg has terminated:\nsudo apt-get install -f\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nNow, the driver will be installed. Run the command I already mentioned above and reboot:\nsudo aticonfig --initial\nsudo reboot\n\nStrangely, this always worked for me, whereas the prepackaged Ubuntu packages always crash my X Server. Another major advantage of this method is that the packages aren't bound to your computer and you can take the generated packages to any computer with the same OS and a Radeon or FireGL graphics system.\n\nEdit: I just learned that the latest version on AMD's website conflicts with Wine 1.6, a (to me) unreasonable dependency on PlayOnLinux. Have a look at this workaround, if you are affected. Alternatively, choose an older version of the driver or simply install it via the Software & Updates utility, as described above.\nEdit2: The package version and driver version of FGLRX doesn't always seem to match. So your update manager may think it can provide you with a more recent version, even if it isn't true. Thus, you may want to put the fglrx packages on hold:\nsudo apt-mark hold fglrx fglrx-core fglrx-dev fglrx-amdcccle\n\n\nA: I think that you should try with the open source driver.\nYou can uninstall the fglrx driver with:\nsudo /usr/share/ati/fglrx-uninstall.sh\nsudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx\n\nUninstall and reinstall this packages affected by fglrx:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge xserver-xorg-video-ati xserver-xorg-video-radeon\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-ati\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dri xserver-xorg-core\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\n\n", "Q: Installing Windows 7 after installing Ubuntu 14.10 I had little knowledge of Ubuntu before I installed it, and I still have little knowledge of it with it installed. I'm trying to work my way around Ubuntu 14.10 and I'm in utter confusion. Nothing makes sense, because I'm used to the extremely simple nature of Windows.\nI made the decision to wipe Windows from my computer entirely and replace it with Ubuntu. I'm stuck with an operating system that's too intricate for me to understand and I'm not really sure how to get Windows back.

I've tried to go through a few of the topics on here with the same problem but I didn't really understand how to go about any of it.\nHey, I might just buy a different computer sooner or later. But for now, I need Windows back on this computer.\n\nA: Just boot into the Windows disk, select the drive you wish to overwrite, and go through the normal Windows installation. It should wipe it clean and install Windows on it.\nAlthough, in Ubuntu, it's become so simple to use that you rarely should need to mess with your disk partitions or open up a terminal, and in most cases you can get support on using the command-line here.\n\nA: You need to get an installation media of windows. Because when you installed Ubuntu it deleted the windows partitions and installed itself. As such you need find or buy Windows again. in the form of a USB stick or a CD of windows. After that its a simple steps to follow the windows install steps. \n\nA: If windows is so extremely simple compared to linux, why did you manage to install linux, but cannot install windows?\nWhen you installed ubuntu, did you choose replace windows or did you choose a side by side installation?\nWhich version of windows and ubuntu are you using?\nLegacy bios or uefi boot?\nDo you have a windows install or recovery media?\nAnd last but not least, whhat are your usability problems in ubuntu?\n", "Q: BASH->Python (2.6) piping I need to translate this line of Bash into Python: \nsample1=($(/bin/cat /proc/meminfo | egrep 'MemTotal|MemFree|Cached|SwapTotal|SwapFree|AnonPages|Dirty|Writeback|PageTables|HugePages_' | awk ' { print $2} ' | pr -t -T --columns=15 --width=240))\n\nI know I need to use Popen and communicate I just don't know how to rearrange it.\nAny help?\n\nA: You don't need popen - popen is what you use to start a process.

The default ffserver.conf has two different <Stream> blocks blocks that use feed1.ffm, and I hadn't realized this, so even though I marked the first stream block as NoAudio, the second stream block was still requiring it.\nSwitching to a minimal ffserver.conf containing only the blocks and directives I needed fixed this.\n\nA: You don't need to kill the shell itself (bash, most likely) but just the ffserver process, then restart it.  This usually amounts to just using (in that shell window) Control-C, Up-Arrow (or Control-P), and return.\nI'm running my ffmpeg from inside of the /etc/ffserver.conf file using Launch (in a Feed section), so restarting ffserver does everything.  A basic Launch line might look like:\nLaunch ffmpeg -r 5 -i /dev/video0\n\nTo see if you have any strays running, use this (rather casual command) in a second window:  ps -ef | grep ff\n", "Q: Hibernation kills all programs Following this answer I was able to restore hibernation on my Ubuntu Vivid Vervet 15.04.

A while ago, I attempted to install flgrx on a machine with an AMD/ATI Radeon 6480g (SUMO) on an APU, which ended poorly and ended up requiring a reinstall because of the config being thoroughly messed up (including losing the radeon open-source driver). This was all on a 64-bit clean install of Trusty.\nI would like to try this again, with a newer version of the Catalyst drivers (also on a 64-bit clean install of Trusty). However, seeing as this is my primary machine and has been extensively configured, I would like to avoid the risk of corrupting graphics configuration greatly.\nIs there a way that I can install the Catalyst/flgrx drivers, such that I can choose between loading them, and loading the open-source radeon driver that I am currently using? I was thinking about tying them to a specific kernel version that I already have installed (and is known to work). This is based on the (possibly incorrect) assumption that whether the drivers are loaded is controlled by the initrd/initramfs and/or the command line that Grub passes to the kernel.\nCould someone clarify whether this is doable, and how I would go about doing it? I am OK manually moving Xorg or other configuration files in by hand if absolutely necessary. However, it is key for me that until I know the driver works stably, I have a radeon configuration that works, and my current kernel (as well as any new kernel versions/revisions installed by updates) still contains and loads radeon.\nMy kernel is 3.13.0-55-generic, and I have old kernels as far as 3.13.0-24-generic.\n\nA: This is not a complete step-by-step solution, but you look experienced enough. :-)\nFglrx driver is installed using dkms.\nYou can always remove this diver for a specific kernel by command\nsudo dkms remove <module_name>/<module_version> -k <kernel_version>\n\nmodule_name is fglrx or fglrx_pci if I remember it correct.\nAlso you can edit /usr/src/<module_name>-<module_version>/dkms.conf and remove AUTOINSTALL=yes from there.\nBut the problem may be in installation scripts that may blacklist radeon driver. So it needs some research in the deb package and testing.\nSo it is feasible, but IMHO it is not worth efforts.\nYou can always install fglrx from a deb package, and if something goes wrong just remove it from console.\n", "Q: Why don't my php files work on my Apache2 server? I am trying to get a survey (PHP files) to work on an Apache server. I tried it first with XAMPP, but then got the following error message:\nFatal error: Call to undefined function pg_escape_string() in /opt/lampp/htdocs/imageability/SkjemaDatabase.php on line 551\n\nI tried a variety of solutions to this to get PostgreSQL to work together with XAMPP, but nothing seemed to work. So I have now decided to try installing PHP5, Apache2, PostgreSQL (and MYSQL) seperately. I followed these instructions for the installations and thought I would have got PostgreSQL installed and working this time for sure. But instead of working, or rendering the same error message again, this just gives me a blank page when trying to check out the survey in Firefox. Am running Lubuntu 14.02 by the way.\nI have some other PHP files on the server that work fine. Could it still be something about PostgreSQL that's not working? While trying out XAMPP I tried uncommenting the following lines in my php.ini file\nextension=php_pdo_pgsql.dll\nextension=php_pgsql.dll\n\nBut now (with the various software installed seperately) I actually can't find the lines at all in /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini or /etc/php5/cli/php.ini, but I'm not sure which file to look in.\nI also read advise (during XAMPP problem with PostgreSQL) to copy the file libpq.dll from c:/xampp/php/ to /xampp/apache/bin/, but I didn't seem to have this file and still don't.\nBelow are some other ideas about what might be wrong, but maybe the above are more plausible?\nAnother problem I had during the process was that while following the last instructions at the link above, I made the mistake of creating a super user with password and switching to postgres user. After this I couldn't open Pgadmin3, so I switched back to the usual user and then that at least worked. Could my error now have something to do with still having this superuser? Or is there something I have to do in Pgadmin3 to get my survey to work on the server? (I.e. I haven't done anything in Pgadmin3 now, just installed the above mentioned software and put my files in /var/www/htlm/.)\nVery grateful for any help!\n\nA: Okay, I now found out the main problem was I didn't get any error messages. \nTo solve this, open the file /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini in a text editor as root.

I have created a custom Twitter app that is persistently, or constantly, connected to the API. It does tasks like downloading followers profiles, statuses etc. Cron jobs don't help much for this so I progressed to use the skeleton of the dev140 developers PHP daemon class for the Phirehose API (persitent connection streaming api). So I now mimic a bit of persistent connection state by having a daemon do the things that are actually singe api calls on the normal (non streaming api) that otherwise are done with cron jobs. The daemon just reads from a que table in database and if its not emty it know what to to with it. It are ids and a job type and then it goes of and fetch what I need when I need it with the max. bandwidth I can get within a 15 min frame window. Much much more steady this way.\nI made the following init script for starting this PHP daemon with php nohup from bash. It works fine (for me at least, please be as nice as you can to me, I have feeling:)  but I cant get the PHP daemon to start properly when it's a real boot.

Also on my hp pavilion dv 6 1230 us there is a bios option for turning always run fan on or off but the implementation of that is specfic to the netbooks motherboard. I also would see if your cpu useage on your netbook is high and maybe check the temperture and make sure it is not hot. If you turn the fan off during heavy load the laptop might overheat. One convient feature is lxpanel is you can add a temperture monitor to lxpanel by right clicking lxpanel panel settings panel applets and click add and select temperture monitor. However this does require hardware support and does not always work. You can check cpu useage in lxtask which can be started with the keyboard shortcut control alt delete. If you cpu is running hot like 70 or 80 degrees centigrade turing the fan off can cause overheating and damage your hardware. \nIf you are sure that the fan is running when it should not be under low load and temperture you may want to look into the fan control program but that may not always work. \n", "Q: I have problem when I implemented this command sudo apt-get install tcl8.5-dev tk8.5-dev I have problem when I implemented this command\nsudo apt-get install tcl8.5-dev tk8.5-dev\n\nAnd I get this: \nfawaz@fawaz-Lenovo-B590:~$ sudo apt-get install tcl8.5-dev tk8.5-dev\nReading package lists...

First some info\nLaptop= HP Probook 450 G1 i5\nDual Boot Win7 Pro/Deepin\nRam = 8Gb\nWifi  = Intel 3160  \nOkay, so I installed Ubuntu Wednesday Night, but on my laptop and the new version of Ubuntu just did not like each other,the wifi was so slow.  \nI got the slow wifi fix with the Help of Serg, mikewhatever and Trinadh venea, (Again Thank You) but it was just not giving me what I wanted.  \nSo Thursday Night I installed Deepin, and yes I know that it is based off of Ubuntu but it just was such a nicer looking OS.  \nOkay so now to what I did. I noticed that after the install the wifi SUCKED, and I mean worst then Ubuntu, but the Ethernet connection was great but the wifi not so much.  \nSo I went back the my first post and went into the wifi setting and set IPv6 to Ignore  and the speed got better, but not good enough.  \nSo I looked around the net and found someone that had downloaded the updated drive for their wifi adaptor and I followed the instruction and installed the updated firmwear.\nBIG MISTAKE. I LOST WIFI and  Bluetooth. Thank God I made a backup of the firmware and just re-install them, but here is the weird thing the Wifi is now a lot faster.  \nQuestions:\n(1) Has anyone else stumbled on this.\n(2) Is there a way to speed up the connection speed by tweaking the setting like SG TCP Optimizer for Windows.  \n\nA: Ubuntu has better driver/hardware support than even some of the distros based off of Ubuntu.\nFor instance, when I made the switch to Linux, Debian & Mint did not have the wireless driver that I needed, and another (non-Ubuntu based distro) had a working wireless driver that flat out sucked.\nInstead of using the current driver, you could remove it (back it up first) and use the Linux driver that Intel provides. http://www.intel.com/support/wireless/wlan/sb/CS-034398.htm\n", "Q: Ubuntu MX4 not detected on Ubuntu SDK Just got hold of the Meizu MX4 which comes pre-installed with Ubuntu Touch. I have been using the Ubuntu SDK for some time now, today I tried to deploy a simple app onto the device. \nHowever, several of my computers (all running Ubuntu 14.04) are unable to connect to the phone. What I mean by this is, when I connect the phone to the desktop via USB, Ubuntu SDK will not list the device in the devices tab. Things I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*'adb devices' will show no listed devices (I have tried different USB ports on different computers, and the daemon is running on the phone)\n\n*I have managed to log in via SSH.

It's a popup. Is there any way to stop these from appearing? Perhaps with a dconf-editor setting or something?\nThese popups appear frequently in Unity, like if you rest the mouse cursor on a Launcher icon. In the screenshot above the black box is appearing because the mouse cursor happened to come to rest on top of the \"Font colour\" button. You can experience it yourself at askubuntu.com by resting your mouse cursor over the large \"B\" (for making text bold) when posting a question like this. These popups drive me nuts and I really, really hate them. I would love to learn of a way to disable them.\n\nA: Your issue may be browser-related. If you're using Firefox (because your image is of NoScript), you could try something like this in a Stylish sheet (preferable) or in userChrome.css:\n/* AGENT_SHEET */ \n@namespace xul url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\n#aHTMLTooltip {visibility: hidden !important;}\n\nAlternatively, you could \"customize\" the color of the tooltip's background and text color using simple CSS.\nThe downside is that you may lose a lot of helpful hints.

What do I need to get Ubuntu OpenStack running in my existing environment? Do I need MAAS?\n\nA: I would go to the source on this one:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/cloud/install-ubuntu-openstack\nTheir hardware requirements are high, not in terms of resources, but in terms of the amount of hardware needed:\n\nInstalling Ubuntu OpenStack requires at least seven machines with two >disks, two of which have two network interfaces (NICs). Install Ubuntu >Server on one of the machines with two interfaces.\n\nTo meet these requirements, you can use the HP DL360 and some older machines you might have laying around or you can use VMs as noted in http://docs.openstack.org/juno/install-guide/install/apt/content/ch_basic_environment.html#basics-prerequisites\nYou can use many tools to create VMs, but as you would wind up with nested virtualization, Virtualbox is not an option.\n", "Q: blackscreen when i boot into ubuntu installer I am trying to install ubuntu on my acer laptop and when I boot a usb made from start-up disk creator it shows the loading screen for a bit and then it turns to a black screen with the backlight on. but when I turn it off it goes back to the loading screen. this might be because I tried to install xubuntu with live usb but it wouldnt work. so I am now trying to install ubuntu with a usb stick and its giving me the same thing but different loading screen.\n\nA: This has nothing to do with USB bootable. This is a known issue with laptops and desktops with graphics card in built in it. When you see the menu with install ubuntu, there is a modified option with TAB. You will see a option splash screen remove that and use nomodeset, sometimes the splash screen's resolutions conflicts with graphics card. Then it will boot properly. \n\nA: First of all, I apologize about my english, i hope you understand what i'm trying to say.\nMaybe your current OS installed on BIOS/legacy mode, while ubuntu installer trying to boot in UEFI mode. To solve this problem, try to set your BIOS to boot from your usb (make your usb as primary boot device) or enable UEFI on your BIOS on boot options.

See ssh(1) and sshd(8) man pages (man 1 ssh and man 8 sshd).  \nNote that if the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2, ~/.ssh, or your home directory is writable by other users, sshd will not allow it to be used.

So whenever you navigate into this dir you'll remain in same place so you think it's not opening.\nBut Why Ubuntu use such thing?\nSome apps expect some other apps inside the dir /usr/bin/X11 so for that ubuntu just keep them inside the /usr/bin and make symlink of /usr/bin/X11 to /usr/bin\nAnswering your comments\nJava installation in deed is not inside /usr/bin, infact it's under /usr/lib/jvm/...\nNow if you run whereis javait gives/usr/bin/java`, this doesn't mean that java installation is in /usr/bin, this indicates that only binary is in /usr/bin.\nman whereis\nNAME\n       whereis  -  locate the binary, source, and manual page files for a com‐\n       mand\n\nAnd In really either the binary inside /usr/bin is just a symlink to the original binary in /usr/lib/jvm.\n$ ls -l /usr/bin/java\n\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 22 Apr 10  2014 /usr/bin/java -> /etc/alternatives/java\n\nThis indicates that /usr/bin/java is symlink to /etc/alternatives/java, now let's check what is /etc/alternatives/java.\n$ ls -l /etc/alternatives/java \n\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 46 Apr 10  2014 /etc/alternatives/java -> /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java\n\nAnd here we go, that file is really also a symlink to /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java as we say before.\n", "Q: Light Video Player to download subtitles automatically Which one is the most lightware video player ?\nI watch usually normal videos, with not so high resolution...\nReferring to the hardware resources used tell me please do you recommend me a video player which comes with the most common codecs included, or is it possible to use a fast way in Linux to download/install the video and audio codec that I need for the video which I am trying to watch?\nIf this is possible how can I find in Linux the video codec which I need to see the video?\nOne of the most important option included would be to search and download subtitles for the video which I am watching to (would be better to search on more subtitles websites).\nThank you.\nIn my opinion it is not a duplicate of Programs to download subtitles for videos because the question is about a light video player with the subtitles download feature included too.\n\nA: If light on resources is your top priority, you can run your videos in a terminal with mplayer, no GUI == less resources\nmplayer /path/to/my/video\n\nNote: You don't have to type the videos name every time, just type mplayer and drag the videos icon on to the terminal.\nTo choose a custom resolution, swap the -x and -y values for your resolution. -fs starts the video in fullscreen.\nmplayer /path/to/my/video -fs -x 1280 -y 720\n\nSome other use full perimeters include -nosound to run muted and sub /location for loading sub titles.\nmplayer /path/to/my/video -nosound sub /location/of/sub/titles\n\nTo get a list of peramiters type mplayer in a terminal or go this page for a full manual.\nI highly recommend a frontend to set up your video options, even if you don't want to use it for playback, I like smplayer\nsudo apt-get install smplayer\n\nHeres a quick explination of auto subs, but it must be set up in smplayer I could not find any shell commands for this\nFrom the menu go to ->  Subtitles -> Find Subtitles on OpenSubtitles.org  A “Find Subtitles” dialog box will appear. In the Options, set the proxy settings if you are using any. From here\nIt will automatically search for subtitles on OpenSubtitles.org and display a list of available subtitles. Select any one from list and download that.\nFor codecs, all most users will ever need (and you should already have) is\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\n\nA: I would advice you to use VLC, it's light with many codecs. Install it:\n sudo apt-get update\n sudo apt-get install vlc browser-plugin-vlc\n\nTo learn how to get subtitles in VLC watch this video\nYou need to install a VLC extension called VLSub.\nINSTALLATION source:\n\n\n*\n\n*click on the download\n\n*save the archive and extract the file \"vlsub.lua\"\n\n*create a directory \"extensions\" at this location and put the file \"vlsub.lua\" inside ~/.local/share/vlc/lua/extensions/\n\nA: SMPlayer has this option too, as said here too.\n\n", "Q: Cant change file permissions for External Drive- Steam Related I use Chrubuntu and I have a extremely small amount off space on my computer I want to download steam but dont have enough space for my games. I heard you could download games onto a External Drive so i tried to but it wont allow me to change the file permissions. Does anyone know why and how to fix it.

(dell inspiron 7000) So, my harddrive recently went bust under warranty. As such, Dell shipped me a replacement. And a USB stick containing a full windows 8 installation and repair media. In the land of OEM installs and roms, that thing is a s good as gold. All the fun began when I decided to make a second partition to install Ubuntu on. Also, keep in mind that in order to boot the USB, I had to disable Secure boot, and run it in legacy mode (an option for my computer). Contrary to what I've read on this forum, it can boot win8 without UEFI no problem. The issue was when I installed Ubuntu 14.02 off of a live USB. At first it couldn't install grub properly, then after 3 install attempts it did so successfully but fried my windows boot loader. Using the windows repair tools I managed to get the boot loader working again, but now it ignored ubuntu. I used the live USB to switch the primary boot drive to the one containing GRUB, and updated GRUB so that it could find the windows 8 boot loader image. However, apon loading the win8 image though GRUB, I get a blank bergandy screen and have to force reboot.\nMy computer can't seem to run both Windows and Ubuntu, and I can't run UEFI because we'll, it literally doesn't exist on my computer anymore. Also, contrary to what I've read on the forum my PC can run 32 bit versions of ubuntu, even as a 64 bit machine. I have a 32 bit 12.04 boot disk that work perfectly fine. Infact, that. Disk. Seems to have been the only way to fix the boot partition problem I had earlier.\nCurrently, i've gon over with a fresh install of windows, there is still a dormant Ubuntu, swap, and win8 loader partitions. \n\nA: I'm going to take some key points of your question out of order:\n\nI can't run UEFI because we'll, it literally doesn't exist on my computer anymore.\n\nI think you misunderstand what UEFI is. As described in more detail on Wikipedia, the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) and its version-2.x variant, the Unified EFI (UEFI) is a type of firmware that has largely replaced the older Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware. As such, a computer will have either a BIOS or an EFI/UEFI when you buy it, and it's difficult to replace one with the other. The operations you described could not have removed your EFI. If your computer shipped with Windows 8.x, it almost certainly used UEFI, and continues to do so. Ditto for most computers introduced in mid-2011 and later, even if they shipped with Windows 7 (or Linux or nothing at all).\nYou might be thinking of the EFI System Partition (ESP), which as the name implies, is a partition on your hard disk. As such, the ESP can be deleted. The ESP stores EFI boot loaders, so if you completely wiped and re-partitioned your disk, it might now lack an ESP. That does not eliminate the EFI/UEFI, though.\n\nin order to boot the USB, I had to disable Secure boot, and run it in legacy mode (an option for my computer).\n\nWas this the Windows USB drive or an Ubuntu USB drive? If the latter, how did you create it?\nMost EFIs provide a Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which is an EFI component that enables the EFI to use boot loader code designed for BIOSes. A CSM is to an EFI something like what WINE or DOSEMU is to Linux -- a way for one environment (EFI or Linux) to run code designed for another one (BIOS or DOS/Windows). Enabling the CSM (aka \"legacy mode\" or \"BIOS mode\") support in the firmware makes it possible to boot BIOS-mode media, but at the cost of added complexity -- the number of paths the boot process can take rises dramatically, as I explain in more detail on this Web page. This complexity means that the boot process becomes unpredictable when the CSM is enabled -- at least, unless you understand the idiosyncracies of your specific computer, which of course people posting on the Internet will not. My view of the CSM has become increasingly negative as I've read more and more accounts of problems it's created for people. In most cases, they end up fumbling around in the dark until they stumble across a solution.\nIn any event, it seems odd (but not impossible) to me that a Windows 8 boot medium provided by a manufacturer would boot only in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, since such computers almost always ship configured to boot in EFI/UEFI mode. Ubuntu boot media are another matter, since USB-writing tools may drop the EFI boot loader or otherwise make it difficult or impossible to boot in EFI mode. In either event, I think it's worth taking the time to figure out what's going on and get both Windows and Ubuntu installation media to boot in EFI mode. If that proves impossible, it's imperative that they both boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. Having one installation in EFI mode and the other in BIOS mode is a recipe for frustration.\n\nThe issue was when I installed Ubuntu 14.02 off of a live USB. At first it couldn't install grub properly, then after 3 install attempts it did so successfully but fried my windows boot loader.\n\nThis doesn't really tell us what the state of your computer is. Please run the Boot Info Script (also available in the boot-info-script package in Ubuntu). This will produce a file called RESULTS.txt. Post it to a pastebin site and post the URL to your document here. The information from the Boot Info Script should provide a good idea of your computer's current state, which is required to provide a solution that's more than guesswork. At this point, my guess is that you've got a BIOS-mode Windows install and an EFI-mode Ubuntu install, but it might be the other way around or even something else entirely (matched-mode installs with boot problems that have some other cause).\nAlternatively, you could start again fresh -- figure out which boot mode you're using (BIOS or EFI) for both your Windows and Ubuntu media, adjust them until they both use the same boot mode, and re-install both OSes in the same boot mode.\n\nA: Every 64bit x86 CPU can run 32bit x86 instructions, so there is nothing special about that...\nAFAIK, 64bit UEFI only works with 64bit Ubuntu. I think when dual booting with Windows 8, using UEFI is the best alternative.\n\nI can't run UEFI because we'll, it literally doesn't exist on my computer anymore.\n\nHow do you mean that? If you didn't do a FW downgrade to a Legacy BIOS only firmware, you should be able to reenable UEFI in your BIOS setup.\nSo wipe the hard drive (if you have important files, have a backup), install your Windows and Ubuntu both in 64bit and with UEFI enabled, and it will more likely work out than what you did.\n", "Q: Hide System Settings Applications in Dash Is there any way to remove an application icon from the dash but keep it in the System Settings?\nI find it useless to have them in the dash, and it really clutters the display there..

For a few months I have the problem on my Ubuntu 14.04 box that when I plug in my Ethernet cable into, I get the IP 10.42.0.1 assigned instead of getting an IP via DHCP.\nI can fix this problem manually every time by clicking on the network-manager applet icon and clicking on Auto eth0, then I get an IP via DHCP.\n(Edit: My DHCP server in my router is configured to lease addresses in the range 10.10.10.*, and when I click Auto eth0, I get 10.10.10.110.)\nIn the good old days, I could just plug in the cable and Auto eth0 would become active automatically. I believe that this stopped working when I used the Shake internet connection feature, which I believe uses IPs in the 10.42.0.1 range.\nIn my network-manager settings, Auto eth0 is the only configuration available in the Ethernet section. In it's configuration, the box Automatically connect to this network when it is available is ticked, and its IPv4 Settings are set to Automatic (DHCP), IPv6 settings are set to Automatic.\nWhat can I do about this?\nI'd like to get auto-networking work just as before, when I plug in the cable.\n\nEdit: My /etc/network/interfaces:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n\nA: The solution should be as simple as editing your wired connection into Network Manager, then select the tab \"IPv4 Settings\" and then change the method, from \"Shared to other computers\" to \"Automatic (DHCP)\"\n\nA: It is simply because such IP range value is hard-coded into the NetworkManager. \n", "Q: What would be the consequences of uninstalling the net-tools package in a default Ubuntu system?

I want to get rid of this, and I think that uninstalling the net-tools package could help.\napt-get remove -s net-tools shows that the only other package to be removed would be \"ubuntu-minimal\", which is OK for me. I wonder if everything would keep working and if any change to system and applications network settings would then be needed.\nWhat would be the consequences of uninstalling the net-tools package in a default Ubuntu system? \n\nA: Nothing really, most of the important stuff either depends on the iproute2 package (ifupdown, isc-dhcp-client, …) or uses the kernel interfaces (through libnl-3-200) directly (network-manager, hostapd, iw, …).\nOf course some older software (especially software installed from outside of the repository) might still expect net-tools commands to be present as they were available on most unixoid systems for a long time. If you uninstall this package, then that is something you should keep in mind.\nAnyways: I just uninstalled net-tools myself… No issues yet!  If something does happen I'll try update my answer accordingly – it's pretty unlikely through.\n\nA: I have no problem with the uninstall net-tools in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. The Ubuntu do not use it.

I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 with xmonad on a relatively new retina MacBook Pro.\nDuring normal computing, my screen will turn black every once in a while. Moving the mouse, clicking, or pressing any key turns it back on.\nI am running xscreensaver but there's nothing in the xscreensaver log file about the blackout event. In Xorg.0.log, I see:\n[ 30821.541] (II) intel(0): switch to mode 2880x1800@60.0 on eDP1 using pipe 0, position (0, 0), rotation normal, reflection none\n\nWhen I'm watching full-screen media in e.g. VLC, the screen does not do this. I think that running xset -dpms; xset dpms every minute also prevents the problem.\nHow do I prevent this from happening in a way that doesn't interfere with normal xscreensaver behavior?\n\nA: I just researched Apple to find out many people have a problem with this particular screen https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4441040\nyou could try to replace the current display manager like this:\npress Ctrl+Alt+F2 now login and type:\nsudo service lightdm stop \nsudo apt-get remove lightdm\nsudo apt-get install gdm\nsudo service gdm start #or sudo reboot\n\nand yes Gnome all the way please post your results.\n\nA: I have had the exact same problem as you. I found that xmonad was buggy, so I recommend that you save your important files and install Ubuntu GNOME. It uses less possessing power aswell, so win win.\nSorry that you are just finding this out now.\n(Lubuntu will also work, but I had a high-performance system so I went with Ubuntu)\n\nA: I know this is an old post but I just learned a way to get the screen back when it goes black. It works consistently for me at least.\nPress CRTL+ALT+L to lock your screen (or SUPER+L)\nLet the screen sit for a few seconds. This should cause your screen saver to kick in and in my case I have that set to BLACK so the screen goes totally black and turns off.\nAt this point, any mouse or key action should kick your screen back on.\nI discovered this by accident after starting a long running command and having the screen go black. I wasn't about to reboot so I just sat there until my screen saver kicked on by itself then came back as soon as I hit the shift key. I have tried this a couple times since and it has worked every time for me.\nNot really a solution, but a work around to get the screen back.\n", "Q: How do I deal with mplayer2 forwarding latency? I use smplayer as default player on ubuntu 15.04, which is provided by mplayer2 now. It takes mplayer2 more than 3 secs to forward a video, which is unacceptable.

I do not see any documentation for the boot parameter iso-scan/filename=. I see the parameter is handled by the script at location scripts/casper-premount/20iso_scan in Ubuntu's initrd.

My configuration is the same as it has been for ages, but the new Ubuntu won't bring up the interfaces properly.\nThe first interface, eth0 does come up during boot but none of the 'up' scripts are run. I did try 'post-up' also without any success.  The 14.04 man page for interfaces says these are still supported...\nEither way, I get stuck in the dreaded \"Waiting up to 60 more seconds for network configuration\" hang at boot and no routing.\nIf I manually try ifup with the interfaces set to 'auto ethX' then I get an error.  If I comment out the auto lines, then I can get the ifup to work properly (including the up scripts).\nSo I did try to add '/sbin/ifup eth0 ; sleep 2 ; /sbin/ifup eth1' to the failsafe.conf file, but that too doesn't quite work.  eth0 comes up properly, but eth1 does not.\nI am thoroughly confused as to what is going on with this...  I thought about adding a startup script don't even know where to begin with this upstart thing in terms of ordering...  I just need the interfaces to be up before my main service daemon tries to start -- else it will fail startup because the interface is not there to bind to.\nThanks.  -Cheers, Peter.\n/etc/network/interfaces\n-----\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# Management Net interface\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n address 192.168.50.52\n netmask 255.255.255.0\n up /sbin/ip route add 192.168.50.0/24 dev eth0 src 192.168.50.52 table mgmtroute\n up /sbin/ip route add default via 192.168.50.254 table mgmtroute\n up /sbin/ip rule add from 192.168.50.0/24 table mgmtroute\n\n# Public Net interface\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet static\n address 192.168.60.52\n netmask 255.255.255.0\n gateway 192.168.60.254\n up /sbin/ip route add 192.168.60.0/24 dev eth1 src 192.168.60.52 table hostingroute\n up /sbin/ip route add default via 192.168.60.254 table hostingroute\n up /sbin/ip rule add from 192.168.60.0/24 table hostingroute\n\nUPDATE:\nHi Katu,\nI tried what you mentioned, but it doesn't work.  The startup script ends up running before the interfaces are up (after loopback is up and the fallback script completes) if the auto ethX is commented out.\nIt also doesn't work if the auto ethX lines are not commented out because the interface comes up without the route (up commands not run) and the eth1 interface never comes up automatically.\nUPDATE2:\nI haven't been able to solve this...

The apt-file manpage says:\n\n--regexp | -x\n                Treat pattern as a (perl) regular expression.  See  perlreref(1)\n                for  details.  Without  this  option,  pattern  is  treated as a\n                literal string to search for.\n\nTherefore my first try was\napt-file search --regexp .*ssl.*\\.so.*\n\nThis, however, gave me results such as\n\nwitty-examples: /usr/lib/Wt/examples/feature/client-ssl-auth/resources\n\nwhich has no \".so\" in the file name.\nI played around a bit and came up with\napt-file search --regexp .*ssl.*\\\\.so.*\n\ni.e. I escaped the backslash which was supposed to escape the dot. This gave me the results I wanted.\nCould someone explain why I need a double backslash in this case?\n\nA: You need a double backslash \\\\ because the single backslash is not only the regex escape character but also the one your shell uses. E.g. you escape the dot, which on shell level just interprets to a regular dot, that is then passed to apt-get and machtes every character (as a regular dot usually does).\nSo the answer is, first the string is interpreted by the shell, where the backslash has one meaning, and after that, it is passed to apt-get. The regex-engine of apt-get then interpretes the preprocessed string again. There the backslash has been replaced (and also has a slightly different meaning).\nAnother solution is to put the regex in quotes as in:\napt-file search --regexp '.*ssl.*\\.so.*'\n\n\nA: The problem is that as you are using no quoting, you need to escape both the shell and the regular expression interpreter both to interpret . as literal.\nThat's the reason why quoting is important. Your first pattern would work if you just use quotes around it :\napt-file search --regexp '.*ssl.*\\.so.*'\n\nThe main thing to note that our final goal is to let the regex interpreter of apt-file to take the . literally rather than in the usual manner i.e. any single character.\nThe second case :\napt-file search --regexp .*ssl.*\\\\.so.*\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The first \\ here is to escape the shell as shell treats any \\ as the part of backslash escaped sequences e.g. shell treats \\n as newline, \\t as horizontal tab etc. \nWith a single \\ as in .*ssl.*\\.so.*, the shell treats . as \\ escaped special character but . has no special meaning to shell, so just \\ is removed by shell leaving only a .. With \\\\. shell removes the first \\ leaving behind \\. as a literal \\ is represented by \\\\ in shell.\n\n*So we have .*ssl.*\\.so.* left as the Regex pattern to be interpreted by apt-file's Perl Regex interpreter. So you would get the desired result.\n\nA: If you don't use a quoted pattern, you have to escape the backslash for the RegEx:\napt-file search --regexp .*ssl.*\\\\.so.*\n\nWith a quoted pattern, you don't need that:\napt-file search --regexp '.*ssl.*\\.so.*'\n\n\nExample\n$ apt-file search --regexp .*ssl.*\\\\.so.* > ~/tmp/bar\n$ apt-file search --regexp '.*ssl.*\\.so.*' > ~/tmp/foo\n$ diff foo bar | wc -l\n0\n\n", "Q: Can I play a 'not available for Linux' game on Steam using Wine or PlayOnLinux? I bought a games bundle which has games that are both available and not available for Linux. I understand that to play the available games for Linux I only have to download Steam and voilà. But is it possible to play the games that are 'not available for Linux' by installing steam on PlayOnLinux or Wine and then installing the game with steam?\nI got Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: There are a few ways to do it, you could download steam for windows using wine then download the games, or if you had enough ram you could use virtualbox with a windows os. and if you're a hardcore gamer you could download windows alongside ubuntu.\n\nA: It's not Ubuntu question, but primarily Wine.

I've tried removing all references to exercism, including the exercism file in my $HOME/bin, and the corresponding addition to my $PATH that was placed in my bash profile. Doing so hasn't changed any of my results at all. The exercism site doesn't seem to have any support regarding uninstalling the client so I don't know if there's something else I should do. Any input would be appreciated.\nP.S.

I have installed Linux/Ubuntu to my PC but i cant understand how to combine my partitions /dev/sda and /dev/sdb . Altough my sda looks unallocated, I cant make them one.\nI have Ubuntu in USB and wanna install it to my PC from a clean harddisk, then  i need to divide it to 2 partitions again. One of them need to be ntfs, and the other partition is going to be where Linux installed. Please help me.!\n\nA: First, /dev/sda and /dev/sdb are disks, not partitions. (In the Windows world, the term disk is sometimes applied to partitions, but the terms mean different things. A disk is a physical device, such as a disk that's built into a computer or an external disk. A partition is a subdivision of a disk as described in a partition table, which is a simple data structure stored on a disk.) Partitions are normally numbered in Linux, as in /dev/sda1 or /dev/sdb5.\nChances are either /dev/sda or /dev/sdb is your USB installation medium and the other one is the hard disk built into your computer, but it's impossible to say which is which based on the information you've presented. It could also be you've got two hard disks.\nSecond, you can't really combine two hard disks; they're physically separate devices. That said, there are ways to combine them logically, such as RAID and LVM. Depending on your situation, using one of these tools may be appropriate, but that's far from certain based on the information in your question.\nThird, you say you want to divide your disk into two partitions, one of which should be NTFS. Why? If you intend to boot Linux alone on the computer, NTFS is a very poor choice for filesystem, for several reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Poor performance -- The NTFS-3g drivers used by Ubuntu are slow compared to the drivers for Linux-native filesystems like ext4fs, XFS, or Btrfs. Even FAT is faster in Linux (or was the last time I checked).\n\n*Repair impossibilities -- You can't repair an NTFS volume from Linux. There is a tool called ntfsfix, but it just does some basic checks and then marks the volume as needing repair by Windows.\n\n*Lack of support for Unix/Linux features -- Linux relies on Unix-style ownership, permissions, symbolic links, and some other filesystem features that are not provided by NTFS. (Actually, some of these are supported, but in ways that Linux can't use.) This prevents installing Linux to an NTFS volume. You can still store user data files on NTFS, but you may run into situations where you'll need these unsupported features even on a user-data volume.\n\n\nOf course, if you want NTFS because you intend to dual-boot with Windows, that's fine. In case of dual-boot installations, though, it's easiest to install Windows first, mainly because the boot loader that Windows installs is much less flexible than the one that Ubuntu installs, and the last-installed boot loader normally becomes the default.\nWith all this in mind, you might want to re-state your question. What is your true goal? For instance, do you want to install Windows on a computer that already has Linux installed? Are you running out of space on one partition and so need to resize them? Something else?\nAlso, when you edit your question, please include the output of the following command:\nsudo parted -l\n\nAdd four spaces to the start of each line of output. This will show us what your partition table(s) look like, which may be critical to answering your question.\n", "Q: How to access UBUNTU from USB HDD DISCLAIMER: I am very new to UBUNTU and Linux in general!\nI have installed UBUNTU on my external HDD. My computer has Win 8.1 on its HDD. What I want is to get the GRUB screen at bootup asking for UBUNTU or Windows Boot Manager. After installing UBUNTU on my external, I got that screen ONCE!

If you do a clean install, then you will need to re-install everything.\n\nA: You should always backup your data before upgrading your Ubuntu operating system. You can also backup the whole system depending on what is important to you.\nA correct upgrading will keep however your other settings as they are. \nI think these answers will be helpful for you to read them before upgrading.\n", "Q: Is it possible to make sandwhich aliases?

You need to use a function.\nHere is a simple function to do the job :\ndim() {\ncd /home/jason/Documents\nvim \"$1\"\ncd\n}\n\nThe function dim will take a file name as argument. You can put this code snippet at the end of your ~/.bashrc file and then run it as:\ndim file.txt\n\nReplace file.txt with any file name you want.\nTo run it from the current shell session, source the ~/.bashrc file first :\n. ~/.bashrc\n\n\nA: Not with aliases, use functions instead.\nFrom the Bash man page:\n\nALIASES\n[...] There is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement text. If arguments are needed, a shell function should be used (see FUNCTIONS below).\n\nSo your function could be:\n\nfunction dim () { cd ~jason/Documents ; vim $* ; cd - ;}\n\n", "Q: Dell 11 Ubuntu MATE: touchpad sensitivity problems (I also posted this in the Unix/Linux Stack Exchange. Not trying to spam you guys, just not sure where to post). I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 MATE on a Dell 11 Chromebook, and since booting for the first time, the touchpad has stopped responding unless I use the pad of my finger. \nBefore wiping the SSD and installing MATE I had been running Ubuntu XFCE alongside Chrome OS using Chrouton, and the touchpad worked like a dream. But since installing MATE I've been experiencing the weirdest issue. The touchpad reacts to pad of my finger - where the fingerprint is - but not the tip: If I use the pad of my finger to move the cursor, it works OK. But if I use the tip of my finger (the part you usually use to tap a touchscreen, and the part you normally use to move the cursor with a touchpad), the cursor won't budge. And even when I use the pad of my finger, the cursor doesn't always register the contact. \nIt seems that more finger surface has to be in contact with the trackpad for it to register. I've tried every combination of acceleration, speed, and sensitivity in the mouse settings and in gpointed, turned off \"disable touchpad while typing,\" etc, but nothing works. According to xinput list it's a Cypress APA Trackpad.  \nHere's the full output of xinput:\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Cypress APA Trackpad (cyapa)              id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                     id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                                 id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Sleep Button                              id=9    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Sleep Button                              id=10   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Integrated_Webcam_HD                      id=11   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard              id=13   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\nEDIT: I tried adding a regular physical mouse, and it works fine. But I don't think my problems are caused by a hardware malfunction, because the touchpad was working fine yesterday when I used Chrome OS and XFCE. \n\nA: Figured it out! As per this Arch Linux installation tutorial, I edited my /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-cros-touchpad.conf file and added Option \"FingerLow\" \"5\" and Option \"FingerHigh\" \"10\". Now the touchpad works just fine! Here's the full output of 50-synaptics-conf:\n# Additional options may be added in the form of\n#   Option \"OptionName\" \"value\"\n# See man synaptics (4) for details\n\nSection \"InputClass\"\n Identifier \"touchpad ignore duplicates\"\n # Ignore events from old driver\n MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n MatchOS \"Linux\"\n MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/mouse*\"\n Option \"Ignore\" \"on\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputClass\"\n Identifier \"touchpad catchall\"\n # Device\n Driver \"synaptics\"\n MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n\n # sensitivity\n Option \"FingerLow\" \"5\"\n Option \"FingerHigh\" \"10\"\n\nEndSection\n\n# End of configuration file\n\nIt's strange that editing the sensitivity settings using gpointed didn't work. \n\nA: it is probably because you need a better driver for Ubuntu mate to better utilize the touch pads functions. It could be that the OS doesn't sufficiently sense the motion from the touchpad.\n", "Q: Is it safe to delete apt-snapshot-*? I think I did a mistake when I decided to use Btrfs.

Again, to list snapshots, run:\nsudo apt-btrfs-snapshot list\n\nThen, to delete a snapshot, run:\nsudo apt-btrfs-snapshot delete @<name-of-snapshot>\n\nTo list by date older than two days, for example, run:\nsudo apt-btrfs-snapshot list-older-than 2d\n\nTo delete all snapshots older than two days, for example, run:\nsudo apt-btrfs-snapshot delete-older-than 2d\n\nThe cool thing is that your old default will not be deleted so you can still roll back to that one if you have one set.\nDeleting snapshots should take effect immediately.\n\nIf you get a \"no space on device\" error after you boot, you can attach a blank USB pendrive or external drive and use the command line to mount the drive at /tmp.\nAfter mounting the drive at /tmp you should have enough available space to run:\nsudo apt-btrfs-snapshot delete-older-than \n\n\nA: Looks like it is safe. I've seen other attempts to do this and it turned to be not so simple.\nFirst, run the following command to see which partition is your btrfs partition (assuming you only have one btrfs partition):\nlsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE | grep btrfs| grep -o sda.\n\n\nThe following uses /dev/sda3 as an example.\nHere is how I did it:\n# mkdir /mnt/tmp\n# mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/tmp\n# ls /mnt/tmp         \n@  \n@apt-snapshot-release-upgrade-utopic-2014-10-23_20:38:40  \n@home\n\nHere is the correct partition:\n# btrfs subvol delete /mnt/tmp/@apt-snapshot-release-upgrade-utopic-2014-10-23_20:38:40 \nTransaction commit: none (default)\nDelete subvolume '/mnt/tmp/@apt-snapshot-release-upgrade-utopic-2014-10-23_20:38:40'\n\n# btrfs subvol list /\nID 257 gen 397869 top level 5 path @\nID 258 gen 397869 top level 5 path @home\n\nNot much space was freed:\nvic-UX32VD# df\nFilesystem         1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda3          120729076 117384216   1996232  99% /\n\nA restart helped:\nFilesystem         1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda3          120729076 109894736   9187296  93% /\n\n", "Q: Partition merge Can anyone help me reagrding this?

You can move them, expand or shrink.\nIn your case you will have to move Windows partitions. But after that Windows will not boot. You will have to restore Windows bootloader.\nThe easiest way will be to install Ubuntu to the last partition and e.g. make a swap partition of the first one.\nIMHO it is not worth effort to move all Windows partition. It takes a lot of time, some skill and it is potentially dangerous for your data.\nAnother option will be to re-install Windows.\nYou can wipe your disk, remove existing partitions, install Windows on 1 or 2 partitions at the beginning of the disk.\nThen you will be able to create partitions for installing Ubuntu.\nWithout gparted screenshot it is hard to tell what is extended partition, but I suspect, that it is the first one.

I'm tired of right-clicking. Can I do a \"Save Link As\" by holding a keyboard button and clicking the link?\n\nA: The other answers are correct for Firefox. \nFor Chrome it's even easier: \nOption+Click (Windows: Alt+Click) saves the link-target to the download folder. \n\nA: You can restore the old Alt-click \"Save Link As\" functionality in Firefox:\nOpen a new tab in Firefox. In the Firefox address space, type:\nabout:config\nClick the \"I'll be careful, I promise\" prompt.  Type\nbrowser.altClickSave\nin the Search space.  Double-click on the browser.altClickSave line to change the value from false to true.  Close the about:config tab.\nNow when you Alt-click on a valid download link it will open the Save As explorer screen.  All you need to do is set the correct location and press Enter.  Once you set the download location, if you are downloading a lot of files into the same location, all you need to do is press enter.  This will greatly speed up your download process.\nI did the above process in Windows 7.  It should also work in Ubuntu.\n\nA: On Linux due to the fact that Alt+Click is captured by X11 to manipulate window position to have this working you need quickly:\n- Press LMB (and keep pressed)\n- Press left Alt key (and keep pressed)\n- Release LMB\n\nA: The easiest solution for firefox:\nK + Right Click\nPress K and click with you right mouse button on the link. Release all buttons before the \"Download\"-Dialog opens up or you will get some K's as the filename.\nI can't provide a source as this seems to be an undocumented feature. (Can't see it mentioned here atleast).\n\nA: Save Linked Page (when a link is selected) (for firefox):\nOn Windows : Shift+Enter\nOn Mac : Option+Enter\nOn Linux : Shift+Enter\n(See more shortcuts)\n\nA: One solution I found to this, is if you click on the link and open it, you can use \nctrl+s to save it. It is still slow though.\n", "Q: Add script to System -> Preferences -> Startup Applications I want to run a script that changes the mapping of my keyboard from the startup applications. The script is in my home folder and it has permissions 755.\nI've created a new entry in System -> Preferences -> Startup Applications and tried the following commands:\n/bin/bash /home/myuser/myscript.sh\n/sbin/sh /home/myuser/myscript.sh\n/home/myuser/myscript.sh\n\nNone of them worked. The same commands work fine when I run them from a terminal manually.\nI know of other ways to run a script at startup, but I want to know why is this method not working for me.\n\nA: Startup scripts, related to keyboard- or touchpad settings, or include wmctrl or xrandr commands often need \"a little break\" before running. If they run too early, before the desktop is fully loaded, they either break or \"miss their target\".\nTo solve that, you need to add:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 10 && /home/myuser/myscript.sh\"\n\nto your startup applications. Possibly you need to play a little with the sleep 10 value to optimize.\nNote\nProbably the script exists of only one or two commands, you could include them in your startup command, with the same syntax. That way you do not need a separate script.\n", "Q: Minecraft crash on Ubuntu 14.10/15.04 Lately my Minecraft has been crashing with the error code:\nSIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x00007f4190031ac0, pid=26588, tid=139920718653184\n\nI have an Nvidia graphics card but have no drivers installed as I have Nvidia Optimus. I am running Intel integrated graphics.\nHere is my full crash log: http://pastebin.com/FuFeTCBC\nI can supply more details if you wish, my theory was bad ram but a Memtest doesn't return any errors.\n\nA: SIGSEGV (SEGmentation Violation SIGnal) indicates a Segmentation fault, i.e. a program trying to access memory or other resources it mustn't.\nThis can be caused by bad memory, but as you said, memtest didn't find anything. The most likely cause for segfaults is a bug in a program (in this case Java) or a driver (e.g. the free Xorg nVidia driver, like you suggested) or a combination of incompatible pieces of software.\nJust because you have hybrid graphics, you should install the proprietary nVidia driver, which AFAIK supports Optimus better than the free Xorg driver for nVidia chips. You can install it using the Software & Updates utility. Select the first unchecked suggestion for your graphics card in the Additional drivers tab. It should automatically install nvidia-prime, the Optimus support package.\nIf this doesn't solves your segfaults, the problem is somewhere else. In this case, install another Java version and try again with that. If you are lucky, you'll already have OpenJDK 7 installed, whose JRE you can try instead. Else, install another version of Oracle Java or OpenJDK and try with that.\nIf even this doesn't work, it's most likely a bug in a native library used by Minecraft. Ask Mojang in this case.\n", "Q: gcc is gone probably after an update gcc was installed in my system at the start, I still remember using it but after some time it was gone and replaced by some other versions of gcc.\nWhen I type in gcc from the terminal several suggestions were displayed (gcc-4.8, gcc-ar-4.8, gcc-nm-4.8, gcc-ranlib-4.8). \nI'm not familiar with any of them but I think gcc-4.8 is a new version of gcc, I tried to use it to compile a program and it worked the same with gcc. \nI would like to know if this is because of a system update I did recently and why does Ubuntu have this kind of program replacement.\nAdditionally, how can I run gcc like how I used to before (using the gcc program). I'm thinking of making a link to the gcc-4.8 and naming it gcc but I'm open for best practices or your personal suggestions.\n\nA: /usr/bin/gcc is just a symbolic link, eg:\n$ ls -la /usr/bin/gcc\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Mär 12 17:28 /usr/bin/gcc -> gcc-4.9\n\nWhy the link on your system does not exist (anymore), we can only speculate about it.\nYou have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the symbolic link\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-4.8 /usr/bin/gcc\n\nor\n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall the package gcc\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall gcc\n\nI would prefer the second option.\n", "Q: Gradle executing tasks runs forever Recently, I've downloaded latest android-studio for Ubuntu.

The error message says,\nGradle executing tasks\n\nBut, when i stop android studio, it says,\nGradle successfully finished.\n\nSo, what causes this error? Is this error from my side or from android studio?\n\nA: I too had the same error. The libz.so.1 was missing. \nFixed this by\nsudo apt-get install lib32z1\n\n\nA: In my case i already had lib32z1 installed.\nThe problem was Genymotion plugin. Once i removed it from studio and restarted. It worked fine. I still don't know how that could happen as i regularly use genymotion with studio in my other machines. You can still run genymotion even if you remove studio plugin by starting emulator from genymotion itself.\n\nA: First sync with the grade files and then check the grade console for some errors. I had two applications aapt and zipalign being blocked by the ubuntu bash. You have to go to your SDK folders and check for the appropiate build-tools(for mine it was 23.0.2, you can find this in the grade console while file sync) and then mark the files as \"Allow Executing Files as Program\".

Scrolling up on the mouse wheel does not have this problem no matter how fast I scroll up with the wheel.\nI am seeing the problem mentioned here.\nDoes anyone have any ideas on how to address this?\n\nA: Fixed this, by ejecting the guestaddition.iso and re-inserting it from the VBox menu.\n", "Q: Java Version not changing I do not understand why java is always causing problems when having multiple versions on the same machine.\nHere is a screenshot of what I did:\n\nWhy is it not changing?

Hence I thought of setting up a firewall. It was not as easy as I thought. My current set up is that all incoming connections are blocked except ssh. Is there a way by which I can configure Ubuntu to give me notifications whenever a new connection is made/attempted, both IN/OUT? \nThe idea is that I need to be informed in real time about this, ideally via notify-send. Then I should be able to suppress some notifications, which are redundant. Is it possible to do this?  \n\nA: You could monitor the output of netstat. the flags -tpan allow viewing which program uses which port. In theory you could write a simple script that constantly checks number of those connections with  grep, and if the number of connections have changed, you could get a notification. Note, that sshd won't be shown unless you run that command with sudo, so the script would probably need to be ran with sudo as well. I doubt notify-send would allow listing large amount of connections , but you could use zenity and it's list dialog.\nAnother way, though only for incoming connections, is not monitor who command. Since you're blocking all connections except ssh, you're probably more concerned with who's loggin in into your machine. You could use watch -n5 -d who , where -n is the interval for repeating the command in seconds, and -d is the flag to high light differences between the previous and current result of the command\n\nA: You could, but it would be a bad idea: your notify system will be overwhelmed by the constant sniffing/probing from the Internet and your outgoing connections …\nIf you still want to move ahead, I would:\nFirst move the iptables log to it's own file\nand then open a terminal window and do a:\ntail --follow /var/log/iptables.log\n\nand then you'll understand why having a notify isn't really practical …\n", "Q: vim binary with all libraries statically linked I want to build vim with all libraries, which vim depends on, statically linked.

Then you can access most files using a GUI and can delete anything you want.  \nIf you want to do more, you need to put your phone in developer mode and run the file manager as root as well. \nWarning: you can delete everything when using the root mode, including system files which can then brick your phone.

Is it possible to boot faster with Windows 8.1 when dual booted with Ubuntu (14.04)?\nI am familiar of fast boot being disabled during installation of Ubuntu.

I even tried  setting default boot to Windows 8.1.\nElse, can I at least choose which OS should be booting fast?\nRight now Windows is the default OS on grub, but still Ubuntu is booting quicker than Windows.\nAny help is appreciated!\n\nA: Window 8 \"Fast Boot\" feature is not actually boot at all. It is hibernation.\nWhen you install Ubuntu it is recommended to disable fast boot in Windows, because if Windows is hibernated, you can not mount Windows partitions with read/write capabilities in Ubuntu.\nYou can enable fast boot in Windows, if you do not use NTFS partitions in Ubuntu or use them in read only mode.\nBut Ubuntu just really boots fast.

Drives get assigned a letter by the order they are found. Make a live USB stick and fix your /etc/fstab.\nlsblk\n\nwill show the drives.\nAlso, its a good habit to mount drives in /etc/fstab using an UUID rather than /dev/sdX.

Yet on Yosemite the SSD is around 40-50°C. \nWhat is wrong ?\n(Macbook air early 2014, 6.2)\n\nA: This might be due to different factors. \n\n\n*\n\n*The graphic driver you use, might impact the power consumption and thus the temperature. \n\n*If you are using a long term support (LTS) version of ubuntu, you are less likely to be running inappropriate drivers simultaneously. \n\n*As a precaution, given your situation, please avoid running the macbook air with lid closed (e.g. when connected to an external monitor) until you resolve this. \n\n\nHave you tried installing the mac fan control daemon? \nsudo apt-get install macfanctld \n\nThis helps controlling many performance issues interrelated to the CPU, fan, Temp. \n\nA: I run Ubuntu on an iMac and MacBoook. On my iMac I've had to manually control the fan rate because a faulty read from the internal temperature sensor. I'd recommend seeing what temperature readings you're getting and consider manually setting the fan rate.\n\nA: There could be a number of reasons why that might be happening, try running iotop that'll give you an idea what's taking a dole on your SSD and quite frankly MAC dosen't have a very good history of playing well with anything other than OSX. \n\nA: When an SSD gets too hot it slows itself down. When you first boot your laptop run a speed test:\n$ sudo hdparm -tT /dev/nvme0n1p5\n\n/dev/nvme0n1p5:\n Timing cached reads:   16410 MB in  1.99 seconds = 8228.22 MB/sec\n Timing buffered disk reads: 6190 MB in  3.00 seconds = 2063.30 MB/sec\n\nWhen you see it hit 70 degrees rerun the test. If the speed is reduced it confirms the drive is getting hot. If the speed is consistent it could be a faulty temperature report.\n", "Q: Can't connect to Wifi in Ubuntu Gnome 14.04 I just switched from windows to linux today so I'm a noob at this.

This is due to ui module will override the default setting, as explained in this subtopic on the Wiki:\n\nTherefore, if UI is used, the PROMPT directive is ignored and the UI command -- not the DEFAULT command -- is automatically launched\n\nDefault /isolinux/isolinux.cfg\n# D-I config version 2.0\ninclude menu.cfg\ndefault vesamenu.c32\nprompt 0\ntimeout 50\nui gfxboot bootlogo\n\nModified /isolinux/isolinux.cfg\n# D-I config version 2.0\ninclude menu.cfg\ndefault live\nprompt 0\ntimeout 50\n#ui gfxboot bootlogo\n\nI have tested the modified configuration using Xubuntu 14.04 ISO image, but the same steps should apply to other Ubuntu and official derivatives.\nPart B: Run custom app\nAs for launching the application, it should be doable by adding the path of target executable to the \"startup\" menu or something similar. For example, on Xfce Desktop Environment, it is found at Settings Manager > Session and Startup > Application Autostart.\nAbove all, my answer is more toward the solution for \"Skip install/Boot to desktop\".

There is no need for an indefinite while loop, you can use a tool that uses the interface provided by the kernel to check for any changes on any file.\nOne of the tools that uses inotify is inotifywait. From man inotifywait :\ninotifywait efficiently waits for changes to files using Linux's inotify interface.\n\nIt is not installed by default, it is a part of inotify-tools package. You can install it by :\nsudo apt-get install inotify-tools\n\nThe script i am taking about can take the form :\n#!/bin/bash\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do\n    parent=\"${line%% *}\"\n    child=\"${line##* }\"\n    new=\"${parent}${child}\"\n    [[ -d $new ]] && touch \"$new\"/\"$child\".md\ndone < <(inotifywait --quiet --monitor --event CREATE,ISDIR /home/tim/test)\n\nYou can send it to the background :\n./dir_event.sh &\n\nOr perhaps use nohup or disown if you want :\nnohup ./dir_event.sh &\n\n\n\n*\n\n*inotifywait --quiet --monitor --event CREATE,ISDIR /home/tim/test is the command to monitor the file system events on directory /home/tim/test, we are only interested in CREATE and ISDIR events. We are saving (as line) and then manipulating every new line indicating a relevant event as they happen. Please check man inotifywait to get more idea.\n\n*parent will contain the directory we are monitoring /home/tim/test in this case and child will contain the newly created directory/file. Both are achieved by using bash parameter expansion.\n\n*new is addition of the two to get the absolute path to the newly created entry. As CREATE event will result in creating a file too we need to make sure that new is a directory.\n\n*[[ -d $new ]] checks if new is a directory, if so then we have created the required file inside it.\n\nA: Try this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor d in */; do\n    touch $d/$d.md\ndone\n\n\nA: This is what I've ended up using.\nwhile :\ndo\n    for dir in *; do\n        if [ \"$dir\" != \"Untitled Folder\" ];\n        then\n\n            if [ \"$(ls \"$dir\")\" = '' ];\n            then\n\n                touch \"$dir/$dir.md\"\n            fi\n        fi\n    done\ndone\n\nThanks to @Grammageek, his original post really helped with the for loop concept.. \n", "Q: Installation of a stable release of the Elementary OS Desktop (Pantheon) on Ubuntu 14.04 Since Elementary OS is a Ubuntu based distribution I think it should be fairly easy to install a stable version of Pantheon on Ubuntu (in my case 14.04). I have seen that many people have tried and there are lots of solutions but almost all of them are outdated or suggest pulling a unstable version of Pantheon from the test repository of Elementary.\nI tried the following, but it does not work. (resource here)\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:elementary-os/stable\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install elementary-desktop\n\nHowever the above leads to a disaster. Somehow Pantheon installs over Unity and the result is a strange mixture between them - The unity launcher with the Pantheon icon pack and font. Of course I tried to log out in order to select the Pantheon shell but it was missing from the list with desktop environments (a system restart did not help as well).\nLuckily I managed to delete Pantheon and now everything is back to normal but I would like to be able to run it.\nTL;DR Is there a way to install a stable version of Pantheon as a separate desktop environment on Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: You must use these commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:elementary-os/daily\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:elementary-os/testing\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:elementary-os/os-patches\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get install elementary-desktop\n\n[ Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5dK74bnBOY ]\n\nA: After being in your same boat, and not finding terrific answers, I think I have figured out why you (and I) were having issues: Freya is only on Trusty. This means that if you're running a version above what is listed, the ppa will point to a non existent repository by default. \nSo executing this:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:elementary-os/stable\n\nWill look like this, once installed:\nhttp://ppa.launchpad.net/elementary-os/stable/ubuntu/wily/main\nWhich currently does not exist.\nI'm assuming that at the time you tried this, Trusty was not considered stable yet.\nSo, to avoid this, make sure you add the version you want. I'm not enough of a BASH hound to know how to do this from the terminal. The command listed on the eOS launchpad doesn't seem to work for me.\nBUT, you can acccomplish the same thing in Synaptic. Go to the repositories by clicking Settings>Repositories and go to the Elementary OS repo and click \"edit\". Under version, change it to Trusty instead of your version.\nI should mention that this may be why people are recommending using the daily instead of the stable. eOS seems a little behind the main distro on releases (understandable), so just because you're on the latest stable Ubuntu doesn't mean that's the latest stable eOS.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Choppy cursor when keys pressed I'm having a problem with cursor movement on my laptop.

Currently i have 3 domains on a vps from digital ocean (running 14.04). Ive installed a lamp stack by following tutorials. Now I looked for an own mail server but most forums said it wasn't easy and is alot of work to maintain and advice to pay for one https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/why-you-may-not-want-to-run-your-own-mail-server . how hard is it to install and to maintain compared to a lamp stack.  I have basic knolwedge of ubuntu. Is it adviced to just buy one ?  \n\nA: It's easy to host a mail server in Ubuntu... But it's really hard to do it well.\nIt's almost impossible for a novice to do it as well as a professional company can.\nYou can boil the arguments down to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Uptime. Professional mail hosts can have multiple MX machines reading your email into a load-balaced cluster database. They'll be up 99.999999999% of the time. If your one server goes down, people sending email to you will see bounces. It won't look very good and you'll lose incoming email.\n\n*Spam. It takes billions of incoming emails to accurately detect which messages are really spam. That's why players like Gmail are so good at it. Tools like Spam Assassin rely on numbers and accurate training (which Gmail et al generate through crowd-sourcing all their users' input).\n\n*Security. Mail delivery, processing and access —including webmail— has so many attack vectors. It isn't like a webserver that you can do request analysis and frame limits on. Many processes interact with this foreign, possibly unsafe data and there are so many emerging attacks on every part of that stack. You have to stay on top of it all the time.\n\n*Blacklists and whitelists. The abundance of spammers has made many spam filtering systems work at least partially on lists of known spammers. If your provider gets a bad reputation for allowing spam, your IP could be caught up in a blacklist of their entire IP range. This will result in your outgoing emails simply being dropped.\nThere are many \"certified\" whitelist programmes around too where companies can pay to be included. These are typically expensive to join but this is what you need if you plan on sending a lot of email.\nHosted email is cheap (it can even be free) and there are some great options out there. If this is worth nothing to you, feel free to host it yourself, but honestly, a smart person lets somebody else deal with the headache.\n\nThat is not to say that either basic server or LAMP security are walks in the park. Ubuntu will handle the basic security —as long as you keep up to date with package updates— but you have to manage unpackaged things like Wordpress and Drupal installs, as well as making sane decisions to firewall away non-essential services, and not making any configuration faux pas.\nEven things like basic SSH hardening (disclosure: mine) can take a while.\n", "Q: Backintime won't start (no module named dbus) I've got the following error on Ubunu 14.04 :\n\nuser@ubuntu:~$ sudo backintime\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/share/backintime/common/backintime.py\", line 26, in \n    import config\n  File \"/usr/share/backintime/common/config.py\", line 30, in \n    import tools\n  File \"/usr/share/backintime/common/tools.py\", line 27, in \n    import dbus\nImportError: No module named dbus\n\nI've already tried to install/uninstall python-secretstorage, but it seems it doesn't change anything ...\n\nA: You're missing some dependencies.

I have two separate Google accounts set up, both of which allow access to the GMail app that came pre-installed on the phone, but there are no notifications when I receive new mails. Am I missing something?\n(My question seems to be related to this question, with the differences being the phone and the fact that I have never managed to receive any mail notification at all)\n\nA: I have the same phone and also use Gmail. I do get a very gentle tap when I receive an email, and a popup at the top of the screen, and a notification in the task bar. The sound is rather subtle but still quite noticeable. I can't find where to change the sound. I didn't change anything to get it working. I do know a few settings that might be connected to your problem, so just to make sure the obvious stuff is set correctly:\nIn System settings - Notifications, there should be a listing of all apps that are allowed to notify you. For me that's External drives, System Settings, Facebook, Gmail and Telegram. To the right of each entry is a radio button to switch it on or off.\nSo: is Gmail listed there? If so, and turned off, easy fix. If not, your account may not be OK. Go back to system settings and to Accounts (one to the left). There, Google should be listed with your mail address underneath. If so, enter it by tapping. At the top is your ID, below are the different apps that use Google account. Is Gmail shown? Is the button switched on?\nIf you're in doubt whether your account settings are correct, you could remove and add back your google account from the accounts settings.\nOtherwise, I wouldn't know what to do... Good luck anyway!\n", "Q: novice Ubuntu-user: beginners assistance Hello possible fellow Ubuntu-users,\nUntil now I've been using Windows operating systems and my current laptop is going to retire soon. In my search of a new, basic (read: not too expensive) laptop I thought about Ubuntu several times. As a computer enthousiast I have a basic knowledge and interest but this is far from the expert-level. Recently I was pleased to see a big computer brand to launch a budget model including a pre-installed Ubuntu Linux 14.04 SP1 operating system with the following specs:\nProcessor: Intel® Celeron® Processor N2840 (1M Cache, up to 2.58 GHz) \nOperating System: Ubuntu Linux 14.04 SP1 \nMemory: 4GB Single Channel DDR3L 1600MHz (4GBx1) \nHard Drive: 500GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive \nVideo Card: Intel® HD Graphic \nDisplay: 15.6-inch HD (1366 x 768) Truelife LED-Backlit Display \nWireless: 802.11bgn + Bluetooth 4.0, 2.4 GHz, 1x1\nThe laptop will be used for the basis stuff: internet, documents,...\nDoes this configuration seem adequate to run Ubuntu smoothly?\nI'm also considering to change the 5OOGB HDD with a 250 SSD drive for some faster handling.\nHaving read some basis research it should be possible. However I'm doubting if I will succeed to transfer the pre installed files to the new SSD drive and run Ubuntu. Any experiences for a Ubuntu novice are highly appreciated.\nHopefully you guys or girls can guide this windows-user into a new and bright Ubuntu age :-)\nthx alot!\ngrtz\n\nA: Ubuntu (as any other Linux distribution (Linux is the kernel, a distribution provides a working environment based mostly on other open source applications)) would work well on this PC, especially when you add the SSD. But of course \"good performance\" is always a little bit subjective, so just try it out. To make things easy start a new installation of Ubuntu on the new SSD, you can then copy any important files via a 2.5\" harddisk USB adapter. When you have transfered your files use this HDD for backup.\nFor web browsing you can install chrome or firefox via the Ubuntu Software Center. For email you can use thunderbird. Linux and Open Source is about freedom so choose the applications that suit your needs at best.\nIf you discover issues with your hardware you can open a command line (= terminal or console) and you'll get hardware information via the commands lshw, lspci, lsusb. You can then google for help on driver settings or similar.\n", "Q: How to change Ubuntu title bar text I would like some help.

I want to install Ubuntu 14.04 or 15.04 on it, but I am failing right from the beginning. I cannot get Ubuntu to launch.\nOne particularity is that it is a French version of Windows 8.1, but I doubt that this should be an issue.\nOn a USB key with 7.7 GB of free space, I have created a Live USB of Ubuntu 14.04, using the instructions I find here.\n\n\n*\n\n*If I run wubi.exe before rebooting the computer, then I get an error saying that /ubuntu/winboot/wubildr.mbr is missing or contains errors.\n\n*If I uninstall using Control Panel > Uninstall a program > Ubuntu, then I get no option to boot from the Live USB drive. The computer boots directly into Windows 8.1\n\n*If I try to run the wubi.exe on the 15.04 iso, then it tells me \"Wubi does not currently support EFI\"\n\n\nI understand that Windows 8.1 runs in UEFI mode, and that I should install Ubuntu in UEFI mode too.\nI have ventured into the BIOS and disabled secure boot. I have switched off fast startup. I have shrunk the Windows partition, and created a 3 partitions for /, /home, and /swap... but I since I cannot get the computer to boot into Ubuntu from a Live USB, there is no way for me to install it onto these partitions.\nI have already read this article (among many others), but I cannot get past \"Boot a live ... USB flash drive in EFI mode\".\nOn this page, I see a suggestion that I should disable  Intel Smart Response Technology, but I did not find any clear steps on how to do this, while I did find reports that Ubuntu runs happily on systems with SRT enabled.\nIs there a vital step that I have missed?\n\nEDIT: Following the recommendations of @Rod Smith, I have used Rufus to create a bootable USB drive, using the iso for Ubuntu 14.04, with a GPT partition for UEFI.\n\nI had imagined that it would be enough to reboot the computer with the USB drive in place, and that I would be offered a choice of Ubuntu or Windows. However, the computer simply boots straight into Windows without giving me a choice, even when I tell the BIOS to give first priority to the external drive.\nWhat do I need to do to tell the computer to look at the alternative operating system on the USB stick?\n\nA: To boot a Sony VAIO from a USB stick you need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down Windows.\n\n*Insert an Ubuntu LiveUSB\n\n*Turn the laptop on using the \"ASSIST\" button (not the power button).\n\n\n\n*Select boot from external drive.\n\n\nThen follow Ubuntu installation manuals.\n\nA: I'm not familiar with the utility you're using, but my suspicion is that it's creating a disk that lacks an EFI boot loader; or perhaps it includes the EFI boot loader, but something else about the disk's format is preventing your firmware from finding it. Since I'm not familiar with the tool you're using, I can't comment on it, but there are many others you can try, such as UNetbootin, Startup Disk Creator, and Rufus. I recommend you try one or more of them. If the tool gives you options for these details, your best bet is to use GPT (rather than MBR, aka \"msdos\") partitions and a FAT filesystem. If a tool explicitly mentions EFI or UEFI boot support, enable it.\nAlso, in some cases you may need to disable Secure Boot in your firmware.

When you install pip via python-pip, you download from the deprecated Linux server. You should download from the python server. To solve this, do the following:\nsudo apt-get purge pip\nsudo apt-get install python-setuptools\nsudo apt-get install python-dev \nsudo easy_install pip \npip install pip --upgrade \n\n\nA: This is caused by a conflict between a version of pip provided by a system package, like python-pip, and a version provided by PyPI through pip itself.\nTo fix this, simply remove python-pip with sudo apt-get purge python-pip.\nIf you had already used the old version of pip to install a newer version, this should leave the updated version in /usr/local/bin. If not, you can install the most recent version of Pip from scratch with:\nPip for Python 2.7:\ncurl --silent --show-error --retry 5 https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | sudo python2.7\n\nPip for Python 3.x:\ncurl --silent --show-error --retry 5 https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | sudo python3\n\n\nA: Edit:\npip install -U pip\n\nor\npip install --upgrade pip\n\n-U is shorthand for --upgrade.\n\nOld answer:\nThe apt system and PyPI uses two different mechanisms.\nIn Ubuntu's repositories many modules of python are available as packages, but they are not much in numbers as compared to PyPI (The Python Package Index). To remain consistent about upgrading a package you need to consider the method you have used initially used to install it.\nSo if you have installed a package (module) from PyPI using pip then you should used pip to upgrade the package from PyPI (including pip itself). On the other hand if you have used apt system to install a module (as package) you need to use apt to upgrade that again.\nIn a nutshell, run the following to upgrade python-pip to the latest version :\nsudo apt-get install python-pip\n\n\nA: Try install it with easy_install:\neasy_install -U pip\n\n\nA: Actually, you can edit your 'pip' script:\nfrom root:\n$ which pip  # -> prints 'pip' location\n\n$ nano `which pip` # -> open with your editor, note the backticks!\n\nreplace the __requires__ with your latests pip version like:\n__requires__ = 'pip==7.1.2'\n\nthan edit line with 'load_entry_point' call to:\nload_entry_point(__requires__, 'console_scripts', 'pip')()\n\nand:\n$pip -V\npip 7.1.2 from /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (python 2.7)\n\nalso, i have to update my setuptools package, to install some packages.\n\nA: Use this link to upgrade.

It's a pretty basic program coded in Java with a GUI that has three text boxes to enter directory, file name and text you'd like to record. I had been using it on Windows prettily. Now that I've gotten tired of instability of Windows I installed Ubuntu 14.04. \nI tried running the program on Ubuntu. It stated something about giving app permission. I did do that by getting to its properties. I ran my program, but when I entered my text and pressed enter, no file had been created or edited. I had the source code on Pastebin so copied it over to Eclipse to check for compatibility. The directories it seems doesn't work the same way as it is in Windows. Well, removed that part and the app now produces text files as I want it to in the directory it's working on (eg. workspace of Eclipse). It works prettily.\nBut when I export the program into a .jar file and put it in my documentaries, it asks for permission once again. I did give it an execution privilege once again from properties. The program, just as the old version, runs prettily. Except it can't create nor edit .txt files.\nI thought it was a problem about permissions. How could I solve this? \n\nA: So that's why it didn't produce any errors. Remember how I told you that the directories were working differently from Windows? It seems the OS takes Home as the beginning path and not the location where the program is located in. Therefore it created all the files in Home folder. I don't know how to handle the directory issue, yet. But it's good to know the program is actually working.\nThank you, people anyway.\nEdit: Also, it seems it's easy as replacing backslashes with forward ones to optimise the directory checking to Linux.\n", "Q: Use of leading # in password On install I used a password #some1thing# (said it was strong)\nNow it won't let me log in.

I am running windows 8.1 with a VM running XUbuntu.  I am able to secure shell into my work computer (RedHat)through the VM, but when I try to run a Linux based program it becomes frozen or extremely slow and my network usage looks like a roller coaster.  Any ideas for what could cause the slow down?\nThank you\n\nA: When you log into a remote machine and run programs using X forwarding (well, same is true of text programs, but much less bandwidth) it is running the program (the X client) (client/server terms are reversed for X than what you normally think of) on the remote machine, so it is using its CPU,memory, etc.; however, the display (the X server) is on your local machine, so it's streaming all the X display updates across the Internet to your machine.  Now if you think VNC is slow over the Internet...it's fast compared to raw X.  Using ssh compression may help, or it may make things worse, depending on just how slow your Internet connection is.   X just wasn't designed for low-speed high-latency connections, so while it's really cool and handy to be able to do it, performance over anything but a high-speed LAN sucks pond water.\nThe only way seriously improve performance is going to be to use VNC or FreeNX or something instead of raw X.  If you don't have the ability to install VNC,etc. directly on the machine at work, perhaps you can use another machine up there (even a dedicated VM) to host the VNC server; then you can use that machine to do the X-over-SSH connection where it's on a faster network, and you can VNC to that machine instead of the one you really want.\n", "Q: Software RAID disapears after rebooting I'm currently trying to setup a media server and I'm having issues with my software RAID. It seems like once I reboot the server the RAID doesn't get assembled despite there being an entry in the config file.\nWhat I've tried\nI built the RAID using Webmin (mdadm GUI I think is what it's called), put a filesystem on the raid, added the RAID config to /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf and added an entry in the /etc/fstab table. I mounted the RAID and everything seemed ok until I rebooted. Ubuntu would reboot into emergency mode and would only boot correctly once I removed the entry in the fstab file.\nOnce the server is booted with the fstab entry removed I can no longer see the raid (running sudo mdadm --assemble --scan --verbose says it can't find any RAID superblocks on any drives). My best guess is that the RAID isn't assembled and causes Ubuntu to fail to boot because the entry in fstab is incorrect.\nI've tried this twice now with the same results. Any help on getting this to work would be greatly appreciated. Ideally I would like to recover the RAID I setup previously as it takes about 8 hours to initialize a new one.\nSpecs\n\n\n*\n\n*OS: Ubuntu Server 15.04\n\n*OS HDD: Some 250GB HDD\n\n*RAID HDDs: 3x WB 3TB Red\n\n\nmdadm.conf\n# mdadm.conf\n#\n# Please refer to mdadm.conf(5) for information about this file.\n#\n\n# by default (built-in), scan all partitions (/proc/partitions) and all\n# containers for MD superblocks. alternatively, specify devices to scan, using\n# wildcards if desired.\n#DEVICE partitions containers\n\n# auto-create devices with Debian standard permissions\nCREATE owner=root group=disk mode=0660 auto=yes\n\n# automatically tag new arrays as belonging to the local system\nHOMEHOST <system>\n\n# instruct the monitoring daemon where to send mail alerts\nMAILADDR root\n\n# definitions of existing MD arrays\n\n# This file was auto-generated on Fri, 03 Jul 2015 18:56:47 -0600\n# by mkconf $Id$\nARRAY /dev/md0 metadata=1.2 name=EmbyServer:0 UUID=a2a6dfab:c036097c:1f69bef0:63f3f469\n\nfstab\n# /etc/fstab: static file system information.\n#\n# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a\n# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices\n# that works even if disks are added and removed.

Because, every time I load Ubuntu from a live USB, they create small additional partitions (sda1 in screenshot below)!\n\nWhat can I do about it?\n\nA: On simply booting an Ubuntu live session from USB our hard-drives will not be touched. We can only read or write to them after they were mounted to the live Ubuntu system. If Windows was hibernated we should however not try to write to any existing Windows partitions to avoid data loss.\nUnlike with default Windows tools GParted is able to inspect, and also to change all partitions that reside on our hard drives. This also includes all hidden partitions that were not meant to be used like e.g. custom hibernate partitions, recovery partitions, or other system partitions. In case these partitions were not labeled they will just be numbered according to our device naming specifications.\nTherefore it appears that the partition you will only see when booting Ubuntu was created from Windows (note that it is NTFS-formatted), and it is used there for purposes we can not tell for sure. Sometimes mounting such a partition to our live Ubuntu may reveal their file content for further clues on their purpose.\n\nIn summary: don't worry - the Ubuntu live session won't touch your hard drives unless you explicitely tell it to do so.\n\n", "Q: Apache not starting So I tried to start my apache2 server with the following command...\nsudo service apache2 start\n\nBut then I get this error message...\nJob for apache2.service failed.

Look for a menu entry to control output screen size from where you may be able to allow adjusting the screen depending on the HDMI input signal.\nThe menu may be named differently, depending on your brand. For us a menu entry \"Automatically adjust size\" was the one needed for fully displaying the desktop. Sadly this setting may not always survive a power cycle of the TV set, and it may also be affected by other HDMI devices attached (such as a BD-player).\n\nA: Reason was the activated TV picture overscan setting of my TV device.

But still couldn't get the node up.\nCan anyone suggest a method to successfully install nodes in maas for this particular case?\nMy procedure was\nInstall Ubuntu Server 14.04 Mutiple server install with MAAS in my laptop\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install software-properties-common\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo maas createsuperuser // with root\nsudo maas-import-pxe-files\n\nand used\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure maas-region-controller\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure maas-cluster-controller\n\nto setup network if its changed.\n\nA: You need a separate network on which you control the DHCP service.  That service tells clients where to go for PXE boot images.  If you are running virtualBox machines, all on your machine, you can set their nics as being on \"internal network\", and have your server be on that network as well. Then set up your MaaS server as DHCP.  you may have to turn DHCP off in virtualBox, not sure.  See Oracle VM VirtualBox help, section 6.6.\nIf you are using real hardware, you either need to get your IT to build you a network (probably won't do it), or you can buy a switch with a WAN port, and hang all your hardware off it.  The WAN port will protect the university network from your DHCP server, and your clients from their DHCP server.\nYou can either turn the DHCP off on you rswitch, and have MaaS handle DHCP, or you can configure the switch to point PXE requests to the MaaS server.  My experience was that it was simpler to turn DHCP off on the switch and just let MaaS handle everything.\n[edit]\nOnce you set up the Virtual Box internal network, you need to, from the MaaS web gui, select the \"Networks\" tab and add a new network, specifying the IP addresses request.  \nGo to the \"Settings\" tab and scroll down to network settings and make sure they are correct.\nGo to the \"Cluster\" tab and scroll down to \"Interfaces\".  That is where you set up the nic (it should be the virtualBox nic) you are using and whether or not the cluster handles DHCP, what the address and ranges are, etc.\n", "Q: Alias and executable file I have lmp_fedora executable file located in /src.

Is the above correct? and if yes, now I am stuck on what should my new job submit command be for that to happen.\n\nA: Your alias can be called normal alias: it replace command at the beginning of the command line but not in the middle of it. To create global alias you need switch your shell from bash to zsh. See shells comparison for more information.\nIf you still want to work with bash, you probably don't need an alias at all. You need to adjust PATH variable where shell searches for executables. If you do something like \nexport PATH=/home/MyUSERNAME/liggghts/src/:$PATH\n\nyou will be able to run lmp_fedora without any aliases.

I like to know how close I am to finishing these tasks so I tend to keep a tally on a piece of paper. Unfortunately I travel a lot and don't always have a pen or a notebook. This is fine because I just gedit as an alternative, but sometimes I forget to save gedit when I shutdown and lose track of my tally.\nWhat I really want though is a way of setting a shortcut so that each time I complete a task it is logged somewhere and saved instantly. It also needs to be quickly and easily displayed somehow.\n\nA: Maybe you can use emacs with org-mode. It's much more powerful than just simple manage your tasks, but might be worth to dig into. \n\nA: The simplest way of solving that I found was to create a dash script that stores the tally in a text file and displays the value using notify-send.\nI used source to set the location for the values I wanted to keep a tally of: \n#!/bin/sh\n. /home/jesse/.scripts/tally\n\nAnd the tally file just has a single line which reads:\nwritten=0\n\nThen I created functions for showing the tally, clearing the tally and adding to the tally. \nTo show the tally I needed to start by reloading the tally to make sure it is up to date. Then I can use notify-send like this:\nshow() {\n  . /home/jesse/.scripts/tally\n  notify-send -i \"/home/jesse/.scripts/icon.png\" \\\n  \"Total for this week:\" \"Written: $written\"\n}\n\nTo add to the tally the function needs to read from the tally, add 1 to the value, rewrite the tally and then call the show function:\nadd() {\n  num=$(($written + 1))\n  printf \"written=$num\" > /home/jesse/.scripts/tally\n  show\n}\n\nThe clear function is fairly self-explanatory:\nclear() {\n  printf \"written=0\" > /home/jesse/.scripts/tally\n  show\n}\n\nFinally, in order to call the individual functions from the script I needed to finish the script with $@ so that the arguments can be called verbatim. The complete script is:\n#!/bin/sh\n. /home/jesse/.scripts/tally\nshow() {\n  . /home/jesse/.scripts/tally\n  notify-send -i \"/home/jesse/.scripts/icon.png\" \\\n  \"Total for this week:\" \"Written: $written\"\n}\nadd() {\n  num=$(($written + 1))\n  printf \"written=$num\" > /home/jesse/.scripts/tally\n  show\n}\nclear() {\n  printf \"written=0\" > /home/jesse/.scripts/tally\n  show\n}\n$@\n\nFrom there I could assign keyboard shortcuts to call individual functions from the script and manage a good looking tally that is displayed in the notification window just by pressing a couple of buttons.\nHope this helps somebody. This is my first dash script and I'm happy with it, but there's bound to be cleaner ways of achieving this.\n", "Q: How to install Panda3D game engine? I'd like to get started with the Panda3D game engine, but I can't find any tutorials on setting it up on Linux.\nHow can I can set up the engine on Ubuntu 14.04? Or could anyone point me in the right direction?\n\nA: The only build for Trusty is the current unstable build. That might be fine or you could build the development copy from source. This is all extremely documented. Here's how I'd install from the unstable packages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the SDK deb installers and install.\n\n*Optionally do the same for the samples (same link)\n\n*Follow the tutorial to test the samples.\n\n*Continue following the manual to learn more about it.\n\n", "Q: Routing and OpenVPN O have small problem with routing and OpenVPN. After start of VPN connection all traffic goes through my OpenVPN server. But my server is behind ADSL router with 16/2 MBit Download/Upload speed. So i can get access to my internal servers but access to normal Internet is to slow.\nBut I'd like to make like this:\nAs you see access to normal Internet is direct(without OpenVPN) and to my Internal server via OpenVPN.\nHow can i make it?\n\n\n*\n\n*Client laptop: Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04\n\n*OpenVPN server Ubuntu 12.04\n\n\nA: In the OpenVPN client configuration file, remove the redirect-gateway option to stop redirection of all the traffic through the VPN.\nIf the server doesn't automatically push to clients the route to its LAN, you will lose access to your private servers. As a work around you could add the option route <network> <netmask> to your configuration file. For example, if your private servers have IP addresses in the 192.168.0.0/24 network add the following:\nroute 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0\n\nThat would force through the VPN all traffic whose destination is the 192.168.0.0/24 network.\n", "Q: How to remap fn + ESC key to ESC key in Lenovo Yoga 3 I've managed to switch fn keys to behave like function keys in the Lenovo Yoga.  However, this causes the ESC key to be found to Fn + ESC instead.\nIs there a way to switch / remap it back to ESC direct instead?\n\nA: The secondary function of the ESC key on this model triggers a special \"paper\" mode in Windows. This is likely implemented in the machine using an ACPI event sent by the embedded controller, which ends up in the kernel driver and triggers an OS specific action from there.\nI have now found the correct event that is generated and sent a patch for Linux-4.4 at https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/7573501/ that solves it on my Yoga 3 11. To clarify, the event is actually done through WMI GUID \"26CAB2E5-5CF1-46AE-AAC3-4A12B6BA50E6\" rather than the embedded controller, which is why the ideapad-laptop driver could not handle it already.\n", "Q: Installing Sophos Anti-Virus Hi i'm new to Ubuntu and linux and need some help, im trying to install Sophos Anti-Virus and im running in to trouble.

I have a laptop with Ubuntu installed on it and some other private software and files. I want to make a complete image of the current state of my system and than make backups on daily basis of my work. What is the best tool to accomplish this?\nI've found some tools like partclone (from CloneZilla), dd or rsync. But those tools either create a one time image or backup certain directories (like a photo directory). Using partclone, I have to recreate a complete image of my system, which is time consuming, but it's also not efficient as I'd like to update an image by the difference between the current state and previous image.\nIf my laptop's HDD is broken or I messed up something severely using root, I want to be able to restore everything (projects, updates and so on...) up to yesterday.\nDoes an all-in-one solution exist? If not, which tool is suitable to create a backup of the entire system?\n\nA: What I did was: split up the system between / and home.  That way I can just clone my system using partclone from CloneZilla in 20 minutes flat over USB 2.0 and use backintime do do incremental backups of /home.\nThe next thing I'm going to try is timeshift which looks like it has everything you need...  (But: I haven't even tried that one for back-ups, let alone restores whereas the above has been tested!)\nHaving said all the above: I like people backing up but this question is really a request for a software recommendation which is better served on Software Recommendations, a sister site to Ask Ubuntu...\n\nA: You should start by reading BackupYourSystem wiki. Incremental backup (to an FTP server, perhaps) using Duplicity should be an ideal way for you I guess. \nDuplicity backs up directories by producing encrypted tar-format volumes and uploading them to a remote or local site. It uses librsync to record incremental changes to files; gzip to compress them; and gpg to encrypt them.\nThe Duplicity wiki has excellent tutorial starting from basic function to advanced functions like automating backups\nYou'll also find an excellent read in How to back up my entire system? \n", "Q: What is the cause for apt-get failing with returncode 137?

This may have some useful ideas or tips to debug this issue of yours.\nSee: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/PowerManagement/IdentifyingIssues\ntop is a useful tool to see the top CPU consumers, however it cannot easily spot short lived processes or threads that get created and die very quickly. For these kind of CPU sucking processes, I developed forkstat to try and track these down. It is available in recent releases of Ubuntu, or you can download it from ppa:colin-king/white  (see http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~cking/forkstat/)\n\nA: I had this issue recently. I discovered this was caused by an SD Adapter for microSD. When I insert a 32GB SDHC U1 Samsung microSD with two partitions (one 8GB vfat and one 24GB ext2) Lubuntu fails to detect and mount the device. In top/lxtask I do not see any processes using cpu however my cpu usage is a steady 100%. The cpu goes down to 0% when the card is removed.\n", "Q: After getting a deleted partition with Testdisk software, can I recover it on the unallocated space of the deleted partition without any problem? I have Ubuntu and Windows 7 on my PC. My linux partition was accedentaly deleted. So, I'm trying to recover deleted partition with Testdisk, and I'm using Ubuntu Live CD since my Linux  partition is deleted. I have found my files with the software, but where should I recover them. Can I recover them on the deleted partition(the unallocated space which was linux previously) without any problem of overwriting and permanent data loss?\n\nA: Yes, it will just restore the partition record. No data from the Windows partition will be lost, the Linux data won't be touched too.\nEDIT: After deleting and recovering partitions from an old drive, here's the result (F:, shared, has music in it, restored and G: made by mistake before deleting F:)\n\n\nA: No, unfortunately we can't store recovered files on the same partition of a drive. As soon as we start writing on that partition all file-remnants that still reside there will be overwritten with the new data, hence making them irreversibly unrecoverable.\nIn case there is another partition different to the space we want to recover we may successfully harvest our files to there, but still we can not restore the partition table, as this affects the whole drive's partitioning.\nTo be on the safe side it is recommended to harvest recovered files on another, possibly external drive.\n", "Q: having problem installing libmysqlc++-dev aanchal@aanchal-Inspiron-3542:~$ sudo apt-get install libmysqlc++-dev\nReading package lists...

Is there an application I can use to fix the bad block? Or a few lines of code? But it gives me errors for everything I try try to do.\n\nA: \nIs there an application i can use to fix the bad blocks?\n\nNo. The drive already does this on its own.  It will detect broken of failing sectors and remaps them until it runs out of spare sectors to remap them to.  \nLong before that happens you should ditch the HDD (keep the rest of the laptop. Optionally install a cheap second hand drive or even an SSD).\n\n\nTechnically: you could boot from USB pendrives or CD or the network and see if the failed sectors are all clustered around a single spot. Then partition around it. But if the drive already has run out of spares then it is very likely to die soon. Best not try work around that unless you have very good (daily?) backups and do not care abouyt replacing the drive when (when, not if) it completely dies.\n", "Q: Making and deleting deb files in sources.list.d dir.

I ran the server for a bit, and it installed it's own Grub on the system.  Ubuntu is not an option on the bootloader, so to get back to Ubuntu I tried taking out the new drive, but after the Dell screen it goes directly into Grub rescue mode.  I followed some other advice and reinstalled the hard drive and used 'sudo apt-get purge grub-PC' from the Turnkey CLI, and after doing that, I am sent straight to Grub rescue mode without a chance to boot to Turnkey.  Is it possible that the issue is that Grub was installed on a different hard drive than Ubuntu?  Another thing is that I purged grub, grub-legacy, and grub-PC (only grub-PC worked), but here it is messing with my boot.  And yes, when installing Turnkey, I was careful not to wipe Ubuntu.\n\nA: On a BIOS-based computer (which your 10-year-old system almost certainly is), a boot loader installs to the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the hard disk -- that is, its first sector. Note the singular: boot loader. Whatever boot loader resides in the MBR controls the boot process.\nThis can become more complex if you've got multiple disks, since each disk has its own MBR. In theory, you can install one boot loader in one disk's MBR and another boot loader in the other one and then use the BIOS's built-in boot manager to switch between them. In practice, though, setting things up in this way requires either knowledge of how to do it or luck. My suspicion is that your Turnkey Linux version of GRUB has overwritten the Ubuntu version of GRUB on your first hard disk, leaving the second disk untouched.\nThere are at least two reasonably painless solutions to this problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Prepare a Super GRUB 2 Disk and boot from it. With luck, this will give you a menu enabling you to boot either Ubuntu or Turnkey. Boot to Ubuntu, open a Terminal Window, and type sudo grub-install /dev/sda followed by sudo update-grub.\n\n*Run the Boot Repair tool from any emergency disk you can get booted. (An Ubuntu installation utility should work.) This will re-install GRUB and set it up.\n\n\nIdeally, either method will detect both your Ubuntu and your Turnkey installations and get them both booting. In practice, it's possible that one will work and the other won't; or maybe even neither will work. You'll just have to try one and, if it doesn't work, try the other. In a worst-case scenario you might need to dig into the \"guts\" of GRUB, which is not pretty; but try these easier fixes first. Try them in whatever order you like, and if one works, do not try the other one, on the \"if it ain't broken, don't fix it\" principle.\n\nA: You may use Boot-Repair CD to restore your Ubuntu GRUB.\n", "Q: How do I uninstall airtel 4g dongle I installed 4g dongle on Ubuntu 14.04 ... but somehow the airtel program is not working.  I would like to uninstall it, but I couldn't find the program in the Software Center.\n\nA: To my knowledge, there isn't a program through which to configure the 4G dongle.\nTo enable/disable Airtel 4G dongle\nPaste the following into a .html file:\n<form action = \"http://192.168.0.1/goform/goform_set_cmd_process\" method = \"post\">\n <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"goformId\" value=\"CONNECT_NETWORK\" checked style=\"display:none;\">\n <BUTTON name=\"submit\" type=\"submit\"> Connect </BUTTON>\n</form>\n\n<form action = \"http://192.168.0.1/goform/goform_set_cmd_process\" method = \"post\">\n <input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"goformId\" value=\"DISCONNECT_NETWORK\" checked style=\"display:none;\">\n <BUTTON name=\"submit\" type=\"submit\"> Disconnect </BUTTON>\n</form>\n\nSave the file and open it with your preferred browser.\nClick the Connect or Disconnect buttons to enable or disable the dongle.\n", "Q: Could you install Ubuntu on an external hdd and run it on a Samsung smart TV? I've got a Samsung Smart TV 4 series 32\", and since the smart hub is pretty much useless, I wanted to know if there was a way to run Ubuntu from an external HDD on it.\n\nA: No, but you could use the Ubuntu-Powered Intel Compute Stick. It's processor, memory, SD slot and USB port that plugs into the HDMI input of anything that has an HDMI input.\nIf it proves to be useful, I'm sure it will only be the first available.\n\nA: I looked up the technical specifications of the TV and except that it has a \"dual core\" processor there are no technical specifications on the processor architecture, and as it doesn't even allow Ubuntu to upgrade its firmware, I would say:\n\"No, you cannot\"\nSorry to be the harbinger of bad news …\n", "Q: How to reset Ubuntu to default settings? I purchased a laptop with Ubuntu downloaded on it.

But my wifi has been showing either very weak signal at times or none at all. I tried multiple solutions available on internet but nothing seems to work. Also i hosted connectify on another laptop and started using internet through that it worked for two days but it is also not connecting (probably due to trying some solution from old posts).\n\nA: You need to install the driver using dkms. If you build it from the lwfinger git, it stops working after kernel upgrades.\nI packed the same driver as DKMS and added it to a ppa. Install it this way:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:hanipouspilot/rtlwifi\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install rtlwifi-new-dkms linux-firmware\n\nand reboot.\n\nA: Quite often, the weak signal is a symptom of the antenna wire being connected to connection #1 on the card when the default driver is expecting to see the signal at connection #2. Of course, you could open the laptop and switch the wire or you could install a newer driver that permits antenna selection at the driver level.\nPlease obtain a temporary ethernet connection by ethernet, tethered or whatever means possible. Open a terminal and do:\nwget https://github.com/lwfinger/rtlwifi_new/archive/rock.new_btcoex.zip\nunzip rock.new_btcoex.zip\ncd rtlwifi_new-rock.new_btcoex\nmake\nsudo -i\nmake install\necho \"options rtl8723be ant_sel=2\"  >  /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8723be.conf\nexit\n\nReboot.\nWhenever Update Manager installs a later kernel version, also known as linux-image, after the requested restart, you must recompile:\ncd rtlwifi_new-rock.new_btcoex\nmake clean\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nReboot and your wireless should be working.\n\nA: Upgrade your Linux Firmware to 1.161 and Kernel version to 4.8.\nTo update the Linux Firmware , there are two ways :-\n    1.

All of them are Ubuntu (or a derivative) with the exception of one mac. The mac isn't as important as the rest, so I could take an option that doesn't require it.  A friend said that Samba wouldn't be the best option for security and what not but didn't offer any other options. What is the best options?\n\nA: For sharing printers best solution, for me, is to user cups. Also you can user cups on mac. \nFor file sharing you can use Samba. You have lot of a resource here, and here, or here\nMaybe you can use NFS.

They have two awk \nawk -F: '($3 >=1000) {printf \"%s:%s\",$1,$3}' /etc/passwd\n\nA: I find the easiest way is to have webmin on your server and simply go to System > Users and Groups and there you have a nicely formatted list with all usernames & groups with their uid's, home directory etc.\n", "Q: Trouble Pairing Bluetooth Sound Bar with 14.04 LTS I am currently having issues pairing a Yamaha YAS-103 sound bar with my system.

Then try editing the file with gedit (launch via this terminal session ofcourse) again.\n\n*If this does not work, it's simply not a permission problem (afaik) - the file is read-only. Part of the unix-philosophy is \"everything is a file\". Even devices, even not really \"existing\" stuff.\nIt does not always make sense to have something writable.

Thanks.\n\nA: I have the same problem with my Dell laptop version of the broadcom wireless adapter. After a few hours searching and trying various stuff (including destroying my wlan driver so I had no wifi at all :) I found out that the wl kernel driver does not support wifi channels above 11 (!). The b43 driver was no option for me since it does not support by my hardware device (trying this \"wrecked\" my wifi and I had to re-install the broadcom driver).\nThe workaround I did was to log in to my wireless router and tell it to use a channel from the range 1-11 (e.g. channel 7) and voila, I could now see my SSID in Network Manager applet again!\nOf course, to do this you need to have access to the wifi router configuration, i.e. this may not be applicable to public places (coffe shops, airports, workplaces,...). If you can't access the wifi router, then you just have to wait until it uses channel from range 1-11 again...\n", "Q: Windows 8.1 / Ubuntu 14.04 dual boot: grub does not appear First time installing Ubuntu. I have followed the instructions here, with the difference that:\n\n\n*\n\n*I had already used Windows to create 3 partitions for Ubuntu.\n\n*This line in step 7 did not work: sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair so I ran a different pair of commands (possibly sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update then sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair) which did work.\n\n\nHere's the output:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/11833014/\nAfter rebooting into Windows 8.1, I ran the command...\nbcdedit /set \"{bootmgr}\" path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\n... using the admin command prompt, and was told that it succeeded. However, when I reboot into Ubuntu using my Live USB stick, I see that there is a volume called SONYSYS with total capacity of 268.4 MB, which contains this file \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi but no file called grubx64.efi (but perhaps I am looking in the wrong place). This volume also contains folders named BOOT and WINDOWS.\nCan you recommend solutions that I can try?\nNote: Windows 8 Fast Startup is switched off, is is Secure Boot. Changing the  admin propmt command to bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi, as suggested here did not solve the problem.\n\nA: First, a partition called SONYSYS suggests you've got a Sony. Unfortunately, many Sonys are known to have flaky EFIs, so you may be in for a fight. If the computer is new enough and you get even remotely frustrated by this, I STRONGLY urge you to return the computer to the store for a refund, then write to Sony to tell them you returned the machine because it was defective, with details. Manufacturers will continue to sell junk until they feel the pain (in the form of the costs of returned machines) of doing so. Unfortunately, far too many people roll over and jump through ridiculous hoops to avoid returning defective merchandise.\nSecond, it appears that your /dev/sda3 is your EFI System Partition (ESP), but your computer also has an ESP-like partition on /dev/sda1. It's unclear which of those two partitions holds the boot loader that actually boots Windows, but it looks like Ubuntu installed GRUB to /dev/sda3. I don't know enough about bcdedit to know whether it would modify the boot configuration to point to files on /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda3 in your case, so it's possible that this is the problem. You could work around this by mounting both partitions and copying the EFI/ubuntu directory from /dev/sda3 to /dev/sda1, then booting back to Windows and trying with bcdedit again.\nAnother option, if you haven't invested too much time in configuring Windows, is to re-install a stock version of Windows, rather than the Sony-customized version that's probably to blame for the sda1/sda3 shenanigans, and perhaps other idiosyncracies. Fortunately, you can download Windows media legally, as described here, among other places. This re-installation might simplify and regularize things enough to help cut through the problems.\nIf all of this fails, the easiest remaining option (other than returning the computer) is to engage in some ugly hacks that involve renaming the Windows boot loader and copying GRUB (or some other Linux-ready boot loader) in its place. The Boot Repair tool can do this. The option is on the Advanced menu and refers to backing up and renaming EFI boot files.

I decided for the pin: just 4 numbers - very easy for me to remember. \nWhile I used my phone for the first time it was very warm and then I wanted to unlock the screen again and now it doesn´t accept the pin any more.\nI was trying to do a factory reset but I just could choose it. Since then it's been stuck. The normal boot mode works well and my SIM´s pin is accepted.\nBut now I´m logged out of the phone itself!\nHow can I solve this problem?\n\nA: According to the Manual of the phone on page 18 you have to press the Power and Home buttons simultaneously, \n\nthen go to Settings→User data→Factory reset and check the Clear Data Simultaneously check box during the eventual firmware update.\nAnd that should clear all settings.  If that doesn't solve your problem, press the Power and Home buttons simultaneously for 10 seconds and that should then completely reset your phone.\nIf that still doesn't solve the problem, you probably have a DOA (\"Dead On Arrival\") and should return it to the store for a swap.

I am trying to open up a .exe file in wine but when I type in the code it says the archive is corrupted (side note: Yes, I did delete the file and redownload it, that was my first reaction). I typed in the code just like the help Ubuntu website said. I did the wine configuration, then cded into my desktop where my file was. But, when I typed wine xsplit.exe it came up with an error saying this archive is corrupted.\n\nA: The problem you are probably having is that Ubuntu is trying to open the exe with the Archive Manager instead of with Wine. To fix this, just find the file in the file manager, right click on it, go to \"Properties\", click on the \"Open with\" tab, click on \"Wine Windows Program Loader\" and click on \"Set as default\". The exe files should now open with Wine when you double click on it.\n", "Q: Steam downloads always stop Whenever I try to download a game with Steam on Ubuntu 15.04, the download speed will go from 600kb/s-2mb/s to -1kb/s. I've noticed it's usually once the download hits the 30-40mb mark. For example, I was comfortably downloading Toribash with a peak speed of around 900kb/s, and it slowed down to about 600 bytes per second once it hit 35mb. This is incredibly annoying because I've made the change from Windows to Ubuntu on all of my home computers and this is the only program that's giving me grief.\nI saw a response on another post that said \n\n\"This happens on Windows too. Its from the steam servers being flooded\n  by downloading the same thing. Its not an Ubuntu bug. Try changing the\n  location settings and check if they are right and just be patient.\"\n  Now, while this does make sense to most people, it just doesn't seem right in my case. My location settings are exactly the same as they were in Windows, and I've tried downloading multiple games and the same thing happens. If someone could help me solve this, I'd be very grateful. Cheers.\n\n\nA: This does seem to affect Steam on both Windows and Linux, the best way I've found to stop it from happening is to pause the download when the problem starts, then wait 10-15 seconds, then unpause the download and repeat when it happens again.\n", "Q: How to make taskbar panel showing in Firefox at FullScreen? To use full-screen in FF most of the time by hitting F11 is very usefull especially for a multi-tasking user who uses every single inch of his screen and don't want to get out of this full screen mode just to access the Xfce panel or taskbar.\nIs there anyway to have both full screen for FF and a visible or auto hide taskbar panel simultaneously?\nP.S. I'm using the latest Ubuntu 14.04 X64, Xfce Desktop and latest official FF (v38)\nEdit:\nI already tried other suggestions for others OSes, also Lock panel and auto show/hide panel options without effect, the nearest solution was the xfce4-popup-applicationsmenu keyboard shortcut but it still doesn't show the panel.\n\n\nA: While it is said to be impossible to navigate Xfce panel, the default behaviour to cycle windows in Xfce can already show the taskbar while running an application at fullscreen.\nDefault behaviour: My own experience is quoted as follows.\n\nSimply invoke Alt+Tab and switch to other application window. The Xfce panel will automatically get focused and will remain on top of already-fullscreen Firefox.\n\nThat will work even without window button or window menu applet, as long as user switch to other non-fullscreen application window.\nAlternative method: Use Xfce desktop manager command with the following option.\n-W, --windowlist\n       Causes an already-running instance of xfdesktop to pop up the\n       window list menu at the current position of the mouse cursor.\n\nGo to Settings > Keyboard > Application Shortcuts and click Add to include this command xfdesktop --windowlist to the shortcut list with keyboard shortcut of your choice. Then invoke the shortcut and you have a small popup, showing the list of window at any visible area.\nThe alternative method will not show the Xfce panel, but allows you to switch to other windows without using the popup dialog to cycle windows.\nEither way would be useful enough to do multitasking in Xfce.\n\nA: Use \"undecorate\" instead. Fullscreen mode means reducing the window's titlebar by merging it into the tab bar, and to remove the window manager panel. (At least in my Firefox version, tab bar and address bar keep displaying in fullscreen mode.) So what you want is just the first part, removing the window title bar. You can achieve this without messing with fullscreen settings, by simply removing window decorations from Firefox.\nAdvantages and disadvantages. With this solution, window titlebar buttons will not be present, unlike in \"real\" fullscreen mode, but you can get them back by re-decorating the window. The advantage is, you keep your fullscreen mode unchanged for use when doing presentations etc..\nAdding a keybinding. Xfce will have a way to trigger toggling window decorations with a keybinding. I use F12 for this, remembering it as a \"special\" mode for fullscreen-like behavior, one after Firefox's F11 keybinding for normal fullscreen mode.\n", "Q: Alias syntax for mpirun I execute my jobs in terminal using:\nmpirun -np 4 lmp_fedora < in.stdinfile\n\nNow I want to create a permanent alias run so that I can just input the command:\nrun < in.stdinfile \n\nfrom any directory in the terminal to execute my jobs. What is the syntax for the alias or the environment variable?\n\nA: In this case the alias would be:\nalias run='mpirun -np 4 lmp_fedora'\n\nThe canonical way to add an user-defined local alias is to put it into ~/.bashrc; you can directly add it to ~/.bashrc using this command, which will append it to the end of the file:\necho \"alias run='mpirun -np 4 lmp_fedora'\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\nThen you can run source ~/.bashrc to apply the changes in your current bash instance:\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\n", "Q: Build Cling using CMake fails I am trying build Cling (LLVM-based C++ interpreter) on my machine using CMake.

Before possibly judging my question, here is my motive. I am a 13 year old teen from the Philippines. I am a Linux Enthusiast (although I still use Windows on my desktop for gaming). I wanted to make some extra money for savings and emergency money. One way I thought of doing that was by burning CD/DVDs of Ubuntu and selling it to people.

Furthermore, it would be a matter of ethics to sell something that is free (and more than free) in a first place.\nNevertheless, you can ask for the compensation of the service of writing the CD (practically selling the service). That would mean: You can offer to sell the CD by the price no less than a CD itself, but even better - for the price that is offered to you. Let the buyer determine the price. Besides that, you should emphasize they could download it online for free. That would be the path to spread the word of Ubuntu and to comprehend the meaning of the word \"ubuntu\" as well. Though I have no doubt for the latter because you already showed a great amount of ethics (not just for 13-year old) by asking this question in a first place.\n\n", "Q: NTLDR is missing while installing Ubunttu I downloaded ubuntu-14.04.2-desktop-i386 and I burned it on a USB drive.

Is this solvable through easy scripting, or through something far more involved?\nFor those interested, my laptop is an HP Pavilion dv6t.\n\nA: No. \nxorg.conf is just a plain text file that is parsed (ie. the lines in it are read by a script and the script sets all the parameters, options and what else is valid in xorg.conf) so no, you can not use conditions. That line you want included would just be ignored or it would error out since the xorg subsystem does not understand it. \nYou could do this with a udev rule (Writing udev rules and How do I make udev rules work? will get you started). \n", "Q: Network Interface Traffic Visualizer I have multiple interfaces active at a time, I want to visualize the bandwidth in/out from the interfaces on my PC.

Unlike many popular programming languages, the popular Oracle Java package is only available using a PPA, not by the official repo.\nWhy isn't Oracle Java included in the standard Ubuntu repo?\n\nA: Ubuntu has OpenJDK in its repository. It's the fully open-sourced version of the Oracle JDK, which contains some closed-source parts. \nIt is a myth that OpenJDK is lower and less stable, but this was the past.\nToday (since version 7), they're pretty equal. OpenJDK is even the reference implementation for Java 7 and Java 8. It's a race between those two implementations, as some new features appear first in OpenJDK and then later get included to OracleJDK, while some features get included the other way round.\nThe major differences are that OpenJDK has no Webstart included (but the open-source IcedTea does this job) and some other closed-source tools of Oracle missing, but nothing important.\nSo to sum up: As Ubuntu supports everything that is open-source, it supports OpenJDK, especially as it has no real disadvantages any more.\n\nA: I think it's caused by licence:\n\n\n*\n\n*OpenJDK is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GNU\nGPL) \n\n*Oracle JDK is licensed under 'Sun License'\n\n\nTo be honest, I would prefer to have Oracle Java in Ubuntu/Ubuntu-based since (unfortunately) some applications still demand it.\n", "Q: How to update jdk 7?

This is the link gived to me by Boot-Repair: http://paste.ubuntu.com/11835577/\nI can't enter to my ubuntu, When I try it it puts this: Minimal BASH-like line editing is supported.\nThese is my history: I had 2 partitions with 2 Ubuntu because in 1 (the first I create) I remove the EFI partition, to fix it I recreate them (obviously with a different UUID). I didn't know that the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file need to have the correct EFI partition's UUID, so when I find out these I edit the file and correct it, but a update which was being carried out was interrupted by the editing of the file. Since then I was trying to repair it.\nSorry for my bad English, it isn't my native language.\n\nA: First, the log file indicates that Boot Repair has completed, but your question alludes to manually editing /boot/grub/grub.cfg, and it's not clear if you did this before or after running Boot Repair. If after, please run Boot Repair again but do not edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg manually.\nIf the system is dropping to a grub> prompt as you describe after you run Boot Repair, then that tool is obviously not up for the job. Your Boot Repair seems reasonable, although it's not showing a grub.cfg file on your hard disk, which it normally does. Thus, you may want to try a different approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Secure Boot in your firmware, if it's currently enabled.\n\n*Download the CD-R or USB flash drive version of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Prepare a boot medium from the files you download.\n\n*Boot the rEFInd boot medium. It should show you at least one option to boot Ubuntu.\n\n*Try the Ubuntu option(s) in rEFInd. If one fails and there's more than one, try the other(s).\n\n*If you can get into Ubuntu from rEFInd, you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can install the Debian package or PPA of rEFInd, which will then take over you boot manager duties and get you booting without GRUB.\n\n*You can attempt to re-install and repair GRUB from your working Ubuntu installation. Given that Boot Repair has already failed at this task, I'm not sure what to suggest, except perhaps sudo grub-install followed by sudo update-grub.\n\n\n*If desired, you can re-enable Secure Boot at this point.\n\n\nThe point of this procedure is simply that rEFInd is not GRUB, and therefore whatever is going wrong with GRUB will not affect rEFInd -- at least, not if the problem is GRUB-specific. It's conceivable that there's something more wrong with your installation. For instance, if you no longer have Linux kernels in /boot, you'll have to re-install your kernel packages using an emergency system.\n", "Q: systemd: How to modify the HandlePowerKey action with a custom command?

I noticed this morning that Conky is now reporting that my CPU is running around max all the time now. \nBefore installing this kernel update, my idle would be .8GHz. Now I'm lucky if I see anything below 1.4GHz. Needless to say, this is having a severe negative impact on battery life. I have the latest version of TLP installed, but it doesn't seem to be working as effectively. \nF.Y.I., my CPU is an i3 3217U.\n\nA: When checking what my previous version was, I noticed I had several kernel versions. So I went to clear them out. I was a little overzealous, and accidentally deleted ALL of them. Once I broke my install to where it wouldn't boot, I started up the live USB and reinstalled 3.16.0-43 generic and 3.16.0-41, but missed the timing to get into grub. So I booted into 43. Now it works like a charm, which is weird because I had rebooted a couple of times, and nothing had worked. It seems to be working fine now.\n", "Q: 7zip: How to exclude file types? I want to exclude the following file types:\n\n\n*\n\n*epub \n\n*pdf\n\n*html (upper case too)\n\n*azw3\n\n*mobi\n\n*opf\n\n*txt\n\n\nI have this so far which doesn't seem to work, i get an error saying \"Incorrect Command Line\".\n7z e \"-x!*.epub\" \"-x!*.pdf\" \"-x!*.html\" \"-x!*.azw3\" \"-x!*.mobi\" \"-x!*.txt\" \"-x!*.HTML\" \"-x!*.opf\" *\n\nI also tried the above command without double quotes.\nI created the above command using info from here (for windows) but it doesn't seem to work under Linux.\n\nA: From man 7z:\n-x[r[-|0]]]{@listfile|!wildcard}\n              Exclude filenames\n\nTo exclude files (or types) you can use the following command:\n7z a -xr@exclude.txt backup.7z /whatever/dirs/or/files\n\nNotice the use of -xr instead of -x. The r indicates recursive so it can match excluded files in deep folder hierarchies\nThe exclude.txt file is a list of files or file types, separated by carriage returns, like this:\n*.epub\n*.pdf\n*.html \n*.HTML\n*.azw3\n*.mobi\n*.opf\n*.txt\n\n\nA: 7z only accepts a single archive within its arguments, but you're passing a wildcard, which expands to the full content of the current working directory. Another issue is that the wildcards within the arguments will expand as well, either if non-quoted or double-quoted.\nSo you should only extract a single archive per command. You should remove the wildcard at the end, specify a single archive and single-quote the arguments:\n7z e '-x!*.epub' '-x!*.pdf' '-x!*.html' '-x!*.azw3' '-x!*.mobi' '-x!*.txt' '-x!*.HTML' '-x!*.opf' archive.7z\n\nTo extract multiple archives at once, however, you can use multiple methods:\n\n*\n\n*bash:\nfor archive in *.7z; do 7z e '-x!*.epub' '-x!*.pdf' '-x!*.html' '-x!*.azw3' '-x!*.mobi' '-x!*.txt' '-x!*.HTML' '-x!*.opf' \"$archive\"; done\n\n\n\n*find:\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type f -iname \"*.7z\" -exec 7z e '-x!*.epub' '-x!*.pdf' '-x!*.html' '-x!*.azw3' '-x!*.mobi' '-x!*.txt' '-x!*.HTML' '-x!*.opf' {} \\;\n\n\nA: Maybe extracting from multiple archives wasn't possible at the time of the question.\nAs of 2020, 7z can extract from multiple archives , but you need to specify them with a special flag:\n       -ai[r[-|0]]{@listfile|!wildcard}\n              Include archives\n\ndocs\nNote that when you use this you no longer need to specify the archive_name on the command line (where you passed *), so you need to disable it with the -an flag.\nThe rest of your flags work as you put them, with the exception of the quotes: they are necessary to avoid interpretation of ! and * by your shell. In bash, double quotes (\"..\") still allow expansions, so need to use single quotes ('...'). The alternative is to escape these characters, e.g. -x\\!\\*.html.\nSo your command becomes:\n7z e -an '-ai!*' '-x!*.epub' '-x!*.pdf' '-x!*.html' '-x!*.azw3' '-x!*.mobi' '-x!*.txt' '-x!*.HTML' '-x!*.opf'\n\n\nMy recommendation is to make the inclusion flag a bit more specific than *, because it will select all the files in the directory. And since you used the e command (not x) and you did not specify an output directory (with -o flag), the current directory will be populated with all the files from your archive. This means that if you run the same command again, the * selector will now select not only the archives, but also all the extracted files.\n\nA: If you want to exclude the full directory (you may have this extension file separated in directory)\n 7z a -t7z -m0=lzma -mx=9 -mfb=64 -md=32m -ms=on ~/bkpFile_$(date +\"%d_%b_%Y\").1.7z /home/ubuntu/projectfile -mx0 '-xr!vendor' '-xr!view' '-xr!documents' \n\nHere, vendor , view, and documents directory has been excluded.\n", "Q: Installing 14.04.2 on a Acer Aspire 4520 A real newbie here - beginning level on Linux, total newbie on Ubuntu and to this forum. 1st post, hoping someone can help. \nI was asked by a friend to upgrade 4 older notebooks from Windows, for use in an office environment. I asked around and everyone recommended Ubuntu Desktop. I downloaded both the 32 bit and 64 bit packages and put them on bootable USB sticks with Rufus. Three of the installs (I went whole hog and reformatted the drives) went perfectly. The Acer Aspire 4520 however, is proving to be a challenge. \nThe issue is the video card. When the screen comes up in the graphical environment, it displays with lots of horizontal overscans - such that I see three or four of everything on the screen. The 4520 has a NVIDIA GeForce 7000M graphics chipset. I tried the various command line options in the run from USB test process, but none of them resolve the problem. \nI believe I may have to include some sort of fine tuning to load the correct graphics driver for the NVIDIA chip, but I have no idea how to do that.

Also I'd want to keep the OS and apps up to date, but how? \nSo I purchased a machine pre-installed with Ubuntu Desktop 15.04 and I want to enable it to separately run (dual boot?) (Ubuntu Desktop 15.04) from an external encrypted hard drive, as a way to achieve my goal of an isolated system.   \nMore or less, I think it would look like this: \nI'd unplug my wireless adapter, restart the machine, be asked if I want to boot from the external (eSATA?) drive (attached for this purpose only, otherwise not attached) and be prompted for the encryption password (separate from the Ubuntu password) which would mount the encrypted file to access the (Ubuntu Desktop 15.04) operating system files, run those files and I'd be greeted with the request for my Ubuntu password for this isolated system. \n\nA: The easy way of doing this is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*remove the existing boot drive from your machine\n\n*remove the the external drive from its enclosure and insert it into your machine\n\n*Boot a LiveDVD\n\n*install it as you want\n\n*move the freshly installed HDD to the external enclosure.\n\n\nThen when you want to boot that, just go into your BIOS and boot from the external HDD.\nTo keep the system updated, you need to follow this official documentation\n\nThe more complex solution would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hook up all drives\n\n*remove UEFI and convert to BIOS boot.\n\n*Boot a LiveDVD\n\n*Install Ubuntu\n\n*take \"something else\"\n\n*Take care to put the boot manager (grub) on the external hard drive together with its system files\n\n*Install everything you want\n\n*shut down the machine\n\n*remove the external drive\n\n\nThe result is the same: externally bootable HDD that needs off-line updates.\n", "Q: Bash completion for commands that start with specified letter?

Assign one with sudo ifconfig 1.2.3.4 netmask 255.255.255.0 or use dhclient -d [iface] if you have a DHCP server in your network (if your uncertain try it, it doesn't hurt and is easier if it works).\n\nA: If you're connected to the network through a wireless NIC, ifconfig eth0 is useless, because it will show the output of ifconfig for the first ethernet NIC (if any):\nifconfig wlan0\n\nOr wlan1, wlan2, wlan3, [...] depending on how the NIC in use has been mapped (in case you have multiple wireless NICs).\nTo display only the IP address:\nifconfig wlan0 | sed -n '2s/[^:]*:\\([^ ]*\\).*/\\1/p'\n\n\nA: Personally I use nmcli dev show (15.04) or nmcli dev list (14.04 and earlier).

When the computer reboots, GRUB2 does not appear: the computer launches directly into Windows 8.1.\nYou can find boot-repair log here:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/11836136/\nThis shows that there are 2 volumes which have an /EFI/ubuntu directory: sda1 and sda3. (If I understand correctly, sdb1 is my Live USB stick so it is not relevant here). It also promises that there are two files - /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi and /EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi in the sda3 volume, but on inspection from within Ubuntu (booting from a Live USB) I cannot find the /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi file (annotated screenshot).\nI would like to discover which of these two volumes is being used on start-up, so that I can set the correct path for the bootmanager.\nI have started following the instructions on Gary Newell's Fix the UEFI Bootloader page, but it seems to be failing at the command mountvol g: /s. Here's the output of my session in the Administrator Command Prompt:\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32> mountvol g: /s\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32>wmic logicaldisk get caption\nCaption\nC:\nG: \nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32>cd g:\\\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32>cd g:\\EFI\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32>\n\nThis indicates that a volume named G: has been mounted, but it is impossible to move to it or to any directories in it. It would appear that the mountvol /s is only doing part of what is expected.\nI understand that this is supposed to \"mount the EFI System Partition on the specified drive\", but that it works \"for Itanium-based computers only\" source\nWhen I run the set command in the Command Prompt, it tells me that PROCESSOR_IDENTIFIER=Intel64 Family 6 Model 58 Stepping 9, GenuineIntel. I see no sign of Itanium there (but perhaps I'm not looking for the right data).\nIs there a different command that I can use to mount the EFI System Partition on this computer? Or is there a different technique that I can use to ensure that the bootmanager reads the right file and launches Grub?\n\nA: The reference to Itanium-based computers is outdated. The first computers to use EFIs were Itaniums, but EFI/UEFI has been used in AMD64/x86-64 computers for several years now. (They became common on new computers in mid-2011. Just about everything to ship with Windows 8 and later uses UEFI.) I'm sure that page, or at least that Itanium comment, dates from the period when only Itanium-based machines used EFIs.\nNote that when you mount the ESP via the mountvol command in an Administrator Command Prompt window, the ESP is really only accessible in that same window; you can't get to it via your normal GUI file manager. It's not clear from your question whether you're having problems in the Administrator Command Prompt window or elsewhere. If it's in the Administrator Command Prompt window, then my suspicion is that the filesystem is damaged.\n", "Q: compiz config settings manager how to operate an enable does anyone know of any links that i could refference so as to learn how to use COMPIZ more effectively as far as the features go an how to enable an operate them ??  \n\nA: Probably the best resource would be: \nhttp://wiki.compiz.org/ (index with links)\nIt can be taken as official documentation...\nSome links from the site you might find useful.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://wiki.compiz.org/CompizPlugins\n\n*http://wiki.compiz.org/CompizFusionPlugins\n\n*http://wiki.compiz.org/GeneralOptions\nAlso Youtube has tons of videos about Compiz usage.\n", "Q: \"Super +D\" hides copy dialog forever How to show the 'copy progress window' after hiding it?.\nSuper +D hides copy dialog forever, selecting \"show copy dialog\" or Alt+ Tab does not have any effect. \nThe small progress bar is visible in the launcher icon of unity.

For example, in your case you might include the following:\n~/.screenrc\n# ...\n\nchdir ~\nscreen -t \"Htop\" htop\n\nchdir /var/log\nscreen -t \"System log\" tail -F syslog\nscreen -t \"Mail log\" tail -F mail.log\n\nchdir ~\nscreen   # Extra Bash window for running commands\n\n# ...\n\nNote that the screen here is not the screen command you run, but an internal screen command.

After doing this, I rebooted my machine, and ran nvcc --version. However, this prints out Cuda compilation tools, release 6.5, V6.5.16. Why has CUDA 7.0 not been installed properly?\n\nA: It could this known issue I found in the official CUDA 7 documentation: http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html#resolved-issues-title.\nIn section 7.1, the second point states this:\n\"The Canonical repackaging of the NVIDIA drivers on Ubuntu 14.04 may fail to upgrade cleanly to the latest version due to conflicts with the /etc/OpenCL/vendors/nvidia.icd file.

I'm temporarily living in managed accommodation with no wired network so I purchased a WiFi card for my headless server.

I know that seems an obvious answer, but just in case you didn't think of it.Click on the speaker from the icons at the very top right of your desktop, choose SOUND SETTINGS and check your output volume.  Mine, by default, was set very low.  Since you said you just recently made the change - I thought I'd start with the easiest possibility first.\nWhile you're there - check your INPUT and MIC settings too....

But what does dd stand for? \nI understand its use, but not what the name dd actually means, or is an acronym for.\n It doesn't even say in the man page.\n\nA: dd stands for Data Description.\n\nA: The syntax was inspired by the DD (data definition) statement of OS/360 JCL. \nSource:GNU\nMore Reading Here\n\nA: dd = \"Disc Dump\". \nThis utility comes from the original UNIX System operational environment where it was common to replicate secondary memory (mass storage devices in a \"Virtual Memory\" operating system). dd can do this, bit for bit, byte for byte, sector for sector, track for track, etc. It can also flip bits, convert EBCDIC to ASCII, change block sizes and do pretty much any other binary operation you'd want/need to move/convert/recover storage data.  Storage devices (all) in those days were much slower, less dense and far less reliable than today. We had to replace/repair \"Random Access Magnetic Storage Devices\", (e.g. disk drives, floppy and hard, magnetic cylinders, etc.) all the time.\nIn the event of a head crash, or other catastrophic storage device failure, \"dd\" was (and still is) one of my favorite utilities for extracting what data I could to a new device. Once the new device was installed, I could use fsck (file system check) and fsdb (file system debugger) to recover/repair some of the damaged file system and maybe extract some data.\nThis was also our first rudimentary backup system. The application process (dd), can operate as \"super user\" and read/write directly through the I/O subsystem (kernel) via character (raw) or block device driver [entry points], bypassing file system (kernel) yet completely replicating the file system construct to the new device. dd (like every other UNIX core utility) also has the ability to read from the standard input and write to the standard output allowing for it to be used for other things in a shell script :-) .... \n\nA: Always thought it stood for 'disk dupe' (duplicate disk)\nThink it was in SCO Unix Sys V version\n\nA: There are many theories.  I recall in Unix v7 (when dd first appeared) the man page said it meant disk dump (or was it data dump?) since it was frequently used as a disk backup/restore utility.  However, an archive of the v7 man page mentions no etymology nor meaning.  Possibly I heard it from someone at Bell Labs since I had occasional access in the early 1980s.\nOther theories are:\n\n\n*\n\n*data destroyer\n\n*data destructor\n\n*disk destroyer\n\n*delete data\n\n*duplicate data\n\n*originally for Copy and Convert, but was renamed because the C compiler already used cc (man dd from Unix-V7 on PDP-11)\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to have an \"Always on top\" feature in (L)ubuntu?

I also can't use initdb or pg_ctl. I can't find pg_hba.conf either.\n\nA: Where the pg_hba.conf file resides:\npg_hba.conf is in /etc/postgresql/X.Y/main/ (where X.Y is your version, 9.3 for you, 9.4 for me).\n\n\"Missing\" programs:\npg_ctl may not be installed by default. initdb may also not be installed by default.  Both are installable by postgres-xc.\n\nAdding users so they can be authorized:\nYou'll have to add a user/role in via the psql command line client.  You'll then have to add the user to pg_hba.conf.\nI suggest using pgadmin3, a graphical interface/program, to work with user roles and adding them.  It allows you to specifically select the individual permissions you want to give a user globally (which should usually be no special permissions, just to create the user, and give permissions for a given DB separately).\n\nConfiguring pg_hba.conf\nThis can be a little tricky.  Once you've got a user login role, you need to add them to pg_hba.conf.  The format of the file is fully explained in detail in the PosgreSQL documentation.  A short summary is here.\nUnless there is a matching line here, the default access rule is \"deny access\".\nThis is the format of a pg_hba.conf line:\nTYPE DATABASE USER ADDRESS METHOD\n\ntype is the type of connection.  Local connections from the same computer get the local type.  Connections from a non-local IP (i.e. over TCP) get the host type.  hostnossl can be used instead, and will identify any network connection to it (i.e. non-local) that is not over SSL.  hostssl can be used to specify any network connection that is over SSL, however it is not default to have SSL set up.\ndatabase is self-explanatory - what database do you want to set these access permissions/restrictions to.  A special database type is all which indicates all databases.\nuser is the username / role that you've added to Postgres.  It has to exist within postgres, and it may need to exist as a local system user (however that's explained in where I explain METHOD).\nADDRESS is an IPv4 or IPv6 address or range.  It is only to be used when host, hostnossl, or hostssl are specified under type.  It can be a CIDR range or an individual IP address.\nMETHOD is how to handle authentication.  \n\n\n*\n\n*For a local user with the local type, it should be peer authentication, or md5 authentication if you want the user to be able to login from a different local computer user account with a password.\n\n*For a host, hostssl, or hostnossl connection type, you probably want to use md5 here, however you may have other types of authentication (see the documentation link above).\n\n*Under no circumstances unless you are insane or really know what you are doing should you use the trust method.  This has zero authentication of the person and is a security hole from Hell, even for local type connections.\n\n\nI advise you to read through the linked documentation on the pg_hba.conf file, it's a better explanation of things.\n", "Q: How do I get out of root@ubuntu:~# I powered off my pcDuino system and now I am getting errors and eventually ending up in root@ubuntu:~#.

I subsequently wanted to add another node to my cluster, only to learn that there is no longer a button on the GUI to choose the Debian or Fast Installer.   The Debian installer is required for my HP Proliants because curtin fails to properly understand the raid array naming convention (https://bugs.launchpad.net/curtin/+bug/1263181).   I can't use vivid because I'm trying to use JuJu for openstack deployment and the charms are non existent.   \nSo the key question is: how can I force the Debian installer, or failing that, downgrade MAAS to a version that allows this?   \n--Update July 8, 2015\nIt occurred to me that my rationale for not using Vivid is not accurate.   It's true that I can't use vivid on my juju deployed/bootstrapped nodes, but I should be able to use it on my cluster/region controller.   I'll update this after I try.  \n\nA: I also hit that bug, but it's fixed and about to be pushed to the updates repository. Can you try installing the updated package from -proposed and see if it fixes it for you as well?\nInstructions for adding the -proposed repository are here in this bug comment:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/curtin/+bug/1263181/comments/21\n", "Q: Windows 10 Technical Preview not in GRUB I've installed Ubuntu 15.04 a while ago. Then I followed guides like this one on how to install windows after Ubuntu and I installed Windows 10 Technical Preview after Ubuntu. Then I booted up from a live CD, installed boot-repair, then I did a recommended repair. It put GRUB back there, but Windows 10 isn't on the GRUB menu. os-prober doesn't detect it, and it doesn't show up in the output if I do update-grub.\nI've done boot-repair again, but nothing happened and I don't know what to do. \nI have a BIOS motherboard and I have an MBR, with 4 primary partitions.\n\nA: Thanks to Organic Marble and Thomas W. for helping me solve this. Apparently Grub doesn't support the Windows 10 Technical Preview so you have to add the grub menu entry manually. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open /etc/grub.d/40_custom as root with gedit or another text editor.\n\n*Then you have to add an entry at the end of the file. Mine looked like this.\n'Windows 10 Technical Preview' {\nset root='(hd0,msdos2)'\nchainloader +1\n}\nThe name doesn't matter, and the set root='(hd0,msdos2)' command will vary. hd0 means my first hard drive, and msdos2 tells what partition the OS is on.\n\n\n*\n\n*run sudo update-grub\n\n*To check, open up /boot/grub/grub.cfg and check if there's a new entry.\n\n\nA: I thoroughly disagree. I recently installed Windows 10 Pro Technical Preview, build 10158, and went on to reinstall GRUB, and it works fine. I am dual booting Arch Linux and Windows 10. os-prober certainly detects Windows.\nThough I am not sure if these are necessary, but mount you Windows 10 partition (/dev/sdxZ) before os-prober.\nInstall Grub Customizer and try that. It should find Windows 10 for you. Otherwise, At the very least, you won't have to write GRUB configuration every time you need to update.\n", "Q: Apache permission issue Attempting to set up lamp on a new Ubuntu 15.04 install. I've probably set up lamp on Ubuntu 50 times but this one has me at my wit's end.

After scouring the apache error log I traced the issue back to the apache2.conf file, where the virtual host was not properly set up (I had missed a bracket ).

(ie, sometimes windows, sometimes linux.) \n\nA: During the VM creation in a program like VirtualBox, when you are creating the VXD or Virtual Drive it asks you where you want to save it at.\nYou can save it anywhere you want to.  The USB is one place you can, but it will be recommended to have the USB drive in before you launch your VM application as it scans for all parts.

Keep in mind if you add a password after -p that it should look like this: -psomepasswordthatdoesntlookrightbutis. -r is because I want it recursive through my folders and files within the main folder. \n\n\nI also realize that this means there will be a password in plain text on my machine in the alias file. But if someone has access to the alias file they also have access to my folder with these files in it anyway so it becomes irrelevant.\nThis should let me just go to terminal and type in cryptdoc and hit enter in order to create a 7-Zip file encrypted with my chosen password all ready for upload to some less-secure cloud storage. But How can I add a variable that actually grabs the YYYYMMDD at the time of typing cryptdoc into terminal and inserts it into the title of the document?\n\nA: This should work fine for you.  The date command is all that is needed.\nalias cryptodoc=\"cd ~/Desktop/ && 7z a -pSome_Pass -r ~/Desktop/$(date +%Y%m%d)_Documents_Backup.7z ~/Documents/* 2>/dev/null\"\n\nthe command for date +%Y%m%d means, run date, then + means format, then %Y means YYYY, %m means MM and %d means DD.  Having the $( ) around the date command means to run it at the time of the command.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Python Install Questions - PyDoc Not Working - Questions on Using GitHub This question is actually threefold. I have questions mostly regarding Python and the installation process. I also have questions on how I can find documentation for a module that is hosted on GitHub. \nI am currently running Ubuntu 14.04. Does this version of Ubuntu come with Python 2.x or 3.x already installed? I forgot to check this before moving forward with my own install of Python 2.7. I performed the install by downloading the tarball (is that what people call it?) from the Python website, unzipping it, and then running the make commands. Now I'm worried that I may have 2 installations of Python installed on my PC, but in two different directories. I'm not overly familiar with Ubuntu, so I don't know how to check if I unnecessarily installed Python when it was really there when I initially put Ubuntu onto my PC. Is this something I should be concerned about? And if so, what's the best way for me to get rid of the second installation?\nMy second question involves the python-twitter module. I installed this via sudo apt-get install python-twitter. I'm not sure if that was a valid approach, but I did see it come up on other posts on this forum. I am trying to do the Arduino Tweet-a-Pot and would like to understand the Python code that it uses. When I look at the python-twitter page on GitHub, it appears that I can find documentation using the PyDoc command. However, if I run the commands they recommend, I see the following output on my terminal:\nmike@BIGRED:~$ pydoc twitter.api\nno Python documentation found for 'twitter.api'\n\nHowever, if I run pydoc

And I know that the python-twitter was indeed installed correctly because the code works with my Arduino. How can I correct this? I'd like to have the PyDoc functionality work correctly for this and any future modules I plan to install. \nI should mention that I am try to teach myself programming and only have a fair amount of exposure of Python. I definitely still have much to learn. My last question is a simple one: How do I find documentation for the python-twitter module on GitHub? PyDoc doesn't seem to work, but I believe there should still be something on GitHub that would include the same information: what classes there are, the different methods available for each class, etc. Is it somewhere in the source code? Where on the GitHub page do I find this sort of information?\nAny clarification on any of this would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: Ubuntu has been shipping with Python for quite a while.  I'm quite certain that it probably came with your distro.  The easiest way to check is to just go into the software center and search for Python.  It will come up, and if there is a green check mark that means it is already installed.  \nAs for the python-twitter docs, I would be inclined to look for more info on twitter's developer pages.  Pretty much every api out there is listed and each has it's own info page.  IIRC the python-twitter api even has it's own google group.  So maybe search google groups for python-twitter as well.  \nAs for the pydoc issue, my understanding is that the stock pydoc library is for the core modules that ship with python.  \n", "Q: How to configure ubuntu 14.04 to run Icewm as default desktop display Manager How to configure ubuntu 14.04 to run Icewm as default desktop display Manager.\nwhich files to Configure to do this \n\nA: I assume that you're using LightDM as \"login manager\"?

I've tried obvious things (boot-repair etc.).\nSummary\nBy default, the only way I can currently boot my machine is by inserting the Ubuntu (14.04) stick I created to install a dual-boot system alongside Windows 8.1. A couple of required manual steps are described below. Also described below are the steps I can take to enable a successful reboot without the USB stick, however these settings do not persist, and fail after a second reboot. The question is: how can I make my UEFI settings persist across reboots?\nInitial situation: boot failure and workaround\nIf the stick is not inserted, boot fails (after the option to enter the settings menu) with a \"please insert correct media and reboot\" type message.\nWith the drive inserted, I can access the (USB) grub command line and then get to the installed grub configuration via:\nconfigfile (hd1,gpt2)/EFI/ubuntu/grub.cfg\nThe second grub menu then enables booting Ubuntu or the original Windows 8.1 instance.\nApparent fix: grub-install and efibootmgr\nIf I take the following two steps, I can obtain a successful reboot to the installed grub menu (no USB stick required):\n1) sudo grub-install --efi-directory=/boot/efi --target=x86_64-efi --uefi-secure-boot\n2) sudo efibootmgr -n 0\nNote, ubuntu is entry 0000 (and active) in efibootmgr output.\nAfter these steps, efibootmgr -v yields similar output regarding the Ubuntu installation before and after one reboot (but only one), namely:\nBootOrder: 0000,0005,0004,0001,0002\nBoot0000* ubuntu    HD(2,96800,32000,e3ae99c8-b2d4-4941-94cf-58a12eec0c21)File(\\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi)\nBut, a second reboot fails (if the two commands above are not executed) and now requires the USB stick again. After the second reboot, efibootmgr -v yields:\nBoot0000  ubuntu    Vendor(99e275e7-75a0-4b37-a2e6-c5385e6c00cb,)\nNo longer active and no longer correctly configured.\nSuggestions? Again, happy to post further details if that helps.\n\nA: First, look for an updated firmware from your manufacturer. (It will probably be listed as a \"BIOS update,\" although it's not really a BIOS.) After updating, you'll have to re-register GRUB with efibootmgr. With any luck it will start working; however, don't get your hopes up, since these updates seldom do any good.\nAnother option that sometimes works is to set the default boot option via Windows. You can do this by opening an Administrator's Command Prompt window and typing:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi\n\nIf neither a firmware update nor setting the Ubuntu boot loader as the default using Windows helps and the computer is new, I strongly suggest you return it to the store for a refund, on the grounds that the behavior you're seeing is a design defect. Manufacturers will continue delivering machines with that sort of defect if they don't feel the pain of doing so, and the only way they'll feel any sort of pain is if machines are returned and they know why.\nIf the machine is too old to be returned for a refund, your only choice is an ugly shell game with boot loader filenames, as I describe on this page of mine. This is most easily done via Boot Repair, which provides an option to do such renaming and reconfigure GRUB appropriately on its Advanced menu. The option is called something like \"back up and rename EFI boot files\" (but that's from memory; the exact wording is almost certainly something slightly different).\n", "Q: Cannot configure network on ubuntu server I have a desktop running ubuntu server(without GUI) on which i want to configure the internet settings.

Thanks\n\nA: Ethernet Interfaces\nEthernet interfaces are identified by the system using the naming convention of ethX, where X represents a numeric value. The first Ethernet interface is typically identified as eth0, the second as eth1, and all others should move up in numerical order.\n\n\n*\n\n*Identify Ethernet Interfaces\n\n\nAn application that can help identify all network interfaces available to your system is the lshw command. In the example below, lshw shows a single Ethernet interface with the logical name of eth0 along with bus information, driver details and all supported capabilities.\nsudo lshw -class network\n  *-network\n       description: Ethernet interface\n       product: BCM4401-B0 100Base-TX\n       vendor: Broadcom Corporation\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:03:00.0\n       logical name: eth0\n       version: 02\n       serial: 00:15:c5:4a:16:5a\n       size: 10MB/s\n       capacity: 100MB/s\n       width: 32 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: (snipped for brevity)\n       configuration: (snipped for brevity)\n       resources: irq:17 memory:ef9fe000-ef9fffff\n\nDynamic IP Address Assignment (DHCP Client)\nTo configure your server to use DHCP for dynamic address assignment, add the dhcp method to the inet address family statement for the appropriate interface in the file /etc/network/interfaces. The example below assumes you are configuring your first Ethernet interface identified as eth0.\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nBy adding an interface configuration as shown above, you can manually enable the interface through the ifup command which initiates the DHCP process via dhclient.\nsudo ifup eth0\nTo manually disable the interface, you can use the ifdown command, which in turn will initiate the DHCP release process and shut down the interface.\nsudo ifdown eth0\nStatic IP Address Assignment\nTo configure your system to use a static IP address assignment, add the static method to the inet address family statement for the appropriate interface in the file /etc/network/interfaces. The example below assumes you are configuring your first Ethernet interface identified as eth0. Change the address, netmask, and gateway values to meet the requirements of your network. \nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 10.0.0.100\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 10.0.0.1\n\nAfter all this, please restart your networking service,\nsudo service networking restart\nFor more information: Ubuntu Server Guide\n\nA: First, see, do you ubuntu recognize your network card.\nEnough is to run command \nifconfig | grep eth\n\nIs server see card output will be similar\nxxx@xxx ~ $ ifconfig | grep eth\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 38:2c:4a:03:a1:46 \n\nTo configure DHCP address you need to edit the /etc/network/interfaces and you need to enter the following lines replace eth0 with your network interface card\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n\nChange configuration of eth0 to:\n# The primary network interface -- use DHCP to find our address\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\n", "Q: Unable To Run Nightrain On Ubuntu 64bit 14.04LTS Please Help $ ./nightrain\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<string>\", line 7, in <module>\n  File \"/home/naetech/Applications/Repositories/pyinstaller/PyInstaller/loader/pyi_importers.py\", line 270, in load_module\n  File \"/home/naetech/Sites/nightrain/build/nightrain/out00-PYZ.pyz/Classes.GUI\", line 7, in <module>\n  File \"/home/naetech/Applications/Repositories/pyinstaller/PyInstaller/loader/pyi_importers.py\", line 270, in load_module\n  File \"/home/naetech/Sites/nightrain/build/nightrain/out00-PYZ.pyz/wx.html2\", line 8, in <module>\n  File \"/home/naetech/Applications/Repositories/pyinstaller/PyInstaller/loader/pyi_importers.py\", line 414, in load_module\nImportError: libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\n\nA: The library libGL.so.1 is part of the packages below, listed by the command apt-file search --regex libGL\\.so\\.1$ | awk -F: '{print $1}'.\nfglrx\nfglrx-updates\nlibgl1-mesa-glx\nnvidia-304\nnvidia-304-updates\nnvidia-340\nnvidia-340-updates\nnvidia-346\nnvidia-346-updates\nprimus-libs\n\nTherefore, if you have an AMD GPU:\nsudo apt-get install fglrx fglrx-updates\n\nfor an NVidia, better look here...\n", "Q: How do I uninstall Master PDF Editor 3?

In firefox, I can import the certificate. However, I can't do so with the command line. For example, running git push I get:\nfatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/user/repo': server certificate verification failed. CAfile: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt CRLfile: none\n\nHow do I import a certificate to remove this? The import must be able to authenticate for me. Also, it is a .cer file, so the answer for .crt will not work. Also, I do not want steps on how to setup git, as I already have. I want to know if it is possible to do that. Or can I just disable authentication with the git command totally and make it ignore certificates like what the answer here says? Also, I do not want the webpage to load, I have set firefox to do that. I want the git push command to give the standard output like:\n[master 630d087] message\n 1 file changed, 93 insertions(+), 80 deletions(-)\n rewrite somefile (84%)\nCounting objects: 9, done.\nDelta compression using up to 4 threads.\nCompressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (5/5), 978 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.\nTotal 5 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)\nTo https://github.com/User/Repo.git\n   851ae39..630d087  master -> master\n\nNote: I found out its git config --global http.sslverify false. But I would like to see an answer for everything, not just a git hack\n\nA: The ca-certificates package has the instructions in its README.Debian:\n\nIf you want to install local certificate authorities to be implicitly trusted, please put the certificate files as single files ending with .crt into /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ and re-run\n  update-ca-certificates.\n\nNote that it mentions a directory different from the other answers here:\n/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/\n\nAfter copying into /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ you can then update the cert's permissions and run sudo update-ca-certificates as mentioned in Telegraphers answer. You will see in the output that the cert was added.\n\nA: Extensions .crt, .pem and .cer are interchangeable, just change the file name extension, they have the same form. Try this:\n$ sudo cp mycert.cer /usr/share/ca-certificates/mycert.pem\n$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates\n$ sudo update-ca-certificates\n$ git config --global http.sslCAInfo /usr/share/ca-certificates/mycert.pem\n\n\nA: TL;DR\nFor everything to work and not only your browser, you need to add that CA certificate to the system's trusted CA repository.\nIn ubuntu:\n\n*\n\n*Go to /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/\n\n*Create a new folder, i.e. \"sudo mkdir school\"\n\n*Copy the .crt file into the school folder\n\n*Make sure the permissions are OK (755 for the folder, 644 for the file)\n\n*Run \"sudo update-ca-certificates\"\n\nWhy\nLet me explain what is going on also, so the other posters see why they don't need any certificate to use Github over HTTPS.\nWhat is going on there is that your school is intercepting all the SSL communications, probably in order to monitor them.\nTo do that, what they do is in essence a \"man in the middle\" attack, and because of that, your browser complains rightfully that it is not being able to verify github's certificate. Your school proxy is taking out github's cert and instead providing its own cert.\nWhen your browser tries to verify the school's provided cert against the CA that signed github's cert, it rightfully fails.\nSo, for the SSL connection to work in the school, you need to consciously accept that \"MITM\" attack. And you do that by adding the school's CA certificate as a trusted one.\nWhen you trust that school CA, your verification of the fake github cert will work, since the fake github cert will be verified by the school CA.\nBe aware that SSL connection is not safe anymore since your school administrator will be able to intercept all your encrypted connections.\n\nA: I was having a similar problem where installing the certificate in firefox and google chrome worked but Updating in terminal sudo apt-get update was not working and giving  403  Forbidden IP errors.\nI was too having a sample.cer file. So basically I have to convert it to .crt first.\nsudo openssl x509 -inform DER -in sample.cer -out sample.crt\n\nStill while doing sudo dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates I couldn't find the required certificate.\nThe problem with me is that I was copying the certificate at the wrong place.\nInstead of copying it at $/usr/share/ca-certificates  I was copying it at $/usr/local/share/ca-certificates\nBut by placing it in the right place solved my problem.\nBut I'm still not able to update the packages or install new packages.\nQuick fix (for me on):\nUse of ftp instead of http \nsudo sed -i s/http/ftp/ /etc/apt/sources.list && apt-get update\n\nand above command worked.\nPlease make a copy of sources.list file before making the changes.\nIf anything is not clear or not proper please do correct me.\n\nA: I read all solutions and solved like this;\nsudo openssl x509 -inform DER -in certificate.cer -out certificate.crt\n\nsudo mv certificate.crt /usr/share/ca-certificate/\n\ncd /usr/share/ca-certificate\n\nsudo chmod 644 certificate.crt\n\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates\n\nsudo update-ca-certificates\n\n\nA: I use the following compilation of previous answers:\nsudo -i\necho | openssl s_client -showcerts -servername site.example.com -connect example.com:443 2>/dev/null | awk '/-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----/, /-----END CERTIFICATE-----/' >> /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ca-certificates.crt \nupdate-ca-certificates\n\nOften both site.example.com and example.com are the same hostnames.\n\nA: To access a website with https, whether you are using a CLI or GUI browser, you don't need your shool certificate.\nTo use git via http(s) you need to register your public key in your profile settings on GitHub.\nMore infos here.

This issue is only at the right edge of the screen, I can see everything else, so no overscan. I'm using a palit 960, and the cable IS plugged into the card, not the motherboard.\n\nA: Does the monitor get correctly identified in System Settings > Screen Display? There is also a scale option there in Ubuntu 15.04, I don't remember if that was there in earlier releases.\nFailing that, I can't say this will definitely solve your problem, but I know you can alter screen geometry with xrandr which I had to do with Crunchbang in a virtual machine.\nFrom a terminal, running xrandr bare will list modes and tell you what's currently set. To change screen size you can try for example\n    $ xrandr --size 1680x1050 &\n\nor change mode\n    $ xrandr --mode 1680x1050 --pos 0x0 --rotate normal &\n\nAnd you can alter the framebuffer size too, perhaps shrink it and reposition. The man xrandr page has a few examples.\nI think the changes are non-permanent though, I'm not sure where each distribution expects settings to be written.\n", "Q: Wifi is frequently disconnecting The Wifi is frequently disconnecting in Ubuntu 15.04.

The tool also recognizes this partition as \"Linux\".\n\n*When rebooting, the Windows Boot Manager appears and shows me the new Ubuntu entry as possible option\n\nBut when I select Ubuntu, GRUB is not showing up.

Would appreciate a link to a license doc about this.\nThanks\n\nA: Rooting a Android device and installing a Custom ROM or another OS device isn't illegal. You will lost your warranty, that's all.\n\nA: They might not like it, but it's not illegal.\nIf it's a Nexus 7 2012 then I think it's a good idea as the Lollipop update has made it pretty much unusable anyway.\nThat said, it looks like the 2012 version is no longer supported by Ubuntu touch. \n", "Q: What's the difference between removing and then installing, and just reinstalling? For instance, as apt-get relies on some packages in coreutils, if you do:\nsudo apt-get remove coreutils\n\nYou will not be able to reinstall it by then running:\nsudo apt-get install coreutils\n\nBut if I were just to simply try to reinstall coreutils with:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall coreutils\n\nIt would work.

Don't they do the same thing?\n\nA: apt-get remove {package} Remove/Delete an installed package except configuration files.\nRemove is identical to install except that packages are removed instead of installed. If a plus sign (+) is appended to the package name (with no intervening space), the identified package will be installed instead of removed. \n--reinstall, Re-Install packages that are already installed and at the newest version. \ninstall.

Everything was working alright, until today, when I couldn't connect to one of my accounts. A Server closed the connection error was being displayed. My other account could log-in from pidgin just fine. But just a moment ago that other account as well failed to connect to facebook displaying an Internal server error. Did facebook completely withdraw support for XMPP chat? In that case is there any way to chat on facebook using pidgin or any other third party software?\n\nA: Edit: I've noticed that my answer below is outdated. The installation method has changed. Anyone interested in a solution to the problem should just go to the page https://github.com/jgeboski/purple-facebook and follow the instuctions written there. Therefore, my original post is useless now.\nThe original post:\nI ran into the same problem this morning and I've just found a solution here: https://github.com/jgeboski/purple-facebook\nIt will add new Facebook protocol to Pidgin that works for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the page below and download the latest purple-facebook-*.tar.gz\nhttps://github.com/jgeboski/purple-facebook/releases\n\n*Follow the steps written on the first page above under Building and Installing on linux and other platforms. It was quite difficult for me to compile it. I had to install some missing programs via Synaptic, I'm not sure which were really needed, however you are going to need libjson-glib-dev for sure. That was the last thing I needed to successfully configure it.\n\n*Scroll up to Basic usage and follow the last steps.\n\n\nThat should be it. Please, let us know how it went!\n\nA: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/chat\nOn April 30, 2014, facebook announced the deprecation of the XMPP Chat API as part of the release of Platform API v2.0.\nAfter April 30th, 2015 apps will no longer be able to access the service or API. This includes both access to chat.facebook.com and the xmpp_login permission.\nfacebook recommend people access Facebook Messages on the desktop via Facebook.com or Messenger.com.\n\nA: James Geboski is now providing builds for Debian & Ubuntu, so it is now as simple as:\n\n\n*\n\n*add the repository as source and install purple-facebook\n\n*restart pidgin\n\n*Edit account changing the protocol to Facebook and removign @chat.facebook.com from the username\n\n\nFull instructions are here purple-facebook Installing on *NIX  wiki page.\n\nA: Facebook dropped their XMPP server and therefore Pidgin cannot connect to it anymore. In order to use Facebook chat in Pidgin you have to install the purple-facebook plugin.Open up a terminal and type:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install purple-facebook\n\nFrom Pidgin's main page go to Tools→Accounts→Manage Accounts and choose your Facebook account and hit Modidy. In the Protocol dropdown choose Facebook (Not Facebook XMPP) and enter your user name and password (facebook user name, email or phone will be valid user names).\nTested and working as expected.\nAs of October 18, 2015, the purple-facebook was merged into the mainline Pidgin project. It will appear in the next major release of Pidgin and the above procedure will not be required.\n", "Q: Tint2 do not startup when Unity boot in first time I use tint2 in my Ubuntu 14.04, but it didn't startup in the first time when I logging my user.

I'm really new to the command line and Ubuntu and I have recently learned that there is the scp command as well as the cp command. I tried to use an scp command to move a directory from Point A to Point B, but it didn't work. However, when I used cp, it worked just fine.\nWhat is the difference between the two and how do I determine when to use one over the other?\n\nA: scp or Secure Copy is primarily used to copy between a local host and remote host, or two remote hosts, via ssh\nThe cp command is for copying files locally, i.e. within your host's system.\nThe man pages that muru has linked in comments should help you understand usage, but there are many tutorials on that internet thing too.\n\nA: You should also learn that there is a man command. Try it! man cp, man scp, man man.  \nman cp starts out:  \n    NAME\n       cp - copy files and directories\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       cp [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST\n       cp [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY\n       cp [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       Copy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.\n\nand man scp begins with:  \n    NAME\n     scp — secure copy (remote file copy program)\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     scp [-12346BCpqrv] [-c cipher] [-F ssh_config] [-i identity_file] [-l limit] [-o ssh_option] [-P port] [-S program] [[user@]host1:]file1 ... [[user@]host2:]file2\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     scp copies files between hosts on a network.  It uses ssh(1) for data transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the same security as     ssh(1).  Unlike rcp(1), scp will\n     ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for authentication.\n\n\nA: TL;DR Read the man pages:\nman scp\nman cp\n\n\nFrom man scp\nNAME\n     scp — secure copy (remote file copy program)\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     scp [-12346BCpqrv] [-c cipher] [-F ssh_config] [-i identity_file] [-l limit] [-o ssh_option] [-P port] [-S program] [[user@]host1:]file1 ...\n         [[user@]host2:]file2\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     scp copies files between hosts on a network.  It uses ssh(1) for data transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the same security\n     as ssh(1).  scp will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for authentication.\n\n     File names may contain a user and host specification to indicate that the file is to be copied to/from that host.  Local file names can be made\n     explicit using absolute or relative pathnames to avoid scp treating file names containing ‘:’ as host specifiers.  Copies between two remote\n     hosts are also permitted.\n\nfrom man cp\nNAME\n       cp - copy files and directories\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       cp [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST\n       cp [OPTION]...

Eg:\nscp /path/to/local/file user@server:/path/to/target/dir/\n\n\nA: If you have spaces in filenames, scp handles them more nicely than cp, so I often use it even for copying on my local machine for that reason.\n", "Q: Kernel Not Installing I followed the exact steps from here and installed MPTCP Kernel on Ubuntu 14.04 on a system. I had to reinstall Ubuntu due to some reasons, the same 14.04 version and now when I follow the steps I can't install the kernel i.e. even after the reboot, uname -r shows the kernel version 3.16 and not the mptcp kernel.\nIs it that the kernel which was used by Ubuntu 14.04 changed ? Or could there be some other possible causes because the steps in the linked worked entirely the previous time.\n\nA: Grub always boots with the latest kernel by default.\nUbuntu 14.04 had 3.13 kernel, you installed kernel 3.14 and the systems booted with 3.14.\nUbuntu 14.04.2 has 3.16 kernel. That is higher that 3.14 and the system boots with 3.16.\nYou can go to boot menu bu pressing Shift at boot and boot with the desired kernel.\nTo make this permanent you can remove standard Ubuntu kernels image and headers using synaptic and also remove meta packages linux-image-generic-lts-utopic and linux-headers-generic-lts-utopic.\nYou will always boot with the custom kernel.\n", "Q: Crashplan on headless Ubuntu 14.04 - remote GUI not working I'm having issues getting Crashplan remote GUI working correctly on my headless Ubuntu 14.04 servers. This is what I've tried so far; \nFollowed this guide to produce a SSH tunnel - http://support.code42.com/CrashPlan/Latest/Configuring/Using_CrashPlan_On_A_Headless_Computer\nThat didn't work. Just stalls on connecting and doesn't connect. I figured that it might be something to do with the SSH tunnel that might be wonky so tried a different approach and skipped the whole SSH tunnel (sincde I'm doing this on my own LAN) - http://www.liquidstate.net/how-to-manage-your-crashplan-server-remotely/\nThat still didn't work. I then tried several other things, such as firewalls (added ports to iptables) and changing ports up (besides 4200). Nothing worked. \nI started to get the feeling that perhaps it was my Windows 10 preview that was the culprit so I started all over, installed the Crashplan app again on a different Ubuntu 14.04 server and the GUI on a Windows 7 laptop. Still the same issue regardless if doing it with SSH tunneling or not .... \nI get the feeling that I'm missing something fairly obvious - could someone perhaps chime in about what it could perhaps be?

I found this question but it is not about Mail, is just profile. \nI want to migrate all my e-mail in Thunderbird and attachment from Windows 7 to my Thunderbird in my Ubuntu 14.04. \nExists a program for that? Or I have to use others ways? \nThanks very much. \n\nA: Best is to Use IMAP if you insist on POP se the alternative at the bottom.\nSince you are using the POP protocol in your mail client. Mails are most probably being downloaded to your email client and removed form the server \n(check your email client settings to verify this)\nIf you were running IMAP already  you would only need to to Step NR 3 \n1) Set up IMAP on your old mail client.\nDisable checking of email with the POP account but do not remove it\nand re add another  the same email account in your windows email client, but this time with IMAP support instead of POP support. \nSince IMAP will not download and remove emails from the mail server ,but simply make an cached version of your emails in your email client. Allowing you to read delete and otherwise interact with your emails from multiple devies.\n2) Move emails back to server\nOnce that is done , drag and drop all your emails from your pop3 inbox in your mail client into the IMAP inbox you should be having.\nThis will basically re-upload the emails onto your e-mail providers server.\n3) Configure IMAP on thunderbird.\nOnce all email have been moved back.\nYou can simply configure your thunderbird on linux or any email client\nto gain access to your emails.\nIn general IMAP is always preferred over POP as it has better support for handling email when using multiple email clients in multiple locations.\n\nIf you insist on continuing using POP:\nSince the Thunderbird file format is the same between different operating systems you can actually extract the data file manually from the install folders. \nBut it might be easier just to install the import export add on ,\nexport the emails with it , move that file to the new place and import it with the same add on. \n\nA: If you can sync all your mails from your mail server, then you can simply configure thunderbird on ubuntu 14.04 and sync it. \nIn case you have mails stored locally on Windows (which are not available on mail server) then you have to copy the local archived folder from Windows and copy it to ubuntu. Thuderbird picks the mails from that.\nFor details instructions please follow this page. \n", "Q: Unable to switch to Nvidia 331 graphics driver I'm trying to get HDMI video output working in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, which I've not had any luck with so far. \nSo I installed the proprietary Nvidia 331 driver.\nHowever the system still appears to be using the Intel driver as default\n    lspci -k | grep VGA -A2\n    00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 18)\n    Subsystem: Dell Device 044f\n    Kernel driver in use: i915\n    --\n    01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GT216M [GeForce GT 330M] (rev ff)\n    Kernel driver in use: nouveau\n    01:00.1 Audio device: NVIDIA Corporation GT216 HDMI Audio Controller (rev ff)\n\nSo I ran the Nvida X server settings utility\nnvidia-settings\n\nAnd it allows you to select the GPU you'd like to use.

I use the following command to clear a directory, of files and directories over 30 days old, and move them to an archive directory which I can delete after a few weeks if nobody asks for their files back. The target directory has subdirectories by user name, so will the archive directory.\nThis is the command I use:\nfind /path/to/directory/username/ -mtime +30 -exec mv \"{}\" /path/to/archive/username/ \\;\n\nI suggested a modified version of this to answer a question on ask ubuntu, another user edited the code to change the end of line \\; for + as it's faster(and more correct?). See here\nHowever, using + in this way works if the -exec command is ls -lh but not in the actual command that I use. If I try it with + I get an error message:\nfind: missing argument to '-exec'\n\nI don't understand why it's behaving this way, or what the correct command would be. Please don't just post a command correction, I'd like to understand rather than just follow a suggestion blindly.\n\nA: The user in that post may said that the + sign at the end of a -exec command is faster, but not why.\nLets assume the find command return the following files:\n/path/to/file1\n/path/to/file2\n/path/to/file3\n\nThe normal -exec command (-exec command {} \\;) runs once for each matching file. For example: \nfind ... -exec mv {} /target/ \\;\n\nExecutes:\nmv /path/to/file1 /target/\nmv /path/to/file2 /target/\nmv /path/to/file3 /target/\n\nIf you use the + sign (-exec command {} +) the command is build by adding multiple matched files at the end of the command. For example:\nfind ... -exec mv -t /target/ {} +\n\nExecutes:\nmv -t /target/ /path/to/file1 /path/to/file2 /path/to/file3\n\nTo use the + flag correctly the argument to process must be at the end of the command, not in the middle. That's why find trows missing argument to '-exec' in your example; it misses the closing {}.\n\nA: The user explained their edit....\n  \n...using this link. I think basically instead of using multiple commands, it sends all the filenames to one command instance, to speed things up. Here is a example from here:\n\nUsing -exec with a semicolon (find . -exec ls '{}' \\;), will execute\nls file1\nls file2\nls file3\n\nBut if you use a plus sign instead (find . -exec ls '{}' \\+), all\n  filenames will be passed as arguments to a single command:\nls file1 file2 file3\n\n\nThere are other forms available using ; and + as well (from here:)\nTherefore the following example syntax is allowed for find command:\n\nfind . -exec echo {} \\;\nfind . -exec echo {} ';'\nfind . -exec echo {} \";\"\nfind . -exec echo {} \\+\nfind . -exec echo {} +\n\n\nHOWEVER, I'm not sure this will work with the move command anyway, as it's syntax is  mv [OPTION]... SOURCE DEST, unless the -t option or similar is used. However it should work with ls with no extra options etc as they can understand when multiple filenames are given. The + may also need to be escaped (i.e. \\+)\n", "Q: MultiOSBoot Problems I want to install Ubuntu on my laptop to run along side windows.

If in doubt, try another distribution like Fedora, another boot method or other media. Also, while the kernel is named vmlinuz.efi, this doesn't imply EFI booting or any failure in doing so, it's apparently just a filename extension chosen to hint at that this kernel also includes an EFI stub but could boot both legacy and EFI. Furthermore since it's looking for a file that actually exists there is nothing that requires renaming, modifying or adding in the ISO.\n(Yes this does not solve the problem brought up in the bounty, which has nothing to do with initial question, is even worse to reproduce and should be asked in a separate question if there exists no satisfying answer.

On Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty, I had LXC running, but recently I upgraded from 1.0.7 to 1.1.2 as per the instructions here on Launchpad. However, I found that I could not start my containers any more. After stepping through the container startup logs (starting the container with logging output) I could see that it was because the network bridge hadn't been created on startup by /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/lxc/lxc-net, the network startup script for LXC.\nI managed to get the bridge up by following LXC NET fails to create bridge on Ubuntu Server 14.04 | community.flockport.com\nHowever, that still indicated a problem with dnsmasq (no DNS resolution) and lxcbr0 (the default LXC container bridge) not having any NAT rules. The instructions are more of a quick fix to alleviate the symptoms without fixing the problem. I can't ping out of the containers, and it seems to me that the network setup script isn't being run at startup.

When I run the OpenVPN script (from HMA), the connection from my local machine to the server over SSH gets lost - connecting is not possible any more and I have to manually kill the VPN process. Additionally, a hidden TOR service (.onion page) is unavailable in that time. \nIs is possible somehow that the TOR page is available and I can connect over SSH while the server is connected to the VPN?\n\nA: The problem is that the default gateway gets changed by OpenVPN, and that breaks any connection coming in on the non-VPN interface. Linux will send responses to packets that came in on the real interface out the VPN interface! You need to set up appropriate routes before you start OpenVPN.\nWhat follows works for me. It uses iptables and ip (iproute2). Below, it is assumed that the default gateway interface before OpenVPN is started is \"eth0\". The idea is to ensure that when a connection to eth0 is made, even if eth0 is not the default gateway interface anymore, response packets for the connection go back on eth0 again.\nYou could use the same number for the connection mark, firewall mark and routing table. I used distinct numbers to make the diffences between them more apparent.\n# set \"connection\" mark of connection from eth0 when first packet of connection arrives\nsudo iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j CONNMARK --set-mark 1234\n\n# set \"firewall\" mark for response packets in connection with our connection mark\nsudo iptables -t mangle -A OUTPUT -m connmark --mark 1234 -j MARK --set-mark 4321\n\n# our routing table with eth0 as gateway interface\nsudo ip route add default dev eth0 table 3412\n\n# route packets with our firewall mark using our routing table\nsudo ip rule add fwmark 4321 table 3412\n\n===\nUPDATE:\nThe above works fine for me on Debian Jessie. But on an older Wheezy system I have just found that I need to add \"via\" to the routing table entry:\n# our routing table with eth0 as gateway interface\nsudo ip route add default dev eth0 via 12.345.67.89 table 3412\n\nThere \"12.345.67.89\" must be the original non-VPN gateway.\n\nA: I have a similar problem. My Ubuntu desktop is on a VPN and my normal SSH connection doesn't work from outside the home network.\nSomething I did just think of, though. Do you still have the ports forwarded to that computer?\nThe VPN assigns a new IP address from the VPN site so the router can no longer find that IP address to connect to.\nI would assume that you would need to know the new IP address assigned by the VPN host to know what address to connect to.\nI am only giving educated guesses, not known fix; so please don't abuse me if it doesn't work. :)\nOn further investigation, I discovered that you need to forward the ports through your VPN (I think) because the VPN is redirecting port 80 and your SSH tunnels usually use port 22. I think you need to forward port 22 through your VPN so that when you connect to your vpn on port 80 it redirects you through to your forwarded port required by your SSH tunnel ie. PuTTy.\nI'm still not 100% sure this is how to do it. If someone can confirm that, it would be great.\n", "Q: No firefox update ubuntu 14.04 I am amazed this never happened for so long but I noticed that firefox is no longer being upgraded on my ubuntu 14.04 so I am stuck on 38\nWill canonical upgrade the firefox in 14.04 soon if not is there a stable official firefox ppa for ubuntu 14.04 that will get latest stable ff updates ??\nThank you\n\nA: It will be updated, when maintainers decide.\nStable 39 has been released on July 2.\nNext version can be installed from ppa\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/firefox-next \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install firefox\n\nThis is an Official Firefox PPA\nNote: Generally this ppa contains next beta version of Firefox.

The only thing I can click on are the system icon in the top right corner of the screen (the dropdown with system settings, users etc.).\nI have a Windows 8 dual boot, and the mouse works fine there so I'm pretty sure it's not a hardware problem. Regardless, I tried another mouse, and the same thing happens.\nAfter finding this and this similar topics, I tried a couple of thing.\nFirst thing I did was try compiz --replace, which makes my mouse work for a couple of seconds, then freezes up again.\nI tried reinstalling inputattach, and all packages including the word mouse one by one, and nothing changed.\nI tried removing (with purge) flashplugin-nonfree / flashplugin-installer, and nothing changed.\nI tried writing gksudo gedit /usr/lib/nspluginwrapper/i386/linux/npviewer, upon which I get a strange error about mouse focus being taken away (gedit doesn't open).

I really don't won't to be doing this every time, firstly because it's annoying, but more importantly because ubuntu is my development environment, and I don't like knowing what's wrong.\nSo I tried reinstalling my ubuntu configuration. Guess what, I load the live demo to install ubuntu, and the same problem is there. Mouse doesn't work until I replace unity. So I left my current installation as is.\nAny help you can offer at this point (been trying to wrap my head around this for 12 hours) is appreciated.\n\nA: Have you been able to solve the Problem definitely?  Or did it just vanish?\nCurrently I'm experiencing exactly the same Problem: After booting I can start exactly one application and few seconds later the mouse clicks do no longer work. \nMouse movement and (sometimes) scrolling work fine. \nMouse clicks in the dash work, but nowhere else.\nAnd this Situation can be resolved with \nCTRL-ALT T\nunity --replace\n\nBut this is a tedious workaround. \nThe strange thing is: \nI had similar problems already quite often. Such problems occour randomly (presumably after an update) and vanish again a few weeks later (presumably after another update)  but until now I have never been able to track them really down. Besides the obvious, that it has to do with compiz and unity or its predecessors. \nI have the hardware in operation since 2011 and I had this situation about once a year, always with the up to date Ubuntu. \nAt another place it seemed, that is has to do with the ASUS Motherboard.

E.g.:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal (which covers ~25% of the screen)\n\n*Press Ctrl + Alt + 5 and it's maximized\n\n*Press Ctrl + Alt + 5 again, and it's back to covering 25% of the screen.\n\n\nIn 14.04, pressing Ctrl + Alt + 5 the first time will maximize a window, but on the second time it will start toggling between maximized and full-screen (w/o menus). It won't ever restore the window's size to the non-maximized state.\nI know there's another key that can do it (Ctrl + Super + Down = Restore Window), however, pressing this one twice will minimize the window entirely.\nIs there a way to restore the behavior from 12.04?\n\nA: Well, after installing Metacity (sudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback), the behavior is as expected. From that I gather that the altered behavior is local to the Unity Launcher.\nDon't think I can do much about it. But since I'm running inside a VirtualBox VM on a Win 8.1 system, and since Ubuntu 14.04 is way wayyy slower than 12.04 (especially with Unity Launcher), I think I'll stick with Metacity, which is a 2D display manager (as opposed to Unity Launcher or Gnome Compize, which are 3D and are killing the whole VM experience for me).\n\nA: Try the Unity Tweak tool; research if you think this add on addresses functionality.

things you can try.  First off, have you tried creating a new ethereum-ethereum-<version>.list file for ethereum in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ manually?  I doubt that will make any difference if it's truly a verifcation error, but if apt is just being screwy that could do it. The line you would want to put in that file is something like: \ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ethereum/ethereum/ubuntu trusty main\n\nAnother thing you could try is, if you trust ethereum, you can pass in the allow-unauthenticated flag to apt-get, that may do it.  This is NOT a particularly good idea. \napt-get --allow-unauthenticated add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum\n\nYou could also try and download a certificate from ethereum, but a cursory glance at their blog suggests they're not too hot on signing authorities, so I don't know if that approach is viable.  \n", "Q: Possible to run Ubuntu just off a USB drive?

In the end I would like to add some space to the boot partition as well.\nThanks for your time in reading this question and let me know if there are additional details I could give you. \n\nA: You use gparted to resize partitions.  In 12.04 you will need to boot from the livecd and run it from there as it can not resize partitions that are mounted.  In later releases, it can grow many partitions while they are mounted.  This will only give LVM more space to allocate to logical volumes.  If you want to grow a logical volume, you can run for instance lvresize -L 30g ubuntu-vg/root to increase the size of your root lv to 30g.  Then you need to tell the filesystem to use that new space, which you can do with resize2fs /dev/ubuntu-vg/root, assuming you are using the default ext4 filesystem.  These two latter steps can be performed online rather than booting from other media.  You can also specify 100% instead of 30g to lvresize to use all available space, but it kind of defeats the purpose of using LVM in the first place to allocate all space to one logical volume, since you don't have any free space for creating snapshots, new logical volumes, or growing some volumes later.\n\nA: If you want to do this without GUI tools, you can use parted.\nOn my system, I was expanding the root filesystem (which was on dev/sda3) from 128GB to 160GB. Adjust the examples below depending on your setup. All the commands must be run as root (sudo -i to login as root).\nBeforehand, I was at 95% usage:\n# df -h\nFilesystem                         Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv  124G  113G  6.3G  95% /\n\nWith Gen2 virtual machines, everything can be done online, while the guest OS is running, and without rebooting. Each step is almost instantaneous.\nFirst, expand the virtual disk using the Hyper-V GUI or CLI tools (easiest way is to open the VM's settings, select the hard drive under the SCSI controller, then choose \"Edit\" then \"Expand\").\nNext, you need to tell Ubuntu to rescan the block device, in this case sda:\n# echo 1 > /sys/block/sda/device/rescan\nNext, run parted and choose p for print. It should recognize that the partition table isn't using the full space and ask whether you want to fix it, so choose Fix at this point.\n# parted /dev/sda\nGNU Parted 3.2\nUsing /dev/sda\nWelcome to GNU Parted! Type 'help' to view a list of commands.\n(parted) p\nWarning: Not all of the space available to /dev/sda appears to be used, you can fix the GPT to use all of the space (an\nextra 69206016 blocks) or continue with the current setting?\nFix/Ignore?

While still in parted, enter the resizepart command to accomplish this. In my case, since I'm expanding sda3 I tell it to resize partition 3 to 100% of available space. Again, adjust the command for your setup.\n(parted) resizepart 3 100%\n(parted) p\nModel: Msft Virtual Disk (scsi)\nDisk /dev/sda: 172GB\nSector size (logical/physical): 512B/4096B\nPartition Table: gpt\nDisk Flags:\n\nNumber  Start   End     Size    File system  Name  Flags\n 1      1049kB  538MB   537MB   fat32              boot, esp\n 2      538MB   1612MB  1074MB  ext4\n 3      1612MB  172GB   170GB\n\n(parted) quit\n\nType quit to exit parted.\nIf you're using LVM, you now need to tell it to expand the physical volume. pvs shows the info on your physical volumes; use pvresize to expand it. With no parameters given, it will use all available space.\n# pvs\n  PV         VG        Fmt  Attr PSize    PFree\n  /dev/sda3  ubuntu-vg lvm2 a--  <125.50g    0\n# pvresize /dev/sda3\n  Physical volume \"/dev/sda3\" changed\n  1 physical volume(s) resized / 0 physical volume(s) not resized\n# pvs\n  PV         VG        Fmt  Attr PSize    PFree\n  /dev/sda3  ubuntu-vg lvm2 a--  <158.50g 33.00g\n\nNow, you need to expand the logical volume, as well as the filesystem itself. lvextend with the -r switch will do both at once, assuming you're using a filesystem it knows about such as ext3/4.\n# lvs\n  LV        VG        Attr       LSize    Pool Origin Data%  Meta%  Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert\n  ubuntu-lv ubuntu-vg -wi-ao---- <125.50g\n\n# lvextend -l +100%FREE -r /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv\n  Size of logical volume ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv changed from <125.50 GiB (32127 extents) to <158.50 GiB (40575 extents).\n  Logical volume ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv successfully resized.\nresize2fs 1.44.1 (24-Mar-2018)\nFilesystem at /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv is mounted on /; on-line resizing required\nold_desc_blocks = 16, new_desc_blocks = 20\nThe filesystem on /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv is now 41548800 (4k) blocks long.\n\nThat's it!

A simple resize2fs /dev/sda3 will tell the filesystem to use all available space on the newly-increased partition.\nThis article on Teknophiles has some more details on this process along with screenshots of the Hyper-V tools.

You need to free up disk space before you can do anything else. Try to free up at least a gigabyte.\nPart of your problem is the large number of old kernels that have built up. Each one could be responsible for 200-300 MB.\nThe command is:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nby itself. Don't try anything else at the same time.\nBe aware of 2 things:\n\n\n*\n\n*You might need to free some disk space before doing the autoremove. It may need some free temp space in order to proceed.\n\n*Removing that many kernels in one shot will take a very long time. Be sure you have the time to let it run without needing to interrupt it.\n\n\nA: You were right. The /boot partition is at 100%, however I can't autoremove because it still says there is unmet dependencies.

The approach of Windows 10 is getting close and I am curious as to whether the upgrade will screw up my dual boot of Windows 8 and Ubuntu?  Should I just wait until it comes out? \n\nA: It shouldn't screw your your dual boot, but in my case it did. However, I was able to restore everything without data loss.\nMy report about it can be found here (look down at the comments)\nHere is a copy/paste of my issues\nLet me write about some of problems to help other people who might encounter the same issues.\nMy computer came with Windows 8 pre-installed so I shrunk the Windows partition to make room for Ubuntu. That it how it works for the last year.\nAfter the second reboot in Windows 10 upgrade the computer did not boot any more. The grub only displayed a grub rescue command prompt. I found out later that the problem occurred because windows somehow changed the partition scheme. The boot partition was no longer where grub expected it. I don't know how and why this happened.\nFirst what you can do is to see the partitions in grub rescue with \"ls\". Mine were (hd0,gpt1), (hd0,gpt2), etc. Try to find out which partition is your boot partition. I tried the following commands until i found the right partition:\nls (hd0,gpt1)/\n\nls (hd0,gpt1)/boot\n\nls (hd0,gpt2)/\n\netc.\nThen type set in grub rescue prompt. It will display where the grub looks for its files. In my case (hd0,gpt6) has moved to (hd0,gpt7). The set command displayed:\nprefix=(hd0,gpt6)/boot/grub\n\nroot=hd0,gpt6\n\nChange the prefix and root settings to point to the right partition. In my case commands were:\nset prefix=(hd0,gpt7)/boot/grub\n\nset root=(hd0,gpt7)\n\nThen switch from rescue to normal mode:\ninsmod normal\n\nnormal\n\nYou should get the normal grub menu. From now on you can boot Windows and finish your Windows upgrade. The problem is that you have to tell grub rescue about the right partitions on every reboot. That is how I did it. I left the problem of grub for later because I was not sure whether Windows will do some more changes to the partitions or boot.\nWhen Windows finished I started to solve grub problems. Press \"e\" to edit boot options for Ubuntu. I changed all (hd0,gpt6) to (hd0,gpt7) and Ubuntu booted. However, I use encrypted partition and cryptswap. At the boot Ubuntu asked me for the passphrase. Fortunately I saved it at the installation of Ubuntu and entered it at the boot. Ubuntu booted without problems. I corrected the /boot/grub/grub.cfg where I replaced (hd0,gpt6) with (hd0,gpt7) and performed sudo grub-install.\nNow it was only the encryption. Since the root Ubuntu partition was raised for one (7 from 6), the swap partition suffered a similar change. I had to change the /etc/crypttab file to point to /dev/sda8 instead of /dev/sda7.\nI am using only two partitions for Ubuntu (root and swap). If other operating systems coexisting with windows use more partitions there might be more changes required. Especially if partitions are mounted according to their numbers and not by their UUIDs. Take a look at your /etc/fstab. If the partitions are identified by UUID there should be no problems. But if there are /dev/... lines the number should be corrected if they were changed.\n", "Q: How to open image in client via SSH I am using client as a display laptop.

Generally people run a live or memory resident distro for this.\nThings will be a little different depending upon UEFI bios being in use.\nIf you have UEFI bios, you will have a half gig FAT partition. You can see these with parted or even gparted from a live distro.\nIn any case, using a distro usb or cd, get into \"rescue a broken system\".\nYou want to use the rescue disk's kernel and \"pivot root\" to run your broken system.

I'm deploying AMD64 nodes with a 3TB first disk with MAAS but I only get a 2TB partition because curtin uses MBR instead of GPT for the partitioning.\n\nA: Curtin tries to choose the most appropriate partition table type for a given node:\n\n\n*\n\n*For systems that are booting in BIOS mode, it defaults to an MBR-stored DOS partition table\n\n*For systems that are booting in UEFI mode (including ARMv8-based UEFI-enabled systems like Cavium Thunder and APM X-Gene) it defaults to a GPT partition table\nTherefore, the easiest way to get a GPT partition table is to configure the node to boot in UEFI mode, which is supported starting with MAAS 1.5.\nThere are two additional ways to get curtin to create GPT partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can modify the curtin configuration provided by MAAS to curtin in /etc/maas/preseeds/curtin_userdata to include:\nblock-meta:\n    format: gpt\n\n\n*If you have up to 4 partitions, you can easily convert DOS partition tables to GPT partitions post-installation. Curtin makes an effort to leave enough space in the partitioning to allow the conversion to successfully happen, and from r224 onwards it ensures it. Converting can be done with:\nsgdisk --mbrtogpt <device>\n\n\nA: I have tried a number of workarounds (including the one suggested in kiko's solution) to no avail.\nThe following works pretty reliably, at least with MAAS 2.3.5 running on Xenial:\n\n\n*\n\n*Commission the node and partition its disk as you would normally (eg: using the web UI) but stop before deploying the node.\n\n*Run the following cmd-line query: maas $USER block-devices read $nodeid ($nodeid can be read from the URL on the web UI for example; it's an internal six alphanum identifier for the node)\n\n*Grab the block device id.  You'll see that partition_table_type doggedly says \"MBR\"\n\n*Now sign-on to MAAS' Postgres DB: sudo -u postgres psql -d maasdb\n\n*Update the partitioning scheme to GPT, update maasserver_partitiontable set table_type='GPT' where block_device_id=$block_dev_id (substitute `$block_dev_id with the id you read at step 3)\n\n*Optionally repeat the query from step 2 and check that the partition_table_type has been updated to GPT.\n\n*Deploy the node and enjoy your GPT partition table.\n\n\nThis isn't particularly pretty as hacking directly in MAAS' DB feels a bit off-limits but it's the next best thing until we get given a way to do this through a public API.  The kind of API I have in mind would be smth like: maas $USER block-device update $node_id $block_device_id partition_table_type=GPT.  This API already exists and allows updating the name of the block device as documented, but ignores the much more useful partition_table_type attribute.\nNote: if you need to leave unpartitioned space on the GPT target disk, beware that this procedure appears to trigger a \"feature\" whereby that space gets absorbed by the last partition you lay out in MAAS.  A workaround is to create a throw-away partition and delete it after deployment.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 : cannot boot afer upgrade I have a dual boot windows 8.1 / ubuntu on a Dell XPS13 with UEFI secure boot enabled.\nYesterday, i just upgraded to the latest ubuntu (apt-get upgrade) and when i rebooted i got a message saying that the new boot image was invalid. I tried to disabled secure boot.\nNow, when I select ubuntu in the UEFI boot list, it hangs for a few seconds and then it boots in windows. How can i repair this ?\n\nA: It could be your copy of GRUB is damaged. I have two suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Boot Repair from an emergency disk to re-install GRUB.\n\n*Use my rEFInd boot manager (the USB flash drive or CD-R version) to boot to your regular system. You can then either do a sudo grub-install /dev/sda or install the rEFInd PPA or Debian package for a permanent solution.\n\n\nNote that the second option will work only if Secure Boot really is disabled. It sounds like you're not 100% certain that it's disabled, and in fact, that is another possibility -- if an update installed an improperly-signed Shim, or if your firmware is finicky about its Secure Boot signatures, it could be that your system doesn't like an updated Shim. In this case, going back into the firmware and disabling Secure Boot is the proper solution, at least in the short term. I show several examples of how to disable Secure Boot on this page of mine, if you need some examples. (Unfortunately, the user interfaces for doing this are not standardized.)\n", "Q: Dropbox won't start on ubuntu 14.04; overwrites autostart entry I noticed recently that my dropbox was no longer running on startup (the icon no longer appeared in the tray at top right, and nothing was syncing.)\nIn Startup Applications, dropbox is selected, with command dropbox start -i.  Based on Dropbox doesn't autostart in 12.04 I changed the command to sh -c  ~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd.  This works:  if I restart my machine, the dropbox daemon starts running, the usual icon appears up in the tray, and files sync correctly.\nHowever, when I go look at Startup Applications (after the change and restart described above), the command has reverted to dropbox start -i!  That means dropbox will not work next time I restart.  Why does it do that and how can I fix it?\nI'm on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, with dropbox version 3.6.7.\nEdit, was too long as a comment:\n@Jacob I haven't been able to get this to work.  I'm having trouble with \"In Startup Applications (Dash > Startup Applications) remove the Dropbox entry (but not the newly created start_dropbox.desktop).\"  The newly created start_dropbox.desktop does not appear in Startup Applications, but there's a Dropbox entry with the dropbox logo, whose command is /bin/bash -c \"sleep 10&&dropbox start -i\" -- seems to be reading the newly created start_dropbox.desktop.  The original dropbox.desktop no longer present in ~/.config/autostart.  Dropox does not start on reboot:  it does ask for my password, but it doesn't actually start running.\nEdit, got this to work by following @Jakob's suggestion, with a twist:\n$ ls .config/autostart/\nstart_dropbox.desktop  start_dropbox.desktop~\n$ cat .config/autostart/start_dropbox.desktop\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Dropbox\nGenericName=File Synchronizer\nComment=Sync your files across computers and to the web\nExec=sh -c ~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nIcon=dropbox\nCategories=Network;FileTransfer;\nStartupNotify=false\nX-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true\n$ \n\nNote the Exec=sh -c ~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd line. This is similar to the setup I had when I asked the question, but now the Exec line doesn't get overwritten on reboot.\n\nA: Although the cause is most likely the same as here, I posted an almost similar answer, since both the question and the symptoms are different:\nDropbox timing issues in 14.04\nIn some cases, in 14.04 Dropbox has some timing issues, and the command to startup Dropbox syncing starts too early and breaks for some reason. It seems to be a bug, because starting Dropbox manually fixes it temporarily, but only until the next restart. To fix it permanently, we need to edit and rename the dropbox.desktop file in ~/.config/autostart/\nThe fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*rename the file ~/.config/autostart/dropbox.desktop into: start_dropbox.desktop\n[You need to rename it because Dropbox overwrites the file dropbox.desktop on every startup]\n\n*Open the (renamed) file with gedit (drag it over an open gedit window).\n\n*Replace the line, starting with Exec=, change it into:\nExec=/bin/bash -c \"sleep 10&&dropbox start -i\"\n\nThis delays the startup of Dropbox with 10 seconds after log-in, which does the trick.\n\n*in Dropbox preferences, untick \"Start Dropbox on startup\" (else we would have two .desktop files representing Dropbox in the autostart folder):\n\n\n*In Startup Applications (Dash > Startup Applications) remove the Dropbox entry (but not the newly created start_dropbox.desktop).\n\n\n*In the folder ~/.config/autostart, remove the original dropbox.desktop if it is still there.\n\n\nNow on restart, it should run fine.\nExplanation\nThe bug seems to be related to the timing of the Dropbox startup. The workaround above replaces the \"real\" Dropbox starter with one that delays the startup 10 seconds, until the desktop is ready.\n\nA: I installed dropbox, I didn't make any change and everything works correctly...\nTry to remove it with dpkg -P dropbox and reinstall the last .deb package from the web page\n", "Q: VLC playlists don't work after restarting ubuntu I've saved playlists after assigning songs to them from the library.

Report a feature request on https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpadlib.\nFinding all PPAs owned by a user with a given name\nThis is possible, use launchpad.people['username'].ppas, full example:\npython\n>>> from launchpadlib.launchpad import Launchpad\n>>> launchpad = Launchpad.login_anonymously('just testing', 'production', '/home/user/tmp')\n>>> [ ppa.name for ppa in launchpad.people['mvo'].ppas ]\n[u'apt-clone-lucid', u'apt-fix-633967', u'apt-ftparchive-arch', u'apt-ftparchive-lucid', u'apt-ftparchive-srccache-backport', u'apt-gcc5', u'apt-https-fix', u'apt-lucid-chris', u'apt-precise', u'apt-src-ftparchive', u'apt-vivid', u'auto-upgrade-tester', u'debsigs-trusty', u'eglibc-trusty', u'freeglut-multiarch', u'gir-multiarch', u'hwe-eol', u'linux-firmware-nonfree', u'lp1347721', u'lp1371058', u'lucid-precise-upgrades', u'lucid-precise-upgrades2', u'oem', u'openoffice', u'ppa', u'public-test', u'python-apt', u'release-upgrader-apt', u'samba4', u'sdk', u'smem', u'synaptic', u'test-dependencies', u'ubuntu-sdk-libs', u'unattended-upgrades', u'upgrade-tests', u'wine', u'wsmancli']\n\nYou might think that you can combine this with searching people, but it will not work. There is a limit on how many people you can get (I think it is 50 or something like that).\nThe entire API is documented here: https://launchpad.net/+apidoc/1.0.html\n", "Q: How to change subpixel layout from default RGB in Infinality? I have Infinality patches installed, however fonts look not so good. Using subpixel layout detection page at lagom.nl I discovered that my monitor has BGR layout, but Infinality uses default RGB.\nHow can I configure Infinality to use BGR subpixel font rendering?\n\nA: You need to change setting called rgba from rgb to bgr.\n<fontconfig>\n  <match target=\"font\">\n    <edit name=\"rgba\" mode=\"assign\">\n      <const>bgr</const> <!-- here -->\n    </edit>\n  </match>\n</fontconfig>\n\nI'm on Arch, and for me it was in /usr/share/fontconfig/conf.avail.infinality/10-base-rendering.conf. On your system it might be different, just grep for rgba in all *.conf files. A reboot/X restart might also be required.\nEDIT\nI just realized that a package upgrade might revert this back to the default. So the right location for this is etc/fonts/local.conf, you can create it if it doesn't exist.\n", "Q: Nautilus - Open with Sublime - Open in new window In Nautilus on Ubuntu Desktop 14.04, when I choose \"open with\" and then select \"Sublime\", the document will always open in any existing instance you have open. If I use the CLI and call subl --new-window [path to file] then I get the desired behaviour. \nHow can I add the --new-window argument to the call that nautilus is executing to open with Sublime?\n\nA: The easiest is just to edit sublime's .desktop & add the -n option to the Exec= line. This works well when one has disabled sublime's default of remembering the last session. \nTo do so just run sudo nano /usr/share/applications/sublime-text.desktop & add -n to the Exec= line so it looks like - \nExec=/opt/sublime_text/sublime_text -n %F\nAlso to note - on some systems sublime will cause cursor run on when used from the context menu. If that's the case while the .desktop is open to edit scroll down to the StartupNotify=true line & make it StartupNotify=false. This will prevent cursor run on..\n(- for those not used to nano  - after editing go -\nctrl+o\npress enter key on keyboard\nctrl+x\n\nA: It is a simple question but a tricky one to answer. I haven't used Sublime myself but problem is similar with Gedit as well. If you prefer you can use Nautilus actions to add a context-menu item. Install it through Software center.\nIf you want to create Nautilus script you will have to use $@ characters as substitution of environment variable NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS:\n#!/bin/bash\nfor i in \"$@\"; do \n    gedit --new-window \"$i\" & xdotool search --sync --onlyvisible --name \"$i\" windowactivate\ndone\nexit 0\n\nThe -xdotool here is to raise windows because they all runs in the background but you can alter the behavior the way you are familiar with, spread them around or just live it alone the way it is.\n", "Q: MAAS - Import PXE files - Not a gzipped file?

Ubuntu has been installed (and it's the only OS), but didn't boot.\nI have been through common hints and finally came to a conclusion that there might by a problem with my firmware which I am unable to resolve.\nThis is the story so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot-repair complained about GPT. From reading this forum I concluded that since I want to use UEFI, this option does not apply to me. Here is the log, however:\n\n\nboot-repair info http://paste.ubuntu.com/11842457/\n\n\n*Tried to add EFI entry manually. Did not work. The entry vanished after reboot\n\n*Read Roderick Smith's advice on creating a EFI entry manually using his rEFInd. I made a bootable USB, booted into shell and in the mapping table it displayed only a file system fs0 which is the USB itself. HDD is not present so I can't create an EFI since, frankly, shimx64.efi is not there. Really disappointing. How is that supposed to work at all?\nI have spent days trying to figure out what to do. I really lack a simple and comprehensible guide on how to get Ubuntu working.\nUPDATES\nThe EFI partition should contain a directory /EFI/ubuntu with four files: grub.cfg, grubx64.efi, MokManager.efi and shimx64.efi\nHow can I check that? I've mounted my EFI partition and ls'd it. It was empty.\nFollowing Rod's advice, dmesg results are here\nI think, I need to say that this laptop had preinstalled Windows 8 and so firmware might have been configured in a specific way. I decided to install Ubuntu after old HHD's death and switching to a new one.\nAfter a fix via gdisk, Ubuntu finally appeared in rEFInd. I see file systems listed in shell other than the USB disk's one. However, I can't ls fs1 which is the EFI partition even though it was displayed as the shell started. Nor can I find shimx64.efi anywhere. Tried to boot Ubuntu from options available in rEFInd. There were two options: \n\n\n*\n\n*vmlinuz-3.16.0-43-generic which resulted in unable to mount root fs on unknown block(0,0)\n\n*vmlinuz-3.16.0-43-generic.efi.signed with the same result\n\n\nScreenshot\nTrying to create a EFI entry bcfg boot add 4 fs1:\\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi \"Ubuntu\" failed obviously. fs1 is my EFI partition.\nAnother bad thing to notice: list of available partitions after that kernel fail is empty.\nIf I remove the USB with rEFInd, still no boot device is present.  \nHere is bootinfo: http://paste.ubuntu.com/11850314/\nThanks for the answers. Especially to Rod Smith.\n\nA: I have had the same problem, and you have to do this from then terminal:\n      sudo apt-get install linux-amd64_ linux-efi\n      sudo apt-get update\n      sudo apt-get upgrade\n      sudo apt-get install -f\n      sudo apt-get install aptitude\n      sudo aptitude linux-efi\n\nand it might work fine this way.\n\nA: Given your configuration, rEFInd and the EFI shell should be showing you both the ESP and the Linux partition. (This assumes that the rEFInd USB drive is configured with the ext4fs driver, which the rEFInd USB images I distribute are.) Thus, my suspicion is that there's something wrong with your hard disk. Try sudo sgdisk -v /dev/sda (changing /dev/sda to your hard disk's identifier) in an Ubuntu emergency disk. This will test the partition table for errors. If you see any, report back or read my GPT fdisk documentation on repairing GPT disks.\nIf there are no GPT problems, try dmesg > dmesg.txt from an emergency disk and post the output to a pastebin site. That output may provide a clue about why your disk is not visible to the firmware.\n\nEDIT: It looks to me as if rEFInd can't find an initial RAM disk (initrd) to match your kernel. Just to be clear, are you launching those kernels from rEFInd or from an EFI shell? I ask because the two filenames you gave (vmlinuz-3.16.0-43-generic and vmlinuz-3.16.0-43-generic.efi.signed) are identical except for the .efi.signed extension, and rEFInd includes code to keep only .efi.signed kernels if both are present, so it's odd that both would show up in the rEFInd menu. (OTOH, if you've mis-typed and the kernels vary in their version numbers, then it's perfectly understandable that there'd be two, one with and one without that extension.)\nYou could look for an initrd file using a live Ubuntu disk, and check what (if any) initrd= option rEFInd is passing to the kernel by hitting F2 or Insert twice when you launch the kernel. This procedure will open a text editor that shows the options the kernel is passed, and also enable you to edit those options.\nAt this point, though, it might be easier to re-install Ubuntu. Unless I misunderstand, this is a fresh installation, so you've got no valuable user data on the system. With the active 0xEE protective partition now inactive, a fresh installation is likely to correct whatever additional problem you've been having.\n\nA: So my suspicion about emptiness of the EFI partition was not without reason. Ubuntu has not been installed fully because laptop went down due to overheating.\nI reinstalled it and it seems to be booting now.\n", "Q: Mount external hard drive with LUKS Encryption + LVM I recently switched to a bigger Hard Drive by running dd if=/dev/old of=/dev/new\nHowever now I am trying to get some files that changed after copying, so I connected the old Hard Drive over USB.\nThe structure of my Main Drive looks like this (the external one does look exactly the same, just smaller in capacity):\nsda                            8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk  \n├─sda1                         8:1    0   512M  0 part  /boot\n├─sda2                         8:2    0   256M  0 part  \n├─sda3                         8:3    0   256M  0 part  \n├─sda4                         8:4    0     1K  0 part  \n└─sda5                         8:5    0 930.5G  0 part  \n  └─sda5_crypt (dm-0)        252:0    0 930.5G  0 crypt \n    ├─vg-swap (dm-1)         252:1    0     8G  0 lvm   [SWAP]\n    ├─vg-ubuntu--root (dm-2) 252:2    0   330G  0 lvm   /\n    ├─vg-kali--root (dm-3)   252:3    0    30G  0 lvm   \n\nI can sucessfully decrypt using luksOpen, but can't get LVM to recognise the Partitions.\nNeither vgscan --mknodes nor vgchange -ay do something.\nvchange output:\nsudo vgchange -ay\n  Found duplicate PV hb5SMvxs2GfCaHwCkLAUn1IXCm9gABCD: using /dev/mapper/sdb5_crypt not /dev/mapper/sda5_crypt\n  4 logical volume(s) in volume group \"vg\" now active\n\nSo it looks like there's a name collision because the Partition UUID is the same due to copying with dd.\nIs there any way around this that allows me to access the Data?

The database name of /etc/nsswitch.conf involved here is hosts. There are also many other databases understood by libc e.g. passwd, protocols etc.\nThe databases are mentioned at the start of the line followed by the name of the sources to be queried. For example the required configuration for hosts database (used for finding IP address of a host) can take the form :\nhosts:          files mdns4 dns\n\n\n\n*\n\n*files indicates that at first the relevant configuration files in /etc directory to be queried first, hence /etc/hosts is queried first\n\n*Then mDNS (Multi-cast DNS) is used up to check if the IP can be retrieved\n\n*Then DNS i.e. the name servers are queried for the IP address.\nAs your /etc/nsswitch configuration file does not contain anything, i would suggest you to put the default entries to the file :\npasswd:         compat\ngroup:          compat\nshadow:         compat\n\nhosts: files mdns4 mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns\n\nnetworks:       files\n\nprotocols:      db files\nservices:       db files\nethers:         db files\nrpc:            db files\n\nnetgroup:       nis\n\nCheck man 5 nsswitch.conf to get more idea.\n", "Q: XFCE: Hiding an application from the taskbar I am running Xubuntu 14.04.2 and running the standard window manager with the default window buttons applet through xfce4-panel.

The same applies to Devilspie2. \nSetup requirement\nEnsure that 'skip' property is not handled by the window manager. This is required in Xfce, but may be unnecessary in other desktop environments.\nIn Xfce, go to Settings Manager > Window Manager Tweaks > Cycling and look for this option Skip windows that have \"skip pager\" or \"skip taskbar\" properties set and disable the option (checkbox is empty). If the option remain enabled (checkbox is filled), the application will be hidden entirely altogether, which will give a \"false result\" as explained in my original answer.\nUsing Devil's Pie\nFor example, to hide Xfce4 Dictionary application window from the taskbar.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a text editor and type the following.\n(if (is (application_name) \"xfce4-dict\") (skip_tasklist))\n\n\n*Save as $HOME/.devilspie/hide.ds (the filename can be anything, but must have .ds extension).\n\n*Run devilspie in Terminal.\nIn step 1, an alternative is to use (window_name) \"Dictionary\" that will match the text that appears in titlebar. But some applications will change the text according to the content, so using (application_name) is preferred instead.\nUsing Devilspie2\nThe same example is adapted for using Devilspie2. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open a text editor and type the following.\nif (get_application_name()==\"xfce4-dict\") then\n   set_skip_tasklist(true);\nend\n\n\n*Save as $HOME/.config/devilspie2/skip.lua (the filename can be anything, but must have .lua extension).\n\n*Run devilspie2 in Terminal.\nWhich one: Devil's Pie or Devilspie2\nUse either one, whichever user prefers. Devil's Pie and Devilspie2 have similar features however, each scripting is different and incompatible to each other. Devilspie2 looks for LUA scripts and the rules of the original Devil's Pie are not supported.\n\n\n*\n\n*Both are available in universe repository of any supported releases of Ubuntu, according to this Ubuntu Packages search result.\n\n*Both have -d option for verbose output, which will print debug information. Devilspie2 has several more options, such as option to specify folder to look for scripts outside the default path $HOME/.config/devilspie2.\n\n*Both have been tested working in Xubuntu 14.04 (Xfce 4.10), with respect to the question asked by the original poster in 2015.\nDevelopment status: This GNOME Wiki noted that Devil's Pie isn't really maintained and similarly the developer site noted version 0.22 was the last version updated in late 2007. This changelog on Launchpad noted that new maintainer is handling Devil's Pie from version 0.22-2.\n\nA: The fastest and easiest way to remove from taskbar a particular window is to use the special string :SELECT: in wmctrl:\nwmctrl -r :SELECT: -b add,skip_taskbar\n\n...now you will only have to click on the window that you want to hide.\nIf you need to return this window to the taskbar, use\nwmctrl -r :SELECT: -b remove,skip_taskbar\n\n\nSourses:\n\n\n*\n\n*Muehe answer is helped me\n\n*wmctrl -h\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.04 remastering boot option \"text\" I remastered an Ubuntu 14.04 ISO.

I am wanting to file a bug report against Ubuntu in general, because I have noticed that the Ubuntu security hashes provided, are only MD5sums, and as for security reasons MD5 is being phased out, it seems ridiculous to have only MD5sums listed there, if the main reason for checking them is security reasons. It would be far better to use SHA256, or at least to give both, as the problems noticed in MD5, have not been noticed as present in SHA256.\nAnyway, I want to complain about this, so I am wanting to file a pug report, but not sure exactly how to do this, because ideally I would file it against Ubuntu generally here, but if I click on the report bug button I just get redirected to this page, which just tells me to use apport, but in apport it doesn't let you not selected a specific package, so I am really lost on how I am going to file this report, and where I am going to file it...\nSo I thought that I should ask a question about it here, so, how and where do I file this report? Or complain in some way?\n\nA: There is a link to the appropriate bugs page right there on the wiki page. Just click on the link, and then on the resulting Ubuntu-docs bugs page click on the \"Report a bug\" link in the upper right corner of the page. You should end up here. You will need to have a launchpad account.\nNote that there is controversy over that particular wiki page because it falls under the purview the Ubuntu-docs group, but that group is not the master of the checksums.\nEDIT: By the way, there is already a bug report.

In fact, swapping should be avoided in a system as possible...\nOn the other hand, in your case, it seems that you don't have a swap partition.

I update the kernel whenever a new version becomes available and routinely use dist-upgrade over apt-get upgrade. What updates or features am I missing out on by not using a rolling release?\n\nA: This depends a lot on the distribution in question. For Ubuntu, the upgrades are governed by the Stable Release Updates policy. It's a long page, but I'll just quote section 2:\n\n2. When\nStable release updates will, in general, only be issued in order to\n  fix high-impact bugs. Examples of such bugs include:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Bugs which may, under realistic circumstances, directly cause a security vulnerability. These are done by the security team and are documented at SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures.\n  \n*Bugs which represent severe regressions from the previous release of Ubuntu. This includes packages which are totally unusable,\n  like being uninstallable or crashing on startup.\n  \n*Bugs which may, under realistic circumstances, directly cause a loss of user data\n  \n*Bugs which do not fit under above categories, but (1) have an obviously safe patch and (2) affect an application rather than\n  critical infrastructure packages (like X.org or the kernel).\n  \n*For Long Term Support releases we regularly want to enable new hardware. Such changes are appropriate provided that we can ensure not\n  to affect upgrades on existing hardware. For example, modaliases of\n  newly introduced drivers must not overlap with previously shipped\n  drivers.\n  \n*New versions of commercial software in the Canonical partner archive.\n  \n*FTBFS (Fails To Build From Source) can also be considered. Please note that in main the release process ensures that there\n  are no binaries which are not built from a current source. Usually\n  those bugs should only be SRUed in conjunction with another bug fix.\n  \n  \n  For new upstream versions of packages which provide new features, but\n  don't fix critical bugs, a backport should be requested instead.\n\nExceptions like the kernel are documented in the section on Special Cases.\n", "Q: Is it possible to see old notifications?

I just bought Lenovo S850 smartphone and it contains only the executable file for windows OS in order to connect the phone with the computer. Any advice? Thanks!\n\nA: I assume you just want to connect the phone to your computer to browse its contents. Typically the file system will be mounted just by connecting the phone to the PC using a cable provided with your charger. For both Windows and Ubuntu no executable is needed to do this as all android devices that I know of are plug in and play, if not the Drivers are automatically installed upon connecting, Perhaps the executable is some sort of useless bloatware that Lenovo wants you to install? \nAnother possible reason you device may not be accessible is that MTP is disabled in your settings.

Doing sysctl default did not fix it, fsck would flash shortly with scanning progress msg and then same prompt would come up. Here is what worked:\nfsck -y /dev/sda1\nreboot\n\n\nA: I just had the case with Emergency mode. In my situation I followed an installation tutorial which suggested to edit some of the options for my mount points in /etc/fstab . By removing the extra options, my server rebooted without problems.\n\nA: Similar to some of the other answers, the trick for me was to comment out an entry in /etc/fstab for my optional LVM partition.  I don't know why it started to complain a few days ago that Ubuntu 17.10 could no longer find the LVM partition, nor why this was causing the system to boot into \"emergency\" mode.\nOnce the entry was commented out in /etc/fstab, I rebooted successfully to my desktop.  Looking at some tutorials, I noticed I was missing some LVM commands, so I ran sudo apt-get install lvm2 which seems to have fixed the problem.\nIf like me you think your LVM partition is the cause of the issue, the full set of commands I ran was:\nsudo lvmdiskscan\nsudo apt-get install lvm2\nsudo lvmdiskscan\nsudo lvdisplay\nsudo vi /etc/fstab\nsudo vgchange -a y\nsudo mount -a\n\nNot sure if all these are necessary -- I suspect that apt-get install lvm2 was key to getting my system to boot again.\n\nA: I am using Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.X dual boot system. \nI was not able to mount one of ntfs the partitions and the error was related to windows shutdown/hibernate. \nI used sudo ntfsfix /dev/sda3 to fix the issue. \nI was able to mount ntfs partition sda3 but on restart Ubuntu was starting in emergency mode.\nTo fix this issue, run the following command in windows\nshutdown /s /t 5\n\nThis fixes Ubuntu emergency start issue.\n\nA: The answers by Khushboo Rani and Cagan Arslan led me to the permanent solution.\nWindows 10 has a feature called fast boot enabled by default which, when the user shuts down normally using the \"shut down\" button or the power button on the computer, will actually save the running kernel and some other system stuff to the hard drive similar to hibernation after logging off. It also causes Windows to \"lock\" the partition in some way while doing this to prevent corruption of the data, accidental or malicious. This means Ubuntu cannot mount the Windows partition during startup.\nIn my case, I have entries for the Windows partition in /etc/fstab, so this made Ubuntu unbootable.\nThe solution is to boot into Windows, disable \"fast boot\", and then shut down normally. Now the problem should be solved permanently!\nFrom the link I shared earlier, disable fast boot while in Windows as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the control panel\n\n*Go to the \"Hardware and Sound\" settings\n\n*Go to \"Power Options\"\n\n*Click \"Choose what the power buttons do\"\n\n*Click \"Change settings that are currently unavailable\" and grant UAC access.\n\n*Clear the checkbox by the \"Turn on fast startup (recommended)\" setting\n\n\nA: So there are many good answers here - just to add to the info, my issue was a mistake in spelling tmpfs as tempfs which is incorrect in a line I added to /etc/fstab to secure a server\n\nA: I had same problem , after running command fsck it was recovering but after some time my computer was going in emergency mode again so i removed whole data from my Hard disk and installed new OS.\nIt solved my problem. \nI think so problem was with Ubuntu 15.0 vivid version so i installed 14.0 version. Still yet there is no problem.\n\nA: I had the same issue. \nCommented manually added ntfs partitions from /etc/fstab\nSystem started normally.\nUsed ntfsfix command to fix the journaling problem caused to those ntfs partitions\nEg: Sudo ntfsfix /Dev/ntfs partition\nMounted again in /etc/fstab\nReboot\n\nA: I just had the same issue and in my case, I had just recreated my grub partition and therefore it had a differente UUID than the last grub partition I had. When I booted ubuntu, the system wouldn't be able to check the UUID. To fix this problem I did:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\nThen comment out the line containing the UUID from the partition I had just modified.\nthen reboot to apply changes.\n\nA: All the above answers did not help me, as I didn't have a recovery file for fstab.\nWhat did the trick was (in emergency mode)\ncat /proc/mounts > /etc/fstab\n\n\nA: I also came across same error showing (/dev/xyz) VFS: cant find ext4 filesystem.\nI was not even having root user password for login.\nSo I following following steps to solve it,\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into a Ubuntu Live DVD/USB (Press F11 to select quick book option)\n\n*Recover root password using this method Reset root password for Ubuntu 16.04\n\n*Check file system status using following commands,\ndf -h\nlsblk --fs --ascii \nlsblk -l;\nfdisk -l;\n\n\n*Remove umount /dev/xyz volume and fix it using fsck / xfs_repair as per File system type.\numount /dev/sdb1\nfsck -y /dev/xyz\n\n\n*\n\n*In my case mount point was missing but fstab was having entry for it. So I created same mount point again and updated fstab entry using following commands.\n\n\nsudo mkdir -p /mnt/abc\nsudo mount /dev/xyz /mnt/abc\nvim /etc/fstab\nUUID=xxxxxxxxxx-eeee-rrrrr-807a-xxxxxxxxxx /mnt/abc        xfs    rw,noatime        0       2\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Then just reboot system.\n\n\nsudo systemctl reboot\nIt worked for me.\n\nA: In my case, I added a partition of a usb drive in /etc/fstab. when I booted with the usb drive removed, the error occurrd\nall I needed to solve the issue is to remove the line about the usb drive. i know that you have resolved ur issue but this may be helpful for other people :)\n", "Q: Formatted my windows drive by mistake and now windows installation cannot find drives I formatted my laptop's Windows loader partition (ext4) while installing Ubuntu 15.04, and when I tried reinstalling Windows, it can't find any drives.\nI already formatted the Linux drive into NTFS with gparted,\nand I have another NTFS partition in my computer, yet still, my Windows 8 setup cannot find a single parition for me to install it on.\nPS: The Linux installation failed with \nExecuting 'grub-install /dev/sda' failed.\nthis is a fatal error\n\nand now I can't do anything.\n\nA: If you have no data on the hdd (which seems to be the case) do the following.

I have a old netbook  acer aspire one ZG5 which has 512MB DDR2 fixed on the mother board and one slot for second device of RAM which I suppose the max amount of ram added is 1GB! \nCan I upgrade this ram to 4GB DDR2? or not?\nI know that I can't do that because the chipset supports only 2GB of RAM, is it true? \nWhen I run demidecode -t 16 the output shows maximum capacity=4GB what's wrong? why this output shows max ram of 4GB?\n\nA: From the (few) sources available (such as this one at Engadget: http://www.engadget.com/products/acer/aspire/one/zg5/specs/), it would seem that the RAM controller chip in your netbook is capable of using only 2 RAM slots, each with up to 1 GBytes. \nSince you already have 512 MBytes in one of the slots (soldered to the motherboard), following this reasoning you can only put in 1 GByte extra RAM in the other slot, giving the 1.5 GBytes total given in the reference above.\nThis being said, if you have a spare 2 GBytes DDR2 bar available, I would try it out and take it from there. The only thing I can see that would damage the RAM would be excess clock, but the Acer seems quite low in this respect.\nUnfortunately, 4 GBytes seems impossible on this machine.\nHope this helps.\nPS: if you find Ubuntu is a tad slow on this computer, it may also be due to the graphics card. A desktop with lower requirements such as LXDE, XFCE or Mate would probably help speed things up. \n", "Q: Why am I loosing keyboard control in Remmina? I am taking an online course that requires me to log in to a remote Windows server, and I am doing so using Remmina Remote Desktop Client.

You need to unmount partitions if you are working from a live system.\nIf you sda is the drive you wish to partition, type:\n\nsudo fdisk /dev/sda\n\nYou will enter the fdisk program. If you type m you'll get help on commands that you can use\n\nEnter p to list the current partition table\n\nEnter n to create a new partition. You'll be asked whether to create a logical or primary partition. Hit l for logical or p for primary. Note that a disk can only have four primary partitions (if using MBR). Next, enter the partition number you want to assign to this new partition.\nNext, specify the sector of the disk you want the partition to start at. Press Enter to accept the default sector, which is the first free sector on the disk. Then select the last sector of the partition you want. eg: if you type +100G, it will create a new 100GB partition.\n\nHit t and then 7 to create a HPFS/NTFS/exFAT partition (you can type l to list out all hex codes corresponding to different partition types)\n\nEnter w to write the changes and exit.\nNow you you need to format new partitions with a file system before you can use them. So,\n\nsudo mkfs.ntfs /dev/sdaX\n\nReplace X with the partition number you entered while creating partition. \nTo mount it (to a mount point, say, /mnt/ntfs) you can use:\n\nmount -t ntfs /dev/sdaX /mnt/ntfs\n\n", "Q: How to remove ubuntu touch webapps from app store Does anyone know how to remove an app I've published for Ubuntu Touch from the app store?\nIt is no longer useful to have it there.\n\nA: Is there not an option to delete your app on Ubuntu MyApps?\n\nA: In https://myapps.developer.ubuntu.com/dev/click-apps/ you can click the app in question, and in the left column, under the app logo, you can find an orange button to 'unpublish' it.\nUsers that already downloaded it, still have access to it and can redownload it in the app store, though, so that's maybe why you yourself can still see it there...\n", "Q: Adding a suffix at the end of each shell command Is it possible to automatically add some characters at the end of each command typed in the terminal.\nFor example, if I write\nsudo apt-get update\n\nthe shell will execute\nsudo apt-get update && notify-send Done\n\nwithout me writing the && notify-send Done part.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: If you're using bash as your default shell, you can set PROMPT_COMMAND.\nFrom the bash man page:\nPROMPT_COMMAND\nIf set, the value is executed as a command prior to issuing each primary prompt.\n\nSo just paste the following line in your .bashrc to get a notification for each command:\nPROMPT_COMMAND=\"notify-send Done\"\n\nSo each time your bash prompt is called (normal behavior when a command is finished, with success or not), you'll get a notification.\nNote: you'll be also notified if you press just Enter as the prompt will be displayed again.\n\nA: You can bind some characters to to an enter key:\n$ bind '\"\\C-M\":\" && echo test\\n\"'\n\nThis has some drawbacks, for example if you just press Enter:\n-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `&&'\n\nYou can block this effect by terminating your lines with # character - it will turn appended text into a harmless comment.\nStill I'd say that this sounds like a really bad idea.\n", "Q: What is PARTUUID?

It would be great if someone can help here.\nIf there is anything I need to do with hardware, I may try if someone can guide how to check any configurations.\nThanks\n\nA: How much ram do you have? \nRunning the trial \"live session\" to \"try\" ubuntu requires a certain amount of RAM and so does the installation. \nIf you don't have much ram, you should run the following command to see if swappiness is in use:\nsudo swapon -s\n\nif nothing is listed, you can mount your swap partition to enable swappiness during the installation process so that you don't run out of RAM in the middle of the installation.\nFirst, run the following command to identify your existing swap partition:\nlsblk\n\nThen, run this next command to identify the UUID of the swap partition:\nblkid\n\nNow that you have identified the location of the swap partition as well as the UUID, you can run the following command to enable swappiness to use your swap partition. For example:\nsudo swapon -U 123456-sbcd789012-987654321\n\nYou will need to replace \"123456-sbcd789012-987654321\" with the actual UUID obtained earlier. I used that number as an example, of course.\nIf you can't sign into Ubuntu to get to a terminal, you should be able to press CTRL + ALT + F2 where you should be able to run the commands from a text session there. If you cannot access a text session on F2, you can try F1, F3, F4, F5, or F6; any one of these will do fine.\nTo return to the graphical normal ubuntu interface, use CTRL + ALT + F7 or sometimes CTRL + ALT + F8 and quite rarely sometimes CTRL + ALT + F2 or CTRL + ALT + F1 on newer versions of ubuntu using systemd.\nIf all that still fails, you should maybe look into installing using the mini.iso media.

All of the computers are using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. On two of the three computers, everything works fine, but on the third I encounter a problem.\nUsing ifconfig eth0 192.168.9.3, I set a static IP address. By typing ifconfig, I can verify that the IP address is setup, and pinging the address from another computer works. However, after a short amount of time (<20s), using ifconfig shows that the IP address that I had set earlier is no longer associated with eth0 -- it has disappeared!\nI then altered the network interfaces file to establish the exact network made using ifconfig in an attempt to make the setup permanent; this didn't work either, and the setup was ignored or reset. What would cause this behavior?\nLikely this problem is very basic, but I have been struggling with it for some time, and any pointers or advice would be appreciated.    \nUpdate: I tried reverting all of the files back to their original states. I also poked around with the network manager, and tried setting the IP addresses with that, which worked. It seems that there is some sort of conflict between the different tools used to setup networks graphically versus in the command line, but I still don't understand why, so my original question still stands!  \n\nA: Ifconfig changes are temporary. They are erased when networking is restarted.\nPermanent changes are stored in /etc/networking/interfaces from the command line or through network manager.\n\nA: Network Manager is the GUI utility at fault. The purpose of network manager is to handle networking automatically so that the user doesn't have to think about it. To do this, network manager automatically switches between networks. While this utility is great for some applications and basic computer usage, when a strictly defined network is necessary, and the user wants to specify that network at the command line, Network Manager has an adverse effect.\nWhen the network is specified in network interfaces, Network Manager overrides the setup automatically, using instead its own configuration. Likewise, when ifconfig is used, Network Manager sees a change and automatically switches the network configuration back to its own configuration. This is frustrating for users with specific goals in mind.\nThere are two options for getting past this frustration. The first is to set up the desired network configuration using Network Manager. The GUI is an obvious way of doing this, but it may not be possible for some situations. In situations where the GUI is not desired, Network Manager can be set via the command line with nmcli, which is an textual interface for Network Manager.\nThe second option is to disable Network Manager with the following commands:\n\nsudo stop network-manager\necho \"manual\" | sudo tee /etc/init/network-manager.override\n\nThe first command stops Network Manager, and the second command prevents Network Manager from running on startup. After executing these commands, network interfaces or ifconfig can be used without having Network Manager override the configuration.\n", "Q: firefox libva (VDPAU backend) crash I see this problem recurring over and over browsing the web.

Will the update from the windows environment affect negatively, in terms of compatibility, linux drivers, grub etc ?\nOr the whole idea is \"unsafe\" and may cause system crush ?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: If you successfully update the BIOS, result will be the same what ever way you choose, just follow the instructions. Don't worry and upgrade it from Windows. BIOS is loaded before operating system and it is an independent software.\nAbout the compatibility, if you made any changes from default BIOS setup, you should make notes, so you can make the same changes after new BIOS is loaded. It is hard to say what could happen, usually BIOS upgrade will make unnoticeable changes, but in rare cases, some devices may change their behavior, in that case, you can always load previous version of BIOS, so make notes of your current version just to make sure.\n", "Q: What is `$?` ? Is it a variable? The question is pretty straight forward. I can get the exit code of the previous command by using $?. But what exactly is it?\nI don't think it is a variable, because you can't have any special characters in the name of variable other than _.\nfoo?foo=10\n\nwill result in the error: foo?foo=10: command not found\nSo if it is not a variable, what is it? Are there others like it?\n\nA: $? is a special variable in bash that always holds the return/exit code of the last executed command.\nYou can view it in a terminal by running echo $?.\nReturn codes are in the range [0; 255].\nA return code of 0 usually means everything is ok.\nOther values indicate errors. Most applications return 1 or custom values.\nIf a command was not found, the variable usually contains 127\nIf you want to set this variable to a specific value, you can easily do this with bash -c \"exit 5\" to return for example the return code 5.\n\nA: $? is a special shell parameter (variable).\nIn general all user defined variables must be named by using only the characters from character class [:alnum:] i.e. [a-zA-Z0-9_] (also can't begin with [0-9]).\nIn a nutshell, $? is a special variable (and there are quite a few of these) that can be considered as internal feature of the shell itself that provides the exit code of the previous command (whether succeded or failed). \nYou can read this to get more idea on variables.\n\nA: What is it?\n$? is a built-in variable that stores the exit status of a command, function, or the script itself. \n$? reads the exit status of the last command executed. After a function returns, $? gives the exit status of the last command executed in the function. This is Bash's way of giving functions a \"return value.\" It returns 0 on success or an integer in the range 1 - 255 on error.\nAre there others like it too?\nYes,there are several such built-in variables in bash. You can see a list here. \nRefer:\n http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exit-status.html\n\nA: $? is a variable but a special one, that's why special characters are allowed.\n($?) Expands to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline. \nIt's not the only one, the shell treats several parameters specially.

Does it affect me? Apparently a new bug has been discovered in OpenSSL, it is being called as Alternative chains certificate forgery (CVE-2015-1793).\nCanonical already declared the versions of openssl that are not affected with currently supported releases.\nI am using version 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.8 of openssl (can be found with apt-cache policy openssl) in 14.04 but accoding to Canonical the not-affected version for 14.04 is 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.15. But there is no such version available in the repository (Why not yet?).\nMy questions are :\n\n\n*\n\n*Does that mean i am vulnerable to CVE-2015-1793 ?\n\n*And obviously what exactly is CVE-2015-1793 ? How can it affect me ?\n\nA: Please note:\nThis latest vulnerability (CVE-2015-1793) was introduced in a recent update to OpenSSL package (as maintained by OpenSSL.org).\nOpenSSL's latest advisory: https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20150709.txt\nThis should not affect a standard Ubuntu install.\n\nfrom: ComputerWorld >> OpenSSL fixes serious flaw (Jul 9, 2015)\n\".. the OpenSSL packages distributed with some Linux distributions -- including Red Hat, Debian and Ubuntu -- are not affected. That's because Linux distributions typically backport security fixes into their packages instead of completely updating them to new versions.\".\n\nNote: You may still be affected, if you are using the OpenSSL package (or source) directly from OpenSSL.org.\n\nA: No, you are not vulnerable to CVE-2015-1793, but you are likely vulnerable to several other bugs. The latest version from the Ubuntu Security Team version is in the trusty-updates and trusty-security repositories as expected (see the Security Team FAQ) and the CVE tracker says that it isn't affected. If you can't see this version yet, check:\n\n\n*\n\n*if you have enabled trusty-security and trusty-updates repositories\n\n*if your mirror (if not an official one) has fallen behind in syncing (check Launchpad)\n\n*if you have the security.ubuntu.com repository enabled (it's enabled by default)\n\n\nThe last point is important. Since security.ubuntu.com is an alias for the main repository, and it is enabled by default for the -security channel, you should always have access to any security fixes published by Ubuntu. For example:\n$ apt-cache policy openssl      \nopenssl:\n  Installed: 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.11\n  Candidate: 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.15\n  Version table:\n     1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.15 0\n        500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ trusty-security/main amd64 Packages\n *** 1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.11 0\n        500 http://mirror.cse.iitk.ac.in/ubuntu/ trusty-security/main amd64 Packages\n        500 http://mirror.cse.iitk.ac.in/ubuntu/ trusty-updates/main amd64 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n     1.0.1f-1ubuntu2 0\n        500 http://mirror.cse.iitk.ac.in/ubuntu/ trusty/main amd64 Packages\n\n", "Q: How is Snappy Ubuntu Core faster than Ubuntu While many questions answer what is Snappy Core, I've yet to see an answer of how Snappy is faster (as claimed here) than traditional package management in Ubuntu. I get that rolling back and stuff but how is it FASTER? (in terms of infrastructure) Please use layman's terms so that I can understand\n\nA: A standard Ubuntu or Debian system is built out of many debian packages.  This allows you to pick and choose which ones you want installed on your system, but it means when you upgrade, each one has to be upgraded individually, unpacking files, and replacing the existing ones, then running scripts to make any needed modifications to the system to ensure the upgrade goes smoothly.  With snappy, it is more like an android system: you get one big system rom file that is just written to a partition on the disk, and this rom file already contains all of the packages, already installed, but with the database of what packages are installed stripped out.\nDownloading and writing one big file directly to a partition on the disk is much faster than downloading many individual package files, unpacking each into the many files they contain, then running the installation scripts.  In fact, when upgrading, the download part doesn't even have to download the whole file; it only needs to download the differences between the new rom and the one you already have.\n", "Q: CUDA : Driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime When running the CUDA example /usr/local/cuda/samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery$ with the sudo ./deviceQuery command, the output was :\n ./deviceQuery Starting...\n CUDA Device Query (Runtime API) version (CUDART static linking)\ncudaGetDeviceCount returned 35\n-> CUDA driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime version\nResult = FAIL\n\n\nOn using the lspci -v | grep -i command I get :\nNVIDIA Corporation GF117M [GeForce 610M/710M/820M / GT 620M/625M/630M/720M] (rev a1)\n\n\nThe lshw -c video command gives : \nPCI (sysfs)  \n\n\n  *-display               \n       description: VGA compatible controller\n       product: Haswell-ULT Integrated Graphics Controller\n       vendor: Intel Corporation\n       physical id: 2\n       bus info: pci@0000:00:02.0\n       version: 0b\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: vga_controller bus_master cap_list rom\n       configuration: driver=i915 latency=0\n       resources: irq:63 memory:b5000000-b53fffff memory:c0000000-cfffffff     ioport:6000(size=64)\n  *-display\n       description: 3D controller\n       product: GF117M [GeForce 610M/710M/820M / GT 620M/625M/630M/720M]\n       vendor: NVIDIA Corporation\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:09:00.0\n       version: a1\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: bus_master cap_list\n       configuration: driver=nouveau latency=0\n       resources: irq:62 memory:b3000000-b3ffffff memory:a0000000-afffffff memory:b0000000-b1ffffff ioport:3000(size=128)\n\n\nSo might it be that CUDA doesn't work because the i915 driver is in play instead of the nvidia one ?\nIf so how do I get this working ?\n\nThe last guide I followed to install the nvidia drivers really messed up my system and it needed a reinstall, please suggest a guide that works well for Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: You appear to be using a laptop. Usually, after the Nvidia drivers are installed, the Intel GPU is used by default to conserve power. However, you can run any program with the Nvidia GPU by running it with optirun:\noptirun ./deviceQuery\n\nor\nsudo optirun ./deviceQuery\n\nthough I don't think you'd need sudo for CUDA samples\nEdit: As pointed out by Pilot6, optirun is available through the bumblebee package in Ubuntu.

Its good fun and I get a kick out of this type of thing. I have a few questions regarding kernel compilation.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I always compile the latest stable kernel and use it, or does Ubuntu have to be tweaked by developers to use newer kernels ?\n\n*When a new kernel has new features, do said new features just magically work or does Ubuntu have to be tweaked by developers to utilise new features.\n\n*As a purely academic question, does compiling the kernel on the actual machine running linux, tweaking the config for cpu type and selectively stripping out support for non present hardware, unwanted file systems etc produce performance gains (even if in reality one just would not notice).\nThanks.\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, you can. Especially if you compile the latest Ubuntu kernel. ;-)\nYou can also use mainline kernels in Ubuntu. But you do not have to build them. They are already built in Ubuntu Mainline PPA. You can always redo it in educational purposes.\n\n*New kernel with new features will \"magically\" work in Ubuntu.\n\n*Compiling a custom kernel with removing unneeded modules can improve boot time slightly, but will not improve performance.\nIn general Ubuntu patches in most cases just backport bug fixes and support of new hardware from latest kernels. They are not specific to Ubuntu distribution in 99% of cases. \nIt is fun building kernels, but it has no practical value if you do not modify the source. I have to build kernels in some cases, but I always try my best to get my patches applied upstream to let me avoid this sad task.\n", "Q: BASH: boolean statement unexpected behavior when checking for whether a directory exists I have to get some files from a device and store them in a directory with a particular name. I'm writing a script that does this, but one of the first things it does is it checks if the directory with the wanted name already exists.\nThe device version is what determines the name of the directory, but the formatting is off. From my device I get the following number: NUM=10-2-2\nI have to reformat it to 10.2.2, so I use NUM=$(echo $NUM | tr \"-\" \".\")\nThis is the name of a directory. The full path, then, would be /var/www/myServer/10.2.2.\nHowever, the following code:\nFilepath=/var/www/myServer/$NUM\nif [ -d $Filepath ]; then\n   echo the directory exists\nelse\n    echo the directory does not exist\nfi\n\nalways tells me the directory does not exist. But if I declare the variable Filepath directly (i.e. Filepath=/var/www/myServer/10.2.2) I get the desired result. Why does this happen?\nThe output of the tr command is as follows:\n~$ <command-that-gets-version-number> | tr \"-\" \".\"\n10.2.2\n\nWhy does this happen? Any ideas at all would be helpful. \nI am running this on Ubuntu 11.x\n\nA: Found my problem. The result from the <command-that-gets-version-number> | tr \"-\" \".\" line was leaving a carriage return character at the end. I noticed this because when I executed: ~$ printf %s \"$NUM\" | od -t x1 the output showed the last character was 0d, which is carriage return.\n", "Q: How to fix CA cert issues with Curl in Ubuntu 14.04? I am using Ubuntu 14.04. When I use curl, I get the following error:\ncurl: (77) error setting certificate verify locations: CAfile: /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt CApath: \nFrom what I gather from googling, the CAfile location it is looking for is not correct for Ubuntu (and it doesn't exist on my computer), /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt is the proper location. \nMost of the solutions involved setting the environment variable CURL_CA_BUNDLE to the proper location, or adding cacert=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt to the (newly created) .curlrc file in my home directory. I have tried both, and neither completely solve the issue.  curl is finding this location, but it still doesn't work, giving the error:\ncurl: (60) SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain\nI also tried uninstalling and reinstalling curl in Ubuntu, and updating my CA certs with $ sudo update-ca-certificates --fresh which updated the certs, but still didn't make error 60 go away.\nI am not that knowledgeable about CA certs, and doubt I purposely added some self signed certificate in the past. Perhaps by accident, I don't know.\nDoes anyone know how to fix this?  Is there a way to actually start fresh with all my certs? Or does anyone even know how I go about figuring out where this self signed certificate is, and then how to remove it?\nPS: I don't want to use the -k (aka --insecure) flag. I want to get this working securely.\n\nA: After researching for a few times I got it to work, and the answer ended up being rather a simple one.\nOpen terminal ctrl+alt+t and change working directory:\n cd /etc/ssl/certs/\n\nDownload pem file in the certs folder\n sudo wget https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem \n\nNow open the file .curlrc\nnano ~/.curlrc \n\nAdd the below lines in the open file\ncapath=/etc/ssl/certs/\ncacert=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\n\nNow save the file and do your things using curl command.\nN.B Here I used nano editor, but you can use any editor.\n\nA: After researching and working on this over the last couple days I got it to work, and the answer ended up being rather simple.\nI needed to set capath=/etc/ssl/certs/in my .curlrc file.\nThis got curl working on the command line. To further get curl to work in R (where I first encountered the problem) I also needed to have cacert=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt in my .curlrc file as tried before, otherwise it continued to look for /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt\nI still have no idea why I was seeing the error about self-signed certificates.\nBased on some other random findings I also downloaded a certificate from the Curl website with:\nsudo wget https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem\n\ninto the same certs directory. Having cafile pointed at this worked as well. In the end I put it back to ca-certificates.crt and it still works.\nI don't understand exactly why this worked or what is going on, but it is resolved.\n\nA: cafile key does not work for me (curl 7.45.0) but cacert (from --cacert option) does.\nMy .curlrc file:\ncapath=/etc/ssl/certs/\ncacert=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\n\n\nA: We faced same problem with one of our C++ programs in Ubuntu 14.04.5. The .curlrc method was not taking effect.\nThis was solved by downloading the ca-certificates.crt to /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt and creating a symbolic link ca-bundle.crt under /etc/pki/tls/certs/ directory.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Here's an alternative way to bypass it:\necho insecure >> ~/.curlrc\n\n\nA: This works for me. Just making a symbolic link ln -s /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt\n", "Q: Binding Mouse Movement To Keyboard Keys I have a little Blue Gaming Mouse (Don't remember the name) and I've been searching everywhere to find an answer, so here it is.\nI would like to bind Mouse movement to Keyboard keys.

I wiped the system drive and installed Lubuntu but I left the other 2 drives NTFS.  Directories on them were mounted as shares using cifs on the other machines in our LAN and all was well.\nIn an attempt to improve performance, I saved all the data, wiped one of the data drives and formatted it ext4, then copied the data back (I used an ext4 formatted external drive to do this). \nEver since then it's been a big pain to use because I keep running into permission problems.  I did not change the fstab entry for the drive at all except for the new UUID and file system type.  But I am constantly encountering 'visible only to owner', 'unable to copy file' etc permission problems.  Meanwhile the NTFS formatted drive hums away with no problems at all.\nOne visible difference is that when I create folders on the share, their icons have a lock on top of them.  This does not happen on the NTFS share.\nIs there a way to globally fix these annoying permission problems and get back to the smooth operations I had when the drive was formatted NTFS?\nEdit w/ additional info:\nMy fstab entry for the drive on the machine it's physically in is UUID=89e88c2b-d720-465a-95ad-f74705885127 /media/Win-F ext4 defaults 0 0 \nOn the client machine the fstab entry is\n//192.168.1.2/ST8\\040F\\040Drive /media/ST8-F-Drive cifs credentials=/home/bill/.sharelogin,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777,nobootwait 0 0\n\n\nA: This happens because ext4 is a native filesystem for Linux which supports ACL's while NTFS is not a native filesystem for Linux and as such does not support the ACL's but it does support access rights that can be defined in for example the fstab file. So to solve the problem you need to make sure that you're a member of a group that has sufficient access rights to the ext4 file system.\nThis command will help you to overcome the access problems of the existing files: chmod -R 777 /media/your mount. Change /media/your mount according to your needs.\n", "Q: How do I solve a \"server version mismatch\" with pg_dump when I need BOTH PostgreSQL servers installed? I installed two PostgreSQL servers in my computer. One is 9.1 and the other is 9.3. I need both servers installed.\nWhen I run pg_dump, however, I get a version mismatch error:\nserver version: 9.3.6; pg_dump version: 9.1.15\npg_dump: aborting because of server version mismatch\n\nHow can I solve it? (Cannot uninstall either version - I installed the 9.1 first and the 9.3 many months later - I need both database servers installed).\n\nA: If you're running docker, you can run any version of pg_dump without having to manage multiple installations.  This will write a file to /path/to/dump/to/myfilename.dump using postgres 12.5:\ndocker run --rm --network=host -v \"/path/to/dump/to:/tmp/dump\" \\\n  postgres:12.5 pg_dump -Fc -v --dbname=\"my_db_bame\" -f \"/tmp/dump/myfilename.dump\"\n\n\n*\n\n*--rm removes the container when the command is done\n\n*--network=host connects the container to the host local network\n\n*-v ... mounts your host directory (/path/to/dump/to) to a temp directory inside the container\n\nYou just have to make sure that the directory you mount to (/tmp/dump) is the same as the directory that pg_dump is writing to.\nThen you can change 12.5 to whatever version you want.\n\nA: TL;DR: if both PostgreSQL instances are managed by the Ubuntu packages (as they should), just use the --cluster option to select the PostgreSQL instance to backup, and it will automatically choose the corresponding version of pg_dump:\npg_dump --cluster 9.1/main [other pg_dump options]\nor\npg_dump --cluster 9.3/main [other pg_dump options].\nmain is just a default value, run pg_lsclusters to see your actual names in the Cluster column.\nHow it works: as installed by the Ubuntu packages, /usr/bin/pg_dump is actually a soft-link to /usr/share/postgresql-common/pg_wrapper, whose purpose is precisely to select the correct instance and run the corresponding binary. --cluster does not exist in the stock PostgreSQL commands, it's a Debian/Ubuntu addition that is meant to address this multiple versions/multiple paths problem.\nThis is the same for psql, createdb, createuser, etc. about 18 postgres commands in /usr/bin are actually managed by pg_wrapper.\nSee man pg_wrapper for more.\n\nA: You can use:\nsudo find / -name pg_dump\n\nto find your versions of pg_dump in my case: /usr/pgsql-9.6/bin/pg_dump\nso next we can do:\nsudo ln -sfn /usr/pgsql-9.6/bin/pg_dump /usr/bin/pg_dump\n\nin order to update to the one we need\n", "Q: Firefox doesn't start I am on ubuntu 14.04, and when I try to launch firefox 38.0 it won't start up and I get this message:\nYour Firefox profile cannot be loaded.

You can also add custom repositories and run and apt-get install or update to fetch \"custom\" packages. Some devices have repositories for their drivers. For example, for the D-Link DWA-131 adapter (How to install a wireless adapter D-Link DWA-131?)\n$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:hanipouspilot/rtlwifi\n$ sudo apt-get update --> makes your apt aware of the packages in the new repo\n$ sudo apt-get install rtl8192eu-dkms\nBy Source/Files\n\n\n*You have a source of some kind, such as your example directory. In there you will either find some sort of ... .sh install script, OR you'll need to compile and run some sort of C/C++ make and install commands. \nWHY - you're compiling/making the code to run the device on YOUR specific device; if you're doing this there won't be a pre-built install script or command. HOW - (1) ./configure OR make, (2) make install (from inside the scripts directory you were in).\n\n\n\nA couple important notes though:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your adapter must be an Ubunut/Linux supported adapter. You can check https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported and in the docs/online for supported adapter lists.\n\n*If you're running make-install commands, you're Ubuntu must have a gcc/g++ compiler installed and the executables (e.g., gcc) available on the exectuable path. apt-get update and apt-get upgrade will probably include this, but you can also run sudo apt-get install g++ O=(or gcc).\n\n\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Is an Ubuntu server the best option for me? I am currently tasked with the process of creating a file server for a small business I work at. My boss is keen on the fact that we can create an Ubuntu server for free and has put the task to me. I really don't have much knowledge of Linux and have everyone in the office uses Windows as their OS. \nBasically what the question I am asking is if Ubuntu is a good choice for a small business server, where all of the users in the office have Windows operating systems. We already have a server in the office that uses Windows server 2008, so everyone can connect to that easily just by mapping network drives. My fear however is that if we switch to an Linux server, connecting to the server wont be as easy as it is with a windows server, as apparently the only way to do this is with PuTTy. Can anybody help weigh in on what I should do?\nEdit: The Linux server will eventually replace the windows server once we have migrated all the files across. The linux server will have RAID 5 for better data security and will have more space available that the current windows server. It will eventually be used as web server too once everything is running smoothly, however our first priority is to get it working and connected locally. \n\nA: I do not advise. if you are not familiar with Ubuntu you will have a hell of a time trying to diagnose issues. I am a tech and I use Linux and Ubuntu server and I will not use Ubuntu as a file server just because of diagnostic issues.. ( i am a novice user) if i were a pro, that would be a different story.. tell your boss that the risk will not be worth the reward.\nI can think of so many situations I've had with clients that Ubuntu would not be able to solve.\n\nA: The old saying \"Linux is free if your time has no value\" applies here. Unless you already know it well, the answer is basically no. It starts to pay dividends as your business grows or to the extent you have knowledgeable people around, particularly if you're a tech business. For a small business where you want your computer system to mostly do a few simple things without much difficulty, it's asking for trouble. \n\nA: I know this is the \"askUbuntu\" forum, but I must say after working with both linux and FreeNAS, that you will have a much easier time managing your storage with FreeNAS ( http://freenas.org ) . It looks just like network appliance rather than a server, but it is 100% server.\nIf you want to do it right, you need to read the FAQ about hardware, etc. It is a software raid that needs a lot of memory. The performance is great, though. Also, by default, it uses redundancy that will tolerate 2 disk failures (like raid 6).\nThe nice thing about it is that all of your control is through a web interface and you need not learn any unix or linux. It will also serve out multiple protocols like iscsi, rsync, nfs, ftp, cifs (windows share).\nFor example, I was running out of free disk space. All I had to do was point my browser at the server, log in, and change the quota on the share. I went from 3.2 Tb to 5 Tb in 2 seconds.\n\nA: It took me around 50 hours probably to get comfortable with Ubuntu Server, but I am a techie, but I loved it once I got into it. Windows Server = $$$$, ask for a bonus or raise etc and help keep the money inside the company!\nPS: Windows can easily access linux via protocols such as SAMBA (CIFS), WebDav (Look up Owncloud) and Win 7 Ult and Win 8.1 Enterprise have NFS mount abilities.\nSAMBA is only usable internally on the LAN, so for remote access need VPN, OpenVPN is good solution, and OPEN SOURCE AND FREE!\nWebDav is great for remote access for windows as it has built in support, A simple .cmd file in startup folder can map WebDav Directorys to a drive letter on startup, great for sending to employee's who are not technically inclined.\nThe biggest reason I would maybe go Windows is Email, I have yet to successfully get email on my server as it requires multiple programs to be configured to work together where windows will be much easier in that sense.\n\nA: \nMy fear however is that if we switch to an Linux server, connecting to the server wont be as easy as it is with a windows server, as apparently the only way to do this is with PuTTy\n\nSamba fixes that for you.\nUbuntu server using it as a file server is rather easy: all you need to do is install the file-server task. It will install all you need (sudo apt-get install tasksel, start it with tasksel and pick \"samba file server\".\nAll the rest is configuration and that can be done with a how-to or by searching AskUbuntu. This is a how-to on Samba: it is 1 config file you need to setup. \nIf you are willing to learn about maintaining a Linux file server: go for it. \n\nA: Generally, CentOS would be the distribution typically used in enterprise and business environments.\nhttps://www.centos.org/\nHowever, if you still plan on using Ubuntu, Ubuntu Server would be the lightest coming out of the box, and should be the one you use. \nIf you absolutely need a GUI, then you can either install the Gnome Desktop Environment with apt-get install gnome-desktop-environment, or simply use the Desktop version of Ubuntu; and use the Package Manager to install and configure the Samba service to let your Windows machines mount to it.\n", "Q: Ubuntu touch – executable files won't launch in /home directory I just received a Meizu MX4 and have already started hacking away at it.\nOne problem I have run into involves not having permission to run executable scripts and files located in the home directory.\nI understand that this is probably a security feature.

Now i could do nothing but to report them and hope them can be fixed. The question is where to report them?\n\nA: Ubuntu Avengers is a page with handy links for bug filing.\n It contains bug report links and preferred bug report forms for Apps, Scopes, Indicators, Toolkit / Platform, and Web Services.\nFrom How to report bugs:\n\nPlease DO NOT file bugs at the \"ubuntu-touch-preview\" project. This\n  project is no longer monitored, bugs should be filed in the individual\n  affected packages. Include the steps to reproduce, an automated\n  testcase (if possible) and the frequency of the bug.\nGenerally, please try to do your best to make sure you put enough\n  information so we can track the hardware and build, for example give\n  \"mako #120\" in the subject to indicate you're using a Nexus 4 and\n  image #120. You can find out what image you're running in System\n  Settings -> About.\nHowever, if you have bugs which concern the image tools\n  (ubuntu-device-flash), bug tracking is open and bugs are welcome; go\n  to https://bugs.launchpad.net/phablet-tools/+filebug to open a new\n  bug.\nIf you want to help out with reporting or triaging bugs, that's great.\n  Ask on IRC or the mailing list if you're unsure. We've got to work all\n  together on this to make Ubuntu for Phones & Tablets truly rock!\n\nYou can also file bugs on device:\n\nTo file a bug directly on the device use the \"ubuntu-bug\" program,\n  specifying the package which you'd like to report against. e.g.\n adb shell \n    ubuntu-bug unity8\n\nThe above is the preferred method for filing bugs directly on the\n  device. If for some reason you are unable to run ubuntu-bug on the\n  phone, you can manually file a bug using the links given in Avengers. You can also\n  find existing bugs via those links.\n\nIn addition, You can also join the IRC channel #ubuntu-touch on irc.freenode.net where you can get help and discus about anything.\n", "Q: Keyboard Shortcuts not working in Ubuntu 14.04 I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS in 2015/10/5 alongside windows 8.

It will overwrite Ubuntu.\nThe installer may ask if you want to overwrite the entire drive - including all partitions - to install Windows.  If it asks this, this is what you want.\nFurther help with Windows installation is outside the scope of this site.\n\nA: You have to boot from a USB stick or a CD and then reformat your hard drive.\nI suggest booting a live Linux, then run\nfdisk /dev/sdx \n\nwhere sdx is your hard drive.\nYou can use o to create a new dos partition table and then w to write it to the disk. Windows should be able to do the rest on installation.\nIf you want to delete it safely, you can use\n dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdx \n\nwhich will fill your drive with random data.

This will also have the effect of removing any other BIOS-mode boot options from the menu (at least for your internal disk), so if you're dual-booting Windows, this option may be undesirable.\n\n*In refind.conf, use the dont_scan_volumes option, and specify any unique subset of the description you want to remove, such as dont_scan_volumes \"whole disk\", assuming no other entry you care about includes the string \"whole disk\".\n\n*Using a Linux emergency disk, wipe GRUB from the MBR of the hard disk by doing something like sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=440 count=1. This command is potentially quite dangerous! If you get any of the options wrong, you could seriously damage your partition table or even permanently destroy data on your hard disk. This command should take a fraction of a second to execute. Also, you must NOT issue the equivalent of this command in OS X, since OS X's version of dd doesn't let you specify partial-sector block sizes (bs=440).\n\n\nIf you opt to edit refind.conf, you must locate it. If your rEFInd installation is an old one or if you used the option to install it to your OS X root (/) partition, it will be /EFI/refind/refind.conf. If your rEFInd installation is newer, it's more likely to be in that directory on your ESP, which you'll need to mount:\nmkdir /Volumes/ESP\nsudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 /Volumes/ESP\n\nrefind.conf will then probably be at /Volumes/ESP/EFI/refind/refind.conf.\n", "Q: how can I take total minutes from time?

Thank you all for the help so far, I think I'm stuck trying to edit or create a proper xorg.conf file that will give me a consistent display on start up. \nI have two identical monitors - Samsung S20D300, Ubuntu 14.04, 4GB RAM, Intel E5300@ 2.60GHz, Nvidia GeForce 8400 GS w/ VGA and DVI-D outputs - 1 monitor connected to each\nIn Nvidia XServer settings utility, one monitor shows as \"Samsung S20D300(CRT-1)\" (connected to VGA) the other as \"CRT-0\" (connected to DVI-D w/ proper VGA to DVI-\"D\" adapter) Same setup worked fine in Win8.1.\nSettings and resolution on the Samsung, are fine, 1366x768, the \"CRT-0\" is only showing at 1360x768, with lower options available. The 1360 monitor is to the right of the 1366 (main) monitor and the left edge of the 1360 is not visible w/ a black bar on the right side.\nI have tried the X.Org Nouveau driver, same thing, using the onboard card + the Nvidia is also out. Installed various legacy and current Nvidia drivers, same.\nUsing xrandr I was able to force the screen to the right into 1366 and correct position but this of course did not survive reboot. I think I can edit the xorg.conf file but I cannot find exactly how to do that.\nAny - all direction, help, questions and suggestions will be very, very much appreciated. Thank you!\n\nA: *\n\n*Double check that they are actually identical. Look at the product ID and dates and similar things. I had a case at work where two monitors we thought were identical didn't support identical sets of resolutions, and I discovered that they weren't identical. One was a slightly modified version released a couple months later. They had the same model number and had been sold as if they were the same product, but were not.\n\n*Get your hands on an actual DVI cable. Sometimes adapters do funny things. You say it's a \"proper adapter.\" I have no idea what that means (what's an improper adapter?). I do know that I've used adapters which were supposed to convert one cable to another type and did not, whereas the system worked fine with the correct cable. DVI cables shouldn't be expensive. Where I live, you can often find them being thrown away by people moving to HDMI and DP, although that may not be relevant to you.\n\n*Try switching the ports the two monitors are plugged into. Presumably, you expect the problem to occur on whichever monitor is plugged into the DVI, but maybe that monitor is broken or something.\n\nA: It's possible that something (the adapter? the use of dvi?) is preventing X from discovering the properties of your monitor, which is why it isn't showing up by name.\nSomething you could try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get xrandr.\n\n*Run xrandr to dump out your monitor settings. Presumably, the two will show up differently. (If not, the problem is elsewhere, and easy to fix.)\n\n*Read through all of the horribly complicated documentation relating to adding custom modelines for displays. There are some references in man xrandr, although you'll probably have to do a bit of googling to.\n\n*For the undiscovered monitor, add a custom modeline identical to the modeline you're using for the good monitor (normally this could be dangerous because if you tell the monitor to refresh faster than it actually can, it could break parts of it, but that shouldn't be possible here).\n\n*Try to start the monitor with the higher resolution you want using xrandr (you'll have to read more docs, obviously). If this works, you'll in principle be able to make both monitors work how you like using a more convenient interface (i'd say try arandr); this is just diagnostic.\n", "Q: How to resize this ubuntu partition?

I'm using PlayOnLinux on Ubuntu 14.04 and I installed successfully IE with this tool but I tried to install Flash many times without success (from https://helpx.adobe.com/fr/flash-player/kb/archived-flash-player-versions.html).\nUsing PlayOnLinux is very user-friendly but I concede that Wine is very obscure for me ...

It's like the prerequisites (-p) option except that it'll follow every link on the domain and download all the pages on the site (that are linked in). If you only need files on one page, -p is enough.\nIf you're planning on mirroring the pages you can use the -k option to fix links. This is completely optional and isn't necessary if you're only after assets.\nOne problem I've had while doing this is some sites use a robots.txt file to stop Google (et al) copying or caching their assets. wget normally adheres to this too but we can turn it off. It's worth doing this as a matter of course.\nPut it all together and you end up with something like this:\nwget -mke robots=off http://website\n\n\nA: Video Download helper is your easiest option:\n\n\n*\n\n*Video DownloadHelper :: Add-ons for Firefox\n\nwget is a bit trickier.

I clicked on \"Refresh Firefox\" button, also I restarted with addons disabled, also I reinstalled Firefox but none of that helps. Crashes are random, after 5-6 minutes of browsing.\nYou can see crash reports here: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1071421\nEDIT: I installed developer edition of Firefox and no crashes so far\n\nA: After many attempts, I have a fix for this. The problem lies with Firefox version 39 and the Flash plugin. Either the Adobe or the Pepper flash.\nWhat I have done is totally delete the flash plugins, install the Pepper flash, and download Firefox 39 from Mozilla, and overwrite Firefox 39, which came from the Ubuntu repositories.\nThe very first thing is to delete all Adobe flash installations\ndpkg-query -l | egrep 'flash|fresh'\n\nNow delete these with the purge option, using the file names returned from the dpkg-query command:\ndpkg --purge <file_names>\n\nNow you can install the pepperflash from webupd8:\nsudo apt-get install pepperflashplugin-nonfree\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install freshplayerplugin\n\nNow you will need to download the latest version of Firefox from Mozilla, as the version from Ubuntu seems to have issues. First step is to backup, for just in case something breaks:\nsudo tar -cvPpf ~/Firefox-backup.tar /usr/lib/firefox*\nsudo wget -P /usr/lib/firefox https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/firefox/releases/39.0/linux-x86_64/en-US/firefox-39.0.tar.bz2\nsudo tar -C /usr/lib/ -jxvf /usr/lib/firefox/firefox-39.0.tar.bz2\n\nNow you should be able to start Firefox and watch video without the constant crashes.\n\nA: I have just updated from the trusty repositories with absolutely no problems. \nWith this type of problem, in the first place I would try to remove firefox completely and reinstall; something along the lines of:\nsudo bash\naptitude update\naptitude purge firefox\naptitude install firefox\n\n(If you don't use/like aptitude, then apt-get should also work in much the same way.)\nAnother trick that sometimes has worked for me is to purge the caches Firefox uses. If you don't care about having to create anew your settings, bookmarks, etc., then you can clean all that up with:\n rm -r ~/.mozilla/firefox ~/.cache/mozilla/firefox\n\nand the next time you start up Firefox it should re-create appropriate directories automatically.\nFailing this, it is also possible that an error exists in dependencies between packages, e.g. due to an incomplete installation of firefox without all the necessary dependent packages. In this case, upgrading completely the system can also be necessary:\naptitude safe-upgrade\n\nThe packages for Firefox version 38 still seem to be physically on the Ubuntu server (list here: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/f/firefox/). Unfortunately, it does not seem possible to downgrade from 39 to 38 using the instructions found in the answers to previous question How to Downgrade a Package via apt-get? . apt-cache only knows about versions 39 and 28 at this time, has \"forgotten\" all intermediate versions.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: My Storage partition's name is shown as a bunch of letters I have dual boot Ubuntu with Windows 7, and my storage partition(NTFS)'s name is shown as a bunch of letters, and seems like the path to partition is also weird, which makes it hard to navigate. How should i change this?!\nHere are links of printscreen:\n\n\n\nA: What I usually do in these situations is copy the output from the mount command to the fstab and change the mount point to something more suitable.\nThe mount command with no options list all mounted partitions.\nCopy the line which refers to your NTFS partition to your /etc/fstab and change the mount point to something like /mnt/windows_c_drive, save the file and before you reboot, make sure the changes didn't break anything.\nThis can be done by unmounting the NTFS partition and then mount -a to mount every partition in fstab. If no errors occur you can safely reboot. If an error occurs and you don't know how to fix it, comment/delete the line you copied, before you search for more help, just to make sure you computer still boots.\n", "Q: How to download HTTRACK on my computer? httrack is a program so that you can copy a website.

But I want full control of this machine from my home Computer. I want to be able to work on if from home and take control of it from home.\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: The most easy to deploy and use tool is TeamViewer (which is crossplatfrom). You don't need to register, bring up tunnels or anything else (of course if you don't have restrictions in your home network). You just should have running TeamViewer on another computer and have automatically-generated number and password of remote machine.\nThe other ways is to bring up VNC server on remote machine, but you should make VNC ports forwarded to machine's public address or bring DDNS on remote router (and forward ports too), which one way is harder then first.\nThere is also RDP protocol realisation on Linux (Ubuntu as well), way to make it works same as VNC.\nAnd of course CLI access done by ssh. Bring up SSH server on remote computer, forward it's port to public address and do your best, you can't access desktop in that case, but can run X11 applications of remote computer via SSH, see SSH X11 forwarding for that case.\n", "Q: Re-install ubuntu without losing install So, I got my laptop a 500GB hard drive, I originally installed Windows 7 in a dual-boot with Ubuntu, having Windows 7's Partition before Ubuntu's Partition, but due to incompatibility with graphics drivers, I had to remove Windows 7. Now, I got my disk split into 250GB partitions, and I want to migrate my install and reformat the drive to combine these partitions. I backed up the entire root of the machine, excluding the folders /proc and /media using sudo. Is there any way I can erase the machine and re-install without losing anything?\n\nA: You can delete the first partition and grow the second partition to the size of entire drive. Use GParted from the Ubuntu LiveUSB boot.\nNo reinstall needed.\n(another unrelated small useful thing is to keep /home on separate partition)\n", "Q: Removing a package does not delete header and library files Previously, I had installed the OpenCV libraries on my machine, by running sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev. Now, I want to completely remove these libraries and everything that was installed during this process.\nTo do this, I ran sudo apt-get --purge remove libopencv-dev. Then, if I ran dpkg -s opencv-dev, it printed out: dpkg-query: package 'opencv-dev' is not installed and no information is available. So, it appears that OpenCV was removed.\nHowever, doing a search for any files including opencv in their name, I come across many, for example header files in /usr/local/include and library files in /usr/local/lib.\nWhy were these files not deleted when I removed the package?\n\nA: An installation via package manager doesn't place files in /usr/local. I assume, you have placed the files in that location. Therefore the package manager can't remove them.\nTo be sure, check the output of\napt-file list libopencv-dev\n\n\nlibopencv-dev is a meta package. List all files which will be installed during the installation of libopencv-dev:\napt-cache depends libopencv-dev | awk '{system(\"apt-file list \"$NF)}' | less\n\nor only the packages\napt-cache depends libopencv-dev | awk '{print $NF}'\n\nTo remove the packages use (check the output with the previous command first)\napt-cache depends libopencv-dev | awk '{system(\"sudo apt-get remove \"$NF)}'\n\n", "Q: Can't add ppa behind proxy?

My server happened to grab a very slow mirror.\nMy question is, why isn't this defaulted to us-east-1.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com (or whatever other applicable region) like the main trusty repos are?\n\nA: The security updates are set to pull from security.ubuntu.com so that security updates are immediately available when published and released, rather than the systems pulling in updates having to rely on a potentially out of date mirror's update cycles to execute before you get the security fixes.\nFor the other top level country mirrors, they're either specific locations for specific repositories (such as Partner), or they're country regional mirrors, or in the case of AWS EC2 images, the EC2 repositories in that region which run on AWS infrastructure but are maintained by Canonical.\nOther third-party mirror stats can be seen for some of the publicly listed ones here on Launchpad.\n", "Q: Graphics (geeqie) slow after 15.04 upgrade I upgraded an IBM Thinkpad T440p from 14.10 to 15.04 the other day.

Installing that on my 64-bit system is what killed it- and it turned out to be easier to wipe everything and start over for me but perhaps someone else could come up with a fix.\n", "Q: No HDMI output Nvidia 331 driver I've had a long running battle trying to get dual external monitor outputs from my 14.04 system.

If I run a GUI application that needs root privileges such as GParted, it gives me the option to authenticate as any administrator. However, running sudo in the terminal only asks for the current user's password and fails if it's running in a standard account. I realize I could easily work around this by switching the terminal session to an admin account, but that requires several extra lines of commands for just one root command. I also came across the idea to use pkexec instead of sudo, but it seems to have some problems with vim and gedit. Is there a simpler way to run commands with root privileges from a standard account? Preferably, a way to tell it to attempt super-user authorization with a different account. If it makes any difference, I'm using zsh instead of bash in Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: you must add the standard user to the /etc/sudoers files to give them priviledges to run elevated commands.\nFor example with a user called 'demo':\ndemo  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\nThe first field indicates the username that the rule will apply to (demo).\nThe first \"ALL\" indicates that this rule applies to all hosts.\nThe second \"ALL\" indicates that the demo user can run commands as all users.\nThe third \"ALL\" indicates that the demo user can run commands as all groups.\nThe last \"ALL\" indicates these rules apply to all commands.\n\nA: For commands which do not need to be connected to a tty or X server (i.e. a few command-line based admin utilities) you can use\nsu root -c <command>\n\nThe command may need to be enclosed in quote marks, and you will be prompted for the root user's password. Note that this requires the root account to be enabled, which it is not by default on Ubuntu. I also tried\nsu <administrator username> -c \"sudo <command\"\n\nbut that failed due to the lack of a connected tty.\n", "Q: How do I change permission to access all the files recovered through disk recovery tool `test-disk` from a NTFS partition?

Or maybe you can change the permissions on the files from inside LiveCD tho im not sure if that works.\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu create a file ending in ~ for every file I create with a text editor like GNU Emacs? \nWhy does Ubuntu create a file ending in ~ for every file I create with a text editor ?\n\nCreating a file with a text editor like GNU Emacs, say myfile, another file called myfile~ is also created. Why is this superfluous file created ? Using cat on it displays nothing.\nThanks,\n\nA: It's a backup file that contains the file's content from before saving and will be created every time you save the file.\n\nA: It's emacs(and xemacsand jed) -- not Ubuntu -- that creates those files.  It's a copy of the previous version of the file your editing, ie. the file as it was before you made changes and used \"save\" to save them.  I admit it's often a bother, but it's certainly useful if you've make changes you later regret.\nIt can be turned off manually -- and you can turn it off by default in the .emacsrc file.\nPersonally I run a cron-job that removes back-ups that hasn't been accessed for more than a week.\nemacs also make files called something \"#filename#\" and \".#filename#\".  This file contained unsaved changes -- ie. things you've done since last save.  The file is periodically updated as you edit a file.  If emacs (or your computer) crashes, you'll be asked to continue with the \"recovered buffer\" if you try to edit the file again.  (These files I also periodically \"cron-away\".)\nMy advice, keep letting emacs make back-ups... sooner or later you'll regret it if you don't.\n\nA: Emacs' default mode is to create a backup file with a \"~\" suffix every time you edit and save a file.

This is my first post so please don't mind my mistakes.\nI have searched on google for some time but can't seem to find the answer to my question.\nAfter I wrote some code in c language with gedit, I made a executable program with terminal using cc xxx.c and ran it with ./a.out, its works just fine but why cant I run it by double clicking on its icon. When I double click or choose run from right click context menu nothing happens.\nSo my question is \"Is it possible to run 'xxx.out' file with double click like other apps in Ubuntu?\"\n\nA: If you are able to run it in a terminal then the chances are, it's running just fine when you double click it.  However, since your program probably doesn't create it's own window, the output is likely just not being displayed.\nTry the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a program that writes output to a file in tmp\n\n*Run the program from a terminal to see that it does create the file\n\n*Delete the file it created\n\n*Check that the file no longer exists\n\n*Double click the program to run it\n\n*See if it created the file\n\n\nIf you see a file created after double clicking, then your application did run.\nIf your program doesn't create a gui of it's own, you may be able to make a shortcut for it and tell that shortcut to the run the command in a terminal.  Which, in retrospect, is exactly the process that user3113723 is describing...\n\nA: Maybe. It's probably a bad idea, but try something like this (may not be 100% correct, you may have to figure a few things out):\n\n\n*\n\n*Check value of mimetype a.out. It's probably application/x-executable. If there's no value, this won't work.\n\n*edit the defaults.list file in either /usr/share/applications or ~/.local/share/applications (possibly one under local should be called mimeapps.list), adding an entry mapping the mime type to some .desktop file.\n\n*Create the .desktop file, Giving it an exec line which does what you want (say, open an xterm and run the program).\n\n*Rebuild the mime cache with update-desktop-database.\nIf you did it correctly, xdg-open a.out in the terminal will do whatever you want to have happen when you double-click the file.\nMe, I'd stick to the terminal.\n", "Q: Having Problem with ipython notebook on ubuntu 14.04 I have installed ipython notebook in my system, but when I want to run it in terminal, the following error comes up:\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ipython-3.2.0-py2.7.egg/IPython/html/notebookapp.py\", line 52, in <module>\n    from tornado import httpserver\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tornado/httpserver.py\", line 34, in <module>\n    from tornado.http1connection import HTTP1ServerConnection, HTTP1ConnectionParameters\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tornado/http1connection.py\", line 30, in <module>\n    from tornado import iostream\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tornado/iostream.py\", line 40, in <module>\n    from tornado.netutil import ssl_wrap_socket, ssl_match_hostname, SSLCertificateError, _client_ssl_defaults, _server_ssl_defaults\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tornado/netutil.py\", line 39, in <module>\n    import certifi\nImportError: No module named certifi\n\nDoes any one know where the problem is?

The only difference between them will probably be which packages are preinstalled. E.g. desktop will have unity installed by default. You could use desktop install cd, and then remove all the desktop packages and you'd have a perfectly good server machine.\nThen again, having the desktop installed or running doesn't actually interfere the machine's ability to be a server, except insofar as it consumes resources.\nUbuntu server (which I haven't used in forever) probably already has all the stuff you would probably want to remove taken out already, but then again maybe not.

Ideally, I'd put it in /etc/rc.local. That does not work. May be the kernel powers the CPUs down after rc.local is executed at boot?\nIn any case, here is my script - \n#!/bin/bash\nsudo bash -c \"echo '1' > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online\"\nsudo bash -c \"echo '1' > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu2/online\"\nsudo bash -c \"echo '1' > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/online\"\n<some command>\n\nThe problem is, <some command> runs and the echo lines above do not give anything on stdout. However, lscpu shows only 1 CPU active. Pasting these lines into the terminal directly does not work. That was not the puzzling part for me. I assumed I messed something up. Here's what is puzzling. Doing sudo su followed by the echo command works, as I said earlier. Now, exiting out of root and running \nsudo bash -c \"echo '1' > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu2/online\"\nsudo bash -c \"echo '1' > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/online\"\n\nin my user shell (user is sudoer) works.

But echoing after sudo su for one CPU lets me echo the others outside the root shell. \nFinally, tee used like so does not work either - \necho 1 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online\n\nAny help as to why this is happening and how I could use sudo bash -c from within a script in the user terminal would be appreciated. \n\nA: The reason sudo echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/online doesn't work is because the sudo part applies only to the main command (echo 1); it doesn't apply to the redirection (> /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/online), and so the writing-to-the-file part is done under your user account.\nUsing something like echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/online should work, as the writing part will be done under sudo, while the echo part will be under your account. I'm not sure why it didn't work in your case.\n\nA: Putting su at the top of the script, and then running the commands normally will work just fine. The reason you have to use sudo su instead of just sudo is because sudo only works on the main program, the redirection (>) is run without root privileges.\n\nA: Huh.  That's weird.\nThis should work:\ncat | sudo bash << \"EOF\"\necho 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online\necho 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu2/online\necho 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/online\nEOF\n\nPerhaps the other stuff was working for you, but because you didn't disable the scaling governor it turned the cores back off before you started using them?\nAccording to http://elinux.org/Jetson/Performance you should also echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuquiet/tegra_cpuquiet/enable\n", "Q: Can't restrict Apache to accept only connections from local machine I am following the Ubuntu ApacheMySQLPHP Community wiki to install these tools https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP.\nI want to configue Apache so as to only serve requests from my local machine.

It made a backup (initctl.distrib) so sudo rm /sbin/initctl && sudo mv /sbin/initctl.distrib /sbin/initctl fixed it.\n\nA: I ran into this problem today on my 16.04 on VMWare Workstation 12 on Windows 10. After entering initial login details, Ubuntu was not going any further. Had to get into Advanced Options mode --> Drop root shell (paraphrased) to remove and replace /sbin/initctl as shown by Enigma above, but the Advanced Options mode runs a read-only filesystem.

I accidentally removed my windows when I install ubuntu.\nHow to install windows after ubuntu?\nand how to make memory partition in ubuntu?\n\nA: You can install Windows and just don't re-format the Ubuntu Partition. (If its the whole disk, shrink it down and make space for windows)\nWindows will delete Grub bootloader tho, so after installing windows use this tool to re-create GRUB bootloader\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/boot-repair-cd/\nThen use GParted to shrink a partition down and format the space as SWAP (Memory Partition)\nPS: A usual rule is same amount of SWAP as RAM up to a certain point like 4GBS, after that I don't think you need SWAP really or definitely don't need 8GB Swap (Its used when RAM is full)\nA good program also if you want to keep Windows Boot loader, look into EasyBCD to add Ubuntu to Windows Bootloader options.\n", "Q: Remmina cannot perform VNC remote desktop session before user logs in I would like to perform a VNC remote desktop session with Remmina between two computers running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I am able to do this remote session when a user is already logged into Unity on the remote computer. However, if the computer has just booted and the Unity log in screen is visible (i.e. that a user hasn't logged in yet), I am unable to start the remote desktop session. This forces me to physically go to the remote computer and log in so I can start the remote desktop session.\nA solution would be to configure users on the remote computer to automatically log in into Ubuntu, but I would like to avoid this since it is not a secure configuration.\nAny ideas on how Remmina could start a VNC remote session even if no users are logged in on the remote machine ?\n\nA: Remmina is the viewer; Vino is probably the server that you're using, Among other drawbacks, it is unable to run outside of a user session.\nX11VNC is what you want.  I find that the performance is also much better than Vino; for years, every time I try Vino, I always end up installing X11VNC.\nThere is a bit of config to be done to make it work right, but here are some skeleton notes on what I did with my last X11VNC installation:\nVino performance still stinks; installed X11VNC\n    $ x11vnc -storepasswd\n    /etc/init/x11vnc.conf:\n        start on login-session-start\n        script\n        x11vnc -display :0 -auth /var/run/lightdm/root/:0 -loop -forever -safer -shared -ultrafilexfer -bg -o /var/log/x11vnc.log -rfbauth /home/charles/.vnc/passwd -rfbport 5900 -http -users charles -nowireframe\n        end script\n    Reboot and it's good to go.  Indestructible! Even survives desktop reconfig due to monitor unplugs, etc.\n    (added -nowireframe later because the lack of visible icon when dragging files was annoying.

I have several Virtual machines (VMs) that run through VirtualBox that I have created desktop configuration files for and set custom icons (usually in .svg format, although to see whether this issue is localized just to SVG icons I have tried using .png icons, with no improvement in visibility) for. In other desktop environments such as Cinnamon, GNOME 3, LXDE, MATE, Unity and Xfce these custom icons are rendered perfectly fine, without issue, but for whatever reason in KDE (i.e., Kubuntu, installed via running sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop from terminator) these icons simply do not appear. The desktop configuration files do appear in the KDE application menu, but next to their names, where I would normally see their icon there's absolutely nothing shown. See for example, the screenshot below showing how they appear in the KDE application menu. \n\nI also know that when I drag these VM machines from the KDE menu to the plasma panel the application launchers that appears in the panel also has no icon shown.

You can read more about it here. It originates from a Archlinux AUR but the pachtes are availabe to download.\nI would like to patch Chromium from Source for Ubuntu, but I never did that before. I'm more or less familiar with building from source with config, make & make install, but it seems rather difficult for Chromium. I found some instruction here and here. \nCan someone provide a proper step-by-step tutorial on how to build and patch chromium from source?\n\nA: (Note that the link to Ubuntu's instructions for building Chromium appears to be heavily outdated.)\nDisclaimer: I'm the maintainer of the Chromium Beta and Dev PPAs.\nIf you run apt-get source chromium-browser, you'll get the source code for the current stable version of Chromium that's in the repos along with the patches that Ubuntu applies on top of Chromium (which are in the debian/patches folder). You can add additional patches to be applied to Chromium here, but note that some of the patches you add may conflict or be the same as the patches Ubuntu uses. Also, update the series file, which describes what patches to apply and in what order.\nThe build script is at debian/rules. It's quite long, but the most important variable you'll probably be interested in is GYP_DEFINES, which is where you would specify the build flags to build Chromium with. For example, if you wanted to build Chromium with enable_google_now=0, then add a line saying GYP_DEFINES += enable_google_now=0 (you can add it around the other lines starting with GYP_DEFINES). Note that some build flags on that page conflict with the build flags Ubuntu uses (I know enable_webrtc is set to 1 in debian/rules).\nAs for building it, the simplest way would probably be to run dpkg-buildpackage -b from the chromium-browser-* directory. This will apply the patches, run through the debian/rules file, and then make several deb files. If there are build dependencies missing, it should notify you of those and stop the build. You can then install those deb files.\nNote that building Chromium takes about 4-5 hours on a 4-core machine and takes about 15 GB of space (with debugging symbols included). Without debugging symbols (if you comment out the line that adds the -g flag), I'd estimate that it would take about 7-8 GB of space.\n", "Q: libvirtd cant start I want to start listening on my server, but libvirtd cant run.\nHeres error log:\n2015-07-09 10:50:25.238+0000: 11569: info : libvirt version: 1.2.2\n2015-07-09 10:50:25.238+0000: 11569: error : virAuditOpen:60 : Unable to initialize audit layer: Protocol not supported\n2015-07-09 10:50:26.117+0000: 11596: error : virCommandWait:2399 : internal error: Child process (/bin/sh -c 'EBT=\"/sbin/ebtables\"\ncmd='\\''$EBT -t nat -L'\\''\neval res=\\$\\(\"${cmd} 2>&1\"\\)\nif [ $? -ne 0 ]; then  echo \"Failure to execute command '\\''${cmd}'\\'' : '\\''${res}'\\''.\";  exit 1;fi\n') unexpected exit status 1\n2015-07-09 10:50:26.117+0000: 11596: error : ebiptablesDriverTestCLITools:4274 : Testing of ebtables command failed: Failure to execute command '$EBT -t nat -L' : 'The kernel doesn't support the ebtables 'nat' table.'.\n\nDoes anyone know how to handle this?\nLinux mcparadise.pl 3.14.32-xxxx-grs-ipv6-64 #1 SMP Sat Feb 7 11:35:27 CET 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n\nA: Knowing nothing about your problem, i think the significant part of the error message is this :\n'The kernel doesn't support the ebtables 'nat' table.'\n\nI did a quick search and there are a few resources\nhttps://wiki.debian.org/BridgeNetworkConnections#ebtables_Overview\nhttp://www.keypressure.com/blog/linux-bridge-port-security/\nAlso i saw a kernel module called 'ebtables' and another called 'ebtable_nat' that you can enable with modprobe.\n", "Q: Orange Nura phone not recognized on ubuntu 14.04 When I plug my orange phone on my ubuntu 14.04 computer, I see the following logs :\nJul 11 11:30:00 philippe-Dell-DM061 kernel: [588445.733075] usb 1-3: USB disconnect, device number 4\nJul 11 11:30:13 philippe-Dell-DM061 kernel: [588458.592068] usb 1-3: new high-speed USB device number 5 using ehci-pci\nJul 11 11:30:13 philippe-Dell-DM061 kernel: [588458.724967] usb 1-3: New USB device found, idVendor=1bbb, idProduct=af00\nJul 11 11:30:13 philippe-Dell-DM061 kernel: [588458.724976] usb 1-3: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3\nJul 11 11:30:13 philippe-Dell-DM061 kernel: [588458.724981] usb 1-3: Product: Android\nJul 11 11:30:13 philippe-Dell-DM061 kernel: [588458.724986] usb 1-3: Manufacturer: Android\nJul 11 11:30:13 philippe-Dell-DM061 kernel: [588458.724990] usb 1-3: SerialNumber: b05c6268\nJul 11 11:30:13 philippe-Dell-DM061 kernel: [588458.726395] usb-storage 1-3:1.0: USB Mass Storage device detected\nJul 11 11:30:13 philippe-Dell-DM061 kernel: [588458.726487] scsi8 : usb-storage 1-3:1.0\nJul 11 11:30:13 philippe-Dell-DM061 mtp-probe: checking bus 1, device 5: \"/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1a.7/usb1/1-3\"\nJul 11 11:30:13 philippe-Dell-DM061 mtp-probe: bus: 1, device: 5 was not an MTP device \n\nThere is an automatic volume mount on USB Driver with various drivers but I can't find the linux one. \nHas somone already had this issue ?\n\nA: Okay at the begining it was not an ubuntu issue but it became one : \nFirst You have to enable MTP in the storage setting when the phone is connected with USB cable :\nStorage > Options > USB connexion\nBut ubuntu still can't recognize the phone as a MTP device.\nI edited the /lib/udev/rules.d/69-libmtp.rules and saw that there was not the idVendor 1bbb with product af00.

I need to take the total working hours of the system in a day. That means, take time between power on and shutdown and also subtract the time of system were suspend. Final output must be total working hours in a day. I tried some third party softwares and my own command based operations but all that failed. How can i calculate that. Is there any way? I tried an idea to get the result like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*system power on time : \"time\"\n\n*system suspend at :  \"time\"\n\n*system wake up at : \"time\"\n\n*system shut downed at : \"time\"\n\n*total working hour: ((system shut downed - system power on) - (difference between sleep time and wake up time))\n\n\nI think it's huge task.\nCan u please help me?\n\nA: Note: This is only a partial answer, dealing only with the difference between uptime and suspended time.\nYou could determine the difference between uptime and suspended time utilizing some of the information available via /proc/timer_list.\nExample 1:\n$ uptime\n 11:58:46 up  3:43,  2 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05\n$ cat /proc/timer_list | grep \"now at\"\nnow at 12734872068331 nsecs\n\nSo uptime = (3 * 60 + 43) * 60 = 13,3800 seconds.\nActive time = 12,735 seconds.\nTherefore Suspended time = 13,300 - 12,735 = 645 seconds\nOr, just look at the offset time for each CPU to get its suspended time directly:\n$ cat /proc/timer_list | grep -A 1 \"ktime_get_boottime\"\n  .get_time:   ktime_get_boottime\n  .offset:     668016000993 nsecs\n--\n  .get_time:   ktime_get_boottime\n  .offset:     668016000993 nsecs\n--\n  .get_time:   ktime_get_boottime\n  .offset:     668016000993 nsecs\n--\n  .get_time:   ktime_get_boottime\n  .offset:     668016000993 nsecs\n--\n  .get_time:   ktime_get_boottime\n  .offset:     668016000993 nsecs\n--\n  .get_time:   ktime_get_boottime\n  .offset:     668016000993 nsecs\n--\n  .get_time:   ktime_get_boottime\n  .offset:     668016000993 nsecs\n--\n  .get_time:   ktime_get_boottime\n  .offset:     668016000993 nsecs\n\nOr 668 seconds for each CPU.\nWhy do the two methods differ by 23 seconds? Because uptime is only listed to the minute. So that answer is really 645 +59 -0 seconds (or, depending if uptime rounds, 645 +- 30 seconds.\nSo for what you seem to want run this during shutdown:\n$ cat /proc/timer_list | grep \"now at\"\nnow at 25561396304263 nsecs\n\nand divide that number by 3.6e12 (i.e. 7.1 hours active time)\n\nA: All the information needed is in journalctl.

You will get an option to upgrade during the installation process, similar to the one in the image. You won't loose your data stored in your /home directory.\nNow if you are on a server and cannot do it like this,you can do it from the command line, but it will require some effort. You can only upgrade to the next distro. So you need to upgrade to the next version, which is 13.04, and so on ultil you get to your LTS.

So I was wondering how this could be achieved, because I haven't seen any options which seem to enable anything like this?\nContextual Information:\nThis is not for my machine, but instead another machine which I am managing and cannot be on the whole time to update, but needs to be regularly updated without user intervention.\n\nA: Open your favorite editor and create a script file similar to this:\n#!/usr/local/bin/zsh  ### I use zsh, enter your shell here.\nsudo apt-get -qq update\nsudo apt-get -y -qq upgrade\nexit                  ### Be sure to include this exit line\n\nMake your Your_Script_File.sh executable.\nchmod +x <your_script_file.sh>\n\nNext, edit the sudoers file.\nOpen a terminal and enter \n    sudo visudo\n\nAt the end of the file (really, the last line) add the following lines.\n<user_name>  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /home/<user_name>/script_name.sh\n<user_name>  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get -qq update\n<user_name>  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get -y -qq upgrade\n\nAfter that you won't be prompted for a password for the commands listed.  These lines should include the exact commands used in your script.  You will no longer be prompted for a password, and the -qq eliminates the scrolling output in the terminal window.  Please understand this is a very risky solution, there is a reason why you need to type a password for some commands, the use of these commands without password can leave your system open for some dangers. Use with caution.  I like the -qq option because it is rarely used by most users and if they run \nsudo apt-get update\n\nThe system will require a password.\nNext, ALT + F2 open Startup Applications.\nThis will run the Startup Applications Preferences dialog window.\nClick Add.  Give it a name, I used \"startUpdate\".  In the Command box enter the command \n    xterm -e ./<your_script_name\n\nXterm recognizes the exit from the script and will close the window, when execution is complete.\nThe user will see a blank xterm window for a couple of minutes, then it closes.\nHope this works for you.\n", "Q: How to find out where iptables rules come from? I used to have my own set of iptables rules on my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS installation. This was residing in /etc/network/if-pre-up.d/iptables.\nNow, apparently after another apt-get dist-upgrade it looks like my rules are overridden: when I run iptables -L I see stuff which seems to be originating from libvirt or something else but not me.\nI am therefore looking for a way to find out where those rules come from so that I could edit/control them. The way I am after needs to be smarter than the one I am trying now — simply searching all system config files for unique strings appearing in the iptables -L output.\nUPDATE:\nAfter running virsh net-autostart default --disable and rebooting all those weird iptables rules have gone. Now that I have clean iptables I know — they were previously polluted by libvirt/kvm.\nStill, the question remains: is there a general way of finding out where iptables rules come from? Something more intelligent than guessing and turning stuff off one by one to see if it affects iptables?\n\nA: Generally iptables rules are saved or loaded by scripts residing in /etc/init.d.  Assuming the scripts are using the typical iptables-save and iptables-restore commands, you could search for them with a recursive grep, for example:\ngrep -R iptables-restore /etc/init.d/\n\nIf the grep command output reveals any files, you can see what package was responsible for placing those files on the system.\ndpkg-query -S file-name-result-of-grep\n\nThere is a chance that the file was either generated at install time or created by a regular user, if that's the case, then dpkg may not know about the file.\nIf the single-package-name terse output from dpkg isn't descriptive enough, you can apt-cache show package-name on the name of the package provided by dpkg.\n\nA: I believe the resulting iptables rules come from /var/lib/libvirt/network/default.xml which in turn is generated from /etc/libvirt/qemu/networks/default.xml when virsh net-edit default is used to make changes. I think, but am not sure, the rules are not stored as a rule set, but rather compiled from the .xml source and entered into the iptables rule set when libvirtd is started during boot.\n", "Q: Can not read external hard disk with Ubuntu 14.04 I have 2TB WD external hard disk with (NTFS) format.\nI try to read it with Ubuntu 14.04 without success.\nAlso tried to install NTFS-3g, but still not working\nI have a lot of data store inside. Could you please help me ?\n\nA: I had the same problem earlier on and tried a few commands so I don't know which one actually did it but here is a list from my terminal history. \nsudo e2fsck -y /dev/sda1 \n/dev/sda1 /media ntfs -ro \nchmod /dev/sda1 -r \n/dev/sda1 -r-w \nsudo fdisk -lu \n/dev/sda1 sodu fdisk -lu \n\nPlease note that some commands aren't real, just a mixture of commands I tried to run. In any case all of them did nothing until I restarted my PC. \nAlso take note to update your apt data with the cmd: \nsudo apt-get update\n\n\nA: You should post the error messages...\nAnd ntfs3g is pre installed in ubuntu...\nSo the Main Problem should be a unsafe unplug vor umount.\nIf this is your Problem you can See messages regarding that in your logs.\nYou can override that or just Connect und eject the drive once in Windows...\nPerhaps this helps: Unable to mount Windows (NTFS) filesystem due to hibernation\n", "Q: Installing application error in terminal I was going through the Ubuntu FAQ and I came across an antivirus called clamav, it was a problem getting the obvious ./configure command and after the flashing processes in terminal the last line of output was \nconfigure: error: OpenSSL not found. \n\nHow do I fix this error?\n\nA: To fix the error you must (as the error implies) install openssl.

I tried background images, (custom ones and the ones from grub2-splashimages), color changing (all the options), but it does not want to apply. It does save correctly(without any errors), and as far as I know, grub is installed on the default location. Also the changes are still there when I re-launch grub-customizer.\nAlso I am using grub-emulator to test the result, but it is showing the exact same thing.\nIf you need any of grub's config files, please mention.\n\nA: To add a custom background image:\n\n\n*\n\n*Save your background image to your Pictures directory as .png\n\n*Open terminal and paste sudo gedit /etc/grub.d/05_debian_theme\n\n*Paste the line GRUB_BACKGROUND=\"/home/YOURUSERNAME/Pictures/NAME-OF-BACKGROUND.png\" on its own line in the file.\n\n*In terminal run sudo update-grub\n\n*Terminal should say background image found.\n\n*Reboot.\n\n\nIf this does not work, then I am not sure.

Thank you.\n\nA: Grub works better with png images than jpg.\nHave a look at this page: Ubuntu Community - Grub2/Displays\n\nGRUB 2 can use PNG, JPG/JPEG and TGA images for the background. The\n  image must meet the following specifications:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*JPG/JPEG images must be 8-bit (256 color). Else you will get errors saying \"Too many Huffman tables\". Since most of the time you\n  will not want to limit yourself to 256 colors (which is totally\n  yesteryear) you will probably find PNG much preferable.\n  \n*Images should be non-indexed, RGB.\n  \n\n\nA: If you only want to change the background image you can do this:\nPut the image under /boot/grub/ and run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nFor some reason grub-customizer doesn't work you should fill a bug.\nIt happens to a lot of users.\nThis article for Debian should work, since Ubuntu is based on it.\n\nNow to change the colors, open “/etc/grub.d/05_debian_theme” and find\nthe following line:\n    if [ -z \"${2}\" ] && [ -z \"${3}\" ]; then\n            echo \"  true\"\n    fi\n\nand, replace them with the following:\nif [ -z \"${2}\" ] && [ -z \"${3}\" ]; then\n    # echo \"  true\"\n    echo \"    set color_highlight=red/green\"\n    echo \"    set color_normal=light-cyan/black\" \nfi\n\nDon’t change the “black” present in color_normal. If changed, the\nimage will not be transparent in the area where the menu is displayed.\nAfter this change, execute “update-grub”, and reboot your system.\n\n\nThe following colors are supported by grub:\n\nblack\nblue\nbrown\ncyan\ndark-gray\ngreen\nlight-cyan\nlight-blue\nlight-green\nlight-gray\nlight-magenta\nlight-red\nmagenta\nred\nwhite\nyellow\n\nThe article explains also the paths and the requirements for the images.\nYou simply need to put them in some folder no need to edit the config.\nMake a backup of the file that you will edit.\n", "Q: Nvidia crashes after updating ubuntu I am using Ubuntu 14.04 64bit and Nvidia driver on my PC.

My PC is running a nvidia geforce 7300 gs. Not exactly the same card as yours, but maybe the solution I applied will work for you as well.\nI uninstalled nvidia-304 driver and installed the nvidia-173. This is not a perfect solution, because I still encountered some minor issues, namely while switching to another account, and sometimes I need to login twice to enter my session.\nBefore login, go to a terminal (CTRL-ALT-F1), login and execute the following commands:\nsudo apt-get remove nvidia-304\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-173\n\n\nA: I had a similar problem years ago. Solving it essentially required aggressively removing all nvidia program files. Please note that the use of \"--purge\" when uninstalling the nvidia package did not seem to remove the offending nvidia program(s). I had to do a subsequent file search using \"nvidia\" to locate residual nvidia packages(?). \nPlease see my post: Fixing/Repairing a Blank (Black) Screen in Ubuntu 13.04. Please note that this post is nearly two years old and I have not had a subsequent issue.\nI see that you have a \"AMD athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual core Processor\". One of my computers is also an AMD athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual core Processor that utilizes an nvidia graphics card. Occasionally the text gets scrambled but this has been happening less frequently. I assume in response to bug fixes.\nHave your tried using \"X.ORGXserver - Nouveau display driver\"? It now seems to work fairly reliably. It is located under \"System Settings\" --> \"Software & Updates\" --> \"Additional Drivers\". Also, my screen identifies, as a possible selection, the Nvidia binary driver version 331.113. As with the Nouveau drive, it occasionally scrambles text. The simple solution when that occurs, is to reboot.\n", "Q: Can't pass file containing whitespace as command-line argument to SMS-sending Python script in Ubuntu Touch in Ubuntu Touch I can send text messages by SMS using the command:\n$ /usr/share/ofono/scripts/send-sms /ril_0 07123456789 \"iorem ipsum est\" 0\n\nWhere /ril_0 is the SIM card/modem, 07123456789 is the telephone number, \"iorem ipsum est\" is the text to be sent and the last 0 is (I think) a boolean determining whether or not the script will request a delivery report.\nThis works fine, and produces the output:\nSend message using modem /ril_0 ...\n/ril_0/message_20C76858222F2CDF61342FC317BF53AC4B763441\n\nHowever, this doesn't seem to work:\n$ echo '\"iorem ipsum est\"' > textfile\n$ /usr/share/ofono/scripts/send-sms /ril_0 07123456789 $(cat textfile) 0\n\nI tried a few permutations, backticks and so forth; none of them work and they all produce output like this:\nSend message using modem /ril_1 ...\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/share/ofono/scripts/send-sms\", line 31, in <module>\n    mm.SetProperty(\"UseDeliveryReports\", dbus.Boolean(int(sys.argv[3])))\nValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '\"iorem'\n\n/ril_1 is where the second SIM card would be (if there were one), and I guess the rest is a stack trace?\nFor what it's worth, this works fine:\n$ echo '\"iorem\"' > textfile\n$ /usr/share/ofono/scripts/send-sms /ril_0 07123456789 $(cat textfile) 0\n\nSo I guess the problem lies in the way $() handles output containing whitespace?\nI've pasted the contents of /usr/share/ofono/scripts/send-sms to http://pastebin.com/u8gHMc5R (and of course the source is available to download from Ubuntu, here http://packages.ubuntu.com/en/vivid/ofono-scripts).\nI don't really want to mess with the original Python script (even if I knew any Python, which I don't!), but if there isn't a shell solution that I don't know (something using pipes or xargs, maybe?)

After some digging, I found that a recent kernel update had taken effect at restart and it wasn’t playing nicely with my NVIDIA graphics card and/or drivers.  \nSolution:\nRestarting Ubuntu using the previous kernel version fixed the problem.  I edited /etc/default/grub and ran grub-update to default to the previous kernel version and this works.  But now I am worried about the long-term outlook for my machine.\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Should I try reinstalling my NVIDIA drivers?  They were a giant pain to install the first time around.  They are still present on the system so I don’t know if reinstalling them with the new kernel in place would make any difference and I don’t really feel like spending half a day working on a project that appears to have little chance of success. \n\n*Should I file a bug report with Ubuntu?  Or maybe on the git repository for the kernel?  Is this a bug, or is this kind of thing par for the course when running third party drivers?  \n\n*Most importantly am I now stuck with the Linux 3.16.0-41-generic kernel for the rest of eternity?  Is it likely that this problem will be resolved in 3.16.0-45 or will I just be running on an old kernel until I get a new machine.  My graphics card is not old so I would be surprised if it is no longer supported.  And running an outdated kernel smells like a security risk.  What’s the deal?\n\nA: If you install Nvidia drivers from .run files, you will always have to reinstall them after each kernel upgrade.\nTo install Nvidia drivers a proper way you need to uninstall it first by running\nsudo sh <nvidia_run_file_name>.run --uninstall\n\nfrom the directory where the driver file is located.\nThen you can install nvidia-331 from Ubuntu repositories by\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-331\n\nor install the latest driver from xorg-edgers PPA.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-352\nsudo add-apt-repository -r ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\nNow also 340, 346 and 349 versions are available there.\nIf you have hybrid grapghics, you need also nvidia-prime package.\n\nA: You could try this and upgrade you kernel, and enter this in the terminal:\n sudo apt-get install linux-amd64_ linux-efi\n sudo apt-get install aptitude\n sudo apt-get update\n sudo apt-get upgrade\n sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n sudo apt-get install -f\n sudo aptitude linux-efi\n\nand it might work fine this way.\n", "Q: steam won't install on chromebook 15.04 I recently installed Ubuntu 15.04 on my chromebook, the new way through usb boot, and it won't let me install steam, it downloaded the package and took me to the software center for download but all it is saying is \"dependency is satisfiable: curl\" I'm not really sure what with means and most solutions I've either don't work or are based on drivers and such and I'm pretty new to all of this and need an explanation on how to fix this in a as nooby way as possible. \n\nA: Can you try to install curl?\napt-get install curl \nThen try to rerun the Steam installer. \nIf that does not work then run apt-get -f install which will install any missing dependencies, and then try to rerun the steam installer. \n", "Q: how can I transfer downloaded movies to a usb? I always download movies from torrents and have them on my laptop. Now I was trying to transfer them to my USB so it won't take too much space. Once I connected my USB to my TV the movies are not there? What am I doing wrong? So far the only thing I've done is just drag the movie to the USB.\n\nA: Three things you need to make sure that they exist, to be able to watch movies from your USB drive on your TV:\n\n\n*\n\n*The USB drive needs to be in the correct format. eg Fat32 or ExFAT, check your TV’s manual for the supported format.\n\n*If the disc is in FAT32 format, then files can't be larger than 4GB each.\n\n*The movies need to be in a format recognized by your TV. eg. MPEG2 and MPEG4 are more than likely to be recognized, but for any other format, again, check your TV's manual.\n\n", "Q: How to install menu bar in Ubuntu Browser Two questions:  How do I import bookmarks from firefox to ubuntu browser. Second question, how do I get a menu bar to show in Ubuntu Browser.  Thanks, Carol\n\nA: Assuming that when you say ubuntu browser you actually mean firefox, all you have to do is sign into sync. There it will sync all your settings. To get into sync, click on the menu icon (the button the the top right corner) and on the near the bottom you will see a bar that says \n\nSign into sync\n\nclick on that, sign into your account or create a new one (if you don't have one already, then you should create the account on the firefox with all your personalizations already made), follow any other directions it gives you,  and walla.

This caused a problem, because now i have 2 folders in my /media/administrator folder, one is named after my external HDD and the other is also named after my external HDD except it has the number 1 in the end (I will post screenshots). Whenever I try to access the original folder it says access denied and if I go to properties it shows I have 31GB of storage which is wrong, but when I try to access the duplicate I can do it just fine, and when i go to properties it shows 1TB like it should. My question is how can I make it back to normal, and by that i mean having only one folder in /media/administrator when I connect my external hard drive.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: The solution is simple. To be sure, unmount your external HDD and check the folders in /media/administrator again. Now, there should be only one (empty) folder. Remove the folder with sudo rights:\nsudo rmdir /media/administrator/HDD1\n\n\nExplanation\nYour system usually creates and removes the folders automatically, if you plugging an external device. The problem was, your Ubuntu crashed. Therefore the system can't remove the folder and the next created folder becomes a suffix, the number 1.\n", "Q: What should i do exactly when i get errors with choises when building jhbuild Im trying to install Gtk+3.

I do NOT need to be able to select the boot device from GRUB or a windows bootloader.  I'm perfectly willing to do an explicit boot device selection from BIOS to choose when I need to boot into the Ubuntu OS on the 16G drive.  I should actually consider this a requirement, as at some point I will likely need to move one or both of these devices to another machine and I want them to appear as standalone devices, each with their native bootloaders and no knowledge of the \"other\" OS installed on that machine.  \nI've tried stepping through the Ubuntu installation program, but it's not clear to me how I could do this (both selecting the destination device for the install and ONLY installing grub on that device).  Anyone have suggestions on how this might work?  I found a suggestion that was basically \"take the other disks out, install, and then reinstall the disks\" but that's not only pretty un-elegant, it's a real pain for me to take this particular machine (laptop) apart to get to the physical drives.  \n\nA: At the end of the installation process, you are asked to install a bootloader aka grub.\nAt the bottom of the screen choose the device on which to install it with the drop-down menu.\n\nThat's it.\nAlthough, the installer will certainly auto-detect other OSes and populate the grub menu with it. But that' not a problem. Just ignore those entries.\n\nA: I know a workaround, might be an easier way though! But previously, I have just installed Ubuntu, installed Grub then used EasyBCD in windows to wipe the entire bootloader, then when you reboot it will take you to the system repair screen. Go to advanced, then use cmd.exe and use the command\n    bootrec /rebuildbcd\n\nThis will recreate original Windows Bootloader, which will not find Ubuntu and Grub will not exist. You will now have Ubuntu Alone on your spare disk, which is useless I believe without a bootloader. This is where you would use a livecd like http://sourceforge.net/projects/boot-repair-cd/ to install grub to the Ubuntu Disk. But it will try to install grub to the Windows partition, so you will have to specify which disk. Maybe even use Gparted to create a small free partition for for Grub on the Ubuntu disk.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server 15.04 how to login using ssh? After installation, I tried to login from a remote computer using ssh. It asks for the password but it does not allow the server password as valid. What is the default configuration for ssh in Ubuntu Server? How to change the password (without changing the password for root)?\n\nA: I disable the password access and used private/public key. Follow this document:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys\nNote! Generates the keys in your client computer and transfer the public key to the server! Do not disable the passwords authentication until you test login using the public key.\n\nA: Often the default ssh config doesn't allow root login, or root login with a password (i.e. you have to use an ssh key). You could change this, but you're probably better off ssh-ing in as a normal user and using sudo or su, unless you have special requirements for some reason.\n", "Q: Why the latest updates removes pycrypto-2.0.1 When I reinstall the latest unity-control-center it removes pycrypto-2.0.1.

Instead, I think that you had installed an older version of this package and when apt saw that there was a newer version available it installed if for you. \nThis is the nature of the apt package manager. If you wish to stay on a specific version of a package then I would suggest that you pin it.

Which is advised and why? While I know some facts about UEFI and Legacy and basic differences between them, like UEFI allowing for faster booting (I've checked this question already, but it doesn't answer mine), I have a bit of a different question(s):\nI'm not sure if BIOS settings can have any influence on how the system works and if legacy settings can be the cause of hardware misbehaving, but I usually install my Linux systems in legacy mode, with boot priority legacy first. Is it ok this way or should I change either the boot priority to UEFI first, or everything adjusted to UEFI (this Lenovo G50-45 laptop came with Windows 8).\nAlso, on my laptop quite a few things don't work properly, whereas on Windows everything worked and I'm not sure where the fault lies. I only recall, that Windows wouldn't install with legacy settings, I had to change boot priority to UEFI first to be able to install it (Win 7 Ultimate x64).\nCurrently on *ubuntu (any variant) 15.04 I have issues with microphone not working (distorted, very weak sound) and Xorg crashes my entire session with Libreoffice in k3.19+. Tested with many distributions.\nSo, to conclude, which one is recommended for a flawlessly working system? Do Linux distributions work better with Legacy, or UEFI? (if there is any difference in terms of functionality of the system)\n\nA: For most hardware, the boot mode (EFI vs. BIOS) is irrelevant. The drivers Linux loads are identical in either case, as should be the performance. The main caveat here is that the hardware may be initialized in different ways depending on your boot mode, and if the Linux drivers make assumptions about how the hardware is initialized, one way or the other may work better. This sometimes made booting one mode or the other (usually BIOS mode) preferable in the past, but this type of problem is becoming rather rare today. This type of issue mostly affected video hardware and drivers, but in principle it could affect anything.\nIn your specific case, my suspicion is that you've got \"bleeding-edge\" hardware with poor Linux support, or perhaps hardware that requires special configuration to work correctly in Linux. Your best bet is to post separate questions about each specific device that's not working to your satisfaction. You can also test with both BIOS-mode and EFI-mode installations to determine empirically which one works better for you, since there is no way to accurately generalize which mode is best.\nThe correct answer to the question of which mode is best is: It depends. For instance:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're dual-booting with an OS that's already installed in one mode or the other, it's almost always best to boot Ubuntu (or any other Linux) in the same boot mode as the one that's already in use.\n\n*Using BIOS/CSM/legacy mode almost always complicates the boot process, as described in detail on this Web page of mine. The result is that enabling BIOS-mode booting makes problems more likely to crop up, especially if you've already got an EFI-mode OS installed.\n\n*Knowledge of BIOS-mode boot processes is more widespread, which can counter the preceding issue on a single-OS system.\n\n*As I've described, some hardware initialization issues can favor one boot mode or the other (usually BIOS mode is easier to get working). Such problems seem to be fading in frequency, though.\n\n*EFI-mode booting is usually a bit faster than BIOS-mode booting, although details differ from one OS to another.\n\n*Your choice of boot loaders is somewhat different. If you venture beyond the default GRUB, you might prefer something that's available in only one boot mode. Currently, this would tend to favor EFI, since there are some EFI-specific boot managers (gummiboot, rEFIt, and rEFInd) with no BIOS counterparts; but AFAIK the only BIOS-specific boot program for Linux without an EFI port or workalike are BURG and LOADLIN, both of which are (AFAIK) abandoned.\n\n*Secure Boot (a UEFI-specific feature) can help you control your boot process, preventing unauthorized code from running. If you want to, and if you're willing to put in the effort, you can even use Secure Boot to prevent Windows from running on your computer.\n\n*On some computers, GPT presents problems when booting in BIOS mode; but GPT is the standard for EFI. GPT offers some minor advantages on sub-2TiB disks, but is required on disks larger than that. (Assuming 512-byte logical sectors; but larger logical sectors are iffy for booting in BIOS mode, and are very rare on internal disks.)\n\n\nIf you need a more specific \"BIOS\" or \"EFI\" answer as to which you should use, you'll have to provide much more specific information about your setup.\n\nA: There is at least one good reason to install Linux on UEFI.\nIf you want to upgrade the firmware of your Linux computer, UEFI is required in many cases.\nFor example, the \"automatic\" firmware upgrade, that is integrated in the Gnome software manager requires UEFI. \nNo UEFI means firmware upgrades via LVFS/ fwupd / fwupdmgr will not work. Which, in most cases, means no firmware upgrades on Linux, at all. \n\nA:             Do you need to boot from a\n----------- partition more than 2 TiB in size?\n|                       |\nno                      yes\n|                       |\n|                       |\n|               Do you REALLY need to boot from a\n|               partition more than 2 TiB in size?\n|   ------------        |\n|   |                   yes\n|   no                  |\n|   |                   |\n|----           Find a different solution!\n|                       |\n|------------------------\n|   \nDon't use UEFI.\n\nHave I made my point clear?\nThere is no reason to use UEFI except if you want to boot Windows or if you want to boot from a partition more than 2 TiB is size. And you can always find a solution for the latter.\nUEFI brings a heck of a lot of disadvantages with it and no advantages. Don't use it.\nYou're basically giving away control of your own computer to corporations. Don't do that, that's a bad idea.\nYou also will have problems with using certain tools which cannot deal with GPT (the only improvement from bios to uefi is support of GPT, everything else is disadvantages and there's many of them). It's not that much of a problem if you use GPT on an external or secondary HDD, but don't boot from it.\nIf you don't have an HDD bigger than 2 TiB to boot from, there's no problem in the first place. If you do have an HDD with more than 2 TiB to boot from but don't need to have a partition bigger than 2 TiB and don't need to have the beginning of a partition after the first 2 TiB, you also don't need GPT and therefore no UEFI. (So having a 4 TiB HDD with some partitions in the beginning and the last 2 TiB filled with 1 2 TiB is fine and works without GPT.)\nAs already stated above: This only is about the HDD you boot from. If you have an SSD for booting (which of course can't be that big because such big SSDs don't exist) and only want to use GPT for data storage, that's all fine and you don't need UEFI to access them.\nThe problem that support for hardware often is needed in form of a firmware for the hardware and a driver for the OS isn't solved by UEFI. It could've been but it isn't. UEFI simply sucks.\n", "Q: How do I run programs in Ubuntu? More precisely, what does Ubuntu use instead of Windows' .exe files? For instance, in my last question I asked about Ruby 2.2.2. I want to know which file is the actual Ruby program and all I have is a vague notion of \"look in the bin folder\".\n\nA: Linux/Unix doesn't necessarily rely on the extensions like windows does. In other words, a file may already be an executable program. For instance, let's use which command that finds the actual binary files for programs and commands, on something like gnome-terminal.\n$ which gnome-terminal\n/usr/bin/gnome-terminal\n\nAs you can see, there's no extension. As far as scripting goes, many users like to add .sh and .py or even .awk ( which i do a lot ), but that's mostly for convenience.\nNow, if you have a program and you want to find its binary somewhere on the system, first thing you want to check is /bin and /usr/bin folder, on any Linux system.\nThere is however something similar to desktop shortcuts. In /usr/share/applications/ folder you can find tons of .desktop files. That's the second place I'd look into. Unless it's a program you've installed manually, not with Software Center or apt-get command, you can be 99% sure that there is a .desktop file for that program. Additionally , you can open those files with gedit or any text editor for that matter, and find Exec= line to see the actual path to the binary being executed.\nSo lets recap:\n\n\n*\n\n*use which command if you know the full command to find where it is stored\n\n*check /usr/bin/ and /bin\n\n*check /usr/share/applications\nAdditional note: in order to have a script or a binary file run, it also must have permissions set to x (executable) for the owner of the file, group, and/or other users. For instance, I've made a script called whiletest.sh. Let's find it's permissions by mixing ls -l and which command\nls -l $(which whiletest.sh )                                                                                                                     \n-rwxrwxr-x 1 xieerqi xieerqi 161 May 18 22:42 /home/xieerqi/bin/whiletest.sh\n\nSo as you can see, we have read-write-execute permissions for the owner(first 3), read-write-execute for the owner group (next 3 ), and read-execute but no write permissions for other users and groups. These executable permissions aren't given by default when you create a file. Initial permissions would be -rw-rw-r--, ie only read and write access for owner and group. To make any file executable, you'd need to run chmod 775 /path/to/file or chmod +x /path/to/file. Why two different ways ? You can think of the permissions in terms of binary numbers. So initial permissions -rw-rw-r-- can be read as 5 for owner (in binary 110, or read set, write set, execute reset), 5 for group, and 4  for others (binary 100, read set, others not set).\nFor more info on file permissions, you can check this tutorial from linux.com\nAdditional info about apt-get:  As requested in the comments, here's more info about apt-get . The apt-get command is used to install software through command line in terminal. This is what actually Software Center uses behind the scenes to install software. \nPersonally, I've not used Software Center in a long time, and mostly use apt-get like so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Search for a desired program with apt-cache search. For instance, apt-cache search text editor. If the output is long (and typically it is), I pipe the output to the paging program called less, like so. apt-cache search text editor | less.\n\n*Install desired software with sudo apt-get install program-name. For example, sudo apt-get install emacs . \n\n*Remove undesirable programs with sudo apt-get remove program-name (to just remove a program) or sudo apt-get purge program-name (to wipe out every config file as well as the program itself) . For instance, sudo apt-get remove emacs. \n\n*Frequently when you install something, additional packages are installed because a program needs them, but once the program removed , they might not be needed anymore. You can use sudo apt-get autoremove and sudo apt-get autoclean\n\n*If you just want the source code of the program, run sudo apt-get source program-name. For instance, sudo apt-get source xterm\nFor more things that you can do, check out the man-page for apt-get\n", "Q: Cannot get a meaningful response to the command 'gem list ' I know I have gems installed because the response to the command \n$ gem environment \nRUBYGEMS VERSION: 1.8.23\n\nOK, now I want to know which gems are installed, so I type:\n$ gem list\n*** LOCAL GEMS ***\n\nWhat does this mean, or hint at , \nand why doesn't the command return my list of gems?\n\nA: Oh, the header:\n*** LOCAL GEMS ***\nalways displays.

Here is the screenshot of GParted showing my current partition structure:\n\nSomewhere on AskUbuntu I read that unallocated space has to be inserted into the Extended partition.

Why don't you format the whole disk, divide your 300GB into 3 partitions only ..100gb each. I agree this is an overambitious partition configuration. I have 3 partitions 2 for windows and 1 for linux, I always use the 2nd NTFS as storage so that every time I have to reinstall virus prone windows I never loose any personal files. Lastly ext4 is the file format for ubuntu not ntfs windows (networking technology file systems), try change the file format first and then resize, you will also need a swap file for ubuntu a 4th partition sda4, your in gparted but you can also the install cd partition manager, while installing, formatting the whole drive may cause data loss, so off course back up to an external HDD first, but I guarantee you 100% reformatting always fixes everything..lol, your going to spend hours typing mnt commands when reformatting will have you up and running in 30 minutes\n\nA: Your partitioning scheme seems overambitious, but here goes. The structure of partitions on the disk has to be kept simple, since the BIOS has to be able to find something to boot. Thus, the restriction that you can only expand/move a partition to adjacent free space and cannot have fancy split partitions. Thus, if you MUST expand / (mounted on /dev/sda8), here is what to do:  \nMove /dev/sda5 54 GiB to the right, putting the free space between /dev/sda5 and /dev/sda6.  \nMove /dev/sda6 54 GiB to the right, putting the free space between /dev/sda6 and /dev/sda7.  \nMove /dev/sda7 54 GiB to the right, putting the free space between /dev/sda7 and /dev/sda8.  \nFinally, you can expand /dev/sda8 into the adjacent free space.\nThis will take a long time (do not do it on battery), and runs the risk of destroying ALL the data on /dev/sda5, /dev/sda6, /dev/sda7 and /dev/sda8. Not much of a risk if you are carefull, but I would be remiss if I did not suggest backup, Backup, BACKUP!\n", "Q: Can not install java jdk 8 I've installed ubunut 15.04 recently and I've tried to install java JDK 8 but I can not, and I don't know why.\nI have fallow all that commands:\nsudo apt-get install python-software-properties\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer\n\nAnd after that I checked my java version and I've got a error:\nroot@vlad-X550JX:/usr# java --version\nUnrecognized option: --version\nError: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.\nError: A fatal exception has occurred.

I am trying to make CUDA work on my computer and after 7 formats and about 36 hours I am out of any ideas. My problem is, whenever I try to install CUDA it comes with Nvidia driver 346.46. I install the driver, I reboot the computer , I set the CUDA, I make the samples files and run them, they all work perfectly. But as soon as I turn off the computer and try to startup again, I am stuck at splash screen. The \"getting stuck\" part happens so quickly, I had to reboot the computer about 50 times to just see what the problem was. Apperantly the system gets locked at \"Resolver State [OK]\". After this line it freezes and I can't do anything. I have troubleshooted the problem and it seems to be connected to graphics card driver. From what I read, I have to revert the graphics driver, delete everything related to nvidia and install xorg stuff (which I can't do since the computer freezes in 1-2 seconds as soon as I see the logo screen). \nWhat I understand from CUDA is, when it installs 346.46 driver, it takes place of Xorg driver. Because from the additional driver screen, the Xorg driver option is selected. When I run the terminal code however and from the Nvidia Settings screen, I can see that the computer is using the 346.46 driver. And I cannot change the driver from the additional driver screen as well. Whenever I click on say 331 driver it just instantly reverts back to 346. And as soon as I try to reboot the computer, the computer basically crashes and I have to install a clean Ubuntu, because I cannot see any kind of terminal nor any combination of key seems to open one. In the meanwhile I can perfectly use the 331 driver at the moment. I can change back to xorg, change to 331 back, turn off the computer, turn on. No problem at all. But as soon as I install 346 driver, everything goes nuts.\nMy graphics card is a gt740m, processors is an i7 and the computer is a laptop with abysmal integrated graphics card. \nThanks for reading this long post. I'll be glad if there is a possible way to make CUDA work.\n\nA: During install of the CUDA toolkit, when prompt, remember NOT to install OpenGL driver.\nhttps://chuanwen.wordpress.com/2015/07/19/run-cuda-on-ubuntu-14-04-2/\n", "Q: Change root username Beginner user here.\nI want to change root username to something else?\nIs that possible, and if yes - how to do it?\n\nA: Yes it is possible, but not recommended. The username root is not magical. The fact that it has a UID of 0 is what gives root its power. Tools like /bin/ls that translate between the UID value in a file's inode and a name (unless you /bin/ls -n) use the password database (See man nss;man nsswitch.conf) to do the translation. The getent command fetches entries:  \n $ getent passwd root  \n root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\n\n(See man 5 passwd;man shadow for info about the contents.)  \nSo, you could edit /etc/passwd, find the line with the UID of zero, and change the user name of root to some other value.  \nWhat do you suppose you have gained? Do you know of any program dumb enough to check for $USERNAME = \"root\" rather than$UID = 0`? The system sure doesn't.\n\nA: No, it is not possible. In Windows, you can have guests and admins. In Ubuntu, there are guests, admins and the root. And nobody can actually BE the root, only use root powers. So no, there is no way to change the root's name.\n", "Q: How do I make a file executale?

You can do this a port scan tool such as this. If there are problems check your ip again because probably you have dynamic ip and changing by some periods if it is fine or test result is fine probably at home u set dynamic ip .from your network connections set a static ip for yourself like here. And yo prevent somebody to get the very same ip as you reserve this ip on modem settings. Reserving an ip is quite simple find dhcp setting under your modem lets take yur modem is on 192.168.1.1 and you set for yourself 192.168.1.2 in this case in dhcp settings type 192.168.1.3 as startpoint if non of these works contact to your ISP in some countries some ports might be not allowed to open for example I was in Cyprus half a year ago and opening port 80 is forbidden there.\n--UPDATE--\nAs I understand as client from another computer you can connect but as server when you try to connect cannot see the page. This is a main problem unless you dont use proxy routers cannot route requests which goes out from itself into itself try to use a web proxy in this case probably it is gonna work. You cannot do anything about this as server you cannot connect to your own network without proxy\n", "Q: change 14.0.4 32 bit install to 14.0.4 64 bit I installed 14.0.4 32bit ubuntu, but I need install 14.0.4 64 bit. what's the best way to change to 64 bit OS\n\nA: You can install alongside 32 bit, just select to use the same partitions, and don't format the main partition.  You will keep both installs, and they will share files.  You will be given an option in GRUB for 'advanced options for Ubuntu', under which will be the various kernel versions.  One will be 32 bit, another will be 64 bit.  64 bit will be the default.\nI did this with 14.04 to 15.04.  There is no option to upgrade 14.04 to 15.04 without first upgrading to 14.10.  I just installed alongside, and didn't lose anything.  Not even configuration or newly installed apps.\n", "Q: Setting up an automated email forwarding system for a large set of email accounts Let's say I want people to send emails to my server and I want to forward them all to different email addresses. For example, I have a following mapping:\njohn@myserver.net => john.doe@someothermail.com\nmary@myserver.net => poppins@yetanothermail.com\nvlad@myserver.net => vlad@anotheranothermail.com\n...\ntom@myserver.net => tom@anothermail.com\n\nThis list may grow to a huge number and I want to be able to forward them all easily. I also want to let users easily configure so that they can set the mapping for themselves (Just like how you can easily set up forwarding on gmail, etc.)\nI currently have postfix on my server but it seems like with postfix I have to edit the config file and reload all the time and it doesn't sound scalable when I'm thinking of a huge list.\nWhat is the best way to achieve this? I don't necessarily have to go with postfix and can use entirely different system that fits this purpose if needed.\n\nA: Postfix supports a lot of lookup tables and you can use database lookup tables (mysql,pgsql or sqlite)to store such large lists and you need not reload postfix when using them. Say you have a table forwards in your postgres database with columns emailaddress and forwards.\nemailaddress         forwards\njohn@myserver.net    john.doe@someothermail.com\nmary@myserver.net    poppins@yetanothermail.com\nvlad@myserver.net    vlad@anotheranothermail.com\n\nand you can configure your postfix to use it.\n#/etc/postfix/main.cf\n#... other main.cf contents omitted\nvirtual_alias_domains = myserver.net\nvirtual_alias_maps = pgsql:/etc/postfix/pgsql_forwards.cf\n#...\n\nand the content of /etc/postfix/pgsql_forwards.cf should be something like\n#/etc/postfix/pgsql_forwards.cf\ndbname = emaildb\nhosts = db.example.net\nuser = emailuser\npassword = somerandompass\nquery = SELECT forwards FROM forwards where emailaddress='%s';\n\n\n\n*\n\n*But first ensure what all lookup tables are compiled with your postfix by running postconf -m. I have seen many using mysql.\n\n*And to enable your users to setup forwards themselves, you will have to give them some webapp that will update the database table used by postfix. \n\n\nHope that helps. \n", "Q: How do I create a new file in a folder owned by root?

How to?\nEDIT: I managed it using the information on this page: \n\nA: First, create the file, using the editor of your choice. Store it in a user directory, something in or under $HOME Check it to be sure it says what you think it says, and does what you want. Then, and only then:  \nsudo cp yourfile /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mouse-acceleration.conf\n\n\nA: Become root before creating the file or run the editor you're going to use to create the file as root.\nFor example:\nsudo -i gedit /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-mouse-acceleration.conf\n#paste in the file content, save it, you're done.\n\n\nA: if you simply want to change owner of a file you can use chown command\nas here it is told the usage is simply sudo chmod root filename\n", "Q: Ubuntu will not boot on Chromebook C720 I've recently installed Linux on my Chromebook, and it’s turning out to be a complete nightmare. It’s a Chromebook C720.\nMy first problem is that Ubuntu will not boot.

Whenever I use the sudo command in conjunction with some other request, I receive this error:\nsudo: unable to open /var/lib/sudo/user/tty1: No such file or directory.\n\nAnother example of this administrator issue is my being denied access to certain files. For example, when I type /etc/fstab, I get this lovely response:\n-bash: /etc/fstab: Permission denied\n\nAs you can see, it's one problem after another with this device.

I tried to encrypt file using this command:\nopenssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in $infile -out $outfile -pass file:$keyfile\n\nFor the same input file, Why the output files has different hashes.\n\nA: CBC requires an IV: the very first block of data should be random. It is sent with the data so that the recipient has what they need to decrypt the message. The IV for CBC should be uniformly random and unpredictable. The openssl enc command creates an IV with 8 fixed bytes and 8 random bytes (it should be 16 random bytes). When you encrypt the same message twice, the IV changes. (There's an option -nosalt to use a fixed IV, which is even worse for security and shouldn't be done unless the password was itself generated randomly for a single message.)\nAll non-broken modes of encryption have an IV or equivalent, so that encrypting the same message twice results in different ciphertexts. This is necessary, at least, so that an adversary cannot detect whether two encrypted messages have the same plaintext. Repeating the IV for distinct messages can open other attacks; for example, with CBC, a common prefix to two messages is visible in the ciphertext if the IV is reused. If you ever find that encrypting the same message twice leads to the same ciphertext, something is broken.\nDon't use the openssl command for serious work. It's meant only as a showcase of the library functions, and it's badly designed even for that. As we've seen, the enc command doesn't quite do things securely since its IV isn't as random as it should. A worse problem is the way the key is derived from the password: openssl enc uses a single round of MD5, which is bad — deriving a key from a password should use an intrinsically slow function (a key stretching function) to slow down brute force cracking attempts where the attacker tries likely passwords (dictionary words, 1337 variations, etc.).\nThe primary user-level encryption tool is GPG, available in Ubuntu in the gnupg or gnupg package. To encrypt a file with a password, use\ngpg -c filename\n\nYou'll get prompted for the passphrase. The encrypted file will be stored in filename.gpg. To decrypt, run gpg filename.gpg and enter the passphrase.\n\nA: (I think you accidentally added the -d decryption option in the command in your question.)\nThe encrypted files differ because of the random 64-bit cryptographic salt that OpenSSL generates and includes in each encrypted file by default. This can be disabled with the -nosalt option, but as the documentation in OpenSSL's man enc states, this is generally a very bad idea:\n\nThe -salt option should ALWAYS be used if the key is being derived from a password unless you want compatibility with\n         previous versions of OpenSSL and SSLeay.\nWithout the -salt option it is possible to perform efficient dictionary attacks on the password and to attack stream\n         cipher encrypted data. The reason for this is that without the salt the same password always generates the same\n         encryption key. When the salt is being used the first eight bytes of the encrypted data are reserved for the salt: it is\n         generated at random when encrypting a file and read from the encrypted file when it is decrypted.\n\n", "Q: How to install wipefs in Ubuntu?

I've attempted many installers. The only way I've been able to do it reliably is with Openstack Fuel. Using virt-manger, create one vm for Fuel. Install Fuel in to the VM. Two more vm, one for controller, and one for compute. Configure these two VM to DHCP boot from the fuel server. Use the Fuel web interface to configure an Fuel Environment.

Almost every time I get a software update, I see CUPS, or packages with cups in their names, being updated.\nIs that normal? It seems that this has been happening for years, regardless of the Ubuntu version I run. I've always been curious, as CUPS seems to be on fire, far more active than any other F/LOSS project.\n\nA: At a guess it is because it seems to have been purchased and developed by Apple for Mac and other Unix-like systems (including Linux).\nSince it is funded by a company — not grants, fund raising, etc., more money can be poured into its development than most open source projects.\nYou can find some more information on the CUPS Developer Guide and on the CUPS Wikipedia page.\n\nA: CUPS is an acronym for Common Unix Printing System. So when a new printer comes out, it needs to be added to the database (one portion of the update). If it uses the same commands as a previous printer from the manufacturer, then the drivers are already in the database, otherwise new drivers are needed (second portion of the update).\n", "Q: KDE Hotkey-Volumecontrol stopped working After installing a fresh Kubuntu (15.04) the hotkeys for volume-control were working out of the box.

These changes can be restricted to your external disk without too much difficulty, provided you pay attention during the installation process.\n\n*Install the boot loader. This can mean:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the install is in BIOS mode, code will be written to the MBR and/or to the partition you select, as well as to other location(s) on the disk.\n\n*If the install is in EFI mode, files will be written to the EFI System Partition (ESP) identified by the installer. An EFI-mode install will also modify the boot loader list maintained in NVRAM.\n\n\n\nThe type of installation you're suggesting makes controlling the boot loader installation difficult, since the Ubuntu installer's (Ubiquity's) tools for controlling boot loader location are a bit crude, particularly for EFI-mode installations. Unless you both know what you're doing and are very careful, you're likely to end up changing files on your internal hard disk. Most people who attempt this end up with GRUB partially installed on the computer's internal disk and partially on the external disk, meaning that the computer will fail to boot when you attempt to boot with the external disk unplugged.\nAlso, note that the boot mode is important. Your existing pre-installed Windows 8.1 is almost certainly in EFI mode. Installing Ubuntu in EFI mode is therefore advisable; however, be aware that the Ubuntu installation mode really only affects the boot loader. Thus, depending on how you do it, you might be able to install in BIOS mode (or on a BIOS-only computer), so long as you get an EFI-mode boot loader installed. (More on that shortly....)\nThere are basically two good ways to proceed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install to the external drive, but ensure that GRUB installs there, too, not to the internal drive. The best way to do this is to temporarily change the type code of the ESP on the internal disk, ensure that you've got an ESP on the external disk, and install normally in EFI mode. When you're done, you should change the type code of the internal ESP back to the right value and also copy EFI/ubuntu/ on the external disk's ESP to EFI/BOOT and rename shimx64.efi in that directory to bootx64.efi. This should make the external disk bootable like a USB drive. You'll be left with an altered NVRAM, but the entries will be automatically removed, or at least ignored. You'll have to use your firmware's boot manager to determine which OS to boot. A mistake could lead to the sort of problem I described, where GRUB will control everything and fail if you boot without the external disk plugged in. You'll then need to fix that problem by appropriate file juggling.\n\n*Launch the Ubuntu installation disk in its \"try before installing\" mode, open a Terminal, and then type ubiquity -b. This will cause the installer to install normally but to skip installing any boot loader. You'll have to correct this yourself by installing the boot loader of your choice. Semi-automated tools to install GRUB 2 exist, but are as likely to get it wrong as to get it right. The easiest solution is likely to be to install my own rEFInd from its .zip file by using the --usedefault option to install.sh, as in ./install.sh --usedefault /dev/sdb1 if your external disk's ESP is /dev/sdb1. Alternatively, since rEFInd doesn't rely on configuration files off the ESP, you can install it to your internal disk and the computer will still boot Windows when the external disk is unplugged, but rEFInd will mediate that boot process. You can install Ubuntu in either EFI or BIOS mode with this method. Note also that you might need to either disable Secure Boot or jump through extra hoops to install Shim if you use this method.\n\n\nIf you have a test/disposable computer, you can use it for your Ubuntu installation. That way, if something goes wrong, you won't have messed up the internal hard disk on your main computer, or its NVRAM entries.\nSorry these procedures are a bit sketchy; there are simply a lot of decisions you must make, and problems can be rather system-specific and difficult to predict.\n", "Q: Ubuntu SDK on Kubuntu I plan to switch from Windows to Linux long term. I just installed my first Kubuntu (since I like Qt) system in a VirtualBox VM hosted in Windows to get familiar with that system (and Linux in general).\nI am  developer and intended to look into Ubuntu-Phone development and I would like to try out the corresponding emulator. The website says I should install the Ubuntu SDK. Immediately the first beginner's questions arose (sorry, I think they are pretty stupid):\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any problem or disadvantage when installing the Ubuntu-SDK on a Kubuntu system (instead on Ubuntu) for developing Ubuntu-Phone software?\n\n*I found command lines that allow to install the Ubuntu SDK. However I first tried to find the SDK using the packet manager called \"Muon\". I could not find it there. What is the reason that I could not find the SDK in Muon?\n\n*What about developing native desktop software? Are there separate SDKs for Kubuntu and Ubuntu?\n\n*Will there ever be a Kubuntu-Phone system?\n\nA: *\n\n*Ubuntu has additional QML library: qt-components-ubuntu. There were some dependencies on Unity long time ago. But it should be ok now. I think that it is not very hard to run SDK even on something like Mac OS (don't know about emulators...).\n\n*No idea.\n\n*There is no significant difference between desktop and mobile. For mobile there is just a cross-compiler and additional packaging step. And an ARM executable for the mobile can be directly run on the desktop if qemu-user-static is installed.\n\n*For that we need to teach KDE to morph between desktop and mobile interfaces and port it to Mir.\n", "Q: Order in startup application preferences I have two tasks in startup application preferences:\n1.

I am trying to use the rsync command but I am getting \"permission denied\" because the pi user hasn't permission to write without the sudo command\nI am trying to move my apache2 folder from 10.0.2.2 to pi@10.0.2.21 with\nsudo rsync -av /etc/apache2 pi@10.0.2.21:/etc/\n\nSo the big question is, is there anyway to provide the rsync a sudo command for the pi user ? or somthing else without granting the pi user full access\n\nA: The easiest method when a root login is available is:\nrsync -av /etc/apache2 root@10.0.2.21:/etc/\n\nNote: there is no need for sudo rsync if all configuration files in /etc/apache2 are world-readable.\nIf you do not mind some additional interactive commands involving sudo on the pi, try this approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pack all files (files in /etc are generally small, so it should not be an issue to pack everything):\ntar -czC /etc apache2 | ssh pi@10.0.2.21 'cat > /tmp/apache2.tar.gz'\n\n\n*Uncompress all files on the pi:\nsudo tar -xzf /tmp/apache2.tar.gz -C /etc\n\nThere is a third possibility that involves configuring a rsync daemon, but this requires more effort and might be less secure since the wire protocol is unencrypted and may grant access to anyone who can connect to the daemon.\n\nA: Dear downvoter, the target is a raspberry pi and therefore we have an root user.\n\nYou can use the root user instead of pi. But before you need a password for the root user.\nOpen a ssh connection\nssh pi@10.0.2.21\n\nAnd set a root password\nsudo su -\npasswd\n\nNow you can use\nrsync -av /etc/apache2 root@10.0.2.21:/etc/\n\n", "Q: How can I fix phpMyAdmin, broken after Ubuntu update?

I've been having problems with bluetooth. I'm trying to connect to some August SE50 speakers. The computer's own bluetooth adapter does not work. I can pair with my speakers but it never establishes a stable connection.\nI have just done a complete reinstall of Ubuntu.\nRight now, I've got a Plugable 2.0 USB adapter in and it works perfectly. I have used this on this machine with ubuntu earlier this week but it randomly stopped working. Now, even though the USB dongle is working, I get the following two errors using dmesg | grep - blue:\nthinkpad_acpi: rfkill switch tpacpi_bluetooth_sw: radio is blocked\nhci0: BCM: patch brcm/BCM20702A0-0a5c-21e8.hcd not found\n\nLast time it all stopped working, I tried fixing the first error using this solution and I tried fixing the second using this solution. I also had an error message at one point with hci1 and a brcm patch, fixed with a slight alteration to the second solution (I just changed the .hcd filename to what dmseg said was missing). The error messages went away but the problem wasn't fixed.\nrfkill list shows the following and I've always made sure everything is unblocked:\n0: tpacpi_bluetooth_sw: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n1: phy0: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n2: hci0: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n3: hci1: Bluetooth\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\n\nI can't see why the USB adapted works after a clean install but then stops working seemingly randomly; and why the internal adapter never works. \nI suppose my main question is: is there any way of getting the computer's own adapter to work?\nIf not, is the USB dongle causing some kind of hardware conflict? Can I disable the computer's adapter altogether and just use the USB dongle?\nlsusb\n\n(without the dongle in)\nBus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub\nBus 005 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub\nBus 004 Device 002: ID 0483:2016 STMicroelectronics Fingerprint Reader\nBus 004 Device 003: ID 0a5c:201e Broadcom Corp.

Can anyone help me please? Note: I want to set the max size not the initial one. Thank you in advance.\n\nA: Note: this is probably not a good stackexchange community for this question. We tend to focus on Ubuntu-specific things here.\nIt's not really my area, but as far as I know, linux doesn't let you set (max) cwnd size directly. Instead, cwnd size is a function of write buffer size, which you can set by writing to /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem or per-socket with setsockopt. If you want really big cwnd sizes you need to set another option called 'window scaling' or something.

You can fix it, but really, look for a later version of the package which has been fixed.\n\nA: My guess would be that you have the basic C compiler installed, but not the headers for the standard library.  Try:\nsudo apt install libc6-dev\n\n[Edit: this produces similar symptoms, but wasn't the case here.  The CFLAGS answers appear to be correct.]\n\nA: I was having this exact same problem trying to install tivodecode on a base build of Linux Mint 17.3. I tried the:\n./configure DFLAGS=\"-O3\"\n\ncommand but with no effect. So I tried:\nsudo apt install libc6-dev\n\nto install the latest C headers. I tried the ./configure command again with no variables and all went well. The make and make install commands also completed successfully. My recommendation is to make sure the latest C headers are installed and then run your ./configure command.\n\nA: From the config.log:\nconfigure:3478: gcc -03   conftest.c  >&5  \ngcc: error: unrecognized command line option '-03'  \n\nThe option is -O3 with the letter O, not the number 0 (zero).

In earlier versions of Ubuntu, user-created launchers for the top panel were stored in the directory ~/.gnome2/panel2.d/default/launchers.  This is no longer the case in the current versions.  The Official Ubuntu Documentation at present lacks even the most basic information on this topic (the HowToAddaLauncher page \"needs updating to include the latest versions of Ubuntu\").\nIn Ubuntu 14.04 running Gnome Metacity Flashback, where are the files for the user-created panel lauchers located?  Can these simply be backed up and copied into the appropriate directory of a new installation of the OS to provide a customized top panel upon reboot?\n\nA: Custom application launchers are stored in ~/.config/gnome-panel/launchers. You can backup these launchers, but they won't be automatically added to panel if you copy launchers in that directory. You can drag&drop these launchers to panel.\nOtherwise panel settings are stored in gsettings/dconf under /org/gnome/gnome-panel. I don't know if there is easy way to backup/restore only gnome-panel settings.\n", "Q: Can I enable Bounce Keys for certain keys only? On  my laptop, I'm having  a persistent issue where keystrokes on the space bar are being  repeated. Having been through  a number  of  replacements, as well as trying multiple operating systems, I have judged that  the issue  is a hardware one, not a software one.\nFortunately, I learned that Ubuntu had a feature known as  bounce keys, which  would allow me to counteract the issue, as repeated keystrokes would be  filtered. \nHowever, enabling the solution for all keys sometimes filters keys that I don't  want to be filtered. For instance, when I type hello, I often press the two ls in quick succession, however sometimes one of the ls is filtered, which can  be quite annoying. I know I'll never need to press the space bar  twice  in such quick succession, and since I'm only having problems with the space bar, I only want to enable  bounce keys on the space  bar.\nSo, is it possible to only  enable bounce  keys on the space bar?\n\nA: I've found a solution for you, but it doesn't involve Bounce Keys. What I do here is to deactivate the space key/keyboard for a small time each time space is pressed. So here it goes:\nWe use xbindkeys to capture space bar press (in this case release) and xdotool to insert spaces. Install them if you don't have it on your system:\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys xdotool\n\nA xbindkeys config file should have appeared on your home folder by the name .xbindkeysrc else create one like this:\nxbindkeys -d > ~/.xbindkeysrc\n\nCopy the snippet and paste it into your .xbindkeysrc file. \n\"xdotool key KP_Space; xinput set-int-prop <kbd-id> \"Device Enabled\" 8 0; sleep .05 ; xinput set-int-prop <kbd-id> \"Device Enabled\" 8 1\"\n     m:0x0 + c:65 + Release\n    space\n\nHere <kbd-id> is the keyboard ID which can be found out by xinput command. Now you want to configure xbindkeys to start each time you start your computer.\nOpen /etc/rc.local and add the line xbindkeys before exit 0.\nYou are done. Open a terminal and type xbindkeys to start it for now. See if it does the job. If it did not catch the double spaces or characters after spaces are missing, adjust the delay in our command in ~/.xbindkeysrc accordingly and reboot.\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Xbindkeys - Arch Documentation\n\nA: xset - user preference utility for X\nr is to control autorepeat.\n\nxset -r 10\n\nwill disable autorepeat for the \"1\" key.\n\nxset r 10\n\nwill enable autorepeat for the \"1\" key.\n\nxset r [keycode]\n\nin my case keycode for space bar is 65 check for yours with \ncode: xev | grep -A2 --line-buffered '^KeyRelease' | sed -n '/keycode /s/^.*keycode \\([0-9]*\\).* (.*, \\(.*\\)).*$/\\1 \\2/p'\nStill if you need to change speed of keys you can also use rate parameter to it.\nAnd also add this command to your session start script file.\n", "Q: Zoom/pan/tilting webcam I have a logitech camera and I need a way to zoom the image. I tried lots of options but none game me that option. Can someone help? I would be more confortable with CLI tools by the way.\n\nA: Possible solution is to make a virtual camera that shows part of the image of the real camera.\nKernel module\nInstall:\nsudo apt-get install v4l2loopback-dkms\n\nTo activate virtual camera device, insert the module into kernel:\nsudo modprobe v4l2loopback\n\nTo deactivate:\nsudo modprobe -r v4l2loopback\n\nWhen module is active, it creates one more /dev/video device (for me it was /dev/video1).\nTo insert the module on boot, add a config file with the module name to /etc/modules-load.d/.\nTransformation\nAssuming that the main camera is on /dev/video0 and 200 pixels should be chopped from each side of the image:\ngst-launch v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! videocrop top=200 left=200 right=200 bottom=200 ! v4l2sink\n\nTo see the result from the virtual camera:\ngst-launch v4l2src device=/dev/video1 ! xvimagesink\n\nAnd it is usable as an ordinary v4l2 camera device in qTox, for example.\nTested on C270.\n", "Q: Weekday backup for /home and /etc I need to create an automatic backup in Ubuntu that runs from Monday to Friday at 1 am, backuping /home and /etc in another disk.\nDo you know how could I do that?\n\nA: If your PC runs all the time you can try (as root)\ncrontab -e\n\nto start the cron editor. Cron is a service that executes a script at a configured time or after a time intervall has ended.\nNow add a line similar to\n# m h dom mon dow    command\n  0 1   *   *  0      /root/mybackupscript.sh 2> /dev/null\n\nThen create the /root/mybackupscript.sh:\n#/bin/sh\n# Very simple backup script\nrsync -va /home /etc /media/<user>/anotherdisk\n\nThat's it principially.

Snap is a monopoly, it has been designed to be fully controlled by Canonical, even \"Branded Stores\" have to be on their servers.\nPrivate snaps also must be registered on their store so you will always be tied to their censorship and downtimes.\nThere was an alternative (https://github.com/noise/snapstore) but Canonical modified Snap to make it harder to work (ex: you can't create Ubuntu Core images with snap packages that aren't registered on their store, etc..).\nI recommend you to avoid snap & ubuntu core and try any other alternative like Flatpak or AppImage.\n", "Q: help to determine right path for site directory apache2 This is my .conf file\n  <VirtualHost 192.168.1.10:80>\n    ServerName  test.com\n        ServerAdmin admin@test.com\n        ServerAlias www.test.com\n        DocumentRoot /var/www/test.com\n    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log\n    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined\n</VirtualHost>\n\nNow it should after typing test.com it go directly to test.com directory , but it's show up this page\nIndex of /\n[ICO]   Name    Last modified   Size    Description\n[DIR]   test.com/   2015-07-12 23:10    -    \n[DIR]   test22.com/ 2015-07-12 22:55    -    \nApache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu) Server at test.com Port 80\n\nwhy this happen while i defined where test.com have to access in this line.\nDocumentRoot /var/www/test.com\n\nIt's should show only the content of test.com directory not all directories , this is my problem :/\nSo\nI need this domain test.com access only this directory in this path\nDocumentRoot /var/www/test.com\n\n\nA: Since you tell us that you've made a virtualhost and the domain links to it this means there's not much wrong.

The motherboard has an Intel Q87 chipset and an Intel I217-LM Gigabit Ethernet chip. \nThe Ethernet works fine under Windows 7. It also works when I live-boot Knoppix 7.4.2. But when I install Ubuntu 15.04 from DVD (downloaded from Canonical) the install went OK but I could not get the Ethernet to work. Using \"lspci\" shows that Linux recognizes the device.\nIf I go into Settings and say to use DHCP for IPv4 (which is what my workplace wants), the icon in the upper right corner of the screen keeps pulsating as if it is trying to connect, and eventually gives up. If I set the IP address, netmask, gateway, and DNS to the specific values which DHCP returns to Windows 7, then ipconfig shows all the right values, but trying to do anything I still get the message that the network is unreachable.\nI tried installing the e1000e driver downloaded from Intel and the installation did not give any error messages, but the driver does not appear in the correct directory. I do the insmod and again no error message, but still the NIC does not work. The documentation for the Intel driver says it is for kernel 2.4 and 2.6, and Ubuntu is at kernel 3.19, so I wonder if the extra driver is even necessary.\nAccording to Dell and Canonical, the Optiplex 9020 is compatible with Ubuntu 12.04, so I downloaded that from Canonical and have the same problem. Same with Ubuntu 14.04 and the latest Fedora.\nSo, what I am looking for is a Linux distro I can install that does work on this hardware (Knoppix does this, but I was hoping for a more widely-used distro). Or I would like a way to get Ubuntu to work; and if Ubuntu can be patched, the best way to do that. Without a working network I cannot install updates, but since the system is bootable in Windows I can download files to a separate partition on the boot drive (or to USB) and access those after installation.\nI have access to other Linux and Windows machines as needed. I can also probably find an Ethernet card I can plug into one of the expansion slots and use that temporarily.

Since then I've reinstalled 12.04. Recently I tried to restore the Documents directory via 'Restore missing files', and the scan came up empty. Restoring everything from the backup works, but there's a giant chunk of useless information on it that I don't need. Is there any troubleshooting for this, or maybe a way to exclude a folder when I restore? Or any other way to do this? Backup is located on an external hard drive.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Déjà Dup is a file back-up program that is quite easy to use and does what 95% of users need 99% of the time.\nHowever, it is not the most intelligent back-up solution around.  As you re-installed your system and you have a different host name and user name, Déjà Dup cannot find the files the new user is looking for…\nTherefore, you have to restore all files of a different host from a different user to a different location on the new host/user (very logical when you know about it). Then just copy the needed files over from the total restore to the new location (~/Documents) and delete the total restore.\nDon't kill the messenger! ;-)\n", "Q: Chrome indicator not being displayed in the system tray anymore I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 with Unity front end.

When the file path is displayed certain letters (like 'F') are missing in the path in terminal. It was corrected when the Use system fixed width font was unchecked in the profile preferences. Why does this happen?\n\nA: Are you are using truetype fonts when the terminal is expecting monospaced?\nHere are some thoughts that need be considered so as to understand why this is the case, please forgive me if this is common knowledge to you but it springs to my mind in response to your query.\nMost consoles today are simulations: Back in the days when terminals were the interface with main frame computers, the graphical output was far less of a concern than it is today, there was simply neither the power nor the inclination for fancy fonts. Typesetting had not yet come into consideration. Above anything else, computing resources were far to sparse to implement such graphical niceties.\nThe structure of the console is essentially a matrix; a grid of rows and columns that are compiled in buffers; think perhaps of shelves with compartments all of the same size so that all of the shelves always have the same length.\nNow for this to function when each letter fills a single box on a shelf or in a grid; the individual characters must be of equal width; If they are any wider than the box they will either not be displayed at all, or, they will be displayed incorrectly; This is why a terminal needs \"monospaced\" fonts.\nYou might think of it this way; the terminal is fundamentally structured by the fonts themselves, they are its building blocks. When you change the font the terminal size also changes.\nIn more powerful machines we find a bitmap outputs or vector, in which pixels or and coordinates are the constructors essentially replacing the font as the basic element with dots. When this is the case; fonts with different widths can be used.\n", "Q: error about make I would like to use DDC card 1553-MIL-STD on Ubuntu 15.04.\nWhen making the project, I have the following error.

It probably is exFat you need (Windows will silently format it into exFat and call it fat32) exFat is not supported in gParted.\nfat32 is obsolete. Prone to filesystem errors and it is slow. \n\nI have no trouble creating a 6TiB partition using ext4 instead of fat32 but since I want to access the disk from both ubuntu and windows I would rather use fat32.\n\nEver heard of NTFS? Is supported by both Windows and Ubuntu (Linux in general even).\n\nA: According to Wikipedia, the maximum size of FAT32 on a disk with 512-byte sectors is 2TB. Taking that literally, it works out to 1.8TiB; but I suspect 2TiB was actually meant. Either way, that's still larger than what you're getting, but it's at least in the same ballpark. It could be that mkdosfs and related tools in Linux have a bug or intentional limit that's a bit lower than the technical limit in FAT; or the Wikipedia article might be wrong.\nWhat is the intended purpose of this partition? Chances are some other filesystem would be a better choice. If you intend to share it with Windows, NTFS is a good option. For sharing with OS X, I'd go with HFS+. For Linux-only use, use a Linux-specific filesystem, such as ext4fs or XFS. (Do not use NTFS for a Linux-only application; there are no useful NTFS repair tools in Linux, so when the filesystem develops problems, you'll have no way to fix them.) If you really must use FAT, you'll need to use multiple partitions and spread your files across them.\nAs a side note, fdisk is the wrong tool to use to display GPT data; you should use gdisk or parted instead. (This has changed with recent versions of fdisk, but Ubuntu 14.04 still uses an old GPT-unaware version of fdisk.)\n", "Q: Substitute for Codonics Clarity Viewer?

I rsync my disk live, I mean I'm making a rsync backup of the machine I'm using.\nIs it ok, safe, wise ? or very not ?\nIs it risky, if I want to use this backup for restoring or cloning then ?\n\nA: Slightly different opinion to Jos... I'd say that if you need an active backup, use a filesystem that allows snapshots, like BTRFS. Its copy-on-write behaviour allows for instant snapshots of a system, which you can then create a remote backup with.\nThat still has the same problems as other active backup strategies though: if it isn't on the disk, it's not going to get backed up. Some applications buffer their work in memory before writing to disk (and need poking to write). Which of these really apply to you is debatable.\nBut there isn't anything inherently unsafe about copying files off a rw-mounted partition. Even one with a clunky old format.\n\nA: rsync does not maintain file consistency like e.g. a database does; a file is copied as it is at the time rsync opens it, and as rsync can run for very long times, the file may have been changed since the time you started rsync. Whether this is \"risky\" is up to your assessment. \nOne of the ways to mitigate this risk is to run the same rsync command twice (or more) in a row, to keep track of any changes that were made since the start of the command. But if you absolutely need to maintain file consistency, you should mount the disk read-only for the duration of the rsync process.\n", "Q: Disable desktop switching with the scroll wheel in Kubuntu?

Let me answer this in 3 parts.\nFirstly following the approach you've taken, something very strange is going on with your partition table.  In my experience when you 'grow' a physical disk (normally by block copying from one small real disk to a larger one), the partition table needs recreating, as even with the same disk parameters, you'll have alignment issues.  That said, I don't see why fdisk can't recreate a new partition table, if the disk has actually grown (as would happen in a real disk).\nSecondly, LVM was created to abstract between the physical drives and partitions, and the volumes contained on them.  Hence when using a virtual machine, without the problem of physical space (normally when upgrading a real disk, you do get rid of the old one), you can just create a new 11Gb virtual disk, and join it to your volume, without having to go through the grief of messing with your old vmfs file.  \nIf you're intent on the approach you're taking, something has clearly gone wrong.  As @daniel suggested, try rebooting, but personally, I'd consider creating a new image, with a new set of partitions and volumes, and copying everything across.  What time you spend in copying, you'll save from trying to figure out how you managed to get your partition table out of order.  \n", "Q: Check if Ubuntu is being installed on VM I am trying to automate ubuntu installation from a network repository. I am now succesfully able to configure the iso image and it does the installation automatically.\nMy requirement:\nI would like to know if there is a method in the initial installation stage of ubuntu, where I can know if the OS being installed on virtualbox or a physical desktop. I want this check to be performed as I want to automate the installation of virtualbox guest addition if the installation is being performed on a virtualbox.\nIf any one here have any experience with the same, please share your answers.\n\nA: You can use virt-what to detect whether you are running on bare-metal or some hypervisor.\n", "Q: Western Digital portable hard drive Is there any software for using the WD 1TB My Passport Ultra that runs in Ubuntu?\n\nA: If you mean the smartware one-click backup: no. The other smartware utilities are Windows tools that have an equivalent option in Linux (like the SMART toolset). There is a 3rd tools for security where you can password protect the disk. That is possible using encryption but it will not be a 1-click solution.\nYou also need to remove the hidden partitions on it for it to be mountable in Linux. Requires a firmware update (from Windows) and then you can use Smartware to remove those partitions (not sure if this applies to others than the WDBY8L0020BBK-01). \n\nA: No need.  Just plug the drive in a USB port and you can start using it (at least that is how it worked for me).  If you want to have specific partitions, you can do that as well, using Gparted.  \n", "Q: Speeding up ubuntu machine Does below command improved performance of the machine:\nsudo sync && echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\nI know this is for freeing RAM. Please guide\n\nA: No, it just dumps a load of stuff (slab objects and pagecache) from the system cache.\nIf your system is out of memory (and I mean: deep into swap usage, nothing free, hard disk churning) then yes, this might help... But not as much as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Buying more RAM, it isn't expensive or hard to fit.\n\n*Closing something that's using lots of memory (or tabs from a browser).\n\n*Using something faster for swap space (eg SSD)\n\n*Compressing swap\nSo while it may work for a few seconds, if you have something rampaging all over your RAM, you'd do better just to close it, or buy it more RAM with which to rampage over. Freeing up inode and page cache isn't going to help you for long.\n\nA: No, see How do I clean or disable the memory cache? for an indepth answer. \nCache is there to be used and to speed things up. So Linux makes full use of caching. If you do this it will takes seconds for  the cache to be filled up again.\nAdding hardware to your system would be more efficient (depending on what triggered your question it  might be memory or a better hard disk).\n\nA: You can also write command as:\necho 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n\nThe above command will free pagecache, dentries and inodes.\nAnd\nsudo sync\n\nis used to  to make sure all cached objects are freed as dirty objects are not free-able and the echo operation is non-destructive.\n", "Q: Samba: Mac cannot access share?

My computer is custom built so it is NOT UEFI based. When I open Disk Management in Windows 7, there's a green box around my C drive (I have managed to remove it now using a partitioning tool). People have told me that it's because it's a logical partition and I have more than 4 primary, which is wrong. I have 1 (System reserved) which is primary, 1 unallocated for Ubuntu 14.04.2 and my C drive. Is this why Ubuntu is not recognizing my Windows 7 install? I would greatly appreciate any help!\n!\n\nA: \nMy computer is custom built so it is NOT UEFI based.\n\nThis logic is flawed. Most motherboards introduced since mid-2011 are UEFI-based. Most of these motherboards also provide a Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which is essentially a BIOS emulator -- a CSM enables an EFI-based computer to boot using BIOS-mode boot loaders, much like WINE enables Linux to run Windows binaries. Your system might or might not be using BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode booting for your Windows installation, but if the computer is newer than mid-2011, it almost certainly is UEFI-based.\nTo determine your Windows boot mode, look at the partition table type. If it uses the Master Boot Record (MBR), the computer is booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode; if it uses the newer GUID Partition Table (GPT), it's booting in EFI/UEFI mode. You can check this detail using parted in an Ubuntu installer; open a Terminal and type:\n$ sudo parted /dev/sda print | grep Table\nPartition Table: gpt\n\nThis example shows a GPT disk; an MBR disk will show up as Partition Table: msdos. If parted complains about a missing GPT protective partition (I don't recall the exact wording of this complaint), then you probably have a partition table inconsistency (described later).\nAs to the main problem, most complaints that the Ubuntu installer \"doesn't detect Windows\" actually mean that the installer isn't presenting an \"install alongside\" option. This can happen for any number of reasons, and in most cases you must use the \"Something Else\" option instead. I recommend you read the following questions and answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Install alongside\" option missing. How do I install Ubuntu beside Windows using \"Something Else\"?\n\n*How to use manual partitioning during installation?\nNote that you should install Ubuntu in the same boot mode (BIOS vs. EFI) as used by Windows. As the Ghostbusters would say, don't cross the streams! You can check the boot mode of the Ubuntu installer by dropping to a shell and looking for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you've booted in EFI mode; if it's absent, you've booted in BIOS mode.\nAnother possibility is that your disk uses to use GPT but was converted to use MBR by the Windows installer or some other GPT-unaware tool. In this case, the disk will appear to be completely unpartitioned to the Ubuntu installer. If this is your problem, you must wipe the stray GPT data. This is most easily done with fixparts, which is part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu:\nsudo fixparts /dev/sda\n\nSee this question and answers or my official FixParts documentation for more details. (I'm the author of FixParts.)\n\nA: What do you mean green box? can you be more specific? If it is not uefi mode, your disk should be MBR disk, which won't allow you to have more than 4 primary partitions.you will not have the option to convert to basic disk in disk management if it is a dynamic disk unless you delete all volumes on it. You can use third party software, such as AOMEI Partition Assistant, to convert dynamic disk to basic disk without data loss.I think this should be the cause.\n", "Q: install printer hp i when click on Print test page , dose'nt work , and when \nsudo hp-setup\ni get error :\nengmmrj@engmmrj-MS-7592:~$ sudo hp-setup\n\nHP Linux Imaging and Printing System (ver. 3.15.2)\nPrinter/Fax Setup Utility ver. 9.0\n\nCopyright (c) 2001-15 Hewlett-Packard Development Company, LP\nThis software comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to distribute it\nunder certain conditions.

It will list your outputs and show the name of the connected output.\nYou can map the command to a keyboard shortcut using XFCE Application Shortcuts found in the settings manager or you can use a program like xbindkeys which does the same thing.

You can change the confinement settings for your app, but this may not be accepted in the app store.  You could also give up on accessing these files directly and importing them through the content hub.  Details follow:\n1) Importing files through the Content Hub\nThe Content Hub provides a mechanism for transferring files from one application silo to another.  It can be used in a number of different ways, but you'd want to request an import of type documents.  Another app that can act as a source of documents will open and present a list of documents.  After the user selects one (or more), your application resumes and receives a signal with information on the documents, which have been copied to a location where you can access them.\nOf course, most other applications are also subject to application confinement issues that keep them from accessing ~/Documents.  However, the Document Viewer and File Manager are treated specially and given access to these files.  Both can act as Content Hub sources for documents.  Do note that the Document Viewer only supports some types of files.  The File Manager will export any type of file as a document, but it isn't installed by default.\n(By the way, the same sort of mechanism allows the music app access to files in ~/Music.  I find this decision to special-case the default apps rather problematic, not least of all because it means their code is useless for app authors to study.)\nI've yet to find a good tutorial for using the Content Hub.  Instead, I'll post some code I wrote while trying to understand the Content Hub myself.  It lets you import documents either from the default provider or from one selected from the \"ContentPeerPicker\".\nmanifest.json\n{\n    \"name\": \"chtest.rschroll\",\n    \"architecture\": \"all\",\n    \"title\": \"chtest\",\n    \"hooks\": {\n        \"chtest\": {\n            \"apparmor\": \"chtest.apparmor\",\n            \"desktop\":  \"chtest.desktop\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"version\": \"0.1\",\n    \"framework\" : \"ubuntu-sdk-14.10\"\n}\n\nchtest.apparmor\n{\n    \"policy_groups\": [\n        \"networking\",\n        \"webview\",\n        \"content_exchange\"\n    ],\n    \"policy_version\": 1.2\n}\n\nmain.qml\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 0.1\nimport Ubuntu.Components.ListItems 0.1 as ListItem\nimport Ubuntu.Components.Popups 0.1\nimport Ubuntu.Content 0.1\n\nMainView {\n    id: mainView\n    applicationName: \"chtest.rschroll\"\n\n    width: units.gu(100)\n    height: units.gu(75)\n\n    PageStack {\n        id: pageStack\n        Component.onCompleted: pageStack.push(root)\n\n        Page {\n            id: root\n            title: i18n.tr(\"Import Content...\")\n            visible: false\n\n            property var activeTransfer\n\n            Column {\n                anchors.fill: parent\n                spacing: units.gu(2)\n                Row {\n                    height: units.gu(6)\n                    anchors {\n                        left: parent.left\n                        right: parent.right\n                        horizontalCenter: parent.horizontalCenter\n                    }\n                    spacing: units.gu(3)\n                    Button {\n                        text: i18n.tr(\"...

For example, to give your app read access to ~/Documents, you would add to your app armor JSON file the line\n\"read_path\": [\"@{HOME}/Documents/\"]\n\nThis will prevent your app from being automatically approved when you submit it to the official app store.  Instead, a human will have to look at it and decide whether to approve your application or not.  Sometimes they will (Log Viewer).  Sometimes they won't (my own ebook reader, Beru).  I haven't found any explanation as to why some apps are accepted and others aren't.\nIf you don't feel like gambling with the reviewer, or if you gamble and lose, you can submit your app to the OpenStore, which publishes apps that cannot be published in the official store.\n\nA: Use the source: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~music-app-dev/music-app/refactor/files\napparmor.json there is:\n{\n    \"policy_version\": 1.3,\n    \"policy_groups\": [\n        \"audio\",\n        \"content_exchange\",\n        \"music_files_read\",\n        \"networking\",\n        \"usermetrics\"\n    ],\n    \"read_path\": [\n        \"@{HOME}/.cache/media-art/\",\n        \"@{HOME}/.cache/mediascanner-2.0/\",\n        \"/media/*/*/\"\n    ],\n    \"write_path\": [\n        \"@{HOME}/Music/Imported/\"\n    ]\n}\n\n", "Q: MaaS automated provisioning of ESXi Is there a way in MaaS to automate the provisioning of an ESXi bare metal host.\nJust like I want to be able to deploy Ubuntu/CentOS/Windows I would also like to be able to deploy ESXi and automatically to then add them to the ESXi cluster automatically.\n\nA: MAAS does not currently support deployment of ESXi onto bare metal; the simplest way to achieve that goal may be to use vSphere's Auto Deploy tooling, as described in this blog post.\nHaving said that, MAAS now includes built-in support for power control of /VMs/ running on top of an already-deployed vSphere/ESXi; see \"How to configure MAAS to be able to boot virtual machines via VMware type\" for details.\n(We used to support ESXi via a virsh solution, as outlined in this blog post, but that's been superseded by the native support.)\n", "Q: Is sudo -i less secure than pkexec? I just heard that it isn't recommended to use sudo -i on GUI programs - because it's less secure.\nIs there any truth here - is there an advantage to this:\nsudo -i gedit /random/file.name\n\nover\npkexec gedit /random/file.name\n\nI used to use gksudo, but that's been phased out, so now I use sudo -i to prevent root owning files in my home area. But should I really be using pkexec?\nHere is a reason:\n\nThe environment that PROGRAM will run [in], will be set to a minimal known and safe environment in order to avoid injecting code through LD_LIBRARY_PATH or similar mechanisms. In addition the PKEXEC_UID environment variable is set to the user id of the process invoking pkexec.\n\n\nA: I think the security concern you are referring to comes from the fact that if you use sudo, with or without the -i, you have an active permission to run sudo commands, for 5 minutes. If you were to do sudo vim /file.txt then leave, your computer unattended the sudo session would still be active. someone could come along and type sudo rm /file.txt or worse. \npkexec will prompt you for a password every-time, which would seem a little more secure. \nI think Elementary OS is intended for schools, where the physical environment shouldn’t be considered secure. Students may well show up at your desk moments after you leave.  Comparatively, in my Business office, where only 3 folks have the key, and my computer is moderately secure in the physical sense, I'm less concerned with untrusted individuals running in and using my PC unsupervised. If I run sudo command, then leave, I'm assuming no one will come in and give malicious sudo commands.\nI make no claim to be a security expert, but I think that is what the elementary OS folks are thinking.\n", "Q: Problem launching parole after upgrading to vivd (clutter-critical error) After upgrading to the most recent version of xubuntu, I can no longer launch parole.

How can I do this?\n\nA: You do realize that you can start a program from the terminal.  Anyway, according to the Lubuntu documentation https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/Keyboard#Create_New_Keyboard_shortcuts \n\nThere is no automatic way to create new keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys\n  in lubuntu. You will either have to edit Lubuntu's openbox\n  configuration file (~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml) and edit, or\n  alternatively install xbindkeys.\nObkey will edit the keyboard parts of your Openbox configuration file\n  for you. Download the .tar.gz and unarchive it. After unpacking the\n  tar.gz, open a command line in the new folder and run obkey like this:\n  ./obkey ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml Hint: back up your config\n  file.

It does everything the gnome-screensaver screenlock does, except that the unlock menu is ugly. It also keeps signal going to your monitors. It's not exactly what you want, but it might work.

The possible downside is that you easily get carried away a bit by a project if it is nice to work on...\nThat might be the case with the script below :). While I would have preferred to add a detailed explanation on how it works \"under the hood\", this is a \"ready to use\" solution. Although I added some commentary lines, it is hard to give a simple inside explanation on the code. It seems however to be close to what you are looking for. \nWhat it is\nThe script is a purely text-based solution to list all opened, \"normal\" application windows (and raise a chosen one), but it has a number of options:\n\n\n*\n\n*list the windows, sorted by window name:\nRun with the command:\npython3 <script> -win\n\n\ntype the first character(s) of the sought window and press return to bring the window to front.\n\n*list the windows, sorted by application:\nRun with the command:\npython3 <script> -app\n\n\n\n*list the windows, sorted by workspace:\nRun with the command:\npython3 <script> -ws\n\n\nAs you can see, the displayed columns are: Window name, Application, Workspace. The pre- set sorted column is always the first one.\nFuzzy?\nTo select an item from the list, simply type the first character.

I wanted to hide stderr, so I tried this:\nmain 2>/dev/null \n\nWhich works, per se, I'm able to give input, and the broken pipe errors are as good as gone. However, apparently this method is how password entry works, because it mutes my input. I cannot see what I am typing.\nIs it possible to redirect the streams in such a way that I can mute stderr without muting the input?  I'm guessing read is using stderr to deliver the prompt, which might make this impossible, but it doesn't hurt to ask.\nFor the sake of argument, the script is designed to run in said environment, and I can't simply change to a different one.\n\nAs for main, it's a function that handles I/O with the user and calls other functions. Here's a simplified version:\nmain(){\n  while true; do\n    get_input $(get_completions)\n    [ $choice == \"d\" ] && fn_delete; continue\n    [ $choice == \"vwr\" ] && fn_change_vwr_command; continue\n    [ ... ]\n  done\n}\n\nIt works fine by itself. It's when I run main 2>/dev/null that the errors go away and my input is muted.\n\nEdit\nThis has been solved. The fix is to redirect read's stderr to its stdout with 2>&1. \nSee, this is why I like to make a single \"input-getter\" function whenever dealing with user input. For me, implementing the aforementioned patch was as simple as editing a single line in get_input()\n\nA: You can redirect read's stderr to stdout:\nread -p \"Input: \" x 2>&1\n\nscript.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\nread -p \"Input: \" x 2>&1\n\n\n", "Q: Problem with login after update I have just re-installed twice Ubuntu because of this problem, I'm only able to see the login screen when I use recovery mode and select File System Check.\nIn other case I just hear the start sound but I can't see anything on my screen, it still works the terminal because I can press Ctrl+Alt+F1 and reboot the system, but I can't see that on the screen, unless as I said using the recovery mode options.\nI'm sure it happened after the update because I had been rebooting after any install or copying a file from a USB flash drive and I wasn't seeing any problem before I updated.\nI also remember that there was a package that was just downloaded 70% and it automatically changed to another package and I'm not sure it downloaded and installed correctly the package.\nBefore re-installing, I was not sure about the problem and I even tried configurating gdm and didn't work.\n\nA: My problem is very same to your problem, and I solved it this way:.\n\n\n*\n\n*pressed Ctrl+Alt+F1\n\n*sudo rm /home/<username>/.Xauthority\n\n*sudo apt-get install --reinstall xorg && sudo reboot. \nIn this step you may see the following packages have unmet dependencies.

The trailing nomenclature is added to keep track of the history of the package.\n\n\n*\n\n*1.0.1f: this is plainly the version of OpenSSL included in the package;\n\n*1: this is the Debian version of the package; 0 would have meant that the package was not present in Debian and that the package was added to Ubuntu by Canonical; its absence would have meant that the package was added by Debian itself, rather than deriving from an upstream;\n\n*ubuntu: this means that the package has been updated from the Debian version of the package; it's absence would have meant that the package wasn't updated from the Debian version of the package (i.e. that the Debian package was included directly without modifications);\n\n*9.8: this is the version of the Ubuntu package\n\n\nSo openssl-1.0.1f-1ubuntu9.8 is revision 9.8 of the openssl Ubuntu package, which is based on revision 1 of the openssl Debian package, and which contains OpenSSL 1.0.1f.\nYou can find more information on the Debian packages' version numbering here or by running the command man 5 deb-version.\n", "Q: Uninstalling Ubuntu on Chromebook Look, this whole Ubuntu thing has turned out to be a disaster catastrophic.

Win8), I installed Ubuntu (had to use the  nomodeset parameter). I'm using the standard partitions created by Ubuntu itself, the only difference is that it's installed on /dev/sdb since that one is the SSD. ( /dev/sda is 1TB, partitioned ext4 by myself )\nUnfortunately directly after rebooting (maybe 2 seconds) the laptop get's stuck at a simple purple background screen that I read about here sometimes already. It doesn't respond to any keystrokes except ctrl+alt+delete for reboot.\nThere is only a very short moment between the initialization of the reboot and the purple screen, but after some attempts I managed to get into grub by hitting shift like a maniac:\n- replacing quiet splash or $linux_gfx_mode with nomodeset doesn't seem to change anything, it's still stuck\n- before that I tried to edit nomodeset into the grub file and also created the file again via the live-CD, without any results \n- \"Fast Boot\" and \"Launch CSM\" is disabled in the BIOS\n- however only for the optical drive the BIOS says that the boot option is \"UEFI: long drivename\", the other options are \"ubuntu (PO: Samsung ...)\"\nSystem specs:\nIntel HM87 (Lynx Point) Mainboard\nIntel i7-4720HQ (4x2,6Ghz)\nGeforce GTX 980M (4GB VRAM)\n32GB RAM (4x8GB)  \nI would suspect that this has to do with the graphics driver not loading correctly, since I had to use nomodeset for the installation or maybe with the fact that Ubuntu is installed on /dev/sdb and somehow fails to load?

I followed the instructions from the guy on YouTube to the letter. His first instruction was to download iTunes 7.2 which I in fact did, but when I try to install that file to my Ubuntu outright I keep getting the pop up  \"The iTunes folder cannot be found or created\".  \nI've worked on this watching multiple videos only to fail miserably, I have iPhone 4S but I do not have Windows OS installed on my PC in order to put music on my iPhone, I am only running Ubuntu  14.10 LTS at this very moment. \n\nA: Quote from Top 5 iTunes Alternatives On Ubuntu 14.04 on ubuntufree.com:\n\nIs it possible to run iTunes on Ubuntu ?\nNo, you unfortunately can NOT run iTunes on Ubuntu or any other Linux\ndistro. People will tell you there are weird ways to get iTunes\nrunning in Ubuntu, but I’ve never seen anyone successfully do it or\ngive instructions that someone else could follow to successfully run\niTunes in Ubuntu. Apple simply refuses to make a working iTunes\nversion for Ubuntu at this time. So rather than spend energy looking\nfor it, you'd better download music manager similiar to iTunes.\n1. Rhythmbox\n\nBeing the default music player on Ubuntu, Rhythmbox is considered to\nbe the most stable, yet most powerful music player around. With a user\ninterface similar to iTunes, this free application not only lets you\nlisten to your favorite music but also lets you enjoy podcasts and\nradio as well. Furthermore, it lets you create playlists so that you\nwon’t have to look for your favorite songs every single time.\nOne of the biggest advantages that Rhythmbox has over other media\nplayers is it recognizes most of the popular devices like iPhone,\niPod, and even the latest Android phones. This means that you can\nconnect your device to your computer and transfer your favorite music\nto it directly from Rhythmbox. If you’re using the latest version of\nUbuntu, Rhythmbox comes pre-installed.\n2. Banshee\n\nBanshee is another free media player that has an interface that is\nsimilar to iTunes. Like iTunes, it can play music, movies, and\naudiobooks as well. Once installed, all you have to do is add your\nmedia to its library and start search for your favorite tracks. If you\nwant to buy new tracks, Banshee takes care of that too by integrating\nwith Amazon’s online music store. Though not updated as often as\nRhythmbox, Banshee remains one of the most popular players iTunes\nlovers flock to.\n3. Amarok\n\nUnlike Rhythmbox or Banshee, doesn’t have an interface similar to\niTunes(Which is not a bad thing!). Instead, it comes with a simple\nlayout that makes discovering and playing your music easier. Once\ninstalled, you’ll be able to search, manage, and listen to your\nfavorite music just like you used to on iTunes. The application comes\nwith playing statistics, file tracking, dynamic playlists, and many\nother features that make it a really good alternative to Apple’s\nfamous music player.\n[...]\n\n\nA: Transferring music and access to files on the device is implemented through libimobiledevice (Wiki article) in various applications on Ubuntu. You don't need iTunes for that.\nRelated: Firmware update for iPod Touch (iPhone)?\n\n\nI'm trying to install iTunes. I followed the instructions from the guy on YouTube to the letter.\n\nThere are a lot of videos on YouTube, you need to be more specific than that.\n\nHis first instruction was to download iTunes 7.2\n\nThis version was released in 2007...\n\nI have iPhone 4S but I do not have Windows OS installed on my PC in order to put music on my iPhone\n\nand the iPhone 4S was released in 2011. In other words this version may not properly support all the functionality you would expect from iTunes working with your phone.\n", "Q: I can't install anything in Ubuntu Software Center It says this:\n(installArchives() failed: dpkg: error processing package coreutils (--configure):\n package coreutils is not ready for configuration\n cannot configure (current status `half-installed')\nError in function:)\n\nAfter that I shutted it off and rebooted.

The memory was not restored and the /tmp folder did not have any files bigger than Kbs. Please note that the .zip file is on my windows (/host) folders and the player I used was tottem and the \"Archive Manager\" to decompress. I was down to 28Mb free of HD space.\n\nA: Try the folder ~/.cache.\nArchive Manager/Totem probably will cache the video files there as Totem and most other media players need to be able to read from the file directly.\nArchive Manager does usually place temporary files in beginning with .fr or fr (fr for file-roller probably). File roller also leaves these temporary folders in other places (usually when it is interrupted). Also, for clearing disk space in general you can use baobab to scan for what files and folders are taking up space.\nThis seems to be a common issue (I have had it occasionally, and answered a similar question a while ago), so I would suggest filing a bug against the file-roller package (here or 'upstream' here -however it may be a issue related to Totem and/or using File Roller with Totem).\n", "Q: Adjusting screen brightness in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS How can I modify the screen brightness in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS ?

Copying another file & renaming it to .hidden won't work.\n\n*This method will hide all .jpg files in that folder so make sure you don't have any .jpg file that you don't want to hide in there, or simply open the .hidden file and remove it's line if you need it there.\n\n*This is a manual way so you have to repeat that second command each time you add another music file with album art in order to hide it's album art files. \nYou can create a script for automating the process , anyway.\n\nA: As per documentation of eyeD3 you can delete images of .mp3 file using the following commands\n--remove-image=DESCRIPTION\n          Remove image matching DESCRIPTION.\n\n   --remove-all-images\n          Remove all images from the tag\n\nJust navigate to the directory where you have stored all the .mp3 files, then typeenter code here\neyeD3 --remove-all-image *.mp3\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 update failure due to failure in certificate authentication Below is the error from running sudo apt-get update in a terminal on Ubuntu 14.04:\nFailed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/trusty-security/multiverse/binary-i386/Packages  \nserver certificate verification failed.

This keybinding is very irritating because it is very close to the copy-command Ctrl+C.\nPartially, the problem can be explained by my keyboard layout Dvorak such that the browser may consider the keybinds as CTRL+I.\nHow can you disable the CTRL+SHIFT+C binding in Google Chrome?\n\nA: I was able to successfully override the Ctrl+Shift+C shortcut by using the Shortcut Manager plugin and creating a new shortcut for the key combination.\nYou can then reassign it to trigger a host of pre-configured actions, or any javascript / bookmarklet code of your choosing. I don't really have any experience with javascript, so I can't really figure out how to make it act like Ctrl+C, but as far simply preventing it from bringing up the Developer Tools console, simply setting it to execute:\n<script></script>\n\nseems to work.\nEDIT\nI since found that there is, in fact, a simple way to copy to the clipboard in javascript, so instead of setting Ctrl+Shift+C to an empty script, set it to:\ndocument.execCommand('copy');\n\nor simply use Shortcut Manager's \"Import Settings\" feature and paste the following:\n// ==UserScript==\n// @ShortcutManager\n// @name Override Ctrl+Shift+c\n// @namespace FSBQ9ZTetyiG\n// @key Ctrl+Shift+c\n// @include *\n// ==/UserScript==\ndocument.execCommand('copy');\n\n", "Q: \"Print it later\" software Sometimes when I'm working on my laptop, I want to queue up a few documents to print later, since I'm not connected to a printer at the time.\nHowever, actual printer queues are not designed for this; they immediately try to print the document, and all suddenly start printing as soon as I get on the network, which is not generally what I want to do. Moreover, sometimes I want to change the order of documents in the queue, which is not very easy, particularly once some of them have started printing.\nAlso, sometimes printing fails because e.g. the printer runs out of paper or toner, and I want to re-print the document to a different printer. This is not straightforward with e.g. CUPS or system-config-printer; I generally have to go back, re-open the PDF reader, and start over again. None of the PDF readers I know let you keep a list of documents to print later, but this might be a hidden feature of a PDF reader somewhere that I don't know about.\nAnyway, here's what I want to be able to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Specify a list of PDFs I want to print.\n\n*Keep that list on disk so that I can close the application or reboot without losing the entire list.\n\n*Specify the printer(s) I want to send them to in advance without being actually connected to those printers at the time.\n\n*Specify printing options like color, duplex, and number of copies.\n\n*Change those printer assignments and print options later.\n\n*Wait until I press a button or run a command to actually print the document(s).\n\n*Keep a separate list of documents that have already been printed, in case the printing doesn't work or I want to reprint them later.\n\n\nI know I could hack something together with a shell script, lpr, and a list of paths in a text file, but I can't help feeling that this problem has already been solved in a more robust and elegant way.\nBonus points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't require that the documents be open in a PDF reader. I want to print them, not browse them, and there's no reason they have to be the same application.\n\n*More than one list.\n\n*Also work for Postscript, DjVu, and other page-description formats.\n\n*Drag and drop from file managers.\n\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: What I do is the following --- it is not as versatile as you asked, but it works almost ok. You need to have all your printers defined, and then you need these two scripts: \n\n\n*\n\n*stop_printers:\n#!/bin/bash -f\n#\nallp=(`cat /etc/printcap | tr \"|\" \"\\t\" | cut -f 1 | grep -v \"#\"`)\nfor i in ${allp[@]}; do \n    echo -n Printer $i:\n    cupsdisable \"$i\"\n    echo \" \" paused.\ndone\n\n\n*start_printers: \n#!/bin/bash -f\n#\nallp=(`cat /etc/printcap | tr \"|\" \"\\t\" | cut -f 1 | grep -v \"#\"`)\nfor i in ${allp[@]}; do \n    echo -n Printer $i:\n    cupsenable \"$i\"\n    echo \" \" restarted.\ndone\n\nYou have to put them in your path (for example ~/bin) and make them executable with chmod +x. CAVEAT: I do not have any printer with spaces in their names. The scripts are not tested in that case (but I am sure that one of our shell script's gurus will fix the scripts in a flash ;-)... )  \nNow, you can issue: \n[romano:~] % stop_printers\nPrinter PDF:  paused.\nPrinter ColorDEA:  paused.\nPrinter Deskjet_6980:  paused.\nPrinter fotocop5:  paused.\n\nAnd you can print from wherever you want, the printer will be paused: \n\nYou can see your queue: \n[romano:~] % lpq -PDeskjet_6980\nDeskjet_6980 is not ready\nRank    Owner   Job     File(s)                         Total Size\n1st     romano  439     Bones_3+RG.pdf — Flesh depth  125952 bytes\n\n(AFAIK, the print queues are persistent across reboots). And when you want to print: \n[romano:~] % start_printers         \nPrinter PDF:  restarted.\nPrinter ColorDEA:  restarted.\nPrinter Deskjet_6980:  restarted.\nPrinter fotocop5:  restarted.\n\nUsing lprm you can remove a job if you need to; lpr to enqueue a document via command line, and if you want different \"lists\", no one forbids defining the same printer several times with different names. \nYou can also resume  each printer by hand, it's just a matter of running cupsenable <printername> from the prompt.  \nWhat I do not think you can do with this solution is changing the print options after the fact --- you will have to dequeue and re-enqueue the document for this. \n\nA: My package (shameless plug), duplexpr does some of what you want and includes bash functions which may be useful in rolling your own version. (It's coded in bash, so it should be relatively easy to modify and I will help if I can.)\nIt's designed to emulate duplex printing on non-duplex printers and implements its own simple print queue management. It has both gui and cli interfaces.\nThe current version only prints in duplex and only works with non-duplex printers, but a new version is in the works which will handle printers with duplex hardware which essentially is just printer and queue management without the duplex emulation software. (I have an alpha version available of a script which already works if anyone wants to contact me directly via the project, etc..)\nThe system prints to the current default printer, but the dplx and duplex scripts accept additional arguments which are passed to lp and can be used to set any options that lp understands such as printer and other properties.\nThe system currently handles PDF, PostScript, and plain text files.\nThe one thing it will not do is print files which were created using the Print to File option from within Acroread. Those files just don't work with lp and I have never been able to get the attention of any of the upstream folks to figure out what the problems are.\nPersonally, I print almost everything \"offline\" (using the Print to File options which most applications support) even when my printer(s) are available. It helps me concentrate on what I am doing. Later, when I reach a suitable break point, I print batches of jobs.\nHaving a print queue is also really nice when you want to print another copy of something without having to regenerate it and it's essential for dealing with printer errors like jams or running out of toner.\n\nA: There doesn't seem to be a complete solution for this problem, but here's a function I added to my .bashrc that is similar to Rmano's answer above, with the additional convenience of autocomplete.\nall-printers() {\n    if [ \"$*\" = \"\" ]\n    then\n        # Print usage.\"\n        printf \"Usage:\\n\"\n        printf \"all-printers start\\n\"\n        printf \"all-printers stop\\n\"\n        return 1\n    elif !

If you're on the server, just open http://localhost:631/ in a browser.\n\nAuthentication (for printer administration) is for any user in the lpadmin group. You may need to add your user(s) to this group on Ubuntu Server though I imagine exactly the same goes for the other graphical clients too.\n\nThe web interface is restricted to local access by default so if it's a headless server and you only have remote access, you have at least a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use port forwarding to mirror the remote port 631 locally (here as localhost:63100):\nssh -L 63100:localhost:631 tank\n\nThen access http://localhost:63100 in your local browser.\n\n*Tell CUPS to allow connections from any host, then access http://server_ip:631/ in your local browser.

Reading this answer about enabling UFW, I understand that a computer without firewall can be safe in my local network, but this same safe configuration on a laptop used outside of my local network could be risky.\nAs ufw is installed by default, I would like to turn it on, and I would like to configure it for my \"basic desktop / laptop configuration\".\nBy \"basic desktop / laptop configuration\" I mean that my computer is used to:\n\n\n*\n\n*use Firefox\n\n*read emails on Thundurbird\n\n*communicate with Skype\n\n*play games on Steam and Minecraft for my children\n\n*share documents by my local NFS network\n\nA: A basic Desktop firewall is going to deny inbound and allow outbound 'traffic' in a basic setup.  Essentially, while Windows can incorporate application-based filtering, it's default rulesets are to permit outbound and reject inbound except where the outbound traffic is getting a response.  This is the typical \"desktop\" firewall setup usually observed in the wild on the typical end user's desktops.\n(Ideally, you are using ufw for simplicity, but a truly useful ruleset will use pure iptables instead.)\n\nThe ufw way.  And probably the most basic but effective ufw setup for a Desktop computer that doesn't need any special inbound connections or special restrictions going outbound:\nIn theory, you will want to deny inbound traffic, and permit outbound, and allow incoming traffic related to your actions going outbound.  ufw pretty much does this by default.\nNote that I do not have any additional allow rules here.  You don't need any additional allow rules - ufw by default does what my manually installed iptables set below does - it accepts inbound traffic related to an established outgoing connection, so web browser connections and email clients, which initialize their outgoing communications in the high port numbers which are the 'random ports range', will work, and you won't need to accept http (80), https (443), etc. traffic on their ports back in because it's already transparently handled.  To add additional ALLOW IN rules like Boris's answer does only opens the typical desktop user to unneeded connections on those ports, which a Desktop would not need.\n \n(1) Enable UFW\nTurn on ufw rules\nufw enable\n\nThis should really be all you need to do for ufw.  But, you can continue on if you want.\n(2) Deny Inbound Traffic\nPretty sure this is default, but to make sure, run this to make sure it denies incoming traffic by default (except that related to outgoing, such as web browser stuff):\nufw default deny incoming\n\n(3) Permit Outbound Traffic\nThis should also be the default, but run it and make sure that outgoing traffic is allowed:\nufw default allow outgoing\n\nThat should be all you need to do!\n(I will spot check this later today)\n\nAnd then, there is my way, with iptables and manual manipulation of the netfilter/iptables rules instead of ufw (which does that silently)\nFrom what I can tell, ufw has a default ruleset and that should be all you need for the typical desktop.\nHowever, I prefer the iptables approach because I know iptables pretty well so far, and because I like manually configuring my firewall rather than let ufw or random firewall control software build my rules for me.\nThis is my ruleset for iptables (NOT ufw) on my basic desktops with no other things listening, and is not being locked down like my personal laptop computer is.  It also achieves pretty much almost exactly the same thing that the UFW stuff does:\niptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT - Gotta allow localhost, no?\niptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED - Allow already established traffic to finish coming in.  Allow traffic related to outgoing communications through.\niptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT - Allow ICMP packets in (ping, etc.).  You don't need this, but you can have it if you want it.\niptables -A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-unreachable - This denies everything else coming towards the computer.\nThe system default for iptables without ufw rules or any other rules enabled is \"ACCEPT\" for INPUT, OUTPUT, and FORWARD.  So I manually add the 'Reject all other traffic' rule there at the end myself.\n(Note that this is almost exactly what the IPtables HowTo on the Ubuntu help pages produces.

The called backup-script (the child process) in turn performs a check and calls FFS (the grand child process).\nBecause FFS opens its main GUI upon launch, I think I need to declare stdout for instance as:\nDISPLAY=:0.1; export DISPLAY   # I have two screens\n\nMy question is whether I should declare my DISPLAY environment variable within the child script or within the parent spooling-script that calls it ?\nDoes @muru's answer applies in the case ? I.e. if I include the DISPLAY statement within the child script, do I need to source it inside the parent script, knowing I am dealing with an environment variable?\n\nA: You have two options :\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use :\nexport DISPLAY=:0.1\n\nin the parent script. As we are using export the variable will be inherited by all child processes.\n\n\n*You can use :\nDISPLAY=:0.1\n\nin the child shell (if it calls further subshells use export in front).

Apple and Microsoft have their own courses, which give you a certification if you pass them. I could not find a definitive answer on whether Ubuntu Online courses, or any other Ubuntu training programs, exist.\nHere on Ask Ubuntu there is a question about Ubuntu Certified Engineers, but that question and its answers haven’t been updated in years; they’re outdated. Even if they weren’t, they don't really answer my current question.\nIs there a way to get myself certified as an Ubuntu Engineer or specialist, or for any other role?\n\nA: As I understand the certification universe, there is no \"Ubuntu-specific\" certification. Mainly, the general universe of execs hiring IT Professionals don't look for just \"Ubuntu Certification\", more often they're looking for Linux expertise rather than just one specific OS. Sometimes they want expertise in the specific OS, and in fact in one workplace I know the sysadmin is CentOS/RHEL experienced, and one of the other staffers is Debian/Ubuntu experienced, and they both share linux administration, not to mention teach each other things from time to time.\nIf they're looking for a Linux certification, they're looking for a general certification. Here's some of them. This is NOT an all-inclusive list:\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux+, from CompTIA in conjunction with the Linux Professional Institute, is a nice entry level one. [link]  You get an OpenSUSE certification, a Linux+ certification, and a LPIC-1 certification from this.\n\n*Linux Professional Institute Certifications and such exist too, separate from the Linux+. [general link]\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux Essentials is their most basic 'certification', and isn't really a systems administrator certification - it merely covers the absolute basics.  I wouldn't even call it a certification worth anyone's time.  Details about this one are available on the LPI site. \n\n*LPIC-1: Linux Server Professional Certification. This is my current (as of July 2015) level of LPIC certification, and it is a much harder certification than Essentials. This covers a lot more than the bare minimum to understand Linux. The details of what it covers are listed in the two exams' focuses that cover the certification. LPIC-1 information is available here, and is more of a systems administrator certification. Taking the LPIC-1 also gets you an OpenSUSE administrator certification if you pass.\n\n*LPIC-2: Linux Network Professional Certification. This is the next step up from LPIC-1. It's a networking and advanced systems administration cource. Details on what LPIC-2 covers is here.  You'll need LPIC-1 before you get LPIC-2.\n\n*LPIC-3: Linux Enterprise Professional Certification.  This is by far the most difficult, but also the most specialized of the LPIC exams.  Provided you have LPIC-1 and LPIC-2, you must pass one of three potential exams, which focus on special-focus exams.  Their site goes more in depth on these, but here's a short summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Exam 300: Mixed Environment. (Corresponding certification designation: LPIC-3 Mixed Environment) This exam focuses on mixed-environment areas, and different tasks such as: OpenLDAP Configuration; OpenLDAP as an Authentication Backend; Samba Basics; Samba Share Configuration; Samba User and Group management; Samba Domain Integration; Samba Name Services; and, Working with Linux and Windows Clients.\n\n*Exam 303: Security.

Should I assume my Linux system is compromised?\nThanks\nEdit: Good idea scanning with VirusTotal! This is the result\nIt seems indeed a fresh malware targeting windows. Is there the risk that Mono executes its malicious commands in a way that something like \"delete c:\\*.*\" becomes \"rm /* -rf\" in linux? Even if I am not root, many user files should be at risk.\n\nA: As @bodhi.zazen mentioned, if you executed the file as a normal user, it is very unlikely to infect your system. It may affect the files you store in your home folder (such as deleting them or uploading them to a remote server), but apart from that, no other impact is likely.\nWhat you could do is to upload your .pif file to an online virus scanner such as VirusTotal to determine if it actually is a virus and its mode of operation.\nBut again, it is unlikely to have affected your system. If it was a virus that targeted something specific in your Linux home folder (for example, your ssh keys), it would not have been distributed as a Windows-based .pif file.\nEDIT:\nRegarding your added question: Yes, it is possible that that mono will execute such a delete command. However, from the description in the VirusTotal link, it seems it is more an adware trojan than something that destroys your data.

There is no change in the symptoms for either program.\nAccording to the man page, I need a firmware file called Artec48.usb for the back end to use.

When I came back and tried to surf the net, I saw that my firefox started giving me this problem:\n\"Shockwave Flash is known to be vulnerable\" \nI did a research about it and uninstalled and installed back the adobe flash player plugin but it didn't work. Also my flash player is up to date. (Version: 11.02.202.481). And I use Lubuntu by the way.\nThank you for your support!\n\nA: \nMozilla, which develops Firefox, imposed the block because recently\n  unearthed bugs in Flash were being actively used by cyber-thieves.\nThe bugs were detailed in a cache of documents stolen from security\n  firm Hacking Team that was hit by attackers last week.\nAdobe said it took Flash's security \"seriously\" and was planning bug\n  fixes.\n\nSource\nThere is now no way to make it always active without some prompting, but you should be able to allow Flash for individual content by pressing the Activate Adobe Flash:\n\nOr you can enable it for the site, and even choose to remember that you want it active for that site:\n\n\nA: The accepted way to get Flash in Ubuntu and Linux, and a recent version, is with Google Chrome, as it's the only browser shipping a Flash version.\nAdobe stopped supporting Flash for Linux (even in Firefox) around version 11.  They no longer produce any 'new' Flash releases for Linux and the way Firefox handles plugins.  Due to the really really old version number (18 is the latest Flash overall, and 11 is the last supported Firefox plugin version available for Linux), and other security concerns, Firefox automatically disables these 'old' versions.  This applies to all Operating Systems, not just Ubuntu and *nix.  (While @ParanoidPanda is correct they now enforce that for a few extra versions across all platforms, this isn't the primary reason for this warning in Ubuntu/Firefox).\n\nHowever, even though Adobe pulled native support for Firefox's plugin API formats for Linux and such, Adobe and Google have an agreement.  This agreement lets Google ship updated Flash that uses the Pepper API framework, and it is included in Google.\nThere are wrapper programs that can be installed into Firefox that leverage the use of the Pepper Flash in Chrome, provided you install Chrome.  However, most users just switch to Chrome when this is the case.\nI would suggest that you install Chrome and use that for browsing and using Flash sites (provided you keep it up to date).\n\nNote however that there is no way to bypass this change in Firefox's policy.  There is a page in the Security Team's knowledge base that details this issue a little more, or at least, provides a timeline for all the events related to this.\n\nA: Trying to answer the obvious question:\nWhat to do?\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that the computer is connected to the Internet and update your installation with:\n\n\n*\n\n*update-manager from the dash\n\n*or sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade from the terminal (check if the first command returns errors, a reason why I don't recommend chaining both with && here)\n\n*or what ever package manager or front end for it your distribution/flavor uses.\n\n\n*Check that the Flash version number in the corresponding plugin page in the settings of your browser exactly matches the version number published on Adobes site for Flash.\n\n\n*\n\n*If it doesn't try sudo apt-get install --reinstall flashplugin-installer for the NPAPI plugin (Firefox and others) or replace it with pepperflashplugin-nonfree if you use Chromium.\n\n\n*If your browser still reports that this plugin is vulnerable and no newer version is currently available, make a choice:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use alternatives such as HTML5 whenever they are available.\n\n*Choose another browser. (Chrome has already earned the doubtful reputation of being a modern day equivalent to Flash Player.)\n\n*Wait for an updated version of the plugin for your browser. This can range from days to months or years.\n\n*Choose that it is not worth the risk to run Flash.\n\n\n*\n\n*Provide useful(!) feedback to whoever is responsible that this content is only distributed through Flash.\n\n*If it's only video or audio and in the absence of an HTML5 implementation, try downloading the video/audio stream or file using popular tools for this task or manually digging through the source of the site. (This may be considered a crime in some cases.)\n\n\n*Run Flash anyway.

There is no other operating system there - just a small boot partition, an ext4 partition with my data, and a swap partition.\nA few minutes ago, I wanted to format a USB key with several partitions. Needless to say, I got confused and formatted the boot partition in my SSD drive as NTFS instead. (I chose the quick option, without data erasure.) Noticing what I had done, I formatted it as FAT (which I think it was before the accident). I then tried to reboot the computer, but it failed to reboot; it gave me a \"No bootable devices found. Press F1 key to retry boot, Press F2 key, etc.\" message.\nWhat can be done?\n\nA: You wrote:\n\nNoticing what I had done, I formatted it as FAT (which I think it was before the accident).\n\nIf the partition was indeed FAT before the accident, then that suggests it was an EFI System Partition (ESP), which in turn implies you were booting in EFI mode. If this is correct, then recovery is relatively simple, and can be done in several ways, the easiest two of which are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to an Ubuntu live CD in EFI mode, install the Boot Repair tool, and run it. This should install a fresh copy of GRUB on your ESP and everything should start working again.\n\n*If Secure Boot is enabled in your firmware, disable it; then download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager, prepare a boot medium from it, and boot using it. rEFInd should give you options to boot your Linux kernel. Boot it. Once Linux is running, you can open a Terminal and either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the rEFInd PPA or Debian package, as described on the rEFInd downloads page.\n\n*Mount your ESP at /boot/efi, then type sudo grub-install followed by sudo update-grub to re-install and configure GRUB.\n\n\n\nBefore you attempt either of these procedures, though, I recommend you check for existing kernels by mounting your Ubuntu root (/) partition and checking the contents of its /boot directory. If that directory is empty, then you have no kernels, which means the partition you overwrote was probably a Linux /boot partition and not an ESP. In this case, you must re-install your kernels. If you see a number of files, including ones with names that begin vmlinuz, then you did not overwrite a /boot directory and chances are you can recover your system with the either of the procedures I've just outlined.\nIf you need to recover your kernels, then the procedure is more complex, and I don't happen to have step-by-step instructions handy. It can be done, but it might be simpler to back up your personal files from the /home directory, re-install, and then restore your personal files.\n\nA: I'm to lazy to start a Live system, the following is from memory. ;)\n\nReinstall your system\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot a Live system\n\n*Mount the / partition and backup the following folders: /etc, /var and maybe /opt\n\n*If you have no separate /home partition, stop here and go to the the chapter Create a separate /home partition and follow the steps there\n\n*Unmount all partitions\n\n*Start the installation\n\n*In the configuration steps you will see a question about partitioning, eg. something like \"Use the entire HDD\" and other options\n\n*Select \"Other\"\n\n*Define the positions for /, swap and so on and the partition for /home.\n\n*For all partitions set format disk but not for /home.\n\n*Finish the configuration and use you old username.\n\n*Finish the installation\n\n*After that you can restore some configurations from the /etc backup and so on\n\n\n\nCreate a separate /home partition\nIf there is no separate /home partition, than it's now time to create one. \n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your existing /home on an external drive\n\n*Resize your partition with gparted\n\n*Create a /home partition\n\n*Move your data back\n\n*Go back to the chapter Reinstall your system and continue with point 4\n", "Q: Run script at login screen I wrote a script which is supposed to run at the login screen (It reads the serial stream of an arduino and types my password into the password box .. ).

However, there is the possibility to use an alternative window manager with LXDE (see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LXDE#Use_a_different_window_manager -> option: \"window_manager=\" ), which then offers this function (in my case, JWM helped -> option: MoveMode and ResizeMode in .jwmrc). Fluxbox will also work.\n\nA: What you're looking for is the drawContent option in /etc/xdg/openbox/rc.xml or its homedir equivalent:\nsed -i -e \"s%<drawContents>yes</drawContents>%<drawContents>no</drawContents>%\" /etc/xdg/openbox/rc.xml\n\nLog out and in again (or just restart openbox) and now dragging only displays the frame.\nThis is working for me in Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04. Haven't tried other releases.\n\nA: I don't know of a wireframe option but openbox does allow lots of custom window management through keyboard shortcuts. However http://openbox.org/wiki/Help:Configuration suggests that if you edit ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml if you are using the lubuntu session. \n  no\n  Always\n  Fixed\n  \n    400\n    center\n  \n editing the line that says draw contents to no will make it a solid color when moving and resizing windows. To get openbox to reload its configuratoin file you will need to run openbox --reconfigure\nIf this still does not perform well enough you can try to work around resizing windows with the mouse with the following methods. Although out of the box lubuntu has keyboard shortcuts to snap windows to half the screens size with the super (windows key) and an arrow key to snap to that half of the screen. Also keep in mind you can learn to use virtual workspaces in lubuntu and switch between those in lubuntu to aviod needing to resize windows as often. There are the keyboard shortcuts control alt left and control alt right to switch between desktops. You can also use the windows key and f1 or f2 but you can add up to four workspaces and then super key plus f3 and f4 will allow you to switch to additional workspaces. You can add works spaces just for this session by middle clicking on the desktop or permanently by setting a number in openbox configuration manager. \n", "Q: General error mounting filesystems after upgrade from 10.04 to 12.04 I updated My server from ubuntu 10.04 LT to 12.04 LT and I had couple of errors but it was completed without asking me to reboot. when I rebooted I had the following error: \nGeneral error mounting filesystems.\nA maintenance shell will now be started. \nCONTROL-D will terminate this shell and continue reboot the system.\nI can see /dev/sda1 as read only, no chance of change it to rw. \nI tried the following\nBoot on LiveUSB\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nsudo chroot /mnt\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -f dist-upgrade\n(no network)\nthen it try to update nfs-common nfs-kernel-server and I get dependency error and it fail.

I am attempting to install Cloudera CDH 5 onto an Ubuntu computer I have setup to be part of the Hadoop cluster. Per Cloudera's install guide Trusty (14.04) users need to prioritize the Cloudera repository to prevent an issue with some Zookeeper packages.\nTo do so they instruct you to create a file at /etc/apt/preferences.d/cloudera.pref with some specific text contained inside.\nHowever, when I navigate to /etc/apt/preferences.d/, New Document on the right-click menu is greyed out. \nThus my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How would I go about creating the needed file in that directory?\n\n*Given that I'm the admin, how would I go about changing the right setting such that I can create/edit any file in any directory (like the admin permissions in Windows)?\n\n\nA: Most directories under /etc will require root privileges to create files in.  Unfortunately, the default file browser doesn't provide a quick-n-easy method to escalate privileges for a single operation.  The command line is your answer.\nsudo nautilus will launch a copy of nautilus w/ root privileges, allowing you to do whatever you want.  I'm not sure that's a good idea (easy to leave it open and forget that it has super powers), but it's convenient in some cases.\nsudo touch /etc/apt/preferences.d/cloudera.pref will create an empty file. Once you've done that, you could do something like \nsudo chown some_user /etc/apt/preferences.d/cloudera.pref to change ownership or\nsudo chmod a+rw /etc/apt/preferences.d/cloudera.pref to open read/write privs to everyone (generally a bad idea)\nYou can also set user & group on a file at the same time:\nsudo chown some_user:some_group /etc/apt/preferences.d/cloudera.pref\n\nor just set the group ownership:\nsudo chgrp some_group /etc/apt/preferences.d/cloudera.pref\n\nan ls -l (or using your graphical browser w/ the right settings) will display the ownership/permission details for verification.\nYou could create the file and set it to be owned by your user for temporary convenience, edit it using your convenient GUI editor if you want, then set ownership back to root or whatever you want it to be for proper security.\nTypically, /etc contains static configuration files, so you make them readable by certain groups of users (even all users, if not sensitive) but reserve write privs for root.  I don't know anything about Cloudera, but it's common to have software running under a particular user (and a user can be a member of multiple groups) so you can set the group of the file to be the group that you want to have privs on it.\n", "Q: How to compile Linux driver from source given no /configure I'm trying to compile the following on 12.04 and I'm not sure how to approach it.

But I'm not sure how that is different from configure..\nhttps://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/drivers/scsi/mpt3sas\n\nA: That is part of the kernel tree, and not a separate external module. It's to be built with the build of the kernel, depending on how the build is configured.\nIf you want to build that module for an older kernel, you need to build it in the context of the older kernel, as a module, and you may need to do quite some back-porting work on 12.04 as that tree is a clone of the current master tree, and not the kernel version that is available in 12.04.\n\nA: That directory is part of a full kernel source tree. The standard way to compile it is together with the rest of the kernel. \nFor some part of the tree it is possible to compile some module standalone --- but it s not a trivial task.

How can I recover the data of old Win8.1?\n\nA: Short answer:\nYou may want to try using TestDisk and PhotoRec from http://www.cgsecurity.org/ to recover your data. Depending on how corrupted the data is, it might be possible to recover most of your data including the partition table. Worst case, you may be able to at least recover your files partially.\nLong answer:\nIt appears you may have selected an option to reformat your partition table / partitions as LVM instead of the usual MBR/UEFI format if the former, or instead of a FAT32/NTFS system if the latter. This means that the part of the hard drive which Windows 8.1 used for keeping track of where each part of which file is (let's call it a file index) might have been corrupted to a varying degree.\n\nThis means that the files may be still there (or partially there, if the LVM format process overwrote the part of the hard drive where a file or a file fragment was stored), just not in a format which your operating system can recognise immediately as the OS depends on the index to work. PhotoRec tries hard to find files without using an index, which means that:\n\n*\n\n*The folder structure and file names might not be preserved. This means that the items may unordered, all placed in the same folder upon recovery and with auto-generated names (or partially-recovered names in some instances), even if the files themselves are recovered in their entirety.\n\n*Some files may not be contiguous (i.e. occupying a single continuous chunk of hard drive space), which is not normally a problem as the index stores the information on which chunks of the file are located where. Parts of the index may be missing, so some files may be recovered as cut-up in several pieces.\n\n*Before you begin recovery, you must select which file types you want PhotoRec to look for. File detection is done using pattern matching, so it may produce false positives/negatives. Pick carefully.\n\n*Try TestDisk first. It doesn't do such a deep scan as PhotoRec, but it may be able to recover some partition table/file system structures and you might not need to do a PhotoRec scan.\n\n", "Q: Buggy full screen mode since Flash 18.0.0.204 I use Flash Pepper with Firefox via Fresh Player.\nThe following setup allows me to watch YouTube videos in full screen mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kubuntu vivid with all the latest updates\n\n*Firefox 39.0\n\n*Flash 18.0.0.194 (Pepper, from Chrome)\n\n*Fresh Player 0.3.1 (from webupd8)\n\n*either the nVidia driver 340.76 or the Nouveau driver from vivid\n\n\nWhen I update to Flash 18.0.0.204 or 18.0.0.209 all YouTube videos play in a 2mmx1mm box in the top left corner of my screen.\nThis can be reproduced with a live USB of Kubuntu vivid.\nDoes anyone using Flash 18.0.0.194 (Pepper) has the same issue?\nIs Chrome/Chromium affected too?\nAny idea on how to solve this (beside reverting to Flash 18.0.0.194)?\n\nA: Right-click on the lower right corner on any YouTube video, click About the HTML5 player and on the next screen tick the check box so your screen looks like below:\n\nThen you're not using any flash.

The Ubuntu Certified Professional course will help you efficiently install and configure Ubuntu systems, maintain system security and configure network connectivity and key network services. \nSupport systems \nWhen you experience an issue, your first course of action should be to consult the Knowledge Base through the support portal. The Knowledge Base contains a range of documentation detailing issues and solutions that have been experienced by other users. \nIf there is no appropriate solution, you can either enter the problem through the support portal ticketing system, or you can telephone GSS directly. Severity level 1 and level 2 issues should be reported by phone.\nSupport Tier 1 \nInitial calls are handled by Tier 1 engineers who have been trained to handle basic configuration or usage issues. The engineer’s first task is to verify the nature of the issue and the severity level of the problem. Having done so, they will work with you to undertake basic debugging and deliver an appropriate resolution. \nIf the problem is beyond this tier’s capability, it is escalated to the second tier. \nSupport Tier 2 \nTier 2 engineers have extensive Ubuntu experience and may be specialists in a particular domain of knowledge. Aside from escalated issues, this tier deals with complex problems where there are a range of subsystems involved. The engineer will work to recreate a complex problem and isolate it into a repeatable test case. In general, issues that involve advanced configuration are resolved at this level. Any resolved issue is then added to the Knowledge Base so you and other users will be able to resolve it in the future. \nSupport Tier 3 \nAn issue that moves through to the Tier 3 group has been isolated to a repeatable test case. The third tier works on any code changes that are necessary to resolve the problem for you. This generally involves developing and testing a custom patch for you and delivering this as a customer package. If this is successful, the engineer will work with the distribution developers to integrate the package into future releases of Ubuntu. \n\nHope this might be useful.\n", "Q: How to set TUN/TAP devices I know that similar questions have been asked before and I did try to follow the instructions suggested by other users, but I still can't seem to solve my problem.\nI just signed up for HMA vpn.

Can somebody help?\n\nA: This article was tremendously helpful to me in setting up OpenVPN.  I assume you are running it as a client?  Of course, I do not know what configuration steps you have already performed, but it is likely that you need to edit your profile file ?.ovpn to, as a minimum, include the hostname of the server you are trying to connect to.  Then, depending on the client you are using, you can either merge the certificates and keys into ?.ovpn or supply them separately.  Step 4 in the linked article goes over this in detail.

So, I've recently moved from Window$ (again), and I'd like to move my game library over.\nI've already installed Steam for Linux (so I can play supported games natively), but now I have to install Steam for Wine so I can play all the non-native games.\nMy problem here is that I'm running two versions of Steam simultaneously which can be a waste of resources (not to mention that it's annoying that I have to switch to the different version every time I can't find a game in this category or vice-versa).\nIs there any way I can trick Steam for Linux into launching Windows games through Wine?\nFor example, can I just hit the Play button for something like Skyrim from my Linux install, and just have Steam prepend the command with wine? At the same time, native games should run without any prefixing.\n\nA: I've had some success launching apps through wine from the Linux Steam client.  As Michael suggests, you need to use a shell script to launch them.\nFor example, I use this to launch path of exile, named poe.exe:\n#!/bin/bash\nunset LD_PRELOAD\nexport WINEPREFIX=/media/stephen/d_extra/PoE/\nexport WINEDEBUG=-all\ncd \"${WINEPREFIX}\"\ncd drive_c\ncd \"Path of Exile\"\nwine PathOfExile.exe\n\nThe game wouldn't launch for me without unsetting LD_PRELOAD.  Also, the permissions on the file had to be executable.\nI set the permissions on the script (for example):\nchmod 755 ~/bin/poe.exe\n\nThen I use the Add non-steam game option, and then I browse to the script.\nSo, that's how you add a generic wine game...\nTo answer your question and to add a steam game, you need to create a script that calls the steam.exe and passes the game id.  This will result in launching a second instance of steam, but you wont have needed to have it running for the whole time, just while the second game is running.  So here's another script that kicks off the windows version of unturned by calling the windows steam client through wine with an appropriate url:\n#!/bin/bash\nunset LD_PRELOAD\nexport WINEPREFIX=$HOME/.unturned\nexport WINEDEBUG=-all\ncd \"${WINEPREFIX}\"\ncd drive_c\ncd Program\\ Files\\ \\(x86\\)/Steam/\nnice -n 19 wine Steam.exe -no-dwrite steam://rungameid/304930\n\nIn this case I don't know that the unset on LD_PRELOAD is needed, but my other scripts used it.\nNOTE: The WINEPREFIX only needs to be specified if you specified a WINEPREFIX when installing steam (or other windows programs).  If you didn't specify one when installing steam for windows, then you wouldn't need one in your scripts.  And if that's the case, you will want to replace it with ~/.wine/.\n\nA: You could try the Add a Non-Steam Game option and direct it to a shell script that launches the game but this wouldn't solve much as it would also launch the Windows Steam client as well because the client is needed to authenticate the game as part of the DRM process. If the Linux client could authenticate DRM for Windows games than all would be fine but it just doesn't work that way.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Vivid Android USB tethering not works I have LG G3 (32GB/3GB) When I tried USB tethering with my Ubuntu vivid it connected but after about 20-30 seconds it disconnected.

I used to do it that way myself, but I haven't had such a system for a while now. I've just checked a couple of systems I have and, subtracting out the space used by /usr, /var, and /home (when they're not separate filesystems), I've found disk space used in / alone in the 370-500MiB range.\nYour /dev/mapper/owncloud--vg-root logical volume, by contrast, is just 313MiB in size. Thus, it's not really surprising that you're running out of space, and even if you delete some files, you'll probably be in the same boat again very soon. I recommend you either re-install with a larger /, and perhaps keep /usr and/or /var within that / (in which case it should be much larger -- say, 10-30GiB); or use system-config-lvm or the LVM command-line tools to resize your logical volumes and grow /. Given the space used on my systems, I'd make it at least 1GiB. There are several questions and answers on the latter topic on this site, such as:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I resize an active LVM partition?\n\n*How do I shrink the root logical volume (LV) on LVM?\nA broader Web search turns up quite a few tutorials on this subject, too.\n", "Q: Locked black screen after upgrading from 14.04 to 14.10 I have just done the upgrade from 14.04 to 14.10.

Which did not show the Exec format error.\n\nA: This can also occur if you attempt to run an x86-64 executable on a 32-bit platform.\nIn one specific instance, I downloaded Visual Studio Code and tried to run it on my Ubuntu installation, but I hadn't realized that I had installed 32-bit Ubuntu in this VM.  I got this error, but after downloading the 32-bit version, it ran without issue.\n\nA: You're trying to run an executable compiled for an ARM architecture on an x86-64 architecture, which is much like asking your processor who only speaks English to take directions in Chinese.\nIf you need to run that executable you have two choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get an x86-64 version of the executable (by any mean; if you're unable to get an x86-64 version of the executable but you're able to get its source code, you can try to recompile it on the virtual machine);\n\n*Install Ubuntu Server for ARM in place of Ubuntu 14.04.2 (amd64). This requires either a physical machine running on an ARM architecture or a virtualization software that can emulate it.\n\nA: It is often possible to run an ARM executable image on an amd64 system if you install the binfmt-support, qemu, and qemu-user-static packages:\nsudo apt install binfmt-support qemu qemu-user-static\n\nqemu will then perform syscall emulation when you run the executable. This works for most ARM binaries but there are a few that may not run correctly.\n\nA: Such error may occur if all of the following are true:\n\n\n*\n\n*Executable is not a file but a link\n\n*You run run it inside VM\n\n*File is located in shared folder\n\n*Your host is Windows.\n\n\nIf you got that file, let's say, in archive - try to unpack it inside VM, in some directory inside virtual drive, not folder mapped to your host machine hard drive, for example /myNewDir/\n\nA: You must compile your file using an appropriate CPU architecture (x86 for example) and copy the .exe file on your linux machine. Then you can install mono on your linux machine and issue the following command: \nmono myprogram.exe\n\n\nA: This can also happen if the binary uses a libc implementation which is not libc, such as musl. These days this specific problem is most likely encountered when trying to run a binary with libc in a Docker container with an image based on alpine. There is nothing that can be done to the binary itself to support both environments, because the libc implementation must always be linked statically, i.e. built directly into the binary, for reasons.\n\nA: I got this error trying to run a zip file containing an executable rather than extracting it and running the executable itself xD\nIn addition to the other answers offered here, I suppose there would be a lot of file types that aren't intended to be executable which could cause this error.\n\nA: This is another special case: WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) by default(!) only supports 64bit executables. I think this is a rather unusual behaviour, as normally there is a backwards compatibility.\n(Even more special is that selecting 64bit in a formerly 32bit project of Windev won't fix your issue. You need to start a new project, selecting 64bit right in the beginning. Tested on Windev 26. This IDE sucks, forced to use it because of working legacy code.)\n", "Q: How to open a file in a browser? When I open some .html file on my Windows 8.1 (for example this file C:\\Users\\me\\sbox\\foo\\client\\index.html) in a browser (the url is this: file:///C:/Users/me/sbox/foo/client/index.html), the browser parses the file and I can see it the same way like I visited a web page. No running web-server needed, because it is only html markup file.\nI want to do the same on my Ubuntu (Amazon Linux actually). I want to type an IP address of my Ubuntu into a browser and get /var/www/index.html. I mean public IP, that is: http://123.12.12.12/ or http://123.12.12.12/index.html and get the page in a browser.\nIs it possible? How to achieve it? Do I really need any web servers running? I just want to open an .html file, not .php or whatever, no parser needed.\nAs I understand, I need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*open :80 port\n\n*set some config so that all public inbound http:80 requests should go to /var/www folder.\nAm I right? How to do it?\n\nA: If you want a quick and dirty one-line command, use python SimpleHTTPServer\npython -m SimpleHTTPServer\n\nHow to use it example for your case:\n$ cd /var/www\n$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer\n\nThats it! This will be serving current directory /var/www. Default port is 8000, so your website will be accessible from http://ip-address:8000 or at your local machine http://localhost:8000\nTo access other files not named index.html, use their name http://ip-address:8000/other-name.html, if there is no index.html, you will see a directory listing with all the files in your folder. \nTo change port, you need to have sudo priviliges:\n$ sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80\n\nThis command will be serving your directory on port 80, if you have apache2 already installed, you can change this port to 81, so it does not have a port conflict and you will access your website from http://ip-address:81, don't forget to allow these ports in your firewall, to allow port 80 use:\n$ sudo ufw allow 80/tcp\n\nNo webserver\nAnother way is not to use any web-server, just install your favorite desktop environment and browser on your server and connect to it with remote desktop of your choice. Then your website will be available from the browser as you are used to at file:///var/www/index.html\n\nA: Yes, you need a web server. Look at the URL you are requesting. If the first part - the protocol - is \"file:\", then the browser will do a local search for the file. If the protocol is \"http:\", the browser will open a network connection on port 80 to the server part of the URL.\nOnly if you have managed to mount some sort of network share to the Amazon Linux server, you might be able to use the \"file:\" protocol here. Otherwise you need a web server on the other end, even if you only want the html file transferred, not parsed and executed in the case of .php. Luckily, installing Apache2 does exactly that, and it is not difficult.\n\nA: To access your files through a browser, from another computer, you will need a webserver to manage the requests.\nApache webserver will do exactly this.\nInstallation\nsudo install apache2\n\nStart server\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start\n\nStop server\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop\n\nWhen the Apache server is running all these URL's point to the same file, try them in your browser.\nfile:///var/www/html/index.html\nlocalhost/index.html\n{you ip address}/index.html\n", "Q: Copying files from directories having spaces in its name This is what I tried. \ninputFile=$(zenity --file-selection --title \"Test\" --text \"Please select the file for analysis.\" | sed -e \"s/ /\\\\\\ /g\")\n\nI did the sed operation to replace white spaces with a \\ and a whitespace to make the copying command to work.

Actually I am writing a program. So I don't want to tell the users to rename their folder names to avoid spaces.\n\nA: you can add * where the space appeared and the copy can be done\nlike\n cp  /home/user/users*tst.txt  /home/user/Downloads\n\nwhere you want to copy users tst.txt to Downloads folder from home folder\n\nA: Easily you can do the trick, enclose by double quotes:\ncp \"$inputFile\" /destination/\n\nEnclosing characters in double quotes (‘\"’) preserves the literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of ‘$’, ‘`’, ‘\\’, Read more: http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Double-Quotes.html\n", "Q: Lenovo S21e netbook touchpad and wireless problems solved with kernel and driver update November 2016.

Christian of alpha-labs.net determined kernel components had been dropped and he got a kernel hacker to add in the needed components and he published a kernel that I know of as 4.1.6-lenovo-s21e.\nUbuntu 16.04 uses a kernel with most of what the Lenovo S21e needs. Just add the three Broadcom software packages. \nI have not tested if the updated kernels allow Skype to use the Lenovo S21e internal microphone yet. The internal mike problem has to do with the internal microphone being a mono device and the sound mixer software is expecting a stereo device. Or perhaps vice versa.\nThe internal microphone records, as with the arecord command:\narecord test ; ctrl-c to end\naplay test   ; poor quality sound but it does work.\nBest wishes on getting your S21e running. PS, I used a USB adapter with an ethernet socket to provide a fast wired Internet connection while doing the software installations mentioned above. The 16.04 LTS installation had to run over night, due to many components being installed and configured. Definitely provide AC power before starting the 16.04 upgrade.\nLinux user and administrator Christian at alpha-labs.net has found a fix for the broken touchpad and broken wireless functionality when Ubuntu 14.4 is installed on the Lenovo S21e laptop computer.\nThe date is November 2015 and Christians fixes replace kernel -3.16.0-30 with a new kernel -4.1.6-lenovo-s21e. The kernel change fix the touchpad. Christian also supplies a modified wireless device driver that fixes yet again yet another technicality of the Broadcom device inside the Lenovo S21e.\nFor Linux newbies and those like myself who forget a lot, Post number 31 or 33 on the following web site is a keystroke by keystroke supportive commentary of fixing your Lenovo S21e.\nhttps://alpha-labs.net/2015/08/lenovo-s21e-linux-and-the-touchpad/\nI recommend you consider buying a USB 3.0 Three port hub with a Gigabit Ethernet jack to provide a working data connection while fixing the built in wireless. My junkbox wireless dongle was worthless. During and after the fixes, I still need a mouse to do copy and paste and I like the stunningly fast wired hardware connection.\nI just bought a $200 Lenovo S21e 11\" screen netbook with a 32 Gig drive and I installed Ubuntu 14.4 LTS.  I have the classic repeating new computer aggravations\nOver the past 10 years I have gotten used to sticking the latest Ubuntu boot CD into a slot and getting a wonderful and stable dual boot computer. Apparently UEFI and the proprietary hardware geniuses are throwing up more and more compound stumbling blocks preventing Ubuntu from being easy to install.\nThanks so much for starting Askubuntu and when I get this puppy fixed, I'll post the steps here for others to use.\n\nA: Here is the fix for the touchpad (Took me days to come up with a working solution): https://alpha-labs.net/2015/08/lenovo-s21e-linux-and-the-touchpad/\n", "Q: Logitech K800 keyboard has non-functioning keys Hmmm, this seems to have fixed itself overnight. Strange!\nAs you were...\nI recently bought a new Logitech K800 keyboard (wireless, illumiated), paired it to the unified receiver I am already using for my mouse (using solaar), and discovered that the 'd', 'TAB' and left 'ALT' keys were not working.\nThe keyboard works on the same system when booted into Windows 7, and I can unpair it and connect it via a different unified receiver to my laptop and it works fine.\nBoth the laptop and this system are running Ubuntu 15.04.\nAdditionally, if I boot this system into Ubuntu 15.04 from a bootable USB stick the keyboard works fine.\nSo I'm concluding that there's something left over from earlier upgrades (I can't remember the first version of Ubuntu I installed on this machine!) that's causing the non-functioning key problem. I've tried comparing files in /etc/ with those on the laptop but haven't found anything that changes the behaviour.\nIncidently, I have an older logitech wired USB keyboard connected at the same time and it works properly.\nAny clues for places to check re old files or configurations would be much appreciated!\n\nA: I had a similar problem with my k800 keyboard today. My i key wasn't working. \nI disassembled the keyboard to discover that there was a lot of dirt and dust in it. I also noticed that under the key tab there's a little soft part that make a contact while pressed.  Under this soft transparent rubber part there a little electrical contact and it was dirty. \nSo I removed the two little white brackets clipped under the key cap around the soft rubber part. I de-clipped them gently. Then I cleaned the area of the key with a small child's paintbrush and my vacuum hose close to it to remove the dust. Then I use 99% isopropyl alcohol and the little paintbrush to clean the electrical contact under the rubber part. I also put some more alcohol over the soft rubber part and pressed it several times. After that I reassembled the keyboard and the i key was fixed.\n", "Q: How to stop an Upstart Job(Service) I thought this was easy but it does not seem to.\nHere is my system info:\n# nginx -v\nnginx version: nginx/1.8.0\n\n# uname -a\nLinux ip-10-0-0-247 3.2.0-69-virtual #103-Ubuntu SMP Tue Sep 2 05:21:29 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n# lsb_release -a\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS\nRelease:        12.04\nCodename:       precise\n\nAnd here are my various attempts at stopping NginX:\n# netstat -punta | grep nginx\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:443             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1743/nginx -g daemo\n\n# service nginx stop\nnginx start/running, process 1775\n# netstat -punta | grep nginx\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:443             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1775/nginx -g daemo\n\n# nginx -s stop\n# netstat -punta | grep nginx\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:443             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1783/nginx -g daemo\n\n# nginx -s quit\n# netstat -punta | grep nginx\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:443             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1791/nginx -g daemo\n\n# initctl stop nginx\nnginx start/running, process 1830\n# netstat -punta | grep nginx\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:443             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1830/nginx -g daemo\n\nAs seen above, Every time I try to stop the NginX service, it comes alive with a new PID.

It is much more robust and scalable. \n\nA: I don't think that Samsung allows third party-software to access the S Memo notes in your Samsung account. Samsung uses the word \"synchronize\" to mean \"back up to our servers in case you need them on another phone\".  \nThere is a newer app called S Note (not sure if that is available to you) which does have a Windows counterpart, and lets you access the notes on another platform, presumably from within a browser. \nPersonally, I use Evernote for Android together with Nixnote2 for Ubuntu, which does pretty much the same thing.\n\nA: I setup my S note to sync to evernote, then I can access that through ubuntu on web.

In general I would expect the Assessment column to show something else than \"ok\". \nBesides that the general conclusion in the images is \"Disk is OK, 16 bad sectors\".\n\nA: All life is doomed eventually! ;-) \nBut your hard disk looks like it's got a pretty healthy life ahead of it.  Especially look at the last column: Assessment is OK everywhere!\nInterpreting all of your data is going to be too broad to answer here.  For more information on SMART technology, have a look at this excellent Q&A.\nOn the 5 bad sectors: the time that a hard disk was manufactured without any bad sectors is long gone: nowadays they have a number of spare sectors which are swapped out automatically without you even noticing.  So yours has 5% of its spare sectors allocated already, which isn't a big deal.  Mine has 140 sectors out of 200 allocated and I'm not worried (yet)...  ;-)\nWhich means you still have to run back-ups!
