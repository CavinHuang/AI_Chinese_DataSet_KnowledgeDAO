["Q: Can I just swap the hard drives of two macbook pros (different years)? I'd like to swap the hard drives of two Macbook Pros. One is a Core 2 duo model from 2010, the other a 2011 i5 model. Will this work? I just want to save time and not go through a lengthy data copying process.\n\nA: Yes. In almost all cases, OS X software is hardware-agnostic (as long as the hardware comes from Apple).\n\nA: Yes, as long as both machines have Intel processors in them then both hard disks are formatted with GUID partitioning. If one of the machines was older and had a Power PC processor in it then you'd need to reformat and partition that drive for the newer processor and partition scheme. In your case, swap away.\n\nA: It would be best to check with Apple on both serial numbers. They can tell you if the part number for each drive is the same or whether the firmware on each drive is 100% correct for both models. Of course, most SATA drives are fine in any mac for general use, but you can get slowness or less than optimal speeds or sleep/wake issues if the firmware on the system and the drive are at odds with each other.\n\nA: As long as you have a SATA hard drive, it doesn't matter what it is. You can also buy a SSD and replace your current one.\n", "Q: Using an Address Book custom label on a printing label I have a custom label in my Address Book cards (to indicate the name I'd like to appear on a label, e.g. The Smith Family). \nI'm on Lion (so that's Address Book version 6.1 on Mac OS X 10.7.2). \nWhen I go to print the labels, File > Print > Mailing Labels I can't change it from using the Name (Prefix - First Name - Surname). \nBefore I set off trying to export this to a mail merge and use a much more complicated method, is there a way of doing this within Address Book? \nI found this hack which suggests adding the label as the Company Name, because that is an option to print, but some of the people have actual company names, so that isn't going to work for me. \n\nA: When printing labels, I find a good technique is to make a new Address Book group. Here's a technique that might work, depending on the size of the job. \nDuplicate a contact with copy/paste, and drag the copy into the label printing group. Edit the card so the name fields are blank, and set the first name to be \"The Smith Family\". When you're done making the label changes, select the group and bring up the printing UI, which will print the contacts in the group.\nWhen you're done printing, delete the contacts from the label printing group, then delete the group, and your original contacts remain intact.\n\nA: I haven't tried it yet but here's a post about the same problem where a commenter suggests an AppleScript to temporarily change the names you're using and then revert them back after you're done printing.\n\nA: It's not an ideal solution, but I've solved around the problem by using Address Book Exporter which saves to a CSV which I can then import into Word and do a mail merge - because frankly, for jobs like this, Microsoft does do a better job (you can do it in Libre Office, but it's not as smooth). \n", "Q: What is OS X's equivalent of Linux's NSS? Anyone familiar with the internals of Linux knows about NSS; it's the subsystem that services, like gethostname() and such, delegate to. The code that actually makes DNS queries or reads /etc/passwd, etc., is in the form of NSS modules. Furthermore, additional NSS modules can be compiled and linked to, allowing developers to provide different ways to lookup hosts, users, etc.\nI'm trying to find the equivalent subsystem in OS X, but it seems to be something that has changed frequently over the years. Apparently an old system called NetInfo was used since the NeXtStep days, but that hasn't been around since 10.4. This was apparently superseded by something called lookupd, but I don't think it's present in Lion anymore either, since there's no lookupd process running on my system, and man lookupd redirects to dscacheutil.\nWhat is the current system Lion uses to delegate these kinds of lookups? Does Apple provide any documentation for writing new plugins for whatever this subsystem is, to allow for different backends to provide these services?\nAnother way to think of this question is: Which subsystem in OSX is responsible for reading /etc/hosts and resolving lookups based on its contents?\n\nA: I'm not very familiar with Linux, but it sounds like you're looking for Open Directory.  Warning: Apple uses this term to refer to all of the various parts of their directory service architecture, so if you google \"Open Directory\" you'll find both Apple's LDAP-based directory server, and the daemon that runs on OS X and does the function you're looking for.\nLet me try to give you a historical overview of its development (and hopefully I'll remember which changes happened in which version):\nNextSTEP (the OS that OS X was based on) had a daemon called lookupd that was, as I understand it, very similar to NSS.  Most of the actual data was stored in NetInfo databases (which could be either local on the computer, or accessed over the net from a server).\nEarly versions of OS X added another deamon, named DirectoryService, which did similar things (but a little differently); since it didn't do everything lookupd did, any query it couldn't find an answer to would get handed off to lookupd.  Result: a certain amount of redundancy and confusion.  IIRC, there were actually some queries that got directed to lookupd first, and them it might have to hand them off to DirectoryService.  There were also two different sets of plug-ins (equiv to NSS modules): those for DirectoryService and those for lookupd. Local users & groups were still stored in NetInfo, but it was deprecated for network accounts in favor of LDAP.\nI don't remember the details anymore, but over the versions responsibilities gradually got shifted from lookupd to DirectoryService.\nIn 10.5, NetInfo was removed; local users, groups, etc were stored in XML property list files under /var/db/dslocal/.  The plug-in (excuse me, they're called \"connectors\" now) to access them has the not-at-all-generic name \"Local\" (it's sometimes referred to as \"dslocal\" to disambiguate it a bit).  At this point, the only thing lookupd is still responsible for is DNS lookups (although it hands off multicast lookups to mDNSResponder).\nIn 10.6, lookupd was removed; mDNSResponder now handles all DNS lookups, both standard (unicast) and multicast.\nIn 10.7, the Open Directory daemon was renamed from DirectoryService to opendirectoryd.\n", "Q: How do I use my Logitech G9x mouse on Mac OS X Lion? I've got Logitech G9x mouse. Gaming mouse. Great mouse. \nLogitech doesn't support it under MacOS X. \nMouse works perfectly (as far as I can see ) with standard Mac OS driver.

I choose the \"Hide Input Source Name\" from the menu and the name goes away until I reboot.\nAny solutions?\n\nA: Another thing you could try would be to lock ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.menuextra.textinput.plist in Finder. (OS X performs atomic saves on preference files so chmod 600 wouldn't work.)\nAt least on my account the file contains just a ModeNameVisible key:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>ModeNameVisible</key>\n    <false/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n\nA: As suggested by @Lri\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox*\nworks, but you need to get the order right, \nfirst make sure the label is not showing \"Hide Input Source Name\" \nthen remove the files as suggested, I guess it is also necessary to restart as well, then add the keyboards (input sources) back.\nBut it comes back! \nThis is a bug or something, \nFor the record I am using \nDvorak-Qwerty\nU.S.\nPersian  \n", "Q: Is there an equivalent to the Windows 7 Problem Steps Recorder on macOS?

On the Apple product site it says the Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic aren't compatible with an iPhone 3G. I would assume, though, that the headphones and the mic will work, but the remote control buttons might not. However, the more basic version works with a 3G; these feature just one button to answer or end a call. So the main button of the more advanced earphones might work as well?\nHas anybody ever used the combination of an iPhone 3G and the Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic and can report on their compatibility?\n\nA: I just checked; the \"play/pause\" button works, but not the \"up/down volume\" buttons.\n", "Q: How do you reset screen zoom to zero?

Now, hunt for any lists you might still want to get rid off, e.g. none of the options mentioned in the answers already listed here helped to get rid of the recent-items list in Finders \"GO\" menu. I played around with the defaults command and found that: \"write com.apple.finder \"FXRecentFolders\" '({})' && killall Finder\" does the trick for me.

If I restart the Finder the problem goes away briefly. It's driving me nuts.\n\nA: This sounds like a bug; you can report it at bugreporter.apple.com with an Apple ID and password.\nCan you reproduce the problem, then check for new error messages in /Applications/Utilities/Console.app? There's a small chance that this will indicate the source of the problem.\n\nA: You might see a message in the console like this:\ncom.apple.quicklook.32bit[22808]): Job appears to have crashed: Abort trap: 6 \n\nYou should file as bneely says.\nHave you tried the usual stuff of repairing permissions, restarting etc.\nAlso, if you file a report, you should include your system.log (/var/log) and Apple System Profile report (About this Mac > More Info > System Report > save....)\n\nA: Some people recommended deleting your ~Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist file to fix it.  I wasn't able to simply delete the file to fix the problem.  I had to go into my back up account and make a copy of the file from ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist and then move it into my user account.  I'm sure you could do the same thing with your Guest user account, too.\nFor me, the problem was caused by making the text in QuickLook copyable.  I noticed when I turned on defaults write -g QLEnableTextSelection -bool true that the blank Quicklook bug was coming up as talked about in this thread.  When I turned it off, (defaults write -g QLEnableTextSelection -bool false) the problem went away.\n", "Q: Airport Extreme sharing 1TB disk I just bought an Airport Extreme thinking it was easy to share a USB disk.\nI'm very disappointed that this is taking so much time and still not working.\nThe disk is 1TB NTFS formatted.

I connect to the internet through a VPN provider along with other precautions in order to ensure privacy (against traffic analysis by agencies of a repressive government). I currently use Tunnelblick to configure and establish the VPN connection. Tunnelblick does not allow automatically connecting to the provider at or before login so I need to connect manually each time, and sometimes the connection is lost.\nI need any and all traffic to go through the VPN connection at all times; whenever the VPN isn't connectable for whatever reason, I want the fallback to be no connection. I need to ensure\n\n\n*\n\n*that OS X does not connect to the internet on my regular internet connection, or at all, during boot (until the login screen, for time synchronization and other possible \"call home\" stuff etc.). What services, if any, try to do this, and how can I practically analyze and change what's going on with networking during boot? Is there a way to connect to VPN earlier than right after login?\n\n*that if my VPN connection is temporarily lost, applications do not continue to communicate over my regular unencrypted connection. \nI basically want the system to act as if the network connection is lost altogether if the VPN connection fails, but currently they just continue to work as if nothing happened. What can I do to my system so that once a VPN is established, all traffic can only flow through that connection and no traffic can flow if the connection drops?\n\nA: You need a firewall between you and the Internet that will block all traffic except traffic to the IP address of your VPN host\nYour router will more than likely have this functionality built in\n\nA: Mac OS X includes the command line based ipfw command which allows you to set advanced local firewall rules.\nipfw works with rules which are written and checked in order. Therefore the low number rules are first checked towards the end of the list. There are two approaches when configuring firewalls:\n\n\n*\n\n*Closing the network + Allow traffic\n\n*Opening the network + Denying traffic\n\n\nIn your case you need to close off all traffic, and then only allow traffic to your VPN's IP address, using only the ports that your VPN uses.  This will prevent any stray packets from being able to get out so long as your rules are tight.\nThere are many great guides and tutorials on the net for ipfw which is widely used in many Unix and Linux operating systems, here are some:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/firewalls-ipfw.html\n\n*http://www.ibiblio.org/macsupport/ipfw/\n\n*http://freebsd.rogness.net/redirect.cgi?basic/firewall.html\nI suggest you investigate them and see if you are able to understand the command sufficiently to give it a go.  At a bare minimum I would recommend ensuring you know how to disable the firewall and clear the rules just in case you tie your machine in knots through misconfiguration!\nGood luck :)\n", "Q: Can someone else sign into my iTunes account to download my purchased apps? I buy many apps and I'd like to let my little cousin use my account to download games I've purchased.\nObviously Apple won't encourage accounts holders to share their accounts with relatives but what's the risk of doing so?\nI use my account on my iPhone and my iPad and he's got an iPad 2.\n\nA: Yes you can. And Apple actually doesn't discourage this behavior. While it's true they do warn users not to share their Apple ID, but that can be taken more as a security concern than one of theft. In the past, Apple has never been one to mince words about piracy (being vocal against music and movie theft).\nApple allows you to register a small number (5) of devices to a single Apple ID. So you can register your little cousins device, your girlfriend's device, or your dad's device without a care. \nThis helps consolidate purchases and in a lot of cases, helps device management in large households. \nThe drawbacks aren't many. You can withhold your password from those that you do not wish to make additional purchases using your ID. But this will restrict them from even installing free apps. And if they happen to log out, they will be unable to log in again. The decision how to handle your account's access is left to your discretion. Just note that you will be responsible for any purchases made on any device registered under your account. Typically Apple is quite good with refunds, but I'm not sure how they would handle one in this case. (It's likely that they will issue you a \"one-time\" refund and warn you that you will be responsible for any additional purchases made in the future.)\nAside from potentially having someone rack up your account, it's totally cool with Apple and a great way to get mileage on your app purchases. \n\nA: You asked \"Am i allowed to let someone else use my iTunes account?\"\nApple says you shouldn't:\n\n\"You shouldn't share your Apple ID account information with other people. Each person should have their own Apple ID.\" \n\nNote that they don't say you can't… and they do very little to stop you. Apple's DRM is fairly \"light\" and meant to keep honest people honest. Purchases aren't tied to a single device (I think you can install on up to 10) and can be re-downloaded at any time. \nIf developers find more and more people sharing their AppleIDs, they may push for more restrictive DRM in the future. Each actual lost sale takes money out of a developer's pocket: a developer who may have kids of his/her own to support.\nIf you're asking about the risk of Apple finding out, that seems fairly unlikely. What would they do if they found out? No one knows for sure, but they could terminate your account meaning that you'd have to re-purchase all the apps and music that you had purchased.\nOthers might say that you aren't doing anything except sharing and while sharing with 1,000 people might be wrong, sharing with 1 is probably statistically insignificant. They would say that your cousin doesn't necessarily reflect a lost sale for each of those apps, because they might not have purchased the same apps.\nI have friends who are iOS developers. I do my best to support the apps that I use frequently. My wife and mom share my Apple ID for purchases. I use 80% of the apps that I buy (20% are apps that I buy and then never use, because Apple doesn't have demos). They probably use less than 1% (I'm not sure my mother uses anything except WordsWithFriends, email, and Safari). When I decided to set my Mom up with a Simplenote premium account, I paid for a separate one rather than let her use mine. My wife and I have separate MotionX subscriptions. And when my mom's best friend bought an iPad, I set her up with her own account. In my mind, this frees me up to buy more apps to try more apps. Some will see that as nothing more than an attempt to justify my own behavior.\nSo those are the \"risks,\" such as they are. There are few concrete ones. \nAt the end of the day, the answer is \"you're not supposed to, but you can\" and it's up to you to decide what to do with that.\np.s. - the most likely \"risk\" isn't what Apple would do if they found out, it's the fact that you will almost certainly have to share your Apple ID password with your cousin. That password is needed for installing free apps and updates, but it can also be used for app\npurchases and in-app purchases which can run into the thousands. \nThat same password can be used for purchasing TV shows, movies, etc.\nYou'd be responsible for those charges. Unless you see your cousin often enough to do these updates yourself, that's the biggest (practical) risk you face.\n", "Q: Is there any way to block certain sites, eg MacKeeper? MacKeeper (and other sites) adverts pop up on some video sites which I find very irritating. Is there any way to block specific URLs in Safari?\nThis occurs both on Mac and iPad. Ideally, I'd like a solution I can directly apply to the iPad.\n\nA: I would suggest OpenDNS.  You can apply it to your entire network using their name servers and block categories or specific URL's.  Although the ad might show up as a frame to a 'Website Blocked' page from OpenDNS, you'll probably find it useful (it's free).\n\nA: My prefered solution is using glimmerblocker which is actually an ad blocker but can be also used to just block specific web sites/URLs. \nFor iDevices it's a bit more difficult (at least if not jailbroken). Glimmerblocker supports a proxy mode though which allows you to point Mobile Safari to the Mac running Glimmerblocker. Of course this requires both systems to be online.\n\nA: For MacOS the quickest way is to edit hosts file:\n\nsudo nano /etc/hosts\n\nadd the following line to the end of the file:\n\n127.0.0.1       mackeeper.com\n\n", "Q: How would I restore Spotlight search to my menu bar? (10.7) For some inexplicable reason, I decided to delete (not hide) Spotlight from my Mac via a terminal command.

I should note that I didn't reinstall the OS.\nThanks for the help. \n\nA: I would imagine that inverting your commands would do the trick. Try:\nsudo mdutil -a -i on\nsudo chmod 755 /System/Library/CoreServices/Search.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Search\nsudo killall SystemUIServer\n\n\nA: While there may well be a more granular approach, this should work (but will take a bit of time):\nStep 1: Back up your machine to an external drive using Time Machine\nStep 2: Boot holding ⌘R to boot from the restore partition\nStep 3: Re-install Lion\nStep 4: Use Migration Assistant to reinstall your documents and applications from your Time Machine backup.\nThis should leave you with an intact system, but all your data and applications.\n", "Q: Is there such thing as a 3rd generation 8GB iPod touch? They are advertised all over Kijiji and Craigslist - just wanted to make sure that the 3rd generation only came in 32 and 64GB.\n\nA: Here is the kb entry for the technical specification of the 3rd gen ipod touch. There are only 32 and 64 GB Models.\n\nA: This support page from Apple explains how to identify iPod models. I do not see a 3rd generation iPod Touch with a capacity of 8GB on this list.\n\nA: Working from memory here, so I could be mistaken, but at the time the third generation iPod touches came out, Apple released 32 and 64 GB models. It continued selling the second generation 8GB model alongside them. Someone who ordered an 8GB touch at the time when third generation models were on sale might well believe they have a third generation iPod touch, but there was no refresh of the 8GB model at that time.\n\nA: In 2008, the second generation iPod touch was released, in 8 and 32GB sizes. The next year, the third generation was released with 32 and 64GB. The 8GB 2g was sold alongside it, probably to make it look cheaper. This model doesn't have multitasking or homescreen wallpaper support, nor can it be upgraded past iOS 4.2.1. \nI do agree that this was confusing, and it even confused me when I bought the 8GB 2g. \nYou can identify if a touch 2g was bought before or after the 3g like so: go to Settings, General and About. Scroll down to the model; if it starts with MB, it's the older model. The 2g also has A1288 printed on the back of the device. \n", "Q: Is there a way to stream live video from an iPad to an Apple TV? AirPlay is a great feature for stream audio/video to iOS devices, but can you stream live video? For example, instead of recording the video and then streaming it, can you just stream on the fly? I want to shoot video with an iPad and stream it to an Apple TV on the same network.\nMirroring the default camera app essentially works for just video, but since audio is not being capture, there is no audio sent to the Apple TV. What are my options?\n\nA: I haven't tried it yet but according to these articles Ustream will enable you to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ustream Launches iPad-Optimized iOS App, Adds Apple AirPlay Support\n\n*UStream for iPad\n", "Q: External hard drive is snapping/making weird sounds in sleeping mode I have an external hard drive connected to macbook. When I am listening to music and my mac is not in sleeping mode everything is fine, but after 15 min. when display is turning off and music is still playing my hard drive has very weird behavior - it looks like it turning on/off every 40 seconds 'to load a little bit of music and continue sleeping' making simultaneously ugly sounds/snaps. I don't remember the same behavior when I used Windows.\n\nA: It's likely just the parking of heads and the disk wanting to stay in \"sleep\" mode. You can read more about that here.\nOne way to stop the disk from going to sleep (some external enclosures have extreme disk sleep settings to conserve power) is to use pmset.\nFor example, to prevent an attached disk from going to sleep while your device is plugged in to AC (charger) is as follows:\nsudo pmset -c disksleep 0\n\nIt's of note that this prevents all disks from going to sleep, not just the external enclosure.\npmset is the program that handles all power management settings on OS X. The Power Management Preference Pane is just a front end to that utility. All settings are persistent (saved on reboot) and are actually written to a plist (/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.PowerManagement.plist).\nAdditionally, you could try using HDAPM (I ran this for months before I moved to an SSD).\nI would suggest trying to use pmset to prevent the disk from sleeping. It works on most external enclosures, but if you find that it's not honored by your manufacturer, you may have to find an alternate method. I've found WD and some Seagate enclosures to be problematic. pmset is not a hack and should be honored by all device manufacturers; however if you find that yours is not, try heading over to their support forums. They may have a firmware update or more information.\nLastly, if you suspect the drive of premature failure, you'll have to run a proper analysis of the drive's physical health. Disk Utility is not a reliable program in this case, as it deals with filesystem structure and integrity. You will want to use either a 3rd party utility (like Disk Warrior) or better yet, the free tools supplied by the hard drive's manufacturer (which will most likely require Windows).\n\nA: You may have a drive hardware problem. If you are new to macs, you may have a drive that is formatted for Windows, and this possibly could also cause the noise.\nTo make sure that your drive is ok, you use Disk Utility. It's in the Utilities Folder, that is a sub-folder of Applications.\nRun Disk Utility, select your drive, and then Verify Drive. It should not take too long. If it does turn out you have a problem, you need to get your information off of that drive asap. Then you reformat that drive (again, using Disk Utility). Then finally, check the drive once again.\n", "Q: \"openssl sha1\" broken on Mac OS X Lion, or is there a maximum file size? I am attempting to install a VMware Fusion virtual machine with Windows 2008 R2 server, but I'm having problems with the ISO file I downloaded.\nI want to verify that the file is correct before attempting the installation, and the download page at Microsoft MSDN downloads mentions that the file has a SHA-1 checksum of X.\nSo, I googled on how to verify the SHA-1 digest for a file, and found this page:\n\nMac OS X: How to verify a SHA-1 digest\n  ...\n  openssl sha1 [full path to file]\n\nNow, here's the fun part. If I execute the command multiple times, I get different digest values.\nIs there any way I can, say, make a copy of the file (I know how to do this part), verify that the two copies are indeed the same (to detect that the file is changing, somehow, but I don't know how to compare files)?\nOr is there something fundamentally broken either with the \"openssl sha1\" command, or with my expectations of it?\nHere's a sample run:\nLasses-MacBook-Pro:Downloads lassevk$ openssl sha1 en_windows_server_2008_r2_with_sp1_x64_dvd_617601.iso  \nSHA1(en_windows_server_2008_r2_with_sp1_x64_dvd_617601.iso)= 6b8e9addd77fdaf7f26ca56729802112445d48ec\nLasses-MacBook-Pro:Downloads lassevk$ openssl sha1 en_windows_server_2008_r2_with_sp1_x64_dvd_617601.iso  \nSHA1(en_windows_server_2008_r2_with_sp1_x64_dvd_617601.iso)= db275e4640a61cf4021142bed7593390ebb1bc74\nLasses-MacBook-Pro:Downloads lassevk$ openssl sha1 en_windows_server_2008_r2_with_sp1_x64_dvd_617601.iso  \nSHA1(en_windows_server_2008_r2_with_sp1_x64_dvd_617601.iso)= a87acbd3b415440630251ca1f66ed64e444ae96f\nLasses-MacBook-Pro:Downloads lassevk$ ls -la en_windows_server_2008_r2_with_sp1_x64_dvd_617601.iso  \n-rw-r--r--@ 1 lassevk  staff  3166584832 Dec 12 01:02 en_windows_server_2008_r2_with_sp1_x64_dvd_617601.iso\n\n\nA: This was a faulty memory chip.\nI downloaded a program to test the memory, experimented with which chips it might be, and ended up removing one, which made the memtest program stop complaining.\nWhen I execute the \"openssl sha1\" command now, multiple times, it produces the same digest every time. Sadly, it's the wrong digest (as compared to the one posted on the web site), so I guess I have to redownload the file.\n", "Q: Reset Path for iOS cover I've recently started using Path for iOS. I changed the Cover image used, the one behind the activity, but how on earth can I reset it back to what it was when I downloaded the app, I can only now choose from my photo library.\n\nA: You can't. They say this in their documentation. They also say you can choose other images from the photographer who provided their stock cover art, but in fact you can't; you can leave the default image, change to one of your own, then change to another of your own, but that's all.\n\nOnce you change your initial cover photo, you cannot change it back to the original default cover, but you can change it to any other photo that you take or store in your photo library.\n\nI think this new version of Path is quite nice, but there are some rough edges, and you just bumped into one of them.\n\nA: You can opt to download nice Retina wallpapers for your iPhone and use it for your cover photo. Path doesn't (at least not in a very obvious way) lower the quality of photos uploaded to it. You can also check out fiftyfootshadows.net -- this is the person's blog who took the default cover photos of Path.\n", "Q: Who makes compact backpacks specifically sized for Macbook Air 11/13\" So I'm trying to skate this through as on-topic because I'm interested in items specific to the Air 11\" or 13\", rather than \"what's a good laptop case\". (I.e. third party hardware specific to Apple products.)\nI'm guess a significant portion of those toting an Air bought it for the portability, which of course is immediately made irrelevant by stuffing it in a backpack with an inch of padding designed to hold a 15.4\" beast. So my question is who makes a backpack sized to hold an Air without a lot of wasted space? That is, I'm talking about the laptop compartment itself, not the overall size of the bag.\n\nA: I have a 13\" MBA (bought in July 2011). I have the McKlein Montclare 15494 Small Netbook Laptop Case, and I love it! Here's a URL:\nhttp://www.mckleinusa.com/15474S.html\nApologies though - not a backpack, more a messenger bag or briefcase sort of deal.\nI own one in black. It exactly fits my 13\" MBA, so obviously you'll have a little extra room if you've only got an 11\". I like the amount of padding in the bag, and because it's on the thin side, it \"encourages\" me to keep my junk to a minimum.\nFYI, I can slide my iPad 2 in next to my MBA, and that's about exactly how big the padded sleeve part is.\n\nA: WaterField Design has a number of so-called sleeves that fit MacBook Airs. They're not complete backpacks with shoulder straps and all. But the company's Muzetto bag line has 11\" and 13\" models that claim to fit the MacBook Airs. \nI have a few WaterField products. They're nicely made, and made in the USA as well.\n\nA: I have a Ristretto for 11\" MacBook Air (there's a 13 too) with the Absolute strap and the Guardian Dual Function Light. I also added an extra 16 inch key strap. I've got the Cocoa/Cayenne color.\n\nPROS: Very light, very easy to use, \"decent\" space to put stuff (but not by a wide margin as you may imagine. Very nice materials. The strap is very comfortable and given that a MBA11 is very light (1kg) the whole thing is very light (which is what I wanted).\nCONS: Not a cheap thing. You can pay close to 200 u$s if you add stuff. Perhaps the only gripe I'd add is that the compartment where you put the computer could be 1/4 inch taller (yeah), because I doesn't have a locking mechanism, you just insert the computer in there and fold it in (then you close the bag of course). But the MBA11 barely fits (in height) in that compartment, making it hard to keep it closed. Hard to explain. It's not something too annoying but it happens. Maybe if the folding piece were a little bit larger, it would fit deeper and therefore this wouldn't be an issue. Take a look at picture \"m\" in the website and you will see what I'm talking about. That thing doesn't like staying in there :)\nThe nature of the bag also means that if you put too many things in there, although it will close and lock, one of the sides may not cover and the interior may be seen.\nWould I recommend this?\nYes, it took me a while to find a specific MBA 11 bag (not just case, I didn't want a case). And this one coming from Tom Bihn (good reputation) was exactly what I was looking for. \nPricey if you add stuff, but you don't really have to. \n\nA: I like incase's design and bought a lot ( more than 3, from MBP/MBA 13 to MBP 15 ). And I am seek for a new backpack/sling for my new MBA 13.\nJust find your love at Incase's WebSite. Personally recommend this one\nIf you only need a compact BACKPACK, Cote & Ciel Flat Backpack will be a good choice. Unfortunately, the minimize size is for 15'.\n\nA: Timbuk2 has a lot of options when it comes to carrying your devices, be it full-sized laptops, tablets or e-readers. \nhttp://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/shop?size=8.9,12.8,0.7 \n\nA: Check out the DODObag if you are after a messenger style bag, although intended for the iPad it should fit the Air - reasonable price as well\nhttp://www.dodocase.com/products/dodobag\n\nA: I have a proper backpack, slim & professional looking, that is perfect dimensions for a Macbook Air 13\" & can hold a few other books & papers too, but is very lightweight.  Unfortunately it's not really built for laptops & is wearing out from the inside.  Worse, it's maker, Hobo International, doesn't seem to be making them anymore.  I've emailed them to complain, I'll let you know if they get back to it.  But it's really surprising no one thinks that there are business people who care about ergonomics / needing two straps.\n", "Q: Cannot use VPN after install Charles web proxy I installed the Charles web proxy, now if I start VPN and without starting Charles, I cannot browse the web. The web browser says proxy error. But i unchecked all the proxy in web connections.\nI wonder what Charles has done to my computer. Right now, I have to run Charles simultaneously with VPN, which is annoying. Anyway to solve it? Thanks.\n\nA: Fixed.\nCharles use itself as a web proxy to sniff on every request passing through the network interface. Besides turn off Charles in its proxy settings, you still need to check if the web proxy is turned off in your mac's network settings.\nAs every VPN has its own proxy settings, don't forget to turn off web proxy in VPN.\n", "Q: Are there any other dynamic iOS icons besides the calendar app? The iOS Calendar app dynamically changes every day, showing the current date and weekday. Are there any other dynamic icons, either provided by Apple or 3rd parties?\nI'm not talking about the little red circle in the corner letting you know how many updates there are, but rather the entire icon. Jail-broken examples would be interesting, but I'm more interested in jailed examples.\n\nA: The clock icon is dynamic since iOS 7.\n\nA: I don't have any jailed examples, I am sorry. AFAIK, it's not possible.\n", "Q: Can I manually update my display driver? I've recently acquired a MacBook Pro. It's a 13 inch model which comes with an Intel HD Graphics 3000 display card.\nI've had a few issues lately (such as flickering graphics in certain games and on youtube when hardware acceleration is used), and what I would do on a Windows machine is simply download and install the latest drivers to see if that helps.\nIs this even an option when using a Mac? Or is this something I can't (and don't need to) worry about?\n\nA: There are no driver updates for components found within a MacBook Pro (or any Mac for that matter) found anywhere but through Apple's own update system. And as you say, it's not something you need to worry about.\nThey retain tight control over their components and mainly make driver changes through OS updates rather than parse everything into individual packages. However, they may release small updates that attend to these kinds of glitches periodically or when a serious issue arises.\nSo long as Software Update reports no new updates, you will be running the latest drivers available for your Mac. You won't find alternate drivers elsewhere.\nAdditionally, what you describe is not normal and I would suggest you see a Genius at an Apple Store (not a licensed vendor). They will investigate and you may just walk out with a new machine. Apple has legendary service; make use of it. \n\nA: Most updates come from Apple through the Software Update process, but there are some updates where it's been fine to download / install the manufacturer's drivers. If you go to the intel site and look for this graphic card, if there is a Mac updater, I believe you'll be ok using it. Make sure that the model type and OS version match. \nFinally, the OS is usually smart enough to know if an update is ok to use and will refuse to install one that is not appropriate.\nHope this helps..\nOne more idea.. If you can demonstrate the flickering graphics, you may want to call AppleCare, or visit a store, to show them. This may be a problem unrelated to the driver.. (hardware , power requirements, etc)\n", "Q: How to a pull a window to my second monitor that's above the current one when the menu bar is in the way?

Complex vector content such as maps and blueprints -- which places a heavier load on the graphics subsystem -- is getting the biggest boost, with improvements in the 22% - 32% range. High-resolution scans, which places more of an emphasis on disk I/O and memory, is seeing a more modest 8% - 19% improvement.

What can I do short of taking it in for repair?\n\nA: According to HT1430 there isn't much more that you can do:\n\nRestarting your device\n\n\n*\n\n*Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button for a few seconds until the red \"slide to power off\" slider appears, and then slide the slider.\n\n*Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button until the Apple logo appears.\n\n\nFollow these steps to reset your device\nNote: Reset your device only if it is no longer responding and the steps above do not work.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button together for at least ten seconds, until the Apple logo appears.\n\n\n\nGot an Apple Retail Store nearby for a visit to the Genius Bar?\n\nA: What you are seeing/describing as a \"light Apple\" is the result of a display that was displaying the logo, and then power was cut. The pixels are still displaying the image but there is no power to the device so nothing is backlit. Additionally, if you cannot get your device to boot, it is likely that something related to the power distribution has caused the device to stop working. No power = no boot. (This post reminds me of an old iPod video I used to have)\nHow do you charge your iPad? Does the bottom of the power brick say \"10W USB Power Adapter\"? If not, then that throws up a red flag right there.\nHas your iPad been exposed to humidity or moisture (liquids) of any kind?\nHas your power supply (the power to the building that powers the socket) experienced an outage or surge recently?\nAny of these things could have caused the problem you are experiencing. Then again, it could also be something related to the display connection, firmware, etc.\n", "Q: Exclude from log by pattern matching I want to exclude some firewall notices and certain benign error messages from the system logs.\nThey occur every few seconds and make it hard to find real problems, especially when the files get rotated away.\nman syslog.conf does not mention string pattern matching like it does on Linux. Can Apple's daemon do it? Are there other options?\n\nA: The command grep -v allows filtering out a term or regex from the input. You can use a pipe (|) to combine multiple grep -v commands.\nExample: grep -v firewall /var/log/system.log | grep -v imagent | grep -v mdworker\nThe first grep command in this example operates on the file contents; the subsequent grep commands operate on the output of the previous grep command.\ngrep is located at /usr/bin/grep on my Lion system. For more information on using grep, read the man page with the command man 1 grep or just man grep.\n\nEdit: Command line can be shortened to\ngrep -v 'firewall\\|imagent\\|mdworker' /var/log/system.log\n\n", "Q: Add custom options to Apache Vhost config In Snow Leopard Server I was able to add lines to the Apache vhost files in /etc/apache2/sites in order to add custom configuration options.\nIn Lion Server those changes are overwritten as soon as the Web service is restarted. Is there any way to add such configuration options in a way they'll be preserved?\n\nA: Yes. In Lion, you do this by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Creating a .conf file that contains your custom Apache configuration directives\n\n*Creating a .plist file in /etc/apache2/webapps that references your configuration file — see the manage for webapp.plist\n\n*Running webappctl to load your configuration file into one or more of your websites (virtual hosts) — see the manage for webappctl\n\n\nA bit more about this can be seen at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4813\n", "Q: Can I release as opensource an iPad application I develop? Suppose I want to develop for iPad or iPhone. Can I release the code of this application on a public git repo, and under an opensource license ?\n(side comment: I consider shocking that I have to ask such a question, since the software is mine, but considering the times we live in...)\n\nA: Yes, you can, but there are some important things to keep in mind.\nFirst off, I'll note that I'm not a lawyer or intellectual property expert. This is just my opinion, as informed as I can make it.\nTo my knowledge there's no prohibition in the App Store rules about what you do with your source code. The main issue arises when there's a conflict between the licence of the source code (i.e. the GPL) and the App Store. This was the problem with the VLC app that Ian C referenced in the comments, particularly with regards to other open source libraries used in an app.\nAnother issue is when not all the code belongs to you - i.e. others have contributed and hold copyright on parts of the code. You can't submit something to the App Store that you don't have the rights to, so everyone who owns the code in the project must agree.\nThat said, if we're talking about a program that you've developed entirely on your own, without code from other projects or people, then you're free to do with it whatever you feel like - you can release it on the App Store, licence it under anything you want (the licence applies to what others do with it, not you).\nThere are some open sourced apps on the app store, you can find a partial listing here\n", "Q: How to fix a Lion upgrade that killed SSH keys?

Or more likely you will need to ask them to run a second instance of sshd on a secondary port with debug turned on, doing this should tell you what the key error is.\nsshd is quite a bit tricky when it comes to this, for good reason. On the server you are ssh'ing to, the administrator will have to run a command such as /usr/sbin/sshd -d -p 2222\nWhen running sshd in debug mode, it will handle the first connection, spew out lots (and I do mean lots of output), and then terminate the server. Issuing -p means run the server on port 2222, which is necessary because it can't take over the default port of 22 where the server is normally running.\nYou will then have to run ssh -p 2222 70.32.90.120 (you don't need -v in this instance). The server's logs should then give you the exact reason that your private key is being rejected from the server. Note that this exchange may need to occur multiple times, because ssh is very stringent when it comes to security, and you may find multiple failures in the process.\n\nA: I would start with one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*distributing the new keys\n\n*re-load the old keys from a backup and do the work to ensure Lion server is actually using the old keys.\n\n\nThe former always seems like more work initially, but I find it to always be faster than the latter. ymmv\n", "Q: Advice and information for installing a SSD into MBP with fresh Lion Tomorrow I am going to buy a OCZ Vertex 3 (240GB) and then I want to upgrade my MacBook Pro (late 2011) and install a fresh Lion system without copying any files with SuperDuper etc. Now I would like to know, whether it is necessary to flash the SSD via Windows (as I've sometimes...) before plugging it in to the MacBook.\nFurthermore I would like to know whether I can install Lion without the need to pay the 23€ in the \"AppStore of the Installer\" (wanted to create bootable USB stick with Lion Installer on it - otherwise I must do the \"Packages\"-hack to prevent from online-check/download) as I have bought my MacBook only a few days ago with Lion shipped on it.\nLast but not least, any further advice or things I must pay attention of?\nEDIT: I found the Lion Recovery Disk Assistant which seems to be vera cool... however I want to know whether I can reinstall Lion on my new SSD without having to log on to the AppStore which was necessary for a time to check whether I have purchased Lion properly. Can anyone tell me whether this will work how I expect it to do so?\n\nA: In the case of OCZ, it will make your life monstrously less insufferable if you ensure the drive has the latest firmware revision before installing it in your Mac, as OCZ does not support OS X (they provide a mixed bag of solutions that require a decent level of computer expertise and Linux distributions which are rickety at best). They make great hardware but have deplorable Apple support even after all these years.\nYou can view the latest firmware for your drive here. The utility requires either Windows or Linux and a working networking connection. It is also recommended you back up your data as the update could wipe it, so naturally it is best to do on a fresh drive. v2.1.5 has been out for a while so it is quite likely you won't need to update. Support forums are available in case you do.\nIf Lion shipped with the unit, you are in luck. The computer is capable of using both the Lion Recovery Disk Assistant or the Online Lion Recovery process (hold COMMAND+R after you hear the chime. Both will download Lion and install it for you. All new machines have their unique identifiers registered with Apple, so barring a complete logic board swap, they will always have access to Lion without the need to pay for the OS. In fact, your copy of Lion operates entirely outside of the Mac App Store.\nNote: Be wary of partitioning tools (like SuperDuper, etc.) as Lion has a Recovery HD (weighing in at 650 MB) installed alongside the OS. This is there to either help with the reinstallation or diagnose and repair your system. It does not house the entire operating system, but rather things like Terminal and Disk Utility. Currently, partitioning tools do not clone this partition and the one's that are including this feature, are still in the experimental stages. Be careful.\nPersonally, I would verify the drive has the latest firmware revision and then install it in your Mac. Use either the Lion USB stick you created via the Recovery Disk Assistant or the built in Online Recovery and install Lion. That's it.\n\nA: You need to format and partition the SSD just as you would a hard disk. Use disk utility, give it one partition with GUID in prefs and install Lion.\nI don't know what your current Lion situation is so I can't comment on how to install it but you do need to format an SSD just as you would a hard disk.\n", "Q: Set iPhone ringtone for filtered email messages Is there a way on the iPhone that a certain subset of incoming emails (coming through Exchange) will ring a specific ringtone (a real one, not just a beep)?\nIn the Blackberry world, you would set an email filter that marks these emails as priority 1, and have a different ringtone for priority 1 messages. I'm hoping to accomplish the same thing with an iPhone.\nThanks\n\nA: I don't believe there's a native way to do this, but you could set up server side rules (via Outlook Web Access, server side so they always process) to forward particular messages to a notification service, such as Boxcar (www.boxcar.io), then configure individual sounds using their iOS app.\nHere's a page that shows how to setup forwarding rules in OWA (chosen randomly via Google):\nhttp://programs.cocc.edu/OWA/FW/default.aspx\nOne catch with this is that, as far as I can tell, the Rules functionality is only available in Internet Explorer, at least with Exchange 2007. I tried this in Chrome and Safari on my Mac at home and the option isn't available.  I've heard non-IE browser support is better for Exchange 2010.

I am not interested in fetching the associated data (as they are non-English comic books, which typically aren't in any of the big databases as e.g. Amazon)\n\nA: Delicious Monster makes an awesome piece of software called Delicious Library that's intended to do exactly what you're after: scan and catalog your library (of books and other things). And it all works through your iMacs built-in iSight camera. And it works very, very well. From their website:\n\n“Wait, I just hold a CD or DVD or video game or book or whatever up to my webcam, and it magically reads the UPC and downloads that item’s cover and all pertinent information about it, and displays all my stuff on photorealistic shelves? I’ll take it! Right now! This is why I bought a computer in the first place! ”\n\nYea, it's very cool to watch it in action. Very easy to use.\n\nA: Delicious Library wasn’t made just for scanning a list and dumping it out, but it could be used for such a thing. After scanning in your items you’d either want to slurp the results using a custom AppleScript or you can use our export-to-CSV feature and only do the ISBN column.\n\n\n*\n\n*If a book doesn’t look up on Amazon there’s an error window that pops up, and with two clicks you can add it as a blank book.\n\n*We consider the ISBN-13 and ISBN-10 to be interchangeable, so we only store the one that’s standard, which is the 13. In the examples I’ve seen the barcode is actually an EAN-13, so we don’t even have access to the ISBN-10, we’d have to synthesize it.\n-Wil Shipley\nChief Monster,\nDelicious Monster Software\n\nA: Buy a cheap USB barcode scanner that is OSX compatible and it scans it just as if it was entered into a keyboard.

I worked with iPhoto for a while, tagging photos with faces. Now when I view my own faces, I see \"Steven Fisher may be in 8 additional photos.\"\nI click Confirm Additional Faces, then click to confirm each additional face. I click Done. There's no error message, but I still see \"Steven Fisher may be in 8 additional photos.\" And when I click Confirm Additional Faces, I see the same eight photos.\nI can repeat this over and over again. I've recursively changed the permissions on the photo library to 777, changed the owner, rebuilt the library (letting iPhoto change the permissions), but nothing's helped. I once fixed this by completely deleting the library, re-adding all the photos to it, but it died again within a few weeks (and, of course, I lost a ton of metadata I'll never get back). What else could be wrong?\n\nA: It didn't happen to me with the latest version of iPhoto yet. But the only solution I found to fix this kind of issues in iPhoto '09 without trashing the entire iPhoto library was to remove only the Faces related files. With the '11 version the procedure would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close iPhoto\n\n*Find your iPhoto library\n\n*Right click on the photo library and chose \"Show Package Content\"\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to the Database directory\n\n\n\n\nEdit: If you save your iPhoto library regularly you can restore the files instead of deleting them.

The feature, however, does not appear to exist, either as a toolbar option, nor as a Message menu command, nor as a context menu command, nor as an item in the Help file for Mail. The aforelinked document says \"Lion\" in its title, but refers to Mail 4.0; the Mail program under Lion is Mail 5.1.\n\nThis may or may not have anything to do with Apple's acknowledgement that bounce does not always dissuade spammers.\n", "Q: X takes a long time to load under Lion I recently upgraded to Lion.

Is there anything else that it can still do at that point? For example, will there be a log written about this? Can there still be situations when it is so frozen that it cannot restart itself? Is there danger of accidental restarts when it is not really or only temporarily frozen? This does not happen when a single application decides to beach-ball, right?\n\nA: The Mac models that support this have a secondary processor, independent of the CPU (it's the LOM on Intel Xserves, SMC on regular Macs).  Basically, the secondary processor can have a countdown timer set up, and reset the CPU (forcing a reboot) if the counter hits 0.  Meanwhile, a process running within OS X (originally it was a program called watchdog, but I think launchd handles it now) resets the counter periodically.\nIf the OS ever gets hosed enough that launchd/watchdog/whatever fails to reset the counter within the time limit, the LOM/SMC/etc takes over and forces a reboot.\nBTW, regarding @TJ Luoma's comment on kernel panics: when a panic occurs, the OS is basically dead.  There's no way for launchd to be notified of this, because it's dead along with everything else.  What happens is that some information about the panic gets stuffed into NVRAM (the surviving shreds of the OS can access that without needing drivers, etc, which all went away in the panic).  After reboot, the NVRAM is checked and (if appropriate) its contents are reported in the panic log.\n", "Q: Lion OS Remove Categorizing in Finder i just got my hands on lion after some years in previous mac versions.

My iPhone was still on 80% battery. Then in the middle of my game, my iPhone gradually gets heated up a lot and then it automatically shuts down. I thought maybe the iPhone just needs to cool down and left it on my table.\nThis morning when I pick up my iPhone again, I realise I couldn't turn it on. When I plug in the iPhone into my computer to charge, it gets unusually hot. I attempt to do a reset by pressing and holding the sleep and home button but nothing happens. I'm so worried now.\nWhat could have happened to my iPhone 3GS? Any other ways to get my iPhone working again?\n\nA: I used to see this occasionally when I worked at the Apple Store. If it gets really hot while it's charging but there's nothing on the screen, it's most likely still alive. It could be hard locked up by a runaway process from the app you were using that can't quit . \nFor phones with a removable battery, you might just pull the battery for a few seconds and replace it and then restart the phone. You can't pull the battery on the iPhone, but sometimes attempting to restart it while it's on power will break it out of the black screen. Try plugging it into your computer and holding down both the sleep/wake button and home button (same as how you tried to reset it before) for at least 15-30 seconds and see if you get the Apple logo. \nThe other thing you might want to try is putting it in DFU mode and then rebooting it normally again. You can find the steps here. Don't try anything crazy, just boot it into DFU (screen should be black) and then restart it how the instructions say.\nIf it's still not restarting, take it off the charger and let it sit overnight to try and allow whatever charge is left on the battery to run down. Then, plug it in to a power source and attempt to restart it by holding the sleep/wake and home button. This is really tedious to wait on, but I had people bring me phones that could magically be rebooted after sitting all night until the battery ran out.\nOne last method, as a last resort: If you have a backup, you might want to attempt to put it in recovery mode and restore it. Sometimes it will go into recovery even if there's nothing happening on the screen. To do this, plug your cable into the computer, and then hold down the home button on the phone. Keep holding home and plug the other side of the cable into the phone. Continue holding down the home button until you see the message in iTunes that the phone is in recovery mode. RESTORING YOUR PHONE WILL ERASE ALL YOUR DATA so don't do this right off the bat if you don't have your stuff backed up. Try less the less destructive methods of troubleshooting first. You can also do a restore from DFU mode if iTunes will recognize the phone.\nI'm pretty sure your phone isn't going to explode, but if you just can't get it going again, it might be a good idea to take it to an Apple store if you can get to one. There's never a charge to look at your phone and you're not under any obligation to have service done on the phone if there will be a fee. But if you want to, you can check the status of your warranty (a very few of the 3GS phones are under warranty still, especially if there's been AppleCare on the phone) at selfsolve.apple.com.\nIf the phone can be powered on eventually, they have a diagnostic tool called Behavior Scan that they can run at no charge that will tell you if your phone is overheating or what particular apps are hanging the phone up. However, keep in mind that if you've recently restored your phone it won't return much useful information.\nIt could be a poorly written app that's hanging your phone, or it might need a software update or a restore. If you can get it going again, it would be a good idea to check if you're running the latest software and that your apps don't need updates either. These things tend to be more software related than hardware, but if it keeps shutting off and a factory restore won't fix it, you might be looking at some bad memory in the phone or a logic board issue so keep that in mind. \nI am assuming that the phone has not been wet or been subjected to physical damage. If it has been, that might be a factor as well. I'm also assuming the phone is not jailbroken. If it is, be careful with restoring it because you can end up bricking your phone if you're not paying attention.\n\nA: I've noticed the iPhone gets hot during 3D games, but combined with the spontaneous shutdown is a cause for concern.\nIt's possible something has shorted out.  Don't use it or it may explode.  This can be caused by a manufacturing fault, dropping it one-too-many times, or a build up of dirt.\nFirst, clean out the charging port with cleaning alcohol and a cotton bud or compressed air.  Try to charge it or turn it on any see if it still gets hot.  If so, get it serviced.  It'll likely be something wrong with the battery or one of its circuits.\n", "Q: iPhone 3G upgraded to iOS 4, does it now support multitasking? Can anybody clarify the availability of multitasking on an iPhone 3G? \nI went through several documents in Apple's HI guidelines, which state that:\n\nMultitasking is available on certain devices running ios4 and later.\n\nWhat does it actually mean? I have an iPhone 3G which doesn't support multitasking, so now if I upgrade my iPhone 3G to iOS4 or later, will it support multitasking?\n\nA: Only iPhone 3GS and later support multitasking.  iPhone 3G does not, regardless of which version of iOS is installed, unless you jailbreak it.\n\nA: The processor has nothing to do with multitasking capability.\nIt's a software feature that you can enable by jailbreaking the iPhone.\n\nA: Easy way to check: double-press home button and if a bar slides up from the bottom, you've got \"multitasking\".\n\nA: As Rob Mayoff said, Only iPhone 3GS and later support multitasking. iPhone 3G does not.\nHowever there is a method to enable multitasking on iphone 3G.To enable multitasking on Iphone 3G. You have to download Red Snow on PC and after that download iphone Firmware 4.0(recommended) or later.Plug in your iphone to PC. Install Red Snow in your PC. Then install the iphone firmware 4.0 in your iphone. The iphone will be jailbreaked and will now support multitasking.\n\nA: Iphone 3G does not support multitasking, even with iOS4. \nIt also does not support voicecontrol or even the last update to iOS4.3. My iphone 3G only updates to iOS4.2.1 :(\n\nA: The key here is the processor the 3G uses. Only the 3GS and later have a processor capable of supporting iOS's multitasking. As noted, there are options with jailbreaking, if you prefer to go that route.\n", "Q: How can I move the Downloads toolbar button in Safari 5.1 and newer on OS X? In Safari 5.1 on my Mac, the Downloads button appears on the toolbar at the right of the search bar when you download a file for the first time:\n\nI want to move that button elsewhere on the toolbar, so I open View > Customize Toolbar... and drag it to where I want it. The other toolbar controls move to make way for the new spot, but when I drop it, nothing changes; the Downloads button returns to its original position.\nInterestingly, I don't have this problem on Safari 5.1 on Windows; I can move the button anywhere I want. I'm not sure if it has anything to do with these observations:\n\n\n*\n\n*The list of downloads appears as a window on Windows, but as a popover on OS X.\n\n*The Downloads button appears by itself in the Customize Toolbar window on Windows, but not on OS X, where it only appears in the default toolbar set instead.\n\n\nHow can I reposition the Downloads button in Safari on OS X?\n\nA: Drag the other controls around it; as long as you don’t grab the Downloads button itself this will work.\n\nA: \nI managed it—look at the picture above! Right-click → Customise Toolbar and move the URL bar out, then move it back in on the right.\n", "Q: How can I use iCal and the iPhone calendar when I am travelling? I often move between Ireland, Germany/Switzerland (same timezone) and Israel.\nI use MobileMe, iCal and (two) iPhones.\nThe problem is that Apple's calendar applications seem to assume that everything I do involves conference calls which happen at the same time in physical reality and hence in different times in each time zone.\nI have lunch at 1 PM, regardless of whether I am in Ireland or Israel. I do not want to remember what time it is in Ireland when it is 1 PM in Israel when I make a note, in Dublin, for my lunch appointment in Tel Aviv.\nI tried several settings (time zone support off, time zone support on) but nothing really works.\nIf I switch time zone support off (on ALL my devices), my lunch dates fluctuate a lot and I miss appointments because 3 PM is not 3 PM any more.\nIf I switch time zone support off (and miss one device), my appointments are subject to weird changes produced by the one device should I accidentally use it.\nI finally concluded that it is best to leave time zone support on and tell all devices and computers that they are in Ireland. That way my lunch dates don't change any more.\nBut now all iCal and iPhone alerts are off and, here in Switzerland, alert me an hour late and for the wrong time.\nHow can I configure iCal and the iPhones to IGNORE time zones. I really have more local appointments than conference calls and iCal's behaviour is only good for conference calls.\n\nA: I think you might want to try the \"floating\" time zone; I believe this will let an event be at a specific hour, regardless of the time zone.\n(As for why use time zones at all: We have an office in Zurich, Switzerland, and one in New York, US, and we share some of our calendars; having time zone support means, as an example, that I can see at a glance if somebody's at a meeting in New York (and thus I should maybe call them later).)\nPS: Also see Changing the time zone for an event, but note iCal: Floating time zone Calendar events are not supported on iPod touch / iPhone or MobileMe Calendar; iCloud supports \"floating\" (just tested), not sure about the iPhone...\n\nA: I now include the actual time in the title of the event.  For example:  \"9am Flight LAX -JFK\"  This way, if the phone changes my time setting (which it inevitably does regardless of how I have it set) I will still know what time my flight is. Doesn't work for alerts, but I often enter flight info in a different time zone from where I will take the flight and this helps to keep me from missing a flight.\n\nA: the only viable option i've found is to:\n1) if you use iCloud, do not sync your mac and your i-device to the same calendar. i know this sounds stupid, but if you sync your mac and i-device to the same calendar, it is bound to mess things up.\n2) turn timezone support on on your mac and choose the \"floating\" timezone when entering an event.\n3) on your i-device, turn on timezone support, and select appropriate timezone for each entry (pain in the ass)!\nsimilar issue exists with the mail program both on mac and iOS. if you email me from LA at 1am and say i am in NYC, your email will show as being sent at 4am. and if i reply to you immediately, the quoted text will say something like \"on Jul 19 at 4:00am, you wrote\".\nwell, it is only 1am in your town, so how could you have written me at 4am? and if go back and forth, pretty soon we won't' be able to tell who say what at what time. the problem is even more pronounce across international border.\ni've sent feedback to apple about this many times, but they seem to think their way is smarter.\n\nA: The only thing that works for me without complication is to put the local time in the event title -- everything else is too confusing.  It seems that apple could make this simpler.\n\nA: well, i just played with my iPhone and mbp a bit, and here is a possible solution.\nhere is the setup:\nsuppose you are in NYC. enable both timezone support on your mac and iPhone. on the iPhone, go to settings, mail calendar > timezone support and select new york. enter all events with the appropriate timezone (PAIN), and sync with iCloud, don't worry.\nnow when you travel to other city like LA, you must remember to go to settings > mail calendar > timezone support and manually change the timezone to LA, as there is no automatic way to do this. now everything will show up at the right time.\ni know this probably won't work for me because i'll always forget to change the timezone when i travel to other cities, so my schedule will show me the wrong time. \nnow i don't know if you set the alarm, whether it will go off even you don't manually change the time zone.\n", "Q: How can I make auto-hide/show for the dock faster? I really like the auto-hide feature of the dock in Mac OS X.\nHowever, the animation for the dock to reappear is just a bit too slow for me. Since this is quite annoying, I disable the feature.\n\nIs it possible to manually shorten the time for the dock\n  to reappear?\n\nBtw: I am aware that one can use the key-combo ⌥⌘D to toggle auto hide/show for the dock. But I want solution without using the keyboard.\n\nA: I also find the Dock slow to use and the Launchpad can be sluggish. You might want to try an application launcher such as LaunchBar or Alfred. The former is a paid program (with a free demo), the latter is free. Either let you very quickly launch apps along with hundreds of other functions with applications, files, folders, and more. I don't use, or miss, the Launchpad or the Dock... even on a new Mac they are too slow, not to mention being mouse driven.\n\nA: To make it a tiny bit easier... here jonathan's answer, with semi colons so it can all be copied and pasted into the terminal window in one go. (And I tweaked the animation time to how I like it) BIG BIG Kudos to Jonathan for this suggestion, I tried to vote him up but I don't have enough rep!\nOpen Terminal and copy the following code into it :)\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -int 0; defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 1.0; killall Dock\n\nTweak the -float number to change animation time\n\nA: To make the Dock instantly leap back into view when it’s needed, rather than slide, open a Terminal window and type the following:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -int 0;killall Dock\n\n\nI find this useful, but if you’d like the animation for the dock to reappear to last for a split-second, try the following:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0.15;killall Dock\n\nTo explain, changing \"0.15\" with any number can let you tailor things as it represents the time in seconds taken for the dock to reappear fully.\n\nTo revert back to the default sliding effect, open a Terminal window and type the following:\ndefaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier;killall Dock\n\n\nA: You can manually set the time it takes for the dock to appear.\n\nUnlike the autohide-time-modifier tip posted by Marius Butuc, this command does not remove the animation of the Dock when it appears.\nFirst, activate auto-hide in System Preferences → Dock → Autohide or type ⌘+⌥+D\nThen open the Terminal and type:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 0; killall Dock\n\n\n\n*\n\n*0 is the time it takes for the Dock to appear in seconds. You can choose floats and integers e.g. 2, 0.5,...\n\n*killall Dock causes the Dock to restart.\n\n\nRestore the default behavior using...\ndefaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-delay; killall Dock\n\nNote that com.apple.dock is case sensitive.\nAccording to MacOSHints this trick was found by reverse engineering from the developer Christian Baumgart of Hyperdock.\nThis command only works in OS X 10.7 or newer.\n\nA: The modifications in both @gentmatt's and @Marius Butuc's answers are important. I did some testing and in my opinion the delay (before the slide animation starts) should be zero while the animation duration should be 0.4s (to feel natural but fast). You can easily apply these settings by hiding your Dock ( > Dock > Turn Hiding On or ⌥⌘D) and entering these commands in Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -int 0\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -float 0.4\nkillall Dock\n\nYou can change the values for 0 and 0.4 to see if a different setting works better for you. Don't forget to change int to float if you want to use a float instead of 0.\nIf you don't like it, you can undo the changes using these commands:\ndefaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-delay\ndefaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier\nkillall Dock\n\n\nA: Nice tutorial, but the problem is that it still takes some to show up after you point your mouse to the dock area. To reduce the delay you need to use this code instead\ndefaults write com.apple.Dock autohide-delay -float 0 && killall Dock\n\nThis way it comes up instantly! And you might want to leave a 1 second animation so that it looks nice and smooth \ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -int 1 && killall Dock\n\n\nA: This is a bit of a kludge, but it does make the Dock appear slightly faster.\nIf your Dock is on the right side of your screen (mine is; vary this for your desired Dock location), set upper and lower right Hot Corners to trigger Launchpad. When the mouse hits a hot corner, it triggers the action instantly, as opposed to after a brief delay with Dock Hiding. If the Dock is hidden and Launchpad gets triggered, the Dock appears. Ignore Launchpad; click what you want on your Dock.\nSo if you move the mouse to the edge, you get the Dock to appear after a brief delay, but hit either corner and the Dock appears faster. There's distracting action on the rest of the screen (i.e. Launchpad), but if you can ignore it, you get your desired results.\n\nA: @gentmatt, I always install Secrets on my computer. It has lots of various system and application variables that you can toggle or set and the dock animation is one of them. It also allows you to put spacers on the dock to organize it by block a little. And the best thing is that it works as a control panel so no Terminal experience is required. http://secrets.blacktree.com\n\nA: Short answer: There's no known way to actually speed up the animation.\nBut you might be able to make it marginally faster with a few tweaks.\nYour best bet is to get one of the 3rd-party \"tweaker\" apps such as Cocktail or TinkerTool and disable any of the eye candy related to the Dock.\nI'd recommend TinkerTool as it has more Dock-related options right now.\nIn particular, I'd recommend turning off \"Use transparent Dock icons to show hidden applications\". And turn on \"Disable the three-dimensional glass effect of the Dock\".\nThis will likely have only a minimal benefit, but it could help a bit.\nAnd if anyone ever does figure out how to speed up that animation, it'll be the teams at Cocktail or TinkerTool, so having one of these apps means you'll probably be one of the first to know.\nETA: Fastest way of all: disable Auto-Hide. \nI keep my Dock on the right side and it takes up very little screen real estate. It's mostly the vertical pixels that are precious.\nAnd with Lion's new FullScreen feature, if I ever really need to hide it to minimize distractions, I just go FullScreen with the current app.\n\nA: via Cocktail.app\nYou can modify almost everything with this app. \n\nA: my two cents only to be complete. (in my case I DO hate not seeing bar at all, so I want it to stay ever)\nfrom docs in terminal You can use:\na) usual animation:\n   defaults write com.apple.Dock autohide -bool TRUE; killall Dock\n\nb) always Shown:\n   defaults write com.apple.Dock autohide -bool FALSE; killall Dock\n\n", "Q: Postfix SMTP server slow to accept incoming connection I have a snow-leopard os-x Server configuration running postfix with no local firewall on the X-Serve.\nWhen a client attempts to connect to the SMTP port the connection takes about 15 seconds to accept the connection and get the smtp id string back.\nDoes anybody have any idea what the delay could be.\ntelnet smtpserver 25\ntakes 15 seconds externally\ntelnet localhost 25\nis almost immediate\nUsing tcpdump on incoming firewall (separate host) and smtp server for the port shows that the connection is being passed through almost immediately but the response is very slow in coming back.\nThanks for the support.\n\nA: The Delay is due to postfix doing a reverse lookup on the client IP and doing another lookup on that result to see if they get back to the IP.\nif you are using a consumer connection to the internet most likely the first test will pass. but the second test will cause the problem.\nyou can verify this on the server itself.\nnslookup <your client IP>\n\nreturns something like 80-41-90-213.dsl.iwx.uk.net\nbut on reversing that\nnslookup 80-41-90-213.dsl.iwx.uk.net \n\nyou will probably get SERVFAIL after a delay.\nit is that delay that is showing up when you connect to the server.\nTo find out which one go through each server in /etc/resolve.conf\nnameserver x.x.x.x\nnameserver y.y.y.y\nnameserver z.z.z.z\n\ntest them with\nnslookup 80-41-90-213.dsl.iwx.uk.net x.x.x.x\n\nOne or more will show a delay before they come back to the command prompt.\nOnce you've found which DNS causes the big SERVFAIL delay, replace it with another. i.e. Googles 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 currently return relatively quickly.\n", "Q: How to save an iTunes Podcast to a USB stick?

I'm trying to find a relatively cheap Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable that also supports sending audio to an HDTV. Cables from Monoprice are out of the question, since they don't ship to Romania and I'd rather not spend $40 for a cable sold by an Apple authorized reseller.\nI've found several cables on eBay1 that say they support \"DTS/DTS-HD, Dolby Digital / Dolby TrueHD, and Linear PCM (LPCM)\". All those acronyms leave me completely clueless; they all have something to do with audio, but none of them clearly state \"yes, we have audio support\". Would such a cable allow me to output both video and audio to a mid-2010 MacBook Pro? Has anyone actually purchased such a cable and had any problems with it?\n1. I haven't linked to any of the cables I've found on eBay since I'm not here to drive traffic to their products. Also, I'm trying not to spam this site.\n\nA: The Original Apple-Adapter supports Audio for MacBook Pro and iMac Mid2010\nFrom the Apple-Website:\n\nNote: *Audio support is only available for MacBook Pro 13/15/17-in.\n  mid-2010 release; iMac 21.5/27-in. early-2010 release\n\nApple-Store Link\nI've bought a cheap one from Belkin for my MacBook Air - but there is no Audio-Output!\n\nA: I ordered a cheap Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable from eBay (less than $5, including transport) and it works perfectly, including sound.\nThe only thing needed is to configure the audio output source to TV instead of the internal speakers (you only need to do this once; after that, it will remember the setting and switch automatically once connected to the TV). To change the audio source, option click on the speaker icon on the menu bar, go to the Output tab and choose your TV.\n\nA: Some of the 2010 and later Mac laptops and iMacs have support for audio over the DisplayPort, which would work with DisplayPort to HDMI.  Otherwise, only the video comes through.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4241\nIf you don't have audio over DisplayPort, get this cable: http://www.amazon.com/Kanex-iAdapt-DisplayPort-Channel-Digital/dp/B0031QH1BG/ref=sr_1_19?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1327331080&sr=1-19\nI've used it many times with my 2009 MacBook Pro.  It uses the laptop's optical out to provide the audio, and presents the audio & video to an HDMI cable connector.\n\nA: I've had an issue where sometimes the Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter would transmit sound to the TV, and sometimes not. It was driving me crazy, but I think I finally figured it out.\nIf I loaded the webpage BEFORE I had plugged in the adapter, then the sound for the streaming video would only play on the Macbook speakers.\nAfter having been plugged in, when I refreshed the page, and \"refetched\" the content to stream, then it played audio from the TV.\nQuick fix that worked for me, so it might be worth a try.\nNote: I have a 2013 Macbook Air with Yosemite, and a Rocketfish adapter (RF-AP305).\n\nA: It seems some adapters may or may not support audio. It is important to know which computers support audio through the port. Only certain Macs can output audio through the mini display port. Those that can't will need to have auxiliary speakers connected to the 3.5mm audio jack or other solution through a separate cable system.\nMid 2010 or later MacBook Pros support audio through the port. Late 2009 or later iMacs also support it. The mid 2010 and later unibody MacBook (7,1) supports it. Interestingly, the late 2009 MacBook 6,1 does not support it despite being almost identical to the 7,1 model released less than a year later. You can find a complete compatibility list through a simple Google search.\nI bought a third party adapter on eBay for $8.50 on eBay to use with my mid 2010 MacBook 7,1. The adapter is a three-in-one with integrated VGA, DVI, and HDMI connections. However, I'm having trouble with the audio. Using the audio MIDI application, the audio does play to the TV via HDMI on the adapter but, when setting the audio source to be the HDMI device, my MacBook does not play audio. When I change the volume with the audio keys, I only get a circle with a line through it indicating it can't play audio. I have no idea why it isn't working for me but the MIDI program confirms this model is capable. I suspect it is a software issue, my TV, or the adapter.\n", "Q: How can I associate URL files with a specific browser in Snow Leopard? Until Snow Leopard URL files (.webloc files that you get when you drag a URL onto the desktop) opened with OmniWeb on my computer and some URLs were configured to open with Safari.\nAfter upgrading to Snow Leopard all URL files open with \"Finder\" which then proceeds to open the standard browser (OmniWeb) for them. I tried changing the association, but Snow Leopard insists that these files be opened with OmniWeb via Finder.\nAny ideas what I can do to fix this? I want all webloc files to open in OmniWeb except for specific ones which should open in Safari. I had it configured that way but at some point Mac OS X decided that the Safari ones should open with Finder (which then opens them with OmniWeb) and it just ignores it when I try to change that configuration per file\n\nA: As far as I know, there is no way to associate .webloc files with a specific application. Your best bet would probably be to use some AppleScript.\nI made a little script that lets you generate tiny little AppleScript applications that open in the browser that you select upon creation (OmniWeb, Safari, or Chrome).\nYou can download the script here, or compile it yourself from the code below.\nset theURL to text returned of (display dialog \"What URL would you like to bookmark?\" with title \"Enter URL\" default answer \"http://\")\nset theApp to (choose from list {\"OmniWeb\", \"Safari\", \"Chrome\"} with prompt \"Which application would you like to associate with the bookmark?\" with title \"Select Application\") as string\nset theName to text returned of (display dialog \"What would you like to name the bookmark?\" with title \"Enter Name\" default answer \"\")\nset theFolder to choose folder with prompt \"Where would you like to save the bookmark?\"\n\nif theApp is \"OmniWeb\" then\n    set theScript to \"tell application \\\"OmniWeb\\\"\n    activate\n    try\n        set theTab to make new tab at end of front browser with properties {address:\\\"\" & theURL & \"\\\"}\n        set active tab of front browser to theTab\n    on error\n        make new browser with properties {address:\\\"\" & theURL & \"\\\"}\n    end try\nend tell\"\nelse if theApp is \"Safari\" then\n    set theScript to \"tell application \\\"Safari\\\"\n    activate\n    try\n        set theTab to make new tab at end of tabs of front window\n        set the URL of theTab to \\\"\" & theURL & \"\\\"\n    on error\n        make new document\n        set theTab to tab 1 of front window\n        set the URL of theTab to \\\"\" & theURL & \"\\\"\n    end try\n    set current tab of front window to theTab\nend tell\"\nelse if theApp is \"Chrome\" then\n    set theScript to \"tell application \\\"Google Chrome\\\"\n    activate\n    if (count of windows) = 0 then\n        make new window\n        set URL of tab 0 of front window to \\\"\" & theURL & \"\\\"\n    else\n        set URL of (make new tab at end of tabs of front window) to \\\"\" & theURL & \"\\\"\n    end if\nend tell\"\nend if\n\ntell application \"AppleScript Editor\"\n    set theDoc to make new document with data theScript\n    save theDoc as \"application\" in ((theFolder as string) & theName & \".app\")\nend tell\n\nRunning that will prompt you for the URL, the browser you want it to open with, and the location to save the 'bookmark'.\nYou can put this in your Applications or Scripts folder for easy access and invoke it whenever you want to save a URL.\n\nA: You need to make an Automator Script with these elements: (and save as an App)\n\n\n*\n\n*RunShellScript -> open -a Firefox.app\n\n*Pause (2 Seconds)\n\n*RunShellScript -> open -a Firefox.app http://www.apple.com\n\nA: As of macOS 10.12 Sierra, .webloc and .url files both open in the default browser.  They can be opened in another browser using the \"Open With\" menu, but the default cannot be changed either per-file or per-extension.\nThe solution I found is to create an AppleScript application:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Script Editor application (the successor to the AppleScript app)\n\n*Paste in this code:\ntell application \"Safari\" to open location \"https://apple.stackexchange.com/\"\n(Change the URL to the one you need)\n\n*File | Save As with File Format set to \"Script\"\n\n\n*\n\n*This is a binary applescript file which will reopen in the Script Editor\n\n*It can be edited and run from within the editor, but cannot be run from finder\n\n\n*File | Export with File Format set to \"Application\"\n\n\n*\n\n*This is an application bundle which will execute\n\n*It can be run from finder, but cannot be opened in the editor\n\n\n\nThis approach works for making a \"link\" in finder that will open in Safari, but does have some problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*It's not portable (I also saved a .url file)\n\n*It's 2 (or 3) files where I'd rather have 1\n\n*Reopening the script (from step 3) in the editor also launches Safari (without opening the URL)\n\n\nIn my case - opening an old corporate Java applet that really just uses the browser as a launcher - it also leaves Safari open to a useless empty page.\nI'm sure this could also be done with a shell script, which might at least bring it down to just 1 (or 2) files.\n\nA: You may want to read this article at Macworld:\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/142937/2009/09/snowfiles.html\nBut the meat of the fix from the Workaround section is:\n\nControl-click on the file in question, then hold down the Option key, then select Always Open With, and choose the desired application from the (potentially huge) list of alternatives. You’ll have to do this every time you create a new file; there’s no way to set the creating application as the default opening application.\n\nI'm, unfortunately, on Windows at work, so I can't confirm this fix. But it sounds like it's the way to go.\n\nA: The solution you're looking for is not a simple one. One idea that came up to mind I have posted in: bind application to file of particular names(rather than suffix). I am not a professional Apple developer, nor am I familiar with the intricate details of the OS. But as a casual programmer, I think that would be possible solution.\nThe above if you want to keep on using .webloc of course. What I would do though is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the extension of those particular bookmark files that you want to open with a particular application to .url.\n\n*Associate those with the desired browser.\n\n", "Q: 10.7 FileVault & TimeMachine I would like to know if turning on FileVault affects TimeMachine Backups; if yes how?\n(E.G. Do the backups become encrypted? etc.)\n\nA: Time Machine makes a second copy of your data and operates above the Core Storage layer.\nFile Vault is simply Core Storage setting a scrambling / encryption of all data before it gets written and after it gets read from one or more physical drive(s).\nCombined, you can have FV on your real data and not on your TM data. Or the opposite. Or both or none. It all depends how you set it up as nothing changes automatically and you have to manually choose / set-up File Vault for each volume/drive where you wish to have data protected.\n\nIn the case you propose (turning on FV on source data), this won't change the encryption on/off status for an existing Time Machine destination. The only way the backup data gets encrypted is if you enable that on the drive when prompted or by intention using Disk Utility.\n", "Q: Is there a way to use Notes without using Mail.app With iCloud I've found the notes app super handy now that it easily syncs to my iPhone and iPad. It also syncs to my mac via Mail.app, but I was wondering if there's an easy way to access and edit notes that doesn't require opening my email.\nAny way to do this?\n\nA: Currently there is no way to use notes outside of Mail.app as suggested there are other apps like evernote that will sync but not iOS notes sadly. \nI would have expected some kind of widget like stickies to work with notes, but no.\n", "Q: Removing formatting on PDF added with preview I'm reading a book in Preview (Lion) and i've highlighted some parts.\nIs there any way to remove this formatting for printing or sending this book?\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to Tools > Show Inspector (or use Command+i)\n\n*In this window, click the pencil icon\n\n*Select all your highlights (Command+a works here)\n\n*Hit delete\n", "Q: How to migrate my Mac OS X application and data from MacBook Pro to Mac Mini? At my job I have just switched from Windows to a Mac.

What tool should I use?\n\nA: As @Globalnomad says using the Migration Assistant is the easiest way as per the Apple reference . However you do not need the extra disk but connect them with a firewire cable see Apple knowledge base for firewire booting\nThe steps are given in the first reference in he section \"Migrating using FireWire or ThunderBolt \"\nor if no Firewire cable - connect via Ethernet and use the section \"Wireless (Wi-Fi) or Ethernet migration\"  I suspect Wi-Fi might be a bit slow.\n\nA: Easiest way I know is\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your Macbook Pro is connected to a power outlet (you don't\nwant your Macbook Pro to go to sleep)\n\n*Find an external hard drive (that's big enough to fit all your applications\nand data) and connect it to your Macbook Pro. Highly recommend if possible that you connect that hard drive using the fastest connection possible. e.g. IEEE1391/Firewire preferred over USB, or USB 3 over USB 2, etc. Likewise, a Direct Attached Storage will be faster than a Network Attached Storage.\n\n*Launch System Preferences on your MacBook Pro, click on Time\nMachine, enable it, and set the above-mentioned hard drive as the\nTime Machine backup. Time Machine will start counting down from 100+ seconds, starts indexing. Depending on how much content (application and data) you have, this can take hours. You can continue using the MacBook Pro while Time Machine backs up. \n\n*When Time Machine has completed backing up, if you have saved any\nfiles while Time Machine was running, then run Time Machine one more\ntime to ensure you got that latest backup.\n\n*Eject the external hard drive and disconnect it from your Macbook\nPro.\n\n*Connect the external hard drive to your Mac Mini.\n\n*Power on your Mac Mini.

I am setting up a video editing / encoding workstation based on a mac mini and a freenas box for mass storage. We plan to use iSCSI to share the disk with the mac and had planned on using GlobalSAN's iSCSI initiator as it had worked in testing and was free. Unfortunately, version 5 isn't free so we are back to the drawing board. Or at least now that we have to pay we'd like to make sure we buy the right one.\nAnyhow, we've identified a two options:\na) GlobalSAN v5.0\nb) Xtend SAN iSCSI Initiator  \nIn addition, I wonder of some open source iSCSI initiators might work since it is BSD under the hood. But I couldn't find a clear answer.\nSo, for what is essentially a single-user SAN, what iSCSI initiator would use on OSX 10.7?\n\nA: Sorry but \"global san Initiator\" is both buggy and a slow.\nThe read/write figures are low, not to mention when you try to combine multiple LAN links together it is highly unreliable.\nThe ATTO version is far better, but I just wish Apple would provide a version in the kernel.\n", "Q: How can I add an email signature in my iPhone Gmail app? I understand it is fairly easy to add a signature to the standard iPhone mail app. However, I am now using the Gmail app on my iPhone 4S, and I can't seem to figure out how to append a signature to mail sent only through the phone.

I saw one of my friends using a regular A4Tech OP-620D USB mouse with a MacBook Pro 2010 and Mac OS 10.6.7.  I tried to use a local brand USB mouse on my machine but it didn't work. It showed properties in preferences but the mouse was not functioning.  Therefore can I use a branded USB mouse on OS X Lion? Also can it be a bluetooth or 2.4G wireless mouse?\n\nA: I have used everything from wired Bluetooth (incl. Razer Naga and a bluetooth Logitech) on all my Macs. All of the buttons on the Naga work via a control panel interface, and I have had no problem. Nevertheless, the \"mouse feel\" still isn't up to the standards of the native Mac mouses.

(e.g. i'm surfing in Starbucks)\nThe default state would be vpn activated but it includes an \"opt-out\" for my home wifi.\n\nA: Perhaps something like ControlPlane would do the job for you?\n\nA: Here is another option:\nI created a script and launch agent to accomplish this. The agent calls a shell script every 30 seconds and tries to ping an IP address that is static on the vpn network. If it cannot ping that IP it enables your vpn connection. If you are home, the script will be able to ping that address and will not connect to the vpn.\nClone the project below and follow the directions in the readme. The end result is an installer package that will place a launch agent plist file in /Library/LaunchAgents/ and a shell script in /Library/Application Support/melonsmasher/. \nBe sure to edit the shell script(auto-vpn) with your VPN connection name and an IP address that is on the VPN network.

I want to have configurable recurring tasks and notifications for those tasks.\nEg, I need to trim the hedge once a week, but it doesn't matter whenabouts in the week that I do it. So I want a task that recurs once a week, but I also want to set the notifications to remind me twice every day until I mark it as done, the task then being dormant until the following Monday when the reminders will continue twice every day until I have clipped the hedge that week.\nI notice that NotifyMe for iPhone does more or less this: does it, specifically, allow me to customize when I am reminded?\n\nA: Remember the milk is a popular one. They can do weekly reminders (set for last day of week) and after a week (due 7 days after you complete it).\n\nA: Due provides most of what I'm looking for. \nThe developer explains in his FAQ that Apple places restrictions on the number of notifications allowed and when they can repeat. However, the app includes the ability to repeat reminders as well as to \"snooze\" and/or \"postpone\" them when they sound.\n\nA: Have a look at Recurring Tasks\n\nDo you have trouble keeping track of all the things you have to do? \n  Do you wish someone reminded you when it's time to change the sheets, make a dentist appointment or renew your subscriptions? \nIf so, this Recurring Tasks (RT) app might be just the thing for you!

However Preview on Mac OS X 10.7 does a too hard compression for my taste. There is only one compression setting.\nAre there alternative tools that allows you to adjust the compression ratio?\n\nA: Ahhh!  Turns out that you can fine tune the quartz filter that Preview uses.  This might be a faster way to compress:\nThis is from a review of PDFCompress on Macupdate.com:\nWith Quartz Filters, you can take total control of the compression process. In Leopard (perhaps Tiger or earlier, I'm don't recall), in your Utilities folder you'll find \"ColorSync Utility\". With this program, you can create you own quartz filters which allow to you compress PDFs as much as you see fit. When you start ColorSync Utility, you'll see how Apple programmed their \"Reduce File Size\" quartz filter that you see in Preview. It's remarkably easy to make your own filter by modeling it off Apple's filter. Head on over to for a quick tutorial. Also, some nice guy on Apple's Discussion boards put up a bunch of premade filters you can download that do the same thing. A follow-up poster even posted AppleScript code and Automator recommendations to make compressing PDFs a snap! Check out for more on that. Happy PDF-Shrinking! \n\nA: As Guy mentioned, ColorSync Utility is what your looking for. For me the standard compression was also too little resolution & too lossy compression. So I created a new filter in ColorSync - which then becomes available in e.g. Preview: Resolution 200 dpi, jpeg quality ~75%  \nStep 1: Open ColorSync Utility & create the new filter such as below\n\nThe above settings give me files with acceptable size and decent quality (e.g. for sending by e-mail)\nStep 2: Open the PDF in Preview, then choose File > Export, Click the Quartz Filter pop-up menu, then choose the relevant filter (\"Reduce File Size 200dpi\" in this case)\n\n\nEdit 2011-12-18: Seems for Lion it's not that straight forward regarding Preview integration. See here:\n\nJust copy your filter from /Users/YourName/Library/Filters/ to /Library/PDF Services/ and the customized profile will be back in preview.\n\n\nA: This is for anyone who is in the same boat as I was. I had a PDF of handwritten annotations on a book exported from Goodnotes. The Quartz Filter method didn't work for me, even when I applied a custom filter with aggressive settings. This makes me think that the filter is only applied to images in the PDF. In my case, the most aggressive filter reduced a PDF of size 104 MB to 103 MB!\nUsing Automator to Reduce PDF Size\nNote: This method works by converting pages in your PDF to compressed JPEGs and then stitching them back into a PDF, so other PDF data such as bookmarks and notes will be stripped.\n\n*\n\n*Open Automator.\n\n*Go to File > New and Choose Workflow.\n\n*Create the Workflow as follows.\n\n*\n\n*In the left pane, look for Ask for Finder Items and drag it to the right pane.\n\n*Next, add Render PDF Pages as Images and set the Compression and Resolution of the JPEGs.\n\n*Finally, add New PDF from Images.\n\n\n\n*Click on Run (top-right), choose your PDF and wait for Automator to do its job.\n\nIn my case, this reduced the file size to 10 MB.\nHere's a screenshot of my Workflow:\n\nI learned a lot from this Apple discussions post.\n\nA: I have used PDFCompress for years. It offers multiple options and hs been continuously updated. Highly recommended, but now $30. There may be cheaper options, but this has worked well for me.\nhttp://www.metaobject.com/Products/\n\nA: To compress a PDF using some settings, you can use PDF Toolkit+. It used to be $2, but it's currently free. It does not allow adjustable ratio, but has specific settings of 150 or 72 dpi.\n\nA: To compress a PDF using some settings, you can use PDFOptim - http://rootrisetech.com/product/pdfoptim\n", "Q: What adapters are available for a connecting a secondary SSD to the Superdrive's SATA cable? I have a 2011 iMac. I plan to replace the SuperDrive with an SSD drive. I've noticed on various images of, e.g., on ifixit, that the SATA cable that plugs into the Superdrive looks different to the female SATA connector on the SSD drive I have ordered (and Intel 510).\nDoes anyone know what (if any) adapters I will need to plug the SSD drive into the Superdrive's SATA/power connectors.\nFor clarity - I'm completely removing the Superdrive from the machine; I don't plan on sharing anything between the SSD/Superdrive. The SSD will have the sole use of whatever cable is is currently plugging into the Superdrive.\n\nA: Should be similar to the one I got for my MacBookPro, actually here is one especially for iMacs:\nOWC Data Doubler \nI got another one from ebay for ~20 $ - does not fit perfectly, but is good enough for me. Up to you which way you go.  \nMacBookPro installation was not too difficult, don't know about difficulty for iMacs.\n\nA: The Superdrive uses a slimline 13 pin SATA connection. The cable left after the removal of the Superdrive is female.\nTherefore, in order to fit a 2.5\" SSD drive to the SATA Superdrive cable you need to acquire a 13 pin slimline SATA male to 22 pin SATA female adapter, which can be acquired on eBay and various other places.\nHope this helps others in the future.\n", "Q: Avoid 'via gmail' for messages sent from my iPhone I've set up my own domain (say owndomain.com) to forward all his e-mail to my personal Gmail account. It works great and once setup, I can send e-mails from the iPhone using that account with the coma trick, but it will also show \"via gmail\" after the address.\nAny idea on how to avoid that?\n\nA: Assume your email address is \"you@gmail.com\" and your other email address is \"you@owndomain.com.\"\nWhen you setup an email account on your iPhone, you tell it which account you want to to use to log in and send/receive email.\nYou can change the \"From:\" line to be anything you want (using the \"comma trick\" on iOS or other settings in other mail clients), but Google does not want you to be able to \"spoof\" your email address without making it clear which account it came from. The reasons for this should be obvious.\nWhen you send email, you connect to a SMTP server and give your username and password. if that username is \"you@gmail.com\" and the \"From:\" line is \"you@owndomain.com\" then Gmail will automatically add the \"Sender:\" header which contains your actual Gmail address. (Outlook displays this as \"via\" I believe.)\nThe only way to avoid that is to have the username that you log in with be \"you@owndomain.com\" rather than \"you@gmail.com\".\nThe easiest way to do that is to use Google Apps for your domain which is free for up to 10 users.\nYou can still set that up as a \"Gmail\" account in iOS, but when you send email it will not have the Sender: header added because you are sending from the same account that you use to log in.\nThe only drawback is that you will have two accounts now in the iOS Mail app, which is (I assume) what you wanted to avoid by using the comma trick in the first place. You'll have to decide which is more important: having one email account in iOS (and having \"via\"/Sender: header added), or not having Sender: added and having more than one email account.)\n\nA: You would have to set up an alternate sender address via mail.google.com and provide the smtp server of your domain.\nSet the alternate address as your default address.\nThen on your iPhone open the google sync settings page, log in, and check the option to send via alternate sender address.\n", "Q: Where are Photo Booth image files stored in Lion? On Snow Leopard, photos taken with Photo Booth were stored in ~/Pictures/Photo Booth. They were individual image files that could be opened with any image editor. After updating to Lion, when I go to ~/Pictures, I see an icon for Photo Booth Library. When I double-click to open, it just opens Photo Booth with the thumbnail strip along the bottom. \nWhere are those image files stored now? The whole point of them is to be able to use them for avatars, etc. which I can't do if I can't get at the individual files.\n\nA: in lion the folder 'Photo Booth Library' has some extended file attributes that will make you open photo booth rather than simply the folder. to access your files in the finder, eg. for using them in avatars or email attachments you need the terminal (Finder -> Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal) and have to go in the terminal to your Pictures folder by typing\ncd Pictures/\nnow, you can either\n\n\n*\n\n*remove those extended file attributes (you'll need the developer tools for this) by typing\n\n\nxattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo Photo\\ Booth\\ Library/\nthis removes the nice icon of the folder (side-effect, sorry) and changes the behavior of finder so that it just opens that folder rather than opening the photo booth app.\n\n\n*\n\n*or make a symbolic link to the place where your pictures are stored in the library. In your Pictures folder do\n\n\nln -s Photo\\ Booth\\ Library/Pictures PhotoBoothPics\nthe link PhotoBoothPics will be accessible in your finder as you would expect from a standard directory.\nFor beginners, I recommend the second version. But maybe some expert can figure out which bit to unset in the finder info (rather than deleting the whole object).\n\nA: Just right-click on \"Photo Booth Library\" and select \"Show Package Contents\" your pictures should be in the \"Pictures\" folder.\n\nA: They're stored in ~/Pictures/Photo Booth Library on Lion. This is a package though and you can't just double-click in to the package to see the sub-folders. Double clicking on it will, instead, open Photo Booth.\nIf you just want to get at the pictures, right-click (or control-click) on the Photo Booth Library package under ~/Pictures and select Show Package Contents from the menu.\nUnder the package directory you'll see a sub-directory called Pictures -- that's where Photo Booth is keeping your snaps. Change in to there to access the images directly.  Movies are also stored in there (regardless of whether they had any effects applied) as *.mov files.\nFrom within Photo Booth you can also right-click (or control-click) on any image in the bottom bar and select 'Export...' or 'Reveal in Finder' from the pop-up menu to access the image. The former gives you a Save dialog that lets you place the image file in some easily accessible location. The latter opens up that Pictures directory in the package I mentioned above directly in a Finder window.\n\nA: Just copy all your pictures from the Photo Booth Library package to a different location, then delete the Photo Booth Library package from the Pictures directory\nWhen you re-open the Photo Booth app and it will ask you if you want to create a new Photo Booth Library package for your pictures and where you want to create it.\n\nA: If you want to open or access  photos taken by Photo Booth, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Photo Booth by using Spotlight search\n\n*Click on the \"View\" tab and select \"Show photos\"\n\n*To use the photo further, you can upload it to the \"Photos\" album by clicking on \"Add to Photos\" in the Share option.\n\n*Open \"Photos\", select the photo and click on the File tab then export it to your desired location (Desktop, Downloads folder etc.) to use it.\n\n\nA: If you want to open or access photos taken by Photo Booth, follow this simple rules mentioned below:\nOpen Photo Booth by using spotlight search\nclick on the \"View\" tab and select \"Show photos\"\nTo use the photo further,You can upload it to the \"Photos\" album by clicking on \"Add to Photos\" in share option\nOpen \"Photos\"...Select the photo...

Now on 10.12 launchctl limit maxfiles is also in the mix. For details on implementation, this great answer is getting bounty and deserves more votes than the one I can give it.\nother relevant threads are:\n\n\n*\n\n*`ulimit -n` for non-root\n\n*Why won't kern.maxfiles setting in /etc/sysctl.conf stick?\nThe ulimit level is set low to prevent one poor shell script from flooding the kernel with open files.\nThe kern.maxfilesperproc is there to leave a little room in the max files count so that one process can use most but not all of the open file handler space from the kernel.\nFor normal situations, the kern.maxfiles is the final limiting factor.\nOn Sierra - the limits are 256 open files and unlimited max, so I'm finding that having 3 to 4 thousand files set for the soft limit works for just about all our hardware and still keeps the system responsive when a runaway process opens too many files. We do like to keep our development servers at the 256 limit so that we catch leaky and problematic software in development / staging and test rather than finding out about it in production.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://krypted.com/mac-os-x/maximum-files-in-mac-os-x/\nI'm not a fan of 10k files - maybe with APFS and NVMe storage we will see the day when that's not unthinkable, but try to stick with hundreds or low thousands for your file limits. Especially if your mac has a low process limit, having so many files opened by so few processes can be problematic.\n\nA: The following should resolve most common problems (and are listed in order of their hierarchy):\necho 'kern.maxfiles=20480' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\necho -e 'limit maxfiles 8192 20480\\nlimit maxproc 1000 2000' | sudo tee -a /etc/launchd.conf\necho 'ulimit -n 4096' | sudo tee -a /etc/profile\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*You will need to restart for these changes to take effect.\n\n*AFAIK you can no longer set limits to 'unlimited' under OS X\n\n*launchctl maxfiles are bounded by sysctl maxfiles, and\ntherefore cannot exceed them\n\n*sysctl seems to inherit kern.maxfilesperproc from launchctl\nmaxfiles\n\n*ulimit seems to inherit it's 'open files' value from\nlaunchctl by default\n\n*you can set a custom ulimit within /etc/profile, or\n~/.profile ; while this isn't required I've provided an example\n\n*Be cautious when setting any of these values to a very high number when compared with their default - the features exist stability/security.  I've taken these example numbers that I believe to be reasonable, written on other websites. \n\n\nA: It seems like there is an entirely different method for changing the open files limit for each version of OS X.\nFor OS X Sierra (10.12.X) you need to:\n1.\nIn Library/LaunchDaemons create a file named limit.maxfiles.plist and paste the following in (feel free to change the two numbers (which are the soft and hard limits, respectively):\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>  \n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\"  \n        \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">  \n  <dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>limit.maxfiles</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n      <string>launchctl</string>\n      <string>limit</string>\n      <string>maxfiles</string>\n      <string>64000</string>\n      <string>524288</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>ServiceIPC</key>\n    <false/>\n  </dict>\n</plist> \n\n2.\nChange the owner of your new file:\nsudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist\n\n3. \nLoad these new settings:\nsudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist\n\n4.\nFinally, check that the limits are correct:\nlaunchctl limit maxfiles\n\n\nA: In simple words:\n\n\n*\n\n*The ulimit command provides \"control over the resources available to the shell and processes it creates\" (see: help ulimit and man bash). Resources given to shell are limited by the system resource limits.\n\n*The launchctl controls maximum system resource consumption by the current process (see: man setrlimit and man launchctl). Maximum values are limited by the kernel limits.\n\n*The sysctl controls kernel limits (see: man sysctl and BSD's Tuning Kernel Limits).\nTo increase the limits, you can use each of the commands, depending on the problem.\nSee also: What is the relationship between `launchctl limit` and `ulimit`?\n\nFor the problem with too many open files, this depends on which exactly soft or hard limit has been reached (whether it's a local shell script, the global script run by root, an app, or all processes at the same time). It's worth to increase all the limits (shell, launchd and kernel limits).\nTo increase the limits persistently, see: How to persistently control maximum system resource consumption on Mac?\n", "Q: OS X Lion: 8GB of RAM, 20MB free I have a Macbook Pro (early 2011) running OS X Lion and while running a few apps that only take up, say, 200 MBs of space each (Xcode, Spotify, and Photoshop), my wired memory shoots up to 1.4GB, my active to 4.39GB, inactive to 2.18GB, and free 28.3MB. Note: this happens with different apps at times, not just a combination of these three.\nThe issue is so bad that programs lag so badly that there are seconds of delays when, for example, clicking on a label to edit text. Even the Spotify music starts to stutter, but the CPU usage isn't very high (less than 10% used).\nIs this common? Besides restarting, is there something I can do to fix this? Perhaps it's something not relating to memory?\n\nA: Apple documentation on memory says that\n\nThe inactive list contains pages that are currently resident in physical memory but have not been accessed recently. These pages contain valid data but may be released from memory at any time.\n\ninactive + free can be considered as the free memory\n\nA: Free memory is wasted memory. \nOS X and other modern operating systems like Windows Vista and Windows 7 fill empty memory with stuff that you might use... so if you do use it, you don't have to wait for it to be pulled from disk.\nThe fact you have 2.18 GB of \"inactive\" RAM means your operating system has kept 2 GB of stuff in there that you might use again but would also drop at a moment's notice to replace with something else (your Active and/or Wired RAM would grow to consume the Inactive.) This replacement takes zero (or at least very close to zero) extra time compared to leaving the RAM sitting there with nothing in it.\n", "Q: The Finder can’t complete the operation because some data can’t be read or written.

Click on the folder, press Command+i, in the \"Sharing & Permissions:\" section (on the bottom) and check if it shows your new user-account on the MBP as owner (first icon) and if the privileges are \"Read & Write\".\nProbably it will show a different user as owner. You could then try to fix the permissions by running Disk Utility, selecting you OS X partition on the left and click \"Repair Disk Permissions\" - but maybe this won't fix it, then you have to do it using the Terminal.\nMaybe someone else can elaborate on that.\nEdit 2011-12-18: Ok, I'll try myself:  \nSomething I didn't know yet but found now looking for an easy fix:  \nFrom Troubleshooting permissions issues in Mac OS X \nNote: In Mac OS X 10.5 and later, while started up (\"booted\") from the Mac OS X 10.5 installation disc, a user's home directory permissions can be reset using the Reset Password utility.\n\n\n*\n\n*But in Lion they removed the option form the menu, so if you boot (holding \"alt ⌥\") into Recovery HD\n\n\n*\n\n*Wait for “Mac OS X Utilities” menu to appear, indicating that you are booted into recovery mode\n\n*Click on the “Utilities” menu and select \"Terminal\"\n\n*Type the following: resetpassword\n\n*Confirm the user account and then the password change and reboot Mac OS X 10.7 as usual with your new password  \n\n\n\nCopied from Reset a Mac OS X 10.7 Lion Password\nI didn't try it myself, but hopefully this should reset/repair your home directory permissions.\n\nMaybe even better solution using Finder in normal OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Finder select the folder\n\n*Press Command+i\n\n*Expand \"Sharing & Permissions\" section (Unlock if necessary 1)\n\n*If you're not in the list of owners, press [+] 2\n\n*In the upcoming list, select your new user\n\n*Finally click the gear 3, make your new user the owner, apply to enclosed items\n \n\n\n*\n\n*and delete the old user by selecting his name from the list and clicking [-]\n\n\n\n\n\nEasiest way, if you're not afraid of the terminal:\nAssuming your new user is named harmen  \nsudo chown -R harmen /Users/harmen  \n\nThis will make you the owner of everything inside /Users/harmen\nRead more here \nGood luck. \n\nA: I've just had the same problem after using Migration Assistant. In my case, I went through the initial setup process on my new computer first, choosing to defer the data migration part of it til some time later - this is the problem. Going through new computer setup without data migration (choosing to do that later) creates an extra user, then when you later do the data migration it messes everything up with the locked folders etc. Big headache. I've learnt the hard way.

So that I could resize the window to a certain size from within Terminal.\n\nA: Yes. Terminal supports escape sequences for manipulating windows, including the size and position, layering, and minimizing. Dimensions can be expressed in pixels or characters. See Xterm Control Sequences for details (search for “Window manipulation”; if you’re not familiar with the notation, “CSI” stands for “Control Sequence Introducer”, which is ESC [).\nFor example, this shell command will set the window to 100x50 characters:\nprintf '\\e[8;50;100t'\n\nMinimize the window for a few seconds, then restore it:\nprintf '\\e[2t' && sleep 3 && printf '\\e[1t'\n\nMove the window to the top/left corner of the display:\nprintf '\\e[3;0;0t'\n\nZoom the window:\nprintf '\\e[9;1t'\n\nBring the window to the front (without changing keyboard focus):\nprintf '\\e[5t'\n\nEnabling the Control Sequences in Terminal Emulators\nSome terminal emulators ignore these control sequences by default and require configuration to enable them.\nTo enable these in XTerm, set the following resource to true:\n\nallowWindowOps\n\nTo enable these in iTerm2, deselect the following preference:\n\nPreferences > Profiles > [profile] > Terminal > Disable session-initiated window resizing\n\n\nA: My apologies for necro-reviving an old question, but I thought this answer might be useful for others.\nFrom tedsmith3rd, here's a bash function to move a Terminal window.

If I recall, very similar errors start occurring regularly above 80% capacity, meaning you haven't freed up nearly enough yet.\nThere are several system activities that potentially eat a significant amount of space, like creating a new swap file. To protect such activities, Apple deactivates some space consuming activities, including indexing, once the drive is 80% full. \nThere might be system tuning parameters which you could tweak that control this.  In fact, those errors get seen vastly more often than mdutil's errors, meaning you might learn more by opening console, identify the related errors, and google them.\nI've learned to consider all those annoying log messages a \"feature\" myself though since leaving 50ish gigs free for temporary emergency usage has more \"utility\" than filling that space with infrequently used junk. \n", "Q: How can I enable search by filename in finder on Lion Before switching to Lion (on Snow leopard) I used to open a directory (like my Downloads) and start searching using the search box at the top right of the finder window for a file and there was an option to restrict the search to \"filenames\" only.\nThe \"filename\" option does not show up by default for me, is there a way to bring it back?\n\nA: You can add tokens like this by typing name: before the search phrase or selecting Filename contains from the suggestion list:\n\n", "Q: How do I sync games save data across different computers? Is there a way to continue saved games (e.g., Cave Story) across multiple machines? I.e., I play Cave Story on my iMac, but would occasionally like to pick up a saved game from my MacBook too. It would be awesome if I could use dropbox to do this.\n\nA: There are really two answers to this question, and they depend upon how the game is made.\n\n\n*\n\n*If your game is using Steam's Cloud service, your save games will be automatically copied across your machines. Here's a PC-centric probably incomplete list of games that use Steam Cloud. Not very useful, but the best I could find.\n\n*Most non-Steam games will create a file somewhere on your Mac which contains your save data. This save file could be in the game directory, it could be in your Library folder, it could be elsewhere. That's going to change depending on the game, and is up to you to find out. We can sync this file via Dropbox.\n\n\n*\n\n*Now, if the game lets you choose where to place your save file, you could save it in your Dropbox folder, and let that sync it across devices. Just make sure it's fully synced on every device before loading it.\n\n*If the game doesn't let you choose where to save, we're going to have to do it manually. We need to create a symlink, which is kind of like having the same file exist in two places in your filesystem at once. Time Machine makes extensive use of it. Lifehacker have a post detailing using symlinks to sync files and folders for Dropbox. Now, I haven't tested it, and you should be very careful with this. What you want to do is to open up Terminal and do something like this:\nln -s /Users/PutYourNameHere/Library/Preferences/com.nakiwo.doukutsu.plist ~/Dropbox/MySaveGames/CaveStory/com.nakiwo.doukutsu.plist\nYou're going to need to replicate that on both computers. Now, be very careful with this method, and make sure you back up any files you try this with. I'd be very, very careful about doing it with whole folders, especially important ones like the Preferences folder. But in theory, it should work.

And my company is using Microsoft Exchange server for schedules. When I added the company account to iCal, it set the calendar color as orange. I have been using blue for my working schedule. So it's confusing me so much!\nUsually, other accounts support changing the color by clicking Get Info menu. But this Exchange account doesn't show any configurable options. How can I change the color?\n\nA: I'm running Snow Leopard and my iCal Get Info command allows me to change colors.  Here's a screen capture where I can make this change.\n\nTo reach this window, I highlight the exchange \"Calendar\" in the left hand sidebar of iCal and enter Cmd I.\nIn my iCal setup, I have \"Home\" (orange) \"Gmail\" (blue)and \"Exchange\" (red).  I can get info and change the color for any of the three calendars.  In my list, I have \"Home\", \"Gmail\" and \"Exchange\". Here is how 2 appts look:\n\nWhat do you see when you get info on your exchange account?\n\nA: I think this issue is specific to Lion. You can't even get to the info screen for an Exchange calendar, to make the colour choice shown in the screen shots here. Googling,  I turned up the following Applescript to accomplish the task:\ntell application \"iCal\"\n  set color of calendar \"Calendar\" to choose color default color {0, 0, 0}\nend tell\n\n\nA: After the recent Lion update, the color issue is resolved by right clicking on the desired exchange calendar, and selecting Get Info. A color combo box is now available. Prior to the update, only iCloud or local Calendars would allow color change in Lion. \n", "Q: What is a PPP server, and why do I keep getting disconnected from it? I am using a Huawei e160 USB modem and I regularly lose connection to the internet with the following error: You have been disconnected from the PPP server.\nIt has nothing to do with reception, and I am always able to connect immediately back up. Does anyone have any ideas as to why this may be happening? Or at least explain to me what a PPP server is? Thanks.\n\nA: PPP is the Point to Point Protocol is a data link layer (see the OSI 7-layer model). It's an older protocol that's generally used to connect two points together over a physical link like a phone line. It's been in use as a connection protocol (mostly in the PPPoE -- PPP over Ethernet -- form) for ISPs for quite some time now. Your modem uses this protocol to identify you as a customer to your ISP and create a tunnel to them over some larger network, through which your data will flow. Your modem establishes a PPP connection and then over this connection your Ethernet packets flow.\nIt sounds like you're disconnecting from your ISP at regular intervals. It could be any number of things causing you to lose your connection. You may have poor signal to the ISP end point and the connection is timing out. You may be overloading the connection and your ISP is dropping the link. Your ISP may be having issues. You may have failing or buggy hardware. Or you may have buggy drivers for your hardware.\nIt's impossible to tell exactly from what you've written.\nIf you can check your Console logs, see if there are related console messages about the PPP tunnel, you might be able to find something additionally useful to add to your question.\nHave you called your ISP? That's where I'd start.\n\nA: @Ian C. has provided an excellent answer to this question, but I can add a few thoughts. A few years back I was given a Huawei e160 USB from Vodafone mobile broadband here in the UK. The modem establishes a PPP connection over a 3G network, and since that network is shared with cell phones, Vodafone was aggressive about disconnecting idle devices after a very short time. They could always attribute these \"dropped calls\" to spotty network coverage.\n@joshnh and @Martha may also be experiencing disconnections when their modems are idle for a short period of time. Or they may genuinely have spotty network coverage (sometimes signal strength drops for a few moments due to interference, then quickly recovers). In my experience when there was robust cellular coverage the PPP connection was good, and when the coverage was thin (in the countryside) or at peak times the connection became flakey.\nHave either of you noticed that this problem happens more at certain times of day? That would point to your ISP shedding load.\nRegardless, the solution is the same that @Ian C. suggested, namely to call your ISP.\n\nA: Having the same problem as Joshnh. I have contacted my ISP though I noticed you need to check settings in System preferences-Network-select your modem-pick advanced settings then change settings. I have done so anyway, it is solved a bit but goes back to the same issue.\n\nA: If your connction to your ISP is via a wireless  network, some packets don't go though. Athough it doesn't have any affect on e-mail, Google, or YouTube, it wreaks havoc on encryption protocols (SSL, TLS) and tunneling protocols (PPP, SSTP, IPSec). That may be the problem.\n", "Q: UK MBA keyboard layout vs Apple external keyboard layouts This question is not about remapping keyboard layouts and different languages. This is about the actual differences in the physical location of keys.\nMy June 2011 UK Macbook Air has the same keyboard layout I'm used to from previous Macbooks - a double height return key and the backtick/tilde key inbetween left-shift and Z.\nI recently got to Australia and bought an external keyboard in the Apple store, not realising the physical layout would be different. The keyboard looks like this:\nhttp://store.apple.com/uk/product/MB110Z/B\nI want to get an external keyboard which matches my Macbook Air - which I guess would be the external wireless keyboard.

Is is possible for me to get an external keyboard with the same layout as my MBA?\nThanks y'all\n\nA: Regarding the extra key to the left of the z, you should get that with any \"ISO\" keyboard sold in Europe.  In the US, keyboards are \"ANSI\" and are missing that key.  Other countries may vary.  See this note:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT2841\n\nA: The pictures in the Apple Store are just wrong.

I have an iPhone 4 running iOS 5.\nIn the last month or so, it has developed an annoying habit. When a new mail arrives it makes a \"boing\" sound and a vibrate.\nIt does this, even though the New Mail sound setting in Settings is switched to None. It does this, even when all sounds are switched off, via the mute button!\nIt is very annoying! Does anyone else see this bug, and does anyone have a suggestion (short of a clean install) to fix it?\n\nA: None of the proposed solutions in this thread have worked for me. My setup is a mail account connected to a corporate Exchange server, plus Gmail synced to the phone via the Exchange protocol, with emails unselected in that profile. In addition, I have the Gmail app installed.\nI use this setup because it lets me easily separate work email from personal email.\nI have found that there are three places to possibly disable New Mail sounds in this setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings -> Sounds -> New Mail\n\n*Settings -> Notifications -> Mail\n\n*Settings -> Notifications -> Gmail\n\n\nEven after setting all three to play no sounds, I am getting the default \"Ding\" sound whenever email arrives from my corporate Exchange server. When emails come in from Gmail, they honor the Gmail notification setting.\nMy first attempt at a solution was to uninstall the Gmail app completely. Even after doing this, I still got the annoying Ding sound every time an email came in.\nNext, I completely removed the Gmail account from the phone. So no Gmail app and no Gmail connection in Settings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendars. Still no solution: Every time I got an email from my corporate Exchange server, my phone made the Ding noise.\nNext, I decided to do a cold reset by holding down the power and home buttons. After doing this, the sound finally went away!\nI added my Gmail account back to the phone (still no Gmail app), and did not select the Mail sync option. The sound was still gone!\nFinally I re-installed the Gmail app. Settings -> Notifications -> Gmail -> Sounds On. Email from corporate Exchange is still silent! Email from Gmail is making sounds just as I have configured it.\nSo it's hard to say exactly what fixed it. Maybe it was the cold reset. Maybe it was the uninstall/reinstall. Maybe it was the combination of everything. But the important part is that this process worked for me, and I hope it works for someone else as well.\n\nA: Here is how I stopped email notifications on iPhone 5.\nI turned off notifications in:\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings -> Sounds -> New Mail -> Alert Tones -> None.\n\n*Settings -> Notifications -> Mail -> iCloud -> New Mail Sound -> None.\n\n\nThis alone did not work, so I also turned off the iPhone and subsequently turned it back on, and it worked.\nI don't have Gmail, so I didn't address that.\n\nA: I had this problem. It was caused by the Gmail app. If you have it installed, go to your phones Settings and find the Gmail app in the list. Turn off Sounds and that should fix your problem.\n\nA: I had the same problem. It turns out it has to do with jailbreak and lockinfo. In lockinfo, go Plugins -> \nail -> (New Mail Alert) Repeat Duration, and set it to \"None\".\n\nA: I went to Settings.app, then to Gmail, and it directed me to go to \"Notifications\", which I did.

I have found unlocked iPhones 4 from USA and malaysia to be so much more cheaper than Australia, are there any compatibility problems associated with this? \nI heard if you buy an iPhone in US or other countries and take it back to Australia, itunes will only accept credit cards from the country of manufacture when purchasing apps i.e.  if bought in US, must use US credit card. Is this true?\n\nA: As long as the iPhone is unlocked and to connected to any network, you can use it in any country. \nYou will need to check that if you are buying in the USA and you are getting an iPhone 4 you will need to buy a GSM phone as all Australian networks use GSM after Telstra shut off CDMA, if you are buying an iPhone 4S you need't worry as these combine both networks for maximum coverage.\nYou may find it useful that some iPhones in some countries are always sold unlocked such as France and Belgium where it is against the law to sell subsidies handsets on contracts.\n\nA: No. If you buy an unlocked iPhone, you can use it in any country with any creditcard. The one thing you have to know is the difference between a CDMA and a GSM iPhone (only if you buy an iPhone from the US ofcourse). Make sure the device supports your network.\n\nA: I bought an iphone 4s outside the US and when I tried to link it to my account from the US it would not let me, So yes you are correct about that\n", "Q: iPhone iOS 5 showing incorrect time zone Recently (and only while at work) my phone has started to claim that its 8 hours ahead of the correct local time (e.g. it is currently  a little after 1230 and the iPhone is showing a little after 2030). \nIf I disable automatic time setting (Settings > General > Date and Time > Set Automatically) and manually confirm my location, all is well and the iPhone shows 1230. (Location services are switched on.)  \n\nOf course, this isn't sustainable because I'd like my phone's time to be kept in sync. \nFrom researching a little it seems as though this is a carrier related problem, can anyone confirm that? \nUpdate: After discussing the issue with my carrier's helpdesk they confirmed a problem with one of their cells which they subsequently fixed and which caused my timing issue to go away. \nMoral of the story: it's not always something that you can fix by yourself! \n\nA: You should see the Location you are in under the set automaticly button. As below. It is greyed out, as this is taken from your current location, so you must have location service enabled.\n\n\nA: I just had this problem and resolved it.  My iPhone thought it was in New York when it was in Abu Dhabi.\nGo to Settings > Location Services > System Services\nSystem Services is the last item on the Location Services page.  Scroll all the way down and tap it.\nInside System Services, there will be options for: Cell Network Search, Compass Calibration, Diagnostics & Usage, Location-Based iAds, Setting Time Zone, and Traffic.\nOn my iPhone, Setting Time Zone was switched off.

What would I need to buy in order to be able to use my LED HDTV with it, and which wireless keyboard works the best with it?\n\nA: For connecting to the TV you would need this dongle or this dongle (with cable length). \nAs far as wireless keyboards go, why not Apple's own one?  \n\nA: Macs made prior to 2010 only support video-out over the mini-Displayport, so it's a bit more complicated than just using a mDP to HDMI adapter, but it's doable. (You can see a complete list of which Macs support audio over mDP on Apple's support site).\nYou'll still need a mini-Displayport to HDMI adapter and an HDMI cable (or a direct mDP-HDMI cable if you can find one). In addition, you'll need to take the sound from your MBP's audio jack and route it to the TV. This is where it gets a bit complicated, as different TVs have different methods of doing this.\nMost recent TVs have an input labelled something like \"HDMI/DVI\", with a corresponding audio input (something like \"DVI audio in\" or \"PC audio in\"). The audio should either be a 3.5mm minijack (like the output from your MBP), or a pair of red and white RCA jacks.\nIf it's a 3.5mm jack, you'll need a cable like this, if it's a pair of RCA jacks, you'll need a cable like this one, or a 3.5mm to RCA adapter and cable.\nOnce both the HDMI and audio connections are set up, switch to the appropriate input on your TV and check things out. If you don't hear any sound, you may need to check your TV's settings - some require you to manually change from sound over HDMI to sound via the extra input.\nIn any case, you'd be well served by checking your TV's manual for the specifics, as the ports and settings can vary from TV to TV. If you don't have it around, look on the back for the model number and Google it - almost all manufacturers have PDFs on their website.\n", "Q: How can I open the .dmg install window on top of everything? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhen opening a DMG file, how do I get it to open up in front of the windows? \n\nWhenever I open up a .dmg file, it just gets opened, but it stays under everything that I've got open.\nRight now I would have to launch Mission Control to see the opened .dmg window and then click on it, to become visible at the top.\nHow can I set it up to behave in a way, that when I open up a .dmg file, it gets displayed on top of everything?\n\nA: That's a Finder (on Lion) issue and as such, there are no settings to tweak for your problem. \nA faster way to reach the mount window is to simply click the Finder icon in your Dock.\n", "Q: Time Machine Backing Up Large Amounts of Data Each Time I've got 2 time machine drives. I have one at home that gets used on the weekend and another that gets backed up to during the week.  I recently replaced the one at my office.

You need to bring some form of O365 subscription to get all the features on all screen sizes. \n\n\nThe spell check is a native feature within iOS, rather than the app. So if you type in the app you will get the auto correct.\nYou can use Pages to spell check as this has the red lines but you can't put back into drop box.\nQuickOffice does sync with Dropbox, but doesn't spell check, (a feature which may be added soon) Documents to Go only offers dropbox sync with it's premium version which was misled by it's iTunes description. \n\nA: iWork on the iOS does use the system-level spellcheck. It is not a full spellcheck system, but it is still quite good.\nIf you need to sync to DropBox, check out DropDAV. It adds a webDAV access to DropBox, which can then be accessed via iWork on iOS. \n\nA: Microsoft now released office apps for iOS\n(Download Word)\nYou get OneDrive with your O365 subscription needed to edit documents on the iPad and of course Dropbox file sync with iOS 11 works quite well, too.\n\n\n", "Q: Getting Perl DBD::mysql working on OS X 10.7?

My current laptop has a VGA port and an HDMI port, and so it's pretty easy to run a dual-display setup with it. How would I connect my displays to my Macbook? \nBoth displays are 1080p HDMI computer monitors. \nIf I have to use Thunderbolt, will it work with Linux? I'm planning on dual-booting. \n\nA: You've pretty much got two options for two external monitors on a MacBook Pro:\nA) Two Apple Thunderbolt Displays\nThis is the least flexible, but highest performing solution. Obvious drawbacks are the cost, and not being able to use your existing displays. This only works on Thunderbolt equipped Macs with a discrete graphics card (i.e. not the 13\" MacBook Pro or any MacBook Air, nor the base Mini).\nB) DisplayLink adapter\nYou can use one display directly connected to the Thunderbolt/Mini Displayport with an mDP-HDMI adapter, and run the second one with a DisplayLink adapter. DisplayLink is essentially basic graphics card connected to your computer via USB. Because of the limitations of USB, it's not a high performance solution - don't expect to do any gaming on it. This does allow you to use your existing monitors, and at relatively modest expense. You may also want to check the current status of Lion support, as I remember seeing some posts about bugs relating to DisplayLink adapters - they may have been fixed by now however.\n\nA: Two important things will dictate if an arbitrary MacBook Pro will support two monitors:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does your MBP have Intel integrated graphics or one of the nicer discrete graphics chips?\n\n*Does it have one or two Thunderbolt ports?\n\n\nIf you have Intel's graphics only (the Intel HD Graphics), as found in the 13\" MacBook Pro (and the MacBook Air and some Mac minis), you can attach one monitor to the Thunderbolt/mini DisplayPort port.\nIf you have discrete graphics in addition to the Intel integrated graphics (as found on the 15\" and 17\" MacBook Pro models), you can attach multiple monitors even if you have only one Thunderbolt port. Remember, though, that all items on the Thunderbolt chain must be Thunderbolt devices until you get to the last item, which can be mini DisplayPort (this is because TB devices have a daisy-chain port; DisplayPort devices are not required to). All adapters for other display plugs that are currently (August 2011) sold are mini DisplayPort, not Thunderbolt, so they'll end the chain. Ergo, the only way to do multiple displays is to have Apple's Thunderbolt display (which has the TB daisy-chain port) and then have an adapter (or just another display) on that. When manufacturers start to make Thunderbolt display adapters, then you can get two of them and hook up whatever displays you want. \nAdditionally, two Thunderbolt ports allows you to use two Thunderbolt to DVI/DP/whatever adapters rather than buying a true Thunderbolt display that will allow a second non-Thunderbolt graphics adapter to be connected down the chain.\n@EmmEff's answer is correct insofar as USB to DVI adapters and their performance issues and the Dual-Link DVI stuff.\n\nA: I personally do not believe a USB to DVI adapter is acceptable if you're looking for any video performance on the second display.  If you absolutely insist on having two external displays, this might be an option.\nThe Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter is for displays requiring a Dual-Link DVI input.  AFAIK, it cannot be used for connecting multiple displays.\nAccording to this article, it is possible to connect only one Thunderbolt display to the MacBook Pro, so daisy-chaining is out.\n\nA: This Anandtech article features a dongle that will convert a DisplayPort signal to two HDMI signals. The resolution is limited, but may be sufficient for what you want to do.\n", "Q: Why is my iPod touch so slow after installing iOS 5? With iOS 4.x everything was super fast on my iPod Touch. Now with iOS 5, whenever there are a few apps open in the background, everything becomes slow.\nIt takes 20 seconds to switch between playlists. It's ridiculous.\nThe unfortunate thing is, thanks to Apple restrictions, I can't downgrade to iOS 4.x.\nOn Apple's official forum, other users report this problem too: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3376176?start=0&tstart=0\nWhat is going on with iOS performance?\n\nA: Newer iOS devices have more system memory, which is separate from the flash memory. The OS itself has a specific memory footprint at boot time, and the rest of the system memory is used by applications. I don't have any data on this, but I can imagine that each major revision of iOS (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) has a larger system memory footprint than the previous release.\nKeep in mind that the iPod Touch has a lower overall price than the iPhone released within the same year. An iPhone may cost $200 plus a two-year contract, but this is due to a subsidy paid by the wireless provider to Apple. So, the iPod Touch is expected to have a bit lower quality in terms of hardware specs (for example: system memory size, camera quality, CPU speed).\nTaking the iPhone 4 and iPod Touch 4th generation as examples, Wikipedia states that the iPhone 4 has 512MB of system memory, and the iPod Touch 4th gen has 256MB of system memory. When the system runs out of memory for applications, it must make more memory available by terminating background processes or reducing their memory footprint. This may take time. You're more likely to experience this overhead on a device with less system memory, and on a likely slower CPU.\n\nA: This provided answer is completely incorrect. I have a 4th gen touch and have notice MAJOR slowness after IOS5. \nHowever, if you want to get your device back to speed, put it in airplane mode. Once I discovered this, it became apparent that the culprit is the background data services that Apple uses to amass tons of personal data on its users. \nIn airplane mode, switching between applications is quick. Loading play lists is still slow, so I wonder if it has to do with DRM? Either way, Apple is turning me off with every update. \nUnless they add a projector to the next touch, I will not be upgrading.\n\nA: I had the same experience with my 4th generation iPod touch. I think it may be because you have too many apps? I deleted a lot of my apps, and it's faster. You can also try upgrading or restoring it. I didn't do that as it's too much work. If you double-press the home button, press and hold the apps, and then minus them, it goes faster :)\n\nA: You will have to reset your ipod touch, and turn some of the newer features that are really made for newer devices. If these don't help try to restore device as a new ipod.\nGo to this site and follow instructions,\nYou will see much improvement.\nhttp://www.techhormone.com/ipod-touch-running-slow-after-ios-5-upgrade/\n", "Q: What is the frame rate and shutter speed of the MacBook's iSight camera? I am writing some image processing software to be used with the webcam built-in to my MacBook (purchased in mid-2008 to be specific).  I want to know the specifications of it; particularly, frame rate (around 30 FPS from what I can tell) and exposure time / shutter speed.\n\nA: System Information (formerly known as System Profiler) will show you some information about the built-in camera (which Apple calls the iSight), but I don't see frame rate, exposure time, or shutter speed mentioned here. In my specific case, the manufacturer is listed as Apple, and they likely don't want to publish this information. Apple treats the built-in iSight as a simple checkbox feature (a computer has it or it doesn't), not as a detailed specs feature (like memory size, hard drive size, screen size, network speed, etc).\nTo view the information available about your Mac's built-in iSight, go to the Apple menu, choose About This Mac, then choose System Report… . From there, go into the Hardware section, choose USB, and look in the USB Device Tree for Built-in iSight.\niFixit is a company that often disassembles Apple products to try to determine things like the cost of the bill of materials, specific parts used, and unadvertised specs or capabilities of the hardware.

Symptom gone.\nI formatted and restored from time machine, still have the problem.\nThis is a dev box with tons of customization - I want to properly PURGE the mail and accounts settings at the file system level, since I know a 'new user profile' is a proper fix for the problem.\nEmptying the mail folders doesn't fix it, it re-downloads everything and the problem is still there.\nRemoving the accounts and re-adding doesn't fix it either.\n\nA: This is a problem with Mail.app on OSX Lion which affects Exchange accounts only when Mail rules are enabled. All other IMAP/POP accounts work fine with rules. The \"fix\" I received from my sysadmin was to disable Mail rules — a bit harsh, but in the end I ended up implementing the same set of rules (mostly moving to different mailboxes) server side.\nDigging further into this led me to this thread, and it seems the issue, while observed among Exchange users, has also affected others. Some of the suggestions there that worked were (not counting highly specific ones):\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete all rules that were formerly in Snow Leopard and recreate them from scratch in Lion.\n\n*Use MailActOn, a paid app that costs US$25 to set up your rules. Several users commented positively on its usefulness.\n\n\nOne thing in common with nearly all the complaints there (and mine) are that the rules involve moving messages to different mailboxes. Simpler ones like highlighting messages still work (for me too). So until this is fixed by Apple, I'd recommend implementing rules that involve moving mails on the server side or using the app above.\n\nA: As you are a Developer, I assume some familiarity with Terminal:\nfind Library -name '*[Mm]ail*' -print\n\nand delete all stuff relating to Mail. If this doesn't help, repeat the find looking for Exchange stuff.\n\nA: I have always renamed (and then later deleted) the ~/Library/Mail folder and ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist file. Once you relaunch Mail.app, it should ask you to set up an account again.\n", "Q: Can Apple update the firmware on a Made for iPod device using the iPhone? I have a Phillips alarm clock with iPod dock and an iPhone 4. When I got the iPhone 4 first, when i docked it with the alaram clock, i got an message on the screen of the iPhone saying that \"This accessory is not designed to work with the iPhone and may cause interference\", but after the upgrade to iOS5, this message does not occur. I did notice with iOS4 that interference would happen when playing music on the iPhone, but now it does  not seem to happen... \nAnd it started to make me think: How did my device \"learn\" to play nicely with the iPhone 4? Was it the iPhone that was tweaked? and either way, can Apple push down updates to these devices? I know thats a lot of devices, but could it happen?\n\nA: The accessory has to meet very strict design requirements from Apple to connect on the 30Pin connector. And the approval requires to work with the latest version of iOS. Due to this, the earlier versions of iOS may give you some error messages in some conditions.\nNot having seen your accessory, I would take a guess it would be due to the resistors that are connected to the USB D+/D- lines if it is only a charge only device (or) the authentication chip would be the latest version 2C\n\nA: Apple does not update the firmware of third party devices. But the iOS updates are a mixture of firmware and software updates to your phone. The firmware updates make very low-level changes to how the hardware systems operate, allowing for the possibility that the firmware changes in iOS5 changed the behavior of the iPhone's dock connector to make it better compatible with devices that were previously incompatible or only partially compatible.\nThe best way to get a definite confirmation of that theory is to consult the device manufacturer's support system or user forum. If that's what happened, you won't be the only one who experienced the change.\n", "Q: How can I set up a private virtual LAN for my laptop and its guest VMs I have two VirtualBox guest VMs running Linux under a MacOS X host.\nI'm using bridged networking mode but I am not in control of the DHCP server and can not give my host+guests static IPs. Any time a DHCP lease expires, or I join a different network, I have to deal with my VM IPs changing, and consequently change all my firewall rules and /etc/hosts entries, etc. which is a pain to say the least.\nSo I want to set up a virtual LAN on my laptop like 10.20.30.0/24. Then make my host OS (the laptop) be .1, and the guest VMs be .2 and .3. The VMs need to be able to access the Internet through the host's connection. Sometimes that would be out the wired interface, other times out the AirPort. It would be ideal if, when the host's internet connection changes from wired to wireless, guest internet access is not interrupted.\nCan I do this on OS X? What commands do I run, sysctls to set, etc.\n\nA: I haven't tried it on an OS X host but \"Host-only networking\" does what you want.

I wonder what the options are to monitor and somehow store statistics (over time) for when my modem loses and regains Internet connectivity.\nI wish to use this information when I contact my ISP.\nI'm thinking, would something like Instruments be able to do this?\n\nA: I maintain a script that chooses a random server that's known to respond to pings, and performs 100 pings (one second apart). I run this script by hand as a first indicator to determine if I'm having a connectivity or signal quality problem.\nThe ping command I use is ping -c 100 [server-hostname]\nI chose hostnames for my script that were known to respond to ping at the time that I wrote the script, and I tried to keep the list geographically diverse (for example by using university web servers). But this sort of technique requires maintenance, because servers don't consistently allow ping (server configurations change over time), and things like hosted servers disrupt the geographic diversity issue.\nI would think that Automator might be a better fit for this sort of task than Instruments, although if you're adept with scripting (shell, python, perl, etc), you could write a script to do it and use much less memory.\nAs for your situation, the source(s) of failure should dictate what kind of connectivity testing you do. The problem could be due to a piece of hardware within your home/office that needs to be periodically reset, or even replaced. The ping test I describe above doesn't necessarily isolate the source of the problem.\nEdit: and to address analysis/graphing, you could perform a ping test at a regular interval (every # minutes), export the packet loss percentage data in a format such as comma-separated values, and use a spreadsheet program to graph the results.\n\nA: I made a simple web app that checks your connection every second and plots the results on a chart:\nhttp://netcheck.stimulus.software/\n", "Q: External video cards with MacBook Pro?

I typically want Bluetooth off except when I am connected to my home wireless or wired network. It would be really handy if I could configure Bluetooth to turn on whenever I join my home network(s), and likewise, turn it off when I join a non-home network.\n\nA: ControlPlane is a supported development based on Marco Polo.\n\nA: Once upon a time I was using the free app Macro Polo to do location-aware configuration changes on my MBPro. Sadly, it's not been supported or developed since Snow Leopard. It's still available to try though and it might work well enough on Snow Leopard or Lion to meet your needs. Worth a shot, costs you nothing but time really.\nLocations 3 in the MAS purports to do all of the same things as Marco Polo.

I have some iTunes files with the file type AAC audio (protected) on Windows 7. The problem is that these songs only work with Apple software, and I want to remove the DRM.\n\nA: Apple offers a feature called iTunes Plus to upgrade most purchases to a DRM-free version for a small fee. This link will bring you directly to the appropriate section in iTunes to do this.\n\nA: With iTunes Match you can re-download them in iTunes Plus quality without DRM protection. And it's just $25 a year, definitely worth if you have more than an album with DRM. http://www.apple.com/icloud/features/\n\nA: Here's an article that lists three ways to do it. The first way involves burning audio to CD and re-importing, which would be lossy/transcoding. The second and third methods appear to be software-based techniques to remove the DRM from the files without transcoding. I have not tried any of these methods.\n\nA: Burning to Audio CD and re-ripping is not 'lossy' - yes you change codecs - however, you aren't losing quality going up to Audio CD from your 128 bit files.\nWhen you come back down from Audio CD quality - you could lose quality, however, you could use 'Apple Lossless' or just keep them as AIFF or WAV if you'd prefer. Then you haven't lost any quality from your original files - they are just LOTS bigger :)\n\nA: This answer only applies to someone with a Mac. I don't believe in paying iTunes again for something I already bought once. So, in case it helps someone else:\nI've been having success with the program Virtual CD-RW for Mac... there's a 15 day fully functional demo period. (http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/33355/virtual-cd-rw) \nBasically, it tricks your computer into thinking you've mounted a blank CD. So I just filtered out all my iTunes music whose Kind is Protected AAC (bought before they removed DRM), split it up into CD-sized playlists, and burn and import playlists one by one. Just a modification of burning all your songs to an audio CD and then importing.\n", "Q: iPhone 4S stereo sound \nPossible Duplicate:\niPhone 4 - sound only comes out of one speaker \n\nI finally got my iPhone 4S!

Windows restore seems to insist on wanting to format the entire drive though. Clearly I don't want to do this.\nIs there any way to restore the image back into the Boot Camp partition?\nI am willing to hack around the recovery console if necessary.\n\nA: Winclone might be a good solution. \nWinclone allows you to image a Bootcamp partition and migrate it to a new Mac, or in this case a freshly installed OS on a new HD.

Let me preface this by saying:\n\n\n*\n\n*I do not want to drop my firewall completely\n\n*Yes, I really do need particular ports rather than an application.\n\n\nSo I see that there is the option to allow particular applications through the firewall, but no equivalent way of opening ports.  It seems hard to believe that this is actually impossible.  How can I open a specific TCP port in OS X 10.6 while keeping the rest of the ports firewalled?\n\nA: The builtin firewall used by OS X is ipfw. To learn more about it from the Terminal you can enter man ipfw.\nTo create a new firewall rule to allow incoming traffic on to a particular port you can enter the rule from the Terminal as follows.\nsudo ipfw add 40000 allow tcp from any to any dst-port portnum\n\nwhere portnum is the number of the port you wish opened. In this case I've added a rulenum of 40000 to the rule so that if you ever wanted to remove it the following command will suffice.\nsudo ipfw delete 40000\n\nIf you enter the command sudo ipfw list you will see the active commands. To reload the firewall issue the command sudo ipfw flush\nIf you want to log the hits the rule is getting you can add the log command as follows, sudo ipfw add 40000 allow log ...\nI chose the rulenum 40000 somewhat arbitrarily as rules exist from 1 to 65535, though certain numbers are privileged. This just makes it easier to delete the rule later, if needed.\n\nA: The application WaterRoof will be able to let you do this and more.\n\nA: Worked for me.\nI wanted to open traffic on port 70, so I entered the following:\nsudo ipfw add 7000 allow tcp from any to any dst-port 70\n\nThe response from the command-prompt was:\n07000 allow tcp from any to any dst-port 70\n\nYes, the 0 was automatically added to the rule #, so it is worth noting that any rule ID < 10,000 will be prefixed by one or more zeroes.\n", "Q: My iPod Nano seems to have been lost in post!

I have disabled the \"Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps\" checkbox in the General preferences pane in Lion, but after a recent sudden power loss (no battery) my iMac restarted in exactly the same state as I had left it the night before. What feature of Lion is making this (miracle) possible, and how do I ensure that it remans enabled? \n\nI read for example that I can \"disable Resume\", because it \"duplicates\" something called \"Safe Sleep\", but I'm not sure what any of these features are, how they are related, or how I can control them. For example, does the behavior I saw in my recent power loss mean that my machine had gone to sleep between my last use and the power failure, or is some kind of snapshotting taking place continuously in the background? I also understand that there are different \"kinds\" of sleep. If sleep is indeed necessary, do different triggers (keyboard, script, idle, etc.) for sleep result in different \"kinds\" of sleep.\n\nA: Resume, counterintuitively, does not actually save anything itself. It simply relaunches all the applications that were running when you shut your computer down. It's the job of those Lion-compatible applications to restore their windows.\nSafe sleep, on the other hand, saves a snapshot of your RAM to your HDD when you put your computer to sleep. In case of power failure, the machine boots from this file on startup.\nSafe sleep is the only time (that I know of) that OS X saves its RAM.\nYou can use the pmset command line utility (specifically the sudo pmset -a hibernatemode x command where x is the sleep mode) to change the sleep mode, although there is no significant benefit in doing this.\nThe three main different kinds of sleep are as follows (from the pmset man page):\n\nhibernatemode = 0 (binary 0000) by default on supported desktops. The\n  system will not back memory up to persistent storage. The\n       system must wake from the contents of memory; the system will lose context on power loss. This is, historically, plain old sleep.\nhibernatemode = 3 (binary 0011) by default on supported portables. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent\n  storage\n       (the disk), and will power memory during sleep. The system will wake from memory, unless a power loss forces it to restore from\n       disk image.\nhibernatemode = 25 (binary 0001 1001) is only settable via pmset. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage\n       (the disk), and will remove power to memory. The system will restore from disk image. If you want \"hibernation\" - slower sleeps,\n       slower wakes, and better battery life, you should use this setting.\n\nAs I stated before, configuring the sleep mode is not recommended (again from the pmset man page):\n\nWe do not recommend modifying hibernation settings. Any changes you\n  make are not supported. If you choose to do so anyway, we recommend\n  using one of these three settings. For your sake and mine, please\n  don't use anything other 0, 3, or 25.\n\nI don't know about the script vs. user issue, although I highly doubt there is a difference.\n\nA: The other answer is too complex ^\n\"safe sleep\" aka hibernate on windows: if enabled, will sleep ur computer but also write the RAM to a file on the hard drive. Restarting the power will allow u continue from the previous state.\n\"Resume\" saves the states of open applications when turning off/logging off your computer to meta files, and later freshly reloads your OS and Apps, but resumes based on the specifications of the meta files. Resume is a convince, not a safety net. I recommend you turn it on, might save some time and it doesn't really cost you anything\n", "Q: What do these different terms for system memory in OS X mean? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat does it mean if I have lots of “Inactive” memory at the end of a work day? \n\nI just bought a MacBook Pro (I've been a Windows user before this), and I noticed that the terminology for memory is a bit different here.

Is it common on OS X? Even if I log out and log in again, and ensure none of the apps are running, the used memory value is above 2 GB! What will happen if I have lots of high memory consuming processes running?\n\nA: Free memory\nThis is RAM that's not being used.\nWired memory\nInformation in this memory can't be moved to the hard disk, so it must stay in RAM. The amount of Wired memory depends on the applications you are using.\nActive memory\nThis information is currently in memory, and has been recently used.\nInactive memory\nThis information in memory is not actively being used, but was recently used.\nUsed\nThis is the total amount of memory used.\nVM size\nThis is the total amount of Virtual Memory for all processes on your Mac. \nPage ins / Page outs\nThis refers to the amount of information moved between RAM and the hard disk. This number is a cumulative amount of data that Mac OS X has moved between RAM and disk space.\nSwap used\nThis is the amount of information copied to the swap file on your hard drive.\nSee official Source for more details.\n\nThe high memory usage has occurred ever since Mac OS X Lion. I don't really now why this is. But generally it's good if your RAM is being used.\nIf you clear your ram too often, programs start slower because they have to be loaded into the RAM again.\n\nA: From this Apple support doc:\n\n\n*\n\n*Free memory: This is RAM that's not being used.\n\n*Wired memory: Information in this memory can't be moved to the hard disk, so it must stay in RAM.

Sorry.\nA possible workaround:\nIf the app, and your Mac, support iCloud, set it up on both and look inside \"~/Library/Mobile Documents/\" on your Mac.\nIn there should be a folder corresponding to each app you have iCloud enabled for. You might have to look around the sub-folder structure to see exactly where the files you want to add need to go, but once you figure that out, you can write your script to target that location.\nWhen your script adds a file to that location, it will sync via iCloud. I use this trick all the time to get files into my GoodReader app.\nBeware that iOS apps don't always sync to iCloud in the background. In the case of GoodReader I need to open it for the changes to update.\n\nA: Although this post is old, I would like to add a few things. I am able to use AppleScripts to send things to my device, but your device needs to be jailbroken (AKA rooted)\nHere is how it works:\nRun Cydia and install OpenSSH.\nOn your Mac, run one of the following commands to generate a rsa or dsa ssh key. (I used rsa, because it is newer)\nssh-keygen -t rsa\nssh-keygen -t dsa\n\nIt will make a file in your folder /User/[yourusername]/.ssh (also known as ~/.ssh or $HOME/.ssh). Put the id_rsa.pub or id_dsa.pub on your ipad somewhere, perhaps off the root with \nscp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@nameofipad:/\n\nThen log into your ipad (caps sensitive) Ignore all the complaints and just say yes, enter Alpine for the password (if you haven't changed it (change with the command passwd from the ipad's root prompt):\nssh root@nameofipad\n\nNow we are going to take the information stored in this public ssh key and write it to a file on your iPad. First we have to make the folder on the iPad and then write  the information.\nmkdir ~/.ssh && cat /rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\nNow the file authorized_keys will contain the key from your Mac. One last important step is to set the correct permissions to the authorized_keys file:\nchmod 666 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\nAppleScript\nYou can now send files to your device via AppleScript. For example, I often edit PDF files with the iOS app iAnnotate PDF. I used iFile on the iPad to identify the folder for the app and I run the following AppleScript to send files to its documents folder:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set ProcessList to name of every process\n    if \"Skim\" is in ProcessList then\n        tell application \"Skim\"\n            if document 1 exists then\n                set the_file to POSIX path of (get file of document 1 as text)\n                set my_script to \"scp -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \" & the_file & \" root@JokosiPad.local:/User/Applications/01F8F1E6-BA09-412B-8069-355E7717F409/Documents\"\n                do shell script my_script\n            end if\n        end tell\n    end if\nend tell\n\nThis script will take whatever file I am reading in Skim (PDF reader) and push it to the iPad. On the iPad (and iPhone) I can start iAnnotate and go to the iTunes Sharing folder and see the file. It is really cool and avoids Apple's stupid iTunes-only crap.\nLet me explain the obvious, then the not so obvious:\nObvious\n\n\n*\n\n*set the script to variable my_script\n\n*run myscript\n\n\nNot Obvious\nWe tell scp to write the host file information to /dev/null, which basically is a dedicated device that is like a black hole. Everything you write into it is gone. We just need to make scp happy and let it write to something. The other option, -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no makes the connecting not confirm a connection with \"Are you sure you want to connect\".  This allows AppleScript to have unobstructed access to your iPad.\nKeep in mind, your iPad host name (mine is JokosiPad) can be found easily by going to the Settings app and clicking general and about. The \"Name\" record contains the host name to use like JokosiPad.local instead of memorizing the IP Address (which can change).\nI hope this helps somebody!\n", "Q: Broken icon in the applications folder in the dock I downloaded an application and copied it to the Applications folder.

Keyboard shortcuts still work.\nGoing back into System Preferences, changing the Hot Corner to some other action and then back to Mission Control resolves the problem temporarily. But eventually it fails again.\nThis wasn't always a problem with Lion. Mission Control Hot Corners used to work fine. I'm not certain, but I think the problem started with the 10.7.2 update. Either that, or some other software recently installed on my Mac is causing a conflict.\nAny idea on how to resolve the unreliable Hot Corners?\n27\" iMac Core i3, OS X 10.7.2\n\nA: The problem could be related to a corrupted Dock Preferences file (Hot Corner settings are stored with the Dock preferences). If this is the solution, as a part of it, you will end up having to reset most if not all Dock related settings (scroll bar visibility, scroll bar behavior, auto hide, Dock screen position, icons in the dock, etc.).\nTry this: \nOpen Terminal (Terminal can be found the Utilities folder. To locate the Utilities folder, in Finder, click Go -> Utilities)\nType in the following commands:\nmv ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist ~/Desktop/\nkillall \"Dock\"\n\nAt this point, open System Preferences and reset your Dock preferences and set the hot corners. Hopefully this will work for you. \nCommand Explanation: The first command moves the existing Dock preferences file to the Desktop to serve as an improptu backup. The second command quits the Dock. Mac OS will instantly reopen the Dock with a fresh preferences file.\nIf this did not work, you can optionally restore your old preferences file with the following commands:\nIn Terminal:\nrm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist\nmv ~/Desktop/com.apple.dock.plist ~/Library/Preferences/\nkillall \"Dock\"\n\n\nA: Just found the easiest solution!

I like the simplicity of iPhoto and all the nice ordering features. But, since I like to manage my library myself (folder names etc) I have not selected the option to import my photos to iPhotos' folder structure, but rather prefer to import my photos to iPhoto but keep them where they are (in my own folders).\nOne drawback to this, is that when I delete a photo from my iPhoto Library, it won't also delete the original file (even if I empty its trash), which makes iPhoto useless for managing my photos (for example, checking a new batch an deleting the ones I don't like). Has anyone managed to work around this stupid feature of iPhoto?\n\nA: iPhoto has an internal file storage system where it saves all the photos for the events, albums etc.\nYou notice this, when you select an event and click \"Show in folder\". Then you see the whole folder with all the pictures in it.\nYou should treat events or albums as your folders. You can give them custom names and everything.\nWhat I have done is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Import all photos to iPhoto\n\n*Delete original files\n\n*Just work with iPhoto (when I want to see the photos in a folder structure, I can choose \"Show in folder\".\n\n\nNote: I have heard that you can have an external file storage for your photos with Apperture. This is iPhoto with more functionality for 200 USD, in case you do a lot of work with iPhoto this might be interesting.\n\nA: In iPhoto you're running a Referenced Library - where you store the originals in your own filing system and iPhoto refers to them in that location. In this scenario you've opted to take control of the file management suites, and just like you have to manually move the files to your chosen location for storage, you also have to move them away when you're finished with them.\nWhile on the face of it Referenced Libraries seem attractive to some users, they offer no extra functionality and can be problematic if you migrate to a new system, or even want to move them to a new disk. You really want to think hard before running iPhoto in Referenced Mode.\nAperture has all the tools necessary to run Referenced Libraries, including the option to delete Masters stored elsewhere when trashing from the Library.\nFWIW: A Managed Library, is the default setting, and iPhoto copies files into the iPhoto Library when Importing. The files are then stored in the Library package\n \nFor a fuller discussion of the implications of running a Referenced Library in iPhoto see\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3062728?tstart=0\n\nA: I found a workaround. For instance you can look at your photos and while you are doing it \"flag\" the ones you want to delete (see iPhoto's Menu-->Photos-->Flag Photo for a shortcut). Once you have \"flagged\" all the photos you want to delete, then go ahead and select them all (in the left hand column of the iPhoto window there is a \"Flagged\" icon, right above the \"Trash\" icon - click on it and you'll see al your flagged photos on the display window). Do a simple Edit-->Select All and then mouse-right-click on one of them and select \"Show File\". This will open a window with the folder where your originals are located, and in this case the ones you want to delete will be already and conveniently selected for you. Then simply go ahead and trash them with your mouse or with the \"Delete\" icon on the Toolbar and voilá!. (if the Toolbar is not showing then simply select from the Finder menu View-->Show Toolbar). You can save your $200 from Aperture.\n", "Q: Windows Live XMPP and iChat I'm not all too familiar with the XMPP protocol, but ever since Microsoft released official XMPP support for Windows live Messenger, i've been wondering how to make it work with the \"Jabber\" account type on iChat (which is also XMPP). Anyone found a solution?\n\nA: A lot of blog sites seem to have assumed that Windows Live's XMPP support would work with any existing Jabber client, but it isn't so.\nTo log into the Windows Live Messenger network with XMPP, a client program needs to use OAuth; i.e. it has to direct you to Microsoft's web site to log in to Windows Live, and then it has to connect to MS via XMPP and pass a token it got using OAuth. \nSo, to use iChat with it, either iChat would have to add support for all of that specifically, or there would need to be some kind of proxy in between iChat and the MS servers that would do the authentication part and then pass everything else through for iChat. Sadly, I haven't heard of anyone building anything like that yet.\nIf all you wanted to do is to connect to the Windows Live Messenger network from iChat, you might have more luck just going through a Jabber server that has the MSN Transport installed, which connects to the Windows Live Messenger network using the old fashioned MSNP protocol instead of XMPP.\n", "Q: Setting time format preference in unix (Mac-Terminal) I'm learning to work in unix using Terminal on a Mac and I'd like to set the default listing for the timestamp to display in 12 hour time, using AM and PM, instead of 24 hour time (ie: 1:00 PM, not 13:00). I'm somewhat familiar with setting preferences, so to speak, using the ~/.bashrc file, where I've set a couple of aliases, including one with the options for my preferred ls display. I've looked at the man pages and elsewhere online, but I haven't had any luck finding what I'm looking for time-wise though. Any suggestions would be appreciated.  \n\nA: Using GNU ls, on Linux, there is a --time-style flag you can use to specify one of a few pre-defined time types, or specifying a completely custom +FORMAT style like the date command accepts. However, BSD ls, which Apple ships, does not support this flag.\nI've seen similar discrepancies in commands like date and tar as well, all rooted in the differences between the GNU and BSD variants.\n\nA: The Mac OS terminal uses a bash shell. The prompt is controlled by the PS1 environment variable described more here. Try this for example.\nexport PS1='\\t$ '\n\nIt will give you a prompt looking something like this\n19:40:14$ \n\n\nA: man date\nCheck out the \"+format\" option.  You could create a shell alias to display the date using a custom format.\nIf you're referring to the time format used by 'ls', I don't believe there is any way to change that.\n\nA: to get 12:00 AM/PM use\n  export PS='\\@'\n\nI hope this helps.\nP.S.

And I cannot find it this time. :(. I had reset apple tv2 earlier and forgot to turn on home sharing.

When I remove the lan cable, it tells me the tv is not connected and asks me to choose settings.... which of course, I cannot do without the hardware remote. \nIs there any way that I can get back control of my apple tv2 without my lost remote but from my ipad remote app solely?\n\nA: You can use the iOS \"Remote\" app to control iTunes on your Mac or PC.  As part of this, you can change the audio output from the computer to any AirPlay device on the network, including the Apple TV.\nYou cannot, however, directly control the Apple TV's GUI.  Buy a new Apple remote, or a universal remote (love my Harmony Ones!).\nIf the LAN cable is a big deal, you might be able to solve that plugging the ATV into your Mac or PC (needs a micro-USB cable, though, which isn't too common yet) and then doing a restore.  This should remove the static IP, but it might also require you to walk through some setup menus when you next turn on your ATV.  That would be a problem without the remote.\nI'd get a new remote, and then I think you can fix ALL the problems mentioned here.\n\nA: A little late to the party, but checkout the workaround of this problem \nSetup Apple TV (2nd Gen) with neither a remote nor home sharing turned on\n", "Q: iPod Touch can't download apps Since yesterday, my first-generation iPod Touch would not let me download apps.

Can I load and play audibooks on the iPod shuffle 2GB? \nIf so, how many standard novels can I fit on there, am I only allowed to download from the iTunes shop or can I also load from the library?\n\nA: Yes you can load audiobooks onto the shuffle, The amount you load depends entirely on the size of the books. But to answer your question a 5 CD audio book uses about 120mb of data.\nThe formatted iPod Shuffle has in the region of 1966mb of free space.

With iCloud, do I need to keep the apps in iTunes on the MacBook anymore? When I try to delete them all in iTunes by clicking on the Apps link on the left side of iTunes and then selecting all of the apps and right clicking delete, a message appears saying that the apps will also be deleted from my iPad and iPhone. Is this really the case with iCloud or is it safe to delete them from the MacBook and free up the disk space? I think these files are stored in a folder called Mobile Applications on the MacBook.\n\nA: As Adam has said, you should disable syncing applications and yes it is safe.\nHowever if an app gets pulled from the App Store by Apple, which you have purchased but do not have currently install on your iOS device, you will not be able to get it back from iCloud. Whereas if you have it saved on your computer in iTunes you can get the app back by syncing.\niCloud doesn't actually back up the apps on your iPhone, it only stores your data for that app, if your restore from iCloud then it will download the apps clean from the App Store and then insert your data from iCloud, so that it appears that the entire app has been backed up. \nIf they backed up the entire app, for every user of an app there would be that many copies of that app on iCloud which is hugely wasteful.\nSo don't delete apps that are no longer on the app store else you won't be able to get them back. And if you have an app that looks like it will get pulled shortly (e.g. the app has tethering hidden inside of it) keep it on your computer. But most apps you are fine deleting and just relying on iCloud.\n\nA: Yes, it's safe to delete them. Just make sure you have syncing off (look for options at the bottom of your devices' summary pages in iTunes) and don't connect them to your MacBook while iTunes is open. To be safe, also go to the Apps tab (at the top, not the left) and untick Sync Applications. \nBut before you start deleting, in case of problems, I suggest you make sure iCloud is turned on in both your devices' settings, and perform a backup. This is all in Settings > iCloud. \n\nA: No, after a few years or even months you can't download your apps from the App Store (iCloud) if they decide not to sell them anymore.\n", "Q: How to use Gmail contacts on an iPod Touch I have an iPod Touch 4. It easily lets me set up the Mail and Calendar apps to use my Gmail account, but I can't seem to find a way to get the Contacts app to use my Gmail contacts.

An unknown error occurred (9) This is an issue that occurred to my iPhone.\nWhat is the recommended general fix for this?\n\nA: I was able to fix this issue by plugging my iPhone into another Windows machine, then placing the iPhone back onto the original machine, then doing a restore on the iPhone.\n\nA: I had this error occur today when attempting to update my iPhone 4 to iOS5.  I'm using the latest iTunes (10.5) on Windows 7.  Here's how I resolved it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnected all devices from my computer except the iPhone and rebooted the laptop\n\n*Put the iPhone in Airplane mode, then cycle the power (power down, power back up)\n\n*Connect the iPhone and restart the update in iTunes\n\n\nA: Re-try again, then run Console for any further details.\nFor advanced solution try to Download and install OS X USB Debug Kits which will provide more information about USB device and interface detection, driver and interface matching, driver loading and information generated as a result of normal and abnormal conditions.\n", "Q: How can I insert text in middle of a document and have images move down too? I have a document with text and floating images. Let's say I want to insert some text in the middle of the document. If i click in the document and hit enter a bunch of times, I want the existing text and images to slide down so I can put my new content there, but only the text moves down and the images don't. \nHow can I make it so everything would slide down when I press enter.\n\nA: You could use inline objects that cause text to be wrapped:\n\n\nA: You can have text alongside the images by choosing \"Object Causes Wrap\" and then selecting one of the left three options. I don't know how the default is chosen, but it sometimes chooses one of the right two options, both of which keep it clear on either side of an object.\nYou can also move floating objects in a long document by using Section Breaks (under the insert menu). These act like page breaks, but keep text and floating images together within a section, so a change on page one only affects images in that section. It is not perfect, but it is better than the alternative.\nIf you really want to control things, bite the bullet and use Page Layout mode when you create a new document. You can set up linked text boxes where text rows around images that are fixed to a page.\n\nA: It's because you have floating images.\nIf you select them and press the inline button in the toolbar, they will also move down when you insert content on above them.\n", "Q: Can I use iCloud with my devices on Windows XP? We have two XP machines (in different cities) that up to now they have been the the hosts for syncing and backing up an iPad and iPhone via iTunes via USB.  We want to make use of iCloud, at least for backing up the iPhone and iPad.  As you know iCloud / it's control panel isn't supported on XP (without a hack to the installer).\nI've got some questions about how the syncing and iCloud backup process will work in my situation.\n1) Is it correct that we can enable iCloud on the iPhone and iPad (via iTunes on XP or directly on the iPhone and iPad) without the iCloud control panel being installed on XP?\n2) If we use iCloud on the iPhone/iPad - and can't enable iCloud on XP - how will apps and media be synced to the XP iTunes?  Manually?\n3) In the case of XP iTunes without iCloud and iPhone/iPad enabled apps, media, photos and data, is it correct that we would still benefit from iCloud automatic syncing of apps, media and data to/between the iPhone/iPad without risk of losing any media on the XP iTunes (as long as we manually sync XP iTunes with the App/iTunes Store)?\n\nA: *\n\n*No. iCloud requires Windows Vista SP2 or Windows 7.\n\n*Data will have to be synced manually, yes.\n\n*Yes, manually syncing iTunes will not interfere with iCloud. All devices connected to iCloud will sync automatically and update their contents in the cloud after they have been manually synced.\n", "Q: How can I record a verbal or sound to use as a ringtone for specific numbers I have an iPhone 4S with iOS 5.\nHow do I record speech or sound to use as a ringtone dedicated to certain phone numbers, especially numbers that aren't in my address book?\n\nA: I think this is two questions. How do I record ringtones? and How do I get a ringtone for non-contacts? I will address the second. \nYou cannot explicitly set a ringtone for numbers not in you address book. But, you can get this effect. Simply make sure all your contacts have a \"custom\" ringtone set. Then, set your default ringtone to something else. You can do this with only two ringtones, one for contacts and one for the non-contacts. Or, you could customize your contacts as much as you want. Just make sure that every time you add a contact you give them a rintone other than the default.\n\nA: I'll answer the first of these two questions. Once you've recorded audio (e.g. with Audacity):\n\n\n*\n\n*Add each sound file to iTunes\n\n*Right click each and convert to AAC\n\n\n*\n\n*If you see \"Convert to MP3\" or otherwise in the context menu, visit Preferences > General > CD Import Settings > Import Using AAC Encoder\n\n\n*Reveal those files in Finder and rename their extensions from .m4a to .m4r\n\n*Add the .m4r files to your iTunes Library (they'll automatically be added to the Tones section)\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't see Tones in your library, visit Preferences > General > Show > Tones\n\n\n*Remove the entries for the original clips from iTunes (sort by Date Added to quickly round them up). (iTunes probably won't ask whether to keep/trash originals in this case, since these files are missing, as far as it knows.)\n\n*Connect your iPhone, visit the Tones tab, and choose to sync all tones\n\n\nYou should now see your tones on your iPhone under Settings > Sounds > Ringtone. Refer to Morgan Wise's answer for a trick to have separate ringtones for known & unknown numbers.

This wiped out everything on the iPhone, of course.\nNow I'm trying to help them restore data, apps, music, etc.  There was a device backup in iTunes on the old laptop so I copied the contents of the MobileSync folder between the two systems.  On the new laptop, I restored from backup via iTunes.  Then, I proceeded to download all previous purchases in iTunes (apps, music), and then tried to sync:\n\n\n*\n\n*First I synced apps only. No problemo.\n\n*Then I added music to the sync settings. Houston, we have a problem.\n\n\nWhen I try to sync music it says that the iPhone is associated with another iTunes library and the phone will be erased.  Ugh.  If I only try to sync apps, there isn't an issue.  But of course, they want their music copied back to the iPhone. :)\nIn short, how do I accomplish all of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restore important data from the iTunes device backup copied from the old laptop\n\n*Ability to sync all purchased/future purchases of music\n\n*Ability to sync all purchased/future purchases of apps\n\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Note: This is all done on a Mac. Just look up the PC equivalent of the following steps if required.\nHow to recover past information:\nOption 1 - Restore iPhone 4 directly from old computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect iPhone 4 to old computer, open iTunes, put the iPhone in DFU mode, (while holding alt/option key) select Restore after iTunes has detected the iPhone 4 in recovery mode, and select the most recent backup of that iPhone 4.\n\n\nOption 2 - Copy iPhone 4 backup from old computer, and place on new computer to recover:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the old computer, go to ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup, and copy the most recent backup of the iPhone 4 and transfer it to the new computer.\n\n*Connect iPhone 4 to old computer, open iTunes, put the iPhone in DFU mode, (while holding alt/option key) select Restore after iTunes has detected the iPhone 4 in recovery mode, and select the most recent backup of that iPhone 4.\nHow to create the ability to sync all purchased/future purchases of music and apps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes.\n\n*Sign out any pre-existing AppleID/iTunes Account once iTunes loads.\n\n*Sign into desired account of individual (your relative's I'm assuming).\n\n*In iTunes, select Store -> Authorize This Computer...\n\n*Rejoice!\n\n*Have your relative use iCloud for backup to make life easier in the future.\nLet me know if you have any more questions, or need any futher explanation. Enjoy!\n\nA: You need to roll-back and roll-forward.\n\n\n*\n\n*Attach the iPhone to the old laptop.\n\n*Open iTunes.\n\n*Click the restore button to restore it to an old backup before the upgrade (it will get all the music back).\n\n*Upgrade the iPhone while attached to the new computer.\n\n\nThat should get you there. In your question you didn't say which computer you wanted to sync with when you were done. Switching computers is a complication.\n\nA: do you know if you still have the pre-iOS 5 backup on the original computer?  if so, try - \n\n\n*\n\n*connect the iphone to the original computer that it used to sync to before it was updated\n\n*restore the iphone backup (pre iOS 5) to the iphone via itunes\n\n*update the iphone to iOS 5 using the original computer\n\n\nif you're stuck with the new computer, try copying the old itunes library to the new computer and then sync.\n", "Q: How can I repair a hard drive that Disk Utility and Disk Warrior can't fix? I have a Mac Pro running Mac OS X Lion, and one of my hard drives has acted weird since attempting to repair permissions. I used Disk Warrior, but it says the HD can't be rebuilt. When I try to format it with Disk Utility, it takes forever to unmount.\nI'm wondering if there is a surefire way to format the HD with another program or through the command line.\nThe HD is 2TB, and the SMART status is verified, so I doubt it is a physical issue.\n\nA: Many problems can cause such a problem. SMART status is unreliable, but it's good that it's at least 'OK'.\nIf you don't care about data and just want to format and repartition your HDD then you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check the disk for bad sectors.

[orignally posted to stackoverflow.com - it was suggested that this would be a better place for it]\nI'd like to start experimenting with iOS development, but to coin an (awful) phrase: \"I'm a PC\".  I love my Windows 7 laptop and don't want to move wholesale to a MacBook Pro.  Instead what I'd like to do is buy a Mac Mini and use it as a server.  I've read that:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Mac Mini is suitable for iOS development.  Add more RAM for a better experience.\n\n*MAC OS does support VNC.\n\n\nI use VNC daily to access Linux machines, but I've never used a Mac.  By \"never\" I literally mean I have never put my hands on a Mac keyboard - and I've been a programmer for 25 years.\nWhat I specifically don't know - and would like an answer to - is whether using a VNC client from Windows will give me the full Mac OS desktop, sufficient to fully administer the machine and then run the iOS development suite at full fidelity.  And if not VNC, then what?\nThanks.\n\nA: Yes, VNC will give you access to the full Mac desktop and to Xcode for iOS SDK development, if the Mac is so configured.  Apple sells remote admin tools that use this protocol.\nThe problem with using VNC for iOS development is that you will also need access to the Mac's USB port to do any direct app loading and debugging on an iOS device.\nIf you can do without needing to connect a debugger, you can transfer Ad Hoc iOS app builds and provision files from the Mac to your PC and use iTunes to install your apps for testing.\nIf you want to try it out, there are reported to be services that will rent you VNC access to a Mac in a data center somewhere.  You will need admin/root access to install the iOS SDK tools.\nIf you prefer RDP to VNC, iRAPP is a commercial RDP terminal server available for use on Mac OS X.\n", "Q: Can homebrew and macports work together to let Firefox-X11 be installed? I want to install firefox-x11 but theres no repo in homebrew, only macports seems to have one, hence I'm at a loss how to get firefox-X11 on a system that relies on homebrew for OSS.\nThe way I'd solve this is:\n\n\n*\n\n*install software with macports (Firefox-X11 in particular)\n\n*remove macports\n\n*install homebrew and still use the software installed by macports (firefox)\n\n\nI fear this will not work.\n\nA: No - as removing macports will remove the software it installs. Macports )and Fink) are designed so that they use directories that only they update and control so that they have full control of what happens).\nIn this case however you can get to this stage.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Remove Homwbrew or at least remove or rename /usr/local\n\n*Install macports and check that the /opt/local/bin is at the end of\nyour path\n\n*Install firefox-xll\n\n*Reinstall Homebrew or restore /usr/local\n\n\nAs /usr/local/bin is before /opt/local/bin in your path then you will get the Homebrew program before the macports one.\n", "Q: How to enable Antialiasing in Finder's preview column and QuickLook? The title pretty much says it all, plain text files are a bit annoying to read on QuickLook (and to preview on finder's preview column) due to a lack of antialiasing.\nOn the General preference panel I've checked that my text smoothing is set to ~“Turn off for sizes 4 and smaller”.\nI've also checked with TextEdit that the font size in QuickLook is quite on the bigger-than-4 side, and that I can see the text antialiased in TextEdit.\nDoing some googling I only found people with the same need but 0 solutions.\nFor the record: this is a brand new mac with OS X Lion 10.7.2 as fully updated as I can, that arrived home last week and I haven't (yet) installed any plugin at all for QuickLook.\n\nA: My solution is to just use a different QuickLook generator. My generator of choice is qlcolorcode. Antialiasing works perfectly well with it and it'll even highlight source code files—which is its main purpose.\nThere is one bug, however, that if you are dealing with any directories or files containing a ' (single quote), there will be no QuickLook available for it due to the way the generator sends the path to the highlighter program.\nAnother downside is that the filename will not show in the QuickLook window. Instead, it will just say \"Source file\". It also will not work on textClipping files.\n", "Q: Where can I find the old version of the Mint app for iOS 4? I'm on a jailbroken iPhone 4 running iOS 4.3.5. There is still not an untethered jailbreak for iOS 5, so I am not able to upgrade yet.\nMint has gotten a bit ahead of themselves and released a new version of their iOS app that requires iOS 5. The old version supported on iOS 4, but it is no longer available. There has been some talk on their support forum about the issue, but there doesn't seem to be a solution.\nWhere can I find the old version of the Mint app that supports iOS 4?\n\nA: Unfortunately, This is not possible due to current App Store limitations unless someone else with a jail broken iPhone that you trust has a copy of it that you can grab. One problem with dealing with the Apple App Store is that older versions are forever lost due to Apple's App Store polices. We should be giving concerned feedback to Apple to address this issue too, not just the app developers. So it looks like your best option if you need to have the Mint app, is to read up on the latest jailbreak, and insure your jailbreak path, then update your iPhone to the latest iOS, and then re-jailbreak it. The good news is that there is a untethered jailbreak for both iOS 5 and iOS 5.0.1 for the iPhone 4 as referenced in my comment above.\n", "Q: QuickTime add-ons? How to tell what's needed? I've been chatting on Chatzy via Firefox on the Mac lately, and every time I go there I get told that I need to update QuickTime components. Here's the dialog that comes up:\n\nIt then links me to this site, which offers a range of addons. However, there is no indication which of these things I need to run the page. I don't want to install all the extensions, obviously, but I would like to get the one I need. Is there any way to tell what's lacking?\n\nA: Perian is frequently chosen, for being complete and suitable. A lot of people say it's one of those things you should put on every new Mac. VLC has browser plugins, but I've never noticed Perian not handling everything (not sure I would know, neither are bloated).\n\nA: Generally Perian will cover most of your needs. Codecs are generally loaded on an \"as needed\" basis so you will be fine even if you install all of them. Note though that some of the older codecs listed may be PPC-only if they are really old and won't work on Lion.\nFlip4Mac WMV is another good one, it is the official QT component for all of Microsoft's formats.\n", "Q: How do I repair movies with \"invalid public movie atoms\"? I've got a movie file that gives me the following error every time it opens in any QuickTime based player:\n\nThe movie could not be opened.\n  An invalid public movie atom was found in the movie.\n\nIs there any tool I can use in 10.5 on my PowerBook to fix the file?\nAnd please, don't suggest using VLC; it can play the file, but it can't fix it.\nIdeally I want to avoid re-encoding the streams.\n\nA: I recommend using the free app HandBrake to re-encode the movie, which will hopefully fix the problem.\nOpen HandBrake and it will automatically ask you to select a source (otherwise, you can use the Source toolbar item). Select the problematic movie and click Open.\nMake sure the Presets panel is visible by clicking the Toggle Presets toolbar item. Then, under Apple, select the Universal preset.\nThe default settings should be fine, but you can tweak them if you like.\nClick the Start toolbar item to begin. HandBrake will chug away and re-encode the file. That's likely to fix any problems with the encoding.\n\n\nA: There is an old Mac app called Dumpster that allows you to view and edit Quicktime movie atoms. Ages ago I came across a tutorial online on how to fix the \"invalid movie atom\" problem using Dumpster, but I've lost the url and have never found the tutorial since through Google. Dumpster can still be found, I believe.\nFor me, it's easier to re-encode the movie or try \"optimizing\" it with Subler.\nMore info here on QT movie atoms:\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/QuickTime/QTFF/QTFFChap2/qtff2.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000939-CH204-SW1\nUpdate:\nOkay, I found a thread that gives more detailed instructions on how to possibly fix an invalid movie atom. This one is for .mov files but will apply to .mp4 if you're using Atom Inspector. You're going to want a good file to compare to the bad one. Ideally, you want the good movie file to have been encoded with the same parameters as the bad one. If it's a torrented movie, they sometimes come with an included sample of small file size. \n\nGet a program called \"Dumpster\" from Apple. If you've got a Windows machine you can only get an older/legacy version AND you'll have to register with their \"Developers\" group first. The Mac version is much easier to get and is much more recently updated...\n  This app will \"dump\" the resource/structure of the various types that are used in a .MOV file. Things like the MooV container itself, headers for the kinds of streams included in the container, then the metadata for each stream, then the actual contents of each stream (usually packetized into regularly-spaced sections).\n  Get to know the structure on very familiar terms, including the usual placement/order and length of each of these things. Use KNOWN GOOD files with predictable material in them as examples (and also for boilerplate for later).\nAt the same time, get a good HEX Editor application so you can see the direct binary/hex code in the file, unobstructed by its \"formatting\".\n  Look at the SAME GOOD file in both apps and familiarize yourself with how the \"atoms\" are placed. Sooner or later, you'll be able to recognize the hexcode signature of a particular setting or attribute, as well as get an understanding of the relationship between the various packet lengths and the notation used to describe them. This will come in handy when you need to add dummy/filler for a bad section.\nNow, try the BAD file in Dumpster. If you're lucky, it'll at least open without too much fuss and you'll be able to see SOME settings, etc. Map those to their placement in the file as seen by the hex editor (which will open ANYTHING--good or bad). Once you've eliminated the GOOD, you will have narrowed down the BAD and you be able to do a trial and error of various settings, etc. Plus you can copy and paste (from another instance of HEX editor using a good dummy file) to use as \"backfill/padding\" of the bad file so that it MAINTAINS THE SAME LENGTH, and DOESN'T INCLUDE BAD DESCRIPTORS (especially as regards placement and length of the streams).\nAfter a while, you should have a playable file---with some hiccups. This can then be used as a source file in a converter/editor so you can finally be left with a regular file that only has the good stuff.\n\nSource: http://forum.videohelp.com/threads/275665-Trying-to-fix-a-mov-that-was-corrupted-after-using-undelete-software\n\nA: My solution is to use MP4Box to demux the broken .mov or .mp4 file into its separate audio and video tracks, and then remux them using MKVToolnix. The remuxing appears to fix the atom problem, and the resultant MKV will be playable in QuickTime Player (assuming you have Perian installed), and can also be rewrapped as a QT .mov.\nI have just needed to do this, and MKVToolnix reported the following warning for the video track: \"This file contains at least one frame with a negative timecode. All timecodes will be adjusted by 00:30:44.726 so that none is negative anymore.\" I suspect that's what was causing the public atom error.\n", "Q: Creating a Backup of a Mac hard drive that won't boot?

It will skip over the things it can't transfer and keep going. With a bad volume like yours, this may be your best bet.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Based on the steps you've taken so far, I'd consider the likelihood of restoring this drive to be low. That is not to say you absolutely will not be able to reformat and reuse the drive, but that putting back in it's original state seems questionable. Data recovery is the next step.\nCopy the data from the drive, particularly the User Data using any means you're comfortable with. Matt's suggestion of rsync is valid, but I'd consider SuperDuper!, Carbon Copy Cloner or even good old fashioned drag-n-drop from the Finder to be alternatives. If the mass-copy schemes fail, dragging the data one folder at a time, or performing the equivalent operation using the terminal, may become your a necessary step. If that fails, you may have to resort to extraordinary measures like Data Rescue 3.\nYou may even get very lucky and find that a clone of the drive made using SD or CCC will boot the machine. I'd be suspicious of that drive as my primary boot volume, but I've seen it happen.\nIf the data is important to you, I would consider using multiple methods of of recovery just to be safe. Do a SuperDuper \"clone\" and a simple file copy to different volumes.\nIf recovering this drive is extremely important to you, I'd have a go at it using Diskwarrior. It's a tool I've seldom used in recent years, but there was a point when it was an indispensable part of my toolkit, and if your problem is a result of file system corruption, there is a reasonable change that DW will save your bacon.\nFinally, not to scold you, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention this for future readers, a good backup system makes emergency recovery processes like these for the most part unnecessary.\n", "Q: How to get rid of a widget stuck on the desktop instead of the dashboard? A long time ago I installed the Art Directors Toolkit widget. Today, when I restarted my computer after a power outage, there were 2 instances of the widget. The first one is in the dashboard and a second appears on the desktop, like any other application would appear. I don't know how to remove it. It has none of the usual dashboard buttons and it reappears if I relaunch the Dock.\n\nA: Apple allows widgets to be displayed on the desktop in order to allow the people developing the widgets to test them without using Dashboard. Your system must have had that capability turned on somehow and that widget set to run on your desktop.\nIt's very easy to get the widget off of your desktop, and make it so that no other widgets will accidentally be relocated.\nTo get the widget off your desktop: click and hold on the widget, then press F12 to enter Dashboard. Once Dashboard is active, release the mouse from the widget. The widget is now docked in your Dashboard instead of on your desktop.\nYou'll probably have two copies of the widget in Dashboard now. You can get rid of one in the normal way (press the plus button at the bottom left and click the (x) on the widget).\nYou can also just hold down the option key over the widget and the (x) will appear.\nNow, to prevent other widgets from escaping Dashboard in the future:\nOpen Terminal (/Applications/Utilities). Paste this in and press enter:\ndefaults write com.apple.dashboard devmode NO\n\n\nIf, on the other hand, you want to run some widgets on your desktop, you can run the above command with YES instead of NO.\nThen, activate Dashboard, click and hold on a widget, exit Dashboard, and release the widget.\n", "Q: Connecting to the Internet with an iPad or iPod Touch, via public wifi I was thrilled when the cafe at our local sport center started to provide free wifi.

The staff do not think they have changed anything. What could be happening, or what could be different? Is there anything I can do about it?\n\nA: When your iOS device doesn't get an IP address from the router that will route packets to web sites like www.apple.com or some of the other under the hood servers like the iCloud servers and APN (Apple Push Notification) servers it will let you know it's not connected to the internet.\nIn this case, it's almost always a problem with the wireless router or the internet service in the shop. Even if other people are surfing, the router could be out of new addresses and need a reboot. If no-one in the shop has access, then the causes could be lots of other things and not a temporary outage of DHCP addresses.\n", "Q: Prevent OS X from switching my keyboard layout when password fields are focused Some months ago, I switched to the Colemak keyboard layout, which is mostly great. But, there is one annoyance that is imposed by OS X.\nWhen the OS pops up a confirmation dialog to ask me to type my password in order to authorize an app for higher privileges, the OS switches my keyboard layout back to QWERTY whenever the password field of this dialog is focused. Not only that, but the OS prevents me from changing the layout back as long as that field has focus.\nNow, I am perfectly able to type my password on the Colemak keyboard. In fact, I'm much better at it now than I am at typing it on QWERTY. I want this behavior to stop. Unfortunately, I can find no setting for this, neither in system preferences nor in a defaults read dump. But just because I can't find it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Does anyone know how to fix this?\nI'm running OS X 10.7.2 on a MacBookPro 3,1.\n\nA: Put the .keylayout in /Library/Keyboard Layouts/ instead of ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/.\n", "Q: How can I figure out which keychain entries a process wants access to I'm getting really tired of seeing this:\n\nAs I understand it, ubd (the Ubiquity daemon) is responsible for the “Documents and Data” portion of iCloud's syncing. However, all of my iCloud-related data are in a separate, non-locking keychain.\nHow can I tell which keychain entries a particular process is trying to access? Failing that general case, does anybody know which keys specifically ubd needs access to?\n\nA: First with any Keychain question/problem, run Keychain First Aid, found under the Keychain Access menu. \nIt is to be hoped you also check the option to Show Keychain Access in menubar, for quick access to all.\n\nA: What you could do (but will take some time) is to check each keychain item and see which ones have allowed \"ubd\" to have access to (on the Access Control tab, while viewing a Keychain item).\nAlso make sure that \"Confirm before allowing access\" is selected. After that, you can just unlock the keychain and you will get a \"ubd\" wants to access the entry ... in your keychain.\n\nA: This is just a first level warning that the process UBD wishes a look inside keychain for something. At that point you have to go inside that keychain and check that all of the items do not let that process automatically or always access the contents(one by one for each item in the keychain). The tool for this looking is Keychain Access. \nWhat you verified the things in the keychain are set properly you can go ahead and allow the opening of the keychain and it will then be able to just examine what is inside that keychain file by name.\nIn this case everything seems \"on the up and up\" because the ubiquity demon would quite reasonably want to look inside that keychain file just to see if you could be storing an iCloud account credentials. It doesn't mean it would get to read the password or anything encrypted about that iCloud account, it's just checking to see if an iCloud account could be stored in there.\n", "Q: How can I easily add a batch of files to the HandBrake queue? How do I add multiple files into the queue at once in HandBrake?\nI heard that multiple files can be added to the queue by selecting the folder. But when I select the folder as source, only the first file is added, rather than all the files.\nAm I missing something?\n\nA: After adding the folder as the source, File>Add All Titles To Queue\n\nA: I've wondered about automating HandBrake using the command line interface (CLI) and Automator. Here's a tutorial that covers lots of details of using the CLI, though I think it only processes one file at a time, rather than building a queue:\nhttp://www.mactalk.com.au/18/87490-guide-convert-movies-ipod-format-one-click-finder.html\nWhile looking for a solution to answer this question, I came upon a thread about using Hazel (instead of Automator - not free):\nhttp://www.noodlesoft.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=859&p=3356#p3356\nFor the amount of labor I go through when converting videos, I'm considering giving this a try since it can help with other tasks such as copying to iTunes and my NAS.\nFor reference, here's a link to HandBrake's CLI Guide:\nhttps://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/CLIGuide\n\nA: Here's your answer. It's a Handbrake add-on for Automator.\nDownload the most recent zip, open it, double-click on the automator action to add the Handbrake action to Automator.\n\nA: If you want more control over the HandBrake/Automator integration, I wrote a blog post covering a custom Service I made with Automator that uses AppleScript to talk to the CLI.\nhttp://dovfrankel.com/post/37269517618/using-handbrake-on-a-list-of-files\n\nA: The Mac OS version has no explicit \"open folder\" option, however, you can still open a folder and process the content in batch mode.\nClick the button \"Open Source\" and...\nif you are inside the folder you want to process, \"do not select any file\", just click the open button.\nOR\nSelect the folder to process and then click open.\n\nA: The only way to set up multiple files for processing is to use the 'Add to Queue' button (or the ⌘B shortcut) in Handbrake.\nThis is by design as Handbrake requires you specify a destination folder and file name for the converted video file. If you were able to add all files in a folder, how would Handbrake know the unique output location and name for each rendered file? It doesn't make any guesses about those things, it requires the user to specify them for each render.\nOnce you've staged each file in the queue you can use the Start button (or the ⌘S shortcut) to tell Handbrake to begin processing the queue.\n", "Q: How do I move an application from Launchpad into Applications folder? I purchased Pixelmator 2 from the Mac App store. The app appeared in Launchpad, but not in my applications folder. The problem is that I don't use Launchpad.\nI can't find where Pixelmator is actually installed on my hard disk, and I want to move it into my applications folder.\nHow do I move it from Launchpad to the Applications folder?\n\nA: You could do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Activate Launchpad\n\n*Launch the application\n\n*Click and hold the application's dock icon\n\n*In the Options menu, choose \"Show in Finder\"\n\n*Move the application to the desired destination\n\n", "Q: How can I view (offline) the full English Wikipedia on OS X?

However, I can't figure out how to view this downloaded torrent within Okawix, so I'm not sure what I can do.\nWhat is the best way to do this? Is there software to download and view Wikipedia?\n\nA: It's not clear how you want to use the data once it's on your mac.\nTo narrow this down a bit, you can refer to the page that wikipedia has made to guide people like you that want to get a local copy of content and actually use it.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download\nPay particular attention to the sections:\n\n\n*\n\n*Help importing dumps into MySQL\n\n*Static HTML tree dumps\n\n*Dynamic HTML generation from a local XML database dump\nThe first option has you loading the dumps into your own database and is the most powerful, but means you will be running your own web server / database - your own little copy of wikipedia on your mac. The second two are guides to simply opening the dumped files in a web browser or other program that can render HTML and follow the links to files that rest on your mac's file system.\n", "Q: Does Notational Velocity/nvALT securely sync with Simplenote? I set nvALT to use a single database to store my notes. Using a database provides the benefit of encryption. I also sync my notes using Simplenote.\nI just noticed this warning at the bottom of the synchronization settings window: \n\nNote contents will be delivered in clear text.\n\nThis came as a bit of a shock because I have personal sensitive information stored in nvALT.\nI searched for the syncing APIs of Simplenote which seem to use HTTPS but I'm not sure about that. Can anyone explain how the synchronization works exactly and what the warning message means?\n\nA: The Notational Velocity FAQ appears contradictory:\n\nHow does encryption work in conjunction with Simplenote?\nIf database encryption is enabled under Preferences > Notes > Security, then your notes will be encrypted on disk. However, they will still be sent to Simplenote without encryption. (And obviously Notational Velocity will always use SSL regardless.)\n\nIt seems to say that the encrypted DB will be decrypted and then re-encrypted with SSL. So Simplenote will be able to see your notes after they receive and decrypt, but an eavesdropper would not.\n", "Q: Case-insensitive ls sorting in Mac OSX How can I make the ls command in Max OS X Lion sort files and directories similar to how Ubuntu Linux does (case-insensitive, directories NOT on top, dot files NOT on top)?  Ideally I'd like to do this without piping output to another command such as sort.\nFor example, I want to see:\nfoo\nFoobar\nMyStuff/\n.stuff/\ntest.txt\n\ninstead of:\n.stuff\nFoobar\nMyStuff/\nfoo\ntest.txt\n\nIn Linux, ls sort order is controlled by the system's locale, specifically LC_COLLATE.  When LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8, ls will sort items like I want.  When LC_COLLATE=C, ls will sort similar to OS X.\nLC_COLLATE is set to en_US.UTF-8 in OS X, but ls still sorts the old POSIX way.  Does anyone know how I can make this behave more like Linux?\n\nA: This has been bugging me for awhile now, and I finally got it sorted (heh). After trying a bunch of suggestions that didn't work, here's what did.\nIf you're willing to install MacPorts (or Homebrew, or Fink), the GNU version of ls does exactly what you want. I use MacPorts, myself, so that's the approach I'll explain:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and install MacPorts:\nhttp://www.macports.org\n\n*Install the GNU Coreutils package:\nsudo port install coreutils\n\n*You should now have GNU ls: gls. Try it in a directory that contains items that start with both uppercase and lowercase letters:\ngls -U\n(The -U option actually means \"unsorted\", but on OS X that has the desired effect of making it case insensitive.)\n\n*Add this alias in your .bash_profile so the regular ls will work the way you want it to (I like the color output, but you can omit that if you want; you only need the -U):\nalias ls='gls -U --color'\nNote that the -U option probably won't work on other platforms. In OS X, it always seems to do the right thing (maybe because HFS+ is effectively case-insensitive -- \"case-aware\", technically), but if you try it on a Linux box, the results will most likely just not be sorted at all.\n\nA: Update as of Aug 1, 2021:\nls -alFG\n\nExplanations:\n-a      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (.).\n-l      (The lowercase letter ``ell''.)  List in long format.  (See below.)  A total sum for all the file sizes is output on a line before the long\n        listing.\n-F      Display a slash (`/') immediately after each pathname that is a directory, an asterisk (`*') after each that is executable, an at sign (`@')\n        after each symbolic link, an equals sign (`=') after each socket, a percent sign (`%') after each whiteout, and a vertical bar (`|') after\n        each that is a FIFO.\n-G      Enable colorized output.  This option is equivalent to defining CLICOLOR in the environment.  (See below.)\n\nOld:\nI know this has been answered but this work best for me:\nls -f1 -alFG\n\nIt lists all details and sorts them by ignoring case.\n\nA: Adding to  Mike's answer, I've taken it a bit further and found a way to define your own collation rules.\nThe locale definitions are located in /usr/share/locale/. Each folder is a locale and has a file (or a link) LC_COLLATE, which defines which symbols are \"same\" (for example, that U, u and ü should be considered the same when ordering). You can duplicate a directory and this will create a new locale definition:\n$ sudo cp -R en_GB.UTF-8/ en_GB.UTF-8-CI/\n\nNow you'll have a new locale called 'en_GB.UTF-8-CI' ('CI' for case-insensitive) and you can use LC_COLLATE from there.\nNow, to change LC_COLLATE in the new locale you can download the locale sources from\nhttp://www.opensource.apple.com/source/adv_cmds/adv_cmds-119/usr-share-locale.tproj/colldef/, edit the one that's closest to what you want and run\n$ colldef < <new collation file>\n$ sudo cp LC_COLLATE /usr/share/locale/en_GB.UTF-8-CI/\n\nand now when you run\n$ LC_COLLATE=en_GB.UTF-8-CI ls\n\nyou will have sorting according to your rules.\nYes, this is what it takes to make 'ls' sort case-insensitive.\n\nA: It might not be possible: \n\nTaking a look at the source code for ls, it uses strcoll to sort\n  the filenames, and so should respect LC_COLLATE.\nSome postings online suggest that the locales in BSD (and Darwin/OS X)\n  are somewhat broken compared to those in Linux. I wrote a quick\n  sorting program of my own which explicitly set it's locale and tested\n  it using both the en_US.UTF-8 and C locales on my machine (Mac OS\n  10.6.3) and a university machine (Linux, FC11?). While sorting works as expected on the linux machine, (\"a B c\" vs \"B a c\"), the mac always\n  sorts them as \"B a c\".\n\nSource: http://ask.metafilter.com/130292/CaseInsensitive-LS-on-Mac-OS-X\nORIGINAL ANSWER\nThis command does not sort dot files, but shows additional directory listings\nls -f1 \n\nI got close to this: \n.\n..\n.stuff\nfoo\nFoobar\nMyStuff\ntest.txt\n\n\nA: As a workaround you can use a function and an alias:\nfunction lssorted() { /bin/ls \"$@\" | sort -f ;}\nalias ls='lssorted'\n\nThis produces a case insensitively sorted output for the standard ls command.\n\nA: ls is sorting according to LC_COLLATE, it's just that most all of the LC_COLLATE files are set to do case sensitive sorting.\nhttp://collation-charts.org/fbsd54/\nThere are two that are set for case insensitive sorting:\ncs_CZ.ISO8859-2 and et_EE.ISO8859-15\net_EE.ISO8859.15 doesn't sort \"Z\" the way english speakers would want.\ncs.CZ.ISO8859-15 does a good job with the alphabet, I just wish it would sort \"~\" before alphabetic characters.\nMy solution is:\nLC_COLLATE=cs_CZ.ISO8859-2 /bin/ls -FG\nI wonder if a custom LC_COLLATE file could be made to handle \".\" the way you want and \"~\" the way I want.\n\nA: Inspired by Mike's answer, I added the following to /etc/bashrc, and it works beautifully in Mojave. It lists hidden files at the end, but that doesn't bother me.\nexport LC_COLLATE=\"cs_CZ.ISO8859-2\"; alias ls='ls -AlhF'\n\nYou can see the new configuration by running the locale command. To revert, just remove the line from /etc/bashrc and log back into terminal.\n$ locale\nLANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_COLLATE=\"cs_CZ.ISO8859-2\"\nLC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MESSAGES=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_ALL=\n\nNote that neither ls -f1 nor ls -f worked for me in Mojave. I ended up with a truly unsorted list. Only the solution I have provided worked for me in Mojave.\nUPDATE: Per user1561489's suggestion in comments, I had success with the following more efficient line placed in the /etc/bashrc file.\nalias ls=\"LC_COLLATE=cs_CZ.ISO8859-2 ls -AlhF\"\n\n\nA: Using\nls -f\n\nworks for me.\n-f officially switches off any sorting, but it looks like then the original HFS sort shines through, which is exactly a case-insensitive sort. \nI guess, it actually depends on whether you have your HD formated case-sensitive or not, but as case-INsensitive HFS format is the default for Mac OS X system disks, this should work for the majority of users.\n\nA: Run:\n$ type ls\n\nYou'll probably find that your ls command is aliased.\n\nA: If you are mainly concerned with the sort order of the dot files, you can sort by extension: Use the ls command from the GNU Fileutils with the option --sort=extension.

Just say yes.\n", "Q: Why is Skype using 100% of my CPU or more and how can I fix it?  Today I used the Mac version of Skype for the first time on my new MacBook Air 11\" running Lion  - v10.7.2. \nTo my surprise, the process was using more than 100% CPU, the CPU temperature went high, as expected, and the fan went wild! Even more, the battery went from full to critical after just one hour of the video call.\nJust now, I opened Skype to get the version number - v5.3.60.1093 - with no active chats nor calls, the CPU usage went to 135.9% in the blink of an eye!\nThis issue seems to be all over the Skype forums, but I can't seem to find a solution.\nIf anybody can lead me towards a viable fix, I'd be grateful!\n\nA: I found this fix on a Skype community thread:\n\nQuit Skype, then in your home directory, look for a folder called Library/Caches/com.skype.skype and delete or rename that folder then start Skype... cpu usage should be back to normal.\n\nIf you can't find that folder, open your Terminal and simply type:\n$ open ~/Library/Caches/com.skype.skype\n\n\nA: The issue exists with all 5.x and 6.x versions. However if you downgrade to version 2.8, CPU usage will be normal (3.5% with 2.8 version vs 149% with 6.x versions). The only problem is that video chats will not work any more. But if you do not use those, it is not a problem.\nI keep 6.x version for video chats and 2.8 for all-day running. So if somebody asks me for a video call, I just ask them to wait until I restart skype.\n", "Q: Is there a Mac diagnostics utility for troubleshooting hardware issues? Is there software that helps identify problems, issues, conflicts, etc. with the hardware of a Mac?\nI came across Tech Tool Deluxe, which was apparently used in Applecare. Wondering if there was any other hardware diagnostics tool out there.\n\nA: Looks like Apple Hardware Test is a possible solution. Might need some elbow grease to get it to work on OS X Lion.\n", "Q: How can I disable the iPhone's microphone? I would like to disable the internal microphone for everything. My device is jailbroken and I have tried 'Disable Microphone' in MyRepoSpace, however that just gets rid of the Voice Memos app instead of actually disabling the microphone.\nIs there a way to disable the microphone, such as deleting the drivers? Or do I have to physically break it?\nDeleting mediaserverd from launchdaemons removes all audio and recording. However, it also makes the device hang for several seconds when something tries to play audio.\n\nA: If security is a major concern, I'd assume that a software hack is not the solution. There still is a chance of malicious software importing code which re-enables the audio functionality. \nI read NSA guidelines for Mac OS X 10.6 about disabling iSight on Macs where is was recommened to physically remove the webcam for absolute security.\nIf you do not want to physically remove your iPhone's microphone, I would try to distort the audio as good as possible - that would leave a spy with imprecise mumbling noises. The iPhone 4 can be muted quite effectively by just closing the hole at the bottom. There is a good chance that closing the hole of the microphone has the same effect. You could apply prestik or hot glue for example.\n\n\nA: Poke the mic with a needle a few times and it's disabled physically if your concern is security related... tinkering in software will not help you, even if you could remove the drivers or anything. If an attacker would get control of the device to listen to a microphone stream he will probably also be able to replace said driver.\n\nA: This is a long shot, but it might fool the iPhone into thinking that it doesn't need the internal mic.\nGet ahold of a 2.5mm cable microphone (I had one way back when for my Minidisk player, they're probably still on sale and very cheap) and cut it off, leaving you with only the plug and if needed, something to remove it with. \nBecause it doesn't have any earphone capability, this will not cause the iPhone to output sound through it (so you still have a fully functional iPhone) but with any luck it'll see a mic input, and turn off its own. Whether this will disable the ambient noise sensor, though, I don't know. \n\nA: How about connecting a iPhone headset with a broken/disabled/muted microphone? The phone should detect that a headset is connected and will disable the built-in microphone in the phone, but won't be able to get any signal from the headset.\n\nA: I have a pair of Bose QC 15 noise canceling headphones.  They have a switch for the noise-canceling feature which also kills the sound output in the cups.  The microphone will work though regardless of whether the switch is on or not.  This headset has excellent background noise muting however.  I just recorded something with the refrigerator defroster going in the background.  The headset mic muted out about 90% of the background noise.\n\nA: You don't have to physically break your phone microphone. If you are already in there you might be able to simply unplug it and that would be a lot faster than deleting various kexts of iOS. \n\nA: I had some tiny furniture pads, (the kind you use to put on the cabinet doors so that they don't bang.)  I placed them one the two mics on the bottom of my iphone 4.  I tested it by recording audio.  It works pretty good at first, but then the adhesive breaks down.  I'm going to try the ear piece method next.\n\nA: Just cut the plug off an old iPhone headset and plug it in internal mic is mechanically disabled. You want to use it unplug it.  You don't want earphones either because they can be used as mics.\n", "Q: How do I sync Safari's Reading List between multiple Macs and an iPhone? I would like for Reading List to automatically sync between an iMac, MacBook Air, and an iPhone 4S.  The Macs are both running Lion 10.7.2 and the iPhone is running iOS 5.0.  All three devices are signed into the same iCloud account and have 'Bookmarks' checked.  It appears that some syncing has occurred at some point between them, but it hasn't seemed to be working lately.\n\nA: Sometimes this can be caused by temporary issues with your account or the connection to the iCloud servers. Waiting it out isn't a bad strategy if you don't want to go for official support or when restarting the affected devices is not effective at clearing up the issue.\nFor ongoing issues, you might reach out to iCloud support to ensure it's not an issue with your setup or account.\n\nA: This might be an issue with Apple ID password requirements. Does your 8 character Apple ID password include at least 1 number and 1 capital letter? If it doesn't, try setting a new compliant password to see if this fixes the iCloud problem.\n", "Q: How do I stop Apache from starting up automatically? I'm running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2 and Web Sharing is turned off in System Prefs.\nI don't think this is specifically related to Lion.\nBasically, I'm a frontend developer and there are always backend developers messing around in my terminal trying to make my life easier, but not explaining exactly what they're doing. So I suspect someone put something somewhere to explicitly command my Mac to start Apache automatically on startup. Here's all I know:\nps aux | grep apache\n\nshows that Apache is running\nlaunchctl list\n\ndoesn't show Apache afaik, but if it did I wouldn't know what it would be called anyway\nsudo apachectl stop\n\nreturns launchctl: Error unloading: org.apache.httpd\nsudo apachectl -k stop\n\nreturns httpd (no pid file) not running\nAny advice would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\nA: Are you sure that it is apache you are seeing running. When you do the \nps aux|grep apache\n\nYou will see one process ( the shell process that is looking for the string apache)\nA running apache server is not called apache it is called httpd, and you will see multiple instances of this (one parent daemon which in turn spawns workers). The apachectl  is reporting correctly that it is not running\n\nA: Apache is part of the Mac OS is is always running (if you have set on websharing). That is, if you've not installed the specific software \"Apache\". But it's included in Mac OS and runs by default. \nSo is it causing any performance issues or is your work suffering from it? If not, let it be. It doesn't do any harm. If it does, try looking for a solution in this previous topic.\n", "Q: Why won't my MacBook Pro boot from a Linux Live CD? Whenever I try to boot up from a live cd, it starts to boot and then it tells me:\n\nNo bootable file system available.\n\nIt's an Early 2011 MacBook Pro 13\" 8,1 with the 2.3 GHz Core i5.\nWhat's going on? \n\nA: Macs use the EFI Firmware (BIOS for Windows).\nYou need to download a special Mac ISO that allows to boot on both BIOS and EFI Systems.\n\n\n*\n\n*For Ubuntu 11.10 you can download the specific Mac image here:\n64-bit Mac (AMD64) desktop CD\n\n\n*By experience I know that the following distros allow to boot on EFI systems using the \"standard\" ISO: Debian, Fedora, Linux Mint\n\n\nYour questions is related to this here on askubuntu.\n\nA: You'll probably want to take a look at rEFIt\nThat's how I booted and installed Linux on my Mac. It's a very nice piece of software.\n\nA: I installed the rEFIt on my late 2011 Macbook Pro and it messed up the whole startup and login. I never got refit screen after startup which should appear after a few restarts. The opposite, after a few restarts I was not able to login in on the startup screen. The password was still workin, so I could login into the computer using ssh on another computer. Weird. I finally solved it with TimeMachine. \nStay away from fEFIt if you're having the latest Macbook Pro with Lion. \n\nA: What other commenters have not made plain is that virtually all Linux live boot CDs presume that you'll be using them on a computer that uses BIOS (that's basically all PCs designed for Windows). BIOS (Basic Input-Output System) is computer software in the firmware of the motherboard itself that is the first thing to run at bootup of a PC.\nMacs do not use BIOS at all. They use a completely different method of booting the computer, called EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface).\nSo you need to see if your preferred distribution of Linux has a live boot CD that will work with EFI and not BIOS.\n", "Q: Is there a URL scheme for sending an SMS to multi-recipients? I just got quickpick from the app store, and of course I have it doing my basic call this person (tel://A), text this person(sms://B), but I would like to know, is there a URL scheme for SMS with multiple recipients? I've tried mms://A+B but it doesn't recognize mms:// as a command.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: If sms:// launches Messages (and it does), then you don't need an mms:// handler, because sms:// launches Messages but doesn't determine the message type. Simply tap the camera icon and choose the photo to send once Messages launches.\nProtocol handlers like tel:// and sms:// are just glorified urls, like http://www.askdifferent.com/, and they were not designed with multiple resources in mind. Resources being domains, files, etc. Note that you cannot request two files from within a single URL.\nExample: You cannot do something like: http://www.askdifferent.com/images/uploadedscreenshot1.png+uploadedscreenshot2.png\nI've attempted various delimiters for multiple recipients, such as %20, ,, |, +, and &, and none of them working. I would not be surprised if there is no way to specify multiple recipients via the sms:// protocol URI.\n", "Q: Moving and upgrading an iPhoto library A few months ago I had an external drive with my iPhoto Library for iPhoto 4 on it failed. I was able to recover everything from the drive successfully and continued using the iPhoto library in its new location. \nI've recently upgraded to a new computer and thought, I'd be able to just copy my iPhoto Library folder to the new computer, \"iPhoto '11\" do its upgrade and everything would work smoothly. That has not been the case. iPhoto wouldn't even open the library, so I tried using iPhoto Library Manager to rebuild the library. This helped to rebuild the library with about 1/3 of the photos, but couldn't find the rest because it was looking for them on the drive that had failed. I've tried rebuilding this on both the old and new computers with the same results. I have also tried modifying the AlbumData.xml file to reference the correct drive, but it still didn't find the photos. \nIs there anything else I can try to get my library transferred?\n\nA: I ended up hooking up the old drive again, and used iPhoto Library Manager to rebuild the library. It pulled the photos off the old drive and built a new library that appears to be working correctly. I'm not sure why I had to get the old drive involved, but it appears to have worked.\n", "Q: How can I limit the headphone max volume on OS X? So I hurt my ears from excessively loud music last week at work. I'm well aware of the volume down key of course, but I tend to crank it up too much throughout the day without noticing it.  \nI need a limiter and it needs to be system-wide, since I listen to various other sound sources aside from iTunes. This isn't really an issue on my phone, since I can set a volume limit in the iOS settings.\nIs there an equivalent built-in or third-party fix for OS X Lion?\n\nA: If you're not satisfied with the default audio settings of your Mac (I can increase or decrease the sound for my whole OS with one key), you can try Hear. It's an equalizer (and limiter) for the sounds your Mac is producing.\nIf you really want to limit your sound, I'm afraid there is no app for it right now. I found some other topics however where they asked the same question as you. Here and here. Basically, it comes down to \"use limited external speakers\" or \"be aware of your sound settings\" :)\n\nA: I now got a working solution based on one of the links in Michiel's answer, but let's spell it out more clearly.\nWhat I did was to \n\n\n*\n\n*Download volimiter, a faceless CLI application. \n\n*Pair it upp with Lingon, a launchdaemon manager.\n\n*Set volimiter to launch on login with preferred setting:\nvolimiter .6\n.6 means 60% of volume.\nWorks terrific!\n\nA: if your problem is still relevant, I created a little app called Earsafe. Basically, it's a status menu bar, which lets you limit the volume of the main output of your Mac.\nHope I could help!\n\nA: We've just released Volume Limiter for Mac, available on the AppStore as well as our website. (The web version offers a free trial). It has advanced capabilities, including limiting by audio device, locking controls for all users on a computer, and 'Mute Mode' (automatic muting based on system events or a user-defined calendar).\n\nA: If you're looking for a free solution, look no further:\nLimiting your Mac’s volume in 2019\nLimiting your Mac’s Volume in 2020, an Update\n", "Q: SSH connection to Mac works from the outside but not locally I configured SSH access to my Mac in order to use Prompt on my iPad. That way I can use my Mac from anywhere in the world, as long as I can get my home IP address.\nAlthough the SSH connection works fine from a separate external connection (my 3G iPhone, for example), it times out when I try to connect from a separate device on the same home wifi network.\nAs a result, I spent two whole days trying to debug a connection that actually works fine.\nWhy does an SSH connection that works fine from a separate external address time out when I try to connect from behind the same router?\nIs there a workaround so I can just use a single SSH setting whether I am in my living room or on a different continent?\nNote: a useful way to get your home IP address (if it's not fixed) is to log into your Gmail account from afar and look at \"Last account activity\" on the lower right corner of the screen.\n\nA: The router does the NAT on the external interface. However when you ssh to your WAN address the router will recognize packets coming in on on the internal interface as being sent to its own address and will just send them to its local port 22. What you want does exist but isn't often supported, it's called \"NAT loopback\".\nSee NAT Loopback Routers\n\nA: You might try using the bonjour address. \nssh Administrator@mymac.local\nObviously replace mymac.local with the bonjour address for the Mac in question.

I have an iMac, that has Internet access via Ethernet cable (no Wi-Fi).\nI know that my iMac has a Wi-Fi access point.\nHow can I share the iMac's Internet connection with an iPad?\n\nA: System Preferences -> Sharing -> Internet Sharing\nShare your connection from ethernet -> to computers using: Wi-Fi\nIn Wi-Fi options you can select a WEP password encryption for your network. \n\n\n", "Q: OSX 10.7 Apache can't do file uploads to local server I have Apache running on another machine on the local network but am unable to do certain things that I can on the live server - namely perform file uploads.\nWordpress tells me this may be because Apache doesn't have permissions to write to the website directories - does anyone know how to fix this?\nThe website folder is shared on the network also so I can't really go around chmoding it incase I break access for someone else.\nAny help appreciated\n\nA: You are having a directory permissions issue. You should ensure that the folder you are uploading to allows read/write/execute access for the web user (typically _www).\nIn practice, this means you should change the owner and/or group of the folder, or allow read/write/execute for all:\nchmod 777 /path/to/uploads\n\n", "Q: Add a new user with a specific uid and gid We have a mixed mac and linux environment at work, to make life easy we use the same uid, gid for each user both on the mac and linux side (I believe this is a standard practice).  \nThe problem is, when you add a new user on a mac, there is no way to set the uid and gid \"while\" you are creating it, so you need to add the user then set the uid/gid and then go and execute a few find ... -exec ...{} ... commands to change the owner and permissions on the home directory for the user that you already made, \nIs there a better solution for this?\n\nA: One solution would be to write a simple script to do the whole job at once.   \ndscl . -create /Users/ali UniqueID 549 PrimaryGroupID 320 RealName \"Ali Moeeny\" \n\nOr something like that.\n", "Q: Reasons to prefer Little Snitch over the built-in firewall Every now and then I browse through software you must have on your mac type lists and more often than not somebody mentions Little Snitch as a must-have application.\nNow what I think that many people ignore or aren’t aware of is that in fact OS X itself has an application firewall built-in (though hidden and the application layer inactivated).\nI understand that Little Snitch maybe allows for a more fine-grained selection of ports and one may exclude only specific addresses from the traffic per application. However, I wonder if this is really needed for the average (and better-than-average) type of desktop user.\nSo my question would be in which cases is the built-in firewall not sufficient and when would one have to choose an external tool like Little Snitch.\n(Note: I’m not speaking about controlling the traffic in a web or database server setup in which cases I thoroughly understand blocking certain connections whilst allowing only a small set.)\n\nA: Little Snitch offers three features that aren't available in MacOS' built-in ipfw firewall. (It does this by loading a custom kernel module.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Little Snitch allows you to block outgoing connections; the MacOS firewall only blocks incoming connections. Handy if you're running some untrusted program and aren't sure what it's going to do, or if you want to disable a program for updating itself, or if you want to prevent access to a specific resource. Also, I suspect many people use Little Snitch to block pirated software from checking their license.\n\n*Little Snitch lets you configure the firewall per application, not just address or port. Ie: you can configure it so one web browser can access a web site but not another.\n\n*Little Snitch also monitors network traffic on a per-application basis. It's easy on MacOS to see how much bandwidth you're using but much harder to see which program is using that bandwidth. The Little Snitch shows network usage for each application, albeit in a limited way. \n\n\nThat being said, I don't think Little Snitch is \"must have\" software; these features are fairly esoteric. There are also several alternatives: TCPBlock and glowworm for the firewall and Rubbernet (now defunct) for the monitoring.\n2016 Update: MacOS now has the per-application monitoring built into Activity Monitor.\n\nA: Basic differences\nThe basic task of the MacOSX Firewall is to monitor incoming network connections. HandsOff and LittleSnitch also allow to monitor outgoing network connections. The latter functionality is essential for various reasons like spyware and privacy.\nBecause LittleSnitch does not monitor incoming connections (unlike HandsOff!) it cannot replace the MacOX Firewall but is a companion to optimize network security.\nImportant features\nUnlike the MacOSX Firewall both programs offer a much higher degree of differentiation when defining rules to network traffic:\n\n*\n\n*Rules can be applied for a limited time (e.g. until applications quits, until reboot, forever)\n\n*Rules can block user defined (sub-)domains and ports for applications and processes\n\nYou basically define your own firewall step-by-step using such rules.\nBoth programs also include a network monitor that can show detailed information about your network traffic on the desktop.\nImportant to know\nKeep in mind that these programs do not offer 100% network security. Little Snitch cannot monitor software that uses it's own kernel-extension. Moreover, there is no implementation for a behavioral analysis of potentially malicious software.

I am using Mac OSX Lion Server that I just got on a new Mac Mini. This is my first apple desktop experience.\nHowever, I notice that when I want to create or rename a folder, I keep getting prompted for my admin password.\nIs there a way I can disable this?\n\nA: You are prompted for an administrator password when you attempt to create or modify a file or folder for which your user account does not have permission to modify. If this is happening within your home directory, it likely means that permissions are mis-set. You could fix this by running the program Disk Utility, selecting your startup drive, and clicking on the button reading Repair Disk Permissions.\n\nIf this is happening in a system folder, this is by design, to make it more difficult to break something. While it can be overridden (the simplest way would be at the terminal to type chmod a+w -R /, but this is highly unadvised) through changing permissions, I would suggest that this is a Bad Idea.\n", "Q: sync sent mail between iPhone and mail.app Can I set up my mac/iPhone/mobile me to sync the mails I've sent on my iPhone back to my mail.app on my mac?\nI use two email addresses: an IMAP (gmail) address and a microsoft exchange address.\nOn the other hand, I can't even see the mails I've sent on my iPhone in the mail app on the iPhone, it only shows mail.app sent mails.\n\nA: Solution for Gmail:\nGesendet must the the label of the mailbox that you use for sent mail on the iPhone. (info: gesendet is German for sent)\nI believe the default label is named Sent Messages created once you set up Gmail on your iPhone using IMAP.\n\n", "Q: Disable caps lock on backspace in iPhone My iPhone (3gs) has this behavior:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm typing a text and I put a certain letter in caps\n\n*I might decide the letter shouldn't be in caps so I press backspace (a couple of times if I've typed a lot after the capped letter).\n\n*when I do this, my iPhone remembers the letter was in caps and already puts on caps (the upward arrow is glowing).\n\n\nI don't want this (the last bullet). how can I disable it? I've checked the preferences and disabled settings -> general -> keyboard -> Auto-Capitalization and settings -> general -> keyboard -> Enable Caps Lock, yet to no avail.\n\nA: It happens because you hit caps before typing a letter, so what the iPhone is doing is rather deleting all the code associated with that letter, it deletes the letter leaving the code, so if you backspace again it removes all the code from that space and moves back another space.\nIf you backspace one step further it removes this formatting.\nThe settings you have changed do not relate to your issue.\nThe first is to capitalize proper nouns that grammatically require a capital (which I wish would happen on all applications) the second is to enable the locking of the caps key, which means if you tap it twice in quick succession it will lock in uppercase.\n", "Q: Call blocking for iPhone? How do I block unwanted callers without jailbreaking?\n\nA: A new feature of iOS 7 is call blocking and it allows the device to block calls apart from the previous solutions that involved jailbreaking or having the carrier block calls for you.\nGo to recent calls within the phone app. Tap on the \"i\" to the far right of the number you wish to block. On this info page, scroll down. At the bottom of the page, tap \"Block this Caller\". Confirm on the warning message. \nFrom the settings app, use iMessage and FaceTime preferences to manage the block list. \nThis list blocks calls, messages and FaceTime calls (audio and video) from that contact. Combined with a blocked contact as Loïc Wolff has proposed, you have a neat solution for dispatching unwanted calls on an ongoing basis.\n\n\nA: Before iOS 7, the only way to block callers is to create a \"Don't Answer\" contact and assign the numbers you want blocked to it.\nThat way, you'll know not to answer when those people call. You can also assign the contact a \"silent\" ringtone.\n\nA: If the number is still in your \"recent calls\" list, simply click on the circled \"i\" on the right of the number.  Scroll down to \"Block this Caller\" and then activate it  That simple.\n\nA: In iOS 7 caller blocking is supported by the OS. Unless I'm missing something here the number you want to block needs to be in your contact list. So to block a new number you still need to add a contact first which seems a bit backwards.\n", "Q: How can I control where photos end up when I sync them to my iPhone? I'm trying to have fewer photos on my iPhone (3GS running iOS5), and if possible to have them searchable by naming them.\nWith this in mind I used Image Capture to download all 500+ pictures onto my MacBook Air (running Lion), then synced my iPhone with iTunes to remove them all. \n(To do this, I made a folder called Empty Folder and put it in my Pictures folder, selected it in the iPhone's Photos tab in iTunes - you can't, for some no doubt magical Apple reason, select any folder that isn't a subfolder within another folder - and synced. Only way I could find to do it, other than wearing out my fingertip by deleting all the photos one by one. I couldn't see any way of deleting a whole 'album' of photos on the iPhone itself or in iTunes.)\nI then named all the photos I wanted to keep - 111 of them - and dragged them into another subfolder in Pictures, this one called iPhone Photos. \nI connected the phone again, and in iTunes and the phone's Photos tab I deselected Empty Folder and selected iPhone Photos. \nAll hunky dory. All 111 photos are now on the iPhone. \nExcept that there are now three albums on the phone: the empty Camera Roll, Photo Library with 111 photos, and iPhone Photos, with the same 111 photos, organised differently. \nWhat the...?\nIs there any way of getting the photos I want to keep into the Camera Roll and getting rid of the extra albums?\n\nA: To add pictures to the Camera Roll, you have to snap them with the built-in camera (or with a screenshot) on the iPhone.\nThe Photo Library contains all the pictures, they may be additionally organised in user-specific folders (like your iPhone Photos folder for instance).\n", "Q: iChat with Yahoo Messenger keeps prompting about the same buddy requests I have iChat set up with the Yahoo Messenger protocol. Every time I log in, or suspend/resume my machine, it prompts me to respond to the same 3 Yahoo Messenger buddy requests. I always hit \"decline\", dismissing the dialogs, but it doesn't seem to stick. Is there a way to fix this?\nThis is iChat v6.0.1, with Lion\n\nA: Sadly, the problem lays in the chat protocol between the Mac and Yahoo.\nThe only solution I've found is to log on with a Window's machine using the latest Y!M client and doing the decline/ignore there.\nI was up to 15 messages requests between my two acts every time I woke my Mac from sleep. Going to the Yahoo client on Windows cleared this up entirely.\n\nA: I also had the same sort of problem, but this time it was on a macbook pro and iMessage  that I kept getting a request (From oratoracallyshirley!) to be a \"buddy\". I went to my pc desktop, logged onto IE and my homepage (which is Yahoo), clicked on \"Mail\", then opened the \"chat\" button, clicked on oratoracallyshirley, deleted and blocked it, then went back to my macbook pro and Hey Presto, no \"requests for buddies\"!\n", "Q: iPhone can't play any music Hi all. I used to be able to play music with my iPhone but now I can't.\nI'm not sure what causes this problem, and I'm wondering if this is a hardware problem.\nI performed a clean factory restore, made sure the volume is maxed, but there's no sound at all. I've installed an alternate music player but there's still no sound (even though volume is maxed).\nDoes anyone know if there's anything else I can do to reset the phone besides the factory restore option in iTunes?\n\nA: Thanks for answering my questions.\nSo with no headphones plugged in you get no sound through the built-in speakers on your iPhone.\nBased on the screen shots you posted it looks like your phone thinks it's connected to a dock connection. That's jives with your \"sound in headphones, no sound from internal speakers\" answers to my questions.\nIt sounds very much like your dock connection at the bottom of the phone is not functioning correctly. It may just have some debris in it that's shorting out a few pins and making your iPhone think it's connected to a dock with a line-out on it, or it may be completely broken.\nTry cleaning out the dock connection jack on the bottom of the phone. You can blow in it with a dry air source, compressed air in a can is best, to see if you can dislodge any debris from it. You can also try plugging your dock connector in and out a few times to see if that clears it up.\nIf that doesn't work your best bet is to take it an Apple Repair Depot and have them look at it. The dock connection is made up of a lot of small terminal points and it's not hard to mess them up if you force a connector in the wrong way or smush some debris in there when plugging it in to charge.\n\nA: Press the sleep/wake button and the home button at the same time for 10 seconds to reset the music device.\n", "Q: How do I connect my PC to a Thunderbolt Display? \nPossible Duplicate:\nAre there adapters to use Thunderbolt Display with non-Thunderbolt computers? \n\nSo, I have a MacBook Air and a 27\" Thunderbolt display. I was under the impression that I could connect my PC (Asus Laptop) to the Thunderbolt display by using a HDMI to Mini Displayport converter. However, it doesn't seem to be working. Is there some technical limitation as to why this isn't working?\n\nA: Sorry, but currently it's not possible. Thunderbolt ports on Macs can output a Mini Displayport signal, but the Thunderbolt Display can only receive a Thunderbolt signal, nothing else. It's possible that an adapter to do this could be released in the future, but IMO that's unlikely or if it happens will be quite expensive.\n", "Q: macbook 13\" and the audio jack for sound input I've followed the instructions at this link to set the audio port for input, yet nothing changes as described in bullet 6.\nAny idea what I could try next?\n\nA: Ok,\nIt seem that the trick in the above link only works if a line in is actually connected. Which wasn't the case...\n", "Q: How can I find a list of games that are playable on my Mac? I'm a casual gamer with a MacBook Air (fall 2010 13\" model), I'd like to find some games that are playable on my Mac. Is there any software or website that makes it easy to find games with compatible system requirements?\nWhat I have in mind is something like the (now defunct) Aspyr Game Agent application, which at a glance showed whether a game's system requirements were compatible with a specific Mac; see the screenshots for one game, for a list of games, or read Softonic's review.\n\nA: Steam has a dedicated Mac section and also lets you filter by OS when searching. And it lists system requirements.\n", "Q: Are non-unibody MacBook Pros capable of Lion's 3 and 4 finger multi-touch gestures? Are non-unibody MacBook Pros (Late 2006 ~ Early 2008) capable of Lion's 3 and 4 finger multi-touch gestures?\n\nA: No - that era of hardware is a solid-state trackpad, not a multitouch trackpad and can only track one motion. Although it can guess fairly well if it's one finger or two that is moving in two dimensions (left-right and up-down), but that's all the hardware can tell. \nPut another way, yours tracks the center of all touch points combined, not several touches individually at the same time with their own motion.\n\nA: Yes - but only the very late ones, like 2008ish - at least my early 2008 MBP (last non-uniboby) supported all kinds of multi-touch gestures using bettertouchtool - didn't try Lion on it but in the last Snowleopard versions all the OS X multi-touch gestures also worked. \n\nA: No\nAlso notice the following:\n\n*\n\n*the trackpad is smaller\n\n*scrolling with inertia is not enabled!\n\nFix\nWhen connecting the external multitouch trackpad by Apple, all those features get enabled. They do run smooth.\n", "Q: Is it possible to disable Versions for all applications? I've never used Versions, and the extra step needed to Save as are enough reasons for me to downgrade to Snow Leopard.\nIs it possible to disable Versions in all apps and have a Save As… menu item instead of a Duplicate one?\n\nA: I guess you're rather referring to Autosave. This post describes the difference.\nTo disable Versions, I posted the (maybe risky) procedure here:\nHow to disable Versions in OS X Lion\nHowever for Autosave the easiest work-around might be to use \"System Preferences\" → \"Keyboard\" → \"Keyboard Shortcus\" to define a keyboard shortcut (I used  ⌘ ⇧ S) for the programs that have Autosave support and the \"Duplicate\" option in the menu:\n\nFor Textedit it will then look like this:\n\nSo you would press ⌘+⇧+S, which gives you a new duplicate window and then ⌘+S to save as new filename.\nHowever, you original document will also (continuously) be saved and end up in the state where you created the duplicate - and without Versions (or Time Machine) you won't be able to recover earlier states as soon as you close your original document or the program.\n", "Q: How to fix a hanging Logic Pro 9.1.5 on Snow Leopard? I'm using Logic Pro 9.1.5 on my MacBook Pro (2.4 Ghz CPU, 7200 RPM HDD). I have Snow Leopard.\nWhen I'm doing nothing special, working on my project, Logic sometimes freezes and I'm stuck with a 'spinning wheel of death' for hours.\nI uploaded a hang log file to see if someone can help me diagnose this and find a fix.\nHang log\n\nA: I looked at your hang log (also called a sample). I have some experience reading samples for Mac OS X apps, and with Logic Pro 8.

I just subscribed to iTunes Match and it's currently scanning my library.\nI've got a few tracks named as 'track 1', 'track 2', and 'unknown artist'. My plan is to clean up my library (some day). But will iTunes Match be able to rescan the new names of already matched songs?\nIn other words, will iTunes Match re-sync those songs already synced or will it only sync newly added songs?\n\nA: Yes. The iTunes Match Library icon shows up from time to time (I haven't figured out what the exact requirements are) and you can re-scan your library.\nOnce you changed your id3 data, select the songs, right-click and select \"Add to iCloud\". This initiates a re-scan in iTunes Match as well.\nIf you add music, it will by added to iCloud instantly.\n\nA: I just spent all day redoing all my album artwork and then I realised that it looks good on my Mac, but iTunes Match just doesn't \"match\". So after a lot of looking around, this is the best way to do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn iTunes Match on.\n\n*Command ⌘ + a (highlight all Albums) and Command ⌘ + Backspace ⌫ (delete).\n\n*When asked \"this will delete all blah blah blah..... check box \"delete from iCloud\".\n\n*NOW BE CAREFUL... select \"keep files\" THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!\n\n*it takes a while, then it all goes blank....and then more \"iCloud\" songs appear, Delete them too, same as step 3.\n\n*now you have an empty iTunes and an empty iCloud/iTunes Match!\n6a. Turn off iTunes Match!\n\n*go to import files, and select the iTunes folder, locate Music and select it.\n\n*and all your songs will return, some will have missing artwork, but they are the legit iTunes ones so just select \"get album artwork\".\n\n*the few that are not there just add them manually (i had 10 out of 4886 (not bad)\n\n*then go to \"Store\" and turn iMatch back on and it will rescan and re-upload as new.\n\n\nThis was the simplest way I found to do it.\n", "Q: Maintain business contacts database on Mac and iPhone? My wife organises amateur and semi-pro orchestras. She has a ‘database’ of about 600 musicians which she currently keeps in an OpenOffice spreadsheet on the Mac, with each player’s name, instrument(s), contact details, some notes, and a record of which concerts they have played in. She’d now like to have this accessible on her iPhone (4S). It would be nice to be able to edit it on the iPhone, but not essential; it needs to be easy to keep the two copies in sync; it would be great if it was easy to call/SMS someone’s number from the iPhone database, but she doesn’t really want to merge the database with her iPhone address book.\nI can think of a few different ways of solving this, for example:\n\n\n*\n\n*view the spreadsheet on the iPhone using Quickoffice or Documents to Go\n\n*move the spreadsheet to Numbers on the Mac and iPhone, syncing via iCloud\n\n*use some sort of business contacts manager app, maybe adding contacts to groups to define both instrument played and concerts played in\n\n*create some sort of custom solution using Bento on the Mac and iPhone\n\n\nI don’t have any of the above apps at the moment. Any advice on the ideas above, or any alternative suggestions please?\n\nA: Using Numbers would work as you say it syncs when ever a change is made. The benefit of this is that it is customised to your wifes needs, i.e the filed Name, Instrument, etc, ect are what she needs.\nUsing Office to go adds a few unnecessary steps to the procedure, with iCloud everything just syncs.\nIf she were to buy a database package it is not likely to contain all the correct fields she requires and would contain a lot more that would be useless, so a bit overkill really.\nHowever the benefit of having a database app like Bentois that all your contacts details are clickable on the app, so if she is looking for a bass player she will be able to search and then click the contact number to call them. However this has a much larger cost than just buying Numbers for iOS.\n", "Q: Where does System Preferences store the name of the Time Machine Destination I am trying to create a script to determine the destination of time machine on a number of computers I manage. It shows very clearly via Time Machine Settings in System Prefs. I need to be able to find that info via command line. \n\nA: The tmutil utility does exactly that, but I think it was only added in Lion.\nAs an added bonus, Apple doesn't document the tmutil argument you'll need, but I dug through the output of \"strings /usr/bin/tmutil\" and found this, which is what you're looking for:\n\ntmutil destinationinfo\n\nAlso, \"tmutil status\" will tell you if a backup is currently running. It's another undocumented command.\n\nA: In this link you can find the answer: https://superuser.com/questions/20887/in-what-preference-file-does-time-machine-store-the-backup-volume-name\n/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist\n", "Q: Previously activated iPhone 3GS I've just upgraded to an iPhone 4S, and I want to use my old 3GS like an iPod touch.

My basic use case is similar to the mirroring feature from iPad to Apple TV, except I'm seeking to mirror the device onto a Mac (as opposed to a TV). \nWhat I ultimately need to do is record the actions from a Mac (or PC if that works) that are taking place on an iOS device -- which includes opening the app store; so emulating is not an option. If anyone can think of a clever way to record what's happening on the iOS device, without pointing a camera at it, I'm all ears.\nIn case anyone comes across this, Quicktime's screen recording + Xcode's emulator should work under normal circumstances. My use case is just more demanding. \n\nA: Starting from iOS8 and Yosemite You can capture the screen of iOS device from Quicktime directly. Here's the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch to your Mac via a Lightning Cable.\n\n*Open the QuickTime app.\n\n*Go to File and select ‘New Movie Recording’.\n\n*A recording window will appear. You will a see little arrow for drop down menu in front of the record button. Click that arrow and select your iPhone.\n\n*Select the Mic of your iPhone if you want to record music, app/game sounds.\n\n*Click the Record button. Now perform the tasks on your iOS device that you want to record.\n\n*Once done tap the stop button and save the video.\n\n*Done!\n\n\n\nNOTE: works only with iOS8 and Yosemite and devices with Lightning Cable.\n\nAll steps taken from: ioshacker website. Enter there for screenshots.\n\nA: On iOS 11, screen recording is supported natively. Here is how to use it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings => Control Center and add the Screen Recording widget\n\n*Go to the home screen by pressing the home button (or swiping up on the home bar on an iPhone X)\n\n*Open the Control Center by swiping down from the top right corner of the screen\n\n*Tap the record screen widget (looks like the record button on a VCR)\n\n\nA: Connect your iPhone with a iPhone to VGA adaptor with a VGA Capture.  Untested.\n\nA: Cleanest way is probably to use AirServer. You just mirror to your PC/Mac and record the iOS device's screen to disk.\n1) it's wireless and \n2) Higher quality of recording than the QuickTime option on mac \n3) you can also livestream to YouTube so I thought it was good to add it as an option.\nI'm on mac and I choose to do this rather than using quicktime. QuickTime is also good though if you don't care about live streaming to YouTube or better quality for recording.\n\nA: The iPhone 4S and iPad 2 can do screen mirroring over HDMI with the Apple AV Adapter. With an HDMI capture card, you could record directly that way. But aside from that (or with hardware other than the 4S or iPad 2), you're probably out of luck if the iOS Simulator doesn't do what you need.\n\nA: Mateusz Szlosek answer works great. I'm answering to add an alternative. I record tons of iPad tutorials, and frequently use Pickle Studio (http://picklestud.io). Besides recording the iOS screen, Pickle Studio includes some extra features: you can include partial Mac screens and video camera. It's a bit simple, but works really well. It has some interesting filter options as well.\n\nA: iOS 11 now allows you to cleanly record your device screen complete with audio.\nIt will get saved to the Camera Roll where you can edit/trim it and send the final video to your computer.\n", "Q: Opening documents inside Dropbox iOS app I have installed drop box iOS app. It syncs with the documents that I have on the pc. Is there any way I can open a word/excel file inside the drop box app with a document editing app like Documents, iSpreadsheet etc inside my iPod touch?\nFor example, when I select Test1.xls in Drop box app, it should open in Documents free app. Is this possible?\n\nA: I don't think so. You would need the Documents application to build in support for pulling down documents from your dropbox account. Applications on the phone aren't really allowed to share data because of sandboxing.\n", "Q: Remap Top-Row Number Keys I've tried Ukulele and KeyRemap4MacBook. Neither does what I need to do.\nI want to map the top-row 4 key and the top-row 8 key to SHIFT. So that, for example, when I press 4 + g it types a capital G.\nHitting the shift key with my pinkie is aggravating my carpal tunnel. On my windows machine I just remapped 4 and 8 to shift and I use a keypad if I need numbers. Savior for my hands.\n\nA: Ukelele should be able to kind of do this by making 4 a \"deadkey\" that generates the uppercase letter for any key typed after it, unless there is a limit on the number of keys you can have in such a sequence.  (Just like alt + e is a deadkey that generates acute accented versions of any vowel typed after it)\nOf course this is not exactly like Shift, because you can't hold it down, you have let 4 go before you hit the next letter. \n\nA: I've done something similar with Karabiner Elements. Left and right shift are in the dropdown menu.\n\n(For the record, after doing this I remapped the Function keys to number keys, so that that functionality is not lost!  You get all the shifted symbols on the Function keys as well, e.g.,  Shift+f1 gives !)\n", "Q: How to disable iMessage on a broken iPhone? How can I disable iMessage for a phone number if the iPhone it's attached to has been destroyed? My sister dropped her iPhone in the bath, so she is now using an older non-Apple phone. Whenever I send her a message, it gets sent as an iMessage (and even says \"Delivered\"), but her device never receives the message.\nThe only information I could find was this Apple knowledge base article which states the following:\n\nIf you plan on transferring your SIM card or phone number from an iPhone to a device that does not support iMessage, turn off iMessage in Settings > Messages first. If you do not, other iOS devices may continue to try to send a message using iMessage first, instead only using SMS or MMS.\n\nHowever, since this iPhone was destroyed, we can't get into the settings to unregister her phone number.\n\nA: The simplest solution is to contact Apple Support (as this article makes clear) since they actually have engineers that can modify which devices and phone numbers are associated with your (or another's Apple ID).\n\nSo, just contact Apple Support.\n\n\nA: Try to log in to your iPhone with her Apple ID and turn off the settings for iMessage there. Worst case you need to insert her SIM card into your phone and do the changes.\n\nA: I ran into this same issue, not with a broken iPhone though. I have a Nexus 5 to replace my old iPhone 4. My wife's texts to me from her iPhone kept going as iMessages.\nI found this article that helped me solve the problem.\n\nNote: If you no longer have access to the iPhone that is using the number you want to remove, reset your Apple ID password.\n\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT5538\nWhat I did was disable facetime and iMessage on my phone (with no sim). Changed my apple ID password. After this texts worked again to me.\n\nA: Complete the form below to de-register from iMessage. It will send you an authorisation code via SMS to verify you own the phone number.\nhttps://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage\n\nA: Go to https://supportprofile.apple.com/MySupportProfile.do, log in with her Apple ID, click on Edit products and click on the \"x\" to the right of the iPhone.  Click Unregister.\n\nA: In time, that device will expire as a destination for messages but since the phone was physically destroyed by dropping in water, it's highly likely the \"delivered\" message is due to another Mac or iOS device being registered for iMessage as opposed to the server thinking it had sent a message to a working iPhone (when that iPhone no longer works).\n\n\n*\n\n*https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage\nYou could also get that SMS active on a new device and follow the deregistration confirmation process (or move your account to a new number)\n\nA: Changing your apple account password will fix this problem.  I just did it and it worked. \n\nA: *\n\n*Use a friends iPhone, go into Settings > iTunes and App Store\n\n*Sign out of their Apple ID and then sign into your Apple ID\n\n*Then go turn iMessage off under Settings > Messages\n\n*Sign out the same way and sign back into your friend's Apple ID\n\n*Turn iMessage back on in Settings and try to message yourself on their phone\n\n\nThis will fix the problem immediately.\n\nA: *\n\n*First get an iPhone that is iMessage compatible.\n\n*You will have to do a master reset (which erases everything) on this phone after, so make sure that this iPhone doesn't belong to somebody who cares about all of their stuff.\n\n*Then, take the existing SIM card out of the iPhone and sign in to your sister's iMessage account.\n\n*It is important that you do this with FaceTime so that the iPhone doesn't associate your sister's number with the account on that iPhone. \n\n*Put your sister's SIM card in the phone.\n\n*Turn iMessage and FaceTime off. \n\n*Take the SIM card out of the iPhone, and then go to Settings > General, scroll down to Reset. Tap Reset, and then tap Erase All Content and Settings. This should solve your problem right away.\n\n\nA: A bit of a lark here but I read on the Apple forums that resetting your Apple ID password will immediately cause the association between your old phone number and any iMessage account to timeout. (Sorry can't find the link...)\nThe non-lark part here is that I do know that this association does eventually timeout. I had two iPhones a few weeks ago each with their own working SIM and phone number. One of the phones got wiped and the SIM tossed. While the old phone number and associated iMessage address stayed around for a few days, it eventually disappeared.\nhttps://appleid.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyAppleId.woa/\n\nA: The only thing that worked for me was changing my AppleID to use a different email address. That resets something on their end, and the next day I started to get text messages again from people who were previously sending iMessages.\n\nA: The good and sure way of doing it is this:\nGo to your cellphone provider, for example, AT&T. Have them do a \"SIM Replacement\" on your new phone. You will have to provide your phone number and ID. They will switch the SIM card number linked to your account. Depending on the generosity of the store you go to, this will cost you 0-5$\n\nA: Find your sister in the Contacts in your iPhone.  Change her current mobile number from \"iPhone\" to \"Mobile\".   Let me know if this works!\n", "Q: \"Ineligible\" iCloud Songs on iOS devices I have some mp3's ripped from a language CD, \"Lesson 1\", \"Lesson 2\" and so forth. Some of them are uploaded to iCloud with iTunes Match, for some it says \"Ineligible\". I don't really need them in the cloud, but on my iOS devices. How do I get them there, as the music sync is disabled when iTunes Match is turned on?\n\nA: Most likely, they are ineligbile because the bit rate is less than 96kb so rerip them.  You don't have to do the originals, you can rerip the ones that are already in iTunes.  The audio quality doesn't change and the files are bigger but Match will accept the new ones.\n\nA: You don't need to re-import your audiobooks. Go to each track, right click, get info, options, and select audio book in the field \"support type\" (I am translating form spanish, I don't know the real name of the field in english).\n\nA: You can still sync audiobooks.\nWhat you will need to do (as a work around) is import the CD as an audiobook (instructions here) then when the device is connected to iTunes you can choose to sync audiobooks.\n", "Q: What's a recommended setup of accounts on Mac OS X? In Lion - on a one person per install setup - the user is admin by default. \n\nWould you recommended this setup?\n\nI thought that the default user should never be admin but have a restricted standard account instead.\nIf I change my account for the everyday use to standard and keep an extra admin account for maintenaince, what restrictions take place?\n\ne.g. Can I still install software as easily?\n\n\nA: All actions taken on a non admin account that would need admin privileges require the user to enter the name of an admin account and the password before continuing.\nSo if you download software on a standard user account, when you come to install it you will be asked to enter the admin user name and password.\nI use the admin account and my girlfriend has a standard user account. She can import music, photos download apps from the app store, she can change system preferences in the settings panel but not alter the status of my admin account, create accounts, etc, etc.\nI have not heard of this procedure of using a non admin account as to do anything that will change the system as you are required to enter the password anyway.\n\nA: Matt, your's is a good usage practice ;)\nTake a look at Rui Carmo's excelent Switch to the Mac Howto\nexcerpt:\n\nDon’t use the administration account for anything other than setting\nup the machine and applications or changing “permanent” settings (if\nyou want to, say, change network settings as a normal user you’ll be\nprompted for the admin password, and since you’ll do configuration\nchanges less and less often as time progresses, this isn’t a problem).\n\nIf you want install some opensource tools use Homebrew instead of Macports or Fink\n\nA: I have a separate admin account that I only use for installing and updating applications and the OS, and making other system configuration changes that require it.  My day-to-day account does not have admin rights.  The two accounts have different passwords.  I never type my admin password to change things from my user account.\nThis extra step (having to switch to the admin account when necessary) makes it far less likely that some typo, sleep deprivation, or accidental click will even try to change some system setting, file or install some unwanted code.  I am far more careful about everything I do when logged into the admin account, as there are many more ways to make your OS crash and you Mac unbootable when logged in as an admin.\nBut when needed (and when you are awake enough for the extra step), it's easy to log into the admin account to install stuff.\n", "Q: Do iWork applications now iOS support versioning? The current iWork on Lion supports autosave and versions. Is the same true for the iOS versions of these applications? I need versioning support for my documents on iOS devices.\n\nA: Version support is not found in iWork it is actually a part of OSX Lion. There is no version support built into iOS. (yet)\n", "Q: How do I move pictures and videos from one iPad to another? How do I transfer photos and videos between iPad and iPad 2?\n\nA: This depends, do you have iCloud? as you can sync through iCloud. \nYou can also configure all the settings in iTunes. So you can import all the images into iTunes, once they are there you can connect the other iPad and sync them.\nIf you do not want to keep the iPad 1, you can just connect it to iTunes, sync it and then connect the iPad 2 and restore it from the back up of the 1st iPad.\n\nA: The original question doesn't have enough detail to really offer a solution here. But to clarify previous answers, the fastest way to transfer photos and videos between an iPad and an iPad 2 would be to sync to a single installation of iTunes/iPhoto/Aperture. \nA slower but simpler way would be to run Dropbox on the iPad, click on the UPLOAD tab at the bottom of the page, and upload all the photos and videos to the Dropbox. On the iPad 2, reverse the process and download all the photos back. \nIf you're only talking about a few photos and you don't want to do anything outside of the Photos app, you could simply email the photos to yourself from the iPad and save them to your photo library (via the Mail app) on the iPad 2.\nI suspect all three answers sound simplistic, but it's hard to know what you're trying to achieve and where you're getting stuck.\n\nA: Use an iPad Transfer software such as iPad-to-iPad to transfer videos, music, photos and file folders from iPad to iPad for backup or sharing with your friends. \nThis software comes in two versions, a Standard version for $29 USD and a Platinum version for $45 USD, unfortunately this software is Windows only.\nBoth versions have the following functionality:\n\nTransfer files between iOS devices\nThis professional iPad Transfer allows users to transfer iPad files to other iPad device and even iPhone/iPod.\n\n\nA: No additional computer or \"Cloud\" necessary!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ofUkg9Eb8s\nworks brilliantly if you have a Camera Connection Kit (non-Apple one may even do)\nYou may need to reset the target iPad (press Home & Power button) to get it to highlight \"import\".\nRemember that your charging lead goes from the source iPad & CCK into the target iPad.

For example, on High Sierra (10.13) it crashes immediately.\nIt may be that our only option are apps like PopChar X at this point.  \nI don't even think I'm happy with PopChar as it doesn't seem to have as strong of a numeric tabular display and so forth and so it will be necessary to keep exploring this path for various options that may exist for native options.\n", "Q: Can I use iChat with MSN through its new XMPP/Jabber compatibility? The Windows Team blog announced XMPP compatibility with their MSN/Live IM network recently. \nHave anyone tried to get iChat to work with MSN yet? \n(I'm not looking for Jabber transports)\n\nA: No, it is not implemented yet.\nIn the meanwhile, you can use Cocoon for MSN chat as an iChat extension.\n\nA: As Gerry said, Cocoon is your only option at the moment - but it hasn't been touched in months, despite continued donations from users.\n", "Q: How do I do control-shift-eject on a MacBook Air? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs there a similarly fast alternative to Crtl + Shift + Eject for new Macbook Air? \n\nThis keystroke turns off the display on most Macs. \nBut the Air does not have an eject key. How do I achieve the same result?\n\nA: Control + Shift + F12\nsee also: Is there a similarly fast alternative to Crtl + Shift + Eject for new Macbook that lack eject keys?\n", "Q: Running terminal commands on startup/login How can I run terminal commands on startup or login? On FreeBSD I believe you can do this using rc.d - is there an equivalent for the Mac? I know how to set up Login Items, but these only work for GUI applications, and there must be an elegant way to make terminal commands run without wrapping them in a GUI executable? As clarified below, I sometimes need to sudo these commands.\n\nA: OSX uses launchd to start Unix scripts and executables at boot or login.\nNew tasks are added via launchctl to update a plist\nAn easier way of doing this is to use the app Lingon now available on the Mac App Store or LaunchControl\n\nA: Use Apple Script.\nThe script would be like this:\n\ndo shell script \"cd ~/Documents\"\n\nCreate an application that uses this script. This application can be added to the login items.

Does it matter where I purchase an Apple product (Macbook Pro), or will I get essentially the same product with the same level of support no matter where I buy it? \n\nA: If it's a certified apple reseller you will get exactly the same product as when purchasing at www.apple.com or the apple store.\nIf it's another shop that is not certified by apple, you should ask them (how are we here supposed to know?).\nYou will get the same level of support. It's worldwide one year limited guarantee with 90 days of telephone support.\n\nA: If you want support at the time of purchase (installing stuff, help with setup, etc.), you will usually (not guaranteed though) find a higher level of expertise and service at the Genius Bar in an Apple Store, due to Apple's required employee training programs.\nExchanges for the rare minor defects (dead pixels, etc.) are easiest if you buy local.\nThe product should all be identical if it's a official Apple reseller.\n", "Q: What is the MacBook Pro's infrared port used for? I know my macbook has an infrared port, but I don't know what it's used for.\n\nA: Most typically, it is used for the Apple Remote, which can control iTunes, QuickTime and various other built in software. Additionally, 3rd party software (see Sofa Remote and Remote Buddy) also makes use of the device and can tie in much more functionality.\nIn the past (prior to Lion), the Apple Remote was an excellent companion to Front Row, a media manager that some call the predecessor to the Apple TV interface.\n", "Q: Do new Macbook Pros come with SATA 3.0Gbps or 6.0Gbps I'm thinking of buying a SSD or hybrid drive for my new Macbook Pro.

I noticed that scrolling in Firefox on Lion is not very pleasant experience.\nIs there a way to optimize it for better performance?\nI tried smooth scrolling setting - but it didn't do anything.\n\nA: Go to configuration by type about:config in address bar and press enter key then enter scroll in filter box, now you can change all scroll options.\n", "Q: Lossless DVD Conversion to iTunes Is there a program for Mac that I can use to copy DVDs to iTunes? I've tried Handbrake but the quality is poor. Maybe there's just a setting I need to change?\n\nA: Given that you want playback on your Mac and iOS devices, Handbrake is really the way to go. As you note in the comments, it's not lossless, but you should be able to get pretty good quality, and with a good reduction in file size.\nIf you find the quality of your first attempt unacceptable, you can adjust the settings to improve it (typically at the cost of file size).\nA good starting point is the Universal or iPad preset in Handbrake. The RF slider adjusts how much compression is used (higher RF = more compression = less quality).\n\nTry setting it around 19, maybe 18 (it's logarithmic, so small amounts make big differences) and do an encode, see how you feel about the quality. If it's still lacking, reduce the RF a bit more and try again. Perhaps just pick a chapter or two as a test encode until you figure out what settings you want.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install siri on iphone 3gs? I have an iPhone 3GS, and I want to know if it is possible to install Siri on it.\n\nA: It is not possible to install Siri. The iPhone 4S is the only iPhone that includes this system-wide functionality. You may have read about the Siri app, which is what the Siri team originally developed before their company was acquired by Apple. This app was available for older iPhohe models. However, when the iPhone 4S was released, the Siri app was discontinued. Hope this helps. \n\nA: Actually it is possible, but you have to jailbreak your 3GS first. I found this article on your iPhone 4 and 3GS.\nIt looks like you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Jail broken iOS 5 device  \n\n*OpenSSH and iFile from Cydia  \n\n*SFTP client ( CyberDuck for Mac OS X and WinSCP for Windows)  \n\n*Extracted Siri files from iPhone 4S\n\n\nMore info on the link.\n\nA: This isn't a very reputable website, but it shows the Tweets that iPhone hacker Musclenerd posted about his findings with iOS 5.0.1. It turns out that Apple tweaked it, and removed the encryption used on the locations where Siri is stored (essentially meaning that it's now legal to port Siri to other devices). \nJailbreaking at the minute is tethered, meaning you cannot reboot without losing your jailbreak (you have to re-jailbreak before you can turn it on again). (there is a semi-tether however).\nMusclenerd on Twitter is the best person to watch for information about Siri on anything other than the iPhone 4S. It should be possible in the coming weeks, or months to do such a thing. \nJust watch this space.\n", "Q: Is there an iMessage client for Windows? My wife's iPhone has iOS 5 and hence iMessage installed.  I would like to be able to chat with her using my Windows computer.  What options are available for this?  Is there a Windows client or any web site that can provide a bridge?\n\nA: As of May 2016 the only official iMessage clients are for iOS and OS X. Unfortunately you're out of luck using it on Windows.\nIt's very unlikely that any iMessage clients for non-Apple platforms will be released in the future. It's a major selling point for Apple's platforms, and therefore not in Apple's interest to make a Windows (or Android, Linux, etc.) version. Additionally, it has some fairly complex encryption and security protocols, which likely make it very difficult if not impossible for an unofficial client to be developed.\n\nA: If your device is jailbroken, you can purchase the Remote Messages tweak from Cydia ($3.99, currently) and use iMessage via a web interface from anywhere (PC included).\n\nA: As noted above, there currently exists no iMessage client for Windows. However, your question seems broader than that: your wife has an iPhone, you have a Windows computer, and you want to be able to communicate with each other.\nThere exist a number of options that could allow you to communicate.\nIf you wish to literally chat, you could use the embedded phone call feature in gmail (requires plugin) on your computer to call your wife's iPhone.\nIf you wish to type and have messages appear on each other's screen, both Windows computers and iPhones come with e-mail clients.\nIf you wish to send messages more optimized for shorter communication, you could create a Google Voice account exchange send SMS messages between Google's free interface and your wife's phone. To avoid SMS charges on your wife's phone, she'd need to install the Google Voice app and do the messaging through the app.\nIf there are particular features of iMessage you wish to exploit that these methods do not allow, please clarify your question to highlight the features you are missing here.\n\nA: No, there is no iMessage client available for a Windows PC.\niMessage is based on a propietary, binary and encrypted protocol (source Wikipedia) with a client side device certificate, which makes it unlikely to be reverse engineered and implemented in third party apps any time soon (although attempts are being made).\n", "Q: How can I keep Safari from re-opening my tabs from my last session? When I re-open Safari on my Mac Mini, it keeps opening the same tabs that were open before it was quit (or before the Mac OS X was switched off). The result is that it takes too much time to be operative, especially when I restart my Mac.\nIn the preference panel, the \"Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps\" option is already disabled, but Safari keeps opening the tabs open in the last session. I checked also in my MacBook, which is running Mac OS X 10.7.2, and that option doesn't change the Safari's behavior I describe in this question.\n\nIs there any way to force it not to open all the tabs? I looked at its preferences, but I have not found anything that could help me. Is there any other way to disable this feature?\n\nA: Quit Safari with ⌥⌘Q and run this in the Terminal\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false\n\n\nA: This behavior is the resume feature.\nDisable using Terminal\nIf you only want to disable resume for safari, type this in the terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.safari ApplePersistenceIgnoreState YES\n\nIf you want to set the resume feature again, simply write NO using the same syntax.\nDisable using TinkerTool\nThis application gives you access to additional preference settings and allows to activate hidden features in the operating system.\n\n", "Q: Two iTunes installs pointing at the same NAS share For many years, I have had a set of mp3 files on a NAS that I manually managed (I've been picky about artist/album/track naming). The two Macbooks in our house each have their own iTunes libraries (the itl and xml files) on their respective local drives at ~/Music/iTunes/. To add music, I just make sure the SMB or AFP share is mounted and then do \"Add to Library\" in iTunes, pointing it at the top of the music file tree on the mounted directory from the NAS. This has worked fine for years.\nNow, I'm thinking I would like the entire iTunes folder (everything from ~/Music/iTunes and below) to live on the NAS and just let iTunes keep the music organized in a folder below this directory. But, I'd like still like to have both MacBooks keep their own library. We both manage syncing to iDevices by \"sync only checked songs...\" so we need our own version of what is checked and unchecked along with our own smart playlists.\nIs what I'm trying to do possible? What if I play games with symlinks on the NAS (it's a Linux box running Samba and netatalk.)\n\nA: iTunes keeps a lock file in the directory to see if there is an instance of iTunes running - only one is allowed at a time.\nSimilarly, if you're using the same directory, each version of iTunes will overwrite the library file, so trying to maintain two different sets of music within one tree isn't really possible. At least, that's what happened last time I tried this.\nYou're better off having Home Sharing enabled, and then having one Macbook at a time run iTunes pointing to the library.\nThe other can then use a blank dummy library, and play whatever the first is sharing through Home Sharing. Either can run in each role, just hold down Option at start-up to decide if you want to use.\nPersonally, given a family with a bunch of iPhones, AppleTVs, and laptops, I have a single iTunes server machine that is always on, with a very large library. All music is in my iTunes Match account, all videos can be synced over the air through home sharing, and wireless syncing. It's the closest I've found to an iTunes server device.\n\nA: My solution for that is having only one computer managing the library. First it was a PC running iTunes for Windows. Then, I moved to Ubuntu and started using Banshee for both managing the library and keeping my iPod updated. Finally, I have a Mac Book Pro and I have moved back to iTunes.\nThe Linux server, running both Samba and Netatalk, acts also as a mediacenter (with XBMC) that shares music also over uPNP, so I can access and play music from virtually any network device, even from the Internet.\nIn the past I've tried other schemas involving iTunes and network filesystems and it always turned into a headache.\n\nA: You can have one mac rule the remote library, store it's playlists there (and create lock files, keep the library organized, etc...) but you'll want to keep a local library on the second and subsequent libraries and have them just import the songs and playlists from XML and store their library but not their media in a distinct folder - one folder per secondary library.\n", "Q: Is there a UNIX-style triple click to select path in Terminal.app? In Red Hat, if there is a path somewhere on my terminal window and I triple click it, the whole path is selected. I can then easily copy it using middle-click or a regular copy-paste.\nThis doesn't seem to work in Terminal.app, i.e. triple click selects the whole line which is most of the time useless.\nIs there a way to change this behavior? Should I look into other terminal apps like iTerm? \n\nA: Although this doesn't answer your question directly, a better terminal program is probably iTerm2. This does allow for this kind of selection, even nicer, double clicking also automatically copies it to the clipboard as well!\n\nA: The shortcut for Terminal.app is ⌘+⇧+doubleclick.\nYou might also be interested in the following shortcuts:\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘+K to clear the screen\n\n*ctrl+U to delete everything to the left of the cursor\n\n*ctrl+K to delete everything to the right of the cursor\n\n*ctrl+A to jump to the left end\n\n*ctrl+E to jump to the right end\n\n", "Q: Why is my iPhoto burn failing? I am trying to burn selected photos to a DVD and it keeps telling me that the burn failed:\n\nI've tried rebooting and that helped the first time, but the second disk I tried to burn failed. What's up with this? How can I fix it? I am using iPhoto '11 (9.2.1).\n\nA: Ok, so after taking the MBP to the Genius Bar, they ended up replacing the optical drive. Luckily it didn't cost anything, as it was under warranty. So, I had a faulty optical drive to blame for my problems.\n", "Q: How can I delete saved commands from Terminal? As all of you know, Mac OS X stores all commands that run from Terminal in Terminal itself, however, I want to delete (for example) the last 3 commands from the terminal. How can I do this?\n\nA: For Mac Terminal user\ndelete bash commands history with the following command\n\n$ echo '' > ~/.bash_history\n\nFor Mac zsh user\ndelete zsh commands history with the following command\n\n$ echo ''> ~/.zsh_hostory\n\n\nA: It's not a Mac OS feature but a shell feature. Assuming that you are using bash (the default):\n\n\n*\n\n*the command history is stored in memory and persisted in a file (usually ~/.bash_history)\n\n*you can list and edit the history with the history command\n\n\nWith man bash (in the SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS section) you will find the description of the different options.\nYou can:\n\n\n*\n\n*list the history entries\n$ history\n\n\n*delete the whole history\n$ history -c\n\n\n*delete a given entry\n$ history -d offset\n\n\nA: Mac OS does not store anything anywhere.\nbash, which is the shell that is run in the terminal, does store the command history.\nThe terminal command history is stored in a hidden file in your user directory called .bash_history\nThis means the file is: /Users/{username}/.bash_history\nYou have to enable \"Show System Files\" to see it (from the \"View\" menu in finder).\nThe file is just a textual list of everything you type in the shell. You can open it in TextEdit, or your editor of choice.\n\nYou should probably close Terminal.app to flush any recent changes into the file before making changes, or it may get overwritten from a version Terminal.app has in memory.\n\nA: In addition to Text Edit, Also, if you are old school, use 'vi' to edit the file and remove the offensive commands. Similar command-line editors are  emacs (which shares editing shortcuts with OS X) or nano (which has simplified navigation and visual help on how to save and quit the editor without needing a reference sheet).\n", "Q: Setup macbook pro for ruby on rails development I just got my first Macbook :).\nAnd now I want to configure it for Ruby on rails development.\nI want to setup following things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Textmate \n\n*Ruby using RVM \n\n*Rails \n\n*Mysql \n\n*Postgresql \n\n*Apache\n\n\nAlso I am new to Xcode.\n\nA: Have you seen this? setting up rails on snow leopard or this? Mac Setup or this? Installing Rails on Lion\nThis is a really common combo these days it wasn't hand to find a few walk-through descriptions. \nAlso, let me recommend osx-gcc-installer is you just want a compiler and don't plan on using XCode. I find XCode to be useless unless you're planning on writing Mac or iOS apps. \n\nA: See Installing Ruby, Rails, and MySQL on OS X Lion | Think Vitamin. Basically you'll have to dowload and install Xcode from the App Store, install Ruby and MySQL with Homebrew, and Rails with RubyGems.\n", "Q: Can I put more than 8GB of Ram in a MacBook Pro 5.1 I have a 5.1 MacBook Pro (5.1 Model Late 2008) with 4GB of Ram. All the apple documentation I can find that the maximum supported for this model is 8GB of RAM (2 x 4GB). Has anyone tried to put bigger DIMMs into one to see if they would work? Given the price of RAM at the moment I would go for 2 x 8GB if I knew it would work.\n\nA: Your Macbook Pro supports only 8GB (15'') or 6GB (17'') of RAM.\nApple states that it's 4GB, but OWC continuously check the max. supported RAM.\nSee this list here.\n\n", "Q: Time machine is not including new directories in its backup My Time Machine is going for a year quite strong, but I recently noticed it is not including new directories in its backup. Basically new directories are being excluded by rule or error and I'd like some help figuring out which. \n\n\n*\n\n*It still does its normal backup.

There's no obvious back button that I can see.\nI'm using iBooks 1.5, which I believe is currently the latest version.\n\nA: If you touch the middle of the screen to show the buttons and controls, there should be a text link at the bottom left saying \"Back to p. ###\". It is beneath the dots and the slider to scroll quickly through the book. Touch it and you'll be back where you came from.\n\nA: Or you can use the short keys shows below:\ngo back: command + [\ngo forward: command + ]\n", "Q: Unified Switching between Keyboard Layouts in Various OSs I have a Mac with VMWare installed and run Windows- and Ubuntu-powered virtual machines there. The problem is that in each of the operating systems I have to use different keys to switch between keyboard layouts (English->German->Russian).\nDoes anybody know whether there is some way to unify the layout switching key combination in all the OSs? For instance switching the layouts using Apple/Windows key and Space Bar.\n\nA: Yes, should be possible. You just need to unify your keyboard shortcuts in each OS. \nFor OS X it's in \"System Preferences\" → \"Keyboard\"/\"Keyboard Shortcuts\" for Snowleopard it's in \"Keyboard & Text Input\" on the left side and then you enter your desired shortcut by clicking on the assigned shortcut and pressing the combination you want.  \nNote that cmd+space is usually assigned to Spotlight search, so you would need to change that too.  \n\nAnd I think you know how to change it in Windows and Ubuntu, or you're able to find out - right ?\n", "Q: Biggest external monitor support for 13\" MacBook Pro I'm using a 13\" MacBook Pro and want to connect it to an external monitor. What is the largest resolution supported for an external monitor?\nFrom what I know this MacBook Pro is using VGA intel.\nWorkstation:\nOS X Lion\nMacBook Pro 13\" early 2011\n\nA: The tech specs for your model are on Apple's support site.\nIf you have a display that has a native Displayport input (many mid-range and up displays from the past 2-3 years), you can output up to 2560x1600. Typically these displays have a full-size Displayport connector, so you'll need an adapter or cable that goes from Mini Displayport to standard Displayport - they can be found pretty cheaply at Monoprice or Amazon.\nYou can also output up to 2560x1600 using a Mini Displayport to Dual-link DVI adapter, however these have been problematic in the past and run around $100+. Not a great option unless you already have a monitor with a resolution higher than 1920x1200 and it doesn't have a Displayport input.\nUsing adapters for single-link DVI, HDMI or VGA, you can support up to 1920x1200.\n", "Q: Mac terminal cd to folder IN current directory Let say my current directory in terminal is ~/Users/Desktop. On my desktop, there's a folder called \"sample_dir\". How can I cd in this \"sample_dir\" folder with typing: \"cd ~/Users/Desktop/sample_dir\"? There's gotta be a shorter way that looks at your current directory and appends that path to the directory you pass in to make things faster.\nThanks\n\nA: I usually type cd, then drag the folder (from Finder) that I want to open in Terminal, and drop it in Terminal. This will add the full directory path, then press enter to change to the dropped directory.\n\nA: The path you are using cd ~/Users/Desktop/sample_dir is wrong.\nIf you have a folder named sample_dir in you user's Desktop directory then the full path to the directory is:\ncd /Users/YourUserName/Desktop/sample_dir\n\nWhere YourUserName is the the short account username.

Type:\ncd sample_dir\n\nIt checks for you. If for some strange reason that doesn't work, type:\ncd ./sample_dir\n\n\nA: Found an even easier way with MacOS Ventura 13.0.1.\n\n*\n\n*open Finder and navigate to the folder you want to cd to\n\n*ensure you can see the Path Bar (Finder > View > Show Path Bar)\n\n*right click the folder you want to cd to in the Path Bar\n\n*select 'Open in Terminal'\n\nEt Voilà!\n\nA: cd Desktop/sample_dir\nshould work :)\n\nA: Dude you should do a simple step if you are using mac type cd and then use space and then drag the file you wants to open in terminal(most probably for git hub purpose).\n", "Q: Linking emails to calendar appointments I have an iPhone 4S. I schedule all my appointments through the iPhone calendar app. Typically I receive an email with all the pertinent information  and in turn, I have to transfer all of the information from the email to the calendar. When the appointment comes around, I have to search through my email files in order to locate any additional information. Is there a way to link emails to the calendar in order to easily access them when my appointment date comes up?   \n\nA: You cannot link the emails and iCal events, however you can create the event by tapping on the date within the e-mail. You can then double tab on the content of the email, select all, and the copy and paste into the notes section of the iCal event.\n\nA: if you drag and drop an email (without a date) from mail into calendar it WILL contain a link back to the email \n\nA: You can forward the email to yourself and write a date ( like tomorrow at 16). In the received email this will be blue colour (tomorrow at 16) and you can create event directly from email.\nWhat is good? In calendar at that event you will (on URL) you will find Show the message in Mail and will open that email with attach and everything.\n\nA: Actually you can do this. It's quite a bit hacking but you are able to link most mails to your calendar via deeplinking with iOS 7 or higher.\nWhat you need to do:\n\n\n*\n\n*First thing you need to do is to figure out the Message-ID of an email. This message ID is enough to get you to the desired mail\n\n\nUnfortunately, you cannot get message-ID on the iOS (AFAIK, maybe you could do some hacking with Shortcuts as for now...)

Supposedly it works fine on Lion, and I'm guessing it has something to do with the switch from FileVault to FileVault 2, but am at a loss as to what to do or if there is any way to access the partition without using Lion.\nOutput from diskuil list:\n/dev/disk2\n#:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk2\n1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk2s1\n2:                  Apple_HFS WD1T                    43.0 GB    disk2s2\n3:          Apple_CoreStorage Incompatible Format     956.7 GB   disk2s3\n4:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk2s4\n\nWhen I plug in the drive, the HFS partition mounts fine.

I have an iPhone 4S running iOS 5 and cannot find (after trying) any app that blocks calls. Is there anything out there that can block calls on the iPhone?\n\nA: I have not found a 3rd party application that does this well. You can obviously block a number via your cell carrier. Since I could not find a good method to block calls with an application I ended up adding the number to be blocked to my contact list and assigned a \"silent\" ring tone to the contact. Although it will not block a incoming call it will cause the phone to play a silent ringtone when the number in question calls. Not a true block caller solution but at least a potential workaround.\n\nA: Up until iOS 7, the only solutions for actual call blocking on the iPhone required a jailbreak.\nHowever, it's not that difficult to find an alternative:\n\n\n*\n\n*New Contact into which all unwanted phone numbers are stored\n\n*Assign a silent ringtone to the new contact.\n\n", "Q: Scrobble to last.fm with iTunes home sharing Is there a way to scrobble to last.fm what I play from my iPhone with home sharing?\nEdit: last.fm currently scrobbles when I play right from my iTunes. I am using the last.fm mac app. When I stream music from my iTunes library on my mac with my iPhone, using home sharing, last.fm does not scrobble.\n\nA: It can be done, using the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In iTunes, go to Preferences > Sharing Preferences. There is an option there called 'Home sharing computers and devices update play counts'. Turn that on.\n\n*After you've listened to some music, open the last.fm Scrobbler application on your computer, and it should prompt you to scrobble what you've just listened to.\nWorks for me - I'm using iTunes 11 on a Mac.\n", "Q: Open Mail Attachment with Unix-standard programs I use emacs as my standard text editor.  When someone sends me a mail attachment that contains text (for example a LaTeX file *.tex), Mail does not know how to open it and asks me to select an Application for opening.  A Finder window pops up listing all the Applications installed, some of which are text editors, e.g. TextEdit.\nThe emacs program lives in /usr/bin/emacs, but the /usr directory is not visible by default in Finder.  After some Google searching, I found that executing a\nsudo chflags nohidden /usr\n\nwill make the /usr directory visible in Finder.  I can then navigate to /usr/bin and see emacs in that directory, but it is grey'ed out and not selectable.\nHow do I select a non-Applications (i.e. /usr/bin/emacs, /usr/bin/vim, /usr/bin/gs, etc.) program to use for opening Mail attachments? \n\nA: You cannot as the process is controlled by LaunchServices\nWhen an application e.g. Mail.app wants to open a document it launches (or relaunches) the application that reads it and sends information to the document by Apple Events as described in Open Operations\nthus the handlers have to recognise these Apple Events which are managed by the Cocoa or Carbon libraries.\nSo to use emacs, vi etc you need to use one wrapped up as an app e.g. Aquamacs, Cocoa or Carbon version of emacs, MacVim etc.\nAnother way of thinking about this is if there is no terminal open how woul the Unix command write to the GUI?\n\nA: Okay, so you can do it for whatever Unix program you want to create a wrapper for.\nCreate an Automator application with a single action: Run AppleScript.\nMake it run the following script:\non run {input, parameters}\n        set x to \"/usr/bin/vim \" & quoted form of POSIX path of input\n    tell application \"Terminal\"\n        activate\n        do script x\n    end tell\nend run\n\nIf you really want to use some other editor in place of vim, you could replace /usr/bin/vim in the second line of the script with the path to whatever command you are trying use to open files from Mail.\n\nA: Depending on how you installed emacs, chances are it already came with Emacs.app. You could then simply copy (or link) this to the /Applications directory.\nIn my case (a installation by Homebrew) this will do:\ncp -R /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/23.2/Emacs.app /Applications/\n\nor \nln -s /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/23.2/Emacs.app /Applications/\n\nEmacs.app may then be used in any Mac OS X \"Open with…\" dialog.\n", "Q: Does iTunes in the Cloud/iTunes Match have any effect on syncing ratings between devices? With iTunes Match, I tend to pull songs down to either my phone or my Mac whenever I feel like listening to them, and delete them from the device afterwards at will. What's the story, then, with play counts and - more importantly - ratings? \nIf I rate a song on the phone, will the rating propagate to the Mac (or vice-versa) through iCloud, or is the only way to sync that data between the devices a wired/wi-fi sync through iTunes?\nAnd if an iTunes sync is required, what sync settings are necessary such that my ratings and playcounts will be copied across devices without having to sync the songs themselves, as we had to in the pre-iCloud days?\n\nA: I'll check my computer when I get home, but everytime I update the ratings on my iPhone there is definitely network activity (The network spinner is displayed everytime I change the rating). So it is definitely updating the iTunes Match library. Whether it updates the PC at home I'll have to see.\nI'm still waiting for it to upload about 600 songs.\nEdit:  I confirmed that ratings and play count  definitely are updated right away. PC to device changes take a little longer. I had one song disappear from my phone on my way to work because I accidentally removed it from match the night before and it took some time to propagate. \n\nA: I just did a test and I can confirm the ratings are in sync with iCloud. A gave a song a 5-star rate on my iPhone 4S and the 5 star rating appears on my MacBook Pro (pretty fast by the way).\nEDIT\nI just did a few more tests and the ratings are getting pushed within 1 or 2 minutes!\n\nA: I haven't been able to get my songs on my iPhone to sync ratings back to iTunes by wired sync, wireless sync, or via iTunes match. I'm not sure if this is because of iTunes match, but I never had this problem before I had iTunes match.\n\nA: iTunes Match is nothing to do with your actual songs. It simply matches your songs with what are on iTunes for the single purpose of saving Apple space and bandwidth with storing iCloud data.\nBasically, when you sync after doing iTunes Match, it syncs in precisely the same way, but instead of sending the music, it instead references an iTunes Match track which your device can then access.\nSo basically, all of your data other than the actual sound content will be maintained.\n", "Q: How can I disable Spaces in Lion? I used to use spaces a lot on Leopard and Snow Leopard, but the way it works on Lion is annoying for me, especially when it sends the full screen apps to a Space at the end of the row.\nIs there a way to disable Spaces altogether on Lion?\n\nA: *\n\n*Enter Mission Control\n\n*Hover over the selected space or hold ⌥\n\n*remove by clicking on the x\n\n\n\n\nA: The function \"Spaces\" doesn't exist any more. \nThis new Feature is called \"Mission Control\" in OS X Lion, and it's including the old Feature Spaces. \nYou cannot deactivate Mission Control, because it's an implemented way to handle FullScreen-Apps. \nYou have to live with that, but it can bee very helpful after a few days!\n", "Q: How to get apps to finish updating on iOS? My iPad 1 runs iOS 5.0.1 but I believe I have had this problem with previous versions. I'll go into the App Store and find a lot of pending updates. I'll tell it to update all and then leave it on to do its updating.\nLater (hours or days even) I come back and all or most of the apps that were updated have the faded icon and an empty update bar with a caption of \"Waiting . . .\" None of them are updating. I tap them and it doesn't launch and doesn't change the status. I've tried rebooting the iPad but that doesn't seem to help.\nEventually it will return to normal, but I have found no rhyme or reason. I am on 20 Mbit DSL so it shouldn't be that it takes days to download a few updates. I don't think that is what is happening anyway because I don't see any progress on any of them.\n\nA: Go back to the App Store app, and try hitting the update button again.  Your account login activity time may have expired sometime during the process.  If so, it will ask you to enter your password again before resuming downloading your updates.\n\nA: Back up your iPad to your computer or iCloud, and pull a factory reset on the sucker. I know that some people have been having issues with iOS 5.0.1, and that a complete wipe/reset is necessary to fix some issues. I hope this helps, and good luck!\n", "Q: Create a Smart Playlist for iCloud Songs that have been downloaded Locally Is there a way to create a Smart Playlist in iTunes that will contain the songs in my library that have been downloaded locally?  I have to reduce the bandwidth used at my job but I can download files at night and I want to only play songs that are downloaded to my computer (plus I don't want to play all the songs I own :-)).\n\nA: If you use the \"location\" parameter, and select \"is on this computer\", that will show only the ones downloaded—providing you don't have any other music.\nThis works for me, as I want to keep the storage on my MacBook Air to the minimum.\n\nA: Try setting the \"Date Modified\" parameter to \"in the last [n] months\".

The ones I can access have been entirely unhelpful.\nI don't have any parental controls turned on, and other devices on the same network have no trouble connecting via HTTPS.  What's going on?\n\nA: Have you tried rebooting? Sometimes it's a Keychain problem. Try opening the Keychain app, and see if it hangs. If it is so, repair permission with Disk Utility and then reboot. It worked for me (happened twice on my MBA).\n\nA: This sounds like a firewall issue. Do you have Little Snitch or another firewall control application installed on your mac? Have you checked the firewall settings in the System Preferences security pane?\n\nA: Is there a firewall somewhere on the network you are using that is blocking port 443?\nPerhaps the business whose wifi or ethernet you are using has a firewall, or a misconfigured or spyware infested router somewhere.\n", "Q: How does shareware store its usage? Most shareware (free trial) allows only for limited use e.g. one week or 10 uses. This shareware must have a way of storing the times it was used or for how long you have been using this. \nYet when I trash a shareware app, along with all it's preference files etc (using apptrap) and redownload it, it seems to remember the times used/usage time, even when I delete all of its pref files.\nI am alarmed that an application is storing data that persists on my computer even after I deleted what I thought were all traces of the application. If it can store usage data even after I thought I deleted it, there's no limit to the other data about me this software could be storing. I realize that different applications might use different techniques, but a great answer could outline some of the most common mechanisms.\nHow does an app know how many times it has been used? Where does it store this so that it persists even after I delete the application's preference file?\n(this is a question out of pure interest, I don't intend to use this info for malicious purposes)\n\nA: OSX Applications come in a .bundle file which is basically like a ZIP or other archive file in that it's actually a sort of folder. In that way all of your program files and dependencies are in one, neat package. Sometimes, though, other information like preferences will be stored throughout the system. Typical places to look are /Library and /Users/(user)/Library. Warning - do NOT delete anything unless you really, really want to mess something important up. If you have a legitimate concern I would suggest contacting the developer and asking for assistance.\n", "Q: I'm looking for a quick entry TODO application that syncs across an iPhone and my laptop I haven't been able to find the following feature set all in one place:\n\n\n*\n\n*offline access :: Something which guarantees offline changes aren't lost.\n\n*quick entry :: I should be able to activate it with a global hot key and it should provide me a quick entry window, either HUD-like a la Anxiety or Menu Bar centric a la Alarms\n\n*synchronized :: It should synchronize across my iPhone/iPad/laptop, either via iCal TODOs or whatever.\n\n*0 wait mobile entry :: Related: some mobile apps synchronize before I can enter in a new item.

I sync my iPad 2 with the iMac where all of my media and other stuff lives. Since the advent of iOS 5 and OTA syncing, however, the iPad has taken to syncing with both Macs, choosing (seemingly) randomly between the two when powered on and plugged in within WiFi range. The trouble is, when it syncs with the MBP, it generates dozens of \"error while syncing\" dialogs (which take awhile to individually dismiss) on the iPad because (I'm assuming) none of my content, apps, etc. are on that machine. \nIs there a way I can stop the MacBook Pro from syncing with the iPad?\nThanks!\n\nA: In iTunes on your MacBook Pro go to Preferences, then Devices, and then select the checkbox that says \"Prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically\"; that should solve your problem.\n", "Q: How can I see where a program writes to my disk? If I want to uninstall a program and remove all trace of data it stored on my computer, \nis there a tool to see where a program has written data? I expect it isn't going to be possible after the fact, but perhaps there is something that can run when a program is first launched to monitor all the locations to which it writes?\nI think I'm looking for something that does for local storage what Little Snitch does for the internet.\n\nA: If I get it right, you want to monitor all file-system operations of your app when you launch it and when it's running ?\nRather than finding each and every byte that this program has ever written to your hard-drive.  \nFor the first case I have two recommendations:\n\n\n*\n\n*fseventer\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Instruments.app from /Developer/Applications/ (you need Xcode for that)\n\n\n*\n\n*Choosing \"File Activity\" from the templates\n\n\n\n\nSupplement from 2011-12-22\n\n\n*\n\n*And for the command-line, copied from here \nsudo opensnoop -p PID\nShows you all of the files that are being accessed on your system by a particular process (by passing its PID)\n\nA: There method isn't as automated as other options, but it has the advantage that it finds files associated with an app even if they aren't used during the monitoring session.\nI use an app called Find Any File, which lets you search your entire hard drive easily using some complex queries.\nThis method relies on the assumption that all app files either have the name of the app in the filename, or are stored somewhere with the name of the app in an enclosing folder's name. This is almost always true; Application Support, login items/launchagents/launchdaemons, caches, the app bundle itself, etc all follow it.\nI've yet to find an app with files in non-obvious places that don't follow this rule.\nHere's how I would formulate my query for the app Balsamiq Mockups, which I installed a few days ago:\n\nThe reason I've got the two parts of the name separately is to cover cases where there is a space between the two words (like the app bundle) as well as where there isn't (like a com.developer.AppName file).\nThe Modification Date is within the past ... component is optional and only helpful when the app has been installed relatively recently. Generally, just the app name should be just fine.\nThe results show all the files that the app has created:\n\nI've got the view in hierarchical mode to show the location of the files, but either view mode is fine.\nIf you want to delete the files, switch to the list view, select them all, right click and choose Move to Trash.\n\nBonus: If the app has a custom file extension, you can easily round up all of those files too: Name ends in .ext\n\nA: This isn't ideal, but here's another idea:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new user account.\n\n*In terminal:\n\n*\n\n*touch ~/Desktop/first_dir\n\n*touch ~/Desktop/second_dir\n\n*ls -laR ~ > ~/Desktop/first_dir\n\n\n*Install the program in question\n\n*Run it\n\n*In terminal:\n\n*\n\n*ls -laR ~ > ~/Desktop/second_dir\n\n*diff ~/Desktop/first_dir ~/Desktop/second_dir\n\nA: The command line is the most efficient option here, just use the command lsof (list open files) with the relevant options, you can limit the results to file opened all, by user, by parent process, by group ID, etc.\nType in man lsof to the Terminal for all the options.\nAnother option is use the Activity Monitor app, locate your running app in the list, double click it, then select 'open files and ports'.\n", "Q: iPhoto isn't working on my 2011 MacBook Pro with OS X Lion I don't know why but my iPhoto on my dock just has a picture of some pencils and an ø through everything and it was the same thing when I looked at it in the applications.

Btw my MacBook Pro was shipped with OS X Lion so I don't have any startup disks or anything like that and I never set up Time Machine and I still don't know how to set it up, so anything involving those 2 are out of the question.\n\nA: You need to reinstall:\nFirst: make a backup. Any kind of back up. Always have an up-to-date back up of your iPhoto Library. \nTo re-install iPhoto\n \n1. Put the iPhoto.app in the trash (Drag it from your Applications Folder to the trash)\n \n2: Trash the Receipts: In the Finder use the Go menu and select Go To Folder.

It certainly accomplishes exactly what you're talking about.  I have several thousand events on my calendar, which appears to corrupt the database from time to time, as I have BusySync conflict issues, as they're called.  These errors are rare, and support from the company has always been a) speedy, b) comprehensive, c) able to solve the issue. I spent a substantial amount of time researching this years ago, well before iCloud and BusyMac were available... but at that time, BusySync was the only reasonable choice.  Since then, I haven't switched, because this solution still works well.\nI recommend BusySync or BusyMac... both work the same way, it just depends which environment you prefer.\nWhile you could use BusySync to host on a local server and that would be fine, working through Google is easy, free, and compatible (you can sync with other machines that don't use iCal or BusySync).  Google also allows for an easy web interface on the go, mobile integration, etc.\nI hope that helps.\n", "Q: How Do I Remove Duplicate Apps From Launchpad? I have three copies of Skype. How do I remove them from Launchpad?\n\n\nA: First make sure you don't really have three copies of the Application. You can use spotlight to clean out any duplicates and keep one copy of the application mounted.\nOnce that is resolved, you can delete the duplicates from Launchpad one by one; if they all go, just reinstall Skype.  \nYou can also force Launchpad to recreate its database, if it is corrupt, or just to refresh the apps alphabetically by using this hack:\n\n\n*\n\n*run Terminal\n\n*execute sudo rm ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dock/*.db\n\n*execute sudo killall Dock to restart Dock and Launchpad\n\n\nJust be aware that you will use any user-defined grouping/sorting etc. this way.\nAnother wonderful high-level (and safe with undos and backups) GUI solution is Launchpad control, which is a system preference panel.\n\nA: Pretty simple, in the new OS X (OS X El Capitan), follow the following instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Launchpad\n\n*Hold Alt/Option and click the Application\n\n*Re-open Launchpad and hold Alt/Option again, click the big X near the application.\n\n\nHope this helped! :D\n\nA: I couldn't find where the duplicate was with spotlight so I just launched it, right-clicked it's icon on the Dock (or ctrl + click), selected Options -> Show in Finder and found the duplicate. After deleting it I entered the following command in Terminal (not sure if this step was necessary):\nkillall Dock\n\nThen in Launchpad I deleted the duplicate (whose icon was displayed with a question mark) by long clicking it and then clicking the X button.\n\nA: Search for the app in your Finder by typing in the name of the app into the Search box in the upper right hand corner.  For example, if you have three Gmail apps which you are attempting to remove, type in Gmail.  All the apps with that name will appear.  Search for the apps you want to delete and drag them into the trash.  It is really THAT easy.  \n", "Q: How can I uninstall Adobe Air on Lion?

Unfortunately, I have several tracks that have given me the following error:\n\nThis thread indicates that I can convert them all to mp3 (even though most are already mp3) and I should be able to upload them to iCloud.  However, as pointed out in that thread, this is undesirable because of a) potential loss of quality due to the conversion process, and b) having to make sure that I properly replace the tracks in all associated playlists.\nDoes anyone know what the underlying cause is?  Is there another way to fix the problem?\nUPDATE\nHere's a screenshot of the file info summary, as requested:\n\n\nA: The reason why this particular song is not eligible for iCloud is, that it is compressed with a variable bitrate. And the bitrate at the beginning of the track is less than 96 kbit/s wich is the minimum to be matched bei iTunes Match.\n\nA: I've got that same CD and iTunes was able to download that track via Match.\nIt looks like your problem is due to the file's bit rate. Match requires bit rates greater than 96kbps, yours shows 84kbps:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/TS4124\nI found this tip for reencoding from within iTunes:\nhttp://www.mac-forums.com/forums/ipod-hardware-accessories/58137-change-encoding-itunes-possible.html#post361408\n\nYou can change the encoding quality by changing the quality settings in iTunes ->\n  Preferences -> Advanced -> Importing. Reselecting the songs that are\n  at 320, right clicking and hitting Convert to MP3 (Or AAC whatever you\n  use) will reencode them to the lower rates\n\nI believe when you do this, it preserves the original file, but make a backup, anyway - better safe than sorry.\n\nA: I had the same situation where a selection of my older tracks were marked as ineligible. After some brief investigation I realized it was because I'd bought these using a different iTunes account (I created a new account after I emigrated to a new country).  I guess there's nothing I can with these old ones.  \n\nA: You can also convert the songs to AAC by selecting them and then rightclicking them. You will see the option \"Convert to AAC\". You will have all songs double now. You can delete the original songs. The converted ones will be eligible for uploading to iCloud.\n", "Q: How to copy my iPhone contacts to my sim card? (without Jailbreak) How to copy my iPhone contacts to my sim card? (without Jailbreak)\nI want to go back to my Nokia phone but I was using iPhone for a Year so i have many contacts in it. Now I want to copy my all iPhone contacts to my sim. and I will use same sim in my nokia phone.\n\nA: Ok Just tested this. if you have an iCloud account, which you can get one free using your iPhone. You can sync your contacts to it. Then export all your contacts out as a vCard file.\nYou should then be able to send or export that file from a Mac or Pc to your Nokia phone using either the free Nokia software (Mac/PC) or the Built in Bluetooth of the Mac.\nTo Start.\nOnce you have synced your contacts to iCloud, You can login to the web interface for iCloud on a web Browser on a desktop or Laptop.  Got to the Contacts view.\nIn the All contacts view. Select the very first contact.\n\nThen just like any other list, hold down the shift key, and use the scroll bar within the contacts view to scroll right down to the last contact. And  Select it. Doing this should now highlight all the contacts in the blue selected colour.\n\nNow you can use the Action button to export to vCard.\n\nThe file will download to you download folder, And will be named after the first contact. But the file will be a multi-contact vCard which can be sent over bluetooth of via the Nokia software to the Phone.\nSlight UPDATE. I forgot to mention..\nOf course if you have a Mac you can sync the contacts straight to the AddressBook.app, and either do the same select and export as vCard. Or again use the Nokia software for the Mac to sync to the Nokia phone.\n\nA: There are all sorts of devices that talk to the phone on a 30 pin interface and can write to your SIM card.

For some unknown reason, backups tend to get incredibly slow over the network (the first few backups work fine and timely, then it gets crazy slow.) I let the backup run over gigabit for a night, and I came back to find 300 MB of 10 GB backed up.  Anyway...\nI'd like to plug that networked HD into my notebook over FireWire directly, and backup to it's sparsebundle locally.

It's worth noting 1 isn't easy because TM doesn't want to backup to sparse disks.  2 isn't easy because AFP can't connect to localhost, it just tells you to access the shared files locally.\nSuggestions appreciated!  Thanks.\n\nA: You can try mounting that volume and then use the tmutil command to tell Time Machine where do you want backups to go to.

I have a problem with my MacBook Pro 2010 13 inch, 2.4 GHz. Originally I had Snow Leopard installed on my Mac, then I was trying to upgrade it to Lion (official version from App Store). \nDuring the installation, an error occurred and I got a kernel panic. But that's not exactly the problem. I found out that the laptop had had a firmware password set by somebody (not me). \nNone of the boot modifier keys (except option) appear to work. When I press option, it asks me for a password. Some people told me to switch the RAM slots or take one out and then turn on the computer holding ⌘+⌥+P+R. That didn't work either. Still see the password prompt. \nAny ideas how to reset it?\n\nA: Not sure if this is too late of an answer. I know you've already attempted to disable the password, but try these steps exactly:\nYou can remove the firmware password by changing the RAM configuration, booting up to the startup menu, shutting down and changing it back. Basically, if you have two 1GB chips of RAM in there now, you can remove one of the chips, start up holding alt/option, shut down and put the other chip back in. This will remove the firmware password.\nNow, you can follow these instructions for doing the erase and install.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Matt's answer should apply to a 2010 MacBook Pro but it won't work for newer machines.\nMacBook Air (Late 2010) and later, MacBook Pro (Early 2011) and later, iMac (Mid 2011) and later, Mac mini (Mid 2011): Recovering a lost firmware password\n\nOnly Apple retail stores or Apple Authorized Service Providers can unlock these computers protected by a firmware password.\n\n", "Q: Sorting Contacts in Other Languages I use the iPhone in English, but I save the names of my contacts in Russian. The problem is that they all appear now under (#).\nIs there any way to fix that?\n\nA: I had a similar problem. Have several contacts in Serbian (cyrillic) others in English. I solved the problem by adding to each contact written in cyrillic new fields for phonetic spelling for the last and the first name.\n\nA: Unfortunately since your iPhone is set to the default language of English; your contacts in Russian will be sent straight to the # section of your contact listings. The reasons are that the Russian and English alphabets are not associative, and therefore you cannot file Russian characters under English ones. Even though it could make sense that character sounds in Russian could be relatively phonically associated with English ones; it doesn't make sense to program something that heavy into a mobile OS. I have Japanese contacts on my phone, and it is pushed to the # section as well. I'm sorry that I couldn't solve your dilemma, but there isn't a solution (yet).\n\nA: I'm not sure when this feature is added. My iOS version is 10.3.2 and this might change in the future. \nAssuming you already have many contacts with English first/last names, and say you want to add a Chinese-named contact in the list so that it is not arrange inside the \"#\" section.\nAll you need to do is scroll to the bottom when adding a contact->add field->\"Phonetic first name\" and \"Phonetic last name\"->type in the first/last name field properly. The phonetic fields will be filled in automatically.\nWhen editing an old contact, you can type a whitespace after the existing first/last name to auto fill the phonetic fields. Removing the whitespace afterward might change the format of the phonetic fields but will not remove them. \nFor other languages, you might have to type in them manually. Then this contact will be ordered by its phonetic field but displayed in its original language. \n\nA: For Russian, Japanese, and other languages whose alphabets don't sort \"properly\" in an English system on the iPhone, enter your Contacts' names phonetically. The phonetic spelling will be used for alphabetization.\nIf you simply want to correct the way Siri says the names (without affecting the way the name is sorted -- either in English or phonetic), then enter your Contacts' names using the Pronunciation field.\nFor details on how to add these fields and enter the info, see Josh Centers' article in TidBITS (and the comments thereto), Socializing Siri: Add Relationships, Teach Pronunciations, and More.\n\nA: Sorting Japanese or Chinese  is not only difficult—it’s an unsolved problem. This seems hard to believe if you are not familiar with the complexities of processing Japanese  or Chinese  digitally. But what is trivially easy in English is impossible in Japanese or Chinese, even with the amount of computer power we have available today.\n", "Q: Creating star effect in Pixelmator I have a picture taken with a person in front of a Christmas tree; the lights in the Christmas tree look like small blurry things.\nHowever, I want to make the lights look like stars. Is this possible in Pixelmator?\n\nA: This is most certainly possible in Pixelmator by using a brush in the form of a star. You can easily create one yourself straight in Pixelmator or you search on the net for an image of a star. Make sure the area around the star is transparent then you can save the star as a png-file and drag and drop that file onto the brushes palette. Now with the brush tool you can click on each blurry christmas light and cover it with the star. Try different blending modes for the brush. It could be you could get better results then. \nIt is also possible to create a bokeh effect in Pixelmator. The guys at http://pixelmatortutorials.net have had a tutorial about this some time ago. The bokeh effect is done by applying one of the standard filters in Pixelmator.\n\nA: It's not the focal length that's causing the blur (bokeh), it's the aperture relative to the focal length coupled with the distances of the person to the tree. \nShaped bokeh is generally done by shooting through a paper cutout, not by altering the image after its shot.\nhttp://www.flickr.com/groups/shaped_bokeh/discuss/72157610869813179/\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Upgrade - 16GB RAM or 128GB SSD I am asking myself which constellation is better: should I stock up my RAM up to 16GB (from 8GB), or should I buy a SSD with 128GB?? \nI really dont know :/\nCheers!\nBTW: My macbook supports 16GB RAM, i already checked this ;) \n\nA: While I agree with others here that an SSD will give your MacBook Pro a great speed boost, the problem with a 128GB SSD is that it's probably smaller in capacity than your currently installed hard disk. If that's the case and you'll need to have a hard disk in the optical bay as well, the SSD solution is less attractive if you need the optical drive.\nThe problem with storage solutions that are too small is that they become less effective (fast) as you fill them close to their capacity. This is true of both hard disks and SSDs.\nSo, best to ask the questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How big is my installed hard disk and how much of it am I using, how much more of it will I be using in the next year?\n\n*Do I need the optical drive built into my MacBook Pro or could I move my current hard disk into that bay with an adapter.\nIf you can fit your MacBook Pro's current installed stuff into 64GB (unlikely but possible) then a 128GB SSD might work out well, even without the use of a hard disk for additional storage.\n\nA: Go for the 128GB SSD. Your MacBook Pro doesn't use much more than 4GB of RAM with normal processes, and music/video editing will work well enough with 8GB. The SSD will make your MacBook Pro a lot faster, will give you greater battery life, and will have a lesser chance of crashing compared to your stock HDD. I hope this helps, and good luck!\n\nA: Guess it depends what you use your MBP for. 8 GB RAM is sufficient for most scenarios (you could check the free RAM using Activity Monitor). But the SSD gives you an instant boost over any HDD - there you can immediately tell the difference.\nIf you need more storage you could also move your HDD to the Superdrive space using an optibay adapter or something similar from e.g. ebay\n\nA: I follow Irussell810. I would go for the SSD. But tell us what you're doing with your MBP. Is it the average use (which I doubt cause you are eager for more power/performance) or do you use your Mac for high demanding tasks (like rendering, virtualisation,...).\nIf you just want a faster computer without really needing it for your job or so, I would go for the SSD.\nIf you are performing some high-load tasks on your Mac, I would go for both RAM and SSD-upgrade :) (but I think I would go for the RAM for virtualisation of rendering).\n\nA: RAM upgrade above 8GB if...\n\n*\n\n*you do run Virtual Machines excessively because you need to allocate a lot of RAM to the virtual OS\n\n*Other than that, this will most likely not be necessary. Mac OS X operates very efficient with 8GB of RAM. If you do not run VMs, there will  be no increase in performance in most cases!\n\nSSD upgrade if...\n\n*\n\n*you want a snappier response throughout the system.\n\n*you run big programs such as Adobe or photo editing software that take long to load.\n\n*you need faster boot/shut down/sleep times.\n\n*if you carry your MBP around a lot. SSDs are very shock resistent. No mechanical parts move.\n\n*if you want a more quiet MBP.\n\nSSDs also consume less power. But you won't notice it significantly.\nThink of this:\nIn today's computers, the bottle-neck of processing is usually the hard drive. Processors generally need to wait for the hard drive's read/write operations which are a lot slower. Thus a faster hard drive is needed for a better overall performance in processing. RAM won't help if the needed amount is saturated.\n\nA: Correct me if i'm wrong but RAM upgrade which basically meaning is your physical memory, when upgraded, can help you have little less number of page faults..During the time when page translation takes place the logical address space needs to map the active processes onto the RAM i.e. physical memory based on the page table and page size of all those running processes. Now, consider a 32 bit processor which will have 2^32 logical addresses( worth 4GB) will have to have 4GB worth of RAM for absolute performance. Theoretically that means no virtual memory wud be necessary since the RAM alone wud capable enough to handle the processes when the page translation takes place (from logical address to physical address).This scenario is very much achievable (atleast theoretically) in case of 32 bit processors as the maximum no. of pages created is worth 4GB.A quick 4GB upgrade should fix the problem leaving virtually no possiblity of a page fault\n Now take modern processors having 64 bit architectures. Having a 64 bit processor means the total no. of logical addresses created wud be 2^64 i.e. whopping '16 million GB'. This is almost unthinkable beyond quantification. In order to handle these '16 million GB' logical addresses and map them to the physical memory u wud literally have to have a RAM module worth the eiffel tower or even empire state building.This is in no way possible to implement. What we wud need and have to heavily rely on wud be a virtual memory management model which relies on storage memory(typically HDDs).Upgrading from 4GB to 8GB worth of RAM(and having a slow HDD) so as to handle '16 million GB' worth of page translation wud be a teeny tiny modification though some processes wud definitely loaded faster or some heavy apps cud become snappier and more performant since no. of page faults gets reduced to quite some extent.In order to overcome these page faults the logical address wud definitely have to rely on HDDs (thru virtual memory mechanism). Having an efficient virtually memory mechanism is gonna be almost the only dependable feature for overall system performance. *Surely a RAM upgrade wud help but not as much as a switch from traditional HDDs to SSDs.**No matter what you do, you wud have to depend on virtual memory  so you better think of having a greating storage memory..* As far as SSDs go, they surely are fit for the battle. You will still have a lot of page faults but let the SSDs take care of it.\n  What is page fault??\nWell,your logical address spaces are in the form of pages and these pages are to be mapped onto the physical memory(RAM).Some of these pages are not able to be mapped due some reason such as memory constraints. This means those processes (in the form of pages) do not get a 1-1 correspondence with the RAM.This is a page fault. Otherwise, there wud be a page hit.Due to existence of page faults which is kinda inevitable we do address translation(mapping) with storage memory instead.This is virtual memory management.No matter how much RAM you put,your storage memory will be key player in m/m management unless you get yourself '16 million GB' of RAM.\n  Criticisms are welcome..\n", "Q: iTunes Match wont match a song in the store that i already own, recorded from vinyl I have a rather large vinyl collection, some of which i have recorded to mp3 and added to my iTunes collection over the years.\nI have noticed that some of them are not being matched, and i am wondering what the cause is.

Can you really tell a difference? I may be developing apps with it (I haven't tried yet, nor have I ever owned a Mac), so I'd also like to hear from a developer if there is a major difference or preference between the two.\n\nA: i7 processors differ\nI assume - since you are comparing the i5 to the i7 - that you are thinking of the 13'' MBP models. The 15''-17'' MBP models offer only i7 processors.\nThe i7 processors of the 15''17'' MBP are quad core, while both the i7 and i5 in the 13'' MBP are dual core.\n2 important things to notice\n\n*\n\n*Due to hyper-threading one can also talk of 2 physical cores (4 logical cores) and 4 physical cores (8 logical cores).\n\n*The clock speed you usually see is just the base frequency. The introduced Intel Turbo Boost technology allows the cores to dynamically clock at higher speeds. However, not all cores at once.\n\nComparison chart\nAn offical Intel documentation including all features of all 4 processors can be found here. The two processors offered in the 13'' MBP are on the right.

I want to send the video output to an image wall, so the 4 monitors should show one big screen. \nWhich adapter(s) do I need for my plan?\n\nA: This device:\nhttp://www.atlona.com/ATLONA-2ND-GENERATION-USB-TO-HDMI-CONVERTER.html\nAllows up to four additional displays on a mac.  It won't run 1080p30 due to USB limitations, so you need to choose a lower resolution if you need high framerates, however it does get 10-15 frames per second at 1080p resolution, so for many applications it's suitable.  It will run 720p resolution at close to 30 frames per second.  There are other similar adaptors, but you'll have to look carefully for one that supports more than one device on the Mac. I've run into some that support multiple displays on windows, but only one on OS X.\nIt puts a heavy load on the computer though, so you'll need a new mac mini, the older ones will have trouble running more than one at a reasonable video framerate.\nAlso, no USB video adaptors that I've tested for the mac allow OpenGL or 2D acceleration.  This is likely due to Apple's restrictions on their video acceleration API - most only run in the rather limited framebuffer mode.  You can get Quicktime to display video, but you won't be able to run keynote presentations or iPhoto on the USB video adaptors.\nIf you need full video, or the software you're running requires 2D acceleration or OpeGL, you might be better of with a video splitter that takes the onboard video and splits it into several monitors.  There are many devices that do that, search google for \"video wall.\"  You'll have to settle for lower resolution, but if you're running video you probably need the framerate more than the resolution anyway.\n\nA: An old thread, but in case anyone finds this via Google, I will be a drive-by good samaritan: I'm running 4x 1920-res monitors with a 2011 mini, as the poster wishes.\nNumber one is connected via HDMI; number two is connected via Thunderbolt. These two are fast enough for movies and 3D gaming. Number three and number four are connected with two USB adapters, specifically this one: HIS Multi-View II Video Adapter HMV2-MAC-PC USB to DVI Interface (link: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16815136004 ).\nMany of the other brand USB adapters won't do 1920 (check carefully) or, as someone above said, will only do a single display from OS X, but I can confirm that one (at least) works with OS X (Mountain Lion, though I also used this setup with Lion).\n\nA: There are third-party USB to video adapters, such as this one from IOGEAR:\nhttp://www.iogear.com/product/GUC2020DW6/\nLooks like you can add up to six displays (requires onboard USB ports, hubs not supported). Seems like decent reviews at Newegg:\nhttp://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16815290006\nI've never tried any of these, so I can't vouch for how robust they are.\n\nA: You could set up two Matrox DualHead2Gos, one connected to the HDMI port and the other to the mini DisplayPort with two monitors connected to each.

Some events are showing as having 0 photos in them, others are showing far fewer photos than the event actually has.\nAfter some digging I found a pattern: the problem only affects \"referenced\" events, i.e., events where the master copies of the photos are in folders outside of the iPhoto Library. In my case these are mainly older events for which I already had folders before I started using iPhoto. For these events, iPhoto maintains an alias in the library to the original file. The original files are all there, available and editable within iPhoto.\nIf I edit a photo in one of the affected events, it then appears available for sync in iTunes, presumably because once edited, the modified photo is stored in the iPhoto Library.\nTo summarize, iTunes does not recognize any iPhoto photos which are stored outside of the iPhoto Library folder (referenced), unless that photo has since been edited in iPhoto.\nI'm using Lion 10.7.2 and the latest versions of both iPhoto and iTunes, syncing with an iPhone 4 running iOS 5.0.1.\n\nA: I've resolved the problem, and it wasn't pretty.\nIt starts with iPhoto 8 ('09) on my iMac. This library had a bunch of \"referenced\" photos, ie, photos whos image files were outside of the iPhoto Library folder. In iPhoto 8 this was handled by creating an OS X alias file in the Originals folder within the iPhoto Library folder.\nThen I wanted to move my library to my new MacBook Air running Lion and iPhoto 9 ('11). Forgetting that I had referenced files in my library I just copied the iPhoto Library folder from my iMac to my MacBook Air as the Apple support docs say (they don't mention anything about referenced files). Of course the referenced files were not copied to the MacBook, but everything appeared to be OK.\nStart iPhoto 9 on my MacBook and it upgrades the library. It can't find the referenced images of course, but there's no warning or anything. iPhoto 9 has a totally different folder and database structure. All the information it needs about where to find an image is now in the Library.apdb SQlite database file in iPhoto Library/Database/apdb/. In that db there's a table called RKMaster which stores the info about each photo. RKMaster has a column called imagePath which is where the full path of the original image file is supposed to go. However, since my referenced images were not available during the iPhoto library upgrade it just set these all to Masters/<image file name>, and stored the alias information from the iPhoto 8 database in a BLOB column called fileAliasData. When I worked out the referenced files were missing I copied them over to my MacBook, and the iPhoto was miraculously able to find them again because of the information in the fileAliasData column in the database.\nHowever, iTunes and other apps that link to the iPhoto library don't access the iPhoto Library database directly. They use a file called AlbumData.xml in the iPhoto Library folder. iPhoto 9 re-creates this file every time you close iPhoto. Unfortunately, what it uses to build the full image path for putting in the XML file is what's stored in the imagePath column in the database, which by now is basically garbage. iPhoto can see all the files OK, but nothing else can.\nThe only solution was to painstakingly fix the RKMaster records for all my referenced files so that they pointed to the correct place. I took the opportunity to copy the files to the iPhoto Library folder in the process so that now all my images are in the iPhoto Library folder. This implied setting fileIsReferenced = 0 and fileAliasData = null for those records aswell.\nNow I finally have everything working again, but it was a very long and tedious process that can only be done with some knowledge of SQL databases. Apple should really warn people about this potential problem when advising on how to move your iPhoto Library.\n", "Q: How can I partition my Macbook Pro's hard disk? I'm about to install Linux on my new Macbook Pro. In order to do this, I need to resize my Mac OSX partition to allow some free space for Linux. I've booted into the Recovery HD and started \"Disk Utility.\" I then repartitioned my hard drive, resizing the Mac partition to 100GB and leaving the rest as free space for Linux to fill. \nThe problem I'm having is that whenever I go to apply the changes, I see an error that says:\n\nPartition Failed\n  Partition failed with the error:    \nCouldn't modify partition map because the filesystem verification failed. \n\nI then verified the disk, it found errors:\nInvalid volume file count.\nInvalid volume directory count.\nInvalid volume free block count.\nVolume header needs minor repair.\nThe volume Macintosh HD was found corrupt and needs to be repaired.\n\nSo I repaired it, then verified it, and everything looked fine.\nThen I tried the partition again and it failed with:\n\nPartition Failed\n  Partition failed with the error:\nCouldn't unmount disk.\n\nThen, I try to boot into the regular OS and try resizing the partition there.\nI'm met with the errors mentioned above. Rinse, repeat, get nowhere, repeat.\nWhat's going on here? This seems crazy.\n\nA: Lion has a hidden partition which contains recovery information. Shrinking the partition, according to an Apple employee, is not supported. He hooked up my MBP to an external hard drive and wiped and reinstalled Lion in order to fix things.\nIn more detail, what happens is this: When you try and resize the main partition, it doesn't include the recovery partition. When you hit \"Apply Changes,\" it does a checksum to make sure that nothing's accessing the drive. It then gets started, doing another checksum, and discovers that something's changed, breaking the previous checksum.\n\nA: When you install Linux with Boot Camp Assistant it has a menu that helps you partition your HDD with ease. Just fire up Boot Camp Assistant, mount your install, and be on your way.\nKeep in mind that this only works if your Mac partition uses the entire HDD.\n", "Q: Setting up my AirPort Express with no ethernet cable I have a MacBook Air, and an AirPort Express. Currently, I have my AirPort Express in a different room than my wireless router.\nHow do I connect to my Airport Express wirelessly from my MacBook? When I go to the AirPort Utility, it does not find my Airport Express, and the AirPort is flashing amber/orange.\n\nA: Check what wireless networks are available. It is possible your Airport Express is broadcasting a secondary wifi network. If so, try connecting to that network and searching for base stations again.\nAs a last resort, you can perform a reset. Try a configuration reset first (hold the reset button down with the tip of a pencil for a few seconds, until the led flashes rapidly). If that doesn't work, try a factory reset, by unplugging and replugging it, holding down the reset button.\n", "Q: Brand-new MacBook pro shows grey screen with throbber in installation A good friend of mine got a new MacBook. She lives on a remote Spanish island, and I have only Chat contact with her right now.\nShe unpacked the MacBook (a pro 15-inch from this year) and walked through the first steps of the installation process. Apparently after choosing her installation language, a grey screen with a clock or throbber icon turned up. It's been there for an hour now, with no signs of actual activity (like HDD sounds). I asked her to do a hard reset (Using Ctrl + Command + Power button); this boots the machine up, but leads back to the same grey screen.\nI now asked her to do a reboot into Safe Mode, which Apple recommend in their knowledge base as the next step.\nIt doesn't seem normal for the installation procedure. It also seems terribly unlikely that the HDD would break right at that moment, doesn't it?  She is totally distraught and has nobody to help her there. Does anybody have any idea what to do, short of bringing the machine to an Apple store, which there probably isn't one on the Island.\n\nA: In verbose mode, I managed to find out that the Macbook's boot process froze at some point in the boot process. We were unable to find out why exactly - the last message logged was a complaint from SSH that it can't create a socket, which according to Apple's support resources is owed to an not yet existing internet connection. \nWe tried all reset steps (Safe boot; Verbose boot; PRAM/NVRAM reset; SMC reset) without success, but we managed to reinstall OS X from the DVD and it seems to be running fine now.\n", "Q: Does Tivoli Storage Manager for backup get the details right? I know that Carbon Copy Cloner, Time Machine, and other Mac-specific software goes to significant lengths to back up Macs correctly, with all the fiddly details right: permissions, file attributes, etc. My company uses Tivoli Storage Manager as the standard backup solution, and there's a Mac version.\nDoes Tivoli get the details right too? I.e., if I restore, I don't want to hassle with reinstalling apps or discover over a period of months that there's subtle breakage.\nI'm on Lion if that's relevant.\n\nA: I'm not sure that Tivoli gets these finer details absolutley correct.\nIn terms of backing up files and applications these are fine, but when it comes to passwords, attributes and preferences etc, then no, not always.\nI have just spoken to a pal who uses IBM systems in a Mac and PC magazine publishing environment and prefers his staff on Macs to use Time Machine as the standard back-up to their servers, rather than the PC users who use Tivol as standard.\n", "Q: \"That event does not belong to that event store\" when trying to create a new calendar event I'm trying to save a new event on iPhone calendar, but it just keeps giving me this error:\n\nCannot Save Event — That event does not belong to that event store\n\nWhat can I do to fix this?\n\nI'm using Google Calendar by default, but I get the same error even if I try to use another calendar, so I presume the fault is not in Google's servers. Never encountered this problem before – just started seeing it today. (Using iPhone 4 and iOS 5.0.1.)\n\nA: Try these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close the Calendar app completely, then retry (this worked for me) \n\n*Reboot iPhone\n\n*Try editing the default calendar setting (Settings ->\nMail, Contacts, Calendars -> Calendars)\n\n\nIf none of those helps, you could read through this apple.com thread for more tips.\n\nA: If your phone is jailbroken (and your calendar is backed up) this can be fixed fairly easily.\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off all calendars\n\n*Delete the contents of \"/var/mobile/Library/Calendar\" (you can use something like i-FunBox or iPhoneBrowser - both free). \n\n*Reboot the phone\n\n*Turn the calendars back on again\n\n\nFixed the issue for me right away.\n\nA: In my case the problem was that the cursor (or maybe \"highlighter\" is better - hard to see!) was still on another event that I had just modified.  I tried to use the \"+\" to add a second event to that day's calendar.  When I input a second event with different times, then pressed \"Done\" I got the message \"That event does not belong to that event store.\"  I think the meaning of the error message is now clear - the second event couldn't be superimposed on the first.  So in my case simply touching a different time slot on the calendar, then entering the new appointment, solved the problem.\n\nA: I went to settings, icloud, then unchecked calendars. It asked me if I wanted to delete or keep events from the cloud on my phone. I chose DELETE. I waited one minute. I rechecked the calendar to use the cloud. I looked and all the ghost \"new event\" items that couldn't previously be deleted or altered were finally gone!

What is the difference between enabling remote management and enabling screen sharing?\nApple's support article, http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4715, says:\n\nIf the Apple Remote Desktop administrator authenticates with a name\n  that is different from the user logged on at the remote computer, the\n  following applies:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*If the service was enabled by turning on Screen Sharing, the screen sharing user is presented with the option to request sharing access\n  from the user logged on at the display.\n  \n*If the service was enabled by turning on Remote Management, the screen sharing user can simply choose to share the display.\n  \n*The screen sharing user can always choose to log in to their own session.\n  \n  \n  ...\n\nIt also states:\n\nIf the remote computer's display is at the login window, the Apple\n  Remote Desktop administrator will simply share the display. This is\n  equivalent to how screen sharing works in earlier versions of Mac OS\n  X.\nA third party VNC viewer will always be connected to the login window.\n  If the login window is not on the display, a new login window is\n  started that is not shown on the display. The screen sharing user can\n  then log in with any valid account on that computer.\n\nSo, I presume that it is using the same protocol (VNC) underneath and just behaves a little different depending on which option you enable.\nWhat is Apple's remote client?  Is it the Screen Sharing app  in CoreServices (/System/Library/CoreServices/Screen Sharing.app) or is there something else I might have missed?\nLastly, what is the Mac App Store \"Apple Remote Desktop\" product ($80, http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-remote-desktop/id409907375?mt=12) and how does it differ from the above?\nThanks!\n\nA: My experience with El Capitan is that you have to configure Screen Sharing under Screen Sharing first, even if Remote Management is on, and then turn Remote Management back on again.\nPerhaps some settings were left over from an earlier version of MacOS, but without that all it gave me was 'Connection refused'.\n\nA: By default, Mac OS uses VNC combined with a few extras (e.g. auto-discovery via Bonjour) when you use Screen Sharing, and in most cases this is all an average user needs.\nFor system administrators however, there is usually a need for more control over the computers they support; therefore Apple provides \"Apple Remote Desktop\" (ARD) which offers a lot more control mechanisms (like terminal sessions, remote installation of software, remote shutdown, remote execution of automator scripts) and this is possible with groups of many computers at the same time. For this feature to work, SSH and remote management needs to be activated.\nSo in short: Screen Sharing is roughly equivalent to VNC, while Apple Remote Desktop is a \"high-end\" remote administration software which requires \"Remote Management\" to be turned on. There is also a difference in how incoming screen sharing requests are handled: with \"Screen Sharing\" enabled, if an observer connects with a user account that's different than the one currently logged in and clicks Share Display, the user needs to confirm before the screen is shared. With \"Remote Management\", the screen is immediately shared without a prompt appearing.\n\nA: same in Sierra, trying to share screen from snow leopard, the \"share screen\" button was missing at the top right where it should appear next to the \"connect as\" button.\nhave to turn off remote management, turn on screen sharing, select user with admin credentials, go to server use VNC, it works, end session,  turn on remote management which disables screen sharing, go back through Finder and the \"share screen\" button is where it should be and it works. \nweird but ok\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard short cut to edit a cell in Numbers? Back when I used Excel you could easily do all the navigation and editing on a spreadsheet with the keyboard. I could navigate around with the arrow keys and hit F2 to edit a cell and start typing.\nIn Numbers '09 I can navigate easily using the arrows then start typing to overwrite the contents of a cell. But I can't figure out how to navigate to a cell and then edit its contents without clicking on the cell with the mouse[1]. \nIs there an easy way to do this without the mouse?\n\n1 -  Okay, so I did figure out one way (⌘+C, space, backspace, ⌘+V) but it's such a hack that the mouse starts looking better.\n\nA: (⌥OptionEnter↩).\nOr just return if you've unchecked Return key moves to next cell in the inspector:\n\n\nA: There are two ways to change the content of a cell using the keyboard:\n\n\n*\n\n*Navigate to the desired cell with the arrow keys and then simply start typing. The previous content of the cell (if there was any) will be replaced.\n\n*Navigate to the desired cell with the arrow keys and the press ALT+Return. The content of the cell will not be replaced and the cursor appears at the end of the cell content.\n\n", "Q: Enable click-through, preferrably for all applications I would like to enable click-through on all windows. Is this possible on Lion?\nTo be more specific, \"click-through\" as defined by Apple in the Mac OS X Human Interface Guidelines means \"that the user can activate the item when the containing window is inactive.\"  \n\nAn item that provides click-through is one that a user can activate with one click, even though the item is in an inactive window. (To activate an item that does not support click-through, the user must first make the containing window active and then click the item.) Although click-through can make some user tasks easier, it can also confuse users if they click items unintentionally.\n\n\nA: The short answer is \"no\", there is no general way to do this.  To quote from The Mac OS X Human Interface Guidelines\n\nClick-through is not a property of a class of controls; any control, including toolbar items, can support click-through. This also means that you can support click-through for any subset of items; you do not have to choose between supporting click-through for all items in a window or none.\n[...]\nAvoid providing click-through for an item or action whose result might be dangerous or undesirable. Specifically, avoid enabling click-through for an item that:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Performs a potentially harmful action that users can’t cancel (for example, the Delete button in Mail)\n  \n*Performs an action that is difficult or impossible to cancel (such as the Send button in Mail)\n  \n*Dismisses a dialog without telling the user what action was taken (for example, the Save button in a Save dialog that overwrites an existing file and automatically dismisses the dialog)\n  \n*Removes the user from the current context (for example, selecting a new item in a Finder column that changes the target of the Finder window)\n  \n*Clicking in any one of these situations should cause the window that contains the item to be brought forward, but no other action to be taken.\n  \n  \n  Note: Programmatically, supporting click-through is a matter of disabling click-through for items that should not provide it. This is because click-through is supported by default in all Cocoa controls.\n\nIn other words, click-through is enabled (or not) on a control-by-control basis with thoughtful consideration as to the consequences of allowing it. It is not a general property of a window or the window manager. \n\nA: These Q&As may be helpful (although it's not exactly click-trough, rather auto-raise):\nFocus-follows-mouse (plus auto-raise) on Mac OS X\nAnd one recommendation was MondoMouse ($14.95, free trial)\n\nFocus Follows Mouse\nLet the mouse pointer hover over a window, and it comes to the front automatically.\n\n\nAnother question in that direction:\nFocus Follows Mouse or Sloppy Focus on Mac OS X\nWith the recommendation of Zooom/2 ($19.95, free trial)\n\nRaise Windows\nBring windows to the front by moving the mouse over the window.\n\n", "Q: How to create an application shortcut in Chrome for Mac This has been bugging me for a while, and despite googling around, I cannot seem to even find an explanation as to why the \"Create Application Shortcut\" is disabled.\n\nA: Unfortunately, the answer to your question is \"you can't,\" and the reason is \"because Google says so.\nhttp://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95710 says \n\nThis feature is only available for Google Chrome on Windows and Linux.\n\nbut there is no real explanation as to why. Nor have I found one anywhere else. It seems like an oft-requested feature, but I've never seen Google even suggest that they are planning to add it (although I presume/hope that they will).\nAlternative Solution: If you are interested in creating site-specific browsers on Mac OS X, Fluid.app works great, but (IIRC) it is based on Webkit, not Chrome.\n2013-06-27: Turns out there is a way to make Chrome SSBs on the Mac, although it's a little convoluted.\nThe instructions are too long to replicate here, and there is a shell script and/or AppleScript involved.

It once was pegged at 2 months, or perhaps 2 weeks, I can't remember.  That was over a year ago.\nI suspect it is not a very high priority with so few users even knowing what it would be good for.  I had a PC/Windows using friend try it out, not only couldn't he figure out how to set it up, but couldn't think of a good reason why it would be a great idea.\nAll the while, he was clicking away and mousing away with his 1900 button mouse that he loves so much. :)\n\nA: Fluid.app is a third-party app which provides this feature. It works great, and the free version has enough features. You can set global shortcuts, custom app icons, and lots of other stuff.\n\nA: I think the idea is that the website author creates an \"app\" in the Chrome Web Store, and then you can install that app within Chrome, and then when you open it, it opens in it's own window, with it's own icon in the dock etc.\n\nA: Or you can create an electron \"app\" from the website. \nNot nearly as simple as it should be with Chrome, but https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier makes it a bit easier.\n", "Q: OS X Lion Connection to Business network? I have a client that wants to connect an OS X Lion macbook air to his business network remotely, and I was just wondering if anyone knows of a way to do this easily. Normally, I would set up a VPN server and allow for a connection in this way, but that is not a process I can recommend to \"less techy\" people. Is there an easier (while still secure) way to set up a business network connection remotely? Thanks beforehand.\n\nA: I don't see a reason not to set up a VPN. You can add the VPN menu to the status bar and your client can simply select their VPN and enter a password when prompted. It's no more difficult than say, a TeamViewer connection setup. (In fact, VPN is arguably easier, since the system stores your username and merely prompts for a password. TeamVewer requires an ID and a password.)\nI just began using VPN this week, and it's super easy. Really. To add VPN to the status bar:\n\nThen, your client can simply click to connect, like so:\n\n(VPN info blurred for security reasons.)\n\nA: You could try programs like Hamachi or even Teamviewer which now supports VPN. They both have easy to use installers for the less tech-savvy.\nOtherwise if you have access to a Mac computer, you can create(export) a network preference file which can be double-clicked to automatically load the VPN settings.\n", "Q: What files are accessed when an app starts up? I am wondering if there is a way to see which files an application accesses (reads or writes) when starting up.\n/usr/bin/fs_usage seems like one tool, but I wondered if there are others.\nI am trying to make it easy to copy preferences between two computers, and I figured that this was one step approaching that goal, but I'm interested in the question for several reasons. I know preferences are usually kept in ~/Library/Preferences/ and ~/Library/Application Support, but how do I find out which files/folders specifically?\n\nA: I think there's a couple of options. You could use a launchd script with a WatchPaths property that triggers on those directories.\nYou can also use the command-line tool lsof to list open files of a process.\nYou can inspect open files per-process using Activity Monitor. If you click on the process and click \"Inspect\", it should bring up additional information. One of the tabs here should be for open files (see below).\n\n\nA: When I'm curious about things like this, I immediately turn to fseventer. It is essentially a GUI for fs_usage, and simply presents a list of files as they're being modified/created/deleted. In the default tree view mode, you good a nice hierarchy of files modified and their paths. In tree view, you can hover over a file or directory with a red (i) icon over it and see which application touched it.\nOver in the second tab (grid mode), you can easily see which files were modified by an application. Screenshots of each of these are on fseventer's homepage.\nThere are a lot of nice options to tailor the output to exactly what you need, such as when (if ever) files should disappear from the list, various output views, and a few more nice-to-haves.\nfseventer is free, donations-suggested; some people call it \"nag-ware\" because you have to dismiss a donation dialog on application start.\n\nA: Another option is the opensnoop DTrace script. It traces file opens and can show various details, like time (-v) and error codes (-e). You can also restrict snooping to a particular process (-n or -p). The man page (run man opensnoop) has all the details.\n", "Q: Is there a way to show a badge icon for Reminders app on iPhone?

I have an iPhone 4 running iOS 5 and an Apple Composite AV Cable. I cannot find the TV Out option that used to be under the dearly departed 'iPod' settings menu that is now gone for iOS 5. This is quite perplexing because I have been watching video off of this iPhone and operating system as recently as a week ago, on a different television, and now I cannot figure it out.\nWhere is the TV out option?

My head's about to pop off my neck.  Any suggestions on how to fix it?\n\nA: First check Region of your Apple ID:\nOpen iTunes and click on iTunes Store. In the store, click on Anmelden on the top right and enter your password. Under Apple ID Übersicht select Land oder Region ändern. Choose the appropriate one.\nThen check your system locale. You can find it under Systemeinstellungen (System Preferences)->Sprache & Text (Language & Text)->Sprache (Language). Drag English to the top of the list. This will change your system language to English.\nIf you don't want to, you could use Language Switcher to permanently or temporary to change the language iTunes starts up in. This does not affect the stores!\n\nA: If you scroll down to the bottom of the page, on the right hand side you will see a flag. This flag represents the region you are in (of the store) Click this and you are able to reselect your region.\n\nA: To change it temporarily you can scroll down and on the right you'll find a flag, click on it and choose a different region; then you'll be logged out.\nTo change the language permanently you need to go on your Account (from Spotlight, for example) and then change the Region. It will also ask to change the payment method if your credit card is a German one, you'll need to insert a british credit card or an American one. After you switch the region, btw, your list of purchased applications will be cleared, since applications - for apple - are region dependent. I think it's a stupid and terrible bug, since if you move to another country and you return your credit card you'd lose also the applications, but for Apple it is a feature since they keep this stuff like this since ages. But you can get the purchased applications back, switching back to German. But this is still unpractical since the AppStore also helps keeping apps up to date.\nThe fact I own a German credit card doesn't imply that my primary language is German, but the geniuses at Apple think it is... \nWhat can I say, AppStore, AppleId, and iTunes are the dumbest stuff I ever seen; I suppose Apple wants to excel also in being dull.

I'm looking for an editor with visible spaces and line endings as well as Dropbox support. \nAnybody know of such a product offering? \n\nA: You might want to take a look at Michael Tsai's iPhone text editor's comparison. It's not specifically for iPad, but summarizes (and he keeps it more or less updated). You have links to all the apps he mentions and a nice formatted table with the \"features\" each editor has or lacks.\nHe specifically added iPad support in the linked version of the entry: \nI’ve added rows for tracking iPad\n\nAnd of course, at the time of writing this…\n\nWriteUp, still my preferred editor, syncs faster with Dropbox than before and now supports .taskpaper files.\n\nBear in mind that Michael updates the entry every now and then. I've linked to version six, but for the sake of this AskExchange entry, you should check if there aren't new ones. Use a google search like this. If you don't know what google is, you can try this other link. ;)\n\n\nA: i currently use textastic\nit supports tabs, but not sure if you can show these as symbols on the page, as i use it for writing code.\nThere is a pdf manual on the site which may give you the information you need.\nIt has dropbox and ftp/ftps support which works really well.\n", "Q: Why is the audio volume level at 0 every time I start my Mac? I don't know if this is a bug or a feature in Mac OS X 10.7.

I don't remember changing any audio-related setting.\nIs this something I can change? I'm running Mac OS X 10.7.2 on a 2009 MacBook Pro which sometimes I connect to a 24\" Cinema display (but it seems that the behavior doesn't depend whether it's using the laptop's or the display's speakers.)\n\nA: I found the answer on AskDifferent's sister site Superuser.com: \nSnow Leopard resets sound volume whenever I start my computer\n\nIn Macintosh HD / Library / Preferences / Audio there are two audio setting files.

It has a default state which doesn't seem to have a control in system preferences and may be getting mixed up with this related but different control: \n\nNo doubt others here will know more about this than I do but I understand how a new user might be confused.\n\nA: I encountered a similar issue a few weeks ago.\nLaunch System Preferences, then select Users and Groups, and select the Login Items tab. The stray window should be in the list of programs. Delete it.\n\nA: As far as this: \"lion keeps re-opening the programs that were opened in the previous session.\" you seem to not be reading the message.\nThe preference you are setting is when you close an app and reopen it.\nYou seem to be closing the machine down and then being surprised the apps that were open when you shut it down re-open.\nRead the text you wrote above out loud slowly and I think you may see that one thing is not the same as the other.\n", "Q: iTunes keeps crashing - malloc_history possible for iTunes? So I have a problem with iTunes crashing every time I try to activate iTunes Match.\nAfter talking about 3 Hours with Apple they said I should just reinstall OSX.\nGreat. So I went looking into the problem on my own.\nIt seems that iTunes is trying to free an allocated object that couldn't been allocated before so iTunes crashed.\niTunes(2407,0x10e2f5000) malloc: * error for object 0x7fd20ab694c0: pointer being freed was not allocated\nIs it possible to activate malloc logging for iTunes?\nI want to use malloc_history to search for the problem..\n\nA: Whether it's possible to use malloc or not, this is definitely not a normal thing, so the problem is elsewhere. It certainly doesn't happen to millions of customers out there. The OS Reinstall will probably fix it, but before going that crazy, I'd try to do the usual Mac maintenance stuff. \nOne trick that usually helps me a lot is to create a blank new user and try from there. If it works, then you can start digging \"what is in my account that breaks this?\"\nStarting in Single-User also helps to diagnose stuff.\nTL;DR: something is broken, malloc won't help you much.

The thing is that iPhone 4 bootrom hasn't been hacked in order to install custom boot loader that will boot Android and, as I said before, many of iPhone 4 hardware has no drivers.\nAlso, iDroid allows you to install only 2.x at the moment. However, I have asked the devs some time ago, they told me that they're working on porting Android 4 to the iPhone 4.\nAnyway, until there are a needed bootrom hack (which also leads to untethered jailbreak, pod2g/Chronic can release it soon) and quite enough drivers you won't be able to install android on your phone.\n", "Q: iPhone keeps trying to iMessage someone who no longer has an iPhone My friend used to have an iPhone and we would talk via iMessage but when he switched to a droid it keeps trying to send him iMessages instead of SMS and the text messages take twice as long to send.

I know I can get to e.g. Desktop with ⌘+⇧+D, but what about custom folders that I have added to Favorites? Can I move which Favorite is selected up and down?\n\nA: You could use an application like Alfred or Automator services to assign shortcuts for opening folders:\n\nIf you want to open the folders over the current Finder window, you could use FastScripts to assign shortcuts to scripts like this:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    reopen -- open a new file browser window if there are no open ones\n    activate -- make Finder frontmost if the script was run with a global shortcut\n    tell window 1\n        set target to POSIX file \"/Library/\"\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nDefault Folder X allows adding custom shortcuts that work in both file dialogs and Finder.\n\n\nA: This is doable, but kind of tricky—at least as I've experienced it.  I am neurotic about optimizing my keyboard shortcuts, so I've spent quite a bit of time on this very issue.\nThere seem to be a few different ways you can go about this.  The three with which I'm most familiar are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a keyboard shortcut via System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Application Shortcuts.  This is the easiest method, but it's limited to locations which are already contained in the Finder's menu system.  e.g. I use ⌘⇧L for \"Library\" and ⌘⇧W for \"Downloads\"—but that's about all that's available via this method, to my knowledge.\n\n*Create a service (in Automator), and then assign a keyboard shortcut to trigger that service via the Keyboard section within System Preferences.  Personally, I find Automator to be maddening at times, but I think the service(s) I've set up for this are pretty solid.  (Details below)\n\n*Use an App specifically intended for controlling keyboard shortcuts.  I've tried a few, and the one that I use now is simply called Shortcuts (available via the App Store).  It's surprisingly trouble-free… and in fact, it's one of the only apps I have set to launch upon system start-up.  It has several other nice features as well—one of which I really like: using the volume keys to control volume without requiring the fn key to be pressed.  (i.e. It overrides my \"Use all F1, F2… as standard function keys\" setting—but only for my volume keys, which is great for a Photoshop user like myself.)\n\n\nNote: Invoking a shortcut from within Save and Open dialog boxes leads to different results, depending on your method.  The first 2 methods (i.e. not the Shortcuts app) have no effect whatsoever.  e.g. When saving a file, if I press ⌘⇧L, nothing happens —whereas pressing ⌘⇧H (which is built-in to the system) would take me to the Home folder.  The Shortcuts app (rightfully) has no idea when you're in a Save dialog box within another app, so invoking one of those shortcuts will actually just open up a new Finder window at that location (sometimes, smack dab in front of the dialog box you were just using.)\nFinal note:  I recently came across an app called KeyCue (perhaps when lurking on this site, actually).  To date, it's the only app I've found that provides a comprehensive overview of all your keyboard shortcuts (system and app-specific) in one place. I'd love to change a few things about the interface, but it can be pretty helpful at times.\n(Note: I tried to post a screen-cap of my Automator service for custom keyboard shortcuts in Finder; also showing a script for invoking Moom upon opening the specified folder—but was denied because it's my first post on this forum.  Will update it when possible.)\n\n\n\nA: I have had great luck with Spark. It looks like it may no longer be under active development, but so far it has done the trick with no issues. It's light, easy to configure, and FREE!\n\nA: Not to my knowledge, no.\nI would love to learn what distinguishes the system default shortcuts from those which the user creates.  It would be nice to be able to navigate to custom locations with a simple keyboard shortcut when within an Open/Save dialog window.\n", "Q: Worthwhile to reformat and re-install? I had a 2 1/2 year old Macbook Pro.  It was a 2.33 Intel Core 2 Duo with 4 GB of ram, 320 GB hard drive, running Lion.  \nAn employee of my company left and his Macbook Pro was a 2.66 Intel Core i7 with 8 GB of Ram, 500GB hard drive.  \nAt the suggestion of a friend, he said to swap my hard drive out and take the new computer, so I did it...  \nI find the new computer is running slower than my old computer for pretty much all the applications (and including booting up).  \nWould it be worthwhile to reformat the entire hard drive and do a clean install?  Side related note: Would adding an SSD help this as well?\nThanks\n\nA: Your best bet is to restore the original hard drive, it is most likely much faster than the 2.5 year old one, and then use Migration Assistant to Transfer your files to the new computer.\n\nA: First, an SSD will help. Also because you would probably do a reinstall of the OS (the other option is to clone the drive). \nBut this is not necessary. The most radical step is to reinstall the whole OS from the Recovery HD without loosing any installed software or data. Still, a backup is recommended of course.\nBut before that, I'd try first to reset the PRAM and SMC.\n\nA: My MBP is a 2ghz quad core i7 with 8gb ram, although I cloned the drive from my old iMac, which had been cloned from a 13\" MBP.\nI always thought it ran fast, until last week when I was having some issues, so I formatted and did a clean install. It's now so much faster than it ever was!\nI'd suggest that there's some system specific stuff hanging around in the install from the other system which may be slowing things down. It shouldn't be the case, but I can only say that a clean install with all of the same software installed on it, and same user files is significantly faster than almost the same install from another model Mac.\n", "Q: My iPad won't respond to anything. So I have had my iPad for about a year but I haven't used it in a few months. I've been easy on it. It has never fell or anything and now it won't work. When I hold down both buttons (or the power one) absolutely nothing happens. Also when I plug it into my computer iTunes doesn't even recognize it. What can be wrong and how can I fix it?\n\nA: Plug the iPad into the original Apple charger (the one that came with the iPad) for a few hours.  Your computer's USB port may not provide enough power if the iPad's battery is completely discharged.  The iPad charger is rated to provide twice as much charging current as a typical computer USB port.\n\nA: Sounds like time for recovery mode and a possible iTunes update.\nSo first put your device into Recovery Mode and make sure you are using the latest version of iTunes. \nIf you cannot put the device in recovery mode, head to an Apple store. If you can then plug into the newly update iTunes and follow the on-screen instructions.\n\nA: Long-Term Storage\nIf you don’t plan on using your iPod touch for more than three weeks, Apple recommends that you store it with the battery charged between 50%-75% and the device completely turned off, not just put to sleep.\nIf you store it when the battery is fully discharged, it could fall into a deep discharge state, which renders it incapable of holding any charge. Conversely, if you store it fully charged for an extended period of time, the battery may experience some loss of battery capacity, meaning it will have a shorter life.\nI'm not sure if this will apply to your situation or not, seeing as it was intended for iPod's and not iPad's, but I would think that the concept would be the same.\nThis is the apple page where I got the information from.\n", "Q: Boot Camp installs in wrong language. How can I fix this? I have a MacBook with an English keyboard running Lion in English. I used Boot Camp to download the WindowsSupport package and then installed 32 bit Windows 7 Ultimate, also in English.\nTurns out the WindowsSupport package is in German, probably because I am currently in Switzerland.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: Turns out the Apple installer installs whatever language Windows' language format is set to. I am in Zurich, I set it to German Switzerland.\nI had called Apple support, they didn't know that. Their theory was that because I had bought Lion in a German-language app store, it would download German Boot Camp updates.\nBut this is the solution.\n", "Q: Lion opens lots of windows automatically after a restart. How can I stop that? Lion opens lots of windows automatically after a restart.

A feature introduced with Mac OS X Lion.\n\n*\n\n*It restores the state of the computer when shut down. Very useful, when having to restart because of some installation procedure.\n\n*It reopens the used windows of applications. Quite useful since you do not have to navigate to a files location. Instead, just open the needed application to open the file.\n\nUnchecking the box does not have a permanent effect. This can be achieved by manual tweaking.\nDisable Resume upon login permanently\nOpen the Terminal and enter:\ncurl http://goo.gl/Z4EFC -L -s -o ~/fixlogin.sh && md5 -q ~/fixlogin.sh | xargs -I % mv ~/fixlogin.sh ~/%.sh && chmod +x ~/121dca51e66073624da420b6e1be61d9.sh && sudo ~/121dca51e66073624da420b6e1be61d9.sh ; rm ~/121dca51e66073624da420b6e1be61d9.sh\n\nThis command downloads a script and fully installs it. Voilà, you are done.\nIf you want to revert to the default behavior of resume in lion, type this.\nsudo defaults delete com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook\n\nKudos to Hexbrain who wrote the script.\n\nDisable Resume when launching apps\nYou can also disable Resume for applications on a per app basis. See these answers here.\n\nA: Just uncheck the \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" checkbox in the restart dialog.\n\n\nA: The checkbox has stayed unchecked in 10.7.4 and later versions. The release notes called it an issue, even though it was probably intended behavior originally.\n\nThe OS X Lion v10.7.4 Update includes fixes that:\n\n*\n\n*Resolve an issue in which the \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" setting is always enabled.\n\n\nThe state of applications is still restored even if Resume was disabled when applications are opened manually or as login items. Disabling LoginwindowLaunchesRelaunchApps or TALLogoutSavesState doesn't prevent that either.\n", "Q: How can I copy an email address from a text message? I got a text message, and I want to copy an email address from message context, but iOS comes to send email app, how can I copy it?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Revised for clarification. Use IOS's copy functionality to copy an email message. Press on the desired message (with email) and hold for a few seconds to bring up the Copy dialog. Click on the Copy dialog to copy the message (including email address). The entire message is copied. At that point, paste the message for further modification if desired (if it contains more than the email address).\nNote: This worked for me in iOS 5.\n\nA: At least under iOS 5 you should be able to see a blue circle with a white arrow inside next to your text message; tapping on this will bring up a list of links (if there are more than one in your message), including the e-Mail address. \nTapping on the e-Mail address will bring up the default \"Info\" page, from which you could create a new contact. \nMore importantly, on that \"Info\" page you´re now able to tap-and-hold on the e-Mail address at the top, which will bring up the \"Copy\"-Bubble.\n", "Q: Change volume of individual speaker My headphones are a bit damaged it seems and the left has higher volume than the right. It isn't my ears, the song or the device :). Is there a program to change just one speaker's volume? Lion allows you to set the balance, but I don't think this is the same thing - it would lead to the sound shifting into the left speaker, effectively reducing the stereo effect. Windows 7 can do this, but I'm not quite that desperate.\n\nA: Balancing changes the volume of both speakers at the same time.\nSince it only changes the volume, there is not manipulation of the stereo effect (sound shifting).\nFor example: If you play a track that plays on the left speaker and then shift the balance to the very right - you will not hear anything. If you play a stereo track, you will only hear the right track in the same case. This can be very easily verified using this this sample track.\n", "Q: Why doesn't Airport reconnect after sleep or shutdown? I have a MacBook Pro (2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo, running OS X 10.6.8) that does not reconnect to its stored WiFi network after it restarts or goes to sleep. To reconnect, I need to go into System Preferences and choose a network in Airport settings.  Then it happily reconnects and stays connected.\nI saw this question, and tried to delete and re-add my preferred network (I only have one). I went into Advanced, deleted the network, turned Airport off and on, and chose my network from the dropdown. It knew the password already though.\nI was going to delete/move the preferences file containing network/WiFi settings, but I can't find it.  Would this be helpful? If so, where is that file stored?  I've already looked through ~/Library/Preferences and /Library/Preferences to no avail.\n\nA: The problem got partially better on its own, and it's not clear why.  There were also a lot of old networks in the list of previous wifi networks in System Preferences, and it helped to delete them.\nThe complete fix, however, ended up being to go into the list of wireless networks (in System Preferences > Networks > Airport, Advanced) and move the desired network up to the top of the list so it was joined first.  There was one called \"linksys\" on top that was matching a neighbor's network, and then failing to get internet access for some reason; I think it was added a long time ago for a different network of the same name.\nI thought I had tried this before, but either something changed or I didn't actually try it.  I'm asking this question to help me troubleshoot someone else's computer, so I'm not aware of everything that might have changed since I originally posted the question.\n\nA: There is one famous cause of this problem - interference between bluetooth and wifi, which plagues metal Mac laptops.\nTo test if this is the source of your problems, turn off your Bluetooth via System Preferences / Bluetooth and see if the issue goes away.\nIf this is indeed the problem, the only cure (as far as I know) is to stop using Bluetooth entirely, or switch the frequency of your wireless setup to 5GHz.\n\nA: The preferences files you probably want to look at are:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.network.identification.plist\n\n*/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.eap.profiles.plist\n\n\nAs @gentmatt said, you could also try deleting the network password from your Keychain (use Keychain Access.app).\n\nA: This is also a very common side effect of the WiFi network password changing but using the same SSID.\nThe old password gets stored in the Keychain, and does not get overwritten. Or two entries for the same SSID are in Keychain.\nOnce you go into Keychain Access.app, look for 'airport network password'.  \nIf it is your WiFi network to control and nothing else works, try a new unique SSID and password.\n\nA: Does this happen to all networks or just the one you're talking about?\nIf the latter, is your box a Netgear OEM (given out free by networks?) I have one in my house from Virgin Media which rejects my 2010 pro (same spec as yours) from automatically joining, and the way I solved it was asking them for a wireless access point box (very cheap, even if you have to buy it) and wiring that into my network. It joined immediately, and had no problems.\nI also considered the possibility that there might be interference on the same channel as our network - we're in a very high-density area, so that might be causing the problem. \n", "Q: 2011 Mac Mini not working with included HDMI to DVI adapter I've got a brand new Mac Mini with a peculiar video issue.  It just won't show video using the included HDMI to DVI adapter.:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've plugged this Mac Mini and adapter into three separate DVI monitors.  No video from any of them.\n\n*The HDMI port works, and shows beautiful 1080p on my TV.\n\n*The Thunderbolt port works on those aforementioned DVI monitors using a Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter.\n\n*I've tested the HDMI to DVI adapter alone (no Mac Mini involved) and it works great.\n\n\nSo the adapter works, the HDMI port works, the cable works, and the monitors work.  Just not together, for some reason.\nOther voodoo attempted (unsuccessfully):\n\n\n*\n\n*Ran a full Software Update.  All updates have been downloaded and installed as of the time of this question.\n\n*Put the Mac Mini to sleep, then woke it back up (using the Apple Remote).\n\n\nA: Same problem here with a Specter x20G Naga III monitor. A few days ago I tried to set up a new Mac mini for my wife. There was no video from the HDMI to DVI converter. I plugged the old Mac mini (circa 2007 but updated to Snow Leopard) in and the video worked just fine. I called Apple Care, they made an appointment with me at the Genius Bar, I took the new mini in and, using the same display adapter, it worked fine with their monitor. While installing the software updates at the Genius Bar, that mini kenel panicked. So they issued me a new one.\nI brought the new mini home, plugged it in, and I had no video just like the first one. I tried a different DVI cable. No love. I tried another monitor with the HDMI to DVI converter and the video came through just fine. So I went back to the Apple store to pick up a mini display port to DVI converter. It didn't work on the Mac mini. It also did not work on my Macbook air.\nMy conclusion is that some DVI monitors just don't work with Lion. (Lion being the one commonality between my Macbook Air and my wife's Mac mini.) I ended up buying a new monitor. It works fine with the new Mac mini. I took the old monitor and set it up as a second display on my daughter's Mac mini which is still running Snow Leopard. It works great.\n\nA: The only thing that I can think of would be a monitor detection issue when it's plugging in the HDMI to DVI-D adapter. I would see if you can plug in a second monitor via Thunderbolt, and try to detect the other display(s). Otherwise, this may be a job for 1(800)MY-APPLE.\n\nA: After an unfortunate (but somewhat understandable, given the confusing nature of the issue) runaround from 1-800-APL-CARE, I managed to get a brand new HDMI to DVI adapter.  \nAfter extensive testing, it appears that the original HDMI to DVI adapter included with my Mac Mini works, with (seemingly) any device except for my Mac Mini.  The new HDMI to DVI adapter works great.  Must have been a very slight manufacturing defect in the original adapter.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my new Mac Mini, went to the Apple store and they gave me a new DVI to HDMI adapter. I asked to have them test it before I left the store but they could not come up with a monitor with a DVI port. In the end they sold me a Belkin HDMI to DVI cable for one cent, just to have the goods transfer on record.\nIn my opinion, the store personnel did not know about the problem with the HDMI to DVI cable adapters, but after a few trips to the back room, they did the right thing without admitting that there is a problem. My monitor is a ViewSonic VP1201s (1600x1200) it is a few years old. \nThe \"new\" adapter that they gave me did not work either, but the Belkin was fine.\n", "Q: App to shut down iPhone 3G Is there an app to shut down my iPhone 3G? It's a non jailbroken iPhone and the power button isn't working anymore. So I need to shut it down with an app. Any advice?\n\nA: Apps aren't allowed to access this functionality so there is no way to get this without jailbreaking.\n\nA: Don't know if this will help. I had the same problem with a 3G. I found if you squeeze the front and back of the phone, just at the on/off button whilst pressing the on/off button, then it would all work fine.  It's as if there's just a connection that's slightly come apart, which squeezing reconnects. Kept me going for months, as I waited for the 4S! Good luck. \n\nA: Challenge accepted. The best app(lication) for the job would be to let the battery run out. Problem solved.

On my iPhone 4S (iOS 5), I've set Auto-Brightness to on (in Settings -> Brightness).\nI haven't, however, seen it do anything. As far as I can tell, my brightness has never changed automatically. The screen is equally bright when I'm outside on a sunny day, or inside reading in a dark room.\nAm I misunderstanding what this option does? Otherwise, am I doing something wrong that's preventing it from working, or is this just a bug?\nMy brightness slider is set all the way to the right; Auto-Brightness is set to On.\n\nA: Try turning your iPhone's brightness slider to the middle or slightly lower, but leave auto-brightness on.  The phone will usually auto-adjust its brightness after it gets locked (display turned off) and then turned on, maybe a minute or so later, in different lighting conditions.\n\nA: The system uses the slider as the minimum brightness when auto-brightness is on. It will allow itself to go above the value of the slider, but it won't go below it. If it's all the way to the right, your screen will always be at full brightness. Try adjusting it in lower light to find a good minimum value, and then let it do its job in bright light.\n\nA: I actually just answered someone else's question that was kind of linked to this. So, if you'll forgive me for it, I'll just copy/paste my reply here, as well as post the link to the original page here.\nStart Quote:\nThe reason why the brightness bar is still an option when auto brightness is on is two-fold. First, on the lock screen, when you are putting in your code or just checking time or whatever, the IPhone/IPod Touch uses the actual brightness bar setting for the brightness on lock screen. Auto-brightness only works after you unlock the device (by unlock, i mean the point in time where you can click on apps and such).\nAlso, the brightness bar sets a quasi-minimum limit, like, if you go into a darkened room like a movie theater, the auto-brightness will dim the light, up to the level that you have your brightness bar. Kind of like the volume limit for music, except this sets a minimum value instead of a maximum. There are situations where this doesn't apply, which is why i called it a quasi-minimum limit.\nFor example, if the place you are in is like, literally pitch black (or as close to it as you can achieve, then the difference between your set level and the level the auto-detector wants it to be, is considered extreme, and the auto-detector will override the set level, and put it on the lowest possible brightness.\nHope this helps, seeing as I derived all of this from personal experience with my own usage of the IPhone 3GS and IPhone 4.\nOh, just a note, i mentioned that while on lock screen, the device will use your brightness bar settings, yeah, that only works when it's NOT on the charger. placing the device on charge will automatically put the new lock screen (the one that shows a picture of a battery) on the highest brightness setting.\nEnd Quote\n", "Q: Upgrade Power Mac G5 1.6GHz Logic Board Is it possible to upgrade the logic board in a Power Mac G5 1.6GHz? Mine recently died and I was thinking of trying to fit a more powerful board like the Dual Core 2.7GHz logic board into the case instead of just replacing with the same.  \n\nA: In general, not at all. The boards are matched to the sensors and heat sinks and the G5 line had many many revisions as the engineers presumably adjusted to the increasing thermal loads the G5 CPU would generate. \nAlso, are you prepared to run the thermal calibration routines to get the repaired\nMac properly controlling the fans?\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't do any work at the MLB level of a G5 unless I was bored and cost was no concern. The tight space means high risk of physically bending those boards and their high sensitivity to static damage means you need to be very conscious of continuous grounding. \n", "Q: iCloud Mail doesn't load, but all other iCloud services work fine I've been having this weird problem with iCloud for a while.\nIf I go to icloud.com, I can login just fine, and everything works (Contacts, Calendars, etc.), EXCEPT the Mail app. Whenever I click the Mail Icon, I get this error:\n\nWhen I click \"Report to Apple\" it gives a more detailed log, ending with this message:\nSat, 24 Dec 2011 04:13:07 GMT:  ERROR: CoreMail handled error 13002 before exiting Mail\n\nAnybody know how to fix this?\nBy the way, whenever I try to login to Mail in the Mac OS X Mail.app or the iPhone mail, I get The iCloud IMAP server “p06-imap.mail.me.com” rejected the password for user “myusernamehere”\n, even though the password is correct.\n\nA: It seems it was a temporary problem, as it now appears fixed.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro won’t sleep automatically — no process preventing sleep according to pmset.

Want to create new iCloud email address I made a foolish mistake when creating my iCloud email address.  There was a misspelling that I did not catch.  Now, my iCloud email is unacceptable to me with this spelling error.  I understand that one can not edit the email address.\nItems:  I have iPod Touch, iPod, iPhone, and iPad.\nAppleID:  I have only one.

If you haven't verify the email address that you probably can go back in and change it. Unless you just created this Apple ID hours ago  and can walk away from it and just create a second one that is correct, Apple asks for many other pieces of information such as birthday security questions to factor in front Acacian that would allow you to change the one piece of information that's wrong.\nThe second is to engage Apple customer support. The Apple support webpage will channel you to iCloud account support staff and it will typically be a web form where you can place your correct contact information and explained the mistake you made. They might be able to assist you with things that you can't do for yourself. Additionally, they speak many languages and can often educate you about your options better than a catchall procedure on the Internet can. \n\nA: Unless I mis-understand the problem, I think you can edit your email address:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log into iCloud.com\n\n*In the upper right-hand corner of the home screen, click on your name.\n\n*In the dialog that appears, click on the AppleID box which contains your contact email address. A new web-page appears.\n\n*Click the Manage Account link on the right hand side of that page.\n\n*Sign in (again) on this page with the same credentials (e-mail & password). Your name and your email address will both be presented with a link to edit each.  On the left side of this page will be links to edit your password and other account information.\n\n\nA: Sorry your out of luck, this is a much required feature, especially as in the developer beta there was no confirmation of email address. All you can do contact Apple and tell them people want this, and hope that they implement it, like they finally implemented like deleting photos from photostream. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro shuts down when unplugged I have a late 2008 MacBook Pro work computer.

I have been working on an iMovie multimedia (picture, music, titles, etc.) project for six months using iMovie '09. Six months later it is not allowing me to further add anything to the project, and iMovie keeps crashing on me. I decided to stop, and burn it to iDVD. I have now tried at least 3 times to export project to iDVD to burn this disk, and after two hours of supposed copying; I come back to my computer to find out iMovie \"Quit Unexpectedly\"! The project is approximately 200MB. I just deleted the iDVD preferences playlist, and did verfy and repair disk permissions in Disk Utility.  Any ideas on what to do next?\n\nA: I would start by checking out Software Update to make sure that there are not any current updated for iMovie '09. I would then just try to export the project in a resolution of your choice to the desktop (or wherever you prefer), and just use Disk Utility to burn it from there. This will make sure that you at least have a hard backup of the project, and this may be more effective as you're not trying to run two programs at once (as iMovie is transferring to iDVD). This is key as your system may not have enough RAM to do two high-end processes at once (I don't know your system, so this is only an assumption). This being said, I would try to make sure that you have the fewest amount of programs running during this time period I would then try to take the exported project from the desktop, and throw it into iDVD to burn it with the menus of your liking. I hope this helps, and let me know if you have any more questions.\nNote: If you are on a laptop make sure it's plugged in, and that you are running a program like Caffeine to keep it from falling asleep during this process.\n\nA: This trick worked on older iMovie versions. I don't know if that's still the case for iMovie'09 and I don't have it at my desk.\nYou could try to browse your iMovie project from the Finder, delete all the rendered files (transitions, titles, filters). Your project file size may shrink. If it didn't break everything, iMovie will recalculate the render clips. Maybe the disc burning process is failing to process and burn one of those clips.\n1 - Quit iMovie since my workaround is done in the Finder. \n2 - Very important : duplicate your project file (right-click in the Finder) so you'll have a backup copy if something ever goes wrong.\n3 - Right-click on your project file (located in the Movies folder in your Home folder) and select \"Show packaged contents\"\n4 - Look for any Render folders inside the project, and delete every file inside this folder.\n5 - Close the Finder window and double-click on your modified project to launch iMovie\n", "Q: iTunes Home Sharing I want to transfer my entire iTunes library from old laptop to my new laptop.\nI want to use Home Sharing for the same..Since the data is almost about 15 GB, I would like to use Home Sharing over a local network (and not through internet).

You plug it in, start iTunes, click Upgrade and that's it!\n\nThat's what I thought before starting the process. After all, it's Apple we're talking about, right?\nNot quite.\nI am trying to upgrade my father's iPad 1 to iOS 5 using a brand new Windows 7 profile on my laptop. I plugged the iPad in, and it complained because the relevant Windows service was down.\nAn UAC elevation and a trip to the services interface later, iTunes informed me that if I didn't transfer purchases to my computer I'd lose them, and asked me if I wanted to continue. Continue to what, upgrading or transferring?\nA cancel and a right click on iPad → Transfer purchases later, iTunes told me that the upgrade would wipe the iPad completely clean and that I'd need to sync everything beforehand, and asked me if I wanted to continue... doing what? Upgrading while losing all the data or doing syncronization?\nNow I'm stumped. The iPad \"tabs\" show all sync options are disabled. When I enable them, iTunes warns me that by doing that the iPad content will be replaced by the computer content, which would be absolutely nothing.\nSo, here's my apparently simple question. I'm really surprised I have to ask...\nHow can I upgrade an iPad (or an iPod) to a newer version of iOS using a brand new computer without losing data in the process?\nIs a backup what I want perhaps? Would a backup include the current version of iOS, making the restoring process undo the upgrade in the first place?\n\nA: First, make sure that iTunes is signed into the iPad owner's Apple account. It is best if this is done in a separate login account on the computer so you do not loose any of your saved apps and backed up data.\nThen from there once you plug it in to a full backup to the computer, no upgrading yet! Always do a full backup before an upgrade. Once backed up go and do the upgrade. This will wipe all data on the iPad! Once the update is installed, it will then restore all the prior apps, data, music, movies, pictures and books the tablet.\nAfter that, everything should be golden.\n(This is based on my experience upgrading an iPhone 4 from iOS 4 to 5.)\n\nA: In addition to iTunes syncing,  iCloud allows a backup and then you can restore it to the same device or another. It can be backed up anywhere there is WiFi I believe.\n", "Q: Preview: Fullscreen movie turns black after 5s When I open a movie in preview (tested with .mov and .wmv), and I go to full screen, the movie turns black after five seconds, unless I keep moving the mouse.

It highlights 80 different file formats but not Django templates (you can edit them like it's just html).  \n2) GitHub supports online editing for any files under version control using their Ace Editor (of course it's not an app and it doesn't support mercurial yet, but anyway if you like DVCS you should like Git and their Hub too :).\n3) Python for iOS. That's what you need for mercurial and Django right? But, \nPython is scriptable language which is distributed under GPL compatible licence so Apple can just remove this appх from their App Store (because they don't like scripting stuff on their iOS devices and they hate GPL licence)\n\n1 That's mainly because it's too amazing to exist.\n", "Q: How do I rebuild my HDD/SSD from scratch without Time Machine on MacBook Pro? Ok let me try and sketch the situation;  \nHardware\nMacBook Pro 17 inch (Early 2011), 1x 750 GB HDD + 1x 140 GB SSD\nOS\nLion\nJust after I purchased my MacBook Pro I swapped the 750 GB drive for the 140 GB SSD and that worked well for a while. Obviously this setup was a bit limited in terms of drive space especially since I started using the machine privately and for work through the use of Parallels virtual machines. I removed the optical drive and installed the old 750 GB drive to provide the additional space.\nNow here is where it gets a bit messy. Because I wanted to use this machine for work, I decided it would be a good idea to turn on drive encryption (for the 750 GB HDD but not the SSD) using Lion which was easy. But then, a while later and in my infinite wisdom, I moved the /Users directory from the SSD to the HD and that's where the trouble began.\nNow I want to make a clean start and copy all data to my 1TB USB 2.0 and then rebuild the entire machine using the Lion recovery flash drive which I already have.\nMy plan was as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot OS X into Recovery Mode\n\n*Log in as test user (that I won't need after cleanup)\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*su to root\n\n*rsync -avz /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD /Volumes/1TBHD/Backup_MacHD\n\n*rsync -avz /Volumes/Data /Volumes/1TBHD/Backup_DATA\n\n*Disk Utility --> Format HDD --> Format SSD\n\n*Reinstall OS\n\n*Reboot to newly installed OS\n\n*Try and piece it back together using data from /Volumes/1TBHD\n\n\nI got as far as 6 but when I checked user and group ownership I already noticed some discrepancies... not a great start as I had thought that rsync -avz as root would certainly preserve that sort of stuff.\nWhat I am looking for is confirmation that the above is workable or even better, a more straight forward and success assured approach.\nThanks for taking the time to read this and give me your thoughts and suggestions!\n\nA: If the Users directory on the SSD is the same, ie., you haven't changed files, etc., then it is still the Users directory that the OS is using. However, if you did some terminal magic to make this transition I could see where things would get a bit hairy.\nI'm not as familiar with the terminal, but I can tell you what I would do in this situation. I'd clone disk images of each drive to the TB using Carbon Copy Cloner or some similar piece of software. At least as a disk image you'll maintain the integrity of the files - I'm not sure how this is effected via encryption though. It may not even work.\nIdeally, you'd reinstall OS X on the SSD and then use your Terminal magic to move the Users directory to the HD - if that is still your plan - mount the disk image files and move files accordingly, this should help with permissions. Again, I'm not sure how the encryption works into this either. And I've not seen many instances where moving the Users directory didn't result in some kind of mess. If you can keep it on the drive with the system, I think that would be best. \nBTW - Lion should've installed it's recovery partition locally when you did the original install. \nPerhaps not much help - but some things to think about. \n\nA: There is a quick and dirty way of doing thing and oddly enough it will be the cleanest. \nI recommend cp'ing everything onto your external volume. Just get everything over there and make sure the sizes of the folders match. \nI also recommend then to chmod -R 7777 on that volume so that you can carry, copy, and do whatever you need to when the time comes later.\nOnce your file are transferred and chmod'd, erase the drive you want to be used for the OS and install a fresh OS. Set up the new user account and drag over the items you need where you need them.\nOnce all that is said and down, reboot to the installer and reset permissions and ACLs for the main drive and that would reset things back to 700 for the ~ folder and fix any lingering things.\nThis is coming from YEARS of fixing this kind of a mess for people (strangers, friends, and family). You can take what you want but it is better to reduce the steps and keep things simple. Starting fresh will prevent issues down the line. Trust me!\nAll the best!\n", "Q: Why does the iPhone 4S weigh more than the iPhone 4? It's been commonly noted that the iPhone 4S looks the same, but that its internals have been upgraded. Despite that, the iPhone 4S weighs more.\nWhat causes the added weight?\n\nA: Just because internal hardware has been upgraded, this does not mean that the phone will not weigh more.\nAfter all, upgraded hardware is different hardware.\nStill, if that is not sufficient to you take a look at the teardown of the two phones. You will see that the internal design differs, which can cause weight difference.\n\n\n*\n\n*teardown iPhone 4\n\n*teardown iPhone 4s\n", "Q: Why won't my macbook pro wake up when docked? I got a HengeDock for Christmas.  When I close my Macbook Pro and dock it to the external monitor, mouse, and keyboard, it will not wake up.  I move the mouse around and type on the keyboard, but it stays asleep.  Is this because I have a non-Apple monitor (I have a Sumsung -- highly rated by Consumer Reports).  Is something set incorrectly in my preferences?\n\nA: According to Apple's kbase article HT3131, your machine must be plugged into power for clamshell mode to work. \n", "Q: Can I add personal info to my iPod touch's lock screen? My dad just got a new iPod Touch, and he'd like to add his personal info to the lock screen. If possible, how do I do this (without jailbreaking)?\n\nA: You can do this simply by opening up the Notes app, Adobe Ideas app, or anything of the like. Add your father's information in either of those applications to your liking. Take a screenshot of the final image by pressing the Home button and the Sleep/Wake button at the same time, or save the image to your Photos if that option is available within the app of choice itself. Go to Settings -> Wallpaper -> select the image you just captured/created, and then save it to your Lock Screen. Rejoice!\n\nA: I did some research and came up with several paid apps.\n\nAll of these apps does not automatically update the lock screen (weather, calendar, etc portions). Some of them will send you a scheduled reminder to update the image, then opening the app, you'll be able to update the image.\nReading some reviews, many users bought these apps thinking they would get something that you simply can't do with non jailbroken devices: automatic lock screen updates.\n\nLock Screen\nIt adds not only personal info, but weather and calendar notifications to the lock screen:\n\n\nScreen Maker\nAdds a lot more than just the lock screen. It also allows you to make changes to the home screen as well:\n\nIf Found Lock Screen\nSimple and easy...adds personal info to the lock screen. I think this may be what we'll go with.\n\nSmart Lockscreen creator\nAdds a little more functionality than the rest...calendar, weather, quotes, etc.\n\n\nA: The easiest way to go about this without jailbreaking is to use some custom wallpaper.\nMake a new document in Photoshop, Pixelmator, GIMP, or your editor of choice.\nFind a high-resolution image on the Web that you like and copy it into the document. Crop it to 640 x 960 pixels.\nAdd some text with your personal info over the image. Make sure that you leave ~225px space at the top of the image and ~150 at the bottom (these will be covered by the unlock UI). A subtle drop shadow can help make the text easier to read.\nExport the image is a JPEG or PNG.\n\nUse your preferred method to get the photo onto your iPod (sync with iTunes, email to yourself, Dropbox app, etc.).\nOn the iPod, go to Settings-> Wallpaper and select your custom image. You can set it as wallpaper for only the lock screen or the lock screen and home screen.\nYou'll now have custom text on the lock screen:\n\n", "Q: What is a typical transfer rate for a Time Machine backup over FireWire? I am doing a TM backup for the first time to a portable disk from my macbook Pro(mid 2010) over a firewire connection (both ends).\nThe disk only contained a folder of around 20GB of manually backed up stuff before I decided to TM to it (left the folder). Now it's only done exactly 580MB in 30 mins (around 19.33Mb/min) is this normal?\n\nA: Turns out that the problem was that the disk wasn't empty. Formatting the disk and starting again solved the problem.\n", "Q: Adobe Flash Player ungodly slow in OSX I have the mid-2009 Macbook Pro (Core 2 Duo, 2.53 Ghz, 4GB RAM, OSX 10.7.2), and use the most recent version of Chrome. However, it seems every time I visit a website with Flash, whether it be Youtube, or a site with a simple Flash advert, Chrome and sometimes all of OSX lock up for up to two minutes with the SBBOD, and then spontaneously returns to a normal state.\nI've tried Safari, with the same problem occuring. I don't think it's a Lion problem since I've been plagued with this since Snow Leopard. I've mitigated the problem a little bit with Flashblock for Chrome, but still - when I actually need to load something in Flash, the computer locks up again.\nAdditionally, the computer gets very, very hot when playing Flash video, it gets even hotter than some really CPU intensive tasks -- like After Effects rendering. I probably can resolve this with a complete re-install, but will wait to do that as a last resort. That's without knowing if the problem will come back.\nHas anyone had similar experiences, and can you offer a fix without reinstalling everything? Is it not an isolated problem, and OSX simply hates Flash?\n\nA: I've been trying to figure this out for a while.  Here's the answer:\nChrome has a flash player built into it, and it updates automatically.  Other browsers use an external flash player.  If you're like me, you have flash player installed outside of chrome for other browsers.  Chrome doesn't seem to handle this very on it's own, but you can disable one or the other by going \"about://plugins\" in chrome, expanding the details (+ details at the top right), and finding the flash section and clicking disable on one or the other.\nIt doesn't seem to matter too much which one you use, but turning one off dramatically improves flash performance and overall memory usage for me.\n\nA: I would try to reinstall Flash here. Should fix your problem.\n\nA: I also head this problem before on my MBP late 2007. This problem is gone now. However, it was only with Flash in Chrome. \n\n\n*\n\n*Fully uninstall Adobe Flash using  Adobe Flash uninstaller.\n\n*Fully uninstall Chrome using AppCleaner.\n\n*Repair Permissions using Disk Utility.\n\n*Reinstall Chrome. Disable all extensions. Try surfing websites with Flash. Chrome has flash support build-in.\n\n*Reinstall flash. Check for updates in the preferences.\n\n\nA: This question is old but the problem persists.  on my late 12 core i7 Mac Mini (SSD, 16GB) Chrome would become extremely slow.  Menu meters indicated close to 100% CPU utilization.  I traced it down to the Flash plugin in Chrome. Unfortunately the only solution I found was to completely disable the plugin.  After doing this I noted that CPU utilization, even idle utilization is lower and I don't encounter computer slowing spikes.  I suspect that even the Chrome Helper app is made more efficient by disabling flash.  \nIf I encounter a site that needs Flash, I use Safari.  This is a pain, but I was unable to  find another solution.  As a bonus a lot of web sites now load ad free...\n", "Q: Can I pre-download iOS update for iPad? I purchased  an iPad for my parents who live 2 hours drive away from me.  The only internet connection they have is the 3G sim chip in their iPad.  I want to apply the iOS 5 update, but in order to download it the iPad seems to be required to be plugged in to my iTunes, which is really inconvenient.  I also would ned to provide my laptop with a wifi connection from a hotspot on my iPhone, which does not seem stable enough long enough to download the iOS update.\nIt would be so much easier if I could download the update while at home over my fast fiber optic network connection, then drive the two hours and apply the update.\nIs this even possible?\n\nA: When iOS is updated, an .ipsw file that is downloaded from Apple's servers by iTunes. You can find direct links to them at iDownloadBlog.\nAt your parents' house, to update iOS, plug their iPad into a computer and launch iTunes. Then click it in the left sidebar and hold down the ⇑ Shift key while clicking on the Restore button. This brings up an open file dialog; simply look for the .ipsw file you downloaded and open it. \niTunes will tell you that the iPad will be wiped and restored, just click OK and give it time to update. You'll be asked whether you want to start again or restore from a backup when the process finishes; choose the newest backup and the previous data on the device will be loaded back on.\n", "Q: Install iOS device drivers on Windows without installing iTunes I have a Windows PC that doesn't have iTunes installed, because I don't want it. But I still want to be able to use other software to transfer data from my iPad, which means I need the drivers for it. \nApparently, they only install with iTunes, but is it possible to install them standalone, with no other software needed?\n\nA: I found this tip from DiskAid website:\nYou need to manually install the required driver, the \"Apple Mobile Device Support\" or AMDS.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the iTunes installation package from the official Apple Website.\n\n*You need a program that can open a CAB file and extract contents from it. 7-zip or WinRar can do it.\n\n*Inspect the content of the iTunes installer iTunes64Setup.exe (that you downloaded in step 1) with 7-zip (right click, 7-zip, Open archive). 7-zip will show the files inside that installer file.\n\n*Extract AppleApplicationSupport.msi and AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi from the installer file to harddisk.\n\n*Run AppleApplicationSupport.msi and then AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi.\n\n\nAfter AppleMobileDeviceSupport64 is installed, windows should be able to detect the iDevice.\n\nA: Old thread but it is still a common \"issue\" of Apple\nYou can install the free drivers provided by Copytrans company\nGo \"Downloads\" page and download \"CopyTrans Drivers Installer\"\nhttps://www.copytrans.net/download/\n", "Q: Why isn't my iPod touch's calendar showing up in iCloud? I have enabled iCloud for my iPod touch and enabled Calendar sync, but my calendar events aren't showing up in iCloud when I login, even after I've manually backed it up to iCloud.

I have an iphone4 and I have never locked the phone or set a passcode, but for some reason, the phone is now requiring a 4 digit passcode and will not let me do anything but unlock it without the passcode. I have tried a couple but each time the phone locks and wont let me try again for several minutes. Is there any way to fix this?\n\nA: *\n\n*Has anyone else had access to your phone and played a prank on you? You should ask people who may have had access to your phone what passcode they set.\n\n\n*Does iTunes still let you sync? Normally if iTunes has never seen your phone before a passcode is put on it, it requires you to unlock the phone first. But if it had previously seen the phone locked, it may let you sync your phone to do one last backup of your data, because;\n\n\n*If there is no way can regain access to your phone, you must restore it.\nThere are two ways of doing this:\nThe easy way is, if iTunes lets you plug in your phone and click 'restore', then do that. Again, please bear in mind that you WILL LOSE ALL UNSYNCED DATA when doing this, see note #2.\nOtherwise, you must put your device in 'DFU' mode in order to forcefully recover it. Again, because this is absolutely even more important:\nAfter entering DFU mode there is absolutely no way to get out of it, as soon as you follow these instructions you will be on the road to completely restoring your phone. Again, see the previous bold/italics and Note #2.\nPer Apple's Unable to update or restore support article (note also that you can click on the images in order to view them larger in this answer):\n\nWhile pressing and holding the Home button, reconnect the USB cable to the device. The device should turn on.\nNote: If you see the screen pictured below, let the device charge for at least ten minutes to ensure that the battery has some charge, and then start with step 2 again.\n\nContinue holding the Home button until you see the \"Connect to iTunes\" screen. When this screen appears you can release the Home button:\n\nIf necessary, open iTunes. You should see the following \"recovery mode\" alert:\n\nUse iTunes to restore the device.\nIf you don't see the \"Connect to iTunes\" screen, try these steps again. If you see the \"Connect to iTunes\" screen but the device does not appear in iTunes, see this article and its related links.\nAdditional Information\nNote: When using recovery mode, you can only restore the device. All user content on the device will be erased, but if you had previously synced with iTunes on this computer, you can restore from a previous backup.

Has anyone tried connecting the latest mac mini to a VGA monitor?\n\nA: Why use DVI-D as an interface? Your machine already has an HDMI and Thunderbolt port, and Apple recommends using a VGA adapter on the Thunderbolt port for that.

I've got an iPad running iOS version 4.x and I want to upgrade to iOS 5 but I'm currently in the middle east. iPads in the middle east don't have FaceTime installed on them. I'm a little worried that if download the latest version of iOS the apple update site would notice my IP address and give me a version of iOS without FaceTime.\nIs the version of iOS downloaded for an update based on location/ip address or device serial number?\n\nA: AFAIK, hardware wise they are all the same (well outside of storage and 3G) it is serial number that determines some features. The serial number has a country code in it and the update process can determine which applications need to be removed. If, for example the SN country code is in the EU, the volume has to be limited and the radio has to be adjusted for differences in Wifi channels.\n\nA: If you want to download using a US IP, you can use a VPN service to acquire a US iP.\nHotspotshield is free (ad-supported): http://hotspotshield.com/\n\nA: I updated my iPad and still have FaceTime so I can only assume that it's linked either to the devices serial number or the currently installed OS.\n", "Q: app that reminds to take a break at times I am looking out for an app (for Mac OS X) that reminds to take a break (gives out a message) at pre-scheduled time. \nFree (or low cost) app will do, as I don't want to spend my hard earned cash on this simple app.\n\nA: There is one such tool I know, called (unsurprisingly) Time Out.

Does Macbook Pro not provide power modes (Power Saver, High Performance, etc) like a Windows laptop?\nIf there is nothing like that, then I'd assume that OS X manages optimal settings itself.\nOr is there something which I'm missing?\n\nA: There are no build-in power modes in Mac OS X. Still, the standard configuration in Mac OS X in combination with the high capacity batteries used in the MacBooks offers quite good battery life.\nIf you want to optimize your energy usage, you need to manually tweak settings.\nHere's, what OS X offers to save power:\nSystem Settings -> Energy Saver\n\n\n*\n\n*dim display when using battery\n\n*display/computer sleep\n\n\nSystem Settings -> Display\n\n\n*\n\n*Automatically adjust brightness\n\n\nSystem Settings -> Security & Privacy\n\n\n*\n\n*disable remote control infrared receiver\n\n\nMenubar\n\n\n*\n\n*Wifi Icon -> disable Wifi\n\n*Bluetooth icon -> disable Bluetooth\n\n", "Q: iPhone 4S photos app not working I got my iPhone 4S a week ago since I got it, it seems I can't open the photo app.\nI can't see the pictures I have taken.

I am writing code in various text editors with Finnish keyboard layout. Sometimes I press alt+spacebar accidentally when writing symbols. E.g.\n  if(foobar || foobar2) {\n\n... there is a high change I type pipe+pipe+magical alt-spacebar character.\nThe thing is, this alt+spacebar character is invisible like space, but behaves differently. Mainly it breaks code syntax in various occasions. However, because the character is invisible it is hard to track down.\nWhat is this alt+spacebar character?\nIs it possible to disable it so that when you press alt+spacebar it would type in a normal space?\n\nA: optionspace inserts a non-breaking space (NBSP, U+00A0) by default.\nWhat I've done I've set my editor highlight the non-breaking space, so that I see when I accidentally enter it.\nYou could remap ⌥␣ to a normal space by creating ~/Library/KeyBindings/ and saving a property list like this as DefaultKeyBinding.dict:\n{\n    \"~ \" = (insertText:, \" \");\n}\n\n", "Q: Keeping emails on the server when using an iPad 2 for email I am considering buying an iPad 2 mainly for email on-the-hoof. I use my main PC as the central machine for email, so does the iPad have the option to mirror what is on the email server, rather than download and delete? That way I can get emails as I travel but the originals would still be on the main PC when I return home.\n\nA: The iPad supports 2 Mail mechanisms that allow you to do this, IMAP and Exchange.\nBoth of these mechanisms allow the server to control the status of mail messages, whether they are read/unread etc, what folders they have been moved into.  If you use either of these mechanisms then you can expect to see basically the same content no matter what you use to view the mail on.\nThe key is what email service you use, as to whether it supports IMAP or Exchange, or something older like POP3 that will now allow such consistent mail states.\niCloud accounts from Apple effectively use IMAP behind the scenes.  GMail can be configured to use pretty much any mechanism, and so can also be happily used.\n\nA: Yes.  You can configure it to not delete email from the server.\n", "Q: How can I post to Twitter using Siri?

I download some app. It's crap, so I delete it, by clicking the 'x' when the icons start wobbling.\nSome time later, I turn on my mac, and iTunes starts syncing with my iPhone. For some reason, iTunes copies the APP I DELETED over to my iPhone, so I have to delete it again. Only when I delete it again will it stop copying it.\nI find it hard to believe this is a design decision. It would be understandable to keep the app on my computer, but why does it copy it over to my iPhone even though I deleted it there?\nSpecs: latest version of iTunes on latest version of Lion, and latest version of iOS on iPhone 4.\n\nA: The issue here is to do with the Automatic Downloads feature of iTunes and iOS. I believe (not 100% sure) that when you update to iTunes X and iOS 5 the feature to automatically sync apps between devices is enabled by default, and it is up to the user to disable it. \nBasically, when you download an app with this feature enabled, it will download a copy to your computer also. You can then delete this app from the iPhone, but however it will remain on iTunes.\nNow, when you plug your iPhone in, there is another setting that means the deleted app will be sent straight from iTunes back onto your iPhone. Navigate to the App section in the iPhone tab when it is connected in iTunes, and beneath the list of apps that will sync there is an option to 'Automatically sync new apps.' This causes iTunes to send that app it copied when you originally downloaded it from your iPhone straight back onto your iPhone. So, to fix your problem, deselect this. \nIf you want to disable the automatic app downloads completely, in iTunes go to Preferences - Store - and deselect the 'Apps' checkbox. On the iPhone, navigate to Settings - Store, and do the same. \n", "Q: What folders should I be backing up? Are there any I should avoid? I'm in the process of configuring a cloud backup for my OS X machine and am trying decide what folders to back up and whether there are any folders I should avoid. \nI have complete control, by folder, over the frequency of backups, and can \"seed\" the backup locally (so the size of the initial backup is not an issue). My question is about (1) whether there are certain folders I want to be sure not to miss (e.g. they contain settings or history that it would be a bother to recreate) and (2) whether there are other folders that are best avoided (e.g. it is either more convenient or safer to \"restore\" their contents from other sources, such as a reinstall). And, as with all backups, a dimension of interest is the degree to which backing up a given file or or folder will cause frequent large backups of things that don't matter much. \n\nNote that this is not intended as a \"bootable image\" backup, but rather as complete a backup as necessary for any restore other than a bootable image. Note also that I have access to all files on the machine, including hidden ones.\n\nA: What not to miss really depends on your apps and the data you commonly interact with. Can't help without more info there...\nIt's good to at least take Apple's guidance into account when excluding backed up items, they've had a regularly updated exclusion list for TimeMachine, which it consults when setting up a backup:/System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/StdExclusions.plist\nIt includes pretty nice comments recently, and calls out per-user directories to avoid. When it comes to the rest of ~/Library, though, I'd leave everything except what Apple excludes in, as it's usually a relatively small amount of data besides mail.\nWith the speed of disk and internet being pretty luxurious, the times I edit large video being relatively few, and applications with large bundle formats being more intelligent about flagging their data as modified, I think you don't have much to explicitly avoid, per se.\nIf you think you can trust .zip, .pkg and .dmg extensions to be re-downloadable, you may want to exclude those file types from the Downloads folder, I find myself editing things I've downloaded and being lazy about moving them to a better location, so I leave the entire folder in.\nI'd kill the .ipsw and .ipa file types (unless you're an iOS developer or have apps that are no longer available through the store, I guess), or exclude those sections from iTunes Media, as they can be quite large and are only a convenience to cache locally, and become out of date really quickly in most cases.\nDepending on how much you trust cloud sync services like Box, Google Drive or Dropbox's restore capabilities you may decide to exclude those as well.\n\nA: There are two library folders on OS X. One is your user level library folder which is ~/Library and the other is the system level library at /Library. Although most of the preferences will be in your user level library, some programs save their files in the system library. For example, Microsoft Office will save preferences in the system library. I recommend backing up both even though you will never restore most of the files from the library backup (but you never know which ones you might need).\nWith regard to the Applications folder, yes you should back it up too, as most Mac apps are standalone apps, installed by copying them to the Applications folder, so they will work normally if you restore them just like any other files. Let's say you downloaded an app 2 years ago and over these two years that app may have undergone several updates that the app on the original .dmg won't include, therefore it would be preferable to back up the current version rather than the two year old .dmg. You should leave out apps that come as part of OS X though, in case the version of OS X differs when you restore your backup.\n\nA: Some people recommend backing up your entire ~/Library folder. But I find there are a lot of things in there I wouldn't want replaced if doing a clean install. So I selectively back up certain contents of that folder, along with certain contents of the system level /Library folder.\nYou should poke around in ~/Library and see what's in there that you need. Here's a list of what I backup to get you started:\n~/Library/Application Support and ~/Library/Preferences are where most of your application settings live. You should go through each of those folders' subfolders and see which ones you need.\nNotably, Address Book's database is stored in an Application Support subfolder while some other Mac OS preinstalled apps have their folders directly at the ~/Library level. It's a good idea to look through the folders at that level as well. For example:\n~/Library/Mail has your Mail.app data.\n~/Library/Calendars has your iCal data.\n~/Library/iTunes has all your iOS device backups and iTunes specific scripts.\n~/Library/Scripts is probably where you install scripts if you use AppleScripts as folder actions.\n~/Library/ScriptingAdditions holds any AppleScript additions you've installed.\n~/Library/Keychains is the default location using Keychain Access to save passwords.\n~/Library/Fonts for all fonts installed for the current user.\n~/Library/ColorSync for all color profiles installed for the current user.\n~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist has your Safari bookmarks. The other stuff in this folder is a good example of what I'd like to NOT be restored after a clean install.\nThe structure of the system level /Library folder closely matches that of the ~/Library folder, so if there are things in there (fonts, color profiles, scripts etc.) installed \"for all users\", you should back those up too.\nHope that helps you get started!\n", "Q: Activating my unlocked iPhone 4S using a Friend's SIM temporarily So I bought an unlocked iPhone 4S and im stuck at activation. I just want to get into the phone, get some apps and other stuff via Wifi. \nMy friend has an unlocked iphone as well, can I put his SIM into my iPhone to get through activation and then remove it ?\nWill that affect my phone or soon to have SIM ? Will that affect his SIM or his iPhone ?\nThanks !\n\nA: Yes. No it won't affect your phone.\nAn iPhone requires a SIM to activate. If the phone was locked to a specific carrier, it would require a SIM from that respective service provider. Since your iPhone is factory unlocked, any SIM (provided it's a micro-SIM) will suffice for activation. SIM cards to do not affect your device. You could get SIM cards from Fido, Rogers, Bell, AT&T, and Verizon and use each one every hour if you wish. This is why \"world phones\" (devices that are not locked to a specific carrier) are appealing to those that travel. They can use one SIM card in North America, for example, and another one in Asia during their travels.\nSIMs only allow your device to connect to the carrier's towers, that is all. That's what SIMs are for, to talk to the carrier and say, \"Hey, I'm authorized to be here.\" Older technology (CDMA) required direct device activation. This meant having to call the carrier and get the device activated. Should you change your device, you would have to call again to activate the new one. SIM cards (for the newer GSM network) solved this problem by registering the SIM and not the device. Once a SIM is registered, any device its plugged into has access to that network.\n", "Q: Make a bootable Lion disk for fresh start I just bought a used MacBook Pro from a friend.

I set up my email into the iPad 'Mail' app, and I cannot find how you log out to prevent another user from opening and reading my mail.\nIs it possible to log out of 'mail' on the iPad?\n\nA: As far as I know, this is not possible. iPad is not made to be a multi-user device. I am in a similar situation myself as I share the iPad with my wife but haven't yet fixed it. Some alternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set a different account as default account in Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars. It could even be a dummy account. At least it means email will not be sent accidentally from your address.\n\n*In Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > [Your email account], you can turn off Mail temporarily. It does not provide any security though, anyone can just turn it on again.\n\n*If you want to guarantee security, you need to use something like Gmail in Safari and login and logout every time.\n\n\nA: You can turn a mail account on/off as explained by RipperDoc (Settings -> Mail,Contacts,Calendars).\nOn the iPhone, you can also turn off the ability to change the Mail settings; which requires a passcode.

The memory spec for my Mac says it needs PC3-10600 DDR3. The kit I have is PC3-8500 DDR3. In particular, the kit is Crucial part number CT2CP51264BC1067.\nWill the memory I have work in my Mac?\n\nA: PC3-10600 RAM runs at a clock speed of 1333Mhz. The older PC3-8500 runs at a speed of 1066Mhz. As long as there aren't any other physical or voltage requirement differences between the two types of memory (and there shouldn't be in your case, since both are DDR3 SO-DIMMS), your system should accept it.\nKeep in mind that the system's memory bus will automatically adjust to suit the rated speed of the slowest memory module installed into it. So rather than running the memory at 1333Mhz, it will drop down to 1066Mhz and you'll lose some memory bandwidth.\nIf you want, you can look at this Wikipedia entry to start figuring out exactly how much. As for real world performance, it really depends on what you're doing. Increasing the amount of memory available while losing some bandwidth might be a good idea if you leave everything open all the time.\nBut if you have specific applications that require a high amount of memory I/O, like a big database for example, speed might be more important. For the average Mac user though, I'd say sheer volume would be preferential.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 having trouble connecting with dock My iPhone 4 has trouble connnecting to a Sony speaker dock, it will continuously charge. \nSometimes it will play music through the speakers; sometimes it will not.\nIf it is not playing music it acts exactly as it would if it were to play music (the play/skip area drops down over the volume) but nothing comes through the speakers. \nIf it DOES play music at all it often seems to come disconnected from the dock every 30 seconds or so only to reconnect itself and have to be pressed play again. \nI believe that is just a problem with my iPhone 4's connecting area... any suggestions at all would be so helpful!\n\nA: Have you tried looking inside your iPhone side of the connector?

I'm thinking of this working like wireless headphones, except with a really long cord. If there is a way could you let me know how the solution works, I'm interested in creating my own script/app to do this if it's not too daunting.\nIf its important, I'm running an old 2009 MacBook, running Snow Leopard.\n\nA: I didn't fancy paying for Airfoil - plus I'm a bit suspicious of not being able to use all audio sources on the Mac.\nInstead I'm making use of Airphones (DELETED - app now unavailable)\n\nA: In a similar way to @Robin's answer you can use the BlackHole virtual audio driver - which works on newer MacOS versions. A simpler way to do streaming is to use ffpmeg (e.g. brew install ffmpeg). Then direct your audio output to the BlackHole driver (select it as the output device - or include it as part of an aggregate device) and find out which output number it goes to:\nffmpeg -f avfoundation -list_devices true -i \"\"\n\nThen use the AVFoundation audio device number (e.g. 5) to stream the audio to your_device (You can use your_device.local or it's IP address):\nffmpeg -f avfoundation -i \"none:5\" -acodec mp3 -f rtp  rtp://your_device:1234\n\nTo listen on your_device use the VLC client (e.g. on an iPhone/iPad/MacBook) and go to Network->Open Network Stream and tap in rtp://@:1234\n\nA: Here is a little solution that uses the open source programs Soundflower, VLC and SoX.\nFirst of all, you need to install the necessary programs using Homebrew:\nbrew install sox\nbrew install --cask soundflower vlc\n\nChoose the Soundflower (2ch) device in the system settings for the sound output such that it can be forwarded to a VLC server which we will set up next. (Note, that this mutes the internal speakers/headphone jack.) By checking \"Show volume in menu bar\", you can also change the output device by alt-clicking the menu bar item more conveniently.\n\nNow, run the VLC server:\nsox -t coreaudio \"Soundflower (2c\" -t mp3 -C 96 -q - | \\\n  vlc - --sout \"#standard{access=http,mux=ogg,dst=localhost:8080}\" --intf dummy\n\nYou can adapt the quality and bit rate with the -C switch (see the SoX documentation). Remove -q to get visual feedback about whether sound is playing.\nFinally, on your iOS device, install the iOS VLC client. In the side menu, choose Network Stream and enter http://[YOUR-LOCAL-IP]:8080 to start the stream.\nCaveats: This setup is not suitable for real-time applications like gaming or chat because there is a ~2 seconds lag. However, it can be used for watching videos in VLC by shifting the sound track to account for the lag (Window > Track Synchronization).\n\nA: Yes, using Airfoil for Mac (also available for Windows) and the companion app Airfoil Speakers Touch you can stream any audio from your Mac to your iOS device. \nI haven't tried it much myself, and reviews are mixed, but you can try it for free before shelling out the money for it.\nThis can also be used to send audio from a MacBook to a bluetooth headset connected to an iOS device. Something which is very difficult otherwise.\n\nA: I used Airfoil and was able to stream music from iTunes (on an iMac running OSX Mavericks 10.9.1) to my iDevices.\nI admit the $25 price tag was not something I liked.\nHowever it does work.  You can play music from iTunes on a your laptop and simultaneously listen to the music on your iPhone remotely.    \nYou can have the entire house playing the same music through various speakers: your laptop, your iphone and perhaps an imac or ipad.  \nFor me, the price of the $25 is a little easier to swallow than buying a USD $94 Apple Airport Express plus Speakers to connect to the Airport Express.\nWhat's more the Airport Express only has One Audio Jack Port so one speaker for one Airport Express.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Using the VLC GUI:\n\n*\n\n*install and set up Soundflower\n\n*install VLC\n\n*set your sound output to the Multi-output device set up for Soundflower (or to Soundflower 2ch directly)\n\nIn VLC:\n\n*\n\n*File > Open Capture Device\n\n*Check \"Audio\" and select Soundflower (2ch)\n\n*Check \"Stream Output\" and click \"Configure\"\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Select \"Stream\"\n\n*Type: HTTP\n\n*Address: your local IP address\n\n*Port: 8079 (or a port of your choice)\n\n*Encapsulation Method: Ogg (or something else)\n\n*Check \"Audio\" in transcoding options\n\n*Select \"mp3\" for audio (or something else)\n\n*Select 96kbps for bitrate (or something else)\n\n*Select two channels (or something else)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Press OK and then open the stream\n\n*On your phone, open VLC and go to the network tab and open the stream at\n\nhttp://[your local ip]:8079\nUnfortunately, this seems to not be very reliable.

I'm about to switch over to the Homebrew\npackage management system, and almost everything looks very simple.  However,\nI've been using this computer for a while, and so I already have a bunch of\nstuff in /usr/local.  I'm OK with deleting almost all of it, as there are\nformulæ for almost everything in there.  However, it's the \"almost\" that's\nleading to my current confusion.  There are some executables—including published\nones, small personal scripts, and even TextMate's mate tool—in\n/usr/local/bin which aren't available through Homebrew.  The Homebrew Tips\n'N' Tricks page suggests\nusing ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/foo/1.2 && make && make install && brew link foo, but this is only a useful suggestion if there's something I'd\nlike to actually build, rather than a simple binary or a symlink to something\nlocal.\nMy question, then, is how to deal with unmanaged software and Homebrew\nsimultaneously.  I see a few possible approaches:\n\n*\n\n*Mix the two freely.  I can't tell if Homebrew will tolerate me dumping\nunmanaged binaries and symlinks in /usr/local/bin; my guess is that it\nwill work for now, but just lead to problems down the road.  However, I also\nsee that Homebrew's supposed to be flexible with existing file hierarchies.\nI'd be curious to hear what the official line on this is.  Nevertheless,\nit's not clear that it's an attractive approach.\n\n*(Ab?)Use the official system.  Create empty /usr/local/Cellar/foo/1.0\ndirectories, copy the binaries/symlinks in there, and then brew link foo.\nThis will make symlinks be twice-indirected, but that doesn't seem like a\nreal problem.  This seems like the best approach to me, but not having used\nHomebrew, I'm not sure about the drawbacks.  Is this going to cause\nlong-term problems when, for instance, upgrading formulæ, or when new\noverlapping formulæ are created?\n\n*Just don't mix the two.  There are two approaches here:\n\n*\n\n*Put my personal binaries/symlinks in another directory.  I'm not sure\nwhat the best location is (~/bin?  ~/usr/bin?  Something else?), but\nit solves the mixing problem by punting on it.\n\n*Put Homebrew in another directory (e.g., /usr/homebrew/).  This\nsolves the problem in the same way as 3.1.  The disadvantage is that I'm\nputting Homebrew somewhere nonstandard, which seems like it'll just\ncause a series of tiny minor headaches in the long run.\n\n\n\n*Something else that I don't know about or haven't thought of.\n\nWhat's the best way to do this?  Is there an official one?  Are there obvious\nflaws or benefits to any of these approaches that I haven't thought about?\n\nA: I use 1.\nI just compile my software using /usr/local as the prefix and I'm done. I had no problem so far. I don't know whether I'll experience problems, but I started ~1y ago and so far so good. \nHowever…\nIf I'd have to start again today, I'd follow 2 (which I didn't know at the time). That way it's easy enough to know where everything is and what, exactly, the software has installed (since the hierarchy for /usr/local/Cellar/foo/1.0 is something like\nbin/      etc/      include/  lib/      share/\n\n)\n3 doesn't seem worth.\n\nA: Homebrew tolerates non-homebrew things in /usr/local just fine. You can confirm that all is well by doing brew doctor - if anything is likely to conflict, homebrew will warn you.\n", "Q: Migrating from Time Machine without Migration Assistant I want to change my mid-2010 iMac with the latest iMac of my parents.

I didnt realise the yellow tint on the phone until my friend compared his screen side-by-side. There is a yellow tint on my phone's screen. I read around the net and some people state its the glue and will get better within a few days. Other sources say that its a polarization problem and will not be fixed on its own.\nCan anyone shine some light on this issue ? Will it be fixed on its own over time ?\nEDIT :\nI compared it with 3 other phones, mine was the only one with a yellow-ish tint.\n\nA: It depends on the cause of the yellowing.\nI personally have seen the following situations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Psycological yellow where any time you have a black border and a white area, the brain will color the white yellow. If you hide the black with a piece of white paper, the yellowness magically disappears.\n\n*Permanent manufacturing problem where the LCD is pinched internally, damaged, or otherwise really emitting a permanent yellow cast as measured by a calibrated colorimeter such as the Spyder.\n\n*Temporary yellowness (very rare - I've just seen this a few times). I don't know why or when it went away, but several people sure agreed that one phone was off until it was restored. I don't know if it was some odd warmup temporary hardware issue, but after it was restored, it looked and tested fine with the Spyder.\n\n\nDo keep in mind, not all displays are made in the same batch, same factory and that combined with the backlight settings can make a pretty large difference between models. If it's convenient to have it checked out, or you can take a picture of the colors and it's totally obvious yours has some severe color tint, then take it in and ask for a repair. If not, you'll likely need hours of time and expensive tools to even tell your phone is unique to another after using it to play games for a day or two. It will just be right and your brain will compensate for whatever calibration your phone has. A restore of the device is also a good thing to try so you don't needlessly waste time going in for service since that is the most obvious cause of the LCD passing all inspections along manufacture but you having colors that seem off to your eye at the point of receiving a new phone out of the box.\n\nA: Just to add another reason for yellowing\nThe yellow appears as the glue warms up when it has not been set for long.\nThis happens when the phone is made and sod quickly. Basically the glue under the screen dries but it warms and turns yellow.\nIt will return to normall after a week or do.\n\nA: Your phone may be in night shift mode \nTo fix go to settings \nGo to display and brightness \nGo to night shif, turn off, if that doesn't work try going to bottom and sliding bar over to less warm and wait a few seconds \n", "Q: Is there a HDD/Hard-Drive testing tool for mac?

Go to the \"store\" menu bar item and click \"Check for available downloads\". \nThis will bring up movies you have rented with the same account - as long as they are still valid.\n\nA: You can manually copy the movie.\nRight-click on the file and select Show in Finder then copy the movie onto a flash drive and move it to the new computer. \nWhen on the new computer - opening the file should open iTunes. Since it's connected to the same account, the movie should play.\n\n\nA: The computer is already authorised. It appears that it is the 'file' that needs to be authorised to play on another computer\n", "Q: Airprint on older HP Printer (Color LaserJet 2600N) My parents have both recently gotten iPads, and have found that our networked laser printer, a HP Color LaserJet 2600N doesn't seem to support airprint. Is there any way to upgrade the printer to support the protocol, to save them replacing the printer altogether? \nThe printer works great wirelessly on my Macbook Pro (2010) and installed happily with no drivers.\nThanks!\n\nA: I don't know that you'll be able to install firmware into the printer that  lets you accept jobs directly from iOS. However, if you have a Mac running on your network, you could try something like AirPrint, which runs on your Mac and makes all the printers available on the Mac available to Airprint as well.\nThis works great for me with my old Mac Mini that I run as a server and an HP CP1515 printer. This might not be an option if you don't have a machine available all the time, but it's a great solution if you do.\n\nA: Since you said in one comment that your parents don't own a Mac that could be used with the Airprint Hacktivator, you could do something different. All that is needed for Airprint capabilities is a box (Linux or Windows) running CUPS and avahi. For example, a very cheap method, which I also use, is running the OpenWRT Linux distribution on a wireless router. If your parents have a compatible device, you could install it on that, or you could buy a cheap Linksys router. Mine was 60 EUR and runs a print server, music player daemon and other stuff. Here is a short article how to enable Airprint on an OpenWRT box.\n\nA: There's an App for that!\niTunes Store - Link\nYou need a free account, but the app seems to be great.\nHere are Guides & Manuals\n\nA: I would recommend using air print activator. You can install it and share the the printer with your iOS devices.\n\nA: There's an application called Printer Pro for iDevices.  There's a free and a paid one.  Give it shot, you may not have to modify the printer at all.\n", "Q: Mail app shows junk mails in my inbox Here is the Junk Mail settings:\nAlso, junk mails are shown in Smart folders even when the \"Message is not in mailbox Junk\" condition is set (\"Contains messages that match\" is set to \"all\" as well).\nMessages are identified as junk by Mail.app (they color is yellow and the icon is shown).\nMy question is how to make Mail app to hide junk mails in all non-Junk mailboxes.\n\nA: Is it an IMAP mailbox? I had this problem with my self-hosted IMAP account, where iMail couldn't move the message into the junkbox on the server and kept finding it in the inbox. I deleted the IMAP account, it's associated mailboxes on the server and started again and it worked alright.\n", "Q: How can you search in the trash, and sort deleted files by date of deletion? In Snow-Leopard: Is it possible to search in the Trash, and sort deleted files by date of deletion?\n\nA: If you open up your trashcan into a Finder window. Then right click on empty space in that window go to \"arrange by\" and then down to date added. This is at least true in Lion I don't know what you are running or if it is true with other versions. Good luck!\n\nA: You can use terminal to browse to the trash directory for your user\ncd ~/.Trash/\n\nthen you can use\nls -la\n\nto see all the files and you can search also using grep.\nEDITED\nto see in date order try\nls -lt\n\n", "Q: iPhone/iTunes backup books from iBooks I have some books in iBooks that were opened from third-party apps, so they are not on my mac. I would like to save them in iTunes and don't find a way to do it.\nFor example there are some apps, that allow you to copy music, photos or videos from iPhone/iPad, but i found none that could do books. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: I've not heard of any apps that allow you to copy iPhone > Mac / PC, but I vaguely remember mine just copying them over anyway. \nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht4227 suggests that they will be copied over automatically. \n", "Q: iMessage and Facetime not working I have bought a new ipad 2 3G and at the present time I am using it without SIM card. I have managed to make it work barely. I can navigate the web, read emails and download apps, but I cannot use iMessages or Facetime. The device will not appear on Find my device either. \niCloud.com says NO DEVICE. I have followed all instructions to associate my device with my Apple ID. I have indeed registered it manually on \nhttps://register.apple.com.... but the device is not showing associated with my AppleID even when I click to see my AppleID data.\nWhat am I mssing? THanks.\n\nA: Following on from previous answer (I can't seem to comment) it hooks to whichever one is available. For an iPad that has had a SIM card in it, it'll hook to your phone number. If you have the SIM, re-insert it and ensure it's all working, then head to iMessage and Facetime settings and add the email address to both of them. After that, you should be able to take the SIM back out and it continue functioning. \n\nA: Facetime and iMessage are linking to your phone number, so it is impossible to use them without SIM. One of the reasons is - security. You don't normally want any other devices receiving your iMessage-s (logged in with email only).\nI think that might be obsolete already, there are emails-only iMessage anyway.\n\nA: You should be able to go to Settings -> FaceTime, and use your Apple ID to login there. A phone number is definitely not needed for FaceTime and iMessage (I use iMessage and FaceTime with a friend who only has an iPod Touch -- so no phone number -- and it works just fine).\n", "Q: What options exist to restore tab completion using libedit in PSQL on OS X Lion? It would appear that Apple have managed to get it utterly wrong with libedit again. The version shipped with Lion is apparently broken, and consequently tab completion doesn't work in psql (Discussion here). psql is one of the few tools that I tend to use directly from my macbook rather than on a vm and it would be lovely if it just worked. I've tried rlwrap and although it functions it doesn't support psql tab completion. I suppose I could install a new version of psql from source and link it directly against readline but I was wondering if:\n\n\n*\n\n*...anyone had found a workaround of some sort\n\n*...it was even vaguely credible to consider building an updated version of libedit and replacing the system version?\n\n\nA: Install macports, and then install the postgresql83 package.\nsudo port install postgresql83\nThe macports psql works fine. Make sure you get it first on your path, e.g.:\nPATH=/opt/local/lib/postgresql83/bin:$PATH\n", "Q: Dual monitors and OS X Lion : get menubar and app switcher on both displays I've just plugged in another monitor into my 13 inch MBP running OS X Lion.\nIt works fine, except for three little annoyances:\n\n\n*\n\n*Whenever I use the application switcher (or whatever it's called, I mean the thing that appears when you use command-tab), it appears only on the MBP screen. I also want it on the external screen I attached.\n\n*same problem with the top menu bar. It only appears on the MBP screen, but I also want to see it on the external screen.\n\n*and again, same problem for the dock.\nIs there a way to fix these three things?\n\nA: Actually, there is a way to do this natively. (without downloading third party software)\nPreferences > Mission Control\n\ntick the box that says \"Displays have separate spaces\"\nThen you will have to log out and log in back again to see the menu bar on both displays\n\n\nA: Try SecondBar and Dock Spaces.  I haven't gotten around to trying either yet but together they satisfy your request for the menu bar and dock though not the app switcher.\n\nA: They can't appear on both screens. You can, however, have it swap to being on the external screen when the external screen is attached, by selecting \"Arrangement\" and just dragging the 'little grey bar' (not sure how else to describe it) onto the external screen. This also moves the quick switcher onto the big screen. \nI have exactly the same setup as you - and the same annoyances - to solve mine I elevated my screen put the MBP underneath it - then I can have my menubar and switcher on the MBP and the apps themselves on the big screen.\n", "Q: changed password but still can't access my account My original computer with my itunes account crashed and burned. I am trying to make sense of the account on my new computer. I was able to buy musice and movies but now I can't do anything. I changed my password but I keep getting a message that says my password is incorrect. its not incorrect. Anybody have any ideas how to fix that. I am totally frustrated. \n\nA: https://appleid.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyAppleId.woa/\nTry signing in there. If it works, your Apple ID (and therefore iTunes account) are all working fine and there's an issue with your install of iTunes. If not, you can reset the password from there and hopefully it'll help you get it working on your iTunes. \n", "Q: How can I change the default width of Finder columns? I have found OS X's default column width to be a bit too narrow. Is there any way to make it wider?\nI know how to resize columns manually, but it's annoying to repeat the process every time I open a new folder. Can I force Finder to \"remember\" the new column width? Also, if this is possible, can anyone point me toward the official Apple documentation that describes how to do it?\n\nA: In column view in the Finder, you can resize columns by positioning the mouse pointer over over the thin line that separates column panes, and dragging it to the left to make it narrower or to the right to make it wider.\nTo make the Finder remember the new width, hold down the option key(⌥) while dragging the pane separator to the desired width.\nThe best documentation I can find on this from Apple alludes to the fact that holding down option resizes \"all columns at once\" but does not explicitly say that this makes the change persistent.\n\nA: I am using El Capitan. I have found the following:\nShift + Left click on right hand border makes width and height change.\nOption and Left click on right hand border reduces horizontal width from the right maintaining column width.\nAt the bottom of the column borders are 2 small vertical lines. Placing the cursor on these will ...\nShift + Left click changes column width of the left side column.\nOption + Left click changes column width of all columns to the same size.\nUsing Command instead of Shift seems to have the same effect.\n\nA: In MacOS Catalina, You can OPT-Drag the thick divider by dragging it from the bottom most part. You'll see an icon like  ||. Use that to drag. Clicking anywhere else, doesn't work.\n\n", "Q: Does the iPod with video have a built in FM radio? I have an iPod with video and in the Settings there's an option to show \"Radio\". However, when I tell it to show, it doesn't show up in the home screen. Does it have a built-in FM radio?\n\nA: The Radio option probably refers to an accessory that Apple used to sell, the iPod Radio Remote.\nYour iPod does not have an FM radio built in; only the 5th and 6th Gen Nanos have that.\nFor more information about using the iPod Radio Remote, see this Apple KB article.\n\nA: No. The only Mobile Apple systems that came with built in Fm Radio capabilities were the Ipod Nano, 5th and 6th generation. What happened was, they placed the receiver/decoder into the Nano, and placed a micro antenna into the headphones that were sold at the time. \nFret not though, for you can still get radio on Ipod touch. If you would like the free version, then connect to WiFi (Wireless Fidelity...no clue why they named it this but...meh), go to the appstore, and download a free internet radio app. Unfortunately, this is limited, but still free.\nIf you don't mind paying a little bit, then you can purchase a radio accessory  that you plug into the IPod that acts as both the receiver and antenna! In fact, most of these also double as an extra exntended life battery pack! How great is that?!\n", "Q: Create a command to focus a specific window from anywhere in OS While developing for the web I tend to jump back and forth between my text editor and the browser a lot. I'd like to set a keyboard shortcut at the OS level that allows me to jump to a specific, definable window every time. Even better would be the ability to issue a tell that application to execute something, but I'll save that for later.\nAre there technologies available that will let me do this? There must be something between C and AppleScript that let's me create this kind of an interaction. Does anybody know where to begin?\nThanks.\n\nA: I had a lot of trouble getting this to work with iTerm2. Here is single command solution:\n  osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"iTerm2\"' \\\n            -e 'set frontmost to true' \\\n            -e 'if windows is not {} then perform action \"AXRaise\" of item 1 of windows' \\\n            -e 'end tell'\n\n\nA: You should give Automator a try. You could \"Record\" a new service (that you can later publish for all Apps and assign a Keyboard Shortcut), that clicks the app from the Dock. In fact, you could add more actions and perform your \"tell that application to execute something\".\nI've tried creating one (that is relatively useless but works) that clicks on Mail in my Dock, then clicks the get new mail icon in the toolbar. Fun ;)\nAttached is the shot of the Automator result:\n\nI used the Record button on the top right corner and then did the actions myself (clicked on the Mail's dock icon, then clicked on Mail's Get New Mail icon in the toolbar, then clicked \"Stop Recording\").  Please notice I've selected \"Service receives [no input]\" in the first combo box, as I wasn't interested in any input. \nThis gives you multiple possibilities to have a couple of services that go back and forth your TextEditor and your Browser. \nAutomator is located by using Spotlight and typing Automator (also located in /Applications/Automator.app)\nIn this case I've created a new \"Service\" but you could probably get away by creating \"scripts\". Not sure which one would be faster tho. Experiment. Automator is your friend.\n\nA: You might do something like this with AppleScript:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    activate\n    windows where name contains \"bash\"\n    if result is not {} then set index of item 1 of result to 1\nend tell\n\nOr using System Events:\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"Terminal\"\n    set frontmost to true\n    windows where title contains \"bash\"\n    if result is not {} then perform action \"AXRaise\" of item 1 of result\nend tell\n\n\nA: I use BetterTouchTool for setting different keyboard shortcuts or trackpad gestures on Mac OS X.

In an answer to an earlier question I found out that the available columns for Finder's list view are relative to the folder path. This means that one could choose to add a Dimensions column when browsing under ~/Pictures or Artist under ~/Music or Codec under ~/Movies.\nWhere and how these are defined?\nIs there a centralised file that links a path ~/Pictures, column Dimensions and action \"get file's dimensions\" together?\nOr is the column and the action defined in a centralised location and then a folder's property (like \"this is a folder for pictures\") enables the columns?\nOr are these all defined relatively under the folder path? Or something else?\nI think I'm indirectly asking whether or not it is possible to customise the columns (add own) and enable them for different locations.\n\nA: Try renaming the folder to \"Pictures\" or moving it into a folder named \"Pictures\" -- that did the trick for me.\n", "Q: Why can't I browse the internet with Safari, but Chrome is working? I can't browse to any website using Safari; yet, Google Chrome and Firefox are working fine. The Mac App Store also reports that it cannot connect.\nI am running OSX 10.7.2 on a 2011 MacBook Pro.\n\nA: As we have found the solution using Comments, here's the formal response.\nWhenever you experience issues with Safari, App Store, iTunes and any other service that uses the \"same\" WebKit, but seem to see no problem in Google Chrome or Firefox, it's good to check if you have your Proxies configuration clear. Since sometimes Chrome (and Firefox) override these settings (for their own multi platform stuff), they may work while the formers fail.\nThis is easily checked by opening Safari -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Proxies (Change Settings).\nMake sure Autodiscover is not checked. It should probably look all empty like this:\n\nnote/off-topic: the Use PASV FTP is usually a good idea if you are behind a router/modem/NAT like Airport Extreme or AirportExpress (or any other to be honest), since FTP was not designed to be used behind these \"hacks\". In any case, if you don't know what it is, you can safely ignore it, but if you have FTP problems every now and then (or FTP is slow as hell), check that and try again.\nThe local ignores for proxies was added by the Operating System, but it's usually a good idea to have your local stuff ignore the proxy. ;)\n", "Q: Some \"sources\" in Cydia are empty - how to get the content?

Any suggestions on how to update the iPad and still retain the photos/ make it easy to reapply them to the updated iPad? \n\nA: The Macroplant family of programs for Windows and Mac, including the free iExplorer, permit you to mount an iPad in Windows Explorer or the Mac Finder and copy files out from the iPad's directory structure to your local hard drive.\nI use the free iExplorer a lot. I don't have any experience with Macroplant's other paid apps with additional capabilities.\nThis could provide you with an inelegant but effective solution that would enable you to retrieve most of your media.\n\nA: If you plug your iPad into any computer, you should be able to save the photos on that computer.  Apple doesn't control the photos, so you can move them between devices.\n\nA: You can use any computer, Mac or PC, to remove the photos from your iPad.  Just plug in the device and use the photo management app of your choice to pull them off .  The easiest way is iPhoto or Aperture of you have a mac.  If there is other information that you need to remove, such as music, videos, or any 3rd party app data, then you'll need to go a little bit further.  There are many programs out there that allow you to mount and extract data from your iDevice, all with varying features, success rates and price tags.  The previously mentioned \"iExplorer\" is a nice free option.  My personal preference is \"PhoneView\" by ecamm.  It is Mac only and is available for 19.95.  They also have a seven day free demo so you can make sure it works for you.  The great thing about PhoneView is that in addition to the basic mounting and data transfer abilities of some of the other apps, it also gives you full and easy access to 3rd party app data, call logs and SMS logs as well as voicemail (iPhone only). \n", "Q: 3Gs after 5.0.1 upgrade, all third-party apps can not open and work After iPhone 3Gs upgrade iOS to 5.0.1, all third-party apps can not open and work.

Excel for Mac (2011) should move the currently active cell when I use the cursor keys. Currently, it is moving the viewport in the document. Is there a way to switch this back to the default setting? I cannot find anything in Excel's preferences.\n\nA: This sounds like Scroll Lock is somehow activated on your copy of Excel. IF you have a large keyboard with an F14 key, ShiftF14 can turn on and off Scroll Lock. If you don't have such a keyboard, or access to such a keyboard, it gets more complicated.\nMicrosoft support posted this article about the various methods of deactivating Scroll Lock.

To turn this off, go to Photoshop Preferences, find the file saving preferences, and set it so it never saves previews. From what I can tell, that saves it with the border, like you needed. Also, to add a border back to an image without going back and resaving it, you can click it's icon in Finder, and then click File > Get Info. Then click the icon in the upper left corner and push Delete on the keyboard. That gets rid of the custom preview from Photoshop.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: It seems that if you save it from a non-apple app, such as Photoshop, it loses the border. I don't know why, but if you open it in Preview and do a save as, it will get the white border back. \n(I just remembered that Save As is gone in Lion. I don't have access to Lion right now, but I think you would click \"Duplicate\" or \"Export\" in the file menu)\n", "Q: If I remote wipe my iPhone, can I still locate it remotely? If I lose my iPhone, and I use remote wipe to prevent my confidential data from being stolen, then can I still use Find My iPhone to locate it on a map?  I'm assuming not (since it resets to factory settings), but I wanted to double-check.\n\nA: Currently, an erased iPhone cannot be located according to these Apple KB articles.\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud: Erase your device (Feb 4, 2015)\n\n*If your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch is lost or stolen (Mar 22, 2015)\n\n\n\nImportant: Before you erase your device, try to locate it or play a sound on it. After you erase it, you can’t use Find My iPhone to do either.\n\n\n\n  \n*Erase your device. To prevent anyone else from accessing the data on your missing device, you can erase it remotely. When you erase your device, all of your information (including credit or debit cards for Apple Pay) will be deleted from the device, and you won't be able to locate it using Find My iPhone. After you erase a device, you can't track it. If you remove the device from your account after you erase it, Activation Lock will be turned off. This allows another person to activate and use your device.\n  \n\n\nA: No, you won't be able to. It tells you that on icloud.com, before wiping your iPhone:\n\n", "Q: iDevice as a Macbook remote control (remote desktop) Is there any software application that allows iPhone or iPod Touch to be used as an advanced remote control for a Macbook Pro?\n\nA: I have heard good things of these two apps, although I have not used them personally: \n\n\n*\n\n*Real VNC\n\n*iTeleport\nHope this helps. \n\nA: Touch Mouse by Logitech (free)\nThis app turns your iPhone into a remote mouse or wireless trackpad. You need to install a Touch Mouse Server software on your Mac in order for this to work.\n\n\nA: TeamViewer (free)\nThis is a remote desktop type of software for the iPhone.\n\n\nA: I use Remoter VNC but have also heard good things about Screens.\n\nA: Last I looked, there were several dozen VNC, RDP, SSH and X11 type iPhone apps in the iOS App store for remote viewing and control of a Mac's desktop from an iOS device (Wyse PocketCloud to name just one of many).  Just search some of those keywords in the iOS App store and read tons and tons of reviews (vastly more than you'll get in the answers here.)\nSome require helper software to be installed on the Mac.  Some use the built-in remote desktop options.  There are a couple 3rd party RDP server options for the Mac as well (iRapp is one) if you prefer the RDP protocol to VNC.   \nSSH into a terminal session is another option that allows doing any advanced system control that can be done from a Mac's command line.\n\nA: LogMeIn's iOS app is free (as of 2011-12-22). You need to install the LogMeIn software on your computer (Mac or Windows), which will run in the background and allow you to connect regardless of whether or not a user is currently logged in to your computer. Your iOS device (or any other computer) does not have to be on the same network as the computer you want to control, nor do you have to adjust any firewall settings.\nThe basic LogMeIn Free accounts give you full desktop remote control, while the paid Pro accounts add file transfers, remote audio, and remote printing features.\n\nA: For just controlling your Mac remotely — as in doing presentations for a class or group — I have used Mobile Mouse (iPhone, iPad) and TouchPad (universal app). Mobile Mouse has a few more features, but requires running a server app on your Mac. TouchPad is a little more streamlined and it uses the built-in VNC server (Screen Sharing) that's already on your Mac.\n", "Q: Using iPhone as iPod touch I am trying to use an old iPhone 3GS as an iPod touch.  I left in the old sim card and connected it to iTunes but it will not activate.\n\nA: This should work, but might not be ideal - get a pay-as-you-go (i.e., non-contract) SIM with a small amount of credit on it (I suppose not everyone has them lying around) and activate it with that (it needs to be on the same network that the phone is locked to) and then disable all the 'phone' functions. It should then function just fine. \n\nA: Per Apple's support documentation you'll need to activate the device using a SIM from another activated iPhone to activate the device. If you don't have access to another SIM card you could consider taking the device to an Apple store, or a mobile vendor that carries iPhones. If you don't have access to either of those, as a last resort you could download Redsn0w and activate the device without a SIM. The last method is not supported by Apple, but will accomplish your task.\n\nA: If you remove the cellular service attached to a Sim card in an iPhone, it will continue to work Foley with only one small exception:\n\n\n*\n\n*phone calls, SMS and cellular data will clearly be off so you can't use any of those functions \nYou will want to leave the Sim card inside since it is part of the self activation if you restore the iOS.  At that point the phone will receive Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and work like it was in airplane mode and you turned those two radios on solely. \nThe cellular radio will still be active for emergency 911 calls, and you will want to turn off the radios in areas of low coverage because the device will be using a lot of energy to transmit and keep in touch with distance out hours just as if you had maintained service. \n", "Q: Is it possible to remove the Dock in Lion? Is there a defaults write command to remove the dock in Lion.\nI tried the steps mentioned but that does not seem to work on Lion. I can still see the dock. Are there hidden defaults that can make the dock invisible or off-screen on OS X Lion?\n\nA: Yes. You can make it so you don't see the dock by adding a very long delay to the animation so that in practice, you never leave the mouse on the \"expose the dock\" target long enough to see it.\nThis is technically a \"workaround\" since the dock is still there, just slower to appear than we care about on our timescale.\n\nTwo steps are needed to set this up.\nOne, activate auto-hide in System Preferences → Dock → Autohide or type ⌘+⌥+D\nTwo, open the Terminal an type:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -int 100; killall Dock\n\nYou're set up now. In this example, it takes 100 seconds for the dock to appear. Make the timer even longer if you like, this long delay eventually helps you to forget that the dock is even there.\nReset to default behavior by typing:\ndefaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier; killall Dock\n\n\nA: There is an app called Docker, which has an option to \"remove dock\". I have never used this app so could not say how effective or permanant it is. It is freeware (donations accepted), hope this is of some use for you.\nhttp://www.blocksoft.net/docker.html\n\nA: There's another hidden preference for the delay before the animation starts:\ndefaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 9999999\nkillall Dock\n\nRemoving /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/ would also disable Mission Control, Launchpad, Dashboard, full screen windows, the Notification Center sidebar, and the application switcher.\n\nA: What I simply do is to reduce the Dock to a very small size, remove almost all the icons from it, and position it on the right side of the screen and turn Hiding on. That way it becomes practically invisible, yet it is still there if you need it for some reason.\n\n", "Q: How to view Root directory and subdirectories in Finder? Apparently, the Macintosh HD icon on the desktop points to the root directory but it is not showing all the contents. \nSome of the files and directories are the same as those which I see when I perform an ls on / dir in Terminal, but most other directories like /usr, /bin, etc are not visible.\nI'm assuming that for security, Mac OS X isn't showing the rest of the files and directories. Is there a way to change this behavior so as to make it like we view root folder in Linux? \nEdit:\njust found the following here:\n\nThe Finder and the Terminal show different contents for the root\n  directory. Some items in the root directory are not visible in the\n  Finder. This reduces visual clutter and enhances simplicity. If you\n  are familiar with a UNIX-style command line you can use Terminal to\n  view all items in a directory.\n\nAs per this note, Terminal has to be used to view all the items. So, what do others do? Use terminal or there is some other way?\n\nA: Shift-Command-G in Finder brings up a \"Go to folder\" dialog. Type in the name of the directory, for example, /usr/local. Finder will show the directory. I use this with Finder in 'View as Columns'\nWhile this doesn't give a browsable directory from the root directory down, I've found it quite useful.\n\nA: The problem with using sudo chflags nohidden / is that it will unhide the root directory (which is already visible)... but you want to unhide particular folders that are inside the root directory.  Which is why sudo chflags -R nohidden /* will work.\nBut that will make everything in the root directory visible.  \nPersonally, I didn't want to make everything visible, just the /usr directory.\nSo I used sudo chflags nohidden /usr\n\nA: Enter in Terminal:\n\nsudo chflags nohidden directoryname\n\nWhereby directory name is the name of the directory that you want to see in Finder.\nReverse this by typing:\n\nsudo chflags hidden directoryname\n\nThe Macintosh HD basically resembles the root directory. If you want it to appear on the desktop and in finder change this in the finder preferences.\n\nShowing all files in Finder\nType in the terminal\n\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE\n\nThen log out and back in.\n\nA: The 2018 (High Sierra) way for me seems to be:\n\n\n*\n\n*open Finder   \n\n*Open preferences  \n\n*Go to Sidebar  \n\n*Add whatever you want   \n\n\nA: Change the command to:\nsudo chflags -R nohidden /*\n\nThere is a danger in this of course. The converse will hide everything. So your best bet is to do:\nls -lo \nto list the files you want to see.\n\nA: None of the above answers work for me in Sierra (version 10.12.2), but entering this command into the terminal does work and shows all hidden files everywhere (greyed out so you can see which are hidden by design), including /var, /usr, /etc, etc:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -boolean true ; killall Finder\n\nNote that this shows hidden files everywhere - I would consider this a good thing, but some people might not want to see all the hidden files scattered across their directories. The killall Finder bit simply restarts Finder so that the change immediately takes effect. \nCredit to this LifeWire article, which also recommends using this command instead if you are on OS X 10.8 or earlier:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE ; killall Finder\n\nBoth commands can be undone by repeating the command but replacing true (or TRUE) with false (or FALSE).\n\nThe root directory looks like this after the change:\n\n\nA: I'd like to update this with some pertinent information relevant to El-Capitan.  The top-voted responses (which worked well in the past), don't seem to work anymore.  I keep getting \"Operation not permitted\" responses when trying to use the suggested schflags command for the /usr directory, for example.\nThis seems to be by design, as a new security paradigm by Apple removes the ability of an administrator to change certain flags on key system directories.\nA good workaround that I found (that addresses the original question) is simply to use the Go To Folder option (cmd-shift-G) to go directly to the needed directories (I like to have /usr, /var, and /etc visible in Finder), and then just drag those over to your Favorites bar for easy access.\n\nA: Pressing Command+Up will go up 1 level to reveal the root directory.  \n\nA: Try this :\nOpen Finder > Preferences > Devices (Check the name of your Mac)\nHope this can help.\n\nA: Go to Finder->Preferences...\nOn Sidebar tab find your Mac name in DEVICES section.\nSet it checked.\nThen close Preferences and review Finder sidebar.\nIs your Mac name appeared in DEVICES section? Is Main Partition folder inside? That's the root directory!\n(this worked not on all Macs for me - sometimes Main Partition was not enlisted)\n\nA: There are other file managers available.

I've googled it a bit and don't seem to be the only one.\nMy MacBook is running 10.7.2 with all the latest updates installed.\n\nA: If you put the HD from another machine into this mac it may have kexts for the wrong model installed. Erase the drive and reinstall Lion. During the install process it should download the specific components needed for that exact model.\n\nA: Has it worked since you swapped the hard drives over? It might be remembering something wrong in the network profile - go to Network Settings > Advanced and select your network, then click the '-' on the bottom left - apply, restart AirPort and try connecting afresh.

I have an external sound card (Line6 Studio GX) connected through USB. I have selected this device as the output device in sound settings:\n\nNow, when I press Mute (F10), the mute overlay is shown:\n\nHowever, the sound continuous to play. The 'mute' checkbox is also not checked in Sound settings. When I check 'mute' through the settings, the sound is muted. Mute key does work for internal speakers. How can I restore the mute key for this external device?\n\nA: My guess is that the driver for your sound device may or may not implement all the expected sound controls on the keyboard. That is to say that they are implemented correctly by the system drivers (speakers, headphone socket) but these are not in the core sound processes - hence you need your driver to support them.\nI have a Fiio USB headphone amplifier that I run from my MBP, and neither the mute nor the volume controls work on the keyboard. I suspect volume is applied by analogue circuits, not digital ones - so this would make sense. But I'm a touch surprised my mute doesn't work; maybe that is expected to be implemented by the same thing that controls the volume. (Edit: my device didn't come with a driver, but was recognised as a USB sound device automatically).\nLong story short - I would guess that if there is a specific driver for your device, that installing that - or finding the control panel - might help. If you don't have a driver file, try googling for one (and obviously, only download from sources you trust).\n\nA: Its likely the way line6 hooked up the usb controls through the driver as @halfer explained. they may have rushed the mac version of the driver or not had the dev resources to fully implement all of the features so it was skipped.\nhowever, you may have luck using an application such as usb overdrive. its meant for mice, keyboards and joysticks, but it allows you to map usb connected to specific keystrokes and system controls like volume or mute.\n", "Q: What is a camera app for the iPod touch geared towards filming video? I know that there are several camera apps for iOS, but what's a good one for the iPod Touch? More specifically, I'm looking for an app for taking good video.\n\nA: When I need more control over the video I'm recording I use Canopy Camera Tools. The Canopy app lets you choose a separate focus and exposure point - unlike the stock Camera app. It also lets you lock the white balance once you found a good exposure. Those features are also available when you want to take a picture.\nYou can also make time-lapse video's with Canopy.\nI'm sure there are alternatives to Canopy but this is the app I use.\nThere are also apps that - unlike the stock Camera app - let you zoom while you're recording a video but since any zooming is achieved through digital zoom and not optical zoom they will degrade the quality of the video.\n\nA: Capture is handy. Launching the app starts recording and quitting the app stops recording. Admittedly less useful now that iOS 5 has the camera shortcut on the launch screen, but it's nice for when you want to launch directly into video recording mode.\n", "Q: Is it possible to connect an external CD/DVD drive to an iOS device? What happens to those people who have completely switched to an iOS device and don't have a CD drive? Then, when they want to rip a CD/DVD to their iOS device, they can't. Is it possible to connect an external CD/DVD drive to an iOS device?\n\nA: No. There is no way to interface a CD drive with an iOS device. The best way to do this is to have your iOS device registered to a copy of iTunes running on a Mac or PC, and to connect the iOS device to the Mac or PC via WiFi or a USB cable. This would presuppose that you have a suitable CD drive connected to the Mac or PC for ripping audio.\nHowever, it occurs to me that you could probably rip music to AAC or MP3 format on a Mac or PC and then email those files to yourself, check the email on your iOS device, and then open the email attachments on the iOS device. That would get the music files in there.\n\nA: Currently, the only Apple-supported interface adapter between an iPad and a CD/DVD/optical drive is a Mac or PC running iTunes.\n", "Q: Is there a way to get on-screen pop-up notifications for new e-mails in Mail on the iPad 2? I know there is a similar question, but it seems that on-screen alerts are supposed to be built into the Notifications Settings and that using a third-party app should not be necessary. Even though I have alerts selected (the three options are none, banner, and alerts) in Settings > Notifications > Mail, they do not show up. Any thoughts on why?\n\nA: In addition to the Alert Style options which you mention setting, you also need to turn ON Notification Center for those alerts to appear in Notification Center, and also set View in Lock Screen to ON, to see them when your screen is locked.  \nOtherwise you will only see them when you are using the phone at the time that they come in, and if you already have Mail open, then they won't appear at all.\n", "Q: Is there software for transcribing and recognizing musical pitches in an audio recording? Does GarageBand or any other Mac software make it possible to determine the notes in a musical recording?\nIt doesn't have to be absolute, and it doesn't even have to guess the rhythm.

You should investigate the commercial products Celemony Melodyne and Neuratron AudioScore.\nAlso have a look at Capo by SuperMegaUltraGroovy. It provides a good method for assisting a person in transcribing by ear.\n\nA: No.  Not in the general case.\nThis still seems to be a research problem.

Authentication is the only place where encryption is used, and it is negotiated between client & server. I believe that the Airport Extreme offers DHCAST128 and DHX2 UAMs (User Authentication Methods), both of which encrypt the user's password with CAST-128 (they differ in how they come up with the key used to do the encryption, DHX2 is better).\nAFP with either of the above UAMs is susceptible to Man in the Middle attacks and I would not recommend it for use over the Internet. AFP can be tunneled through SSH for better security, but I don't think the Airport Extreme supports that usage.\n", "Q: Is there any way to make the confirmation dialog stop appearing when clearing history in Safari?

This was a very smart way of doing the tab completion that I got so used to that now it's driving me crazy when I hit tab and it gives me the Client. without actually completing to what I need it to be.\nSo is there any way to make the Mac bash completion smarter so that it would have this same effect?\n\nA: *nix packages such as bash_completion can be installed with 3rd party package managers. I suggest Homebrew, but Fink and MacPorts also provide the bash_completion package. If it doesn't auto-handle the Java situation you describe, post back or read the man page.\n\nA: I would suggest you set your default shell to zsh instead of bash. It comes bundled with Mac OS X and it's fully compatible with bash, but adds some nice features including much smarter tab completion.\nTry it with chsh /bin/zsh\nThere's also a great framework for managing your zsh environment called oh-my-zsh. It's a great starting point for some powerful customization.\n", "Q: How long should Boot Camp formatting selecting drive take? I'm trying to install Windows 7 using Boot Camp Assistant. Now the boot camp is on task \"Formatting the selected drive\" and it has been going on three hours and it is not even on the half way. How long this task should take normally, or is this normal? Or is task frozen somehow? \n\nA: The formatting should only last seconds. The behavior which you're experiencing is not normal at all.\nI would cancel the installation and verify the disk.\n\nA: It will take a while if it needs to download the Windows support files prior to burning the disk.  The actual speed depends on your network bandwidth and traffic.\n\nA: You're supposed to set up a partition and format it as exFat.  Then download the windows drivers into that partition.  Next, go into windows and install the drivers from that exFat partition.\nIf you select a Mac partition to download into, it spends hours chasing its tail until it realizes there is nothing for it to partition.  Silly software!!!\n\nA: The formatting should last undefined amount of time, as there are many factors potentially involved, such as disk encryption or using slow external USB drives.\nBefore cancelling the task, you should verify if there is no progress indicated by the app, for example by marking the position of progress bar with some other window or mouse cursor, and checking the progress after 1h.\nCurrently accepted answer is wrong, as evidenced by \"Thanks, it took long (4 hours) but everything worked out fine after all. \" and my own experience of the issue.\n", "Q: Floating virtual keyboard iOS \nThis happens every now and then. Just this time rebooting my iPad doesn't solve it. \nAny idea what caused this? Unfortunately I'm on the go and this makes safari practically unusable. \n\nA: This is not a bug, it's a feature\nJust long click on the bottom right key of the keyboard, when the menu pops up, click Dock.\nYou can enable that by dragging up the keyboard with this key. Also, you can dock him back by dragging it to the bottom of the screen.\n\n\nFYI, you can also split the keyboard, making it easier to type while holding the iPad.\n", "Q: Get an iBook from the hard copy Is there a way to get a digital copy of a book I have in hard copy?\nSome DVDs now come with a digital download, is there a similar service for books? \nNote: most of my hard copies are bought on Amazon.\n\nA: For things you've bought already, not easily. You can look online for PDF versions of the book which aren't strictly legal, but apart from that you don't have a huge number of options. \nHowever, I've definitely seen books that come with their digital copies - although the last one I bought, which was a Wrox book, required me to install Adobe Digital Editions.\nAnother option, if you have developer books, might be Safari Books Online, which allows you to save up tokens to download full copies of books. \n", "Q: Writing Causes Page to Jump I have trouble writing on my Mac. \nIt happens on pages on Safari like writing an e-mail or in Facebook and even in this question box. The problem is that the page starts jumping up and down as I'm writing and if I use the backspace key the page I'm on jumps back to the last page I was on, removing all my text.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: most likely, one of two things is happening:\nwhen you are typing you are accidentally touching the trackpad and moving or scrolling or clicking outside the text box you are typing in.\nor when you are typing the case is flexing causing accidental clicks (heavy keyboard typists beware)\nThe clue here is the backspace functionality of the browser, as when inside a text entry field, the backspace works as a backspace delete, but when outside of a text entry, pressing backspace works the same as pressing the back button in the browser (i.e. go back to the previous page)\n", "Q: iTunes keeps restoring deleted playlists Since I use iTunes Match, every few days iTunes restores some of my old playlists that I previously deleted. I think these are only the default playlists that iTunes comes with (Classical music, Music videos, Recently added, ...) but I'm not totally sure. At the same time, the \"iTunes Match\" link reappears in my sidebar, even though I can't do anything with it.\nWhat triggers the reappearence of my old playlists? How can I prevent it and get rid of these playlists forever?\n\nA: Try Store -> \"Update iTunes Match\" to make sure the changes are synchronized.\n", "Q: Is it practical to use Gmail for mail and calendar and Exchange for contacts while using iOS Mail? In the past I used the Google Mail provider on my iOS devices to sync mail and calendar. Major drawback was that it doesn't sync contacts. I had to use iTunes for that which is a mess.\nI recently switched to the Exchange provider for GMail which can sync contacts but also has several disadvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*Searching old mail on the server doesn't always bring accurate results\n\n*It doesn't sync the drafts folder so you have to finish and send a draft from the same device you created it on. Usually I want to email a photo from my iPhone, create a draft, save it and finish the email on my computer or iPad.\n\n*It doesn't use my default notification settings from GMail for new appointments in calendar. You can also only specify one notification (with GMail provider you can set 2).\n\n\nNow I was wondering if I can set up a combination of the two. Using GMail for my mail and calendar and using Exchange for contacts. Could that bring any problems? Anyone tried that?\n\nA: I had that configuration - and also used for friends & family -  and it worked just fine.\nThe only drawback is that mail is no longer pushed to your phone. But apart from that, it's the best solution to have Gmail (actually working) and Google Contacts / Calendar on your iPhone.\n\nA: Shouldn't do - might be a detriment to your battery life but my iCloud email is setup purely for calendar and contact sync so I can't see why it wouldn't work for someone else. Just don't enable mail when you create the account. \n", "Q: Why do apps only display in top left quarter of screen after installing Winterboard? After installing the jailbreak app \"Winterboard\" just now and then rebooting as required, all my apps including settings and phone etc. only display in top left quarter of screen. \nOnly that screen quarter accepts touch input, but the touches are relative to the entire screen. This means I can't interact with the bottom and right halves of any apps, making it impossible to revert the installation.\nGoogling for this problem tells me that it was a problem with the version iOS 5 GM, which is a pre-release. But I'm not using that; I've just installed the newly released iOS 5.0.1. \nAlso, the recommended fix is to use SBSettings to start in failsafe mode, but I never had SBSettings installed, and I can't install it now with the screen acting up this way. \nHow can I fix this problem, apart from restoring from my PC?\nI know I can restore from backup and then re-do all the jailbreaking, but it'd be nice if there was a way to avoid that.\nThis is what I've done:  \n\n\n*\n\n*I first made a backup to my PC, then the iOS 5.0.1 upgrade, then a restore from the PC to make sure I had all the apps and data again (I didn't; somehow several apps were missing after the restore, but I just installed the rest manually). \n\n*After that, I did the jailbreak and started adding Cydia apps. One app required the installation of Winterboard, and that is what caused this problem. \n\n*I'm fairly sure Winterboard is the culprit because when it happened, I restored again, jailbroke again, and began reinstalling Cydia apps again in a different order. It broke like this again while installing a different Cydia app that also requires Winterboard.\n\n*There's a weird effect going on that indicates that although the size of the displayed image is reduced but the size of the touch area remains full-sized but unresponsive outside the displayed quarter of the screen. In a paint app, I can drag from inside the display quarter into outside, but I cannot start a touch outside the display quarter; nothing happens.\nSo I know that I can \"fix\" the problem by restoring from the PC again and avoiding any Cydia apps that require Winterboard. But I would like to avoid restoring if possible, to save myself the trouble. I'll keep that as a last option in case there's no other way to revert this. \n\n\nA: Ok, according to this Cydia thread, you have installed an iPhone 3GS wallpaper on your iPhone 4. Since the iPhone 4 has four times the resolution of the iPhone 3GS the apps will only show up in the left quarter of the screen.\nHere's the fix:\nGo to Settings>Wallpaper and choose any of the default wallpapers. Hopefully that will work.\nAnd you don't need to restore. Winterboard makes no changes to the original OS files.\nSince you can't press the Set button, you will need to restore and make sure that you avoid any apps that use Winterboard. Too bad!! I hope I've been helpful!\n\nA: He can't go to settings it's impossible the only way to fix is to restore everything and avoid winter board on ios 5.0.1 untetheted home screen is all that works after I went threw this once I found a cydia tweak app that can put my phone into safe mode and let me fix problem if it ever happens again since Im pretty sure u need winter board for sbsettings I can no longer use it for safe mode. Avoid winter board till there's a fix for ios 5.0.1 untethered.\n\nA: I'm hitting this issue too. I can work around by going to safe mode and then using the safe mode dialog to restart. The issue returns after the next respring though. \n\nA: So I get this problem when I reboot the phone, easiest solution for me is to ssh into the phone and move the libraries in mobile substrate to a temp location - then respring, move back and respring again. \n\nA: Go to power on sbsettings, go to safe mode, then when you enter your phone, it will ask if you are willing to restart. Then choose to restart, then you'll iphone will be back to normal. However, quater sized screen may happen again. Thus this is only temporary solution.\n\nA: I downloaded an app killer that apparently did that to my iPhone.  Just put it in SafeMode and uninstalled the app.  Catastrophe avoided.\n\nA: To remove it, you need to find where the winter board dilyb is on your phone and using an iPhone explorer on your computer remove it, then send then reboot and all should be good\n", "Q: After upgrading to iOS 5, I lost my all calendars, contacts, and message data Today I upgraded my iPhone 4 to the newest iOS.

And there's probably other permutations of pkg spec that I'm not aware of.\nBottom line is that I can always find some way to manually get the stuff out of the pkg, but I'd like a one-shot solution that would do this automatically without worrying about the specific pkg implementation, say:\nunpkg CrappyPackage.pkg\nDoes such a thing exist?\nPerhaps the most foolproof way is to use the system installer itself but that seems to always need a full system drive as its target.

My Dad just got an iPod touch and raised an interesting question. Are there security risks for an iOS device? He was planning on storing sensitive personal information on it, but wasn't sure if it was completely safe. Is it even possible to hack into an iOS device and retrieve information?\n\nA: Currently there aren't any vulnerabilities that can be used remotely to access data like this that I know of.\nIf someone had physical access to the device, then they could access any data on it, as the disk isn't encrypted. Of course, the high retail value etc would mean most thieves would likely just wipe and sell it, rather than try to extract data.\nIn short, right now there aren't any active exploits that allow remote data access (though there have been ones in the past involving tiffs and pdfs that may have allowed this).\nIf the device was stolen, you are out of luck though, even with a passcode lock.\nIt's possible to set up two things to mitigate this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the passcode wrong 10 times, and device is wiped\n\n*Find my iPhone app from iCloud allows you to remotely wipe the device\n\n\nA: Keep in mind that new security vulnerabilities may or may not be published right as they are discovered--It all depends on who finds them and if Apple responds quickly to them. This means that the answer to your question may be different depending on whether or not there is a publicly known security threat that has not been addressed by Apple. \nWith that said, and with what we collectively know today, the only security risks are tied to you actually giving a third party physical access to your phone. The security issue around that web page that would gain access to your phone has long been addressed by Apple. At the moment, I would consider my MacBook to me more prone to hacking than my iPhone. \nI agree with @Rich Bradshaw in that setting a passcode and enabling Find My iPhone for its remote wipe feature are must-haves. Hope this helps. \n", "Q: Should I spin down Mac Mini's drive? I have a Mac Mini (2010) that I use as a home server with a DAS (2 drives) attached over USB. Everything is on 24/7.\nFrom all my research online, it seems that spinning hard drives up and down constantly is actually only worse for the drive so I've unchecked \"Put hard disks to sleep when possible\". Now the internal drive as well as the two externals are spinning 24/7.\nThe other reason I keep the drives spinning is that if I do have the drives on auto-sleep, I keep getting I/O Errors from the kernel log for my two external drives on USB which was very worrying. Keeping the drives spinning makes those errors go away entirely.\nThe problem is that the internal drive on the Mini crashed recently and it was only about 7 months old :( Thankfully it was under warranty but the next time I probably won't be so lucky.\nThis has me doubting my always-spin approach. All the stuff I read previously was for 3.5\" server drives, maybe the 2.5\" drives are different in this regard and I should sleep them when possible? Or was I simply just unlucky with that crashed drive?\nAdditionally: Should I want to sleep the 2.5\" internal drive, is there a way to sleep the internal but keep the externals spinning? Seems like the pref panel as well as pmset apply the setting to all drives.\nThanks!\n\nA: Ideally, you should set a longer spin-down time so that it is not occuring constantly. A time to spin down of after being idle for 4-6 hours would be better. This gives you the benefit of saving power for long periods when little is being done on the drives, e.g. during the night or while you are away from home at work, etc. Having longer times also allows for less slow down when you are using your drive since you will have a reasonable time-frame to get files and work done before the drive trys to spins down on you. \nUse pmset from the terminal to set up a custom interval that works best for you.\nOthers our claiming that spin down or not is really not that big of a deal in a home / SMB environment.\nAs for the differences between the 3.5\" and 2.5\" drives its safe to  assume they are the same or similar. Even a comparison between what you said was a 3.5\" server drives is not the same as a comparison between a 3.5\" consumer desktop drive, they are not on equal ground just because of form factor. It really comes down to the manufacture quality and is really one of those you get what you pay for kind of situations and OEM drives even in Macs are still a lowest bidder kind or process. Here is a discussion on the reliability of 2.5\" vs. 3.5\" drives.\nAs for the differences in trying to set internal or external drives independently it looks like its not possible since the setting is really only intended for the startup disk according to The X Lab -- Hard Disk Sleep \n\nAnother undocumented aspect of Put the hard disk(s) to sleep when possible is that this option generally applies only to the startup disk. Non-startup hard disk drives — external FireWire® or USB® drives or additional drives installed in a Mac desktop — may ignore this setting. \n\n", "Q: why isn't my environment variable visible from the command line?

Thus you need to change the root environment to make JAVA_HOME visible to the run.sh command\n", "Q: How to decide on a new Hard drive for macbook pro I have been using my Macbook Pro for about 5 years, it was the first model with the Intel chip. The 100GB hard drive is starting to go and I'm ready to replace it. I went over to Cnet to see what looks good. Oops. There are about 2,000 products to choose from, and I don't even know how to determine compatibility with my laptop.\nWhat are the steps I should follow to narrow in on a new hard drive?\nThis machine does a lot of heavy lifting: audio, video, and image processing, etc. \nMy goals are to increase storage to 250GB minimum (pref. 500+), improve performance, extend my Macbook's life by at least 18 months, spend less than 400$, and easy home install (youtube videos look do-able). I can spend more if there's a good reason to; just wanted to make the question specific.\nFollow-up: Is it a given that I should upgrade memory at the same time? (Currently at 2GB SDRAM)\n\nA: I would head on over to a Mac Specific reseller like OWC MacSales, RamJet or   where a company has figured which models are the best to sell based on your specific model.\nhttp://www.ramjet.com/sata.asp\nYou will see that you have many choices for well under your budget. Also you are spared the SSD/HD decision since your size/price constraint means the quality SSD are not priced in your range.\nWhen you buy from someone that has done the work, they will support you and help you should you run into issues. Get a few options and make the call if you want to buy from someone that will also answer your questions or if you are comfortable buying a community part and ensuring the firmware works, etc...\nSince RAM is so easy to swap, you really don't need to include it in the HD exchange other than your budget may be fixed. It's hard to give advice on that front, since your budget is yours and not something that transfers to an internet forum where this question and answer might apply to anyone. Without knowing your specific model and how much RAM is in use routinely based on your apps, it's not possible to advise what the most cost effective combination might be.\n\nA: You would need a 2.5\" hard drive to fit in your MBP. Since your MBP is quite old, you have a SATA1 interface. Due to backward compatibility, it is fine to use hard drives with a SATA2 or even SATA3 interface.\nIn order to most efficiently improve the performance, I would recommend using a SSD because of their high IOPS . Since you are willing to spend up to 400$, there are options to get 250GB of storage. If you need more space, you could buy an enclosure for your old hard drive in order to make use of it.\nAn upgrade to more than 2GB of RAM is dependent on your usage - but generally recommended. Do you have lots of (large) programs open at the same time? Then yes. But I can tell, that my sister is using 2GB of RAM with Lion an quite happy with. You can monitor your RAM usage with iStat Pro or the Activity Monitor.app to see if your amount of RAM is sufficient.\n", "Q: Run apps/Display long texts on ipod nano? Is it possible to run custom apps or display long text on an ipod nano or a device that's similar to it?\n\nA: I'll assume that by long text, you mean syncing notes or other text to be read on the iPod. The current generation iPod Nano doesn't contain a notes application, nor does it support apps. There was some news a while back that someone managed to do some hacking on it, but as of now, I haven't heard anything. The iPod Touch would do better for notes and apps than the iPod Nano. \n", "Q: Is there an efficient way to recover un-synced Photo Stream images? I'm experiencing a vexing bug with Photo Stream (that at least some others seem to share), in which about 10% of the photos I take on my iOS devices just don't show up in the stream. I understand that I can manually import the missing photos (e.g. using Image Capture, Aperture or iPhoto) and then manually add them to my photo library, including to my Photo Stream (e.g., using Aperture). But this process is tedious and, of course, error prone: I need to periodically go through all the photos I've taken with each of my iOS devices and manually identify which photos haven't made it into the Photo Stream. \nIs there a way to force a re-upload of all photos in an iOS device's Camera Roll to Photo Stream? \nI've tried turning Photo Stream off and back on again on the affected iOS devices, but the missing photos remain missing.\n\nA: Directly no.\nYou can go the indirect route. Get all the photos to a computer, clear the photo stream manually, then enroll the computer into Photo Stream to inject the photos back into the stream in whatever order you prefer.\nAt that point, you can re-attach the iOS devices to the stream.\nYou might want to poke at the iOS side (restore or otherwise isolate the issue as it might be a software or network issue there - I've tried to break photo stream with bad network connections - lots of photos taken when offline or switching network from WiFi to 3G and back while taking pictures and it seems pretty robust to me and unbreakable when the software is working properly)\n", "Q: ClipX equivalent for Mac? \nPossible Duplicate:\nGood simple Clipboard manager \n\nClipX is a Windows clipboard management application.\nThe search feature would be incredibly powerful if I could find a suitable equivalent to Clipx on OS X.\nI'm currently using Flycut but it's a bit buggy, inteface isn't what I'd prefer and interacts poorly with Eclipse.\nThanks! So curious if something like this exists.\n\nA: I searched Alternativeto.net and came up with these search results:\nJumpcut\n\n\nJumpcut is an application that provides \"clipboard buffering\" — that is, access to text that you've cut or copied, even if you've subsequently cut or copied something else. The goal of Jumpcut's interface is to provide quick, natural, intuitive access to your clipboard's history.\n\nIt sits in your menu bar:\n\nAnd you can assign a hotkey to bring up a pasting window:\n\nAccording to the Flycut website, Flycut is based on Jumpcut. I am currently using it and love it!\nPTHPasteboard\nPretty close to Jumpcut, with the exception that there is a paid upgrade.\n\n\nA: I'd recommend Alfred and its Powerpack for clipboard history. Aside from the actual keeping of history, you can save snippets that you use often and call them up with a combination of letters and search among recently copied texts. Alfred's interface for this is much nicer than Jumpcut's in my opinion. I haven't tried any of the others. I haven't found any application to be incompatible with Alfred either.\nThe price of the Powerpack might seem a little steep for just a clipboard history keeper, but Alfred can do so much more. It has become one of my most essential apps, so give it a try.\n\nA: I would use ClipMenu. It doesn't only keep the clipboard, but snippets as well.\n\nA: I've tried multiple clipboard managers, but none of them are as polished as Clips, a $10 app that saves clipboard history and allows you to organize and view it in a desktop overlay interface like the way dashboard used to be in snow leopard.\n", "Q: Window out of visible workspace range / unreachable I'm running OS X Lion on a MacBook Air 11\", and when I unplug my secondary display, some windows (e.g., Finder) are overflowing at the edge of the screen.\nThis usually happens on the right-hand side of the [work]space, so I have access to their title bar to drag them back.\nBut this time, the MS Word 2011 window is overflowing out of visible workspace range in a way that makes it unreachable: it's like having a big negative offset on the vertical axis. \n\n\n*\n\n*I can see the window in Exposé, tried moving it to another [work]space (and back), but the window position stays the same.\n\n*The three finger drag is enabled, but I cannot reach the window's title bar.\n\n\n\nResearching through other questions, I saw that Afloat counts among it's features the ability to \n\nMove windows from anywhere, not just the title bar.\n\njust like other window management apps. \nBut I'm primarily interested if there's any built-in solution within OS X Lion for this specific issue.\n\nIs there a key combination to move a window from any active area?\nOr how can this be solved w/o re-attaching the secondary display?\n\nA: I have the same problem when using some--not all--external monitors with my 2011 Macbook Pro running Snow Leopard. The only \"solution\" I've found is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the file that's off screen (from the Window menu in Word), so that the focus is on that file.\n\n*Press cmd+S to make sure the file is saved.\n\n*Press cmd+W to close the file.\n\n*Reopen the file.\n\n\nThe file reopens on my laptop screen and all is well again. It's not pretty, but it gets your file back where it belongs reasonably quickly. \n\nA: The easiest solution is to change the resolution of the screen, because this resets all window positions. \n\nA: I was puzzled and annoyed by this problem too in Mac Snow Leopard. The application (MS Word) has a solution. Open file that is not visible. Go to menu Window-->Zoom Window, which then brings that file up front and center.\n\nA: I experienced the same challenge:\n\n\n*\n\n*An external monitor\n\n*The external monitor is the desktop \n\n*MS Word\n\n*Only the bottom 1/2 inch of Word was exposed\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug the monitor \n\n*Word was properly positioned on the laptop screen\n\n*Move Word slightly \n\n*Plug the monitor back in \n\n*Problem solved\n\n\nA: I found a workaround. \nSpotlight --> Displays --> Scaled --> \"More Space\". \nI was able to move the application and then restored to my original display. \n\nA: Had this exact Problem in After Effects. Just found a solution on youtube that solved it for me. just option+doubleclick on the bottom corner (to resize). I dont know though if that is a system function, that works everywhere or if it is an after effects function.\n\nA: Windows can also be moved by dragging them from the edges. For example dragging a window horizontally from the bottom edge usually moves it.\nYou could also try selecting the Zoom action from the Window menu.\n\nA: None of these worked, then I read about a trick to delete the plist file. That deleted everything including my registration for the app I was trying to gather the main window, which was open, when I last closed it.\nThen I tried the following and succeeded:\nI changed the key MainWindowFrame to s.th. below my screen resolution, in my case:\n<key>MainWindowFrame</key>\n    <array>\n        <integer>**2237**</integer>\n        <integer>474</integer>\n        <integer>834</integer>\n        <integer>704</integer>\n    </array>\n\nto:\n<key>MainWindowFrame</key>\n    <array>\n        <integer>**1000**</integer>\n        <integer>474</integer>\n        <integer>834</integer>\n        <integer>704</integer>\n    </array>\n\nThat finally did the trick!!!\n\nA: I fixed it by going to the menu Window-->Minimize, which then brings that file back to the screen.\nI saw other solutions like Window-->Zoom or Window-->Arrange all. I guess the issue can be fixed by other window-related submenus under the Window menu :-)\n\nA: I had the same problem and literally, just, clicked two times in the icon for the app/program I wanted to use and it brought it right to the center of my screen. \n\nA: The solution I found is Window → Arrange all.\n", "Q: Make vim read the vimrc from ~/.vim/vimrc This may not be the best place to ask this question but I'm having trouble getting vim to read my vimrc file.

The kernel according to Apple can also run or \"support\" 64 bit applications. My question is how does the system do that?\nA 64 bit OS can run 32 bit apps by default because the OS has emulators that catch all 32 bit calls and translate them into native 64 bit calls.\nBut how does the 32 bit kernel in OS X do that with 64 bit? \n\n\n*\n\n*Hardware architecture virtualization? (if so, wouldnt this be slow as the conversion from 32 bit calls and memory addresses to 64 bit is a lot more intensive?)\n\n*Hybrid architecture design (i.e the kernel is designed with some 64 bit elements mixed in with the mostly 32 bit design?)\n\n\nApple docs and support doesnt seem to have anything specific on this. I am just curious! \n\nA: Note, some of the info in this answer was cribbed from here:\nMac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was the last OS to support 32 bit CPU architectures, like the Core Solo, and Core Duo (not Core 2 Duo) processors.  Note that it's entirely possible to have a 64bit processors like the Core 2 Duo, and still have a 32bit EFI firmware, so the CPU alone isn't the sole indicator of your systems capabilities in this respect.\nThis is how you end up the situation of having a 32 bit kernel, that is held back by the EFI, running on a 64 bit CPU, which is capable of running a 64bit application stack so long as it is not dynamically loading any kernel modules etc.  The application isn't wholly tied to the kernel, and is capable is independent running in a different state to the kernel if required.  Same way an app can run 32bit on a 64bit kernel...\nTo be honest, the number of people with a Core 2 Duo or above but with a 32bit EFI are relatively limited, and you are unlucky if you are one of those people that has, say a Macbook from 2007/8 when this was common.  The 64bit EFI was introduced in a staggered way across the range so it's not simple to pinpoint what date it was common across all formats.\nYou can check your machine’s EFI  by entering the following command in Terminal:\nioreg -l -p IODeviceTree | grep firmware-abi\nIt will return either “EFI32″ or “EFI64.”\nIn addition, some perfectly capable machines still only boot into 32bit mode kernels, even when they are capable, although you can force a 64bit kernel by holding down the 6 and 4 keys on boot.\nOS News notes that only Macs with a 64-bit EFI are able to boot the 64-bit Snow Leopard kernel and kexts; an artificial limitation imposed by Apple, even though a 32-bit EFI can boot a 64-bit kernel “just fine.”\nWhat’s worse is that even if your MacBook (non-Pro) has a 64-bit EFI, it will only be able to boot the 32-bit version of Snow Leopard because of a limitation that Apple imposes on MacBooks. The biggest roadkill on Route 64 is the original Mac Pro (which was discontinued January 8, 2008) it won’t be able to boot the 64-bit kernel and drivers either.enter link description here\n\nA: The 32 bit versus 64 bit is probably more of a question for the microprocessor manufacturer:\nhttp://search.intel.com/default.aspx?q=64+bit&c=en_US&method=text&input-submit=Search\n", "Q: MacBook Pro (15\" mid-2010) crashes upon waking up from sleep sometimes I have this MacBook for quite a while now.

I was editing the configuration for my Time Capsule, when I noticed that I had the following options for network encryption:\n\nWhy is there an option of WPA/WPA2? Is it as secure as WPA2 Personal?\nWhen looking for the network with other devices, I'm am told to enter a WPA2 Password. Thus, I thought that I had configured it using WPA2 Personal.\n\nA: Both 'WPA' and 'WPA2' use AES to encrypt the information transiting the WiFi network, but \nWPA uses something called TKIP to manage the keys used to encrypt the data. TKIP is vulnerable to attack (it's not secure) and should not be used. \nWPA2 uses AES-CCMP for key management.\n\"WPA/WPA2 Personal\", also called mixed-mode, allows negotiation of key management modes and reduces the security of the network to the lowest common denominator.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: If you're concerned about security/privacy of information on your networks (wired and wireless) , DON'T use WPA or WPA/WPA2. Use WPA2 only. And, if you don't already know, WEP is basically the same as having no security at all.\n\nAnother poster points out that the 'Enterprise' modes send authentication requests to a server before allowing a client on the network. The two big advantages are: \n\n\n*\n\n*central management: I don't have to set keys on every access point, and I can disable accounts of individual users. There's also traceability: I know which WiFi device belongs to which user.\n\n*much longer keys (like 2048 bit, versus 128 for 'personal'). This further decreases the likelihood that an attacker can figure out the key in the time it's in use. \n\n\nThe 'personal' pre-shared key (\"PSK\") is derived from the passphrase you type into your client, so even if PSK allowed long keys, you'd have to type a passphrase that most people would object to.\n\nA: I believe that WPA was the original WPA standard, and WPA2 was an improved version of it. Some network cards can’t connect to WPA2 networks. From the Wikipedia page on WPA:\n\nThe later WPA2 certification mark indicates compliance with the full IEEE 802.11i standard. This advanced protocol will not work with some older network cards.\n\nThe Wikipedia article cites a white paper from the Wi-Fi Alliance:\n\nWPA is both forward and backward-compatible and is designed to run on existing Wi-Fi devices as a software download.\n\nIn a nutshell, a WPA/WPA2 network will any network card that supports WPA or WPA2 to connect to it; whereas a WPA2 only network locks out network cards that only support the newer standard. I don’t think there’s any meaningful difference in the security.\nFWIW, I’ve used WPA2 Personal on my Airport Extreme since I bought it, and no device has ever had problems connecting.\n\nConfession: I initially misread the question as being about the difference between Personal and Enterprise, and wrote this. Although not directly answering the question, I include it for interest.\n“Personal” and “Enterprise” just refer to the two flavours of WPA and WPA2. From the Wi-fi Alliance’s page on WPA2:\n\nWPA2 can be enabled in two versions - WPA2 Personal and WPA2 Enterprise. WPA2 - Personal protects unauthorized network access by utilizing a set-up password. WPA2 - Enterprise verifies network users through a server. WPA2 is backward compatible with WPA.\n\nI believe that WPA and WPA2 both come in these two flavours, hence the either/or. Personal is more suitable for a home network, but it’s less secure than enterprise. Enterprise connects to a “RADIUS server” for authentication. I don’t know what that is, but it sounds clever and secure.\nI’d guess that a device connecting to your Time Capsule just sees a request for a WPA2 password, hence why it doesn’t ask you for a WPA2 Personal password.\n\nA: In general WPA2 personal is more secure that just WPA.\nWPA/WPA2 Personal i believe to be either/or. It will use what it can. Normally being WPA2 Personal but the option below is a way to force a better security.\n\nA: I have a TimeCapsule also and had to use the WPA/WPA2 Personal mode to allow an older Brother wireless printer to connect.  Had the printer been capable of the newer WPA2 security protocol I would have used the WPA2 Personal setting in my TimeCapsule.  Basically using WPA2 Personal is a tiny bit more secure, but restricts your wireless connections to newer devices.\n", "Q: How can I switch between the Japanese and English dictionaries on iBooks? For whatever reason, my iBooks dictionary is stuck in Japanese. Even when I read English books, defining a word always causes the app to use the Japanese dictionary. My iPod's language is English, so I have no idea why this might be. Is there any way to switch it to the English dictionary?\n\nA: This answer is for iOS 7, maybe 6.\nThe question might be stale, but the ANSWER (if folks are on iOS7, maybe 6) is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Look up a word in iBooks, or in any App that has 'Define' flyouts from text. You'll get to the Definition UI which is in Japanese… if you can't read it go for the button on the lower left.\n\n*At the bottom of the definitions, you'll see 2 'buttons', from Left to Right: \"Manage\" and \"Search Web\". You should see this whenever you get UI to invoke iOS's Dictionary (which is not an App like it is on OS X)\n\n*Hit \"Manage\" and now you have a list of Dictionaries that you can enable/disable. AFAIK, enabling and disabling is global, so if you do it in iBooks it'd be the same in TweetBot, etal. \nTo conclude: There's no direct access to the Dictionary.app in iOS, even in Settings.app. You have to define a word, and manage dictionaries from there.\n\nA: Open the Dictionary app, then Preferences, then choose the dictionaries you want.

A long time ago, I found this post online with some tips for finding files in the browser cache.  Specifically, Flash videos.

Where might I find Safari's cache items to copy them?\n\nA: This is how you do it: Capturing streaming video in OSX Lion.\nIt's basically the same method as in the post you referred to, with the difference being that you access the file through the activity window in Safari instead of navigating to the temp file in Finder.\n\nA: I would recommend launching Firefox and using the DownThemAll! plugin when you want to download a Flash video.

The laptop is now gone, but I have a disk image with the entire contents of the hard drive. Is there a way I can copy the fonts that were in the \"Favorites\" collection to my new computer? Put another way, is there a file I can copy from one machine to the other which contains my \"Favorites\" fonts collection? Thanks!\n\nA: Yes!\nBefore you do, your font library on your new computer should probably contain the same fonts as the old one. (I’m not entirely sure this is necessary, but I suggest it to be on the safe side).\nOS X stores most of its fonts in one of three locations:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Fonts — fonts you’ve installed for your personal use;\n\n*/Library/Fonts — fonts you’ve installed for every user on the computer;\n\n*/System/Library/Fonts/ — the fonts that Mac OS X needs.\n\n\nYou’ll probably only need to transfer fonts from the first two folders, as your new installation of OS X will provide the fonts in the third. More detail in the Apple support article on font locations.\nIf you’ve got the odd font that isn’t in one of these three folders, you can still find its location. Open the file ~/Library/Fonts/fonts.list in a text editor (TextEdit would do). The file contains a long list of font locations, which correspond to the fonts that you’ve installed. With this, you can find any fonts that are lurking elsewhere.\n\nOnce you have your old font library on your new computer, transferring the font collections should be relatively easy. On the disk image of the old laptop, navigate to ~/Library/FontCollections. One of these files will be Favourites.collection (or whatever you called it). Copy this file to ~/Library/FontCollections of your new computer, and then the collection should show up in Font Book the next time you launch it.\n", "Q: Sharing internet connection from ethernet to wifi NOT using apple sharing I want to share my internet connection on 2 pcs (imac+mac mini), however, the default internet connection sharing stuff, is really unstable.\nIs there any 3rd part alternative, working stable?\nThanks.\n\nA: i've personally never seen any 3rd party apps.\nIf you really want a stable connection i'd recommend buying a cheap router.

You can drop the volume to that area of the sidebar, but the listing disappears immediately. \nYou can add the volume to the sidebar, after which it should appear (whenever mounted) under DEVICES. \nWith Command-K in Finder, the volume can be a favourite in the Connect to Server dialogue.

I've been playing around, trying to find the best settings for converting DVD files (MPEG-2) to H.264 so that I can store everything in iTunes and watch it on the TV. Most of the stuff I have has been ripped using a DVD Recorder. I am in the UK and am using the PAL format. I want to keep it as true to the original as possible, including all interlacing.\nIf I use Handbrake, it tries to crop bits off and resizes to a weird dimension, so I have to work to switch all of that off. Also, even if I try to turn off all the decombing and deinterlacing options, including putting the :interlaced flag in the advanced options, when I play it back on the TV it has somehow destroyed the interlacing and no longer appears smooth.\nI've also tried VisualHub, which is much more simple to set up and keeps the interlacing in fine by default. I find that also converting to H.264 using MPEG StreamClip works just as well. However, one thing I have noticed while converting a TV programme about Pink Floyd is that the conversion to H.264 is making some of the colours washed out. On the computer, the green seems a bit lighter, and on the TV the red looks more like pink. Here's a screen grab from QuickTime Player (left one is MPEG-2 and the other two are MP4 H.264):\n\nAlso, ripping from TV keeps some lines at the top of the screen which contain white dots (some kind of syncing data?)... If I crop the video so it removes them then obviously that makes the aspect ratio wrong... Does that affect how it will play back on a TV?\nIf anyone has some good tips on how best to rip stuff, please let me know!\n\nA: The solution I use for converting MPEG2 from DVD image or EyeTV recording to iPod-friendly MP4 H264 is based on HandBrakeCLI, the command line interface of HandBrake. It is also possible to use FFMpeg.\nThe settings are much more complex but offer much more freedom.\nI spent some time figuring out what are the best options for me, then I put it in a bash script, so that I just have to give the pathname of the DVD image or the EyeTV recording as an argument to my script.\n\nA: Since you didn't specify a budget, and did ask about the \"best\" way, you should look into using Compressor. \n\nA: Quicktime Player 7 actually has pretty good export capabilities, including H.264. You can download it now for free.\n\nA: If you're using an Apple TV to play this content on the TV I share your pain, and the time to convert everything is also a pain! This is an alternative suggestion, not an answer to your question.\nIf your main goal here is to simply watch the content, and you'd prefer not to have to rip, then perhaps XBMC to simply view it may be a better option for you (it was for me).\nI gave up transcoding everything months ago because of the problems you describe, the long time it took to do it, and all of the steps to get it from the PVR and disc initially into iTunes. I then found XBMC for Mac; it plays the vast majority of formats without the need to convert anything, and maintains it's own library created from wherever you store the files. Obviously it won't be in iTunes, but I don't see that as an issue as most of the content is transitory and I don't keep it for long.\nIf you do use an Apple TV, then you could airplay to it while running XBMC, or if you're daring, you could jailbreak the device and install XBMC on it and share the folder with the shows.\n", "Q: What can cause 90 second delays joining a wifi network? I have been using my Mac Book Pro (15\" Lion, latest version) for coming on a year.\nI used to open the cover, it would search for my wifi, and in 15 seconds I could start web surfing.\nSuddenly, in the few weeks though, it is doing something strange...\nIt still finds the wifi connection in a few seconds (the Wifi icon shows all dark), but now it takes an extra 90 seconds plus until I can actually load anything in a browser.\nI noticed that Skype connects after about 90 seconds, then a few seconds later Safari allows me to start loading web pages, and then a few seconds later Chrome will let me start loading web pages.\nVery nerve wracking! Any suggestions for diagnosing this or speeding this back up again?\n\nA: You can also boot up to the start up disc that come with your mac if it is 10.6 of newer. There you can connect your wifi when the disc has loaded up to check make sure its not a software issue.\nYou can also try resetting the P-Ram on startup, by holding P + R + cmd + alt and letting its chime 3 or 4 times. That may help.\nAlso check with other machines to see how long it takes to receive an ip address. This may be an issue with the router.\n\nA: This could be the same Lion WiFi issue that has been mentioned by Dan Benjamin in The Talk Show podcast, in which case switching off Bluetooth may be a workaround, although it doesn't work for everyone. \n\nA: I would definitely try deleting the Wi-Fi network you are experiencing the described problem with. Sometimes MacOS starts acting strange on networks it has credentials stored for for a long time.\nTo do this, go to System Preferences -> Network -> Wi-Fi -> Advanced -> Wi-Fi.  Then, press the minus sign when your network name is selected to delete it.\n\nA: You might try running namebench to see if your current DNS entries are either outdated or else now slower than you're used to - it's a great utility anyway.\nJust to be thorough I'd try creating a new Network 'Location,' disabling all other network ports, and then joining your wireless - not that it should make a difference, but here you are.\n", "Q: Is there a way to sort audio by file name in the music app on iOS 5?

Music will always start from the beginning when you re-select it.\n\n\nA: I was frustrated by this as well and ended up writing a simple script for just this task using Ruby (which comes pre-installed on MacOS and is available on all OSes) with the taglib library. If you're a little programming savvy, just plug in the directory where the files are into the \"mydir\" variable and save this script (say as  \"rename_audio_title_to_filename.rb\" ). After running it, the filenames will match the title tag and when you drag them them into Itunes playlists, they will be sorted correctly.  You can also change the mp3 to other file formats that are supported.\n#! /usr/bin/env ruby\n\nrequire 'taglib'\n\nmydir = \"/path/to/my/audio/files\"\n\nDir.glob \"#{mydir}/*mp3\" do |filename|\n  TagLib::FileRef.open( filename ) do |fileref|\n    tag = fileref.tag\n\n    puts \"The title is #{tag.title} and will become #{File.basename(filename)}\"\n    tag.title =  File.basename(filename)\n    fileref.save\n  end\n\nend\n\nThen just run it: \nruby rename_audio_title_to_filename.rb\n\n\nA: Updated yuvilio's script. This version does not change the title mp3 tag. Instead it extract the number from the file name and writes it as 'track' mp3 tag. The file name is expected to be in the form '232 - your file name.mp3'. If your file name is in different format, you can modify the regular expression /(\\d*) -.*/.\n#! /usr/bin/env ruby\n\n# The script extrats the number from the beginning of the file name\n# of the form '123 - The File.mp3' and save it as a 'track' mp3 tag.\n#\n# Based on https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/71220/201515\n\nrequire 'taglib'\n\nmydir = '/Users/evgenii/Downloads/audio'\n\nDir.glob \"#{mydir}/*mp3\" do |filename|\n  TagLib::FileRef.open(filename) do |fileref|\n    tag = fileref.tag\n    track_scan = File.basename(filename).scan(/(\\d*) -.*/)\n    next if track_scan.empty?\n    track = track_scan[0][0].to_i\n    tag.track = track\n    # tag.title = \"#{track_scan[0][0]} - #{tag.title}\" # Uncomment to prefix the track number in the title\n    fileref.save\n  end\nend\n\n\nA: I found one easier solution. I simply changed CD number in the file's info. For example 01-01 I just put track 1 CD 1. When I did this randomly for file 03 -01 (track 1 CD 1), the files reorganised themselves. :)\n", "Q: Where is a dmg file mounted?

Specifically, the images become pixelated and unreadable.\nI wish to read more of the very large image comics there are rendered unreadable with this app.\nIs this a limitation inherent to the hardware of the iPad (e.g. not enough ram or GPU) or perhaps limited by the app's design? I can't confirm hardware being the cause, in fact I feel like it's the app rather than the device. Other apps like Safari do well with detailed large pictures given enough time to download and render them.d\nAre there better manga/comic readers for viewing large images on the 1st gen iPad?\nEdit: The majority of manga I'm reading works fine.

I don't know personally how to change individual aspects of iTunes though.\n", "Q: Weird display issue on OS X Lion when switching external monitor I'm using a MBP with a second (external) monitor and since I upgraded from Snow Leopard to Lion, I encountered some display issues that appear in the Application Switcher, and sometimes in the menu-bar.\nIn case of the menu, the font in the dropdown appears with jagged edges, as if there suddenly was a huge contrast-change affecting only the menu-items.\nIn case of the Application Switcher, the effect is even worse as shown in this image:\n\nInterestingly, this glitch seems to only affect overlays like the Application Switch or the menu. The rest of my OS and all Applications are looking fine.\nIf I go to System Preferences and choose another color-profile for my monitor, the issue is gone. If I select the previously selected color-profile, the issue appears again. The issue happens with every profile though. So if I choose Adobe RGB (1998) and restart my computer, the issue occurs. It disappears when I select another profile, for example Apple RGB. After a restart, the glitch will re-appear (even with the newly selected Apple RGB) and only a profile-change will remove it.\nIt's not too big of a deal, but if anybody has some pointers how to resolve this, I'd really appreciate it. Btw. the issue appears on different monitors, so it's not some monitor-hardware fault or anything.\nUpdate: I was under the impression that the issue reappears after a restart. That assumption was wrong, the issue appears whenever I switch the external monitor (eg. change from monitor at work to the one at home).\n\nA: I am also experiencing the same problems and have posted a thread to the Macbook Pro Apple Forums. While there isn't any answer yet you might be interested in following along that thread.\nSo far the only reliable way to fix it would be to restart the machine. Or to log out and log back in. Neither method is satisfactory.\n\nA: I've had an identical problem on my 2010 MBP since upgrading to Lion last fall. Here's what I did today that seemed to fix the problem:\n1) Go into Macintosh HD and find /Library/colorsync/profiles/displays\n2) Move all files in the 'displays' directory into a backup folder on your Desktop\n3) Open System Preferences > Displays and click on \"Color\" for each of your displays\n4) Your computer will take a few seconds and create a fresh display file for each monitor.   \nAfter doing this all the weird screen artifacts and colors have gone away on both my MBP LCD display and my 19\" external monitor connected with mini-DVI.\n\nA: I have been able to work around the issue using the free app gfxCardStatus to switch between integrated and discrete graphics on my MBP.\nIt doesn't matter which you use, switching to the other one fixes the problem until next time.\n\nA: Here's a sequence I have had some luck with without having to log off and on.\n\n\n*\n\n*MBP in standby mode.\n\n*Ensure monitor is turned off.\n\n*Hook up external monitor cable.\n\n*Open MBP and wait for recognition of second monitor.\n\n*Power on the second monitor and sign in.\n\n\nThis works with both my Dell and Lenovo monitors.

I have tried this with \"--no-init-file\" so I know it is not a conflict with my particular Emacs configuration. Some older tips I have found suggest mapping Command-V to 'yank. This does not work for me. \nDoes anyone know if there is a way to make TextExpander work in Emacs 24?\nNote: I know TextExpander works in Aquamacs and I know about textexpander-sync-el, but both of those cause other problems for me and, if at all possible, would prefer a solution that doesn't involve those two things.\n\nA: I would suggest that even though emacs is running as a Cocoa application, it is not necessarily using a standard Cocoa text input box / field, due to the complexities of a emacs enviroment. So emacs in this case is probably more similar to a X11 program wrapped into a Cocoa gui and does not know how to communicate with TextExpander.\nAs referenced from TextExpander Support, but anyways contact their support to get the definite answer.\n\nDoes TextExpander work with Java, X11, and/or Parallels?\nNot at this time. Mac OS X's assistive devices key logging does not support these environments. TextExpander relies on assistive devices key logging to capture keystrokes and so does not work in these environments. We continue to explore ways we might support these environments in a future version of TextExpander.\n\n", "Q: Internet page not loading, ping not working but host www.example.com return an IP Sorry I'm being vague because I don't even know where the problem can be.\nYesterday I was using the internet just fine.

For the last 2 weeks Software Update on my Snow Leopard box seems to hang at \"Installing 1 item...Writing files...\".  Where can I look to see if it is making progress or just hung up?  It has been trying to finish today's Software Update for over 2 hours now.  It feels like it is hung but I would like to be sure before I kill it.\n\nA: So it looks like the Console application is the only way to \"view the logs\", so to speak.  I launched it from the Finder under \"Applications/Utilities\".  It is rather sparse, but it does have information regarding the update.\nI am having more success watching the progress of Software Update by executing it from the command line of a terminal.  This I launched as\nsudo softwareupdate -i -a -v\n\nI still don't expect it to complete, but am hopeful that I can get a better clue as to why it is failing.

These are my Macbook Pro's features:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mac OSX 10.7.2\n\n*2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 \n\n*4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3\n\n\nWhich software would be the most suitable for me, considering that I want to focus on developing .Net Applications.\nI know there's VMWare Fusion and Parallels but maybe there's something better or if not, which one would be the best for me? Thanks.\n\nA: I'm a Fusion user and have been for a few years now. Fusion 4.x has been a nice upgrade and it's a very stable way to run the latest Windows OSes on OS X. I think you'll be fine with Fusion or Parallels -- both are tested and support Win7. VirtualBox is a nice option, but be prepared to go it alone if you run in to any issues.\nNone is really better than the other in my opinion. They all have some overlapping features and they all have some features that are unique to the product. Try before you buy if you can.\nI will comment on your system: you're going to find things running slow with only 4GB of RAM and a Win7 VM for development work. Visual Studio is a pig and it's running on top of an OS that's not terribly great at memory management. I'd recommend you upgrade that 4GB to 8GB (or more if your model supports it) if you want the best virtualized OS experience.\n\nA: I am unfamiliar with Parallels, but I have tried both VirtualBox and VMware Fusion. I have been using VMWare Fusion for well over a year now with no problems. One of the features of Fusion that I find quite useful is Shared Folders, which I discussed on this Ask Different answer. \nHaving said all of that, to really get the most out of your hardware when using Windows, running it natively via Boot Camp is hard to beat. I talk about this on this Ask Different answer. In short, if you are using VMware Fusion, I would recommend upgrading your system to 8 GB of RAM. While it is not impossible to get by with just 4 GB, having twice the RAM makes a noticeable difference when using something like Visual Studio 2010. \nHope this helps. \n\nA: There's also VirtualBox which is free. It's not quite as polished as Parallels and I haven't tried Fusion, but give it a try and see if it's good enough for you.\n\nA: You might test Virtualbox https://www.virtualbox.org/ (it's working on osX and emulate Windows 7) it's free.\n\nA: A definitive answer about Parallels\nI like parallels. That is not a \"parallels vs Fusion\" statement. It works fine, I've not run into any problems.\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Early 2011\" MacBook Pro with OS 10.7.3, 8GB memory\n\n*Parallels 6\n\n*Windows 7 64 bit, VisualStudio 2010 with CodeRush\n\n*Other coding tools as desired.\n\n\nPoints to Ponder\n\n\n*\n\n*4GB of memory simply is not enough\n\n*Given Parallels 6, version 7 is not a worthwhile upgrade from what I gather.\n\n*Giving the Virtual Machine half the CPUs and 2GB memory seems to be a nice compromise with OS X.\n\n*The different \"view modes\" are nice. You can make Win apps look like any other mac apps on the dock. That was creepy for this diehard Mac fan, but it's a nice workflow as I keep the windoze vm running and jump back & forth a lot.\n\n*General integration with OS X is nice. I use a single downloads folder for all my windoze & mac browsers. I generally keep all my documents and .NET code projects in my Mac folder structure and I configured the VM's C: drive kinda small.\nVirtual Box\nCheap - like free. I use this on my PC at work. It's OK. It works; nothing to rave about. It's actively kept updated. Don't have experience with the Mac version. Nonetheless parallels OS integration and active support makes the cost worth it for me.\nPerformance\n\n\n*\n\n*Dump the CD ROM player and get 2 internal drives, make your boot drive an SSD.\n\n*Running the virtual machine on an SSD is a game changer. I cold boot my mac and I'm running VS2010 in about 30 seconds. It is freaky fast. \n\n*SSD notwithstanding, you really do no want to run the VM from an external drive. On my work PC, the VM is on an external drive.

I am trying to troubleshoot battery life issues in OS X Lion on my MBA13. Is there an app (or hidden system information) that can tell me how long my computer has been on since last full charge. I am not looking for uptime, but looking specifically for Time Since Last Full Charge, just as is available in iOS.\n\nA: Everything you need is provided with OS X.\nFor graphical details and an overview, open Activity Monitor and the energy tab lists the time you have been on your current power source:\n\nIn my case, it was showing 5 hours on AC power, so I disconnected the charger to show that the battery is just starting up. The graph on the right will give you a nice history if you go between multiple charge/drain events over the last 12 hours.\nFor details, use the pmset command in terminal app:\npmset -g log\n\nSince that log is verbose, you might start with filtering the messages about Using\npmset -g log | grep Using\n\n\nA: You could try MiniBatteryLogger \nIt helped me troubleshoot my battery issues.

I'm troubleshooting a relative's Mac and the Finder sees her \"Pictures\" folder as a bundle. When I right-click to see the package's content, I can see that the folder seems to have the same structure as an iPhoto Library.\nWhat could have caused this, and how can I turn the Pictures folder back into a regular folder?\nI know this is a little vague. Obviously, the person doesn't know anything about that, never realized that the pictures folder was weird, etc. So I'm kinda left in the dark too.\n\nA: I'm still not sure how the Pictures folder came to believe it was an iPhoto bundle. Most of the cleanup was just restoring an older version of the Pictures folder from Time Machine.\nTo turn the Pictures bundle back into a folder, I took the SetFile executable from my Mac (ships with the developer tools) and executed SetFile -a b Pictures.\nThis is important, because Mac OS will prohibit most actions done against basic folders in the user directory structure. You cannot move or delete the Pictures folder (and if you sudo your way through it, you will be missing some extended attributes on your new folder), so turning it back to normal was an essential step.\n", "Q: Wireless Keyboard disconnects I am having a little trouble with my wireless keyboard.\nIn the past 3 weeks it has disconnected 3 times and then reconnected after a few moments. The Magic Mouse is working fine alongside it, and the power is up over 70%.\nAny advice for when this happens or why this happens would be appreciated.\n\nA: Mine did this for a bit - turn it off, pull out the batteries, and turn it on again. Failing that, un-pair it from your computer (ideally, pair it with something else too) and then re-pair - this solved my problem (although it was never as regular as yours). \n\nA: It seems like Apple is aware of this happening now and then, and has built some support into Mac OS X to minimize the problems. They call it \"Favourites\". It basically means that the OS will prioritize re-pairing the favourited device if it looses connection with it.\nVisit Apple Support for more info: http://support.apple.com/kb/TA21371\n\nA: Finder > Search > Type\nIf your keyboard mysteriously fails to register key presses while working in an app, try this workaround: \n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to the Finder.\n\n*Click in the Search field, and type.

Several times now I have created a playlist on my phone and the next time I sync to my mbp, itunes blows away the playlist on the phone.  I had expected that iTunes would copy the playlist to the computer.  Is there a way that I can prevent these playlists from being deleted?\n\nA: It sounds like you have 'playlists' ticked in your syncing preferences and that iTunes is overwriting your playlists with no playlists as it syncs from the computer.\nFirst thing to do is to check that Playlists are not being synced under the device in iTunes and Music. Uncheck \"sync playlists\" and try again.\n\nA: *\n\n*Create a new playlist on the iPhone and add some songs to it\n\n*Connect the iPhone to iTunes\n\n*From the Summary tab in iTunes, check the \"Manually manage music and videos\" then click \"Sync\"\n\n*The playlist should appear under your iPhone entry in iTunes now\n\n*Now uncheck the \"Manually manage music and videos\"\n\n*Navigate to the Music tab and check \"Sync Music  and Entire music library\"\n\n*Sync again and the playlist will appear in your iTunes library. \n\n\nI am not sure whether this is some kind of bug but it worked for me by following the above instructions. \nOtherwise iTunes would delete the contents of the iPhone-created playlist upon sync without following the above steps.\n\nA: Might not be the perfect solution, but iTunes Match will sort this. I create on the fly playlists all the time when I'm out, and they're immediately available on other devices. \n\nA: This drove me mad when I inadvertently deleted all my playlists...\nUnplug iPhone from PC.\nin your iPhone:\nGo to Settings - Music - \nthen\nTurn off iCloud music library.\nWhen you reconnect your iPhone to PC - should now be able to select the music tab under your mobile device in iTunes and select which playlists you want to sync.\nvoila! they should be back on your trusty phone.\n", "Q: Google on my iOS devices is stuck in a different region than I live in For some reason, my browser always defaults to New Zealand.

I'd like to password protect a text file. Not necessarily a .txt file - just a file that's got text in it that I can edit with a standard text editor. I'd like to set a password and be prompted for it every time I open the file in any app. What's the best way?\n\nA: Easy Method\nAppstore / GUI:\nInstall the free software \"Encrypto\" from the Appstore. Encrypto: secure your files. Drop the file (e.g.: filename) you want to encrypt from Finder, add your password hint and then \"save as\", which gives you a filename.crypto. Don't forget to remove/delete the original file.\nAdvanced Method\nTerminal / Command Line: find your text file and use gpg:\ngpg --symmetric filename \n\nwhich asks you for a password you have to give twice, the output is filename.gpg in the same directory.\n\nA: You can print->save as PDF->password protect the PDF. It's not as transparent as having the .txt in a DMG, but it's easy enough to copy/paste the contents when it's time to edit.\nAnother container version akin to a DMG is OpenPGP. The suite for OS X is pretty nice, and it adds encrypt/decrypt to the services menu. It's very easy to right click your text file, choose 'Encrypt File' enter a password, verify, done.\nDon't forget Keychain Access as well. It has the ability to create Secure Notes, which are password protected by the keychain they are stored in.\n\nA: Assuming you're the file's owner, a built-in and system-wide way to do this would be to adjust the file's permissions so that only a specific user or users (I'm assuming you want to lock the file so only you can view/edit it) can read or write to the file.\nAs Mark pointed out in the comments, however, this only protects you if:\n\n\n*\n\n*No other user has admin rights to the machine, and\n\n*No one gains access to the machine while you're logged in\n\n\nMaking Coconut Man's solution by far a better one. I'll leave this answer here as an alternative that may be helpful in similar situations.\n\nA: You can put the file into an encrypted disk image.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open \"/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility\"\n\n*File > New > New Blank Image...\n\n*In the new image dialog make sure to choose:\n\n\n*\n\n*Encryption = 128 or 256-bit AES\n\n*Image Format = read/write disk image\n\n\n*Because you chose encryption, you will be prompted to set a password for the disk image\nYou now have a password-protected disk image that you can save any kind of file in.\n", "Q: CCC Lion HD to larger Drive, Advice I'm running CCC (carbon Copy Cloner) beta 3.4.4-b1\nI would like to change the Hard Drive in my iMac and wanted to know if there are any hurdles, steps I should take in cloning my current Hard Drive\nUPDATE:\nLooks like my HD Dock stops the hard drive disk after a long period while backing up, Here is what I have:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.sabrent.com/category/hard-drive-enclosures/DSH-USB2/\n\nA: It's generally a good advice not to run beta software for critical operations. Use a stable version. I use SuperDuper personally.\nAfter cloning the drive, you should be able to just hook up the new cloned hard drive to your iMac and the computer will be just like when you cloned it. If you do any work after cloning it, the cloned drive won't have that changes.\nEvery Lion installation creates a recovery partition for when you want to reformat the drive or when something bad happens to your OS.\nIf you just clone your main hard drive partition, your Lion recovery partition will not be cloned.\nThis means that you will not be able to boot into your recovery partition in your cloned drive. There are a few ways to get around this, but I haven't tested this myself:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Lion on your new drive before you clone your old data to it.\n\n*Install Lion on your new drive and use Migration assistant instead of cloning.\n\n\nA: I did exactly what you're trying to do recently using CCC 3.4.3 with no issues. I'd advise against using the beta as well. No reason for it really. 3.4.3 works with Lion.\nCCC's standard file-level copy will create a bootable copy of your Mac's main partition, but it will leave behind the Recovery partition.\nIf you're worried about that, you can get CCC to do a block level copy instead of a file-level copy, which will preserve the recovery partition. This requires the new drive to be slightly larger than the original, and it also requires that you're running CCC from neither of the drives you're trying to clone.\nMy approach was to do a fresh install of Lion onto a 16GB USB drive. 8GB might work, and I like having a bootable USB version handy anyway. I then booted my machine from this USB drive, downloaded and installed CCC and started the block level copy from my internal drive to the new one in a FW800 enclosure.\nThe result was an exact duplicate of my old drive, but with more space. Booted up perfectly. You can read more about the block level copy feature here.\nPS: According to this FAQ, you could just do the file-level copy of the main partition, then recreate the recovery partition after the fact using the  Lion Recovery Disk Assistant. So that might be worth a shot too.\n", "Q: How can I fix or diagnose problems when Find My Mac doesn't work? I have 13\" MacBook Pro (Early 2011) with Mac OS X 10.7.2.

They need to sync with the same iTunes. They have different e-mail, contacts, sync information, but use photos, audio, and video from the same multimedia library on my PC and NAS. How should I set that up? Currently I have problems with the iPod Photo cash and there might me more issues that I have not discovered yet? \nThanks. \nThomas. \n\nA: There shouldn't be a problem with this at all. Simply connect the devices and set them up as normal. I have an iPod, iPad, and several iPhones that sync with my Mac and I have not encountered any problems.\nAs far as using different email, contact, and sync info, you can set up all of that on the actual device itself in \"Settings\" > \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\". \nSyncing with iCloud\nIf you will be syncing email, contacts, and calendars using iCloud on each device, be sure to uncheck the following in the \"Info\" tab in iTunes:\n-\"Sync Address Book Contacts\"\n-\"Sync iCal Calendars\"\n-\"Sync Mail Accounts\"\nSyncing without iCloud, Using Sync Data from Your Mac\nIf you will be syncing email, contacts, and calendars using the info that is on your Mac, check off the following in the \"Info\" tab in iTunes, and then select which email account, contact list, and calendars you want to sync:\n-\"Sync Address Book Contacts\"\n-\"Sync iCal Calendars\"\n-\"Sync Mail Accounts\"\nSyncing Content from the iTunes Store\nAs far as syncing audio and video that was purchased from the iTunes Store, you will need to enter the proper account information on each device.

I've tried turning these settings off then on again while Numbers had been killed.  Still, I see no spreadsheets on the iPhone.  I can see them on iCloud.com and on my iPad.  What gives?\n\nA: There isn't much to troubleshoot with iCloud syncing and the iOS version of Numbers. (In the sense that even using Xcode to look at the console logs on the device, the error messages are thin to nonexistent.)\nWhen you enable iCloud on one device it should push all the local documents to iCloud so you don't have to connect to iTunes and manage the files manually.\nThere are three avenues to make the best progress to resolving this issue:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try your account on another device to rule out your account needing attention before you call on Apple for help.\n\n*Try another account on your device to rule out your device's software or settings (or a very long shot that somehow your hardware could be causing it)\n\n*Wait it out or call on Apple to investigate.\n\n\nA: Are the spreadsheets there on a computer if you go to the website? If not then they haven't been uploaded, maybe the app crashed or didn't upload them before it closed.\nHave you used up all your iCloud storage?

The end result should look somehow like\nInternet Router <--LAN--> Time Capsule <--WiFi--> Airport Express\n\nwith the Time Capsule and the Airport Express both running in the same WiFi network.\nBased on the documentation I found (e.g. HT4262) I assume I should create a WDS network but this somehow doesn't seem to work (the Express disappears from Airport Utility as soon as I define it as a WDS relay/remote base station).\nSo how do I have to configure the network in both the Time Capsule and the Airport Express to get this to work?\n\nA: Have you tried the automatic configuration for the Express?\nDon't do anything on the Time Capsule. \nDo a cold reset of the express and bring it up on the Airport Utility.  You should have an option to join an existing Airport network. Choose the option to extend the range. That should do it.\n\nA: I don't think you want to set up a WDS, but rather to use the Airport Express in \"client mode.\"\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1731\n\nA: you cant extend the 802.11n network because the express operates on 'g' wireless. only way is to set up WDS, but thats compromising to your bandwidth and not a good idea. sorry.

However, I would imagine this doesn't work on the disk you've just booted from. So I suspect you'll either have to find another Mac and connect yours in target disk mode via a Firewire cable, or physically remove the drive and connect it to another Mac using a disk caddy, to wipe it the way you wish.\n\nA: It should be possible to boot an external drive (including the installation DVD) in single user mode:\nHold Option as you turn the power on, select the DVD/HDD with the arrow keys then press and hold Command+S+Return, holding them down until you see the now-familiar-for-you console boot: at which point it would be possible to use a whole disk shredder as mentioned by scottishwildcat.\n\nA: Had the same task. And finally I've found the way to do it without other mac.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot in single user mode from external hdd / recovery. (see @Ryccardo answer). Note: you can't erase partition you booted from.\n\n*Create new partition in place of one you want to erase:\n\nnewfs_hfs -J 0 /dev/diskXsY\n\nMake sure to change X & Y in diskXsY to proper values.\nNote: create with journal (-J option) to override previous journal, which can make impossible to mount partition in single user mode.\n\n*Mount created partition.\n\n*Fill partition with (random) data. The easiest way is to create large file(s) to occupy all space. You can use openssl rand or dd of=… bs=… count=… as described in answers of this question.\n\n*Optional: securely remove created file(s) with srm.\n\n\nNote: maybe this method will not fully erase data such as previous files' names / dir structures, if such data stored in some system areas of fs. I'm not sure, because I don't know how HFS+ stored. But in my case it's not a problem.\n\nA: If you want to completely wipe it, I'd think you could type this in single-user mode, hitting return after each \"-----\": /sbin/mount -uw / ----- rm -rf *\n", "Q: FileVault Performance Compromise? I'm thinking of using FileVault to secure my computer - it looks like an ideal solution for everything. However, I'm wondering - will it effect the performance / battery life of my computer significantly?\nI've got a 2010 MBP with 8gb RAM and a 500gb WD HDD, and the battery at the moment is good for about six hours. I'm running OSX10.7.1.\n\nA: I can't comment on how Lion's FileVault 2 affects battery life, but I've had it running (Full Disk Encryption) on an older (2007) MacMini with 3GB of RAM for a few months, and it is a great solution for keeping a computer that might get stolen secure.\nBeyond the initial encryption, which took a few hours, I really haven't noticed any performance difference. Given that this is an older machine, any negligible difference I might have missed would be even smaller on a newer machine like yours.\nI was curious about this myself at the time and found this AnandTech article, which boils it down to a negligible CPU load, and a slight hit to your hard drive's throughput. They were using an SDD though, so the results may not exactly correspond with a spinning disk.\nSo if you're reading and writing to the disk a lot, you might notice a slight decrease in battery life as reads and writes will take a bit longer, but I doubt it'd be anything too drastic.\n\nA: This depends on whether your MBP has an Intel processor which supports Intel® Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) which is also used in Filevault 2.\nArs Technica, published an extended review on Filvault 2 in Lion. They say:\n\nApple also leverages the special-purpose AES instructions and hardware on Intel's newest CPUs, further reducing the CPU overhead. The end result is that regular users will be hard-pressed to notice any reduction in performance with encryption enabled.\n\nMy experience\nHardware: Intel 2635QM (MBP early 2011) which supports AES encryption and Crucial M4 128GB SSD.\nI'm downloading, listening to music, have several applications running, and SophosAV live scan enabled. My processor stats using iStat Pro: Idle 97%\n\n*\n\n*I have noticed a drop in read speeds of merely 4%.\n\n*As the overall CPU load is nearly unchanged, the battery life is not affected significantly: In overall power consumption I will neglect the power drain of the SSD. The CPU and hard drive are the only significant factors that change the power consumption when disk encryption is enabled, I assume.\n\nIn answer to your question\nSee this list which compares all Intel processors used in the MBP released in 2010 (scroll to bottom, look for 'AES New Instructions'). Only four out of the six processors support AES instructions. However, it is possible that Apple did not choose to enable this functionality. This happened to my 2635QM. AES support was added later via a firmware update.\n", "Q: DNS Problem with my Macbook Pro I have a problem with my Macbook Pro. I suspend it and if I should open it up and the wifi is connected and all looks pretty well. But I have no connection with my DNS Server. Other devices works well. I can ping all ip adresses but I can't resolve any hostnames. \nMy Router is a \"Vodafone Easybox 903\". I don't know what the problem is, and I don't know how I can solve it.\nMy Macbook is the only device with this problem. My girlfriends MacBook Pro, iPhones, Apple TV and my Ubuntu PC work without any Problems.\n\nA: Try using Google DNS - it will solve the problem, but doesn't go very far as to explaining why it's only your computer experiencing it. It might be worth checking in your hosts file to see if there are any unexpected entries. \nOpen Terminal\nType \"Sudo nano /etc/hosts\"\nEnter your admin password\nYour ouput should be something similar to the following:\n##\n# Host Database\n#\n# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface\n# when the system is booting.

But now my ipod will not play nor charge. Is there some kind of updated docking attatchment i can get for my boston? \n\nA: To answer that question, you need to contact the Boston company's technical support department.\nThere was an issue some time ago when Apple rolled out iOS 4 and several third-party iPod interfaces designed for iOS 3, notably those of Volvo car stereos, could no longer work correctly with the new version of iOS. Apple changed the specification for interfacing, in an undocumented way with no advance warning, and certain devices were effectively rendered incompatible if the customers with devices running iOS 3 innocently updated to iOS 4. This was a rotten outcome for consumers, as there was no way to revert to iOS 3 short of jailbreaking and a difficult downgrading procedure, which Apple would certainly not support.\nYour new iPod runs iOS 5. If you have an older model Boston dock, designed for iOS 3, perhaps this is related to that problem. Hopefully the Boston company can explain to you what the situation is and what can be done about it.\n", "Q: Videos taken with an iPod Touch (or iPhone 4GS) play upside down on my Windows PC Anybody has an idea why videos taken with an iPod Touch (or iPhone 4S) play upside down on my Windows PC with Windows Media Player? However with QuickTime, videos are oriented correctly.\n\nA: Windows Media Player is either ignoring or misinterpreting the orientation information in the video's metadata.\nSince QuickTime better supports the format that your iPhone records in, it makes sense that it's doing a better job.\nIf you want to use Windows Media Player, your best bet is probably to convert the video into another format that WMP supports better. One app that allows you to do this is HandBrake.\nOtherwise, you should be fine using QuickTime, iTunes, or a Mac.\n", "Q: Manually sync multiple devices through iCloud We have an iPad and iPhone that I know we can set up to sync through iCloud. We also have several iPods. Will setting up iCloud for the iPad and iPhone affect our ability to manually sync the iPods?\n\nA: No, it won't affect your ability to manually sync the iPods.  Although you should clarify precisely what you m ean by \"manually sync\", as this could mean numerous things: an iTunes data backup of the device, music & media transfers, metadata syncing, purchase syncing, Contact syncing, etc.\n", "Q: Can't delete copied Time Machine files I'm trying to move my time machine backup files all under Backups.backupdb to another drive. I initiated a file copy overnight. In the morning I saw that only certain backups(folders with dates) got copied over. I then tried to copy over the ones that didn't get copied...but the OS wouldn't allow me to do that. I got and error that \"The operation can’t be completed because backup items can’t be modified.\"\nSo then I though, ok. I'll delete the incomplete copy from my new drive and then try to start a whole new copy.\nI started the delete and it prepared all night (I can see it counting all the files in the delete dialogue box). HOWEVER, in the morning I saw the error \"The operation can't be completed because unexpected error occurred (error code -8003).\nI tried to search online for info about it and can't seem to find anything.\nI also tried to hold down the OPTION key while emptying the trash and that didn't work.\nHolding down SHIFT+OPTION while emptying got me the -8003 error right away...I didn't have to wait for it to count all the files.\nWhat is going on? How can I delete these files? I don't want to format my drive because it has other files on their that took a LONG time to copy.\n\nA: I went through this just last week.

I've not had to do it on an external disk, though. \nYour alternative is to delete using the command line (sudo rm should override everything) Disclaimer::  you can do an immense amount of damage to your system using this so ensure you are deleting the right thing. This was on a related Apple Support Forums post - similar logic applies, except that the HDD will be mounted in /media/disk####### so you need to go there, and it wont be in .Trashes - it'll just be in the folder you put it in.\n", "Q: Is there a faster way to copy time machine files from one disk to another? I'm trying to move my time machine backup files all under Backups.backupdb to another drive. I initiated a file copy overnight (b/c I saw that it took OSX forever to prepare for the copy...it basically was counting the files for hours). In the morning I saw that only certain backups(folders with dates) got copied over. I then tried to copy over the ones that didn't get copied...but the OS wouldn't allow me to do that. I got and error that \"The operation can’t be completed because backup items can’t be modified.\" So my plan is to delete the incomplete copy on the new drive and then try to copy over the Backups.backupdb folder again.\nPretty frustrating. Is there a faster way to copy these files via a terminal command so that it doesn't perform all of that file counting prep?\nI probably can tar up the entire folder and then do a copy, but will that interfere with any of the file permissions, etc.? The one thing with this approach is that I don't have any more space on my source volume for the tar.\nUPDATE\nI've tried some of the methods that people have suggested below, specifically using Disk Utility's restore function and it's giving me some error messages and unexpected results (at least to me).\nI've tried to do the restore two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*With \"Erase Destination\" checked : Each time (I've tried twice), when the restore has finished I see a message \"Could not restore - Invalid Operation\" and \"Could not restore - Invalid Argument\". However, my destination disk does get a copy of my TM files. The weird thing is that my destination disk is EXACTLY like my source disk...even the size. My destination disk is actually 1 TB but after the restore, it shows as 200 GB when I get info from the finder. But in Disk Utility, it shows a 1 TB partition!\n\n\nI then tried to verify/repair the disk and got:\n\n    Invalid B-tree node size\n    Checking Journaled HFS Plus volume.\n    Invalid B-tree node size\n    Volume repair complete.\n    Updating boot support partitions for the volume as required.\n    Error: Disk Utility can’t repair this disk. Back up as many of your files as possible, reformat the disk, and restore your backed-up files.\n\nDon't know if I'm even suppose to verify/repair a TM disk...\n\n\n*\n\n*With \"Erase Destination\" UNchecked : The restore never starts and I get:\n\n\n\n    Could not restore - Operation not permitted\n\n\nA: Migrating a full 3TB Time Machine encrypted drive to a new 8TB one on macOS 10.14, I ran into all sorts of issues. Trying to do a restore in Disk Utility errored out with “unable to validate source” or “Operation not permitted.” Trying some other suggestions in this post and others, I was able to get exciting new error messages like “Catalog file on image/volume is too badly fragmented,” but no copy.\nWhat worked in the end, at the terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Erase the new disk with Disk Utility, matching the format of the source drive: MacOS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)\n\n*Use diskutil cs list in the terminal to get the exact byte size of the Logical Volume on the old drive, and the GUID of the new Logical Volume, as well as the disk numbers for both, e.g., disk4.\n\n*Use the exact byte size from step2 as the size of the new volume. In my case with a 3TB drive it was 2,999,772,905,472 bytes:\nsudo diskutil cs resizeVolume $new_lv_guid 2999772905472\n\n\n*Using the pv command from homebrew, do a low-level block copy of the disks. This is a lot like using dd, except you get a progress meter with ETA.\nYou need to get the disk numbers from the diskutil cs list output. Be careful. It’s very easy to accidentally overwrite your full backup drive with the new blank one here.\nsudo sh -c \"$(which pv) --buffer-size 50M -s 2999772905472 < /dev/rdisk${source} > /dev/rdisk${target}\"\n\nIf you get a permission denied / operation not permitted error here, go into Security & Privacy Preferences and add Full-Disk Access for Terminal.app.\nFor me this took about 10 hours—I let it run overnight—but, with pv, at least you get a progress meter with an ETA.\n\n*Now, expand the volume to take up all remaining space on the drive:\nsudo diskutil cs resizeVolume $new_lv_guid 0\n\nThis took ~ 3 hours for me, with about 5 years of backups. Most of that time was spent by macOS fscking.\nNow you can enjoy your new, more spacious Time Machine drive. You can repurpose the old one, or stow it somewhere safe in case something happens to the new drive.\n\nThe resizing steps seem to be important; skipping them resulted in a 10-hour file copy that yielded an 8TB volume containing a 3TB filesystem that I couldn’t figure out how to resize.\n\nUPDATE One potential downside to this approach is that because it’s a bit-for-bit copy, the identifiers are the same between the old disk and the new disk. If I connect the old full disk, Time Machine thinks it’s the new disk, tries to back up, and starts deleting old backups to make room for new ones. It seems like a fine approach for moving data to a larger disk where the older smaller disk will then be wiped.\n\nA: Why not just use terminal: \ncp -RnpP Backups.backupdb\n\n\n\n*\n\n*-R recursive\n\n*-n do not overwrite (if existing copy remnants remain from previous attempt)\n\n*-p preserve ACL's, permissions, creation/mod dates, etc.\n\n*-P preserve hard links, do not follow any hard or symlinks.\n\n\nA: A normal copy (or copy via rsync or ditto) will not replicate a Time Machine fully as it will convert two directories linked together (as occurs in successive TM backups with no change between) into two separate directories.\nThe best way is to copy the whole the disk using Disk Utility or the block copy part of Carbon Copy Cloner and probably similar on SuperDuper. \n\nA: Following the +1 comment about Super Duper!, here are the specs (they did not fit in a comment):\n\n12.250.329 files evaluated, 10.408.594 files copied. Effective copy speed 8,68 MB/s.\n\nfor cloning a magnetic 2TB Backup drive with several years of backups this year (2019).\nThis took 63h in total (the info screen would reset its clock every 24 hours, so it showed 15:04:43 in the end) as opposed to a Finder copy which I cancelled after roughly 4 days and a quarter of the files.\nObviously the magnetic disk was not the reason for this taking so long. The reason Finder copies stall on long running backup disks is the sheer number of cascading symbolic links on unchanged files, especially for many small files like Git indices.\n\nA: I had the same problem today. Tried the old drag & drop of my TM backup from my old external drive to a new one. Almost three hours later the file count was well over 1,000,000 and it was still ‘preparing’ to move them.\nHere’s what I did, and it took less than a hour!\n\n*\n\n*Restart Mac in Recovery Mode & choose Disk Utility\n\n\n*Select the new drive in Disk Utility’s sidebar\n\n\n*Click the Restore button (or go to Edit > Restore)\n\n\n*In the Restore drop-down choose the drive you want to clone/move\n\n\n*Click Restore\n\n\n*Once cloned, wait for Disk Utility to say it’s complete & click Done.\nHope this helps :-)\n\nA: rsync is a great utility for stuff like this.  I generally use it for stuff like this.  In this case I might use the -aP flags.  I think part of -a (\"archive\") is also to preserve permissions, ACLs and the like, but I'm not sure.\nIIRC, there's also a --delete option that allows you to delete the source file once it has been successfully copied to the destination.  I'd be wary of using that though - usually I do a complete mirror without the --delete option, then I'll re-run the command with the -c and --delete options.  -c is checksum, so it checks all the files you've downloaded against all those on the source via checksum, then deletes the source if there's a match, otherwise it re-copies or resumes copying as the case may be.\nEDIT: please use the -H flag in this case as per comments, in order to preserve hard links.\n\nA: This answer will not get it done faster, but I've found is a way to copy the data properly while preserving the de-duplication (hard links) and permissions. As an added bonus I use this to make a compressed dmg of the final product for archiving. \n\n\n*\n\n*Using Disk Utilities, make a disk image that is larger then your Backups.backupdb directory. I would also suggest that you use sparse bundle disk image for Image Format and Hard disk for Partitions. After this image is mounted, Get info on it and unselect Ignore ownership on this volume. \n\n*Now turn off Time Machine, and using the finder copy the Backups.backupdb folder to the mounted image. The finder will ask you for super user permissions to copy the data. Get a drink or do something else for a while. \n\n*When the copy is finished, look to be sure everything is okay and unmount the image. From Disk Utility, select Convert and turn the sparse bundle image into a compressed image. Again, this may take a while. \nYou should end up with two copies of your Time Machine backup, you can delete the sparse bundle version, and put the dmg in a safe place as an archive in time. \nOne thing I haven't tried with this is to do a system restore from the dmg, but I suspect that it should work, my goal was more for archiving the time machine incremental changes and keeping the hard link structure. \nI have also tried rsync and cp, but they didn't seem to keep the hard link structure which would end up making x times the size, x being the amount of dates you had in the past. This method worked well, but again may not get speed of a block copy solution.\n\nA: Recently I had to copy almost full TM 2Gb disk to 1Tb. So, I've written a small script to make it possible. Unfortunately target folders take more space than source folders. In case someone have ideas how it can be solved I'd like to know.\nHere's line to gist with the script – https://gist.github.com/tyzhnenko/d17b3cdc7ec6edf4164d788b552c1513\n\nA: With hard drives, when you move multiple files from one drive, the reader moves back and forth making a scary clicking noise, and it slows the transfer rate significantly, for example- one file with usb 2.0 moves at 30 mbps on my computer from 2 external harddrives, but 2 files move at 11 mbps. and 3 files move at 6 mbps. etc etc. zip files will move faster than files.\n\nA: Apple has an official tutorial for this: “Time Machine: How to transfer backups from a current backup drive to a new backup drive”.\nThe high-level steps from that page:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Check the format of your new backup drive\n  \n*Set permissions on your new backup drive\n  \n*Temporarily turn Time Machine off\n  \n*Copy your backup data from your original drive to your new drive\n  \n*Set Time Machine to use your new drive\n  \n\nThis is how the page recommends doing the copying step:\n\nCopy your backup data from your original drive to your new drive\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Open a new Finder window.

I just got a new MacBook Pro since I was due for a new machine and needed Lion for the new Xcode. I also got an Apple TV with the idea of centralizing all the digital media in my house by hosting it on my old Snow-Leopard MacBook Pro using iTunes. \nI set up the new machine using my USB drive's Time-Machine partition and fixed up a few odds and ends and am now happily using Lion there.

(Plus I use VCS systems for all the critical files in my day to day work).\nThanks!\n\nA: No. Most technically minded people have stopped trying to hack together AFP as Apple have changed the code to tighten up and only show legitimate sources not connected as direct attach storage.\nApple provides two products that let Mac Clients see a hard drive as a Time Machine backup when they are not connected DAS but instead NAS (network attached storage) which facilitates the sharing of one drive with multiple macs simultaneously and without reconnecting cables:\n\n\n*\n\n*TimeCapsule - only the internal drive is supported for Time Machine.\n\n*OS X Server - can mark any share point as being available for Time Machine use.\n\n\nYes, anything is possible in software given enough money, time or ingenuity, but for reasons I can only presume is enough smart people breaking TimeMachine and blaming Apple for lost data when using DIY Time Machine targets, this has been tightened up in Lion to preclude any easy solution that is documented at present on the internet from working.\n\nA: you can do this. I'm guessing the problem is your USB drive still has your time machine backup on it? Erase your time machine backup drive. Then set it as a shared device in system preferences sharing on your old macbook. Mount the drive on your new machine and select it as a time machine backup. I am doing this with two lion machines and don't know if it works with snow leopard to lion. But you could install lion on your old machine if it doesn't work.\n", "Q: Finder Enhancement - Customize Icon for filetype Is it possible to customize the icon that's used for certain filetypes in Mac's Finder?\nI have a folder with a bunch of .mobi files. In finder, If I view by icon or coverflow, it just shows a generic .mobi icon for all the items. I'd like to instead see the covers for each of the books. PDFs seem to already do this by showing the first page of the document as the icon.\n\nA: This works for PDFs, and many other types of documents because the OS X Quick Look Framework can natively read those filetypes. All other filetypes get just an icon rather than a preview. Best guess is that that framework doesn't support .mobi files.\nWithout native support from Apple, your best bet for .mobi (and any other unsupported file format), is to look for a plugin. A quick Google search turned up this. I don't have any .mobi files to test it on, but it's worth a shot.\nGeneric QuickLook Plugin installation guide here. Good luck!\n", "Q: Icons don't appear immediately for downloaded programs I've simply ignored this in the past, but I've always been curious. If I download a new program off the internet and drag it to my applications folder, it shows up as the default missing icon symbol, and doesn't show the actual icon until I have run it a few times, or shut down my mac, or some other similar thing.\nIs there any way to automatically show newly installed programs' icons?\n\nA: This icon is shown to tell you that the program is potentially unsafe because you haven't opened it yet and it was downloaded from the Internet.\nThe first time you open the app, you'll see a security dialog that says, \"App Name\" is an application which was downloaded from the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it?\"\n\nOnce you click Open on that dialog, the app will open and the icon will change to the app's normal icon.\nYou shouldn't need to restart or anything like that.\n", "Q: How can I access the remote clipboard when Screen Sharing into a Linux system I am using Screen Sharing to do vnc to my work computer running Linux, \nhowever the Edit -> Cut,Copy, Paste,Delete commands are all greyed out. \nIs there some way to enable these options ? \nOn a related question, I could get text from one vnc window to the clipboard when highlighted with the mouse, and can paste to the same vnc window, but I can't paste the same text to another vnc window... as if the clipboard isn't updating. Seems each vnc window remembers its own clipboard updates only, \nwhich is not what I want. Would prefer clipboard info to be available to\nall vnc windows, is this possible ?\n\nA: There's a program called vncconfig that makes clipboard integration work. Just run it in your sever like:\nvncconfig &\n\nAnd now it works. Kind of a miserably named program though. Another tip is to add vncconfig & to your ~/.vnc/xstartup script so you always have it.\n", "Q: How do I retrieve a specific photo from iCloud backup of my camera roll I just received an iPad for Xmas. I took a video through the iPad camera, which was stored in my ipad camera roll. I turned on the iCloud backup of photos previously. Last backup was before I deleted the video. Can I get back just that video without having to restore all iPad contents?\n\nA: I guess with videos and Photo Stream you're out of luck.  \nFrom the iCloud: Photo Stream FAQ:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Does Photo Stream support video?\n\n\n*\n\n*No. Photo Stream only works with photos.\n\n\n\nWith a local backup you could use something like the iOS Backup Extractor to extract the iOS files, including your video.  \nDon't know about iCloud backups and extraction of specific parts.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Are there any apps that convert files for iPhone 3G? So I have an iPhone 3G, and it can no longer be updated to the newer versions of software. So, I was just wondering if there were any apps that would be compatible with my phone to convert files and movies so I can watch/view them on my phone.\nPLEASE HELP :)\n\nA: iTunes can convert movies into an iPhone friendly format. If you have more specific needs, Handbrake is the video converter of choise on OSX.\nFor other files, applications like GoodReader or Air Sharing (link to iPhone version, there is also an universal version available) allow reading most \"standard\" document formats and also offer ways to upload files to your phone without using iTunes.\n", "Q: Identifying which iOS app caused the notification sound to play I often hear the notification bell go off in my iPhone, but when I pull down the drop-down of alert events, I dont see anything which matches the time the alert went off. Is there a way to see what event caused the alert notification to go off?\n\nA: In the settings, go to Notifications, and select Notification Center for every app with Sound selected.\nThen chose to Sort Apps by time.\nThat way, when you hear the sound, just access your Notification Center, and the culprit app will be on top.\n", "Q: How does \"...\" while replying works? I realised that in iOS-5 sms app, if I send an sms to my friend and he is replying, there will be a \"...\" showing.\n\n\n*\n\n*How is it possible that I could be notified while he is replying? How does it work?\n\n*If my friend types one character and \"backspace\", do the dots disappear?\n\n\nA: This works just like other IM apps which do this. Skype and WhatsApp come to mind. If you have the option to send these notifications turned on, and you start typing, your iOS device sends a message to the device on the other end that you're currently typing a message, which gets displayed as \"typing...\" or \"...\" to the user.\nThis is possible because the Messages app on iOS works on both the phone's SMS network and Apple's proprietary iMessage IM network. The app automatically figures out whether to use the iMessage IM network or SMS, based on who you're sending the message to.\nIf the person is using iMessage, it defaults to that, saving both of you money. If all you have for the person in Address Book is a phone number that isn't an iPhone with iMessage set up, it uses plain old SMS. Pretty smart. BTW iMessage messages are blue, SMS are green.\nMessages sent over iMessage move over the internet, rather than the cellphone's SMS network, so it'll use either your cell phone's data plan, or Wi-Fi, and maintain a relatively persistent connection to the user on the other end.\nBecause of this, it's trivial for your iOS device to periodically ping the device on the other end, and show the user that message, while you're entering text. This wouldn't be easy over the SMS network. AFAIK, the \"...\" shows up as long as you're entering text at the keyboard. If you stop typing, even if there's text already entered, it'll disappear, then reappear when you start typing again.\n", "Q: Is there a way to minimize open windows from the command line in OS X Lion? Just wondering if there is a way to retrieve open windows and minimize them from the command line in Lion?\nI have an AppleScript that does this, but it kind of slow, so wanted to know if there was anything \nThanks\nEDIT:\nI have not completely figured out how to do it yet, but there is the command line command\nosascript which allows you run applescript from the command line. So you can use:\nosascript -e \"applescript command goes here\"\n\nSOLVED:\nYes you can do it... here is how I figured it out:\n/usr/bin/osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to click (first button of (every window of (application process \"firefox\")) whose role description is \"minimize button\")'\n\nSome other application process that I have are \"Skype\", \"Finder\", \"thunderbird-bin\", AppleScript Editor\"\n\nA: I agree that pretty much any solution you can get for the command line would have to rely on AppleScript. And your solution will work. However, rather than scripting System Events, which depends on UI events (actually moving your mouse and clicking) it's a much cleaner approach to script the application's window directly.\nThis way, if you move your mouse while the script is executing, it won't affect it. For minimizing all Firefox windows you could do something like:\ntell application \"Firefox\" to set miniaturized of every window to true\n\nThe property is called miniaturized for Firefox and most OS X applications, but some third-party apps, like Google Chrome, call the property minimized, so if one doesn't work, the other should. This functionality is part of the Standard Suite that pretty much every AppleScript-able application has. \nFor applications that don't support AppleScript at all, you can fall back to your approach and use System Events to access the windows belonging to the application's specific process running on your machine.\nIf I were you, though, I'd try to rely on the application to minimize itself rather than through System Events where possible, as this will be much more reliable.\n", "Q: Is there a notepad that lets me change the background image? I want to put this blackboard as the background of my notepad, so when I type, it'll look like I'm writing on a blackboard.\nDo you know a simple text editor that will let me use it as a background image?\n\n\nA: WriteRoom is a pretty awesome text editor in general, and will let you do this through its built in custom themes feature.\n\nA: FocusWriter is another text editor that will allow you to do this, and it is free.  However, it does not have as good of a design as WriteRoom does.\n", "Q: When an old iPhone 3 can connect to WiFi but not associated with a Cell Phone carrier, can it still send files? I have an old iPhone 3 that was using AT&T as the phone carrier.

But when I try to send my old Notes written on the iPhone 3 by email or view weather or stock data, it can't access the network.\nIs it true that an iPhone 3 that has no phone carrier won't be able to use the WiFi to send or receive data?  Thanks.\n\nA: After you switch to a new iPhone, the old iPhone will still be able to access data over WiFi, just not the 3G network.  \n", "Q: How to move iPhone 3's Notes, Voice Memo to a computer before giving it away? I am giving away an iPhone 3 to a friend, and I can move all the photos and videos to a computer by copying the DCIM folder of the iPhone 3 (just like a USB flash drive or digital camera).\nBut I think the only other things are the Notes and the Voice Memos.  How can they be moved to the computer?  (I have been using the iPhone 4 for 1.5 years, so backing up the content of the iPhone 3 and restoring to iPhone 4 is not an option, I think, as it will wipe out my iPhone 4's content).\nI know we can sync Voice Memos using iTunes, but I don't even have the computer that sync with the iPhone 3 any more, and it said that if I sync with any other computer, the content of the iPhone 3 will be replaced by the iTunes library on this new computer.  Can it still work?  As long as it doesn't remove those Voice Memos and still can move them to the new computer.\nHow about the Notes?  Is there a way?  I was going to email it... (not a perfect solution), but found that even though it connects to WiFi, but without a cell phone carrier any more, I can't send or receive data through WiFi either (see this related question posted by me:  When an old iPhone 3 can connect to WiFi but not associated with a Cell Phone carrier, can it still send files? ) Is it true?  Thanks for helping.\n\nA: Are you getting a new iPhone?  Back up the old one, wipe it and sell it.  When you get the new one, you can restore your backup to the new phone.\n", "Q: Is there a recall for the iPhone 3G? My iPhone 3G which is a 16GB version can upgrade to newer iOS in the past, but for merely 2GB of total usage on this iPhone, iTunes will take an hour or more to \"Back up the data\".\nI know that some slow flash memory may take 2MB/second for data transfer, but even at that speed, 500 seconds should be good for 1GB of data, and 1,000 seconds will be good for 2GB of data, so that should be 16.67 minutes only.  (and, 2MB/s is usually a bottleneck speed for data writing, not for reading.  The speed for slow flash memory read that I usually see is 6MB/s)\nIs it a design issue or might there be even a product recall for this issue?  If the iPhone 3G is taken to the Apple Store's Genius Bar, will they be able to swap another phone that takes a lot shorter time?  (My iPhone 4 and 4S, for example, is a lot faster for backing up the data when upgrading iOS).\n\nA: The iPhone 3G is almost certainly out of warranty by now. You can't even really get a swap on it anymore in store. They've been end of lifed for quite some time and the store would have to order one for replacement. Since it's probably out of warranty, you would have to pay for it. I'm not aware of any warranty extensions for issues like this, they are usually done for obvious issues such as unexpected failure that's not due to regular wear and tear.\nIn general the 3G might sync a bit slower than an iPhone 4 or 4S, but it still probably shouldn't take 2 hours with that much data. My wild guess without seeing the phone is that the part where you're hanging up is the backup. You can verify where you're getting stuck by watching the progress indicator at the top of the iTunes window when it's hanging.\nWhen I've seen this before, most of the time it wasn't a hardware issue with the phone itself. It could be something corrupt in your backup, or an app that has a lot of data stored in it or a setting or even just a large camera roll. It could be an issue syncing contacts or bookmarks. I've also had luck with disabling the setting that sends crash logs to Apple or resetting the sync history in iTunes.\nAnother thing to check is does it have a large amount of used space marked as \"Other\" on the bar graph (at the bottom of the summary tab) when it's plugged into iTunes? There should be some space taken up by this, but if it's a GB or more you might have something corrupt in the phone that's hanging it on sync.\nIt might help to sync it and watch what step it's hanging on and to post back with that information. That way, we can give you a more specific answer on how to fix it.\n\nA: No iPhone recalls yet. On any model for any reason. \nNot even a service extension that apple typically announces when the warranty needs to be extended or modified in response to a wide spread issue or problem. \nThat doesn't mean your device isn't broken or would be swapped if you could demonstrate how it doesn't work like other models of that device. \n", "Q: Jailbroken iPhone stuck on boot screen I tried to reload Cydia, which stopped working on my jailbroken iPhone 4. I downloaded \"Redsnow\" and \"Ipsw 4.3.2\", which worked, until I went to use and downloaded an app with Cydia. \nI did not realize that this jailbreak version needed to be tethered to reboot! \nSo i put my iPhone back in sleep mode and boot from Redsnow only to have it get locked in the logo boot mode for 2 days now! Yesterday I panicked and downloaded the latest update from iTunes and did a factory instal with no avail - still in this boot logo loop \nHow can I fix this and use my phone?\n\nA: You need to first put your phone into DFU Mode. Then, run Redsnow, go to \"Extras\" and select \"Just Boot\".\n\nA: My suggest would be to restore your iPhone using iTunes and re-jailbreak it using the latest Absinthe which supports jailbreaking the most recent iOS 5.1.1.\n", "Q: What are the advantages and disadvantages to jailbreaking an iPad? I just got a new iPad 2, this is my first iOS device.\nWhat are some advantages to jailbreaking and what are some disadvantages?\n\nNote:\nPlease make sure that answers are objective.\nStick to facts, not personal preferences or ethical debates.\n\nA: For\n\n\n*\n\n*You can run any app you like, including ones not permitted by Apple, and you can run them at a system level rather than the unprivileged level they do on a normal device. \n\n*You can remove Apple services on the iPad more or less at will. \n\n*Provided you can download the image of the software, it's relatively easy to restore to a non-jailbroken state. \nAgainst\n\n\n*\n\n*Running apps at system level comes with inherent risks - malicious code can kill your iPad, and badly written code can cause an entire system crash / instability. \n\n*It's my experience that jailbroken apps (Springboard ones particularly) deplete the performance of the device (But I'm talking about an iPhone 4, rather than the more powerful iPad 2 - may be less valid). \n\n*Jailbroken iPads aren't elegible for warrantee - in theory if you reset back to default you're okay, but if that's not possible you've invalidated yourself and they are totally within their rights to refuse you service. \n\n*Jailbreaking needs to be redone with every software iteration, and with it, so do your jailbroken apps [possibly no longer true, can anyone verify?]\n\nA: Jailbreaking causes battery failure for e.g. One day i was playing fifa 12 on my jailbroken ipad 2 and in 20 minutes the battery went from 64% to 33% also the speed decreases i had to wait relatively a lot of time for apps to open, even basic ones like settings and camera which is very irritating.also if youre downloading apps it takes double the time it would have taken to download on a normal ipad 2\n\nA: Unjailbroken ios device would look more professional when compared to the jailbroken device.\n", "Q: My iPhone 3G won't receive data (using WiFi) I have an older iPhone 3G and the cell phone carrier is no longer available.  It can connect to my WiFi, but the IP Address is showing as 192.254.xxx.xxx and subnet mask as 255.255.0.0, and no data can be sent or received.  \nIf I compare the numbers with my iPhone 4S that can send or receive data, the IP Address is showing as 192.168.1.xx (a local IP) and subnet mask showing as 255.255.255.0.  Is there a way to make the iPhone 3G work like that and send and receive data?\n\nA: This means that the device was unable to get an IP address via DHCP. The router may need to be rebooted itself, or it may not be set up to hand out IP information via DHCP and your iPhone will have to be set up statically. Check with the administrator of that wifi network for exact details. If it's your own, double check DHCP is enabled for your router, and if so, perform a hard reboot of the device.\nAdditionally, it never hurts to reboot your iPhone as well.\nShould the problems persist, there may be a problem with the phone software or hardware. Restore the operating system on the phone, and try again. Should it still fail, my suggestion would be to take it to some Apple authorized repair depot for diagnostics.\n", "Q: Can my iPhone have more than one iCloud account on it at a time? Can I add more than one iCloud account to an iPhone?  For example if I set my wife and I both up with an iCloud account, could I get her calander and mine on my phone?\n\nA: No - the iCloud section of the Settings app only allows for one account on iOS 5.\nYou can however add as many iCloud accounts to the Mail, Contacts, Calendars as you have time to set up. You will see that you can enable the majority of the services on each subsequent non-main iCloud account.\nThe following items work only on the main account:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup\n\n*Documents & Data\n\n*Photo Stream\nThe following item is exclusive - any one (but only one) account can have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find My iPhone\nFor example, I use one iCloud account as my primary personal account and have a second account for a consulting business.

I'm a very new Mac user. I just bought a MacBook Pro and I'd like to use the Time Machine backup. Unfortunately, it seems like I can only keep my laptop mobile by using an Airport router. I was hoping that I could backup to a HDD shared by my Window 7 desktop.\nIs this pie in the sky? Is there a backup alternative that I could use that would give me the functionality I'm looking for?\nAdditional Information\nI'm not looking to back up files per se. My documents, pictures, etc, are backed up on mirrored externals on my PC. I'm looking for a backup that will allow me to restore my applications and their settings should the Mac ever crash - installing and configuring a system is the most time consuming part of rebuilding a machine.\n\nA: Time machine requires a specially formatted hard drive - it doesn't have to be an Apple drive and indeed can be anything you can connect to the machine, but it must be HFS+ and as such cannot be shared by Windows (FAT/NTFS). \nMy choice in this situation (I too have a W7 machine too) was to purchase a relatively cheap Western Digital Portable HDD from Amazon, let my Mac format that and use it exclusively for backups. I couldn't find anything to share them between machines at all. \nIf you're only looking to backup files, however, Dropbox may suit you well. It's free plan provides you with a 2gb folder that syncs between your computers (and the cloud). \nI'm interested in what you said about an Airport router - your Macbook should be able to connect to any Wifi A/B/G network (so pretty much anything, for instance the free router your internet supplier provides). \n\nA: Since I'm running Lion, and TimeMachine uses a different file transfer (AFP), I ended up setting up a FreeNAS box, and hooking a cheap WD HDD to it.\nIf I wasn't running Lion, I could have simply shared the WD HDD from my Windows 7 machine.

I was just doing a quick audit of the files on my hard drive and noticed that ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.iLifeSlideshow/Pictures is taking up 1.57 GB on my machine! This leads to the following questions.\n\n\n*\n\n*What is saved in ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.iLifeSlideshow/Pictures? The files appear to be from my iPhoto ('09, version 8.1.2) library, but it's not clear exactly which pictures are saved and when.\n\n*Is it safe to delete everything under ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.iLifeSlideshow/Pictures?\n\n*Are there any \"best practices\" for deleting the content under ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.iLifeSlideshow/Pictures? For example, is there any way to tell iPhoto to clear its cache rather than deleting the files directly from the Finder?\n\n\nA: By design intent, files stored in ~/Library/Caches should always be safe to delete, at least as long as the application isn't running. You can mitigate any poor programming bugs by moving them to trash and then rebooting the mac before you empty the trash as this ensures whatever programs are running can still write files to that old cache directory but will be forced to make a new Cache folder the next time it starts.\nIn your specific instance, the folder/files in question are created by iPhoto when you start a slide show. It seems that they do not get removed when you exit iPhoto later on so you have to remove them manually if you want to recover the disk space.\n", "Q: How do I format a (non-formatted) drive when the menu options in the Disk Utility are greyed out? So I tried installing Lion on an old (white) Macbook, but first I wiped by my drive clean. Just to find out that I only had 1GB memory and Lion requires 2GB.\nNow the drive is clean, with no filesystem (I think), and it won't even allow me to install Snow Leopard.\nKeeps saying 'Can't install OS X' on this computer - that happens after I boot to the install Disc and choose English.\nI am assuming it is because the drive is not formatted for an OS X friendly filesystem....but the Disk Utility option is greyed out. \nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: You need to format/partition the drive as a MacOSX Journal Extended first then you will be able to install Snow Leopard. \n", "Q: Is there a way to share photos from one iTunes account with another? I would like to share my photos that I have in my iTunes/iCloud account with another account. Ideally, I would like to be able to have anything that is in my photostream to be automatically sent to another iTunes account or that account's photostream.  \nIs there any way to do this? If not, can someone recommend a good way to automatically share my photos with other accounts?\nIs there an application that I should consider to make this happen to iPhones and iPads linked to 2 different iTunes accounts?\n\nA: You can setup your iPhoto to accept your incoming photo stream, then create a smart folder that automatically includes the contents of it, and subsequently sync's it to a 3rd party service such as Flickr, or Facebook etc.  This will allow you to share the photo stream with anyone that can access those services.  It's not wholly automated, and required you to have iPhoto running, but it may suffice.\n\nA: You can't share photo's through iCloud/Photostream with people who have another iTunes/iCloud account. Or at least not yet.\nYou could upload the photo's you want to share to a dropbox file and then share that dropbox file with other people.\nYou can upload and then access the photo's through the Dropbox app.\n", "Q: How to make global keychain in Mac OS X Lion I need to create a keychain that can be used by any user. \nWhen I check a keychain as shared in Keychain Acess->Edit->Keychain List, it just disappears and I can't see this keychain in the list anymore.\nWhat's the problem? Thanks.\n\nA: Create the new keychain in\n/Library/Keychains/\nlike the System.keychain, this way any user can access the keychain.\n", "Q: Mac OS X Lion Server: How to disable Sleep/Restart/Shutdown options for users? The Apple-Menu shows Sleep, Restart..., Shut Down... elements for all users.\nI would like to be able to prevent users from shutting down the system or from restarting the system. While a Restart... may not be result in only temporary downtime, a Shut Down... would lead to a downtime until someone has physical access to the machine.\n\nA: I've removed shutdown for my lab Macs on OS X Lion. The two commands that should accomplish this are:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow ShutDownDisabled -bool true\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow ShutDownDisabledWhileLoggedIn -bool true\n\nI've not had 100% success with them, so I've also edited the interface file at: /System/Library/Frameworks/Carbon.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/HIToolbox.framework/Versions/A/Resources/English.lproj/StandardMenus.nib/objects.xib\nIf you want to remove the Sleep and Shut Down options, look for the following id's in object and reference tags.

So I merely changed the command issued by the menu to be the same as \"About This Mac\"!   Works a treat.  I suspect a system update might revert it as some stage though.\n", "Q: loosing vi mode in terminal My favorite text editor beeing VIM made me add the follwing line to my ~/.bashrc\nset -o vi\n\nAs expected, hitting escape lets me execute a vi command, BUT ONLY ONE ?!?\nFor example if I do this: \nescape, b, b\n\nit jumps to the beginning of the word and then types \"b\" to the line instead of jumping another word back.\nThis happens on all my osx boxes (10.6 and 10.7) and non of the linuxes I use. \nAnyone else experiencing this? Or is this expected? \n\nA: You can use C-xC-e to go into editor mode. This will use vim if your $EDITOR is set to vim. Also, if you switch to zsh there are options to have a psuedo-normal mode on the command line. See this blog post describing it: http://www.civet.ws/?p=165\n\nA: If you're using set vi then C-xC-e will not open your editor as Conner suggested. Instead, use Escv.\n\nA: This problem can come up when you have both ~/.bash_profile (or ~/.profile) and ~/.bashrc files with different settings. To determine if this is your issue, try typing these commands to start a \"clean\" bash prompt and set vi mode therein:\nbash --norc --noprofile\nset -o vi\n\nIf the vim keybindings don't vanish after one movement, then read on.\nThe fix for me was first to change ~/.bash_profile to only read:\n[ -r ~/.bashrc ] && . ~/.bashrc\n\nThen I put the set -o vi option in ~/.bashrc.\nFor me, it was no problem for .bash_profile to refer exclusively to .bashrc. Notably, command-line tools with automagic installers like [gvm|http://gvmtool.net/] and [rvm|http://rvm.io/] may manipulate your .bash_profile file, so you may need to set it back after an install or update of those.\n", "Q: Apple Tv (2nd Generation) post update I just got an apple tv (the black box). I was prompted to update and so I did. When completed, the only thing that would come on screen is the large blue iTunes icon and a white cable pointing to it from below. I am assuming it is asking to connect to itunes? Not sure what to do! do I need to but the cable? \noh to note that I watched videos on it before the update (so I did set up my account and all).\n\nA: It sounds like your update failed for some reason. You're correct, the icon you're seeing on screen means that you need to connect it to iTunes. You need a micro USB cable to do this.\nWhat happens if you plug it into iTunes?\n", "Q: When I buy a Mac, does it come with reinstallation media? Can I format my Mac? If I had one, would a full OS installation media be provided? Or at least an OEM version of it? If not, how much it costs to get one of these?\n\nA: There's no such thing as an \"OEM\" version of OS X, since there are of course no OEMs for Macs other than Apple themselves.\nAll new Macs have recovery partitions on their hard drives that can be booted and used to reinstall OS X, so you can format your main partition and reinstall OS X. Failing that, they will also do a network boot over the Internet and reinstall OS X from Apple's servers. OS X also includes a program called Lion Recovery Disk Assistant that lets you create your own bootable recovery media on external drives, so you can make as many recovery disks as you want.\nFailing all of these options, you can purchase Lion on a USB drive for US$69 (if you're in the US).\n\nA: When you buy a new Mac, it comes with OSX Lion pre-installed and includes a recovery partition on the internal drive. \nIf you prefer a physical medium to do an installation from, you can buy the OS X Lion USB Thumb Drive from the Apple Store.\n", "Q: Does not boot (endless spinning) A friend of mine has forgot her password to a newly bought Macbook Pro, Lion.\n\n\n*\n\n*I've reset the password like described here by booting to single-user mode and deleting /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\n\n*The Mac booted fine and started asking for all the registration details.\nAfter everything was entered, it goes back to the beginning, asking\nto fill the address etc. AGAIN AND AGAIN, endlessly.\n\n*After entering it several times I turned it off (by holding down the power key)\nand now it does not boot at all. Grey screen and endless spinning\nwheel.\nIt still boots to single-user mode, and I tried the fsck command, but it says \"the volume macintosh hd could not be repaired\".\nI also tried resetting the NVRAM / PRAM - does not help.\nPS. I'm mostly a PC guy, and I know very little about Macs, so please be very precise on what I should do :)\n\nA: Newly purchased Macs come with 90 days of complimentary AppleCare phone and web support (as well as walk in service at all Apple retail stores). \nYou will want to follow the internet recovery steps to erase the drive and reinstall the operating system once you have ascertained that no data (pictures, documents, etc...) exist only on that Mac.\nHere is the script you will be following in a nut shell:\n\n\n*\n\n*power off the mac\n\n*boot with Command and R held down\n\n*select Disk Utility to repair or erase and re-format the drive (GUID partition scheme and Mac OS Extended (journaled) format for the volume.\n\n*download and install Lion from the internet recovery\n\n*attempt again to set up the mac\n\n\nDo consider that a hardware failure could cause things to not work as intended - a call to Apple is the fastest way to get that sorted for someone that isn't used to isolating issues on hardware.\n\nA: A few troubleshooting steps for you:\nFirstly, try resetting SMC (I notice you've already reset PRAM), you'll find instructions here\nNext, try booting into safe mode. To do this, hold the shift key immediately after you here the startup chime (not before), keep holding until you see a progress bar appear. You'll have to wait a while for it to load now as safe mode takes quite a bit longer to boot.\nIf you get in on safe mode then I'd advise copying any essential information to an external harddrive in case you aren't able to boot in again. Next you should open the disk utility (applications/utilities/disk utility) and perform some harddrive first aid. Verify disk permissions, repair disk permissions and verify disk. \nOnce you've finished in safe mode, log out and log back into single user mode and try to fsck the drive again. \nIf you still have no luck, or you were unable to boot into safe mode in the first place, you only really have two options. As bmike said in his answer you can erase the hd and reinstall using net recovery (you can use the disk utility tool to erase the harddrive at the first install screen) or you can take it in to an apple store to be repaired, as it should still be under warranty and could be a hardware failure.\n\nA: I also had and solved my MacBook Pro Lion's problem manifested by the endless spinning wheel under the apple during boot. I'll describe all the things I've tried below, but what what I ended up having to do is to buy a new internal hard drive and fresh install Mac on it.\nWhat you can try (might fix the problem if your HDD is not broken):\n\n\n*\n\n*Verbose safe boot by powering on while pressing [Shift]-[Command]-[V]\n\n*NVRAM/PRAM reset by powering on while pressing [Command]-[Option]-[P]-[R]\n\n*Repair disk by powering on while pressing [Command]+[R] --> Disk Utility --> HDD selection --> Repair Disk, note this repair would not affect your data\n\n*Apple Hardware Test\n\n*Independent HDD Check by taking out the HDD, putting it into a SATA to USB adapter, and plugging it into another Mac. It could not be found on the other Mac.\n\n\nSince none of these solved the problem for me, I went to the Apple store for the \"Genius Bar\". An Apple rep ran a Mac Resource Inspector (a specs checker available only at Apple stores) and pinpointed my problem to my hard drive. My Toshiba HDD's SMART Status was Failing, which according to the Apple rep I can only replace it and do data recovery on the broken HDD.\nEverything is pointing to the speculation that my laptop tries to detect the HDD without success, so it couldn't load anything, thus the endless spinning disk.  \nTo fix my Mac, I bought a new 2.5\" laptop internal hard drive no more than 9.5mm in height. I got a more reliable brand, since my Toshiba HDD didn't even last 2 years. I followed instructions on iFixit to replace the hard drive. Note a T6 Torx screwdriver is needed, which Apple stores do not loan out nor sell at the time of this posting.\nI made a bootable USB stick with createinstallmedia after downloading the Maverick installer on another Mac. The computer complained the boot app can't be verified, which I solved by changing the system date on the terminal (Google \"Changing system date from Terminal – OS X recovery\").  It then installed successfully and I finally got my Mac back!\nI have yet to do data recovery.\nGood luck.\n\nA: If you have a time machine backup of your data, press and hold cmd (or ⌘ / ) + R and choose 'Restore from Time Machine backup'.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 will charge in wall, but won't sync or charge via USB I have an iPhone 4 that is showing its age.  It will charge when plugged into the wall charger.  However, when I plug the same cable into a USB port on my computer it will not charge or be recognized at all by iTunes.\nWhen I plug my new iPhone 4S into the same cable it is recognized and syncs just fine.\nIs there anything I can try to get the iPhone 4 syncing via USB so I can update the OS and sync with iTunes, etc?\nEdit: I will occasionally get the \"This accessory is not optimized for this iPhone\" message when I plug the iPhone into the cable connected to the USB port.\n\nA: I know, in most cases, this problem to be the usb port on the iphone. Unfortunately this part seems to be a part which only one in five of these parts to be good from experience. Either the mic or data port are defective which makes a diy repair frustrating. Most people will change it once they hit a defect part and give up. Don't give up. Trying to help people who are frustrated as I was. Usually occurs when you update with a port having bad contacts and ends up with a no sync or no voice on phone mic. May not be what you want to hear.\n\nA: I was having the same problem- tried everything (quick cleaning, new cables; both wall and computer cables, etc.).  I was convinced it was a software problem and was super pissed at apple.  Then I took a flashlight and looked at my phone's connector contacts (on the far right and left of the \"row of information pins\".  I noticed, even after cleaning, there was still some lint or dirt.  So I bought some Cyber Clean (Swiss formula)- its a yellow gel-like substance.  I turned off my phone and literally smashed it into the bottom end and pulled it out and it was COVERED with lint.  I did this probably 30 times and was AMAZED at how much lint came out.  Now the phone charges like new.  I would highly recommend buying that stuff before investing in a new phone.  You can really jam it in, even to the point where it breaks off.  Then it will reattach to the main mass so you can pull it out.  Good luck!\n\nA: As others mentioned here, the problem is most likely dust and lint in the connector interfering with the data pins. It will prevent charging while connected to a computer. \nI had the same problem and fixed it by folding over some Scotch tape, sticky side out, and sweeping it inside the connector until the lint was cleared. Then I inserted and removed the cable connector about 20 times just to make some friction and clear the pins and that did the trick (be sure you unplug the USB side from the computer for that).\n\nA: That hapened to me once. Try replacing your USB cable.\n\nA: If the phone is intermittently recognised as something being there that iTunes can't work with, I've seen this before. \nWith my iPhone 3G, somehow I managed to get liquid onto the dock connector port. There was corrosion over the data pins but not the power pins so I could (always) charge at the wall, intermittently charge from my iMac/MBP and very intermittently get iTunes to recognise there was a device. Couldn't get it syncing though.\nI waited out the problem with a crappy phone (cheapo £10 job) a few months or so until the iPhone 4 came out. The replacement/repair option from Apple was a refurb 3G for quite a lot of money and I'd been thinking about upgrading anyway.\nThings have changed since then in terms of iOS repairs and costs so it's probably worth getting it checked out as the official options have improved since then!\n\nA: WARNING: This is probably a bad idea. If you're mostly using the 4S and just want to fix the 4 if you can, and don't mind the chance of it breaking, it's worth a try. This is the position I was in, finding myself with an extra 3GS.\nAnd it may activate the water damage indicator.\nIf you have warranty coverage, go do that instead.\nBut if you still want to try this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn the phone completely off.\n\n*Unplug both ends of one of your USB cables.\n\n*Put a bit of electrical contact cleaner on the iPhone side of the USB cable, NOT the phone itself.\n\n*Let it mostly dry.\n\n*Work that connector in and out of the iPhone a dozen times or so.\n\n*Leave it disconnected for a while, maybe overnight. Find something to distract you. Go to a movie or something. Sherlock Holmes 2 is pretty good.\n\n*Plug it all back in.\n\n\nThis will only work if the problem is crap on the iPhone connector, which from your description seems likely. But it may be a problem deep in the iPhone, too.\nNote: WD40 is not electrical contact cleaner.\n", "Q: App Store password keyboard When I go to the App Store on my iPhone 4s, the password box pops up, but the keyboard to enter the password does not pop up, so I have no way to enter a password.  Any idea how I can correct this?\n\nA: Close the app, double-click the home button to bring up the currently running apps, and hold down on the App Store until they bounce. Then kill it.\nThen you can go back into it.\nI've had a bunch of issues like this with the App Store app. sometimes I don't get the update button for apps, or no keyboard, etc. Restarting the app afresh sorts it out.\nA total phone restart should also work.\n\nA: I solved the problem on my jailbroke iPhone 4S.\nI opened 'ColourKeyboard' and went into the 'Respring' option, after respringing my App Store keyboard appeared and worked fine. You can check it by going into the App Store app and looking in the 'Featured' section then go into 'Apple ID'  then 'View Apple ID'.\nHope it works for you\n", "Q: Wake sleeping screen with mouse move not click? Prior to Lion I believe moving the mouse woke a sleeping(powersave) screen, and now in Lion you have to click. Often I am in the situation where I am about to go to bed and want to sleep my imac, but am unsure whether the machine is already fully asleep or just the screen. Previously I would simply move the mouse to find out. Now I have to click, which means I wake the machine either way i.e. if it was already off, and then have to shut it down straight after.\nIs it possible to bring back waking power saving screen with mouse move?\n\nA: I believe the wake on click issue has more to do with the pointing devices shipping with the preponderance of new Mac systems: wireless keyboards, mice or trackpads for desktops and laptops.\nThere are two potential reasons for a click:\n\n\n*\n\n*To maximize battery power, wireless keyboards, mice and trackpads power down when not in use--just like computers. \n\n*Today's mice are all optical (laser or otherwise) and they turn off the light sources when asleep. The device does not register a movement until awakened. Wired mice might still wake a computer on movement.\n\n\nI also don't believe the computer sees a difference when \"waking\" from any of the low power states available to it, be it a dimmed screen, a screen in lowest power state, or the computer \"sleeping\". A device \"click\" initiates full power mode.\n", "Q: Browsing web page stored on local machine I am developing a web site and would like to check how it looks on my iPad and iPhone.

Charge it\n  often. I’m serious! Apple uses Lithium Polymer batteries (not a\n  straight lithium ion!), which perform best when you keep them “topped\n  off”, meaning if you have a chance to charge it, then do it. I\n  generally never let myself get below 45% unless testing due to what\n  seems like unusual battery drainage. Apple also recommends that once a\n  month you drain the battery down below 10% and then fully\n  (uninterrupted) charge back to 100%. This is more for the battery\n  meter than anything. It helps the meter get a correct reading on the\n  battery and not display inaccurate information.\nSource\n\nCharging at least once a month keeps the electrons moving occasionally.\nYou can read what Apple officially says about batteries and how to maximize battery life.\n\nA: Every deep discharge cycle of a li-ion battery will add up to reduce its life.  So run the battery down to 0% as seldom as possible.\nShallow discharge cycles also reduce longevity a tiny bit, but more than proportionally much less than deep cycles.  So keep the discharge shallow if possible.  \nStorage life of the battery is actually longest when partially charged.  But if you are actually going to use your device as a mobile device, keeping the charge level nearly 100% will reduce the depth of any discharge plus full recharge cycles, and thus help maximize battery longevity.  The smart charging circuitry will do this automatically if you leave it plugged in forever.\nThe recommended monthly full 100% discharge/charge cycles do nothing good for the li-ion battery itself.  These full cycles just help the smart battery charging circuitry and the battery level meter/gauge to better calibrate themselves.  A few times a year is probably more than enough to keep the battery gauge from going way out of calibration.\n", "Q: Mac OS X, install another keyboard layout? I'm a developer and I'm just so used to using Spanish (Argentina) as my keyboard layout on my PC both at home and at work.

The two tools referred to in the answers are Ukulele and Spark.\nUkulele allows you to edit keyboard layouts (thus creating the layout you want), while Spark creates shortcut key combinations, which you could use to remap a few keys to create the layout you want.\n\nA: I created this project in github for Latin American keyboard in macOS, maybe it helps you. https://github.com/neosergio/Latam-Keyboard\n", "Q: No image on TV when connected using HDMI cable to MacBook pro when booted in bootcamp I have a MacBook Pro with an NVidia GT 330M graphics board and mini display port output.\nI purchased an HDMI converter for the computer, and connected it to my TV (Panasonic GT30). When booted in OSX, the TV displays the image correctly.\nHowever when booting in bootcamp, there is no image on the TV, it's just black. The display drivers can see that a Panasonic TV is connected, and I can select from the possible display resolutions, but the monitor just remains black.\nI downloaded and installed the NVidia reference drivers (don't know if it was a bad idea, but one of the points was to be able to display stereoscopic 3D).\nWhy is the monitor black?\nEdit: I tried connecting to an older Sony TV. Same result, the NVidia drivers can detect that a Sony TV is connected, but the TV is black. I also tried selecting different resolutions and refresh rates, no luck there either.\nThe bootcamp install is running Windows 7 64bit\n\nA: I got it to work, I'm not sure exactly what I did in what order, but based on my Firefox download history, I think this is what I did.\nFirst I downloaded and intalled version 285.62 (285.62-notebook-win7-winvista-64bit-international-whql.exe).

I have a new mp3 in iTunes, and despite how many times I sync it with my iPod, the new song will not be copied. I tried to remove all songs from that artist, and add again, but the new song is still not on the iPod.\nThere is no message or indication of an error.\nAny idea what's wrong here? (using a fourth-gen iPod touch and iTunes 10)\n\nA: As @iampearce answered in the comments:\n\nIf you're manually syncing, grab the file from in iTunes and drag it\n  onto the iPod itself. This will force it to copy over, and you'll be\n  able to see it happen in the progress bar.\n\n", "Q: How can I have ClickToFlash except for YouTube? I use the ClickToFlash Safari extension, out of concern for Flash security vulnerabilities and to remove annoyances. However, I do not like its replacements for YouTube video players over YouTube's own player.\nHow can I configure ClickToFlash so that it does not affect YouTube players (whether on YouTube pages or embedded), but blocks/replaces all other Flash? Putting “www.youtube.com/” in the “Allow Flash on these sites:” list works for YouTube itself, but not embedding.\n\nA: bmike's comment prodded me into actually, y'know, reading the manual, which led me to find that the whitelists are in fact substring matches. Therefore these settings work:\n\nI had to find the /v/ URL by looking at the source of a page with a YouTube embedding.\n\nA: These days, you need to remove killers/YouTube.js from \"conversion scripts\" in the General preferences pane. This seems to apply to both ClickToFlash and ClickToPlugin. Note that after making the change, you have to restart Safari, then wait a second for plugins to load, then open a YouTube tab to test.\nI believe Kevin's answer was correct in 2012, but the FAQ now says, \"Starting from Safari 8, YouTube is completely Flash-free.\" I found whitelisting both youtube.com and googlevideo.com had no effect.\n", "Q: Are there any ways to improve the font rendering in X11.app / XQuartz? I use WingIDE for Python development and it runs under X Windows. The X11 font rendering is driving me crazy. Are there any tricks for getting better fonts in an X Server on MacOS / Lion? Sample image here. It's not so bad that I'd say it's broken, but the hinting, subpixel rendering, etc all just doesn't look nearly as nice in the X server as it does in MacOS native. \nI've installed XQuartz 2.7.0 binaries by hand and didn't notice any improvement in font rendering. I also tried copying Menlo.ttc into my ~/.fonts directory to have a nicer font than the X windows fonts but it's clear the X font renderer just can't match MacOS native. This 2005 OpenOffice tips article recommends replacing libfreetype but it's a pretty awkward process I haven't tried given the age of the instructions.\n\nA: Warning: this is not my final answer, it will take some time to provide a better one.\nTested on OS X 10.8.5 with XQuartz 2.7.4 (xorg-server 1.13.0) and:\n\n\n*\n\n*meld - installed via brew install meld\n\n*xterm\n\n*xclock\n\n\nTo tune the fonts create a file ~/.Xresources and put this:\nXft.dpi:        96\nXft.antialias:  true\nXft.hinting:    true\nXft.autohint:   true\nXft.rgba:       rgb\nXft.hintstyle:  hintfull\n\nXTerm*faceName: DejaVu Sans Mono\n*faceName: DejaVu Sans Mono\n\nInside ~/.gtkrc-2.0:\nstyle \"user-font\" {\n    font_name = \"Lucida Grande 10\"\n}\nwidget_class \"*\" style \"user-font\"\n\ngtk-font-name=\"Lucida Grande 10\"\ngtk-enable-mnemonics = 0\n\nFeel free to post your modifications, as long they are using standard Fonts available on OS X, I would like to make this drop-in recipe. \nThe last file has an effect on meld and other gtk apps.\nNote, the font is the same as the one used in OS X UI but the rendering is still a little bit different.\n\nA: It has been a long time since I've dealt with X11, so all I can contribute are general principals.  But since no one else is posting...\nFrom the Mac OS perspective, everything X11 does is just bitmaps.  Mac OS never sees the fonts that X is displaying.\nSo what you really want is to improve the font rendering within X11 itself.  This FAQ may help.  You might do better in a more general unix forum.\n\nA: Just ctrl+two-finger-click (mac book air) and you'll get a pop up menu that lets you change the font size.\n\nA: The way I could improve it a little bit is by doing Ctrl & right-clicking anywhere on the XQuartz window and then selecting TrueType Fonts and a bigger size. It's still not perfect but I find it much more readable.\n\nA: I encountered a similar situation, where I was forwarding X11 from an Ubuntu system to a Mac.\nThanks to sorin's answer, I was able to improve the font rendering a little. On my Ubuntu system, I ran:\nxrdb -query -all\n\nThis resulted in the following output:\n*customization: -color\nXcursor.size:   24\nXcursor.theme:  DMZ-White\nXft.antialias:  1\nXft.dpi:    96\nXft.hinting:    1\nXft.hintstyle:  hintslight\nXft.rgba:   rgb\n\nI then took that output and created a ~/.Xresources file on the Mac, using as its contents the above output of xrdb -query -all. Then, on the Mac, I ran:\nxrdb ~/.Xresources\n\n... which I understood should cause the settings to take effect in the current X server. Subsequently, the font rendering seemed better, though it still isn't perfect.\nIf it matters, I also installed the Ubuntu fonts on the Mac.\n", "Q: Cannot access CUPS utilities after upgrade to Lion Since upgrading to Lion, I cannot access any of the local functions in the CUPS web-based interface. The response I get is \"Internal Server Error\".\nFor example:\nhttp://localhost:631/admin or http://localhost:631/jobs/\nThe printers are all working fine, but I can't access job queues, etc.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Enter the following at a Terminal command prompt:\ncupsctl WebInterface=Yes\n\nYou will be able to access the CUPS web interface thereafter.\n\nA: I have this problem too on all Lion machines. Somehow Apple did not set up the cups system correctly. In /var/log/system.log you will find error messages like \"xpchelper[6719]: Could not get real path of user account (uid: 26) home directory: /var/spool/cups; error: The operation couldn’t be completed. Permission denied. Using home directory.\" uid 26 is user _lp.\nIt helps to become root (\"sudo bash\") and kill the running cupsd (\"killall cupsd\") and restart it (\"cupsd\"). Afterwards cups admin works in the browser.\nI know that this is a temporary fix only which will be gone with the next reboot.\nIf you want to do this without using Terminal, you can open AppleScript Editor, and create an AppleSript with the following content:\n do shell script \"/usr/bin/killall cupsd; /usr/sbin/cupsd\" with administrator privileges\n\nSave the AppleScript as an Application. When you double-click the application, it will prompt you for your password (using a standard MacOS X dialog box), then restart the print daemon. If you find yourself having to do this often, having an icon to double-click to do it can make the job easier and less intimidating (and no Terminal needed!).\n", "Q: 1920 x 1200 resolution monitor with VGA not detected by Mac OS X 10.7.2 I recently got a Dell 2412m monitor with a screen resolution of 1920 x 1200.  But in system preferences it only shows 1920 x 1080.  I had it connected, beautifully, to my spare linux machine, so that's not the issue.\nHow can I get the correct resolution on my display?\nSpecs:\nDell 2412m\nMac OS X 10.7.2\nConnecting with MiniDisplay Port to VGA\n\nA: You are unlikely to be able use the VGA input to go above 1080p\nBut just to make sure follow this answer how to view more Resolutions to try with.\nMacBook Pro with Retina display (Late 2012) not outputting anything above 1080p\nSelect the monitor in System Preferences:\nSystem Preferences -> Displays -> Monitor(not Built-in Display) -> Display Tab -> Resolution \nChange from 'Best for Display' to 'Scaled' whilst holding the 'alt' key, more resolutions will be listed for you to select, \nAs noted in the comments, you have to start in the default mode 'Best for Display', and move into 'Scaled' whilst holding the alt/option ⎇ key, not the other way round\n\nA: For whoever still has the same problem, just unplug and plug again the minidisplay adaptor into your Mac. \nI had the same problem with a smaller Dell and that does the job.\nP\n\nA: OK, I know you guys down voted paolap, however, for whatever reason, that worked for me.  When I connect by 1440 x 900 monitor to my macbook pro, it tends to default to a 800 x 600 resolution, and I am not able to change it (or at least change it to what I wanted, even with the use of the alt key).  It seems that somehow the order and timing of how things are plugged in and turned on can \"magically\" cause it to occasionally (1/5 times) default to the correct resolution.  My theory is that somewhere, the monitor tries to tell the computer the correct resolution, but if the computer already decides to send a 800 x 600 signal, the monitor just decides to go with it.  So somehow unplugging and replugging can sometimes make the computer realize what the correct resolution should be.\nEdit: I eventually switched to using DVI for the monitor and haven't had a problem since.\n\nA: Reconnecting sometimes REALLY solves this problem. You should try it.\n\nCheck if the right color profile set for the monitor. You can see it on the title of display preference window. If it is not the monitor's model but something different like 'Display',\n\n*\n\n*Try an another USB port to connect the monitor. Sometimes simply doing this solves the issue\n\n*Delete the wrong profile in /Library/ColorSync/Profiles/Displays and try to connect again.\n\n\nI'd been using DELL U2412M with a screen resolution of 1980x1200 via VGA cable with my Macbook Pro(USB-C) + USB-C>VGA adapter for many years without an issue.\nBut recently I encountered this issue several times. My mac changed the resolution into 1980x1080 when it woke up/I reconnected the monitor.\n\n*\n\n*I tried unplug and plug -> didn't work.\n\n*and tried to set resolution to 1920x1200 but I couldn't find it on the\nlist(which MichaelStoner mentioned) even on the expanded one. There\nwere many, only up to 1920x1080 though.\n\nIt seemed that the profile set in the mac somehow got changed. The title of display preference window on it was 'Display' not 'DELL U2412M'. I needed to reset it to solve this.\n\nA: Change the different VGA cable, I know this sounds silly but it worked for me\n\nA: If you go to display settings -> Display. And hold 'option'-key before clicking scaled, you will get all the resolutions that are otherwise hidden. \n", "Q: What is the fastest, smallest, easiest way to use bitTorrent on an iPad 2? Safari won't let me download utorrent, which I use and love on my MacBook pro. Any similar programs that work on an iPad without jail breaking the device?\n\nA: If you have a Mac, the simplest solution might be to install Transmission on your Mac, use its web interface (which looks great on iOS), and let the torrents download on your Mac.\nFrom iOS, you can control almost everything, and add torrents by pasting in URLs, since Mobile Safari doesn't let you do file uploads. It's not exactly what you asked for, but if you don't absolutely need the download to be happening on your iPad, this is much simpler.\nIf you really need the files to end up on your iPad though, you could try something like this.\n\nA: I don't think there is an iPad app where you can download torrent as there is no way to store and open the file, plus, not that Apple's going to let a bittorrent app on the iPad anyways.\n", "Q: Can I move \"Pages\" of apps in iOS 5? I have an iOS 5 iPad 2 and my homescreen is a bit confused. My apps are stored in pages of like content but the pages aren't logically ordered. Is there a way I can move a whole page of apps/reorder them (not just one app at a time)?\n\nA: You can move it by pages in the iTunes interface but (so far as I know) not on the iPad itself.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect to your computer\n\n*open iTunes\n\n*select the iPad in the left column\n\n*select the apps tab along the top\n\n\nAt this point at the upper right is a view of the apps on the iPad.  You can drag and drop apps to move them around.  You can grab a page and drag it up and down the list to rearrange the pages.\n\nA: Yes you can. \nJust simply hold the icon first with your finger so that they all start to jiggle. \nAfter that, simply take one of the app icons under your finger and move it towards either end in your screen.  Just keep it going for either direction for about 2 seconds. \nAfter that it will move to another page.\nHope the answer helped :)\nEDIT and now I noticed I didn't read the original question with enough accuracy.\n", "Q: What happens when I close the lid on my MacBook Pro running OS X? I'm a new Mac user. What happens when I close the lid on my MacBook Pro running OS X Lion?\nIs it sleeping? Or hibernating? Something else?\n\nA: By default, it does both sleep and hibernate -- that is to say, it powers down what it can but keeps the RAM powered so that it can resume immediately, but it also dumps the current state of the RAM to disk so that it can resume from disk if it runs out of power.\n\nA: Short Answer\nMacOSX uses Hybrid Sleep. When closing the lid, the desktop state is written to both RAM and disk.\nThen, while the computer still has enough power for the RAM, it wakes from RAM (sleep). However, in case the power gets cut, the computer wakes from the disk (safe sleep).\nKeep in mind, that the battery isn't actually at it's lowest charge when switching to safe sleep. It still keeps some charge left. Therefore, if you want to fully drain your battery, the computer must stay in safe sleep for several hours until the white led stops 'breathing'.\nLong Answer\nHere is an excerpt of the official Apple Documentation:\nOn all Macs:\n\n*\n\n*The microprocessor goes into a low-power mode\n\n*Video output is turned off, and a connected display may turn off as well, or enter its own idle state\n\n*Apple-supplied hard disks spin down; third-party hard disks may spin down\n\nOn portable Macs:\n\n*\n\n*The Ethernet port turns off, if applicable\n\n\n*Expansion card slots turn off\n\n\n*The built-in modem, if present, turns off\n\n\n*An AirPort card, if present, turns off\n\n\n*The USB connection only responds to the power key on an external keyboard\n\n\n*The optical media drive spins down\n\n\n*Audio input and output turns off\n\n\n*Keyboard illumination, if a feature of your portable computer, turns off\n\nA: Basically, closing your Mac is what you want to do when \"turning it off\" in any situation. It goes to sleep (using very little power, just keeping your RAM active) and this allows it to turn back on again within only a second or so.\nAdditionally, whilst in this state, it makes a copy of the RAM on your hard drive in case its battery goes flat whilst it's sleeping. In this case, it will take quite a bit longer to turn back on, but this will happen only very rarely.\nBottom line is, if you close the lid, it'll remember everything of what you were doing, it'll lock your Mac and in almost all cases, it'll turn back on incredibly fast.\nAlso worth noting that Macs don't really get \"overloaded\" like Windows does. You can keep a Mac running (as in, no proper reboots) for good month or so without it \"clogging up\" and getting slow. Usually, the only reason you'd want to reboot is after an update or something similar.\n\nA: You don't do any harm to close the lid. In fact I never shut down my Mac, I always close the lid. It's fast, it's secure, just like Mike just told you.\n", "Q: How can I change my sender name in iCloud email? I want to correct how my 'sender' name appears when I write mail with my iCloud account. \nFor some reason, iCloud shows my first name in all caps & I can't edit it.\n\nA: iCloud is linked directly to your Apple account. You should be able to edit the details on your Apple ID here: https://appleid.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyAppleId.woa/\n\nA: I had the same problem and changed my Apple ID to show regular text, not all caps, using the link provided in the first answer.

I deleted my email alias from his contact information and made sure my contact information had my name and my email alias - problem solved!\n\nA: There is many kind of methods to do this but none of them can do in one shot for all, means change in one place (ipad, iphone, mac pc) and them forget the other, it depends from where you would send your mails you have change in that place the id information, here is the tree methods whatever device you have.\nFROM IPAD - IPHONE - IPOD TOUCH\n\n\n*\n\n*OPEN SETTING (GEAR ICON)\n\n*GO TO MAIL, CONTACTS, CALENDARS\n\n*OPEN ICLOUD MAIL ACCOUNT\n\n*HIT ON \"ACCOUNT\"\n\n*INSIDE OF ACCOUNT WINDOW HIT ON \"MAIL\" OPTION\n\n*CHANGE THE \"NAME\" AS YOU DESIRE, THEN \"DONE\" (3 TIMES UNTIL EVERYTHING CLOSE)\n\n\nFROM ICLOUD EMAIL (PC OR MAC)\n\n\n*\n\n*OPEN \"MAIL\" ON ICLOUD (BLUE ENVELOPE ICON) (https://www.icloud.com/#mail)\n\n*HIT ON \"GEAR ICON\" (TOP RIGHT CORNER)\n\n*SELECT \"PREFERENCE\"\n\n*SELECT \"ACCOUNT\"\n\n*CHANGE \"FULL NAME\" AS YOU DESIRE, THEN DONE\n\n\nFROM GMAIL ACCOUNT (YOUR ICLOUD ATTACHED TO GMAIL)\n\n\n*\n\n*OPEN YOUR GMAIL ACCOUNT\n\n*HIT \"SETTING\" (GEAR ICON AT THE TOP RIGHT CORNER)\n\n*SELECT \"SETTING\"\n\n*CHOOSE \"ACCOUNTS AND IMPORTS\"\n\n*POINTING ON YOUR ICLOUD ACCOUNT HIT \"EDIT INFO\" (AT THE MIDDLE RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR SCREEN)\n\n*ON \"EDIT EMAIL ADDRESS\" SMALL WINDOW CHANGE THE \"NAME\" AS YOU DESIRE \n\n*HIT ON \"NEXT STEP\"\n\n*FINALLY HIT \" SAVE CHANGES\"\n\n\nALL DONE\nHOPES THIS ONES HELP\n\nA: There is no way to change the prefix for @icloud.com   for example if you made  thedude@icloud.com you can't change the part \"the dude\" you can only make an alias.\n", "Q: How can I improve response from the iPhone 4 multi-touch display? When I touch the surface of my iPhone 4, it doesn't always register.\nHow does the display work? Heat? Charge? What can I do to make the phone register my touch better?\n\nA: The iPhone has a Capacitive touchscreen so you need to touch with some conductive material. \nSo the skin on you finger will for example work better than the nail and most gloves, pens etc will not work at all.\n", "Q: Has someone set up an HP DeskJet 812C with SnowLeopard or Lion? My parents have an old printer: an HP DeskJet 812C. I upgraded the OS on their iMac to SnowLeopard before checking if the printer was compatible. Unfortunately, it isn't. There's a Gutenprint driver for this printer, but the documentation looked rather involved. I didn't have much time to dedicate to the task.\nCan someone simplify the gutenprint setup process for me?

In this case you have the option to forward iCloud emails to your other email address (the one you used to setup iCloud perhaps) and route this into Windows Mail.\nYou should also check that all the fields are correct. Use the iCloud Mail server information for this.  \n\nA: I was hesitant to accept this was not possible, but it's just not supported and doesn't work.\n\nI too had the same issues on my PC using W7 + WLM2011: not able to send iCloud mail from WLM2011.

The colour doesn't change on the type they use. However if you use iMessage then the message back will be iMessage unless it stats above it that it is a message, as both users need to have iMessage enabled at the same time to use the feature, otherwise an SMS message is sent.\nIf you scroll up in the message history you will see what the last type of message used was.

It has all the latest updates (except for an item each for iTunes and Safari). Having not used Mail for a week or so, I've run into some problems with it - plus similar problems with Colloquy and LimeChat (both IRC clients). For all three, the problem is that the screen is not being redrawn; it appears to be acting transparently, and so screen furniture (scrollbars etc) are leaving a trail where the application content should be.\n\nI've tried an array of things to fix it - obviously tried rebooting, and also shutting down fully before turning back on.\nAlso, I've deleted ~/Library/Preferences/info.colloquy.plist, with no change in Colloquy's behaviour. To be honest I'd not expect it to be an individual application issue, since it is affecting these three applications.\nI've tried a few graphics things too. I've turned off the energy saving graphics mode in the Energy Preferences pane (although it has worked since new with that feature enabled). I was also running gfxCardStatus, now removed from the boot sequence and not running.\nI've tried removing most things from opening at login, again to no avail. I've tried a new user account, and the same problems are exhibited in LimeChat. Not yet tried Mail in the second account - will do so - but am not hopeful.\nAs a long shot, my colleague suggests that I try verifying my primary (only) disk, and this turns out to be fine (verifying permissions as I type all disk permissions have been fixed, no change).\nThe last thing I installed was a modem driver, but it's been working fine with this, so I don't think it was that that has upset the system. Not sure I've done anything differently that might have caused this, tbh. So... I am now a bit stuck. Any ideas?\nEdit: just tried Adium as well, another chat client. Same redraw problems again!\n\nA: Fixed it!\nI installed the pending update for Safari, which I thought was quite irrelevant, and that has sorted it out. Initially I thought that this did some system 'tidying up', which kicked a graphics module back into shape. But a colleague points out that Mail may well use WebKit's rendering engine, and it is possible that all of the IRC clients I tried also do.\nThe problem is still most strange, as the update for Safari has been pending for a great deal longer than the problem, which must have cropped up around ten days ago or less. So it was working without that update, and furthermore I've not idea what I did to trigger the fault.\nStill, sorted now. Hopefully this post will be useful for anyone who encounters a similar problem.\nLightbulb moment: I seem to remember that I used the Software Update feature to download but not install the Safari update (5.1.2) between Mail working and breaking. Since the update required a restart to install, I left it and forgot about it. My guess is that, although it appeared to just download the Safari update, in fact it modified (and broke) the current configuration.

I have a new MacBook Air that is connected to a Time Capsule for both internet and storage.  I have a fresh installation of iTunes (up to date) and am going to preferences / advanced and telling it to find media in a folder on the Time Capsule.  I have both keep itunes media folder organized and copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to the library unchecked (don't think this matters, but just in case it does).

I've restarted both iTunes and the Mac with no change.  \n\nA: Did you add your media to iTunes?\nmenubar -> file -> add to library\nThen restart iTunes.\n", "Q: iTunes Match - No More Backups Needed? I subscribed to iTunes Match the other day (it just came to the UK) and was thinking - now that iTunes Match is backing up my library, ratings, playcounts and all that awesome stuff, I no longer need to include it in my time machine backup, right? It's matched 99% of the songs in my library and I'm not going to miss the others a great deal - I use Spotify very heavily as well, and if I don't need to backup my music (~100gb) I no longer need a larger backup hard drive :D\n\nA: No, you don't need a backup any more. iTunes Match stores nothing in the Cloud, it activates your songs in the iTunes Store, and only the songs iTunes doesn't have are uploaded to the Apple Server.\nBut if your HDD suffers damage, you have to download all your 50 GB again. \n\nA: At this point in history, it seems unlikely that Apple is going anywhere, what with their gigantic cash reserve, profits, market capitalization, etc. That said, many apparently successful companies have collapsed and closed quickly, and the data they hosted sometimes disappeared. Less dramatically, individual accounts can get deleted, passwords lost, or access revoked for one reason or another.\nIn a nutshell, iTunes Match should serve as a backup. How much peace of mind would it gain you to have your own backup of your music in the unlikely but not impossible event that it fails you?\n\nA: I have a rule which I apply to backups: Use more than one approach. I have an iPod Classic with an 80 GB HD, this is used as an external HD to store my entire iTunes Media folder and is backed up weekly using Carbon Copy Cloner.\nI back up everything on my Leopard & Lion Macs with Time Machine and alternate between two different external HDs, on of which is kept off-site at a location I visit each at least twice per week. This HD is only at home for 36 hours at the most.\nI also use two Carbon Copy Cloner external HDs so I have a bootable clone should  it be necessary.\nI have copies of my Web Receipts folders stored on Dropbox so I can refer to receipts from one Mac while using another. \n\nA: Yes, but only as long as you NEVER expect to unsubscribe from iTunes Match, or to transfer to another ecosystem. Personally I would keep a backup.\n", "Q: Buying an app on one device; rating from another Is there some restriction on which device you can rate from?  I like to browse the iOS app store via iTunes from my MacBook, so I often stage apps there for download on the next sync with my iPhone. I just tried to rate a so-installed app from my iPhone and (after typing in and submitting  a review) it said that I need to own the app before I can review it. Is there some sort of synchronization that I have set inappropriately?\n\nA: If you buy the same app using the same iTunes account from different iOS devices, you can rate the app from any of the devices. Synchronization is done between the device you rated the app and Apple's iTunes App Store. \n", "Q: Mail, Contacts & Calendars crashes System Preferences; iCal and Mail also affected When I open System Preferences and click the Mail, Contacts and Calendars icon, System Preferences crashes.

Initially tried installing via an external DVD drive connected over USB, but that wouldn't let me boot into Windows 7 setup. Tried setting up a Windows 7 USB stick, and that wouldn't boot either.\nI then tried following along here with the basic procedure of tricking VirtualBox into installing Windows 7 to your drive and going from there, but that created a non-bootable Windows partition. \nThere must be some way to get Windows 7 up and running WITHOUT having to reinstall the SuperDrive. Anyone have any success doing this?\nBTW, I'm running 10.7.2, which means rEFIt is out, as it isn't Lion compatible. \n\nA: Only way I was able to was by reinstalling the super drive I spent more time looking for a work around then the time it took to move the ssd to the hard drive location and reinstalling the super drive.\nSorry.\n\nA: So, I just broke down and installed rEFIt. It actually worked - I could boot off of the Windows USB key and install. After installation, I immediately removed rEFIt, and everything seems to be working correctly after that.

When traveling, I probably will have the iPad 2, iPhone 4S, a USB backup charger, and some misc devices such as a Kindle Fire and a Sony digital camera that uses USB to charge its battery.\nSo instead of hooking them all up to the computer to charge them overnight, in the event that I actually need to charge every one of them that night, is it possible to use Apple's 10W USB charger that Apple makes (it is 100V to 240V compatible): \n\nand then hook it up to any USB hub, such as this Belkin 7-port one:\n\nand be able to charge all the devices listed above at the same time?  (by the way, it seems that the smaller Apple USB charger with the green dot is 5W, so probably that one is not very powerful to charge all devices at the same time).\n\nA: You typically will need one high-powered (5W) USB port for each of such devices to charge efficiently. The iPad alone requires more to charge, hence the non-standard 10W adapter. In addition, the USB hub itself is not likely to provide the necessary wattage to any of the ports (these usually are low-powered ports), so chances are not even one device will efficiently charge when connected alone to such a hub.\n\nA: Apple use some tricky schemes to identify battery chargers and compatible devices. The sense resistor is common and it is what is responsible for the message \n \nwith some combinations of devices. \nSee the fun they had working out the right sense resistors when designing the MintyBoost. (and do check out ladyada.net if you like this sort of thing, there are some very clever hacks)\nI don't think your iPad will charge at all with the hub. I have a Belkin Dual USB Charger and when connected the iPad just says \n\nbecause it detects that it is not plugged into a high power USB port. Apple provide some explanation about high power in this technical note - basically the port starts out supplying the usual 500mA maximum and will supply extra power if capable.\nThe USB hub is almost certainly not a high power port, even if it is a powered hub. And it won't have the correct sense resistors to tell the iPhone/iPad that it is a device capable of charging it. So even if it could distribute power from the 10W adapter the devices could not recognise that they were connected to a 10W adapter.\nIf you only carry one charger then it should be the 10W adapter but you really need to connect the iPad directly to it. While the iPad can charge from the 5W adapter it will take much longer and you would probably not get a full charge on your device. \nI think your ideal combination of charging devices is one Apple 10W adapter and one Apple 5W adapter, or two 10W adapters (I don't see the point of buying the 5W adapters since they are the same price and the 10W can do everything the 5W can do, it's just a tiny bit larger.)\nThen you should be able to charge 5 or 6 devices a night with no problems.\n\nA: No, in fact most devices won't charge at all unless the hub is connected to a USB host.\nWhen a USB device is plugged in it first determines if it's plugging into a USB host or hub, or if it's plugging into a charging device.  This is signaled by the state of the data lines on the USB port.\nIf it's plugged into a charging device, it simply starts charging.  Again, the state of the data lines tells it enough about the charger so it knows how much current it can pull - this is how an iPad knows it's plugged into an iPhone/iPod charger and charges more slowly.  The data line state is a key that says, \"This charger only supports 1A.\"\nIf it's plugged into a USB host or hub, then it has to talk to the host device (usually a computer, or a computer through the hub) and request power.  The hub or computer might only be able to supply 100mA, or 500mA, or on newer USB ports 1A or 2A.  The key point, however, is that the device has to talk to the computer and get permission to use that power.\nThe hub cannot give permission, it simply passes the request along to the computer.  \nSo if you don't plug the hub into a computer then nothing attached to the hub will be able to receive permission. The hub doesn't match the state of the data lines of a charger you might plug it into, so nothing attached to a hub that's attached to a charger will ever get permission to charge, or will ever think that the hub is a charger.\nThere are devices which disobey the USB specification and attempt to charge anyway, and they might be able to charge under such an arrangement.\nApple devices, however, will never charge unless attached to a charger that follows Apple's charging spec, or a computer with sufficient current output.\nThere are a number of multiport chargers available now, though.  Google for \"usb 4 port charger\" and you'll find many inexpensive options that will work with Apple devices, and be more compact than a charger and USB hub anyway.\n\nA: Wouldn't using the cable in the following link (http://www.canadacomputers.com/product_info.php?cPath=95_97&item_id=040817) plugged into a normal 5W powered hub do the trick?\n\nA: A simple and fairly obvious solution is to us a power strip with a charger for each device. Each device comes with its own charger so a power strip is the only additional expense.\n", "Q: 2011 Mac Mini boot camp problems I Have a 2011 Mac mini and I installed Windows 7 using Bootcamp. All the drivers are working fine, except the sound and the bluetooth. Since my internet connection is really lousy, I don't want to download a 100Mb drivers solution, I just need the Audio Controller, which I've been led to believe that it a Cirrus Logic CS4206B, but I haven't been able to find a single place to download the driver.\nCan anyone point out any advice on how I can solve this? By providing a link to download the driver, or perhaps a way to extract it from somewhere, because bootcamp requires me to connect to internet to download the whole driver pack and I just can't do that.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\nUPDATE: Just for the sake of information, my Mac is a mid 2011 Mac Mini, having a 2.3Ghz Core i5 and an 8Gb RAM kit installed by me.\nUPDATE After a while, I managed to install the Cirrus Logic driver, so I-m marking the answer as correct, however, I get audio only in the internal speaker, no audio on the Jack. I'll try to reinstall using Bootcamp 3.2 and see what happens.\nUPDATE It's been a while since I posted this question, but I'll say my current solution. After many different ideas and trying with almost every variation of the Cirrus driver, I was able to use the download Windows support drivers and everything worked like a charm, so in the end, it was the only option to get a proper bootcamp installation.\n\nA: Step 1: Download the most recent Cirrus Logic drivers from the Cirrus Logic page. The CS4207 driver is actually more appropriately named \"CS42**\" driver. \n--> go to this page: Here\n--> click the \"Resources\" tab\n--> in the \"Resources\" tab, under the \"Tools & Software\" heading, select the appropriate driver ZIP file for your particular configuration. Since I am operating in Windows 7 64 bit, I chose the \"CS4207 Windows Vista (32/64-bit) and Windows 7 (32/64-bit) Driver, 8/2010, v6.6001.1.26 : 100 KB\"\n--> download the file to your desktop\n--> create a folder on your desktop called CS4207 Drivers (the name doesn't actually matter)\n--> move the downloaded ZIP file to this new folder\n--> expand the ZIP file within this new folder\nStep 2. Go to Control Panel, Device Manager.\nStep 3. In Device Manager, open up the \"Sound, vide and game controllers\" sub menu.\nStep 4. If you're like me, you had 4 NVIDIA High Definition Audio entries, and one Cirrus or Intel entry. Click on the Cirrus or Intel entry for the Sound controller. Uninstall the driver and, if it gives you the option to delete the driver files used, do so.\nStep 5: Go back to Device Manager, and select \"Scan for hardware changes\" from the right click dropdown menu.\nStep 6. Let your system automatically install whatever driver it wants.\nStep 7. Select that new driver entry in Device Manager; right click the entry to update the driver; choose the Browse option, then the Let Me Pick option; and then select the new folder on your desktop as the driver location.\n", "Q: invalid ISO file created by disk util? In order to install Windows XP on Virtual Box at my new MacBook Air, I need to create an ISO file of my WinXP install CD. My Laptop (MacBook Pro / Lion) comes with the Mac Disk Util and that app can create ISO files from CD media. The problem was, after creating such a ISO file with that DiskUtil (using New image... -> CD/DVD-Master -> renaming to *.iso) that file wasn't readable by Virtual Box ;-( I've tried 3 various options but without any success.\nAfter that, I tried it with command line only\ndd if=/dev/disk1 of=WinXP.iso\n\nBut this file wasn't readable by VirtualBox too ;-( Also my muCommander, which can 'read' plain ISO files by step into like for directories, showing empty content. So something must be wrong with that ISO file. Finally, I come to a real weird solution: I've already has installed WinXP on Virtual Box at my MacBook Pro. I've installed ISOWorkshop, a freeware for creating ISO files from disc media. With that tool, I create the ISO file of the WinXP install CD (under WinXP on Virtual Box at MBP), copied that file to the MacBook Air, and use that ISO file for creating the WinXP VM under Virtual Box.... Oh my god ;-)\nBut the performance of the MBA is incredible: The whole installation was estimated with the famous '37 minutes' which was a  good approximation in the past for my machines. Today it was finished after 6 minutes !!!\nDoes anybody know, why the ISO files created by the Mac Lion Disc Utility are not 100% compatible with standard, or at least unusable for Virtual Box ?\nKind regards\nDominik\n\nA: It sounds as if you created an empty disk image. To create an ISO/disk image of your disk you have to select the volume (selecting the drive may work too) in the left pane of \"Disk Utility\" and then click the icon \"New Image\" or «File» → «New» → «Disk Image from \"XYZ your volume name\"»  \n\nFor CD/DVD-ISOs make sure to select \"DVD/CD master\" as Image Format in the upcoming dialogue and no encryption.\n\nNow your CD or DVD will be saved as an ISO-image with the extension .cdr - you can rename it to .iso if needed.\n", "Q: How to make a custom keyboard layout be recognized as Latin so I can remove the US default layout?

This thread in the Apple Discussions Forums implies that, at least for basic apps that do not have complex connections with the system, it is possible to restore via Time Machine. \nIf I am not mistaken, Time Machine works the same way in all folders (including Library and Applications) as long as they are not listed as an exception in System Preferences. What this means is that if you open a new Finder window showing the user's Library folder and then call Time Machine, that should bring back the preferences subfolder for your app when you \"go back in time\" to when you had it installed. Naturally, you would have to know in advance the name and location of the app's preferences folder within your user's Library folder. \nAfter that is done, then opening Time Machine in a Finder window showing the Applications folder should bring back your app if you \"go back in time\" to when you had it installed. It's a two step process, but I don't see why it would not work at least for simple apps. \n", "Q: When does Skitch use a transparent background? I am using Skitch Plus to take screenshots of applications running on my Mac, and I have noticed it has an option to set the background.\n\nWhat I still have to understand is when that option is used.

I also unplugged everything from the Mac (monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc.) but it still kernel panics.\nHere are a couple logs with peripherals attached and without.\nHow can I prevent this shut down kernel panic?\n\nA: Both panic logs indicate the panic happened in the org.openafs.filesystems.afs extension, so that's the logical suspect.  The OpenAFS page for Mac OS X seems to indicate that version 1.6.0 is current, and lists separate installs for different versions of OS X. Your panic logs indicate you have 1.6.0fc7, which is presumably a final candidate, not the actual release.  I'd disable the extension first, then try installing the current Lion version.\n\nA: According to your Logs you have VMWare Fusion 3.1.3 installed - there are some people having Troubles with that Version (and Lion), even though it occurs while updating (see here) to that version.

I just started syncing my iPad to my desktop iTunes and it's taking a very long time to \"transfer purchases\" from the iPad. I was under the impression that iTunes remembered all my app downloads and purchases via iCloud (and verified I could see them in iTunes) so I don't understand why iTunes would need to transfer anything off my physical device.\nWhat exactly is it doing and why is it necessary?\n\nA: This process assumes that iCloud is not enabled.\nIt is possible to update apps on the device without doing so in iTunes. For this to work you will need to have enabled automatic downloads.\nIf you sync your iPad with iTunes without transfering purchases you coukld end up with older apps and losing the updates.\nWith iCloud there is no need for you to sync with iTunes, so if a device is plugged in iTunes would assume that you do not use iCloud and will transfer all the updated apps to the computer.\nAll in all it is more of a safety precaution if you are already using iCloud.\n", "Q: Is there a way to undo the \"Show all available episodes\" option for a podcast in iTunes? To easily download the latest episode, I selected the \"Show all available episodes\" option for a podcast to which I haven't subscribed. The podcast listing now looks like this:\n\nIs there a way to undo this selection, so that all un-downloaded episodes of the podcast are once again suppressed?\nNote: I'm seeking a way to switch off display of a podcast's un-downloaded episodes all at once, as an alternative to manually deleting them from the list.\n\nA: There isn't a simple \"undo\" that will achieve this, so it looks like you will be looking for the least hassle workaround to acheive the same result. There are always ways of fudging it, some are more hassle than they are worth, others work pretty well and are quick but have drawbacks:\nYou are aware of the ability to manually delete, but this is a multiple step process that could take a long time for established podcasts with many episodes.\nYou could delete the podcast, and then redownload the ones you are interested in, which will also revert the extra episodes visibility, but this will take extra time to redownload, and you might have to make a list of the ones you want etc.\nSo, still a workaround but the one that produces the results with the minimum of steps:  Delete the podcast from your lists, it will ask you if you want to remove the files, or keep them in your itunes media folder.  Select keep, then go to (Windows example, this may be different on your Mac)  File > Add Folder to Library > Navigate to your iTunes/Media/Podcasts folder, and select it.  This will rescan the contents of the podcasts folder, and re-add anything into your library that exists as a file, but is not already in your library (Don't worry, you won't get duplicates) - this will restore your podcast including all your downloaded episodes, and remove the list of other available ones.\nOn the assumption that you have the option for iTunes to organise your folders for you, the podcast should already have it's own folder structure inside the general podcasts directory, thus ensuring you only scan the folders you need to increase speed etc.\nNote that any ratings, and watched flags etc will be reset by this method.\nAlternatively you could always try to ignore the list, and create a smart playlist where Album = Podcast name, and Plays = 0 to show downloaded and unplayed episodes (or any other criteria, the smart folder will not search through the undownload extra episodes that are visible and so the results will be filtered from your downloaded episodes only).\n\nA: There is no official undo for this issue. Here is a possible alternative:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on the podcast title in the subscriptions list.\n\n*In the lower-left corner of iTunes, click \"Subscribe\", followed immediately by \"Unsubscribe\". This will clear out all podcast episodes from the list that haven't been downloaded to your computer.\n\n\n\nIt would also be helpful to change the settings for that specific podcast to \"Manually\" check for new episodes and \"Do nothing\" when new episodes are available. Again, select the podcast title from the subscriptions list, click \"Settings\" in the lower-left corner of iTunes, and uncheck \"Use Default Settings\".\n\nSelecting \"Do nothing\" will prevent iTunes from downloading any new episodes during the \"Subscribe/Unsubscribe\" action. \nIn this situation, selecting \"Manually\" is just an optional safeguard to make sure that iTunes doesn't check for new episodes if you are marked as subscribed to that podcast. But, as long as you are marked as unsubscribed, this option will have no effect.\nNote: Be aware of checking for new episodes by right-clicking on the podcast title from the subscriptions list and selecting \"Update Podcast\". By doing this, iTunes will once again repopulate the list of available episodes and you will have to click \"Subscribe/Unsubscribe\" again to clear out the list. \n\nA: I've had the same issue in the past.

I have some files and folders on a USB drive connected to my iMac...I would like to sync them with a folder on my iMac...how do I do that?\nIs there built-in functionality in Lion that allows me to do that, or do I have to use a 3rd party solution?\n\nA: Another donationware is SyncTwoFolders:\n\nThis program synchronizes two folders. The oldest files will be replaced by the most recent, and in certain cases, some files will be removed.\n  Use the help tags to familiarize yourself with the options.\n  Be sure of what you are doing when you start a synchronization. If in doubt, do a Simulation. This will show you what will happen if you choose to synchronize, but no files will be replaced or removed.\n\n\nA: arRsync is a free OS X GUI to the rsync command line utility. It will get you started on the path to rsync enlightenment. You can save common sync operations to recall them at a later time for easy rsync. And it supports the common rsync use case scenarios: push A to B but leave stuff that's in B but not A in place, push A to B and delete stuff that's in B but not in A, make A and B look the same (with a conflict report).\n\nA: SyncTwoFolders is a free great app that's very useful and handy for Mac users. I use this to sync my GoogleDrive and Dropbox folders. Here is the link to setup SyncTwoFolders.\nActually you can schedule a sync. You have to create as setting of your own for ex. \"mysync' by clicking the '+' sign next to 'Last Settings' drop down and saving it. This 'mysync' will appear in your window to the right when you click the '*' button above the 'Synchronize' button.\nAt the bottom of that sliding schedule window you can set the time interval at which it can sync.\nYou need to keep the application running in the background for it do scheduled syncing.\n\nA: If you are comfortable with the terminal, rsync is a great utility that will sync folders easily.  Take a look at a tutorial here (the tutorial is on an \"Everything Linux\" website, but the rsync utility comes with both Linux and Mac OS X).\nExample commands:\nCopy/merge everything newer from SOURCE into DEST, do not delete anything:\nrsync -va   /path/to/folder/SOURCE/  /path/to/folder/DEST/\n\nCopy everything newer into DEST, and delete any items from DEST that don't exist in SOURCE:\nrsync -va --delete   /path/to/folder/SOURCE/  /path/to/folder/DEST/\n\nBe sure to include the trailing forward-slash / at the end of your folder paths.\nA useful hint here is that you can drag folders into the Terminal window to have it insert the full path to that folder (or file), saving you lots of typing and typos.\n\nA: I have had good luck with Chronosync for synching folders/Macs.\n\nA: Install Xcode from the App Store and use File Merge.\nThen you can open both directories, and compare individual differences and pick which one is \"correct\" (even down to lines of text within a file), merging the results to a new directory or over the top of one of the two you're comparing.\n(it should be available in Spotlight after you've installed Xcode, if not open Xcode and from the Xcode Menu it's under \"Other Developer Tool)\n\nA: For a decent GUI based file synchronizer, check out File Synchronization (website found here)  It is a low cost ($15) utility that has nice control over the sync process.  GUI arrows give you a pretty good feel of what is going to happen, ensuring you use the tool properly and don't end up overwriting the wrong file.  Nice tool.\n\nA: Dropbox is the answer. Simple. Multi-platform. Free.\nGive it a go!\n\nA: Free Dropbox account is great if you need to sync small amount of files with other devices too, but if you have many devices, you should either upgrade Dropbox or get Chronosync. I personally use both of these solutions, so all my Macs are basically in sync. :)\n\nA: I use Beyond Compare for Mac.

My TV sits right there in the corner, it's kinda lazy and perfect. But I haven't figured out how to passively enjoy my iPad. I am now bending my knees up and propping it against my thighs. But I can't fall asleep like this and that's what I want to do when I enjoy a movie in bed. How can I position my iPad so I can effortlessly watch a movie in bed?\n\nA: Lay on your side with the iPad on a bedside table or on the other side of a bed.\nGet an Apple TV and stream the content to the TV.\n\nA: Get a \"boom\" microphone stand from SamAsh, Guitar Center, or any other large music equipment store.  Then get one of the many iPad mic stand holders now available. My fave is TheGigEasy...2nd choice: iClip.  \nPosition it (with iPad attached) as far over the bed as possible while the stand is on the side (or behind the head of) your bed.  Keep in mind that the weight of the iPad will cause the stand to tip if you position the boom too far over.  The only solution to this is weight(s) placed on the foot/pedestal of the stand.  I'm able to get it about 1/3 of the way over the bed...then I adjust for height, and simply read while lying down.  It's great.\n\nA: Get a cat. I find the best way to use my iPad in bed is to put the cat on my lap, pat him and give him attention for a few minutes and then he is perfectly happy to be used as an iPad stand until I'm ready for sleep.\nHe's quite flexible so easily moved around till the iPad is in the right position.\nHighly recommended. Oh, long haired breeds are better - they have all that hair on their bellies that protect the iPad.\n\nA: If you have some kind of iPad stand and one of those bed-trays, you could use the stand to prop up the iPad on that.\nAlternatively, you could just hook it up to a TV/screen using Apple's adapter.\n\nA: Take some fishing line, run it through your case in such a way to provide the right view angle. Use a thumb tack and suspend it from the ceiling. Win. \n\nA: There was a paper carton product in eBay called bookUp. It is from Korea. I bought PVC pipes and created a frame.  It now lasted 3 years and going strong.\nThis is the best hands down.\n\nA: I mainly read but either watching a movie or reading. I find laying on my side with the iPad propped up against another pillow or wall so I can orientate it to match my natural viewing angle and not have to hold is the most comfortable.

This of course means that I'd be staring at the UI of OSX for about 40 hours every week at least which is significant enough to cause strain to my eyes.\nWhat's even worse is that I have weakened vision (essentially a mix of color blindness and snow blindness) which means that the default white/light gray theming of OSX is too bright and not high contrast enough for my eyes. In fact, the default UI is unusable to me.\nI'm aware of the \"poor vision\" mode of OSX, but it's just a color inversion. My vision isn't that highly impaired that I would appreciate the whole operating system to look like ass at the expense of readability. Instead what I'd like to do - as I can do in Windows - is to change the UI colors to relatively neutral medium to dark colors, but so far haven't found a way to do it. As a color scheme this isn't anything new, especially lots of graphics related applications nowadays use these darker tones a lot. For example here's a screenshot Microsoft's Expression Blend 4 which is pretty close to what I'd want the UI to look like.\nSo, how can I change the colors/styles/whatever used by OSX (preferably 10.7 Lion) to either match the linked screenshot or be fully modifiable on the fly?\n\nA: Neither MacOSX nor iOS offer to change the OS theme. If you want to do this, you need to use third party software.\nWhat MacOSX does offer, is changing the color profile and calibrate it in System Preferences -> Displays -> Color -> Calibrate.\nI've played around with different options and found the option \"Cool bluish white\" to be much easier on the eye:\n\n\nA: I myself, also have poor eyesight, not simple weakening of the eyes but something more along the lines of what you described. For me, then, theming applications aren't simply a lark, but essential in order to get anything dome, as I stare at the monitor over 12 hours daily.\nI have in the past designed some highly respected themes (well, highly respected by the people that make these things themselves, anyways - and still available on Michaels' Mac, incidentally, which is the website of the former \"Resexcellence\" founder). very usable moderately dark themes as they were easiest on the eye.\nI found the best, and safest way to do this was via \"Shapeshifter\". Unfortunately, since Snow Leopard OSX 10.6 came out, Shapeshifter (like a whole lot of other applications) no longer works, and in fact that change effectively put the developer completely out of business.\nFor the last 2 years I've been looking all over for something else like it, and only just now have found something.\nIt's called Flavours,and it's so new that it didn't exist when you wrote this question. It works the same , essentially, as Shapeshifter, that is, by hooking into the graphics between the system and the display, meaning it doesn't alter any system files. It is also, the only thing I have EVER seen that can create transparent, or translucent, drop down menus in Snow Leopard and above. It claims to have a built in editor, but I can't figure how to access it, or if it does, it's as pretty poor editor. Nevertheless, it has many of the same themes that existed on shapeshifter, and MANY MANY visibility options. If only I could find out how to create white system fonts with it.\nAgain, this application is called Flavours I'm booted into a different  version of OSX so don't have the link..It's easy to find however via Google, and is Mavericks capable also.\nAs long as you're not going for a dark theme you will definitely find something very visible.\nI know this request is 2 years old but poor vision affects almost everybody as they get older, so there's many others who can benefit, including me! Took me 2 years to find it, so I thought it important to post.\nURL: http://flavours.interacto.net\n\nA: You might also look into using flux as that can be an easy tool to modify the color / contrast of the screen.  I use it to change to softer lighting at night but there is no reason you can't set it to be different all the time.\n\nA: First of all, on a Mac if you go to System Preferences, then to Universal Access there is a colorblind mode that inverts the colors. There's also a shortcut: ctrl+⌥+⌘+8\nIf you need more than that, there's Black Light. You can use it to change the tint of the screen as well.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I know this is a bit late—but in the newest version of OS X, there is now a system-wide Dark Mode!\nYou can enable it in System Preferences > General.\n\n", "Q: Official Unlock after Jailbroken Unlock? I jailbroke and unlocked my 3GS (4.1, baseband 06.15.00) a few months ago to use it in another country. However, my 2-year German contract is up and I could ask my former carrier to ask Apple for the official unlock. Would this work on a jailbroken/unlocked phone? I want to upgrade to IOS 5 without needed to jailbreak to unlock the phone again (I don't use jailbroken apps, really, just used it for the unlock).\n\nA: Return your phone to its standard state, so ios4.1 and then yes, you can ask the carrier to request unlock from Apple. \nThe unlock works by changing a database entry for your UDID on Apple servers and therefore whether or not it's jailbroken should make little difference. With that said, to be sure it's all worked ( and because you are planning to) taking it back to a standard OS install would make sense. \nHope this helps. \n\nA: You'll need to restore the firmware using one of the jailbreak applications. Pwnagetool, redSn0w, etc.\nThe reason is the 6.15 firmware is from the iPad and it's version is higher than what is in the normal 3GS firmware. iTunes will see this phone is different than what it expects and throw an error (1015, I believe).\nAs the unlock developers have stressed, repeatedly, the custom 6.15 firmware is a one way deal. Once you do this you can't go back to the normal firmware anymore. To update in the future you'll have to continue creating custom firmwares, the factory firmware simply won't work anymore.\n", "Q: Remove duplicate smart playlists in iTunes Background: I relocated my music library to a different hard drive on my Mac.  In order to sync iTunes, I exported the playlist, edited all the file paths to the new location, and imported it back into iTunes.  It worked fine, except:\nNow I have duplicate \"most played\", \"most recently played\", \"classics\" etc in the automatic playlists section in the left pane, both in iTunes and on my iPhone.  (My Mac is localized to Swedish, so these playlist names are my own off the cuff translations back to English.)\nI have looked at the XML playlist file I imported and could not find any entries there which would have caused the duplication, so starting over does not seem like a viable approach.\nI have added album art, play times etc to the songs in iTunes so I would rather not start over from an empty music library.  None of this is purchased via iTunes (and frankly I'd rather be without iTunes altogether); I have transferred my CDs to FLAC over the years and just converted them to MP4 for import into iTunes when I first got an iPod Touch a few years ago.\n\nA: Forgive me if I'm mistaken but can't you just right/second click and hit delete?\n\nand then set to sync with your iPod under the music tap of the connected iPod \n", "Q: Is there a way to extend the time you can talk to Siri for? If I start Siri and ask to send a message or email, it will ask who to, takes the name from me etc etc. \nWhen I come to saying the message I can only say a few words before being cut off. I then need to say edit to start again, or tap the message to edit manually.\nHowever if I were to create a message without using Siri, and then tap the microphone button, I can talk to the voice recognition for longer, and manually stop it listening.\nIs there a way to change the length of time Siri leaves after you have finished talking or a way to change its sensitivity to sound?\n\nA: If you say, “Hey Siri, open Notes,” and have a hand free to tap the Compose icon, then tap the Mic button beside the space bar in the Compose keyboard.  Immediately Siri will transcribe indefinitely, until you reach over and tap Done.  Unless the screen were to shut off, this is a 3-touch solution.\nBy means of the Shortcuts app that Apple has released more recently than the other answers on this question, you can make a simple chain from “Dictate Text” into “Create Note”, but you still only have the options to stop it with a pause, a short pause, or a tap, not with a codeword, so for your purposes it’s still a 1-touch solution, not safely handsfree.\nEdit:  iOS 13 broke this so badly it often stops recording after less than a second's pause between words.  However a new answer is possible through the new Voice Control utility iOS 13 has introduced under the Settings > Accessibility menu (scroll down into Physical And Motor section).  After downloading and activating it, you can now speak to the Home screen, \"Open Notes,\" then, \"Click New Note,\" and now there are a number of commands it can recognize as ending the continuous dictation by doing things with the text.

In that context, the short pause in Siri is not helpful.\nShortcuts does have a (long winded) work around for this involving repetition and if statements.\nThis checks if the Dictated Text ends with a '.', and if not, checks for a new Dictated Text and appends the new text, each time looking for an ending '.'.\nThis doesn't actually extend the wait time, but does allow you to keep speaking, appending your text each time, until you choose to end the note with a '.'. It repeats 3 times, but you could extend this to 5 or more if you wanted.\nI've attached the full shortcut, if it helps anyone\n\n\nA: You can prevent Siri from cutting you off in the command mode by holding down the Home button until you're done speaking.  \nNormally you activate Siri in the command mode by holding the Home button until Siri responds, then releasing the button and talking.  In that mode she'll cut you off pretty quickly.  Continuing to hold the Home button bypasses that limitation.\n\nA: There are 2 ways for Siri to tell when you are done dictating an item, a standardized pause, or a tap on a button.  If Siri is creating the message, there is no button, so no other way to stop, other than listening for a pause.\nAfter creating a message, you can try appending more to it by saying \"Add ...\".\n\nA: One further way to avoid a pause that will disconnect Siri is to draw out the vowel sounds of your words, giving you time to think about what you're going to say next (e.g., \"aaaaaaaaaaaaaand\"). This can be kind of amusing, actually. :)\n\nA: A very short pause is enough for Siri to think you are done.  Get in the habit of CONTINUOUS speaking and Siri should accept all your words.\n", "Q: Audio problems with videos converted for viewing on iOS using VLC VideoLan VLC Media Player. I recently tried to watch a .avi movie over 1GB, and the video was perfect, but I could only hear audio from the background. Movies below 1GB play just fine. So is there a limit of how big the movies can be? I have an iPod touch 3rd generation running iOS 5.0\n\nA: Turn off the auto timzone detect and set your time zone to a city in Canada (that's in the same time zone as you). There are legal issues with one of the codecs in the USA. VLC checks for location by timezone setting to allow an easy workaround.\n\nA: I would recommend converting the movie to a more iPod friendly format using HandBrake\nIt's free and neat.\n\nA: http://www.mirovideoconverter.com/ is even simpler than handbrake.  Drag - Drop - Choose Format - Sent to iTunes automagically.\niOS VLC has not been updated for over a year - expect these problems to get progressively worse.\n", "Q: Enable full-screen mode for applications on Lion There some applications which I can not yet run in full-screen mode. I particularly would need the OSX Terminal app and possible the TextEdit. However, after the upgrade they remained the same, and does not have the full screen button in the top right corner. How can I enable Lion style full-screen mode for there applications?\n\nA: Lion's Terminal.app does support fullscreen mode. Maybe you are overlooking it? How did you upgrade?\nAs for TextEdit, applications need to explicitely implement Lion fullscreen support, and this has not been done for TextEdit. There are other 3rd party text editors that have implemented fullscreen mode, depending on what usage you have for a text-editor.\n\nA: Another terminal like application is iterm2. It goes fullscreen and works extremely well!(a lot better than terminal)\nhttp://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home\n\nA: Terminal does support Full Screen on Mac OS X Lion. It sounds like you’re opening an older version of Terminal. Check Terminal > About Terminal to see what version you’re using.  It should be 2.2 or later.\nYou can see the location of the Terminal you’re using by Command-Clicking on the Terminal icon in the Dock. That will reveal the Terminal application in Finder. It should be in /Applications/Utilities/Terminal on your startup volume.\n", "Q: Is it possible to control a digital camera from an iPad2?

The built in camera is good however very limited due to difficulty holding it whilst taking the picture.  \n\nA: There are applications for remote triggering more advanced DSLR cameras.\nLike this one DSLR Camera Remote HD for iPad\nHere is one more example: Remote Shutter\n\nA: You would be better off buying a remote trigger for your DSLR (if it is a DSLR you are using) these cost about £20 for a branded one and £7 for unbranded.\n", "Q: iPhone 4S crashed, Wifi crashed, Personal Hotspot gone My iPhone 4S, which i got in October, just crashed out of the blue and wouldn't restart.\nAfter reading other people's blogs I managed to restart by holding the main button and on/off button together.\nWhen it rebooted, the wifi and personal hotspots were greyed out and therefore could not connect to the internet. After switching the phone on and off, the wifi reconnected but the Personal Hotspot is still greyed out.\nWhere has my Personal Hotspot gone and how do I reconnect it?\n\nA: Since there wasn't physical trauma, you should try to restore its factory settings through iTunes.\nYou can try to restore your backup afterwards (iTunes will ask you if you want to or use the phone as a new iPhone), and see if it's still working. That should bring back your Personal Hotspot.\nIf not, re-restore it and set it up as a new iPhone. You'll lost your messages and some settings. But you should be able to keep your contacts (if sync through iCloud, Gmail, or other), and your mails.\nIf it's still not working, bring it back to an Apple Store, they'll most likely give you a new one.\nSince the Personal Hotspot feature is controlled by your carrier, so you might also want to check with them if it's still activated on your account.\n", "Q: Do you have a backup policy that covers the Worst Case Scenario? I've a lot of photos and videos of my children. I feel that losing those pictures would be a real pain for me and my family. \nIn the past I use to make, from time to time, a DVD with all my digital photos, but nowadays, my gallery is just too large to make DVDs of it. \nSo the way to go is to have a backup on Hard Drive. That's right. I have a external USB Disk dedicated to Time Machine. This situation is safe. For disk failure. But not for instance for robbery, or a fire/water damaging both disks at the same time, since thay are almost located at the same place. \nSome of you are almost ready to tell me about the cloud, but I don't to go that way.\nSo my question is: What kind of procedure do you use to keep a safe copy of your stuff?\n\nA: You do not like the cloud - yet, I will suggest online backup solutions for a worst-case-scenario, because I believe that they're the most reliable.\n\n\n*\n\n*better data retention and preservation, after all your hard disk is prone to data loss since it's a magnetic device\n\n*online backups are not prone to house robbery since they are stored in a different location\n\n*online backups are flexible - access from anywhere\n\n\nIf you care about privacy, you can still encrypt your backup.\n\nA: Absolutely! I plan for the worse!\nAs a first level of defence I'm running Time Machine against all my important files. Photos and videos. Things I wouldn't want to lose. This gives me some \"stupidity insurance\" -- if I delete something accidentally, hopefully I can get it back from a Time Machine snapshot.\nI also push all my data out to the cloud. I'm a CrashPlan subscriber. Their rates and service sat well with me so that's why I went with them. So far I've only had to use them for individual file recovery and not whole-drive recovery. It's plenty fast for individual file recovery. For whole-drive I'd probably pay to have them send me the data on a new drive.\nAnd finally, I keep two hard drives: one is in my safe deposit box, one is here on site, and I clone my important data to the drive and rotate the drives. So this week I'll clone my important data to the drive I have here. Drive to the bank and swap that drive with the one in the safe deposit box. I do that every 3 or 4 months. Between this and CrashPlan I'm feeling pretty smug about my data security.\n\nA: I had exactly the same fear. I try to be redundant. I described more in depth how I do that in a blog post but, to condense\n\n\n*\n\n*backup to hd at home\n\n*backup to hd at work (encrypted)\n\n*backup with spideroak (encrypted, on line)\n\n*local copies to my Macs.\n\nA: I have one hard drive connected to my iMac for use with Time Machine. In addition to the Time Machine backup, I maintain a bootable clone of my iMac's hard drive using SuperDuper. The hard drive with the bootable backup is stored at my in-laws' house (you could just as easily store it at a friend's house or at work). The off-site clone is updated once a week.\nWith this setup, I can recover individual files from Time Machine if necessary, but I have an off-site backup in case of a catastrophe (fire, burglary, etc.). Some people maintain a much more redundant backup scheme, but I think this provides adequate protection with relatively little effort.\n\nA: I actualy have a Time Capsule plugged into a power source in another room in the house.\nI also have the same setup at work so that any images I am working on would be safe if say someone broke in and stole my mac, as the TC is hidden away happily plugged in it works as an External HDD but it's not connected to the machine.\nThat way if someone broke in they wouldn't know to look for it. (unless they read this first)\nYou can also use two external HD's but it would be a bit of a faf.as you could store all info on one, keeping the other in another building, then next week update the sencond one, taking the 1st away.\n\nA: Store one backup disk in the attic and the other in the basement. Then a disaster happens only if you have both a fire and a flood.\nAlternatively, keep a monthly copy with your in-laws, and then there might at least be some solace should a disaster happen over there.\nYet a third possibility is to store five-stared photos and five-stared songs in the cloud, but then each of us is probably wondering why he's keeping around anything else in the first place.\n\nA: Get yourself maybe 3 or 4 USB hard drives, a suitable shipping container for each and a backup program that creates full-drive images. If your file collection is volatile and subject to daily change, then do an image backup every day and then pop it into the shipping container and UPS ground it to yourself.  That way you get your backups off premises each day without even having to leave the comfort of your abode. \nWhile it is in transit,it is safely off premises.  This way, if you take a worst case hit, the next day, a guy in a brown truck will drop a backup on your doorstep ready to be restored even if you no longer have anything workable to restore it on or a wall to plug it into. There is a cost involved.  But, what the hay...there's no free lunch these days.  \nUPS grounding to yourself is probably 98% reliable and it is relatively cost-effective and simple to do even though it might be a bit over the top for most people. But, expecting to reach 100% is an absurdity. Each increment toward 100% becomes exponentially more complex and costly.  However, only you know where you are willing to draw the line. Unless your name is Trump, Buffett or Gates, fugeddaboudit.\nGood luck.\nFrom a retired disaster recovery player with a LARGE Federal agency. \n\nA: Time machine at home, SuperDuper for a daily full clone at the office. The separation of backup methods and locations doesn't provide a super-redundant backup plan, but it's robust enough to protect against theft or undetected failure of one of the backup methods.\n\nA: Ideally, you want multiple copies of your backups in multiple locations.  This protects you from N-1 devices failing (all but 1 device).  The issue with multiple-location backups is that they're typically not very easy to create.  They require some sort of physical activity that you have to consciously have to do to create/update/maintain them.\nNo matter how bullet-proof you claim your backup strategy is, if it contains a human element it's not bullet-proof.  We're lazy and forgetful, many of us are procrastinators, so 'backups' will eventually end up breaking, becoming stale, or just not get updated any longer.\nTo this end, your backup strategy needs to be 100% automatic.  This is exactly why Time Machine was invented.  Time Machine automatically creates backups for you, with no intervention from you (as I'm sure you already know).\nThere's tons of software products out there that manage backups, and most all of them have 1 common trait: they're automatic.  You set them up, and you let them go.  You don't think about it, until you need to access them.\nYou  may say you're \"against the cloud\" or you're just not into it, or you don't want to rely on it, whatever.  Those are all fine reasons for not relying on using \"cloud\" services as your primary backup destination strategy.  All the arguments for bandwidth and caps are completely legitimate.  However, the \"cloud\" is the easiest way to get data from one location to another, without physically needing to transport it yourself.\nYou're missing out on a very reliable set of tools by not leveraging the power of \"the cloud.\"  I understand it will take a long time to upload your data initially (and probably even moving forward if you take a lot of movies), and also a painfully long time should you ever have to RESTORE your data from the cloud.  However, if you use it as a secondary backup, then both of those points are moot.  \nMost users don't saturate their internet connection very often, and especially not in the wee hours of morning, or while they're at work.  If you schedule your backups to happen during these times, then you should experience very little pain by leveraging these services.\nTo summarize; having an off-site backup (or two) in conjunction with your on-site backup(s) will provide you with the most reliable backup strategy.  Replacing those memories is impossible once they're lost (the torture of digital media!).  It's definitely worth the extra peace of mind knowing that your backup strategy is robust, reliable, and most of all SIMPLE!\n\nA: I have two USB drives, 1 TB costs about $100 these days.  I keep one in the house, and do backups of important files approximately weekly (the most important files, like family photos, tend not to change much on a daily basis).  The other stays in the safe deposit box at the bank.  Every three months, I swap the one at home for its twin at the bank, giving me a safe, relatively recent, off-site backup, and I don't have to use a \"cloud.\"  My house can burn down and I still have everything but the last couple months safely stored.\nApproximately yearly, I replace the oldest of the backup drives with a new one (hard drives do have a limited life) and give the retired drive to my parents next time I see them, to store at their house.  They live on the other side of the continent, so even after a region-wide total disaster, I've still got copies of most of my important data somewhere.\nOh, and those portable drives are encrypted, so I also do not fear them getting stolen.  To anybody else, it's just a brick.  (Details: the backup itself is in an encrypted sparse bundle on the drive, which I mount when it's time to copy the files, for which I use rsync to do incremental backups.)\n", "Q: Apple Wireless Keyboard not connecting automatically on wake Recently I'm using my MacBook Air mostly in clamshell mode, with an  Wireless Keyboard and an  Magic Trackpad paired.

(i.e. tilde, period) at the beginning of a line. In other words, press Enter, then ~, then .. (In some languages, you may need to press Shift or Alt to enter the ~ character.)\nGenerally speaking, the ~ character is an escape character in an SSH session when you type it at the beginning of a line. Type Enter then ~? to see the list of escape commands. The most common ones are\n\n\n*\n\n*~. to terminate the connection\n\n*~^Z (press ~ then Ctrl+Z) to suspend the connection and type a command locally (run the command fg to return to the SSH session)\n\n\nIf you want a tilde at the beginning of a line, press ~ twice.\n\nA: If your session is hung and the prompt is no longer responsive you can just kill the Terminal instance. All child processes associated with that instance, including your ssh session, exit.\nA more thorough approach, open a new shell (new tab or window), list ssh sessions and send kill signals:\n> ps -ef  |grep ssh\n501  1332   142   0 20Dec11 ??         0:01.33 /usr/bin/ssh-agent -l\n501 57172 57150   0  1:58pm ttys000    0:00.01 grep ssh\n501 57139 57133   0  1:57pm ttys002    0:00.03 ssh -i/Users/ian/code/ec2-keys/id_rsa-gsg-keypair someuser@someinstance.amazonaws.com\n\n> kill 57139\n\nIf that doesn't work try:\n> kill -9 57139\n\nDon't kill the ssh-agent or sshd Processes.\nOr you can open Activity Monitor and search there for sessions and hit the \"Quit Process\" button for them:\n\n\nA: ~. works, although it looks like being totally stuck, stops the ssh connection and you can start it again, but in my keyboard I have to press Alt+~ then space and then . \n\nA: For me, working with Terminal in macOS Mojave 10.14.6 the only solution was to enter ~ followed by Ctrl-Z as described in this answer: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/175670/136875\n\nA: From Ian's answer on apple.stackexhange, this is the answer for Mac OS X:\n\nThe default escape key for the ssh that ships with OS X the ~ character.

Every so often, I have to type some text consisting mostly of uppercase letters, but with an occasional lowercase letter—essentially, sentence case, but inverted. On Windows, I would simply have caps lock on the entire time, and pressing Shift would give me a lowercase letter. On OS X, however, if caps lock is on, I only get uppercase letters, whether Shift is pressed or not.\nSo, I can either hold down Shift the entire time I'm typing, letting go of it briefly to type a lowercase letter, or press Caps Lock twice for each lowercase letter I type. Neither works as well as what Windows does.\nIs there a way to get Caps Lock to behave as it does on Windows, where pressing Shift while caps lock is on produces lowercase letters?\nI am running 10.6.\n\nA: See Update below...\nIt seems (only) the input source \"French - Numerical\" will behave like Window Caps Lock (with iNVERSE sHIFT):\n\nFound that info here.\nBut note that this will come with a rather unusual keyboard layout (at least for me).\n\n\nUpdate: Using Ukelele this can be applied to all keyboard layouts:\nThanks Daniel for pointing the right direction.\nOpen Ukelele and save your (current) layout to a file (e.g. by \"New from current input source\" and \"Save\"):\n\nOpen the .xml file in a text editor and find the mapIndex that you want to use for the combination ⇧ + ⇪ (shift + caps-lock).

Due to the requirement of a 64-bit processor, a 64-bit OS, and the general evolution of requirements, much of Apple's software (and really, new software in general) simply reaches a point where you can't run newer versions without upgrading the OS, and occasionally your hardware, as a whole.\n", "Q: Can a Mac Mini use a MacBook Air CD SuperDrive?

However, when I select to delete an email (as I often do - I get rather more rubbish than I'd like) it archives the email - and I want to delete it properly from my phone. \nThis is the opposite of a lot of questions, and I'm aware that if it's setup as a gmail account I can change this setting, but seemingly not if it's setup as an Exchange account.\n\nA: You need to enable the \"Delete Email As Trash\" setting through Google Sync. Google added this feature in 2012:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your iOS device, visit http://m.google.com/sync/settings and log in.\n\n*Select your device from the list on the \"Manage devices\" page.\n\n*Click the \"Enable \"Delete Email As Trash\" for this device\" checkbox.\n\n*Tap \"Save\" to accept the new setting.\n\n\n\nNow when you delete an email on your iOS device, it will be sent to the \"Trash\" folder instead of the \"All Mail\" folder in Gmail.\nNote: This feature is only relevant if you’ve setup your Gmail account in iOS mail as a Microsoft Exchange account.\n\nA: On iOS 6, go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > [your Gmail account] > and flip the \"Archive Messages\" switch to Off. Then, when you're viewing an email in your Gmail account, you'll notice that the archive button (box icon) in the toolbar has been replaced with a delete button (trash can icon).\nAlternatively, if you tap and hold on the archive/delete button, a menu will pop up letting you choose archive or delete specifically, so you can control this on a per-message basis if you wish.\n", "Q: Dropped MacBook, lots of disk io errors. How to fix? My 2011 MacBook just slid off the table and hit the floor face down opened. There was a message saying to reset and I did. After that it wouldn't load OS X Lion; it stays at the gray screen forever. Going into single user mode and running fsck -fy returns a lot of disk i/o errors. After several hours, it's still displaying those and some other messages. Can fsck still fix this drive? Mu windows partition is working.\n\nA: Sounds like your harddisk is busted.  There is a feature in MacBooks which is there to help protect the disk by parking the head in the event of a fall but it's not foolproof.  Even if you managed to resolve the errors, I wouldn't trust that the disk had not been damaged and you just risk further data loss in future.  Best thing you can do is backup anything you can salvage if you don't already have a backup while the disk can still operate and either have Apple or an authorized repair centre replace the harddisk.  You can also replace the disk yourself if you feel capable.  There are instructions in the manual and also on the Apple support pages.  You haven't said which model of 2011 MacBook you have but here are the instructions for the 13-inch (page 37)  \nhttp://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/macbook_pro_13inch_early2011.pdf\n", "Q: How do I add more categories to Mac OS X Finder's sidebar? My Finder sidebar has two categories: Favorites and Devices. How do I add more categories?\n\nA: It's not possible to add more categories (see picture). There are:\n\n*\n\n*Favorites:\n\n*\n\n*For any subdirectory of the root directory\n\n*You can add custom links to folders (not files) via drag and drop\n\n*custom searches\n\n\n\n*Shared:\n\n*\n\n*Local Network, Servers, Back to my Mac, Time Capsule,...\n\n\n\n*Devices:\n\n*\n\n*Harddrives (internal/external), other storage media like CDs, devices like iPhones\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there is a workaround which allows to add separators and changing icons.\nDownload the icons here.\n\n\nA: So this is a very old post. However, I haven't found the solution elsewhere, so for anyone else looking - here's how I got dividers into my sidebar (working in Mavericks 10.9.4): \n\n\n*\n\n*Download the 'Lion-Sidebar-Separators-Tweak.dmg (from the icons link in gentmatt's post above)\n\n*Mount the .dmg and drag the 'SidebarSmartFolders.icns' to the 'Drop here - Resources' alias. You'll need to enter an admin password to edit that folder (it links to the package contents of the CoreTypes.bundle within the System/Library folder). \n\n*Copy the 'Smart Folders' folder to a sensible storage location.\n\n*Add one or more of the smart folders within that folder to your sidebar. The smart folder logo won't appear, and you'll just get the folder name appearing in the sidebar - i.e. a solid divider line. \nNotes \n\n\n*\n\n*This will make all your smart folders in your sidebar lose the smart folder logo. \n\n*Keep the 'Originals' folder from the .dmg in case you want to remove this tweak later.\n\n*If you use smart folders a lot in the sidebar, there is also the option to use applications. \n\n\nI hope this helps someone else looking for the same thing I was. \nCheers!\n", "Q: Find out what process is using my HDD I know it's the spotlight indexing process, but it's been killing my HDD for the last few days and will not stop. The CPU usage is rather low but fs_usage shows that the mds process is doing something the whole time.\nI'v tried force quitting it with kill -9 but it will just auto re-spawn and keep killing my HDD.\nI'v added all my HDDs into the Spotlight privacy list as well as disabling indexing sudo mdutil -a -i off\nI'v done several restarts but it keeps on going.\nAny ideas on how to stop it from opening and running?\nUpdate:\nI Managed to stop mds by the following command:\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library//LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.*\nBut after a restart my HDD is still writing ~6MB/s and reading ~500KB/s\nAny ideas how to find out which process is consuming my HDD?

I restored my iPod because it had system failures and even the settings app crashed. Now after restoring it using my backup there is no camera app despite me having it before. Do I have to restore it as a new iPod? Does anyone else have this problem?\n\nA: It sounds like the iPod has restored from backup incorrectly, I would do a factory reset and then sync again as a new device.\nYou will then need to select what apps, music etc you want to sync. It may be worthwhile deleting the first backup to stop this coming into play again.\n", "Q: How can I make the App Store remember my password? It seems that my iPod Touch (iOS 5.0.1) will keep asking for my AppleID password every time I try to install an application from App Store. It is really driving me insane.\nI would be happy to add the password once at boot up instead of entering it each time.\nI couldn't find a related option in Settings.\nHow do I change this behavior?\n\nA: Download \"password pilot\" in Cydia (the jailbreak app store) it will save your password so you wont have to keep entering it. \n\nA: You can't change this behavior.  Although, when you download a free app, you have to enter your password; if you download another free app immediately after, you won't have to re-enter your pass.  That's as close as you're going to get to a remember password feature on iOS 5.\nThis is something that was intentionally in place and now it's intentionally changed on iOS 6 to reduce the need to re-enter your password just for updates.\n", "Q: Character Picker stopped working in OS X Lion Character picker inexplicably stopped working tonight in OS X Lion.  I was trying to type in Spanish but now the keys which used to accept tildes or accents are merely repeating.\nI tried entering the following command in Terminal and restarting my MacBook Air, but it didn't restore the Character Picker:\ndefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool TRUE\nI also checked which keyboard I am using for input.  I am still using the U.S. keyboard, and that hasn't changed.\nI tried logging out, restarting, and shutting down.\nIs there anything else I can do to restore Character Picker?\n\nA: You can try disabling it.  \ndefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool FALSE\n\nThen reboot.

When I wake the AppleTV up from sleep mode or boot it up from being turned off, it makes a loud, white noise-y sound. You can listen to the noise here.\nThe noise is most likely from the AppleTV, since the TV doesn't make the noise when it is on the DVD player input, and the noise starts exactly when the AppleTV light turns on.\nHas anyone had this problem? If so, are there any known solutions or workarounds?\n\nA: This is as you correctly described static.\nThis will be due to the connection, not the Apple TV its self. You will need to confirm this by.\n\n\n*\n\n*using the Apple TV with another television\n\n*use another HDMI cable (go for one with gold connectors)\n\n\nI would check the cable first as it sounds like something is interfering with the signal. \n\nA: One way I found to avoid the static on start up when using an ATV-2 with my Insignia NS-LTDVD26 LCD TV/DVD Combo via HDMI, is to never update it.  After updating, a problem with the aspect ratio changing during steaming videos from Netflix stopped for me, but the static started.  For me, even after the update, the static clears after moving the cursor around for a few seconds.  As a work around I start the ATV first and move the \"would be cursor\" around for a few seconds, then turn on my TV, this usually avoids the static problem, as it has usually cleared by the time the TV is powered on.  Perhaps not the best work around, but the best I know of so far, since muting has little effect.  The reason I know it is the update causing the problem, for this TV model, is that I took the ATV back to the Apple Store because of the static, and they replaced it with a new one.  I used the new one for several weeks without updating it, and had no static problems, however did have a problem with the aspect ratio changing during streaming Netflix videos.  As with my first ATV, soon as I updated it, the aspect ratio problem stopped, but the static problem came back.\n", "Q: iTerm2/Terminal full screen Why is it not possible to have iTerm2 or Terminal app take up the full available space on the screen. Let me show an example:\n\nIt's hard to see but if you look on the right and bottom edge, there is some extra space. It seems impossible to expand it to use that space. What is causing this?\nI used apps that make the window take up the full screen size, such as Breeze. All other apps work fine, taking 100% of the screen space, except iTerm2 and Terminal.\nBtw, I do know about native fullscreen but I would like to know why I can't make my terminal take up 100% of the space.\n\nA: This works for me in iTerm 2 (on Mountain Lion).\nGo to: Preferences -> Profiles -> Window.\nSet:\nColumns = 204\n\nRows = 54\n\nStyle: Left of Screen\n\nScreen: Main Screen\n\n\nA: Here's a workaround I've been using for Terminal (should work with iTerm2 too).\nUse the standard Window > Zoom option followed by the Fullscreen option of Spectacle (⌥+⌘+F).\nWindow > Zoom leaves the terminal window in the original state (as seen in your question, with the thin space on the right). \nFull Screen option of Spectacle just moves the terminal window by half a character (I guess) to the left and fills the gap on the right.\nOS: Mavericks, 10.9.1\n\nA: Hold down control and you can resize it to take the whole screen (although it won't necessarily add another row or column of text).\nAlso, in the beta version, there is an advanced preference to make this the default called \"terminal windows resize smoothly.\"\n\nA: Terminals have a fixed character width and height, and most (all?) terminal application programs make the window an even multiple of that size (then add the window title, some margin around the sides, etc.), so there will never be a partial row or column visible.\nThey could theoretically add more margin at the right/bottom of the window when the window is zoomed out, but then your question might merely be replaced with someone else asking “Why is there always some blank space at the window edge when the window is zoomed?”.\nAnd what should happen to the window if you resize or show/hide the Dock (for example) such that the window is no longer the same dimensions as it would be if you zoomed it again to fit the new display area? When you Zoom a window, it isn’t placed into a “zoomed” state, it’s just resized to the current available display area at the time you Zoom it. If the available display area changes and you haven’t asked it to Zoom again, then what?\nNot that these aren’t solvable, but there are a number of dynamic behaviors to consider, and terminal applications typically keep things simple.\nNote that Mac OS X Lion “Full Screen” is an actual state that the window is in and Terminal always fits the window to the size of the display, updating when the display size changes, and adds margins as mentioned above. The size of the Dock, for example, is ignored.\n\nA: Push command+control+f or find the fullscreen option (or click the green circle button in newer versions of OS X) and it takes up every available pixel.\nHere is an image of the whole screen when Terminal is open with two tabs in fullscreen mode:\n\n\nA: As of iTerm version 3 I can set a very high value for columns and rows in Preferences > Profiles > Window and the new terminal window resizes to exactly the needed column and row values needed to fill the window. No other configuration tweaks needed.\nColumns 300 and rows 80 for me on a 2012 MacBook Pro 15\" Hi-Res.\n\nA: Go to Preferences > Window\nI am running Build 3.4.8 and could only get this to work by deselecting Native full screen windows option followed by cmd + enter\n\n", "Q: MacBook not charging I have a 2008 Black MacBook. The battery indicator says 'Not Charging' and if I remove the power adapter it powers off instantly. \nI had OS X installed, installed Windows (Not bootcamp, Windows only) and then reistalled 10.6.8. Since reinstalling OS X the battery has never charged.\nThe battery only has 68 charge cycles on it, so it seems strange it would have already died.\n\nA: As suggested, SMC reset should be your first port of call.\nIf that doesn't change anything, try removing the battery and see if the system recognises the change. (Status should change to \"no battery\"/battery icon with an x). If it changes, that pretty much means that the battery is toast.\nI'm guessing that your battery has failed as this is the most likely cause of these symptoms. Cycle counts aren't a sure fire way of determining battery health, they can just die.\nIf your battery is less than 12 months old, you are entitled to a replacement from Apple.\n", "Q: Why are there ghost items in my podcast list that I cannot delete? Check out the image below.\nI cannot finger swipe to the right to get rid of the top and bottom grayed out podcasts.\nThey are not in iTunes on my local disk or listed in the podcast section of the iPhone under iTunes.\nHow can I get rid of them?\nForcing a sync doesn't seem to work.\n\n\nA: Re-download the offending podcast then delete it. \n", "Q: Using iTunes match, my collection seems peppered with songs that cut out before their full length Using iTunes match, my collection seems peppered with songs that cut out before their full length.\nAn example: A song would be 5 minutes long, the song timer would show it as being 5 minutes long, but after 3 minutes, the song just cuts out and there's nothing playing for the remaining 2 minutes.\nHas anyone else encountered this? Better yet resolved it?\n\nA: Maybe the file is corrupt, try another file. If the file is corrupt delete it and download it again. \n\nA: Use the “Get Info” screen and go to the “Options” tab. See if you have accidentally added a Stop Time (the box will be checked and/or the text field will say 3:00).\nJust something to check!\n", "Q: What is the fastest iOS version for the iPhone 3GS? I upgraded my wife's iPhone 3GS to iOS 5.0.1 and now basic tasks like opening apps like Texts/Phone dialer are now slower than before. I understand the 3GS is 2 years old, but just being able to type Text messages fluidly is a super basic task that a 600Mhz processor should handle just fine (as it did on iOS 4.x and 3.x). If not, Apple shouldn't be pushing and advertising iOS 5.x for 3GS's.\nAnyway, what iOS version do you recommend I revert to? \nAlthough the iPhone is no longer jailbroken, I recall backing up the \"SHSH blobs\" to Cydia when it was jailbroken. So I should be able to revert to builds no longer signed by Apple.\n\nA: Ok, so after some quick googling and reading some Apple forums, it looks like iCloud (in iOS 5.x) isn't ready for prime time. I've done the following and now iOS 5.x seems a lot snappier. \n\n\n*\n\n*Disabled iCloud everywhere (Settings -> iCloud)\nDisable all apps then Scroll down and hit \"Storage and Backup\" and disable iCloud backups. If you really want to go strong, just delete your iCloud account setting (on your phone, Settings -> iCloud -> scroll to bottom)\n\n*Disabled sending data to Apple (Settings -> General -> About -> Diagnostic & Usage -> \"Don't send\")\n\n*Minimized Location Services (Settings -> Location services)\nI kept it ON globally, but disabled it for certain Apps\nMost importantly, disabled it for \"Diagnostic & Usage\" as well as \"Location based iAds\" (Settings -> Location services -> Scroll to bottom -> System Services)\n\n*Disabled notifications for the calendar (Settings -> Notification)\nI also removed notifications for many other apps that had added themselves ...\nHowever, I suspect this is fixed in iOS 5.0.1 under their \"Battery issue fixed\" patch. Earlier, Calendar notifications would hang causing CPU to be stuck 100%, draining the battery and leaving little CPU for other items.\nAlso, there are two apps, SysStatsMon and System Status. Both are good tools to see CPU usage on your iOS device. About 5+ seconds after launching them under normal circumstances, your CPU should be in the 5-15% range.\n\nA: My Girlfriend has my old 3GS running on iOS5 and there is no speed issues. So not a problem with the OS. \nHowever if you are really not comfortable with it, use iOS4. Although that was made for the iPhone 4 it worked very well with the iPhone 3GS without speed issues.\n\nA: The latest is the fastest. So 5.0.1. \n\nA: iOS 4.2.1 is the fastest for iPhone 3GS. But many apps not support iOS 4 anymore.\niOS 6 is faster than iOS 5 on 3GS – but big apps like Flipboard may be slow due memory limit on 3GS. \n", "Q: Quick switching to maximized application on Lion I used to use spaces for quick switching between applications (I had a space with a browser, another with a terminal and yet another with an editor).

I find this a great feature, however, after maximization the application it is on its own space for which I do not know how to define a keyboard shortcut.\nCould you give me a hint how to quickly, using a keyboard shortcut, access a maximized application on Lion?\nThank you!\n\nA: Use Ctrl + the arrow keys:\nCtrl + Right: switch to next space / maximized app to the right.\nCtrl + Left: switch to next space / maximized app to the left\nCtrl + Up: Exposé / Mission control showing everything\nCtrl + Down: Exposé for just the windows of the current app\n\nA: System Preferences:  Keyboard: Keyboard Shortcuts:\nSelect \"Mission Control\" on the left.\nScroll down to the \"Mission Control\" section on the right.\nTurn on the check boxes next to the \"Switch to Desktop x\" entries.\n", "Q: Which connection interface should I use with my next external HDD? I've recently bought a new macbook pro.\nSince my old backup hard drive is failing, I'm planning on buying a new one. \nI don't want to spend a lot of cash and I would like a decent amount of extra space, so I'll be going for an HDD not an SSD. \nYet I'm wondering, what would be the best data protocol to buy (USB, FW800, Thunderbolt)?\nI'd say thunderbolt is overkill since the speed of an HDD won't come near the speed thunderbolt can go (and it's pricey, and has low availability). \nIs it worth it to go FW800 over USB2/3 (my mac has USB2 anyways)? I just want the speediest solution.\n\nA: If you simply want speed, then FW800 is faster than USB2 (you do not have USB3).\nUSB has drawbacks which result in a lower then promised sustained speed (FW800>FW400>USB2).\nEdit: I've done some research to get real world numbers. While the theoretical speeds are (100MB/s vs 50 MB/s vs 60MB/s) the real world results result are (90MB/s vs 30MB/s vs 30MB/s) due to limits cause by bridge-chips (german source). Since hard drives allow transfer speeds above 30MB/s, you should take FW800.\nIf you want to be upgrade safe for a future Mac, I'd take USB2/3. Firewire support is probably going to be dropped in the near future (see Macbook Air).\nThunderbolt is overkill - as you said.\n", "Q: Setting up iPhoto library on external HDD Is there any way to set iPhoto library on external HDD instead of main HDD. I have a lot of photos and am running out of space on my MBP. \nI was thinking to achieve it by symlinks or something. It this possible at all?\nIf not, I'd be glad if anyone could recommend a iPhoto-like program which supports having photo library on external disk.\n(I'm using Snow Leopard with iPhoto'09, but aby solution would be great as I'm about to upgrade to Lion)\n\nA: You can simply copy the iPhoto Library to an external hard drive and access it form there. Of course you need to have the external HDD connected whenever you want to run iPhoto.\nTo copy the library: Quit iPhoto. In your Pictures folder there should be a file (actually a special folder called a package) called iPhoto Library. Copy this folder to the new location on the external HDD. Since you're using iPhoto '09 you can just double-click on the library in its new location and iPhoto will open it and use it as the default library from now on.\nThis Apple Support document also covers the copy process. \nHowever, you need to be very careful if you have images that are not contained in the iPhoto Library (referenced images) as these won't be copied to the new location. If you have the \"Copy Photos to Library\" option checked in iPhoto preferences, and have always had it checked (it's the default), then you shouldn't have a problem.\n\nA: Michal, it's possible to do this with symlink.\nWhat I did is to have my iPhoto Library folder moved to an external HDD (you could also choose a USB thumb drive). When I next launched iPhoto.app, it prompted me and asked where is the missing iPhoto Library which I then specified. The only catch is you need to remember to plug-in the external HDD before you launch iPhoto else it'll prompt you.\n\nA: You can move your iPhoto library when iPhoto is not running:\n$ mkdir -p /Volumes/DEVELOPMENT/Pictures/\n$ mv ~/Pictures/iPhoto\\ Library.photolibrary/ /Volumes/DEVELOPMENT/Pictures/\n\nThe next time you open your iPhoto, press ALT and click the iPhoto icon. Then you can specify the new location in the GUI. This way I made over 5GB room on my startup disk.\n", "Q: Turn on bluetooth via terminal/command line How can I turn on bluetooth via the terminal / the command line? \n\nA: There is an answer over at Superuser. The last post there is what I found to work best, in a slightly different form. The 'checkbox \"On\"' did not work for me, but the following code did:\n# This is only necessary, if AppleScripts are not yet allowed to change checkboxes\ntell application \"System Events\" to set UI elements enabled to true\n# Now change the bluetooth status\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    set current pane to pane id \"com.apple.preferences.bluetooth\"\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell process \"System Preferences\"\n            # Enabled is checkbox number 2\n            if value of checkbox 2 of window \"Bluetooth\" is 0 then\n                click checkbox 2 of window \"Bluetooth\"\n            end if\n        end tell\n    end tell\n    quit\nend tell\n\nYou can execute this script using osascript.\nUpdate: I now changed the script to just enable Bluetooth.

It's insanely annoying having the email reply pop directly over my Firefox window every time I hit reply to an email in Mail. Each time I drag it over to the vacant space on the left of my primary display, and EVERY time it returns when I reply to an email.\nFinder has similar issues with Cmd+N, resize, close. Open a window, resize it, close it, immediately open another new window, and it's where the original one was.\nIs there a system-wide or third-party solution for forcing applications to place new windows where I left their previous ones?\n\nA: This is by no means a perfect fix, but I use Divvy as my solution to this issue - probably the single best Mac addon I've ever bought. It's not free but it has global keyboard shortcuts which would mean a badly placed window is a ctrl+something away from being perfect again. \n", "Q: AppleUSBCDC weirdness after strange incident I use my MBP propped on one of those laptop stands, ergo my external USB mouse and USB keyboard (both generic cheap-ass Logitechs) are always connected through a powered Belkin USB hub.\nYesterday I noticed the following — after trying to eject my iPod, my USB mouse started “slowing down”, the pointer wasn’t moving smoothly.

It comes with a pair of apple earbuds that have a remote and a microphone. \nI used to have an iPod, that has a set of earbuds that have a remote but not a microphone. When I long pressed the center button of the remote on the earbuds, the iPod said the title and artist of the current playing song. \nOn the iPhone though, when I long-press the center button (of the remote with microphone), it starts voice control. \nIs there a way to change the iPhone settings to resemble the iPod settings? I don't ever use voice control, yet I do use the microphone for calling people while on my bike.\n\nA: When the beep sounds you can ask:\n\"What song is this?\"\nIt will speak the title, and artist. There isn't a way to turn this off sadly.\n", "Q: How can I disable the \"Welcome, Name!\" banner notification for Game Center? As per this question I've found banners to cause slowdown on iOS 5, it turns out the \"welcome, you have been signed in\" Game Center message does this too, and on occasion it will interupt me several times in a game if I switch in/out of the app while playing as it logs be in/out repeatedly.\nIs there a way to disable this notification while leaving Game Center enabled? I tried revoking the banner notification rights from Game Center but the pop up still appears.\n\nA: That login banner is a provided aspect of the Game Center API in the iOS SDKs,  as far as I'm aware there is no way as a developer to disable it from opening when the Game Center login completes. As a user, there is certainly no way to disable it, because it is part of the application's compiled source code.\nHowever, note that it's not the banner that is causing the delays and skips. It is actually the entire login process to Game Center. My only advice is when you open a game that has Game Center logins, open it up to the first functional screen, and just wait the ~5-10 seconds it takes to reveal the Game Center banner. After the banner has displayed and disappeared, proceed normally and you should not be affected any further.\n\nA: Yes, it's possible to suppress the Game Center Welcome banner programmatically from within your app, at least under iOS 7. My approach is predicated on a few observations:\n\n\n*\n\n*The banner is presented as an additional UIWindow within your UIApplication.\n\n*This window always seems to appear at index 1. (presuming your app only uses one window.)\n\n*The banner is 66 pixels high on iPad, 64 on iPhone.\n\n*The banner contains a 42x42 pixel subview for the Game Center icon.\n\n*It's known when the banner is likely to appear. (i.e. within a few seconds of creating a GKLocalPlayer object on launch to test authentication.)\n\n\nSo you can simply poll your application's windows repeatedly over these few seconds, waiting for the extra window to appear. (Key-value observing is probably the \"correct\" way to do this, but I'm lazy.) When the window shows up, test whether it contains a subview hierarchy as described above, which indicates that it's probably the Game Center banner. If it is, set the alpha of the window to 0. That's it.\nHere's some code that accomplishes this in my app. I call this method immediately after attempting to authenticate the local player, and it calls itself for a few seconds until it finds (and hides) the banner, or else times out:\n- (void)suppressGCBanner:(id)object {\n    int osVersion = [[[UIDevice currentDevice] systemVersion] intValue];\n    if (osVersion != 7) return;  // only tested against iOS 7\n\n    static int iter = 0;    // try for 4 seconds, typically takes about one second for banner to appear\n    static int origWindowCount = 0;\n\n    NSArray* windows = [UIApplication sharedApplication].windows;\n    if (origWindowCount == 0) origWindowCount = (int)[windows count];\n\n    BOOL ipad = UI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM() == UIUserInterfaceIdiomPad;\n    float bannerHeight = ipad ? 66.0f : 64.0f;  // GC banner has height 66 on iPad, 64 on iPhone\n\n    if ([windows count] > origWindowCount) {\n        NSLog(@\"suppressGCBanner: found extra window, testing\");\n\n        UIWindow* window = [windows objectAtIndex:1]; // in my testing, the GC banner is always at index 1\n\n        for (UIView* view in [window subviews]) {\n            CGRect frame = view.frame;\n            NSLog(@\"subview size: %f, %f\", frame.size.width, frame.size.height);\n\n            if (frame.size.height != bannerHeight) continue;\n\n            for (UIView* subview in [view subviews]) {\n                CGRect frame = subview.frame;\n                NSLog(@\"sub-subview size: %f, %f\", frame.size.width, frame.size.height);\n\n                if (frame.size.width == 42.0f && frame.size.height == 42.0f) { // Game Center icon is 42x42\n                    NSLog(@\"found GameCenter banner: hiding. iter = %i\", iter);\n\n                    window.alpha = 0.0f; // make the window invisible!\n\n                    return;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (++iter > 200) {\n        NSLog(@\"suppressGCBanner: timeout, bailing\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // ____ otherwise recurse\n    [self performSelector:@selector(suppressGCBanner:) withObject:nil afterDelay:0.02f];\n}\n\nOnce in a while you'll see a single-pixel line flicker at the top of the screen before the banner is hidden, but in general this method seems to work well enough. Use at your own risk, and enjoy!\n\nA: There does seem to be a way to disable Game Centre, but it's not obvious, or wasn't to me.\nSign out of Game Centre.\nIf you then start a Game Centre game it will pop up asking you to log in to Game Centre again.\nInstead of logging in, press the Cancel button in the top left hand corner.\nThen Exit the game and repeat until you've opened the game and canceled the Game Centre login three times. \nA new dialog pops up asking whether you wish to disable Game Centre.\nStart the game again and there is none of the Game Centre stuff popping up anymore.\nSo far this seems to have worked for me. The PITA has kept quiet for now.\n\nA: Try this:\nSettings > Notifications > Game Center\n\nThere you should see all of the options related to alerts, notifications, etc. which you can change, or disable completely.\n", "Q: What is the shortcut for fullscreen mode in Lion?

So all I my google business searches would default to Houston. \nIs there any way I can convince this phone I live in Hixson, TN?\n\nA: The iPhone (like pretty much all cell phones that support this feature) gets its timezone information from the carrier. Unfortunately many carriers send out the wrong timezone information and there's very little you can do about it other than switch off the Set Automatically option in the Date & Time settings.\n\nA: We went by car from Eastern time (Tallahassee FL) to Central time (St. Louis)), my iphone 4S changed at the time zone border, on the way back my wife's iphone 4S switched exactly at the timezone border, but mine, now a day later still shows Chicago time (both phones are on the newest OS),\nPowering down (pressing home and side button) and up again remedied the problem (now back on New York time, why not Atlanta is a mystery to me).\n\nA: On mime the workaround is to switch the event to all day then switch it back and it is correct,,\n\nA: Your carrier is using a proxy ...verify this by checking your ip address location on your  phone.

The folder action applies a shell script, and then writes output to a different folder, \"Markdown Output\" (no bonus points for guessing what the script might be).\nThe problem is that sometimes when I save a file to the \"Markdown Source\" the script runs, and creates the file in \"Markdown Output\", but sometimes it does not. This problem seems to happen most frequently if I re-add a file to the folder than has previously been in the folder but was subsequently moved elsewhere.\nDoes anyone know if there is a way to change how often Folder Actions look for new input, to manually force Folder Actions to run, or some other way to be sure that all the items in my Markdown Source directory get processed?\n\nA: In my and others' experience, Folder Actions are unreliable, especially with large numbers of changes. So the problem you're facing is not specific to your system, but a rather common one.\nI suggest you rewrite your script into one that receives a folder as input, and performs the Markdown transformation on all files within. Have it trigger automatically whenever a file is written to by a launchd job, with the parent folder specified in the WatchPaths rule.\nSince most programs on OS X perform atomic saves and thereby replace the previous file instead of simply modifying its contents, the folder will also be updated and the job will be triggered reliably.\nMarkdown transformation also shouldn't be too time consuming, and you can always ensure only to transform files using your script that were changed in the last X minutes.\n", "Q: iTunes unable to backup data before iOS upgrade After uploading iOS 5 to my iPhone, there was a message from iTunes saying that, during the procedure, iTunes was unable to backup my data.

I was about to connect other end of USB cable to my Android phone when the MacBook crashed suddenly. \nMacBook was running on battery at the time of crash, I tried pressing power buttons many times but it didn't help. Around 20 minutes before crashing I had checked battery and it said that 2 hours are remaining. I connected power adapter and it is showing very dim green light (as compared to bright green light that is shown when charging). \nWhat can be the problem here?\n\nA: Since your MacBook Pro is only 3 months old, it is under warranty. Take it to an Apple Store or other Apple authorized repair center immediately and let them diagnose and fix the problem.\nYou might have a faulty Mac motherboard, or you might have a faulty MagSafe power adapter, or, worse, the electrical current in the house where you plug in the power adapter may have substandard \"dirty\" power that is preventing the power adapter from properly powering the computer.\nBut since it is under warranty, the authorized Apple repair people will diagnose the problem for you. If it is the fault of Apple equipment, they should repair it for you at no charge.\n\nA: Dim green means you have a poor connection at the magsafe connector. When it is dim, your battery is not charging. \nEnsure you have a good connection and try powering on your computer again. \n", "Q: Is it possible to use the Rōv scanner that ships with Delicious Library for general purpose scanning?

Does it increase security? In the System Preferences there is the option:\n`Security & Privacy -> Firewall -> Advanced... -> Enable Stealth Mode\nDoes this options significantly increase the security when networking or surfing the internet?\nThe hint only says:\nDon't respond to or acknowledge attempts to access this computer from the network by test applications using ICMP, such as Ping.\nThe hint does not explain how my work with the Mac is affected.\n\nA: Yes. Stealth mode enhances your system's security. Stateful packet inspection is another crucial component of a firewall's prowess. It's also of note that Apple's firewall is powered by the rugged ipfw.\nWhat Apple says is a concise summary of how stealth mode works, and if you aren't versed in IT security, a full-fledged explanation won't offer up much more as it's a complex system (TCP, or Transmission Control Protocol, which is just one element of data transmission itself is rather complicated and deeply layered).\nThe fundamentals of networking (aka transferring data on the internet) rely on protocols that establish connections (\"handshaking\" starts it all) and then relay of data (through things like TCP and UDP). ICMP (such as pinging or echo requests) are typically used to \"probe\" a target host (most often for quite valid reasons), identifying it on the network. Hackers use them to find their prey.\n\nFirewalls work by planting themselves between the kernel and the TCP/IP stack (so at a very deep level) and watching the packets that run between those layers. In the image above, a system's kernel would be located between the ethernet driver and hardware. The firewall would sit right on top of the kernel. Firewalls need this deep level of integration to remain rugged and durable. If a firewall were implanted at a high level, say at the level of your browser, it would make it highly susceptible to attack. The deeper a process is located (closer to the kernel), the harder it is to gain access to it.\nWhen a system runs without a firewall, the packets are allowed free access (in and out). If an echo request is sent, an echo response is loosed by your computer (think of it as a greeting; someone on the street passes you and says \"hello,\" you smile and greet them in return). But when a firewall is operational, it steps in, like a member of the secret service, following its protocol. If it is told to deny requests, it will send a message to the machine making the request that it does not reply to echo requests. The machine gets a notice that their echo request was denied (or blocked). Naturally this doesn't give that machine much information, but it does inform them that someone is there.\nStealth mode, on the other hand, doesn't. The firewall watches the echo request come in, and instead of denying it, it simply tells your computer to ignore the packet. The machine on the other end, not only doesn't get any data, but doesn't even get a notice of rejection. It's as if their packet was just lost in the space. And that's indicative of either a machine guarded by a secure firewall, or a machine that doesn't even exist.\nIn effect, it's the equivalent of putting someone through to voicemail (denying the echo request) or simply disabling voicemail and letting it ring, indefinitely (running under stealth mode).\nAs with anything, a clever hacker can bypass these safe guards, but it does make their life a lot harder. And that's the key to security: making the hackers job just a little bit harder at every turn. That greatly weeds out the \"script kiddie\" from the die-hard, Lulzsec hacker.\nStealth mode cloaks you from those initiating traffic, but it doesn't make you invisible. Once a connection is established (either by you, or by something that was allowed to negotiate outbound traffic), you pop up on the grid just like any computer. So while sending ping requests may no longer work, there are still plenty of ways hackers could still establish a connection and potentially exploit your computer through a running service.\n", "Q: App for custom Gmail push notifications Does anyone know of an app that can notify me of new emails in my Gmail in specific time intervals?

It uses in-document encryption, and not any sort of external security routine that may be common to generally protecting files.\nThe only time I've used something like this recently is with PDF files, but thankfully Preview.app supports document passwords.\nYour best bet would be to find somebody that will unlock it via MS Word's password mechanism, and send it to you manually, perhaps using some other more compatible document protection mechanism such as the aforementioned PDF with a read-only password on it, or a password protected ZIP file.\nAnother hunch I have would be to see if OpenOffice.org supports document passwords to allow you to view them. I can confirm that OpenOffice supports this feature, but this doesn't say it's interoperable with MS Word documents. I can only suggest that you give it a try for yourself. OpenOffice.org is a great alternative Microsoft replacement Office suite with fairly good Microsoft document compatibility.\n\nA: You will need a copy of Word to unlock it. When password protected Word will encrypt the file, this needs to be unencrypted by Word.\nAs Jason says you will need to find someone with work to unlock it, depending on what software you are using, be it Pages or what ever it will then need to be saved in a readable format without a password.\nYou ahve an option to download a trial version and unlock it as well, however this will only work for a certain trial period. If it really is a problem contact the doc producer or buy Word.\n", "Q: Can my iPhone search for Wi-Fi only when in a specific location? Searching for Wi-Fi uses battery, and it's annoying when the \"Choose Network\" dialogue box pops up when an iPhone is Wi-Fi enabled, but I don't have any desire to connect to a network.\nIs there any built-in function or iPhone (I have a 4S) app that enables Wi-Fi ONLY when the phone is in a certain location -- say \"home\"?\nThis seems fairly basic enough, as the phone always knows where I am, and accurately when Location Services are activated. Any help?\n\nA: No, there is no way to do this.\nAlso, wifi is only searched for when you actually go to use your phone. It won't search for wifi networks constantly while the phone is in your pocket. Your iPhone is very good at managing its own battery usage. Checking what SSIDs exist is very battery efficient.\nLastly, you can turn off that annoying prompt that comes up whenever networks are discovered. It'll still automatically connect to wifi networks that you trust, but that dialog will never appear.\n", "Q: Is there a way to have clipboard buffering in OS X? Does OS X have this built in?  It is tedious with only one buffer.\n\nA: I would recommend something like Jumpcut:\n\nJumpcut is an application that provides \"clipboard buffering\" — that is, access to text that you've cut or copied, even if you've subsequently cut or copied something else. The goal of Jumpcut's interface is to provide quick, natural, intuitive access to your clipboard's history.\n\n\nFlycut is another option.\n\nDescription: Flycut is a clean and simple clipboard manager for developers. It based on open source app called Jumpcut.\n\n\n\nA: Control K (to cut)and Y (to paste) can be used for this functionality i believe. although it's more or a cut and paste rather than copy.\n\nA: Launchbar offers clipboard history among a gazillion other features. I recommend Launchbar because once you get used to it, you can rarely use your mac without it :)\nParticularly: \n\nClipboard History\nSeamless integration in LaunchBar’s standard interface. Unique\n  features such as stack operation (last-in/first-out), ClipMerge™, etc.\n  Paste as Plain Text option. Paste a sequence of clipboard objects\n  using Paste and remove from history. Quick Look integration. Clipboard\n  objects can be used for LaunchBar actions such as browsing, send-to,\n  drag & drop, etc. Customizable Ignore List to protect sensitive data.\n\nBut there are other \"multiple clipboard\" utilities for Mac and you can surely find a lot by just googling. iClip is a popular one.\n\nA: I use the clipboard history in Alfred. You need to buy the Powerpack to use it and it only supports plain text, but it's searchable, I like the UI, and you can set it to keep all history for up to three months.\n\n", "Q: Why are executables called DMG (disk image) files? I am not experienced with OSX but I have been using it recently. \nIt seems to me the equivalent of an .exe (executable) in Windows is a .dmg (disk image) in OSX. \nAnd you don't install it, you mount it.\nI am trying to wrap my head around these terms, why do they call it this?\n\nA: Straight answer.\n.dmg files are not equivalent to executables on Windows. A .dmg is also known as an Apple Disk Image. It is a compressed storage and delivery bundle format often used for installer packages, although it can have other functions. Very loosely speaking, a .dmg is more like a .zip, .rar, .gz or .tar file.\nThe Mac OS X equivalent of an Executable is an application, and it ends in .app\nThere is a Wikipedia entry on Apple Disk Image at this link.\nIt says, in part:\n\nThe [.dmg] format allows secure password protection as well as file\n  compression and hence serves both security and file distribution\n  functions; it is most commonly used to distribute software over the\n  Internet. Universal Disk Image (UDIF) is a flat file format, and is\n  the native image format for Mac OS X.\n\n\nA: .dmg files are disk images, similar to an .iso file.\nYou can think of them like a virtual CD. You put it into the CD drive (mount it), and its contents appear on your computer.\nWhen used for software downloads, they are simply a way to bundle up files, like in a ZIP archive. Their advantage is that it's possible to customize the design (e.g. Finder window background and icon positions, see example below).\n\nThe actual program is in a special bundle or package directory with the usually invisible extension .app. It contains an application's resources, like image files, and the actual binary (the \".exe equivalent\") that is executed when you start the program. If you want to compare it to a Windows equivalent, the closest would probably be the folder in C:\\Program files\\ created by a program's installer.\nTo install such an application from a disk image, you drag and drop it to your hard drive, e.g. the Applications directory. That's what a lot of disk images try to convey in their disk image design: You grab the application, Adium in this case, and drag it onto the Applications folder:\n\n", "Q: How can I install Debian on a PowerBook G3 with Mac OS 9.2?

Mbox files are just text files, so there's not much going on in them. You'll need to follow your alternative and back them up from finder or consider moving them to a Lion mac to see if this issue is corrected there.\n\nAccording to the Mac OS Extended format (HFS Plus) volume and file limits  KBase article, a 2 GB file and volume limit existed from OS 10.0 to 10.1.5 and was raised to 8 GB from 10.2 to 10.2.8.\nIn your case on Snow Leopard (and any OS 10.4 or newer) - the file size limit is 8 exabytes. \n\nStop here unless you want all sorts of silly storage calculations that don't really apply since you'd need 2.6 million 3 TB drives to make this amount of real space.\n8 EB is eight million terabytes. This insane amount of storage would list price cost $480 million for the hardware alone if you ran BackBlaze storage units.\n\nA: I have successfully archived mbox folders in excess of 10GB using MailSteward.\nThe program puts mail into a SQLlite or MySQL (depending on the version) database, archives attachments, and allows archived mail to be easily tagged, searched, accessed and replied to/forwarded etc.\n", "Q: How to replace a Mac hard drive with a Windows hard drive and run Windows Vista History: My macbook hard disk failed after i dropped it and I need to replace my hard drive. I have a hard drive from a PC laptop that has Windows Vista 64-bit installed on it.\nObjective: I want to replace my macbook hard disk with the PC hard disk and run the Windows Vista that is on it.\nProblem: How do I do this without reformatting my windows hard disk? This hard disk probably has a MBR and no GUID partition (GPT). Is there a way for me to change the boot sector to GPT safely and the windows Vista SP1 will boot from it? I definitely can't run it as an external hard disk with external case since Windows Vista doesnt support USB booting. Is there a boot manager program that will add an EFI partition to my hard disk?\nRandom Idea: If there was a program that would allow me to transfer my windows partition to a backup drive, I could probably install OSX and then use bootcamp to setup the hybrid boot sector and then copy back my windows partition. That might be the perfect solution, if there's no way to move a windows hard disk to a mac.\nUpdate:\nI have read that it is possible to migrate a windows bootcamp installation using WinClone, so I will attempt to use winclone on the windows partition from my PC and then restore this to a fresh bootcamp setup using Winclone\n\nA: You could install a retail version of Windows on the Mac and migrate your data (which you would previously have backed up) onto it.  Just mounting a Windows install that had been made on other hardware is pretty much doomed to failure.  The correct hardware drivers won't be present and the existing ones wouldn't be correct for the hardware, for starters.\n", "Q: How can I sleep the display from Terminal? I'd like to be able to turn my screen off from command line.\nI know there's the keyboard shortcut ctrl+⇧+⏏ but I want to do it from a shell script or remotely. \nIs there a way?\n\nA: In OS X 10.9, you can simply do pmset displaysleepnow. This will immediately turn off your display without changing any of your settings or putting the entire host to sleep.\nEscalated privileges don't seem to be required (at least with recent versions of OS X), but if you get a message about inadequate privileges, you could do sudo pmset displaysleepnow.\nBased on feedback from commenters, this is not available in OS X 10.8 or earlier.\n\nA: The following script will do the job (in Leopard and later), but it must be run with sudo:\nThe premise is that pmset can set a time until display sleep, but the problem is that a value of 0 turns the feature off, rather than setting the delay to zero, and a value of 1 is a full one minute delay. The magic here is that a value of 2^31 seems to be stored as negative zero, which magically functions as \"turn the display off immediately\". \nIn Tiger and earlier, a different magic number was needed, because a different bit-sized variable was used internally to store the delay, in minutes, until the display turns off.\nThis mimics the behavior of control-shift-eject, and can be used on MacBook Airs without an eject key.\n#!/bin/bash\noriginal_setting=`/usr/bin/pmset -g | /usr/bin/awk '/displaysleep/ {print $2}'`\nmagic_number=2147483648\n/usr/bin/pmset -a displaysleep $magic_number; sleep 1; /usr/bin/pmset -a displaysleep $original_setting\n\n\nA: Here's a simple shell script that will do it.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nopen /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Versions/A/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app\n\nThis will run/start whatever settings you have enabled for Screen Saver on that computer.\n\nA: Run the following command to execute a short AppleScript that puts the display to sleep:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to sleep'\n\nThe command name suggests that it might put the entire system to sleep under some circumstances, but I could not make that happen in limited testing: I tested it with a shell script I started shortly before executing this command, and that was running for a few minutes until I \"awoke\" the system.

My favourite way to sleep, restart, shut down - and most importantly lock - a Mac is using Alfred (the app launcher).\nIt doesn't require any scripts, knowledge of scripts or use of terminal, which is brilliant.\nHowever, if you specifically WANT to use terminal, this probably isn't the solution for you.\n\nA: Wake: caffeinate -u -t 2\nSleep: pmset displaysleepnow\n\nA: You could use the pmset command to change the value for displaysleep, something like\npmset -a displaysleep 1\n\n(requires root)\n\nA: Well, this is an old one, but it seems there aren't really good answers for this question anywhere.\nI've gotten an AppleScript to work, though it requires a third-party, unmaintained, and un-registrable app—Extra Suites.

Having recently wasted hours on a simple problem, I've transferred my anti-Midas magic to a friend, and lost some email data. Could someone advice (a) whether the below was an obviously stupid idea, and (b) if I can do anything in the way of recovery?\nSo, my friend uses Hotmail via POP3 in Mail, in Mac Lion on a MBP. This is set to delete mail in a week after it is read from the server (although she trims mail manually in the Hotmail web interface, and is fairly sure old mail wasn't being deleted, since she still has very old mail in her web-based inbox).\nOK, so she's started a new company, and has purchased a domain/hosting package, and needed assistance setting it up. The requirement was that mail should pool in her Mail inbox together with Hotmail, but she should have a profile widget in the New Mail interface that lets her set which email address each message should come from.\nEasy enough, I reasoned. The domain was already set to forward to her Hotmail address, so the hosting company is not doing any mail holding - just sending it on. I figured that creating a new mail profile which had all her Hotmail credentials except for the From address, which would be the info@example.com address we were setting up, would do the trick. Now, at this stage you're thinking:\n\n\n*\n\n*that's worth a go,\n\n*that won't work, or\n\n*don't do that, you'll break it!\n\n\nI'm hoping you're not thinking 3, since I went ahead and did that, and although the profile created, it caused an error, and did not appear to work. The error was:\nThe account path /Users/<name>/Library/Mail/V2/POP-<email>@<pop3-server>\nis already being used by the account \"Hotmail\".\n\n\"OK\", said I - and duly deleted the newly created \"MyDomain\" account. Sadly this removed the inbox, drafts and sent items related to the (perfectly functional) \"Hotmail\" account (which I didn't touch). A call to Apple support in India resulted in the specialist logging a call - and he seemed amenable to the idea that, since the profile popped up that error when we saved it, it should have warned us that it was about to do something catastrophic. I offered to log a bug with Apple via the web, but he said there would be no need, since he'd already done it.\nSo, either I hit against a Mail bug, and I should be hopping up and down, or I did something perfectly stupid, and I should be sitting in the naughty corner for a few hours. Honest thoughts very welcome on this point.\nMeanwhile, my friend and I - in the absence of backups - are trying data recovery software (Disk Drill) to get back the mails that have been lost. We will see if this works tomorrow, but if any other ideas are forthcoming, I am all ears. We've dug into the Hotmail mail folder, and the important-sounding folders are 40KB or so - i.e. basically empty.\nHelp! and TIA.\nEdit: it's a long shot, but my friend might have been running iCloud. Should this back up all her email, or just me.com email? We went into the interface and couldn't see anything under email (everything seemed empty) but I guess that might be because she wasn't logged in, or iCloud doesn't back this stuff up, or it wasn't running...\n\nA: If I'm reading the initial question correctly, you wish to select which account new mail comes from.\nIn Mail prefs > Accounts > Account Information tab you can enter multiple email addresses in the Email Address field. You must separate them by commas.\n\nWhen you create a new message The From dropdown will list every email address. These addresses will be used in the From: field.\n\n\nA: Why the mail was lost\nMail.app saves data for each email account, indeed, in the following folder structure:\n~/Library/Mail/V2/POP-<email>@<pop3-server>\n\nOne folder for each unique mailbox.\nSo, of course, if two emails actually use the exact same <email> and <pop3-server>, you can see that there will be a conflict: both their data would be stored in the same folder, which would conflict on each and every mail / state save.\nMail.app warned you about this (though in a very user-unfriendly way. It should have said you can't have two accounts with the exact same username and server). However, where it seems to have bugged quite severly, is that it did create the account in its registry, even though it said it couldn't. So, when you deleted it from the registry, it also went on to delete the data associated with the account. This data was in… well, ~/Library/Mail/V2/POP-<email>@<pop3-server>. So, it deleted the data for both accounts, effectively falling into the conflict it had tried to avoid.\nThe “duplication” idea\nYou're asking if duplicating the account was a “good / let's try / oh-no” idea. I'd say, it's neither. It's just a “won't work & not really useful” idea. If the hosting (publicly-visible) email was set to redirect to hotmail, then all the mail that was needed to check was in hotmail.\nSender → email@company → hotmail → Mail.app\n         ↑ not saved     ↑ not saved\n         upon transfer   upon POP dl\n\nWhy create another account with From changing? To be able to send mails that would only show the publicly-visible @company email? Then you did it wrong. Not wrong as in “you'll break it”, but wrong as in “you didn't know how mail works and made a wrong assumption”.\nMails are sent using the SMTP protocol (a protocol to send, like POP is a protocol to download mail from a server). Changing the From header would not have been a guarantee that everything would have worked as expected. Indeed, hotmail would have probably (I can't be sure because I don't have any hotmail account, but in my experience most providers do, especially web-based ones) refused to send that mail.\nThink about it: you would have asked hotmail's SMTP servers to send a mail pretending to come from an address that is not from hotmail. It's like asking UPS to deliver a package that has a competitor's stamp. The main reason this is extremely rare is that it would allow spammers to use such a service to deliver millions of emails without being caught: the mail pretends to originate from @whatever, but is actually sent from @hotmail. How could anyone trace this?\nWhose responsibility it was\nSo, since you seem to be wanting mostly to assign blame:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mail should have been more explicit in its error message; that's not a bug, but that's bad UX.\n\n*Mail should not have let you validate the account creation upon error. That was a bug, which became critical upon the edge case that you fell in: having another account with the exact same settings, and wanting to delete one of them.\n\n*The idea of duplicating the account was not a good one, but should never have had such consequences. The assumption you made was false, but there is no doubt it is entirely the software's fault if data loss occurred.\n\n\nAs a matter of fact, data loss would not have happened if Mail.app had used a different file hierarchy (not to say it should have, it is much better this way than with useless ID numbers; but I mean it is the implementation that was chosen that is responsible, not the mail setup). They should have seen the edge case of multiple accounts being set up and either completely forbidden multiple accounts creation or not deleted data as long as one account uses the said folder.\nNext\n\n\n*\n\n*BUY AN EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE AND SET TIME MACHINE UP. We all learn about this the hard way, and it is one such occasion.\n\n*Forget about hotmail. Seriously. It is a shame to use such a client. Even if you don't use its web interface, it is bad. It has terrible spam filtering, does not support IMAP (at least to my knowledge), has poor file size limits… Get an account on a serious mail provider such as Gmail or Y!mail: web interface is excellent, quotas are much higher, attachments size is twice as big, the spam filtering is great, and they support IMAP.\n\n*Use IMAP. We all agree that emails are most of the time critical pieces of information, especially in a business setting. IMAP will let you synchronize state (such as read / flagged), and keep a copy of all mails on the server. This way, you will get three backups: one online, safe on your provider's server. One synchronized, on your main computer. One offline, in case of an accidental deletion, in the Time Machine backup you've set up in #1.\n\n", "Q: Command line brightness (Lion) \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I dim the screen from Terminal? \n\nIs there a command I can execute to modify screen brightness?

Or is possible to edit the Netflix app files or something? Thanks for the help. \n\nA: I've done this before, and it caused a bit of instability, but all you need to do is open /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist in iFile, find where it says iOS version 4.X, and change it to 5.0.1. This will allow you to download any app that requires iOS 5.\n\nA: Even if you could fool the app, it would crash as soon as it called on a part of the system that exists in iOS 5 but not in iOS 4. Your editing of the file would both have to be the main version requirements check as well as any internal checks that the app makes to determine the capabilities and API present on that device as the program runs. I don't know any developer that just said they need iOS 5 out of spite against people running 4, 3, 2 versions of iOS. It's always been because they need features and code frameworks added in iOS 5 and couldn't code around it in the program. When a developer can do that, they change their app to work on multiple os versions and let you know feature X is disabled or works differently when running on iOS 4. For developers that want to use the latest tools in iOS, it is actually more work for them to keep the older OS support in each build so there needs to be a good financial reason to keep doing that work in many cases. \n\nThink of the iOS version test as sealing a door to nowhere opening up on the third floor of a building when the fire escape stairs (or balcony or whatever) is not yet built. When the program you deceive into thinking it's running on iOS 5.x calls on code that doesn't exist, the app will crash. \nApple designed the version check to \"lock the door or perhaps the entire wing of that building\" in a very visible way. By bypassing this check, it's like removing the \"danger / hazard\" signs and nailed wood braces covering the opening and letting someone walk out into thin air from that third-floor door to nowhere.\n\nA: Deleting /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist solved the problem for me.  There's no guarantee what will happen if you delete your /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist but it seemed to work for me on iOS4.3.3(8J2) to fix the issues I was having as mentioned in the previous post.\nI don't recommend spoofing the iOS version in SystemVersion.plist as it would appear that the new App Store is not compatible with iOS 4.3.3.\n", "Q: How do I copy the name of the song currently playing on an internet radio station in iTunes? I frequently feel like Googling, YouTubing, or downloading some song playing on an internet radio station.  Mac OS X's iTunes displays the song information, but doesn't provide any obvious route to copying the song's author, name, etc.\nI'm not interested if the iTunes Store offers relevant features because I always keep the iTunes Store disabled in parental controls.\n\nA: Use this AppleScript to copy the current stream title to the clipboard:\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    set stream_title to (get current stream title)\nend tell\n\nset the clipboard to stream_title\ndisplay dialog stream_title & \" copied to clipboard.\" -- delete line to omit dialog\n\nTo install it as iTunes script, copy & paste the above into the AppleScript Editor and save it under Library/iTunes/Scripts in your home folder, giving it a sensible name, such as Copy Stream Title to Clipboard. Create the Scripts folder if it doesn't exist. This will make iTunes grow a little script icon in it's menu bar where you can select the script.\n\n\nA: I often take a screenshot of iTunes when it is displaying the relevant information. It's not the direct workflow you're asking for, but it's simple to do (Cmd-Shift-4, then press space, to take a screenshot of a specific window, if you're talking about OS X here) and the info becomes hard to lose.\n", "Q: Can I use the same iTunes account on all my devices? I've heard a lot of conflicting information about how many devices/computers can share an iTunes account.  What are the actual limits, and are devices distinguished from computers?\nMy current configuration is (all using the same iTunes account):\n\n\n*\n\n*One Windows computer with iTunes\n\n*One iPad\n\n*One iPhone\n\n*One Apple TV\n\n\nI want to add:\n\n\n*\n\n*Another, separate Windows account (on the same computer), that will use a separate install of iTunes\n\n*Two more iPhones\n\n*Another iPad\n\n\nI'd like everything to share the same iTunes account - is this possible?\n\nA: This is what the official Apple documentation says:\n\nYour Apple ID can have up to 10 devices and computers (combined)\nassociated with it. Each computer must also be authorized using the\nsame Apple ID. Once a device or computer is associated with your Apple\nID, you cannot associate that device or computer with another Apple ID\nfor 90 days. You can view which devices or computers are currently\nassociated, remove unused devices or computers, and see how long\nbefore they can be associated with a different Apple ID from the\nAccount Information page in iTunes on your computer.\nLast Modified: November 14, 2011\n\n\nA: Yes. You can set up the same itunes account for all devices\n\nA: There is a limit of 10 devices. And I can confirm everything is working well with 10 devices! (2 iPhones, 3 iPads, 2 PC, 2 Macs and 1 AppleTV)\n\nA: Yes, you can. And if you have iTunes Match you have your Music on all these Devices. I love it.\n", "Q: Why won't my Mac Pro wake from sleep at the scheduled time? I have a 2007 Mac Pro (running Lion) that has been on the same schedule for a long time;  it is set to go to sleep at 1am, and wake up at 7am.  Recently, it sleeps through its wakeup time.  If I press any key or anything, it wakes up immediately - and I notice the clock is off (it quickly corrects itself).  It is as if when it is asleep, it is no longer keeping time, and doesn't know when to wake up.  Could this be a dead button-battery inside?  I thought these were only used if no AC power was present (it always has power).\n\nA: Try resetting the System Management Unit (SMU); the SMU is typically responsible for tracking when your Mac is scheduled to wake up.\nWith regard to your Mac Pro appearing not to keep time, this is not a problem. It is expected behaviour for the menu bar clock to update a few seconds after your Mac has woken up.\nThe process controlling the clock needs to get a change in time notification before updating; it will not match your Mac's internal clock immediately upon waking up.\n", "Q: Moved my time machine backup drive to another computer, can see it but won't recognise old backups I've been using an external hard drive on my MacBook for time machine for a year or so. Now I have a Mac Mini too and have connected the external hard drive to that for the same purpose.\nI want to leave it connected to my Mac Mini and still backup to it wirelessly from my laptop.\nI have done all the steps to allow time machine to recognise network drives and I can see the drive from my laptop etc., but it won't recognise the old backups. \nDo I need to change the file permissions or similar to get it working?\n\nA: Just Just go into System Preferences … Time Machine and hit Select Disk… \n(If that's not working, let us know what error you're getting/what does happen.)\n", "Q: ssh/terminal tricks with iPhone I have a lovely jailbroken iPhone 4. Works fine. Very much enjoying being able to ssh into the device, but I can't help feeling I'm missing a few tricks with the ssh, would anyone be able to point me in the direction of where I might be able to do cool things? I'm interested to know if I can, for example:\nHave the iPhone play music or make a noise via ssh command - would help when I know I've left it around the house somewhere...\nSimulate a touch of the screen? (similar to, say, how Java's Robot package works on a desktop) Would be quite cool for executing macro commands...\nSend an sms remotely (wishing now)\nAny ideas? Anyone know if things like this are possible over ssh?\n\nA: This will restart springboard:\nkillall -HUP SpringBoard\n\nNot very useful unless you want to annoy your signifigant other.\n\nA: If you want to remotely control the iPhone you should probably use vnc instead. Veency on a jailbroken phone will allow you to control the phone. \n\nA: So from some general playing I've found the 'open' command on cydia, which let's you remotely open an app, not massively useful just yet. And I'm also using the 'speech' app that lets you trigger the speech synethsis from terminal - works over ssh and when phone is locked so quite useful for finding phone when lost in room somewhere...\n", "Q: OS X Lion suppresses user's settings for the keyboard backlight Recently I've upgraded to Lion and in general I'm not satisfied with its performance, but what's really annoying is that the login screen always sets the keyboard backlight to the max (even when I set it to zero, after re-entering login screen, it's back to the max level).\nThat's not quite bad, however that maximum level of the keyboard backlight suppresses my setting (zero highlighting) when I log in. So when I log in, the keyboard backlight is still very bright, as it was at the login screen, I press F5 to discover that OS thinks the keyboard backlight is off. Pressing F6 brings the backlight down to 1st level, so pressing F5 again, turns the keyboard backlight off.\nIt was persistent at 10.7 and continues to be so for 10.7.2.\nUPDATE: since some time I didn't see it. I'm running 10.8.4.\n\nA: I don't know if it's Lion or a hardware feature, but on my MacBook Air, the system changes the keyboard lighting (and screen brightness) depending on the ambient brightness, which is detected by a sensor near the iSight lens at the top of the screen. In bright surroundings, the keyboard lighting is disabled and pressing F5 or F6 does nothing.\n", "Q: How should different sized RAM be added to iMac? I have a mid-2011 iMac which came with 4GB RAM (2x2GB). I just bought 8 GB (2x4GB) and added it to get a total of 12GB. The current configuration is as follows:\n\nGiven that the RAM is a different size, do I have the optimal locations for the different RAM chips? At the moment what I did was to simply add the 2 new sticks of RAM in the two empty slots.\n\nA: I'm going to take WAGuess* and suggest that any gains (realized or not realized) due to memory-size matching will pale to insignificance beside the gains due to tripling your memory.  My rule of thumb for processor speed is that our perceptions tend to be more logarithmic than linear and that we don't really notice a speed increase until it is 50% - 100% greater than what we had before.\nIf you're in a situation where a few - consistently acheived - percentage points matter, such as frequently or perpetually running long, compute-bound jobs, and and where finishing a job a few minutes earlier might have a significant benefit for someone, then there may be an advantage to optimizing your memory placements.  Otherwise enjoy the speed of you newly augmented machine!  You've already got 99++% of the benefits to be had.\n'*' That guess isn't completely WA'd: I've already looked into using mis-matched memory sizes on two of my older Macs, and the above is what I concluded from at the time.\n\nA: That configuration should be perfectly fine. You can consult Apple's support documentation to be sure, but as long as your top two slots are filled using the original factory RAM and you installed the new RAM into the bottom slots (and you're using the right kind of RAM, of course) then your configuration should be OK.\nDon't forget to run memtest!\n\nA: If a specific model of a Mac has preference to installing RAM in certain slots before others, or gets a speed boost by matching pairs, the installation manual (and sometimes printed on the mac itself) will have a section explaining the order preference.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201191\nAll the newest iMacs that have empty slots put the memory in pairs matching left / right so as long as you added your pair left / right but either deeper or shallower from the front glass, you should be set for optimal speeds. I've tried installing it the other way and couldn't measure any differences in speed with several benchmarks. Having more RAM total is always faster than less (after the first memory test POST completes) and usually easily measured when switching apps repeatedly.\n", "Q: Why is Java consuming 100% CPU on my machine? I have an iMac (early 2010) running 10.7.2 but the problem has been seen on 10.6.x also. The symptom is simple, one of my 2 cores is sitting at 100% utilization with the Java process responsible  for the excessive usage. \nWhat have I done to troubleshoot?\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot - The java process simply restarts and the same condition is seen.\n\n*Kill the Java process - As with a reboot.\n\n*Uninstall and reinstall Java - Soon after installing Java the CPU is back at 100%.\n\n*Using ps \"process id\" I can see that it is launchd spawning the process and that the command used to start the process is:\njava -Djava.awt.headless=true -jar /tmp/ics29586\n\n\n*The ics29586 file is an 11mb binary file.\n\n*Deleted the ics29586 file - File is recreated at next process restart and same condition is seen\n\n*Created a new user account, rebooted and logged in as the new user - Same condition is seen.\n\n*Played with Java settings and restarted the process after each change - Same condition seen.\n\n*Complete machine rebuild - Soon after installing Java the CPU is back at 100%.\n\n\nSo, has anyone either got the the answer for what is causing it and how to fix it, or some advice on ways of further troubleshooting the issue?\n\nIn response to some of the comments asking for more info:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm not running crashplan.\n\n*I couldn't work out how to get Activity Monitor to show me open files, but googling suggested LSOF was a good match for what you wanted to know.

By way of a test I have renamed the com.microsoft file to old.com.microsoft but it made no difference. I also moved the file completely out the LaunchDaemons directory and that made no difference either, the process still respawns, hangs around not doing much for a few minutes, then goes out of control and consumes all the CPU on 1 core.\n\nA: I don't know either, but here's how to find out more\nIn cases of entirely unknown binaries, strings(1) is often helpful in getting a hint about what the file might be\nstrings /tmp/ics29586 | less\n\nHave a look through the output and see if it's anything familiar.\nFailing that, find out which launchd job it is being launched from:\nlaunchctl list|awk '{id=$3; print \"### \" id; system(\"launchctl list \" id)}'|awk '/^###/ {id=$2} /.*ics29586.*/ {print id}'\n\nThis should output one or more job tags in the form of (for example) com.apple.scrod (and a few errors, which you can ignore).\nOnce you have the job tag(s), get the launchd config for a job by running:\nlaunchctl list com.apple.scrod    # insert your tag instead\n\nThis (and the tag itself, which often contains an internet domain name in reverse notation) should give you some more information about what this process is. Feel free to post it here if you need further help.\nUpdate: Forgot to mention this, but since it's a jar file, you can copy it somewhere and unzip it (jar files are really just zip files) and have a look at what sort of Java classes are in there.\n\nA: If you drop into terminal, you can type ps -ef | grep java\nYou'll see all the processes with \"java\" in their descriptions and details on the process which launched each of them.\nIn my case, CrashPlan is doing a restore and the client app is Java-based.

I run Lion and Windows 7 on a MacBook, using Boot Camp and Parallels. Both operating systems are set to the same time zone and, presumably, use the same clock.\nFor some reason Windows 7 insists on being one hour wrong when running on the iron. Running as a VM under Lion Windows displays the same time as Lion.\nIs this an issue of checking whether one of the OS thinks that it the hardware clock is set to GMT (I am one hour away from GMT)? Where would I find the setting?\n\nA: The OSes interpret the system's clock data differently - this has been an issue as long as Boot Camp has been available.\nYou might want to add a crontab to use ntpdate to update (-u) from your preferred NTP server, such as time.apple.com.\n", "Q: How do I add drop shadow to text in iMovie? I am trying to add a drop shadow effect to text in iMovie. The problem I'm encountering is that there doesn't appear to be a drop shadow setting and the effect is applied seemingly at random. All the sites I have found online refer to this as the outline effect, but it is a separate effect entirely. I have yet to find reference to how to manipulate the drop shadow on text in iMovie.\nFor example, here is what text looks like when using the \"lower third\" text template. It appears without a drop shadow, with no means of adding it. This is the type of text I want to add drop shadow to.\n\nAnd here is text created using the \"scrolling credits\" text template. It appears with drop shadow, but if you edit the preset text it may or may not retain the drop shadow.\n\nWhere is the control for drop shadow?\n\nA: This YouTube video shows that widening the font panel reveals four controls at the top for drop shadows (opacity, blur, offset, and angle). So they're right there in the font picker window when you're manipulating your text:\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Create a title using the \"Scrolling Credits\" template, which almost always creates text with drop shadow\n\n*Type in your text\n\n*Double click on the title, causing the \"inspector\" menu to pop up\n\n*Manually change the template from \"Scrolling Credits\" to \"lower third\" or whatever other template you want\n\n\nVery roundabout and inefficient, but it worked.\n", "Q: Export Apple symbol font glyph to image I am trying to add an apple symbol to an iPhone app I am writing.

I'm interested in possibly upgrading my MacBook Pro's wireless card. Is this possible? Can I take apart the MacBook and install it? Is there a guide somewhere on how to do this? \n(This isn't because of wireless performance, just lack of stable driver support on Linux.) \n\nA: Probably not, but you can use the ExpressCard slot instead\nThe model you mentioned (17\" MacBookPro8,3 late 2011) does seem to have a separate Wifi/bluetooth assembly, but you'll probably have a very hard time finding a matching replacement in both size and connection. I didn't find a disassembled 17\" model, but the card in the 15\" of the same generation looks like this (4 antenna connectors and what is probably some sort of PCI Express cable).\nHowever, since yours is a 17\", it does have an ExpressCard slot, where you can stick in a Wifi card of your choosing (something like this) without even having to take the whole machine apart.\nOr patch around your Linux kernel with one of the BCM4331 drivers that are out there, but I assume you've already tried that.\n\nA: The MacBook Pro model you mentioned does have a separate AirPort/Bluetooth card, however, this cannot be changed to a different model.\nI'd do what other people have suggested and make use of your ExpressCard slot.\n", "Q: Why am I unable to log-in to Apple sites with my Mac mini?

It seems to be something about this machine; but I'm just not sure what files or apps or system prefs to investigate. He can log-in to Amazon and Google accounts as usual, just not Apple sites.\n\nA: If the computer is used the most likely cause is previous user's settings. It is worth purging all cookies as a start and, if this doesn't work, erasing the browsers entirely and reinstalling from scratch, and if this fails erase the drive and reinstall everything from scratch.\nThe only way a problem could possibly persist after this is if professional apple sites tie logins to the hardware ID of a specific computer.\n\nA: Actually fixed after switching from wireless to ethernet.

I have iCloud backup enabled, with the option for camera roll turned on, so therefore the picture I deleted should have a backup in iCloud.\nHowever...how do I actually restore it? I don't see any way to browse past backups from either my iPhone or iCloud.com.\nIs the backup simply used for restoring entire devices? Any way I can just pull a single file out of it?\n\nA: Apple provides no interface to pull individual items from the backup. Whether through iTunes or iCloud, backups are intended to be restored as a whole, replacing the content on the device at the time of the restore.  \nIs it possible that the image is also in your Photo Stream? That's probably the best possible solution if you do not wish to go through the steps to restore the backup to a device (your device or another one) to retrieve the photos you are missing (and then restore things again from a more current backup if desired).\nIf you do need to restore the whole backup, erase the phone (Settings -> General -> Reset -> Erase All Content and Settings) then you can restore from iCloud.  When restoring from iCloud, you can choose from multiple recent backups.\n\nA: I do not believe there is a solution other than a full backup which really is not too much. Camera roll only really works for a picture to sync across numerous devices, with or without it enabled once your IPhone/iPad what have you starts to backup the WHOLE device will backup pics included. So if you have camera roll turned on other devices like an iPad or iMac etc then go to them a you have the pic/s. Another issue is the device will auto backup if on wifi automatically once plugged in which will overwrite your previous backups which would mean the pic is gone since a backup took place AFTER the pic was erased. \n", "Q: How can I move through words when typing a command in iTerm2?

I mean Disk Utility can see that there's supposed to be a volume there (HFS+/Journaled) but cannot mount it. Using the Repair function leaves me with two error messages after 3 hours: \"Incorrect Number of Thread Records\" and \"Invalid Node Structure\".

This is incompatible with iPad so is there an alternative, where can I get it, and how much does it cost?\n\nA: There is no app in iOS or the App Store that will allow you to see Flash-only or Flash-heavy websites. Having said that, websites all around are slowly switching to using alternatives to Flash that are iPad-compatible, so you should run into this problem less and less as times goes by. Hope this helps. \n\nA: Try Puffin Web Browser. It is designed for Flash,and I play Flash games in it.\n\nA: I have to disagree with Christian's answer.  There is an app in the iOS app store called iSwifter. From the description of the app:\n\niSwifter Flash Browser unlocks your favorite Flash content on your iPad, letting you view videos, Flash websites, and best of all, interactive Flash applications...\n\nI've used it and it works as advertised. However, it only works with the iPad. Also, the app is free, but there is a 10 (?) hour limit and after the 10 hours is up, you have to buy the \"pro version\" for $4.99.\nAnother app is Skyfire, which allows you:\n\nto gain access to Flash video on their mobile devices! (*Skyfire Does NOT support Flash Websites, Apps or Games - Just tons of great Flash videos across the web!)\n\nI have not used Skyfire, so I don't really know exactly how it works. However, it does provide some level of support for viewing Flash content on an iOS device.\n\nA: You could try iSwifter (https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/iswifter-games-browser-play/id388857173?mt=8) - its free for 7 days so you can see if it works well for your needs.  It works like a number of other 'Flash-Enabled' browsers on iOS by using a cloud virtual machine to do the rendering of Flash objects and then passing this to the iOS device in a 'VNC-like' way.  It's never going to be as good as using a native flash plugin on a compatible machine, but if the iPad is your only choice, this should work for you.\n", "Q: Is there a forward delete on the iPad? Using the screen keyboard on iPad, is their a way to delete the character after the cursor?  That is, behavior like the Windows delete key?  \nI am aware that the convention is to use Fn+delete on Macs.  If there is no such convention on iPad, it might be nice to use shift+delete.\n\nA: Sorry, but no.  This only works on the iPad if you are using an external Bluetooth keyboard.  \n\nA: Yes I found it! it is control + K.\nYou can find additional iPad shortcuts on the web, e.g. https://www.tomsguide.com/us/ipad-shortcuts,news-18205.html\n\nA: The app Textkraft has a forward-delete key.\n", "Q: How do iOS devices handle music storage when iTunes Match is enabled? I have an iPhone 3GS 32GB which was packed to the brim with music. Yesterday I signed up for iTunes Match, and I noticed that the Music section of the device settings in iTunes (which used to allow me to select which playlists/songs/genres/artists I wanted synced) has been replaced with this:\n\niTunes also says my phone has 22.6 GB of free space, despite most of the bar appearing full.\n\nHow does my iPhone manage its free space when the device fills up? Will downloaded music automatically be removed when something else needs it, like an app installation or a new podcast? If so, how does it decide what to remove? Or, will I have to manually remove songs one by one if I decide to install all 782 MB of Rage HD again?\n\nA: Some research led to this article from AllThingsD about how an Apple rep had confirmed that the service does indeed stream the music, but it also saves to the device, thus taking up storage space.  It starts playing before it finishes downloading, but it does actually download and save.\nMacRumors and a video from InsanelyGreatMac are somewhat unclear about this, but MacWorld agrees that on an iOS device, it's downloading (scroll down to \"Playing iTunes Match songs on your Mac and on iOS\").\nUPDATE as per comment:\nAs of iOS 5, the device will delete cached data from apps when it's low on space.  This caused some controversy at first because apps had no way to prevent cached data from being removed automatically.  In the linked article, Marco Arment provides an example:\n\nA common scenario: an Instapaper customer is stocking up an iPad for a\n  long flight. She syncs a bunch of movies and podcasts, downloads some\n  magazines, and buys a few new games, leaving very little free space.\n  Right before boarding, she remembers to download the newest issue of\n  The Economist. (I think highly of my customers.) This causes free\n  space to fall below the threshold that triggers the cleaner, which —\n  in the background, unbeknownst to her — deletes everything that was\n  saved in Instapaper. Later in the flight, with no internet\n  connectivity, she goes to launch Instapaper and finds it completely\n  empty.\n\nThis was fixed in iOS 5.0.1 (Apple Developer documentation) so that developers can differentiate between cached data that is and isn't important.\nSo, the short version: Once free space gets below a certain level, the device will regain whatever space it can by removing cached data from installed apps.  If it can't do that, or if you're completely out of space, it'll probably just tell you that you don't have enough space to do what you're trying to do.\n\nA: Last week iTunes Match deleted almost every song that I have on my iPhone leaving just 10 songs on the device. The reason may be that while I updated several large Apps, it had not enough space to store the updates and the original App, so it cleaned up the memory which also includes the iPod Library :/\n\nA: From what I've heard from some developers, it deletes the oldest least played music first. This obviously makes sense. And if your apps need more space they get priority over music. But it's not one of those things I worry about. My iPhone has plenty of space for apps and if music gets deleted the playcount and ratings are preserved in the cloud so I don't worry about it.\n\nA: If you want to delete all the music from your iPhone to free up space: Settings>General>Usage and wait for Music to show up under Storage. Click on Music and then Edit from the top right, click the red slash on the left and Delete shows up. Click to delete and all your music files will be deleted from your iPhone.\n", "Q: Can I install TextMate 2 and keep TextMate 1? I would like to try TextMate's new version but since it is a beta release with some bugs and unfinished features, I don't want to use it everyday. Is there any way to install TextMate 2 and keep Textmate 1? \n\nA: No need to use /Applications or ~/Applications, you can put text mate 2 in any folder you wish. \nFor example if you have Textmate in /Applications/Textmate.app, create a folder in /Applications/TM2/Textmate2.app \n\nA: Put TextMate 2 in ~/Applications and Textmate 1 in /Applications then. As I remember, they use the different folders in App Support\n", "Q: iPhone iOS crash Today my iPhone shut off instantly as I pressed the sleep/wake button to wake its screen; the phone was on. There was no spinning animation as it shut down. I briefly saw the screen flash to the \"locked\" view before it went black.\nWhen I restarted the phone it indicated that I had 42% battery remaining.\nAt the time of the \"crash\", I was near the finish of a 2.5 mile run, and I was running a development build of iMapMyFitness. It was relatively cold outside -- probably between 30 and 40 degrees F.\nI downloaded an app called System Log, and it shows the following two diagnostics with timestamps just before the crash.

Wakeup times on the order of 30 seconds or more. Note that the computer is incredibly sluggish or beach balling during this time (not like dark) and takes 30 seconds or so to get going. Obviously this is an SSD with a cleanly installed 10.7 OS from the factory. I have tried restarting, clearing the sleep image, and updating to the latest software but am not sure how to proceed at this point. I am completely up-to-date with all software in Software Update. I am only running a web browser (Chrome) with a reasonable number of tabs open along Mail.app and a few other small programs like TextEdit.\nIdeas? Any suggestions would be appreciated!\n\nA: This might be because your system enters \"standby mode\", where it actually saves all your data to disk and turns off. When you start up, it restores everything. 30 seconds is NOT normal though. However, a fix that you might want to consider is to disable this functionality:\nsudo pmset -a standby 0\n\nThe result will be that your MBA should no longer enter \"standby mode\" anymore and sleep like any other MacBook. It will consume battery power while sleeping, but should wake up instantly.\n\nA: *\n\n*Uncheck the box when the shut-down window appears: Reopen\nwindows when...\n\n*Clear all Caches (/username/Library/Caches)\n\n*Delete Apps which want to start at Login (/username/Library/LaunchAgents)\n\n\nIt could be a updater from an app which want to connect immediately to the internet.\n", "Q: How can I disable an Apple laptop's touchpad button (physical click)? I really want to find a way to disable the Apple touchpad physical tap button. My wife does not make use of the software tap functionality that I enabled. She sits next to me every night clicking away. This is very annoying when it goes on for several hours.\nThere has to be a way to catch / trap the input from the device.\n\nA: You can configure it using BetterTouchTool. But I'd advice against pissing your wife off.\nThere's always option of buying an iPad.\n\nA: The trackpad click is a hardware thing: it's not added in software, so it cannot be trapped or otherwise blocked. (And, yes, they are awfully loud.) The only way to do what you want would be to disassemble the laptop and try to add some muffling around the trackpad mechanism.\nPersonally, I find tap-to-click infuriating and unusable, so I, too, would use the physical (clicky) buttons, no matter how loud they are. \n", "Q: Is there a way to hide songs in iTunes Christmas is over, and now there is a lot of Christmas music on my Mac. Is there a way to disable or hide a genre or a category, rather than individual songs, from iTunes.\nBasically I don't want these to play at anytime, when shuffling, using genius or when playing down the alphabetical list.\n\nA: You can simply uncheck the Checkbox next to the track.\n\n\nIf unchecked, the song will never played!\n\nAnother Soultion:\nCreate just two different iTunes Librarys. One with Christmas songs, and another for the rest of the year. When it's christmas time, open iTunes and hold down the [alt]-key, to choose the other library!\nThere isn't any function to hide songs in iTunes. But you have great other options:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Unselect the songs you don't want to hear\n  \n*Make a iTunes-Christmas-Library \n  \n*Create smart playlists\n  \n\n\nA: Checkboxes are universal, meaning that unchecking them in the library but checking them in a playlist can't happen. A song's box will all be checked or unchecked at a given time. However, this does let you make the act of checking/unchecking simple.\nIf you have a Christmas playlist, or some sort of grouping in iTunes that has all the music you don't care about them, browse to that playlist, select all the tracks (cmda, right-click -> select all, however you wish to go about it), and then right click one of the tracks and click 'Uncheck Selection'.\nMassive amounts of tracks instantly unchecked and will not be considered for Genius, iTunes DJ, syncing, anything.\n\nA: Complementing previous answers.\nSome views do not have checkboxes or they could be hidden.\nJust right click the track and select \"Uncheck selection\".\n\n", "Q: What is the Documents & Data item used for in the iCloud preference pane on my Mac? I am seeing an item called \"Documents and Data\" in the iCloud preference pane. I have switched it on, but what can I expect from it? I have searched the web about iCloud, syncing between Mac and iOS devices and how iWork relates to all of this, and I don't like what I see.\nQuestion:\nCan anyone tell me what happens when I switch on/off Documents and Data syncing on my mac?\nI know that there is a folder ~/Library/Mobile Documents that contains the actual documents and data, that I can muck around in there, use it like a Drop Box, that any iWork documents I put in there get mutilated beyond belief when opened by the corresponding iOS iWork app, and that Apple does not offer support on this matter, but most iCloud users owning a Mac don't, so let me rephrase:\nWhat awesome and easy to use iCloud sync feature becomes available to me when I switch on that particular item in the iCloud preference pane on my Mac?\nIf the answer really is \"None\", I'll accept it. I just would like to make sure I haven't missed anything.\nThank you.\n\nA: Well, at the moment, there isn't much to see with that option.  However, enabling Documents and Data sync allows applications on your Mac to sync their data with iCloud, just like iWork on iOS does.  But, most Mac applications have not been updated to support this feature yet (even Apple's iWork suite doesn't support this yet).  However, this does allow applications to sync with any other Macs and iOS devices that you own, so I recommend leaving it on so you are prepared for app updates that support iCloud.  iA Writer is an example of an application that already uses iCloud to sync between both Macs and iOS devices.\n", "Q: Thunderbolt Target Display Mode, iMac still running?

I have various players that play videos from websites, I want to know where those videos are cached.\nBecause it's AIR, I suppose it's caching in a particular place, but I can't find it.\n\nA: In Mac OS X, all applications store theire cache files in one place:\n\n/Users/yourusername/Library/Caches\n\nThere you can find the Adobe caches, and Adobe Air cache files.\n", "Q: MacBook Air has suddenly become very slow at booting and shutdown I have a Late 2010 MacBook Air, and it has a 256 GB SSD, 2.13 GHz processor, and 4 GB RAM. It has been lightning fast ever since I bought it and I upgraded to OS X Lion and it was super fast. Boot time was 10-12 seconds (time to get to login screen), shut down time was 3 seconds.\nDuring the last couple of months, my MacBook Air seems to be have slowed down regarding boot time and shut down time. Current boot time is 50-60 seconds, and shutdown time is 10-15 seconds.\nI do not know the reason for this. Applications don't seem to have much lag though. It is my boot time that is a MAJOR problem!\nI recently cleared a lot of useless memory on my computer and emptied the trash, and cleared the cache memory (with an app), and computer has a LOT of free space and no applications are loaded on start-up either. \nCan anyone tell me how to get back the original boot time performance?\n\nA: Issue: After entering the password the computer would appear to freeze and become unresponsive. After about 20 mins it would eventually log in. User was claiming that browsing the internet was very slow and he could only access one page at a time.\nResolution: I had unbound the mac from the Active Directory domain and it fixed the issue. As it turns out the computer name had been removed from the AD Computers list.\n\nA: Try Resetting PRAM and NVRAM\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the computer.\n\n\n*Locate the following keys on the keyboard: ⌥+⌘+P+R.

You must press this key combination before the gray screen appears.\n\n\n*Hold the keys down until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for the second time.\n\n\n*Release the keys.\n\n\n*Set the startup disk in system preferences and reboot again to test the timing.\n\nA: Check your network configuration.\nDelete any interfaces that you don't need.  If you have IPv4 configured manually, make sure your IP address and DNS servers are correct.  Run Console.app and check your system log for problems during boot up. \nAs an experiment, create a new Location called \"None\" with all networking disabled (delete all of the interfaces), select that and then reboot.  If it boots faster with networking disabled, then you know something is wrong with your network settings.\n\nA: Also, you could try verifying the disk.\nOpen Disk Utility. Click on Macintosh HD in the sidebar. Then click Verify Disk. If there are any errors then click Repair Disk.\nThen you might want to also try clicking Verify Disk Permissions and then Repair Disk Permissions\nIf after doing all this and there is no improvement try backing up your folders and files and doing a clean install. In other-words, completely erasing the whole hard drive and re-installing the operating system from the install disk.\n\nA: The easiest step to take would be to install a clean OS onto an external USB drive so you can assure yourself the hardware is working properly. Yes the internal drive is way faster (when working properly) than an external, but a clean install to even a slow bus powered 2.5 inch drive should be far faster than your benchmark.\nIf that is as slow or slower than your timings - have it repaired. If not, you can back up and zero the SSD. Hopefully your drive and OS support TRIM and at will allow the controller to mark the entire drive as clean again. Also, this will ensure you don't have a software delay. \nOnce you are sure the hardware is speedy again, restore your backup. \n", "Q: List of (activated) fonts with shell command in os x Is there any shell command for getting a list of activated fonts?

So, if you look at these files, you can look at these files and base your Terminal commands after these.\nThese are XML-based files, so you can view them in a more readable format if you open them in Xcode, which is available in the Mac App Store.  \nIn the Terminal, the format for these is \"defaults write PLIST_FILE KEY -TYPE VALUE\"\nwhere the PLIST_FILE is the name of the file in the Preferences folder without the .plist, KEY is the key that you can see in Xcode, -TYPE is the type of key that you can find Xcode (and you can find if there is an abbreviation for that type by typing \"defaults\" into the terminal), and value is the value you wish to set the key at.\nHere are some of the string types from the Terminal:\n-string <string_value>\n-data <hex_digits>\n-int[eger] <integer_value>\n-float  <floating-point_value>\n-bool[ean] (true | false | yes | no)\n-date <date_rep>\n-array <value1> <value2> ...\n-array-add <value1> <value2> ...\n-dict <key1> <value1> <key2> <value2> ...\n-dict-add <key1> <value1> ...\n\n\nA: Per Nathan's answer, they simply modify features built into software though not necessarily obviously exposed or otherwise documented. Your example of the iTunes notifications is a great one, because there are no 'iTunes Playback Notification' options to speak of, but the fact that the feature exists and can be enabled means that someone inside of Apple was working on such a system.\nRelated, though not at all actually answering the question, check out Secrets. The site can be used to simply look up preference modification commands, but they also offer a downloadable Preference Pane that after installation you access via System Preferences, and offers a very friendly way to enter these commands instead of via the Terminal.\nThe always important caveat is doing this can enable potentially unstable or otherwise system altering functions.

I'm using OSX 10.6.8, and when searching on finder, it doesn't let me sort files by size, is there a way to do this?\n\nA: This should do it:\nAdd columns to Spotlight search results\nQuote:\n\nUsing Property List Editor\nIf you are using Property List Editor, start by going to your user folder and then navigate to Library/Preferences. In the Preferences folder find the file named “com.apple.finder.plist.” Double-clicking on this file should open it up in Property List Editor. If not, just right-click on it and choose “Open With - Property List Editor.”\nOnce the file is open, scroll down the list to “SearchViewSettings.” Click the disclosure triangle next to it, and then do the same for “ListViewSettings” and then “columns.” Now you should see a list of all the available columns. Click the triangle next to the column you want to add, i.e. size, and then check the box next to “visible.”\n\n\n\nOnce you are done, save the file by pressing Command-S. Finally, you will need to restart the Finder for the changes to take effect. The easiest way to do this is top hold down the Control and Option keys, click on the Finder icon in the Dock and choose “Relaunch.”\nNow just press Command-F to bring up a search window and you should have your extra columns enabled.\n\n\nA: \n\nA: *\n\n*Start by going to Users/Library/Preferences. \n\n*In the Preferences folder, find the file named “com.apple.finder.plist.\n\n*Trash this file by highlighting it and hitting the \"Command\" and \"Delete\" keys.\n\n*Hit the \"Command/Option/Escape\" keys, and then relaunch the Finder in \"Force Quit Applications\".\n\n*All your greyed-out problems should now be eliminated.\n\n", "Q: How do I delete an iCloud backup? I just got a new iPad2 (upgraded from an iPad1) today and I was going to do an iCloud backup, but it says there is no more data for me to use.\nI want to either download all the data from my original iPad onto my new iPad and then delete the old iCloud backup, but I can't find anywhere to do that. The cloud is recognizing the devices seperatly. I can't even just delete the iPad1 backup to do a brand new backup, the system (on my iPad2, iPhone and Mac) all say \"Could not delete this backup at this time, try again later\"...\nIs this even possible to download my iPad1 backup onto my iPad2?\n\nA: *\n\n*Tap Settings and then tap the iCloud icon.\n\n*Tap \"Storage & Backup.\"\n\n*Tap Manage Storage.\n\n*Tap your iOS device in the Backups area.\n\n*Under Backup Options, turn off any items that you no longer wish to back up.\n\n*Return to Storage & Backup and tap “Back up now.” This will immediately remove the requested backup data from iCloud.\n\n*Choose “Delete Backup” if you want to turn off Backup and remove all data for that Backup from iCloud.\n(via support.apple.com)\n\nA: In addition to @gentmatt's answer, if you're backup won't delete, it could be because of a restore-block. I found this by speaking with a senior apple advisor on the phone:\n\nOnce an iCloud backup restore has been activated for a device, a\n  restore-block is placed on the backup for 48 hours. During this time,\n  the backup cannot be deleted.\n\n", "Q: What is the difference in resolution and quality between SCART, VGA, and HDMI? For my old MacBook (2,1) I have a mini-DVI to Video adapter that I use to connect to the TV (mini-DVI-to-Composite-to-SCART). It works, but I cannot seem to get the right resolution for the TV display (no wide screen resolutions available at all).\nI see there are other options to connect to as well on the TV: VGA and HDMI. How do each of these options perform differently in terms of resolution and quality?\nFor example, I'm planning to buy a HDMI adapter and would like to understand if this will make it possible to use a wide resolution for the TV from the MacBook.\nI'd be very happy if someone can give a detailed explanation what resolutions and qualities each port is capable of.\n\nA: First: The maximum resolution of your TV is important. Your TV have probably a resolution of 1920 * 1080 Pixel (FullHD).\n\nA (Mini) Display Port can display about 3840×2400 Pixel\nVGA is an older standard, an was created for an Analog connection\n  between devices.\n  HDMI was created for a Digital connection.\n\nSo, the HDMI option is the best, because HDMI fully supports FullHD resolution. \nVGA could probably be display FullHD or HD Ready (1280x720 Pixel), but it's not recommended.\nSo, the best decision is to buy an Mini Display Port - to - HDMI Adapter.\nIt is hard to give a detailed information of the cababilities of each Video-Output, because there are many differnt version of each one out there. \n\nA: Just be aware HDMI for displaying videos is fine, but for reading text on a website or working is very bitty and in my personal opinion not usable for long period of time. \nI would use VGA. Thats what most TVs have. You're not going to get the best quality video e.g. HD, etc. but will be a lot better for reading text.\nUnless your TV has DVI, I would use that but I doubt it.\n", "Q: Language setting for spell-check in Pages I'm new to Pages (from iWork) and have troubles with the spell-check function.

Currently using rEFIt bootloader chooser or whatever it is called, from what I understand it is not a bootloader itself but selects the bootloader for the OS you choose to boot from a list.\nThe four primary partitions are in use by OS X, OS X recovery, BOOTCAMP (Windows 7) and EFI is the fourth. I believe \"GUID_partition_scheme\" is just the disk label for the entire drive. The drive is a 256GB SSD but size or type of the HD doesn't appear to be an issue in this situation.\nHere is the output of the command 'diskutil list':  \ndiskutil list\n/dev/disk0\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            125.1 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                125.1 GB   disk0s4\n\nIs my only option to delete 'Apple_Boot Recovery HD' or can I move and make it (or the EFI partition) into non-primary partition? Of course this will have to happen after resizing the drive to make room for the third primary partition.\nI'm fairly new to Apple but I'm OK with partitioning if I knew what to do.\n\nA: You're getting confused between the MBR and GPT partitioning schemes. Intel Macs generally use GPT, but for Boot Camp, they also add a so-called Hybrid MBR for booting Windows, which duplicates all or some of the partition entries. GPT can have a large number of partitions (typically, enough space is reserved for 128 partitions), but as MBR only supports 4, if you have more than that, you can't represent all of them in the MBR. Note that one partition of the EFI type 0xEE is required - this normally covers the whole disk, but for hybrid MBR, it usually only covers the GPT itself and the 200MB EFI partition at the start of the disk. So that gives you 3 usable MBR partitions, which Windows will see.\nYou don't mention what your third OS should be for triple-boot; if it's another installation of OS X, you have nothing to worry about. Just install it as normal, it will use GPT entries 5+. If you want another BIOS-based OS, such as Windows or most Linux distros, you'll probably need to mess with the hybrid MBR yourself. I'd do all the partitioning in OSX's Disk Utility, as it will update both the GPT and MBR tables simultaneously. Just make the new Windows or Linux partition FAT32 to begin with. Then, if your MBR covers the Recovery HD but has no entry for your new partition, get the exact positions and sizes of the GPT partitions using\nsudo gpt -r disk0\n\nThis should list all 5 partitions.\nIn fdisk (or so), delete the MBR version of the Recovery HD, and create a new partition with the exact position and size of your new (5th) partition. Windows should now see this partition instead of the Recovery HD. You can change its type, format it, etc. as usual. Just don't try to resize it from fdisk or Windows Generally, make sure that all partitions that exist in the MBR except the 0xEE EFI partition map exactly onto a GPT partition.\nThis is all a bit dangerous so make sure you have backups of everything.\n", "Q: Apple Remote + Spotify? I have a 2010 MBP on Lion, and use Spotify pretty heavily - is there any way that I can have my remote control spotify, rather than it waking up iTunes every time (which would be fine but I don't have any playlists)?\nThanks!\n\nA: You could try SpotifyIrRemote which works on Lion.\n\nA: You could use an iOS Spotify remote instead.\nThere are a few options listed on Spotify's website\n\nA: Best way to do this is to use spotify itself, from an idevice (ipad, iphone) with spotify installed.

Under that bus, look through the Location IDs of each device; this field is \"Addr\" in the error logs. Note that location IDs are unique only across a bus, not the entire system.\nOnce you've identified the device, I would try swapping it to a new port, either with another device on the hub or to a blank port on said hub.  If the errors stay with the device and not the port, my next step would be to plug the device into a direct port or swap cables.  If you still have issues with the device, look for firmware updates to the device.\nIf after troubleshooting the hub is suspect - note that some people have found the power adapters that ship with some cheap USB hubs to be very poor, not capable of delivering anywhere near enough current.  http://hackaday.com/2012/01/06/running-the-numbers-on-a-cheap-psu/\nI would put the phone and garmin charger directly off the Mac's USB ports; among other things, your mac can supply twice as much current to your phone for charging.

Recently (post installation of Lion), it started to behave extremely sluggishly, so I used Activity Monitor to see what was using up the system resources.  Turns out that kernel_task is using 2.95 GB of RAM.  Not a typo: it's using ~3 GB of RAM.\nI use this Mac Mini as a home media server, connected to a TV and a Drobo.  In other words, beyond running iTunes, I don't really use it for much.  I don't have a ton of applications running, nor do I have any accessories other than the Drobo and the TV connected to it.\nWhat on earth could kernel_task possibly need 3 GB of RAM for, and how can I tell it to stop eating all my RAM and dragging my system to a screeching halt?\n\nA: In the past, I've experienced odd memory consumption issues after upgrading OS X, due to older kernel extensions that were still being loaded.  Some of the extensions were for applications that I was no longer using and had forgotten about.  You might try listing out all the non apple kernel extensions, then try unloading them one by one to see if you experience any improvement in memory consumption.  \nTo list what is loaded, type the following from a terminal shell:\nkextstat | grep -v com.apple\n\nSo, each of the kernel extensions, will have a corresponding kext file, located in the default /System/Library/Extensions/.  \nThen, to unload a kernel extension, type the following:\nsudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/<NAME_OF_KEXT_File.kext>\n\nIf you identify any extensions that are wonky, you then have a starting place to see if perhaps there is an updated version of the application that is more Lion friendly.  \n\nA: I'd recommend a clean install of Lion.

If only Saturday and Sunday are selected, it shows \"Weekends\".  \n", "Q: Time Machine, ZFS and deduplication I'm currently exporting a ZFS partition with dedup=on using ubuntu-zfs and netatalk. However, time-machine insists on creating a sparsebundle on it, and it made me start wondering if this would have any impact on deduplication, since the concept of \"files\" disappear, and probably the block alignment wouldn't be great either... \nP.S. My whole idea of using dedup is that I have a couple of macbooks backing up to the same place, and a lot of their files are equal. \n\nAddendum: It seems the block-level alignment is failing dedup. Here's my experience:\n\n\n*\n\n*Time-machine copies of two different macbooks, with lots of duplicated data among them (total 200Gb)\n\n*CCC the two macbooks to two sparse images.\n\n\nDeduplication factor? 1.01x\n\nAny ideas on how to set up ZFS dedup to correctly work with time-machine backups? Should I start looking for other backup (w/ dedup) alternatives?\n\nA: Deduplication on ZFS is block-level, so it doesn't depend on the concept of files. The only way the deduplication can be defeated is if the offset of a file within the sparsebundle is not always the same modulo the block size. Since ZFS can use variable block sizes that are larger than the block size of the HFS+ file system inside the sparsebundle, correct alignment isn't guaranteed, but neither is it guaranteed that deduplication will fail. \nIf you're worrying about space, you may also want to enable compression on your ZFS pool. It imposes extra CPU overhead, but can actually increase effective disk throughput. \n", "Q: Where does Lion Server store apps used for iOS deployment?

I have a disk image file containing multiple file systems, such as HFS (Journaled) in addition to Joliet or UDF.  I want to mount whatever non-HFS file system is there.

Is there any way to make this work, or must I know what specific file system I want to mount?\n(This motivation for this question involved building CDs for software distribution.  That might not be of interest here.  But people on StackOverflow suggested that there might be more expertise on the mount command on this site.)\n\nA: You should parse the output of hdiutil, and mount the filesystems you're interested in - because you can't do what you're trying to do with mount.\nThe first few lines of the man page show supported syntax:\n mount [-adfruvw] [-t lfs | external_type]\n mount [-dfruvw] special | node\n mount [-dfruvw] [-o options] [-t lfs | external_type] special node\n\nNotice for -a, there are no options to specify a node path, which makes your command invalid syntax.\n(Also, I'd suggest testing with a proper image file - one that is an actual CD image.  Your image is a hard-disk type, with an Apple Partition Map, and no non-HFS partitions.  In Disk Utility, choose New -> Blank Image and note all the selections carefully.  You want \"CD/DVD\"; you can then edit the partition map after you've created it; say, to change to two partitions.)\n", "Q: How to remove/reset mp3 from ipod?

If that doesn't work, try restoring it in iTunes. Plug it in and turn your iPod off, then hold the power and home buttons for eight seconds(a little bit after the screen turns black again) then release the power button but hold the home button for about seven seconds, or until iTunes recognizes it and tells you to restore it.

Indeed launchd doesn't even guarantee to an interval of exactly 600 seconds, just close.\nThe best way to do something similar is to get your launchd task to touch a file, preferably in /var/tmp\n\nA: It really depends on why you care (inherently, you shouldn't, or more likely, there's some better way to do it). It all comes down to your script being smarter.

For example, looking at a launchd job with the label \"com.apple.newsyslog\", which is set to run on the 30th minute of every hour, if I run\nlog show --last 24h --info | grep -i newsyslog,\nI see relevant entries such as:\n2022-07-07 16:30:00.068603-0400 ...

Rescheduling StartCalendarInterval: com.apple.newsyslog.268435460: Thursday, July 7, 2022 at 5:30:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time\n\nSo, from the log I can see when the job last ran, and when it is scheduled to run next.\n", "Q: Deleting a file from inside Lion’s Preview.app In Snow Leopard it was possible to delete (i.e. move to Trash) a file directly from inside Preview.app using the cmd + backspace combination. (The same combination which is used in Finder.)\nThis was especially useful for files which had been downloaded to ~/Downloads and were opened automatically. One could have a quick look and then immediately delete them afterwards.\nThe combination also worked for TextEdit as well as some other programs. Now with Lion this does not seem to work anymore. Is there a fix or a new combination for it?\n\nA: At present there is not a solution for this. It seems that this feature was removed from Lion. The reason for this we will never be sure.\nFor now you will need to manually delete using the mouse and trash can.\n", "Q: Keyboard option keys work as command keys I have a interesting Option Key problem  but I couldn't find any solution.\nI am using iMac 21,5\" and running Mac OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard.\nMy keyboard is apple  wired aluminum extended keyboard  and my layout is \"Turkish QWERTY PC\".

I recently skimmed the source-code of an app on the itunes.apple.com website and noticed when accessing the app image that the underlying image is plain squared! This means Apple somehow visually \"wraps\" the image with some technique to make it appear as if it has rounded corners! As I'm no expert on such details, yet would like to know how Apple achieves this.\nThe reason is that in my opinion this visual display of all apps (also in the iTunes App Store software) is a crucial, consistant aspect of Apple's app display. As I want to work on something related to Apples applications (and maybe also sign up for their affiliate program, which might answer this question, but I didn't do so yet), so I need to be informed about this issue.\nThank you for your help in advance.\n\nA: The trick is to overlay a masking icon which contains a border and some shadow. With CSS this is positioned exactly above the underlying icon.\nThis is the image: http://r.mzstatic.com/htmlResources/F96C/images/mask175.png\nIf all you need is rounded corners, there is some CSS (3) only tricks for that, though it will look a bit different then.\n", "Q: new 4th generation iPod touch doesn't have the app store My brand new 4th generation iPod touch doesn't have the app store on it. \nI think it's because I restored all the data from my old iPod touch and stored it on my new iPod, and my old one didn't have the app store. \nI downloaded a software update on itunes to try and revert the restore, but after it downloaded, it said that it can't be un-restored, and I can't sync apps from my mac to my iPod for some reason. \nCan somebody please tell me how to get the app store on my iPod and how to sync my apps from my mac onto my iPod? I would really appreciate it if somebody told me.\n\nA: I assume you have all your media synced to iTunes on a Mac or PC? Then it's save to do a full restore of your iPod touch.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Disconnect the USB cable from the iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, but leave the other end of the cable connected to your computer's USB\n  port.\n  \n*Turn off the device: Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button for a few seconds until the red slider appears, then slide the slider.

If this is successful, can I then delete the recordings from my iPad to create some much needed space?\nIf so, how do I retrieve any specific recordings from iCloud for later use?\n\nA: You can sync your QuickVoice recordings with a PC or Mac using their software. Have a look at the QuickVoice website for information on the download and price, although it seems that you get a desktop version with the iOS version, which I didn't get so not sure where to get it.\nThis app does not use iCloud to sync, it uses its own cloud storage system.\n", "Q: Reinstalling Lion on a 3rd party SSD I've purchased an SSD drive INTEL SSDSA2CW120G3 and had a guy in Apple Reseller store clone the original HDD to the SSD.\nThe problem is, that the original HDD was almost dead and there were some problems while cloning. They also cloned some kind of hidden/encrypted partition, which is required for Lion.\nThey told me that I should use my Snow Leopard install DVD to format the main data partition and then reinstall Snow Leopard and upgrade to Lion from App Store.\nThey also said something about having problems with cloning the hidden partition.\nIs there any safe way that I can check, if I'm going to be able to install Snow Leopard and then safely upgrade to Lion after I format the SSD? Or even better, is there any way to install Lion directly?\nedit: looking at the restore partition, it looks like it's empty\n\n\nA: Use this - it runs you through how to use it. You just need to download the app from the app store and follow the instructions. \n\nA: The Recovery HD partition is not meant to be clone-able.  They clearly failed and had no idea what they were doing when it came to that stage.\nRunning the Lion installer will install that Recovery HD partition properly.  Please note that the Recovery HD partition is not required for Lion, but can be useful if you have any boot errors and need to reinstall Lion at a later date.\nRe-installing Snow Leopard from a Lion install will not work, the user account details are slightly different between Snow Leopard and Lion (found that out the hard way), this would essentially render your user account useless.  \nGood Luck!\nP.S. I'd advise you don't go back to that reseller, they have no clue what they're doing.\nP.P.S. iampearce's comment about the drive being physically in the machine before installing Lion is irrelevant, and incorrect.  The files that are used during the installer are loaded according to the machine hardware you boot from.\n", "Q: Is using my iPod touch always plugged in an OK thing to do? I recently added an iPod interface to my Accord: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JT5G4G/ref=oh_o02_s00_i00_details\nIt has two connections: the regular Apple 30-pin iPod dock cable which plays back and charges and then an AUX 3.5 mm headphone connector.\nI get the best sound when connected to the Apple connector, but it is also charging it at the same time. I really don't use it much outside of my commute to work ~1 hr. per day, so is it bad for the battery to be plugged in all the time? The car interface won't overcharge it; it stops when full. I just didn't know if I needed to actually use the Li-ion battery in the iPod to keep it useful when I do need to take it unplugged.\n\nA: It'll probably be fine.\n\n\n*\n\n*If it's always plugged in, you won't notice any battery decay because the device will always be charged (or pulling off mains power) when you need it.\n\n*Any battery decay will probably take long enough that it'll be time to buy a new iPod by the time you notice anything severe.\n\n\nThe easiest way to mitigate this I can think of is to unplug the device over the weekend, remove it from the car, and let it discharge on its own. Then, on Monday, plug it back in and go. This has the added advantage that it's not subjected to the temperature extremes the interior of a car can see over a period of extended non-use.\n", "Q: Application development ON the iPod Touch? I have a pretty long commute to work and own an iPod Touch. I figure it would be nice to do some simple programming on the way. I'm not picky on which language to code on. Also, I usually have no internet connection on my commute so developing and editing on the cloud is out.\nI've been looking through the app store but haven't found any apps that offer a \"development environment\" or an editor with a compiler. It's also not clear to me if I can access the iPod Touch's OS itself and do some coding on it.\nIs any development ON the iPod Touch possible? Does an app for this exist?\n\nA: I don't think there will be any with a compiler, due to iOS and App Store restrictions. The best thing on an iPhone or iPod I think would be a text editor to write code (I use Nebulous and its Dropbox syncing) and an SSH app (I use Prompt) to compile and run the code. Though it might be tough to keep a connection during a commute for SSH.\nIf you need a computer to SSH to, you could use an Amazon EC2 app to create and use a box on the go. I haven't done that yet, so I don't have a good recommendation, but it's on my list of things to try.\nAlso, if you have an iPad, Textastic is a fantastic code editor, but it's not available on iPhone or iPod.\n\nA: For the iPad you could get Codea but unfortunately it doesn't run on iPod touch or iPhone.\nIf your device can be jailbroken and you're willing to do so, then you have many more choices and also direct access to all parts of the iOS.\n", "Q: How can I open a new Finder window on every click on the Finder Icon? is there anywhere a script or a workaround, or even just a .plist file, where i can manage to open a new finder window by clicking on the finder icon in the dock?\nWhen a Finder window is already open, a click on the Finder icon just shows me the opened window, but doesn't open a new one.\nCan anyone help?\n\nA: You can do this using Hyperdock.\nI do this for most of my software (Finder, Terminal, Chrome, etc...). Clicking on the application icon sends the application a Command + N. \nIt's non-free though.\n\nA: This behaviour happens beacuse the dock just launches an app. Finder is classified as an app, so it will open/show the app window, you will need to open a new window within the app.\nYou can use the keyboard short cut CMD + N, and if you are not in the app press CMD + Tab to open it first.\nYou could possibly try using Quicksilver, which makes custom keystrokes, so you could assign O to opening a new finder window\n", "Q: Shortcut to apply header style 4 (and 5, 6...) In Microsoft Office Word, one press ⌘⌥1, ⌘⌥2 or ⌘⌥1 to apply header style 1, 2 or 3 respectively. This is also documented by Microsoft (see: Aligning and formatting paragraphs). However writing a large document, I want to apply header style 4 (and 5, 6...) but there does not seem to be a shortcut available for that. Applying header styles is not an option in the menu bar, so I cannot create a custom shortcut through System Preferences > Keyboard (I suppose). How would I add a shortcut in this case?\n\nA: Found it, although I did not expect the solution to be this simple. To do this, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right-click the Heading 4 style in the ribbon and choose 'Modify' (Or through Layout > Styles > Heading 4 > Modify\n\n*In the left hand bottom corner, select 'Shortcut'\n\n*Assign shortcut ⌘⌥4\n\n*Repeat for Heading 5, 6...\n\n*Done!\n\n", "Q: Macbook Pro random shutdown Has anyone experienced this problem? Does anyone have a solution? I have scoured the internets for solutions and found many different answers. I am on a Macbook Pro 6,1. The one that has worked for me is reset the SMC, switched to the integrated card using gfxCardStatus, not plugging in an external monitor and jacking up my fan speed to 6k RPMs. This has made my machine usable and has only shutdown 2x in the past 3 days. Anyone else have any insight? Solutions?\n\nA: It sounds like your motherboard has suffered heat damage.  The most likely culprit is doing something 3D graphics intensive, because the graphics chip can get a lot hotter than the CPU but the fan speed is controlled by the CPU temperature.  Another possible cause of overheating is running Windows in BootCamp.\nI've had that happen on a couple of different Macbook Pros (earlier models) and once it reaches this state you need a new motherboard.  In my case, they were still under AppleCare so it was free.  Since then I've always made sure to crank up the fan speeds before doing anything 3D intensive, and I installed fan controllers on the Windows side.\n\nA: Test your memory modules using something like Rember or Apple's Hardware Test.\n\nA: Perhaps open Console, select all messages, go to the search field and type 'shutdown' (no quotes needed) and the PRAM should have logged a shutdown cause error code the next time you boot after the power off. Please post the output here. Thanks.\n", "Q: Deleted Exchange Password Prohibiting Access to IPad I had an email account on an Exchange server for a contract I was working on.  The contract ended and my password was deleted from the Exchange server so I could no longer get into the company's email.  Now, when I open my IPad it asks for the Exchange password and when I can't supply it I continue to get the message asking for the password.  I can't cancel out of this error message, it just keeps coming up whether I hit cancel or supply a no longer valid password.  I cannot get into the IPad desktop because I can't get by this message.  I would like to delete the Exchange account from my IPad (I was able to do this on my IPhone) but I can't get to the Settings.  How can I get by this message?  Thanks.\n\nA: Is it a wifi only iPad? If so, you can try to temporarily shutdown your wifi. If the iPad is not connected to Internet, maybe it won't try to fetch mails.\nWhen you are prompted, have you tried to double click the home button and kill the Mail app? Or maybe try to access Settings from there.\nYou can also try to connect your iPad to your computer, if it's sync to iTunes. From there, in the Info view of the iPad on iTunes, select that you don't want any email account (I believe there is a overwrite current settings checkbox) and erase your accounts from there.\nYou'll probably have to re-add your others account manually.\n", "Q: Macbook pro early 2011 model motherboard short circuted on connecting data cable to USB port I have macbook pro early 2011 MC700 model. Few days back I was using it on battery and connected my samsung phone data cable to USB port and when I was about to connect other end of cable to my phone, macbook crashed. I took it to service centre and after few days technician told me macbook motherboard has short circuted and it need to be replaced. My macbook is just 3 month old and warranty has saved me from the cost of repair. I want to know what exactly is reason of short circuit. Is it fault in that model or this kind of short circuit of motherboard on connecting data cable is a common phenomenon. Now in future I will think twice before connecting my USB cable or pendrive to USB port of macbook. What can be exact reason of shortcircuit of motherboard.

I had my MacBook Pro 17' connected to my Thunderbolt Display and when decided to charge my ipad using the USB and when I connected the iPad, everything shutdown. I couldn't even power it back on. Took it to apple store and they told me 500 bucks. WHAT$$$ They don't even diagnose the problem. \n\nA: Assuming everything the service center told you was accurate, and that it was really related to what you were doing with the USB cable, then the likely suspects are \n\n\n*\n\n*a faulty USB connector on the motherboard was faulty;\n\n*a faulty USB cable; or \n\n*a faulty USB connector in the phone.\n\n\nBeyond this, we don't have enough information to know.  Can you find out any more about the motherboard short-circuit, such as its location, from the service center?\nI would certainly take the cable and the phone to the service center when I went to pick up my Macbook, and ask them to test both of them.\n\nA: The reason is that there are surface mount protection fuses on the board and releasing the battery resets them, just fixed it on my MacBook last week\n", "Q: Where can I find \"Install Mac OS X Lion\" in the App Store?

I'd like to revision-control my mail configuration (both the preferences and the mailbox rules -- especially the latter) but Mail insists on rewriting its preferences as binary plist files as soon as it opens. I'd like to have it keep them in text or XML format, which would allow me to keep them in revision control in a meaningful way. Yes, I could keep them as binaries, but those are awful and result in a lot of ugly changesets.\n\nA: Probably not, but you could use plutil to convert the binary plist to XML and keep the results in your revision control system.\n", "Q: How does Mac OS X decide which volumes to mount?

The Disk Arbitration framework handles notifying applications of disk mount/unmount events, and allows them to influence whether a volume is mounted or not.\nConsult the man page for diskarbitrationd for very limited further information; for example, diskarbitrationd consults /etc/fstab to determine if the discovered filesystem should be mounted other than at the default location(/Volumes/) or with special options (or not mounted at all.)\nReasons for diskarbitrationd not mounting a filesystem or \"volume\" on a device may include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Errors (corruption) in the partition table.\n\n*A mismatch between the partition type and the filesystem.\n\n*A damaged filesystem which fsck cannot repair.\n\n*Hardware failure.\n\n*Filesystem is listed in /etc/fstab with noauto.\n\n*An application has used the Disk Arbitration framework to prevent auto-mounting\n\n\nAccording to your comments, all your journaled filesystems are mounting, and the filesystem which isn't mounting doesn't have journaling turned on.  Journaling was introduced in 10.2 Server and 10.3 Client and by now is considered a vital, critical feature.  It should be enabled unless you really know what you're doing; hence why you must hold down the option-key in Disk Utility to disable it in modern versions of OS X.   Make sure the volume has journaling enabled:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the volume in Disk Utility\n\n*Choose File->Enable journaling (if it is greyed out, journaling is enabled.\n\n*Verify by choosing File->Get info; you should see \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" as the filesystem type.\n\n\nA: Assuming there's no dramas with the volumes themselves, you can mount additional volumes at login by adding them as Login Items for your user account in the System Preferences.\n\nA: The volume is mounted automatically again.\nI never did find out how Mac OS X decides which volumes to mount and which not. But whatever it is, Mac OS decided to mount the volume again. Apparently the solution is to reboot until it works.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences>Accounts>Login Items.

Both of them have integrated webcams.  Some applications are screwy and inconsistent about letting me pick which webcam to use.  \nI always want to use the webcam on the iMac and never the one on the Thunderbolt display, especially as it's rotated so the webcam image is not only off-center, but 90 degrees in the wrong direction.\nIs there any way (defaults setting or something) for me to disable the webcam on the thunderbolt display, but still let the webcam on my iMac to function?\n\nA: Apple don't provide any way to control camera devices centrally, it is left up the program in use to provide the ability to choose.\nGenerally, well written programs give you a choice, and poorly written (and, generally, poorly supported) programs don't. (Photobooth, I'm looking at you.)\nThe only way I know to force a program to not use a camera is a hack that's been around a while and that is to use something like iChat to make the other iSight busy so it's not picked up by any other program.\nAnother, older, hack is to remove the kexts that support the devices, however, that would stop all the iSights from working, so, in this case, not a good idea.\nSo, in the end, there's no answer, but I'm sure there's an app that people would pay for in there somewhere.\n\nA: If using FaceTime, go to MenuBar > Video > camera and select the camera for the built-in display (or any of the external monitors) as you prefer.\n\nA: The trivial non-technical way which works in all cases is to put a small piece of black electrical tape over the camera. Then, even if a program manages to change the settings to turn the camera on, the camera will not be usable. \nTo re-enable the camera when you want to use it, remove the tape.\n\nA: I'm posting this for progeny. It seems that in most apps now (including Photo Booth) there is a Camera menu item that allows you to switch the camera you're using. For the Thunderbolt Display the menu items are: Camera > FaceTime HD Camera (Display).\nI'm not sure if this has always been here and I just missed it or if an update resolved the issue. Regardless it's great to have some control over which camera you want to use.\n\nA: If you are using Skype, this is something that you can set - go to Skype (menu in the Skype app) -> Preferences -> Audio/video, and select the video input from the drop down menu. Then select \"Camera\". Perform the same procedure for editing the microphone preferences.\n\nA: I use an app called iGlasses which can switch between different webcams. My 2011 MacBook Pro is normally used with the lid closed, thus making it impossible to use the FaceTime camera.\nWith iGlasses I can choose between a firewire iSight, a firewire Mini DV video camera, the built-in FaceTime camera or a USB webcam.\nThe app is by www.Ecamm.com and can be trialled free but costs $19.95 to buy.\n\nA: Open an terminal.\nRun the following commands by what you need:\nTo disable, type:\nchmod 000 /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/AppleCamera.plugin/Contents/MacOS/AppleCamera\n\nTo enable, type:\nchmod 755 /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/AppleCamera.plugin/Contents/MacOS/AppleCamera\n\n", "Q: Where does the Mac version of the iPhone Configuration Utility store its data?

For this reason, I recommend turning off your Time Machine drive while in Windows.\nAnother possibility is that modifications to your primary drive could cause its ID to change, which would break its association with its existing Time Machine backups.  The old Time Machine backups would still be there on the backup drive, but they would be treated as being backups of a different system.  It sounds like this is probably what happened.  It could be because you (or something) renamed the primary drive or otherwise tried to change it at the root level.  But since you saw a MacDrive error, its more likely a glitch in MacDrive.  There's not much you can do to prevent that except not use it.\nTry running a Disk Utility check on all drives, preferably while booted from a DVD or an external drive.  That will at least make sure nothing worse happened.\n", "Q: Where did this new WiFi network with SSID 'SETUP' come from? After setting up my router (Linksys WRT120N) and my wireless network, upon clicking on the wireless icon and selecting \"Join Other Network...\" a new network called SETUP shows up when clicking the Show Networks button.  Where did this network come from?  It is password protected, but none of the user accounts and passwords can access it.  There is no way of deleting it.\nThe network that I have initially set up is, however, working fine.\n(MB Pro; OS X 10.6.8)\n\nA: This could be the network for a wireless printer. Its possible that someone nearby has bought a new printer with wireless functions.\n\nA: Why don't you unplug your router and check to see if SETUP still appears on your MBP. If it does then it belongs to someone else near you.\n\nA: It turned out that our Brother laser printer was responsible. Turning off wifi or properly configuring wifi helped to eliminate the \"SETUP\" wifi.\n", "Q: Why might my mac be running extremely slowly at times? This sounds like a pretty open, multi-possibility question, but I'm at a loss. I continually experience my mac falling behind by several words or characters. I mainly notice it in chrome and adium, but it isn't necessarily specific to those. When it happens I look at menu meters and notice the following.\n4 cores at idle\nThe hard drive is sitting idle as well.\n1,000 MB of ram free at a minimum\nnetwork usage under 10KB/s\nIf I look at the load averages I'm generally fairly low as well. This last time I was around .2 on all three numbers, certainly nothing close to 4.\nWhat else could be causing extreme slowness like this? While I mentioned typing, this is not exclusive to typing, I also notice long delays on simply opening another tab in a web browser. The symptoms might last for a few minutes or more and then completely subside to the point that things feel fast again.\nIt might be evident based off 4 cores sitting at idle, but looking in activity monitor shows nothing taking much CPU at all, and the biggest ram usage for a single app was around 300 MB this last time a few moments ago.\n\nA: There are a lot of possibilities, but worst thing first:\nRun /Applications/Utilities/Console.app and check system.log.\nLook especially for entries that say something like disk4s3: I/O error.\nIf you see that, see this: Hard Drive Recovery\nAlso look at Console Messages.  There are usually a lot of weird messages in there, but look for repeated things occurring at the same time as the slowdowns.\nIf the app is completely unresponsive for several seconds at a time, particularly if it is giving you the spinning ball cursor, then it is likely a disk I/O issue.  If the app is just slow, particularly if other apps are fine, then it may be trying to do something in the background that happens to involve a lot of time dependent operations (like network chatter) which don't show up in activity monitor because they mostly involve idle waiting.  \nGraphics issues can also cause weird slowdowns, but that should be something obvious like having a 3D shooter (or iTunes visualization) running in the background, a second display hooked up, or custom graphics drivers installed.\nClear all browser caches, quit all unnecessary apps.\nAnother possibility to consider is overheating.  Make sure all vents are clear, get a Fan or temperature utility.  But now I'm really reaching.  The answer is likely in the logs somewhere.\n", "Q: Most iPhone 4S photos import into iPhoto 11 as all black images Strange problem: when I import photos from my iPhone 4S (5.0.1) into iPhoto 11 (latest), MOST of the images show as all black.  Strangely, almost all landscape photos are imported/displayed ok, however every portrait shot shows as black.\nIf I reveal in finder, the modified files that iPhoto creates are 162kb black jpgs, however the original files are the correct photos.\nI've rebuilt my iPhoto '11 library, to no avail.  After reimporting, portrait images are still black.  For some reason, iPhoto is changing/corrupting the 'modified' versions of the photos upon import.\nThinking this is a bug either in iPhoto or relating to the iPhone 4S (this never happened with the 4...)\nFWIW It's being discussed in the Apple Support forums here.\nI also tried importing the photos via Image Capture then into iPhoto, and same result.  So it's an issue with how iPhoto processes (modifies) the photos into it's library.\nI believe this issue only seems to affect iOS5 users...\n\nA: As forbca said in his/her answer in the support thread you linked to, the issue seems to be resolved if you reboot. \nI had the same issue. After a reboot, I'm able to import the photos correctly into iPhoto. Just grab the originals and re-import them in iPhoto. You'll be asked about duplicates – import the portrait photos anyway.\nIt seems to be a bug in an iPhoto update that only turns up if you haven't rebooted since the update. The corrupted imports were done on a laptop that had over 30 days of uptime.\n\nA: You're not alone, there are several discussions along these lines in the Apple Support Forums.\nThe solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your iPhoto Library if necessary. (Insert mandatory lecture\n    about routine backups if you don't already do so.)\n\n*Rebuild your\n    iPhoto Library by depressing command + option while\n    starting iPhoto.\n\n*Check the option for repairing Library permissions.\n\nA: There appear to be different home grown solutions to this problem.. Here's another:\nhttp://www.philmug.ph/forum/f19/fix-iphoto-black-portrait-images-84679/\n", "Q: MBA 13\" 2011 (with TB) as a display for PS3 I wonder if I can use my new MacBook Air 13\" 2011 as a display for PS3 (of course with the help of some adapter, e.g. Kanex XD/Belkin AV360™)? I know it sound weird, but that's my situation.\n\nA: You'll need to look for HDMI capture boxes. The best one for your situation would seem to be these Blackmagic products, specifically the Thunderbolt one (it says \"shipping in January\").\nI doubt there'll be many (if any) HDMI-USB capture boxes, except maybe USB 3.0, which your Air doesn't have.\nOf course, if what you want to record (and maybe watch) is HDCP protected, you won't be able to. Be aware that any digitizing solution will introduce lag so this is not at all an optimal solution for gaming where you might care about reaction speeds.\n", "Q: How do I transmit video from my iMac wirelessly? What would be a good option if I were to transmit any video (DVD, AVI, MOV, just anything) from my iMac to a TV or beamer over the air? 1080p would be nice but is not a requirement. Setup should be simple and the required hardware should be small and have decent design that can be used in a living room.\n\nA: How about an Apple TV ($99) and Airflick (free), over WiFi?  It'll only be 720p, though.\nhttp://ericasadun.com/ftp/AirPlay/\nThere are a number of solutions for transmitting high-definition video:\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=1080p+wireless\n...but to be honest, they cost nearly as much (or more) than an AppleTV, which gets you way more functionality.  Unless you have an enormous TV and top-notch content, you're going to be very hard-pressed to tell the difference.\n\nA: You could use DLNA if your TV supports it and a DLNA server on your iMac to expose the videos you want to stream.\n\nA: With the advent of OS X Mountain Lion, you can now use an Apple TV ($99) and Airplay Mirroring to mirror your display (in full 1080p) to the Apple TV.\n\n", "Q: How do I effectively have multiple helpdeskers use ARD? I manage the IT for an org with about 800 clients with mixture of Windows and Mac platforms. I'm looking at getting ARD for my staff (up to 4 installations of ARD) so they can better support the mac clients. One large gotcha is that it seems each installation of ARD has to be configured individually, and there is no built-in way to share the information about all our clients that each installation of ARD has. So what would be the best way to effectively manage a large number of client machines with multiple client support staff? Some ideas I've thought of:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have up to 4 installations of ARD and use some combination of Applescript and /or automator to try and sync the data between the 4 installations of ARD. I see via this thread: How can I share Apple Remote Desktop's list of machines to other computers? that it's possible, but there are no specifics as to actually how to do it, and I can see that trying to keep data in sync between 4 machines would be problematic\n\n*Have ARD on a mac server and connect that macserver via VNC or otherwise and then from that server support the client. Seems clunky.\n\n*Give up on sharing information about clients and just use ARD as a more advanced version of VNC\n\n\nAny other suggestions welcome. Thanks!\n\nA: It sounds like you need a client management solution.  I prefer the Casper Suite, but in the interest of full disclosure, I work for the manufacturer.  However, I was a customer for some time before becoming an employee.  There are competing products and I advise you to evaluate more than one solution before making a purchase.\nWith all that said, a client management solution will give you a central inventory system, and centralized management tools.  The information regarding your inventory and management tasks are stored on a server that is accessible to your entire staff, and depending on the privileges you assign, all members of the team can perform management tasks.\nI hope this is helpful.\n\nA: Casper Suite looks pretty awesome on for an IT environment. \nAlthough it's not the most clean cut option, you can save the configuration of ARD by taking the .plist (and .plist.lockfile) out of the ~/Library/Preferences directory. I've tested it on my configuration, and that seems to be the main place for configuration storage.\nFor easy deployment, you could create an Automator application that moves the file to the user's ~/Library/Preferences directory. You could place that application in a folder along with the .plist file and create a .zip file that could be emailed to your staff.\nHope this helps.\n-Matt\n", "Q: iTunes Match \"upgraded\" one of my songs with a glitchy version. Now what? I signed up for iTunes Match. It matched most of my songs and uploaded the rest. I was playing one of my favorite songs and discovered it has a glitch at 21 seconds in. It is consistently there, even on multiple devices. Luckily I found I still had my copy in a backup, so I removed the song from the iTunes library and re-added it. Unfortunately it is one of the songs Apple \"matched\" so it keeps getting replaced with the glitchy version. \nI guess I could try renaming the song so Apple doesn't keep replacing it, but that seems like a lot of work. What else can I do?\n\nA: My understanding (although not precise science) so far with Match knows the song signature and uses this in conjunction with the track length to match against their database. \nThis would explain why some songs get replaced with explicit versions on Match while renaming one song to another (incorrect) does not trick Match into thinking it is a new song. You can test both quite easily \n\n\n*\n\n*the former by deleting a non explicit matched song (remembering track length) and pulling it back from iCloud\n\n*the latter by ripping a CD without any info into Track01...02 etc and have it matched correctly.\n\n\nall the above is somehow tied with Genius. \nWith the above assumption, to keep your proper version try padding out the length, add noise, or combine the track with the next (if it belongs to an album) and it should cause enough difference to be uploaded instead of being matched.\n", "Q: Remove useless files from a Mac I want to find a way to delete all the useless files: binaries, log and cache files, duplicate files and app's leftover. \nHow can I do that?\n\nA: Onyx (free)\n\n*\n\n*Verify the Startup Disk and the structure of its System files, to run misc. tasks of system maintenance\n\n\n*Configure some hidden parameters of the Finder, Dock, QuickTime, Safari, Mail, iTunes, Login window, Spotlight, and many of Apple’s applications\n\n\n*Delete caches, to remove a certain number of files and folders that may become cumbersome, and more.\n\n\n*...\nRemoving duplicate files is not supported by Onyx.\n\n\nA: I use Macaroni by Atomic Bird http://www.atomicbird.com.  Cost $10.  Installs as a login item, with a pane in System Preferences.  Automatic daily, weekly and monthly cleaning.\n2014: I would also recommend \"Duplicate Detective\", currently $3 in the Mac App Store.  It finds files with duplicate hash values, not relying on file names or just file sizes alone.  \n\nA: One of the oldest and popular app is CCleaner. It is most popular app for PC. And it works perfectly on Mac too.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.piriform.com/mac/ccleaner\n\nA: I use CleanMyMac, which has the following features:\n\n\n*\n\n*reset outdated cache files to zero\n\n*remove log files\n\n*remove the binary files that are not executed on your computer, from applications with an executable for PowerPC and Intel\n\n*remove useless files created by applications\n\n*remove leftovers, and clean the trashcan\n\n*keep the trashcan under control, and delete the files when the size of the files contained in the trashcan reach a limit you can set\n\n*uninstall applications\n\n", "Q: Stop Devices Deleting Songs On iCloud; iTunes Match I want to delete songs from my devices, not from iCloud.\nCan I change settings to prevent devices deleting songs from iCloud, i.e. delete from local device but not iCloud.\n\nA: When you delete a song from an iDevice connected to iTunes Match, only the local copy gets deleted. The song remains in the index and gets displayed with the iCloud icon.\nThe option to delete the cloud version as well is only given when deleting a song in iTunes on Mac or PC.\n\nA: I took my Mac offline and opened the music location in finder, closed iTunes and deleted the songs while iTunes was closed. Make sure you have a backup!\nI later discovered that one of the songs it matched from in the cloud was defective (had a glitch). Luckily I have a backup.\nHaven't looked into how to deal with a full iOS device.

This issue is about an interstate family member's iPad 2, so I'm afraid my knowledge of the issue and ability to troubleshoot are rather limited, but I'd appreciate any general help available.\nThe iPad is (or was) connected to an Apple bluetooth keyboard. It has been working up until today when, apparently, each time the bluetooth is turned on in the settings, it immediately reverts to being off. Is there a known or common reason for this to occur? Is there any solution?\nI thought that it might be a power-saving thing, but apparently the iPad had near to full charge, and I can't think of much else.\n\nA: Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. \nNo loss of data, you'll just have re-enter wifi passwords and re-pair Bluetooth devices. \nIf this fails then Restore. \n\nA: A couple of things you could do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try restarting the iPad \n\n*Do a software restore of the iPad by pluggging the up to your PC or Mac and choosing the resore option\nHope this helps! \n", "Q: Does iCloud Backup store WiFi password? I recall iOS5 beta1 does not do this which cost me scores of saved wifi passwords on my iPhone. \nAlso another question says application keychain data is not backed up, just want to check if there's exception for Wifi password cause they are pretty often used but hard to remember.\n\nA: iCloud Backups of iOS devices include the Keychain of all saved passwords on the device, including WiFi network passwords, however that keychain is signed against the UDID (The Universal Device Identifier, a unique ID for your device).\nIf the UDID does not match (examples being if your device was replaced by Apple due to failure or you purchased a new one), than the key store will not be able to be opened, and your passwords will need to be re-entered on the device.\nMacs using iCloud backups do not back up the Keychains at this time.\n\nA: MobileMe used to provide Keychain sync, and hence also a kind of backup of your WiFi passwords. However, with the introduction of iCloud, keychain sync has been dropped from the list of features. If you would like to see this to come back, you might want to try giving feedback to Apple at this place. Apple may (or may not) listen to our complaints.\n\nA: Apple has published a documentation describing what content is stored in iCloud and what content is sent over the internet.\nIt is not explicitly mentioned if passwords are stored in the backup. \n\nApple encrypts data that is stored to deliver the iCloud service.\n  Encrypted data includes:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Photos in your Photo Stream\n  \n*Documents in the Cloud\n  \n*Backup data for your iOS device//Does this include passwords?! \n  \n*Contacts\n  \n*Calendars\n  \n*Bookmarks\n  \n*Reminders\n  \n*Location data for Find My iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Mac\n  \n*Location data for Find My Friends\n\n\nA: It stores settings, including wifi passwords but if you restore your device and restore from iCloud on your device you will have to put in the password to your wifi to set it up. While it restores settings it restores your wifi settings too.\n\nA: I have to say that I went to a friends house and entered the wifi password on my iPhone.  Later when I got my iPad out and started using the Internet without having to enter the password again the iPad. I only realised this the day after hence why I am now searching 'does iCloud store wifi password'.\nI guess it must.\n", "Q: What is website data? When in Settings under Safari>Advanced I see website data. What is this?\nAlso, what does a hard reset (holding sleep/wake and home button) do?\n\nA: Website data\nWhen clearing website data, Safari removes cookies, Flash plug-in data, and information from databases, local storage, and the application cache.\nHard Reset\nI don't know what the hard reset does exactly. I only know that it does not remove your stored media. This kind of reset is necessary, when neither the display nor the side buttons response normally and the only other option to shut down the device would be removing the battery.\n\nA: Just to assist....the hard reset referred to as a FORCED RESTART does the same thing that a hard reboot does on a desktop or laptop unit.  It shuts all programs off and cuts the power to your iOS device.  Not the recommended way to restart the device unless absolutely necessary.  Just as with a desktop or laptop, it can damage your system.\n", "Q: How do I transfer iOS apps only from an old computer to a new one? I've recently bought a MacBook Pro. I've migrated all the iTunes music across from my old pc to my new mac and have also downloaded more tunes since I bought my computer. \nNow I'm trying to sync my iPhone and iPad with the new computer - however if I sync them then I lose all the apps. \nso is there a way of just migrating the apps across from the old to the new computer. Both my iPad and iPhone are backed up on iCloud - I thought this meant it would automatically download to the MacBook as well, Does it not?\n\nA: When you choose to backup on iCloud you are creating a backup in the cloud, not the MacBook.\nYou have the choice to Sync to a computer or to iCloud. If you sync to a computer you can also sync over WiFi, which could be the better option for you by the sound of your question.\nIf you open iTunes, make sure that it is authorised to your account.\nPlug your device in.\nIt will then say.

(It is not listed under Notifications (other apps are), nor is it listed with the other apps at the bottom of Settings.\nAnyone know how to prevent this annoyance?\n\nA: 4.2.2 has, due to customer feedback, added a setting under You and Settings (Gears icon) to turn off the Week in Review and all notifications that fall outside the normal notifications.\nIn detail, click the blue 'In' icon in top left corner of screen, then the 'You' pane, then the gear icon in the top right corner of screen, then set 'Notifications' to 'off'.\n\nA: You need to go to Settings, then Notifications then scroll down to In Notification Centre. You should have a LinkedIn entry. Touching on this will let you configure whether or not the LinkedIn app shows notifications.\n", "Q: Isn't there a faster way to delete events from the Calendar on my iPhone/iPod-touch?

Could this be a virus?\nUSB Mouse, Macbook Intel Core Duo 2\n\nA: It is unlikely this is due to a virus, as there are far more obvious explanations.\nWhatever type of mouse, you should first attempt to clean it when movements skip. Dirt might be interfering the laser or other sensors. You can use a slightly damp cloth for cleaning it. A mild detergent could help for greasy dirt accumulations.\nIf you are using a laser mouse, it might have difficulties tracking movement due to the type of surface you are using it on. This is especially common on glass or other homogeneous surfaces with very little texture. Using a mousepad should improve your experience in those cases.\nIf all else fails, maybe your mouse is up for replacement.\n\nA: If wireless mouse, the oval plastic thing on the bottom needs to be clean, just scrape off with  your fingernail or with a coin, also the button on the top can get dirty, press down on the button, then use a small pin to try to get any dust around the button clean, don't poke hard. U can also try: put a small amount of window cleaner/alcohol on a rag, not wet, just lightly damp, then turn the mouse upside down and roll the mouse around on the rag for a minute or so, that will cause the ball to move around and bring any dust/dirt to the surface.\nAssume u have replaced your batteries as the action gets squirrely when the batteries get low.\n", "Q: How to keep mac, iphone, icloud and gmail contacts in sync? I used to keep mac, iphone and Gmail in sync via Exchange till iCloud was released. Once I started using both Gmail contacts and iCloud for air syncing I started having duplicates on the address book, whatsapp and other apps.\nAfter doing some research I found there are conflicts between Gmail and iCloud when syncing. For instance, Exchange protocol does not allow things like birthday dates, contact groups or custom fields (something I noticed before). I was tempted of using iCloud for that reason but then Gmail contacts would be out of sync and I'm not sure I would be able of syncing my Mac's address book either (not sure).\nAnyway, is there any easy way (via software or not) of keeping mac, iphone, icloud and gmail in sync? Including custom fields, groups, birthdays...\n\nA: Mail\nuse the Gmail template on iOS to have the best Gmail experience on iPhone, use Sparrow to have the best experience on Mac. It will use your Gmail contacts and the one you have on Address Book.\nContacts\nUse iCloud for contact syncing on the Mac and the iPhone. You won't have the contacts on the Gmail webapp, but you can still find them on icloud.com.\n", "Q: unzipping in my downloads folder I have a very big downloads folder with over 200 files that haven't been properly organized.\nThe problem is that whenever I download something, eg a zip file from github, and I unzip it, the FILE IS GONE. I'm sure it's in there somewhere but it's impossible to find as no sorting mechanism puts it first. Date Modified, date created, date opened, etc are all not putting it first.\nDealing with this type of UX is incredibly painful.\nAny advice?\nEdit Sorry:\nMy original question was confusing and didn't explain what I was looking for. I'm looking for the output of the zip file not the original zip. The original zip is deleted, I don't need that anymore.\n\nA: What is happening is that that files are being unzipped to the Downloads folder, BUT the date that is being used is the date that the file was created on whichever system it was created on.\nUnfortunately that date is not usually helpful to you.\nIf you use Lion you can sort a folder by \"Date Added\" by pressing control + command + 4 (or View » Arrange By » Date Added).\nIf you are not on Lion (or even if you are), then I highly recommend The Unarchiver which works on 10.4+. It can:\n* extract zips to a specific directory (I use ~/Unzips)\n* always unzip to a new folder (which makes them easier to find, some files unzip to a different name, which is probably part of the confusion you are facing) \n* and it can set the modification date to the current date/time, which will help the sorting problem:\n* it can automatically open folder it creates (so you don't have to go hunting for it)\n* it can either keep the the original .zip or move it to the trash.\nEven on Lion, I use it as my default ever since I found it, because of all the additional features that it offers.\nAnd it's free (donations accepted).\n\nA: You can alter the settings of archive utility dealing with how extractions are handled using the built in preference pane. It's not installed by default but it can easily be adeded to system preferences just by double clicking the file in \n/System/Library/CoreServices/Archive Utility.app/Contents/Resources/\n\nas described here\n\nA: Go to /System/Library/CoreServices and double click on Archive Utility. Once it launches, go to the Archive Utilities Preferences. From there, you can set where the files are expanded and whether it deletes the archive (zip file).\nNo need to use a 3rd party utility or navigate through program resources.\n\n\nA: You'll want to check this, but I seem to recall that OS X's Archive utility will in fact delete an archive after a successful unarchive operation. There may be a way to change a setting in Archive utility to change this default behavior.\n\nA: You might want to check out The Unarchiver as a replacement to OS X's built-in unzip utility - it has an option in its preferences to explicitly retain the original file.\nThat said I thought OS X since 10.6 would simply move the original .zip to your Trash?\n\nA: open Terminal and type \nls -tU ~/Downloads\n\nThis will print the list of the files sorted by creation date (I'm assuming your download folder is ~/Downloads otherwise you have to use the path to that directory).\nIf this does not place your file first...are you sure the file is actually there?\n\nA: we are using noodlesoft's hazel to keep our whole downloads folder organised.\nhazel detects whatever gets added and then applies rules which you can customise to your liking.\n", "Q: How easy is it to buy upgrade/replacement parts for a Mac Pro? I'm considering purchasing a Mac Pro in order to save money on upgrades in the future. I know how to build my own PC from scratch and I was wondering if I could use the same principles if were to buy Apple supported hardware. Do not get this confused with a Hackintosh, that's not what I'm striving to achieve.\nWould I be able to upgrade the logic board? and CPU? Or the Power Supply?\nDo you have experience with this and how did it work out for you?\n\nA: Apple uses custom logic boards, but I've heard of people upgrading the CPU if it uses the same socket type. The power supply on my 2008 Mac Pro would be hard to get to for a replacement. The key upgrade options are new hard drives, more memory, and better video cards. I've used those three to keep my '08 Mac Pro running fast enough to more than meet all of my current needs.\n\nA: The usual way people upgrade between revisions is to buy the newer revision, shift any hardware over that they want to keep (like a high-end graphics card), wipe the drives & reinstall MacOS X, and put the old machine up for sale locally or on eBay. Unless you live nowhere near a major metropolitan area, you won't have issues reselling the machine if you want to.  Every time there's a new model, you usually see a bunch of folks selling their old systems.\nThe logic board may be interchangeable between different systems, but you're flying in unknown territory with that one - the logic board is tightly integrated with / customized to a lot of other components in the chassis (front panel controls, power supply, etc.)\nSince Apple only sells parts to Apple Authorized Resellers and their technicians, your only option for purchasing a logic board (or replacement non-standard PC components) would be through ebay or a handful of used-mac-parts companies (like iFixit.)  They buy new or used systems and disassemble them for parts.\nCPUs on systems with socketed processors have some upgradeability; people have upgraded their Mac Pros this way (some Mac Minis and iMacs also had socketed processors, too) and documented as such on the usual Mac-related web boards/forums.  This is expensive on the Mac Pros, given they're Xeons.\nThere should be no need to upgrade the power supply; they're reliable and designed to handle the maximum capabilities of the machines, which include some pretty 'big' GPU configurations.  No, you can't pop an ATX supply in.\nDepending on which generation of Mac Pro, the memory is specialized; some take FB-DIMMs.  There have been reports that some aftermarket ram modules don't work well in some Mac Pros (temperature/heatsink issues), but a major manufacturer/reseller like Crucial should supply working memory.\nDrives are completely standard SATA.  Same with CD/DVD-ROm drives (verify the drive model works with OS X first.)  There's an optional hardware RAID controller card that's probably not worth it.  Areca, Adaptec, and others make compatible RAID controller cards; if bootability is important to you, check on this, as not all of them are.\nGraphics cards are standardized for the most part (save some which have custom connectors; for example, mine has a DVI port and a mini-displayport.)  The question is compatibility with MacOS X, but there are a very large number of compatible cards, and the Hackintosh community has pretty thoroughly documented that one for you already.\nSidenote: consider an iMac.  It can drive a second display out of the box, they have a second internal hard drive bay, the i7's are as fast or faster than the Xeons in some applications, and they're a LOT cheaper than a Mac Pro; probably quieter and use less power, too.  Spend the $ on more memory or an SSD, etc - an iMac with an SSD will wipe the floor with a Mac Pro without.\n\nA: I have found different website that will sell Apple parts.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://newegg.com ( I actually but memory for a PowerBook from them)\n\n*http://www.mac-pro.com/\n\n*http://www.ifixit.com/Mac-Parts\n", "Q: Apple’s enterprise distribution and management for iOS apps Is there an easy way to distribute same iOS (iPad, iPhone) app to multiple enterprise clients? We develop custom “Enterprise apps” that can be utilized by various clients. These apps get linked directly to client’s servers; but is there a way that we, as a third party, could find a solution to distribute/manage apps for our clients? \nIn other words, for client experience of using an app should be completely seamless without having to worry about anything after first time app download. Here are some specifics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does enterprise account option allow distributing same app to multiple clients? i.e. if I develop an app  - call it “Appyme”, can Appyme be distributed to 200 users of client A and 500 users of client B\n\n*Do we need to have 2 enterprise accounts  - one of Client A  and one for client B? My assumption was that I needed to have just one developer account under my company’s name  \n\n*Can this be done over the air or will we need to get these installed on all 700 devices?\n\n*How can “Appyme” upgrades be deployed to these users?\n\n*What happens to clients’ account and users when my personal enterprise account expires every year?\n\n\nA: Each client will need to have an enterprise account. If they want to, they can share their distribution key with you, and you can build an app for distribution within their organization. If the number of clients isn't large, this shouldn't be a big deal -- you can just set up a different target for each client, and then use an aggregate target to build them all at the same time.\nOver the air distribution is definitely possible. One way is by making the app available for download on a restricted access web server; another is to install it directly on any managed devices using mobile device management.\nI believe most of your questions are answered in the enterprise program agreement. Give that a careful reading if you haven't already. Questions about how to interpret a legal agreement are probably off topic for this forum, but I think you'll find the agreement to be fairly easy to understand as legal documents go.\nUpdate: Another option that's been available for a while now (though possibly not when I wrote the answer above) is custom B2B distribution. You can offer your apps for sale through Apple's Volume Purchase Program directly to your clients. That is, your clients would purchase through the Volume Purchase Program (essentially the App Store, but multiple licenses) and then distribute your app via Mobile Device Management or redemption codes. The down side of this plan is that Apple would take the usual App Store cut of the selling price.\n\nA: Two things happen to make enterprise distribution work over the air.\n\n\n*\n\n*The enterprise entity has the ability to sign apps with a certificate that Apple has also signed. \n\n*The enterprise entity has the ability to generate a code signing profile to load these apps and point the iOS device to whatever over the air (OTA) mobile device management (MDM) web solution desired.\n\n\nBoth of these rely on certificates where you can see the expiration dates and plan for renewal. The ability to make new Apple Push Notification certificates as well as the ability to get Apple to sign enterprise certs is what expires yearly. These push notification certs allow the server to push out updates to devices that are online and you always can have clients self-service from the distribution point or email links to the apps as needed if you don't want to re-push. \nFor personal use, you could check out Robot Cloud for $5 a month per device and learn how this works in practice.\n\nA: There is no such thing as a personal iOS Enterprise account.  Enterprise enrollments are only allowed for D&B rated corporations to distribute apps only to employees of that single corporation.  So each client corporation will need their own account.  You would use their account for distribution, not you own individual developer account.  You could use your own iOS Developer account for development and Ad Hoc beta test distribution to less than 100 devices total max.\nOver-the-air distribution from an employee-only corporate internal web site might be possible, but the corporate attorney needs to check the latest Enterprise agreement for details.\nEnterprise enrollments as well as individual enrollments need to be renewed every year.\n\nA: Home Enterprie Program targets US companies only and is a bummer for International clients. Sorry to say that even if all my prospect clients are US based, I don't find an apprpriate B2B solution. Appple mandates the client to have a VPP account that adds on the selling woes of small Developer like me. I have a similar need as 'Sunny' and am totally perplexed on whether to develop on my idea or to drop it! I have been struggling to find an answer to problem and even asked Apple. But everyone seems to be confused.\n", "Q: Some Contacts not showing up but are still stored in iPhone 4 I noticed today that several of my recent contacts are not in my contacts. However, I have been texting them and their info shows up when I go to contact from a text message or recent call.\nWhen I am in my address book and go to groups only All Contacts is an option, and that's where they are not. How do I get them all back into my contact list?\n\nA: Had a similar problem after doing a restore on my iPhone 4.  I just tried something that seemed to work.  Went to contacts and selected groups.  Selected Hide All Contacts and immediately selected Show All Contacts again.  The missing contacts re-appeared along with duplicate entries for the one's I recreated.\n\nA: I just went to 'Settings'> 'Mail, Contacts, Calendars'> scroll down to 'Contacts> select 'Import SIM Contacts'. All my contacts were restored to my Address Book. \n\nA: Go to Contacts, then click on Groups and make sure the \"all iCloud\" section is selected.\n\nA: Have you already tried to reboot your iPhone? (Push and hold the power button for 5 seconds, then slide to power off. Once your iPhone is shut down hold the power button for a few seconds to restart your iPhone)\nThat might solve you issue.\nIf that doesn't solve your contact list issue go to 'settings' > 'Mail, Contacts, Calendar' > scroll down to 'Contacts' and play with the 'Sort Order', 'Display Order' and My Info' options. That might do the trick.\n\nA: It looks like you're not the only one suffering from this issue (I know this topic is from 2010, but is describes perfectly your situation). I guess you've added those contacts to you list by using a 3th party app.\nAs of today, there isn't a fix for this issue, so I suggest you only add contacts by using the official contact app on your iPhone and add the ones not listed in your contact list manually. \n\nA: I made an an app which should help with this. Here's how to use it.\n\n\n*\n\n*download contact duster from iTunes Store which is free\n\n*go to settings\n\n*In settings go to contact duster and prefix your country code for eg +91 for India\n\n*go to contact duster, it will prompt you to apply country code to all your contacts. Click on sure. Please backup ur contacts before this process.\n\n*check your messages and call register as in recent calls. Your contacts names will be displayed.\n\n\nA: Navigate to Settings > iCloud then turn Contacts off. It this was causing the problem you will notice that your contacts come back. Then go back to the same place (Settings > iCloud) then turn Contacts back on then select Merge.\n\nA: I actually figured it out playing with it today, the contact would not appear in my contacts but if I searched my phone they would appear, so if I couldn't find them within contacts...I would first search for the contact...open it...and then edit the contact, then they would show up...\nSeemed strange but it works and new contacts are now being added as normal, must have been a glitch at one point as all the contacts that I cannot see were added in about a 2 month span.\n", "Q: Can I quickly delete all local music? I subscribe to iTunes Match. I recently did a massive song metadata (tag/ID3) update without using iTunes itself. This appears to have updated the metadata in iCloud, but another issue appeared.\nIn my Music list, for albums that changed more significantly, they are now listed twice. Once without a Cloud icon (the previously downloaded version), and one with a Cloud icon. There are many of these albums, and identifying them and manually deleting them has become cumbersome.\nIs there a function within iOS to allow me to delete all locally downloaded music? Essentially resetting the Music library state?\n\nA: Go to Settings; Tap on General > Usage > Music, then swipe across All Music and tap the delete button that appeared.\nThat should delete all your local music.\n\nA: Be aware!

Is it possible print multiple pages of a Word, PowerPoint or PDF document on a single page natively from iPhone 4S? \nOtherwise, are there other apps out there that allows me to do so?\nWhat I mean by printing multiple pages of a document on a single page is something what we have on the usual Mac OS and Windows OS, where there is often a \"handout\" option to print multiple slides or pages of a document onto a single physical paper page. \n\nA: Not natively, but you can with Printopia running on a Mac connected to your printer.\nTo do this, you need to first create a very simple Automator action. Open up Automator, and create a Print Plugin. For the Workflow, you only need to add the \"Run Shell Script\" action. Make sure the action is set to \"Pass input: as arguments\". The shell script needs only a single line:\nlp -o number-up=4 -o media=Letter \"$*\"\n\nThe specifics of the line might depend on your needs. In this case, I'm printing to my default printer (so is't not specified). I found that without the \"media\" option the result was was not scaled properly. You can define number-up as either 1, 2, 4, or 16.\nIf you want to specify a specific printer, use the following instead:\nlp -d <printer> -o number-up=4 -o media=Letter \"$*\"\n\nwhere <printer> is one of your print queues. You can find these by executing lpstat -a at a terminal prompt.\nThat's it. Now save the action. I saved mine as \"4-Up Print\".\nNext open Printopia in the System Preferences. Click the + to add a new destination, select \"Add PDF Workflow\", and pick the Automator Workflow that you created in the previous step.\nWhen printing from your iOS device, pick the newly created Printopia Air Print destination. Obviously you need to be on the same local network as the Mac.\nEnjoy!\n\nA: I am not aware of any apps that can do that. You certainly can't print handouts with the native printing menu.\nYou could create the handout document on a computer and then click the \"Save as PDF\" option in the print dialogue. Then you could transfer the PDF handout file to your iPhone, which you could then print from there.\n\nA: I'm sure you could set up Mail rules on a Mac linked to a complex AppleScript script that could get you your desired results. But honestly, its too much if you ask me.\n\nA: Check out Printopia. Not sure if it will do what you are looking to do from your iOS device but worth trying. Might want to contact the Printopia developer to see if they offer that capability before purchasing the app for the App Store.\n\nA: The app Printer Pro by Readdle will do it, it is the cheapest app that I see that can do it. It took me awhile to find it but so far it works great\n\nA: I use WPS app.. it's great and you can print multiple pages on one sheet.. Open the file using this app, then from ..file option.. choose print ..\n", "Q: Purchased tv shows on my iphone, how do i take them off? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I remove videos from iPhone \n\nI bought a couple tv shows while on my Iphone.

I am watching some quicktime apple trailers from the website they open up automatically in quicktime. How do I download it at that point. I am assuming that they are cached temporally somewhere. Any ideas?\n\nA: You can download them directly from the website you know? Just hold down the button for a little longer and then you can select your download format! \n\n\nA: Open terminal and type lsof\nThis will list all of the files opened by all of your processes.  The process playing the movie will either be Safari or QuickTimeHelper.  The move file will be one of the last ones listed for that process and will have a large size.  It will probably be in a \"/tmp/\" folder.\nWhen you think you've found the right file, you can verify that it is a quicktime move by typing file \"pathname\" where pathname is the file path given in lsof.

For example, it return 5430 and 5960, one which corresponds to the application and the other to CrashReporter. Hence, I believe that kill command fails due to more than one PID being present in the the_pid variable.\nDoes anyone know how to get around/fix this? How to make kill accept the the_pid variable when it contains more than one PID?

Thanks.\nEDIT\nHere is my screenshot\n\n\nA: I've just run into that issue myself for my new Keychron K4 keyboard.\nIt turned out that the switch was pointing to Windows mode, rather than OSx.\n\nA: It looks like you have accidentally configured your control key to be your alt key. Case in point: when I press alt+a, I get å. alt+v returns √, and alt+c gives us ç. Go into your settings and check again. They are located in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Modifier Keys. Note: alt is also option.\nEdit: I cannot duplicate this phenomena (see comments on this answer), so I will guess that the non-Apple keyboard is messing up the process somehow.\n\nA: If the option key is the one with the Windows logo on it, make sure you have the game switch (the switch with the little joystick on it) set to off.  I think off is left.\nWith the game switch on, the Windows key is disabled (to prevent accidental Windows key presses from minimizing your game and sending you back to the Windows desktop).\n\nA: I use a Macbook Pro with an old PC keyboard and ran into this issue today,  commandc gives \"ç\".\nAfter reading the posts here, I assigned\n\n*\n\n*Option to \"No Action\" and\n\n*Command to Command\n\nlike this:\n\nand now copy/paste works again.\nThis article has useful information:\nCommand+C (copy) with the left command key does not work\n\nA: Old question but today I ran into the same issue.

Remapping the keys in the Settings > Keyboard > Modifier Keys doesn't work. \nKarabiner-Elements works to remap the keys to each other. Thus left option -> left command, left command -> left option. Same for the right side. Karabiner is a free, broadly used piece of software.\nHere's what you'll want to do:\n\n\nA: Some keyboards support different keyboard configurations.  I found pressing fn + O solved this problem on Mac.  See your specific keyboard manual to switch it to Mac layout.\n\nA: I got the same issue with my keyboard as below:\nCtrl-A yields å\nCtrl-V yields √\nCtrl-C yields ç\nMy problem was my keyboard settings.\nI am using Air75 with both physically setting for MaxOS and Win.\nThe keyboard has a physical switch that allows you to select which system you are on. Flipping the switch to Windows will revert the command and options keys. I would suggest double check if you have the switch in the Windows setting.\nI hope this helps, and best of luck.\n\nA: On Logitech K860 I solved it by: Long press fn+O\nIf that doesn’t work, then try fn+P\n\n*\n\n*not case sensitive\n\n\n*long press (~ 5 seconds)\n\nA: Go to System Preference -> Keyboard -> (Keyboard shortcuts) -> Modifier keys -> Restore setting for your keyboard.\nThen just press Fn O for 3 seconds. Your keyboard setting will be setup to Mac defaults instead of Windows.\n", "Q: Will iTunes match download all my music to a new hard drive? I've been thinking about weather to use iTunes match, but not for syncing to all devices as I'm happy with what I have on my iPhone and have iPod with all songs on. \nWhat it would be useful for is to be able to download my library if my hard drive packs in or my computer is stolen.\nWill iTunes match work in this way? will I be able to download all my songs and not just the ones purchased in iTunes?\n\nA: If you enable iTunes Match, your entire library (up to 25.000) songs will be synced with your iCloud. So all your songs are in the iCloud. You can add a device to the iCloud and by so, all your music on the new device will be synced onto the new device. That's how iTunes Match works.\nIf you computer/hard drive gets stolen, you buy a new one and authorize it with you iCloud, it will sync once again on your new device. \nSo yes, you'll be able to download all your music stored in your iCloud onto new device. \nAs a matter of fact, even when the original device lost it's files, the songs are still stored in iCloud.\nBut be aware, the limit on devices is set on 10. So make sure you haven't add 10 devices already!\nEDIT:\nProof of this is on the iTunes Match-page\n\n", "Q: iMovie cannot load Sony-MPEG videos I recently moved from Windows to OS X, so maybe I'm asking a frequently-asked question. But I did some googling and didn't find a solution yet.\nI have a lot of videos on my drive from my SONY camera. The format is MPEG-2 Sony, which is not a standard MPEG-2 format.\nHow can I use these videos and import them on iMovie? Could QuickTime MPEG-2 Playback Component for Mac OS X help me? Or what else could I do?\nThanks everybody!\n\nA: Playing MPEG-2 videos in Quicktime\nPerian massively extends the amount of  formats Quicktime can play. It's free.\nImporting MPEG-2 in iMovie\nI'm not aware of any solution to that. But Handbrake can help you convert that video to a format that works with iMovie (.avi).\n\nA: if perian doesn't work, you can convert the files with mpeg streamclip and convert the files to quicktime dv or other flavors.\njust google mpeg streamclip, it`s free\n\nA: Usually, iMovie does allow the import of MPEG files. However, if MPEG (MPG) files are muxed (multiplexed) MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 video, iMovie will refuse to import the MPEG (MPG) files. Then you need to use some converter software to convert MPEG to iMovie compatible format for use in your iMovie project.\nThis article, which recommends my product, will show you how to convert MPEG to iMovie compatible format so as to successfully import MPEG into iMovie, import MPG to iMovie.\nHow to Import MPEG to iMovie\n", "Q: pmset standby is missing I have two Macbook Pros (10.7.2) and both are missing the standby option in pmset:\n$ pmset -g\nActive Profiles:\nBattery Power       -1\nAC Power        -1*\nCurrently in use:\n womp       1\n halfdim    1\n sms        1\n panicrestart   157680000\n gpuswitch  2\n hibernatefile  /var/vm/sleepimage\n networkoversleep   0\n disksleep  10\n sleep      180\n hibernatemode  3\n ttyskeepawake  1\n displaysleep   10\n acwake     0\n lidwake    1\n\n$ pmset -g cap\nCapabilities for AC Power:\n displaysleep\n disksleep\n sleep\n womp\n acwake\n lidwake\n halfdim\n sms\n gpuswitch\n\nI've seen this guy has this option:lion pmset standby\nAny ideas?\n\nA: From the pmset man page:\n\nSTANDBY ARGUMENTS\nstandby causes kernel power management to automatically hibernate a\n  machine after it has slept for a specified time period.

I bought a 240 GB SSD to replace the 500 GB primary HDD in my new MacBook Pro.\nHow do I clone the current Lion system image on my 500 GB HDD to the SSD? I want to clone the entire drive not just copy data.\nI can only have either the HDD or SSD in the MacBook Pro at a time. I have an external 500 GB USB drive that can I use if necessary. I've seen suggestions on using Carbon Copy Cloner but I'm not sure how to proceed with only one disk in the MacBook Pro at a time. \n\nA: So you can keep using your old 500GB HDD I would buy a cheap enclosure for it. They can be had with USB 2.0 for as little as $10.\nConcerning the Software-Side, neither SuperDuper nor Carbon Copy Cloner are bad. Personally I, however, prefer Apple's own Disk Utility.\nSimply boot from your Install DVD or Restore Partition (if you use Lion), holding down the ALT key while you power on your machine.\nBoth the Install DVD and the Restore Partition give you access to Disk Utility.\nThere simply hit the Restore tab and drag and drop your Source an Destination volume accordingly.\nIf you do not want to buy a new HDD enclosure simply clone your internal HDD to your spare external using the aforementioned way. Then replace your Book's HDD with the SSD. And clone everything back to it.\n\nA: SuperDuper http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper is also an awesome back-up product and can easily clone a drive making a bootable backup. You can use it for free for what you're trying to do, but it's worth every penny for the extra features.\n\nA: I am using the Migration Assistant on the old hard drive to migrate the data from a Time Machine backup to the new disk. It won't work for every situation (need USB enclosure, etc) - but it looks like it will work for me.\n\nA: I would try to open the enclosure of your external USB drive and replace it with the SSD to clone your data.\nSimple hard drive cloning using Carbon Copy Cloner\n\n*\n\n*Format the target drive with Disk Utiliy.app to Mac OS Extendend (Journaled) using the option Erase. This erases the drive and creates one partition across the entire disk.\n\n\n*Download and install Carbon Copy Cloner.\nBTW: Developers need to eat! Therefore, I suggest making a small donation to Mike Bombich via Paypal.\n\n\n*In CCC configure Source Disk: Macintosh HD and Target Disk: your_formatted_disk. For cloning options choose Backup everything in order to make the target bootable. The time for cloning varies. It took me 105min to clone a 250GB Hitachi to a 500GB Seagate.\n\n\n\n*Swap the hard drives and boot into your new hard drive. Repair your disk using Disk Utility.\nSource: credit to Mark West @ mac101.net\n\nA: Use Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC), I have used it in the past, it's great and free!\nThere is support on the website and tutorial videos.\n\nA: Ditch your optical drive and use a \"data doubler\" to keep your HDD in your MBP along with your SSD. I do this and keep all my heavy use files (OS, Xcode, ~/Library, Applications, etc.) on the SSD and then things like Movies, Music, and Pictures folders on the HDD. This way I can still buy a relatively small and inexpensive SSD but still have all the storage I need. When was the last time I needed to read a DVD? ha!\nI got my data doubler here: http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/drive_bracket/datadoubler/ and installed it myself pretty easily. Speed is now unbeatable and I still have endless storage.\nAs far as copying the data, I would make a disk image from your current hard drive to external using Disk Utility. Then use Disk Utility again to put it onto the SSD from external. Just keep in mind that you can't image a disk that you booted from, so you might have to install Lion onto the SSD temporarily to boot from while you create your image.\n\nA: Some SSDs makers will sell it as an upgrade kit. It includes the SSD and SATA to USB adapter. You'll need to purchase the USB adapter. Plug it in and let carbon copy cloner do the rest.\n\nA: I had an issue going from a large drive to a smaller SSD, even after deleting files. I found out it was because of the Lion MobileBackup volume. I turned off this feature and let it clear the files, then restarted, then I was able to make the move.\n", "Q: How to remove scratches from 5th generation iPod? I own a 5th generation iPod with a lot of scratches on its acrylic-like surface and display that I'd like to be removed (please note it's not a touch-screen iPod). What should I buy (preferentially on eBay) and how should I wipe all those scratches away to keep my iPod as polished as possible?\n\nA: I found on this site Repair iPod Scratches yourself Cheaply that you can use something called Brasso to clean the back of it. It has a mild abrasive in oil. it will cost you about 5 dollars. Then to clean the face, either a microfiber cloth or a t-shirt.\nEDIT:\nYou could try Ice Creme its designed for iPods and Macs (or so it says).\n\nA: Using a CD scratch repair kit worked for me. One cloth had a mild solvent which softened the area and a buffing cloth to help remove surface scratches. \n\nA: I have heard screen klean is a great touch screen cleaner. Also, a good rule for touch devices is not to use anything alcohol based!\n\nA: I have had success using the compounds from TDI-LLC in removing scratches from my 5th Gen. iPod as well as my HTC Evo 4G device.  As far as \"creative\" scratch removal methods, they have received mixed reviews and usually contain a warning in trying those methods.  I decided to go with a solution that seemed more tried and true and have been pleased with the results on more than one occasion.

I used Migration Assistant to transfer a user account from one MacBook to another.\nHowever, the user that got migrated is not available as a login option on the new Macbook?\nIf I go into settings I can see the user account is there.   And if I change it to auto-login using the new migrated account that works.\nBut if I don't use auto-login I can't login with this migrated user.  Also, I can't do fast-user switching to this new user either.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Did you happen to have FileVault enabled on the target (new) machine before initiating migration assistant?  I've run into where I needed to go into the FileVault section of the security system preferences and explicitly enable the migrated user before they would appear as a login option...\n", "Q: Is there software that allows me to use my Macbook Pro as a second monitor for iMac? I'd like to do monitor spanning with my Macbook Pro next to my iMac, I haven't really found a good solution, anyone use anything they can recommend? I'm using Lion. Thanks.\n\nA: I personally use AirDisplay for this purpose, as it is the only application that I have found that enables the secondary screen to be able to display video or other high frame rate objects at a reasonable speed.\nI have also experimented highly with Screen Recycler as well as just strait VNC which is included with the OS, however my issue with those has been with tearing of visual elements when dragging windows as well as the inability to show videos, keynotes, websites or even scroll word documents and have the second display appear fluid.\n\nA: I've never tried it personally but the only software that I know of that claims to do this is \"ScreenRecycler.\" They have a Lion version currently in beta.\nHere's a link.\n\nA: From experience in the retail environment I know that the computers would both need thunderbolt connections. I also found an article on apple's website that gives step by step intructions on how to connect two computers together and use one as a screen for another. \nI hope this helps. \n\nA: I've used ScreenRecycler as well.  More recently, AirDisplay has also been working working reasonably well for me, the advantage being interoperability between Mac, iOS, and Windows machines.\n", "Q: Transfer reminders from iCal to Google Calendar I switched from iCloud to Google calendar. I already transferred all my calendars via export/import to Google Calendar. Now I'd like to transfer my reminders from iCal/iCloud to Google Calendar. How can I do this?\n\nA: From what I understand, Reminders are not transferrable. Each service programs them differently and there is no way (other than copying/pasting text) to easily transfer them. Hope this helps.\n\nA: This script will at least help with the export from Reminders:\n#!/usr/bin/osascript\n\ntell application \"Reminders\"\n    set todo_accounts to every account\n    -- accounts have lists. loop thru accounts to get their lists.\n    repeat with i from 1 to length of todo_accounts\n        tell account i\n            set todo_lists to get every list\n            -- lists have reminders. loop thru lists to get their reminders\n            repeat with j from 1 to length of todo_lists\n                tell list j\n                    set todos to (get reminders)\n                    -- if there are no reminders for a list, then ignore the list\n                    if length of todos is greater than 0 then\n                        -- Write out the name of the list\n                        do shell script \"echo \" & (quoted form of (get name)) & \" >> ~/Desktop/todos.txt\"\n                        -- loop thru the reminders to get properties\n                        repeat with k from 1 to length of todos\n                            set this_todo to item k of todos\n                            if (this_todo is not completed) then\n                                do shell script \"echo [  ] \" & (quoted form of (get name of this_todo)) & \" >> ~/Desktop/todos.txt\"\n                            end if\n                        end repeat\n                    end if\n                end tell\n            end repeat\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Is it safe to buy MacBook Pro batteries on eBay? My 15\" MacBook Pro 5.1 (late 2008) battery is inflating to the point of nearly breaking the unibody battery cover, so I'm really into replacing it as soon as possible. There are loads of these batteries on eBay (mostly UK sellers with high reputation) that cost less than half of the price I'd have to pay for a battery on a local Apple reseller store.\nMy question is: is it safe to purchase batteries for MacBook Pros on eBay? Are there any known issues or ripoffs that I should know of?\n\nA: Another option for longer term (after you have determined why the battery is expanding like it is) may be to see about getting one of the Newer Tech (or other known manufacturer) batteries for your MBP, as they have longer life ratings for the charge. Newer Tech is available from Other World Computing (www.macsales.com), and I've seen it from a few other online sites as well. (I do not work for OWC, but have been very pleased with their products and service) The NewerTech ones I've checked on are rated at higher mA ratings than the original Apple batteries. \n\nA: I've purchased new Macbook Pro batteries twice from Ebay Powersellers. Both had the same capacity or slightly higher. My MBP is has the model identifier 3,1.\n\n\n*\n\n*The transaction went fine both times.\n\n*After a few weeks of usage I gave good feedback as there were not problems with the battery..... that was two early:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first battery expanded too much. It would still fit into the MBP, but the dent affects my MBP in a way that I cannot click with the touchpad when using this battery.\n\n*The second battery dropped it's capacity to 67% after only 20 cycles.\nI ended up purchasing an original battery. The end.\n\nA: That depends on the product. I have gotten both good and bad batteries on eBay.\nIf it comes from China, Japan, Korea, or any other Asian country, it may very well be a fake. I have ordered several from those countries, and most of them ended up not even being detected by my MacBook.\nFilter the listing so it only shows auctions within your own country. Check the seller's ratings and their reviews from previous sales of the same product. Finally, make sure they have a good return policy in case your battery doesn't work.\nAs for the name-brand vs. off-brand question, you can get good off-brand batteries, and bad name-brand batteries. It's like gambling, but the chances are closer to 50/50.\n\nA: I would go to your local Apple Store right away as a past Apple Genius that would be replaced in most cases your battery should never do that.'\nYou can also call 1-800-MY-APPLE and talk to Apple Care reps tell them you are afraid it's dangerous, It will get taken care of.\n\nA: Actually, that's pretty normal for an old battery or a battery that's been used heavily.  AppleCare may replaced your battery under a Customer Satisfaction Code, but that depends on the mood of the AppleCare representative that you talk to at the time.\nIf your MacBook Pro is still in warranty and you take it to an Apple Store with a third-party battery I highly doubt they'll do any repairs under warranty - Apple is pretty tight regarding third-party components.\nI'd avoid getting a third-party battery and just stick with one you buy from an Apple Store or an Apple Authorised Reseller.\n\nA: Old question, but since other people may stumble here: I suggest buying on amazon.co.uk, and search for some brands that are already known for their batteries in another fields/products like Anker: avoid completely no brands from ebay.\n", "Q: How to get photos to sync in order on iPhone? I understand how to sync photos to my iPhone but they seem to be placed on the phone in a rather random order. I've tried numerous changes to the photos but they don't appear to be organized by date, size, or alphabetically by name.  Am I missing something?\n\nA: They are sorted in order of EXIF creation date, which is not necessarily the same as the Date Created shown by the finder. \nYou can use exiftool to view and also set these dates to sort your images...\nexiftool -overwrite_original_in_place -CreateDate=\"2008:12:18 12:34:56.78\"  MyImage.JPG\n\n\nA: When you sync with iTunes, sync them into a specific folder and always use this folder. and Don't change their order and select in iTunes Sync Photos.\n", "Q: Inflated Music Size on iPhone when Syncing Frequently when I sync my iPhone to my iMac, the size bar will report that the amount of music on my phone is nearly double what it actually is (confirmed with a manual check). The phone will usually report that it is over capacity, but I can still copy applications and more music to it (as I should be able to). This doesn't happen on every sync, and sometimes when the sync is completed, it will shrink back down to the correct size. It's a major annoyance and makes it hard for me to see how much space I actually have used/free on my phone.\n\nA: I have found that it is related to iTunes Match. If you turn off iTunes Match on the iPhone, the iPhone will no longer register as over capacity. \n\nA: I had similar problem. \n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off iTunes Match, and make sure \"manually manage music\" is checked as an option when connecting the iPhone to your computer.\n\n*Remove all music from phone manually via iTunes.\n\n*Enable iTunes Match again and you should be all set with a cleared device and no more confusion.\n", "Q: What is a good, inexpensive HTML editor with FTP support? I just finished the two-week trial of Coda, and I really like it. The only issue is, I am a student, and the $99 license fee is a bit over my budget.\nI do a lot of work on live sites, and an IDE with built-in FTP support really makes my workflow much faster. \nMy question is: Are there any free or cheap web code IDEs that have built-in FTP support? I have used TextWrangler, and that works passably. However, I would like something with an interface a bit more like Coda or HTML-Kit.\n\nA: Aptana Studio, based on Eclipse, has support for additional protocols, not just FTP. It's free.\n\nA: you could try Espresso (79 $) which is similar to Coda.\nI use Flow (FTP) which has the ability to edit code directly in the app and to preview in real time. but there is no syntax highlighting or so.\nAlso I use Fraise which is my basic css/html/php editing program.\nHope that helps.\n\nA: Well, if you are going for free, I would suggest Eclipse. It is a very powerful editor, just a bit on the ugly side if you ask me.\nAs far as cheap goes, I would suggest BBEdit.  It is currently $50, but it is one of those tools that is well worth the money.  I use that almost exclusively for all of my development work.\n", "Q: Different iTunes region and App updates I've moved house from the UK to Ireland so now am in a different iTunes region. I have changed store and registered new payment details so I can properly use iTunes again.\nBUT, all of my App updates via the iTunes store are blocked. The Apps on the iOS devices themselves are fine and can be updated one by one but not at all through iTunes. \nThe Apps I'm interested in are available in both the original and new region App Stores so there should be no licensing issues, particularly since the updates are allowed on the iOS device itself.\nUpdates to my Mac software through the Mac App Store are also fine now.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Each account can only be set to one region.  According to the knowledgebase article below, one should be able to change the region on an account.  Since this process doesn't seem to have worked properly in your case, I'd suggest contacting iTunes support.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1311\nHowever, you could have two iTunes accounts; a UK account and an Irish account.  The advantage here is that you don't have to worry about a previous UK purchase not being available in the Irish store.\nTo get an iTunes account in a country in which you do not reside (and therefore do not have an address or credit card from that country), you could purchase an iTunes gift card from the country in question and follow the instructions in the\nHow to redeem an iTunes Gift Card on a computer > I do not have an iTunes Store account\nsection of the following knowledgebase article:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1574\nYou will need to authorize both accounts in the Store menu in iTunes.  Once both accounts are authorized, you should be able to update the apps you purchased with your UK account as well as any new apps you purchase with your Irish account.\nOn your iOS devices, however, you can only be logged in to one iTunes account at a time (Settings app > Store > Apple ID).  On the device, over the air, you can only update the apps associated with the currently logged in account.\nI hope this is helpful.\n", "Q: Restore PDF to Evernote service in Lion Anyone knows how to restore the print PDF to Evernote in Lion 10.7.2? \n\nA: This was a commonly discussed issue on the Evernote message boards when Lion debuted.  I've seen all sorts of \"fixes\" including hacking an old version of Evernote.  Fortunately, there's a much easier option.\n\n\n*\n\n*Print something\n\n*Choose \"Edit Menu...\" from the PDF menu in the Print dialog\n\n*Click the \"+\" button then navigate to Evernote, highlight it and click \"Choose\"\n\n*You will now have an option called \"Evernote\" in the PDF menu in all of your system print dialogs.

I myself am using a VPN service. I have heard of free ones, but i find the paid ones more reliable, speedy, and user friendly. Most of these services have a guide for setting up the VPN settings on the iOS device. VPN is set up in Settings -> General -> Network -> VPN.\nWhen using a VPN solution, all internet traffic on the iOS device will be goning through the chosen IP adress (for you, this should be one from the US).\nHope this helped :)\n\nA: I have been using HideMyAss VPN service for a few months and it is great. It is also a paid subscription but uses Tunnelblick client which is light and I just keep it connected at all times and have no performance issues either. You can select your VPN server also and they have servers available all over the world.\nIt's not only great for accessing geoblocked websites but great for just privacy in general.\n\nA: You want to use a VPN, either on the iOS device directly (it has this option in the Network settings), or on your Mac (and then share the VPN via WiFI Internet Sharing).\nI use AceVPN. They also have a UK endpoint, so that you can watch BBC.\n\nA: Beware of hidemyass! It is well documented they cooperate with law enforcement. If you are going to use a privacy service, choose one thats been around for 15+ years, before being anonymosu was cool. Only two services come to mind. Ultimate-Anonymity.com and Cotse.net\n\nA: You might want to take a look at using the personalVPN Pro service from Witopia.net. Their service is excellent and you could use the VPN to tunnel traffic through a U.S. based server. Check out their services here: https://www.witopia.net/products/\n\nA: Personally, I always preferred to host my own smart DNS/proxy and selectively forward DNS requests for sites like Hulu, Netflix, etc. to it. Traditional VPNs (if you respect the terminology) are not the right solution for streaming video since they essentially proxy everything by routing all traffic to your VPN server.\nIdeally, you want to proxy only the web/application traffic via another location and leave the video/audio traffic to  be delivered to you from the closest CDN PoP, which certainly won't be the case if you try to access the likes of akamai.com from the UK via your US server.\nAnyway, I've spent some time recently trying to get Hulu Plus going in the UK, but this should work on any geo-blocked site in theory.\nIn case anyone is interested the full write-up is here:\nhttp://anton.belodedenko.me/watch-hulu-plus-outside-of-the-us/\nGood luck!\n-- ab1\n", "Q: MacBook Pro printing fails with an Epson printer I am unable to print from my MacBook pro to an Epson 5500 proof printer.\nThe printer works with an old G4 Mac. But it stubbornly refuses to work from the MacBook running Lion. The computer knows the Epson is there and allows the setup procedure. However when I send a file, the print status goes to Printing  and then almost immediately to Ready, suggesting that the job has been completed.\nThe printer only has a USB interface. I have tried different cables, but all to no avail. I have even sent the same file from the G4 and the PowerBook.\nAny suggestions please? Yes I do have a driver for it.\nThanks\nMike\n\nA: Have you tried sharing the printer from the G4 box? This could be a case where the older system is running a set of printer drivers which work well with the printer, but the newer system has either those specific drivers removed, or they just don't work correctly.\nTo do this, on your G4 box, go to System Preferences > Printer, and select the printer you are trying to do. In there, there should be a checkbox that says \"Share this Printer\". Once you have done that, you should be able to see it in your print dialogs through Bonjour.\nSee if that helps. \n\nA: Unfortunately, I think you're out of luck.\nLooking at Epson's website, it doesn't seem that Epson ever wrote a driver for Intel-based Macs for this printer.  Epson's last driver release for this printer was in 2004 for Tiger on PowerPC Macs.\nThe printer is at least ten years old, and I know its probably not what you want to hear, but I think it's time for a new printer.  As you've already encountered, you can't get software support any longer, and if you need parts and/or ink, they're likely to be in short supply.\nI hope this is helpful.\n", "Q: How can others connect to port 80 on my computer via an IP address? I'd like to be able to give certain people my IP address (24.178.XX.XX) so they can access port 80 on my machine from their browser.\nRight now just putting that IP address from my own browser doesn't connect to anything...just says it can't find the server.\nSo is there some setting I need to enable?\nI have an AirPort Extreme.\n\nA: Within the Airport Utility, you have an option for Port Forwarding (or even setting up a DMZ Host if you want all unsolicited incoming traffic to go to your web server, however this is unadvised for general security as it is best to only allow what you need to reduce attack vectors).\nUsing this option, you can set up a port mapping between port 80 on your external interface to port 80 on the NAT IP address of your internal web server.\nThis will provide immediate access to your server over port 80 to the outside world.\nThat however assumes that you already have a web server properly configured to deliver data over port 80.\nA good first step there would be to use the Web Sharing setting under \"System Perferences -> Sharing\" to see whether this meets your needs. It will also enable you to do an immediate test to make sure that everything is working.\nIf you need something a little more comprehensive than what you are provided within the OS X client, look at OS X Server ($50 on the App Store) or MAMP (free and paid offerings).\n\nA: You can use iptables to redirect user to port 80 when they open your IP on \ntheir system\nEg. It will redirect the requests on port from 8080 to 80. Since to access the port below 1024 you need to be super user. So, you can allow the user to connect to port 8080 and redirect to port 80\n/sbin/iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8080 -j REDIRECT --to-port 80\n\n\nA: lets make some assumptions - since you're using port 80, you want web traffic...\nyou need to run a web server on your computer that will be listening on port 80, thats the default port for web traffic.\ngood examples are MAMP - http://www.mamp.info/\n", "Q: Can I access 10.6 Server network/mobile accounts on a Lion client machine? I have a Mac Pro running 10.6.8 Server and a MacBook Pro (Mid 2010) running Lion 10.7.2. I would like to configure a mobile account for my wife to use. The idea is that she'll be able to access her user account locally on the server using Fast User Switching, but be able to log into the same account on my MacBook Pro and have the home folder sync through a mobile account. \nI was able to do this when my Mac Pro had Lion Server on it, but I downgraded to Snow Leopard Server because Lion Server caused a lot of issues and dropped several key features from Snow Leopard Server. \nRight now, I have her account configured to Create Mobile Account at Login. I am able to log into the account locally, but if I attempt to log into the account from the MacBook Pro, it says \"Unable to log into account at this time\". \nI have the user account's home directory on a separate drive. The correct directory is set in Workgroup Manager, and the Users directory is set as an automounting share in Server Admin>AFP. The user I'm trying to log into has Read/Write access to the Users directory and the home folder, as well as ownership of the home folder. \nThe MacBook Pro is joined to the OD server through System Preferences>User Accounts>Login Options>Network Account Server. The MacBook Pro is also added as a computer and is in a computer group in Workgroup Manager.\nIs there something I'm missing to configure this mobile account to be able to log in?\n\nA: It should work.  When the user tries to login, do you see any errors in the system.log or secure.log? \nHave you tried to completely delete the account from the local computer, unbind it from the server, rebind, restart and try to login again? (of course backup first)\n\nA: You probably have moved on from this in the past three years; but for posterity, here is another possible solution. Check the directory server status in the 10.7 machine's Accounts preference pane. It may be red, since you reset everything on the server when going back to 10.6. If so, just remove it and add it back again and the login problem should go away. \n", "Q: Lost all my iPhone contacts I wanted to send my iPhone contacts to Google mail and transfer back to my new Samsung Android.\nAfter changing iTunes setting \"sync address book contact\"-> \"sync google contact\", no new contact appear in my new Google Mail account and all my contacts on iPhone have been ERASED.\nWhy has this happened?\n\nA: You have changed the settings in iTunes to sync from Google contacts rather than sync from Address Book, so iTunes has done exactly that. It synced your Google contacts to your phone, and replaced the ones you already had.\n\nA: What you have done is chosen to include \"only\" your Google Contacts for syncing with your iPhone via the iTunes sync.\nWhat I would recommend is that you look at setting up the Google Calendar sync within the Address Book application on your computer, and then copy the records manually between accounts (either via a drag and drop or copy and paste) on your computer.\nOnce this is done, the contacts on your computer should reside on your Google Contacts, as well as be synced back to your iPhone the next time you sync it with iTunes.\nAdditionally, you can set up your gmail account under your iPhone using the Microsoft Exchange connector (server name: m.google.com) with your Google credentials, after which your contacts will automatically be synced between your iPhone and Android devices without having to sync via your computer.\n", "Q: MacBook won't sleep while charging An ongoing problem:  my MacBook Pro (i5, 2.4ghz, 15\") won't sleep while charging. I close the lid, but I don't get the pulsing \"sleep light\", it just stays fully illuminated. If I listen closely, I can hear hard drive/fan activity. \nThis has been a problem since purchasing the machine in June of 2010. In retrospect, I should've taken it to the Genius Bar, but I was confident that an eventual system update would fix the problem... it hasn't.  I even wiped the machine clean and reinstalled Lion (due to so me stability issues with the initial release of Lion), and that helped... for a while.  Now the problem is back.  I've even tried a different MacBook charger to no avail. \nI've researched this issue before but none of the solutions that users suggested have worked (including various 'pmset' commands and also tinkering with EnergySaver settings). Any advice?\n\nA: You may want to look into the sharing options as well as any other programs that may be keeping the computer awake.  If you exit all running programs (you may want to consider checking programs that are running in the background as well) and turn off all sharing under 'System Preferences' -> 'Sharing' and close the lid does it still exhibit the same problems.\n\nA: I know you've tried similar things, but hopefully with a few more details this will work for you. Please note: using pmset -g for troubleshooting this problem is about getting information, it doesn't actually make changes.\nIn the Terminal, run\npmset -g assertions\n\nYou should see something like:\n16/08/13 1:24:58 PM GMT+\nAssertion status system-wide:\n   PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep             0\n   CPUBoundAssertion                       0\n   DisableInflow                           0\n   ChargeInhibit                           0\n   PreventSystemSleep                      0\n   PreventUserIdleSystemSleep              1\n   ExternalMedia                           0\n   DisableLowPowerBatteryWarnings          0\n   EnableIdleSleep                         1\n   NoRealPowerSources_debug                0\n   UserIsActive                            0\n   ApplePushServiceTask                    0\n\nListed by owning process:\n  pid 7928: [0x00001ef8012c14ca] PreventUserIdleSystemSleep named: \"there are active torrents\"\n\nKernel Assertions: None\n\nIf it includes PreventUserIdleSystemSleep              1, then there is some software that is preventing the sleep. The section Listed by owning process: shows relevant processes, which you can kill if necessary (e.g. kill process with id 7928 by running kill -9 7928).\nThis solved the problem for me. There were two relevant processes: Internet Sharing and a BitTorrent client. With sharing disabled, the sleep on lid close functionality was restored. I left the BitTorrent client running (and therefore PreventUserIdleSystemSleep remained set), because I don't actually want it to sleep when idle, just when I ask it to.\nI found the solution here.\n\nA: I would recommend trying both an SMC (System Management Controller) and PRAM (Parameter RAM) reset.\n\n\n*\n\n*For the SMC reset, shut down your computer and leave the charger plugged in. Once your machine is completely shut down, press the ⇧+ctrl+⌥+power button keys at the same time for about 2 seconds. What you should see is your charger light change from orange to green back to orange when you let go. When you see the lights switch colors like this, your SMC has been reset. \n\n*To reset the PRAM, shut down your computer. Press the power button and immediately press and hold the ⌘+⌥+P+R  keys until you hear the startup chime sound twice. After the second time, you can let go and your machine will boot normally. \n\n\nYou can do both the SMC reset and the PRAM simultaneously if you like. \nTry this and let us know what happens. \n\nA: Go into System Preferences > Sharing and turn off Internet Sharing and File Sharing.\nYou can run pmset -g assertions again in terminal and you will see the 1 is gone that counts. After restarting your computer it will go to sleep while plugged in now.\n", "Q: How can I change the playlists/songs on my phone? I have 43GB of music in iTunes Match on my iMac, and only 5GB available on my iPhone. (8750 songs, 51 Playlists)\nBefore iTunes Match I could select/deselect playlists then sync and thus change the playlists on my phone. \nNow with Match, if I delete songs within a playlist from the Phone they disappear, no way to reload them. If I delete a playlist on the phone it deletes from iMac/iTunes, thats not good either.\nSo how can I rotate the songs on my phone without deleting from the iMac/iTunes or losing songs in any way?\n\nA: You say you have iTunes Match? What I understand from your question is that you want to edit your playlists adding/deleting or you just want to pick specific playlists to have on your iPhone, I'll explain both. \nIf you deleted a song from your playlist simply scroll up or down till you see edit/clear/delete. Hit edit then the + icon to add songs, or readd them if you deleted them. Clear will delete all the songs in that playlist without deleting the playlist itself. Delete will delete all the songs and the playlist itself.\nIf you're hoping to be able to add a couple of playlists for example a\" work out\" playlist and a \"commute\" playlist on your phone but leave the \"dance\" playlist on your computer, you can't. The whole idea of iTunes Match is that you have ALL of your music, playlist and whatnot. The idea is that when you make any change even if it's just moving a song from the bottom to the top of your playlist, it will show up on all your devices. \nI hope that helps let me know if it doesn't and I'll try and help out if I can!\nDanny\n", "Q: Can't sync purchased video to iPhone I am unable to sync purchased tv shows from my MacBook pro to my iPhone 4.\nInstead I get an error: \n  \n\n(show name) was not synced to \"My iPhone\" because you are not\n  authorized for it on this computer\n\nThis seems to be the same problem- but with a movie\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/16794815#16794815\n\nA: In the \"Store\" menu in iTunes, choose \"Authorize this computer...\" then enter the credentials for the iTunes account you used to buy the movie.\nIf you have done this and still get this error message, then something in that file or your iTunes account is broken.  In this case, you will need to contact iTunes support: http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/contact/\nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: Mail 5.1 - Mark as unread bug? If I am currently on email \"A\" and I right click on another email within the same account (email \"B\"), and \"Mark as unread,\" the message shows it is marked as unread for a split second, then marks as read once the reading pane switched to that email (not my intention, this just happens - the switching that is).\nIn Snow Leopard, I was able to click on any email in the message list, and mark as whatever, while not having to switch to that email in order for the mark as unread to stick.\n\nA: Yes, that looks like a bug. Just use the menu (Message > Signal As... > Unread), the keyboard (⇧⌘U) or add the read/unread buttons to the toolbar\n\nA: You can also try to decrease the delay threshold to zero. That worked for me.\nPerform the following on your Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.Mail MarkAsReadDelay 0\n\nBut you should report this to apple as well since it definately looks like a bug.\n", "Q: When syncing photos to iPhone or iPad through iTunes from Aperture, it syncs the wrong (original) versions. Why? I have an album, let's call it \"Europe Trip 2011\" within which, in Aperture, I have done at least some degree of editing to all of its pictures (exposure, saturation, curves, etc).  As we all know, Aperture works off of \"versions\" of a file.  So, my edited photos are all newer versions of the original.\nWell, problem is, once I've finished the editing, I close Aperture, then open iTunes (in this order, to make sure everything is \"updated\" upon close & open).  Then, I select the usual \"sync photos...from Aperture\" within the iPhone or iPad window on iTunes.  Then, I find the \"Europe Trip 2011\" album, select it, and commence syncing.\niTunes does in fact sync all of the correct photos, in order, etc.  Problem is, it only syncs with the original, un-edited versions.  So, now I have all of my pics on my iPhone or iPad, but none of them are edited.  They are all the originals.  Which is…semi-helpful, but not what I'm shooting for.\nI have taken every step I could think of so far to address this discrepancy including: \"Update Previews\" and \"Share previews with iLife and iWork: Always\" in Aperture.\nThoughts and/or suggestions?   Thanks!\n\nA: If all your edited photos are new versions of the original, then I'm guessing you've got Aperture set to create new versions when you make adjustments (that's an option in Preferences).  In that case, then each photo is probably in a stack with all of its versions.  Generally, only the \"pick\" (or top) of each stack is synced with your iOS device.  So you need to go through your album and move all the edited versions to the top of their stacks.\nTo do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your album in Aperture\n\n*In the Stacks menu, choose Open All Stacks\n\n*For each of the stacks in the album, choose the version you want and choose \"Pick\" under the Stacks menu.  This will make the chosen version jump to the far left of the group.\n\n*\n\n*I might be wrong on the name of that command, but I believe the shortcut for it is Command-\\.  That's what I usually use, instead of the menu option.\n\n\n\nYou can then re-sync your device, and the proper versions should show up.  You might want to try it with one or two of them to make sure it works before doing it for all of them.\nAdditionally, you might want to turn off the option to create new versions for each adjustment.  It'll mitigate this problem in the future.  Aperture uses non-destructive editing anyway, so you're not making irreversible changes to the original no matter what.  If you want to make multiple versions of a photo, you can do it manually with the Duplicate Version command (in the right-click menu on a photo, or somewhere in the menu options at the top).\n\nA: (I would add this as a comment, but I don't have an \"Add comment\" tag.)\nWhat seems to be happening is that aperture is not applying the edits to the image on sync.  The obvious question, asked only because it's obvious:  Are you using the current version of Aperture?  \nA work-around solution:\nA:  Give each photo you want to export a keyword tag.  E.g. 'sync'.\nB:  Create a smart folder that holds \"all photos with keyword 'sync'\"\nC:  Navigate to that folder, select all, and Export -> Versions.  You can also specify a reduced resolution more suitable for the device here.  Export these to a folder outside of Aperture.  \nD:  Syncronize folders from THAT folder to yoiur iDevice instead of from Aperture.\nBy using the sync keyword, you can add pix from any part of your Aperture Library.  With the Smart folder, they are all in one place for export.\n", "Q: How can I change the iTunes login for my iPad? I am giving my iPad to my wife. How do I change the current itune login which is my ID to my wife's itune ID so she can perform the updates or download any apps? \n\nA: This is easily done form the iPad itself, you can just enter the iTunes or AppStore app on the iPad, scroll to the bottom of the frontpage, and press the button labeled \"Apple ID:[your email here]\". A box will pop up, where you can choose to log out of the currently logged in Apple ID. You will then be able to press the same button again, and then log in with your wife's ID.\nGood luck :)\n\nA: Go to the Settings app.\nTap \"Store\".\nScroll down to \"Apple ID:your.appleid@domain.ext\" and tap it.\nChoose \"Sign Out\".\nYour wife will be able to go to the same location and sign in with her Apple ID.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: It would be better in the long run to deauthorise and reset the iPad to factory settings and have her \"set up\" the iPad as new from within her iTunes.\nNo cruft, all the apps (especially mail, calendars and iCloud integration) would be clean.  \n", "Q: Can Apple calendar (that comes with the iPod touch) re-order tasks?

Is it possible to change the order of songs in a playlist on the iPhone?  For example, if they are originally sorted alphabetically by \"Artist\", can I change the song order of the playlist so that the songs are sorted by \"Date Added\"?\n\nA: Im sorry, but in my knowlege there is no way to change the sorting in the way that you describe. The only close solution that i know of would be to edit the playlist manually, by pressing the \"Edit\" button in the top of the playlist, press and hold the three gray stripes on the right side of a chosen song title, and move it to its intended location within the playlist.\n\nA: There is a round about way to do this.  First, go to the playlist you want to sort and sort it.  Next crate a new playlist.  Leave it titled as playlist for now.

Without being near the machine it's difficult to diagnose, but if Finder, Disk Utility and Dock are freezing it's probably when your machine is trying to access a file on the hard disk and failing. Try a Verify from the Disk Utility 'First Aid' screen. If you can hear a clicking sound coming from your hard drive it could be an indication of a hardware fault. If you have an alternative hard drive you could try using, see if you get the same symptoms.\nOne last thing - make sure you have an up-to date backup! If the drive does fail you'll want a backup handy. I'll assume you have a backup because you said you just did a blank install.\n\nA: Run /Applications/Utilities/Console.app and check system.log.\nLook especially for entries that say something like disk4s3: I/O error. If you see that, then your hard drive is failing.\nSince you did a re-install, I assume you have everything backed up.  If not, try to cool the computer down as best you can, either by raising the fan speeds or even putting a cold pack under it, and perform a backup.\nThe following article has detailed instructions for how to limp the drive along or possibly restore it: Hard Drive Recovery.  But if you already did a clean install and are still seeing I/O errors in the logs, it is most likely not recoverable.\n\nA: Couple of questions - when your computer freezes, are you still able to move the mouse but everything else is frozen?

I've searched the App Market and haven't found anything. Thanks.\n\nA: Not without Jailbraking. App-Store restrictions prevent any application developers from changing hardware settings.

I lost my mail whoosh after updating to 10.7.2\nI resolved it by going into mail preferences, general tab & changing the sounds to \"none\" and unchecking \"play sounds for other mail actions\".\nThen I quit mail from the top menu bar. I restarted mail, went back into preferences did the opposite: changed sounds to \"new messages sound\" and checked \"play sounds for other mail actions\", I then quit mail again from the top menu and then reopened it. Magically, my whoosh was back.\nI don't know why it went away after updating. And I don't know why this fixed it, but it did.\n\nA: The whoosh disappeared from mail and I finally figured out that it was because I had earphones plugged into the Audio line-in port. I pulled that plug and the whoosh was restored.\n\nA: I too had lost me 'whoosh' after upgrading to Mountain Lion, but got it back by quitting and re-launching Mail.\nRe-launching Mail has not proved the solution to another Mail-related problem, however.

I sent her a Canon Airprint-compatible printer which is visible/usable on her wireless network by a desktop PC and a netbook, but not visible by the iPad. After trying software updates and power cycling without success, we finally determined that her Actiontec router is not Bonjour compatible. We're about to replace her router, but I thought I'd check to see if there might be a cheaper solution to be found here. \n\nA: I don't know if it will work, mostly because the product hasn't been released yet but xPrintServer might work. It is a bit pricey for this usage though.\n\nA: Just thought I'd check- I assume she only has one wireless network? (at 90, I'd be surprised if not, but you never know!)\nI have problems with both AirPrint and AirPlay on my network if the devices that are attempting to connect are connected through different routers.\n\nA: Bonjour is a special form of DNS broadcasting - perhaps if you reset the router to default DNS settings. If you're running multiple subnets for any reason (I doubt so for a 90 year old, but you never know) this will also cause the printer to only be available on one subnet. You'd likely have multiple subnets if you have more than one router.\n", "Q: How do I send someone a normal text if they also use iMessage? My brother has a Windows Phone, and an iPad.

Now, when you select your buddy, you should be able to select the phone number or the email address (since that is what your friend is probably using for iMessage).  Select the phone number and it should send it to his Windows Phone instead of his iPad.\n\nA: \n\nA: Tap and hold the Send button for about 3 seconds and iMessage will switch to text message.\n\nA: compose a new message, start typing your brother's name in the box, select his cellphone number.\n", "Q: Screensaver in Lion I like to use events and albums from iPhoto as my screensavers.

My family shares an apple ID, and I can't chose whose contacts I want to sync with when I set up Icloud. For example, I own a Mac and an iPhone. I want my content to only be synced between MY Mac and MY iPhone. Instead, everything including my contacts gets jumbled and duplicated together with my parents' pc and my families' iPhones. Because of this, I have three different instances of my sister in my contact book. My moms version my version and my other sisters version.\nDoes anyone have advice on how we should go about organizing out content and apple ID?\n\nA: My family's system consists of using a shared Apple ID to buy from iTunes and the Mac App Store.  Each member then has their own iCloud account based on a unique email address for Mail & Notes, Contacts, and Calendars. \nOn the iPhone: everyone should enter the shared Apple ID under the Settings/Store/Apple ID section for purchases.  Each user can then enter their own iCloud for all other data in Settings/iCloud.  \nOn the Mac:  everyone should authorize their iTunes and Mac App Store accounts under the shared Apple ID by signing in under the Store menu in iTunes and Mac App Store. Each user can enter their own iCloud account for all other data under System Preferences/iCloud.\nFor both iPhone and Mac:  My family shares calendars. If you want to share Mail & Notes, Contacts, or Calendars, add the person's iCloud account to Settings or System Preferences/Mail, Contacts & Calendars.  Then choose what you want to share.  \n\nA: I have finally formulated a solution for the \"sharing families\".  Please comment if you find inaccuracies or if you can enhance this solution.\n1. Mail, Calendar, Contacts, and Notes:\nSince 2 years before iOS 5, we have been using some of the functionalities seamlessly across the family.  Seems like, we will have to continue with this set up.  We have been using what Neil Trodden describes in this answer.  Establish a \"family shared account\" on sites such as Google, Yahoo, etc. (we use Google) for mail, calendar, contacts, and notes.  PS: Contacts and calendar are set up as \"Exchange\" and the mail and notes are set up as \"IMAP\".  Works like a charm -- as soon as one device adds/updates a contact -- all others have the latest!  Calendar entries show on all devices instantly so that family engagements are never double booked and grocery lists (and other notes) are instantly updated across the devices.  Hassle free, hands free, as it should be.\nBesides the \"family shared account\", we each have our own employer's accounts (email, calendar, contacts, etc) that are setup the way the employer's systems want.  Any additional personal emails can be setup the same way.\n2. Music, Apps, Photos, Documents\nIf a family does not share these, what else will they?  If you think of 5GB times 4 devices = 20 GB free, that is the thinking block.  Just set up 5GB times 1 free account and enter that information into all devices.  The devices will happily share the photos and documents.  You probably already had one iTunes account with credit card etc for app purchases, you might as well use that same id to keep things simple.\nNow one would ask if single ID works for these 4, why not use the same for mail, calendar, contacts and notes?  Answer is you could if 5GB is sufficient for 4 or 6 people.  There is some complication about iCloud trying to copy all email accounts to other devices and interfering with the employer's appropriate use policy if you have employer email/calendar showing on one of your devices.\n3. Bookmarks and Reminders:\nI have found no way to conveniently share the bookmarks across devices/people.  I guess search engines are good enough for the job; we don't miss this much.  As for the \"reminders\", the real question is -- why are they outside of the calendar?  Apple should have kept it simple. \n  But that was in paper world, one could argue that both apps bell you through the same device, so the system still works if you have one device.  I don't yet know if reminders will work through all devices.\n4. Conclusions:\nApple considered a cloud of devices while designing iCloud, but a lot of us are a combined cloud of devices and people.  I guess they were in a hurry.  Hopefully, there will be added human cloud consideration to a future version.  Trying to automate across this simple scenario is the first.  Next level will be to deal with the fact that each of us is a point shared in multiple people-clouds (e.g. family, work, professional circle, PTAs, etc.).  Automating across that scenario will require the end users to grow up to the challenge. \nAny comments on this set up would be appreciated.  Your comments will help, as I am considering adding a couple of devices for additional members of my family who will join this man machine cloud soon.  The point is to keep it as much hands free as possible in a most economic way.  Good products Apple!\n\nA: Here is what I do, where I share one appleid for purchases among 3 family members. Number one, only use the appleid for purchases just for purchases. then, each member should have a separate iCloud account with a unique appleid for mail, contacts, iCal, etc syncing.  Then, on all devices set the appleid for the store to the purchase id and on the individual devices set the iCloud id to the appleid for each individual separately. Works great for me. \n\nA: I have the same setup as @Tank and @DaggerDone and it has been working great for the whole family. One Apple ID (Mine) for store purchases and my wife, son and daughter each have their own iCloud accounts for email and iMessage.\n\nA: I use the single I.d. for purchases and separate for cloud as well. In addition, I have a young son and I have set him up with a separate I.d. for purchases that is funded by gift cards and not a cc, which is any easy way to limit spending. \n\nA: I shared an iTunes account with a device I gave to my mother. What we do differently though, is not use contact syncing to my main machine. We sync our email, contacts and calendar using google. \nI then choose which things on her machine that we don't want to sync - ie I don't want my bookmarks and hers replicating to each other's devices so I disable the iCloud sync of those and they get backed up when I periodically force an itunes sync of her device.\n\nA: @user16713\n\nI use the single I.d. for purchases and separate for cloud as well. In addition, I have a young son and I have set him up with a separate I.d. for purchases that is funded by gift cards and not a cc, which is any easy way to limit spending.\n\nIn regards to your son's account, this is not such a great idea. If your son is buying kids apps, fine. However in a few years if you and he want to have the same movie or music, then you will have to have two accounts authorized in iTunes, or you will have to repurchase things.\nFor example, my mother, sister, father, and I all love musicals and many of the same movies. We share an Apple ID so that when I buy a movie or album, we can all enjoy it. If my sister had kept on using her Apple ID for purchases we would have spent a whole lot of money re-buying these things so that we could all enjoy them on our own Macs and iOS devices.\n\nA: With the release of iOS8, use the new Family Sharing feature. It allows you to share purchases (apps, books, music, movies, TV shows), calendar information, photos, location and some other information with up to 5 family members. Some more information can be found here.\nEach member needs their own iCloud account (or Apple ID), yet everybody will be able to see the other's purchases.\nMany of the other previous workarounds are no longer necessary, as Family Sharing takes care of showing the purchases, asking permission before buying since everything goes to the same payment source. It's a really nice solution for families and takes care of many of the problems mentioned above.\n\nA: Honestly, the best solution is to have each user needing an iTunes account have their own separate account. iCloud accounts are designed to be used by a single user. If it's an issue with needing each user to have the same credit/debit card attached to the iTunes Store account, each Apple ID can have the same card. \nAs much of a pain this transition can be in terms of apps, books and music, it is worth it in the long run so you don't have to deal with having everyone else's data on your machine.\n\nA: The recently released \"Family Sharing\" feature should make this simpler.  You still might want to pick and choose between the old method and the new \"family sharing\".\nI use one Apple ID for Music purchases and have one computer as the main device.

Just get a spinning wheel after opening. I've tried deleting and reloading from time capsule backups when it did work. That didnt work. Anyone have any ideas?\n\nA: Try holding the ⌥+⌘ key when launching iPhoto and rebuild your library.\n\nA: I advise that you try creating a new iPhoto library by following the instructions on this Apple Support page.\n\nA: In case the above answers do not work or if you want to try something a little easier first, try moving the iPhoto plist file to the Desktop.\nYou can find it in ~/Library/Preferences. It should have the name com.apple.iPhoto.plist. If you are running Lion, you will need to move the com.apple.iPhoto.plist.lockfile file as well. Try moving these to the Desktop and reopening the application. If that does not resolve the issue, put the plist files back and move on to the other suggestions. \n", "Q: What's the best way to back up an external hard drive onto a Macbook? A friend of mine has a Macbook Pro, and an older 80GB external hard drive.\nShe is copying files from the external hard drive (which contains all her work) to the Macbook, but slowly because she's reorganizing the data at the same time. \nI would like her to back up the external hard drive onto the Macbook, which has 750 Gigabytes of space, just in case something happens to the external drive. \nIs there a quick, easy, preferably built-in way to do this? I would prefer a method that doesn't copy files separately (so as not to create a second location on the machine that contains all her work, gets indexed, etc.) but takes a disk image and stores it somewhere. The goal is just to have a quick snapshot in case anything goes wrong. \n\nA: You can use Disk Utility to create an image of the external hard drive.\nPlug in the external hard drive and then start Disk Utility--it's in the Utilities folder under Applications--and then select the external hard drive from the list along the lefthand side of the Disk Utility window.  Once you've selected the external drive, click on New Image at the top of the window and it will ask you where you want to store the image file.  Select a location and then let it do its thing.\nOnce completed, you can restore the image to the same or another external drive or you can simply double-click the image file to mount the disk and explore its contents using finder as you would normally.\n\nA: Carbon Copy Cloner is the tool for you! It can copy the drive into a folder, into a dmg, or pretty much any where in any form. It's free, but I would suggestion donating something since its the best app for OSX out there. \nAnyways, give it a shot.\n", "Q: Mac Pro failing to boot Two times now, over the last 3 weeks my Mac Pro is failing to boot. Once on, it stays on the blue screen with the spinning icon and never gets to the login screen. To remedy this I boot from install dvd, re-install Leopard and only then will it boot completely. COuld this be my HD is getting ready to fail?\n\nA: It will be best for you to run a S.M.A.R.T scan on the drive to see if its failing. You can do this by downloading the free trial of Smart utility.\nIf the hard drive turns out fine or passes the S.M.A.R.T Scan then just re-install the operating system after you've backed up your data obviously.\n", "Q: iTunes Match questions regarding songs marked as \"Uploaded\" I have about 800 songs marked as \"Uploaded\".  I would love for them to be replaced by \"Matched\" 256kbps AAC files. \nWill iTunes Match ever re-check songs that have been flagged as Uploaded at some later point. Is there a way to re-submit them for checking?\n\nA: I have over 5000 tracks which have been uploaded, whenever I add new music, Match is updated, and it determines whether to upload it or match it.\nI was interested in this also, so I created a smart playlist for the kind set to MPEG audio and within the playlist I display the iTunes Match columns.\nRecently I checked this list, and instead of all of them displaying Uploaded, a couple of hundred had changed to Matched, so I deleted them locally and re-downloaded the matched version.\nSo in answer to your question, yes, they are sometimes updated, and there's nothing you need to do other than occasionally update match by adding new music, or manually from the menu, and then check your smart playlist.\n\nA: From what I understand, you can go to the Store menu in iTunes and click \"Update iTunes Match\" and iTunes will rescan your library for any changes, as well as scan the Uploaded items to see if they can be matched. I am not 100% sure on this, but that's how it seems to work on my machine. \n", "Q: Does using a macbook with an external monitor damage the health of the battery? I have an (oldish) MacBook Pro that I use with an external monitor, which requires that the MBP power adapter be plugged in all the time. Does that damage the health of the battery? I ask because my battery, replaced about a year ago, will now hold almost no charge after being used almost exclusively with the external monitor during working hours and plugged in all that time.\n\nA: While the external monitor itself is not the cause of the 'weakened' battery, leaving your MacBook Pro on AC power all of the time will definitely affect the battery's performance.  It is essentially under a constant state of charging, even though this is regulated by the charging circuit, which will eventually cause the battery's chemistry to begin to break down.\nCurrent batteries will typically last the longest when used regularly, but not completely discharged with each use.\n", "Q: How to fix message spam from usbmuxd in console (_SendDetachNotification/_SendAttachNotification) My console is flooded with messages like these:\n11.01.12 21:21:39,819 com.apple.usbmuxd: _SendDetachNotification (thread 0x7fff7f6cb960): sending detach for device d0:23:db:3e:0b:82@fe80::d223:dbff:fe3e:b82._apple-mobdev._tcp.local.: _BrowseReplyReceivedCallback got bonjour removal.\n11.01.12 21:21:46,596 com.apple.usbmuxd: _SendAttachNotification (thread 0x7fff7f6cb960): sending attach for device d0:23:db:3e:0b:82@fe80::d223:dbff:fe3e:b82._apple-mobdev._tcp.local.: _GetAddrInfoReplyReceivedCallback matched.\n11.01.12 21:21:46,729 usbmuxd: _AMDeviceConnectByAddressAndPort (thread 0x100781000): IPv4\n\nThey always happen in this combination of three messages and around every 10-30seconds\nAny suggestions where this is coming from and how to fix/disable it?\nEdit: (additional Infos)\nOk it seems to be originating from my iPhone (MAC d0:23:db:3e:0b:82)...\nThere are no Wifi-Printers or anything like that in the Network.\nAnd the Messages are still there when all USB Devices are disconnected.\nEdit2:\nThis seems to be coming from iPhone Wifi-Sync, is there any way to get rid of this spam without diabling Wifi-Sync for the phone?\n\nA: I had the same problem and quitting duet (the app to use the iPhone as a Mac display) fixed the problem. \n\nA: Open Console and highlight the usbmuxd spam, then click [ignore sender] in the toolbar:\n\nTo re-enable usbmuxd spam, click the [^] symbol in the lower bottom left corner then (x):\n\n\nThis will allow you to safely ignore any Console spam you would like without actually disabling anything other than the message that you see in Console.\n\nA: You can always edit your /etc/syslog.conf file to send messages from usbmuxd to their own private log file.

After it has gone to Sleep, and I wake it up to use it, the screensaver pic or Lion Grey linen image stays on the screen and I have to scrub away some of it with my pointer/cursor to see the user login screen, almost like scratching away some frost to be able to see through my car's windshield in the winter.\nWhat is causing this? And what can I do to get it to stop? I have had Macs forever and have never had this problem.\n\n\n\nA: I see this same problem. I see it on both user accounts on my 2011 iMac when the screen saver has been active and the user is automatically logged out. If the user logs themselves out this isn't present.\nI don't believe it's a problem, just a video driver quirk.\n\nA: It sounds like an issue with either the WindowServer or the Screen Saver service. I don't know of any way to resolve this other than reinstalling Lion. There may be a UNIX guru out here who can do some magic with the system files, but I'd recommend getting a solid backup of your data and reinstalling Lion using the recover partition.\n\nA: I am experiencing this exact problem (aka \"video crash/corruption\"). \nThis appears to be a rather typical manifestation of vid card driver -vs- OS & graphic app(s) mapping conflict. (mine is ATI Radeon HD 5670 512 MB on 27\" iMac 8GB running OSX Lion with latest updates)\nSo, the fix is wait til someone \"blinks\": either APPLE or AMD-ATI - and then download the new driver/OS \"fix\" from the respective site. As of this writing, don't yet see any.\nEither that or get a new vid card with compatible drivers.\nPS: The ubiquitous \"reinstall OS...\" will only waste your time if this is the cause.\nOne other possibility, especially with Lion not auto-installing some things such as new Java stuff and also the usual need for the update of \"support apps\" such as Adobe Shockwave  - in case the Lion screensaver & Login screen/util make use of these - would therefor necessitate downloading the updates for these direct from the publisher.\n-Best Regards.\n", "Q: Why does my iMac freeze since I upgraded to Lion? And how can I fix it? My iMac (late 2009) worked great with Snow Leopard. After upgrading to Lion I am loosing the Mac vs. Windows war at home. The iMac freeze except for the mouse. The only thing to do is to restart with the power button. I did a clean install of Lion but that did not help.\nSometimes it happens after I have had the iMac in sleep. It might also be related to showing Flash movies. I have seen other reports on that. \nI have basically one of each Apple product out there but this is really taking it's toll. My MacBook Pro and Mac Mini works great with Lion.\nAny suggestion?\nHere is the output from the Disk Utility.

Also, try running a Repair Disk in Disk Utility. Look for any errors in the disk repair and post them here. Take Lion out of the equation, it sounds like a failing hard drive. It's possible that the upgrade brought out underlying symptoms. \n\nA: When you say \"clean install\", did you download Lion again, or did you just use the recovery feature of Lion already installed on the iMac? I had problems on my 2010 MBP after upgrading to Lion. Apparently my Lion version was somehow flawed/corrupted. Unfortunately, this also meant that my recovery partition of Lion was corrupted. It was solved by going to a genius bar and the guy gave me a new copy. If you can get to a genius bar, or get your hands on a recovery stick that someone else has created, it might be worth a try.\n\nA: I upgraded to Mountain Lion and now the problem seems to be gone. It was Lion!\n\nA: I have this problem straight out of the box with a Mac Mini with Radeon when it happens I can recover by killing the iTunes process.\n", "Q: Mac mini built in speakers do not play all of sound I've a rather odd issue I've noticed while playing this song on Youtube:\nWhen using the built-in speakers I only hear the background singing (a bit hard to describe: sometimes I hear almost nothing, sometimes the high-pitched choir, at some parts mixed with lower voices). However the moment I plug in earphones they play it just like it is supposed to. The same happens in both Chrome and Safari with both HTLM5 and Flash players, even when playing the Youtube stream in VLC, heck even when downloading the song and converting it to low-quality MP3: same result. I've never noticed that before on any other music file nor can I reproduce it with another song. Is there something left, that I might have overseen?\nVersion information: Mac OS X 10.7.2 on the new Mac mini 2.5 GHz i5\n\nA: it a little bit odd, but the Sound preferences in System Preferences only shows the controls for the currently selected device.  If you plug in headphones for example, it only allows you select and alter the sound preferences for the headphones (and doesn't even show the internal speakers)\nIt maintains different sets of preferences for each output type.\nUnplug your headphones, then open the Sound preference pane and see if there is anything amiss in the sound output tab.\n(also please let us know if you have any software like Hear or Audio Hijack Pro that might be interfering with your audio output but thats a long shot)\n", "Q: iMac keyboard stops working \nPossible Duplicate:\nWireless Keyboard disconnects \n\nThe wireless Apple keyboard that came with my iMac has a tendency to suddenly disconnect from my iMac without no sensible reason (its not the battery). The only solution I have found this far is restarting the iMac, which automatically reconnects the keyboard. I have tried reconnecting the keyboard through the bluetooth configuration, which gives no ohther result than making the toolbar freeze.\nAny solutions?\n\nA: Do you have another Mac you can connect the keyboard to? If you can isolate whether or not this issue occurs only with your iMac or only with your iMacs keyboard, you can figure out where things are going wrong. Let us know if you're able to test the keyboard on another Mac or test the Mac with a different keyboard. \nIf you don't have access to either of those things, I'd recommend taking a trip to your local Apple Store and having them test it out. They'll have extra Macs and keyboard and a Bluetooth diagnostic to run as well. \n", "Q: Does \"Erase All Data\" feature on iPhone disable \"Find my Phone\"? I have the \"Erase All Data after 10 failed passcode attempts\" feature turned on on my iPhone 4S. I also have the \"Find my Phone\" app installed. If my iPhone was stolen, and the thief triggered the \"Erase All Data\" feature after failing to unlock the phone, would it erase the \"Find my phone\" app meaning I couldn't locate it through iCloud? \n\nA: The 'Find My iPhone' app on the iPhone itself does nothing to affect the ability to locate/remote message/remote wipe the iPhone itself. The 'Find My iPhone' app is a client to simplify the functions of doing so for other devices.\nIn order to actually use those features on the iPhone itself MUST be configured via Settings: Location Services > (down at the bottom) Find My iPhone. Only by enabling that will you actually be able to locate your phone via another iOS device, or at icloud.com;\n\nA: Yes. Enabling this option is both risky and safe. On one hand, you risk losing your phone/data forever, but on the other hand that individual will not be able to access your data or use your phone. It's your call, but I'd recommend leaving it off so you at least have a chance at getting it back. You can always wipe out your phone remotely with Find my iPhone without having that option enabled.\n\nA: Yes. Unfortunately, Find my iPhone isn't a fail-safe system. It's also disabled if someone else erases all your data, through iTunes for example. Additionally, if a SIM card other than your own is put into the phone, the handset can only locate itself via wi-fi, and not through the third party networks SIM.\n", "Q: How can I redial using Voice Control or Siri? Is it possible to dial the last dialed phone number on iOS via Voice Control or Siri?\n\nA: Sorry, but not yet.  Apple could add this in the future, but it isn't in iOS under Voice Control or Siri currently.  If you know who called, you could ask for them by name.  Unfortunately, that's the only solution with Siri.\n\nA: I was driving down the freeway yesterday and my phone call was cut off. Sounds like the perfect time to tell Siri to redial. I was shocked that Siri does not do this after being in release for so long.\n\nA: The current iOS version 9 allows Siri to dial the last number. Just say “Redial that last number”.\n", "Q: Lion Server WebDAV not working I setup a new lion server, with fully functional dns. Forward and reverse work without issue. I have a forward DNS entry for the server externally. OD is running, and there's 5 network users. Also, all the correct ports are forwarded on the firewall. \nAFP works Flawlessly for all users internally and externally, and when the admin logs  into the server with WebDAV, it works fine. Using finder, we use this method: http://server.abc.com/webdav\nHowever, the network users can NOT connect, but the local accounts can. Does anyone have any clue? Has this happened to anyone else?\n\nA: I've written a blog post on how to do this.\n\n\n*\n\n*From Server Admin, make new Web > Realm and set appropriate ACLs.\n\n*Create a folder in location/volume where data for Share is physically located.\n\n*Change permissions of folder to _www:admin (that’s what works for me)\n$ sudo chown _www:admin /Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites/host.domain.tld\n\n*Create a symlink to the share folder in the folder where your web server looks to for the domain’s data.\n$ sudo ln -s /path/to/data /Library/WebServer/Documents/site_web_folder\nI know there probably a bit of information missing and if I showed images of the actual steps it might make things a bit clearer but I’m a little paranoid about my server and I don’t want to risk opening it up to further attack.\nAll this needs to be done before OS X will allow a \"Connect to Server...\" and mount your WebDAV share.\n\nA: I searched for quite a while to find the answer to this.  Finally found an article on the apple site that is EXACTLY the answer.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4777#\nSome additional hints:\nFor ease, enable the root user on your server and then login as root before you begin.  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1528\nAlso, make sure to use a command line editor OR change the prefs in TextEdit to ensure the files are saved correctly.\nFinally, to find the files in the first place you will have to make hidden files visible.http://guides.macrumors.com/Viewing_hidden_files_on_a_Mac\n", "Q: What happened to Exposé? Before Lion I used Exposé daily. Now with Lion it's gone and Mission Control is in its place. Now when I use MC it groups all my open pages instead of showing each page. This is kind of a pain when swapping between applications.  Is there a way I can use a Hot Key or pointer swipe to show ALL of my open pages, spanning different applications?\n\nA: In OS X 10.7, Exposé has been outmoded by Mission Control. It essentially combines Exposé and Spaces into one set of gestures. How you access it will depend on your computer and its configuration.\nMacBooks with glass, buttonless trackpads and desktops with the Magic Trackpad can access it by swiping four fingers up, I believe. Older MacBooks that run Lion can access it with the Exposé button on the keyboard. And, of course, all Macs can be configured to launch Mission Control by moving the cursor to a corner. It can all be accessed via the Mission Control pane in the System Preferences.\n\nA: There isn't a reliable way to use the old Exposé on Lion.\nYou can, however, use Mission Control to access all of your open windows easily.\nIn Mission Control, hover over an app's 'cluster' of open windows. Use a two-finger swipe upwards (or scroll up with a scroll wheel) to separate those windows for easier access.\nYou can access all of an app's windows using F10. You can assign a Hot Corner or different shortcut using System Preferences-> Mission Control (this function is known as \"Application Windows\").\nFrom here, you can press cmd+tab to see other application's windows.\n", "Q: Safe to Delete Mobile Applications I back up my iPhone 4 and iPad 2 to iCloud.\nIs it necessary to keep my Mobile Applications Folder?\nThere are over 12GBs of space being used by this folder on my Macbook.\nCould it be thrown out?\n\nA: I would be careful. You may be backing up to iCloud, but syncing locally with iTunes. If you DO NOT sync your Apps with iTunes, you can throw it away.\nPersonally, I would keep it and maybe just delete some of the old apps you no longer use.\n\nA: Absolutely.  If you aren't syncing apps from your Macbook to your iOS devices, it really isn't necessary for them to be there.  And, if you ever need them on your Macbook again, you can always redownload them from iTunes (unless the app is removed from the App Store, which is rare).\n\nA: Hopefully this helps people in the future, it's ok to delete it locally from your Mac and it won't affect your iOS devices. Backup everything to iCloud and redownload from Apple Store. You can even do the same with iMovie and GarageBand (two apps I really don't use but take a bunch of space on my Mac Air 120GB).\nDirectly copied from iTunes below.\n\nAre you sure you want to delete the selected apps from your iTunes library?\n  These apps will not be deleted from any iOS device that synchronizes with your iTunes library.\n\n\nA: Edit 2016-06-07: the behavior described here is no longer valid, at least for iTunes 12.4.1.6 and iOS 9.3.2 (both the most up-to-date at the time of this edit). It is completely safe to go into iTunes and delete iOS apps, they will not be removed from your phone when you sync. (Just tested this on my own phone.)\nOriginal answer left intact below: \n\nDo you sync your iPhone and iPad with iTunes (even occasionally)?\nIf the answer is no, you can go ahead and delete the iOS apps stored on your Macbook?\nIf the answer is yes, you need to check if your apps get synced too while syncing your iPhone and iPad? If the answer is no, you can delete the iOS apps on your Macbook. If the answer is yes, you need to connect your iOS device to iTunes, click on your device in the column on the left, click on the 'apps' pane, and uncheck synchronising of your apps. The problem is that when you do that, the apps on your iOS device will be deleted and you'll have to redownload your apps on your device through the appstore. If you don't want to do that, you can choose to not sync your iOS device with iTunes anymore but that means you won't be able to sync anything (movies, tv-shows, ...) with iTunes.\n", "Q: How to Automatic Backups of a MySQL Database I am using the version of MySQL that came with Snow Leopard Server. I am running Time Machine on that server, but I know that it's not backing up the MySQL databases due to strict permissions issues.\nDoes anyone have a recommendation for a non-commandline, easy, clean method for automated backups of MySQL data?\n\nA: Its not exactly what your looking for, but we used automator to create a launchable application that runs a commandline to export the sql database. We then used crontab to schedule the app to run at certain intervals. \n\n\n*\n\n*In automator add the \"Run Shell Script\" action. Set the shell to \"/bin/bash\" and add the command\n\n/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqldump --opt -h localhost -uMySQLUSERNAME -pMySQLPASSWORD DatabaseName --single-transaction  > \"/path/to/export/exportname\"\n\n\n*Save the workflow as an application, then use crontab to schedule the application (or you can use Cronnix - GUI for crontab)\nThis is also a good method beacause you can put the application on the dock and anyone can run the backup on-demand. We have software monitor the folder where we export the databse to and when it detects changes it uploads the new file to our backup server. Works a treat \nNot as simple to set up as your probably looking for, but it works well once its set up!\n", "Q: Add Cut file/folder option to right click or Context menu I use Lion on my Macbook pro 13\". I would like to add a context menu item called \"Move\" or \"Cut\" (just like Copy) and when I go to the desired location and hit \"Paste\", it should Move the file/folder I selected and paste it there. Is this possible in Lion?\n\nA: The short answer is no. \nAssuming you may be an ex-Windows user, you cannot perform a \"Cut\" and \"Paste\" with files or folders in Mac OS X Lion, or previous versions for that matter like you can in Windows.\nYour only option is to drag and drop to move, or \"Copy\" and \"Paste\" then delete the original afterwards.\n\nA: As commented above, both ⌘+option ⌥ + v\nOr option ⌥ + secondary click + paste work on Mountain Lion\n\nA: The answer is yes, install TotalFinder.\n", "Q: How to export WebM and h264 from a Mac I exported two videos from Photoshop using the standard export movie tool. The dialog is the standard Quicktime Export that we're used to seeing from the beginning of times.\nFor each movie I chose the WebM (QT Extension) and h.264 as a codec. Both file names come out with a .mov extension, but are encoded with their appropriate codec.\nTheir final destination is a website, where they will be embedded with the html5 video tag. If I manually change their extension to .webm and .mp4, will they work when I upload them to the server?\n\nA: There's a free app in the Mac App store, Miro Video Converter. It might do what you need.\n\nA: I doubt it, mov webm and mp4 are all container types and renaming mov files to different container types is a recipe for disaster \nYou could always leave them and add type and codec hints to the video tag HTML markup\n", "Q: Apps bought on iTunes not showing up on the iPhone 4 An app that i buy on iTunes doesn't show up in the iPhone with iCloud unless i sync it with a cable.\nAlso the reverse applies. Anything bought on the iPhone doesn't show up in iTunes in the computer unless the cable is connected.\nAny suggestions?\nThanks.\n\nA: You need to enable automatic downloads.\nIn iTunes: iTunes > Preferences > click on the Store tab: there you can enable automatic downloads by separately checking the boxes next to 'Music', 'Apps' and 'Books'.\nOn your iOS device: Settings > Store: there you'll find switches to activate automatic downloads for 'Music', 'Apps' and 'Books'.\nNote: If you only enable automatic downloads in iTunes music, apps and books downloaded on your iOS device will also download in iTunes on your computer. If you only enable automatic downloads on your iOS device the reverse is true. If you want it to work in both directions you need to enable it both in iTunes and on your iOS device.\n", "Q: How can I open Windows network links on Mac OS X? I started using a Mac recently in a workplace where most people use Windows. We share with each other links to work files that exist on some server here. So I may get a URL via email that looks like that \\\\servername\\folder\\stuff.doc or even just a link to a folder like \\\\servername\\folder - clicking it results in an error on the Mac (Lion). Is there anything I can do so that clicking such network addresses will launch the document or folder?\n\nA: Under the finder menu, choose 'Go' -> 'Connect to Server'.\nIn the box that appears you need to type the path to the SMB server share.\nSMB stands for Server Message Block, which windows understands.\nThe path would look like this...\nsmb://ServerName/SharedFolder\nI have done this on OSX Tiger and Lion.\nThere are many tutorials available, such as this one on lifehacker\n\nA: I've used WinShortcutter in the past - seems to work OK. This will allow you to open Windows style UNC paths (\\\\servername\\path\\to\\directory) when they appear in emails, etc.\n\nA: at work in a heavily windows/mac userspace we have LinkConverter\nConverts both ways\nsmb://server/folder --> \\\\server\\folder\n\\\\server\\folder --> smb://server/folder\n\n\nA: Also, if you connect to the local domain, you can configure UNC paths to work in Mac OS X. \nYou can connect to the domain by going to System Preferences>Users & Groups>Login Options and click the Join button next to Network Account Server. Type in the name of the domain and press enter. \nYou can then click the Open Directory Utility button and select the Active Directory option and click the pencil button to edit. Verify that you are bound to the domain and click the Show Advanced Options button. Make sure that the Use UNC path from Active Directory to derive network home location is checked and select SMB as the network protocol to be used. \nHope this helps. \n\nA: Run vim, paste your Windows link, then run the following commands\n:%s/\\\\/\\//g\n\n:%s/ /%20/g\n\nThe first command will turn all \\ (backslashes) into / (forward slashes) into.\nThe second will turn all spaces into the \"%20\" string needed for a Mac command.\nPaste this jumble into Apple + K (Connect to Server) using the SMB feature.\n\nA: As far as I can tell from reading the documentation this setting for UNC paths in Directory Utility only works for using a UNC path from Active Directory to mount your network home directory.  It doesn't provide general UNC support. :-(\n\nA: Try putting \"file:\" before the address. It helped me with hyperlinks while working in side applications. They featured hyperlinks, but when I was giving them local computer address to a file on Mac it automatically would launch web browser showing the page cannot be viewed. With \"file:\" in the beginning of the address link it opens the file with the designated software, not even showing it in Finder.\n\nA: You can get access only with IP like . you need to check IP of window and run that ip on your browser you will get that system from mac..\n", "Q: How can I stitch a set of images together? I have a set of images that are named foo-N.jpg, where N is a number from 0 to 100.\nI'd like to stitch them together such that I have one long image, where foo-0.jpg is at the left and foo-100.jpg is at the right.\nI can do this manually in Photoshop or Fireworks, but it'd take forever.\nIs there a way to do this in bulk, like perhaps with Automator, Terminal, or an app?\n\nA: You can do it with Imagemagick from a terminal. If you have Homebrew, installing it is as easy as:\nbrew install imagemagick\n\nOnce you have it, open the terminal and go to the folder where you have the pictures, then do:\nconvert foo* +append result.jpg\n\nAnd there you have it, your 100 pictures in a row. You can also make a column with them, instead of +append use -append.\n", "Q: Is it possible to upgrade a MacBook processor? I have a 2006 Dual core Duo MacBook. It is fast enough to do basic photo editing on the go, as my job requires, however I would like to install Lion, to bring it in line with my workstation and devices.\nThis would mean I need a new processor, minimum Dual Core 2 Duo (as required by Lion), although I would rather install an i3 or i5.\nIs this at all possible?\n\nA: Since the CPU and GPU are welded onto the logic board (Apple's term for motherboard) such a task would require you to replace the whole logic board!\n\n\n*\n\n*I cannot name specific prices, but this is really expensive. After all, this is the most expensive part of a Macbook. Usually, it is recommended to buy a newer (second hand) computer instead.\n\n*An upgrade to the logicboard of a non-unibody Macbook with a Core 2 Duo might be possible with e.g. the generation of the Macbook 4,1 since both are build quite similar. You should verify this with the Apple support.\n\n*An upgrade to the logicboard of a unibody Macbook with i3/i7 is ruled out since the internal structure is totally different. The size and location of logic board, and battery have changed 'vastly' amongst other things. \n\nA: Short answer is no, the chipset and socket of the 2006 dual core will be different to the core 2 and i5 CPU\n", "Q: How can I get my MacBook to stop freezing after I switch back to Mac OS from Windows 7 in Bootcamp I have a problem I could not find anywhere else. Maybe somebody here has an idea on how to solve it.\nI have a MacBook Pro, early 2011, 2.2 GHz i7 with the AMD Radeon HD 6750M and 1680 x 1050 display. I have installed Windows 7 on a partition of the hard drive and have to switch there about once a day. Every single time I switch back to Mac OS X (10.7.2), the computer will freeze either immediately or within up to three minutes after logging in. This is absolutely reliable. I then have to do a hard restart (keeping the on/off button pressed for several seconds), and when the computer comes back, everything works fine until the next time I switched to the Windows partition.\nSince this is a freeze, no error report is generated by the system, so the Apple solution is \"Send the computer in\", something that is impossible for me (I need my MacBook constantly).\nI do have quite a few extensions installed, and suspected Quicksilver for a while, but deactivating it did not solve the problem. Other extensions going up at startup are: iCal, Evernote, DoublePane, iTunesHelper, Autograph, DropBox, SophosUIServer. Sophos Anti-Virus is the only program running both in Windows and Mac OS. All software is legal, and virus scans (Sophos and MacScan) showed no Malware.\nAny helpful suggestions, what might cause the problem?\n\nA: My Mac (OS X Mavericks 10.9.4) also crashes/freezes and becomes partly or wholly unresponsive (beach ball and all) and it was due to Sophos Anti Virus. Uninstall it and see if it makes things work!\n", "Q: Why can't I create an IMAP folder in Mail? Having used MS Outlook for a while with my IMAP account, I thought I would try out the new and improved Mail in OS X Lion. The structure of my mailbox on the left hand panel is as follows:\nMAILBOXES\n    INBOX\n        CLIENT 1\n        CLIENT 2\n        CLIENT 3\n            SUBFOLDER\n            SUBFOLDER\n            SUBFOLDER\n        CLIENT 4\n        CLIENT 5\n        CLIENT 6\n        CLIENT 7\n    SENT\n    TRASH\n\nMY COMPANY NAME\n    TRASH\n    JUNK\n    SENT\n\nThis has worked fine with Outlook, and with Outlook I am able to add extra IMAP folders (or mailboxes as Mail calls them). In Outlook I can add to the client folders, and the subfolders inside a client folder.\nHowever, with Mail, when I add a new mailbox, it will only let me add a new folder inside one of my client folders. It will not let me add a folder to the \"Client\" level.\nIf I add a new mailbox, and try and place it at the top \"Client\" level, the new folder ends up going here:\nMAILBOXES\n    INBOX\n        CLIENT 1\n        CLIENT 2\n        CLIENT 3\n            SUBFOLDER\n            SUBFOLDER\n            SUBFOLDER\n        CLIENT 4\n        CLIENT 5\n        CLIENT 6\n        NEW FOLDER DOESNT APPEAR HERE\n        CLIENT 7\n    SENT\n    TRASH\n\nMY COMPANY NAME\n    TRASH\n    JUNK\n    IT APPEARS HERE INSTEAD???\n    SENT\n\nIt doesn't go in my inbox.\nCan anyone help? This is the reason I have to use Outlook, as Mail won't let me create new IMAP folders at my \"Client\" this level.\nAny help would be appreciated. Maybe I am looking at it from the wrong side, as I am used to Outlook.\n\nA: You need to add these folders in your IMAP mail account.\nIf for example you are using Gmail login, and create the folders you want using the webmail settings panel. \nWhen you next launch mail the folders will be there and you can then drag and drop emails into folders, etc.\nOutlook doesnt create the folders in IMAP it creates them on the machine, so they are not true IMAP folders they are just folders in Outlook.\n\nA: What about setting your IMAP Path Prefix preferences to \"INBOX\"?\nPreferences -> Accounts -> select your account -> Advanced -> IMAP Path Prefix.\nSet it to \"INBOX\" and you will get all your subfolders in a list headed with the account name and can work the way you're used. That's how our IMAP accounts are configured. Never had any problems with this.\n\nA: I found the answer here: http://www.ehow.com/how_8342925_create-imap-folders-apple-mail.html\nClick on the inbox associated with the IMAP account, in the upper left of the Mail window.\nChoose \"New Mailbox ... \" from the \"Mailbox\" menu. \"Mailbox\" is the Mail application's term for a folder on the IMAP server.\n\nA: If you go into Accounts, then click on the IMAP account you wish to be able to add folders for, next Click Advanced.\nIn the popup box, if the item that says IMAP Root Folder: is empty, type \"Inbox\" into the box then press OK.

The MacBook Air can share DVD drives on other Macs. For reading disks this works great. However, I want to burn an ISO to the drive. The drive doesn't show up in Disk Utility. Is it possible to burn ISOs onto a shared drive from a MacBook Air?\n\nA: Try to insert a empty disk into your mac. Then, share it with you MacBook Air. Now, you should have a new DVD-Icon in the finder sidebar. \nIt should now show up in the Disk Utility tool!\nOr:\nRight-Click on the ISO-Image, and click Burn on CD/DVD after you \"connected\" the empty CD/DVD to you MacBook Air via DVD-Sharing. \n", "Q: Do Mac Pros use NUMA? Does Mac OS X make use of NUMA on Mac Pros with two (or more) CPUs?\n\nA: This is a partial answer \nThe processors in the current mac pros use Xeon processors e5620 and x5670s with Intel's QuickPath Interconnect\nQPI is Intel's implementation of NUMA and takes place fully within the processor just as HyperTransport is AMDs\nI would have to admit in not being sure if that takes OSX out of the equation entirely or even mostly.  Modern processor architecture has improved since the original NUMA concept that the original requirement for software support is probably,now, immaterial.\n\nA: No Mac Pro supports NUMA, their memory are configured in interleave mode.\nHighly memory intensive application faced with incorrectly allocated (cross NUMA node) memory pages can still cause significant (>20%) performance issue albeit \"modern processor architecture\" (I'm an HPC admin a regularly benchmark / troubleshoot system performance issue).\nAnd someone else has installed a NUMA aware OS (reads: Linux) onto a Mac Pro and finds only a single NUMA node, which shows that the firmware configures the memory to run in interleave mode (non-NUMA configuration). While this is slower than a properly configured NUMA system, it is still faster than an incorrectly configured / allocated NUMA system.\nWith this, we may reason that the mach/xnu kernel is likely non-NUMA aware.\n", "Q: How can I avoid re-encoding of video in iMovie and use it for cutting only? I have a video that was created on a surveillance camera with the (for video) unsusual resolution of 1280x1024. It's encoded with H.264 and encapsulated in an MP4 AVC container. The quality is rather good, especially considering the difficult structures in the image (the fine steel structure of a radio telescope dish and dark branches against the sky).\nI tried to cut it using iMovie, but all export methods I tried so far yield very bad quality videos. The comparison below shows the original footage (left) and the best result I achieved until now (right). This was created by using the built-in exporter and specifying a \"large\" video. Note the greatly decreased resolution and blurred structures.\n \nThere are many hints on the net that suggest using QuickTime export, but I was not yet able to get any better quality out of it. I tested:\n\n\n*\n\n*DV output format -- blurry, and the aspect format changed even though I specified an output video size of 1280x1024\n\n*H.264 output -- extremely blurry, even on highest quality setting and with two-pass encoding\n\n\nSo my question is: How can I tell iMovie to simply cut the input video without re-encoding it, or alternatively: How do I tell iMovies built-in  exporter to use a different video format than \"large\" (720x576)?\nFile size is not an issue here.\n\nA: Indeed, you should use QuickTime rather than iMovie: iMovie will import (and therefore usually encode) the movie, but will also force you to export, as you have noted.\nThe main interest of using QuickTime is to use its editing features.\nAssuming you're using QuickTime X (Snow Leopard / Lion), open your movie file, and hit ⌘T (or Edit > Trim). The timeline will morph into a yellow double-ended scrollbar so that you can trim the sequence.\n\nAdjust it to fit the sequence  you want, and validate the trimming with a click on the Trim yellow button. You can then simply save the file (⌘S), without the need for an export that will necessarily reduce quality.\n\nUpdate seeing that you need to remove parts of the video.\nYou'll need the more advanced editing features of QuickTime 7. To install it on Snow Leopard or Lion, refer to Installing QuickTime Player 7 on Mac OS X v10.6 or Later on Apple's KB.\nYou'll then be able to open your video with QT7, select parts of your video with I (set input point) and O (set output point), and delete the part with a stroke of ⌫. Then, simply save the file, as said earlier.\nYou might need a license key for QT7, though (I don't remember if the latest versions of the OS need them or activate the Pro features for free).\n\nA: The free and open source AviDemux video editor is a better software to cut or join AVC (H.264) / HEVC (H.265) encoded MPEG-4 videos without re-encoding them again (note: re-encoding is necessary if the \"cut\" you make is not on a start and end KEYFRAME. With AviDemux, you can easily use the UP and DOWN arrow keys to jump to all the keyframes in a video, and thus easily select the right portion between keyframes you want to delete from the video).\nAviDemux can also produce better quality encoding with smaller file size, unlike Apple apps, as they can also encode using the CPU (Apple apps often turn to the built-in hardware encoder to encode media - this is blazing fast but at the price of lower quality and bigger file size.)\n", "Q: How to investigate fragmentation of one file? I'd like to see if one of my file is \"all over the place\", ie fragmented in little pieces at different locations on my hard drive.\nI'm not looking for a software like iDefrag but rather a command line utility. I know nothing of file systems, nodes, etc. Does such a CL tool exist? More generally, how do you know where files physically are?\nThe file I want to investigate is ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History indexes, but that's more of a general question.\n\nA: HFSDebug was a decent tool on older version of OSX, however I do not beleive it is Lion compliant.\nhttp://www.osxbook.com/software/hfsdebug/\nThe original maker of HFSDebug recommends File Xray, a commercial program to do the same tasks and more - check it out here\nhttp://filexray.com/\n\nA: I asked the same question on quora and someone impressively answered with a C program he made up himself.\nHere is his code:\n/*\n  check-frag filename [blockjump]\n*/  \n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <sys/stat.h>\n#include <sys/fcntl.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <stdint.h>\n\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n    struct log2phys lf;\n    int start, end, i, status;\n    int blockjump = 4096;\n    struct stat st_buf;\n\n    if (argc < 2) {\n        printf(\"Enter a filename.\\n\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n    if (argc == 3) {\n        blockjump = atoi(argv[2]);\n    }\n    printf(\"Using block size of %d\\n\", blockjump);\n    status = stat(argv[1], &st_buf);\n    if (status != 0 || (!(S_ISREG (st_buf.st_mode)))) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Error reading file %s or file is not regular file.\\n\", argv[1]);\n        return 1;\n    }\n    int fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);\n    if (fd == -1) {\n        fprintf(stderr, \"Error or file not found: %s\\n\", argv[1]);\n        return 1;\n    }\n    start = lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_CUR);\n    end = lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_END);\n    printf(\"start: %d\\tend: %d\\n\", start, end);\n    off_t last = 0;\n    int cblocks = 1;\n    int tblocks = 1;\n    for (i = 0; i < (end-blockjump); i=i+blockjump) {\n        tblocks++;\n        lseek(fd, i, SEEK_SET);\n        fcntl(fd, F_LOG2PHYS, &lf);\n        if (last != lf.l2p_devoffset && last != (lf.l2p_devoffset-blockjump)) {\n            printf(\"%jd\\n\", (intmax_t)lf.l2p_devoffset);\n        } else {\n            cblocks++;\n        }\n        last = lf.l2p_devoffset;\n\n    }\n    printf(\"contiguous blocks: %d\\n\", cblocks);\n    printf(\"total blocks: %d\\n\", tblocks);\n    printf(\"difference (fragmented extents): %d\\n\", tblocks-cblocks);\n    printf(\"percent contiguous in file: %f\\n\", (float)cblocks/(float)tblocks);\n    close(fd);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nPut that in a file, name it frag.c or something like that, and run make frag or gcc frag.c -o frag.

Since Helvetica comes with all Macs, and I have bought a Mac, does that mean that I can use that font commercially? For example in a banner or website header?\n\nA: Yes, buying the OS includes the license to use these fonts in derivative work, like graphics, even for commercial applications.\nYou can however not redistribute the font in any way. Font embedding in websites through the @font-face CSS feature for example qualifies as redistributing the font (even if it is in another format), and requires a seperate license.\n\nA: Not a lawyer, but my understanding is that once you use a font to create something, such as a banner, what you have is a work and not a font, and the work may be distributed. Embedding a font (as with @font-face) is trickier in that there is typically a restriction in your EULA against transferring a font, which you might have to do if the target server does't have a copy. \nIn the case of Helvetica it's quite likely that the target server -does- have a license, since Helvetica is ubiquitous. If you are worried, you can always use a similar font (and there are hundreds that look just like Helvetica) that has a more lenient license.\n", "Q: PPTP VPN DNS delay When I connect a PPTP VPN on Lion, it takes several minutes for DNS resolution to actually switch over to the addresses that come back over PTPP.

I shut down the Mac, cleaned it up, made reasonably sure nothing had drained into the keyboard itself, then rebooted. The computer itself seems to be working fine.\nThe issue is that the right half of the keyboard, including the couple rows below the spill, is now significantly diminished in terms of backlight. I've tried grabbing Lab Tick, and the brightness does seem to adjust when I alter the setting, just not up to the same amount that it had pre-spill. Before I go resetting my SMC, I'd like to know - are there other alternatives for cleaning the keyboard or restoring the brightness? The keys aren't sticky at all, just dimmed, and the laptop is still covered under AppleCare.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there's not a lot that you can do. Liquid damage is tough to repair without replacing components. The only way to get to the underside of the top case is to remove every component in the machine, which I'm guessing you're not set up or trained to do. Even if you could get to it, it's unlikely that you'd be able to restore the backlight. The best thing to do is to take your machine to the Apple Store and tell them exactly what happened. Since liquid damage is not covered by AppleCare, you will have to pay for this. Sometimes they are able to help you out with the repair cost, but not always. The worst case scenario would be sending the machine to an Apple repair center for a complete repair of all components affected. This costs a flat rate of around $1250.\nI know this isn't the news you were hoping for, but I hope it helps!\n\nA: Have you tried opening the keyboard, and cleaning it with distilled water and/or IPA (isopropyl alcohol)?\nI cannot guarantee if it will work so late after the accident, but distilled water will clean off any deposits from liquids if applied quickly enough.\nLeave it dry naturally, possibly in an airing cupboard at 20 deg C.

Time Capsule light is green, Airport Utility reveals no problems.  What do I do?  Thanks.\n\nA: I see this every few months and all other features of the device seem to work fine when it happens. The short answer is a restart has always fixed it for me, either from the Airport Utility or if you must by cycling the power.\n\nA: Are you connected to the 5ghz wifi or the normal wifi ?\nI had the exact same problem you describe, Airport Utility showed nothing wrong, green lights across the board, but when trying to do a Time Machine backup, it wouldn't be able to find the disk.\nAdditionally, I was also unable to access the Time Capsule's disk through Finder. It shows up alright, but I could not connect.\nManually switching wifi network to the non-5ghz one solved both the backup and Finder problems.\n\nA: Try changing the TC disk name. Worked for me. \n\nA: From Tesserax's answer from June 2018 on the Apple Communities:\n\nUse a 16-character or less base station name for the TC. Also do not include special characters or spaces in the name.\n\nThis solved the \"Backup Disk Not Available\" for me in 2020 on macOS Catalina with an Airport Time Capsule version 7.9.1.\n", "Q: QuickLook doesn’t work with Chat transcript files Trying to use QuickLook for Chat transcript files isn’t working anymore on my machine. \nFirst it takes >10 seconds to load (for files <20KB) - and then when it does finally load, it’s just an icon. I can’t actually read the chat.\nAnybody else having this experience?\nI’m not even quite sure what to try resetting! Deleting the QuickLook plists does not seem to have changed anything.\n\nA: Might want to flush your various caches, specifically font caches - I like Cocktail and Lion Cache Cleaner for both.\n\nA: Whenever you mess with .qlgenerator files, you should type qlmanage -r in the Terminal. This lets the whole QuickLook system know that you have gone around its back, and causes it to nuke its caches and re-initialize everything.\nThat may be the missing bit.

If the credentials of a proxy setup are improperly stored (for example in one's keychain) then the AuthBrokerAgent can runaway.\nMore details and context on a follow-up posted on Apple Community forum, but the solution was to clear out bad user/passwords from the keychain and use Safari to re-ented the correct user/pass for the web proxy and check the box to have Safari save the password in the keychain.\n", "Q: My iCal isn't picking up invitations from iCloud. What can I do? My boyfriend and I shared a MobileMe family account with our own email addresses. We also had our calendars shared. To keep each other in the loop, we occasionally invited each other to events. Everything worked perfectly. Then we moved to iCloud and things aren't as smooth. We recently realized the invitations he sent to me weren't showing up in my iCal. They were still showing up online at iCloud.com (where I can accept/decline) and in the iCal app on my iPhone 4, but only as a dotted event on the day, not in the Invitation tab. On my iPhone, I can accept/decline if I click on the event. Since I have his calendar showing in my iCal on my Mac, I can see the events I'm invited to, but cannot accept/decline there.\nThe inconsistencies are throwing me for a loop. I've logged out of iCloud and relogged in, deleted the calendar from my Mac and resynced. I've made sure the default calendar is my personal calendar. I've made sure my address card is updated and correct. Same issues. Any thoughts or help?\n\nA: How are the settings in iCal? Meaning have you added the Cloud calendar to your accounts? In iCal, under preferences, under accounts you have to make sure that your iCloud account is added on there. If it's not, try it.

However, the applescript then performs keystrokes with command & shift held down.  How do I get around this?  \nI tried:\nkeystroke \"blah\" using command up\n\nbut get this syntax error:\nExpected end of line, etc. but found application constant or consideration.\nI've similarly tried\nkey up shift\nkey up command\nkeystroke \"blah\"\n\nand this simply doesn't work - the command/shift keys are still held.\nIs using documented anywhere that might help me resolve this?  Otherwise, how do you make the applescript ignore user-held modifier keys?\nEDIT: A workaround (but not a solution): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6584357/why-applescript-always-send-keystrokes-with-command-down  add delay 0.2 before the script\n\nA: Well, hard to prove a negative but, as the question you linked to yourself says: you are holding the ⌘ and ⇧ keys down when calling the script. It can not ignore them. Apple script is scripting, and much closer to GUI scripting than to applicative scripting.\nI cannot offer any other idea than in the answer to the question you sent: just add a slight delay so that you release the keys before the keystrokes are sent.\ndelay 0.2\n\n\nA: FastScripts pauses running scripts before keystroke and key code commands if modifier keys have not been released.\n\nOne cool trick in 2.6.1 is the way FastScripts behaves when your scripts include “keystroke” commands to synthesize keyboard presses. In the past, these scripts were tricky to get right in FastScripts, because the synthesized keystroke would be mixed up with the very keys you had used to invoke the script. Now, FastScripts will suspend execution of any such script until you release the keys that were pressed to invoke the script.\n\nFastScripts does not support triggering scripts with pointing device actions, but you could use KeyRemap4MacBook to map pointing device actions to some unused key combinations first.\n\nA: The most robust solution is to make a system call that checks which modifier keys are currently pressed.  The following solution uses small external executable written in C that you can compile yourself from the command line (provided you have Xcode installed).\nIf you don't know C, don't worry!  You'll only need to copy and paste the C code.  It's called using a simple AppleScript handler.\nTechnical Note: The following code is based on macOS's Carbon framework.  It should also be possible to create a Cocoa solution that would allow everything to be called directly from AppleScript using AppleScript-Objective-C.\nCreate the Compiled Executable\nFollow these instructions to create a command-line program that prints the current modifier keys.

I gave it a slightly different name because I thought I'd want to keep old phone's backups and new phone's backups separate.\nI now need to restore the old phone's backup to the new phone.\nUsing iTunes, I renamed the new phone to match the name on the backup I want to restore from, mistakenly thinking that iTunes would automatically associate the new phone and the old backup by name. The old backup doesn’t show in the drop-down selection box.\nHow can I access the old backup and restore it to the new phone?\n\nA: you need to reset the phone to factory settings so that iTunes think's it's a new phone\nit will then ask you if you want to restore from a previous backup and you can restore from any of them that are still on the system.\n\nA: If you go into the iTunes preferences, and then look under the Devices tab, does that previous backup still show?  I'm hoping it didn't somehow get overwritten/deleted when you setup the new phone.  Also, be sure not to confuse the backup with the synchronization.  People often do is all.  From my experience, renaming the phone at initial setup shouldn't in any way affect your ability to restore a previous backup later on.\n", "Q: How do I diagnose the source of crash on my MacBook Pro? My Intel Core Duo MacBook Pro 15\" has been crashing more and more.\nPreviously there were various types of screen-freezes.\nNow the screen-freeze is being followed by an auto-reboot, which suggests to me a serious memory fault. Auto-reboot is a 3-5 second freeze followed by sudden system reboot, that reloads the OS like normal.\nI have backed everything up and run Drive Genius programs to defrag and verify the drive, but the problems have come back.\nMy current plan is to replace the hard drive.\nMy question is: what else could be going on here?\nCan RAM or CPU chips be the of cause this? Is there any way to check that?\nScreen-freezes include any of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*everything but the mouse freezes\n\n*everything freezes but no graphics distortion\n\n*all graphics distortion (whole screen; couple times with trippy mouse tracer effect)\n\n*all graphics fade to an eerie pale blue color (3 second fade time)\n\n\nSpecs\n\n\n*\n\n*Processor 2.16 Ghz Intel Core Duo\n\n*Memory 2 GB 667 Mhz DDR2 SDRAM\n\n*100GB hard drive (profiler doesn't show me the model) \n\n*This is the first generation of Intel MBPs; purchased new in 2006 I think.\n\n\nA: Doesn't sound like a hard drive failure to me; maybe RAM or - worse - anything logic board.\nTry the already mentioned AHT and try to find error logs via Console (if you don't know where to start looking, try narrowing your options by looking at the timestamps, they'll pretty much stop after whatever went wrong and then continue after the reboot with a noticeable time shift)\nOther things you could try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Verifying Volume and File Permissions, ideally while booting from a\nrecovery/install disc, not the installation on the hard drive.While\nthe graphical errors don't seem to be caused by a hard disk problem,\nthe OS crashes themselves might be because of corrupted files that\ncause problems when being read/written.\n\n*Running a memory test and / or removing RAM modules to see whether one of those is faulty. In my experience though, faulty memory is\nmore likely to result in the device not starting up at all.\n\n*Try to check the temperatures of various parts of your machine, e.g. with iStats (and/or check whether you can simply feel your\nmachine getting noticeably hot). Graphical errors and/or freezes\nmight be due to overheating of components resulting in an emergency\nshutdown to prevent damage to the hardware.\n\n\nA: An Apple Hardware Test can help you diagnose many hardware-related issues. http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1509\nYou can also check Applications -> Utilities -> Console to see if the system logged any information related to the crash.\n", "Q: How can I reduce the size of iCal files? I've exported one of my Google Calendars – 336kb \nI then imported it into iCal and exported it without modification – 1.7mb \nIs there a problem that would the file size increase so much?\nIs there any way to trim the fat? \n-- Mac OS 10.7.2 \n\nA: Not sure how you are measuring the size of the iCal information but when you exported the events from Google Calendars you got the bare event information in a transport form (.ics)\nWhen this gets imported into iCal the data formats for that application must be created together with any linking and additional data. I would suspect if you were to be privy to the internal storage format of the Google Calendar it would also take up more than 336KB.  \nIt's a fact of life with software that the data storage formats will take more space than the bare contained data as the software needs to add more than just your data to provide functionality. \nAs an example create yourself a TextEdit document and type a single space save then look at the size of the file.\nIf you save as plain text it's 1 byte, save as RTF and it's 328 bytes, and save as Word(docx)it's 3528 bytes. \n", "Q: Is it possible to schedule running Mail.app rules? I have a number of rules in Mail.app (these ones work!) to move e-mails which are X days old to trash.\nI'd like to run these rules at a specified time, eg: midnight.

The BOSE website and even the box says: \n\nThe QuietComfort 15 inline remote and microphone cable is compatible\n  with iPod nano (4th, 5th and 6th generation), iPod classic (120GB,\n  160GB only), iPod touch (2nd, 3rd and 4th generation), iPhone 3GS,\n  iPhone 4, iPad and iPad 2, and Macbook (unibody) and Macbook Pro. The\n  remote is supported by iPod shuffle (3rd generation). Audio is\n  supported by all iPod models. Requires latest iPod software.\n\nAlthough it doesn't specifically mention a Macbook Air, one would believe that the machines are using similar technology, but since it's not mentioned, I cannot be sure. I'm ready to go to an Apple store, buy it, test it and if it doesn't work, then return it right there, but perhaps someone can save me the trouble. I'm looking to use Skype (and similar) apps. \nDoes anyone has first hand experience with this combination and can confirm if the BOSE's inline-microphone will work when plugged into a Mid-2011 Macbook Air audio plug? \nUPDATE: I tested this in the Appstore with my Macbook Air and it works, despite the models (air) not being shown in the package description. It appears as \"external microphone\" (replacing the internal, so you cannot switch between the internal mic and this).\n\nA: I have a 2011 MacBook Air 13\" and I can confirm that the microphone on the original iPhone 4 headphones works when plugged into my Air. They show up as \"External Microphone\" in System Preferences.\nI think that with a Y cable, one could use normal headsets which come with two plugs. There are overpriced Y cables available for recording apps on the iPhone, but I'm sure there are cheaper alternatives.\nNote that the MacBooks (also Pro) all have two jacks, one combined for analog/digital out, one for line in. Later, the analog/digital out jack was replaced with analog/digital out, analog in like on the iPhone, but the microphone jack remained. I'm not sure about the current MacBook Pro, but my 2008 unibody MacBook still had two jacks, even though line in was available on the headphone jack, too.\nSo, regarding your Q: I'm reasonably sure the Bose headphones will work with your Air.\n\nA: Yes, I have a Macbook air with Skype and Quite comfort QC 15 headphones with the iphone cable fitted on it and it works like a charm.\nMicrophone is detected as an external mic and headphones as a plugged in headphones. 100% tested on a Macbook air 13\" mid 2011\n\nA: Laptops have 2 plugs one for mic in and one for audio. Perhaps there is an adapter i doubt the headphones would work out of the box without some adplapter for the mic jack\n", "Q: Is there a 3rd party program that can change the cursor size? I've always used a larger mouse icon in Windows (made it easier to find when zipping around multiple screens :p). Recently switched to using OSX and discovered that the option to enlarge the mouse icon does just that, literally.\nIt just zooms the mouse up... Normally this wouldnt be an issue, except when I use photoshop, the icons are all larger than their effect area (ie, brush size is inaccurate) due to the mouse literally being scaled up.\nIs there another application that can replace the system mouse rather than just scaling it up??\n\nA: If you open System Preferences>Universal Access>Mouse & Trackpad, you can adjust the cursor size to be larger. To my knowledge, there is no third party application that will do this since it is allowed natively. Hope this helps!\n\nA: Occassionally I use Mouse Locator when giving demos to help the audience track my mouse movements. Mouse Locator doesn't increase the size of the mouse pointer per say, instead it \"paints a target\" around the pointer when you start moving the mouse. The target makes it easier to locate the pointer location. Omnidazzle also does this, but the effects are flashier. \n\nA: Yolo mouse, It can change both size and color you are also able to change on the fly.  You can also import different styles and use them ans well in small medium and large.\n", "Q: Setting up Apple TV without a TV How can I make my Apple TV 1st gen join a WiFi network without having a TV connected?  Is there an OSX utility for set up in the same way there is with Airport Express?\n\nA: No. You need to connect the AppleTV to a video output of some sort, otherwise there's no way to specify the SSID (the WiFi network identifier) and the password (if any). After you've done that once, you can unplug it from the video output.\n\nA: YES!  It can be done.  If the bluetooth method isn't working (turning on Apple TV and touching your iPhone to the device to configure), you can work your way through the menus and manually enter your wifi password using the voiceover command.  This activates automatically when you first plug in Apple TV. I needed Apple TV only for my music receiver (and don't own a tv), so I ran HDMI from the Apple TV device to my receiver, made sure my receiver was on so I could hear voice commands and then found images of the on-screen keyboard Apple TV uses (easy image search on Google).  Using the voice commands and these images, I could get through the menus and select everything (including a long gibberish password) with the remote.  Once I got going with the voiceover, it took under 10 minutes. \n", "Q: CD with data not opening in selected application I am hainvg a problem with an app called Reunion 9. My dad made me a CD/GED file with data from his PC and I'm trying to load it onto my MacBook Pro. When it initially opened, it gave the screen to choose an app. I clicked Adobe, but that won't work. Now, I can't get back to that screen to try something else.\nIt automatically goes to Adobe and tells me it won't work.\nGot any suggestions for how to return to the application selection screen and what application I should select?\n\nA: it's reasonably simple to change the default application (the process is quite similar to that on windows)\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Finder to find the file you are trying to open.\n\n*Right Click (or Ctrl left Click) Choose \"Open With\" -> \"Other\"\n\n*Use the resulting finder window to find the application you want to open the file with (you may need to change the \"Enable\" drop down to \"All Applications\")\n\n*Tick the checkbox, \"Always open with\"\n\n*Click \"Open\"\n\n", "Q: Control AppleTV with terminal or web? Is there any way to control an Apple TV 1st gen either through terminal connection or a web interface (ideally using a REST interface)?\nBy \"control\" I mean don't mean \"control everything\".  One example use-case would be: Give the ATV a MP3 stream URL and have it play. \nIf some kind of \"hacking\" or plugin is involved, that's ok!\n\nA: No, there is no such interface available for the default ATV2 shell, however you could install XBMC (jailbreaking required) and use XBMC API to control it. \nIf you really want to control the default interface (now called AppleTV.app), you have two possible routes (both beyond the scope of this site and question):\n\n\n*\n\n*Reverse engineer the protocol used in the remote app.\n\n*Reverse engineer the AppleTV.app and use some way (mobilesubstrate) to inject hooks for functions or whole network interface.\n\n\nA: If you jailbreak your Apple TV, you can SSH into it. I'm not sure what the functionality would be, but it can be done. You would then use these steps to access it remotely.\nDoes that answer your question?\n", "Q: How to switch to underlying window of the same application? If I have 2 windows of the same program open (Google Chrome for instance), and I want to get to the underlying one, how can I do that -- without minimizing the fore window.\nIf I click the Chrome icon, in the bottom tray it justs shows me the window in the front. There is no window in the right of the tray since it it not minimized. If I command+tab, I just get one icon for the application, which focuses the window that is already in front.\nThe only way I know of to get to the rear window is to minimize (or move out of the way) the front window. I find this slightly annoying, (and sometimes even forget I have a second window open because I don't know of anything indicating there is a second window open?) \nSo is there another way?\n\nA: You can switch between an app's windows using a keyboard shortcut, a menu bar item, the app's Dock icon, and Mission Control.\nThe keyboard shortcut to switch to the next window behind the current one is cmd+`. That corresponds to the Window-> Cycle Through Windows menu bar item. The menu item isn't available in all apps, but the shortcut usually is.\nYou can also use the Window menu in the menu bar to go directly to the window of your choice. Each window is shown there, and you can click on its item to switch to the window.\n\nA similar menu is available in an app's Dock icon's contextual menu (access by clicking and holding, or right/control-clicking):\n\nYou can also acces visual previews of all of an app's windows and click on the preview of the window you want to switch to. To do this, press F10. This brings up Mission Control's Application Windows function. You can also access this function by the Show All Windows item in an app's Dock icon's contextual menu.\n\n", "Q: What part of the MacBook Pro 13-inch 2.4 GHZ (Mid 2010) logic board is what sensor? My MacBook Pro 13-inch 2.4 GHZ (Mid 2010) starts up normally but after approximately one minute the fan accelerates and the system slows down dramatically. The CPU load goes up to 99% as I see it on Activity Monitor. The laptop is running without battery as it suffered a water spill some months ago. There is no virus and no other process is using large amounts of memory. \nThe problem was thought to be linked to a DC-in board that I replaced after the water damage. The DC-in board was working fine and the input voltage is approximately 16v as seen on a voltimeter. Apple Hardware Test gives me this code: 4SNS/1/1C0000008:TN1D--124\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I check what part of the logic board is what sensor?\n\n*If there is a faulty temperature sensor on the logic board how can I find it and replace it using the above code?\n\n\nA: This issue is definitely related to the logic board. There is definitely damage to the board from the liquid spill and likely ESD damage from when you replaced the MagSafe board. \nThere is no supported way to replace or find a temperature sensor on your model MacBook Pro. In order to replace a sensor on one of these boards you'd have to solder off the old one and solder on a new one. Since no one sells temperature sensors for the boards that integrate them, it would be a nearly impossible feat. \nI'd recommend taking it to the Apple Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider for a full repair. They may not be able to service it since you've serviced your own machine.\nI know this isn't the news you were hoping for, but I hope it helps. \n\nA: There are a number of sensors (6 or 7 I think), but I don't know where they are all located. I would really appreciate an annotated photo if someone can put one together.  I know there is one in the SATA cable that goes to the hdd, and I know there is one on the heat-sink.\nI have a similar problem/symptom on my MacBook Pro 13\" ... (which was given to me). I don't think it suffered water damage but rather shock damage.  \nAfter replacing the hdd with an ssd, and replacing the broken glass, the only remaining problem was that the CPU was being throttled, presumably due to a heat problem.  However, what was encouraging was the throttle problem was intermittent. So, whilst trying find more info about this, I came across www.ifixit.com and posted there.  They suggested I change the hdd SATA cable since it wears from heat over time.  I was sceptical and decided to take mine to Mac Doctors first.  Their diagnosis didn't sway me either way (since they just wanted to replace sub-assemblies for $$$), and so I decided to order the cable and see.  Their delivery was good, but replacement of the cable, in my case, didn't fix my problem.  So I went and bought some heat transfer compound, and will do the CPU/GPU heat-sink when I get some info about the other sensors.\nIn spite of what Matt says, where he is essentially paraphrasing what the industry wants you to believe, once you find the component, it is quite possible to replace it, even when its a SMT device. (Not every device has dozens of tiny pins.)\nAs I don't know where all the other sensors are, I can't say whether they're integrated into a component (like the SATA cable) or whether they're stand-alone components.\nEither way, Apple would have purchased the sensors from someone, so getting a replacement will be a matter of finding a supplier from whom you can make a purchase.  (Which would be made easier if you can identify somehow; who the manufacturer is and what the part number is.)\nAnother possibility is to get a board that's failed for some other reason, and cannibalise it.\nAs far as soldering, SMT soldering gear is affordable.  What you need beyond a normal solder iron, solder and flux; is a stand with a good light, a magnifying glass, some means of holding the board steady, and a solder tip with a sharp point. Some practice of the technique before you attack your computer would be handy.  \nAll in all, if you can't fix the existing board, it will be cheaper to purchase another Mac, 2nd hand as I don't think getting it repaired is economical considering the quotes I got from Mac Doctors last week.\nCheers,\nNap\n", "Q: Can the clock speed of my 2011 MBAir i7 be slowed to conserve power? Most of what I do with my 2011 i7 MBAir could be done with 10% of the available processor power. Is there a hack to slow the processor to conserve battery for the 95% of the time I don't need it?\n\nA: The Intel i5 and i7 processors have a number of features that will definitely conserve power or optimize it for those peak moments. You can't slow it down programmatically but you can be sure that the OS is doing all it can.\nIt's a good question, though, because an i7 processor running at 1.8Ghz doing nothing could be running at 1.2 and save power. In any case, I'm sure that one of the worst battery hungry things is the display. Make sure you dim it often when not using, use a lower brightness setting, turn off bluetooth if/when you don't use it, if you don't need network connectivity, turn wireless off, etc. Basic obvious ideas.\nI have a free handy tool, similar to App Tamer mentioned by @ioi, that I occasionally use, Freeze Frame. You can simply stop certain processes from using any CPU at all, therefore letting the CPU to slow down. (Remember that with Turbo Boost it can go up!).\nBut I am not aware of a specific way to slow DOWN the processor. I'm sure Intel did its job there and the processor is clever enough to save as much as it can.\n\nA: There is an application I know of that works well to conserve battery power, minimizes processor usage, etc. It doesn't necessarily slow down your processor, but rather manages all of the processes your currently running, not running, have idle, etc. \n\n\n*\n\n*App Tamer [15-day free trial]\n\n\n\n\nA: This is handled automatically at a hardware level. You cannot alter your processor's clock speed via an app.\n", "Q: How to better use a Mac mini as a home theater PC with a television set? I'm running a Mac mini into a television set via HDMI. With the Plex application for Mac, the experience is fantastic. But I've been looking for ways to make the \"computer side\" more couch friendly. I'm not expecting to write Pages documents or anything, but Web browsing, or working with system settings would be great too.\nI've been able to enlarge some on screen text (like title bars, etc.) but it's still not a great experience. In the end, I'd like to keep the same screen real estate, but be able to read the screen more comfortably from my Lay Z Boy. For example, increasing the size of text in menus would be really helpful.\n\nA: The following will work on Lion. You need Xcode as well (maybe you can copy just Quartz Debug from another machine; if not, you can remove the developer tools after following my steps).\nRun Quartz Debug from /Developer/Applications/Performance Tools/, click on Window menu, then on UI Resolution, then check Enable HiDPI display modes.\nLog out, log back in and go to System Preferences, Displays and choose one of the HiDPI resolutions.\nThis will effectively double all UI elements, including font and button sizes, menus etc. This is still work-in-progress, though, so expect glitches. Apple is working on resolution independent UI since forever, but with Lion came a new way of just doubling every pixel. The advantage is that this will work with nearly every application, whereas truly resolution independent UI would need vector graphics for every UI element.\nI'm using this on a 46\" LCD TV from time to time, to make accessing iTunes easier. One way to quickly switch between HiDPI and normal modes is to check \"Show displays in the menu bar\" (translating from german, might be labelled differently) in Displays preferences. This will add a menu extra to the menu bar with which you can quickly choose from previously used resolutions.\n\nA: I connect to my Mac Mini HTPC in one of two ways. I use a laptop to remote desktop into the mini and control it that way or I use my iPad and and app called iTeleport to remotely control the mini. I changed the display settings to 1600x900 and everything is a lot bigger and easier to read. Hope that helps.\n", "Q: Is Mac OS X's two finger scrolling damaging to your hand? I've noticed an unusual feeling associated with Mac OS X's two fingering scrolling.  Any chance this might indicate a repetitive stress injury in the making?  I've been trying to rotate the fingers I use for scrolling somewhat, but not terribly successfully.  Anyone else found solutions to this potential issue?  (related)\n\nA: Out of all the Mac users I've ever heard of/seen, none of them have ever said anything like this. I swift touch of a trackpad of mouse certainly doesn't seem to be any sort of damaging movements. If you end up having problems with it more you could ask a more 'medical' associated person. I've personally never heard anything like it, but muscle pains can be worsened from certain movements causing stress. Good luck!\n\nA: I have been experiencing a strong inflammation on the middle finger articulation, which I think it might be caused by the macbook mouse and repetitive movements of scrolling and clicking. I have a ultrasound tomorrow.\nMy doctor doesn't think this is from the mouse, but probably she doesn't know this type of mouse.\n\nA: In the past I have noticed a clear correlation between discomfort in my index finger, middle finger and wrist and the use of a magic mouse/trackpad.\nI really love the functionality, but I am confident that the use of my magic mouse was the source of discomfort. It wasn't exactly pain, but more the feeling my fingers were not aligned properly any more or touched each other differently and sometimes a strange tension. There was no clear visual difference between my right and left hand.\nAs a teenager I had a wake up call with regards to RSI when my neck got stuck/blocked when I tried to reach for a shirt on the top shelf of my closet. It took two days before the muscles relaxed. Since then I have been extra careful to listen to my bodies signals. For me trackballs work well.  I use a Logitech M570 trackball.\nMy hand still acts up when I use my MacBook on the couch a couple of nights in a row. \n\nA: I have only ever experienced the opposite - I have frequently ended up with sore fingers from ONE finger scrolling on traditional mice. I've been a cross-platform developer for decades, including the one-button Apple mouse era so I'm a good data point for comparing both.\nCurrently, my desktop has a Bamboo touchpad and scroll-wheel mouse on my PC then an Apple Magic Mouse on the left of my Mac keyboard with a Magic Pad on the right of my keyboard. I use two-fingers for scrolling on both Mac and PC on the pads and prefer it to using the scroll wheel on my PC mouse.\nIn particular, with the pads, you can scroll with a hand gesture that is more of a swipe, unlike the single-finger on the traditional mouse.\n\nA: I've noticed an obvious correlation btw recent work involving internet searching and posting- my hand is very swollen on the back and extremely sore- hurts even to wash my hands, and getting worse. I use a track pad with 2 finger scroll, but even typing hurts now. Have tried to switch to traditional mouse, but I'm not familiar enough- too many things I can't seem to do. And typing left handed doesn't really work anyway. \n", "Q: How can I find the free app of the day? I'm a Mac user. I want to know which software will help me find the free app of the day in the App Store?\nApp store always lists the free apps, but it doesn’t display the original price of the applications.\n\nA: I use Store News which is excellent for finding out price drops and discounted apps.\nIf you have an iOS device, try AppZapp - allows you to set watch lists, and push notifications and has the ability to track Mac Apps too.\n\nA: AppShopper is my personal favorite . Notifies you change of version bumps and price changes if the item is in your Want list.\n", "Q: Is there a way to combine sound settings on iOS? I have discovered that iOS (5) has two sound settings: \"Sound effects\" and just \"sound\" with no title. Due to this I often have sound effects muted but not other app sounds, and it's not easy to mute/enable one type of sound and not the other.\nIs there any way in iOS 5 to change both sound effects and general sounds using only the volume rocker?\n\nA: I believe the setting you are after is in\nSettings -> Sounds  Change with Buttons = On\n\nA: It looks like the answer is simply no, sound effects and general sound are two different volume levels. \nThe reasoning seems to be that some apps are focused around sound, so muted sound effects doesn't mean music shouldn't play.\n", "Q: How can I restore sent mail from a backup? I like to keep sent mail, I file it periodically.  Unfortunately, I must have changed my settings to delete mail older than 1 month.  So now I'm trying to restore mail from a backup.

I seem to remember photo albums that I created/edited on my iphone syncing via icloud with iphoto and my ipad. After a full restore and update, I can no longere make this work. Please help.\n\nA: iCloud only synchronizes photos in your 'Camera Roll' through Photo Stream.\niCloud doesn't synchronize photo albums.\nIt is possible to synchronize photo albums in iPhoto with your iOS device, but for that you need to sync your iOS device with iTunes on your Mac.\nConnect your iOS device with your Mac > click on your device in the left column in iTunes > click the 'Photo' tab > there you can select which photo albums you want to sync with your iOS device.\n\nA: All you have to do is make a Photo Stream like you would an album.

I plugged a Toslink cable into that (I can see the red light!), and plugged the other end into a toslink-to-mini-toslink adapter, and plugged it into the \"line in\" port of my Mac.\nUnfortunately, it doesn't seem to do anything.  In the Sound control panel, even with the Input Volume turned all the way up, the \"Input Level\" shows nothing at all.  In Audacity, recording just records empty silence.\nI have two Macs, and the behavior here is exactly the same on both.  One's an Intel Mac Mini Core Duo (\"Macmini1,1\"), and the other's a Macbook Core 2 Duo (\"MacBook2,1\").  According to the spec sheets, both have Toslink input.  I frequently use Toslink output on both Macs using this cable.\nI've recorded audio onto both Macs using analog audio cables and Audacity before many times.  Is there anything special I need to do to enable Toslink audio input?\n\nA: Just to be sure:\nYou mentioned checking the Sound control panel on the Macbook input side (I assume you selected Line In as well), but what about the output device on the Mac Mini?  Plugging in the cable usually switches system output to Line Out, but not necessarily the output of whatever application you are using.  So check both the Sound control panel output and the settings of your playback application (if it has any).\nAlso make sure the TOS connecter seats all the way (usually with a click).  The Line In defaults to analog and, IIRC, it only switches to TOS if it senses a non-conductive plug clicking on some little switch.\n", "Q: Changing file permissions on 10.6.8 after restore A friend has a Macbook Pro that had the drive crash.  A new hard drive was installed in the system and the OS was reinstalled.  However, when they restored from their backup (using Retrospect), the User profile folder and system sub-folders all were restored with their original permissions.  \nSo in the User folder, is an \"Ash Williams\" folder and an \"Ash\" folder.  And in each of those folders are: Documents, Downloads, Applications, etc.  Since the permissions were restored, the duplicate folders can't be deleted or renamed.\nI figure I can enable root and then delete/change the extra folders or I can boot to single user mode and the do a chmod on them, but I wanted to get the collective opinion.\n\nA: If you are not comfortable with chmod commands, (as an administrator user) right click on the folder with the incorrect permission and choose \"Properties\". Then under \"Sharing and Permissions\" click on the Settings wheel button and select \"Choose new owner...\" and enter the new owner's name (you may need to \"Apply to enclosed items...\" too)\n\nA: Just launch Terminnal.app and delete the duplicate folder using:\nsudo rm -rf \"/Users/Joe Duplicate\"\n\nWARNING! DO NOT FORGET THE QUOTES. This is especially important in your case because you could accidentally delete the wrong Ash folder.\n", "Q: How does one type an \"É\" (capital e acute) in the French keyboard layout in Mac OS X? I've searched the web for a method to type an \"É\" character with a french keyboard layout in firefox.\nIt appears I'm supposed to type ⌥+E, and then ⇧+E to achieve this, but as soon as I press ⌥ and E simultaneously, an\nê\ncharacter appears. Why, and what should I try instead?\nI'm using Lion.\n\nA: To type this character, type ⌥+E, then ⇧+E. \"É\" is the character I get. \nIn Lion, I understand one can hold down the key, a la iOS, and get a list of possible characters with accents for many of the keys:\n\n\nA: The standard dead-key combo for a French layout is ⌥ + Shift + &, then Shift + E.\n\nA: For those who have a Swiss-French layout here are the key combinations to make É:\n⌥ + ^, then Shift + E.\nIn Swiss-French layout, the symbol ` is the grave accent and can be accessed by Shift + ^ and the acute accent ´ is accessed by the other combination: ⌥ + ^.\nOnly the grave accent is printed on the top of the ^ key.\n\nA: French layout?\n\n\n*\n\n*Press caps lock ⇪.\n\n*Press the é key (that's the 2 on a QWERTY).\n\n*Press caps lock ⇪ again.\n\n\n\nBut you need to make sure you're using the French layout, and not French - numeric (“Français - numérique”, French flag with “123” beneath it). \n\nOtherwise, you're explicitly asking the system to use the caps lock key as a shift lock for the numbers bar on the top of the keyboard!\n\nA: You can use Edit menu and press Special Character (option + Command + T) and from opening window go to Latin tab and find É.\n \n\n\nA: in Lion just hold e or if you need in uppercase hold Shift + e and you will have an option pop up\n\nA: In French grammar, the rules are that there are no accents on upper case letters. This error was introduced with Microsoft word which enforced accenting upper case letters and was fixed since then. The rules never changed and it is still grammatically wrong to put an accent on an upper case letter in French.\n", "Q: Why can't I no longer boot into my MacBook Air?

This is a general question about configuring a machine for video editing and hopefully can be useful over a longer amount of time since the discussion is about general architecture and not necessarily model specific.\nI understand there are variables influencing performance of a video editing machine  - processor speed, the application's reliance on video board vs CPU for processing, amount of memory available, and storage drive throughput speeds (vs burst speeds.)   I am getting set to put together an order for a new iMac (27\") and need help with drive configuration because that is the most costly portion - the additional money for a larger processor, memory and video board pales in comparison to the storage piece. \nIf it matters to the discussion I'll be doing hobby video editing - nothing longer than an hour or so. Typically lots of short clips and stills and transitions. I haven't settled on the software yet but it will need to be more complex than iMovie.\nJust to be clear the components I'm considering when thinking about storage configuration are OS/application, source media, and export media. (if there is another variable I'm missing - such as temporary media -please educate me on that as well.\nHere are my performance-related drive configuration questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it advantageous to split the application off onto a separate drive? Or can I have the application and one form of media on the same drive?\n\n*If I had to put the App and some media on the same drive, should that media be the source media or the export media?\n\n*Would a firewire 800 drive be fast enough as a drive to export to?\n\n*Would a firewire 800 drive be fast enough to use for my source media?\n\n*I'm fairly certain I don't want to have my source media and my export media on the same drive - is that correct thinking?\n\n*I don't think the iMac has an eSATA port for that type of external drive. Can one be added easily?\n\n*Is video editing application intensive enough to warrant an expensive electronic drive?\n\n\nThanks for the help!\nCraig\n\nA: Without more details about what camera you're shooting with, and what type of color space and compression you're working with, it's hard to give definitive answers for some of these questions. But...\n1) Yes. In general you'd want to keep your app separate from the media. Usually you'd have OS X and your editing software of choice installed on the system's main internal drive. It would be kind of silly to have them installed on an external drive anyway.\n2) The only situation where you should have the app and any media on the same drive is where the only drive you have is your internal drive and everything's getting stored there. This is fine for home use, but in a professional situation this would limit disk throughput prohibitively.\n3) Depends on what format you're compressing to. It's all about bit-rate. FW800 is roughly 800 Mbits/second or 100 MB/s.\nIt's important to realize that, depending on your drive, this can be further limited by the drive's speed. Even though the FW800 connection can carry 100MB/s the drive may not be able to read or write fast enough to saturate it.\nYou really need to think about what format(s) you're exporting to, how fast the machine you're building can encode to those formats, and what kind of data rates that produces. That'll give you a number to shoot for.\nIf exporting HD in H.264 codec on a 2-core machine, even a USB 2.0 drive (max ~30MB/s) can usually keep up, so it really depends on what you're doing.\n4) This is where you really need as much speed as possible. If your footage is coming mainly from compressed sources, like an HDSLR, or AVCHD or HDV camcorder this will reduce the amount of bandwidth you need. If you have uncompressed footage, it'll be exponentially greater.\nAlso, you need to know how many streams you want to be able to read from the disk at the same time when editing. Crunch the bit-rate numbers for the formats you're shooting in and you should get a total that you can try to equate to the speed of a source drive.\n5) Because of the differences in speed requirements I just outlined, and the fact that during encoding, you'd be reading from and writing to the same drive, I'd say your instinct is right here. For consumer situations having everything on one drive is fine, it's just slower.\n6) You could probably add eSATA to only the MacPro, but have a look at Thunderbolt instead. The drives are still expensive right now, but if you need something VERY high end, you can get insane speeds beyond eSATA or USB 3.\n7) By electronic drive I'm assuming you mean an SSD. Having an SSD as your Mac is a great thing. It does so much for the user experience, that if you can afford it, just get it.\nWhat I think you're asking though, is if you should use it as a scratch/temp disk? There's been some debate about the longevity of SSDs when it comes to high amounts of reads/writes (which is what a scratch drive does all day), so right now I'd still probably say it's not cost effective as a scratch drive.\nIf you're getting the iMac and want to trick it out, get the configuration with the SSD + internal HDD. Use the SSD for the OS and apps, and dedicate the HDD to be used as a scratch disk.\nFrom there, for your externals, you have lots of choices. The iMac has one FW800 and two Thunderbolt ports. Something you didn't ask about, but is very important, is ingesting footage. When importing footage into the machine I assume you'd want that to be as fast as possible as well.\nIf your drives are on the FW800 bus, you'd want your card reader on the USB bus to maximize the bandwidth available. i.e. Read over USB, write over FW800, rather than trying to do both over either, essentially halving your bandwidth.\nIf you end up with thunderbolt drives, get a FW800 card reader, which will dramatically speed up your ingest (once your cards can keep up). The Thunderbolt bus has more than enough headroom at this stage (10Gb/s) to handle reading and writing at the same time, so no worries there.\nAnother thing you should think about is backup. If you can afford a pair of Thunderbolt RAID 5 arrays (one for source, one for export), do it. You'll thank yourself later.\nI hope I provided some general advice, but there are lots of configurations you could put together. It really depends on your needs. You need to look at what you're shooting on and exporting to, and how you edit, then do some calculations.\n", "Q: What is the use of a clean OS (Lion) install? My machine is a iMac8,1 (24\", early 2008) that I bought with Mac OS 10.5 Leopard installed. My question is: what are all the benefits and drawbacks of performing a clean operation system (OS) install? Specifically a clean Lion install in contrast to an incremental upgrade plan.\nWhat I already know:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrading to Snow Leopard and subsequently to Lion was easy and without loss of any data. I am aware of obsolete clutter being automatically removed in the processes (mostly PowerPC support), however, I can imagine that some is still present, e.g. Leopard and Snow Leopard system files that are now obsolete. They unnecessarily occupy space.\n\n*Another arbitrary advantage of a clean install has more to do with ‘personal hygene’: old (third party) programs that I haven't used (and associated files) won't be re-installed.\n\n*A third and last benefit of a clean install has to do with the physical space the OS occupies on the hard disk drive (HDD). Since the OS is practically the first thing on the disk it occupies the (faster) outer ‘rings’ of the HDD. That makes the OS faster than if it would occupy the inner rings. I presume that happens in the incremental upgrade as I did.\n\n\nWhat are other advantages and disadvantages of a clean install? And are there any gaps or inconsistencies in what I already know?\n\nA: There are no disadvantages to a clean installation. But the return on Lion has been severely culled due to Apple's decision to prevent any kind of modification to the OS. With previous OS X builds, users were able to select (and deselect) packages (such as printer drivers, extended languages, etc.) during the installation process. Lion brings everything and the kitchen sink. \nThe ability to trim away parts of OS X was probably the most compelling reason to perform a clean install (saving GB of space).\nYour notion of how hard drives work isn't accurate. There's no \"prime\" location for data, outer ring or inner ring. So long as the files are contiguous, your data will be delivered optimally. Access times depend on rotation latency (speed at which the disks spin, calculated in RPM) and seek times (the time it takes the head to reach the desired location to reach the file), although density plays a role too, by packing more bits of data per region (thus increasing throughput).\nMoreover, OS X handles the defragementation of small files on a regular basis, ensuring continued performance over time. It's also of note that such things are gone by way of using SSDs.\nLastly, clean installations may also reduce bugs introduced by updates. While OS X is quite resilient, updates can introduce new bugs into the system. Often times, Apple technicians will request a clean installation and applying only the latest subsequent update in an attempt to isolate bugs (rather than upgrade from a previous version of the OS and then applying a slew of incremental updates). These problems are however quite rare.\n\nA: The benefits of a clean install are that you are left with a system disk whose contents are known, and of 'factory' condition. This will remove any third-party software (which may be interfering with good operation); it will free up space by the removal of 'cruft' - vestigial data files no longer wanted or in use. It will return all settings to their defaults and empty caches and temp files. It will also remove all your user data, so don't forge to backup!\nA clean install is therefore a useful step if you are experiencing some major issues that cannot be resolved by other steps: it is certainly worthwhile if you suspect that your security has been compromised in some way.\nHowever, after a clean install, most people will want to restore all their user data and settings, and their third-part applications and installations, in order to get their system back to a useful state. The usual process is to use Apple's Migration Assistant. The more data that is restored, the less useful the clean install becomes. \nIf you delete 100% of your files, and then restore 97% of them, wouldn't it be better/quicker to identify and remove the 3% instead? Caches and temporary files can be purged easily; software that requires complex installation usually comes with an uninstaller or instructions. Third-party additions tend to live within the subfolders of the root level /Library (or for unixy stuff under /usr/local or /opt). The contents of the User Library can be trawled and deleted largely without consequence.\nOld, forgotten preference files of deleted apps may not be tidy, but the space they occupy is usually trivial. Beware of 'cleaning' applications, which can delete the wrong file just as easily as you. The OS itself contains thousands of files that you will probably never use, but deleting them would be foolish.\nIn short: a clean install has a purpose, but the reasons for needing to do it are few and far between.\n", "Q: How can I disable Safe Boot or the Shift Key? After a spill on the keyboard of my unibody MBP 17\", the ⇧ key reports as always on.\nUnder Windows (BootCamp) and Linux (LiveDVD) I can easily get around the problem by using an external keyboard.\nHowever, when trying to boot into OSX, the system always starts into Safe Mode (as is intended when holding ⇧). This prevents many features from working.\nDisconnecting the internal keyboard from the main board will also disable the power switch, which is thus not an option.\nIs there any way to disconnect the ⇧ key on its own or disable safe-boot altogether?\n\nA: If you can afford it, I would recommend replacing the topcase and keyboard as Apple suggests. If like me, you can't afford it or are open to a hack fix, then read on.\nThe problem\nYesterday, a little water spilt on my 13\" MBP keyboard. I turned it around immediately, drained out the water and used tissue to suck it all up but the keyboard was still acting funny. I turned it off and left it out in the sun for a couple of hours and turned it on again but problems remained. My warranty had run out just a month ago and I knew Apple would not cover this under warranty. I tried to clean the shift keys and left it overnight with some rice on them with hopes that the moisture might get sucked out. Nothing worked. (The rice bit is an urban legend that seems to work with some electronics). Went to the Apple Store this morning and was told that they wouldn't even take out the key and clean it, and that the entire top case would have to be replaced. A total bill of 156 Euros which I cannot afford. I had a USB keyboard that would let me use the Mac for the moment so I decided to try to work out a fix.\nSymptoms\n\n*\n\n*Boots in safe mode everytime (which I later found out was because the shift key is pressed)\n\n*Cannot login because password is in lower case or has numbers\n\n*Cannot boot in super user mode and try to disable keys or override password as some commands won't work in uppercase (I wouldn't recommend this anyway because its super user mode)\n\n*All text is in caps and numbers are symbols as though shift key is always pressed\n\n*Audio doesn't work\n\n*Keyboard viewer would not always show the shift key pressed. The key seemed to get pressed at random\n\nFix\n\n*\n\n*Hold the Option button down on boot to bypass the Safe Mode ensure a normal boot\n\n\n*At the login screen, plug in a USB keyboard and enter your password to login. Switch to “French- Numerical” keyboard and use the Caps Lock key to invert uppercase to lowercase. Note the layout of this keyboard is different, make sure to look up an image of this layout before you type in your original  password.\n\n\n*Change your password to one that uses all caps and no numbers\n\n\n*Download and install KeyRemap4MacBook .\n\n\n*Use a combination of the functionalities of the Keyboard Viewer and KeyRemap4MacBook to figure out which shift key is the problem. In my case, I found out that it was only my left shift key.\n\n\n*Disable the left/right shift key on KeyRemap4MacBook and click on the 'Reload XML' button to make that take effect.\nIf only one shift key was the problem, then you are done. If both shift keys were shorted, then its likely other keys are too. In which case you should probably just replace the entire thing. If you think other keys are not affected, then you can use KeyRemap4MacBook itself to remap the shift functionality to a lesser used key like the Left Option key.\n\n\n*Under System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items , add KeyRemap4MacBook as an application that should start on login. This will ensure that your disable/remap of the shift key is active every time you login.\nUsage change/Things to remember\n\n*\n\n*Remember to hold down the Option key everytime the computer boots or\nreboots to bypass safe mode. The fix above is at the software level.\nThe key is physically still shorted at the hardware level and will\naffect boot.\n\n*Remember that at the login screen, the disable/remap is    not\nactive. So your password now has to be all caps and only letters.\n\nAs soon as I can save some money, I will get my topcase and keyboard replaced but until then this solution works great with minimal change. Hope this helps!\n\nA: Try pressing C when booting. It might help you get pass safe-boot. or you can try using a key remapping app.\nResources:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/14723/Possibility+of+fixing+the+left+SHIFT-key\n\n*http://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/4485/My+shift+key+is+always+on.\n\n\nA: I have the same problem, from the same cause: a spill into my MBP's keyboard rendered it completely nonfunctional, so now I have to use an external USB keyboard. If I don't press any keys at all while booting, it always boots into safe mode. So now instead I always hold down the space bar just after the chime and then it boots normally. \n\nA: I posted this answer to a similar question here: Shift key damaged how to disable at boot\nYou could enable a firmware password.  When a firmware (EFI) password is active it prevents modifier keys during the boot process unless you first disable the firmware password.  Apple's KB article detailing this behavior - HT1352\nI'm going to assume that you can't boot to your recovery partition, or an installer disc, thanks to the stuck shift key.  Typically you would enable the firmware password from either of these options, however it's still possible to do from the OS.\nTo enable the firmware password while inside your OS, 10.7 or newer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter the following string in Terminal.  This enables the debug menu in Disk Utility. defaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled 1\n\n*Open Disk Utility and choose \"Show every partition\" from the Debug menu.\n\n*Your Recovery partition should now be visible on the left side of Disk Utility, select and click Mount to mount it in your system.\n\n*In Terminal, enter the copy & paste the following command to load the Recovery disk image. open /Volumes/Recovery\\ HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/BaseSystem.dmg\n\n*The Recovery disk should open in a new window, browse to it's /Applications/Utilities folder.\n\n*Locate the Firmware Password application and double click to launch it.\n\n*Follow the on-screen instructions to enable a firmware password.  I would recommend keeping this password very simple and easy for you to remember.  The firmware password CAN be bypassed but the difficulty of doing so varies between Macs.\n\n\nIf your version of Mac OS X is 10.6 or older:\n\n\n*\n\n*While booted to your OS, insert the gray restore disc labeled \"Install Mac OS X\".\n\n*Open Terminal and copy & paste the following command, this will open a window showing the Utilities folder from the system installer. open /Volumes/Mac\\ OS\\ X\\ Install\\ DVD/Applications/Utilities\n\n*Double click the Firmware Password application to launch it.\n\n*Follow the on-screen instructions to enable a firmware password.\n\n\nA: To solve stucking with upper case just press fn+conl+shift+f1\n\nA: You need to find the root cause why the Shift key gets stuck and fix it. Look carefully for small object sneaked inside crevice between key and keyboard. It happened to me because a small piece of pencile lead got in which was barely noticable. After reading through this thread made me search through a subtle stuck Shift key and finally got the issue resolved.\n\nA: It works if to press Fn+Ctrl+Left Shift+F1\n", "Q: How to automatically attach E-mail, not embed them How can I add E-Mail-Attachments automatically to an E-Mail, without integrating them? \nEspecially photos!\nMenu -> Edit -> Attachments... doesn't work! \nI use OS X Lion (10.7.2) and Mail (5.1). \nAnyone have any ideas?\n\nA: You can do this individually by dragging the image(s) in, right clicking on them and clicking \"View as Icon\". You can select multiple images at once to do this as well. \nIf you would like Mail to do this automatically with all attachments, try the following Terminal command:\n\ndefaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing -bool yes\n\nRelaunch Mail for this to take effect.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: Mail offers you no way to change the attachment to not be inline. There are ways to change the appearance of it, using 'View as icon', and there is a command line instruction that will set that as the default. But this only applies to you, not the recipient of any messages that you send.\nHowever, it doesn't have to be this way. The MIME protocol does allow for non-inline attachments. But the only way I've found that allows you to utilise this is to use Lokiware's Attachment Tamer, currently $14.99.\n", "Q: Why doesn't my calendar alert me when events are upcoming? I have my Google Calendar synced up to my iPhone 4S and by all the settings I can find, it looks like I am supposed to recieve alerts 15 minutes before every event.  However, this has never happened.\nHow come there is no alert being displayed when an event is upcoming?  I can see it in Notification Centre, but there is no banner or alert.\n\nA: Something that seems to work for Google calendars: on your phone, go to Settings => Mail, Contacts, Calendars. Scroll down to the Calendars block. Select Default alert times. You can then chose phone alerts by type of event.\n\nA: Well, in case anyone is monitoring this, I found the answer on another site!! It has to do with using Mac (or iOS) Calendars, where you've subscribed or otherwise display a google calendar. On the Apple side, it will set up a default notification and there appears to be a bug or miscommunication between Apple and Google. So you have to turn off alerts on the Apple side. Doing so will allow Google Calendar alerts on the \nGoogle side (if you have any set up) to be sent normally, at the correct time, only once (or how ever many you've set up), and from the correct official google calendar account. Here are the instructions from http://support.amitree.com/en/articles/1551880-receiving-too-many-email-alert-notifications\nHow To Stop Them\nYou can disable these additional Apple email alerts by going into your Apple Calendar settings on your iPhone, iPad, or Apple PC. The suggestions below should not stop the Push Notifications on your device.\niPhone/ iPad Instructions\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Apple Calendar app\n\n*Look for and Tap on (!) Calendars at the bottom of the screen\n\n*Scroll to find the relevant Calendar (i.e. Folio Transactions, {name}'s Transactions)\n\n*Tap on the (!) to the right of the Calendar name\n\n*Scroll down to Notifications section\n\n*Tap the toggle switch to disable Event Alerts\n\n\nApple/Mac PC Instructions \n\n\n*\n\n*Control-click (right-click) on the name of the calendar (i.e. Folio Transactions) in the calendar list, then choose Get Info.\n\n*If you don’t see the calendar list on the left, choose View > Show Calendar List.\n\n*Select “Ignore alerts,” then click OK.\n\n\nA: I have also been having the same problem and have found that the solution is to set the reminder in the Google Calendar web interface to \"pop-up\".  You can set this to be your default reminder by going to Settings -> Calendars -> Notifications (in the same row as your calendar).  You can set up multiple reminders here.\nI'm fairly certain that this didn't used to be the case but I'm not sure when it changed (or if it definitely did change).  For reference, I'm using an iPhone 3GS on iOS 5.1\n", "Q: How do I scan for hardware changes? I have had the times where I have used a usb networking card, or other device, and it didn't show up, although I was not sure if it was compatible with OSX. I just was not sure if OSX had a way to scan incase it did not recognize it, or if you needed to install a driver.\nIs there a way to see what hardware is on the machine, like a device manager?\n\nA: Generally speaking there's nothing you have to do except launch the application that supports your hardware.\nIf you add a new network device, it is immediately listed the next time you open the Network preference pane in System Preferences.\nIf you add a new sound device, is it immediately listed in the Sound preference pane in System Preferences. (You can also Option+Click the volume icon in your menu bar within seconds of plugging your device in and see it in the list.)\nYou don't need to \"add new hardware\" to use it. If it is compatible, it generally just shows up.\n", "Q: How to quickly scroll to top of long list in iOS? I've recently hooked my MS Exchange account into Mail.app in iOS, and consequently, the list of email in my inbox is extremely long. iOS has the unfortunate habit of scrolling the mail list to the middle of the list whenever I rotate the iPad, and it takes me a very long time to scroll back up.\nI'm wondering if there's a way to quickly scroll back up to the top of the very long inbox list in iOS Mail.app, so that I can see my unread messages?\n\nA: Tap the Status Bar at the top of the screen.\n\nIn Safari, Mail, Contacts, and many other apps, tap the status bar at\n  the top of the screen — which displays the network information, time,\n  and battery level — to scroll quickly to the top.\nSource: http://www.apple.com/iphone/tips/\n\n\nA: option and the up arrow.  If you are using outlook on a mac, this is the fastest way to get to the top.  I hope that helps because I had the same problem.\n", "Q: How do I change my default \"from\" email address for the iOS Mail app? I changed my \"Default Account\" in Mail Preferences:\n\nAnd this changes my default \"from\" address when I send an email from (say) the Twitter app\nBut when I use the Mail app to send an email, it uses my old \"from\" address by default.\n\nA: If you are creating a new message, then the \"default\" account will be used.  If you are replying to a message in another account, that account will be used as the \"from:\" address.\nIt sounds to me like you want to reply to a message received on (say) Hotmail and have the message come \"from\" a new GMail address. This is not possible to do by default; you will need to change the \"from\" address manually.\n\nA: It seems to be related to the order that the email accounts were created into iOS. If you look at the order of the Accounts in Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars you will see what I mean.\nI don't know of any way to reorder these, except by deleting them and adding them back in the order you want.\n\nA: I'm using iOS 5.0.1 and I'm not seeing your issue at all (iPhone 4 - UK - O2)\nIf I set the default to account A new mail inside does default to using the email address on A.  if I change it to account B, newly composed emails goes from the email on account B.\nreplies to emails defaults to the email address on the account the email was received in. If account A is the default, and an email is received in account B, the from address will default to account B unless you change it whilst composing the reply.\n\nA: For me, this happened because of faulty settings in the outgoing server panel applicable to the particular account. Failing the desired server, mail went to another server, with that server's email sending address. Resolved by deleting all the Mail accounts on the device, then transferring Mail account info from my computer back to the device via iTunes connection (see Info panel on iTunes).\n\nA: This appears to be a \"feature\" in IOS7.  It's been called Smart Mail Account Selection by this author: http://www.infoworld.com/d/mobile-technology/7-hidden-gems-in-ios-7-226957?page=0,0\nwho seems to think this is really great.  And you are correct about the Default mail setting — it's now used for outside apps only.  \nApparently Apple feels it knows better than you what email address you want to appear.  I have not been able to get this to change no matter what order the accounts have been added.  There doesn't seem to be a way to change the setting either.  My son has 2 email addresses.  He once sent me an email from one of them to an email address I rarely use.  Now, every time I try to send an email to him at that email address, the Mail app changes my From address to that rarely used one.  I'm hoping that if I manually change it enough it will \"learn\" that I prefer the other one, because I seem to have no other control over this.  I have spent hours scouring the web for a way to modify this behavior, but have found nothing.  \n\nA: Open the Settings app.\nUnder each of the Mail, Contacts, Calendars and Notes categories, look for a setting named \"default account\". In that setting you will see a list of accounts set up on your phone - simply tap on the one you want to be the default for this phone. Repeat for each four app settings categories. Job done.\nNote that in the 'mail' setttings category, the \"default account\" setting is the very last one right at the bottom in iOS 14.7.1.\n\nA: This is the most annoying problem I've ever had with my iPhone. It's been months of searching but finally found where the old email was on my phone. \nI hope this works for you as well. \nSettings -> Mail, Contacts, Calendars -> Tap on mail account -> (IMAP) Account -> Email -> Swipe to delete old one from the list.\n\nA: The auto switching of the default account to the non-default account was happening to me and it was frustrating. \nI think I may have figured out the problem: Google Sync. A day after I turned off my Google Sync setting (I think it said it may take 24 hours to update), the auto-switching sender problem was solved for me. \n\n\nA: instead of going into All Inboxes; go into the Exchange or yahoo email box for example; the from: will be the one you want when you create new emails.\n\nA: If I understand the question correctly you want to always send replies from the same server? I think what you want to do is configure your outgoing mail server on all your accounts to the the one you always want to use, ie copy the outgoing server from the account you want to use and replace the one in the other accounts with the one you want to use to send out your email.\nIt is easier to just leave things alone and select it on the from line each time but if you can not remember to the above \"fix\" should accomplish it, until Apple corrects it with a setting change.\nEd\n", "Q: Can I use a rotatable DVI monitor with a Thunderbolt port? We're looking at buying new MacBooks for our dev team, and I have a concern about the way Thunderbolt is used in a chain for multiple displays. We're even willing to purchase new, Thunderbolt-capable monitors, but one thing I regularly do is rotate one of my monitors 90°. My understanding is that OOTB Apple displays do not rotate on their stands. I already have a DVI capable ViewSonic monitor that rotates very well, so if I get a Thunderbolt-to-DVI adapter, can I use that as the last device in the Thunderbolt chain?\n(Alternatively, if there is a reasonable approach to rotating an Apple display I would love to hear it.)\n\nA: Yes to both questions: you can plug in a mini DisplayPort adapter at the end, and mini DisplayPort doesn't care about rotation: OS X handles that.\n\nA: I'm not sure about your first question about using a non-thunderbolt device at the end of a thunderbolt chain. However, you can get an Apple thunderbolt display and also purchase the apple VESA mount kit and mount it on one of these types of monitor stands. I believe this would solve your problem and convert you to an all-Apple ecosystem. \nHope this helps!\n\nA: Thundbolt displays have an option to swap out the base \"foot\" with a standard 10cm^2 VESA that you can put onto any monitor mount such as a wall mount, multiple scene mount, etc. which could allow for rotation should the mount support it.\nVESA Mount Adapter Kit for iMac and LED Cinema or Apple Thunderbolt Display\n\nA: Check out the i360 by Rain Design for a decent-looking solution for rotating an Apple Thunderbolt Display.\n", "Q: Can an iPhone be used without iTunes? Can an iPhone (all current models) please be used without having to install iTunes on my home PC?\nWould I need to have my local Apple store activate it for me?\nWhat functionality (if any) would I lose by not having my own copy of iTunes?\n(Such as; download music, install apps, OS security updates, subscribe to and download podcasts, update the sat-nav maps, backup files stored on the phone, etc)\nIf I would lose any functionality without iTunes, would joining iCloud effectively replace iTunes? If so, what limitations (if any) would I experience?\n(I've seen contradictory answers to all these questions over the web and I hope a definative answer can be pinned down.)\n\nA: With iOS 5 and iCloud, iPhones are now PC free. While it is beneficial to have iTunes, iCloud and iOS 5 are able to handle downloading music, installing apps, OS updates, podcasts, and backing up/restoring. Check out the page on Apple's website for a full feature list. \n\nA: Most definitely! \n\n\n*\n\n*For Contacts, you can sync using Yahoo,  MobileMe or Gmail.\n\n*For Calendar you would need Gmail or MobileMe.\n\n*For Music there is plenty of third party software out there 6 Ways To Sync Music To Your iPhone Without iTunes.\n\n\nDepending on whether you are using Verizon or AT&T. You can activate your phone by going to their store or sometimes you are able to call ( I know Verizon is *228). You really shouldn't lose much functionality. Although Apple stuff plays better with Apple stuff. \nIf you really want to pin the answer down, it might be a good question for an employee at an Apple store. They are normally helpful and answer your questions honestly.\n\nA: I just set up a new iPod Touch running iOS 5. The setup process on the iPod Touch either requires connecting to a wi-fi network, or connecting the iPod Touch to iTunes via the usb cable. It wasn't possible for me to connect to a wi-fi network at setup time, so I had to use iTunes.\nI haven't set up a new iPhone running iOS 5 yet, but the iPhone has the cell network in addition to wi-fi. Hopefully someone else explains how this works if you are activating new service or migrating from another phone.\n\nA: Current iOS devices running iOS 5 (iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad) are capable of being standalone devices.  You do not need a computer to use them.\nThe term \"iTunes\" can refer to two things...\nThe iTunes application, which you seem to take issue with, and the iTunes store, where you buy apps, music, movies, etc..\nYou do not need iTunes (the application), but you will find it difficult to avoid using iTunes (the store).\niTunes (the application), makes it possible to use iTunes (the store) on your computer.  This can provide some convenience, but is not necessary.\nAs long as an iOS device can connect to the Internet, you can activate it without a computer or iTunes (the application).\niCloud provides several features.  None of them really replace iTunes (application or store).\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes in the Cloud: You can let Apple store the music you've purchased from iTunes (the store) on their servers and download them on demand (actually, they just store references to which songs you own, they already have all the files stored for iTunes (the store)).  If you sign up for iTunes Match, they'll also store references to your music that is in your iTunes (application) library but wasn't purchased from Apple.  They'll also upload and store your music that they do not have in the iTunes store (within limits).\n\n*Photo Stream: Syncs your photos across all of your devices.  Additional features apply to users of iPhoto or Aperture.\n\n*Documents in the Cloud: store your docs on Apple's servers, access & sync them between devices (requires apps that have been written to take advantage of this feature).\n\n*Backups: Back up your device's data to the cloud\n\n*Sync Apps & Books: Apps and Books purchased through iTunes (store) and the iBookstore (an extension of the iTunes store) can be synced to multiple devices.\n\n*Sync calendar, mail, and contact data.  Comes with an @me.com email account.\n\n*Find my Friends and Find my iPhone: lets you GPS-stalk your friends and family and track your phone if you lose it.  Find my Friends can be useful at big gatherings, and it can be toggled on and off at will in case you don't want your mom to know you're hanging out in the seedy part of town.\n\n\nI hope this is helpful.\n\nA: On music not purchased in the iTunes store:\nI have been looking (am looking) for ways to load music (not purchased in the iTunes store) via wifi onto my iphone. Apparently the preinstalled ipod app can only be loaded via means sanctioned by Apple (iTunes app or iTunes match).\nSo the only way of doing this is to drop the ipod app and replace it with an third party media player. However all players I found so far lack some of the ipod app features. Here are two ways to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dropbox. You can put music into your dropbox folder on your PC. The dropbox app on the iPhone features a simple media player which can playback mp3. No playlists, artist view or album view though. Costs money if you exceed the free storage limit\n\n*There are several download manager apps in the app store, again with a built-in media player, for example \"Downloads\" or \"Fusic\". This requires a web server to access your mp3 library. Mine is on a Linux box with an Apache running, with the mp3 collection mounted and showing the file system contents. No artist view or album view, only a flat list. Single song downloads only, if you want a full album you must load all tracks independently.\n\nA: Yes, you can use Digidna. You can use your iPod as mass storage device. Now, copy the app into the directory and all done. Check this : http://www.infozub.com/2013/12/Digidna-Diskaid-Free-download-including-Features.html\n", "Q: Files Renamed in Finder not Reflected in iTunes? I just did a batch rename in Finder (using AppleScript), however the filenames in iTunes remain unchanged.\nI tried restarting iTunes and that did not help.\nI also tried iTunes >>> File >>> Library >>> Organize Library, but it happens to be grayed out, as I had already recently done this (prior to renaming the said files).\nAny clue how to get these files renamed in Finder to show up in iTunes without manually doing so? It's too large a number to do manually.\nMany thanks\n\nA: Unfortunately, updating the files in Finder will not update the files in iTunes. This is because iTunes uses a file called iTunes Library.itl as a database of all your media.\nYou can however use the automator actions \"Get Specified iTunes Items\" and \"Set Info of iTunes Songs\" to automat the process of updating the metadata. There are some other good Automator actions in there too. \n\nA: What's worse is that by doing this, iTunes has no idea where the renamed files went.  The key to any iTunes-related file management is to do it within iTunes itself. If you choose File -> Library -> Organize, then \"consolidate\" the library, you will see a large number of exclamation marks next to the renamed files.  If you don't re-attach iTunes with them, it will not be able to play those files, sync them, etc.\nThe simplest solution would likely be to restore from backup (or otherwise undo the batch change) then re-write your AppleScript to talk to iTunes instead of Finder.\n\nA: You will need to clear all the songs in your library then drag the media library folder into iTunes,\nThis will reset all the files into iTunes as by renaming the source files you would have broken the links between the software and the music file.\n\nA: When ID3 are missing, it would be very easy for iTunes to read the file name and use that as its track name in ID3 but if there is no ID3 tags on a file it was obviously not purchased from any music store so as far as Apple is concerned it is not a file worth caring about... \n\nA: I would suggest using mp3tag to rename files and change the id3-tags, which tell iTunes what this song called.\nI've tried a couple of programs like this (including Musicbrainz Picard), but this one is really good!\n(I especially love how you can turn the filename into id3 tag and vice versa!)\nThe only problem I still have is that iTunes won't recognize the change...\n", "Q: What Lion maintenance utility should I use?

What is an lion supported equivalent?\nIm looking for a one-stop shop for all my Mac cleaning needs!\nBonus marks for software that can be deployed an managed remotely (on the same LAN)..\nThanks in advance!\nDev\n\nA: Onyx\nI don't know AppleJack, therefore I don't know if this program is sufficient for your needs. Onyx is a free tool for general system maintenance.\n\n*\n\n*You can automize tasks which you do frequently.\n\n\n*Verify the Startup Disk and the structure of its System files, to run misc. tasks of system maintenance\n\n\n*Delete caches, to remove a certain number of files and folders that may become cumbersome, and more.\n\n\nA: I have yet to find a utility that can function as a true one stop shop for me, but here are three programs that I never leave home without, any one of which may come close to your needs.\nCocktail\n\n\n*\n\n*Great day to day maintenance utility\n\n*Lots of basic to moderate options\n\n*Dead simple automation and scheduling for routinely performed tasks\n\n\nTechTool Pro\n\n\n*\n\n*Many similar functions to Cocktail but with more in depth system monitoring and trouble shooting options\n\n*Expanded Disk Utility options compared to Cocktail\n\n*Great for diagnosing problems you didn't even know you had\n\n\nDisk Warrior  \"http://www.alsoft.com/diskwarrior/index.html\"\n\n\n*\n\n*The \"Delta Force\" of disk utility apps\n\n*Your First, Last, and Best line of defense for any disk related problem\n\n*Complete re-construction of failed and lost directories and partitions.\n\n\nAlso, for what it's worth, I too find Onyx to be a great program as well, it's just never found it's way into my permanent arsenal.

My mouse moves around the screen, I can right (secondary) click, but I just can't perform a primary click.\nI'm running 10.6.8 on an Early 2011 MacBook Pro (http://support.apple.com/kb/SP619). The click stops registering both on the trackpad and my Magic Mouse.\nA restart solves the problem.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: I had this same problem: no mouse devices registered a left click (internal trackpad, external trackpad, USB mouse). Right click, oddly, worked.\nIt turned out I had a Magic Mouse I had left in a bag that was turned on. It was compressed which registered as a button press, so no other mice/trackpads could register a left click. Taking it out and turning it off solved the issue.\nI guess OS X doesn't differentiate between input devices.\n\nA: Check that your external trackpad that you now rarely use does not have a book on it!  That’s what confused me for at least 10minutes\n\nA: *\n\n*Double check that you don't have any stuck keys on your keyboard by testing all the keys, particularly the modifiers (shift, option, etc).\n\n*Make sure there aren't any wizards, alerts, or dialogs hidden behind existing windows or in other spaces (this one gets me often, especially running the odd mix of programs I use daily).\n\n\nA: I posted this in another thread, It fixed the single click issue for me.\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/a/130552/78030\n\nA: So I had the same problem on my 2006 macbook, also running 10.6.8.\nI was convinced it was a software problem until I read a post somewhere that said it could be an old battery that has expanded and is putting pressure on the trackpad.\nSo I took out the battery,made sure the power supply was plugged in an booted up...bingo, problem solved.\nI then left my battery in a freezer for a while to make any swelling go down and when I put it back, all working fine for now.\nSo I might have to keep doing this if the problem comes back again :)\n\nA: Macbook Pro with Apple Mouse and battery was at 82%.  The mouse would move but neither the left or right buttons worked.  It turned out to be simply a dirty connection on one of the batteries.  Removed the batteries, scraped the connection on the mouse, re-inserted the batteries and success!\n\nA: restart the bluetooth works for me\n", "Q: App to block data usage on iphone I was wondering if it was possible to block data usage completely when a certain data transfer limit has been reached? Does an app exist for that? \nI am aware there are some apps that allow users to view the data usage, but is there an app to prevent completely from using Data when limit is exceeded, automatically?! This would be especially usefull to prevent the extra fees when exceeding my 1GB data usage limit.\n\nA: No, that is not possible: it would mean Apple allows developers access to deactivating data access. I guess you can understand the security problem that would mean: an app could decide on its own you don't have data access anymore.\nThe only way to do that is to regularly check your data usage in “Settings > General > Usage > Cell network usage” (menu names may not be the exact ones, my iPhone isn't in English, sorry). You can reinitialize these statistics each time your limit is reset.\nIf your limit is crossed, switch data off in “Settings > Network” (iOS 5 only).\n\nA: If you are jailbroken, there are some features around the SBSettings app - you can certainly make it very easy both to see how much data has gone past and switch it with a toggle - it's entirely possible that this could happen automatically... \n\nA: you can use \"data usage\" app  it will notify you when you achieve certain amount of data and then if you reach your desired amount, in your ios device go to:\nsettings > Network > cellular data > OFF\n\nA: It isn't anything to do with the iPhone, but almost all providers will be willing to stop you going over your limit. Just ask them, it'd be easier than a software based solution on your side.\n\nA: You could download an app like Bytes that allows you to track your data use and receive notifications when you reach your limit.\n\nA: Yes, this is possible, and you can set a hard cap on data use. If you are in the USA and have Verizon, you can sign up for their Family Base app.\nAs of 2016, Verizon charge $5/mo ($60/year) for this service. Family Base will let you set alerts and caps for each phone on your account. For instance, I share my account with my data-hogging teenager. After he blew through all my data 2 months in a row, I capped him at half of our shared data allowance using Family Base. He now uses up his half of the data in a week to 10 days, but I get to keep my half, and I don't feel guilty about it at all.\n", "Q: iPhone 4s problems making calls My original 4s had issues with phone calls. Half the time calls were made the person on the other end couldn't hear me. Took to Apple store and they gave me a new phone. I've had it 5 days and it has more issues then my 1st one. 50% of the time I make calls neither person can hear each other. I can't even hear it dialing the #, but I watch the call timer run as it does connect. Tried restoring the phone, but still no luck. Is it a hardware issue or AT&T issue? Anyone know?\n\nA: It sounds like an issue with the hardware of the phone. I'd take it back to the Apple Store and have them swap it again. Before you leave, make a few calls on the new phone and make sure the issue is resolved.

If you have a 0 in there that indicates that your computer is not trying to keep the connection alive (it is disabled), otherwise it tells you how often (in seconds) it is sending the aforementioned packet. Try putting in 120 or 240, if it is still killing your connection, you can go lower, maybe to 5, if with that number it doesn't happen, maybe it is your router who is dumping the connection to free memory.\nFor killing it when it gets hang up, you can use the ssh escape character:\n~.\n\nThat is, press the tilde and then the period, if it doesn't work, press Enter before you press that, that will kill the connection immediately.\n\nA: You can also try using the awesome mosh project. It will gracefully handle network losses, machines going to sleep, etc and happily restore the connection when you have a working network again.\nAnother more time-honored solution is to use tmux on the remote machine. In that case you may still get a broken pipe, but if you reconnect your shell and applications will be waiting just as you left them.\n\nA: Add these two lines to /etc/ssh/ssh_config:\nServerAliveInterval 60\nTCPKeepAlive yes\n\n", "Q: How to make sure album art shows up everywhere (Mac & iPhone) while using iTunes Match? What's the correct way to manage album art while using iTunes Match and have it show up everywhere? \nI've noticed that, typically:\n\n\n*\n\n*When iTunes Match correctly applies album art in iTunes, it only appears on the first track of the album.\n\n*Viewing the album after having downloaded it from the cloud to my iPhone, I can typically see the album art\n\n*Some songs on the album, when played on the iPhone, will display album art, but some will not.\n\n\nHow can I best apply art through iTunes to have it show up everywhere? Must I ensure it's applied to every song, and then Update iTunes Match?\n\nA: You don't need to download a song on your iOS devise via iTunes Match to get its artwork updated on that device. All you need to do is go into Settings -> Music -> turn off iTunes Match, and then turn it back on. All artwork will update over a few minutes. (I turned device off and back on again before turning Match back on just to be safe, but not sure it's necessary.) \nYou can go into your Music and see the little spinning wheel constantly working a half second at a time (for each album cover being updated from A to Z). with iTunes recent update to artwork, this is how I got the new artwork over to my iOS device.\n\nA: If you can see the album art in iTunes, it will eventually show up in your iOS device when match is turned on. As it is quite data intensive not all album art will show up immediately. The priority order of this is still not known exactly but possibly determined by how frequent the song is played.\nTo force the download of the covers on iOS, make sure you are on wifi and then go to the Music app and tap on Albums. As each album comes to view on your screen you'll notice the album art gets downloaded and becomes available (you can confirm this by the spinning wheel icon on the top left of the status bar.\nFor me, as good practice, I use an app like MPFreaker which actually embeds the album art into the file itself. What I found is iTunes keeps this separate and if you end up recovering music etc or move your music into another library, you will lose the cover art. \n\nA: Apply the albums artwork manually. Tools like mp3tag are very useful. I use it to manage my 500+ album collection. Just google the cover. Download it. And apply it across all the albums mp3s using the aforementioned tool. Upon adding the tracks to iTunes, it will sync and play with the proper artwork always.\n\nA: Actually, I have found the following method to work and have been doing this for years. You need to do it on your computer within I tunes. Find a picture or the art you want for the album and save it to your computer destop as a jpeg. \nThen, go and click on the album itself on your desktop within itunes. Then click on \"get info\". There will be a box that opens and an empty space for artwork. Paste that jpeg into that space. That seems to work. Often, with the syncing and matching the art will show up on my computer within itunes but i cannot see the art on my i phone, or i pad or on apple tv. After I do this manual step - it became visible. \n", "Q: Why does \"(null)\" want access to my Twitter accounts? Have anyone seen this message before, when accessing the official twitter app?\n\"(null)\" would like access to twitter accounts\n\nI have an iPod Touch with iOS 5, not jail-broken.\nIs it a virus?\n\nA: It is a bug in the Twitter app, not a virus. (null) is simply what the program gets when trying to insert a nonexistent name into would like access to Twitter accounts.\nI would report this as a bug to Twitter.\n\nA: Twitter has been integrated into iOS 5. To view the authorized apps connected to your account, go to Settings > Twitter. Any app that has the ability to \"tweet\" will request access to your Twitter credentials (Safari, Photos, for example).\nThe error message you are seeing is a bug in the Twitter client. It should read: \"Twitter would like access to twitter accounts.\" Allowing it access means not having to sign in using the client. Your credentials will be pulled right from iOS.\n\nThere are no viruses or exploits in the wild for any handheld Apple device. Furthermore, such exploits would require the installation of a unscrupulous app, something which Apple's App Store protects against.\nYou can read more about Apple's iOS Twitter integration here.\n", "Q: Apple Battery Charger Not Charging Sanyo Batteries I've had the Apple Battery Charger for a good long while now. After I bought it, I also bought a couple 8-packs of Sanyo Eneloop HR-3UTGA batteries, known to be the same model of battery included with Apple's charger. They worked great until a couple days ago. Now, with the Apple-branded batteries in the charger, it works fine. But when I put the Sanyos in the charger, nothing happens. No status light comes on. Nothing. Zilch.\nI've tried swapping out different sets of batteries, and it seems that my charger has suddenly taken an intense dislike for the Sanyos, completely without warning. But when I put the Apple batteries in, no problem.\nCan anyone suggest a course of action? Is it a bum charger now, or is something weird going on?\n\nA: Stating the obvious up front, the charger is only designed and tested to work with the Apple Batteries. It could be that the mAh of the Sanyo batteries is too different (out of range) for the Apple Battery Charger to properly recognize and charge to full capacity. The Apple batteries have a mAh of 1900. \nIf the Sanyo are 2400 or even 1600 the gap may just be too much so that the charger doesn't do its thing. As long as the charger is still able to charge the Apple batteries, the charger should not be bum.\n", "Q: Is there a way I can set the Tab key as (part of) an application keyboard shortcut in System Preferences > Keyboard shortcuts? Basically, I would like ⇥ and ⇧+⇥ to \"Shift Right\" and \"Shift Right\" (Menu items to indent or unindent selection) in TextMate.\nHowever, I can't set them using the System Preferences GUI, as pressing ⇥ tabs to the next UI button.\nIs there a way I can do that, maybe using a TextMate-specific custom KeyBindings.dict?\n\nA: You could cp /Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/Resources/KeyBindings.dict ~/Libary/Application\\ Support/TextMate/ and add:\n\"\\t\" = shiftRight:;\n\"$\\t\" = shiftLeft:;\n\nThat would prevent expanding snippets with tab though.\n\nA: Well you might run into a stone wall there because by default the system protects and limits the functions of tab so as to ensure proper system response... System Preferences > Keyboard allows one to turn tab to be used for all dialogs in a window, etc. \nThat being said, are you able to (in the same Keyboard preference window) add in a custom action. Under 10.7, you should have in the right window \"Application Shortcuts\" from there you can press \"+\" and select TextMate and then select the menu action you would like to perform. Then simply enter they key strokes.\n\nA: Custom application keyboard shortcuts are stored in the program's property list file in ~/Libary/Preferences, e.g. com.macromates.textmate.plist.\nYou can assign a keyboard shortcut (e.g. by adding Ctrl to both) using System Preferences and then edit the file to get the correct keyboard shortcut (by removing ^ from the shortcut, which is Ctrl).\n\n\nUnfortunately, it still doesn't work. Pressing the key combination does not trigger the menu item it's assigned to, for both Tab and Shift-Tab. The previously assign Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-Shift-Tab work without problems.\n\n\nSo, in this case, I'm afraid it's just not possible.\n", "Q: Serious system issue - kernel extensions installed improperly I have just gotten an error message for every single kext file there is.\nthe error message goes something along the lines of:\nThe system extension \"*file path*\" was installed improperly and cannot be used. Please try reinstalling it, or contact the products vendor for an update.\n\nIf there is something I could do to fix it, let me know.\n\nA: Try booting to \"Safe Mode\".  To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off your Mac.\n\n*Turn it back on and before you see the Apple logo on your screen, press and hold the Shift key until the Apple logo appears.\n\n*A progress bar should appear below the Apple logo - during this time your Mac is performing a directory check and loads only necessary Apple kernel extensions (among other small things).\n\n\nAfter about 3 minutes or so you should load to either your login window or the Desktop, depending on whether you have automatic login enabled.  \nIf you no longer see the error messages, it's safe to assume the corrupt kernel extensions are third-party kexts.  Otherwise, if you continue to have error messages even when booting to Safe Mode, I would re-install OS X.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: Sounds like you're going to need to reinstall. Have you done anything different to your system recently (installed new software, had any weird system issues, things like that)? The only thing you might try is running a permissions repair on your startup volume. This will repair permissions for the /Library directory, but it may not resolve the issue since the error states they're not installed correctly. It's worth a try however. You can do this from Disk Utility located in /Applications/Utilities\n", "Q: Unable to create a partition to install Mac OS X When I try to install Mac OS X there is no partition for me to choose.  I tried to create a partition and got the error, \"Partition failed with the error: Couldn't unmount disc.\"\nAnyone have a clue?  I can't install any OS unless I am able to create a partition.\n\nA: How are you doing this? What are you booted to? You can not partition a drive which you are running. \nTry inserting the install DVD which came with your computer and see if you can repartition or erase that way. If you still get the error message, select the drive you want to erase on the right side and then in the top toolbox select 'Eject'. If it ejects, rock on. Otherwise you might have an issue where the drive is damaged and can not be unmounted as the active OS is attempting to read the Volume Header and getting an error kicked backed.\n\nA: \"Andrew U\" has it right.  Sounds like the disk is active (mounted).\nReboot the Mac force the Mac to boot from the DVD and start a new install.\nIf the disk you are installing on already had data and partitions, either choose the Erase and Install method or do it manually by using Disk Utility from the Utilities menu in the Installer.\n", "Q: Why does my MacBook sometimes ring the startup chime four more times after the initial chime? Sometimes, not always, upon restarting my Macbook (late-2006), the chime is repeated four more times after the initial chime.  It then starts up normally.\n\nA: Does it happen in quick succession to where you could say the the unit chimes 5 times at start up? Or does the system reboot between each chime?\nIf they happen in quick success I would suspect a RAM Module issue. If it is so that the system reboots each time I would lean more towards an issue with the MLB's boot ROM. Late 2006 MBP parts are getting scarce since a Apple computer can only be serviced for 5 years from DOP. Hopefully that will give you a bit of information.\nAnother (distant) possibility is that the OS is corrupted after trying to do a software update. That one is a bit tricker to find but best tip is to run a complete backup of the unit, re-install the OS from the DVDs that shipped with the unit and the reapply all available updates (making sure the unit is attached to power the entire time).\n\nA: You can take a look at the Power On Self-Test codes from Apple ( http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1547 ), copied here for convenience:\n1 beep = no RAM installed\n2 beeps = incompatible RAM types\n3 beeps = no good banks\n4 beeps = no good boot images in the boot ROM (and/or bad sys config block)\n5 beeps = processor is not usable\n\nIf you have 5 beeps, it might be a processor problem. Note that the chimes will be uniform, all of them the same, if there is a problem the \"normal\" chime is not played, just N beeps as stated above.\n", "Q: Calendar sharing with iCloud and MobileMe There are 3 different people, each needing to publish their own calendar, and view/edit the other calendars. Each has an iMac or macbook, and iPhone. Person 1 has MobileMe and is unable to upgrade to iCloud (iPhone 3g). Person 2 has already upgraded to iCloud. Person 3 can upgrade but is waiting for the solution to this calendar dilemma. \nAll 3 were happily sharing via MobileMe until Person 2 upgraded to iCloud, at which point their calendars were no longer visible to Person 1 & 3. There seems to be no way to share between iCloud and MobileMe - does anyone know of a solution??\n\nA: This is a dilemma that I too have been struggling with and am sorry to say that at this time, I don't believe a real solution exists.  The new sharing interface in iCloud seems to have removed any and all methods of sharing an editable calendar with a non iCloud user.  The only sharing option for non iCloud users that seems to have remained intact is the ability to create a public calendar, viewable from a web browser.  There is however a partial work around that will solve a portion of your problem, but not all of it.  \nYou can get around the new iCloud sharing interface and restrictions by moving the calendars in question from the cloud to each individuals respective Mac locally.  The simplest way I've found to do this is to export said calendar to your desktop and then open the resulting \".ics\" file into iCal.  When prompted for a destination calendar, select \"New Calendar\" from the bottom of the list.  This will create a new calendar stored locally on the Mac with the same name and events of the first calendar. (Be aware, that this will result in duplicate events unless you choose to then delete the iCloud counterpart.)  Once you've done this, the new local calendar will give you a \"Publish\" option inside of it's contextual menu (Right or Ctl Click) which leads you to an option to publish to Mobile Me, giving you a web cal link that any standard calendar service can subscribe to.  \nThere are too major downsides to this, the first being that it only provides viewing options, no editing ability.  The second problem is that it is now dependent on syncing your iPhone to your computer in order to keep everything up to date.  Local Calendars are not privy to either iCloud or mobile me cloud syncing.  \nI know that this is definitely not the solution you're looking for, but hopefully it will provided some sort of stop gap until either Apple or some of our more industrious developer friends out there come up with something both more elegant and fully functional.  As always, I highly recommence backing up iCal before moving and or removing any calendars.   \nI look forward to seeing what the rest of the community comes up with as well, hopefully there is something simple that I have missed.\n\nA: Have you tried adding the iCloud shared calendar on the iPhone 3G? You should be able to add it via Settings>Mail, Contacts, Calendar>Add Account...>Other>Add CalDav Account. I was able to do this between a Mac with iCloud and an iPhone 3G\n", "Q: Is there a system freeze problem in Snow Leopard when there's no free memory? For many months, I chased after the cause of my computer, a late-2006 MacBook with Snow Leopard and all available updates installed, locking up, forcing me to restart.  It locked with a spinning cursor and didn't respond to ctrl-option-esc, or to anything other than a power switch forced restart.  \nI have lately discovered that the freezes were caused by running out of memory.  Using FreeMem Pro, I'm able to monitor memory usage, and to prevent the locks by freeing up memory when it grows short.\nThe problem seems to be related to gradual growth in the size of wired memory, which starts out at about 1/2 GB and grows to 1.5 GB or more.  (This model is limited to 2GB of physical RAM.)\nIn turn, the growth of wired memory use appears to be related to Safari.  Quitting Safari releases a big chunk of memory to free memory.  Relaunching Safari then begins chewing up wired memory once more.  I've scoured the Apple User Forums and other such resources where I found similar reports to mine but no worthy answers to WHY it occurs.\n\nA: The answer is simple: Safari just needs (or wastes) a lot of memory! If you only have 2GB RAM, use Googles Chrome Browser or Firefox. \n2GB of RAM is just not enough for todays Computer. Be sure to only open one app at the time, and close it when you are finish. \n\nAn Operating System handles the RAM by itself. When it's out of RAM,\n  it stores the user-cache-data on the Hard Drive, so the Computer gets\n  very slow.\n\nAnd for browsing: Websites with lots of flash content needs more memory, than simple text sites. I've had a MacBook Air with only 2GB of RAM, and it was just impossible to work with! \n\nA: Well there are a couple things with that. It is possible that the website you use like to refer to a cache of cookies and preloaded info on your system. Have you tried resetting Safari (Safari menu > Reset Safari)? There is also a great system clean-up app called Onyx which I run once in a blue moon when my system feels a bit sluggish. \nDoes the issue also occur while using other browser. All browsers will eat up memory but the question then comes does it happen with the same sites in the same amount of time? Possibility is that maybe Java or flash (in the background of Safari) are having some issues. Try reseting your browser, clearing the caches from ~/Library/ and if possible... try a known good OS from an external drive (that was fresh installed with all updates) and see if it occurs there. \nAnother quick tip would be to use the supplied Apple AHT on your install DVDs and see if they find any issues.\n", "Q: Why is my iTunes library in iCloud grayed out? I got a new MacBook Air. I registered with iCloud purchased iTunes Match and now my whole iTunes library (originally on my iMac) shows up in iTunes on the MacBook Air, but it's all grayed out and nothing will play. What haven't I done?\n\nA: This is likely because iTunes Match is enabled on your MacBook Air under the same Apple ID your purchased it on and configured it for on your iMac. When you configure iTunes Match on a second machine, it puts the entire iCloud library in iTunes grayed out with the option to download. There should be a small download button in line with your songs that will allow you to download the matched songs:\n\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Need to perform multiple clicks in MacBook Pro 2011 running OS X Lion I have noticed that I need to perform clicks multiple times if I want to close some window e.g. Firefox or even to close a tab. It happens frequently but not all the time. When I use the Eclipse IDE, if I select attributes options from property explorer, a few button/drop-downs are click-able, whereas for others I click on the buttons but there's no response.\nIs this a bug in OS X Lion?\nExample of clicking on Eclipse IDE fails to respond, even I have pressed the dropdown button.\n\n\nA: This is not a known but to my knowledge. Have you tried running a test OS from an external volume that has a fresh install of Lion (with all updates) to see if the issue still remains? Is your system able to run 10.6.8? If so try a known good volume with Snow Leopard and test again.\nIt might be of use to try those OSs out to help narrow it down. Best of luck.\n\nA: I reinstalled Mac OS Lion and the issue is resolved. But I have no clue why it happned, it was not eclipse issue it was problem of Mac OS Lion, what I think it might has happened because of running OnyX software.\n", "Q: What are some good open source text editors on Mac OS X? I just recently switched from Windows and I must say that as much as I'm satisfied with the whole OS, I'm disappointed by the text editors so far (I've tried TextMate and BBEdit). So I figured I would check specifically into open source editors.\nI'm currently checking out MacVim, but are there any other good, maintained text editors for OS X?\n\nA: There is Aquamacs that is a version of Emacs that has been customised to be more OSX like.\nApple supplies the source for TextEdit as an example with Xcode.\n\nA: emacs for osx is by far my favorite. \nBut it depends a lot on what you edit. Netbeans and eclipse are both IDEs but have nice support for many kinds of files. Maybe also LibreOffice is worth checking out. \n\nA: TextWrangler\nTextWrangler is the “little brother” to BBEdit, leading professional HTML and text editor for the Macintosh.   \n\n\nA: One of my favorite is a free one (where you can also donate for a fuller version) and it is also a beautifully designed/ distraction free editor: OmmWriter. \nHowever the best thing possible if you are looking for something with the most functionality and the best compatibility cross-platform would be NeoOffice. \n\nA: Gedit\nIt's not as functional as the version for Linux, but it is open source.\nAlso, it tends to crash a lot in lion...\n\n\nA: Smultron 3.5.1\nThis is the latest version of smultron which is open source. This version does not work on Lion!\nThe newer version of smultron is sold via the App Store and proprietary. Smultron 4 does work in lion.\n", "Q: Problems with font rendering on a MacBook Pro using external 24\" LCD I have a 24\" HP LP2475w at my home and 23\" Apple Cinema Display at work. Today when I turned on my laptop at work, I noticed that all fonts look perfect (after having an issue with rendering for the past two days). I thought the issue somehow got fixed and happily went on with my day.\nLater when I came home, everything still worked, because I didn't turn off my MacBook. This is how it looks (correct), even on my home LCD\n\nbut when I quit the Terminal.app (or any other app for that matter) and launch it again, while the 24\" is still connected, the fonts get ugly\n\nNotice even the background color is different, which doesn't make any sense at all, since the screenshots are taken about 15 seconds apart.\nWhen I disconnect my LCD the Terminal still looks ugly, until I relaunch it, then it looks ok again.\nThe important thing here is, that I've been using the 24\" LCD for the past year and never had this issue, it just started happening without me changing anything.\nIs it possible, that my MacBook is somehow having trouble communicating with the LCD when the app starts? I would understand if this happened to everything that is displayed on the 24\" LCD, but it happens only to apps that are launched when the LCD is connected.\nEven if I quit all the windows in the terminal and open new ones it still looks ok, until I actually quit the application itself and relaunch it.\n\nA: The first image is using sub-pixel anti-aliasing, which is takes advantage of the way the RGB sub components of an LCD monitor happen to line up.  You can see this by using \"DigitalColor Meter\", or any other utility, to zoom in on the pixels.\nThe second image is using full-pixel anti-aliasing, which is 3x blockier, but works on non-LCD displays and LCD displays which use a different sub-pixel ordering.\nAt least in Mac OS X 10.6, this is controlled by the Appearance control panel and the \"Use LCD font smoothing when available\".  The key is \"when available\".  The OS must correctly detect when your display is an LCD.\nA peculiar quirk that I've noticed is that if you change that setting, it does not immediately change the fonts already on the screen.  You have to at least close and reopen a window, sometimes quit and restart an application, for the new setting to apply.\nMy guess is that you have \"LCD font smoothing\" turned on, but you are moving back and forth between a display which OS X recognizes as an LCD and one which it does not.\n\nA: You should try adjusting font smoothing globally. Open up terminal and type:\ndefaults -currentHost read -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing\n\nDepending if it's enabled or not you might get a message such as: \nThe domain/default pair of (kCFPreferencesAnyApplication,\n AppleFontSmoothing) does not exist\n\n(which is actually good, since it tells us it's not set, and why you have the issue).\nNext, type:\ndefaults -currentHost write -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing -int 2\n\nIf it doesn't look any different, worse, etc. or want to adjust it even more replace the number '2' with '1'.\nTo remove the global setting you can use:\ndefaults -currentHost delete -globalDomain AppleFontSmoothing\n\n\n*Hopefully this solves your troubles.\n\nA: This is OSX \"Text Smoothing\" I believe.\nIn \"General\" preferences, the last option is to turn off text Smoothing for font sizes below a certain size.  I guess that value has changed to one higher than your current font size.\n\nA: My brand new Samsung C49RG90 (5K) connected in Picture-by-Picture mode with the two display-port outputs of my MacBook Pro exhibited awful fonts. I found out that by simply reducing the default sharpness setting of the monitor from 60 to 50 fixed everything - no need to tweak AppleFontSmoothing or CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled.\nIf your monitor has a sharpness setting, try to tweak that.\n\nA: Have you per chance enabled any specialized settings via the Developer Tools? Such that your computer would now be showing HiDPA resolutions? You can verify quickly by going into System Preferences > Displays and you can see what kind of resolution setting your computer is using.\n\nA: In our case with LG HDR WQHD display we needed to uncheck High Dynamic Range in display settings.\n", "Q: Would an iPhone delete text messages by itself? Would an iPhone 3G delete text messages by itself? I have lost some text messages and don't know where to find them! Thanks.\n\nA: Are you able to see the SMS in spotlight? Worst case would be that the phone was unlocked while in your pocket and somehow (through the miracle of entropy) messages got deleted.\nOtherwise the phone might be running out of space as to my knowledge there is a limit to 250,000 messages that can be stored on the phone (regardless of which GB model you have), what would supersede that message limit is if you have very little space left on your phone. By default the iPhone OS will make sure that it has space for temporary data and caches over SMS messages.\n", "Q: Can't authorize computer to play iTunes songs I purchased music on my old computer with different email addresses ans passwords. The computer died and I need the old passwords to play some of my music. Is there an email address for iTunes support where I can request my old passwords? I have tried calling the support number but they could not resolve the issue.\nMany thanks for any assistance.\n\nA: If you still remember and have access to the email addresses you used, you can go to this page to reset your passwords: Forgot my Password\n\nA: Within iTunes, choose the Help > Apple Service and Support menu item. This takes you to the Apple ExpressLane support interface in your web browser. Select your product (iTunes), feature area (iTunes Store), and support category (Account Management). Answer the on-screen questions and you should be able to submit a message for iTunes Store support.\nIf you don't have access to the original email accounts, it will be very difficult to retrieve or reset the passwords. Typically, a password reset link is emailed, and if you can't retrieve the email, you wouldn't be able to retrieve or reset the password.\n", "Q: Can I share a .ipa file (iOS app) among multiple users? Is it possible to share a .ipa file between iOS device users who have purchased the app? The reason is we do not want to download the app (especially if it has a large file size, like 1GB).    \nFor example, User 1 has purchased 'Scrabble' and User 2 has also purchased 'Scrabble'. User 1 has a good internet connection and finished downloading. User 2 has a bad internet connection. In this case, User 2 would benefit by copying the .ipa file to his computer (if Apple allows). Since both users have purchased the application, it is not piracy or illegal.\nI just don't have two accounts to try and I don't know where to look for the answer. Answers or a link to read would be appreciated.\n\nA: That's a really interesting question.\nBut first I give you another situation:\nIf user 2 wants to use an app already bought and downloaded by user 1, the only thing user 2 needs to do is add the .ipa file of that app in his iTunes and authorize his computer with the apple id of user 1. (in iTunes click on 'Store' > 'Authorize this computer')\nIf two people want to use the same app they don't need to both download the app. They don't even have to both purchase the app. They can share the .ipa file if they authorize each other's computers.\nIn the situation you present - where user 2 also bought the app but didn't download it - I think he would still need to authorize his computer with the apple id of user 1 in iTunes. That's because I think the identity (apple id) of the buyer/downloader of the app is stored in the .ipa file, but I'm not 100% certain about that.\n", "Q: Time Machine Error -36 I have a NAS device attached to my router. I'm using it as a backup device for my Mac Book Pro. I'm getting the following error: \n\nThe backup disk image /Volumes/SHARE-1/MacBookPro.sparsebundle could not be created (error -36).\n\nI'm not sure what the problem is. The NAS device is a Buffalo external device with a SMB (FAT) format. Could this be the problem?\n\nA: Yes, the FAT is the problem. Time Machine needs an HFS+ formatted drive.\nThat's quite logical, since files copied from your HFS+ system have many attributes that could not be handled by the FAT filesystem, not even counting the files too long, or the characters that could not be accepted as a valid filename on FAT drives :)\n", "Q: Change Mac username How can I change the username that pops up every time admin access is requested ?  \nI've tried updating the account name in System Preferences -> Accounts\n\nA: To change the Full Name of a user, you make the change at the Users and Groups panel of System Preferences. To change the username is technically a much more difficult thing to do, and cannot be done from the GUI.\n\n\nA: Try clicking the lock button to authenticate before you make the changes (you probably have to do this anyway), make the changes and then click the lock again. Then click Show All to properly exit from the Accounts preference pane. \nIf this does not resolve the issue, you may want to do a permissions repair from Disk Utility on your startup volume. If that does not resolve the issue, try restarting your computer from the recovery partition (if running Lion) or the gray disk (if not running Lion). Open Disk Utility and run a permissions repair on your startup volume. After this is complete, close Disk Utility and open Terminal from the Utilities menu. Type in resetpassword and select your user account (NOT System Administrator/root) from the drop down menu. Click the Reset button at the bottom of the window in the Reset home folder permissions and ACLs section. Quit the Password Utility and go back to the main recovery screen. On your keyboard, hit Command+Q and restart your computer.\nIt's very important that you don't hold down the power button to exit the recovery session, or the ACL reset won't occur.\n", "Q: Can't upgrade to Lion with error \"can't be installed because a recovery system can't be created\" I've formatted my newly bought SSD and did a clean install of Snow Leopard from the install CD I got with my MacBook.\nSnow Leopard installed just fine and everything works, but when I try to upgrade to Lion from the App Store, I get an error saying\nMac OS X can't be installed on the disk Macintosh HD, because a recovery system can't be created. Visit www.apple.com/support/no-recovery to learn more.\nIs there any way around this? What can I do other than just cloning my old HDD to the SSD?\n\nA: when installing Snow Leopard did you delete and create partitions on the disk using the Disk Utilities as part of the installer, or did you install direct onto the pre formatted SSD?\nIf the answer to the second question is yes, then a new install of Snow Leopard on the SSD, but this time delete all existing partition data and allow SL to create the partitioning and install onto the SSD from there will allow you to update to Lion without that error.\n\nA: Make sure you've formatted your SSD as a Mac OS Extended (Journaled) partition and that your partition map is GUID Partition Table.\nTry just having the one Macintosh HD partition on your SSD, the Lion Recovery HD can be pretty hateful of drives with multiple partitions and a Master Boot Record partition map.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: Do you have an external HD Case? If so plug in your old computer's HD, you should be able to boot from it, if not there is an emergency boot partition that is hidden. Hold down the option key and attempt to boot from there.  From there you should be able to format the SSD from the Emergency boot disk.\nIf you don't want to go that route, then I'd suggest to format the SSD as explained before as an Mac OS Extended Partition. From there you should be able to install Lion fresh.\nIf not, I'll help where I can.\n\nA: If you have used Time Machine on Lion you can use that backup to install Lion as well. Connect the drive and it will be a bootable drive which will install the recovery partition on the SSD.

This can only be shrunk when it is unmounted - that happens only when you log out. \nSo if you like me keep logged in all the time it will grow till all space is used up. (and logging off takes an eternity)\nbtw. just 2 GB free is kinda little free space anyway.\n", "Q: How do I enroll devices while \"Can enable remote management\" is disabled? I'm deploying a large number of iPads and Mac Minis in my environment, and I need to be able to enroll them so they can be managed by my server.\nIn my server \"Profile Manager\" there is a setting to \"Can Enable Remote Management\". \n\nBy enabling this, I can Enroll a device through the http://myserver/mydevices/ page\n\nIf I disable the \"Can Enable Remote Management\" feature, the \"Enroll this mac\" button disappears.\nThis is to be expected since once I have the remote management enabled, I don't want any other users monkeying with it, removing the trust certificate, or otherwise vandalizing my hard work.\nWhat is the right way to mass deploy these devices to my network, ensuring they can't be changed by the users, and disabling the ability for the end user to enable/disable remote management.\n\nA: Four years after you posted this, Apple's answer to this is Device Enrollment Program to point all the macOS and iOS hardware you buy to your MDM enrollment URL without user interaction. \nThat way the devices can be enrolled, supervised, managed without needing to train end users. \n\nA: I'm too deploying Lion in masse, I was wondering the same as you and I found on Profile Manger's help (About the user portal->Providing configuration profiles for download->Enrolling devices): \n\nIf you use Profile Manager as a mobile device management server, the user portal allows users to quickly enroll their devices.\nIn Profile Manager, select a user or group, then click 'Can enable device management.'\n  Provide your users with the user portal URL.\nTo see the URL, click View User Portal in the Profile Manager pane of the Server app. It is similar to example.com/mydevices. When users log in, they click the Enroll button to download a configuration profile that initiates the enrollment process\".\n\nAs to prevent users to vandalize your settings, you can add another payload to your profiles to keep users from opening Profiles pane on System Preferences, Everyone group seems good to do this.\n", "Q: Is there a way to look at photos by date taken in iPhoto? In Windows Live Photo Gallery, there's an easy way to view photos by date taken:\n\nHow do I accomplish the same thing in iPhoto '11?  \n\nA: Using the search functionality is usually the best way to find unknown options.\nFirst select Photos from the sidebar. Then sort by date.\n\n\nA: What I've done is created smart albums and organized them by year, then by month. You can create smart albums by going to File>New Smart Album. Then, select a date range. IMO, this is the best way to do it. I've organized it exactly like your picture.  \n\n\nA: Yes! If you're in Events, you can go to the View menu, hover on Sort Events and check the By Date option. This will do the same thing for Photos if you're selected on Photos. This will sort the Events or Photos you're looking at by date taken. As you're scrolling though them, a HUD will show the month they were taken.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: If you create a whole year's worth of smart albums like @daviesgeek has, and you have Keyboard Maestro installed, you can use a macro I created to change a set of twelve Smart Albums to represent a different year.

When I connect my Apple TV 2nd Generation to my iTunes home sharing account I see all Movies, Music etc. I can choose which photos to show, however.\nI would like to be able to choose which Movies and Music to show on the Apple TV (and on other connected computers) and which not.\nAll Movies and Music were bought with the same Apple ID (which is also used for sharing).\n\nA: \nIt's not Home Sharing, but this allows you to share over Bonjour, and you can drag just the movies you want into their own playlist.\n\nA: AFAIK, everything in iTunes is shared via Home Sharing.  Photos are the only part of Home Sharing that offer any choices.\nRemove undesired movies, etc, from iTunes if you don't want other devices to have access too.\n", "Q: Make iTunes song options stick on other devices? When I set certain options for a song, such as a Volume Adjustment or Start Time or Stop time, it would be nice if those options were kept when the song is played on another device, such as an iPad or iPhone.\nFor example, if I cut off the first several seconds of a song (say, to get rid of a spoken introduction), iTunes will do that and start the song proper, but the same tune played on the iPad will start at the beginning (including the spoke intro).  \nIs there some way to get iTunes to modify the actual file rather than some internal database (or whatever)?\n\nA: While I'm not sure why the options aren't being kept between your device, there is no way to make iTunes edit the file itself. Nearly everything Apple makes revolves around the idea of revisions. iTunes, while not using revisions, only edits it's database to mark the in and out points of tracks.\nTo correct syncing, I can only suggest removing the song from iOS and adding it back (it doesn't rewrite data for tracks already on the device).\nThe get around this, you can always edit the file yourself in something like Audacity, if you wanted to go the permanent route.\n", "Q: Apple insisting my ID info is not correct, but it is, what to do?

When I chat with two of my friends (say A. and T.), our iPhones use text instead of iMessage. It used to work using iMessage, but one day, it switched to text. A, T and myself otherwise use iMessage with other contacts without any problem. It's only A <-> me and T <-> me which uses text.\nHow do I reset iMessage in order to re-enable it with these two friends?\n\nA: You can delete the SMS messages from the conversation and just leave the iMessages. Then reset your phone using the sleep/wake + home buttons.  This has restored the default to Send via imessage again for the conversation. \n\nA: Try disabling iMessage in Settings → Messages → iMessage. Turn it off and then turn it back on. After doing this, close all apps and restart your phone by holding down the Lock button and the Home button for ten seconds. If this does not resolve the issue, it may related to the other users' devices. \nYou can also try restoring your iPhone though iTunes and setting up as a new device if you don't believe it's related to the other users. \n\nA: If you're using Sprint and Google Voice, see this support article from Apple: http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4091\nSummary: \n\nIntegrating your Sprint account with Google Voice may prevent your mobile phone number from being registered for use with FaceTime video calls and iMessage text messages.\nThis occurs only when your Sprint phone number and Google Voice number are not the same. It should not affect your ability to send or receive SMS or MMS messages, or to receive or place FaceTime calls or iMessages using an email address instead of your phone number.\n\nThe support article doesn't give a solution, but I infer that you would need to change something with respect to Google Voice. I don't have a Sprint account and I don't know what it means to integrate a Sprint account with Google Voice.\n\nA: I just had the same issue (also with a person named \"A\") and was able to resolve it by sending an iMessage to A.'s email address, which she had registered to receive iMessages. She received it fine. That seemed to wake her iPhone up to the fact that I was sending from an iMessage-capable number, as she was then able to send me an iMessage to my mobile number, where just minutes before it didn't work.\nWe then repeated the procedure in reverse (she iMessage'd my email address). Now we are both able to send each other iMessages to each other's mobile number.\n\nA: Go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Settings. This reset my iPhone back to iMessages when it got stuck in a rut sending text messages to another iPhone user.\n\nA: On iOS 16:\n\n*\n\n*send the message normally (blue bubble)\n\n*tap and hold on the blue bubble\n\n*this menu shows up, select send as text\n\n\n*the bubble turns green\n\nYou will only see this option if your conversation is with a phone number.

Can I convert a RAID 0 set to a RAID 5 set in a Mac Pro? I currently have two 500GB drives in a RAID 0 set. I want to add a third drive and convert it to  a RAID 5 set. Is it possible to do this without wiping the current array and rebuilding from scratch? If I have to rebuild from scratch, can I take an image of the current state using Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC), kill the RAID 0 set, make the RAID 5 set, and restore from the CCC image?\n\nA: Disk Utility will only support RAID 1 and 0 using software raid.\nIf you have the RAID Card for the Mac Pro, you can configure RAID 5.  I've never actually used or configured one of these in the wild so I can't give you exact specifics on using it.\n", "Q: Is there a Mac text editor that has live display of unique word count? That is, it shows, while you type, the count of unique words. Not a count of all words.\nIf the document had the words:\n\nThe cat is in the hat which is in Toledo.\n\nIt would show a count of 7.\nI know I could write a short shell script to do this but I'm looking for real-time display. If you know of an editor that allows writing such a real-time plugin that would be helpful as well.\n\nA: Emacs can do it (as most things). Have a look at this page.

Well, a unique word count is readily available and the app has a bonus; the capability of finding semantic connections among your documents using a pretty terrific artificial intelligence. DEVONnote may also have this capability, but it's been years since I've used it.\n\nSorry I didn't link to all of my suggestions, but I don't have the clout here at StackExchange to post all of them. I left links to what I believe are the two best answers to help you.\n\nA: With BBEdit (not free) this can be accomplished with these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Break up all words into individual lines by using several search and replace to turn any non-word character into a line break. To do that, use the Find command, turn on \"Grep\" checkbox, enter [^a-z]+ (this finds everything that's not a letter) into the Find box and \\r (that's a line break) into the Replace box, then click \"Replace All\".\n\n*Remove all empty lines by using the \"Process Lines Containing...\" command from the \"Text\" menu: Enter ^$ into the text field and check only the \"Use grep\" and the \"Delete matched lines\" options.

Is there a default I need to change?\n\nA: Might have to do with how artwork is stored. iTunes can store it in the mp3/aac/whatever music file or in a separate database. \nI noticed when exporting often the art is not included. A way to force iTunes to include the artwork in the file is to edit the file info in iTunes - like e.g. add a comment. Then the tag is rewritten with artwork also included.\n\nA: After reading previous responses, most of my answers were taken. I do, however, have one more thing to add. Have you ever considered the fact that the iPod classic hardware just  may not have been made to show artwork while plugged into the jack?\n", "Q: Is it possible to customize multi-touch gestures on an iPad? The iPad has multi-touch gestures:\n\nIs it possible to customize these gestures? If so, how?\n\nA: Not out of the box - the closest you could get some gestures is to jailbreak and install Activator which allows you to e.g. customize pinch and spread actions, slide from left/right/bottom/top of screen and then assign and action e.g. launch an app, lock the screen etc.\n\nA: If you're talking about customizing the way you invoke these gestures, I think your only option (without jail-breaking) is to make it so that instead of having to perform these gestures, you tap a few buttons. Apple calls this feature AssistiveTouch.\nFor example, if you want to exit an app by using AssistiveTouch rather than performing the normal gesture, do both of the following:\nTo create a new gesture (do this one time for each gesture):\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Settings\n\n*Go to General\n\n*Temporarily disable the multi-tasking gestures (this will make it easier to record the gesture)\n\n*Navigate to Accessibility > Assistive Touch\n\n*Enable it on the top\n\n*Create a new gesture\n\n*Perform the close app gesture (start with four fingers spread out, and then slide all four fingers towards the center).\n\n*Press Save on the top right, and name it something like Close App.\n\n*Re-enable multi-tasking gestures (Settings > General)\n\n\nTo use the gesture:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you are in an app and not looking at the home screen.\n\n*Tap the new transparent button which appears on the bottom right.\n\n*Tap Favorites > Close App.\n\n*Tap in the center of the screen\n\n*You should now see your home screen instead of the original app you were in.\n\n\nIt's not that practical, since you end up having to tap 4 buttons instead of performing a single four-finger gesture, but it's an option in case anyone needs it.\nTip: if you don't want the AssistiveTouch button always visible, in the Accessibility page, you can set it to appear and disappear by triple-tapping the home button.\n\nA: Zephyr (video demo) allows you to customize multi-touch gestures on both on any jailbroken iOS device. It allows you to have much more control over gestures than Activator.\n", "Q: What is your preferred way to start a (shell) script from the GUI? I was wondering what ways there are to start a (shell) script from the GUI, e.g. double-clicking an icon in Finder or launching via Spotlight.  \nThis is not about opening a terminal and \"manually\" launching the script.\nI used to have .term files on the desktop, which launch a terminal session and can also be extended to execute a script upon launch. This is nice if you need interaction or want to monitor the output.\nI also know about running a shell script from Applescript, and just read about the .command files.\nWhat is your preferred way to start a (shell) script from the GUI, and why ?\nAnd maybe you could also write if it shows output and allows interaction or is just an invisible wrapper to e.g. start a program with its own GUI.\n\nA: You can use an app like Platypus.\n\nPlatypus is a developer tool for creating application wrappers around scripts. In other words, it creates Mac OS X applications that execute a script which is bundled within the application. Command line scripts can thus be run transparently from the graphical window environment, integrating seamlessly with the user interface.\n\n\nA: I've used Quicksilver to accomplish this task. You can initiate scripts either through assigning triggers or by manually typing in the process, script, etc., name and telling QS to run in a terminal window. \n\nA: MacOS has a \"Scripts\" menulet, which can be activated from the Preferences of the Script Editor.app.\n\n(There may be other ways to activate it.)\nOnce installed, it provides the user with the contents of /Library/Scripts. (And probably ~/Library/Scripts, though that folder does not exist by default.)\nAny AppleScript, shell script, python script or other executable can then be selected directly from the menu.\nIt also provides access to Application Scripts, which are found in ~/Library/Application Scripts.\n\n", "Q: How can I throttle bandwidth for iTunes only? I saw a few questions asked and suggest Waterproof and a few other apps, but it seems to throttle everything outgoing on my Mac. I want to only throttle the download speed on iTunes. I normally use jDownloader to download things, and I am able to put a speed cap on my downloads, is there a way to do that for iTunes?\n\nA: Try Throttled which should let you set a global or application specific speed limit\n", "Q: Trouble syncing multiple Apple products between multiple computers In our house we have two iPhones and an iPad. Each one has a separate iTunes account so we could have different versions of the games instead of sharing. We've upgraded our computer from a PC to a Mac and when trying to sync any of the iPhones or iPad, we get an error message that says that the particular item is synced to a different account. How do I sync the iPhones and iPad to the new computer without erasing all the information on the item?\n\nA: If you really want to sync between multiple computers, it is technically possible. You have to place your iTunes library folder in a location that can be accessed by all of the systems on the network. Then, when you want to access that shared library, hold down the Option key (Shift key on Windows) while iTunes is opening. This will bring up a dialog box with an option to select another library. Click it, and browse to the shared network folder with the iTunes library in it. iTunes will open with this library, and you should be able to sync your device on that computer.\nThe downside? Unless you have a server or network attached storage device, the computer that is actually hosting the iTunes library folder has to be running more or less all the time. Also, iTunes may not maintain all of its purchase authorizations between computers. If these things don't bother you, then this is definitely an option.\n\nA: The message you are getting is not an error message. It is there to make sure people cant sync a device with more than one computer.\nThis happens for a number of reasons, One is so that your backups are on one machine and data is centralised, another is so that you cannot copy music from other people. \nBefore syncing, go into iTunes and authorize all the Apple ID's you have used to make purchases.\nOnce this is done, you can begin to sync. Plug the iDevice in and you will see the same message. Click yes.\nYour device will then start to transfer all purchases on the device to the Mac.\nAfter that it will create a backup and then start to sync media depending on what you have selected to sync\n\nA: Are you syncing the data to one user on the Mac? The biggest aid would be making sure that all devices are synced to an individual user on the computer. Since your goal is to keep everything separated anyways, that is the absolute best/simplest solution I can think of. If that is what you are doing then please let me know and maybe include some screen captures of the error messages.\n", "Q: PDF metadata editor for iOS I have several PDF ebooks in my iBooks.\n\nSome of them have their titles & authors visible.

Adding that as a feature to their new iOS PDF editor might be something they can do quickly and really make it quicker to make these sorts of changes.\n", "Q: How to move iTunes database from Windows 7 to Lion where the music is on a network drive? I asked this question months ago and I finally had a chance to try the answer.  I followed the instructions in the answer but it didn't work. After I copied over the iTunes folder from Windows to Mac as per the instructions, when iTunes starts on the Mac, I see all of my music listed.  But iTunes can't locate any of the songs and throws this error: 'The song “Hard Days Night” could not be used because the original file could not be found. Would you like to locate it?' Doing a get info shows that iTunes thinks that the file is located here: file://localhost/192.168.1.6/music/HardDaysNight.mp3   \nSo clearly the path is incorrect.  The correct SMB path is smb://192.168.1.6/music/HardDaysNight.mp3.  How do I fix this?\nI cleared out the iTunes folder and simply added the file directly to iTunes.  iTunes copied the file from the network directory to the local hard drive which is not what I want.  I want to keep my files on the network folder.  How do I replicate what I had on Windows on the Mac where iTunes references music stores on a network drive?\n\nA: Here's what finally worked.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the file \"iTunes Music Library.xml\" from Windows to somewhere on your Mac, like your desktop.\n\n*Change all references to network location of the audio files to something the Mac can understand.  For example, all of my MP3 files started with file://localhost//192.168.1.6/music/  So I did a Find & Replace and changed them to the path the Mac mounted my remote music folder: file://localhost/Volumes/Media/music/\n\n*Clear out the iTunes directory in ~/Music.\n\n*In iTunes > Preferences > Advanced, uncheck \"Copy files to iTunes Meida folder when adding to library\".\n\n*Then import the XML file from step 1 into iTunes by File > Library > Import Playlist.\n\n\nThe \"Re-creating the iTunes Library file\" section near the bottom of this article helped.\n\nA: The problem as I understand it is that windows and Mac refer to file locations differently.  So with that in mind, if you intend on moving the music to your Mac, then your best bet is to just create a new library file on the mac, adjust the location of music in the presences to your network drive, then re-add all the music to iTunes.  This 'should' fix everything.\nAny time I tried to share my library between operating systems, I spent more time trying to fix it than it was worth.  Now I just keep a copy on both machines and use home sharing and iCloud to keep them in sync.\nGood luck, hope this helps.\n", "Q: Uses for an iPhone 2G that can't connect/sync to iTunes, but charges & works just fine I have an iPhone 2G (1st generation model) that works fine except that it does not connect to iTunes. I have tried to fix it but it seems permanently screwed (I'm not looking for  a solution to this).\nMy question is, what can I use this old (jailbroken) iPhone for, given its limitation of not being able to connect/sync with iTunes. Very few apps work on it as it runs iOS 3.1.3.\nCan I store and run music and movies on it? Any other creative uses for it? \nPS: I have an iPad and an Android phone as well. This phone is a spare.\n\nA: If it's jailbroken, and you are looking to get movies and music to it, then can you scp them onto the device? \nSo first I would check I could ssh onto the device when it was on the same wireless network as my laptop.  Then (assuming scp works anywhere that ssh does, not sure there) I'd scp files I wanted to watch over (possibly converting them with Handbrake first) and then use iFile (from cydia) to navigate to the file and watch.  \nIf iFile is not available because of the operating system, you might have to work a little harder to put the files into the correct place for the iphone native apps to find them. \n\nA: For 10 bucks, install Wi-Fi Sync from Cydia and you might be able to sync it that way.  This happened to my iPhone 2g and I'm still happily using it. \n\nA: You could use it to just have fun tweaking it. You could use it as an expensive USB drive, there is a cydia tweak for that. You could sell it and give the money to people who need it. You could use it as an expensive paperweight. You could give it to me.\nI hope those are helpful and I wish you luck in finding the best use for it.\n\nA: You could use it as a remote control for xbmc, iTunes on your Mac or Airfoil Speaker connected to your home theater.\n", "Q: Can Siri be told a ringtone when setting a timer? I normally use the iPhone timer to sleep the device after I've dozed off to some music or podcast. Unfortunately this means that when I ask Siri to set a timer for some cooking, Siri waits the allotted time and turns off the phone rather than notify me that the time is up. Any solutions to this?\n\nA: Sorry, looks like Siri pulls whatever is set in the Clock app for its timers.  The only solution is to manually change it in Clock each time.\n\nA: It's a bit messy but you could leave your timer to sleep iPod and and use the 'set alarm for 45 minutes' or wake me up in 35 minutes to use your alarms instead they should always play out loud. \n", "Q: One Apple ID or Two? Can someone please help me out? I currently own an iPhone and an iPad and my son has a iPod touch 4th Generation. iCloud works well between them, but my wife is looking to get an iPhone as well. If she uses a new Apple ID can she still use my purchased apps? Or if we use the same Apple ID can you separate contacts or would turn it off on one device?\n\nA: You should have one AppleID per person that you use for iCloud, Notes, Contacts, Mail, Calendar and to-do's. You then pick one of these ID's to buy things in iTunes and the App store. You probably want to use the ID you have used to purchased music and apps with up until now.\nSo setup your wife's iDevice(s) with her new AppleID. When you are done, go into Settings/Store and change the AppleID you to your existing ID (only in the store).\nNow you each have your own iCould but everything you buy can be shared between the both of you.\n\nA: This is a seemingly simple question, but the answer is very complex because Apple's intended use case seems to be 1 person with one computer, one iTunes account and one or more iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad (iOS device)s.\nSome facts to frame the answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*An Apple ID is linked to each iTunes account.\n\n*An iOS device can have apps on it from any number of\niTunes accounts\n\n*A device can only sync with one iTunes library at a time.\n\n*Syncing a device with a new iTunes library disassociates it from the previous library (and deletes the media synced from the previous library from the device).\n\n*iCloud accounts store contacts, schedules and email and have little to do with your iTunes content.  You probably want separate iCloud accounts unless you want to get reminders for her appointments and vice versa.\n\n\nGiven this information, there are a couple of solutions.\nSolution 1:\nYou and your wife share a computer and an iTunes library.  Since your devices and hers sync from the same library, you will use the same pool of media and apps.  If your wife gets her own iCloud account, she can set that up separately from the shared iTunes account.  See the following Apple knowledgebase article:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht4895\nThere are no technical problems here.  Though it's conceivable that it would be impractical or undesirable to share a computer and an iTunes account.\nSolution 2:\nYou and your wife use separate iTunes accounts with separate iTunes Libraries, either under separate user accounts on the same computer or on two different computers.  Here, you each keep your stuff separate, but you can authorize her iTunes library to use media from your account and vice versa.  See Apple knowledgebase article:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1420\nYou still probably want different iCloud accounts.\nSolution 3:\nYou use separate iTunes libraries, separate iTunes accounts, but your wife can sign into your iTunes account in the App Store app on her phone and download any of your previous purchases.\nFrom Apple knowledgebase article ht1311:\n\"The account ID that was synced to the device is displayed at the bottom of each page [in the App Store or iTunes apps], so you'll always know what account you are using on the device. Simply open iTunes or the App Store on your iOS device and scroll to the bottom of any page to see which account is currently in use. You can also see this in Settings under the Store option.\"\nI'm sure there are other options, but these are what I see as the best scenarios in descending order.  The first option is the easiest from a technology standpoint, but when you factor in human issues, the second option may be more desirable.\nI hope this is helpful.\n\nA: I would most definitely recommend using two separate Apple ID's for iCloud syncing.  While you can have multiple devices attached to a single Apple ID (as you do with your iPhone and iPad), all of the same information will be pushed to all devices, meaning you would not have the ability to maintain discrete contacts, calendars, bookmarks, etc.  Apple ID's in general, and for iCloud use in particular, are really designed to be single user identifiers.\nThe good news is that using two separate iCloud ID's does not prohibit you and your wife, and your son for that matter, from still sharing App Store purchases.  iOS devices maintain separate login information for iCloud syncing, App Store and iTunes account info.  Once you have set your new phone up with iCloud, go to Settings --> Store and select the Apple ID at the bottom of the screen and sign out.  After signing out, you will be presented with a Sign In button at the top of the screen.  After pressing it, select \"Use Existing Apple ID\".  Now enter the login information for the account all of your app store purchases are under.  You now have iCloud syncing to your wives own personal Apple ID and her apps syncing from your already existing Apple ID.  Just note that if either of you have the \"Automatically download apps\" feature selected, you will receive everything your partner downloads as well as apps you've downloaded.\nIf you have any more questions on this process, I'll be happy to try and expand.\n\nA: Your wife should get her own AppleID and use that for iCloud. To use the same apps as yours, she can enter your ID when prompted and buy new apps with your ID in the store. This is safer than using the same ID for iCloud and try to separate personal data.\n", "Q: Vimeo embedded videos don't show in Safari Vimeo embedded videos do not appear in Safari although they appear in all other browsers on the same machine. Not only do the video not play but the placeholder where the video should be on the page is blank. This seems to be Safari 5 related.\n\nA: First thing that comes to mind for me is if you happen to have any Extensions installed in Safari. You might consider turning them off and reseting Safari from the Safari drop down in the menubar. Clear out caches and and website data. \nIf you are familiar with looking at the page source code and know how to enable and understand Safari 5 developer mode and debug features, you will probably be able to get a good amount of information for that. Keep me attuned and all the best!\nTrial video\n\nA: I have the same problem, Chrome/ Firefox all function fine, but Safari returns a blank space. It works, however, if private browsing is on, but behaves the same (blank) even with a cleared cache/ cookies. Come on Safari, sort this out!\nNo extensions present, so the fix mentioned didn't work.\n\nA: In my case it was an extension called 'Youtube5'. \n", "Q: How do I retrieve stats about my iTunes Match account? I wonder how I can get details on my iTunes Match account. Especially I am interested in how many songs were uploaded to the cloud. Even better: which songs are uploaded, wich ones were matched with iTune songs.\nEDIT: I just found out that a smart playlist would help for that. But then I noticed that I really am interested in \"how many songs can I still add to my iCloud until I reach the 25,000 songs limit\"?\n\nA: You could create a smartlist that only includes songs with the status Matched, Uploaded and Purchased.\n", "Q: Can I change Apple IDs? I originally used my Apple ID with my daughter's iPod and now iPhone so that her purchases would be linked to my credit card. I now know that wasn't necessary. \nI'd like to know how to change this so I can have her get her own Apple ID so her music, apps, etc. don't sync with my iOS devices.  Is there a way to do this?\n\nA: You can sort of do this.\nYou can't make a new account for your daughter and then move existing purchases to be owned by your her new account.  You can use those purchases on her iPod though.\nIf she already has her own computer account and itunes install just move over to a new iTunes account and make new purchases there.  Change your password and move on.   She will no longer be able to buy with your account. You may need to log in every so often so she can get updates of the apps that were purchased by your account but otherwise things will work fine.\nIf you have to split her a new iTunes account out of your existing account it's a bit more complex.  There are a number of ways you can pull this off; here's how I would pull this off.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a computer account for your daughter. \n\n*Make a new Apple account for your daughter.  \n\n*Change your password.\n\n*Authorize this new iTunes with your ID.  It's under Store->Authorize This Computer...  This lets her use content you've purchased with out logging in as you.\n\n*Use Home Sharing to move your old purchases to the new iTunes.  \n\n*Sync her iPhone over to this new iCloud account.\n\n\nAt this point you can remove the purchases for her from your account.  They are in her account and will install and play on her iPhone.  She doesn't have for password and those apps you've already purchased for her are still owned by you.  They won't update without your password.   You'll have to log in for her every so often so that things can update. It'll prompt both on the phone and on the computer when it needs it.\n\nA: I would set up a brand new Apple ID under her email address.\nYou can then transfer the files on your computer to her iTunes account. You will then need to authorize her account to play the purchases made on your account.\nOnce that has been done she will have full access to all the songs you bought her, and be able to make new purchases that will not sync to your devices.\n", "Q: Late 2010 13\" Air humming? I'm sure there's a simple solution but almost daily, when I'm online or working on other programs. A humming sound will begin and gradually get louder. It only stops when I shut the laptop. Thoughts? \n\nA: Do you notice it regardless of what app you are using? I have seen this kind of thing before with various audio drivers. \nIf you can pin point it down to one location/area on the computer you might think about taking it in for diagnostics to an Apple Store or AASP. \nIf it is software related, try keeping an eye on Activity Monitor when it is getting close to the time-frame of the sound and see if you notice any processes starting up that use a hight CPU% or apps that simply stop responding.\n\nA: Take a tube of arms length and hold one end at your ear, and locate the precise place where the hum is sourced.\nTake care to listen to the display (front and back) since it could easily be the power inverter to drive the lcd. Once you've isolated the where, it will be a very quick call to Apple to determine the part affected and the warranty status.\nAlso, don't overlook it could be the speaker system even if you don't expect noise from it.\n", "Q: iTunes does not recognize folder structure when importing music I have imported a lot of Music into iTunes in a folder structure:\n<Artist>/<Album>/<Song>. Unfortunately iTunes has not recognized these information, so that now I just have a lot of songs without artist or album information. (Actually I think that these has always worked until now). \nDo you have any idea what went wrong here and what I could do, to get this information into iTunes (and the iCloud)?\n\nA: Doug's AppleScripts for iTunes are a good place to start looking for any iTunes scripting solutions.\nIn your case Tags Mirror Artist-Album-Filename looks very promising:\n\nThis script copies the names of the Artist folder, Album folder and filename (minus its extension) of the selected tracks' file paths to each corresponding track's artist, album and song name tags, respectively.\nFor best results your files and folders should be arranged in this format:\nArtist folder / Album folder / filename.xxx\n\n\nA: Select some songs (an album or songs from one of your previous folders) r-Click, select 'New playlist from selection'.  And a new playlist in your ipod is created..  \n", "Q: Canon printer always \"busy\" I have a Canon Pixma MX870 and I downloaded and installed drivers from Canon's site.\nI've got it configured on two other macs in my house and it works fine.\nWhen I tried to add the printer using the standard OS X on a new MBP, the preferences app doesn't automatically see the printer. I have added it via IP address and manually chosen the appropriate drivers.\nSo, the first question is -- why didn't the mac see it properly? \nWhen I try to print, the job shows up in the local print queue, but then shows a message saying that \"the printer is busy\". I can printer from the other computers on my network without problem.\nThe second question is -- what can I do about the \"the printer is busy\" message? (I suspect if I resolve the first problem, this one will be a non-issue).\nFor what it's worth, I configured the printer on the other computers when they were running 10.6 (Snow Leopard), the new laptop is running 10.7 (Lion).\n\nA: Since there isn't an answer, I wanted to chime in.\nThanks to the comment, I can confirm deleting and re-adding the printer did the trick.\n", "Q: Remote Management When remote management is enabled on a client computer, does the client computer keep logs of when the computer is being observed, when reports are generated, etc?

I have a 2008 Macbook Pro and my cat recently chew through that power cord. I bought a 85w adpater but I don't want to open it if I know it won't work. \nDoes an 85w work with a 2008 Macbook pro or should I exchange it for the 60w?\n\nA: According to Apple knowledge base entry HT2346 the 85W power adapter is the right one. However, there seem to be issue with \"T\" style (the old) vs. \"L\" style (the new): see this thread. It seems that for some people, a workaround does the trick:\n\nTurn off your computer, flip over the laptop and remove the battery, hold down the circlular button on the battery for 10 seconds, the green light should go out. Re-install the battery and turn your computer on. Your new charger should work fine.\n\nIf that doesn't work, you need to call Apple support to arrange for your power adapter to be replaced with a \"T\" style adapter:\n\nApple is aware of the issue with the pins being at a different depth in the new chargers with the \"L\" shaped connection. After having two new ones not work, I contacted tech support. They sent a new version of the old charger with the square mag safe connector. It works fine.\n\nEdit: Apparently the MacBook SMC Firmware Update 1.4 should fix the \"L\" style power adapter issue on older MacBooks.\n\nA: Yes.  All MacBook Pro 2008 Models can use an 85W Apple Magsafe power adapter.\nThis information is available from Mactracker, an app that catalogs details on every Apple product.\nMactracker is available for free from the Mac App Store and for download at:\nhttp://mactracker.ca/\nI have no connection to the developers of Mactracker, it is just an indispensable tool that I have used for years to identify hardware details on non-current Mac models.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: It actually depends on your screen size.\n\n\n*\n\n*13 inch models can use both 60W and 85W adapters. When connected to the 85W adapter they will simply pull less power.\n\n*The 15 and 17 inch models should only use the 85W adapter as this is the minimum power they need for their batteries.\n\n", "Q: /bin/sh: rm: command not found I have problems with some applications that use AppleScript shell script feature. For example, Growl's uninstall scripts shows an error:\nerror \"/bin/sh: rm: command not found\" number 127\n\nThe source of the script is\ndisplay dialog (localized string \"title\")\nif button returned of result = \"OK\" then\n    try\n        quit application id \"com.Growl.GrowlHelperApp\"\n    end try\n    try\n        quit application id \"com.Growl.MenuExtra\"\n    end try\n    do shell script \"rm -rf /Library/PreferencePanes/Growl.prefPane ~/Library/PreferencePanes/Growl.prefPane\" with administrator privileges\n    display dialog (localized string \"succeeded\") buttons {localized string \"OK\"} default button 1\nend if\n\nI've added echo $PATH > /omg.txt && to the command to see what's the search path for rm. But it has a weird value:\n$ cat /omg.txt \nâ\n\nWhat can I do? I don't understand what's going on. When I just run sudo /bin/sh in Terminal, the environment is just fine!\nNow, I know that to uninstall Growl I can just run the command it tries to run in the Terminal. But it won't solve this problem, just postpone it until another application fails with the same error (it happened before).\n\nA: According to Apple's official documentation, it is by design that shell scripts invoked from AppleScript's do shell script action do not inherit the $PATH variable from your login shell's environment. \nAccordingly, Apple instructs users to use full paths to commands when invoking shell scripts from AppleScript rather than relying on the $PATH variable in the environment.\nIn the script in your example, you could replace rm with /bin/rm\nAccording to the aforelinked documentation, this is the intended, documented behavior; a script that expects the environment's $PATH to be set for do shell script commands is a script with a bug.\nThat said, if you absolutely need to use relative paths and use $PATH to complete them, you could prefix any shell script called by do shell script with the command PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin;\n\nA: hotfix = give the location of rm command:\ndo shell script \"/bin/rm -rf /Library/PreferencePanes/Growl.prefPane ~/Library/PreferencePanes/Growl.prefPane\" with administrator privileges\n\n\nA: You could actually use Daniel's suggestion of exporting paths, but save it as a script unto itself (call it \"dss\" for do shell script, or something) and place it in usr/local/bin. That way the next time you need to run an osa script like the Growl uninstall, you can call your script from the command line to set $PATH, run the osa job, and then be finished. \nNot a permanent solution, but highly workable. \n", "Q: Bash script to toggle wifi in lion Is it possible to have a bash script that toggle my wifi on and off? I am using lion (10.7.2).\n\nA: Assuming your hardware is somewhat similar to mine:\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en1 on\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en1 off\n\nYou can run networksetup -listallhardwareports to find the device (en1) of your Wi-Fi in case it's different.\nTo toggle put something like the following lines into a script or shell function:\n[[ \"$(networksetup -getairportpower en1)\" == *On ]] && v=off || v=on\nnetworksetup -setairportpower en1 $v\n\n\nA: #!/bin/bash\n\ndevice=$(networksetup -listallhardwareports |\ngrep -E '(Wi-Fi|AirPort)' -A 1 | grep -o en.)\n[[ \"$(networksetup -getairportpower $device)\" == *On ]] && v=off || v=on\nnetworksetup -setairportpower $device $v\n\nThe port name is Wi-Fi on 10.7 and AirPort on 10.6. The device name can be at least en0, en1, or en2 depending on your setup.\n\nA: Head over to this page. A guy by the name of heatxsink made a pretty handy script that will toggle your wifi on or off depending on the status of your ethernet connection. \nYou can add your own growl notifications pretty easily if you want.

Why this behavior? How to fix that? It simply makes impossible finding any emails.\nAfter the last update, it became even more annoying. Now it shows \"Deleted Messages\" as well.\n\nThose aren't even actually deleted messages. They are trash of autosave process.\n\nA: When you create an email Mail.app saves a draft. When you type a few more letters Mail.app deletes the old draft and saves a new one.\nIf you have \"store draft messages on the server\" selected (Preferences -> Accounts -> (select account) -> Mailbox behaviours) then every time you make an edit Mail.app sends it to Google then deletes any old drafts. Unfortunately, Google doesn't really delete the old drafts. Instead it moves them to the Bin folder and when you search in Mail.app it finds these hundreds of old drafts.\nTo stop this occurring on future drafts uncheck \"store draft messages on the server\" for all my Gmail accounts.\nTo clear up your old drafts log into to Gmail directly and:\n* Go to the All Mail folder and manually select and delete all the old drafts\n* Go to the Bin folder and select \"Empty Bin\"\n\nA: Empty the trash and try \"Mailbox -> Rebuild\".\n", "Q: iOS reply to email with attachment Is there a way to attach an image from the library using the default Mail app, while replying to an email?\n‘Email photo’ in the Camera roll creates a new message, and ‘Reply’ doesn't give you an option to attach, as far as I can tell. I would also like to have the ability to attach multiple images.\n\nA: The easiest way to add a photo as an attachment is to open you photo library while multi-tasking find the photo you want to attach.\nHold down on the image until the copy button appears, Hit copy.\nGo back to Mail and hold down in the body of the message. Hit paste when the option shows up.\nRepeat until you have all the attachments you wanted.\n\nA: Its also possible to attach multiple photos at once.

This means I can't boot to target disk mode or to an OS X install DVD.\nMy goal is to reinstall the OS.  I've already saved all the data I need.  I know I can remove the hard drive, put it in an enclosure and wipe it with another computer, but I'd rather not go that route until I have to, since it's a big pain with that model of MBP (I did it once before).

Observations: Recently, not sure when it happened, with upgrade to Lion or before, but I have not been able to cleanly watch a video of any type in iTunes while something [movie, tv show, app, podcast, etc.] is downloading from the iTunes store. This is particularly annoying when renting a movie, and trying to start watching before the movie is downloaded. There have been no hardware changes, and playback used to work perfectly during download. There have been a lot of recent changes to iTunes, Mac OS, and I would like to fault isolate. How can I determine which software might be causing this problem, or if something is interfering with playback?\nProblem: iTunes video playback is choppy only while downloading anything from the iTunes store.

It sometimes even does it when I have too many programs open for an extended period of time.\nDoes anyone have any ideas as to the cause of this? If so, what would be a good solution?\n\nA: That's quite an odd issue.  I would suggest re-installing OS X Lion and seeing if that rectifies the situation.  If that doesn't fix it, I'd take it to an Apple Authorised Service Provider (AASP) or an Apple Store - sounds like either the AirPort card or the Main Logic Board in that unit is faulty.

Should I move the swap location for my Mac from the SSD to the larger HDD in my laptop?\nBackground information: I've heard some suggestions in the general PC/Windows world that if you have an SSD for your OS and HDD for your user data, you should move the swap location/swap file away from the SSD to the HDD (perhaps re protecting the hits on the SSD perhaps).  Note I have a MacBookPro with SSD & HDD both in it (using the optical drive bay).\nPS.  Question stems from Steve's words from http://www.grc.com/sn/sn-284.txt \n\nSTEVE:  And Mark Thompson and I have discussed this at length.  He's\n  performed the experiment of using an SSD for a swap file and watching\n  it burn out the SSD.  I mean, in a relatively short time it just\n  killed it.  And so, anyway, so my advice stands, which is, if you're\n  using an SSD, hopefully before you have gone to the expense of using\n  an SSD, which is still much more expensive than a hard drive, you will\n  have invested money in as much RAM as your system can handle because\n  RAM is much less expensive, and you'll get much more, you'll get huge\n  benefit from going to the most RAM you can possible get.  And if\n  you've done that, then turn off pagefiles.  And if the only drive you\n  have is an SSD, I stand by my advice.\nI agree that, from a performance standpoint, the SSD is a perfect\n  device for containing the pagefile.  Unfortunately, Microsoft thrashes\n  their pagefile.  I mean, they're writing to it a lot.  Yes, 40 times\n  less than they're reading, but it's something that's going on all the\n  time, pretty much.  I mean, we've all seen, we've watched the hard\n  drive light flickering there, like when nothing is going on.  It's\n  like, what is it doing?  Well, who knows.  But we know that it's\n  writing to the pagefile, which it does a lot.  So anyway, I think it's\n  a perfect example of two different people with very different aspects\n  of the problem that they're addressing.  I'm looking at long-term\n  life.  Microsoft's looking at performance.\n\n\nA: I am certainly not an expert, but I would think that the faster read/write rates on an SSD would ensure faster performance on large programs than the hdd would. \n\nA: *\n\n*Try to work as you usually do without writing to any drive except SSD\n(well at least not vast amounts).\n\n*Watch Disk Activity tab in Activity Monitor after a day or two.\n\n*Extrapolate Data written value\n\n*Compare to the spec of your particular SSD.\n\n\nP.S. Here is people are killing their SSD for you and me. \n\nA: I love listening to Security Now and you can go both ways on this.\nSwap on SSD:\nYes, the HDD is slower, but one thing you have to remember is you are using a Mac, not Windows.  Windows tries to move things out from ram into swap as quickly as it can, leading to the hard drive thrashing.  However on a Mac, memory management is much better.  Instead of keeping stuff in ram for the future like on Windows, it releases unused memory.  I have 9 Safari tabs, Mail, iTunes, an RSS reader, and Minecraft running right now and not one byte in swap (I do have 8GB of ram).  If something does go to swap, it probably won't be used soon and have a low write usage (SSDs only wear out during writes, not reads).\nSwap on HDD\nIf you are doing media editing, then use your HDD for the swap.  You will be putting a lot into memory and swap and see a lot of thrashing.  The larger space makes more room for the swap so you don't run out of memory.  Having the swap on a different drive is good practice anyways so that memory management can be done at the same time as general data management, instead of waiting on one for the other.\n", "Q: Is there a keyboard shortcut for sleeping a display? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs it possible to put the display to sleep without putting the whole computer to sleep? \n\nWhat is the keyboard command to sleep (or turn off) a display, but not actually put the computer to sleep?\n\nA: The keyboard command for sleeping all displays is Control ^ + Shift ⇧\n + Eject ⏏\n.

Is there anything to consider if I want to share a Time Machine backup drive between a Lion machine and a Snow Leopard machine (a USB drive that I would be rotating between the two computers)? Obviously I cannot use encryption (since Snow Leopard will not be able to use the disk), but are there any other gotchas? For example, will Spotlight behave (i.e. not constantly re-index because of the version change)?\n\nA: In general, there are no issues or side-effects of using a drive connected in turn to any number of macs with mixes of OS levels since each Mac only writes to its own backup folder. \nThe obvious exception is Lion style FileVault encryption where Snow Leopard and older macs will be prevented from reading or writing the drive. \n\nThe only other problem is if you mix lion and snow leopard on the same Mac and (or) let lion \"inherit\" the backup of another machine. \nIn that one case, the contents of the backup are mixed and you can't be guaranteed a restore of system files will work. Your data and pictures and other files will be fine but anything tied to database files or a specific version of the mail app (for example) can depend on versioning. \nThis isn't really a side effect of Time Machnie changing how it works, but of the OS and app changes. \n\nA: My initial experience so far is that a Snow Leopard backup not visible from Lion (even if it was the same machine being upgraded). If you enter Time Machine after the upgrade in Lion your earliest backup that you could recover to is at the point Lion is installed - I had to browse and compare the sparsebundle to pull out all my pre Lion files.\nHaving said that, I would recommend creating a separate sparsebundle for your Snow Leopard install (or your secondary OS). It is not difficult to do and it keeps a separation of the two operating systems.

I never use the \"Reader\" feature in iOS 5's Mobile Safari, and the button for it sits there in the address bar just being a nuisance when I want to see or edit the URL in the address box.

Does archived mail in iCloud count towards your iCloud storage allowance?\n\nA: It does indeed - all mail that 'exists' is taking up space and therefore counts towards your allowance limit. The only way to free up space is to delete things fully. \n\nA: According to Apple,\n\nWhen you sign up for iCloud, you automatically get 5GB of free storage. And that’s plenty of room, because of the way iCloud stores your content. Your purchased music, apps, books, and TV shows, as well as your Photo Stream, don’t count against your free storage. Since your mail, documents, Camera Roll, account information, settings, and other app data don’t use as much space, you’ll find that 5GB goes a long way. And if you need more storage, you can easily purchase a storage upgrade right from your device.\n\nSo yes, mail counts against your storage allowance, but photos, music, apps, books, and TV shows do not.\n", "Q: How to find the iTunes Store link of an installed App? I have one of the numerous flashlight apps that I wanted to recommend to a friend.  \n\nWhat is the easiest way to retrieve the iTunes Store link from my already installed iOS App ?\nThe info window was helpful as I could find the App by searching for the name of the developer.\nAnd apparently the ID can also be found in the iTunesMetadata.plist inside the .ipa file.\nFor this App its: http://itunes.apple.com/app/id384021568\nIs there an easier, more straight-forward way to retrieve the iTunes Store link ?\n\nA: Google your app by name.

I want to import an audiobook where there are 14 folders on the form \"Author - CD ## - Title\", and the mp3-files are on the form \"### - Author - Title\" (incrementally over all CDs, so the last file of 'CD 01' is named '012...\", and the first file of 'CD 02' is named '013...'.\nHowever, the ID3 tag stupidly consist of \"Title = Author\", and nothing else. And when imported the files are scattered around randomly in the playlist.\nHow do I sort a playlist by filename?\nor; How do I remove the ID3-tags of a folder of folders of mp3-files on Mac easily.\n\nA: Unfortunately this is not possible. As there isn't a column available for filename, one can't sort by it.\nIf you're willing to take the time, you can input the metadata and sort by track number. You'd only really need to enter the track numbers incrementally (like the file names), but you might instead choose to number the tracks per disk and then input which disk they're on as well. This way would need to be sorted by Album rather than track number, as it would otherwise go 1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,… rather than 1,2,3,…1,2,3,…1,2,3,….\nSorry it's so inconvenient, but I hope this works for you. :)\n\nA: If you drag a folder on a playlist from Finder and sort the playlist by the first column, the items are usually sorted by filename.\nYou might also run a script like this in AppleScript Editor:\ntell application \"iTunes\" to repeat with t in (get selection)\n    set comment of t to POSIX path of (get location of t)\nend repeat\n\nThen sort the tracks by the comment field.\nTo delete all tags, run sudo easy_install pip;sudo pip install mutagen, then run something like for f in *.mp3;do mid3v2 --delete-all \"$f\";done, and then tell iTunes to update the tags by selecting the items and running tell app \"iTunes\" to refresh selection.\n\nA: The 1st sort column is sorted by when the file was added to the playlist. If you can drag them into the playlist in the order you want...you are set\n\nA: On Windows 8.1, this works for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create new playlist in iTunes\n\n*Find files in Windows Explorer\n\n*Ctrl-A to select all files\n\n*Drag files into iTunes - ensuring that the drag point is from the first file in the list.\n\n\nIf you drag from mid way down the file list, you get unexpected file ordering.\nI'm surprised this works but it does seem repeatable.\n", "Q: How can I navigate any directory in Finder?

Streaming it over the internet would be even better...\n\nA: TJUNKS Video Camera\nYou can stream to other devices. This app does a lot, with video including uploading and sharing video on facebook, twitter etc but to stream video all the devices will need this app.\nIt also works across platform.\nAs far as personal experience goes I have only used it once to test it quickly, it workked accross a home WiFi network, other than curiosity I had no need for this.\n\nA: You may be interested in this incredibly awesome little app called CollabraCam. I've never used it, but the idea is just brilliant. One iOS device serves as the \"director,\" and receives video from up to 4 other iOS devices. The Director can send requests to the cameramen (pan up, shift left, zoom in), and I think can record video by switching between different live feeds.\nCollabraCam is obviously designed for making movies with multiple camera operators, but it sounds like it might suit your simpler purpose of just broadcasting a live camera from one iOS device to another.\nI should mention that I have absolutely no experience with this thing, I just think it's incredibly cool.\n(By the way, the wording of your question (\"capture live video\") is a little confusing. I'm not sure if you want to capture video and stream it afterwards, or if you want to view a live feed with/without recording it. In any event, I think readers who arrive at your question because they are curious about streaming live video from one device to another will find CollabraCam interesting).\nUPDATE:\nAfter answering this post I became curious and bought CollabraCam. I thought it would be fun to mount my iPhone on an RC car, and stream video back to my iPad. Turns out CollabraCam does work for live streaming, but not very fluidly. The video feed staggers a lot, and is definitely too slow to use for steering an RC car. \nI didn't try anything to speed up the system -- I think I could create an ad hoc network with a laptop, and thereby get faster WiFi streaming than going over the home router...\nBut the short message is, CollabraCam does work for live streaming, but maybe there are better solutions out there.\n\nA: I think I have the perfect solution for you,\nI found an application called Friendsee!\nYou can stream live video with great quality to all of your iOS friends, and directly to your facebook wall or twitter account (with 3G/Wifi connection), its really simple and fast, I think it's the fastest way to broadcast live stream with iphone\nGood luck & Enjoy!\n", "Q: Strange behavior in Terminal with custom .bash_profile It's hard to describe the behavior, but here's a short clip:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KqHBA94FPI\nBasically, when entering multi-line commands, at the end of the first line, the insertion block goes back to the start of the first line, writes over the first line, then continues like normal on to the second, third, etc. lines.

I am finding that lately, quite often pushing my iPod Touch's home button doesn't generate any response - I have to push it again really hard. I'm not sure if it's an issue with the OS or with the hardware.\nI haven't jailbroken, and my iPod touch is a new 4th Gen 8GB model bought in September 2011.\nAny help is much appreciated.\n\nA: The unresponsive iPhone/iPod Touch home button is a known problem. I had an iPhone which started with the same problem as yours. At first the home button worked with just a soft touch, and from any angle. Then it started to work only with a hard press and not at all from certain angles. Finally, it either completely ignored presses, or responded to a single press as if it had been pressed twice (multitasking bar appeared).\nIt was still inside the one-year warranty, but I bought AppleCare anyway, figuring that it might recur. I took it to an Apple Store and the guy played with it for a minute, told me I had a faulty device and gave me a brand new iPhone. The home button can't be replaced, so they just give you a new one.\nMy advice it to take it to an Apple Store if there's one nearby, or if not call Apple and report the problem. Most likely you'll get a new, working iPod Touch.\n\nA: This should not be the case.\nIf this is not responding as it should, and providing you have not got it wet (which will often cause a poor response form home button) you should take it back to the shop you bought it in and have them replace it.\nThe option they have is to either replace or repair it. This is really where you should go first.\nHowever Apple have a very good customer service policy, and their stores are owned by Apple and not franchised distributers, which means that you are dealing with the manufacturer directly and they are very likely to just replace the device for a new one, or a refurbished one.\n\nA: if home button stopped working...\n\n\n*\n\n*go to settings->general->accessibility\n\n*turn on AssistiveTouch in the Physical & Motor section near bottom\n\n*A little round home button appears! \n\n*Double click it for the multitsask bit \n\n*click it to select home and other options.\n\n\nA: If pushing the button harder does have an effect, this should be a hardware - not a software problem, IMHO.

This works when my iPad's home button plays up.\n\nA: I have been having the same problem. It appears to be completely non functioning at this time.  Today I went to the apple store in the local mall.  They will completely replace the entire ipod 4 and give me a brand new one for $99!  Not too bad considering I paid almost $400 for it brand new.  But in the meantime, they placed a VIRTUAL HOME button on the screen of my ipod! Works great!! Now I can access everything and don't have to worry about the home key.  So, before I do the trade, I am going to be satisfied with the Virtual home key.  It might be an app, not really sure, as a worker at Apple installed it on mine. \n\nA: Mine was doing the same thing..frustrating ..had a can of aerosol contact cleaner from The Source..gave the iPod 4 a super quick spray into the opening on the bottom where the USB cord plugs in and it instantly works like new.. No more pushing and holding to get it to do anything\n\nA: I've also used the drop of water trick in the past and it worked on my iPad. I tried the same on my iPhone a few times since I was having the same issue but it never seemed to make a difference. I finally stopped by the apple store and they swapped out my phone for another one. It wasn't within warranty, but the guy said the issue was a common one. Might be worth giving your local Apple store a try if the issue persists.\n\nA: Put on drop of water on the home button and press it and move your finger in circles  ... If it's dust what made the problem .. It will go away .... If it doesn't response then you have to change your home button  ....\nI fixed my home bottom using one drop of water\n.....

If you want to disable notifications that are based on an Internet connection (e.g. NYTimes, ESPN), you can put your iPhone in airplane mode which turns off wifi, 3G, and Bluetooth so you don't have an Internet connection. For apps that send notifications at a certain time (e.g. iCal reminders), there's no easy way to turn those off all at once other than turning them off individually in settings>notifications.\n", "Q: iPhone lock screen/multitasking bar audio controls don't work From time to time (in fact very often) my iPhone will stop displaying the lock screen \"now playing\" info, and subsequently the controls won't be there.\nI can still start the music app playing something, but I can't pause or skip tracks.\nThe same thing can be seen if I try to use the multitasking audio controls (swipe \"left\" on the multitasking bar). The play/pause button won't stop audio playback. Can't skip.\nSame problem with the headset remote buttons. Can often start audio playing (although what it'll play is random). Can not stop/pause, can not skip.\nI've not been able to reproduce this reliably, but it happens often. The phone is in this state more than it isn't. A restart resolves this most times.\nHow to fix?\n\nA: Possible Causes:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Mobile substrate add ons on a jailbroken device  \n\n*Corrupt event handling events  \n\n*Loss of data with streaming services  \n\n*Accessory interference  \n\n*Airplay  \n\n*Older version of iTunes  \n\n\nSeveral things to try:  \n\n\n*\n\n*If you are jailbroken try booting into safe mode (SBSettings Feature).  \n\n*If problem is with data streaming app then try the iPod app.\n\n*If accessories are connected, disconnect them.\n\n*If the problem persists, restore to the latest version of iOS and update iTunes.\n\n\nA: Do a hard reset. Hold the sleep/wake button and home button together until the phone turns itself off and keep holding the power button for a few extra seconds but let go of the home button as soon as the phone turns off. \nWait about 3 minutes. Turn your phone back on.\nNow, open the multitasking tray and quit everything that is open.\nIf this works, then problem solved, if not, try a restore in iTunes. If that helps then problem solved, if not, go to the Genius Bar.\n\nA: It's a bug: only Apple can solve it with an update. It's not iTunes — it happens to any app you can listen music with, for instance I use YouTube but I can't pause/skip either, but I do remember that it worked till I fully turned it off. It could be that it changes if you turn off your iPhone and then turn it back on again. I would give this a try if I were you.\n\nA: I was facing the same issue.

Since iOS 1 I have always lost Gigs of storage to the \"Other\" category on my iPhone. \nI have cleared my Safari data, told my phone not to sync music, apps and just about every other syncable option and yet I still find myself loosing 2-4 gigs of storage after about a month of use. \nI have read that the issue lies in the way iOS and iTunes handle deleting data, incomplete synchronization and building the iTunes library on the Phone. \nThe \"Other\" Section in iTunes normally does contain 70 - 200 MBs for system information but 2-4 gigs is clearly an error. How can I fix this or am I stuck Restoring my phone every month?\nProblem Details:\n\n\n*\n\n*iTunes is up to date and I have tried on both OS X 10.6.x and 10.7.x\n\n*Have Had issue with iPhone, 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S, iPad and iPod touch 2nd\nGen.\n\n*Devices are not and have not been jailbroken\n\n*Application data has been accounted for\n\n*Safari Data has been cleared\n\n*5.1GB Audio/0.01GB Photos 3.1GB Apps/0.04GB Books\n\n\nA: I cleared 2gb of \"other\" space by using DiskAid to dig into the file system of the phone and clear out corrupted data. \nWARNING - this may be dangerous, use extreme caution. If in doubt, don't.\nOnce diskaid is installed and running, click the file system menu on the left to expand the folders on the right. When looking around, I found a 2gb file in applicationarchives related to a program that I know didn't download correctly, and had since been deleted. Removing the file freed up the \"other\" space.\n\nA: I have been looking into this issue for a long time and it would seem that the problems lie in the textlogs. If you like to save all of your text conversations and your contacts like to send you pics and movies then your other data will fill up with this you can also save a lot of space by deleting your voicemail and deleting the trash and old messages. \n\nA: I had 3.5Gb of \"Other\", so I did a wipe and restore, and now I have 0.62Gb of \"Other\".\n\nA: Figured it out in my case, with iTunes Match installed go to Settings > General > Usage then click Music and swipe to delete, then restart your phone. \nAll your music is still there and other is cleared. This can also help in traditional sync if your phone is confused and has music from more than one computer. This isn't supposed to happen, so the system no longer cleans older music up and this is less destructive than a total erase/restore.\n\nA: I believe the 2-4 gigs (more on that below) are the OS itself as well as logs, data receipts, and other files that are created as you use your device. All of these files add up, with the OS being the bulk of the \"Other\". \nAlso, you are correct that 4 gigs seems a bit high and it is likely an error. I have had the problem of iTunes miscalculating how much storage I actually have left. Sometimes, the best solution is to go to the Apple Store's Genius Bar. They will be able to give you a much clearer answer than I.\n", "Q: Zoom level in Pages 09 not WYSIWYG? I'm using Pages 09 to prepare a document and have just noticed that the Zoom level (at least on my install) is not WYSIWYG.\nThe Page setup is correctly showing A4 as the output paper size.  \nThe default Zoom and the Zoom setting for the document are both at 125%.\nThe computer is a Macbook Air 13.3\", so has a resolution of 1440X900.\nAs far as I can tell it the zoom level would need to be about 175% to be correct.\n(A quick look at Wikipedia shows that the Air has a DPI of 128PPI which may be the issue) \nIs there a default that can be changed to set Pages to assume that DPI is greater than the default (presumably 72 ppi)\n\nA: To answer your question simply. No. Pages is great at what it does, but I've yet to find a way to get it to truly be WYSIWYG. \n\nA: If you're simply looking for exactly the zoom necessary to be 1:1 with real life, I'd recommend telling it to scale with window size. Then resize the window until you achieve a 1:1 ratio and remember that zoom value.\nIt's quite difficult to code applications to know exactly what's WYSIWYG, as screens have lots of different resolutions.\n", "Q: \"USB device drawing too much power\" error on startup with no devices connected Since upgrading to Lion, I get this error every time I start up:\n\nI've read the answers suggested here, but they seem to indicate that it's the presence of a second device that's causing the problem. The only USB device I have plugged in to my laptop is an external keyboard. I'm not sure how that's using too much power, but it's disabled my other USB ports.\nIs there any way to fix this?\n\nA: It could be a corrupt USB kernel extension.  I'd try booting to Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off your Mac.\n\n*Turn it back on and before you see the Apple logo on your screen, press and hold the Shift key until the Apple logo appears.\n\n*A progress bar should appear below the Apple logo - during this time your Mac is performing a directory check and loads only necessary Apple kernel extensions (among other small things).\n\n\nA feature of Safe Mode is that it reloads the kernel extensions from scratch, instead of from a cache file.  It could be that during the Lion upgrade a kernel extension was damaged and has been cached afterwards.\nTry the Safe Mode boot and see how it goes.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: In my case one of the metal prongs (cut out of the metal casing on the side without the connection pins) inside a usb port had been bent and was touching the other side, once this was corrected with a small screwdriver all my USB ports worked again and this error message disappeared.\nThis is probably the problem if you cannot fully insert a usb plug into any of the ports.\n\nA: Another reason that this happens is when the device's USB cable is ripped/torn/ has a small hole. I had gone to sync my iPad with iTunes  and suddenly was getting this message. The only other thing I had plugged into my computer was my printer, so I disconnected the printer. Then I tried again, but still got the message.\nI was stumped so I started looking at the USB cable itself, and sure enough, there was a tear in it, and it was quite small but it was  a tear in the cable that protects the wires inside. That was enough for it to cause the problem, but to be sure, I used my extra USB cable and was able to sync no problem. \nAfter syncing with the \"good\" usb cable, I tried to sync with the bad one, and sure enough I got the error message again.\nSometimes you don't always see rips or tears in those cables. Maybe it got pinched behind something or whatever, but the smallest in it is enough to do it.\nSo that is another reason why some might get  that \" because a usb device was drawing too much power from your computer, one or more of your USB devices have been disabled\" messages. \n\nA: I had the same issue with my old MacBook; one of the USB ports was totally fried.  Doubt it's Lion-related, but I can't rule that out for sure.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I tried to plug my ipad into my computer and every time it gave me that error message. The strange thing was that I rebooted my computer using safe mode and it worked, but then i put it back in the regular mode and got the same message again. So then I took out the usb and examined it, and i saw what looked like a speck of dust inside it, so i blew into it until i couldnt see the speck anymore and then reinserted it and then it worked. \n\nA: Just got the same problem today with my iPad. After inspection it looks like the problem is in the cable. I have inserted it directly in the power unit and the charging indicator became very sensitive as I moved the cable up and down. \nIt is a shame that Apple supplies expensive iPads with that kind of cables.\n", "Q: Transfer Video to iOS iMovie I have an iPad 2 running 5.0.1 and I want to transfer a video file from my iMac to edit on the iPad with iMovie. The movie was filmed on my friends iPhone 4S and I imported it to my iMac, then used iTunes file sharing to put it on my iPad. When I go to iMovie on my iPad and create a new project, there are no video files there for me to use, but the iPad says iMovie has 600MB worth of documents and data in the usage screen(I don't have any other clips in iMovie). Why can't I edit the video, and how should I transfer video in the future?\n\nA: Bare in mind only footage shot with an iDevice can be edited on iMovie for iPad. That being the case, it's just a matter of finding the correct format.\nWired has dedicated a whole article to this specific matter.\nBasically it comes down to convert the video to a specific MP4 with the H.264 codec. You can do this by following these easy steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Convert your movie to .mp4 on your Mac (if it isn't already in this format)\n\n*Convert your movie to an iMovie movie with the 264 codec\n\n*Use iTunes to transfer you movies to your iPad\n\n\nNormally your files should appear in the iMovie project dashboard.\n\nA: I've done this by putting mp4 h264 video files into Dropbox to get them onto the iPad.  Then in the Dropbox app on the iPad you tap the ... menu where you can Export the file into the Movies folder.  At that point iMovie can use it.\nIt feels ridiculous that there isn't a way to just plug the iPad in via USB and drag and drop files to accomplish this.\n\nA: You could turn on photo stream on your mac and ipad (use the same apple id) and then transfer the video to the ipad. Then open it in iMovies on the ipad.\n", "Q: What is a good way to archive iTunes movies? I have bought a decent number of movies off of iTunes through various sales. The issue is, they take up a lot of space on my 120GB hard drive. I want to free up space, but I also do not want to lose the movies I have put money into.\nWhat is the best way to archive iTunes movies in such a way that I can access them quickly if I want to watch them? After watching my sister lose 3 years worth of pictures to a faulty external drive, I am not overly trusting of them. Are there any other options out there?\n\nA: I know you have said you would rather not use an external hard drive, but my technique for storing films for iTunes is to store them on the external hard drive and link them to iTunes by dragging them whilst holding Ctrl and Shift (on a Windows machine) which rather than copying into the iTunes folder just short cuts to it effectively.\n\nA: I use my web server that I pay for with my website. I upload (overnight) the files to a folder that only I can access with FTP and the files are safe and secure. If I ever needed to, I could click a few buttons and download the entire folder to restore all of my movies, though it would take a while. If you plan on doing this, use ethernet and have a fast internet connection.\n", "Q: How can I avoid notes to be deleted from the iPhone when I delete them on my Mac Email app? Since the last software update on my iPhone 3 all the notes that I writte on the iPhone appears in the mail.app on my mac as income mails. \nWhen I delete the notes at the Mail.app, they are also deleted at the iPhone. \nDo you know how to avoid the notes to be deleted?\nThanks!\n\nA: Turn off notes sync in Settings -> Mail,Calender,Contacts -> select your account and then turn off notes sync.\nIn Mail if you hit command + comma you can also stop showing notes in the inbox.\n\nA: When you connect your iPhone, you should have the option in iTunes to turn off the syncing of your Notes.\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT4191\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to Preferences in Mail.app on your iMac\n\n*Go to account\n\n*Then, click account that notes hooked in\n\n*See, the show notes in inbox\n\n*Unchecked it\n\n\nGood luck :D\n", "Q: How do I troubleshoot Siri? I just got my 4S yesterday (thanks AT&T for the early upgrade date!).  I've noticed two problems with Siri and I don't know any good methods to troubleshoot.\n1) When I hold the phone up to my head from the home screen, Siri starts, beeps and etc.  When my wife holds the phone to her head, nothing happens. \n2) I've tried to set \"geofenced\" reminders -- \"When I leave here, remind me...\" sort of stuff.  I've not yet actually gotten the reminder to trigger, even though Siri told me it was set.\nI'm sure I'll run into further Siri issues as it becomes a bigger part of my life.\nWhat I'm asking for is not specific answers to the problems listed above (though they would be cool).  I'm trying to get a better feel for generalize Siri troubleshooting techniques.\n\nA: There isn't a lot you can do about holding it up to your wife's head, perhaps it isn't close enough. You will notice that if you try to fool the phone by holding it up to your had or arm siri will not activate. \nAs for the geofenced reminders, you need to have location services turned on for reminders.\nYou will also need to set the address in your contacts, so add your home and work address to your contact.\nFor troubleshooting you will really need to look into the apps you are trying to control from Siri, as Siri itself is not an app, it is part of iOS. It is each individual app that will need to be looked at when troubleshooting.\nRemember that Siri is still in beta and you can expect some teething problems with it.\n", "Q: Is it normal for a 2011 MBP to display \"Not Charging\" while using Skype? Whenever I use Skype, my MBP displays \"Not Charging\" about 95% of the time. When it is charging, it is extremely slow, gaining 1% over maybe an hour or so. Additionally, if I start using Skype on battery power, with my Mac charged at 100%, the battery drains to nothing over just an hour and a half, on average. I'm literally running Skype and Safari (Facebook) and that is it.\nWhen I use battery power, the screen brightness is at 50%.\nI use Growl, iCloud, and an app called UnPlugged (a preference pane) that alerts me whenever my Mac is plugged in or unplugged.\nThe Mac was purchase 5 months ago, and is well maintained.\n2.3 GHz i7\n4 GB 1333 Mhz DDR3 Ram\n750 GB HD\nOS 10.7.2\nBuild 11C74\n\nA: When you have Skype running, and you see either slow charging or fast battery draining (depending on whether or not it's plugged in), launch an application called Activity Monitor. You can launch it from Spotlight, or from the Finder when you go to the /Applications/Utilities folder, or from Launchpad if you go into the Utilities folder.\nWith Activity Monitor open, click on the column header that says \"% CPU\", and click it again if needed to make the little triangle point down. This will show your running applications, with the ones using the most CPU at the top. Also, you can select \"CPU\" from the tab bar near the bottom of the window. There you'll see a graph of the load (or demand) on the CPU.\nThis will give you indications of whether the CPU is working excessively, and which applications are causing the issue. It's a fair assumption that Skype is using a lot of CPU for some reason. Do some observations, then go to the Skype support webpage (for US English, go here: https://support.skype.com/en-us/).\nIf you find that some other process or application is causing the high CPU usage, leave a comment here or update your original question with your findings.\n\nA: I can confirm you that it's NOT normal at all. When the charger is on, provided it's the right one and the Tension/Power is correct, the mac should not do that. \nIf your battery is below 98% (apron.), plugging it to the wall should charge it and then it should switch to \"Charged 100% (or 99/98%) and start using the power from the outlet (and not the battery).\nTHe Not Charging can occur when: \n\n\n*\n\n*The battery is faulty (and therefore it doesn't charge) so the board is reporting this to you: \"hey, this battery is not charging and it should\".\n\n*The Power Adapter is not delivering the correct power (or enough power if the tension is low). This can cause the charging board to cut the battery charging process because there's not enough power to guarantee a proper charge (and failure to do this may result in your battery life being decreased). \n\n*The unlikely event where you've connected way too many devices to your USB/FW/Etc. ports in your computer, and the power adapter can't keep with the power demand. (I've only seen this happen once with a POWERBOOK a long time ago). \n\n\nSkype, with all the bad things it has, cannot drain your battery like that (unless, of course, it's a high CPU usage like bneely said in the previous answer).\nIf you restart and keep noticing this, I'd recommend two paths: \n1) Create a new blank user and try from there. See if you get the same problem. If yes, then see #2, if not, then it's some software problem and we can move from there.\n2) If the issue still persists with a new user after a hard reboot and you've performed the basic stuff, I'd take the machine to an App Store for further inspection. If your power adapter is bad, it can slowly damage your battery capacity (it's the same as if you use a higher power adapter than the one you're supposed to use, yes, it can charge faster, but you're draining your battery). \n", "Q: How do I sync iCloud iWork documents with Lion? I have been using my iPad with Numbers and would like to be able to just open them up on my Mac with Lion. I can not figure out how to connect/sync to iCloud documents. I have checked iCloud documents for syncing, but my documents don't appear on my Mac. \nI have even set up my mobile documents folder on the desktop. I can drag files to the iCloud that way, but then I can not open them from that folder. Frustrating. \n\nA: Unfortunately, Macintosh does not (yet) support complete iCloud synchronization for documents. We can only hope that Apple will implement this at some point soon.\nIn the mean time, go to http://www.icloud.com/ and sign in. You can drag documents to and from the appropriate section on your computer, and it'll work with your iPad. There's still another bug, which involves Mac > Mac syncing, but as long as you just do iPad > Mac or Mac > iPad, it'll work fine. :)\nAlso, there is a folder located at ~/Library/Mobile Documents/ which contains your iCloud-enabled apps' data. This includes the iWork suite, but unfortunately iWork documents aren't saved as the normal filetypes (e.g. \".pages\"), so they can't be opened on their own.\n\nA: The following works on Lion 10.7.4:\nWarning! If you don't know what you are doing, then you probably shouldn't be doing this. You take all responsibility for nuking your own iCloud data.\n\n\n*\n\n*As usual, make sure you have iCloud setup for your user and enable Documents & Data sync.\n\n\nExecute next steps from Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal):\n\n\n*\n\n*run: sudo nano /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.ubd.plist - change RunAtLoad from false to true\n\n*run: defaults write com.apple.ubd kUBSyncEnabledKey -bool true\nAt this point, ubd needs to be restarted..\n\n\n*\n\n*run: launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.ubd.plist\n\n*run: launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.ubd.plist\nnow ~/Library/Mobile Documents should be synced up.\nIf for some reason it's still not syncing after step 4, try logging out and back in.\n", "Q: How can I be auto logged in with the computer locked? I want to have the computer log me in so all my login items can get started, but I need it to be secure, aka it still needs to ask me for my password before I can actually use the computer.\n\nA: I outlined how to do this at https://www.engadget.com/2011-03-07-terminally-geeky-use-automatic-login-more-securely.html but I will summarize it for you:\n\n*\n\n*set your account to autologin\n\n*create a login item (using launchd) which calls:\n\n\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend\n\nNOTE: that command should be ONE LONG LINE not two lines with a line break/line feed.\nA more thorough explanation is available at TUAW, so I won't repeat it all here, because those are the relevant details.\nWhat it does:\nThe idea is very simple, your account is set to auto-login, so all of your login items will run, however, one of those login items (the CGSession command listed above) will tell the loginwindow to appear. If you have used Fast User Switching before, you will be familiar with how it works.\n\"But what if someone holds down the shift key to stop autolaunching?\"\nIn my testing, that will also prevent the user from being automatically logged in.\nIs this 100% as safe as not using auto-login?\nProbably not, but I'd consider it close to 99.999% as safe.\nThat said, use at your own risk, etc.\n\nA: Since not everybody is familiar with creating a launchd / launchctl script, here's how you do it.\nThis explains step two of @TJ Luomas' answer and provides another option for locking your computer based on @jordanbtucker's answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set your account to auto login\n\n*Open TextEdit and create a new file containing the following\n#!/bin/bash\n\n/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Another option is to put the screen to sleep combined with requiring a password every time your computer wakes from sleep, which keeps more processes enabled\n\n*To use this alternate method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General and enable Require password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins\n\n*Use this script instead\n#!/bin/bash\n\npmset displaysleepnow\n\n\n\n\n*Name the file suspend.sh and save it to your User folder (~)\n\n\n*\n\n*Starting in Catalina, launchd may not be able to access the script from your User folder due to new privacy restrictions; I have confirmed it works from your Applications folder without requiring any privilege changes\n\n\n*Open TextEdit and create a new file with the following content\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.fl034.suspendAfterLogin</string>\n    <key>Program</key>\n    <string>/Users/fl034/suspend.sh</string>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace fl034 with your username\n\n*Ensure the Program path matches the location you chose in step 3\n\n\n*Save the file to ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.fl034.suspendAfterLogin.plist, replacing fl034 with your username\n\n*Restart your Mac to see if it works\n\nWARNING: This script leads to problems with App Store.app in macOS Catalina\n\nA: In System preferences set the screen saver so that it is on and required a password to start\n\nI left the Disable automatic login ticked really as a mistake as to answer the user exactly this should be unticked.\nHowever I would strongly suggest that it is ticked otherwise any could reboot the computer and get into a logged in session as the user.\n\nA: Such behavior is not possible to be set in the System Preferences. Login Items are user specific. They aren't loaded unless you select a user and enter the password.\nYou would need to e.g. write a script that locks the screen as soon as you are logged in and set this script to be excecuted as the first thing after login.\n", "Q: Shutting down running apps in iOS I often have many apps running in the background. I have heard this can cause the battery to drain faster (especially location-aware apps) as well as generally slow the use of the device down.\nIs there a fast and easy way to shut down all running apps in iOS?\n\nA: You don't need to.\nSee \niOS Multitasking in Detail\nand\niOS: Understanding multitasking\nBasically, if you're using an app (you can see it on your screen) then you're app is running. When you press the home button and leave the app or switch to another app then the app is NOT running. It may be in one of a few other states (see first link) but it is not consuming any processing power or memory. There are very few situations where closing the app will save you any time or effort and it's best forgotten.\n\nA: John Gruber of the \"Daring Fireball\" blog has had a running commentary highlighting this very misconception (see http://daringfireball.net/2012/01/ios_multitasking) \nHis final word was to point to Fraser Speirs\"s excellent post “Misconceptions About iOS Multitasking”.\nPart of John Gruber's summary was; \"Bottom line: the iOS multitasking bar is not like the command tab switcher on Mac or Windows. It is not a list of currently “running” applications. It is simply a list of your most recently used applications, whether they’re running in the background, suspended in memory, or completely inactive...Emptying this list of applications is simply needless, mindless, busywork. It was absolutely never intended to be used this way and anyone who does this is just wasting their time.\"\n", "Q: Automatic iCloud backup without locking iPad When enabled, iCloud will automatically back up your iOS device when it is plugged in, connected to Wi-Fi, and locked. This is designed so it'll very conveniently back up overnight. However, I use a night stand app, and I have it set to prevent my iPad from sleeping so I can see what time it is without having to fumble around with a passcode in the middle of the night. Because of this, iCloud will never back up automatically.\nIs there any way I can get it to automatically back up without requiring my iPad to be locked? I have no wish to jailbreak it.\n\nA: Unfortunately not. According to this knowledgebase article, Apple has it set up to only automatically back up when it's connected to Wi-Fi, connected to a power source and (unfortunately for you) the screen is locked.\nYou can, however, get in the habit of doing a backup before you go to sleep, kind of like setting your alarm clock. Just a suggestion, but I think this is the only way to make it happen daily without jailbreaking (truth be told, I don't know of a way to do this even if you did jailbreak). \nGood luck.\n", "Q: Sharing files and documents across computers and devices I often have multiple documents I am working on or need to keep on hand. This includes PDF, Word, Excel, Pages, etc. Sometimes I need to work on them on my Mac Mini or sometimes on my iPhone or iPad and I definitely need to view them on my iPhone and iPad.\nWhat's the best \"cloud-based\" storage service for my situation?\n\nA: Dropbox\nWhen you put your files into your Dropbox folder, they're instantly available on any of your other computers that you've installed Dropbox on (Win, Linux, Mac).\nThere are also apps for iOS and Android available. The Dropbox app for iOS is able to display pdfs and office documents. You cannot edit them, tough.\n\n*\n\n*You get 2GB for free. 250MB for every friend you invite (8GB limit, though).

I do not want iTunes match to find the files and upload them to the cloud.\nEssentially I want to tag some files in iTunes to make them ineligible. How do I do that?\n\nA: I don't think you can do this with a single library, iTunes match will check everything in your library, under the 25,000 track limit, to try and match.\nOne possible alternative would be a separate iTunes library for the files you don't want to match.\nThis separate library could also contain the actual files that have been matched by the other library as well but not be enabled for iTunes match itself.\nYou could then use this 'super' library as the main one running the iTunes match library occasionally just to keep iTunes match up to date.\nHow to run multiple libraries\n", "Q: Mobile Safari with thumbnail view with iOS 5 Can I get my Mobile Safari thumbnail view back after I upgraded to iOS 5?\n\nA: Sorry no, unless you jailbreak and install GridTabs\nBasically, the grid view was replaced by the new tabs in Mobile Safari in iOS 5\n", "Q: Recharging iOS devices What's the current advice on recharging my iOS devices?\nI try to maximize the long-term lifespan of the battery by only recharging to 100% and promptly disconnecting from the power, but I know many people who leave their devices docked and charging until they walk out the door. I also try to run down to zero/empty periodically. What's the best practice here? I've read Apple's suggestions too but wonder what others have found.\n\nA: I am not an engineer [IANAE?], but I have been impressed by the advice of Steve Gibson, www.grc.com, a security researcher who has produced more than 300 consecutive weekly shows for his podcast, \"Security Now.\"  \nHis advice is charge lithium ion batteries early and often.  \nTwo weeks ago he stated it thusly:\n\nSTEVE:  Yes.  Now, the universal agreement is that, unlike prior technologies, prior chemistries, both nickel-cadmium and then nickel-metal hydride, which was actually the same fundamental electrochemistry, those had a memory effect.  So if you only discharged them a little bit and recharged them often, they would forget that there was, like, a lot more room down below the point that you were normally starting the recharge.  So the logic there was run them all the way down to the ground before you recharge them.  And if you can't, then you could reset their memory by deliberately doing some deep cycles.\nLithium-ion, completely different story.  It has no memory.  And it actually is better for the chemistry not to be running it all the way down.  So there the logic is charge often.  And if you are in a situation where, for example, you have access to a plug, and you've got your adapter, always use the adapter when you can.  \n\nI took this quotation from the transcript of episode 334, available here, on grc.com.\nI hope he's right.\n\nA: I find best to do as you have said above as often as you can, in that you fully charge and fully drain. \nI try to do this where possible and it has worked well it seems with my iPhone 3G I bought in January 2009 which still holds a good few hours of charge.\n", "Q: Printing from iOS devices to existing printer connected to windows pc? I am aware of AirPrint activator as a great solution for printing from iOS devices using a Mac on the network.

For those who don't know, iOS 4.2.1 comes with a unique feature called AirPrint which allows you to print your documents, emails, web-pages and photos over a Wifi connection with your Apple iOS device.\nPrerequisites:\nDownload and install iTunes 10.1 from here\nMake sure the printer is setup as a shared printer on your local PC\nPrinter and iOS device should share the same Wifi connection\nMake sure you have full administrator privileges to enable / disable services on your PC\nProcedure:\nDownload AirPrint installer for Windows from here. Once downloaded, right-click on setup.exe and choose Run as administrator from the pop-up menu.\nJust follow the on-screen instructions to install AirPrint service on Windows:\nOnce installation completes, Windows Firewall will prompt you allow or deny AirPrint features to be shared over networks. Click on Allow access button.\nPlease note that only HP ePrint enabled Photosmart, Officejet and Laserjet printers currently supports Apple's AirPrint service. You don't need any additional network setup if you are using one of these printers and can print any media directly from your iOS 4.2.1 AirPrint enabled iDevice.\n\nA: I haven't used this software personally but the comments left by users suggest that this works very well and does what you need it to do:\nhttp://jaxov.com/2010/11/how-to-enable-airprint-service-on-windows/\n\nA: FingerPrint (OS X & Windows) is a paid application that enables a printer connected to your Mac or PC to become an AirPrint printer. It is a paid application.\n\nThere is also a free program specifically for Windows. You can download the files here. One they are downloaded, unzip the zip file and run the AirPrint_Installer.exe Then run either AirPrint iOS 5 FIX - 32Bit.reg or AirPrint iOS 5 FIX - 64Bit.reg depending on if you are running a 32 or a 64 bit version of Windows. Go back to AirPrint_Installer.exe, make sure \"Service Startup\" is set to \"Auto\" and click \"Start\". Reboot your computer. All these instructions and troubleshooting instructions can be found in the links above.\n", "Q: Mail.app won't recognize a contact's name from my Address Book I use Mac OS X Mail and have all of my work contacts in Address Book. When I receive email from one contact, the \"From\" field just displays his email address (as opposed to his first and last name) even though I have a contact card for him in my address book. For all other contacts, Mail displays their first and last names appropriately.\nWhat's really weird is that if I hover over his address in the \"From\" field and click to bring up the context menu, there is an option for \"Add to Address Book\" (as if he doesn't have an entry), whereas for other contacts the option is \"Open in Address Book.\" If I click \"Add to Address Book,\" a new contact card is created for him even though I already have one with the same email address set up!\nI've tried both assigning a first/last name to the duplicated card as well as merging the duplicated card with the original. In both cases, Mail \"forgets\" that the card exists and treats his email address as a new contact.\nHow do I get Mail to realize that there is, in fact, a contact card with his address?\n\nA: Choose the Window > Previous Recipients menu item in Mail, and see if the email address is listed there without a first and last name. If so, try adding the email address to Address Book and merging the new entry with the existing one. In Address Book, one method of merging contacts is to select both entries and choose the Card > Merge menu item.\n\nA: If I got it right, you are having troubles with ONE certain e-mail address. Just searching for possible reason - have you tried to 'Add to Address Book' and then assign some different name/last name? Just for test? Will mail recognize it then?\nThen, did you check if Address Book actually keeps this particular contact in the account which you set as default (check General Tab in Preferences in Address Book)? Perhaps it saves it in some network service? Like Exchange server? Is this default account actually enabled?\nIf everything is in order then we'll search further :)\nUPDATE on Dec 15, 2014\nLooks like I had similar situation just now :) What I did: I right clicked on the address and chosed 'Edit Address' and right in the field entered first and last names. After that I have removed old record from Previous Recepients list.\n\nA: You can try to delete the contact entirely from your Address book, and add him again from mail.app, via  \"Add to address book\". Anyway, you need to add a first/last name, if one is not already set in the email header. \n", "Q: Is there a way to use video files from other sources on iMovie on iPad/iPhone? I have been given an assignment to create a video in school and I would just like to know if and how you go about getting movies not recorded on the iDevice into the camera roll and then into iMovie. I have tried everything I can think of but I am stumped.\n\nA: This is a total guess, but when you get photos in emails and on the web in safari, you can save them and they appear in your camera roll.\nCould the same trick be used to save movies?\n", "Q: What is AppleMobileDevice - System user - in Task manager? In Windows Task Manager - what is AppleMobileDevice, system user? It is running 55% or more and makes the cpu usage at 55-100%\n\nA: AppleMobileDevice is a service that gets installed along with iTunes on Windows.  You need this if you're going to use any Apple devices with your iTunes software.  One example is managing your iPhone, iPad, or iPod.  It also allows for the use of tethering internet from your iPhone/iPad to your PC if your device/provider allows it and the personal hotspot feature has been turned on.\nAs for why it's taking up so much CPU, that sounds like it could be a problem, for which the answer provided by bneely may have a solution.  If you don't have any Apple devices connected, you could just kill that process and it won't affect anything else.  In order to use your Apple devices normally later on, you would need to re-launch that service somehow, or restart the PC.\n\nA: I found an Apple discussion thread about this issue:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3233271?start=0&tstart=0\nThe thread suggests that the problem was introduced by an iTunes update. The suggested fix is uninstalling and reinstalling iTunes, following a specific set of steps. Here's the link from Apple with the uninstallation/reinstallation steps:\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT1925?viewlocale=en_US\nI do not have Windows, and I have not verified the problem or the solution.\n", "Q: Are there any keyboard shortcut prompt applications? I've been dealing with repetitive stress injury in my mousing hand for many years.  Each time it's flared up, I've managed to find something to delay the inevitable (e.g., switching from traditional mice to trackballs).  It's flaring up again and it's clearly being aggravated by any pointing device.  I've even tried using pointing devices for my non-dominant hand and even those hurt after a short period of time.  While I'd love to go completely pointerless, that's not really a practical option.  I've tried KeyCue, but end up not using it because it takes so long to find the right shortcut for a given situation.  \nSo, I'm looking for software that will let me use a pointer device, but when I try to do something with it that has a corresponding keyboard shortcut, I'm shown that particular shortcut.  An option to prompt (e.g., a short delay between a pointer click and the action being completed so that I can use the keyboard shortcut or just wait for the action) and an option to require the keyboard shortcut (e.g., it shows me the keyboard shortcut and won't complete the action based just on the pointer click).  For example, when I click the x on a tab in my browser I would be given a Growl pop-up to the effect:\nClose Tab\n⌘W\n\nSomething like this would help me learn the keyboard shortcuts while minimizing the impact to my current workflow.  Does anybody know of any applications that do this or could easily support this type of user prompting?\n\nA: While this is not a solution you're asking for, you can try adding shortcut in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Application Shortcuts for menu item 'Show Help Menu' (I'm not sure if it's enabled by default).\nThen after pressing this shortcut you can type command name and help system will search for that in menu. I guess names of actions fairly often - Close Tab is quite easy to guess, as you just need to start typing 'Close'.\nI hope this will help.\n", "Q: Add an iPhone number to other iOS devices to receive iMessages/Facetime calls via the phone number? I bought an iPad for school and have been enjoying using iMessage and (especially) FaceTime, and I have recently acquired the new iPhone. So I'm wondering if there is a way I could add my iPhone's number to my iPad to receive iMessages and take FaceTime calls sent to that number, rather than having to rely on my phone 24/7 for these features. \n\nA: No,\niMessage and FaceTime are linked to your Apple ID so you will need to add your Apple ID to the device, not your phone number.\nIf you send a message from the iPad it will use the Apple ID, so someone can reply to your email address, if they send a message to your phone number it will only go to your phone.\n", "Q: iPod Touch will charge but won't play when connected to a Sony docking system I bought a Sony ICF-CS15iP docking system and my iPod will charge when I connect it, but it will not play music through the speakers. This is my 3rd docking system and I have had the same problem with the others - it will charge but not play.  I'm assuming it is my iPod that has something wrong with it. Should I call Sony and or Apple?? Thanks!\nNote* I have a 4th gen iPod Touch\n\nA: I found a product description on the Best Buy website: \n\nThe ICF-CS15IP is Compatible with most iPod® and iPhone® models, including iPhone 4. Works with: iPod touch® 2nd, 3rd, & 4th generations, iPod nano® 3rd (video), 4th (video), 5th (video camera), & 6th generations, iPod classic®, iPhone® 4, iPhone 3GS, and iPhone 3G.\n\nYour 4th generation iPod Touch is listed as supported by this device, so you should contact Sony and expect them to help you.\n\nA: Just bought the sony ipod docking station for my daughter for Christmas.  Her IPOD Touch 4th generation will charge, but the music will not come out of the docking speakers.  My son has an older IPOD Touch and it worked fine.  I called Sony and they told me I had to reinstall the operating system on the IPOD touch 4th generation for it to work.  I went through the hassel of resetting back to factory settings.  Still did not work.\n\nA: The easiest way to test a docking station for operation is to test several iPhone / iPod that you know work with other dock connectors and see that they all work with your dock speakers.\nThe easiest way to test an iPod is to use it with several dock chargers and speakers.\nOnce you have done one of these tests it should be easy to know which piece isn't working reliably. Both Sony and Apple should be able to support you in these basic activities and once you know which item isn't working.\nAlso look for Apple's MFi logo to indicate that the device is designed to work with all Apple products as an indication that you won't need any extra apps or connectors to make things work. Lastly, peek into the physical connectors to be sure that lint or other problems are not lurking and making the electrical connection unreliable or impossible to be completed.\n\nA: My iPod Touch 4th Gen also doesn't work with this Sony model.  It does work with my similar, older Sony clock radio dock station though.  I downloaded the d-sappli app but that didn't help.  Going to return the Sony tomorrow.  \n\nA: There is an app you have to download to make it play. It popped up when I put it on there the very first time, and I accidentally hit ignore. Need info.\n", "Q: How do I change the locked screen wallpaper on iPhone 4S? I'm trying to use a custom wallpaper as a lock-screen wallpaper on the iPhone. Can I do that without jail breaking the phone?\n\nA: Yeah you sure can! Find the picture in the Photos app, press the menu button in the bottom left corner and press Use as Wallpaper.\n\nA: You can also use the stock wallpapers if you go to settings> wallpaper.\nAnother tip: You can take a screenshot by pressing the  home button and lock button at the same time. This will save a photo of what is currently on your screen to your camera roll.  which you could use as a wallpaper just like a photo\n", "Q: Finding the Holy Grail of PIM. (Was: is there a good replacement for AddressBook Lion?) The Address Book application in OS X Lion is sorely lacking in its ability to sync & combine contacts from different sources. Does anyone know of a good replacement?\nUpdate - My Holy Grail:  \n\n\n*\n\n*I use a personal Gmail account and a work Google Apps account.  \n\n*I'd like to have the same info available on my iPhone, iPad, work Mac, home Mac, and Google via a browser.  \n\n*While I'm at it, let's throw in connecting to my contacts in Twitter and Facebook, though those are much lower priority.\n\n*I'd like a local copy of all the info in case the cloud isn't available.\n\n*iCloud syncing isn't really a priority, since I use Google for that, but I could see switching what I can if things would work better. \n\n*Ideally, groups would be sync-able, in addition to contacts, but I don't think google exposes that via their APIs yet.\n\n\nCurrently, I'm seeing a lot of duplicates, or near duplicates in both iCal & AddressBook, and it's very difficult (impossible?) to see where a given contact or appointment is coming from. In the past I used Spanning Sync to keep google and the local in sync. Perhaps that + iCloud is where the dupes are coming from.\nUpdate 2: My current set-up is working fairly well on the iOS devices w/ Exchange connections to google. It's the macs where I find myself tempted to abandon the desktop apps for doing everything in the browser.\n\nA: You could have a look at Cobook. I've just started using it and it seems like it unifies things pretty well. It uses the default OS X address book as a backing so that everything syncs nicely to your iPhone. It will also pull in data from your social networks so there's your added functionality.\n\nA: Have you looked at this list of PIM software on Wikipedia?\n", "Q: Syncing with multi Mac household Our household has several iOS devices, a soon-to-be-upgraded MacBook and a new Mac Mini Server. Since we're not working with many users (yet), I'd like to get things organized and working before time becomes an issue. The Mini has a local-only account that has the master iPhoto and iTunes libraries (for sharing with Apple TV's, iPhones, iPads, etc) - with iTunes I have a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Everyone shares the same iTunes library\n\n*Master library is shared, users have their own smaller libraries\n\n*Master library is shared using home sharing, users have their own smaller libraries\n\n\nThe other accounts are networked (with portable home directories). Since mobile accounts will be in the near future, I'd like to avoid number 1 (and I need some sort of sharing to serve to Apple TV's, iPhones, iPads, etc anyway). Number 3 could be an issue since home sharing is limited to 5 devices, and I'd like a solution that could handle around 10. This brings me to three questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can home sharing work with iPhones/iPads that are connected through a VPN to the Mini Server?\n\n*Is there an elegant way to update the master library whenever a user adds content to their own iTunes library?\n\n*Does anyone with a similar setup have any tips?\n\n\nA: Have you considered iTunes Match for music & iCloud Photo Stream for the photos?\nThere is a total of 4 people in our family and between us we have 5 iOS devices, an Apple TV, a few laptops and an iMac. The iMac is setup as our main digital hub. It contains our master iTunes and iPhoto libraries. Here is our setup:\nMusic Setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*We have one Apple ID that all iTunes & App Store purchases are made from.\n\n*The iMac contains a local copy of all our music and is set to sync with iTunes Match.\n\n*All other devices* (OS X and iOS) have iTunes Match turned and do not have local copies of the music files (this has cleared up over 40 GBs form my Air!).\n\n*All devices have access to all the songs and can play them either by streaming or by downloading from the cloud and playing them locally.\n\n*Any added music syncs back up with iTunes Match and is available from all devices (this also works for correcting meta tags).\n\n\n*One exception is our kids' iOS devices, we have iTunes Match turned off on them and sync songs via direct connection to the iMac and manually selecting the songs via a playlist as we don't necessarily want them to be able to listen to all our music. This also makes it simpler for them to find what they want to listen to (they're 6 and 3 years old).\nPhoto Setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*iMac contains our main photo library and has Photo Stream turned on.\n\n*All other devices** (OS X and iOS) have their own photo library and have Photo Stream turned on.\n\n*The iMac automatically downloads all photos taken from all devices with Photo Stream turned on.\n\n*All devices have access to all photos that are in the Photo Stream and can add to their libraries if desired (this can also be an issue, as all will see everyone's photos).\n\n\n** One exception here is that I use a different iCloud account from the others as I use my devices for work and therefore keep a separate photo library. All my devices sync to my iCloud account. When I do take family photos on my devices I need to manually add them to the family iMac.\n\nA: I have a similar setup - 5 iPhones, a couple of computers, iPad, etc.\nI have the masters on my Pro - it's always on and powerful enough to keep iTunes and iPhoto running in the background.\nEach user has their own iCloud account for email, calendars, etc.\nWe share a single family AppleID for purchases - this is setup on each device for Music, Videos, and AppStore.\nGiven that all music, videos etc are bought using the same ID, when they're bought on a device they sync into iTunes on the central library Mac automatically. Each device can optionally turn on downloads of purchased items from other devices. That's a per device setting.\nEach user controls their own iPhotos - this isn't a problem for the kids. Between my wife and I, put our own photos into our own iPhoto libraries. Both are shared, and we can drag and drop between them as needed within iPhoto. This doesn't sync automatically, but it's easy to tell on the event level what needs updating.\nHome Sharing allows all devices to play whatever music and videos within the houses' wifi network, including on the AppleTVs. HomeSharing also (at least used to) allow for automatic syncing between devices to keep everything on one account, if added outside of the store. With laptops for the kids, they can keep their own smaller libraries and stream via HomeSharing in the house, and copy to their own accounts to store stuff for outside the house.\nOutside the house because we're using the single account, everyone can play any music via iTunes Match. With the latest Apple update, this now includes movies and TV shows bought through iTMS.\n", "Q: Device Management from WAN with no VPN We're setting up about a dozen mac mini's across the city that need to be managed from a central lion-server.\nOur IT department is willing to open up some ports and forward them to our lion server but they are not willing to give us VPN access.\nWhat ports do I need to forward to the mini server in order to manage the devices?\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm thinking mostly of when I update a profile and need it to be pushed out to the other devices.  \n\n*I also need each device to be able to authenticate via Open Directory when the machine is remote. Of course I'll setup \"mobility\" but I still need the machines to sync changes like new passwords when they \"can\" connect.  \n\n*Lastly, I'd like to be able to connect FROM the server TO each Mac mini via Apple remote-desktop. (The machines will not have static IP addresses on their side.)\n\n\nA: Looking at the apple support page, I've discovered that \n\n\n*\n\n*Open Directory runs on port 625.\n\n*Password server runs on port 106.\n\n*Profile Manager runs on port 1640 & 2195.\n\n*Remote Desktop runs on port 3283.\n\n*Push Notifications run on port 2196.\n\n*Simple Authentication runs on port 3659.\n\n*Bonjour runs on port 5353.\n\n*Software update service runs on port 8088.\n\n*Netboot runs on ports 67 & 68.\n\n", "Q: Make my iCloud @me.com email my primary Apple ID Before iCloud began operation I used a gmail email for my Apple ID. With the advent of iCloud I have begun using my iCloud email for everything. The one thing that frustrates me is that Apple does not allow me to change my Apple ID to be my @me.com address.\nThe Apple ID page suggests making my @me.com address my ID, but every time I click it, it is not allowed. If I try to force it to change I get the message: \"You cannot create an Apple ID using a MobileMe account. If this is your email address, it is also your Apple ID.\" This is obviously a remnant of MobileMe. Is there any way to fix this?\n\nA: Have you added the @me address to your existing apple Id?\nYou should then be able to verify the address and set as primary address\nOnce it's added, you should jut be able to use it as your Apple id login\nEdit: it seems the My Apple Id page has changed recently, you can no longer set an email address as a primary email address and as your AppleID.\nApple Knowledge Base article from October 2011 shows hows to do this but this ability is not present in the current live My Apple ID page.\nIt is still the case however that @me.com email addresses are valid aliases for your AppleId and you can log in to any service with one instead of your primary.\n", "Q: iOS: Is there a limit in the number of applications I can leave \"running background\" in the bar? I know applications don't actually run in background but I was wondering how many applications I can leave open. Has anybody tried? Is there a limit? What is it? If you reach a limit, it starts closing applications by itself to make room for new ones?\n\nA: Fraser Spiers recently did an excellent article and follow-up video on this question on his blog.\nIn short, to paraphrase: you don't \"leave apps open\". By pressing the Home button, you signal them to enter the Background state, from where, depending on how they're written, they are either immediately moved to the Suspended (not-running) state, or are Suspended after completing a certain amount of background processing (such as completing a download).\nAs Fraser explains, there is no need to manage the number of apps in the 'multitasking tray' except in the case where a specific app stops working and needs to be forcibly restarted.\nIndeed, that tray is merely a \"recently running\" list; there's no way to know at a glance which of those apps have been Suspended and which have not.\n\nA: I work in IT and have seen over 40 opened at a time on multiple devices - most people don't even know you can close Apps. I haven't seen or read of any finite amount anywhere. I've read the article mentioned and watched the video; but, from my experience, there is unquestionably an impact on having too many open. Now, perhaps it just depends on the Apps that are open, but I think for most people, the easiest solution to lagging or performance issues is to restart the device; and if that doesn't work, manually close each App.\n\nA: Well, as of iOS 14.6, it allows at least 198 apps to be listed at a time.\n", "Q: How can I hide sensitive photos My problem is I've got heaps of photos that I don't want to be found in finder is their any easy way to stop finder from showing them in places like All Files or quicklook.\n\nA: There are many ways to achieve this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Exclude such folders in the Spotlight search. Any one else using the Mac can easily find and go through the content.\n\n*Create a new Disk Image (preferably encrypt it) in Disk Utility and it is a separate disk which grows and shrinks based on the contents. You could also use apps like Knox to achieve the same.\n\n*Try apps like Skedaddle to hide from Finder. Skedaddle protects the files with a password and Spotlight cannot find it. It does not encrypt the data.\n\n\nA: Create a hidden folder and put your private files (not only pictures) there.\nThey won't show up in spotlight or a finder search (basically both are the same)\nTo make a hidden folder, open the terminal app and type:\nmkdir /.private \nThis will create a folder named .private in the root of your Hard drive.\nThen you can only access this in finder by pressing shiftcommandG and entering /.private.  \nOf course you can name the folder anything you want and put it anywhere, but it has to start with a dot to be hidden, and you have to remember where you put it.  \n", "Q: Emoticons built in to the iPhone keyboard?

Once it's selected, your Keyboards page should look a little like this:\nStep 2: How to access and ^_^ symbols\nNow open up a typing screen (we're using SMS in this example). You'll notice a globe has appeared between the '123' button and the spacebar, this button switches between international keyboards.\nMake sure that you are in the text window (rather than the number window shown in the screenshot, and press our new globe button.  You'll find yourself on a japansese page (press it again to go back).   Should look like the screenshot below\nOf interest here is the '^_^' button on the bottom row.

You should find yourself on a numbers page. Looks like this:\nYou're now going to press and hold the '1' key.  You'll see a star appear to the left: slide over and press it, if you want a star, you're done.

I sometimes use a BlueTooth keyboard with my iPhone, which is lovely for writing emails, but I run into difficulties when using terminal on the iPhone - I like to edit files with vi(m), which requires quite a lot of presses of the escape key, but every time I press escape, the iPhone interprets that as a request to go back to the home screen and sends me out of the app.\nAny ideas? \n\nA: Terminal hasn't been updated for nearly a year now, so unfortunately there are some imperfections as things change in iOS. \nBut for this case, though, I believe the escape key is actually controlled by SpringBoard, not any apps, which means Terminal can't capture and send the escape key to the command-line program. \nThe iPhone Wiki article on Terminal has information on keyboard shortcuts, and it says that the key shortcut for escape is Ctrl + [ (• + [ on the virtual keyboard).\nHowever, if my assumptions above are correct, the only way to use the real escape key would be to write a tweak to redirect the escape command to Terminal. \n", "Q: Setting a static route every boot with launchd / plist is failing I hope to use launchd to set a static route on a server at boot time since I haven't figured a better way to configure this sort of networking on a server.\nMy problem is that the command seems to be running before the network stack is set up, so I'm looking for advice how to change my plist to somehow depend on the system routing being set up before it runs.\n\nJan 16 14:39:45 server com.company.route.legacy_printer[149]: route: writing to routing socket: Network is unreachable\nJan 16 14:39:45 server com.company.route.legacy_printer[149]: add net 10.1.1.1: gateway 10.0.1.2: Network is unreachable\n\nI get this error after a reboot, but loading the same plist as root once the mac has booted works just fine so I'm hoping it's an easy tweak or someone clueing me into a better way to get a static route reliably after each boot.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>com.company.route.legacy_printer</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/sbin/route</string>\n        <string>-n</string>\n        <string>add</string>\n        <string>-net</string>\n        <string>10.1.1.1</string>\n        <string>10.0.1.2</string>\n        <string>255.255.255.0</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>KeepAlive</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>AbandonProcessGroup</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nI have reviewed both Running a command whenever Mac boots up with launchctl/plist and How can I run/stop/relaunch an application automatically, at boot/login/some other time? to get this far, but need an extra nudge on finding the correct dependency to get the timing right for the route command.\n\nA: A short call to scutil should help with testing whether the network is up for a specific interface on IPv4 which should suffice to determine when you can add an IPv4 route. The following command will return a 0 if the first ethernet connection has a viable IPv4 address within the default 15 second timeout period.\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/sbin/scutil -w State:/Network/Interface/en0/IPv4\nYou could instead call a script to do the testing and routing - perhaps using the -t command to adjust the timeout if needed. I don't know a way to overload the launchd arguments to have everything contained, but it should be fine to have launchd kick off a script on the local filesystem to accomplish this task. Use care if you are not using en0 for your IPv4 or wish to have routing on other than the default networking interface.\nThat script can then check for errors, perhaps check for other interfaces as well as log success and failure using the logger command.\n", "Q: Stop VPN Disconnecting when going to Sleep When the iPhone (4) goes to sleep, the VPN will disconnect.\nIs there any way to disable this behavior as it's sometimes a bit annoying.\nI am jailbroken, and the server I'm connecting to is Windows Server 2008 R2 which I can edit settings on.\n\nA: The VPN will disconnect because your WiFi disconnects.\nTherefore you would have to...\n\n\n*\n\n*either reconnect your VPN connection when on 3G (How?)\n\n*or enable your iPhone to keep connected to WiFi (requires jailbreak)\n\n\nTo keep WiFi on in sleep mode you need to install KeepAwake via Cydia.\nSee this step-by-step guide.\n\nA: I would expect that sleeping an iPhone and staying connected to the network are incompatible goals.

In other words, how can two users send or post to other users a Reminder?\n\nA: The other user (@Paul) is incorrect! Create a list that you want to share using your iCloud account. On your Mac, click \"Reminders\" to the side of the calendar view in iCal. Right-click on the calendar you want to share, then click \"Share Reminder List...\" On the menu that appears, select \"Only the people you invite\" and click Ok.\nEasy and effective!\n\nA: This is not possible. You will have to have to be logged into the same iCloud account on both devices for it to work.\n", "Q: Backup Spanning Multiple DVD-Rs Is there anything built into OS X Lion that allows you to have a backup that spans multiple disks?\nI've got about 80GB of files pulled down from our web servers that I'd like to get put on DVD-Rs, and would rather not have to manually fit dirs ontop the discs.\nAnything built into OS X or freeware to do this?\n\nA: No there is nothing built in\nRoxio Toast has a data disc spanning feature, for large files it will split to fit, or you can opt not to split files for easier recovery.\nAnother solution would be to use an archiving (read:compression) utility that will allow you to compress to multiple archives of a fixed size, say 4.7Gb, the down side of which is that you will lose everything if one disc is unreadable\n", "Q: How can I repeat my ringtone and increase the delay until a caller is sent to voicemail? I have a custom ringtone (30 seconds in length), but it goes to voicemail after approximately 20 seconds. Can I repeat the ringtone multiple times before redirecting the caller to voicemail?\n\nA: You need to talk to your phone service provider.  They can set the \"delay before divert to voicemail\", or provide you with a magic number to dial so you can set the delay.\nI know my provider only allows a maximum of 25 seconds, which I agree is too short.\n", "Q: iCloud causing phone to crash whilst making a call I have an iPhone 3GS, and I recently installed iOS 5 and set up iCloud. However, since then my phone crashes when I make a phone call (after about 2-3 minutes). I tried deleting my iCloud account to see if this rectified the problem but I lost all my contacts. Can anyone suggest any way to resolve this problem?\n\nA: Those problems were reported by multiple owners. Apple claims to have solved those failing phone calls with the current iOS 5.1 update. Have you updated yet?\n\nA: I would venture to guess that this issue in fact has little to nothing to do with iCloud and more to do with your upgrade to iOS 5.  As Paul mentioned, iOS 5 is a little slow on a 3GS, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you're out of the iOS 5 game just yet.  I'll assume that you've tried the basic steps of power cycling the phone and resetting the phone (press and hold the sleep/wake button and the home button simultaneously until you see the apple logo) and are ready to move on from there.\nThe first step is to re-install iOS 5.  In iTunes, sync and back up your phone and then hit the Restore Button on the iPhone Summery page.  You can then restore from the back up you just made.  Once your device is back up and running, give her a whirl and see if the crashing has stopped.\nIf your phone app is still crashing after a restore, it's possible that it's due to corrupt information stored somewhere in your backup.  If this is the case, you'll need to try restoring your phone again, but this time setting it up as a new device instead of restoring from your backup.  This will frequently clear up stubborn issues.  Be aware, while all of your media, calendars, contacts, apps and such will be recoverable from your computer and/or from the cloud, you will loose your camera roll (if it's not synced to your computer) as well as call logs, SMS history and any 3rd party app data that doesn't have it's own syncing mechanism.  If any of this data is important to you, I suggest looking into an app such as iExplorer or PhoneView to save this information before hand.\n", "Q: Are there games that sync across devices through iCloud / Game Center? With iOS 5 and iCloud i was hoping that games would get synced across devices. If I'm playing a game on my iPad and then later pick up the same game on my iPhone, then i would like to be able to start right where i left off on my other device. Are there any games that currently do this? Or is this even currently possible?\n\nA: Starbase Orion was one of the first ones out that synced all local games through iCloud. There are of course many, many others, so the answer is Yes - this exist by design and developers can make use of it as long as their data fits within the storage requirements of iCloud.\n\nA: Pocket Planes does this very well, and Doodle Jump does, but that's mostly for scores and settings, not the game itself.\n\nA: Scribblenaughts Remix does this, I have played on iPad where I left off on iPhone\n", "Q: how to prevent ios from updating apps to incompatible versions How can you prevent ios from updating apps to newer versions which are incompatible with the version of ios running on the device?\nI have an iPhone 3Gs running ios 4.3.5. Some apps that show updates available, do not work with this version of ios. I accidentally updated Stanza and it stopped working. I had to find an older version of Stanza in my Time Machine backup and reinstall it on my iPhone.\nMy iPhone 3Gs has limited battery life, so I don't want to impact is further by updating to ios 5. I would buy a new iPhone, but 3 year contracts are standard in Canada, so it would cost too much to upgrade my phone.\n\nA: Sadly, the developer is the one who will have to fix this, and you cannot do anything without jail breaking it and (if you know code) making changes to the firmware.\nHowever, read the release notes and take care to make sure it works on iOS 4. Usually the developer will put something in it about compatibility.\n\nA: Apple has fixed this problem systematically in September 2013 by letting developers maintain older versions of their applications on the iTunes store to support OS that are older than the current version.\nWhen you go to update an app and the store detects that your OS isn't the required OS and there is also an older version, you will see an alert and be able to select the older app for your older OS.\nWorst case, you can review your past purchases and find download links if you haven't hidden that download. Even then, you can go to your account and un-hide any hidden purchases.\n", "Q: How to get wiki and profile manager to run on different port Currently the wiki and the profile manager runs on port 443 (ssl).\nWe have other services using port 443 on our network, and therefore I cannot port forward that port to my Lion Server.\nHow can I get the wiki and the profile manager to run on a port other than port 443?\n\nA: So I decided to research \"Apache\" without specifying \"OS X\" in my research.\nI found that you can change the listen port in a conf file\n$ mdfind httpd-ssl.conf\n\n    # Found\n    # /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-ssl.conf\n\n$ cd /private/etc/apache2.extra\n$ sudo nano httpd-ssl.conf\n\n    # ctrl + w\n    # 443\n\n    # Change Listen 443 to Listen 4444\n    # ctrl + o\n    # ctrl + x\n\nnote: enabling root would allow you to listen on port 444\n\nA: This is only possible in Snow Leopard server and not Lion Server (I think).\n", "Q: What is the quickest way to get to the Phone app's favorites list? I can no longer double-tap the home button to get to the iPhone's Phone apps' favorites list.\nI'm looking for an alternative method to quickly access the favorites list, possibly using gestures?\n\nA: The other answer (@Paul) seems confusing, but I somewhat get what he is saying. Basically, closing the Phone app after selecting the Favorites tab at the bottom of the screen, and then re-opening the app will return you to the Favorites tab.\n\nA: It's still there. Just open the Phone app, leave it, open, and then double-tap the home button the open the phone app.\n\nA: If you jailbreak your phone, you can download Activator and create a triple-click action to show your favorites.\n\nA: It's probably a little off topic, however, you could have a look at my app phonetrait. This app tries to make it easier and faster to place calls.\nThe apps shows your contacts ordered by how often and how recently they are called, which creates an dynamic 'favorites' list.\n", "Q: Share contact group My wife and I have shared calendar groups and reminders lists (both requires using icloud.com website) for things like travel, parties, and grocery list.\nI would love to do the same with contact group, but can't figure out how.\nAs a workaround, we are using a shared iCloud account for (1) sharing contact groups, (2) Find My iPhone, and (3) app/music/video/book purchases.\n\nA: If you have a Mac, open Address Book, select a group of contacts, and then click on the Export button in the menubar. Then export it as a vCard, and email it to anyone you want.\n", "Q: Looking for iCloud note-taking app I am looking for a note taking app with white text on a black background that works with iCloud. Apps for Mac and/or iOS will work. Any recommendation?\n\nA: You should expand your requirement to iCloud and Dropbox for following reasons.\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud is sandboxed to only certain apps. In other words, any notes an app X creates cannot be read and modified by app Y. Dropbox allows any apps that supports Dropbox to access your notes. You may like app X now but you may want app Y later.\n\n*iCloud syncing can be useful if you have multiple iOS devices, for things like settings and miscellaneous data (e.g., scratchpad).\nI have tried over a dozen note taking apps that syncs over the cloud. The app that I keep going back to is Elements (http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/elements/). It has very clean yet functional UI and frigging fast.\nI do have few wish list items though: (1) tagging and/or support for moving notes to different folder, (2) hide certain Dropbox folders (I linked to the root folder), (3) default font setting (Museo Sans is very pleasant but may not be for everyone), and (4) Markdown keyboard (it fully supports Markdown but I don't remember all the syntax).\n\nA: There's actually a very beautiful app called iA Writer that has a focus typing mode. Though normally supposed to be used for actual full-blown blogs and such, there's no reason you couldn't go and use it for notes.\nThis is the description of the iCloud feature from http://iawriter.com:\n\nYour Documents on all Your Devices\niA Writer comes with iCloud and Dropbox integration. Instantly, any text you write anywhere will be updated on all your devices.\n\niA Writer for Mac can be downloaded here.\n", "Q: Why does my iPhone display no contacts, but display the correct name when I dial a number? I recently updated to iOS 5 (I know it took me forever), and after I did, all my contacts disappeared. However, when I would dial a number, it recognized it and would show the person's name. It stayed like that for a few hours, and then miraculously my contacts reappeared after I turned the phone off and on a few times. How did that happen?\n\nA: I had the same problem. Contacts were showing up, for example, if someone called me or sent me a text and were therefore in my 'Recents', but did not show up in my contacts list either through the contacts app or through the phone contacts list itself (probably the same thing anyway!).\nThe solution that worked for me was to go into iCloud on my iPhone and set Contacts to 'off'.  This gave me the option to 'Keep on my iPhone' or 'Delete from My iPhone'. I chose to delete them. Once this had happened, I re-enabled Contacts and my contacts list was all synchronised back from iCloud correctly within a couple of minutes.\n\nA: Since you don't have the problem anymore, it will be pretty hard to diagnose if we can't reproduce the issue.\nMy guess would be that you had your contacts sync with Google over Exchange and when you upgraded to iOS and iCloud, the contacts where moved from Google to iCloud. \nBut it wasn't instantaneous (iCloud was sometimes slow after launch), so your contacts were no longer on Google and still not on iCloud (they probably wait until the upload process is finished to show them on the Contacts app).\nThat could be why your contacts list was empty (still not uploaded), but when you typed the number, iOS knew the name (the contacts where still on the iPhone, waiting for the upload to complete) and printed it.\n\nAnother theory could be that Exchange has 2 contacts \"states\". The contacts on your address book (that are always on your phone) and the one you can find by searching on the server (from the Contacts app).\nAnd when you typed the number, iOS searched on the server to see if it got a match and printed it, since the contact exists on the server.\n\nI'm a bit less convinced about the second theory, but like I said, it'll be hard to find the real reason for this temporary upgrade glitch, now.\n\nA: Occasionally I see a similar behaviour. I believe it is a bug in iOS.\nI sync contacts with outlook tethered via iTunes. Sometimes, after adding new contacts, these do not show up in the contacts app as well as in the phonebook.\nThey however can be found in spotlight search (left from the home screen) and after some time they appear in the phone book. \n\nA: When I upgraded my iOS I had the same behavior - contacts not showing up to use but if you key in the number or have an incoming call they names are there. \nThese contacts I think were all exclusively on the phone and had mostly been carried over from a dumb phone - and I had never synched to a contact manager. To restore usage of the contacts I had to enable the iCloud syncing of contacts from a MacBook Air that had a backup of the phone up to before iOS upgrade. Before upgrading iOS, the contacts would show correctly -  almost immediately.\n\nTo me, this is really weird behavior - but I guess it kinda makes sense - if someone had say stolen the phone and installed a new iOS to key around my password protection the contacts would not be visible. It was very frustrating to think all your contacts disappeared as part of the iOS upgrade. Glad to have found this thread, not sure I would have figure this out without everyone's help.\n\nA: Make sure you're viewing \"All Contacts\" in the Contacts app. Sometimes it's easy to select an empty group as your default view. Check the left arrow in the upper left hand corner of the app.\nAlso, if you go to groups, THERE IS AN OPTION TO HIDE ALL CONTACTS at the very top of the page. If you accidentally hit that option, your contacts will be hidden. \n", "Q: ssh -A doesn't properly enable forwarding of authentication agent connection I love ssh -A, which allows me to use my local ssh key when establishing a connection from a remote server. For example, I ssh -A host1.example.com and then from there I can ssh host2.example.com (or use git) and it uses my ssh key from the original machine, which in this case should be my mac. Although this has always worked for me on Debian/Ubuntu, it doesn't work on my new mac (Lion). \nWhat am I missing here? How do I configure ssh to work correctly with -A? Do I need an ssh that is not the standard MacOS one?\n\nA: Actually, the very simple answer is that you have to run\nssh-add\n\nand then it all works. \nBasically, macOS already has the ssh-agent set up for you, but after each reboot you need to add your keys to it. ssh-add gives ssh-agent access to your keys for the current boot cycle.  You'll have to enter the password for your private key if you have created one.\n\nA: As of OS X 10.8 you need to do this once:\nsudo touch /var/db/useLS\n\nAnd add this as part of your ~/.bash_profile:\nif [ -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa ]; then\n    ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa 2>/dev/null\nfi\n\nNote: this recipe is parto of my bedouin scripts.\n\nA: The concept behind ssh -A are ssh agents. They run in the background and through the use of environment variables the agent can be located and automatically used for authentication when logging in to other machines using ssh. Have a look at the manpage of ssh-agent for more details.\nWith Mac OS X, the ssh-agent should be started on demand.\nFor more information see:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using SSH Agent With Mac OS X Leopard\n", "Q: Is there a way to change a short name in OS X I am trying change the Short Name for an account on my computer.

One of the challenges is to stop the services installed by students with CS major. Some time back they got the admin access and installed launch agents and daemons on some systems.The students have also added some plists as com.apple.myprog.run. The problem is these are not present in the launchagents directory or in the launchdaemons directory. \nSo my question is how to find the path for these daemon services.Then next step is how to stop these.  Since some of these could start again and again(based on certain flags). \n\nA: Try checking these locations:\n/Users/your username/Library/LaunchAgents/\n/Library/LaunchAgents/\n/Library/LaunchDaemons/\n/System/Library/LaunchAgents/\n/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/\n\nA: You can do a \"launchctl dumpstate\" and it will show all the loaded services and the path to the startup .plist and contents.\nYou will probably want to run it through something like less as it dumps a lot of information.\n\nA: If you want to stop the item for this boot simply issue an unload command to launchd via launchctl. For a permanent fix add a disabled key into the plist with value true or delete/move the file to a folder where launchd will not scan it automatically.\n\n\n*\n\n*launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.AppStoreUpdateAgent.plist\nThe man page for launchctl has nice documentation for controlling jobs. As for the general defeating of CS majors, you might also consider that they edited the existing apple plists to make them do something you don't expect, so it will prove to be far easier to just reinstall the OS and migrate the user data back from a backup (paying particular note to note re-install any plist files in the /System/Library, /Library space (and perhaps also audit the ~/Library of admin users). Losing admin / root against someone that knows how to change the system is basically game over and the defense (finding and disabling) the changes is very time consuming as opposed to offense (reinstalling the system from a known good source and use configuration management tools to ensure changed files are detected).\n\nA: The easiest way I've found to do this is\nsudo launchctl list | grep \"rough name of what you want to find\"\nsudo launchctl remove \"label.of.the.file\"\n\n", "Q: MacBook autofills name fields with someone else's name I have a brand new MacBook Pro.

My brother hasn't lived here in over 10 years and this computer is brand new, he has never used it or even seen it.\nWhy would my computer be populating fields with his name?\n\nA: This likely pertains to the Address Book card marked as \"me\". Launch the Address Book application (from Spotlight, Finder, Launchpad, or the Dock), create or locate your own card, and choose the Card > Make This My Card menu item.\nThis could've originally happened if you or someone else created an Address Book card for your brother and marked it as \"me\", or if you copied Address Book data from another computer belonging to your brother.\n", "Q: How to resume normal iPhone volume after notification causes volume to get stuck in lower volume mode? iPhone 4, iOS 5.0.1\nStrange problem I've had for a few months.  Sometimes when a notification causes the iPhone to temporarily lower the volume, the volume gets \"stuck in quiet mode\" and doesn't resume full volume.  As a result, music playback is approximately 25% quieter than normal.  Sometimes getting a subsequent notification is enough to kick back to full volume.\nThis is very annoying because I never know when the phone is going to ramp up the volume suddenly (if I get a text message for instance).\nWhat could I do on the phone that would force it to kick back to full volume?  Something better than asking a friend to text me, or setting a 1 minute alarm, etc.\n\nA: Yes, I too have had this problem many times. (I have been told it is a known bug in iOS having to do with playing MP3 files that are shorter than two second.) The easiest way to get your phone back to normal volume is to pause the music (or audio/video, as the case may be) and then resume it. The volume should be back to normal after that.\n\nA: Probably the easiest thing to try is just update the operating system on your iPhone 4 to 5.1.1. Perhaps Apple included a bug fix in one of the updates.\nIf you're already up to date (and accidentally typed 5.0.1) then I would try Reset All Settings.\nOpen Settings -> General -> Reset -> Reset All Settings.\nThis will set any customized settings (preferences) to their defaults (and require you to re-enter wi-fi passwords) but does not delete any content from the phone. \nIf that doesn't do the trick you should try a Restore through iTunes or the Erase All Contents and Settings in the same screen previously described.

I transcoded a bunch of music videos downloaded for free from the iTunes Store to audio only .m4as in the Finder, following the hint at http://osxdaily.com/2012/01/16/convert-video-to-audio-mac-os-x-lion/. After adding the audio files to my iTunes library, they still show the video icon in the library list, and the media kind in the Get Info panel says “Music Video”, with no way to change it to just “Music” like other .m4a files. How can I force these files to be recognized as simple music files?\n\nA: You should be able to use subler to do that. Just open the file, go to other settings and you can set the media kind to \"normal\".\nhttps://subler.org/\n", "Q: How can I add a new search engine to Safari without any 3rd party add-ons? I know add-ons such as Glims can do this, but I would rather stay away from them.  Any native (or more likely semi-native) way to do so?  If it matters, the engine I would like to add is duckduckgo.\n\nA: No, the only options are Google, Bing, and Yahoo.\nIf it is of any help, DuckDuckGo have their own extension on the Apple website for Safari extensions. \n\nA: The Safari Extension anysearch allows you to change the search engine used by the Safari search bar/unibar, without any hack-ish stuff such as changing the hosts file.\n\nA: MacHints just did a post on this. The basic premise is that you redirect Yahoo! Search via the hosts file to the search engine of your choice.  It works like a charm.\n\nA: in your /etc/hosts file, add this line:\n184.72.115.86 search.yahoo.com\n\nthen choose Yahoo as your default search.\n\nA: For DuckDuck&Go, close Safari, and open the Terminal and enter:\ndefaults write com.apple.Safari SearchProviderIdentifier \"com.duckduckgo\"\n\nA: This works with Safari 5.1.10 on Mac OS 10.6.8\nTo get Safari to open with duckduckgo (or any other) as search engine with no add ons or hacking type >https://duckduckgo.com/< (without the ><) into the Safari Preferences \"Homepage\" then set \"New windows open with\" to \"Homepage\" and \"New tabs open with\" \"Homepage\". This keeps the 3 default search engines as they were, at the top. OR just make the search engine of your choice a bookmark in the Bookmark bar and just click it/them.\n", "Q: What is the difference between a iTunes ID and an Apple ID? I have an Apple ID, do I also need an iTunes ID to purchase music?\n\nA: There is no difference, Apple ID is the more general term and the one more commonly used nowadays.\n", "Q: What happens when I reset my iPod? I heard that if I reset my iPod, I will lose everything.\nIs there anything I can do to not lose all my apps, information, etcetera?\n\nA: Yes, you will lose all your settings. That is the whole purpose of reseting a device. If instead, you just want to restart your device, you hold the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button at the same time for at least 10 seconds. For clarification: Reseting will erase your data, restarting will not erase your data.\nThe easiest way to backup an iPod Touch these days is to use iCloud backup. Apple has all the directions on this page. Basically all you do is go to Settings > iCloud > Storage & Backup > Backup Now.\nThen once it's done with the backup (it may take several hours), you will be able to use it to restore your device. Restoring all the data is simple as well. All you do is choose the Restore from iCloud Backup option when it asks you to set up the new device.\nMake sure you keep your username and password for iCloud in a safe place, because you will need it again after you restore your device.\n\nA: If it's an iOS device you can back it up using iTunes, if not try an app like Senuti to rip everything back to the computer from the iPod.\n\nA: By resetting, if you just held down the home and sleep button for 10 seconds, you won't lose your stuff. \nWhen I restored mine, I lost all my music but that's about it.\n", "Q: What is in an IPSW file? I know that an IPSW is an iOS firmware restore file. When you want to install a beta firmware, Apple ships these. This website stores all old iOS versions in that format.\nWhat exactly is in an IPSW file and in what format?\nCan I view the files in it? Do I use a hex editor, or something else? Is an IPSW like a zip file (like .app or .bundle), or is it binary encoded or encrypted? \n\nA: The IPSW file type is primarily associated with 'iPhone/iPod' by Apple Inc.. This is a firmware update file for the iPhone. The file is a renamed .ZIP file. If you unZIP it you will see a file called MANIFEST.PLIST and a file without an extension but with a version number in the name, e.g., Firmware-14.5.3. This file is the firmware image.\nSource http://filext.com/file-extension/IPSW\n", "Q: iPhone 3g; iOS 4.2 to iOS 5 performance? Features aside, should I expect a performance increase in general or the reverse?\n\nA: Sorry, but the Wikipedia article for iOS 5 indicates that iOS 5 does not support the iPhone 3G.\n\nA: Everything I have read on the subject indicates a high probability of reduced performance when upgrading a 3G from iOS 3 to iOS 4.  iOS 5 is not supported on the 3G.  There were also some crashing issues with iOS 3.1.3 and later.  I've kept my 3G at 3.1.2, however more and more apps are dropping support for iOS 3.\n\nA: When upgrading my iPhone 3G to iOS4 I had a dramatic loss of performance.\niOS5 is not supported by iPhone 3G.\n", "Q: Why would Exchange account work in Lion Mail and not Snow Leopard Mail? My wife's corporate e-mail is on an Exchange server. Everything — Mail, Address Book, and iCal — used to work fine on Snow Leopard. Then they changed some things, including the URL. Now Snow Leopard is having difficulties autodiscovering and setting up new accounts. If I'm persistent, Address Book and iCal will work. But Mail won't — it finds and tries to set up the account, seems to connect, even reads all of her mail folders on the server, but no existing messages appear. New messages received after the account is set up on her Mac will show up, but they will not be marked as read if read another way (Entourage/Outlook, webmail, etc.).\nThe weird thing is that all of this works seamlessly on Lion. If I set up her account through the Mail, Contacts, & Calendars system pref pane, everything just works. Incidentally, it was using the settings in the Lion apps that allowed me to force Address Book and iCal on Snow Leopard to connect correctly. But I can't get Mail working no matter what I try.\nCan anyone offer any suggestions? What would cause an Exchange server to talk to Mail on Lion correctly and not to Mail on Snow Leopard, even when I manually copy every possible setting?\n\nA: SnowLeopard was the first version of OS X to have built-in support for Exchange 2007. Lion Mail officially added support for Exchange 2010 (according to the Lion Wikipedia page). If the Exchange server is running Exchange 2010, it's possible that contacts and calendars were compatible enough on Snow Leopard to just work, but Mail was not.\n", "Q: File has different name in terminal and Finder I've just downloaded the driver for my preferred trackball from Logitech. In the Finder, the Installer's filename is Logitech Control Center Installer.app. In the Terminal, ls shows LCC Installer.app. How did this happen?\n\nA: One possible reason for a different name is if the package has a localized name. This allows the name displayed in the Finder to vary depending on the language of the user, and it also can be different than the \"actual\" name of the file, as displayed in Terminal.\n\nA: @Daniels answer re localization would seem to be correct but Apple's documentation is decaying.\nThe nearest I could find via Bundle Programming Guide is the archived  File System Advanced Programming topics where it says\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the extension .localized to the directory name.\n\n*Create a subdirectory inside the directory called .localized. (You must create this directory programmatically or using the Terminal application.)\n\n*Inside the .localized subdirectory, create a strings files for each localization you support.\n\n\n", "Q: The document \"x\" could not be saved. You don’t have permission I am getting the following error:\n\nThe document could not be saved. You don't have permission\n\nThe error is not helpful at all because it does not point to where I don't have permission. To save the file, I need to Duplicate it each time, which is very painful. This time the error is from CleanWriterPro, but I have also received it from Numbers and TextEdit. Saving with TextMate works fine.\nPermissions to the file are set up correctly according to Finder.\nI think this must be some kind of problem with AutoSave permissions but despite googling with the error, I have not yet figured out what's wrong.\nI found one possible culprit for this problem for me:\ngrant:Library joneskoo $ pwd\n/Users/joneskoo/Library\ngrant:Library joneskoo $ ls -lad Autosave\\ Information/\ndrwx------  2 root  staff  68 Sep 25  2010 Autosave Information/\n\nSince Library is hidden in Lion, it needs to be made visible before the permissions can be fixed in Finder:\nchflags nohidden ~/Library\n\nAfter unhiding the Library, I opened the Get Information for Library, clicked the lock and selected \"Apply to enclosing items\" so that all files in Library made owned by me and no permissions for others.\nHowever, CleanWriterPro is still not able to save the file in Documents, even though I repeated the step for Documents and Desktop. I could not reproduce the problem in Numbers now.\nRepairing Disk permissions did not help.\nPossibly related: I can't even rename files in Finder now under Documents without typing my password.

How can I remove it?\nThe question is: what are all the places I need to check to fix this problem?\n\nA: I was able to fix the problem for CleanWriterPro by removing extended ACL from the affected directories (Documents, Desktop):\n$ chmod -R -N Desktop Documents\n\nFor others with the same problem, I'd suggest checking the permissions of at least the following places:\n\n\n*\n\n*~/Library/Autosave Information\n\n*~/Library/Containers – see Unsaved Files in OS X Lion\n\n*the folders containing the problematic files\n\n\nUse the command\n$ ls -le Documents\n\nto show also the extended ACLs when looking at the problem. Finder will not show all ACL information.\nThere is a related discussion at Apple Discussion Forums, Lion Permissions Problem. It proposes the solution of removing all ACL from home directory and restoring the ACLs for some default folders. Please read the entire post from there; but the commands are:\nchmod -R -N ~\nchmod +a \"everyone deny delete\" ~/ ~/Desktop ~/Documents ~/Downloads ~/Library ~/Movies ~/Music ~/Pictures ~/Public\n\nThe ACL prevents the user from deleting or renaming the default folders.\nAn unintuitive but maybe safer(?) alternative is described at OS X Daily: Repair user permissions in Mac OS X Lion\n\nA: I have encountered this problem twice for TextEdit, on OS X Lion, and rebooting the computer fixed the problem both times.\nSorry that I can't give you anything more profound, but there you go.\n\nA: Have you tried turning it off and turning it on again?  (I.e. restarting the offending program.)\nIt worked just now for a friend of mine.  I asked him to do it while I was here researching -- and it worked.  \nYMMV, of course.\n\nA: I know this is an old thread, but it comes up high in the google search results, so I'm adding my answer for OSX 10.14.  I was having this issue in Pages, Numbers, and Keynote. \nI went to security in System Preferences, selected the privacy \"tab,\" and then in the left column scrolled down to \"Full Disk Permission.\" I'm guessing this is not something you normally want to do, but by giving those three apps permission, it now works. \nTo add the apps, first unlock the interface with the lock icon. Then, assuming you've already selected \"Full Disk Access,\" click the plus button under the right column's list of apps. Go to /Applications and select the first app. Repeat for the other two.\nEdit: I found a different set of instructions for how to fix this, so I went back to delete the apps from the \"Full Disk Access\" list. However, the problem no longer occurred. Somehow just adding the apps to this list, saving a file (not sure if this step was important), and then removing them from the \"Full Disk Access\" list fixed the problem.\n\n\nA: First, I'd recommend looking at the permissions on the folder containing the file in question.\nSecond, a tool that might help you is the Repair Permissions function in Disk Utility. This might find and repair what is wrong with your system.\n\n\nA: To remove any ACLs and restore all the files in your home directory to be owned by you, you can run the following commands in Terminal:\n sudo chown -R `whoami` ~\n chmod -N -R ~\n\nThis should ensure you have access to all your files.\nSome ACLs are in place by default, however, to prevent you from deleting your Documents folder, Music folder, etc., and to enable other users to access your Public folder. While all these folders were able to serve their function in versions of OS X that predate ACLs, removing the ACLs should fix the access problems you are encountering, but might make your Public folder behave differently than expected.\n\nA: To make one of the possible issues clear, under Lion the Disk Utility does not repair user home directory file permissions. The process linked at the end of the first answer -- Repair user permissions in Mac OS X Lion is a simple and direct way to reset user permissions.\n", "Q: How to configure local apache virtual hosts? Configuring Apache for local development on Lion I've managed to clue out this much:\n\n\n*\n\n*/private/etc/apache2/ and /etc/apache2/ are symlinked\n\n*/etc/apache2/httpd.conf is authoritative\n\n*httpd.conf draws on the confs in extra\n\n*original is a red herring of unknown origin - presumably Apache\n\n\nComing from Debian, I've become accustomed to handling apache virtual hosts by adding files to /etc/apache2/sites-available/ and symlinking them to /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/. But that looks to be the special reserve of 'Lion Server' peoples. It's probably relatively trivial to set up that way but I'd like to know what other people have done;\n\n\n*\n\n*How do you configure your vhosts?\n\n*Where do you put the code and docroot for your vhosts?\n\n*Where do you put the log files?\n\n*Where do you put the local application configuration?\n\n*How do you resolve the name service?\n\n\nA: 1. How do you configure your vhosts?\nThe \"Lion way\" to do so would be uncommenting the following line in your httpd.conf.\n#Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf\n\nNow you can edit /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf and put your vhosts in there. It's a good idea to start with a default one that will match all unqualified hosts, for example:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n  DocumentRoot /Library/WebServer/Documents\n</VirtualHost>\n\nNext, you can either add every vhost to the same file, or you can set up a similar system like Debian by including all files in a specific directory next, like so:\nInclude /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/*\n\nNow whether you symlink files here that exist somewhere else (sites-available) or put actual files doesn't really matter. Personally, I think sites-available is overkill for a dev box (and I don't ever really want to \"disable\" a vhost), so I just create a file for every vhost directly in sites-enabled or equivalent (in fact I named the directory /etc/apache/sites to avoid confusion).\n2. Where do you put the code and docroot for your vhosts?\nMy actual sites I put in /Users/username/Sites. I prefer to put them under my home directory for easier access in Finder etc. That said, it is good to notice that this directory is exposed by default by the userdir module. Since I don't need userdir hosting, and I am going to configure webroots below, I disabled it by commenting the following line:\nInclude /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf\n\n3. Where do you put the log files?\nLog files I keep the same (eg. /var/log/apache/*). Again, for a local development box, I believe individual log files for every vhost are overkill. There's only so much that I can multitask :) If you do want separate log files, you can of course configure it that way inside the VirtualHost directive (for example /var/log/apache/my.project.dev-error.log).\n4. Where do you put the local application configuration?\nWhich applications are you referring to? If web application, I keep those together with all other project files. Depending on your architecture, your config files do not need to be under your webroot if that's an issue, in fact typically my webroot for any given project will be /Users/username/Sites/someproject/web, so config files could be at /Users/username/Sites/someproject/config without exposing them through Apache.\n5. How do you resolve the name service?\nThe most straight-forward would be adding each hostname to /etc/hosts. Unfortunately, this doesn't do wildcards. If you feel comfortable with setting up a DNS server like bind, you could configure one locally or on your network to resolve *.dev to 127.0.0.1, for example. Disadvantage of doing that on your network is of course that it will stop working at a different location. Personally, I use /etc/hosts.\n", "Q: Software to increase my volume on iPod nano 6th gen?

I tried restoring my ipod but even that does not increase my volume to the full. I just want a software solution through which I can increase my volume up to the full. At the moment my volume is at mute so can anyone please help me.\n\nA: I don't know of any software that can change the volume but you could use Apple Earphones with Remote to change the volume even though the buttons don't work.\nhttp://store.apple.com/us/product/MB770G/B\nI also found this, a remote that can be used with any headphones:\niLuv Universal Headphone Remote For iPod\n\nA: I have the same problem also.

Brave is also available for iOS.\nBrave\n\nWikipedia says:\n\nBrave is a free and open-source web browser based on the Chromium web browser and its Blink engine, announced by the co-founder of the Mozilla project and creator of JavaScript, Brendan Eich. It claims to block website trackers and remove intrusive Internet advertisements. The browser also claims to improve online privacy by sharing less data with advertising customers. \n\nVivaldi\n\nWikipedia says:\n\nVivaldi is a freeware, cross-platform web browser developed by Vivaldi Technologies, a company founded by Opera Software co-founder and former CEO Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner and Tatsuki Tomita. The browser was officially launched on April 12, 2016.

However, when my battery is running low, switching off 3G can make the difference between the battery making it until I get to a charger or not.

I ask to decide whether it would be safe to keep downloaded unofficial applications (got outside the appstore) in the global location.\n\nA: /Applications is, like you said, global.  Apps run from that folder have no different permissions or privileges if they were in any other folder.  It's the same as running an app in the ~/Downloads folder, it's just neater to have the global /Applications folder.\nHaving said that, apps in the ~/Applications folder are limited to being run by that user since the ~/Applications folder will have permissions on the folder for the user they're contained in.  \nIn my hunting around, the ~/Applications folder has global read-only access, but that can vary if a user decides to modify the ACLs (Access Control List) aka permissions.\nHope that clears it up for you!\n", "Q: Can I copy an app from an iPad to an iPad2?

It has been sitting at the same number of songs for several hours (apart from this \"jump\").\nI also basically have the same issue on another Mac (just stuck at a different number), which mostly has the same iTunes library (but not quite).Actually, this Mac has just finished. The other one refused to continue matching while this one was doing it, so everything might just be a case of extremely slow progress, or some issue with the update of the progress report.\nDoes someone have any idea what is going on and how to fix it?\n\nA: I have found this extremely elaborate post by \"sapintel\" on the Apple Support forums. Actually, inspecting the open files and ports as described here has shown me that iTunes is in fact opening and closing files, so it may just be a progress bar issue.\n\nHow to fix Step 2 and Step 3 Errors in iTunes: Music Media Formats, and Checking Firewall Blocks.\nStep 1, 2, or 3 Hangs: Problems with Media Formats.\nIf you have heterogenous media formats in your music files, some of them will FAIL iTunes match, causing it to hang. This is a software error in iTunes match, which should mark the files as \"Not eligible\" instead of remaining stuck in an endless loop. These errors never occur if all the songs in the music library are unprotected AAC 256 kbps music files encoded by iTunes 10.5.1.\nThere are two basic ways to upgrade your song media formats to iTunes 10.5.1 AAC encoding - encode all of them at once, or do them selectively. In either method, you must delete the original version from iTunes and your file system. If you previously loaded them to iCloud, get rid of them there also.\nYou will be able to see a hung file in OS/X under Activity Monitor → iTunes → Inspect Process → Open Files and Ports. In Windows you will have to use standard Task Manager inspections.\nIn my iTunes library, I found that certain AAC (*.m4a) files which were encoded in before 2011 were stuck, and *.m4p Protected AAC files.\nYou may convert all files which were not encoded at 256 kbps AAC with a right-mouse click. Find them:\n1) individually in iTunes as you discover them in Open Files and Ports trace, or\n2) by creating a sort smart playlist that matches their pattern. For example, a playlist with bit-rate < 256k. \nAfter converting them, you MUST delete the previous file(s) from your iTunes library, move the actual file to trash, and delete the trash. Archive the files if you wish. If any of them were already matched to iTunes Match, you must delete them there also.\nAfter getting rid of older media formats, your Open Files and Ports window should no longer show any music file open in your iTunes library.\nIf you have converted your music library and Step 3 is still stuck with no file open, it is likely a Firewall problem. Check the last line in Open Files and Ports, and use the information in the last rows to check your firewall settings. The upload port is shown in this form, 192.168.1.1:53089 → 72.21.214.201:https. If you see this type of row, but nothing is being uploaded, a firewall or other issue is blocking that port.\nIn my case the block was created by my broadband modem settings. Check with the installation guide for your modem - typically they can be managed by a http:// address such as http://192.168.1.254/. Change the firewall settings as needed.\n\nA: Most likely there is nothing wrong with it. uploading 4000 at 3MBs to 6MBs is a lot of memory. If you are going through WIFI to upload it, or even almost any internet connection it will take some time. Also when uploading, progress bars are not reliable. they some times freeze and stop. It may look like its hanging, but it mostly is still working you will just need to give it sometime. The speed of your computer can affect it as well, if it's not a newer faster computer it can added to the time it will take.\n", "Q: iMessage inconsistently failing to work after Sim card swap I recently swapped my Sim card in my iPhone 4, to move to another carrier.  I ported my number across so there is no change other than the actual Sim card.\nSince then, iMessage seems to be entirely inconsistent in whether it will actually work or not.  Messages will wait for ages before failing with a \"Not Delivered\" message, to recipients that I previously used iMessage with.  Failed messages will not even send as an SMS instead, even though this setting is turned on and would be used in the past.\nI have turned iMessage on and off several times.  I have checked it is receiving at the correct addresses (my phone number, which is correct, and my Apple ID email address also).  Sometimes this works, sometimes it fails to activate, and just says it's waiting, sometimes it does nothing except return me to the screen without making any changes, or I get \"An error occurred during activation, try again\".  Often it will ask me to re-sign into my Apple ID, which will usually fail.\nRebooting the phone normally or with a force reset makes no change, although sometimes rebooting it with iMessage disabled, will start it up with it enabled and working...  Eventually after messing around in the settings app it will show as enabled and receiving at the proper addresses, and then it may work for a while longer, but at some random interval which could be hours or minutes it will start to fail to send them again.  Right now everything is showing as \"ON\" apart from the subject line setting, and it is set to receive at the proper addresses, but failing to send anything.\nI am running the latest OS update, non jailbroken.\nAny clues as to why this happens, and how I can prevent it?\nEDIT:\nI am now in a curious half way house, where I get the bubble to show someone is replying to my messages etc, but my own messages are still sent as text messages.  I send a message, it goes as a text, I see the reply being types and it's delivered, presumable all this happens over the iMessage system, and my next reply is still a text.  Genius :)\nEDIT 2:\nSo, I can now see the \"speech bubble\" that implies someone is typing a reply.  The reply, however, never arrives.  I have turned iMessage off now.  I get free texts anyway, I just liked the read receipts :(\n\nA: Have you tried resetting the network settings with iMessage turned off?\nTo reset your network settings, tap \n\n\n*\n\n*Settings > General\n\n*Then scroll down and tap Reset > Reset Network Settings\nWhen the device restarts, turn on your iMessage again and let it activate.\n\nA: Well I am unsure what fixed it, but after a week or so it simply started to work normally.  I had stopped trying to trouble shoot, and had merely left it alone.  So I guess that the problem was a transitory one somewhere in the system that has now gone  away without my intervention.\n", "Q: Unibody White MacBook display dims when laptop on top of another When you place an open display plastic unibody MacBook upon a closed display MacBook of almost any kind, the display will cut out when it goes past the ninety degree angle.  I am thinking its a pressure point issue or a magnet issue.  Though not entirely sure.\nIts consistent enough to see it, but infrequent enough not to worry about it, since stacking laptops is a no-no, but occurs when doing mass imaging.\nHas anyone else out there seen this strangeness?\nWhat may be causing it?\n\nA: I've had this happen to me a few times, and it is annoying. My best guess is that the magnets in one MacBook are tricking the other one into thinking that the lid is closed. I know that it's at least possible to intentionally trigger the magnet that detects if the lid is closed, and my guess is that the other MacBook has a magnet in close proximity that's triggering it.\n\nA: Yes, I've had this happen; I thought the display was toast. Extremely faint (barely visible) image, not asleep, could occasionally get the image displayed to change. Read this post, picked up the laptop and … fine image. But I set it right down where it had been (yes, on top of another unibody MacBook) and the display stayed lit - repositioned slightly (it took a few tries) and replicated the problem.\nMagnet idea is tempting, but I don't think it's the case as my machine didn't actually go to sleep - in fact I'd assume that closing the case would make the display black, not just extremely dim. \n\nA: Can you tell if the MacBook is going to sleep when it goes past 90 degrees? If it's not going to sleep and the display itself is cutting out, it may be an issue with the LVDS connection on the logic board. \nIf it's actually going to sleep, Kyle may be right in that it's a magnet issue or a false triggering issue.\n\nA: I got the same problem with two Dell XPS 13 when one is stacked on top of the other. When being stacked on the other, the top one goes to sleep and pressing the power button can't wake it up; when it however moves out of the bottom one's frontal edge, it wakes up automotically. This is true even the bottom one is powered off.\nConclusion: The sleeping mode is most probably caused by magnet on the bottom of the top laptop and the top of the bottom laptop, which are used for the lid-closing procedure of the laptop.\n", "Q: How to disable Facebook push notifications in iPad 2 I have an iPad 2 with iOS 4 and the Facebook for iPad app installed.\nEven after disabling all the Push Notifications from Settings > Facebook > Push Notifications, I still get push notifications.\nIs this a bug in either Facebook or Apple's part or is there a hidden setting somewhere to disable the notifications?\n\nA: There were some bugs in the FB app for notifications, but you should be able to disable the notifications on an app-by-app basis in at the iOS level from Settings -> General -> Notifications (or Settings -> Notifications ... I don't have an iOS 4 device handy to double-check).\n\nA: I had the same problem. You have to ALSO go to Settings->Notifications within the iPad app and turn off Notifications there AS WELL.\n", "Q: Games from iPad to iPhone? Is there a way to start one game on the iPhone and continue it going on to your iPad? \n\nA: This is dependent on how the game's developer has coded it. In principle it is possible that the developer saves the state somewhere on the internet but my guess is this is only normally done for games with a network or social component. It may even be possible to do a sync via iTunes on a desktop computer shared by the iPhone and iPad (i.e. sync the iPhone with the computer then plug the iPad into the computer). However, all of this depends on how the game was coded and as far as I know there is no general way of doing this.\n", "Q: Why doesn't my Mac go to sleep when closing the lid or through the task bar when plugged in? I noticed that when I close to lid of my MacBookPro 2008 edition. My computer does not go to sleep. I also observed that this occurs when the Mac is plugged in. When I unplug, everything seems to be working fine. Does it have something to do with Lion? I already tried changing the energy settings in System Preferences.\n\nA: Oddly Resetting my Sharing preferences did solve my problem. All I did is go into the System Preferences Settings. \n1. Chose Sharing.\n2. Uncheck everything that is checked.\n3. Close System Preferences.\n4. Open Systems preferences back up. \n5. Go back into Sharing\n6. Check everything you want checked\n7. PROBLEM SOLVED !!! (For me at least) I have a 2008 MacbookPro running Max OS X 10.7.2\n\nA: The culprit is the internet sharing checkbox. If you had it enabled, the computer will stay on when the lid is closed, but turn the display off. This is so that the bridge stays up. Uncheck Internet Sharing and your sleep mode should functions properly.\n\nA: Try an SMC Reset.\n\nThe System Management Controller (SMC) is responsible for many low-level functions on Intel-based Macs. These functions include:\n\n*\n\n*Responding to display lid opening and closing on portable Macs\n\n*[...]\n\n\n", "Q: ITunes Match will not match all songs In step 2 of iTunes Match, all of my songs except one are matched (3937 of 3938) and it is stuck at step 2.

Or you can restart it, if nothing else works.\n", "Q: Macbook (unibody plastic) won't reconnect to wifi after setting up new router while other devices do just fine I recently upgraded to a Wireless-N capable router (Linsys WRT160N) from a Wireless-G model.  Everything was fine and dandy with the G, but I needed a stronger signal strength in my living room and dining room.  After getting the new router configured and deconflicting the channels, it's finally working great with my Macbook, Galaxy Nexus, and wife's iPhone 4.  \nThe Macbook, however, refuses to reconnect to my network after closing and opening the lid.  It connects fine once you select the network from the list of available ones, but it has never done so on its own.  I've made sure that my network is at the top of the preferred networks list in the Advanced menu in the Network settings, but that still has no effect.  \nAm I missing something?\n\nA: The most common solution to this problem (I encountered numerous times) is to change the WiFi channel on your router.\nIf your router is set to auto channel you can switch to channel 6 or 11 for example.\nAnd try different channels.\n\nA: Start by creating a new network location to see if the issue is replicated. Here's how \n\nIf that fails then you can remove the System Configuration folder to the Trash and restart the computer, which then creates a new System Configuration folder.\nMacintosh HD/Library/Preferences/System Configuration\n\nA: In the Advanced configuration for the Wifi Network Configuration, theres a checkbox that says \"Remember networks this computer has joined\"\nIf that is unchecked, one consequence is that WiFi will see and recognise your wifi network, but will never join it unless you tell it to, which sounds like your issue down to a T.\n", "Q: Sporadic Double NAT problem with Airport Extreme Base Station I am currently using an Airport Extreme N Base Station (firmware version 7.6) connected to a cable modem to connect around 7 wireless clients  and two wired clients to the internet. Prior to this I was using the same Airport Extreme with a DSL modem. \nI don't know if my current situation arose when I switched to cable or if it started after a firmware update to version 7.4. My base station will lose access to the internet multiple times per day at random intervals. Attached is a screenshot of an airport status message that describes the Double Nat issue that seems to be causing my internet outages but I cannot understand why this is a sporadic problem rather than a persistent one.  \nI have googled for a solution and am not seeing any for my exact situation. I have read that this type of problem occurs when there is one router attached to a second and both are using NAT and DHCP. I understand that the way to fix this problem is to put either the modem or the Airport Base Station into bridge mode. \nI would prefer to put the modem into bridge mode but it does not appear that my ISP, Cablevision, allows me to make configuration changes to my modem. I have tried putting my Base Station in Bridge Mode and have turned off DHCP and NAT but this results in a green status light on my Base Station with no access to the internet. \nIs anyone familiar with my problem and what I need to do to correct it? \n\n\nA: Contact your upstream internet provider (Cablevision) and let them know you wish / need to manage the network and want their device to operate in bridge mode. Often someone will post the details on how to get into your modem and re-configure it in cases where the provider doesn't want to assist you, but I've always had good luck asking (especially the techs that will have to come to your location for trouble calls.) If you call once or twice and explain you call each time this Double NAT error happens, they will quickly realize what you need to run your network without having to call them on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe Airport hardware doesn't have anything to do with this detection, so the software in the router is detecting a change in the upstream network configuration and reporting it.\nUsually I've seen this with metro-wide WiFi networks where a fault will change the routing through another router that is misconfigured or not normally serving the modems of customers directly.\nUnless you're changing the settings of the Airport, the cause is almost surely up stream from the device itself.\n\nA: If you've been using the newer version of AirPort Utility (version 6.0), try using the older 5.6 version instead (if it's not still on your system, you can download it from Apple's support site. It still work with the newer AEBS units, and it seems to have more granular control over your address sharing.\nTo make the configuration change, after selecting your base station, click \"Manual Setup\". Then click the Internet icon at the top of the window, then make sure the following are set as described:\nInternet Connection tab -> Connection sharing: \"Share a public IP address\"\nTCP/IP tab -> Configure IPv4 using: \"DHCP\" (the rest should fill in automatically)\nNAT tab -- Make sure that \"Enable default host at\" is not checked; this will ensure NAT is not enabled on the AEBS\nClick the Update button to apply the config change and restart the AEBS.\nI ran into this exact same issue ever since I got my refurbished AEBS 802.11n dual-band unit a week ago, and today has been a really bad day for spontaneous drops. I just made these changes after futzing around for hours with the newer AirPort Utility app, and I believe this should fix the problem. I made the changes earlier today and so far everything is stable.\n\nA: I'm having the same problem as you with the same equipment. Cablevision Modem(Scientific Atlanta) -> Airport Extreme N and I get this issue sporadically but only when playing XBOX live or torrenting.\nPerhaps our ISP is changing our VLAN to throttle traffic and the airport is seeing this packet shaping or other network changes (or actually reporting a true change to double NAT)\n", "Q: Is there an iOS lifecycle policy - i.e. which older devices a new iOS release supports? This question gives useful information on iOS 4.3 support. However is there a publicly available policy for future iOS versions on which devices they will support? For example, do they always support two previous generations of hardware, or does it vary according to each release?\nIf there is no official policy, what does the trend seem to be?\n\nA: I'm unaware of official policy but in my experience (opinion?) Apple supports older devices with new OSs as long as it is technically reasonable to do.\nThere are those that hold that Apple will use an OS or feature update to push the sale of new devices (i.e. Siri only available on iPhone 4S) but I have yet to see conclusive proof of this. Apple seems able to sell boatloads of phones (pads, pods and computers) without forcing the market and, in all cases that I've seen, there are equally plausible, and less \"evil\", explanations for Apple's decision. \n\nA: John Gruber summarized all sane observations about the iPhone lifecycle (part “THE IPHONE PRODUCT CYCLE”).\nIn short, the trend seems to be of two generations support for older devices:\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS5 best on iPhone 4S, supported by iPhones 4 and 3GS.\n\n*iOS4 best on iPhone 4, supported by iPhones 3GS and 3G.\n\n\nApple of course does not have any official policy about that, as for anything that would approach roadmapping.\n", "Q: Transferring bookmarks from Apple Maps to Google Maps Is there a way to transfer bookmarks from Apple Maps to Google Maps? I understand why I can't, but has anyone found a workaround?\n\nA: There is no way to synchronize Maps with Maps (so to speak), but you can sync Earth with Maps, with Google Earth being on the iPhone. If you log in to Google Earth, it will synchronize your maps. Those can be added from Google Maps on the web. Unfortunately, there's still no way to add stuff from an iPhone, but there isn't no connectivity between them.\nBecause I think that was a really messy and hard-to-understand answer, here's a clearer synopsis:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Maps app on the iPhone, there's no way to see things you've added on a computer.\n\n*In the Google Earth app on the iPhone, you can see \"maps\" (collections of pins) that you've created in Google Maps on a computer.\n\n*There's no way to add pins on an iPhone in either of these apps to later see on a computer.\n\n\nI'm sorry there's no way to do what you want in a native Google app!\n", "Q: How to get designated apps to open on designated desktops I would like to get TextMate and Safari to open in the same desktop, but have looked in System Preferences and can't see where to do this?\nLeopard and Snow Leopard had this in System Preferences, but I can't find it in Lion.\nThanks in advance for your help.\n\nA: When you have at least two spaces in Mission Control, you can access the necessary options via right-click on the app icon in the dock:\n\n\nA: In 13.1 it is not possible.

Or am I missing something here? Just got it last month, brand new from amazon.\nLatest generation 32gb iPod Touch running iOS 5\n\nA: I just tried this on my iOS 5 iPhone, and I had no issue.  I would try restoring your device at Settings -> General -> Reset -> Reset All Settings and see if that fixes some glitch or something with your iPod.  But, this is a software issue, so returning your device for a new one shouldn't be the only solution.\n\nA: My now playing button stopped working for no reason, I just turned mine on and off for a couple of minutes.  Try this before resetting all settings.  Also, first try to get to the song without hitting now playing a couple times bc mine didn't work the first time.\n", "Q: Prevent automatic removal of the Spotlight index due to low disk space I am guessing that when disk space runs low, it automatically deletes the Spotlight index to make room for virtual memory. Then when space becomes available it reindexes. But I'm not sure about that.  \nSince my MacBook Air SSD is only 128 GB, I often work with little free disk space and the re-indexing drives me crazy.\nI tried to disable Spotlight, remove its index and reindex.\nAlso check filesystem and repair permissions. In diagnostic reports (~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/) nothing about reindexing is mentioned.\nYou can say that I should control the amount of free space but also should be another way. Disabling Spotlight isn't the option.\ncrosspost: https://discussions.apple.com/message/17321018#17321018\n\nA: mdutil is the command line tool that controls Spotlight.\nLooking at the mdutil man page, there doesn't appear to be an option to make the index persistent regardless of disk space.  There is mention that \"indexing may be delayed due to low disk space or other conditions\".\nOne idea that comes to mind is that you can take away write permissions on your index files for all users, this should prevent them from being deleted, but it would also prevent them from being updated, and a static index is likely not desirable, and could cause errors.  This might be worthy of testing, but I don't expect it would go very well.\nIt doesn't appear that Spotlight is designed to work in the way you are looking for.  I would suggest submitting a feature request to Apple.\n", "Q: Which iOS devices do not support iOS 5?

A work around for this problem is change the permissions on the app so that it's can't be deleted (nor upgraded) by iTunes - first locate the app (e.g.  /Users/me/Music/iTunes/iTunes\\ Media/Mobile\\ Applications/OpenDoor\\ 2.27.ipa )\nThen you set the immutable flag on the app:\nchflags uchg  /Users/me/Music/iTunes/iTunes\\ Media/Mobile\\ Applications/OpenDoor\\ 2.27.ipa\n\nNow when iTunes tries to update the app it tries to delete and replace it with the newer version but it fails ('Saying the original file can't be found').

The iPad calendar is much better than the iPhone version.\nArguably, with the Retina Display the iPhone should be able to display a similar interface.\nAll of the current iOS devices have different feature sets, yet claim to support the same operating system: iOS 5.\nAs of this writing iOS 5 is available for all iPad models, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 GSM, iPhone 4 CDMA, the iPod touch 3rd generation and the iPod touch 4th generation.\nWhen the iPad was introduced, it came with iOS 3.2, which was a version made specifically for the iPad.  It included several features that would later be incorporated into iOS 4 and made available on other devices.\nWhen iOS 4.2 (I think) was released, it marked the first version of iOS that was compatible with both iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad.\nMy question is this:\nDoes each device have a build of iOS created specifically for their hardware with every update release?\nOr does the firmware file for the OS contain all of the features/interface elements for the entire product line (Like the iPad calendar interface) and only make available what features/settings the device should have?\nNote, I know that iOS 5 can pull small updates and doesn't have to download the entire firmware each time. I'm asking about an initial upgrades and installs.\n\nA: iOS 5 comes in different \"flavors\" for each device.  iOS is stored on the computer you sync to as an .ipsw file.  These files are located here:\n~/Library/iTunes/iPod Software Updates/\n~/Library/iTunes/iPad Software Updates/\n~/Library/iTunes/iPhone Software Updates/\nEach device's \"flavor\" of iOS is optimized and only contains the code needed for the device it pertains to.\n\nA: I don't know for sure how the Calendar application is implemented for iOS, but I can tell you what happened when I created a new iOS application project in Xcode last week. Xcode created a separate storyboard (i.e. user interface workflow) and target application for iPhone and iPad. This is necessary because visible controls such as buttons need to have different pixel sizes on iPhone and iPad in order to be finger-sized.\nThis is not an exact conversion in any way, but when you take a button on a 9.7-inch screen and shrink it down to fit on a 3.5-inch screen, the button is reduced to approximately 1/3 of its size.\n", "Q: How can I get Safari to open in desktop instead of its own space?

Choose the Window > Previous Recipients menu item, and scroll or search to locate the unwanted name/address combinations. From this list you can add entries to Address Book, or remove from previous recipients. This list is populated and updated every time you send an email.\n\nA: There should be different contacts for each name in your Address Book.app.\nSelect the unwanted contact and hit ⇤ to delete.\n\nA: Your best bet is to open Address Book, search for the email address and delete the incorrect contacts. \n\nA: I had same problem.  In my address book, I found a number of email addresses (rather than people's names) showing as contacts.  Whenever I opened one of those, I'd find MANY email addresses listed along with it.  I had to delete all of those contacts manually.  This did  not delete the emails where correctly linked to the people's names in my address book.  Usually these email address contact were found at the end of each letter's alphabetical listing.  It has solved the problem.\n\nA: In my case, an email address \"x@company.org\" used to be associated with one person and now it is used by another. I had been trying for weeks to root out the old name but it remained despite deleting/recreating the contact card, emptying the previous recipients list, etc etc.\nI found eventually that another gmail account on my mac, for which I had disabled contacts at one point, needed to be enabled again which then showed an older contact card that must have been hidden but still somehow being accessed by my mac mail. Deleting that card FINALLY allowed the new name to associate with the email address.\n", "Q: Is there an online resource with lots of iOS system icons?

I always use my MacBook with the charger plugged in and very rarely without the charger.\n\nA: I disagree with the previous answer. The Apple battery is designed to be discharged infrequently, for instance around once a week - this is how to get optimal life out of it (see here) - you can safely operate it on charge for about a week before needing a discharge. Provided you exercise the battery occasionally, it'll be fine.\nAlso, the battery does not cycle when it is on charge - Matt Love is incorrect. A cycle is defined as the battery dropping below 50% and returning above it - which doesn't happen when running from a charger. Approximately one cycle a week will give you optimal longevity before replacement. My battery is a little over two years old, and on 1-3 cycles a week I still get 80-85% of the original battery life out of it. \nLetting it die down as often as possible will not improve longevity - this is a common misconception but in the case of Lithium Ion batteries, more cycles = less life. \n\nA: First of all, it is very unhealthy for your to keep your MacBook on the charger all the time. It is best to let it charge up and die down as often as possible. Secondly, 189 cycles is normal for one year of usage. The battery is still cycling when it's on the charger, it's just not discharging much of the power it's accumulating which is the unhealthy part. \nI'd recommend letting it die down as often as possible and you should be in good shape.\n", "Q: FTP Client with AppleScript support I'm looking for an FTP client with the following requirements.\n\n\n*\n\n*File/Folder sync\n\n*Sftp/SSH tunnelling\n\n*Outstanding AppleScript support\n\n*Runs on Lion\n\n\nThe GUI interface is not overly important as it won't be the main interface used, however (and this is subjective) a better interface would be a bonus.\n\nA: Have you tried Transmit?

This may sound silly, but is there a way I can install the software without having an external CD drive? I had no idea that it came with a CD for installation or I would have made the 30 mile trip to the Apple store. :(\n\nA: If you have access to any other computers that do have a CD drive, you can use Drive Sharing\nAs Apple says,\n\nThis convenient feature of OS X lets you wirelessly “borrow” the optical drive of a nearby Mac or PC. So you can install applications from a DVD or CD and have full access to an optical drive without having to carry one around.\n\n\nA: Even with a CD drive available, I would recommend first checking the manufacturer's website for the latest drivers because there's a good chance they've been updated since the included CD was made. I would only bother with the CD if it contains bundled software or drivers that are unavailable online.\nIt looks like you should be able to download the latest drivers for your webcam from Logitech's downloads page for the HD Webcam C615.\nIf that download doesn't contain everything you need from the CD, then I would recommend following Daniel's answer.\n", "Q: Why won't iCloud let me download Pages documents uploaded from a computer? It often happens that I create a Pages document on my home laptop, upload it to iCloud, then want to download it from iCloud at school. For some reason, iCloud doesn't support this—I need to, at some point between those two steps, open Pages on an iOS device synched with my iCloud account. Then it'll work fine.\nI assume this has something to do with a preview being included in the file, as in iCloud it shows up as a generic .pages document rather than the customary document preview image thing, but I can't see why. Pages does include a preview in its saves, and \"Include preview in document by default\" is checked.\nWhat's happening, and is there any way I can get around it without use of an iPad or iPhone?\n\nA: The same things happens to me. After some digging around I found this from Apple: \n\nImportant:   You cannot download a document from icloud.com to your Mac or Windows computer until the document has been opened on an iOS device.\n\nMy guess is that this is a symptom of iCloud's \"work in progress\" status, and that this functionality will eventually be there. Considering that you are only asking to download the exact same file that you uploaded, though, it is a pretty silly restriction.\nUpdate:\nFor me, the behavior has recently changed. Now if you upload a file from your computer to icloud.com, you can download the original file to any computer from icloud.com. You still must download the document to an iOS device before you can download the file as a PDF or other format.\n\nA: The format used by iOS Pages is slightly different to the format used by OSX Pages. (who knows why Apple though this was clever?)\nAs the OSX iWork apps don't have iCloud document sync built in, iCloud.com primarily works with iOS devices. \nBut with Mountain Lion, it looks like at least the file formats will become interchangeable, if not the same, as the iWork document sync appears to built into the OS itself, rather than just the iWork apps (probably the reason why the iWork apps still dont' have iCloud built in) \nYou are pretty much stuck (I say stuck, in many ways better) with services like DropBox, in the hope that iCloud/com is vastly improved for Mountain Lion.\n\nA: I have reda somewhwere that the files actually sync to a folder on the Mac if you have iCloud enabled. But I don't know if you can open those files in iWork on the Mac.\n", "Q: What exactly does kernel_task do? I'd just like to know what it is that kernel_task is responsible for. Also, what's an acceptable maximum RAM and CPU use for it?\n\nA: The kernel task is special since it's an entire operating system / micro kernel based on Mach 3.0. It abstracts most of the core hardware, timing, message passing and memory handling. \nWhat most people notice in Activity Monitor is that kernel_task accumulates all the CPU time for input/output (i/o) processing delays and calculations as well as scheduling overhead of processes and threads. Similarly - it accumulates all memory allocations that are not in the user space. On the 2014 and newer Macs, this task exists to throttle the CPU - when the temperatures in the processor are too warm, kernel task is assigned \"no work\" and shows high CPU busy to let the processor idle and not overheat the computer. This is most noticeable on the portable line - especially the MacBook without any sort of fan or blower to cool the processor. Apple warns of this to potential kernel programmers in \"Why you should stay away from programming in the Kernel\" that disabling cooling will cause permanent irreparable hardware damage.\n\nTo summarize, kernel programming is an immense responsibility. You must be exceptionally careful to ensure that your code does not cause the system to crash, does not provide any unauthorized user access to someone else’s files or memory, does not introduce remote or local root exploits, and does not cause inadvertent data loss or corruption.\n\nIf you watch it after a reboot you will see it starts with minimal RAM and CPU needs and instead grows only when other programs run and need the system services. \nTo slim it down, shut off unneeded ports (WiFi, bluetooth, etc... ) as well as idle / unused programs. If things don't settle down, consider rebooting to ensure no task is stuck or leaking memory.  If you have programs doing real work, they will cause the kernel to use both memory and processor time - just watch as you start things to see which other programs are causing this behavior. It's rarely an issue with the kernel - even with badly performing programs - that can't be solved by logging out and back in again. The kernel_task cleans up well and generally takes care to only use the resources needed by the workload.\n\nA: Mac OS X Internals: A Systems Approach - Amit Singh - Google Books:\n\nthe kernel uses the task and thread abstractions to divide its functionality into various execution flows. The kernel uses a single task—the kernel task—with multiple threads that perform kernel operations such as scheduling, thread reaping, callout management, paging, and Unix exception handling. Thus, xnu is a monolithic kernel containing markedly different components such as Mach, BSD, and the I/O Kit, all running as groups of threads in a single task in the same address space.\n\nhttp://lists.apple.com/archives/darwin-kernel/2010/Sep/msg00014.html:\n\nThe kernel task is not a real task.  It represents the kernel, which is\n  the core of the operating system.  The bulk of what it does occurs at the\n  direct request of an application.  Every time you allocate a large block\n  of memory, open or close a file, read or write a file, pull data over the\n  network, create a new process or thread, etc., your application performs a\n  system call.  These calls cause the kernel to do work for your\n  application.  Much of that work is billed to the kernel task, but it\n  really is being done by your application, albeit indirectly.\n\n\nA: A practical reason why the kernel might be over-working is that your system is out of memory and it is thrashing. Check the memory pressure graph under the Memory tab of Activity Monitor to see if it is yellow or red. \nIn this case, you can sort processes by Memory and terminate some that consume a lot of it, to reduce the pressure. (e.g. kill some Google Chrome Helper processes)\n", "Q: Can I safely charge an iPhone 4S with a 5V 2A source? I just bought a New Trent IMP99D external battery, to keep my phone alive while gaming during long-haul flights. It has two USB ports to connect to, one which supplies 1 amp at 5 volts, another which supplies 2 amps at 5 volts.\nThe instruction manual says to connect smartphones to the 1-amp port, and any iPad 2's to the 2-amp port.\nIs there any harm, or do I incur any inefficiencies, if I connect my iPhone 4S to the 2-amp port instead of the recommended 1-amp port? \n\nA: When I travel, I only bring my iPad charger and use it interchangeably with my iPhone 4 without noticing any battery life performance and by that extension it should be the same for iPhone 4s. \nApple's website seems to confirm this; For the 10W USB iPad charger - \"It also charges iPhone and all iPod models with a dock connector.\"\n\nA: It should be fine, the iPhone has built in safeguards and  using the iPad charger wont incur any real damage \n\nA: It will destroy your battery if you do that for a long time... Mine exploded when I plugged it in after a while of using it! CAUTION!!!!\n", "Q: How to migrate selected folders (including custom Library, Application Support and Music data) to second laptop with smaller hard drive? I have an old MacBook Pro that I am replacing with a slightly less old MBP. Both are running Lion 10.7.2. (The older MBP has some hardware issues.)\nThe first MBP has a lot of music, video, application preferences, and symbolic links that I need to make sure get over to the second MBP, so that I can just swap the machines and, for the most part, be done with the swap.\nThe catch is that second MBP has a much smaller hard drive, so I can't simply copy over the Users folder, let alone run Carbon Copy Cloner, etc.\nWhat is the best way to clone selected folders, which ensures that hidden files, symbolic links, files with special permissions, etc. are recursively included?\n\nA: The easiest way should be with Migration Assistant (included with OS X). Just plug an Ethernet cable into both MacBooks, open Migration Assistant on both, and you'll be able to select what folders/applications you want to move over. \n", "Q: Why do newly added or edited contacts float to the top of my iPhone's contact list? Any newly added contacts, or contacts that have been edited are immediately sorted to the top of my contacts list on my iPhone 4 running iOS 5.0.1 using iCloud. The iPhone has not been jailbroken, or tampered with in any way. I'm not even able to use the quick select letters on the right that are above the letter R (See Example Photograph). I've deleted the contacts, and have re-entered them multiple times. I have even restored the iPhone 4 to see if that would fix the issue, and have even tried using an iPhone 3GS to test on with no differing results. Needless to say that this issue is occurring across the board, which makes me think it may be a setting that I'm unable to find. Has anyone else come across this issue? Does anyone know of a solution? Thanks a lot in advance!\nExample Photograph:\n\n\nA: It appears something has become corrupt in your contacts backup.\nWhen you say you've deleted contacts and re-entered them, do you mean you have restored them from backup, or manually created new ones?\nIf the latter, you can try rebuilding your contacts on a desktop and then re-syncing them. Are you using a Mac or PC?\n", "Q: iPhone as 'headphones' for computer I have been using headphones with an external USB sound card, but the sound card broke today, and my other audio ports are messed up.\nI have an iPhone, and I know that a computer with a wireless card can stream it's audio to an iPhone, but can a computer without a wireless card (on an ethernet connection) use this or a similar service to send audio to an iPhone? Maybe even a tethered iPhone, because I can do that.\n\nA: maybe look into airfoil and its iOS companion app?\n", "Q: Why won't my iCal calendars display in the same window? For a while (long enough that I almost finished writing a very long SE question about it), I thought Google Calendar wasn't syncing with iCal. Then, I realized that it in fact was, but all the calendars were cleverly hidden in the Window menu, just above Bring All to Front. If I click one of these, the calendar displays—in its own window. All the events are there, but ry as I might, I can't get any two calendars to display in the same iCal window! It's very irritating.\n\nA: Having them show up as delegates is okay, but it's nicer if they show up with the other Google calendars, and that also makes for a better experience on an iOS device. To do that, go to https://calendar.google.com/calendar/syncselect (which isn't linked anywhere from the main Google Calendar settings page, even after many years), and check the boxes for all of the Other Calendars you want exported.\nI feel like I rediscover this secret every few years.\n\nA: Google calendars other than your default calendar are treated as delegated calendars by iCal. To get them to open in the main screen go to iCal > Preferences > Accounts, select your google account, click the tab for Delegation, then check the boxes next to the calendars you want to display in your main calendar window.\nNow in the upper left hand corner of the iCal window, click the Calendars button which brings up the pop-up allowing you to select which calendars are visible. Check the box for the calendars you want to view. You can return to this pop up at any time to change the calendars you're seeing at any given time.\n\n", "Q: Splitting an iTunes Library \nPossible Duplicate:\niTunes videos on a different harddrive? \n\nI have read several articles online about the most efficient means of splitting an iTunes library across multiple drives, unfortunately none seems efficient and some that I have tried do not work as advertised.  So I thought I would throw this out to this community to see if anyone has a more workable solution... I am running the very latest version of iTunes 10.5.2 on the very latest version of OSX 10.7.2 on a Mac mini that has two 750GB drives.  I need to split Movies from Music/Audiobooks due to the size of my library.  I copied all movies to the second internal drive manually, and deleted them from my library then I unchecked the preference options to keep the folder organized and to copy items when adding to the library but each time I try to drag the Movies back into iTunes it seems to be copying them onto  the primary drive as if I hadn't unchecked the options.  What the .... ?  Anyway can someone tell me what the secret incantation is to do this split?  This is RIDICULOUS and I know this is not the first time someone has run into a disk size limitation for an iTunes library. Apple really needs to address this in some straightforward manner!\n\nA: I have all my movies on an external hard-drive as well. There's an easy fix:\nDelete all movies from the library, but keep the option for automatic organization checked, so iTunes manages your music etc.\nNow drag all your movies from the second drive to the iTunes sidebar over the Movies folder. Press and hold the 'alt'-key and release the mouse. This created links to all your movies. You need to organize the Movies-folder by hand, but that's not that bad.\nSee also this question: iTunes videos on a different harddrive?\n", "Q: How does iOS 5 decide which home screen to put new icons on? I currently have an iPad running iOS 5. There are three home screens, which, for simplicity, I'll call A, B, and C. \nA has 7 apps and one folder.\nB has 9 apps.\nC has 10 apps, one folder, and newsstand (whether that's an app or a folder I don't know).\nWhenever I install a new app from the app store, it installs on B. If I move a bunch of apps from C to B so B is full, the new app installs on C. \nIt seems like apps will never install themselves on A. Is this correct?\n\nA: Screen A that you refer to is the original 'Apple' home screen. Your observation is correct. The only time an app will install on screen A is when it is already present (or moved by you) and you are updating to a newer version of the app.\nAll other new apps will be installed in the screen closest to what you define as Screen A when possible (i.e. if Screen B is already full, it will go to screen C and so forth). New apps will never get installed into folders (unless you update the app that is already within a folder)\n", "Q: iOS 5.0.1 (iPhone 4s) unable to synchronize with Internet Calendar File (ics) I make use of an ics file that is hosted on my own iron on the Internet for various reasons, most importantly that I make use of Tasks, which Google Calendar is unable to synchronize with any WebCal client.\nAs for WebCal clients, I make use of Mozilla Sunbird on my main Windows workstation, Mozilla Lightning in my eMail clients, and iCal on my Mac laptop. I am able to use that single ics file to keep them all updated with not only events but also tasks (which, as I said, Google Calendar cannot do).\nI host on my own iron. I run and operate my own servers under my own static IP address. I have a number of domain names pointing toward it, so it hosts web sites. I have created a single WebDav account in a directory on the “catch-all” http account (which is used to display a generic message if there is no website set up for that domain name). Any web browser or device is free to download the ics file, but the directory itself is password protected so that WebDav updates cannot be done by anyone except me.\nAll my WebCal clients can connect to the file, and can update it without fail, except the Calendar app on iOS/iPhone. iCal on Mac OS X 10.6 is also able to synchronize (read AND write to the file), so I know it isn’t an Apple-specific problem.\nI am running a brand-new iPhone 4s, which is updated to the latest iOS 5.0.1. It is NOT jailbroken.\nIf I bring up the url in Safari using a standard http:// connection, it asks to import the entries -- but this is NOT what I want. I want to be able to synchronize with the ics file, and NOT just have a one-way import. I want to make entries in my Calendar app, and have the changes come up on my workstation under Mozilla Sunbird -- and that requires synchronization, not importation.\nIf I replace the http:// in Safari with webcal://, I get a “Cannot Subscribe. Could not subscribe to the calendar X from Y”.\nIf I go into Settings, go into “Mail, Contacts, Calendars” and add a new Subscribed Calendar, this also fails. Putting in the full url causes an error message, “Calendar Subscription: Unable to verify account information”. This is particularly confusing because my ics file is freely downloadable by ANY internet-connected client, be it web browser, WebCal client or anything else that can make use of an http connection. My iPhone is the first ever client that has been unable to access the file.\nIf I select OK I can put in some more information, but adding the username and password does nothing to improve the situation (SSL does not exist on my server, and is turned off by default anyhow in these settings).\nSo I am very badly confused. I would like to have my iOS Calendar synchronize itself with my Internet-hosted ics file so that I can make both events as well as tasks on my iPhone and have these items show up on any other device that I have a WebCal client set up on. How do I go around doing this?\n\nA: Same issue for me.\nA workaround is to copy paste the http:....\\file.ics to your Safari, then the process works. But it's not user-friendly; I also want to tap on the link in my email, and then have it automatically update my calendar.\n", "Q: Can iCloud stream my library on a 8GB iPod Touch? I'm considering getting an iPod Touch for my car exclusively. Will iCloud allow the 8 GB version to play my entire library?\n\nA: iCloud on it's own will not provide any library functions, the closest chance you have is if your car is in range of your Wifi network and you occasionally Wifi Sync it from iTunes.\nOtherwise, your other opinion is iTunes Match. You can use this to allow your iPod to download any songs in your library (with just a few caveats) for playback on the iPod touch. Note that you can download a song by tapping the cloud icon, but tapping normally on an un-downloaded song will download it and stream/play it at the same time.\nThis means that you have limited effectiveness of updating your iPod touch, as you will only be able to do so when near a Wifi Access Point. You will always have access to downloaded files no matter your network state, of course.\n", "Q: Are the latest iPod Nanos running iOS? The current version of the iPod Nano looks a lot like it is running the iOS. Is it actually running a scaled-down version of the software on the iPhones, or is it just a themed version of the classic iPod software? \n\nA: According to this article, an Apple spokesman stated that the touch-screen iPod Nano does not run iOS.\n", "Q: How can i adjust volume of my tracks with those in the iCloud? I recently activated iTunes Match for my music collection. Before that I had regained volume of all tracks to a quite low level. I use MP3Gain on windows with the default setting of \"89\".\nOn my PC/iTunes and on my iPhone I activated \"sound check\". iTunes has calculated the value for sound check. And it seems that the songs are level. However -- most of the songs on my PC are not yet updated from the cloud, they are still the originals. Maybe this is the reason why they are level.\nWhen i play music with the iPhone the volume is very changing. I have loud songs (those which were matched) and I have very silent songs (those that needed to upload to the cloud).\nThis is very annoying. What can I do? Why does sound check not work on the iPhone? I would be content with regaining my songs to a higher level. But to wich one? And can I re-upload the updated files to the cloud?\nQuestions and questions ... any hints very much appreciated.\nEdit: In the meantime I found out to wich level I must set my own songs. In MP3Gain the setting is \"97\". But this does not help very much because I am not able to re-upload songs to iCloud. Even if I delete a song from iTunes Match and make iTunes add it afterwards the song is not re-uploaded. It seems that the iCloud does not delete songs immediately and it does not recognize that a file has changed. The track will only be re-activated (or undeleted) with the old level. Sad, sad.\n\nA: iTunes will not read the tags that MP3Gain uses to set the volume. iTunes stores Sound Check volume information in the iTunNORM tag.\nIf all of your music is in MP3 format, you could try qNormal.\nHowever, if you've enabled iTunes Match and have a mix of MP3 and AAC files, you could try the commercial product beaTunes. It has a Windows version.\nBoth applications claim to calculate the appropriate volume using the open source ReplayGain algorithm that MP3Gain also uses.\n", "Q: What does the \"aapl,panic-info\" output from \"nvram -p\" mean?

What does this mean? Should I be worried, as the word 'panic' implies?\n\nA: The line panic-info is the details of the last kernel panic registered and stored by the system.  If you do a PRAM (or NVRAM) reset, those details will be removed.\nFor example, I just ran nvram -p and I had no panic-info line because I did a PRAM reset since my last kernel panic.  I can't even remember the last time I had a kernel panic.\nHope that clears it up for you.\n", "Q: How to publish magazines (in PDF format) to Apple Newsstand? We're interested in publishing our magazines to Apple's Newsstand and we're wondering how we would go about doing this?\nI've read you need a developer kit (which we don't have), is there a way to just publish the magazines without this?\n\nA: If you do not have a dev kit you can use other companies who build, release and manage subscriptions.\nOne such comapny is Woodwing \nHowever these options are generally very expensive. You are better off (if you can create and develop the product yourself) purchasing the SDK license ($99 per year) or failing that you can use Adobe software to publish the Newsstand Magazine but that costs about $500\nThere is more information on Newsstand here\n\nA: Among the various solutions you can choose from, there's iTablo that does exactly what you're looking for: iTablo site\n\nA: It's not a watered down solution, but rather one that takes a different approach to the problem. You can use Brainiac Publishing to port your magazines to iOS (disclosure - I'm a founder). \nThe service has minimal upfront costs (starts at $10 a page) with all other fees tied to downloads and sales — that's 30% of sales to Apple, 10% to Brainiac, and a download fee of $.20 tied to Adobe DPS. The creation of the Newsstand app, design template, etc. are all done without cost to the publisher. So, publishers clear 40% on $.99 publications and 50% on $1.99 publications. (If you're free, you pay $.30 per download.)\nThe only caveat is that distribution (or projected distribution) has to be reasonably high since it's a back end revenue model — no back end, no revenue.\n\nA: You can also have a look at www.lazypub.com (disclaimer: I am a founder).\nIt is very easy to publish PDFs in your own branded newsstand app and even enhance those PDF files with interactive elements (videos, mp3 files, image galleries, URLs) without any programming skills. LazyPub allows you to create Newsstand applications with all newsstand-related features (subscriptions, in app purchases etc)\n", "Q: Can I set Mail to only send from one email address whatever the account?

I want to run a web server on my Mac as a non-root process. Normally only root processes can bind to port 80 (or to any port below 1024).\nCan I open port 80 specifically so that non-root processes can listen on it?\n\nA: This is difficult to do by design, and unless you have root access to your machine none of the following will work as they require root to setup the changes.  Once changed, though, userspace programs will have access without having root.\nThere are two common ways to accomplish this, and which you choose will depend on why you're trying to work around the restriction:\nPoint port 80 to another port, such as 8080\nBy reconfiguring your machine to pass all port 80 traffic to port 8080, or any port of your choosing, then you can allow user space servers to receive root privilege ports in the area they are given access to.\nThe process is straightforward:\n\nStep 1: View current firewall rules.\nsudo ipfw show\n\nStep 2: Add port forwarding rule (80 to 8080)\nsudo ipfw add 100 fwd 127.0.0.1,8080 tcp from any to any 80 in\n\nIf you want to remove your firewall rules run:\nsudo ipfw flush\n\n\n(source)\nThis is a temporary change, and will revert once you reboot, or flush as indicated int he last line.\nYou can make the change permanent, or you could add the command as a startup line prior to starting your server, which is probably safer from the standpoint of security.\nUse Authbind\nAuthbind was designed specifically to allow one program access to lower level ports without giving it full root access.\nThere is a MacOSX port:\nhttps://github.com/Castaglia/MacOSX-authbind\nIt may still be limited to IPv4 traffic, though, so you may have to do some additional investigation to find if it meets your needs\n\nA: You can also use ssh to do port forwarding.  So if you have a server running on 8080, you can forward traffic from port 80.  Here is a script I use, which stops native apache if it's running and forwards traffic:\nforward8080to80.command:\necho \"You may close this terminal and the forwarding will continue.\"\necho \"To stop, kill the ssh process found by `sudo lsof -i ':80' | grep LISTEN`\"\nsudo apachectl stop\nsudo ssh user@127.0.0.1 -L 80:127.0.0.1:8080\n\n\nA: You can use ncat to forward traffic from a web server running on some other port:\nsudo ncat -l -p 80 -c ' ncat -l -p 1234'\n\nThis will forward traffic on port 80 to localhost:1234. This is a bit of a kludge however, I wouldn't use it anywhere beyond quick testing and definitely not in production.\nNote that this won't allow a non-root process to bind to it, but by picking a port the process can bind to, 1234 in this example, it will look like it is bound to port 80. This is doing the equivalent of forwarding port 80 to port 1234 with a firewall, but on a far more temporary basis.\n\nA: The setuid method is the only thing I found that works on OS X Catalina (10.15).\nFor example, to run npm run serve --port 80 effectively, you would run\nsudo chmod u+s $(which npm).\n\nA: What you should be able to do is open port 80 on your router and point it to the local IP address of your web server. Then on your Mac, enable Web Sharing from the System Preferences>Sharing preference pane and point it to the directory of your choosing. This has worked for me in the past until switched over to 10.6 Server.\n", "Q: How to resume normal iPhone volume after notification causes volume to lower volume mode? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to resume normal iPhone volume after notification causes volume to get stuck in lower volume mode? \n\nHow to resume normal iPhone volume after notification causes volume to get stuck in lower volume mode?\n\nA: If my understanding is correct about what you're asking, I don't think this is supposed to happen. When I am playing music (regardless of whether it's through headphones or speaker) and get a text/push/alarm, etc., the music volume will lower temporarily to allow the alert to be heard. As soon as the alert is over, the volume returns to normal.

I want to repair permissions of a user defined directory along with it's subdirectories. How can I do this?\nSo far, I've looked for options in finder and tried to drag the folder into Disk Utility. But none of my ideas brought success.\n\nA: Repairing permissions only affects System files, and files installed from a package with the Installer, which give a BOM (Bill Of Materials, stored in the (~)/Receipts folder) that list the expected permissions. There is no meaning in repairing permissions for “a specific directory“, as an arbitrary directory has no expected permissions against which to compare, unless it is one listed in one of the said files.\n(just for sourcing: Wikipedia agrees  ;)  )\n\nIf you want to change permissions of a lot of files at once, for example by having copied them from another drive with permissions, and you encounter problems with them, you could use a tool such as BatchMod  :)\n\nA: The act of \"repairing permissions\" is a very specific system-level only process. There is nothing in the UNIX-like world (such as BSD, which OS X is based on) that defines what a \"correct\" permission is. According to a Genius I spoke with at my local Apple Store, there is simply some file that lists important system files/folders, and clicking \"Repair Disk Permissions\" simply applies the appropriate permissions on the contents of that list.\nClient file permissions have no \"correct permission\" because they can be whatever you want to achieve.\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, you're attempting to reset the permissions on a user's home directory. This is easily accomplished by resetting ACLs on the desired home directly by using the Reset Password utility in the Recovery Partition:\nRestart your computer from the recovery partition (if running Lion) or the gray disk (if not running Lion). Open Disk Utility and run a permissions repair on your startup volume. After this is complete, close Disk Utility and open Terminal from the Utilities menu. Type in resetpassword and select your user account (NOT System Administrator/root) from the drop down menu. Click the Reset button at the bottom of the window in the Reset home folder permissions and ACLs section. Quit the Password Utility and go back to the main recovery screen. On your keyboard, hit Command+Q and restart your computer.\nIt's very important that you don't hold down the power button to exit the recovery session, or the ACL reset won't occur.\nLet us know how it goes.\n\nA: open a terminal and navigate to the folder in question\nthe command would be as follows\nsudo chown -R user:usergroup ./(file/dir)\ne.g\nsudo chown -R alex:admins .\ndot is the folder in which you opened your terminal\n", "Q: Apple accounts and a workplace Mac?

It can play just about anything you throw at it. It has support for play lists (both building and saving them) but it does not do any organization of your media.

Is there a program for OS X that will allow me to read iBooks without an iOS device?\nI am familiar with calibre, but the main issue here is the DRM.\n\nA: At this time Unfortunately, no.\nThere is no Mac OS X application for iBooks.  You may want to submit a feature request to Apple.\n\nA: OS X 10.9 Mavericks includes an iBooks app that allows you to read any documents - including purchased books or your own pdfs - that you had in iBooks for iOS.\nMavericks is a free upgrade available for the following systems, and was released on 22 October, 2013 through the Mac App Store.\nFrom OS X Mavericks : System Requirements\n\nTo install Mavericks, you need one of these Macs:\niMac (Mid-2007 or later) MacBook (13-inch Aluminum, Late 2008),\n  (13-inch, Early 2009 or later) MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid-2009 or\n  later), MacBook Pro (15-inch or 17-inch, Mid/Late 2007 or later)\n  MacBook Air (Late 2008 or later) Mac Mini (Early 2009 or later) Mac\n  Pro (Early 2008 or later) Xserve (Early 2009)  Your Mac also needs:\nOS X Mountain Lion, Lion, or Snow Leopard v10.6.8 already installed 2\n  GB or more of memory 8 GB or more of available space\n\n\nA: Apple has released an FAQ for iBooks where (as of January 2012), it says under About iBooks and the iBookstore → What are the requirements to use iBooks?:\n\nYou can use iBooks on iPad.

To learn more about DRM and why you cannot read or convert this book in calibre, click here.\n\nApple has not yet provided a method to read these books on a Mac.\nDespite rumor, Thursday's education-related event produced no OSX-based iBooks reader.

I'm curious about whether possible to install OS X on multiple partitions. I am already using several user accounts in one installation, putting different accounts into different installations of OS X.\n\nA: This has nothing to do with Bootcamp. Simply split your hard drive into several partitions with Disk Utility, and run the OS X installer. You will be able to choose whichever partition you want to install onto, and switch between each by pressing ⌥ on startup.\nHowever, please note that this is not compatible with Bootcamp. I.e. you won't be able to have a Windows partition, at least not with Bootcamp (you'd need a solution like rEFIt).\nRegarding whether you'd need to buy OS X again or not: as per the OS X EULA:\n\nThis License does not allow the Apple Software to exist on more than one computer at a time\n\n…which I'd take for “it may exist several times on the same computer at a time”.\n\nI know that's not what you asked for, so I'll keep it as an aside, but I can't resist saying it: this “partitioning” habit really is a switcher thing. There's no need for that under OS X, especially if you fully encrypt each partition (which I'm curious about, by the way).\nThe only reason I personally have two partitions is because I am totally dependent on my machine for my daily work, and I keep another OS in case of system corruption. But I aliased my user folder on the emergency partition to the one on the main drive, as an OS without my data is as useless as no computer. This fear of “a trojan” that would kill your system is irrational, and this setup will cost you much more in terms of maintenance (rebooting, keeping two systems updated in parallel…) than the advantages it will bring.\n\nA: You can run multiple versions of OS X on one drive. I have done it so I could have several versions of OS X available.\nHowever, if the only reason is that you are worried about a trojan etc., then it's not worth it. If a trojan is installed, it will see and it can affect all partitions.\n\nA: As an alternative, you could just have multiple users on the same partition. The \"play\" account (and thus the applications that it runs, including any trojans) may be configured not to have the right to write into the system folders, nor the folders of the \"work\" account.\n", "Q: Is it possible to display the current state of modifier keys? I have a keyboard which is a little flaky, and occasionally one of the modifier keys becomes stuck. Realizing I’ve entered this state often takes a while. Is it possible to display — e.g., in the menu bar or in the style of Sticky Keys — which modifier keys are currently down?\nI don’t need the Sticky Keys functionality, so turning that on wouldn’t seem to be a solution.\n\nA: There is one native solution I can think of, and that's to show the Keyboard Layout window. This can be accessed through the input menu in the menu bar*, and will show you all keys and their current states. A bonus to this for normal circumstances is that you can see where option and shift-option special characters are mapped.\nAnother possible solution involves a third-party app such as Keyboard Maestro. If you create a macro triggered by the press of a modifier key, you can tell it to, say, display a Growl notification with a relevant message. I'm not exactly sure how you'd want to do this, or what exactly you'd want it to do in the first place, but many of these programs have tons of options.\n*To enable this, go to System Preferences > Keyboard > \"Show Keyboard and Character Viewers in menu bar\"\n", "Q: Is there an iOS SMS Texting app that allows parent to get a record of all texting messages?

Often I will realise my iPhone or iPad is about to run out of battery, run around the house looking for a charging cable and plug, and get back just in time to see the screen go black and the little spinner appear.\nIf I plug it into a wall socket it takes about 3-5 minutes (it shows the red battery with power symbol below) to turn back on, but if I plug it into my laptop it understandably takes longer.\nOccasionally once it has finally powered back up the battery percent will be more than 1%. Why hasn't it turned on ASAP?\nAlso if I plug the cable in less than a few second after the screen goes to the spinner, why does it take so long? It just had enough power to function fully, and now I've given it all the power from my socket, how can those few seconds make such a difference?\nMore importantly is there anyway to try and force the device to come back on quicker? (e.g. If your phone is dead and you plug it in because you need to phone 911) it would be nice to know even if there is way to force it to turn on only to the emergency phone screen, and not the full functionality?\n\nA: Like you said in a comment, it's more a software limitation. Even though there's probably some hardware safeguard.\nIf you plug your iPhone a millisecond before it reaches the shutdown limit, then, no harm done, it doesn't need to shut down, power is there to keep the phone running and recharge the battery.\nIf you plug you phone after the shutdown limit, then the limitation is in place to ensure things will go well the next time you power it up. If it allowed to power up the phone any time, then what if it is unplugged while booting. There wouldn't be enough juice for the phone to be fully back on and it would shutdown while booting.\nThat's something that could damage the phone or the OS.\nSo to ensure that this wouldn't happen, Apple probably put the arbitrary 5% limit.\n\nA: This is because any type of rechargable battery needs a small amount of juice to recharge. If you drain the battery completely, it will not be able to charge again. This is true of lithium or regular rechargable batteries. The delay is there to ensure you don't damage the battery. If you were to completely drain regular rechargable batteries and put them in a device that runs on a tiny amount of juice until there is absolutely no charge, they would fail to recharge as well. In fact, I've had this happen. The reason why the delay is so long is because if you were to turn the device back on with a very small charge and ran software (say a 3d game) that uses a lot of power, your device may drain too fast to maintain positive charge and not be able to charge any longer.\n\nA: Well, I can only answer part of your question, and that's the \"Also if I plug the cable in less than a few second after the screen goes to the spinner, why does it take so long?\" part:\nWhen it reaches the \"spinner\" screen, it's already begun the shutdown process. It's not like it's an OK-you-really-need-to-plug-me-in-now-this-is-your-last-chance screen. When it finishes shutting down, then it needs to charge to 5%. Then, you can turn it on.\n\nA: The reason this takes some extra time is that your iOS device will not turn back on from dying completely because it must charge up to 5% first. This is normal. There is no way I am aware of to disable this function. \n\nA: Plug it into your computer and restore it. Another factor for it freezing could be because it has too much info to run at the same time. In other words it has too little memory left to process (which may not be the case - just a possibility). Don't worry. Sometimes things just need to be restored occasionally.\n", "Q: grep syntax issue on Lion I have a text file and looking for the single line bird.

Hope on OS X you will find how to produce the literal CR.\ngrep --color=none \"^bird^M$\"\n\n", "Q: Full screen zoom: follow keyboard focus doesn't work well There's a setting in full screen zoom called 'follow text focus', which is supposed to cause OSX to follow the position of the text caret instead of the mouse pointer when in full screen zoom mode.  \nThe problem is it doesn't work very well.  \nI have a 2 monitor setup for my main Mac, but the second monitor is a wacom cintiq and it is only on when I'm using it to draw.  The rest of the time it's off.  This means that full screen zoom needs to be in \"Continuous\" mode. If you have it in \"Keep cursor in the middle\" mode then the cursor ends up at the edge of my main monitor most of the time, or off it altogether.  \nHowever, the text cursor behaviour can't be influenced at all, and in \"follow text focus\" mode it will just fly off the edge of the monitor, even in apps where following the text focus works.  \nIn Microsoft Word 2011, text focus follow doesn't seem to work at all!\nI'm trying to find some kind of solution that will suit, but am stuck so far.  \nI think if I can get OSX to act as if the cintiq isn't even attached when it's off that might help to some degree.  However, the only way I know of doing that is physically disconnecting either the display's power, or disconnecting the DVI cable.  Neither of these are really an option as the connectors aren't exactly in accessible locations.  If there's some way of getting OSX to go into single monitor mode when the cintiq is off then I'd love to know what it is.  \nEven this wouldn't fix the problem with Word and other apps that don't honour the text focus following.  Is there anything I can do about them?  \n\nA: I can't help you with Word, etc., but here's how to get it to stop recognizing the Cintiq:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences.\n\n*Open the Displays pane.\n\n*Click \"Detect Displays.\"\n\n\nIf the Cintiq is turned off, this should fix it. When you want to re-detect it, simply turn it on and Detect Displays again.\nIf you want a quick way to access Detect Displays, there's a menu bar icon that can be enabled for Displays tools while you're in the same preference pane: Tick \"Show displays in menu bar\" and you can have quick access to that as well as a few other relevant things.\n", "Q: Old MacBook Air 3rd party SSD visibility is temperature dependent 1st gen MacBook Air.. I replaced the failing internal HD with an 3rd party SSD (wasn't hard, but replacing the fan which was also broken was much trickier - pro tip: don't try using a 00 screwdriver on 000 screws). [will update this question with SSD make+model asap]\nProblem: SSD visible on boot only sometimes, and oddly enough, only when the Mac is cold from being carried around outside (where its below 0 C right now). Also, when the Mac is initially cold enough to make SSD visible, it is usable, and can even booted from, even as the Mac is subjected to higher temperatures, until shutdown or sleep.\nA little more history: When first connecting drive, didn't seem to work, but after several disconnections & reconnections during process of replacing the fan (took a few tries since at first I first didn't have correct screwdriver, see pro tip above), SSD suddenly appeared on boot. I used it for about a day, after which I had to disconnect & reconnect again (to finish installing fan since I finally got the correct screwdriver) which made it disappear again. I tried reseating connections several times, then finally gave up for the time being & closed up the case, resigned to use my external HD exclusively. Only a few weeks later did the temperature outside drop allowing me to notice its temperature-dependant, semi-working state.\nQuestion: has anyone ever seen such behaviour? Is it likely to really just be a matter of reopening case and reseating connections even though my repeated attempts at this have failed? (doing it wrong maybe?) Or might there be something trickier I should try?\n\nA: If the original drive works inside the MacBook in any temp, then id say faulty SSD.\nIf not, then faulty MacBook :(\ntemperature based faults are usually categorised as things like dry joints, where solder between two surfaces is not correctly made and the contraction due to cold brings the surfaces in touch and heat creates expansion breaking the connection.\n", "Q: Where can I find a list of MAMPs? I'm looking for a MAMP packaging = Apache + MySQL + PHP bundled together for Mac OS X (which is my OS). Where can I find it? Is there an \"official\" site where I can download it from?\n[ I know that there are Apache and PHP shipped with Mac OS X, but I don't want to use them, because it seems that if I do it, and later upgrade them, I may have trouble in the case Apple provides a system update which reverts or conflicts with my \"manual\" upgrade. Can you confirm that? Here is the link: 1]\n\nA: There are a few, but my favourite is Zend's own, fully integrated hassle free controller\nZend Server Community Edition\n\nA: You could have a look at MAMP (there's a free and commercial version)\n\nMAMP is installed in the typical Mac fashion: very easily. MAMP will not compromise any existing Apache installation already running with your OS X. You can install Apache, PHP and MySQL without starting a script or having to change any configuration files!\nPhilosophy: MAMP was created primarily as a PHP development environment for Macintosh computer and should therefore not be used as Live Webserver for the Internet. In this case, we recommend that you use Mac OS X server with the provided Apache or a Linux server.\n\n\nIncluded programs & libraries\n\n*\n\n*Apache 2.0.63\n\n*MySQL 5.1.44\n\n*PHP 5.2.13 & 5.3.2\n\n*APC 3.1.3\n\n*eAccelerator 0.9.6\n\n*XCache 1.2.2 & 1.3.0\n\n*phpMyAdmin 3.2.5\n\n*Zend Optimizer 3.3.9\n\n*SQLiteManager 1.2.4\n\n*Freetype 2.3.9\n\n*t1lib 5.1.2\n\n*curl 7.20.0\n\n*jpeg 8\n\n*libpng-1.2.42\n\n*gd 2.0.34\n\n*libxml 2.7.6\n\n*libxslt 1.1.26\n\n*gettext 0.17\n\n*libidn 1.15\n\n*iconv 1.13\n\n*mcrypt 2.6.8\n\n*YAZ 4.0.1 & PHP/YAZ 1.0.14\n\n", "Q: Using a company iPad privately My boss has given each employee an iPad 2 with the express permission to use it privately as well as professionaly (take it home, install apps, ...). \nAll iPads are used with the same company-wide Apple ID, so that all devices are automatically synchronised. However, I also have a private Apple ID and I'm wondering how I could get content I purchased with my private ID on my new iPad. While we are allowed to buy non-free apps with the company's apple ID if we pay for them with iTunes store cards, I would rather buy content with my own Apple ID so that I can keep it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to abandon the principle that all company iPads are used with the same ID and still get automatical synchronisation?\n\n*Is it possible to use content purchased with my Apple ID while logged in with another ID?\n\n*Are there any other things which are good to know in my situation?\n\nA: The iPad will allow you to run any app installed on it, no matter what Apple ID it is associated with. You will need to switch to your account when you first download the app, and then switch back. The app will continue to run normally, and if there are any updates you can download them without switching accounts (the App Store will ask for your account's password). I am not sure which account will be used if you try to make an in-app purchase, though, so be careful.\n", "Q: Fake/randomize/delete geolocation in Safari for certain Websites I would like Safari on Mac OS X Lion to send correct geo informations to some websites but not to others. Instead sending correct location data I would like it to send either no location data, faked or random coordinates.\nIs there something to achieve that? Maybe a Safari extensions or a Glimmer Blocker script?\n\nA: I believe Safari will do something like this by default (Mac OS X 10.7.3, Safari 5.2).\nIf you look in the Privacy pane of Safari’s preferences, there’s a panel:\n\nLimit website access to location services:\n\n*\n\n*Prompt for each website once each\n\n*Prompt for each website one time only\n\n*Deny without prompting\n\n\nI believe the first option is the default, so when you visit a page that wants geolocation data in the default setting, you get a panel like this:\n\nIn the default setting, the page will throw up that prompt every time I reload it (so if I click “Allow”, then refresh the page, I get the same prompt).\nIf I select the second option from above (“prompt for each website one time only”), then Safari will throw up that panel once, then remember your choice forever.\nIf you want to learn more, Apple has published two support articles on the topic:\n\n*\n\n*“About Location Services in OS X Lion and Safari 5.1 or later”, http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5009, accessed 9 May 2012.\n\n*“About Location Services in Mac OS X v10.6 and Safari 5.0”, http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4239, accessed 9 May 2012.\n\nHope this is useful.\n\nAddendum: I don’t know of any way to have Safari supply fake location data.\n\nA: One way is to route through a VPN or other proxy in the location you want to \"be\" in.\nOr, use the Tor browser (but it's not Safari).  By default, it routes your traffic through three servers picked at random.  The website will get the location of the third one.  You can reduce the randomness by specifying one or more country codes in a configuration file.\nIf you like the Tor approach but still want Safari, you can install the full Tor package and have it handle all your traffic—just turn it on when you want the re-routing and turn it off afterward.\n", "Q: Order of parameters for command-line tools \nPossible Duplicate:\nCan command-line commands be made insensitive to order of filenames and options? \n\nIt looks like the OS X built-in command line tools, such as ls, du etc are rather strict with regards to the order of parameters.\nTo illustrate, a command for showing disk usage, 'du', accepts -h as a 'human readable' formatting directive for sizes. If you run the following under OS X Lion, this parameter is ignored:\ndu . -h\n\nTo get it to work, you need to specify the parameter fist, then the location, like that:\ndu -h .\n\nComing from Linux (ubuntu) background this seems strange to me - under Ubuntu you can do it either way. This is also becomes quite annoying at times, especially when you realise that you've forgotten to specify a parameter for long command and have to move the cursor to the beginning of it.\nHence is the question: can I change the 'default' behavior of command line tools to be more forgiving? Also, what's the reason for that restriction? A BSD legacy?\n\nA: I believe that handling of the parameter order is compiled into the executable. This would mean you'd have to modify the source code of the program(s) to change this behavior.\n", "Q: Remotely working on iMac, but with screen darkened I have my main iMac in my kids room (little house, alas) and often I have to work late at night; I'd like to connect from my MacBook to the iMac keeping the screen black, as in sleep mode. Is there any sort of magic to achieve this? What if I plug a Mini DisplayPort cable? Will it exclude the monitor?\nThanks,\nGuido\n\nA: You might be overlooking a simpler solution: throw a sheet/blanket/whatever over the display before you walk out of the room.\n\nA: Lion has the ability to do a virtual desktop from one mac to another.\nMaybe the following works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a second user account on the iMac, with 'sleep display'\nproperties set.\n\n*Make that account the active account on the iMac, and wait for it to\ngo to sleep.\n\n*Then use share screen on the MacBook to connect with a virtual\ndesktop to your own account on the iMac.\n\n\nI am not sure the iMac won't wake up when you virtually connect to it, but it's worth a try.\n", "Q: How can I force Mac OS X to treat my Mackie Onyx Blackjack as a mono input device? I have a Mackie Onyx Blackjack audio interface, and my microphone is plugged into the first of two inputs (\"left\"). The other input doesn't have anything plugged into it. What this means is that whenever I record audio in QuickTime, it produces a stereo file with my voice on the left track and silence on the right track. However, Mac OS X sees the device as a 2-channel stereo device, and I can't seem to convince it otherwise.\nHere is a screenshot from Audio MIDI Setup to show what I mean:\n\nThe only thing I can change is the \"Format\" from \"44100.0 Hz\" to \"48000.0 Hz\". Everything else is greyed out.\nI investigated creating an aggregate device, but I see no way to eliminate audio channels from that either. How can I get Mac OS X to see this device as a mono input? \n\nA: \nwhenever I record audio in QuickTime\n\nThis is the problem. QuickTime doesn't offer the ability to change the recording type or to pan inputs to a particular track in the recording when you're making it. It records stereo. And it captures one input left, the other input right. I just tried it out with my Duet and, no matter where I set the pan on the mic input in the Maestro mix console, QuickTime captured that signal input on the left channel only.\nThe solution, I'm afraid, is to stop using QuickTime.\nGarageband, which is likely already on your Mac, will let you capture a mono source and then pan and bounce a master mix with the mono source placed in any location you like in the stereo field. It definitely is a more suitable interface for capturing and manipulating audio than QuickTime.\n", "Q: Is there an alternative to the native file transfer handler in Finder? In Windows you can replace the native file handler with TeraCopy, I was wondering if there were a similar solution in Mac OS X.

Network speed shouldn't be an issue as we are accessing the server using dual ethernet cards (high-end).\nWhat's annoying is that this only occurs on systems running Snow Leopard. Our Lion systems (which dont even have the dual ethernet set-up) have no problem accessing the folder. I've also tested this on SL computers without the dual ethernet and the issue still exists.\nFurthermore, if I open the folder, wait 10 seconds and then scroll around with the mouse, the folder responds fine for a while. But if I click and drag the scroll bar Finder shows the beach-ball again. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to prevent Finder from slowing down when accessing the\nfolder?\n\n*Could it be due to Finder trying to load thumbnails of\nthe video files?\n\n\n(both the Snow Leopard and Lion systems are fully up-to-date - mix of Mac Pros and Mac Minis)\n\nA: Quicklook may want to read the remote files to generate an icon preview, and that on a slow network can be problematic.\nA trick that helps me in similar situations is to uncheck \"Show icon preview\" from menu View -> Show View Options (Command-j)\n\n\nA: I have a similar problem with a network drive that is over ethernet on 10.6.x \nIf the folder has a list of image files that approach 3000 or over, it will slow down the finder.i.e constant beach balling. The only solution is to break the files down into sub folders that have no more than 2000 file each. I also make sure that Calculate all sizes is not on or icon preview.\nThe problem seems to be that the finder is waiting for the ethernet to return the data but is not getting it quickly enough so beach balls. Simliar to when you try and mount a share that is not on the network anymore.\nI suspect it is actually not the finder but the ethernet component on 10.6 that cannot handle either the number of items or the overall data size of the list. \n", "Q: Editor/outliner with Newton-style handwriting input on iPod touch Is there a text editor for the iPod Touch that fills the function of the visionary-but-before-its-time Notes application on the legendary Apple Newton?

Fantastical gets great reviews for this...see Fantastical\n\nA: Gtasks is subpar. The biggest reason I like iOS Reminders is it's one of the best things that SIRI does well. I use it all the time. If gTasks were capable of acting as an intermediary between Reminders and Google Tasks then it might be a good product, but at the end of the day, it's a stand-alone tasks app that does not take advantage of SIRI. This coupled with the deception of listing it as \"free\" on the AppStore but requiring you to pay for it later in-App...not cool. I am all for paying for a good app but give it to me straight.

Take a look at the issue linked below and see if it appears to be a similar scenario. Some of the arm stuff has been known to cause kernel panics and such, so let the developers know of the issues so they can fix them. good luck!\n\n\n*\n\n*[Android emulator / Lion issues]\n\n*[Project Home / Issue List]\n\nA: Did you run an upgrade on the Snow Leopard ??\nIf so just try a fresh lion install. Many people who have had this problem had a well working system after they did a fresh install instead of an upgrade.\nYou should also check your harddrive with diskutil if there are any failures.\nDid you recently add or remove any commonly used usb or bluetooth devices ? Or did you change your hardware configuration ?\n\nA: there are a lot of threads around with issue.\nOne such thread seesm to point to the Blackberry kext (com.rim.driver.BlackBerryUSBDriverInt   0.0.68) as the culprit.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/3506955?start=0&tstart=0\n", "Q: Battery issue with MacBook Pro 13 inch (Early 2011) So, around June 2011 I finally had the chance to buy my first Macbook Pro (13 inches, i5)\nBut recently, I've noticed something wrong with my battery!\nActually with only 2 months of use, I was under Boot Camp doing random stuff when I saw something like \"98% fully charged\" (battery icon in the menu bar)and didn't pay attention to that until now.\nNow, with around 40 cycles, my battery is showing 94/95% (5412-5450 mAh)\nAny ideas? I think my battery is defective =/\n\nA: \nThe built-in battery of your MacBook, MacBook Pro or MacBook Air is designed to deliver up to 1000 full charge and discharge cycles before it reaches 80 percent of its original capacity.\n  Link.\n\nLittle differences in capacity are normal and are no indicator for a defect battery. Only contact Apple when your battery performes worse than the design capacity.\n\nA: It's probably a calibration issue. The easiest way to recalibrate is to leave the MacBook on until it sleeps because of low battery. Leave it off for an hour and then recharge fully (no interruptions and use OSX).  Use CoconutBattery or similar tool to monitor and log your battery status. My prediction is that it'll update the health to at least 98%.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to convert a MacBook Pro from the glossy to the matte option? I have foolishly managed to crack the glass on the glossy screen of my 15 inch Mid 2010 MacBook Pro.\nWhile considering the option to replace the glass, I then remembered I'd always wanted to have the matte (anti-glare) option.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to convert from the glossy to the matte option? Is it as simple as removing the glass and installing a bezel?\n\n*Or are there more parts to the matte screen than this?\n\n*Or is it a completely different LCD panel?\n\n*Are there any other caveats, particularly with respect to the bezels that seem to be available on eBay and the like?\n\n\n\nEdit: Should have mentioned that I already have the high-resolution glossy display.\n\nA: Unfortunately, it is completely different type of display. The antiglare is a higher resolution and has different bezel, so it's not possible to upgrade an existing display, short of using a screen film with it. \nYou would have to get this done through either an Apple Authorized Service Provider (AASP) or an Apple Store. The Apple Store almost definitely will not put something on the MacBook Pro that it didn't come with, but an AASP might. The only way to find out is to ask!\n", "Q: SSH Key Error, sudo works fine When I try to ssh (using ssh user@server.com) into my server at home from either the local network or from outside, I get the following error:\n\nBut if I use sudo ssh user@server.com, it works with no problems:\n\nI'm sure I just need to place some kind of key in that /Users/mattlove/.ssh/known_hosts directory, but I'm not sure how or why.\nAny of you UNIX buffs out there have an answer?\nE D I T :\nHere are the results of running ls -l ~/.ssh/known_hosts as requested by @LoïcWolff\n\n\nA: The known_hosts file contains the keys from hosts which you have previously connected to, and have verified that you have checked the key signature is correct.\nIn your case, one of two things has happened,\n\n\n*\n\n*The key on the server has changed since you approved it for your account, but not since it was approved for the root account.\n\n*There is an attacker intercepting communications between you and the server, and you have approved their key for the root account and have the correct key in your account.\n\n\nMost likely is case 1 - man-in-the-middle attacks on SSH, while possible, are relatively rare.  The warning is there to alert you to the fact that someone may be intercepting you communications, even though the chances of this are quite low.\nTo resolve this, open the known_hosts file and remove the entry for the host in question.  Contact the System Administrator for the host and ask them for the 'Host Key Fingerprint'.  Make your connection again, verify that the fingerprint matches the one you get from the System Administrator and approve the key.\nIf the fingerprint does not match the one supplied by the System Administrator of the remote host, DO NOT approve the key!!\n\nA: The first time you connect to a server, you are prompted to accept the fingerprint for the host you are connecting to. The fingerprint is a combination of a digital signature, the host name and the IP address of the server. When you do accept, the fingerprint is saved in ~/.ssh/known_hosts as being a \"trusted\" host.\nFor some reason, the server's fingerprint has changed since the first time you connected to it. This may be because it is not the server you expect it to be, for example when your request is being intercepted and redirected to a different server. Hence the security warning. The explanation might also be less malicious, for example when the server was replaced/reinstalled without restoring it's previous digital signature, or when the IP address has changed.\nIf despite the security warning, you still trust the server you are connecting to, you should open ~/.ssh/known_hosts and look for the line starting with the address of the server you are connecting to. Remove the entire line and save your changes, then reconnect to the server. The first time you connect, it should again prompt you to accept the updated fingerprint, after which you should have no more troubles connecting to that host.\nThe reason why it would work with sudo is because in those conditions you are running it as a different user (root), and each user has it's own known_hosts file (for root this is located at /private/var/root/.ssh/known_hosts). root may have never recorded the previous fingerprint of that host, and therefor has no way of comparing it to the current one, and no reason to distrust the server.\n", "Q: How do you disable the iOS Storage full alert? I've been getting close to filling up my 16 GB iPhone 4 with iOS 5. I have freed up some space and have 1.5 GB available, but I keep getting alerts that are annoying.\nIs there a way to disable the alert or change the threshold for which it is triggered? Here's what the alert says.\n\n\nA: Apple do not provide any way to stop what it perceives as important alerts.\nThat said, for those with jailbroken phones, popup blocker provides the required functionality\nEdit: the original question is answered in the most part, but i think the real question should be 'Why am i getting the ios Stoage almost full\" alert.\nthis is either a bug, or you've got a lot of mail stored on the phone...\nThere appears to be a few users with the same issue over on the Apple support forums here\n\nA: Definitely a jailbreak issue.  A quick cure would be to, go to notifications; reminders; Alert style: change to none or banners.  I recommend none. Until we get a better fix. \n", "Q: How long does a login to \"Find my Friends\" persist? I understand the purpose of the login is to keep nefarious people who 'obtain' your phone from knowing the whereabouts to your friends.  Does anybody know how long the iPhone keeps the session open after you enter the password?  Is it even user-configurable the time-out period?\n\nA: just a guess:\nAs in the App Store app a session is 15min, I would asume that a session in Find My Friends is also 15 min.\nIf you configured your phone to be locked (need to enter a pin after swipe to unlock), then you don't need to enter a password at all in find my friends [read somewhere, never tested myself].\n", "Q: iPhone 3GS Keeps Rebooting My 3GS keeps having a strange issue, but I think I've found a pattern.\n\n\n*\n\n*First let its battery get low enough to where it turns off on its own\n\n*Recharge it enough to come back on\n\n*After coming back on, every 5 minutes the 3GS just reboots randomly\n\n\nTo fix it, the only thing that works is to do a restore from iTunes (which sucks if the backup is kind of old) \nIt is out of warranty, has anyone had this issue? Would a new battery help? I'm also wondering if jailbreaking it might help to where there is something I can do command line to fix it (I'm proficient with Linux/SSH).\nMy wife uses this phone, and it's hard to get her to keep it charged. I'm running iOS 5.0.1.\n\nA: I had this issue with my Girlfriends iPhone 3G, as you say the only way to resolve is to a restore in iTunes. \nSo are you and your wife running iOS5 or is the 3GS on another version?\nOnce that is done it is worth upgrading (if you haven't already) and make the iPhone sync with iCloud and store your backup there. This way if it happens again you can easily restore to an up to date version.\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Does OSX have a \"plug & play driver\" concept? Windows when it detects an unsupported device, it requests a driver from the user. Does OSX have a place when I can find information on unrecognised devices?\n\nA: For local devices/services you can use the System-Profiler to check all available devices in your computer. Most devices are directly supported through Apple and thus you don't have to install any drivers. For some 3rd party tools like external Audio/Video systems you may have to install the drivers supplied with the tools, but you should be able to discover the devices through the System-Profiler.\nFor devices and services available through the network Apple has developed a plug and play system called Bonjour. It allows zeroconf of e.g. printers and file-sharing services. There is a 3rd pary tool called Bonjour Browser which is advertised to be able to discover all services/devices available through Bonjour. I never used the software and can't comment on how well it works.\n", "Q: Faulty iPhone 4S battery - how can I test a battery to measure its integrity? I bought an iPhone 4S two months ago. In the last couple of days I've perceived an average battery life of 12 to 18 hours with a light usage of the phone throughout the day.\nI've followed every tip for battery preservation such as turning off Location services, I don't use Siri, I only download e-mails manually to the phone (no push or notifications), I set the auto brightness on, I try to keep only a few important applications running in background.\nI would like to visit my carrier's technicians in order to get a replacement, but I would prefer to run some tests first to make sure that something's wrong with the battery.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I have always liked to test a battery by running the device until it shuts down and powers off.\nWhen you connect it to the standard wall charger, it should take between 2 and 4 hours to charge. If your battery is done charging in an hour to 1:30, then it's not really getting the intended amount of current and should be replaced.\nSimilarly, if it won't charge fully (or very much close to full) in less than 4 hours - something also is amiss either with the charging, measuring or battery itself.\nBy timing the charge time, you eliminate any background task, GPS, WiFi drain, etc.. and just can see the time it takes a fixed amount of current to enter the battery and be stored chemically.\n\nA: Firstly, there are known issues that result in extremely poor battery performance with the 4S. Apple has addressed some of these issues in the iOS 5.0.1 update, but for many, the issues still exist. Worse yet, reports indicate that 5.1 (currently in beta) have not isolated the problem.\nThe battery problems are software related, not hardware. With that said, should you wish to test the hardware, I'd suggest taking to an Apple Store. If they do find a fault, they'll replace the device for you then and there. I'm not sure about your carrier's policies or level of customer service, but I doubt they'll be up to the same standards as Apple. \nIf they don't find fault with the hardware, you can call 1-800-MY-APPL and ask to talk to an iPhone product specialist. Ask them if you could join the battery testing group. Individuals are provided with a special diagnostic utility that transmits battery usage details back to Apple. Typically individuals are selected at random, but if you press the issue, they may allow you to join. \n\nA: I believe it's pretty easy if you've jailbroken it, but for those who don't want to go there, there's an app called 'iBackupBot' for windown and mac, by a company called iCopyBot. It has a free trial and allows you to measure the current battery capacity, they have a guide here: http://www.icopybot.com/blog/check-ipad-iphone-battery-charge-cycle-count-without-jailbreaking.htm. \nIt worked for me with an iPhone 5, iOS 6.1.4- you do have to quit itunes and unlock the device for it to work.\n", "Q: Gmail App on iPhone 4S doesn't complete entire \"Push\" of email So the Gmail app on my iPhone 4S notifies me with a badge that says I have 1,2,3...n unread messages.  In true push format, when an email is sent to the account it notifies me fairly quickly, but when I click into the app it still has to download them so it's a bit of a pain to have to wait the 2-10 more seconds to able to READ the actual email.\nIs this the way it's designed or is there a setting I'm forgetting about?\n\nA: No, it was designed that way.\nThe only notification are the badge and the sound.\n\nBut only Mail can push notify you and download the message in the background. For App Store app, you'll have to open them for the mail to be downloaded.\n", "Q: Where do I look in iTunes to find sync errors? I have started to get some error messages about items failing to sync. It seems to be a sporadic issue - and the error pictured below was for a sync attached to the USB cable. I do have WiFi sync enabled for this device and it also happens when I'm syncing wirelessly, so the presence or absence of the cable seems to be unrelated to the error.\n\nOpening iTunes on iOS doesn't seem to tell me what failed. The same goes for iTunes on my Mac. Does anyone have a clue where \"more information\" is logged in this case? Although many are suggesting ways to eliminate the error (trial and error), I'm more interested in where the error log lies. It baffles me there isn't some debug more or way to hook into iTunes to get a log of the problems.\nWhere else can I look for this information relating to sync errors?\n\nA: I had the error again this morning - three items failed to sync.\nI do finally have a potential culprit. The presence of App store updates seems to correlate with these errors. It fits all the criteria so far that come to mind. \n\n\n*\n\n*temporary and sporadic (most of the time, I'm not in the process of downloading apps while syncing and even with simultaneous downloads, my internet is such that this is generally a 1-10 second window or less per app)\n\n*resolves itself without needing user intervention\n\n\nI've poked at this several times and it doesn't seem to correlate with the sync errors in a pattern that I can detect. \nThe only explanation I can guess is that there is no log where these errors are collected.\n\nA: Leave your device plugged into the computer.  There should be a little alert icon next to the device name in iTunes.  Click on that to see what the actual problems were.  Information from: See iTunes for more information\nIn my experience, updating my apps and re-syncking has cleared the warnings.\n\nA: If there's an error log I don't know where it is, but I can suggest some things to look for in your iTunes Library:\n\n\n*\n\n*Videos encoded in a format that won't work on the iPhone. (This might\nalso be caused by a video podcast encoded in an incompatible format).\n\n*.psd (Photoshop Document) files (in your photo library) \n\n*Purchased media or apps registered to an Apple ID for which the iOS device\nisn't authorized.\n\n\nHappy hunting.\n\nA: The last couple of times that this happened to me (also syncing via USB) I wasn't able to find anything in the console or logs... The I noticed that there was little room let in my device, so before syncing again I removed some data (a couple apps), then tried the sync again and it worked fine with no warnings at all. \n", "Q: Facebook app shuts down itself on iPhone 4 I have an iPhone 4. The Facebook application was working fine until this morning. When I start the Facebook app, it shuts down immediately. I tried restarting the phone but it's the same. No jailbreak, no unlock. My phone is 9 months old.\n\nA: Try uninstalling the app, restarting your phone, and reinstalling it from the App Store. This should resolve the issue.\n", "Q: iTunes: Why do some internet radio streams show up in my main music list and some do not? I'm setting up a fresh iTunes library, and I'd like to have a playlist with some internet radio stations.  However, I'm seeing inconsistent behavior with how these are being handled in iTunes 10.  When I add The Current MP3 stream to a playlist, it does not show up in my main music list, however, when I add the BBC Radio 6 it does show up in the music list, not matter how I add it (dragging from the radio list directly, or adding the URL via Advanced > Open Stream).\nWhy are these streams treated differently?  How can I prevent the BBC stream from showing up in the main music list (like The Current stream currently does)?\nI'm using iTunes 10.5.2 (11) 64-bit on Lion\nThe Current MP3 stream url (Added via Advanced > Open Stream):\nhttp://minnesota.publicradio.org/tools/play/streams/the_current.pls\nBBC Radio 6 stream url (got the URL from the iTunes radio list):\nhttp://bbcmedia.ic.llnwd.net/stream/bbcmedia_lc1_6music_p?s=1326827601&e=1326842001&h=81a3810c662b7c85a3d24d7aa24ac120\n\nA: I tried both streams like you did and at first I received the same results you did. BBC Radio 6 showed up in the music but The Current didn't appear to.\nThen, I tried typing \"The Current\" into the iTunes search box while Music was selected in the sidebar. The result: The Current from Minnesota Public Radio pops up as the first and only search result in the iTunes main menu. \nWhat I believe it that because this radio listing contains a blank album and artist field, iTunes gets a bit confused but ends up placing them \"somewhere\" amongst your other entries with blank album and/or artists fields. It can appear to be lost there because there doesn't appear to be any particular order those entries are sorted by-default. (I am almost certain you can do something about that if you really wanted.)\nIF you are still interested in seeing your music with those streams, I would recommend just creating a smart playlist that excludes them. Try this a the rule to use in the smart playlist (Cmd-Opt-N to bring up its dialog, btw):\n\"(Kind) (is not) (Internet audio stream)\"\n\nHope this was helpful.\n-b\n\nA: I think I figured it out: if you add a link to a pls file and then leave the entry in the playlist that iTunes creates, the new stream will not show up in the music list.  If the stream isn't a pls file or you try to move it, it will show up as a song in the main music list.\n", "Q: How to install Mac OS X upon NTFS partition with Win XP on it?

If it does, then you will need to look at getting your DNS reconfigured.\nIf the behaviour continues then it may be malware but honestly I can't think of a single one that would do this.\n\nA: I'd check your proxy settings too (click on Advanced after you select the interface you're using, then the tab labeled Proxies). You should only see *.local, 169.254/16 in the bottom box, and none of the boxes should be checked (unless you use a proxy, in which case you probably know what is what).\n", "Q: Is iBooks Author suitable for producing poetry? in terse terms:\n\npoets\n       craft \n              lines.\n\neBook readers wrap \n    witlessly\n\nWill Author for iBooks let us read\n\"Achilles' baneful wrath resound, O Goddess, that impos'd\nInfinite sorrows on the Greeks, and many brave souls loos'd\nFrom breasts heroic, sent them far to that invisible cave\nThat no light comforts, and their limbs to dogs and vultures gave;\nTo all which Jove's will gave effect, from whom first strife begun\nBetwixt Atrides, king of men, and Thetis' godlike son.\" \n\ninstead of\n\"Achilles' baneful wrath resound, O Goddess, that impos'd\nInfinite sorrows on the Greeks, and many brave souls loos'd\nFrom breasts heroic, sent them far to that invisible cave\nThat no light comforts, and their limbs to dogs and vultures gave;\nTo all which Jove's will gave effect, from whom first strife begun\nBetwixt Atrides, king of men, and Thetis' godlike son.\" \n\nA: Yes. Actually, what iBooks Author excels at is letting you format your text precisely, with elaborate styles and style sheets, and preventing the user from changing the font, point size, or theme. You get tremendously precise formatting and layout, and the user can't change anything at all in landscape orientation, while they can scale font size a bit in portrait orientation.\nHere's the main drawback that I have just discovered myself: iBooks Author will only output books that can be read on an iPad with iOS 5 running the new iBooks 2.0. The book you create with iBooks Author cannot be read on an iPhone or iPod Touch or anything running iOS 4.2.1 or iBooks 1.0.\nSecondly, the file size of a book that is all text (no illustrations) is HUGE. I'm talking 20 times as large as it should be. I've tested it. A book that was 900K in size created with other tools becomes 20MB in size when created in iBooks Author.\n\nA: Everthing Wheat Williams said is spot on, but it's also worth noting that the EULA, found under iBooks Author » About iBooks Author » License Agreement states\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\n  If you charge a fee for any book or other work you generate using this software (a “Work”), you may only sell or distribute such Work through Apple (e.g., through the iBookstore) and such distribution will be subject to a separate agreement with Apple.\n\nSo if you're planning to sell this poetry you typeset, you've placed some substantial limits on yourself. Just to be aware.\n", "Q: Where can I find a user forum for the brand-new Apple iBooks Author application? Apple has just released the free \niBooks Author\napplication for Mac OS X 10.7 Lion. Where can I find some information about its capabilities. Yes, this is a \"Jeopardy\" question.\n\nA: There is a new Apple Support Forum for iBooks Author\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/community/mac_app_store/ibooks_author\n\nA: This is not a direct answer to your question, but it does offer places to find information about its capabilities. I found this collection of links so useful, therefore I want to share it here:\nSupport Documents for iBooks Author\n\n*\n\n*Publishing and distribution FAQ\n\n*Use iPad-safe fonts when authoring books\n\n*How to make your iBooks accessible\n\n*Best practices for using 3D models\n\n*About the Keynote widget\n\n*Add video to your iBooks\n", "Q: How do I install a Theme in Keynote? I just downloaded several themes that I want to use. They are in /Library/Application Support/Keynote/Themes/ but I don't see them in the Theme Chooser screen. \nDoes anyone know what else I should be doing to install them?\nThanks!\n\nA: When you open a template or a common keynote file, you can use the option File → Save theme...\nThis puts your file in the necessary directory automatically and adds information about your theme to the welcome screen.\n\nA: Typically they should be in: \n~/Library/Application Support/iWork/Keynote/Themes/\n\nYou can copy yours there and they should show up; or when choosing a theme you can add them by navigating to the folder yours are in:\n\n\nA: This is different in Keynote '09.  The method I found that works comes from https://discussions.apple.com/message/8789217#8789217\n\nIt appears Apple has changed the way Keynote '09 accesses Themes.  If\n  you leave your 3rd party themes the way they were, Keynote '09 can't\n  seem to handle it and the theme chooser does not open or work\n  properly.\nApple's standard themes are now imbedded in the package contents of\n  Keynote. (if you don't know what that means, don't worry. For those\n  that care opt click show package contents ...\n  Keynote>contents>resources>themes). You will have to find the third\n  party themes you want to use. They may be located in the library >\n  application support folder > iWork > Themes or somewhere like that\n  depending upon how you set it up before.\nOnce you find the themes, I suggest moving them to a place like the\n  desktop or your documents folder.\nOnce that has been done, Quit Keynote. Find the theme you want to\n  \"import\" Double click on it. Keynote '09 should open. Once it is open,\n  go to File>Save Theme.... you will be presented with the option to\n  name the theme and store it in a folder here\n  HD>Users>Home>Library>Application Support>iWork>Keynote>Themes.\nOnce you have saved it, quit keynote. Open Keynote and go to the theme\n  chooser. Your new \"imported\" theme will be at the bottom after all of\n  the Apple standard themes.\nRepeat for each theme you want to import.\n\nThat might be overkill, but it did work for me.\n", "Q: loginwindow process out of control I have an early 2010 27\" iMac that is the family computer.  It has 5 user accounts on it. (Not sure if this is relevant or not).\nOften times I'll come home and the login screen won't appear.  Usually I can ssh in from my MBP and kill that process and everything works.\nThis time, however, I see that there's a few hundred loginwindow processes running, and I can't kill them.  Doing a ps ax | grep loginwindow | wc -l told me there was 829 of them!\nIt started with a frozen screensaver.  I killed the ScreenSaverEngine process and it brought me to a stuck login screen.\nI'm guessing there is a severe software conflict on the machine, but I am not sure how to diagnose this.  It is certainly frustrating to have to power off the machine.\nAny ideas on what I should do to fix this issue?  How would I begin to figure out the root  cause?\n\nA: Alright these are the olden goldies for fixing stuff like that:\n1) Repair Permissions:\nThis is often a bit of a sacrificial chicken but in this case it could very well be that something has caused the permissions on the login database or an associated file to end up corrupted.\n2) Verify the disk:\nIt's unlikely to be a disk problem but whilst you're in there you might as well clear that off.\nIf they don't do the trick once you're logged back in go to Console in Utilities and post the log files up here, there might be some useful information in them.\n\nA: I don't know if this is your problem but, there's a known issue I've seen on my iMac with multiple accounts that are set to automatically log out. The last screen image will appear frozen. A mouse swipe will show squares of a login screen underneath that appears to be rewritten with the mouse swipes. What I do is from the keyboard, start typeing the characters of the user you wish to log in and the relevant part of the login screen appears. From there just login as usual.\nMay be similar to Scrape away screen layer.\n\nA: What version of the OS?  Any recent software or hardware changes?\nCan you replicate the problem if you perform a safe boot?\nI'd probably next try emptying all system, local, and user caches with something like Lion Cache Cleaner - I'd avoid AppleJack or Onyx as they often install components to the system that may further complicate troubleshooting.  I'd probably also try re-applying the Combo Updater for whatever version of the OS you're using.\nAnd, as always, verify that your backups are running and usable..\n", "Q: Apple TV and sites like VideoBB/Screen mirroring/Flash? So lately I've been watching online videos on VideoBB and similar sites, and I'm wondering if I can do this on the Apple TV?\nAlso, is it possible to mirror my screen to the AppleTV and show Safari, so to play the videos right from there? So far I've looked at...\n\n\n*\n\n*AirFlick - No audio\n\n*AirDisplay - No audio...\n\n*ClickToPlugin - Does not work on the VideoBB, \"killer\" doesn't work.\n\n\nI'm hoping there's another solution for playing these videos on the AppleTV. If I need to, I will choose a different device, but I would rather stick with the AppleTV for the pretty flawless system that comes with it.\nAlso, and I'm guessing this is a no, does the AppleTV run flash videos? What about a jailbroken one? Would it be possible to go to VideoBB on a jailbroken AppleTV and just watching the videos through the browser (not sure if one if included with Boxee, Plex, or XBMC).\n\nA: No, a non-jailbroken Apple TV does not display Flash videos.\nI've resorted to downloading videos and converting them to MP4 for the ATV.\n", "Q: Automatically delete temporary ~/Library/Application Support folders I have a flash drive which I carry around everywhere which has a few standalone applications which I use everywhere installed on it. However, the majority of these leave Application Support folders behind, and I don't want to give other people access to any of my information, etc.\nIs there any way to automatically delete these folders either just before or just after I remove my flash drive? I've tried writing an Automator workflow to do this, and it works, but it feels very kludgy.\nAlso, most specifics that I've said are flexible; I just want something that will do the job 100% of the time.\n\nA: I suggest you use a guest account on OS X if you want certain home directory files automatically erased for you. A guest account's home directory gets cleaned up when you log out.\nFrom http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.7/en/mh35549.html:\n\nImportant: Files created by a guest user are deleted when the user logs out. A temporary home folder is created for the guest user’s files, but this folder and its contents are deleted when the user logs out.\n\n\nA: I know you already tried writing an Automator workflow for this, but this is probably the best way to do it. Can you post what you did for your workflow?\nWhat I would suggest is creating an Application in Automator and use the \"Run Shell Script\" action. For the command, use rm ~/Library/Application\\ Support/* and this will delete all files inside the Application Support folder. Now, this is going to delete ALL Application Support files...even the user's your logged into. \nIf you want to avoid this, you can do one of two things. The easiest would be just use the guest account of that computer like @bneely suggests. \nYou can also set up more than one shell script to delete only the directories that you specify. For example if you're transporting CoRD.app around with you, you could add the action rm -rf ~/Library/Application\\ Support/CoRD and add another action for each application you use. It's a little tedious, but effective.\nLet me know if you need further assistance setting it up.\n", "Q: How to select Target mode with only one monitor I have hooked a new Mac Mini up to my monitor but want to migrate data from my old Mac Mini to the new one but only have one monitor and Migration Assistant requires that I start the old one up in target mode. With only one monitor. How can I start that old one up in Target mode so the new one can recognize it?\n\nA: You don't need to plug a monitor into your old Mac Mini.  Just power it on while holding down the T key and it will go into target disk mode.\n", "Q: Is the iOS Voice Memos built-in app appropriate for recording an hour-long interview? I have been sufficiently impressed with the sound quality of the voice memos app on my iPhone.\nI'm planning to interview several of my family members for up to an hour at a time. I have a 4th generation iPod Touch which I plan to use for recording. Does anyone know of any reasons why the voice memos app would not be up to the task?\nI will have the device plugged in to power, and on a table in the middle of the two or sometimes three people speaking. I'll do some math to ensure that I have enough free space on the device beforehand. I have the 64GB iPod Touch.\n\nA: There are various records (/1, /2) saying that since iOS4 there's no limitation in size any more. My suggestion: put the iPod on the table, run the voice recorder and see how long it goes and if the process of importing to the computer works fine.\n\nA: The only reason it would not last the hour would be if you didn't have room on the device to store the audio file.\nBearing this in mind before you conduct an interview make sure you have enough memory to last.\nFor a one hour recording you will need about 160mb of free disc space\n", "Q: Is there a gesture to drag and drop with Expose on Lion? I know it could be done by pressing F3 button while dragging an item but I really need the five-finger-gesture for that. \nOn Snow Leopard, I could drag an item with my thumb and then use the remaining four fingers to expose all the apps/windows to drop this item in any app/window in the current space or any other space.\nIs there an equivalent in Lion?\n\nA: I don't know when this has been re-enabled, but in OS X Lion 10.7.4 I am able to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click drag and object in Window A and hold it with your thumb.\n\n*Initiate App Exposé/Mission Control using a four finger gesture. Do not release your thumb.\n\n*Drag the object to Window B using one of the remaining four fingers. \n\n\nSo, this is basically the same as you used to do.\n", "Q: Does the iPhone 4S generate a spark or detectable electric signal of any kind when receiving a call? In my spare time, I am a volunteer for the fire brigade. Yesterday I was attending a lessons about preventing fires, and we saw a movie about a lady fueling her car while receiving a call. And \"boom\"! The fuel, and later the car, exploded because her cell phone got a call. The teacher told us it was because her cell phone gave an electrical signal (a kind of spark) and by so light up the whole place.\nSince I tend to carry my iPhone 4S in my pockets all the time, I'm concerned about the risk of entering a building filled with some gas. If I get a call when I'm in such a building, I'm afraid I won't be around to answer the call anymore. :)\nSo, the teacher told us there are special cell phones which are explosion proof. These phones don't generate a spark or detectable electric signal of any kind when receiving a call.\nIs the iPhone 4S such a cell phone? In other words, is it safe to carry an iPhone 4S when entering a building filled with gas?\n\nA: To cut it short: This assumption is false.\nCellphone are not able to cause high voltage sparks required to light gas. Probably only if short-circuited.\nMythbusters investigated this problem. Their answer was that such accidents were caused by static charge on the person, not by cellphones.\nThis is important to notice as\n\"Petrol has a low electrical conductivity. This can cause a charge of\nstatic electricity to build up as it flows through a pipe.\"[1]\nWhen both the petrol and the person are charged, there is a potential spark discharge in the gap between.\nEdit:\n\n\n*\n\n*A BBC news article mentioned that research has been conducted on the matter by Dr Adam Burgess of the University of Kent. The publication is called:\n‘Phantom Risk: The Curious Case of Mobile Phones, Fire and Body Static,’ Health, Risk and Society 9 (1) 2007 ISSN: 1369-8575 and available here.\n\n*[1] The Australian Transport Safety Bureau has published a paper called 'Static Fires at Petrol Stations' which is publicly available for download.\n\nA: The iPhone is not explosion proof.\nThere have been a number of reports of iPhone exploding, one such report details how an iPhone exploded on an Australian airline without any reason.\nSo hopefully that helps you out a bit.\nAlthough I cannot confirm that this is due to exposure to gasses, they can explode.\n", "Q: Is the performance of Lion + SSD + Filevault2 good enough for a system primarily used for application developemnt? I'm looking to buy a MacBook Pro w/ SSD.\nI was wondering if anyone out there has noticed any significant performance drop with FileVault2 enabled for the following tasks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Small (under 2 GB) PostgreSQL and MySQL databases\n\n*Ruby development\n\n*Lots of grepping and text parsing\n\n\nA: As you will buy one of the latest Macs, you should be fine.\nThe used Intel processors support Intel® Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) which is also used in Filevault 2.\nArs Technica, published an extended review on Filvault 2 in Lion. They say:\n\nApple also leverages the special-purpose AES instructions and hardware on Intel's newest CPUs, further reducing the CPU overhead. The end result is that regular users will be hard-pressed to notice any reduction in performance with encryption enabled.\n\nEdit:\nThese are real world numbers from my MBP with an Intel 2635QM processor which supports AES encryption.

The problem with this one was that the system often hanged for several seconds until it worked again for a short time. Often the colored spinning wheel appeared and I had to wait. The MacBook Pro was unusable with this.\nThen I bought a Hitachi HDD from my colleague that was built in another MacBook an it worked perfectly. There were no problems.\nA week ago I decided to put in the Crucial M4 SSD with 128 GB. The same problem as with the Samsung HDD. I've cloned my old HDD, reinstalled the system, but nothing helped.

That model of MBP had a known issue where it would constantly beach-ball with non Apple drives.  There was a firmware update available but that hasn't fixed all units.\nFrom personal (and professional) experience I've found upgrading to Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6 fixed about 50% of the time, all other units had to have an official Apple drive fitted to fix the issue.\nBasically your only options are to upgrade to Snow Leopard (I'm unsure of whether Lion includes the relevant firmware updates) or complain to Apple so much that they give you a replacement unit.  Ugh.\n\nA: This is a common know issue that Apple has not acknowledged. Google: \"Macbook Pro 2009 EFI firmware update 1.7.\" \n\nDowngrade the motherboard firmware back to EFI 1.6.

With the OS version I was running (I think it was Mountain Lion) it was very bad, beachballing constantly.  I upgraded to Yosemite and it got a bit better, working smoothly for 10-20 minutes or so after start-up before starting to beach ball (heat issue??), but it was still pretty unusable for anything serious.  I was on EFI 1.7 and trying to revert to 1.6 didn't seem like the way to go.  Finally, I tried swapping out the Crucial for a Samsung 850 EVO 1TB SSD and I'm happy to report--no more beachballs!  It's working great!\nFor what it's worth, I did make an unsuccessful attempt at updating the firmware on the Crucial before giving up on it.  The Crucial website has a link for how to do this on a mac, but the supposed mac instructions also seem oriented towards PC users.  I did my best to interpret them to make a bootable USB drive with the firmware update image, but it's a DOS-based utility and didn't show signs of actually doing something, no text printed on the screen, etc.  \n", "Q: Change global system property for file.encoding Due to a conflict between the mac osx lion 'file.encoding' system-property and my java application, i have to change the setting from MacRoman to UTF-8. \nWhat is the best way to reset this system property globally for all users on this machine?\nRegards\nmmm...\n\nA: You've got it the wrong way round, the issue is not the OSX default encoding which is UTF8, but Java's default encoding under OSX which is MacRoman\nApples Mac Developer docs on Java see the section 'Character Encoding'\n", "Q: iBooks preview not working?

You can export your Latex as a picture which can be very easily copied into iBooks Author.\n\n\nA: IF you rendered the LaTeX into a PDF, you could certainly paste the resulting image into iBooks Author, but this is hardly an optimal solution.\n", "Q: Extract images from a pages document I want to extract all of the images out of a large pages document. I found an article about it from 2006 ( see http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20060324033125571 ) which states you can open the pages file as a package and extract the images. Right clicking shows no 'open package' item and using pkgutil --expand mydoc.pages . errors with \"Could not open package for expansion\" I'm guessing the pages file format is now somewhat different.\nSo how can I extract all of the images from my pages document in one go? (there are around 100 pictures, so too many to do by hand unless I absolutely have to)\n\nA: In later iWork edition Apple made changes to the formats so this is the cause that you can not follow the procedure described in the article that you are referring. \nThe best way to go around this annoyance would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the pages document with your current pages (I assume is the latest Pages),\n\n*Save us some other name but before you do it extend the save us menu using the up/down arrow where you are presented with more choices,\n\n*Select the radio button \"Save copy as:\" and choose iWork'08 and then save it.\n\n*Go find your new saved document and you are now presented with the \"Show package content\" additional menu item (on your right click).\n\n*Extract the images (copy them somewhere else).\n\n\nA: Open the Pages document using Pacifist. (Other archive utilities might work also, but Pacifist worked for me.)\nI did this by right (CTL)-clicking on the Pages document icon, then choosing Open with… Pacifist from the contextual menu.\nThis will produce a window listing the contents of the Pages \"package\" file. Select the graphics files you need, and \"Extract To…\" a convenient location\nI haven't explored it, but there might be a way to automate this procedure using AppleScript and/or Automator if its something you do often.\n\nA: I just used Terminal.\n# mkdir /someDirectory\n# cd file.pages\n# find . -name \"*.png\" -or -name \"*.jpg\" -exec cp {} /someDirectory \\;\n\nYou can mess with the file extensions in that last line to copy different file types.\n\nA: The Fastest way to to do this is to change the file extension from name.pages to name.zip (actually manually click on the file name and change the extension to .zip) \nNow just unzip your document and you will get a folder with all the images in it.  Same works for ePubs. \n\nA: FYI - If using the newest-as-of-2014 Pages application (citing version 5.5.1 here), you cannot access the package contents via the finder, and you can only export to Pages '09. \nHowever, if you go to File -> Advanced -> Change File Type and select \"Package\" versus \"Single File,\" you'll be able to open the file's contents in the finder and be good to go. (This saved me being able to do something constructive with my wife's birthday card.)\n\nA: it seems that on newer Pages the \"Save as\" no longer exist and it let you save only as Pages'09 .... I got around by exporting it to PDF at best resolution and then dragging out the images to my desktop. But if you do this, you have to rename every picture you drag out before dragging another one or you might end up by replacing the last dragged image.\n\nA: \n  \n*\n  \n*Open the Pages application\n  \n*Open the document which contains the images you want extracted\n  \n*Select the image\n  \n*Copy the image by either clicking 'Edit' then 'Copy' from the menu that pops up or clicking command and C keys together (on your keyboard)\n  \n*Open the 'Preview' Application\n  \n*Click 'File'\n  From the menu that pops up click 'New from Clipboard' (should be first option). Preview will create a new document of file type png with the image that you want.\n  \n*Save the document to your desire location.

I restarted using Command + R and erased the Macintosh HD first and then tried the Lion Internet Recovery. \nThe problem i'm facing is it downloads all the way and then in between/by the end i get this error:\n'Additional Components of Lion were unable to download. Please try again.'\nNow i wish i hadnt erased my HD first. I've tried it for like 5 times with different connections. Still no luck. \nIs there a solution guys? Or is my best bet to take it to the iStore here in India.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: If you have access to another computer, you could try downloading the Lion installer from the App Store, right clicking on it and clicking \"Show Package Contents\" and finding the \"InstallESD.dmg\" file and restoring this to a flash drive (8GB+). Then you can hold alt on startup and select the drive as your boot option. You should be able to install Lion on the air without needing to download the additional components, but it may still try. Even if it tries, it might still work since you're installing from a different drive. It's worth a shot. \n", "Q: 1st gen iPad stuck in setup I can't get pass the license screen after a restore on an iPad.

Apple's licensing terms for iBooks Author are quite restrictive towards the distribution of work: They require the output of iBooks Author to be distributed only through Apple's retail operation.\nHow can this work for business that create content using iBooks Author? If you export your book as a PDFs to sell for a Kindle, it would be against the licensing terms.\nThus, I'm asking: Is there a version of iBooks Author with adequate licensing terms for enterprise?\nHere's the extract (iBooks Author 1.0 licence agreement section 2.B.)\n\nDistribution of your Work. As a condition of this Licence and provided you are in compliance with its terms, your Work may be distributed as follows:\n\n*\n\n*if your Work is provided for free (at no charge), you may distribute the Work by any available means;\n\n*if your Work is provided for a fee [...], you may only distribute the Work though Apple [...]\n\n\n\nA: The restrictions only apply to the .ibooks format.\nFrom the iBooks Author Publishing and Distribution FAQ of 2/7/12:\n\nAre there any restrictions on the distribution of works produced with\n  iBooks Author?\nIf a fee is charged for the work and it is in the .ibooks format, the\n  work may only be sold through the iBookstore. If the work is in a\n  different format, such as PDF or ePub, this restriction does not\n  apply.\n\nHere's the relevant part of the updated license agreement regarding the distribution of work:\n\n(i) if the work is provided for free [...], you may distribute it by any means;\n(ii) if the work is provided for a fee [...] and included files in the .ibooks format [...], the work may only be distributed through Apple, [...], however, that this restriction will not apply to the content of the work when distributed in a form that does not include files in the .ibooks format [...]. You retain all your rights in the content of your works, and you may distribute such content by any means when it does not include files in the .ibooks format [...].\n\n\nA: The only version of iBooks Author currently (1-20-2012) available in the App Store is the standard version, containing the license you cite. At present, the answer to your question appears to be no. There are, of course, other tools by other software companies that can create PDFs (and other software by Apple, such as Pages).\n\nA: The current version of iBooks author works fine for many enterprise customers since they can handle the distribution of the works and don't care to a) make money on the books in the iTunes store (or put another way - intend all Apple distributed books to be free) b) have apple do the hosting of the books in the first place.\nAlso, enterprises have good legal teams that have experience and don't just have to rely on Apple's EULA to know what they can do with their staff's time and writing. The enterprise people I have spoken with are overjoyed at this tool to let them create compelling content without needing thousands of dollars of tightly licensed software to create publications or worse, having to pay developers tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars to make a publishing platform for their catalog and consumer marketing apps.\n\nA: Note that in your question you say \"They require the output of iBooks Author to be distributed only through Apple's retail operation.\" which is not true, you are perectly allowed to use iBooks Author to create material for distribution as PDFs for example, so long as you do not charge.  If you charge, then they simply expect you to use the App store as the charging mechanism.\nIt's relatively straightforward, they provide the tools to you for free to create the materials.  If you intend to make a profit on the back of the usage of those tools, then at that point you pay, via having a cut taken at the App Store gates.\nAs for \"Enterprise\" software apple does not distinguish beteen home/pro/enterprise etc in the same way that a lot of software providers do.  They only ever provide a single version of an app, and if it is suitable for you then use it.  If not, look elsewhere.  There are exceptions to the rule (Logic), but the vast majority of software provided by Apple is provided in a single \"SKU\" to use Microsofts nomenclature.\n\nA: The only restriction is that you aren't permitted to sell your work in the .ibooks format. As clarified on the official apple website:\n\nDistribution on the Web\nYou can distribute works you've created with iBooks Author on the web as a standalone purchase or subscription product or service. When you sell your book on the web, it must be in a non-.ibooks format. Examples of a non-.ibooks format include PDF and ePub. If you wish to sell your work in the .ibooks format, it may be sold only through the iBooks Store. When you provide a work for free, you can distribute it in any format (including .ibooks) through the iBooks Store or by other means.\n\nYou are permitted to sell your work in any format except the ibooks format.

I've been using the Mac Mini with Dell U2711 monitor for couple days and only now I've realized what is wrong: The display isn't using its maximum resolution 2560x1440 but the 1080p which the OS reports as the max resolution. I then read from the Apple's site that for some reason 1080p is the maximum resolution when using the HDMI-connector.\nThe Mac Mini contains only HDMI and Thunderbolt connectors, at least according to Apple's site. The Dell-monitor doesn't have Thunderbolt but instead it has VGA, DVI, DisplayPort and HDMI. \nSo my question is: Is it possible to get the maximum resolution out of my monitor?\n\nA: Thunderbolt contains a DisplayPort channel.  You can get a Thunderbolt/Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable.  I found a cheap one on Monoprice a while back. Here is a 6 footer.\n\nA: Only via Thunderbolt.\nAs you said, Apple's documentation for the Mac mini (Mid 2011) states:\n\nVideo Support\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Thunderbolt port with support for up to 2560-by-1600 resolution\n  \n*HDMI port with support for up to 1920-by-1200 resolution\n  \n\nIt used to be possible with models using a dual-link DVI Adapter which the new models don't support:\n\nSimultaneously supports up to 1920 by 1200 pixels on a DVI or VGA display; up to 2560 by 1600 pixels on a dual-link DVI display using Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter. \n\n", "Q: Are there any keyboard shortcuts to switch between tabs in terminal?

When I play music, it sounds like it's been turned into an instrumental.  When I play spoken voice, it sounds like the Peanuts teacher.\nIf I turn up the volume to the max, I can hear the voices fine, but then the low-frequency music is overwhelming, so that's not an option.\nIs there some equalizer setting (I didn't think the iPod Touch had these but I could be wrong) that I could have screwed up to make this happen?\nUPDATE:\nI'm suspecting a hardware issue.  I've not mistreated it, but I've found that with some headphones, if I rotate the plug in just the right way, the vocals come back just fine.  I'm not sure how an audio jack can be plugged in and receive non-vocal sound but not vocal sound, but that's what it sounds like.  I'll take it by an Apple Store and see if they can do anything.  The audio jack is certainly the weakest part of the iPod these days, so it's not entirely surprising that it's the first thing to go.\n\nA: There is in fact an equalizer setting on the iPod touch.  Go to Settings -> Music -> EQ to get a list of all of the different equalizer settings.  The best choices for you are probably \"Off\", \"Spoken Word,\" or \"Vocal Booster.\"  If your problem continues, feel free to leave me a comment.\n\nA: Squeeze the phone right above the headphone jack. If this works, you have a bad connection in the internal jack. It could be from lint, or a damaged internal connector. The connection is not being made soundly against the jack, and squeezing the phone, forces the physical connection. \nRepair may be as easy as cleaning out the jack, or using compressed air, but it also may require taking the phone apart and adjusting the connection pins. \n\nA: The problem with listening to vocals that you are experiencing, in light of the fact that you've diagnosed a problem with the wiring of the headphone jack, probably means that you are experiencing phase-cancellation effects because the left and right stereo signals are no longer properly separated. Certain components of the sound in a stereo mix will cancel each other out if the two separate signals are electronically combined, or \"summed to mono\" in the parlance of sound engineers.\n\nA: I had a similar issue. Yesterday the vocals were fine! Today the voices sound ethereal and far away...so far away. I tried the equalizer options which work great for the instruments, but didn't fix the voice. Ultimately the rotating of the headphone plug brought the voices back to good! It's all about finding the sweet spot. \n\nA: If u don't have Dr. Dre head phones skip this. So I haved that problem. So when I read u have to mess with u head phone jack. The head phone jack that goes into the head phones is the problem. Listen to your most vocal word song and pull out the jack while listening and slowly put it back in while a song is running and the headphones are on. As u put them on u will hear the song in one side and then the other and right after that u will hear perfectly in both with word and ever thing. But don't put the jack all the in because if u do the problem will happen again\n\nA: Rotating the headphone plug--so simple; solved the problem for me.  Good to try the simple solutions first.\n", "Q: \"Mount\" network share as a volume via SSH?

I have a macbook (2.26 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo upgraded to 8GB 1067 MHz DDR3 RAM) running OS X version 10.6.8. I do a lot of prototyping for high performance computing on this macbook (running c++, fortran, mathematica, matlab, etc) and often work in parallel.\nI have noticed that my computer gets hot so I have installed 'Temperature Monitor' and find that, when running difficult jobs, it can break into the 90 degree (C) range. I know this is not good, but is this incredibly dangerous? after seeing what values should i begin to get worried?\nSecondly, I would like to clean (and maybe even replace?) the fan to make sure I am getting the best ventilation possible. Will a can of compressed air do the trick? how expensive/worthwhile would it be to open up the case and replace the fan?\nAny help would be great - thanks!\n\nA: 90˚c is typical for that system under high load; anything > than 95˚c is when you might want to be concerned. If the CPU gets too hot, or starts to overheat, the system (typically) will clock down the CPU to prevent overheating. The fans shouldn't wear out, so I don't really see any point in trying to replace what's not broken. Intel Mac's run hot, and the fact that the only fan is an output fan doesn't help with heat dissipation. \nSomething you could do to help alleviate some of the heat is to download smcFanControl (free) and adjust your fans RPM. Instead of the standard 1800 RPM set it at 3500-3600 RPM, which should help cool down the temp possibly 2-10˚c. You might notice more noise from the higher RPM, although you shouldn't worry about it — MacBooks fans generally max out at around 6,000 RPM, and I've cranked one up to 8,700 RPM before.\n\nA: After 3 years of walltime and hundreds of years of cpu time, I'll respond to this question to update for anyone interested in modern day values.\nMy current Macbook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015 - 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5, 16 GB 1867 MHz DDR3 RAM) idles around 50-65 C and can get up to 100+ when I run heavy processes in Matlab. Sometimes when I have runaway processes and need to restart, it will get up to 80-90 without doing a lot of work.\nThis is all pretty normal in my book and cleaning out the fan won't do much. If it is idling above 90, that's a bit different. However, I will say that putting in hours and hours of runtime on a CPU running above 100 C is not the best idea. At the time I was doing this, my Macbook was really my only means of programming on the go so I had to make do. Nowadays, if I ever notice my Macbook getting above 95 due to computationally intensive work, I will throw the job on a desktop.\nFor comparison's sake - I also have a Linux desktop (intel i7-4790K at 4.0 GHz, 32 GB 1600 MHz RAM) and struggle to get it above 70 C even when running parallel jobs on all 4 cores for hours on end and it typically idles at about 29-32 C.\n", "Q: Can I drag a document window to an email message to attach it? I realize that I can drag files from Finder and drop them in a mail message in Mail.app to attach them.

I don't want to have to open a finder window and navigate to the correct folder and drag and drop from there.\nI suppose the next best thing would be to have a service that could do this.

It is commonly asked how to get a Terminal prompt from a Finder window.  I am asking the opposite.\nI would like a command-line way of determining the working directory of the \"current\" Finder window.\n\nA: pwd: print name of current/working directory\nopen .: open current directory in finder\n\nA: This guy has a great answer http://coderwall.com/p/vp9zlw\nDefine the two functions:\nfunction ff { osascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\"'\\\n -e \"if (${1-1} <= (count Finder windows)) then\"\\\n -e \"get POSIX path of (target of window ${1-1} as alias)\"\\\n -e 'else' -e 'get POSIX path of (desktop as alias)'\\\n -e 'end if' -e 'end tell'; };\\\n\nfunction cdff { pushd \"`ff $@`\"; };\n\nAfter that you can type cdff to cd into Finder directory.\n\nA: If you are using zsh with oh-my-zsh the requested functionality is provided by the osx-Plugin. After activating the plugin in the configuration file (usually ~/.zshrc) one can use \npfd to geht the path to the current finder window and cdf to cd to it.\n\nA: The following command will return the path to the frontmost Finder window, if that's what you're looking for:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to get the POSIX path of (target of front window as alias)'\n\nNote that this cannot return a POSIX path if the frontmost window has no POSIX path.
