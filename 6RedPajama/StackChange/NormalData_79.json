["Q: Default browser utility to forward links to their respective apps? On a machine I used at my old job, I had a little taskbar app (which I'd configured to be the default browser) installed that allowed me to configure e.g. Slack links to open directly in Slack, and the same for other apps, and all other links to open in Firefox as usual. It helped prevent loads of tabs piling up (e.g. click a link in Slack, it opens a tab in the browser which then opens up some other app, ugh). It essentially acted as a little configurable router for any link clicked in apps.\nIt worked great, but now I'm trying to find it again and I can't remember what it was called or how I found it.

I'm using cmake, ninja, with parallelism of 7 (there is 8 cores). It goes really really fast for the first five minutes, then really really slow. What is happening ? I don't hear any fan, and the small flow of air out of the computer does not seem warm at all. Any thing I can do ?\n\nA: We can dig deeper to understand what’s consuming the time, but let me preface this by saying that this may be normal behavior. I’ve seen plenty of cases where a compilation or linking phase takes a long time with large or complex projects.\nGiven that you’re not seeing thermal pressure and CPU utilization goes down to 10% during the slow phase, however, I’m inclined to suspect that your build is getting serialized behind a blocked process.\nWe can start to understand what process(es) is/are blocked by taking a stackshot during build:\n\n*\n\n*Run the following Terminal command to enable kernel symbolication: $ sudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\"\n\n*Reboot your machine and don’t open any apps except for Terminal.\n\n*Start your build and wait until you’ve entered the slow phase.\n\n*Run the following command, making sure you’re only running it during the window of time that the build is slow: $ sudo spindump -reveal -noProcessingWhileSampling\n\n*After waiting for 10 seconds to collect a sample and another minute or two to symbolicate and format, you’ll get a file in /tmp/spindump.txt that contains a stackshot of every process.\n\n*Upload the file to PasteBin or some equivalent place.\n\nThat will be the most direct way to begin root-causing. Also, just to rule out memory pressure, does your system “feel” sluggish to you during the build? (I suspect not, but you should run top in another Terminal window while you’re building anyway and monitor your swapouts to see if they’re growing.)\nWithout knowing any of the details of the code or its build process, a crude guess would be that it’s waiting on a resource (e.g. a network server that’s slow to resolve, or an indirect filesystem lookup on a slow partition/disk). If you feel like experimenting, try disabling all of your network interfaces, unmounting every partition, and disconnecting every device.\n", "Q: How to add a New Action when viewing a Custom Perspective in OmniFocus 3?

It directly adjusts the webcam (don't ask me how!) and so works with all webcam apps.  I have had no issues with Big Sur upgrade.\nYou will not be able to adjust everything in your list and what can be adjusted varies by webcam.  For example, it can adjust more on my Logitech webcam than the built-in webcam.\nHere is the main settings panel for my built-in camera:\n\nThe Hue and White Balance settings will likely be enough to make a significant improvement.\nBut no app will magically make a relatively poor web cam into a great looking one. If you find the built-in FaceTime webcam is not good enough for your usage, you should invest in a better one.  I use a rather old Logitech C920 which is better than the built-in and you can easily find a webcam that is better again.\n\nA: The best software for this is written by ecamm - iGlasses for Mac\nTheir iGlasses product works very well and describes all the ways in which you can and can not take control of the physical camera based on hardened apps in Big Sur, Catalina and Mojave and making a virtual software camera to feed to other apps.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.ecamm.com/en/articles/3217016-iglasses-compatibility-with-apps\n", "Q: Folders missing in sidebar with Big Sur Since I installed macOS Big Sur 11.1, I cannot see the usual folders in the left sidebar of Finder:\n\neven though I have selected them in my preferences:\n\nWhat is going wrong here and how do I fix it?\n\nA: Next to \"Favorites\", if you hover over it, you should see an arrow you can click to expand the section.

I do not really want to move the whole Documents folder here (some of the VMs really suffer on the tin disk) so the using System Prefs to move the home folders article may not be a solution in my case.\nAfter many frustrating days, I found a note that Filevault could be the issue and in my case turning this off does seem to have solved my drops over the lat few days but at the cost of leaving my main data unencrypted if the disk is removed from the Mac (user and disk passwords are complex but still an acknowledged weak point in this).\nFor most of my files this is not an issue but for others (work related / bank etc) this is not good practise and kind of goes against my instincts.  The only way around this I could think of is:\n\n*\n\n*Encrypt the second disk in the Mac using 'Mac OS Extended' format rather than APFS\n\n*Create a symbolic link in Documents to a folder on this encrypted disk\n\n*Store any 'sensitive' documents in here but away from the normal folder structure.\n\nI did wonder about using VeraCrypt but never used it and could not work out if I could encrypt the Documents folder or hard disk as most fo the instructions are for Windows.\nCan anyone think of another way?\n\nA: I like making an encrypted disk image to store documents.

In order to free some bandwidth I have used wireless receivers for mouse and keyboard rather than connecting to laptop directly. Now the only device connected to my laptop via Bluetooth are the headphones.\nFor users of Logitech, the Unifying receiver operates on the frequency similar to that of the USB 3.0 so mouse movements where delayed, sometimes quite a lot. Not having a dedicated port for USB 2.0 only I used a MALE/FEMALE USB extender which is plugged to the USB hub so that the Unifying receiver does not sit close to the USB 3.0 cables.\nThis has pretty much fixed the Bluetooth issue. Though sometimes when reconnecting headphones appear on the list of devices but not on the list of audio outputs.\nTo fix that:\n\n*\n\n*kill bluetoothd process from the activity monitor or run sudo launchctl stop com.apple.bluetoothd\n\n*followed by sudo launchctl start com.apple.bluetoothd (though this is done automatically after some time)\n\nFew times I'm pretty sure I have had some sort of interference between phone and mac fighting for access, turning off Bluetooth on my phone stopped mac connection from cutting out so I tend to keep it off too.\n", "Q: How to blur the background in photo booth? When using photo booth, I see there is an 'Effects' button with many effects like 'Space Alien' and 'Dizzy'.\nBut if I want to simply blur the background a little, how do I do that?\n\nA: Photo Booth in macOS Catalina no longer has the option for custom backgrounds. If you have an older version of macOS, you can add your own background, which you can blur.\n\n*\n\n*Take a picture using Photo Booth without you in it, such that it captures the background.\n\n*Blur the image using a photo editing application, such as Photoshop or one from Tool to quickly hide/blur/redact text in screenshot?.\n\n*In Photo Booth effects, on the last page for custom backgrounds, drag your image in.\n\n", "Q: Moving iMovie (10) libraries to external hard drive I have a friend who have a 13\" macbook pro from 2014.\nThe OS is Yosemite 10.10.15.\n\nMy friend would like to upgrade her OS to either High Sierra or Mojave or even maybe Catalina or Big Sur, however she has a pretty big iMovie library and thus she can't upgrade because the iMovie library takes too much disk space.\nAlso she would like to move her iMovie library to an external hard drive, which would also solve the disk space problem.\nObviously, even if the iMovie library is on her external hard drive she'd still like to be able to work on it with her macbook.\n\nThe issue I have is that I found plenty of ways to do this with iMovie 11+ but with iMovie 10 the tutorials I found sometimes specify some particular manipulations and sometimes not, so I am not very confident about the manipulation I should do on her macbook.\n\nCould anyone point me to a safe tutorial to do this ? Or explain me step by step how should I do this ?\nAlso I guess that after upgrading her mac OS she will want to upgrade her iMovie software, is there any compatibily issue I should be aware of ?\n\nI am pretty tech savy, but I don't know a lot about mac OS and even less about iMovie...\nAs a side note, I made her format her external hard drive in extended mac OS, and I did a partition for time machine and an other partition for her iMovie stuff.\n\nA: You can just move it, anywhere, then tell iMove to find it again on next launch.\nAs the library presents itself to the Mac as s single file (even though technically it's a 'special' folder) then dragging to a new location, or Cmd/dragging to move rather than copy, is all that's required.\nYou can force a new library to be requested if you hold the Opt key immediately after double-clicking to launch. iMovie is capable of switching between multiple libraries this way, if required.\n\nIf it doesn't show in that list (which it won't if it's moved) then use Locate… & navigate to it.\nIt will continue after that to use the new location until told otherwise.\nOlder versions of iMovie used to keep the original footage separately - so if you see separate folders named iMovie Events, Exports, Original, Projects etc, then move those too. If any of these folders contains a file called UpdatedToiMovie10 then you should be OK without them, but better to check inside iMovie itself before permanently discarding.\n", "Q: Deleting files doesn't free storage on SSD Recently my MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) with 251 GB Flash Storage and Mac OS Catalina 10.15.7 started complaining about not enough space left on the hard disk. So I started deleting stuff. But to my surprise that didn't free up memory on the hard disk.

Or is my only option left deleting the whole disk and reinstalling everything again?\n\nA: After you delete those files you want to be sure to empty the trash.  Try that and see if the space disappears.\n\nA: This situation is normal for Catalina on up, due to the way that the file system is managed by the OS.

Is it possible to use an iPhone as a monitor for a RPi via USB (USB-A to Lightning) ? Thank you.\n\nA: iPhone hardware doesn’t have a video in through the Lightning connector, so you’d need a different option even if the Pi had drivers to send data out over USB.\nYou’ll want a driver board and touch or no-touch display like these for the most economical solution if you don’t use HDMI or more traditional video out.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/\n\n*https://www.adafruit.com/product/2718\n\n*https://www.adafruit.com/product/1933\nAlso, don’t forget both the Pi and iOS device can share a network and you can run X11 or VNC on the Pi and share the screen via networking.

Trying to recover a Mac OS partition Vol Type FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF I have a Macbook Pro with Big Sur on it, and I installed Linux Mint.  I then resized the encrypted Mac OS APFS partition in order to grant Linux more space.  After that I created another smaller Linux partition out of that new, smaller partition.\nBut now I've lost my \"Macintosh HD\" boot option in Boot Camp and can no longer boot into Mac OS, only Linux.

Will gpt remove -i 2 disk0 delete my files when it removes that partition, or is it doing something slightly different (ie. removing partition info / header / metadata, etc)?\nHopefully this makes sense.  I hope to be able to retain access to file files on that Mac OS APFS partition since it isn't backed up.\nPlease help!\n\nA: The man page for the gpt clearly states the gpt remove command  does the following.\n\nPartitions are removed by clearing the partition type.  No other information is changed.\n\nIn other words, the partition type is change to 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.\nAlthough, a change in a partition type will also cause the 3 CRC32 values to change in 4 places in the GPT.\nThe “gpt remove” command does not delete files along with partition. In other words, the volume stored in the partition remains unchanged by the the command.  Therefore, your files will not be deleted when your run the \"gpt remove...\" command. Entering gpt remove -i 2 disk0 will not delete your files when it removes that partition. The command does not removing any partition info / header / metadata, etc.\nHow the GPT Uses CRC32 Values\nA 32 bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC32) computation is done by passing data through an algorithm that produces a 32 bit integer. The algorithm is designed to have a high probability of detecting any corruption that may exist in the data. This is accomplished by computing and storing the CRC32 value when the data can be assumed to be free of corruption. Later, if the data is run through the same algorithm and returns the same value, then the data is assumed to be error free.\nThe algorithm to compute CRC32 values for the GPT is the same as used by the command cksum -o 3. More information on this algorithm can be found in the man page for cksum. The man page can be viewed by entering the command given below.\nman cksum\n\nThe GUID Partition Table (GPT) scheme consists of a header and table stored at the beginning and end of a drive. Each header contains offsets indicating where the other header resides. Therefore, both headers can not contain exactly the same values. On the other hand, the table stored at the beginning is exactly the same as the table stored at the end. After any desired changes are made to the GPT, new CRC32 values need to be computed for the tables and headers. Since the tables are identical, a new CRC32 value only needs to be computed for one table, however this value is stored in both headers. Since the headers are different, a new CRC32 value needs to be computed and stored for each header. Here, each header has a location to store its own CRC32 value. Therefore, 3 new CRC32 values are computed and used to update 2 places in each header for a total of 4 places.\nReferences\nGUID Partition Table\nman gpt\nman cksum\n", "Q: How to stop autocorrect from putting a space after it corrects a word If I type something like \"Helko\" and press the \"Hello\" button that shows up on the bar above my keyboard, it will add a space, leaving me with \"Hello \".\nIf I wanted to type \"Hello.\" then this is frustrating, because now I have to delete the space before adding the period.\nAs another example, say I wanted to send my friend just the word Hello, but instead I typed Helko.

If you double-tap Space, it will accept and insert the stop, same as a regular word.\n \nAfter question edits: this also works if you type any punctuation, bracket, question mark etc.\n", "Q: Lightning-3.5mm adapter causes device to act as if remote button is continuously pressed Since late last year (I forget exactly when), I've had a bizarre issue with my Lightning-3.5mm adapter (A1749, from Apple). When I plug it into my device (iPhone XS), and plug in a set of bog-standard wired EarPods w/ remote+mic, the device acts like I'm pressing the main button on the remote. It opens Siri, won't accept volume changes from the remote, and won't transmit audio from the microphone. I can listen to audio on the EarPods, but that's it - no volume control, no mic input.\nI see the same behavior using the adapter on my iPad (6th generation) - immediate Siri prompt upon plugging in the 3.5mm side of the adapter. I can plug in the EarPods to the iPad's native 3.5mm jack and get the proper behavior. I've verified all of this with multiple pairs of EarPods.\nThis started happening on both my iPad and iPhone at roughly the same time, late last year (but I don't recall if it correlated with a specific iOS update). It feels like a software issue, but I have a hard time believing Apple would ship code that debilitates the adapter for this long.\nThe inside of the 3.5mm side of the adapter is clean, no conductive junk that I can see. I'm working on getting another adapter to test with. In the meantime, any thoughts?\n\nA: This is likely a defective adapter.\nTrying it with different peripherals and devices kind of nails it down. Just probably a short in the wiring or internal circuitry that can't be seen. I would toss it and replace it.\n", "Q: What is up with IP address? Getting bizarre results I'm trying to limit my teenage son's access to certain websites (like Discord) during school hours only. The only solution I've found is to use something like https://www.dnsfilter.com. They require our public IP.\nBut while playing with different DNS settings, I'm getting bizarre results for our (dynamic) IP and confused what is causing this.\nIf I just Google \"My IP\" I get our true IP.\nIf I go to any of the \"what is my IP\" websites (like myip.com) I get different results, like 138.199.9.198\nIn Terminal, curl ifconig.me and other hosts I get the false IP as well.\nChanging the DNS server on the Mac results in different results.\n\nA: Given your description, it sounds like your Mac is accessing the Internet via a rerouted/controlled connection, such as a Virtual Private Network (VPN).\nPlease contact DNSFilter and ask how their product works on Mac and if this is expected.\n138.197.142.28 looks to be operated by Digital Ocean.

I'm fiddling with scp on mac and it seems to me like the -l option doesn't work; though I'm also (perhaps more) open to the idea that I'm just misunderstanding or misusing something. I'm not trying to solve a problem that requires limiting the bandwidth of a transfer so I don't need alternative suggestions, I'm just curious what's going on with my attempt to use this specific option. Looking for dis/confirmation that this is the behaviour other's are seeing and/or an explanation of what's wrong with my attempt.\nI made a 10K file then tried to scp it to localhost:<file> with a limit of 1Kb/s thinking it should take ~80 seconds but the output of scp shows a transfer speed higher than 1Kb/s and the command completes effectively immediately.\n\n\nxy@xyz exploring-scp % man scp | grep -B1 Limits\n    -l limit. \n        Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.\n\n\nsrc=$(mktemp)                                           \ncat /dev/random | head -c 10240 > $src                  \nscp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -l 1 $src localhost:/tmp/random.bin\n\nMy first thought was that maybe it's being \"smart\" and seeing localhost and skipping the network and therefore skipping with bandwidth limit; but the same thing happens both if I use the explicit IP for localhost, and also if I try to scp the file from a docker container back to the mac host.\nI'm also fairly confident I've used the -l flag successfully on linux even when copying to/from localhost.

However, it may take some time for this balance to be\nachieved, so don't be surprised if limiting the rate doesn't work well with very small files.\n\nman rsync says:\n\nRsync writes data over the socket in blocks, and this option both limits the size of the blocks that rsync writes, and tries to keep the average transfer\nrate  at  the requested limit.  Some burstiness may be seen where rsync writes out a block of data and then sleeps to bring the average rate into compliance.\n\nI can't say for sure that either of these are the case with scp's internals but I have had success applying rate limits to particularly large files.\n", "Q: After migration of a user to another Mac (Catalina to Big Sur, Intel to Apple Silicon) via Time Machine backup, user is stuck on login screen I setup my new MacBook Air M1 from scratch, just adding a new admin account.

When I tried to launch with a third party payment processing tool, Apple blocked my app until I've integrated In App Purchase and completely removed the third party payment processor.\nA competing app offering the same exact service, however, has launched with In App Purchase. On a later update, the competitor removed the In App Purchase option and replaced it with a third party payment processor.\nThe competing app, according to App Store rules, is in violation of removing In App Purchase despite selling a purely digital service.\nHow can I report the competing app to Apple so that they would level the playing field?

It might be that your app that was rejected earlier might be approved today.\nI don't think Apple has any official contact for complaining about competitors. You have no proof that they are in violation of anything, as your competitor might have a special agreement with Apple that you know nothing of.\nI would try submitting your app for approval again and see if you can pass the test this time around.\n", "Q: Light weight, free way to record a video with a blurred background using Mac webcam? When recording a video, sometimes it's preferable to blur the background, especially when working from home or outside the typical office environment.\nI didn't figure out how to blur the background of a photo booth video recording, so I record without blurring the background. But blurring the background usually makes videos look much more professional. Example:\n\nWhat is the quickest and easiest way to record a video from a mac webcam that blurs the background? (preferably using software that comes with macOS, but if not, something free and very light weight is preferred)\n\nA: The easiest approach to attain your goal is to use a video calling application in combination with screen recording.\nFor the video calling application I suggest Jitsi as it works in your browser, but you can also look into any other popular application like Teams, Zoom or Skype.\n\n*\n\n*Go to meet.jitsi.com to start a video call in your browser. For other applications follow the steps they need to start a video call.\n\n*Configure the calling application to use your camera and microphone.\n\n*Configure background blurring.\n\n*\n\n*In Jitsi you can go to the three dot menu in the lower right and select \"Blur my background [BETA]\".\n\n*Here are instructions for other applications: Teams, Zoom, Skype\n\n\n\n*Now you should have a screen, showing live what is being recorded by your camera.\n\n*Open Quicktime, and follow these steps to record your screen, in particular the window of your video calling application.\n\nThis will generate a recording of your screen, and as that screen shows your webcam with a blurred background you will have a video of yourself with a blurred background.\nNote that some video calling applications have a built in recording option, allowing you to skip step 5.\n\nA: There is an app for Mac and Windows called ChromaCam.\nIt has minimum requirements such as MacOs 10.14 but it can accomplish this as well.\n", "Q: Preference Panes no longer open after Big Sur update. Library/PreferencePanes is now completely empty After upgrading to Big Sur, none of the System Preferences panes open. A little hunting around online steered me to the folder, Library/PreferencePanes, which is now completely empty. So I guess there's just nothing to open. On the advice of Apple Support, I've tried reinstalling Big Sur in the hope that it would restore everything, but still nothing. The folder remains empty. I've tried multiple restarts and clearing NVRAM. Weirdly, when I open Timemachine and search for old copies of Library/PreferencePanes to restore, the folder is empty even before the upgrade, back in the good old days when the panes still opened. I'm stuck. Any ideas would be great. Thanks!\n\nA: Make sure you look at the right preference panes folder. There are three of them:\n\n*\n\n*/System/Library/PreferencePanes This folder includes all the panes which are shipped with macOS. It definitely should not be empty.\n\n*/Library/PreferencePanes Here you can install third-party panes which should be available for all users of your Mac.\n\n*/Users/yourusername/Library/PreferencePanes Here you can install third-party panes which should be available just for \"your\" user.\n\nUse Finder and select \"Go to\" – \"Go to folder...\" and enter one of the path names. Finder will then show you wether it is empty. The last two can be empty, but the first one not.\nIf the first one isn't empty, try to add another admin user using the steps in this answer and see if this user can open the preference panes.\nIf it is empty, you should try to install the system again, checking the disk first by booting into recovery mode. Press Command-R during startup to do this.\n\nA: This is a rare situation where the three sets of files are correct, yet the app won’t run for a user.\nTo triage this I would do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Make a good full backup - check your important files and do a restore of one or several to be sure you can get workable files from the backup.\n\n*Make a new user on the mac - this will be challenging without the User Preference Pane and involves recovery mode options so this is optional. You might have luck starting in safe mode for your hardware type or trying to remove the /var/db/.AppleSetupDone file and restarting.\n\n*Erase the Mac and install Big Sur (or whatever OS you want).\n\nIf you can’t get preference panes up after an erase, you either didn’t erase all the content or have a hardware / download problem. If it works, then you can decide to restore files from the user account as needed from backup.\n", "Q: Can't get inheriting TM to work (Big Sur) I have a similar problem as described in\nInheriting Time Machine and merging old history\nand after cross-checking the tmutil man page and other posts on the issue I am pretty sure that this solution should work for me as well.\nMy mount point on the old computer was 'Macintosh HD', the mount point on the new one is also 'Macintosh HD' but time machine created the new name 'Macintosh HD Data' for the snapshot volumes.

I just got a Dell P2421DC monitor and connected it through USB-C to my MacBook Pro 13'' from 2017 running on Big Sur 11.1. I know that the font won't be all crisp and Retina is just way better anyways, but I read that running it on 2048x1152 HiDPI would give me a better result for the fonts. Is it possible to do this with SwitchresX? I read so many posts already but just couldn't find a solution that works (since I'm not a coding expert anyways)...\n\nA: The Dell P2421DC is a 24\" 2560 x 1440 display. You can set your display to use 2048 x 1152 HiDPI, which will use the full pixel range, but scale objects up, making them appear larger. Whether text will be clearer will have to be seen. You'll also be taxing your graphics processing by scaling to a 1.25 factor, rather than whole number pixels.\nHold down ALT when you click on the 'Scaling' radio button in System Preferences > Displays to produce more options.\nYour monitor has has pixel density of 122 pixels per inch. A Mac Retina display typically has a density of 218 ppi. You're never going to get close to a Retina display clarity with that hardware.\nEarlier MacOS versions did have better smoothing for lower-density displays, but this has been removed, for reasons that only Apple knows about.\n\nA: In finder preferences make sure its check marked in the sidebar tab.\n", "Q: Macbook Air 2017 7.1 Disk is crashed?

I've had my Mac mini 2018 for just over two years. I am concerned that there has accumulated dust inside of the computer – not because anything seems problematic at the moment, but my experience with MacBook Pro laptops has been that you need to clean them every two years. There is usually a dust coasting landing on top of the Mac mini, so I am suspecting it needs to be cleaned also.\nIf I were to open the Mac mini and attempt to blow it clean with compressed air, would that void any remaining warranty?\nNB: I believe my product is actually already outside of Apple's limited warranty.

I found this page to be helpful:\nhttps://mrmacintosh.com/big-sur-installation-failed-an-error-occurred-while-installing-the-selected-updates/\nBasically you open Safari and access this URL to directly download the installer:\nhttp://swcdn.apple.com/content/downloads/50/49/001-79699-A_93OMDU5KFG/dkjnjkq9eax1n2wpf8rik5agns2z43ikqu/InstallAssistant.pkg\nFor me, it would pause every minute or so, but I just kept clicking resume and eventually I had downloaded the whole thing, and I was able to generate a working bootable installer that has worked on at least 2 macs for me.\n", "Q: Any suggestions for M1 optimized file comparison tool? I installed kdiff3 on my m1 mac using homebrew but it seems that it doesn't have an apple m1 optimized version and hence takes 2-3 secs to open. Does anyone know of a file comparison tool similar to kdiff3 that is fast on m1?\n\nA: A app called FileMerge is included with Apple's Xcode developer tools. It's a GUI app with a command-line variant called opendiff. FileMerge is optimized for M1 Macs. If you install Xcode, you'll find FileMerge at the path shown below and in the screenshot (it's a quick Spotlight search away as well):\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/FileMerge.app\n\n", "Q: Cannot install apps via macOS Big Sur App Store Since upgrading to macOS Big Sur (11.1), my system has been slow and laggy. Many applications upon first action seems to require a 2-4 second load to become responsive - once they've recovered that first time, things seem to be about as fast as they were on Catalina (no measurements, just perceptual observation).\nRecently, I tried to update Xcode to the latest (12.4) via the Mac App Store (3.0). The download seemed to complete, but the install wouldn't finish. I restarted the computer after 4 hours of not completing. Upon restarting, the install did not finish, so I thought I may need to reclaim some disk space. I went to download \"Cleaner One - Disk Clean\" from the Mac App Store. The app seemed to download but, too, could not finish the install. I restarted the computer again and tried to install the app again.\n\nThis time, it doesn't seem to even start the download, it just hangs at what appears to be 0% - the Launchpad says \"Waiting\". After this I decided to try, another app that I've never downloaded before (Just a random featured free app) \"MindNode - Mind Map & Outline\". This time the download starts and seemingly finishes, but stops at the end of the download and fails to install (the same thing I saw with the first attempt of installing \"Cleaner One\").\n\nSomething is obviously pretty borked here. I'm hoping someone knows somewhere to look to clean out whatever caches are preventing these from completing. I would go back to Catalina, but I think I need the latest macOS for the latest Xcode to develop for the latest iOS.\n\nA: Okay, I found the solution. I found an Apple Developer forum (that I had to access via Google cache for some reason) that discussed related issues.\nTo re-iterate here:\n\n*\n\n*Sign out of Mac App Store\n\n*\n\n*Store > Sign Out\n\n*\n\n\n\n*Navigate to ~/Library/Caches in Finder\n\n*\n\n*Keyboard Shortcut Cmd+Shift+G (Go to Folder)\n\n*Enter ~/Library/Caches\n\n*\n\n*Click \"Go\"\n\n\n\n*Find the following folders in the Finder window and move them to the trash\n\n*\n\n*com.apple.appstore\n\n*com.apple.appstoreagent\n\n\n\n*Reboot\n\n*\n\n* > Restart...\n\n\n\n*Launch Mac App Store & Sign in\nTesting App Store downloads/installs after the above steps seems to have resolved the issues.\n\nA: Sometime also if you go to system preferences then Security then unlock the lock thing in the left corner then choose to allow third party apps . Then get the app you want then lock it up back to just allow Apple apps again.\n", "Q: Startup Sign in screen MacBook Pro - Strange option box says Home - Switch with options of Keyboard, Pointer, or Location.

Unfortunately it requires SIP to be disabled not just during installation, but permanently. I'm trying to understand why that is, and whether there might be alternatives?\nFor instance, HoRDNS which faced similar problems you only need to temporarily disable it (https://github.com/jwise/HoRNDIS/issues/132)\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? My understanding of how all the kext stuff works is a little limited.\n\nA: You can selectively enable parts of System Integrity Protection.\nFor example, you can enable all of SIP except kernel extension protection with\ncsrutil enable --without kext\n\nSome other options to try listed in https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/17452, but the kext option sounds the most promising.\n", "Q: Why can I airdrop from my MacBook to my iPhone, but not my iPhone to my Macbook?

No problem.\n\n*On my phone, I say share with airdrop, my MacBook shows up, I click on it, and...nothing. Just sits on \"waiting.\"\n\nThey're both using the same network and have bluetooth on. There doesn't seem to be anything fundamentally blocking the transfer or preventing one device from detecting the other, since it works one direction and each device shows up as an airdrop option on the other.\nWhat could be causing my computer to not detect it's being sent something (or my phone to think its sending something without actually doing so)?\n\nA: I think this could be a problem of the Handoff feature. Deactivate Handoff both on your Mac and your iPhone. Wait for a couple of minutes and then turn Handoff on again on both devices and take care that both devices are unlocked at the same time!\n\nA: Since you are able to see your Mac on your iPhone, the Firewall configuration is most likely the reason for the exchange to fail.\nOn your Mac open System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Firewall.

It reported several hundred failed sectors on the drive, so I recommended we replace it.\nBefore replacing the hard drive in the iMac, I booted off an old hard drive from an old laptop using a USB to SATA adapter to make sure the iMac would boot off another drive, in other words, I wanted to make sure the problem was in fact the hard drive.  It booted fine, although I could not access the damaged internal drive as it was encrypted with FileVault.\nI went ahead and completed the hard drive replacement, putting in an SSD and connecting the damaged internal to my USB to SATA adapter.  I expected I could get the password for the old hard drive later to copy any data I could save from it.\nI used internet recovery to install the original OS that came on the iMac to the new SSD, and then upgraded to High Sierra, which is what my friend originally had on it.  The iMac now boots fine.\nThe problem I have is the former internal drive will not mount using the USB to SATA adapter, rather the iMac reports it is unreadable.  I also used the adapter to try and mount the hard drive on a MacBook Pro, but got the same warning,\nIs there something related to FileVault that would prevent this drive from working outside the iMac?

I am a teacher, and I am trying to verify the date and time when a student took a particular photo. The student has an iPhone (unknown model and OS version) and used the Scanner app by Luni to take the photo. The student says they can't find the date and time on their own, and I am not able to gain direct access to the student's phone due to covid-19 restrictions (the teaching is being done remotely).\nI don't have (and have never used) an iPhone, but I assume that if the photo still exists on the phone there is a way to recover the metadata. Could someone point me towards a step-by-step tutorial for how to find a file's metadata either in this particular app or in whatever file manager iOS has built in?\nTo be clear the student is entirely cooperative, but seems to not be very technically knowledgeable (or even comfortable with technology), and my total inexperience with iPhones renders me unable to provide detailed, specific instructions. I have tried finding an iPhone emulator I can run on Windows, but I can't seem to find one which is free (or freemium) where I can easily see how to get to the app store.\nEdit: If I get instructions for how to find metadata in a file manager, I will also need instructions for how to determine through the app what the location of the file is.\n\nA: In the App they can go to their scans, go to the export button at the top right, and click on iCloud. Then you can run this shortcut on their phone. If they haven't already they will need to enable untrusted shortcuts (i.e. third party shortcuts).\nInstead of using the shortcut, you could open the Files app, and go to iCloud Drive > ScanPlus.

How can I make Contacts love me again? Thanks!\n\nA: After a very frustrating, fruitless journey through all the online suggested fixes I could find, I eventually figured out the problem, somewhat by accident. Apparently, my system had two versions of the Contacts app installed, one that worked and one that didn't. I'm not sure how this happened but I have an idea.\nI keep my frequently used apps, including Contacts, in categorized folders within the Programs system folder. I drag these folders to my dock and open everything from there. The nonfunctional version of Contacts was in the dock folder. The functional version was in its default place in the Programs folder. Maybe the docked version became 'disconnected' from the contacts system database when I upgraded to Catalina and a new version of Contacts was installed in Programs?\nTo fix the problem, all I had to do was delete the nonfunctional version of Contacts and move the functional one to the dock where the old one used to be.

I have been keeping a track of the energy consumption on my Mac, and it only runs for 4 hours. I have reset my SMC after I upgraded to Big Sur. Is 4 hours normal? or should I go to the service center?\nUpdate on 3 Feb 2021:\nI submitted my Mac to the Apple service center they said they conducted a few tests and the conclusion was that the battery is fine (I don't know what type of test they did). So I guess I'll be using it on AC\nUpdate on 12 Feb 2021: Took it to the service center, they didn't find any issues so I started using Safari for work and my battery has improved by 1 hour on Average.\n\nA: You’re using Chrome. That is a known energy hog on macOS. You can observe this yourself by keeping Activity Monitor (/Applications/Utilities) open to the Energy tab while you’re working.\nLong battery life on modern computing platforms is the result of massive, massive amounts of engineering across all levels of the software stack. It requires adopting certain APIs and adhering to certain behaviors & best practices, and so it only works when all your software is well-written and well-behaved. Apple tries to make it straightforward for developers to adopt energy-saving practices, but that doesn’t mean that all software will. In particular, large and cross-platform apps (such as Chrome) will deviate from recommended design patterns for one reason or another, and this often causes all sorts of issues with energy usage (not to mention stability, performance, security, and privacy).\nShort story: Switch to Safari. Try it for a week. See if your battery life doesn’t double.\n\nA: 4 hours is not normal at all. It will need servicing.\nRemember that unless your workspace has no AC power, it is perfectly acceptable to run from the power adapter.\n\nA: You should download Coconut Battery.

Is it possible install the High Sierra in a USB stick and use that to run the installer?\nEdit: It was running Mojave when it died, I had noticed that it was running much slower than usual which is why I tried updating it.\nI was also wondering if it is possible to install Windows 10 in a different partition of the same external SSD since the stuff I need for work runs on it, however I can't get bootcamp to work without a internal SSD either.\n\nA: Below are some possible solutions.\n\n*\n\n*Replace the internal drive. This website shows replacement drives and links to installation videos.\n\n\n*Use another Mac with a working internal drive to upgrade the external drive to High Sierra or Mojave. Once completed, you Mac should boot from the upgraded external drive.\n\n\n*Try upgrading directly to Mojave, thus bypassing High Sierra.\n\n\n*Use an virtual machine to update to High Sierra. Here, the virtual machine would have a virtual internal and a physical external drive. Once the upgrade is complete, you should be able to boot from the upgrading external drive using the physical Mac.\n\n\n*Many answers explaining how to install Windows 10 on a external drive have been posted here at Ask Different. You could start with this answer. Since you have El Capitan installed on the external drive, you probably will have to adapt an existing answer.\n", "Q: Applescript is inexplicably failing in Big Sur EDIT: I've made a much simpler script that exhibits the same problem. The previous script is moved below.\nI've been using TextExpander to run this script and it recently started failing after updating to Big Sur. Thinking it was related to TextExpander, I created a similar shortcut to run it in BetterTouchTool but am having the same issue.

I have a question and its based on the situation below. The whole aim is to get certain important files out of my Macbook Air's backup.\nMy Macbook Air crashed and won't wake up at all anymore. Before it crashed, I was able to save all the files (128 GB) into a Time Machine backup on an external 1 TB hard drive.\nMy Macbook Pro is working. I want to save all of its files too (128 GB) through a Time Machine backup onto the same external 1 TB hard drive.\nI want to now use the Macbook Pro as a means to recover files from my Macbook Air. So I want to restore my Time Machine backup of my Macbook Air onto my Macbook Pro. However, after I get the files I want from my Macbook Air backup, I will replace this Time Machine backup with the backup I made for the Macbook Pro, so I get all the files of my Macbook Pro back onto the Macbook Pro and the files of my Macbook Air are kept in the external 1 TB hard drive.\nIs this achievable using Time Machine, and if not, what should I do?- M.\n\nA: It is possible to use an external drive to back up two Macs via Time Machine. Per this thread, the backups will be stored separately, without any special setup needed.\nPer pulling specific files from another Time Machine backup, you may want to refer to this thread. It should be doable to search that backup volume without having to install the entire backup onto another machine using the restore feature.\n\nA: In a nutshell, Apple backups do not merge, so you need a plan to merge settings or data for items like photos, contacts, keychain. Other than that, it’s perfectly cromulent to have one drive contain two or more separate backups, independent of each other.\nDo the backups, and then ask a follow on question that’s narrowed to how to merge any one set of data. Documents and files will be easy, but the other app databases can be tricky and depend heavily on the exact version of macOS don’t to the build or minor version in some cases.\n", "Q: Is it possible to connect to AirPods Pro via keyboard shortcut?

I just realized that I have a folder and OneNote Notebook (that is located in a another folder) with the same name. Is this a bad idea? Could the filesystem mix them up?\n\nA: You can easily have files (and directories) with the same name in different directories. You actually already do, even a plain macOS installation contains files/directories with the same name in different directories) (e.g. /System/Library and /Library, and then ~/Library for each user account).\n\nA: No, it isn't a bad idea. No, the filesystem won't mix them up as the file system keeps track of files and folders not just with their name but also by their type and the complete path (location) to it.\nFor example, if you create a folder named Documents in the Desktop and another folder named Documents in your Home directory, the filesystem won't mind as they are in different locations -\none will be at /Users/Katrine/Desktop/Documents\nwhile the other will be at /Users/Katrine/Documents.\nThe filesystem also keeps track of whether something is a file or a folder. So a file and a folder can have the same name too without any conflicts. But you can't have 2 files (or 2 folders) with the same name in a common folder.\nWhat about 2 different types of files - like a word document and a photo?\nAgain, they can have the same name because the filesystem knows they are different files (technically, they actually don't have the same name because of the extensions in their name - the .docx part for word files and .jpeg part for photos - which is also how the filesystem knows they are different.).\n", "Q: Unable to open Anywhere option from Gatekeeper in order to open apps not from Mac App Store I was following this guide to open a Mac app from an unidentified developer.\nSo I open Terminal and enter the following code to get the Anywhere option\nsudo spctl --master-disable\n\nThis leads to the following output\nobjc[7234]: Class SPExecutionPolicy is implemented in both /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/SystemPolicy.framework/Versions/A/SystemPolicy and /usr/sbin/spctl.

Using macOS Big Sur Ver 11.1\n\nA: If you download an application from the internet, then the following steps can be taken to open the application. Here the Startup application is used as an example.\nI downloaded the Startup application from the SourceForge project Startup for rEFInd. Here is my Downloads folder.\n\nNote: In Finder preferences, I have Show all filename extensions checked off.\n\n\nWhen I double clicked on Startup.app, I received the following popup.\n\nI selected the Cancel button. Next, I opened the Security & Privacy pane of the System Preferences application, as shown below.\n\nHere, I selected Open Anyway and the the following popup occurred.\n\nHere, I selected Open and the application opened.\n\nThe above steps only had to be done once. Afterwards, the application could be opened by simply double clicking on the icon.\n\nNote: The above steps did not remove the com.apple.quarantine extended attribute placed on any files or folders.\nHow to Avoid the Above Steps\nWhen a file is downloaded, the extended attribute named com.apple.quarantine is placed on the file. This is what initially kept the Startup the application from opening. The following steps can be taken to remove the com.apple.quarantine extended attribute from the application.\n\nIf you want to test these steps, then you will probably what to put any existing Startup application in the trash, and download a new copy of the application.\n\nRight click the application in the Finder window and select New Terminal at Folder, as shown below.\n\nThis will open a Terminal application window, as shown below.\n\nEnter the following command, as shown in the image below.\nxattr -rd com.apple.quarantine .\n\n\nNext, close the Terminal application window. Now you can open the application normally.\n\nA: You don’t fix the output. Apple shipped both classes so Apple has to patch the libraries that spctl links against to “fix” that log message.\nIt doesn’t harm any function I can test, so it’s highly likely it has no bearing to your running of spctl.

When the fans spin up like this, the applications I am using (typically Chrome, but others too), will work for a little while, ~30 seconds, and then become unresponsive. I am not even able to restart the iMac from the Apple menu (it just doesn't respond). Eventually, I get the \"rainbow circle\" (beach ball?) mouse cursor and I can't do anything else other than move the mouse around. If I keep waiting, the screen goes black and if I wait a longer time the black screen gets a circle with a slash through it. What I normally do is just power cycle the iMac as soon as I hear the fans spin up and the applications become unresponsive. The system crashes this way usually at least once and often a few times per day if I use it a lot.\nHere's what I've done so far to troubleshoot:\n\n*\n\n*After power-cycling, I go into Console.App, and select \"Crash Reports\" on the sidebar, it is always empty. Is it correct to assume that this means it was not an application that crashed?\n\n\n*I've tried sifting through the logs looking near the time of the crash, and I don't notice anything obviously strange, basically just normal looking logs and then boot-up messages. The problem is there's A LOT of messages. I am looking for \"grave\" sounding messages, but I honestly don't know what, exactly, to look for. Is it possible there's no clues in the logs?\n\n\n*I've run Memtest86, it passes all four passes. No failures detected.\n\n\n*I've wiped the machine and re-installed the OS about 3 times. The problem persists. I am on Catalina now, but this has been happening even with the previous OS, Mojave.\n\n\n*I've tried not using some Applications that are long-running. I've tried switching from Chrome to firefox, and disabled dropbox. No change.\n\n\n*Fan RPM's and Die Temps appear normal. I do notice that when the system crashes, these no longer update. Could it be a thermal issue that happens so fast, the system crashes before the sensors log the problem? I am not doing anything super-taxing to the system. I have noticed at least one spike in CPU temperature before around the time of a crash, but I haven't been able to see that consistently.\n\n\n*I cleared out the /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports directory, and used the machine normally until the next crash. After the crash, the directory had a bunch of files. None of them had a suspicious filename extension (eg .panic, .spin, .tailspin).

I understand that will mean it's a hardware issue, but what component/sub-system?\n\nActually, the overwhelming majority of unstable behavior these days is due to software (and occasionally firmware) bugs. Your symptoms don’t smell like hardware failure, particularly since you’ve tested both your HDD and your DRAM. There is very likely a software cause and fix for this.\n\nA: This may not be a definite answer, but since I have a iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2013), I might as well post my observations.\nThe internal drive on this Mac is a 1 TB HDD. The Mac did not start significantly slowing down until I installed Mojave, This is also where APFS was first used. Upgrading to Catalina did not help much.\nThere have been posts here at Ask Different which after reading I came to the conclusion that if APFS is employed, then you need a SSD. Being that the Mac can not up upgraded beyond Catalina, I was not really willing to open the Mac. So I pursued adding an external SSD. There is really nothing out there for Thunderbolt that I did not consider prohibitively expensive. USB 3.1 gen 1 (which is USB 3 or 5 Gb/s) SDD drives have come down in price and have type A plugs. (Both the 21.5\" and 27\" late 2013 iMacs have USB 3 jacks.) I choose an Inland Professional 480GB SSD which cost 55 USD. However, the USB cable was to short, but I already had a longer spare. This significantly improved the performance of my iMac.\n\nI can run Big Sur in a VirtualBox virtual machine with better performance than when I ran Catalina on the internal HDD. (Yes, it does seem odd that you can not run Big Sur on the actually iMac, but you can in a virtual machine without having to perform any special hacks or modifications.)\n\nI have been using the new external SSD for a month and only had one occasion where the problem you described with the fan speeding up followed by the Mac hanging. This was when I was working on a solution to question for Ask Different and Big Sur hung. This caused VirtualBox to hang and eventually the entire iMac. Anyway, the problem was definitely caused by the VirtualBox application.\nYou say you tried Chrome and Firefox. You might consider Microsoft Edge.\nOne other concern is there does not seem to be any indication of trim support for the external USB SSD. This may result in the drive eventually slowing down, but so far there is no indication of this happening.\nYou seem willing to open your Mac and replace the existing fusion drive. I wonder if you could not keep the existing drive and just add a SSD. There is some indication that you could add a secondary SSD \"Blade\" drive. Being a PCIe connection, this should result in significantly better performance that the existing primary SATA fusion drive. See OWC website for more information and videos.\n\nA: I've been following this thread and ones like it for a while because my late 2013 27\" iMac does the same exact thing the OP describes. It's infuriating. I've done brand new clean installs without adding any other software and the hang will still eventually occur. I've ran Catalina both with and without the 2021 update and the hang still occurs. This led me to believe it must have been a hardware issue, so I bit the bullet and did a boot camp install of windows 10... I've ran it for several days now, doing various tasks without any hiccups or hangs. This tells me it's not a hardware thing (as people here had already deduced) but I thoght I'd just add my experience in support of that idea. Still would love to figure out the issue though. I have no desire to run windows, nor do I want to keep my fingers crossed that I won't need to restart a critical workflow all over again should my machine decide to go belly up at some random moment\n", "Q: Is it possible to localize the Mac Welcome Assistant Language to be non English?

From there, the iMac simply refused to start up. It would get halfway through a very slow boot up - i.e. loading bar gets halfway - then simply turn off and die.\nHere is what I have tried, and the various results for each:\n\nMy attempts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Safe Mode - I attempted to boot into Safe Mode by holding  shift  when I turned the computer on. Unfortunately it simply doesn't get to Safe Mode, the iMac turns off half way.\n\n\n*Recovery Mode - I attempted to boot into Recovery Mode by holding  Cmd  +  R and succeeded, but when I attempted to perform first-aid on the drive, I got this:\n\n\n\n*Booting into a different drive - I only have the recovery drive separate, so same result as (2).\n\n\n*Performed Apple Diagnostics (on my iMac known as Apple Hardware Test) by holding  D  on startup. I ended up with error code -3403D.\n\n\n*Reset NVRAM multiple times by pressing Option  + Cmd  + P  +  R - no change.\n\n\n*Reset SMC multiple times by unplugging. No change.\n\n\n*Booted into Verbose Mode - everything went smoothly until it got to checking the Catalog File, where it stopped, before spewing an error message and shutting down after 3 seconds.\n\n\n*Booted into Single Boot Mode by holding  Cmd + S on startup and typing fsck -fy. I repeated this over and over but it didn't say anything different, just that the drive couldn't be verified completely.\n\nQuestion:\n\n\nI'm aware there may be ways to fix this by reinstalling MacOS. I'm also aware that this could be a hard drive issue, however, I'd like to exhaust all other options before I consider that. Are there any other ways anybody knows hot to fix this?\n\n\nNote:\n\nI'd like to note that now, a few weeks after the initial issue the iMac only makes it quarter way through the boot before turning off.\nI'd also like to note that I have seen these websites:\nhttps://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/solved-macbook-pro-booting-stuck-halfway/\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/8464773\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/8381789\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7051661\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/218110/Why+does+my+iMac+shutdown+halfway+through+loading+on+startup\niMac gets stuck halfway through boot\nBut nothing has worked. Can the Apple Stack Exchange Community help me better?\n\nThanks!\n\n\nA: I've seen this issue quite a few times before. For me, I booted into Single Boot Mode by holding Cmd + S on startup and typing fsck -fy. Let that process run and keep repeating it over and over until it says the volume is ok.\n\nA: At this point we can pretty much guarantee that the operating system on the drive is dead. Repeated attempts by fsck all failing points to that conclusion.\nIf you don't want the data then I'd attempt a reformat and re-install of the OS. If you do want the data then I'd see if it could start up in Thunderbolt mode and attach it to another Mac and use \"Carbon Copy Cloner\" or similar to copy the data off, then erase and re-install. Since it does come up in single user mode you could also try attaching an external drive then mounting by hand and use rsync from the command line to copy the data off.\nI assume that the hard drive is more than ten years old so I'd consider finding somebody to replace it or spend your pennies on a newer second hand Mac.\n\nA: Your filesystem is corrupted. That may not be the ultimate root cause of all this, but you won’t get any further in your debugging until you can repair your drive. Only then can we determine if there is a deeper issue that caused the corruption in the first place (e.g., a hardware failure in your DRAM).\nSince fsck has failed but you’re booting off an HFS volume and not an APFS volume, DiskWarrior may be able to help you. Note that, depending on the nature of the corruption, there is no guarantee that it will be able to fully repair your drive, but I’ve had several drives over the years that were saved by DiskWarrior when fsck / Disk Utility could not.\nIf you have access to a second computer and the appropriate cable to connect the two, I strongly recommend performing your DiskWarrior repair from the second computer via Target Disk Mode (reboot the iMac with the T key). This is in case the root cause is a hardware failure on your iMac; you want to minimize how much code is run on it when you’re working with a live mounted volume.\n(Even better would be opening the iMac and physically removing the HDD, but that requires a special tool to remove the display and an external HDD enclosure.)\nIf DiskWarrior fails, you will need to erase and restore your data. There’s nothing else that can be done about a corrupt filesystem. If you don’t have a full backup from which to restore, you can *try* to boot into Target Disk Mode and use your second computer to copy (your most important files FIRST!) to a known-good drive. Be advised that that may be a race against the clock and you shouldn’t expect to achieve full extraction.\n", "Q: How to copy/export emails from old iPhone I use iPhone’s Mail app to get my emails. I got a new iPhone and found emails are not copied from the old iPhone. It seems the logic is to download emails from the email servers again. However, one of the email service has shut down and no service anymore. How can I retrieve/export emails from this email account? I have catched emails in my old iPhone.\n\nA: If at least one of the Mail Accounts available on both phones you can\n\n*\n\n*create a mail folder in this account\n\n*copy all mails from the shutdown account into this folder (on the old phone)\n\n*wait a while to have the phone sync the mail folder back to the Server\n\n*access the Mail folder from your new phone\n\n\nA: Turns out I was completely wrong in assuming that you could Backup non-iCloud emails either on to iCloud or to a computer.\nEven though Apple docs say:\n\nSome information is not included in an iCloud backup but can be added\nto iCloud and shared across multiple device, such as Mail, Health\ndata, call history and files you store in iCloud Drive.\n\nEmails from your device cannot be copied to iCloud Drive even if you enable the Mail app to use iCloud Drive.\n\n*\n\n*When you enable 'Mail' in iCloud Settings, it only enables your iCloud email account to use it with the Mail app.\n\n\n*When you enable 'Mail' in iCloud Drive Settings, it only backups and saves all your email accounts settings and 'Mail' app preferences.\nBoth options do not save a copy of all the emails in your device to iCloud. (You can however save email attachments manually to iCloud drive).\nAnother option is to create Backups to a computer. But even choosing to opt to backup \"all data\" on your device to your computer, using iTunes -\n\ndoes not copy your emails to the backup - only the email account settings and Mail app preferences are saved in the backup.\nSo the only way to copy and transfer non-iCloud emails that you no longer have access to, is to transfer the emails to another active IMAP enabled email account on Mail, as described in this answer, and then download it again on to the new device.\n", "Q: Script menu: how to reference user-path utilities (PATH / environment is missing) Summary\nHow can I execute scripts from the system-wide Script menu with a normal environment? It seems the environment is not being setup at all.\nScripts that are run from the script menu can find and execute commands from the base system. However, user-installed utilities are not found on the path. Also, /usr/bin/env foo is not finding commands that are installed outside of the base system.\nBackground\nThe system Script menu appears at the right side of the menu bar. It is enabled via Script Editor.app > Preferences > Show Script menu in menu bar. It displays scripts located in ~/Library/Scripts and other system locations. The menu can execute AppleScript, JXA, bash, python and other scripts (use shebang as needed).\n\nInvestigation So Far\nScripts that are run from the Script menu don't inherit the user's bash environment. They know the shell is BASH and your USER name, but no initialization occurs. I ran a little script to dump the env to a text file\n~/Library/Scripts/dump_env.sh (be sure to make executable):\n#!/bin/bash\nenv > ~/env.txt\nps -ef >> ~/env.txt\n\nHere are the interesting entries.\nUSER=mat\nLOGNAME=mat\nSHELL=/bin/bash\nPATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\nPWD=/\nHOME=/Users/mat\n_=/usr/bin/env\n\nIt is very vanilla. None of the custom paths are included. For example, the following are unavailable:\n/usr/local/bin/svn # Subversion source control client\n/opt/local/bin/python3 # python3 installed via MacPorts\n~/bin\n\nThe latter two are normally sourced in my .bash_profile. /usr/local/bin/ is setup by path_helper which is called by /etc/profile (though apparently not for the Script menu).\nI'm running macOS 10.13 High Sierra, but I'm interested whether others are getting different results.\nIdeal Solution\n\n*\n\n*Avoid hard-coding path to executables in shebang. Ex: if I install a different python version / distribution, I want to use it in all my scripts. /usr/bin/env python3 accomplishes this, but it seems to depend on the PATH?\n\n*Finds utilities in /usr/local/bin\n\n*Specify PATH once for CLI and Script menu (and GUI?). If I install a new Python I would like it to be used everywhere.\n\n*Specify PATH only for user-level processes. I don't want system processes using binaries from in my add-on path entries (especially user-permissioned path entries).\n\n*Avoid breaking 3rd party builds/installers/programs that were written with assumptions about what is present on my macOS install.\n\nI'm looking into launchctl, which can be used to setup environment for GUI apps. Not sure if it still works or if it will work with the Script menu.\nUpdate\n\nI added trace statements to all of the bash environment files: /profile, /bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bashrc. These statements export environment variable so I can see that the file has been sourced. None of these are getting run for scripts run from the Script menu.\nlaunchctl setenv KEY VALUE will set an environmental variable for all processes subsequently launched by launch services (launchd) in the user space.\nThis works for Terminal.app, GUI applications and scripts that are double-clicked in the Finder. However, it does not work for the Script menu.\nI added ps -ef to the dump_env.sh script. This tells me the Script menu is not invoking bash with any arguments that would strip the environment (such as -r or -p). The parent process is UserScriptService.\nRunning…\notool -tV /System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Versions/C/XPCServices/com.apple.foundation.UserScriptService.xpc/Contents/MacOS/com.apple.foundation.UserScriptService.\n\n…reveals a symbol named __NSUserScriptTaskServiceStart. This sounds awfully similar to NSUserScriptTask in the CoreFoundation API. From the API doc:\n\nThe NSUserScriptTask class is able to run all the scripts normally run by the one of its subclasses…\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuserscripttask?language=objc\nI strongly suspect this is what the Script menu uses to execute scripts. The API doc does says nothing about the script's runtime environment.\n\nA: bash can startup in three different ways and how it uses rc files is different in each case.\nTo give a short answer when it is called as a login shell it reads .profile or .bash_profile to set things like PATH. When it is called as an interactive shell but not a login shell, say you run bash from the command line, then it reads ~/.bashrc to set these things.\nIf it's run from a shell script (or by launchctl) then it looks for an environment variable BASH_ENV and runs the file named in the variable.\nCheck https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Startup-Files.html\nTo answer your question you should set all variables in .bashrc, call that in your .bash_profile file with the line if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then source ~/.bashrc; fi Finally in .bashrc you should set the BASH_ENV variable export BASH_ENV='.bashrc'\nThis would then give you a PATH and so on everywhere.\nWhen you move to the zsh shell things are slightly different, read http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Intro/intro_3.html\nMost Mac admins and engineers ignore it all and we hard code the path to all our software in scripts. I've certainly never seen an Apple script that didn't have all the tool paths hard coded.\n", "Q: What version of iTunes dropped synchronization support for iPod Classic? I have an 6th generation iPod Classic (model MC297LL).  Current versions of iTunes no longer support this device, so I'm using an older Mac to sync my music, using iTunes 10.5.2.  My primary machine is a 2015 \"Core i7\" MacBook Pro (model MacBookPro11,4).\nTo avoid having to keep a decade+ old desktop computer set up in my house, I was hoping there might be an OS version compatible with my MacBook Pro that I could install that had a still-compatible version of iTunes.  Specifically, I plan to install it as a bootable partition on an external drive.\nAccording to this OS compatibility chart, the oldest version of the OS that can be run on my laptop is OS X Yosemite 10.10.3.  I've installed OS 10.10.5 using the installer proved by Apple in its How to get old versions of macOS documentation.  This comes included with iTunes 12.2.1.16.  However, I do not see my iPod Classic show up when I connect it, which leads me to suspect this version of iTunes is too new.\nBefore I spend even more time tracking down and installing version 10.10.3 of OS X and/or an older version of iTunes compatible with Yosemite, I would like to know whether this is even doable on this machine.  The History of iTunes Wikipedia article makes no mention of when support for the iPod Classic was dropped from iTunes, and I have not had luck finding this information in a web search.\nWhat version of iTunes dropped support for syncing music with the iPod Classic?  What is the latest version of iTunes that supports it, and the latest version of the Macintosh operating system that it can be run on?\n\nA: iPod classic continues to be supported when device syncing was moved from iTunes into the Finder. No device support was removed from iTunes.\nIf you're having trouble synchronising an iPod with a newer Mac, that sounds like a specific issue that would warrant a specific question.\nI can't find the Twitter thread I saw on this topic, but I've found this video that also demonstrates it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV3itfJyyMM.\n\nAn Apple Support article for Big Sur also mentions syncing of iPod classic/nano/shuffle: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchl923c1147/mac\n", "Q: SecurtiyAgent process offload work to SecurityAgentHelper Projects like Nomad-login (or nowadays Jamf-connect) use to modify the mechanism list in system.login.console authorizationRight.\nI see that non-privileged mechanisms runs by SecurityAgent process, but it can sometimes delegate another process called SecurityAgentHelper which is an xpc service.\nI wonder if the role of process SecurityAgentHelper is to serve as fallback to SecurityAgent and under what conditions does it offload task for the helper process.\nThanks !\n\nA: Stability and Privilege Separation\nXPC services are used to isolate sections of a process that require specific security considerations. SecurityAgent will pass SecurityAgentHelper work that needs to be isolated. It will not act as a fallback; this is not the intention of XPC services.\nSee Apple's Creating XPC Services for a detailed explanation of XPC Service's role and design:\n\nThe XPC Services API, part of libSystem, provides a lightweight mechanism for basic interprocess communication integrated with Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) and launchd. The XPC Services API allows you to create lightweight helper tools, called XPC services, that perform work on behalf of your application.\nThere are two main reasons to use XPC services: privilege separation and stability.\n\n", "Q: Android Studio emulator not launching on macOS (Big Sur) macOS Big Sur 11.1, Android Studio 4.1.2\nBased on some similar issues I found online, I attempted to uninstall and reinstall Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer)from Android Studio itself. But also got an error:\n\nInstallation did not complete successfully. See the IDE log for details\n\nWhere can I find the IDE log and what is the possible solution that will fix the emulator issue?\n\nA: You can find the logs from the option in the Help menu, which opens\n~/Library/Logs/AndroidStudio/idea.log\n\n", "Q: AppleScript and shell script issue I used to run a shell command with AppleScript for authentication to a radius server, this was running fine as I could specify a parameter for the password.\nthe shell process was updated and don't accept the password parameter anymore and have to be done separately (prompted by terminal), so in terminal its look like it\n~mycommand authenticate -username \n~password\n\nunless I'm wrong \"do shell script\"m run in different instance so it's no point doing\ndo shell script + auth command\ndo shell script + password\n\nis they anyway I can still use AppleScript and somehow let AppleScript answer with the password?\n\nA: The following example AppleScript code shows an example of how it could be coded for iTerm2.\nset myPassword to text returned of ¬\n    (display dialog \"Enter Password:\" default answer \"\" with hidden answer)\n\ntell application \"iTerm\"\n    set myWindow to (create window with default profile)\n    tell myWindow to tell the current session\n        write text \"echo mycommand authenticate -username\"\n        delay 1\n        write text \"echo \" & myPassword\n        delay 1\n    end tell\n    close myWindow\nend tell\n\n\nNotes:\nAs coded, it uses echo just for testing purposes, obviously you'd remove echo and \"echo \" &  for production run.\nThe delay commands may need to be adjusted, or may not be necessary at all.

Traced 315257 (Uncompressed 801776) **\n\nWhat is the possible reason of the crash ?\n\nA: These are hard to debug specifically, but if you want to, set up the Mac to save the core dump file (or send them to a network server that collects cores) and use a second Mac to inspect the call trace.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/debugging_a_custom_kernel_extension\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/download/more/\nThe second link covers how to get the KDK which is the kit that helps debug and log more details. You have a report, but it’s likely there’s not enough detail to trace back what actually happened. Everyone can see the debris from an accident, but all the evidence wasn’t collected by default. The KDK sets up a forensic situation where you could definitively answer what happened after the fact.\nOn Intel, the nature of a panic is the same at a high level, but very different in the specifics for your Apple Silicon based mini with an M1 CPU. Here is an archived article from Intel days that explains the basics very well. Forgive the kitchen metaphor if you’re well read on machine language faults already or the idea of kernel space crashes.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2063/_index.html\n\nIn UNIX, a panic is an unrecoverable system error detected by the kernel as opposed to similar errors detected by user space code.\n\nThe core is not in a logical state to continue, basically. Why did this happen? Odds are it’s hardware putting a value in the software didn’t ever expect to see. Like if you told the code to expect one to three fruits as input to make a smoothie and instead a dead rat showed up to be processed. The kitchen shuts down to figure out what the heck is going on rather than make a dead rat smoothie as previously instructed from one to three fruits.\n\nHowever, most panics are the result of unhandled processor exceptions in kernel code, such as references to invalid memory addresses. These are typically indicative of a bug somewhere in the call chain leading up to the panic.\n\nSo, Apple might make code to say, dispose of dead rodents and then wait for more fruits to make smoothies. Then the next time, a “dead rat exception” would be handled until say 4 fruits show up. Then more handlers need to be written or the kernel changed yet again...\n\nA: The panic string shows a timeout while waiting for the Bluetooth stack to power down. This is quite likely a bug on Apple’s side and there isn’t much you can do about it yourself beyond reporting it to Apple. If this is reproducible, that’s helpful for us & them to know.\nAs a workaround, you can try disabling Bluetooth and see if the problem goes away.\n", "Q: What advantages are there to removing a stolen device from your iCloud account? Apple's stolen iPhone advice lists the final step - after having erased the device - as:\n\n\n*Remove your lost or stolen device from your list of trusted devices.\n\nHowever, it is clear from the \"If the previous owner isn't with you\" section of How to remove Activation Lock that this will remove the lock and allow the thief to use/sell the phone. This has been discussed previously and it also seems clear that the erased and logged-out device will not pose a security risk to your account. It thus seems like terrible advice. Furthermore, it is not hard to find examples of people removing their device too soon (such as before it has been erased).\nI can only see this step as adding value to thieves. It would surely be better to instead provide additional warnings when removing a device of what the consequences are for Find My and activation lock etc. Why would Apple possibly advise this? Are there any advantages to doing it?\n\nA: Once you reach step 6 you are in effect abandoning the device.\nSome company phones are considered less valuable than the data they contain. Stripping the last remaining link to the previous user is therefore considered a better option.\n\nA: I can't remember if I tried removing it myself or if it has somehow timed out but the device is no longer present in the list of iCloud devices despite being listed in Find My. I think the comments to the question contain the correct answer - activation lock can be maintained even when following the instructions to remove from the iCloud account.\n", "Q: External iSight camera with M1 Mac? I'm attempting to use a 2003-era external Apple iSight Camera with an M1 Mac mini via adapters:\n\niSight > FireWire 400 > FireWire 800 > Thunderbolt 2 > Thunderbolt 3\n\nThis same adapter chain works for video on a 2019 Intel MacBook Pro running macOS 10.15.6 Catalina.

Works on my 2017 27\" iMac but no audio.\nThis video indicates that the iSight camera needs to be updated to Firmware 1.0.3 for the audio to work properly.\nFor the updater you would need an older Mac. I have an old PowerPC G5 but have not hook it up to see if the updater would work on it but I plan to try it soon.\n\n*\n\n*How to update external iSight firmware?\n\n*External iSight microphone audio not working\nI did see on one of Apple's pages that it indicated an external iSight will work with Big Sur. No confirmation if it includes Big Sur.\nIt doesn't work at all on my M1 Mini but system info can see it so that to me indicates the connection is good.\nWhen I called to ask Apple about it the person wasn't of any help. They actually had not heard of an iSight camera, internal or external, before. The best they could do was get provide the link to the updater.\n\nA: This is what happens when drivers to recognize the specific features connected via a physical bus are lacking. Great triage and notes, and who knows if someone at Apple would take the time or risk to include the drivers needed for this to work. The clear “no support” for Vintage products means it would be a big exception.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624\nHowever, the heart doesn’t care about rules like this, so I too love the design of that camera and am keeping the cables and hardware in my kit and hope to get a vintage computer some day to put it all back in “service”.

Since installing an update to 10.13.6 (From 10.13.3, I believe) the computer freezes once the progress bar fills up on the login screen. Rebooting has not resolved the issue. I have tried to enter safe mode and recovery mode (Command-R); the result is the same, and the computer will not transition to the recovery mode interface.\nOption-command-R and Shift-option-command-R generate error messages -5101 and -2003 respectively, which don’t seem to be often  cited on these forums. Similarly, a PRAM/NVRAM reset has been unhelpful.\nSingle user mode (Command-S) works fine, but I haven’t found any set of commands which has fixed my problem. Verbose mode is inconclusive, and the text stops updating after a minute or two, except for ‘busy timeout ‘IGPU’’ messages. I have also considered that this may be a hardware issue, but have never experienced problems with this laptop before.\nHas anyone experienced something like this before or does anyone have a possible solution?\nCheers\nEdit:  Attached are two images of the final screen before timeout messages start happening. The command line doesn’t seem entirely consistent each time I start it up: some additional messages appeared here. Unfortunately, it doesn’t let me post a video.\n\n\nNote: the image at the bottom is of the latest state of the screen.\nRegarding Target Disk mode, I don’t have a second computer on hand right now, but I’d be able to set that up in the near future. I don’t have an external display.)\n\nUPDATE 2:\n\n![enter image description here]\n(https://i.stack.imgur.com/04dfs.jpg)\n\n\nThese are logs after entering the command ‘exit’. I got IGPU messages after this; this time though, the syntax is ‘kextd stall, (240s): ‘IGPU’. Hopefully this is helpful, but from what I understand it could mean any number of things. Presumably the AppleKeyStore messages are also useful?\n\n*\n\n*I now have access to another computer. Since this mode is mostly used to get files from a Mac, what specifically should I be looking out for?\n\n\n*As I mentioned initially, ‘Option-Command-R’ and ‘Shift-Option-Command-R’ don’t work either: I have since tried them again, and ‘Option-Command-R’ returns error message -5101 (after typing in correct internet password). ‘Shift-Option-Command-R’ boots into Internet Recovery (with the spinning globe), but then seems to go back to the login screen, which is always a dead end.\nSo I guess I should be looking for any fix to this which doesn’t  require the login screen to take effect. I haven’t been able to find a solution allowing me to reinstall macOS and bypass recovery mode - is that possible?\nEDIT: When the Mac is on, I also sporadically get the voiceover message ‘To choose English as your main language, press the ‘return’ key...’ I think this has something to do with recovery mode.\n\nA: *\n\n*Can you provide screenshots/videos of the console text during verbose boot?\n\n*Do you have a second computer and a USB or Thunderbolt cable that you can use for booting your MacBook into Target Disk Mode (hold T during boot) to run Disk Utility on the hard drive?\n\n*(Unlikely to help but might be worth a shot if convenient.) Do you have an external display that you can attach to the MacBook and try booting while in clamshell mode? (Attach the display with the computer off, press the power key, and close the lid.) Trying to wiggle a GPU-related variable here, given your IGPU timeout messages.\n\nUltimately you may need a reinstall of macOS but let’s try to debug incrementally. The fact that single user mode works is a very important clue.\nUPDATE 1:\nWith the additional data,\nI can’t tell immediately from your boot logs what the root cause is, but it’s clear that your IGPU driver is unhappy. Single user mode works because it doesn’t require switching to accelerated graphics (but, then, neither should Safe Mode).\nIt may be interesting to capture logs from the point after you enter single user mode and then type exit. Make sure you’re entering verbose mode first (i.e., hold CommandV upon reboot and then immediately switch to CommandS once you see console text). I suspect we’ll stall at IGPU timeouts again.\nBeyond this point, you can try two paths.\n\n*\n\n*We can wait until you get a second computer available for Target Disk Mode and try to debug this incrementally.\n\n*We can try Internet Recovery and try either a newer or older OS via OptionCommandR or ShiftOptionCommandR, respectively. (How to Install macOS via Recovery Mode)\n\nI would personally give #2 a try right now.\nUPDATE 2:\nIt’s unusual for Recovery mode to fail to transition to graphics mode while single user mode works fine. The new logs didn’t reveal a root cause to me either, other than reconfirming that we aren’t able to enable accelerated graphics in the GPU and thus enter graphics mode.\n\n*\n\n*I’m always reluctant to suspect a hardware failure until we’ve ruled out software issues, which are far more common, but I would encourage you to run Apple Diagnostics if you haven’t already: Hold D during boot.\n\n*If diags passes, use Target Disk Mode to run Disk Utility on your SSD through your second computer.\n\n*If the scan completes successfully and finds no corruption, I would take this opportunity to make a full backup of your drive, as it’s looking increasingly likely that you’ll need to do an erase-install as a workaround in lieu of root-causing this yourself.\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to operate the camera of a disassembled iPhone X? I recently disassembled my iPhone X; to straightforwardly ask, is there a way to operate the rear camera of this model? There are all the necessary parts: the display, central processor, the front camera with the TrueDepth sensor, and the rear camera.\nI want to operate the camera using an external input device; store the images and recordings taken in an external storage.\nWould using Arduino or Raspberry Pi be an option?\n\n\nA: Yes, you can. How is a very difficult question to answer.\nBroadly, as with developing any embedded electronic project, you first have to correctly identify each part, and obtain its technical specification / manual from the manufacturer. This will tell you what each part does and how to assemble and connect them all together. The second part is even more difficult - if the manufacturer doesn't provide a ready made software (or atleast a device driver or template software that you can customize), you will have to write the software / program yourself to use the hardware correctly. (in iPhone, this part is handled by iOS and the camera app.)\nSo if you are familiar with electronics and embedded technology, and embedded programming, you should be able to do this.\nRealistically, it is a very diffult task and will take a lot of time and new skillsets. It would be better to start with a smaller and easier electronic project before trying this.\nGo for it if you are interested in patiently learning these skills. Even if you fail, you will still learn a lot. (Take inspiration from Alyssa, a young woman, student and hacker who is progressing on reverse engineering Apple's GPU in its new ARM processors, to create a linux driver for it).\nThe knowledgeable people at iFixit may be able to help you identify the parts, and even obtain the technical schematics on it. You can also ask for more help and advice from the Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange and Reddit Embedded forum.\n\nA: This is one of the cases where \"if you have to ask, you'll never know\" is applicable.\nThere's no published solution for your problem available. In theory it could very well be possible, but in practice no - you cannot do this. Apple does not publish the types of details about their camera units, nor does Arduinos or Raspberry Pis have a compatible connector - not mentioning all the other stuff you'll need (like drivers for instance).\n", "Q: macOS Cannot Create Valid Symlink From Terminal Using Relative Paths Using the following snippet it creates an invalid symlink. But according to other answers it should work fine.\n# make a temp dir and save path to var.\n# set dir (mktemp -d)  # fish shell only!\ndir=$(mktemp -d)  # bash/zsh\ncd $dir\nmkdir a b\necho 'text file' > a/file.txt\nln -s a/file.txt b/\nopen .\n\nWhen you see the symlink in Finder it doesn't recognise the file type in Quick Preview and when you open it Finder complains 'the original item cannot be found'.\n\nIf you use absolute paths everything works fine. See below:\nrm b/file.txt\nln -s $dir/a/file.txt $dir/b/\nopen .\n\nThen you can see symlink is correctly make and you can even read the file content in Quick Preview.\nHow is this happening? I've checked that ln is /bin/ln. I'm on macOS Catalina 10.15.7 (19H2).\n\n\nA: This is not related to fish nor macOS in general, the resulting symlink is just broken\n$ mkdir a b\n$ touch a/foo.txt\n$ ln -s a/foo.txt b/\n$ cd b\n$ cat foo.txt \ncat: foo.txt: No such file or directory\n$ ll foo.txt \nlrwxr-xr-x  1 pse  staff  9 Feb  1 13:14 foo.txt@ -> a/foo.txt\n\nBasically you need to think ahead when creating symlinks in a directory which is different from the current one. I find it easier to run\n$ cd b\n$ ln -s ../a/foo.txt .\n\nor just avoid relative symlinks in general.\n\nA: Note that this is about the filesystem and does not matter which shell you are using.\nThe issue is that the symbolic link just contains the text you passed to it and then the OS tries to resolve it from the actual path of the link. The link works as if you cd to where you store the link\nSo what happens is when you want to see b/file.txt the OS tries to open the file a/file.txt relative to directory b (ie $dir/b/a/file.txt) What you want the link to contain is ../a/file.txt\nTo create it from $dir\n ln -s ../a/file.txt b/\n\nOr from anywhere\n ln -s ../a/file.txt $dir/b/\n\n", "Q: MacBook air shuts down abruptly while using directly with a charger, is it because I am not using battery backup? bought a MacBook air in 2018. After a few months, the battery stopped working and I started using it directly with a charger without any battery backup. Sometime later the device started to shut down randomly even when plugged in and especially when using software like Photoshop.\nI am anyway planning to replace the battery but before that, I wanted to make sure is this shutdown issue related to battery or something else?\nDid anyone face the same issue before?\nThanks!\n\nA: It's quite likely to be because the battery is not providing power.\nThe charger's job isn't to power the computer, it's to charge the battery.\nThis is significant when the computer wants a lot of power for brief periods. The battery is capable of providing this short burst of full power; the charger is not, so the computer crashes.\n", "Q: Numbers - multiple conditions in an if statement I am trying to do this:\nIF(day(now()) > 28 and day(now()) < 1, A1 + B1, A2 + B2)\nHowever this gives a syntax error.

My question relates to the opposite migration, away from the Time Capsule.\nIs this possible? If so, how can I migrate this backup from the Airport Time Capsule (sparsebundle) to a USB disk formatted as exFAT?\n\nA: As the comments say you migrating time machine backup to exFAT is a relatively long thing to do. However, if you want to just access the files from a exFAT formatted drive you can simply copy those files to that drive. Though this is not a great solution.\nIf it's possible try other options.

(The set of little squares printed on the key next to F4 - each of those icons represent the special functions)\n\nIf you look at the first tab of that pref pane - Keyboard - You'll see that box is unchecked…\n\nOnce you do that, your 'real' F-Key will come into play, with whatever you set it for in the Shortcuts pane.\nAlternatively, you can temporarily swap special function/F-Keys by holding  Fn \n", "Q: \"Click restore to remove the Windows partition and restore the space back to MacOS\" I made a Windows partition on Bigsur install to make Windows quicker and easier to install later. However, when I run bootcamp the only option I'm given is to get rid of that partition and get it back to OSX. I don't trust that since last time I tried something like this I couldn't even boot and lost everything.\nIs there a safer way? For example, can't I burn Windows to a USB drive and then boot directly from that to reduce risk.... then install to the spare partition.\nThe only problem is that UUByte doesn't seem to work on Bigsur (greyed out drive selection) and Etcher can't get that Windows ISO into a bootable state.\nMeanwhile, Parallels would need messing with ktexts and I don't like the potential instability of that.\nWhat's the safest way to proceed? I have to run a Windows program to downgrade my phone via USB.\n\nA: The safest way usually is to use the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows 10. However, you can use a USB flash drive if you wish. Below outlines the procedure for creating the flash drive. You may have to tweak the procedure depending on your model Mac.\nThe macOS operating system includes all the applications necessary to create a Windows 10 USB flash drive installer. Below are the applications and their use.\n\n*\n\n*The Disk Utility application can be used to erase a 16 GB or larger USB flash drive. The name, format and scheme should be BOOTCAMP, ExFAT and Master Boot Record, respectively. See the image below.\n\n\n\n*The Boot Camp Assistant application can be used to download the Window Support Software. This download will include the Windows 10 drivers.\n\n\n*The Safari application can be used to download the latest 64 bit Windows 10 ISO file.\n\n\n*The DiskImageMounter application can be used to mount the Windows 10 iso file. This application can launched automatically by using the Finder application to open the ISO file.\n\n\n*The Finder application can be used to copy the contents of the mounted ISO file and the Windows Support Software to the flash drive.\nSince you have already created the partition for Windows, you can EFI boot from the flash drive and install Windows 10.\n", "Q: How can I refresh the macOS dictionary? Consider the following workflow:\n\n*\n\n*Open TextEdit.\n\n*Type a word that's not in the dictionary.\n\n*Right-click on that word and select 'Learn Spelling'.\n\n*Observe the squiggly underline disappears, as the word is now recognised.\n\n*Observe the word is added to the ~/Spelling/LocalDictionary file.\n\n*Quit TextEdit.\n\n*Remove the word from the ~/Spelling/LocalDictionary file.\n\n*Reopen TextEdit.\n\n*Type the same word again.\n\n*Observe it is still recognised (not squiggly-underlined), despite no longer being in the local dictionary.\n\nIt seems the problem here is that there is some sort of cache maintained by macOS that is not refreshed. If I right-click on the word in TextEdit to remove it from the local dictionary instead of editing the file, it is indeed no longer recognised; i.e., this appears to update the cache.\nIs there any way I can manually refresh the cache of local dictionary words?\n\nA: I figured this out myself in the end.

When I don't like a photo I took with my iPhone 11, I delete it (with the 'Photos' app), and empty the trash ('Recently Deleted' album).\nOnce in awhile I mount the phone under Linux and backup my photos by copying the DCIM subdirectory.  When I do this I notice that there are many duplicates (just an annoyance) and many photos that I assumed had been deleted.  However, the deleted photos don't show up in Photos nor in iCloud.\nWhat is going on here?\n\nA: One reason for finding some of the deleted photos could be because of the nature of iPhone's flash memory on which the data is saved - deletion or overwriting data is a slow process on such memory. So data in a flash memory are constantly moved to optimize it, and when you delete any file on it, it may not be deleted immediately but moved and marked for deletion later. (More here - Permamnently deleting on SSD).\nSo, while ios and Photos app may not show you the file on your iPhone or iPad  after you \"delete\" it on Photos, it may still be in the memory till it is actually deleted. That could be one reason why you are able to see them when you mount the iPhone drive on Linux. (I am speculating here because I don't know how you are mounting your iPhone on Linux and accessing its data).\nThe duplicates could be because of edits you made to the photos or photos you took in burst mode or HDR mode.\n\nA: Those deleted Photos are actually not deleted at all (well they are from a users point of view). They get moved to the 'recently deleted' Album within your iPhones Photo app. Which shows up in the DCIM folder when you plug it into your machine to backup.\nBefore backing up, just go to the recently deleted album and 'permanently delete' all items before backing up - simple :)\n", "Q: Can I boot from a USB stick containing MacOS if there is an issue with MacintoshHD?

Mac hardware is designed to boot from an external OS whether it’s an external drive, cheap commodity USB Flash thumb drive, network boot, internet recovery or direct attached disks. The startup manager governs which item is selected and you can connect the OS after you power on the Mac.\nIt even will search for a bootable drive if the last one stored in Non Volatile Ram (NVRAM) isn’t detected.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201255 (Intel only startup keys)\n\nIn your specific case, you would need to look at the startup logs for the OS to determine the issue or bring another OS to bear to rule out the first OS or drive you’re using. On slow USB media it can take dozens of minutes to boot, but on fast external media, it should be minutes tops.\nAlso, a failing drive can bring down the Mac and prevent booting from a known good OS so your option might be to remove the drive entirely (if feasible) to test that or have it repaired.\n", "Q: M1 Mac Kernel Panic on reboot: no checkins from watchdogd On my main Intel MBP I've had this same issue since Catalina.\nI just got a new M1 MBP, without all the Intel baggage, and still I have the issue.\nOn Big Sur 11.2 (just released as of Feb 1 2021), on my M1 Mac, I get a KP on reboot nearly every time...\nDoes anyone know what I can do to resolve this?

see the panic.\nI don't think it's a ruby issue, but something that running the non-system ruby causes issues...\nSo weird.\nI've rebooted say 25 times, and only on the 3 I ran gem, did I see the issue.\nUpdate2:\nI can consistently reproduce it using a number of ways, and it's weird.\nAll of these apps are installed via home-brew -\n\n*\n\n*Using ruby and then gem installed via home-brew, i.e. executing /opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin/ruby, then /opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin/gem, then rebooting - see KP.\n\n\n*Executing \"thef*ck\" (https://github.com/nvbn/thef*ck) - see KP.\n\n\n*Executing \"pip3 list\" installed via homebrew, i.e. \"/opt/homebrew/bin/pip3 list\" - see KP.\nUpdate3 SOLVED:\nMy replication steps only work when my terminal emulator (iTerm/Terminal) was in added in \"Developer Tools\" section of Security & Privacy settings in macOS.\nRemoved them and I could not longer replicate.\nThis looks to be a bug in codesign/watchdogd/adhoc signatures. Where you remove the terminal from dev tools, you can see the signature check is performed and all is well.\nIf you have terminal in the \"developer tools\" category, certain tools (like the ones I describe in my post, ruby/pip), cause the OS to panic on reboot, as something ends up hanging.\nDescribed further here: https://sigpipe.macromates.com/2020/macos-catalina-slow-by-design/\n\nA: *\n\n*Reboot into Safe Mode (Shift during boot) and see if the problem reoccurs. We are testing without third-party extensions and launch daemons and with a reduced set of Apple extensions in case one of the above is stalling reboot after watchdogd exits or if watchdogd itself is hung.\n\n\n*If you have any external devices, dongles, or cables attached, can you shut down, disconnect them, boot without, and see if the problem reoccurs? Similar reasoning as in #1.\n\n\n*Let’s see what the system log shows in the moments before this happens. Reproduce the issue, noting the date & exact system time (H:M:S) that you initiate a reboot. After you have to force a shutdown and reboot again, run the following in Terminal (substituting your actual date/time, in 24hr format, of the first reboot) and find a way to share the output with us:\n$ log show —-start=\"2021-02-01 23:45:12\" —-info —-debug\nUPDATE:\nLet’s try to make the panic log richer. Run the following in Terminal:\n$ sudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\"\n\nand then reboot. Next time you panic, please attach the full panic log (via PasteBin or otherwise).\n\nA: Have you tried a version manager such as chruby? Assume you migrated, so you're carrying some baggage. Can't be a common problem, but that doesn't help you. Many including me have run later Ruby version. I installed 3.0.0 and tried it. Main Rails app is still at 2.6 something, but I thought I'd use 3 for trials. MBP on Big Sur 11.2 (less important machine), iMac on Catalina. Good luck. Maybe it's a problem gem? Weird dependency.\n\nA: My replication steps only work when my terminal emulator (iTerm/Terminal) was in added in \"Developer Tools\" section of Security & Privacy settings in macOS.\nRemoved them and I could not longer replicate.\nThis looks to be a bug in codesign/watchdogd/adhoc signatures.

SIP is disabled. When trying to copy via terminal, getting \"Read-only file system\".\n\nA: This is correct behavior. You should not under any shipping OS be able to paste to that directory.\nMuch better to use a script or PATH or environment variables to extend your library in /usr/local/lib or other locations intended for customization. The OS manages the /usr/lib/ directory so your files will get stomped the next time an OS update happens or cause other breakage.\n", "Q: Sync directories without too much overhead I want to have a cloud-backup of my Documents directory; however, I'm not too fond of the idea of uploading the Documents in an unencrypted fashion. That's why I looked into the Cryptomator app. I do really like the idea of having a cloud-backup while still being sure that my documents are not analyzed by any storage provider.\nThe general approach would be to move the documents folder to the mountable Cryptomator drive and to save everything directly to this mounted drive. As I cannot be totally sure that Cryptomator will never end their service, and I also cannot be sure that there will never be any decryption issues, I don't like the idea of only having encrypted versions of my documents.\nHence, my optimal solution would be to keep my local Documents directory and sync it to the mounted Cryptomator drive, which will then upload the encrypted documents to my cloud storage. If a problem arises, I will still have access to the local copy; if not, great, I'll now be able to access my documents wherever I am, without fearing that any third-party can read my documents.\nHow should I go about the syncing of the directory? Can I do this with the functions present on macOS, or do I have to install additional software? Do you think that my plan is well thought out?\n\nA: cron + rsync\nUse rsync to sync the folders, and cron to schedule the backups. You can open up your cron table (list of scheduled commands) with crontab -e. First you can create your backup with:\nrsync -a ~/Documents <backup folder path>\n\nThis will create a backup named \"Documents\" in the directory you specify. Then you can schedule this command to run at certain times with cron. For example:\n0 12 * * * rsync -a ~/Documents <backup folder path>\n\nThis will backup your Documents folder to the backup folder path every day at noon. The format is:\n# ┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)\n# │ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)\n# │ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)\n# │ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)\n# │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday;\n# │ │ │ │ │                                   7 is also Sunday on some systems)\n# │ │ │ │ │\n# │ │ │ │ │\n# * * * * * <command to execute>\n\nAn asterisk means the task will run for every value of that time interval. So leaving all the asterisks would make it run every minute of every hour of every day of every month for every day of the week. In the example command I wrote earlier it would run at minute 0 of hour 12 (noon) of every day of every month for every day of the week.\nIt detects and updates only the edited, deleted, or added files so it will be very fast once you have already backed up the folder once.\n", "Q: How can I figure out what program is starting and quitting? I'm running 11.1 on an M1 MBP. A couple of times an hour, some app starts up, very briefly puts an icon in the Dock, and quits. It's kind enough to also steal focus when it starts up, so if I'm typing, suddenly my typing goes somewhere else.\nIs there a way I can track what apps start and quit, so I can figure out what is doing this and make it stop?\nI thought maybe I could use execsnoop for this, but it tells me the SIP is turned on and exits.\n\nA: Well the obvious solution is to temporarily disable SIP and run execsnoop as you’ve yourself identified.\nThere is a cruder and less reliable way which doesn’t require SIP disabled. The next time you see this happen, quickly go into Terminal and run\n$ log show —-last 1m —-info —-debug —-predicate='sender contains \"launchservicesd\"' \n\nThat will show you the last 1 minute of breadcrumbs from Launch Services, through which it is likely that your mystery process is being invoked. If it’s not, you won’t see it there. Look for (and/or grep) lines containing CHECKIN and DEATH.\n", "Q: Is there there an iOS equivalent of Android's \"Delete app storage\"? For many years Android has had a function which allows one to wipe a certain app's data by going to\nSettings -> Apps -> (select app) -> erase app storage.\nMost of the time, this will reset any data stored by the app, as if it was freshly downloaded.\nIs there an iOS equivalent of Android's \"Delete app storage\"?\n\nA: Not really - On iOS, deleting the app only deletes the data in its sandbox. If the developer doesn’t offer this toggle in the settings app (or you don’t trust the developer to actually wipe the data) you might have a problem if you expect all traces to be removed.\nThe problem is apps store data in a lot of places that aren’t the app sandbox. Look at keychain, cloud and application group stores for places where “data the developer really doesn’t want you to delete” can persist.\nIn the case where the app uses a group data entitlement, that data will persist and one app can participate in more than one group. A very notable version of this is Microsoft Office suite of iOS apps - they all share one group container so deleting an app doesn’t necessarily delete that data. Licensing and identity is stored in the group area, but individual data (Word / Excel / Outlook) is still stored within the app bundle so deleting Word, deletes the Word-specific data, but not some data relating to Office (licensing and identity and certificates for example).\nSo, no - sandboxing is different on iOS and there’s not an OS setting to wipe as a direct analog to how Android implements this. You’ll need to consider each app, whether it syncs to iCloud data store, to another data store or a group container to achieve your needs.\n", "Q: Why are AKAuthorizationRemoteView (Messages) and akd processes using high CPU? I noticed these two processes were causing my computer fan to spin right up, were using practically ALL the CPU % and they had over 40 days of CPU time clocked.\nA quick Google search revealed nothing. Seems that it may be related to Apple authorization... but why would it use so much CPU??\nI'm concerned because AKAuthorizationRemoteView implies it may be performing some remote view operation via Messages.\nAny help appreciated.\n\nA: akd is a background service created by Apple that runs on macOS as part of the AuthKit framework. It is used by other Apple programs to facilitate the process of validating Apple IDs.\nFor example when you login to iCloud from the App Store, System Preferences or similar, the akd background process is responsible for actually \"talking\" to Apple's servers. This approach makes it possible for Apple to centrally manage and update authentications on macOS, instead of having to bake that support into each and every app that needs it.\nNote that when you log in to iCloud from a browser, akd is not involved.\nUsually akd does not take up huge amounts of CPU time. The fact that it does on your computer, indicates that there was a bug in the program. For example it could be that there was some unexpected delay or break in the connection between the program and Apple's server, and that the program went into a never-ending loop waiting for something to happen.\nThat sort of problem is usually resolved by either \"killing\" (i.e. stopping) the program and letting it restart automatically, or by simply rebooting the computer.\nAKAuthorizationRemoteView is part Apple's AuthKitUI framework. Similar to the purpose of AuthKit, the AuthKitUI framework contains the functionality necessary to provide a user interface for authentication with Apple's services. It is created as a framework that is shared by other applications so that Apple does not have to update each and every program when they make a change to how the user interface for authenticating with their server's look like.\nThe user interface would include things like a dialog for entering your Apple ID and password, dialog for entering the 6-digit 2-factor authentication codes, a password reset dialog, etc.\nYou do not need to be concerned about the AKAuthorizationRemoteView. \"Remote View\" does not mean that something or someone is remotely viewing the screen of your computer. In technical terms a \"view\" is something that is displayed on your display - like for example a button, a menu, a text input field or similar. A \"remote view\" is a view that is displayed by a different thread or process than the main process.\nI.e. in this case it just means that you have a main program (Messages for example) that is using this external framework and letting it display an authentication dialog on its behalf. This dialog is then \"remote\" from the Messages program, although everything is contained and running on your own computer.\n", "Q: The iPhone could not be restored because the firmware file was corrupt I am trying to Factory Restore iPhone 6S \"A1633\" on my Mac Running Big Sur 11.1 / Intel.\nI am in recovery mode on the phone and plug it in it starts the update OR restore downloads the file, installs then produces this error.

When I power on the device it boots Windows 7, however, I'm unable to boot from a USB due to the Mac Mini not opening it's Startup Manager/BIOS/Boot Menu/Open Firmware... whatever it's called.\nI've tried Alt, F8-12 and even tried Shift for safe mode but every time it boots Windows 7.\nIf the organisation has blocked the boot menu from loading is there a way to unblock it (and possibly boot from a USB).\nEdit: I only own a Windows QWERTY keyboard... is that the issue?\nCheers.\n\nA: It’s possible that your Windows-specific keyboard isn’t sending the correct keycode for the Option (Alt) key. To rule out hardware damage, have you confirmed that the Alt key works when booted into Windows or plugged into a different computer?\nA workaround is to open the Mac Mini, disconnect the hard drive, and attach a USB flash drive containing a macOS installer (How to create a bootable installer for macOS). You’d still need a way to install onto the hard drive, which means buying an external USB enclosure for the internal drive...

It was already ancient, but has worked since about 2004 without change.\nIt does still work for certain in Mojave, possibly Catalina, but as far as I'm aware, not Big Sur.\nYou can get it from file sites like CNet, MacUpdate, Softpedia etc\nThere's a modern replacement for RCDefaultApp called SwiftDefaultApps but it doesn't do Extensions.\ntbh, your choice of extension was unfortunate. Macs reserve certain extensions to make into virtual packages; Logic is one of them. It doesn't rely on you having the app installed, it's right down at system level, as a known extension.  In effect it's the same as calling a folder company.project.app or company.project.zip & wondering why it misbehaves.\nAs a workaround you could right-click > Show Package Contents, but you'd have to do this every time.\n", "Q: How to fix freezing mplayer on Mac for music play? I want to play music on a MacBook Air (10.14.6) with mplayer on the command line. But sometimes when I load a page in a browser, the music briefly stops, and then continues.

Try switching to Safari and don’t run Chrome or Firefox at all for a while and see if the glitches persist or go away.\nUPDATE:\nSince you’ve confirmed that your browser is at fault, here are a few routes we can take.\n\n\n*Obvious first step: Make sure you’re on the most recent build of Firefox and mplayer in case there have been bug fixes or performance enhancements made. You can also try updating to a more recent macOS for similar reasons. (Big Sur is not recommended, though.)\n\n*We can try to do a deep dive and start doing DTrace profiling of Firefox and mplayer, possibly uncovering bugs in one or the other (or in other parts of the OS).\n\n*You could try switching to a different music player (e.g., try the default Music.app for a bit and see if it’s better-behaved) in case there’s a specific resource contention between browser and mplayer.\n\n*Depending on how much free RAM you have and how big your music library is, you could copy (a part of) your library to a RAM disk and stream from there.

That is ~/.cargo/bin if Homebrew has installed the standard cargo.\nI just had to go through this for Apple Silicon on Big Sur as there isn't a release build of rust yet. The cargo documents make this hard to find. Possibly becaus of another comment that cargo builds will not update when upstream changes are made as would happen with a package manager (e.g. HomeBrew) So I suspect cargo is not meant for your use just for those developing in rust.\n", "Q: Can I back up one external hard drive to a smaller external hard drive via Time Machine? So I've just had an external hard drive (5TB Seagate Backup Plus Portable) fail on me, the 3rd such time in 5 years. This is not unexpected behaviour in my experience: each of these hard drives has been read & written from basically 24/7, has failed at a point with less than 10% free space available, and I am always adding more data to them.\nI back up all of my data via Time Machine to a second external hard drive (8TB Seagate Backup Plus Desktop), which I've had for about 5 years now; it is still working, despite having run out of storage space on two prior occasions, necessitating some cleaning up of old backups. A checkup with Disk Utility reveals no problems.\nI am looking at replacing the failed hard drive with a larger one, which will necessitate buying a desktop drive, since no manufacturer currently makes a 6TB+ USB powered hard drive (except LaCie, but that drive is USB-C powered, and I only have regular USB 3.0 ports). My plan is to purchase a 10TB desktop drive, as 8TB desktop drives are not available in stores where I live at the moment.\nThe question is:\n\n*\n\n*Can a 10TB drive be backed up via Time Machine to an 8TB drive if it is only partially full (in this case, roughly 4.5TB of data)?\n\n*If so, how long can I expect the 8TB drive to last if it continues to be used almost entirely for backups? (In the best case scenario, I would need to be able to continue using it for 2 to 3 years until data needs force me to get a larger one.)\n\n\nA: Question 1:\nThe short answer is 'yes' so long as there is room for the data.  But:\nTime Machine will backup your system disk plus your 10 GB disk to another disk which has is large enough for the data you have plus space for future changes.\nYou might consider benefits of using Time Machine for just your system disk, but to use something else for backup of your external 10TB drive.  Examples I would recommend are Carbon Copy Cloner and Chronosync. Using Chronosync in a one way sync is appropriate if you occasionally (or frequently!) reorganise your data - this is not Time Machine friendly.\nQuestion 2:\nOnly you can answer that as it depends on how much data you expect to add.\nA longer answer is that you would seem to be a good candidate for using a NAS.\nCaveat: I have attempted this answer with the assumption that your only disks are internal system disk and the two externals.\nAside: For always on continuous use I prefer a mains powered disk (desktop) over a bus powered (portable) hard disk drive.\n", "Q: Accessing fine-grained volume control using external keyboard volume wheel In macOS, the Volume keys change the volume in full steps, but it is possible make fine-grained changes using Option-Shift-Volume{Up,Down}.\nI have an external keyboard connected which provides a volume wheel. Moving this wheel modifies the volume very quickly, in full steps. Pressing Option-Shift while moving the wheel is the perfect precision for me.\nIs it possible to configure macOS (or the external keyboard) so the internal keyboard behavior isn't affected but the VolumeUp/VolumeDown keys from the external keyboard act in small steps, without pressing Option-Shift?\nOtherwise, is it possible to modify the entire behavior so volume control always acts in small steps? (regardless of whether it's the internal or external keyboard)\n\nA: You should be able to use Karabiner-Elements to do this. It allows you to customize keyboard actions on a per-device basis. You could set it up to replace Volume Up / Volume Down with Option + Volume Up / Option + Volume Down.\n", "Q: Invalid certificate for a specific website When trying to navigate to a specific website (amazon.com in my case) I always get the \"NET::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID\" error in Chrome (and equivalent errors in Safari/other browsers). When clicking to see the cert I can see that it's trying to associate it with the wrong website (register.be.xfinity.com instead of amazon.com) - see screenshot:\n\nThe background story is that my internet access modem was temporarily disabled and always routed all access to that xfinity \"activation\" website and I guess at some point I clicked approve to update the cert from that fake website. I tried removing the cert from keychain and adding it back (importing exported one and marking it as trusted) but it didn't help.\nHow can I fix the issue? Help!\nThanks!\n\nA: Try changing your DNS.\nGo to System Prefferences -> Network -> Advanced -> DNS\nThen write down every DNS entry in case something goes wrong, and remove every DNS entry from the list.\nAdd at least two DNS servers. My favorite are Cisco (1.1.1.1) and IBM (9.9.9.9).\nClick Ok, then Apply.\nTry visiting the website.\n\nA: This problem is not caused by you approving to \"update\" the certificate for that web site. You cannot \"update\" the certificate, nor can you \"reset the cert for a specific domain\" as you wrote in the comments. That's not really how it works.\nWhat you have done is approve a specific certificate even though it doesn't validate according to normal rules. When you do that, you mark is a specifically trusted - but doing that does only just that, nothing else. It won't magically \"use\" that certificate for that site every time or anything like that at all. You will only get this prompt if the system you're communicating with presents that certificate.\nAs Amazon.com isn't presenting certificates from Xfinity, you're not actually communicating with Amazon, but with something or someone else.\nThis can be caused by a DNS issue, where a DNS server gives you false IP-addresses for amazon.com. This can be solved by using a different set of DNS-servers, unless you have something on your network or in your provider's network that is purposefully altering DNS answers. In that case you can consider switching to DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or DNS over TLS (DoT). You can enable DoH with a compatible set of servers in Chrome from the Settings page.\nThe problem could also be caused by your provider otherwise altering packets sent to you - by intercepting the raw network traffic and sending you bogus data. Try connecting through a mobile hot-spot or on someone else's WiFi to check if the site works there to be certain that it is a problem with your own internet connection.\n", "Q: Shortcuts App Sleep Timer Has anyone figured out a way using the Shortcuts app to set a sleep timer?

I have an 8GB RAM MacBook Pro that struggles under my workload and I regularly have yellow memory pressure. I do notice that during these times, the disk caching (i.e. 'Cached Files') is taking up ~1GB of RAM. Though I am well aware that files in RAM is much faster than if it has to pull it off the disk, the machine DOES have a pretty fast SSD and I'd be willing to have less disk cache in favor of more application RAM.\nIs there a way to set the amount of memory (or behavior rules) around how the OS utilizes disk caching? I'm a bit surprised that when memory pressure gets bad, it still insists on using a good chunk of my RAM to cache instead of at least cutting that in half.\n\nA: Yellow memory pressure is not in itself an indication of any sort of \"problem\" with your system.\nIf that is the only \"negative\" indication in Activity Monitor, then getting rid of cached files from memory won't help performance of your system. Rather the opposite.\nTake a look at \"Swap used\" in Activity Monitor - if this is \"0 bytes\", then the system has the RAM it needs, and getting rid of cached files won't mean that the now freed memory can be used for something that would somehow speed up your system.\nHowever, if your \"Swap used\" is a significant amount, it might be that getting rid of cached files could speed up your system. It doesn't mean that in every case though. What matters is whether the swapped out data is something the system actually needs now. If that is the case, you can check the amount of data swapped in/out per second (or minute or similar) to see if the system is actively swapping in/out data while you are experiencing problems with your workload.\nIf you do indeed convince yourself that changing the disk caching behavior is necessary, you can use the sysctl command in the Terminal to do so.\nYou can list all the possible settings using sysctl -a - especially the ones that have \"vm\" in the name are be interesting here. I would take a look at the following settings:\n  kern.vm_page_free_min\n  kern.vm_page_free_target\n  kern.vm_page_free_reserved\n  kern.vm_page_speculative_percentage\n  vm.vm_page_background_mode\n  vm.vm_page_background_target\n\nYou can see their current setting like this:\nsysctl kern.vm_page_free_min\n\nAnd set a new value with:\nsysctl kern.vm_page_free_min=250000\n\nNote that the above is just a fictive example - you would need to supply your own value.\n", "Q: Dismissing Big Sur permission dialogs via keyboard I know that since Mojave, MacOS has started presenting more dialogs when apps would like to do specific things. However, in Mojave, I was able to control the dialog that appears using the keyboard (tab & space etc.).\n\nHowever in Big Sur, I no longer seem to be able to control this type of dialog by keyboard. This is more annoying than serious, however it would be good to not have to reach for the trackpad or mouse to allow/reject the permission request. I have no idea if this would have been the case in Catalina as I skipped that release totally, going straight to Big Sur from Mojave.\nI have the \"Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls\" option selected in the keyboard preferences, and most other dialogs appear to respect that and can be controlled. It seems just this type of permission request dialog cannot.\nIs there another preference setting I am missing? In the screenshot above it was iTerm2 I was using to start a vagrant instance and I had to provide an admin password in order for vagrant to update my exports file. However, other apps, such as PHPStorm will also present a similar dialog (for a similar reason).\nI'm quite willing to accept the fact that this type of dialog cannot be keyboard controlled, but wouldn't have thought that was the case. This isn't about the reasons for the dialog or how to prevent the dialog in the first place - just being able to control via keyboard.\n\nA: I had no intention of answering my own question, but when I was prompted again this morning on starting another vagrant instance, I just decided to have another go at pumping key combinations in the hope of hitting one I haven't yet tried.\nFound it!\nUsually in dialogs the Tab key is used to navigate between elements. Obviously tried that, tried the various arrow keys, with and without modifiers. Then I hit on the combination that, for whatever reason, I hadn't tried before.\nTo move between the two options, as there are only two in this specific type of dialog, the combination is ...\nShift+Tab\nI probably hadn't tried that as usually Shift is only used to reverse direction. When there are only two elements, just hitting Tab should be enough to toggle.\nAnyway, I assume the extra modifier is required as this is a security permission dialog so you are forced to do just that little bit more work.\nIn the scheme of things, this only saves maybe seconds per day, but I was just finding it really annoying.

If so, how?\n\nA: You just need to remove the unwanted command by replacing it with 'garbage' - something you don't already use or need...\n\n*\n\n*System Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts\n\n*Click + then add the name of your desired app.\n\n*Type the exact name of the menu item you wish to replace[1]\n\n*Add a garbage command [anything will do, so long as it's not going to conflict anywhere else]\n\n\n[1] This is especially important if the menu ends in an ellipsis … which typographically is not the same as three full stops ...\nThere is no need to specify any menu/sub-menu structure, no matter how far down the hierarchy your menu item may be - it will always find it using just the actual item name.\nIf you have two menu items with the same name but in different sub-menus, you can differentiate by giving the actual menu path using -> as the sub-menu indicator, eg\nFile->Open->Open Special Name\n\nA: The trick to un-assigning shortcuts in any app on the Mac is to assign the shortcut you want to use you first have to assign that shortcut keystroke to something else.\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts\n\n*Click the + and select Safari.app from the Application menu\n\n*Now type in the menu title EXACTLY as it appears in the menu. noting that the three dots after the \"Add Bookmark\" is an elipsis and not three periods, so type Opt ;  to get that symbol.\n\n*Now give the shortcut a new key sequence, like ShiftOptD and click Add.\n\n*Once that is done I would go back to Safari and verify that this shortcut works. It will show up in the Bookmarks menu correctly if you did it right.\n\n*Now you can either assign your desired shortcut to CommandD. Or, in your case, leave it unassigned so it is passed to the browser window.\n\nThis will work with any app that you want to not use a particular keyboard shortcut and change it to your preferred shortcut. There are programs that can do this for you, but for simple, occasional, changes like this the macOS built-in method works fine.\n", "Q: Triggering an automation / shortcut on iPhone after a call is over I would like to run an automation or a shortcut every time I finish an incoming call or an outgoing call. What is the trigger I should use? Does such kind of a trigger even exist?\n\nA: I found this in the Apple support documentation which defines communication triggers for messages and emails right now. There are no communication triggers for calls. So I believe we have no option but to wait and check if Apple plans to add triggers for calls.\n", "Q: How to remap Mac keyboard with Xmodmap I was trying to remap my Mac's keyboard with Xmodmap, but it was only somewhat successful.

Otherwise a username password prompt is displayed. I didn't see much difference between the Catalina and the Big Sur versions of the page unfortunately.\nIf you want a work around, I hacked together some Apple Script that will open up the screen sharing app, fill in hostname, username/password, then re-enter the password on the remote machine and press enter:\ntell application \"Screen Sharing\"\n    activate # start Screen Sharing if not running yet\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        key code 51 using {command down} # Delete whatever is in the textbox\n        keystroke \"192.168.1.1\" # host you want to connect to\n        key code 36 # press enter\n        delay 1 # wait a moment for the next screen to appear\n        keystroke \"username\" # username\n        keystroke tab\n        keystroke \"hunter2\" # password\n        key code 36 # press enter\n        delay 2 # wait to connect to the target machine\n        key code 51 using {command down} # delete anything in the textbox\n        keystroke \"hunter2\" # typing the password on the remote machines textbox\n        key code 36 # hitting enter to log in\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nTo use throw the above code into a file called file.scpt and run it via osascript file.scpt.

Now, I guess if I had created a .bash_alias file they would have gone there, but since I never did, they must be stored somewhere else on my computer but I can't find them.\nCan someone give me some ideas of where to look?\n\nA: bash aliases you create by running the alias command are not stored anywhere, they are gone as soon as you exit the shell.\nTo make persistant aliases which will be available in all newly executed bash shells add the definition to ~/.bashrc. You can then also run source ~/.bashrc after adding new definitions to have them included in a running shell.\n", "Q: Take webcam picture and screenshot at the same time I'm trying to combine these two commands:\nwhile :;do screencapture -x ~/Desktop/$(date +%y%m%d%H%M%S).png;sleep 300;done \n\nand\nimagesnap -t 300\n\nI want to make a screenshot and a webcam photo at the same time every 5 minutes. It's my first time using the terminal, so I'm very new to this. It's probably very simple but I just can't figure it out.\nThank you for helping!\n\nA: Something to try, add an ampersand to the end of your commands.\nimagesnap -t 300&\n\nThe idea here is that the ampersand will cause the command to run in the background allowing the loop to continue to the next step.\nAs an example, if you were to run the following in Terminal you'll see that the second sleep reports out before the first one.\nsleep 10&; sleep 5&;\n\nI hope this helps\n\nA: Using a while loop together with imagesnap -t 300 will end up with screenshot and webcam getting out of sync rather quickly. Might be better to use\nwhile sleep 300; do\n    timestamp=\"$(date +%y%m%d%H%M%S)\"\n    screencapture -x ~/Desktop/\"screen-${timestamp}.png\" &\n    imagesnap -q ~/Desktop/\"cam-${timestamp}.png\" &\ndone\n\nPutting the sleep into the condition allows to easily terminate the loop with Ctrl-C, running the capture commands in the background is the best we can do on shell level to have them execute at the same time.\n", "Q: How do I downgrade my Photos library? I just downgraded my MacBook Pro from macOS 11 Big Sur to macOS 10.15 Catalina. While on macOS 11 I opened the Photos app which altered my photo library. Now on 10.15, the Photos app cannot open my library because it was changed by a newer version and tells me to update the app.\n\nHow do I get my photos back? Installing macOS Big Sur isn't an option, though I can install it on an external drive if needed.\n\nA: You cannot downgrade a photo library, since downgrading overall is unsupported. Your files are not lost, however, since the Photos library is a bundle that still contains your originals. You have the following options:\n\n*\n\n*If you use iCloud Photo Library, create a new Library and configure it with iCloud. It will pull down your photos.\n\n\n*If you have access to a machine with Big Sur you have two routes:\n\n*\n\n*Configure that machine with your iCloud and set up iCloud Photo Library. The photos can be uploaded, then your Catalina machine can download them.\n\n*If you don't want to set up iCloud Photo Library, use that machine instead to export the files. Reimport them to a new library on this machine. Verify the process with a small batch to ensure quality.\n\n\n\n*If you cannot do either of these and must be on Catalina, you must open up the photo library and extract the originals manually. If you locate the library in Finder (Usually located in the Pictures folder) and right click it, click Show Package Contents. There is an originals folder that contains all your unmodified images. You should be able to import this folder.\nThese options are listed in order of best to worst. Only use approach 3 if none of the other approaches are viable. Even if you don't have a second laptop, considering installing Big Sur on a second volume (here are instructions for the beta, but they apply for the regular release as well) and using that to upload to iCloud Photo Library or Export.\n", "Q: How to show split view spotlight results without clicking I just upgraded to Big Sur.\nSomething I don't like is that Spotlight doesn't show BIG RESULTS for dictionary definitions and calculator, unless you click on them.\nIt used to be that the answer to the calculation was automatically displayed largely in a panel on the right half of the results.\nSimilarly for the dictionary, in fact Spotlight now doesn't show me the word's pronunciation, etymology, alternative definitions, etc, unless I click on the result physically with my mouse (maybe there is also a hidden keyboard shortcut for it)\nHow can I make it present the results as it used to in Catalina, without me having to do any additional action other than search?\n\nA: Spotlight has changed quite disruptively for many workflows and I am not sure that in right direction. There is a choice: adapt or resist the change. Following is from adaption perspective:\nHow to display calculation results largely in a panel on the right half of the results > press ⇥ (TAB) at the end of calculation.\nFor dictionary > use ⌘ ↓ to navigate to Definition block and press enter (or alternatively enter term, then ⇥ (TAB) which displays preview and then navigate to Definition block; during navigation preview stays open)\nIf you are looking for \"word's pronunciation, etymology, alternative definitions, etc\" then one option it to search directly within Dictionary app (or use dict:// at the beginning in Spotlight and then press Enter which takes to Dictionary term)\n", "Q: Is there a way to add a login item in the terminal without triggering a permission dialog on macOS 10.14 and above? For context: I am working on a script whose purpose is to install a specific application and also add it to the user's login items. This program may need to be deployed to a large number of systems so it is desirable that it be installed without any user input on the target machine.\nCurrently this is being done via a command along the lines of osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to make login item ...' which works fine in versions of macOS prior to 10.14. However, in more recent versions executing this command triggers a dialog requesting Automation (AppleEvents) permissions, which prevents the install from running unattended.\nIs there either an alternate way to add a login item that does not require additional permissions, or else a way to grant the required permission without user input?\n\nA: I don't have a lot of experience administering/doing mass deployment of scripts over Jamf but I am positive the following links would be very helpful for you. I believe what you are looking for is how to work around Apple's Preferences Policy Control Payloads (PPPC).\nPlease take a look at the following resources:\nGitHub - homebysix\nApple Official Doc about PPPC\nGitHub - Jamf\nBasically, you want to figure out what you want to explicitly whitelist and preauthorize these using the MDM profile utility and deploy the profile you created along with the payload.\n\nA: The solution you’re looking for will be based around SMLoginItemSetEnabled(). This is the modern replacement for the deprecated LSSharedFileListInsertItemURL() which is used by the Users & Groups system preference pane.\nYou will need to create two small applications. The “main” application will be responsible for launching your payload. The “helper” application will be launched at login by macOS and will need to launch the “main” application. (If your payload was something you had source access to, you wouldn’t need a separate “main” application and could just add the helper directly to your app.)\nThere are a number of tutorials that describe this in detail. Here is one. You can also use a Swift package that contains much of the boilerplate code for you.\nSo here is how this would work:\n\n*\n\n*Your automated setup script runs the main app (which also contains the helper app within its bundle) one time to set up launch at login.\n\n*Going forward, when the user logs in, macOS launches the helper.\n\n*The helper launches the main app.\n\n*The main app uses NSWorkspace to launch your payload.\n\n", "Q: Time Machine drive takes long time (~5 minutes) to mount on boot My time machine backup drive (a Samsung T5, 1TB) is giving me trouble: I noticed that it takes a long time for the drive to show up on my desktop (5 minutes or so) after start or restart. The drive indicator light flashes a lot, showing some kind of activity, but I don’t know what. I checked that it is not doing a fsck. Even stranger is the fact that the drive shows up right away when I plug it in after the boot has completed and I see a normal desktop. Other USB sticks mount and unmount just fine. The troublesome drive shows up right away on a different, much older Mac. The lsof command returns nothing when I try\nsudo lsof +D /Volumes/Samsung_T5\nThe Samsung SSD app, called SamsungPortableSSD.app, shows the drive as disconnected during the slow mount from boot.\nDisk Utility shows no errors (sudo time diskutil verifyVolume disk2s2). The drive already has about 750GB of backups on it.\nIs there some logging facility I can turn on or browse to see what’s going on during the 5 minutes the drive is flashing without mounting? Is it worth it to try USB logging? What are the risks?\nIn the meantime, I can browse through the backup files on the Time Machine external drive through the Finder just fine. I would like to be able to preserve all these backups and fix the problem. Is this possible? Or do I really have to erase it all, format, and start over? Or is there an intermediate path where I can preserve maybe five total checkpoints over two years' worth and the rest gets erased? In the end I’d like to get back to normal behavior where the drive shows up right away on start and goes away quickly on shutdown.\nMachine: I’m running Big Sur 11.2 on a 12-inch, Early 2015 Retina MacBook.\nHistory:\nInitially the drive worked fine for two years even though I didn’t install the driver. The trouble started about two months ago or so during Catalina and got worse with the Big Sur versions. The problem first became visible when the drive didn’t show up right away after boot. Later on, the actual shutdown would take a long time, again maybe five minutes or so. It really got my attention when I got a black screen of death after a long shutdown with an accompanying kernel panic report. Things are much better since I’ve installed the driver: now the drive will always eventually mount after boot (as opposed to almost never) and there are so far no more black screens of death. I can accept slow mount and unmount times, but I'm really concerned about the kernel panics. What risk is there now of kernel panics with an updated driver?\n\nA: On macOS you don’t need to install any drivers for external drives that comply with the USB Mass Storage class, which the Samsung does (unless you’re doing something funny like using their proprietary encryption scheme). Any external USB SSD will ‘just work’ when you plug it in. I would uninstall the driver as it can do more harm than good, particularly with the major rewrites to the driver architecture in Catalina and Big Sur which not all third-party developers have caught up with yet.\nYou’re definitely right to worry about the slow mounts on boot, though. That can be due to a variety of things. One of these is a heavily worn SSD, which could be the case if you’re using it for Time Machine, but two years isn’t a very long time. It may still be valuable for you to run the Smartmontools package (which will also require you to install USB SMART support) in order to determine the wear & lifespan on your SSD. Heavily worn SSDs will have increased latencies which get worse over time. If you’re only seeing this issue on first mount and you’re not seeing a reduction in read or write speed, though, then that’s unlikely to be the issue.\nIt sounds like you’re more concerned with your kernel panics. Without seeing the panic reports, we can’t determine if they’re something you should worry about or if they’re even related to your SSD. Can you please provide your panic logs? They’ll be found in /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports and have the file extension .panic. Put those up on PasteBin and we can review them.\nTo your question of preserving your backups: I don’t know of a straightforward way to cherry-pick specific checkpoints (although there may exist tools out there that I just haven’t looked for, so feel free to DuckDuckGo it). Time Machine is persnickety about the contents of its backup bundle and any omissions could result in an unreadable backup. I would instead try cloning your entire SSD to another drive wholesale and pointing TM to that. (But I have never done this and it’s entirely possible that TM will detect the different device UUID and force you to recreate the backup anyway.) You have to be ready to accept that you might need to start from scratch.\n", "Q: I MUST know the amount of RAM in the iPad before buying. What are my options? In the official iPad page, no information is currently provided about the amount of RAM available for any of the iPad devices.\nI called Apple just now and the engineer with whom I spoke said that he was not allowed to give me official numbers.\nHe suggested that mac tracker, a 3rd party web-site, suggested the following\niPad Pro: 6 GB\niPad Air: 4 GB\nI do not trust 3rd srty information.\nI must buy.\nI must have this information before I buy.\nApple refuses to give it to me. (God knows why. This is ridiculous.)\nToo little RAM is the reason why my current iPad sucks. Apps are constantly forced to reset because of this. And the alternatives suck because Apple uses its monopoly power to kill viable competitors. This is intolerable.\nWhat are my options?\n\nA: There is an app on the App Store named MacTracker. This app lists info about Macs, iPad and other mac devices. This may also exist as a web site as you mentioned before. The information in Mac Tracker is as accurate as any other site other than Apple itself.\nYou can also lookup the specs of iPad models on https://everymac.com/systems/apple/ipad/index-ipad-specs.html.\n", "Q: Can I distribute Xcode at my company internally through configuration management scripts? My company is slower to upgrade our developers' workstations and as such we often lag behind in Mac OS and Xcode versions. As such, developers often have trouble installing and configuring the correct versions for internal development.\nI'm wondering if I can legally store specific versions of Xcode in an internal drive and have my configuration scripts vend it to developers so that they always receive the company-approved versions? I've tried diving into forums and Google but maybe I'm not searching the right thing.\n\nA: Everywhere I have ever worked in 30 years of IT work it is perfectly fine to place an installer on a local/network drive for in-house installation as long as there are no licensing issues.\nAnd since XCode is free to use for anyone with a compatible Mac, I would think yes, this is fine.\nAlso macOS Server has (I seem to recall) a caching option which stores software updates on your internal network for the very same thing.\n", "Q: How do I disable message sending using the return key on Ipad or Iphone?

I'm making a command, but there is no way to get the command files (known as .command files) to ask for words.\nlike confirmations such as:\nContinue to make directory? y/n\n\nAnd commands use to confirm and ask.\n\nA: .command scripts run in Terminal windows (that is, when you double-click a .command file, it opens a Terminal window, and you can use that window to interact with the script). You can use that to prompt the user and get input; exactly how you do that depends on the scripting language you're using (which is determined by the shebang (starts with #!) line at the beginning of the script. In bash, you'd do something like:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nread -p \"Continue to make directory? y/n \" makedir\nif [[ \"$makedir\" = [Yy] ]]; then\n    mkdir somedirectory\nfi\n\nIn zsh, the syntax for adding a prompt to the read command is different, and it has a -q option specifically for y/n questions (that succeeds if the answer is \"y\" or \"Y\", and can be used directly in an if):\n#!/bin/zsh\n\nif read -q \"makedir?Continue to make directory? y/n \"; then\n    mkdir somedirectory\nfi\n\nIn other languages, you'd do... whatever you do in that language to prompt for and accept input.\n", "Q: Recover deleted folder from user/library I have accidentally deleted a folder /Users/me/Library/Application Support/Postgres/ through the use of a third party uninstall app (CleanMyMac).

The 4GB cards were already working in another early 2011 MacBook.\nThe point being that, if I install the memory in a mid-2009 in a 2GB+4GB configuration, the Mac runs well. I have tried to switch cards and slots and it works, too.\nDoes anyone know what's happening?\n\nA: 3 beeps + 5s pause means your memory failed training. There are a LOT of reasons this happens. Let’s consider the most common.\nFirst, let’s make sure your system supports 8 GB. According to Apple, the mid-2009 MacBook Pro does support up to 8 GB:\n\n4GB (two 2GB SO-DIMMs) of 1066MHz DDR3 memory; two SO-DIMM slots support up to 8GB\n\nNow let’s consider a couple of possibilities:\n\n*\n\n*It may be that one of your 4 GB SO-DIMMs is of marginal quality and is failing during one of the training steps. Let’s rule that out. When you ran your experiment, did you try both of the DIMMs alongside the 2 GB DIMM? And then did you try each of those DIMMs in the other slot alongside the 2 GB? In other words, you should have performed this experiment with FOUR different memory configurations.\n\n*Although I can’t think of a good reason why it would only happen for the 4+4 case, your firmware may not be recognizing a new DIMM has been installed and is trying to use a stale memory training table with the new card. You can force full memory retraining by resetting your PRAM (OptionCommandPR during boot).\n\n\nA: I am not the world's leading RAM expert, but Crucial are not bad at this ;)\nChecking their RAM recommendations for the 2009 Macbook Pro vs the 2011 gives this…\n2009\n\n2011\n\nI would guess that they are sufficiently different spec as to not be cross-compatible.\nMy only guess for why one old/one new works is that the new is ignored & the old is sufficient to boot from.\nIf you check About this Mac from the  menu & click the Memory tab, you should be able to see some variation of this, which will tell you which modules are recognised (this pic from a vastly different Mac, of course, I don't have a Macbook to grab a screenshot from).

Based on the error message you posted, this appears to be not true. If the free space resides above the Apple_CoreStorage partition, then this space can not be added to the Apple_CoreStorage partition.\nYou can determine where the free space exists by entering the command given below.\nsudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0\n\nThis command can be entered while booted to El Capitan, because SIP under this version of OS X allows reading from /dev/disk0, but not writing.\nFrom the table published in the Wikipedia article GUID Partition Table, one can determine a type of partition based on the GUID. From the command sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0 output, one can determine the partitions with indices 1, 2, and 3 are types EFI System partition, Apple Core Storage Container, and Apple Boot partition, respectively. The 30,617,650 sectors of free space can be converted to bytes by multiplying by 4096 bytes per sector, which is 125.4 GB. Since this free space is above the  Apple_CoreStorage partition, the space can not be merged into the Apple_CoreStorage partition.\nUnless your are an expert, the safest solution is to backup your data to an external drive, erase the internal drive, reinstall OS X and restore your data from backup.

My workflow requires me to frequently switch back and forth between Google Docs and other apps and this leads to my Google doc being repeatedly closed.\nMy understanding is that the cause is “app suspension”. There’s not enough memory for both apps, so, instead of using virtual memory, the brilliant engineers at Apple decided to just reclaim memory from the app not currently being used (as described in iOS always \"resets\" my apps after a while when they are minimized. How can I change that?)\nMy feelings / assessment include:\n\n*\n\n*Multitasking was SOLVED by OSes in the 1980s.\n\n*This is intolerably frustrating.\n\n*I can't change the way the OS is written.\n\n*I can't change the way the app is written.\n\n*To my knowledge, all I can do is buy new hardware.\n\n*This iPad Air 2 has a measly 2GB of RAM.\n\nMy intuition is that an iPad with more RAM will experience app suspension less frequently, so I am considering purchasing a new model.  However, depending on the memory management scheme of the OS, I may or may not get the fewer app suspensions I desire.\nI require more technical knowledge to help me make a good decision. How can I tell if paying for a newer iPad will address my needs?\n\nA: Blame the apps, not the hardware is my overall message. The icons for some apps are larger in code size than the first version of Adobe Illustrator and the Google model of web apps and complicated iOS apps can bring down the newer iPad Pro. Look at their hesitance to update apps if you wonder how many components have to be reviewed for a quick update to list privacy concerns that most developers fixed in days.\nI would put a few documents in Files storage and use the Apple apps to see how responsive the hardware is when the application saves state as the OS intends for the gloriously smooth multitasking experience you are right to expect on hardware faster in every respect than needed to juggle a dozen spreadsheets, documents and presentations. Try running apps in airplane mode so you get a sense of the actual hardware speed without network sync or delays (perhaps Google is sending telemetry or downloading parts of the app while you work rather than optimizing for your experience?).\nIn 2020, Apple is reminding developers they need to be detecting delays as short as 20ms in frame by frame animations - even one frame that’s late spoils our sense of delight.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/tech-talks/10855/\nYou are right to be absolutely brutal on developers that can’t handle an app suspend / resume cycle on an OS designed for power efficiency. The RAM constraint is there since it’s not needed if the app is designed and tested properly. Throwing more RAM at an app that doesn’t take advantage of hardware as capable as the iPad 2 isn’t effective. Worse, all RAM draws power so putting too much RAM in lowers battery life, for no gain in performance.\nEven if you aren’t a developer, you can read Apple’s high level overview of what is needed to design a good app. Step one is design it to look great, step two is prepare for interruptions. Google missed or ignored step 2.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/system-capabilities/multitasking/\n\nBe prepared for interruptions, and be ready to resume. Your app can be interrupted at any time. When an interruption occurs, your app should save the current state quickly and precisely so people can seamlessly continue where they left off when they return.\n\nYou can look at memory allocations in Xcode if you don’t agree with this overview, but to make an incredibly responsive app requires very little RAM on iPadOS. Well written apps will perform magnificently on older hardware - even 5+ year old devices have a lot of life in the for the correct app lineup.\n\nA: It's more complicated than just \"more RAM = less app suspension\". For instance, flagship Android phones today can have 3-4 times the RAM that iPhones have, but because of software optimization, iPhones can still hold many apps open in the background. If you get a new iPad (especially if yours is several years old), the problem will likely go away, but no one can answer your specific workflow question. I have an iPad Pro 2018, and I can keep a Google Doc open after using several other apps.\n", "Q: How to update external iSight firmware? Apple released several firmware revisions for the external iSight camera:\n\n*\n\n*iSight 1.0.3 Update\n\n*\n\n*Improved audio performance\n\n\n\n*iSight 1.0.2 Update\n\n*\n\n*Improved auto exposure\n\n*Improved auto white balance\n\n*Enhanced IIDC compliance\n\n*Better overall performance\n\n\n\nHow can I update my iSight to the latest firmware revision?\n\nA: Apple released an iSight Updater software package, which is still available online:\n\niSight Updater 1.0.3\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/DL502\n\nThe problem is that the software download requires Mac OS X v10.3 Panther to run.\niSight can also be updated on OS X 10.4 Tiger and 10.5 Leopard. The updater on those systems is located at:\n\\System\\Library\\CoreServices\\iSight Updaters\\iSight Updater\nSo, find an OS X 10.3, 10.4, or 10.5 machine (or VM?) to run the iSight Updater software.\n", "Q: Change the default background colour for text fields added to PDFs in Preview? In Preview you can add text fields to PDFs using the text tool on the toolbar. Every time I add such a text field the background colour is reverted to transparent. All other text properties (i.e., size, font, foreground colour etc) are remembered from the last text field when creating a new text field.\nIs there any way to make Preview also remember the background colour setting when adding text fields to PDFs?\n\nA: \nIs there any way to make Preview also remember the background colour setting when adding text fields to PDFs?\n\nThere is no Preferences… setting in Preview to remember the last used color shown in its Color Well for the Fill Color when using the Tools > Annotate > Text menu item, or its ^⌘T keyboard shortcut , or clicking Text on its Markup Toolbar.\nIf there is an unpublished setting to change the default behavior, i.e. the Fill Color is automatically reset to none upon the aforementioned actions, I am unaware of it.\n\n\nWorkaround Solution 1\nAs Preview does remember the last used color shown in its Color Well for the Fill Color on its Markup Toolbar, until using the Tools > Annotate > Text menu item, or its ^⌘T keyboard shortcut, or clicking Text on its Markup Toolbar, this allows for the use of a Service/Quick Action in Automator, using a Run AppleScript action with UI Scripting code, to then be assigned a keyboard shortcut that when pressed will automate the process of setting the last used fill color to a new text field.\n\n*\n\n*1 The colors used in this workaround are from the standard pallet as shown when clicking on Fill Color on the Markup Toolbar, and shown in the image below.\n\nThe example AppleScript code, shown below, was tested under macOS High Sierra thru macOS Big Sur, with Language & Region set to English (US) in System Preferences, and worked for me without issue, sans adding Preview in: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility\nUsing Automator I created a Service/Quick Action setting Workflow receives [no input] in [Preview], with a Run AppleScript action, replacing the default code with the example AppleScript code, shown below.\nSaved the Automator workflow as Preview - Add Text with last Fill Color, then assigned a keyboard shortcut of ⇧⌘T in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services for the Automator Service/Quick Action.\nExample AppleScript code:\ntell application \"Preview\"\n    activate\n    if not (exists front window) or ¬\n        not (visible of front window) ¬\n            then return\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell application process \"Preview\"\n        if (exists menu item ¬\n            \"Show Markup Toolbar\" of ¬\n            menu \"View\" of first menu bar) then ¬\n            click menu item \"Show Markup Toolbar\" of ¬\n                menu \"View\" of first menu bar\n        tell front window\n            tell (toolbars whose ¬\n                description is \"edit toolbar\")\n                set lastFillColor to the ¬\n                    value of every color well whose ¬\n                    help is \"Fill Color\"\n                click (every button ¬\n                    whose description is \"Text\")\n                tell (every color well whose ¬\n                    help is \"Fill Color\")\n                    click\n                    click (every button of ¬\n                        UI element 2 of ¬\n                        UI element 1 whose ¬\n                        description is ¬\n                        lastFillColor)\n                    if result is missing value then\n                        click (every button of ¬\n                            UI element 3 of ¬\n                            UI element 1 whose ¬\n                            description is ¬\n                            lastFillColor)\n                    end if\n                end tell\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\nIf you'd prefer to use the default keyboard shortcut (⌃⌘T) for the Automator Service/Quick Action, then you can change the default keyboard shortcut used by Preview by adding it to: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > App Shortcuts\nClick the [+] button and set:\n\n*\n\n*Application: [Preview]\n\n*Menu Title: Text\n\n*Keyboard Shortcut: ⇧⌘T\nThen assigned a keyboard shortcut of ⌃⌘T in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services for the, e.g. Preview - Add Text with last Fill Color Service/Quick Action.\n\nThe example AppleScript code shown, as is, worked under macOS High Sierra thru macOS Big Sur without needing to be modified, nonetheless, future releases of macOS may require modifications beyond any localizations done for other settings with Language & Region when set to other than English (US) in System Preferences.\n\nFor this Automator Service/Quick Action, as coded, to work properly, in regards to Accessibility settings and Automation settings, one should be prompted to allow certain events and you may see messages such as:\n\n*\n\n*The action “Run AppleScript” encountered an error: “System Events got an error: com.automator.runner.xpc is not allowed assistive access.”\n\n*“Preview“ would to control this computer using accessibility features. Grant access to this application in Security & Privacy > Privacy preferences, located in System Preferences.\n\n*“Preview“ wants access to control “System Events“. Allowing control will provide access to documents and data in “System Events“, and to perform actions within that app.\n\n*Or similar type messages.\n\nThis means under:\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility\n\n*\n\n*Preview needs to be added and checked.\n\n\n\n*System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Automation\n\n*\n\n*Preview should show with System Events checked.\n\n\n\n    As applicable to the version of macOS this is run under.\n\nAll testing was done on an Intel based Mac and I cannot speak to whether or not any of this, as is, will work on an M1 based Mac.\n\nHow It Works\nIn the first tell block, Preview checks that a window exists and is not minimized, otherwise the remaining code would fail, and stops the script if the conditions warrants.\nIn the second tell block, System Events does the following:\n\n*\n\n*Checks whether or not the Markup Toolbar is showing and if not, shows it.\n\n*Reads the current value of the selected color of the Color Well for the Fill Color, assigning it to the lastFillColor variable.\n\n*Creates the Text annotation.\n\n*Sets the fill color of the Text annotation to the value stored in the lastFillColor variable.\n\n\nUnderstanding the code for clicking the Color Palette\nUnfortunately UI Scripting is necessary to perform the task required to set the fill color by clicking on the color palette just as if being done manually, however, automating this certainly beats dealing with continued manual repetition.\nIn the image of the Color Palette below, you will see how its broken-down into three UI elements.   UI element2 and UI element 3 are two distinct sections of the color palette.\n\nAs I tend to use the colors from the larger selection (UI element 2), I've coded it to click this section first, and if the target is not there, I click the smaller section (UI element 3).\nI'm mentioning this so if you typically choose a color from the smaller section (UI element 3), you'll want to switch the numbers of the two UI elements, switching 2 for 3 and 3 for 2 in the code shown below.\ntell (every color well whose ¬\n    help is \"Fill Color\")\n    click\n    click (every button of ¬\n        UI element 2 of ¬\n        UI element 1 whose ¬\n        description is ¬\n        lastFillColor)\n    if result is missing value then\n        click (every button of ¬\n            UI element 3 of ¬\n            UI element 1 whose ¬\n            description is ¬\n            lastFillColor)\n    end if\nend tell\n\n\n\nThe example AppleScript code is just that and sans the included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n", "Q: Kernel Panic Big Sur 11.3 Beta

As @Steve Chambers mentions, if you are running a beta OS, panics are normal to encounter and you are expected to report them to Apple. SE is the wrong place for this report for two good reasons:\n\n*\n\n*We do not have access to the source code, internal debugging tools, internal documentation, or engineers that are responsible for the design and implementation of the software, so we have no way to root-cause and fix this issue.\n\n\n*If you write about it here instead of sending your bug report to Apple, they can’t do anything about it, and this issue may end up making it into the final release.\nFrom a cursory look at the panic signature, there may be a bug in the USB driver. Here are some debugging tips:\n\n*\n\n*It would be good for Apple to know whether you have any external USB devices attached.\n\n*You should also try running with Safe Mode (Shift at boot) for a while, given that you have third-party KEXTs installed.\n\n*Finally, collect a sysdiagnose immediately after the reboot from a panic ($ sysdiagnose in Terminal or ShiftControlOptionCommand. from any app) and include it in your report.\n\nI enjoy examining panic logs but I’m refraining from continuing to help you debug this because it doesn’t belong here. Please close your question and send a bug report to Apple instead.\n", "Q: Can’t get out of failed big sur install Help!\nI made the horrible mistake of trying to update to Big Sur and now I’m stuck in a failed install cycle. I can’t start safe mode, the screen just goes black and nothing else happens. When I started in recovery mode I found out the problem with the install was that there isn’t enough space for Big Sur, fine, but I can’t stop it trying to install because I can’t get into the computer to get rid of the install file. I tried to revert to a time machine back-up from an external hard drive but even that failed.\nIs there some way of interrupting the install so I can just get rid of the stupid thing?\nIf not is getting a disc of an earlier operating system and trying to boot from that likely to work? I don’t want to do this as I imagine I would lose all my data...?\n\nA: I would get A external hard drlve and install the software on that, then use target fish mode to transfer files. Then erase Mac and install macOS. Then you would transfer files over.\n", "Q: Repurpose Fusion Drive - Booting from USB 3.2 Gen 2 SSD iMac Retina 4k 21.5\" (2019) 3GHz Core i5 with 8 GB RAM and 1TB Fusion drive.\nBig Sur 11.2 booting from external 1TB Samsung T7 SSD, backing up to a NAS.\nQuestions:\n\n*\n\n*Is the internal SSD (28GB?) active in this setup?\n\n*Can the Fusion drive be formatted and Windows 10 be installed on it using Bootcamp?\n\n*Can the Fusion drive be 'split' and the internal SSD 'fused' to the external SSD?\n\nThanks for any input.\n\nA: *\n\n*Is the internal SSD (28GB?) active in this setup?\nYour Mac was shipped with an 1 TB SATA HDD and a 32 GB NVMe SSD. So, you have two separate internal drives which were configured as a Fusion drive with macOS installed. You state in your question that you have an 1 TB Fusion drive, so I assume the internal SSD is active as part of the Fusion arrangement. You should be able to verify this by inspecting the output from the command diskutil list.\n\n\n*Can the Fusion drive be formatted and Windows 10 be installed on it using Bootcamp?\nHere, I assume you mean using the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows 10. In this case, the answer is no. You would be trying to install Windows 10 on a USB drive and the Windows 10 installer GUI would not permit this to occur. However, you can use the Boot Camp Assistant to download the Windows Support Software (the drivers), then you could install Windows 10 by using the Windows 10 installer CLI. For example procedures, see this answer.\n\n\n*Can the Fusion drive be 'split' and the internal SSD 'fused' to the external SSD?\nYou should be able use the internal SSD and external SDD to create a Fusion drive arrangement. You could even install Big Sur into this Fusion drive. I was able to verify this part of my answer by creating this arrangement in a VirtualBox virtual machine. I assume if this is possible in a virtual environment, then the same configuration would work with real hardware.\n\nA: If you are booting from an external drive, then the internal Fusion drive still exists as a mountable volume.\nThe Fusion drive is two physical drives that are just joined in software. Windows doesn't 'do' Fusion drives, so any Windows partition would have to be on one physical device (the hard drive).\nThere is some risk and no point to fusing the internal SSD with an external SSD. You don't gain any speed, since the external SSD is comparably fast; and you don't gain much space either, as the internal drive is tiny.\nThere may be an issue if the internal mounts at startup before the external. 'Part' of a Fusion drive is not a valid drive, so you won't have a boot volume.\n\nA: Not sure what you mean by active, yes to both 2 and 3.\nThe interesting point though is that Microsoft a few years ago upped the minimum disk space to install to 32, so 28 gigs might not be enough, or you may need to track down an older iso.\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/minimum-hardware-requirements-overview#section-30---minimum-hardware-requirements-for-windows10-for-desktop-editions\n", "Q: My MacBook Pro doesn't sleep when lid closed Normally,\n\nWhen you close the lid of your MacBook, it goes to sleep. There's no system setting you can tweak, and no command you can run, to change this\n\nBut, just like reported here -- My MacBook Pro doesn't sleep when its lid is closed. I'm sure because I have an external monitor:\n\n*\n\n*when my Mac is plugged in and I close its lid, the external monitor goes black immediately, then goes all the way to sleep (takes about five or six seconds), the orange light turns on, but that last only for about two seconds, after that power light become green again, and the monitor eventually lights up. It'll response to my mouse move/click, even the lid remains closed.\n\n*If is on battery, when I close the lid, MacBook goes to sleep.\n\nI hope this is a well known issue and there is an easy fix, because this is a brand new MBP, and I'm really really new to Mac and don't know much about it.\nSystem Version: macOS 10.15.7 (19H2)\nKernel Version: Darwin 19.6.0\n\n\nA: This is expected behavior and it’s called clamshell mode. With an external display and mouse/keyboard, closing your laptop lid allows you to continue working on the external devices. The momentary blackout is due to switching graphics modes. To put the machine fully to sleep, simply choose Sleep from the Apple menu.\n", "Q: File upload dialog file picker groups files by sizes When I use the file upload dialog to pick files it only shows some files\n\nIn this example it says \"from 10KB to 100 KB\" how do I stop grouping files by size? I generally like to browse by age not grouped by size.\nHow do I stop grouping by size?\n\nA: The drop menu, top left, can set by several criteria, including by Size.\n\nIf you set that to None, then you can quickly sort by any column header by clicking it.\n", "Q: How to set Preview to always open files in a new window? When I open files in Preview, I want them to always open in a new window, not as a document in the same window.\nI've tried setting these preferences, which did not work:\n\n*\n\n*Preview > Preferences > Images > Open each file in its own window.\n\n\n*System Preferences > Dock > Prefer tabs when opening documents >\nManually\nWhen I open a .png image with Preview, it reuses the last window instead of opening the image in a new window. I can right click > \"Open in New Window\", but that is annoying to do every time.\nPreview Version 10.1 (944.6.16.1)\nmacOS Mojave 10.14.6\n\nA: I also want Preview to open each pdf in a new window.\nApple provides instructions for this here, customized (use to pull-down) for each of the last 6 major versions of macOS:\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/preview/display-several-files-in-one-preview-window-prvw1085/mac\nThey may work for you, but in my experience, they do not work!\nFor Ventura / 10.3, they write,\n\nNote: To open multiple PDFs in the same window, go to Apple menu  > System Settings, then click Desktop & Dock . (You may need to scroll down.) Go to the Windows & Apps section, click the “Prefer tabs when opening documents” pop-up menu, then choose Always. See Change how folders open in the Finder on Mac.\n\nChoosing \"never\" should cause Preview to open each pdf in a new window.  Maybe it'll work for some. Not in my experience.\n", "Q: System-wide sound effects on OS X? Is there an option in macOS which would allow a 3rd party to install a system-wide sound effect on an macOS machine? Something similar to Windows APO (Audio Processing Object) technology:\n\"Windows allows OEMs and third-party audio hardware manufacturers to include custom digital signal processing effects as part of their audio driver's value-added features. These effects are packaged as user-mode system effect Audio Processing Objects (APOs).\"\nThe technology enables users to easily enable/disable system-wide sound enhancement algorithms (see screenshot).\nFrom the system tray:\n\nFrom the device settings:\n\n\nA: You can add Audio Unit effects, which can be used by any AU-capable audio app. Example with Apple originals & third party additions…\n\nGenerally, you cannot plug these directly into the Mac's audio output, you need an app capable of accessing them. Apps such as SoundSource can do this for any app or all, at simple general consumer level, intercepting between app or system output & the intended hardware out.\nThere is, of course, already a large market for these effects as stand-alone processors, in the pro audio world. From free to expensive.\nIf you search \"VST plugins\" you'll find many of these that come in multi-format, VST, AU, etc. VST is a proprietary format from Steinberg, but the plugin API is available for developers. Once the effect is coded (waaay beyond my abilities) then they are often cross-ported to other formats.\n", "Q: Fresh install Big Sur without deleting a partition Can I create a partition and store files I want to keep there, then do a fresh install to upgrade to Big Sur, or will the fresh install delete all partitions?\n\nA: While upgrade procedures are tested before macOS is publicly available there always remains a slight risk that things go wrong and data gets lost. To be on the safe side, always make a backup on an at least one external device (two devices are even better) before upgrading macOS.\n\nA: Installs can be side by side, but your files and folders and user data don’t merge if you have two or more systems. Some people store their user folders on one “volume” or “partition” and then have several systems share that account.\nIt all really depends what your goals are for the data and the apps and the OS versions. You have a ton of flexibility now with APFS and shared space storage management.\nOne new “trick” that’s very easy is install the new OS on a new volume and then migrate the data from the old “volume” - you do end up with two copies but if the new system breaks, you can delete it and go back to the old easily.\n", "Q: Replace TextEdit as the default text editor in MacOS Big Sur I just never want TextEdit to be opened, and instead set sublime as the default editor for all plain-text files. So not only files with *.txt extension.\nFor older versions than Big Sur the following command always has worked for me:\ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure \\\n    LSHandlers -array-add \\\n    '{LSHandlerContentType=public.plain-text;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.sublimetext.3;}'\n\nFrom this answer: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/123834/405588\nBut on Big Sur this doesn't work anymore. Even after restarting MacOS text files still open with TextEdit.\nedit: apparently after running the command above double clicking dot files like ~/.bashrc do open in Sublime. But when running open ~/.bashrc from Terminal it still opens the file in TextEdit...\n\nA: Have you tried SwiftDefaultApps? It's a modern replacement for the old RCDefaults System Preferences pane.\nhttps://github.com/Lord-Kamina/SwiftDefaultApps\nHere are two screen shots of SwiftDefaultApps, the first showing Uniform Type Identifiers tab for public.plain.text with Sublime Text 2 set as the Editor, and the second showing the Applications tab and Sublime Text 2 with public.plain.text checked. (This works the same with Sublime Text 3 too.)\nWith these settings, any plain text file, with or without a .txt extension, will open in Sublime Text when double-clicked in Finder.\n\n\n\n Historical Reference: RCDefaultApp @ web.archive.org: https://web.archive.org/web/20200312011847/http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/\n\nA: I had the same problem on Big Sur 11.6.1 - Intel\nI think it's due to mixed entries in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist\nSo I had previous sublime entries inside of it and I think that were the confusion was coming from.\nI've checked the CFBundleIdentifier inside of the\n/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/Info.plist\n\nIn my case it says it's com.sublimetext.4 (depends on the version of the sublime you have installed.)\nIn my case I have been already using Sublime for some longer time with previous releases and also with previous MacOS releases.\nThis is what I did:\n\n*\n\n*Removed the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist\n\n*Restart MacOS so the system recreates com.apple.launchservices.secure.plist\n\n*As the current logged in user executed\n\ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure LSHandlers -array-add  '{LSHandlerContentType=public.plain-text;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.sublimetext.4;}'\n\n\n\n*Restart MacOS\n\n*Voalá, everything plain-text based is now being opened in sublime.\n\n\nA: Now I also found a solution for opening text files from Terminal, like open ~/.bashrc. This answer finally helped. What I needed to do is the following:\nbrew install duti\n\nAssociate files of the kind 'public.data' with sublime as well:\nduti -s com.sublimetext.3 public.data all\n\nWhile I still would prefer to achieve such changes without the need to install additional tools the problem is now solved for me. But if anyone knows a way to achieve the same without installing duti please let me know.\n\nA: From Finder, you can click on a .txt, .rtf, .text, or other text file extensions and press \"command-i\" keys. This is for get info. You get a new pane that looks like image below.\n\nTowards the bottom you'll see a line that says 'Open With\".  Under that is a text box with \"TextEdit\" in it. That tells the computer to open .txt files with TextEdit.  Click on the textbox and you'll see a list of applications. Choose Sublime Text from the pulldown menu and close the box. Under that is the phrase \"Change All\". Click on this.  Now all .txt files will open with sublime.\nRepeat this process for other files types you wish to open with Sublime. Sorry there is not a single switch.\n", "Q: Bandwidth throttling / simulation for selected host I can control the network for the whole device with Network Link Conditioner but is there a way to do it just for selected hosts? I know that with /etc/hosts I can totally block connection to a host, but it's not what I need here. As a minimum solution, if I were able to make a host never respond, but just keeps loading forever, it would work, too.\n\nA: I make a VM when I need this and only install the conditioner on the VM. It’s usually no hassle for me to have the entire computer slow or lossy when I’m testing and then I return it to full performance when I’m done.\nI suppose it depends on why you are wanting to have differential speeds out of the same network interface.  It’s really a lot of complexity to poke holes in the filter when it’s implemented on a per interface basis. I’m curious what your use case is for not just doing the testing and returning your network interface to full speed.\n", "Q: Is it a bad idea for a file name to contain space and capital letters? When naming a file, (for example in OneDrive) is it a bad idea for the name to contain space and capital letters? Is there any potential conflicts it might cause? Should I use hyphen or underscore instead?\n\nA: Certain characters and special words aren't allowed and can make a file name or folder name invalid and unacceptable to OneDrive:\n\n*\n\n*Certain characters have special meaning and thus aren't allowed - \" * : < > ? / \\\n\n\n*On OneDrive with Sharepoint, these aren't allowed - ~ \" # % & * : < > ? / \\ { | }.\n\n\n*Leading (before the filename) and trailing (after the filename) spaces in file or folder names also aren't allowed. If you're using Office 2010, you can't use \"&\" in file and folder names.\n\n\n*These names aren't allowed for files or folders: .lock, CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM0 - COM9, LPT0 - LPT9, _vti_, desktop.ini; filenames also cannot start with ~$.\n\n\n*\"_vti_\" cannot appear anywhere in a file name.\nSource: Invalid file names and file types in OneDrive and SharePoint.\nSo, while spaces are certainly allowed in the name, you have to be careful there is no space before or after the name. Both hyphen and underscore are also allowed.\nWhile spaces aren't likely to cause any issues, as others have pointed out, it is easier to type hypens or underscore in a Terminal command. Many advanced users thus tend to avoid spaces and use hyphens or underscores in general. In general though, spaces in names should not cause any issue with MS Office or OneNote.\n\nA: This is an excellent question and from my experience, one big factor to consider is whether you will access the same files using command line or not. Consider these two different files names - Name Name and name-name.\nSay, you wanted to cd into either of these folders and compare these commands:\n\n*\n\n*cd Name\\ Name/\n\n*cd name-name/\nImho, 2nd case is much easier to use when scripting or using shell in general.\nThough first case is preferable if you are not going to do anything tech savvy as it feels more natural.\nName conflict (or collision) is a condition when there are two files with identical names irregardless of the characters used.\nAlso, remember that legacy applications may not support whitespace in file path.\n", "Q: Some websites do not load in all my browsers Some websites do not open in safari, firefox and google chrome. I have been trying for a few days now and it is always the same.\nIn safari, I get\n\"Safari can't open the page \"xxx\" because the server unexpectedly dropped connection. This sometimes occurs when the server is busy.

From your question, it is clear that you have tried different browsers but you did not specify whether other devices can display these websites or not.\nIn order for website to displayed properly, the server (website's end) needs to set appropriate HTTP headers. Here is a sample of what those headers may look like.\nWhen the browser gets malformed headers, it will not know what exactly to do with the received information so it will try its best. What will happen exactly will depend on the browser's implementation. As you have noticed, different browsers respond differently to malformed http headers.\nAs a general rule, there are several things you can do to troubleshoot:\n\n*\n\n*https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/ - if you do not have another device, you can use this service to test if the website is available or not\n\n*https://tools.keycdn.com/curl - or a similar tool - can be used to inspect headers; but the same can be achieved with Google Chrome - see this SO question\n", "Q: How to add a track to Library in Apple Music using Apple Script I searched through a few posts online and most of them say to use this:\ntell application \"Music\"\n    duplicate current track to source \"Library\"\nend tell\n\n...but I get the following error:\n\"Music got an error: Can’t set source \\\"Library\\\" to current track.\" number -10006 from source \"Library\"\nDid Apple change/remove adding a track to the Library?

For some time now, Mail.app takes three minute or more to display its window, and for that interval, is labeled \"not responding.\"  There are several things that are related somehow:\n\n*\n\n*During that interval, fseventsd consumes 82%±3% of CPU.\n\n*If we run /usr/sbin/repairHomePermissions, Mail launches normally, but the fix only lasts a couple of days.\n\n*If we rebuild mailboxes, it is not fixed; if we remove all the IMAP accounts and reinstall them, it is not fixed; but if we rebuild mailboxes after that reinstall, it is normal, but again, only for a day or two.\n\n*If we remove everything from /Library/LaunchDaemons, and reboot, it works normally.  Did that today, so I don't know yet how long it will last.\n\nHere is what was in LaunchDaemons:\ncom.acapelagroup.iVoxHelper.plist\ncom.adobe.ARMDC.Communicator.plist\ncom.adobe.ARMDC.SMJobBlessHelper.plist\ncom.apple.installer.osmessagetracing.plist\ncom.barebones.authd.plist\ncom.malwarebytes.HelperTool.plist\ncom.malwarebytes.mbam.rtprotection.daemon.plist\ncom.malwarebytes.mbam.settings.daemon.plist\ncom.oracle.java.Helper-Tool.plist\ncom.paragon-software.installer.plist\ncom.paragon-software.ntfs.loader.plist\ncom.paragon-software.ntfsd.plist\ncom.prey.agent.plist\nhomebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist\nhomebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist\nhomebrew.mxcl.unbound.plist\norg.macports.rsyncd.plist\n\nI believe all of that has been around for longer than the problem.  I recently got a new 2019 MBP with Catalina, upgraded to Big Sur, and used Migration Assistant to bring everything in from a 2012 MBP with Catalina.  This problem never occurred on the old MBP, and I think (not certain) that it did not start immediately on the new one.  I'm fairly sure I used it for weeks before this started happening.\nIdeas?  It's going to take two days to find out whether removing some LauchDaemon is a permanent fix, and if so, weeks to figure out which one.  And it would still be a mystery how it interacts with permissions and mailboxes.\nfseventsd is known to suck up CPU for Time Machine, but this problem has happened with Time Machine turned off and when the TM disks aren't even plugged in.  And opening Mail should be making roughly the same disk actions each time it is launched.\nhttps://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/10/mac-os-x-10-5/7/\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/1502226\nAnother oddity (but I think it's unrelated) is that Photos.app is allegedly using a lot of energy when the Dock, ps -ef, and Activity Monitor all say Photos is not running.  (Though sometimes, photoanalysisd appears in Activity monitor briefly.)\nUPDATE: After an O.S. update, most of the time, Mail opens instantly, and when it doesn't, the delay is only a few seconds (never the five-plus minutes from before).  However, once in a while, for no obvious reason, a Finder action seems to take minutes!\n\nA: Let’s see what Mail is doing:\n\n*\n\n*Run the following Terminal command to enable kernel symbolication: $ sudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\"\n\n*Reboot your machine and don’t open any apps except for Terminal.\n\n*Open Mail and wait a few moments for it to reach its steady-state unresponsiveness.\n\n*Run the following command in Terminal, making sure you’re only running it during the window of time that Mail is unresponsive: $ sudo spindump -reveal -noProcessingWhileSampling\n\n*After waiting for 10 seconds to collect a sample and another minute or two to symbolicate and format, you’ll get a file in /tmp/spindump.txt that contains a stackshot of every process.\n\n*Upload the file to PasteBin or some equivalent place and we can take a look to see what Mail’s main thread is blocked on.\n\n\nA: I just wanted to share here what has worked for me and others:\nrm -f ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Mail/Plug-ins/Bundles/Library/Mail/Bundles/Properties.plist\n\nA: I had this problem as well and as a bit of a last resort, I actually installed CleanMyMac X to see if they had any recommendations. I'm normally extremely wary of this sort of ambiguous \"cleanup\" software after the CCleaner fiasco (and some of the stuff CleanMyMac suggests doing looks insanely dangerous from a developer perspective, like randomly deleting portions of applications like localization files and alternate architectures; I need to learn why this doesn't instantly break code signatures & gatekeeper).\nBut I digress. I tried their \"mail attachments\" cleanup and … suddenly Mail.app launches within seconds again. I think you can do this yourself by manually clearing out your \"Mail Downloads\" folder.  I think there might be multiple causes for launch slowness but this did reliably fix mine.\n\nA: Check if you have any Mail plugins installed (Mail > Preferences > General > Manage plugins).\nIf so, disable them and restart Mail to check if Mail's launch time goes back to normal. If that is the case, quit Mail, remove all Plugins from /Library/Mail/Bundles and restart Mail. Then reinstall the plugins.\nIn my case, this procedure fixed the launch time issue (on my MacBook Pro 2021, launch time changed from over 30 seconds to instantly).\n\nA: The following command fixed it for me:\nrm -f ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Mail/Plug-ins/Bundles/Library/Mail/Bundles/Properties.plist\n\nA: I also have this problem exactly as described.  A quick fix for me is to just turn off the Mac - not shut it down - and restart.  I hate doing it, but it fixes mail for awhile and so far nothing horrible has happened to my filesystem.\n", "Q: TeamViewer QuickSupport - Scam Damage Assessment I'm a freelance IT support tech. One of my customers was trying to install Amazon Music on his new TV, googled how to do it, found an 800 number and called it. Sure enough, a very helpful professional was glad to help him set it up. He was asked to install TeamViewer on his Iphone. He did and shared his ID, then clicked on \"Allow\". He relays that was as far as he got because the allow button did not seem to work, even though he tried it twice. The helpful operator then asked him to share the last two deposits made to his checking account so they could \"confirm his account\". Once the words checking accounts came up the spell was broken and he realized he had called a scam call center. My question is, the call lasted 11 minutes. Is it possible they copied content from his iphone without him seeing it? In other words, once connected into the iphone, can the scammer run an app in the background that the victim does not see on the screen? It is my understanding that IOS does not work like that (as you could on a PC). For example, could they have hoovered up his Onedrive docs? Or installed spyware?\n\nA: I'm a regular licensed TeamViewer user and frequently lament the security inherent in the iPhone OS. In your case, it's a good thing. The phone app is for remote control in which the phone owner is controlling the other computer. The \"allow\" button doesn't work, because the remote scammer can't penetrate the iPhone. Additionally, when the connection is PC to PC, there are flags which appear during file transfer.\nUnless passwords and login information was provided via voice, no OneDrive access is likely and certainly no spyware installed on an iPhone.\n", "Q: Why won't my iMac boot? (com.apple.displaypolicyd exited with abnormal code: 1) I'm using a 21.5-inch 2017 iMac with 3.6GHz i7 CPU, and Radeon Pro 560 graphics card. I'm running Mac OS Mojave 10.14.6\nFor the last week, the iMac will not finish booting. The progress bar gets halfway, it stalls, and eventually it appears to shut off. If I boot in safe mode, it will boot.\nI have removed all non-Apple extensions, login items, daemons, etc, etc. But it makes no difference.\nIn the console, I see the following error message every time at the exact timestamp of the boot sequence where the Mac dies:\ncom.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.displaypolicyd[418]): Service exited with abnormal code: 1\n\nAll the questions I can find online about com.apple.displaypolicyd seem to involve Hackintoshes. This is not a Hackintosh.\nUPDATE (2021-02-08): After enabling verbose mode, here's a sequence of screenshots during boot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sequence ends with what looks like:\nIOConsoleUsers: time(0) 0->0, lin 0, llk 1,\nIOConsoleUsers: GIOScreenLockState 3, hs 0, bs 0, now 0, sm 0x0\n\nDoes anyone have any insight on what might be going on? Is the graphics card going bad? Might there be some setting I could adjust to fix this?\nUPDATE (2021-03-03): Noticed today there is a /var/log/displaypolicy/ folder containing the files displaypolicyd.1/0/0.log, displaypolicyd.log, and iogdiagnose-last.bin. In case these might be useful in diagnosing the issue, here is a ZIP of those files.\nUPDATE (2021-04-30): Sorry for the long delay. Here's another set of images made after setting the additional boot-args requested by @pion. Not sure there's a ton of difference, but please let me know if you see anything significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sequence ends in almost the same place as before, with what looks like:\nIOConsoleUsers: GIOScreenLockState 3, hs 0, bs 0, now 0, sm 0x0\n  levelControl->setValueChangeHandler ( &changeVolumeHandler <ptr>, this <ptr> ) for coreAudioChannel ID 0\n  controlID: 0, coreAudioChannelID = 0 MASTER oldValue 0xC newVa\n\nIt ends mid-line (presumably that would have been \"newValue\"). The screen remains unchanged for a few moments, then everything goes black.\n\nA: Let’s start with the basics and permanently enable verbose mode for booting (you can always turn it off later). Boot into Safe Mode (or single-user mode, either should work) and run the following in Terminal:\n$ sudo nvram boot-args=\"-v\"\n\nThen reboot. As you are booting, I recommend using your iPhone to take a slow-mo video of the screen so you can capture the boot text. If you can then put together some screencaps of full screens of text and share them here, we can try to see if we can catch a log of the failure sequence.\nUPDATE:\nFrom your screenshots I am starting to suspect GPU involvement. Try booting with the following and see if you get different output:\n$ sudo nvram boot-args=\"-v panic_on_display_hang panic_on_gpu_hang\"\n\nAlso can you boot into safe mode and check /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports for anything involving displaypolicyd?\n", "Q: Open a web page in Google Chrome without activating it Sometimes I want to open a web page in Google Chrome, but without switching to the browser.

My wife tutors for a company that uses Microsoft Teams and Google Drive File Stream to communicate to their students and assign lessons.\nA few days ago (2/1/2021), GDFS began \"disappearing\" without permission, prompt or warning.  It gets replaced by a version of \"Google Drive\" that will not run on El Capitan!  No warning, no explanation, nothing.\nAdding to the confusion is the fact that Google had stand-alone versions of both Google Drive and Google Drive File Stream, the latter being the only one that would work for her company.\nThe computer she has is a 15\" Macbook Pro Late 2011.  I have good reasons for not upgrading the OS.\nCan anyone come up with a way to stop this app from upgrading itself without permission? I have tried everything I can think of. Much appreciated!\n\nA: I am answering this myself from my rather limited experience because there have been no responses and there is almost nothing about this issue on the web right now.\nGoogle decided to merge the enterprise version of its desktop streaming app (Google Drive File Stream) into its personal desktop streaming app (Google Drive).   They did this by having their Drive Stream app upgrade itself without permission to the new Google Drive.  Nice.  But the new version does not work with El Capitan.  No warning, no instructions, nothing.\nSeveral times, I re-installed the previous version, which would work until it caught on to what I was doing and would again upgrade itself into un-usability. I was hoping to find a way to stop it from doing so, but eventually had to give up.\nI upgraded the OS on that computer to Sierra, which took quite a bit of doing, as it was one of the 2011 Macs with the overheated/blown graphics display processor which had to be hacked into working at all.  It took me days to sort out, and only to get this one app to run.\nIt bears stating that Google does not appear to honor Mac protocol in setting up their desktop streaming clients. The app doesn't appear in the dock.  It doesn't appear in the Force Quit window either, so when it hangs up, which in my case would hang up the entire OS, you can't get out of the program without launching Activity Monitor and force-quitting several unannounced background Google apps. It puts an icon in the menu bar without option and also puts an icon on the desktop without option (when running).\nSo in short, the answer to this problem is you just have to eat it and upgrade your OS to at least Sierra, because their new app combo is not compatible with El Capitan.  I still think that someone could come up with a fix for this, perhaps by hacking the app to tell the Mac OS that it will run on El Capitan, (because perhaps it could) or on fixing the app so it won't update itself without permission, its doing of which, to my mind, is outrageous.\nI would welcome any comments at all or any methods that could be used to restore a Mac user's proper control of the situation.

Right now after the search I have to leave the keyboard and tap with my mouse, which is a huge productivity fail. I should be able to simply select it with my keyboard. How do I do that?\n\nA: This is not an answer, but alternative approach(es).\n\n*\n\n*One can use ⌘ + ⇧+/. This will open Safari Help and from that one can enter search word(s). There will be tabs list displayed with status/day (tabs currently open, Recently Closed, Earlier Today, by dates etc) and address. Everything what is available in Safari menus (history, recently open etc) will be displayed. This will work over all tabs, not only tabs in active window. Arrows + enter for navigation and selecting. This is text based and not visual search.\n\n\n*One can also use Window menu on Menu Bar. Last block there is all tabs open in Safari.\n\n\n*One can enable Alternate Control Methods in System Preferences > Accessibility > Pointer Control. Namely \"Enable alternate pointer actions\" and \"Enable header pointer\". Then set face expressions for \"Left Click\" and \"Use a switch or facial expression to pause or resume\".\nIf you reach the point displayed on your screenshot switch on head pointer with facial expression (\"Raise Eyebrows\" for example), move pointer with your head to the tab you want, use facial expression for Left Click (\"Pucker Lips Outward\" for example), pause head pointer with facial expression. It requires to have camera but it really fun to play with :-) - just raise eyebrows, look at desired tab, pucker lips outward, raise eyebrows.\n", "Q: Samsung ML 1670 printer refused to work under Big Sur I have an old Samsung ML 1670 laser printer which is often used when a bulk has to be printed.\nIt worked well on Catalina but after upgrading to Big Sur it is out of business.\nDoes anyone know if there is a workaround for this issue?\n\nA: Try to install https://support.apple.com/kb/dl905?locale=en_US drivers from Apple, then add new printer in Printers & Scanners panel.

Since you have not explained how you cloned Windows 10, I will assume you are confident Windows 10 was correctly cloned. Windows does have the ability to detect when being cloned and if detected, can result in Windows 10 not booting properly.

This would be my preferred method for now also.\nThe tricky part is that When I run the project from Xcode, I get the behaviour I expect - the text file is loaded and read. However if I run the executable from finder, I get nothing (Good Day Sir!).\n\nThis is the directory pointed to by Xcode under \"Products\" which takes me to the executable.\nHas anyone experienced this behaviour before or know why this might be happening?\n\nA: Your executable is looking in the current working directory (CWD).\n\n*\n\n*When run from Xcode, Xcode actively changes the current working directory to where your executable has been built.\n\n\n*When run from the Finder on macOS, the current working directory will not be the directory of your executable.

I successfully burned Windows ISO to a DVD+ disk but the drive reads it as blank DVD, I confirmed this by using another pc.\nI went to the USB drive way, I modified the BootCamp plist file to enable USB drive, I successfully created windows installation drive with BC, sat the partition, but when the Mac boots, it goes to a black screen, with a message “no bootable device”. I couldn’t find any way to read from the USB drive, I used both USB 2.0 and 3.0.\nAny help would be highly appreciated.\n\nA: You have to install Windows 7 to BIOS boot. EFI booting is not possible for two reasons. First the EFI firmware in your Mac is not new enough. Second, the drivers are for a BIOS booting Windows. The Apple way is to use a the Boot Camp Assistant and a Windows 7 DVD. You can choose either a 32 bit for 64 bit Windows. Windows 7 should include SP1. You can download the current Windows 7 from Microsoft. If necessary, the Window Support Software (Boot Camp Support Software) can be downloaded from the Apple website Install Windows 7 on your Mac using Boot Camp.\n\nYour model Mac can not BIOS boot from a USB port. Therefore, modifying the Boot Camp Assistant application to create a Windows 7 USB installer is a pointless waste of time.\n\nIf the use of a DVD is not an option, then the following methods can be used or adapted.\n\n*\n\n*The VM method. Here, a virtual machine is only used to install Windows 7.\n\n*The GUI method. The answer is for Windows 10. You will have to adapt for Windows 7.\n\n*The CLI method.

I installed Intel Power Gadget for investigating and turns out, just after a few minutes of heavier workload (clean install a bit larger maven project) get so hot the system limits the maximum core clock speed to 1GHz. When this happens the mac feels very slow and janky and even the most basic things can take uncomfortably long.\nI heard that this series of MacBook Pros with Core i9 has thermal issues but this seems ridiculous. I already bought a Cooler Master A200 laptop cooler and it's helped a bit, but it still doesn't feel right.\nDoes this MacBooks has THAT bad thermal problem, or should I take mine for a cleaning? I also read that a repaste would help a lot. Do Apple authorized services allowed to perform repaste and cleaning? I could not figure it out from official websites. Does the repaste/cleaning at a non-Apple authorized service spoil the warranty?\n\nA: AppleInsider tested the 2019 Core i9 2.4GHz MacBook Pro 16\" and found that it could maintain 3.19GHz under sustained load. This and many other sustained load benchmarks demonstrate that your issue is not normal.\nThe easiest thing to do is bring it to Apple so they can fix it. If you want to know more, keep reading.\nI think some repairs would actually require Apple Authorized Repair shops to reapply thermal paste, so I guess they are allowed to do it. They are also authorized to clean the Mac's internal components, and will often do that for all repairs requiring opening the computer.\nAny repairs done outside Apple Authorized Repair shops could void your warranty if done incorrectly, but there isn't anything inside your Mac designed to tell Apple it's been repaired by someone else. So unless they screw up, I think it won't void your warranty. In my opinion, I'd rather not risk it, specially for replacing parts.\nIntel clock speeds\n1GHz (and sometimes 800MHz) is the absolute lowest clock speed the CPU in Macs like yours can go. Throttling down to the lowest clock possible under Standard Ambient Temperature and Pressure (SATP) is not normal. Intel/AMD/x86 notebooks often throttle to some degree, but extreme throttling is usually a sign of a deeper issue. The expected behavior on well designed computers (such as the 16\" MacBook Pro) is to, at most, stay close to the base clock when under sustained load (CPU-only).\nYour Mac has a base clock of 2.4GHz. Based on my experience with Macs and your model's benchmarks, I think normal values for it on SATP would be 2.4~3.2GHz under sustained load (CPU-only workloads, discrete GPU disabled), or 2.0~2.4GHz under sustained load for workloads that heavily use GPU in addition of the CPU.\nHere are common things you can do to troubleshoot your issue. Remedies potentially fix the issue. Workarounds might improve your situation, but are unlikely to actually fix it. I recommend trying the remedies.\nCheck if you have the latest updates\nIt's very important to keep your Mac's Operating System (OS) up-to-date. Updates include bug, performance, reliability and security fixes and improvements. It also includes new features. Apple has previously fixed thermal throttling for some MacBook Pros in a software update.\nRemedy:\n\n*\n\n*Update macOS to the latest version\n\nCheck the temperatures\nThermal throttling is caused by aggregate component temperatures above the computer's thermal budget. This usually means the CPU and GPU because they are the most power-hungry parts, but is not limited to them. High battery temperatures or high VRM temperatures can also make the computer throttle.\nThe CPU and GPU can withstand temperatures as high as 100ºC, but that's the limit. Macs usually prefer keeping it to lower temperatures such as 85ºC under sustained load. If your Mac's CPU is at around 85ºC or more while throttling after a long time, it's possible the issue is the CPU's own temperatures.\nIf the CPU temperatures are not that high, check the GPU temperatures, which also present numbers similar to the ones mentioned above.\nRemedies:\n\n*\n\n*Check if the fans are working. 15\"/16\" Intel Macs have 2 fans, whereas 13\" and smaller Intel Macs usually have 1 fan.\n\n*Clean all computer vents and fans, carefully removing dust and extraneous objects that are blocking airflow.\n\n*Carefully clean then replace the thermal paste for the components that originally had thermal paste on them (usually CPU, but could include GPU).\n\nWorkarounds (I do not recommend. They will only alleviate the issue, not fix it):\n\n*\n\n*Use an utility such as Macs Fan Control to manually adjust the fan curve or max out the fans on your Mac in order to delay throttling.\n\n*Use an utility such as Turbo Boost Switcher to disable Intel Turbo Boost. This could delay throttling but will make no effect after it begins throttling.\n\nClosed operation and airflow\nMacs can operate with the lid closed by using an external monitor and peripherals. The MacBook cooling design inputs air from the sides and outputs to the back.\n\nRemedies:\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your Mac's airflow is not blocked or hindered by objects, fabric or walls in close proximity.\n\n*Avoid placing your computer on top of fabric, in particular if the fabric is designed to warm up such as carpets or blankets.\n\nWorkarounds:\n\n*\n\n*The higher your ambient temperature, the more throttling your computer could exhibit, so move to an air conditioned room if possible.\n\n*Try opening the lid and see if there's any difference in behavior.\n\nBattery aging\nPortable computers use batteries to continue working when not plugged to a power outlet. The battery is a consumable part of the computer, and its performance degrades as it ages. Apple has developed specific features to help with that.\nThe ability of a battery to supply the required voltage for the processor and other components is affected by its age.\nQuoting Apple:\n\nAll rechargeable batteries are consumable components that become less effective as they chemically age.\nAs lithium-ion batteries chemically age, [their] ability to deliver maximum instantaneous performance, or 'peak power', may decrease. [...] One attribute that affects this instantaneous power delivery is the battery’s impedance. A battery with high impedance may be unable to provide sufficient power to the system that needs it. A battery's impedance can increase if a battery has a higher chemical age. [...] These are characteristics of battery chemistry that are common to all lithium-ion batteries in the industry.\nWhen power is pulled from a battery with a higher level of impedance, the battery’s voltage will drop to a greater degree. [...] The power management system determines the capability of the battery to supply this power, and manages the loads in order to maintain operations.\n\nAs the battery's ability to supply a consistent voltage is diminished, the Voltage Regulator Module (VRM) will have to work a lot harder to convert that to a usable, constant voltage for your Mac's circuitry. This in turn can make the VRM overheat, which could cause your Mac to throttle other components to the levels your Mac is experiencing in order to dissipate the heat.\nApple, iFixit and many others recommend changing the battery when its health drops below 80%, or when its cycle count goes over 1000. Your Mac will automatically tell you when your battery reaches these thresholds, but you can use CoconutBattery to manually check the battery health of your Mac. If it's close to 80% or lower and you have already checked the other things mentioned here, this could likely be the cause of your computer's extreme throttling.\n80% is not a magic number. Battery aging is a complex chemical process also affected by temperature, and your battery may naturally have its performance diminished before or after this threshold. Apple is very good at managing (and even masking) battery aging by taking steps to remedy and keep the device working reliably for a very long time. I've had Macs with over 6 years old batteries still working fine.\nThis means your Mac's battery is probably fine and could still be used for many years. But the Intel Core i9 and the discrete AMD GPU are very power-hungry devices that draw a lot of instant power from the battery, potentially dropping the voltage, regulated by the VRM. The i9 alone draws 45W at 2.4GHz. So if your Mac's VRM is overheating due to the battery aging, perhaps it would be in your best interest to replace the battery in order to have better performance.\nRemedy:\n\n*\n\n*Replace the battery on an Apple Store or authorized repair shop.\n\n*Never use generic or counterfeit batteries or chargers on any devices you own. Counterfeit batteries and chargers have high risk of fire, swelling and irreparable damage to your devices, amongst potentially reduced battery life, increased aging and incompatible power draw. It's just not worth the risk and could end up costing a lot more.\n\nUsing the computer plugged in\nIt's possible that the battery will naturally heat up as it charges. This could lead to an additional degree of throttling.\nWorkarounds:\n\n*\n\n*Try using the computer unplugged and see if temperatures improve.\n\n*If you want to keep it plugged in, fully charge the battery before starting your workload\n\nDiscrete graphics\n15\" and 16\" Intel Macs have discrete graphics in addition to the CPU's integrated graphics. The discrete GPU is a powerful chip that competes with your CPU and other components for the computer's thermal budget. The thermal budget is the total capacity of your computer's thermal design to dissipate heat, usually measured in Watts.\nWhen the discrete GPU is doing heavy processing, it's expected that the CPU will exhibit more throttling than if you were only using the CPU. Macs automatically switch between discrete and integrated graphics depending on what tasks they are running and whether your Mac is running on battery or plugged in to achieve a balance between performance and battery life.\nYou can check this opening the Energy tab on Activity Monitor.\n\nPlaca gráfica = Graphics card.\nIntegrada = Integrated.\nSim = Yes. Não = No\n\n*\n\n*Shows whether your Mac is using Integrated or High Performance graphics\n\n*Shows which apps are using the discrete GPU\n\nThere's also the free utility gfxGardStatus that constantly shows an icon with the current GPU on the menu bar and can display notifications when the GPUs are switched, as well as which apps are using the discrete GPU.\nWorkaround:\n\n*\n\n*Close apps that are using the discrete graphics when you want higher CPU performance.\n\nExternal displays\nIntel Macs with discrete graphics often use the discrete graphics to drive external displays connected to them.\nWorkaround:\n\n*\n\n*If you don't need it, disconnect the external display\n\nApple Diagnostics\nThere's a simple tool that comes with Macs and is able to catch a few issues: the Apple Diagnostics tool (there's more than one link for it). Reboot your Mac holding the D key or or follow the instructions provided on the links. Running the tool will give you a simple result that can be used to find obvious problems with your Mac and (optionally) request support.\n\nThis tool is not a substitute for bringing your Mac to an Apple Authorized Service Provider (AASP), where Apple runs a complete suite of tests that is able to catch more issues than this diagnostics tool.\nWorkaround:\n\n*\n\n*Run the tool and see if it finds any issues.\n\nClean Operating System install\nIf everything failed and you think you have a software issue you are not willing to troubleshoot, you can try to do a clean macOS install. Before trying that, backup any data you want to save. This operation will completely erase everything that's on your Mac's internal storage and you will not be able to restore any data lost after formatting if you don't have a backup.\nWorkaround:\n\n*\n\n*Follow the instructions provided on this Apple Support link.\n\nA: There might be a problem with your voltage regulation module (VRM). If the battery doesn't provide sufficient voltage, the VRM will try to compensate by maxing out. So it heats up, and CPU throttles, so that the thermals go down.\n", "Q: Should I reset my MacBook Pro after a major macOS update? I've already installed two major updates (Catalina and Big Sur) on my MacBook Pro 2019. Is it advisable to reset (format) my machine for it to work at its best, or would it not make much of a difference?\n\nA: Unless you are experiencing serious issues (such as malware or other unexpected behavior), there's no need to ever reset/format a Mac. Even if you are having problems, it doesn't mean you need to format it. If you know the cause or are willing to troubleshoot the issue, you could fix most problems without formatting your Mac.\nMacs have separate volumes for the OS and for user data.\n\n*\n\n*If you reinstall macOS, it only makes changes to the OS volume, and you will not even realize macOS was reinstalled because it will reboot and everything will remain exactly where it was, even any windows you had open before reinstalling macOS.\n\n*If you format the data volume, you will lose all of your data, but the OS will remain functional.\n\n*If you format the whole drive, you will lose both volumes and have to reinstall macOS, after which it will ask if you want to restore your data from a Time Machine backup.\n\nPersonally, I've been updating macOS on my devices for several years without formatting, I guess ever since macOS Mavericks. When upgrading to another Mac I just restore my Time Machine data or use the Migration Assistant (both are built-in on macOS).\nIt's always advisable to have backups of your data. On a Mac, you can setup Time Machine and keep it running. Your Mac will create hourly backups for as long as the Time Machine drive is reachable. You can then restore all your data in case you upgrade to a new Mac or something unexpected happens.\nYou can also use cloud services to keep some of your files safe. iCloud Drive is built-in on macOS.\nIf you are having a specific issue, please search Ask Different for a solution and if you didn't find any, ask a new question.\n", "Q: How to not show search results for the whole Mac?

All of this worked fine; I can log in without problems, all files and foldes are there.\nHowever - in Finder, all top level folders in my home directory now have the generic folder icon. No special icons for Documents, Music, Movies, Pictures, Downloads, Desktop, Public.\nHow do I restore those?\nAny help appreciated - thanks.\n\nA: I had never modified account info correctly.

However, the keyboard on this mac is not working properly (liquid in the keyboard) and neither using the on-board keyboard, a wireless or a USB-keyboard I was able to boot in recovery mode. Neither could I boot in safe mode (shift) or any other \"special\" boot.

I have to work with both Windows 10 and MacOS (Big Sur) daily. I have the \"Show location of pointer when I press the CTRL key\" option enabled in Windows.

This gives me control over what browsers open certain links based on rules I write for it. The long and short of the tool is that it detects YouTube links, converts them from their usual form (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxXxXxXXX_X) to the shortened, share-friendly form (e.g. https://youtu.be/XxXxXxXXX_X), then sends this to an AppleScript.\nThe AppleScript is saved as an app and is below.\n#!/bin/zsh\non open location input\n    do shell script \"youtube-dl  \" & input\nend open location\n\nThis runs the shell script youtube-dl https://youtu.be/XxXxXxXXX_X.

I can \"Save Template...\", but the directory that I was told was intended for templates (~/Library/Application Support/Directory Access/LDAPv3/Templates) is stubbornly ignored on the MacMini.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions, please, as to how to proceed?\nSteve\n\nA: I learnt the following whilst fixing this problem. Perhaps it will help someone else in the future.\nA MacOS LDAP client configured with Directory Utility stores the configuration data for LDAP servers that it knows about in /Library/Preferences/OpenDirectory/Configurations/LDAPv3 in plists named <servername>.plist. These files can be manipulated with odutil (see man odutil).\nDirectory Utility can be used to upload those plists from the local file system or from the LDAP server itself.\nTo access the plist from the local file system, copy it to ~/Library/Application Support/Directory Access/LDAPv3/Templates and ensure that it is called <anything>.plist (i.e. it must have the filetype .plist). After that has been done, if you edit the server data in Directory Utility under the 'Search & Mappings' tab, in the drop-down labelled 'Access this LDAPv3 server using' you will see the text '<anything>' from the filename of the plist. If you select this, the settings from your plist will be applied to the client.\nSimilarly, it is possible to create an entry in the LDAP server itself that contains exactly the same text and use that instead. The following shows what I see in ldapvi when I look at the entry I created:\n13 ou=macosxodconfig,<local RDN>,<LDAP base DN>\nobjectClass: top\nobjectClass: organizationalUnit\nou: macosxodconfig\ndescription:; <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\\\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\\\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\\\n<dict>\\\n    ...the rest of the plist comes here ...\n</dict>\\\n</plist>\n\nNote: everything from the \";\" to the end of the definition is the contents of our plist - without the \"\\\"s, which are an artefact of ldapvi. How you get the plist into your server is up to you: I use Apache Directory Studio. The only apparent restriction is that the entry must be an organizationalUnit called ou=macosxodconfig. After that has been done, if you edit the server data in Directory Utility under the 'Search & Mappings' tab, in the drop-down labelled 'Access this LDAPv3 server using' you will see the option 'From Server'. If you select this, you will be prompted for a search base (I suggest you choose '<local RDN>,<LDAP base DN>', replacing the stuff in angle brackets with something that makes sense on your context. The settings from your plist will then be applied to your client.\nJust in case you forgot, you have to tell MacOS that your are using an LDAP server. You do this in System Preferences -> 'Users & Groups' -> 'Login Options': to the right you will see the label 'Network Account Server' with an 'Edit...' button next to it. Authenticate yourself by clicking on the lock at the bottom of the window, click on the 'Edit...' button and add your server(s) to the list here.\nYou may also need to go back to Directory Utility and add your LDAP server(s) to its 'Search Policy' (tab on the home window).\nSteve\n", "Q: How to delete a backup of /dev/fd? For extra safety, I recently decided to make a second backup of my Macbook's HD. Initially I did so with rsync, because I was already using Time Machine for my first backup. But then I realized Time Machine can handle backups to multiple disks and decided to use Time Machine for the second backup as well.\nHowever, when I try to delete the rsync backup in Finder, I get the following error message:\n\nThe operation can't be completed because the item \"fd\" is in use.\n\nA little investigation confirms that it is failing on the backup's /dev/fd folder. I understand that this folder contains file descriptors (although I'm hazy on what exactly that means). I think perhaps what may have happened is that the file descriptors in use at the time of the backup were copied over, and these are somehow marked as in use. In any case, I'm wondering if anyone knows how I can safely delete these items?\n(FWIW, I tried closing all open applications before trying the delete, which made no difference.)\n\nA: If this is an external drive, you can just clean it up from another host.\n/dev/fd contains the file descriptors for the current running process, so they're kind of special - you may need to drop down to single-user mode (command-s at boot chime), or plug the device into another host to remove this.\nYou could also try mounting the volume 'nodev' (umount $BACKUP_VOLUME; mount -o nodev $BACKUP_VOLUME $BACKUP_MOUNTPOINT) and just cleaning it up that way.\n\nA: In the end, I just ran sudo rm -rf. I suppose I should have tried that earlier but I am skittish about that command!\n", "Q: echo $PATH not reflecting saved paths I have attempted to add, export PATH=\"$PATH:/Users/My_Name/desktop/My_Folder, to .bash_profile, .bashrc, and .profile. I executed the command source ~/.bash_profile, source ~/.bashrc, and source ~/.profile to refresh the $PATH and it does reflect that when I execute echo $PATH.\nHowever, when I open a new terminal and execute echo $PATH it is unchanged.\nThe issue is my system (macOS Big Sur) will not recognize the updated $PATH when I open a new terminal unless I execute the source command every time to refresh my $PATH.\nFor context, I edited all three because I have scoured multiple sites for suggestions and have exhausted all my options.\n\nA: I realized that I was using zsh.

(Recent MacBooks + iPads available if helpful; Catalina/Big Sur) Briefly: Is there any way to test a Mac Pro (2013, cylinder model, Big Sur) without a working display — either without a display, or using a recent USB-C MacBook (particularly MBP 2019, MBP 2020, and MBA 2019, Catalina/Big Sur) or iPad (Pro, 2017 and 2020) as a display, either wirelessly or over USB?\nLong version: I’m trying to troubleshoot a Mac Pro + HDMI/DisplayPort display setup, which has been working fine for several years, and stopped working last night.  Both Mac Pro and display individually seem to power on as normal, but the display just gives a “no signal detected” message.  (Precisely: when the Mac Pro’s power-on button is pressed, its front lights come on, its fan whirs up, and connected external drives also power up as usual.  Similarly, when the external display is powered on, it shows its manufacturer startup screen, as usual, but thereafter just a “no signal detected” message.)\nWe have several USB-C MacBooks in the house, but no suitable adaptor from HDMI or DisplayPort to USB-C, so we can’t test the monitor with them for now.  So I would like to check that the Mac Pro itself, to see if the problem is on its side.\nIs there any way to test/troubleshoot the Mac Pro, either with no display, or using one of the MacBooks or iPads as a display or terminal?  The MacBooks are all recent models (≥2019), and on either Catalina (10.15) or Big Sur (10.16).  The Mac Pro is from c.2016 (i.e. the 2013-onward cylinder model), and running Big Sur.  They are all normally on the same wi-fi network, and one of the iPads is set up with the same Apple ID as the Mac Pro.  We also have USB cables that could go between the Mac Pro and any of these devices.  The Mac Pro is fully backed up on external hard drives.\nI have found earlier related questions suggesting Target Display Mode for this, but that seems to have been discontinued since High Sierra (10.13).\n\nA: *\n\n*Did you have Back To My Mac or Screen Sharing (VNC), Remote Login (ssh), or File Sharing (AFP/SMB) enabled on the Mac Pro beforehand? If so, try to connect to it over the network from another device. That’s the only way I know of to use a second device for I/O.\n\n*Does the Caps Lock key light up when you press it? If so, this is a good indicator that the Mac is responding to events in either the OS or at least in firmware.\n\n*Can you try to log in to the Mac by “muscle memory” (i.e. use your keyboard to enter your credentials like you used to) and use the Volume Up / Down keys (possibly with the Shift key) to listen for the UI feedback sound. This also would show a good OS.\n\n*Try going into Boot Picker (hold Option during boot) to test video out from firmware, in case this is an OS-specific issue.\n\nUnfortunately you’ll probably end up having to buy something in order to isolate the failure: Maybe it’s the display, maybe it’s the cable, or maybe it’s the Mac. (My money would be on the former two more likely flaking out than the latter.) Might be a good excuse to invest in a USB-C adapter for your newer devices.\n", "Q: How to view page source in Safari browser on an iPhone?

I'm using the 2020 Intel MacBook Pro and I'm facing the following problem.\nThe Auto-Dark-Mode of MacOS is not as stable as iOS or iPadOS. If I'm using a single app in foreground (probably Safari) and it's sunset time, the Auto-Dark-Mode works as expected, but when I'm working on a project so I have 5-6 apps opened together in foreground, Auto-Dark-Mode fails but the wallpaper goes to Dark-Mode (but the the apps doesn't), and it happened right now while I'm writing this post.\nNote: When I toggle Dark-Mode manually after Auto-Dark-Mode fails, they goes to Dark-Mode as expected (if they have light mode, for example some apps like VS-Code don’t change their theme with system). I’ve faced this issue on Catalina as well.\nHow can I resolve the issue?\n\nA: The answer is quite trivial: because macOS is buggy even in such core features.\nA workaround I use when I face similar glitch in the evening: going to system settings, not forcing dark mode, but \"forcing\" light mode instead, then returning setting back to \"Auto\". Switches immediately. But more likely the next evening you'll have to do it again.

I personally made the migration between the two iPad and everything worked quite well.\nEverything but ONE APP. This app, called Anamnesis, reported \"the app is not compatible with this iOS version\". I wrote to the app developer (www.fuze.cc) which is not answering. I wrote to each member of the Fuze team and only one answered me (Icaro) who is no more working on Fuze, unfortunately.\nI'm quite desperated because I strongly need this app to work: I use Anamnesis to register each patient I see everyday. I have about 1000 records in that Anamnesis database, which is stored locally in the old iPad.\nThere's no option in Anamnesis to export the database into a new one. There's no option to migrate it with a cloud service. I don't know what to do to make use of that database into the new iPad or to transfer that data into a new database which I can use into an app compatible with the new iPad.\nI'm writing an webapp with Zoho Creator, so one day that I will have the database I can slightly control the migration. But actually, I don't know what to do.\nThis is a screenshot of Anamnesis taken in the old iPad:\n\n\nA: Unfortunately it is completely irresponsible to store patient records without regards for security, backups and vendor support, and without being aware of the fact that the vendor discontinued the product and removed it from the App Store years ago.

I have a 2020 MBP 16\", and I bought two Dell P2721Q, which are capable of delivering up to 65W through the USB-C port. Could connecting 2 of these simultaneously somehow damage the computer?\nI want to use these 2 monitors as external displays. I know that macs can drive 2 4K monitors without problems, I'm simply concerned about the power delivery through multiple ports in the MBP.\n\nA: Connecting two power supplies to a MacBook Pro will not damage it.  The computer will simply choose to take power from the device providing the most power and if they are equal then the first one plugged in.  If both monitors are on and the MacBook Pro powered off then on power up the computer will likely simply choose a monitor to take power at random.\nUnfortunately a MacBook Pro is not capable of taking power from two supplies at the same time, so plugging in two 50 watt power supplies will not net you 100 watts of power but only 50 watts.  If your monitors supply only 65 watts, and you need 87 watts to avoid draining the battery due to high CPU load, then you should plug in an 87 watt power supply in addition to the monitors.  This is assuming you have more than two USB-C ports on your computer.\nApple planned for this in their design so don't be concerned about shorting anything out by plugging in more than one power supply to you MacBook.\n\nA: I am not sure why you think there would be a power problem. The Apple specifications state up to 4 displays with 4096‑by‑2304 resolution at 60Hz and the Dell P2721Q specifications state a native resolution of 3840 x 2160 at 60 Hz. The monitors includes a hub, so I would assume the 65W through the USB-C port comes from the monitor, not the Mac. In other words, the monitor has a powered hub.\n\nA: Yes, any device can damage another when there are cables and signals and physical attachments, but that would be an exceptionally rare event.\nAs long as all hardware is functioning, there’s no benefit or harm to connecting things to see how it works, though. Daisy chaining displays is on the way out with Thunderbolt 3 and USB 4 since the hubs are becoming quite inexpensive.\nI would connect things straight and make sure everything is working first before you try chaining.\n", "Q: iOS Shortcut to shuffle-play all songs by a specific artist in my library I would like to create a shortcut in iOS 14.4 Shortcuts which shuffle-plays all songs by a particular artist.

In addition to that I often find that I like to keep something like a meeting agenda on the same screen without necessarily having it visible to meeting participants.\nDoes anyone know of a piece of software for Mac OS that will allow me to assign a portion of my screen (i.e. the 16:9 bit, so the first 2560px in width and all 1440px in height) and let me expose that to screen sharing apps as an additional \"virtual monitor\". With Quicktime screen recording you can select a portion of the screen to record. I'm looking for something similar that will allow me to pipe that portion of the screen into screen sharing applications.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: Not exactly what you are asking for, but https://github.com/Stengo/DeskPad solves the same issue in a slightly different way.

Ideally, I would like to select an Artist, and then have the Album view with albums only for that artist. Is there a way to customize either the Artist view or the Album view to do that?\n\nA: Use the Songs view and use the column browser (in the View->Column Browser menu)\nthen you can choose the artist in one column, iTunes (now Apple Music) then just shows the albums for that one artist in another column (and only the songs from that artist) and from that last column choose the album.\nFor example:\n\nIn iTunes the songs view used to be the main view and I think allowed more control but Music has dumbed things down and you have to use the other views sometimes.\n", "Q: Find size of a path excluding hardlinks on Big Sur I use a backup program which creates hard links of files with each backup.

There is no updating it any further. She has backed it up using a 2017 MacBook Pro running macOS Catalina 10.15.4. She purchased a new 8th generation iPad. It came with iOS 14.4. She set up the iPad and then tried to restore from her backup. Finder offered her the option to restore from her existing iPad backup. She clicked that and clicked continue. It then prompted her to agreed to the \"iPod\" terms of service (which seems weird—it's an iPad, not an iPod). When she clicked \"Agree,\" the iPad ejected from her computer and did ... nothing. She and I both have tried this multiple times with the same result. Nothing she or I do/try makes it restore from her 12.5.1 backup.\nShe contacted Apple tech support. They told her she cannot restore a backup from an older iOS version to a device with a newer iOS version. This is, of course, utter rubbish. It's actually the opposite—you can't restore a backup from a newer iOS version to a device with an older iOS version. So she's stuck with no way to restore her settings, passwords, documents, and, most importantly, game status (levels, accomplishments, etc.) to her new iPad, making her want to just return the new iPad and keep using her iPad Air until it really dies.\nI know this can't actually be our fate. I've restored numerous old-iPhone backups to new iPhones in the past decade without a single problem, ever. It shouldn't be any different with iPads. Why can't we do this? How do we do this?\n\nA: There's no general reason why you shouldn't be able to restore a backup of an iPad Air running iOS 12.5.1 on an 8th Gen iPad running iPadOS 14.4. In general, this should work without problems.\nIt could sound like the backup you have on the MacBook Pro is somehow corrupted.\nI would advise taking a new full backup of the device, and trying the process over again.\nAnother way to go would be to use the \"Quick Start\" feature. Turn on your new (blank) iPad and hold it near the old iPad (ensure that Bluetooth is enabled). On the old iPad, you should see a popup asking if you want to setup your new iPad. When asked how to transfer data, select to transfer directly from the old iPad.\nThe Quick Start feature with direct data transfer is available in 12.4, so as you're running 12.5.1 you should be good to go.\n", "Q: How do I change my keyboard type to JIS in terminal?

Can I use precision driver instead of Apple's driver?\n\nA: Unless you have one of the very early Intel Macs, the Windows Support Software is suppose to be available to the Windows installer during the installation process. This is so the Windows installer can access any drivers included in the Windows Support Software that are not already part of the installation software provided by Microsoft.\nIf you have an older Mac and are using the current Windows 10 release, then most likely any required drivers in the Windows Support Software will be already included in the Windows 10 release. In this case, having the Windows Support Software available to the Windows installer during the installation process may not be necessary.\nOnce Widows is installed, additional software can be installed by executing the Setup.exe application included in Windows Support Software. Afterwards, additional software can be installed through the Apple Software Update application. Windows Update may also provide software.\n\nYour question indicates you downloading the Windows Support Software after installing Windows. You can post a comment, if I am wrong about this.\n\nMy best guess would be you used the Boot Camp Assistant on a Mac of a different year and/or model to download the Windows Support Software. This is a common mistake. If you did this, then most likely the wrong Windows Support Software was downloaded.\nThe other possibility is your Mac Pro is older than the 2013 model. In this case, Apple does not support Windows 10 for your Mac. If this is true, then you should have included this in your question.\n\nThe fact that you do not mention running Setup.exe, but instead mention BootCamp.msi, indicates that you did run Setup.exe which terminated early with an error message. The message either states lack of support for Windows 10 or you have the wrong version of Boot Camp.\n\n\nA: You can search in RocketDrivers or other websites.\nFor the Touch Bar issue, just try to manually update the driver in Device Manager for each unrecognized device and see if it works.\nA Touch Bar driver will be found in the Apple Boot Camp driver folder.\n", "Q: How can I find out which kernel extension has been updated? I received a notification on Big Sur that an extension was updated and this must be authorised in System Preferences. It is 'System software from developer \"Apple Inc.\"'. I find this odd:\n\n*\n\n*I didn't receive any such notification in the past about Apple's own software (although I have occasionally received similar notifications about third party software). I would expect kernel extension updates to only occur via official software updates, which presumably do not require such warnings (or, if anything has changed there, then Software Update process is at least clearly happening rather than silently taking places in the background).\n\n\n*I had not performed an update of any kind immediately preceding this (that I know of).\n\n\n*FortiClient had just run. I believe it does some self-updating. I have a dim view of the software; it is always trying to be invasive and is regularly refused rights for various unnecessary installations of its own.\nI see the situation as potentially risky: it is possible that either someone is pretending to be Apple who isn't, or that someone is trying to modify an Apple extension.\nHow can I find out which extension is being updated and which process initiated this? I did not have much luck looking in Console logs or kext command-line utilities. None of the files in /Library/Extensions or /System/Library/Extensions appear to have been modified recently.\n\nA: The name of the software developer and the contents of the kernel extension is cryptographically signed to ensure that it cannot be tampered with. Therefore I do not think it is likely that someone is pretending to be Apple, or that they're trying to modify an Apple extension.\nHowever, I do think it is likely that some software you've installed (presumably FortiClient) has attempted to install an Apple kernel extension. I.e. an authentic Apple kernel extension that either wasn't installed before, or was installed in a version that the software wasn't compatible with - and so that developer has made the software so that it attempts to install the right version of Apple's kernel extension that they want to use.\nI wouldn't exactly say that's a good way of doing things - and certainly not without informing the user - but it does sounds like a thing that could happen in practice without it being nefarious.\n", "Q: iCloud folders visible in Finder but not in 'file upload' dialog in Safari, how to enable this?

Also, the OP originally included the question \"How can I ensure it is enabled?\" at the end of the post. However user anki made edits which changed the question at the end of the post to \"How can I upload iCloud files from Safari 14 on macOS 10.14?\" Since user anki is currently offering a bounty on this post, I feel I should answer user anki's question. Besides, user anki already correctly answered the OP's original questions.\nHere, I will make the assumption the users home folder is on the drive with the label Macintosh HD. Under a typical macOS installation, this would be a reasonable assumption to make. However, there exists the possibility the OP's Mac has been configured so the users home folder is on a drive that has been removed from the sidebar.\nThe steps to reach the iCloud Drive folder from Safari are given below.\n\nNote: These steps are meant to be taken from the Safari image posted by the OP. If these steps are taken from the OP's Finder image, then step 6 can probably be omitted.\n\n\n*\n\n*In the sidebar, select Macintosh HD to view the contents.\n\n\n*Open the Users folder.\n\n\n*Open the your home folder. This would be the folder with house icon shown below.\n\n\n\n*Open the the folder labeled Library. If this folder is not displayed, then press the key combination ⌘+<shift+. to show hidden files.\n\nNote: You can undo the showing of hidden files by pressing the same ⌘+<shift+. key combination. You may wish to do this after opening the Library folder.\n\n\n\n*Open the Mobile Documents folder.\n\n\n*Open the iCloud Drive folder.\nI tested this procedure by uploading the house image shown above. I noticed that if I wanted to upload another image, the selection window opened to the iCloud Drive by default.\nHow to Always Show the Library Folder\nTo avoid having to show hidden files to access the Library folder in the above answer, you can make this Library folder alway visible. The steps are given below.\n\n*\n\n*In a Finder application window, open your home folder.\n\n*From the Finder menu bar, select View>Show View Options or press the ⌘+J key combination.\n\n*Check off the box labeled Show Library Folder, as shown below.\n\n\n\nA: Most likely are 1 of these two things.\n\n*\n\n*The 'Choose file' menu is not a default uploader and uses some kind of Java uploader or other magic. If so, that it that I guess.\n\n*The settings in Safari are 'corrupted'. Just remove and add the iCloud folders in your sidebar and I expect that the Safari 'Open file' window will mimic the Finder.\n\n\n\nA: Within the 'Choose File' window you can go to the iCloud directory using the Finder keyboard shortcut for that.

If Time Machine goes crazy, it’s for other reasons than this.\nNow, if you are going to change the encryption keys, the pass phrase to unlock the actual encryption key can be changed trivially but the underlying encryption can be a very lengthy process of decrypting and then encrypting and that can be tedious or worse if you mess up.\nYou would want to get a thorough dump of your exact hardware, diskutil list and possibly more.

However when an appropriate app is installed links are automatically opened in the app by safari (macOS) without even a prompt in case of BlueJeans.\nSo my question is: is it possible to prevent safari from launching app when I click a link that can be opened in that app?\nIdeally I want the link to open in safari like a regular website without even a prompt to open it in the app. However, a prompt, like one you can see in the image below for Brave Browser would also be ok, because currently Safari opens the BlueJeans app without even asking a permission.\nJust to be clear, I do not want to uninstall apps, because sometimes I do need them.\n\n\nA: I found this BlueJeans specific link : https://support.bluejeans.com/s/article/BlueJeans-Detector-Service.\n\nAs you can see, the user is required to click on an additional popup\nto allow the meeting to launch. The user may accidentally cancel this\ndialog and then be confused as to why nothing happened. Alternately,\nsome users may not even notice the dialog and simply sit at this\nscreen, confused.\nOn top of that, an additional click may seem not so bad, but if the\nuser is frequently joining meetings, this adds significant friction to\nthe launch experience.

I have a Windows virtual machine that I want to open it from my iPad using VirtualBox, Vmware client, or any free App that allows me to open a virtual machine file (I assume it is local to my iPad).\nI tried to find a solution but I could not find. There are some advanced, non-free solutions by vmware for accessing virtual machines over the cloud (VirtualHorizon).\nAnyone have any clue about Apps that allow me open a virtual machine file from my iPad?\nP.S. this is not a question for me exactly. I am trying to help someone who can not afford a PC to use Windows/Office for some homework in their iPad.\n\nA: Running a virtual machine on an iPad requires a kernel and sufficient CPU support, which is not available on iPads at this time.\nI would recommend having a virtualbox system running somewhere else with VNC-server enabled for that virtual host, which you can then connect to from the iPad and see/use the graphical Windows UI.\n\nA: There are no easy wins for running a windows VM on iOS 14. Use native apps or Remote Desktop to a small PC or co-located one is the best current option.\n\nApple has an explicit hypervisor entitlement listed in the App Store Review guidelines and I disagree with the lack of CPU and kernel support since multiple third party books are written on iOS internals in addition to Apple providing SDK, headers and many developer resources.\nThis is more about app review and licensing / business models and engineering effort and less about technical feasibility IMO. Apple’s business model is that their first party hypervisor framework is macOS 10.10+ currently and I expect that to evolve substantially during the transition from Intel to Apple Silicon which coincidentally has always powered the iPad.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/documentation/hypervisor\nIn the App Store Review guidelines, Apple says it offers limited hypervisor entitlements but no broad prohibition of apps being shipped. Hypervisor are not under some fairly broad restrictions placed on Remote Desktop apps.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\nSince the 2018 announcement, VMWare already does virtualization on top of raspberry pie class SOC. Even though there aren’t viable first or third party apps entering 2021 for iPad, it’s not outright discouraged by policy or limited hardware performance and the iPad has a lot of headroom and tooling available should this be a market that needs service.\n\nA: The other answers here assume you're trying to run the virtual machine on the iPad processor itself, and they're right that the power isn't there.   However, you can run Microsoft RDP (among others, but that app is pretty good) and connect over a network to a Windows \"machine\" running somewhere else.\nIf your iPad user doesn't have a way to connect over the network, the rest of my answer here won't be of much help.\n\"Somewhere else\" could mean you run the Windows inside Virtual Box just like you're doing now and the iPad connects over the network to it.  Be sure that the virtual Windows machine is getting an IP address from the network and not being NAT-ed behind the network address of the host machine.  Inside the VM make sure you have the Windows system configured for remote desktop (here's a link: https://www.windowscentral.com/how-use-remove-desktop-app-connect-pc-windows-10-0 ).\nAnd if your user has decent Internet bandwidth, the same principles could be used to connect to a virtual machine running just about anywhere.

My iPhone 7 stopped taking voicemails.

I realise I'll probably have to format the drive and do a fresh install, but I'd ideally like to recover some files from the desktop folder before doing this.\nI then connected the Macbook to my older iMac via Thunderbolt and put the Macbook into Target Disk Mode, but for some very strange reason after a (lengthy period of waiting) only the SYSTEM folder appears in the mounted drive. I'm unable to see any other folder for some reason. The USERS folder is nowhere to be seen.\nI then thought if I created an install of Big Sur on an external drive, I could boot from that and then from the desktop I could access the USERS folder on the internal drive in order to rescue my files.\nI created the installation on the external drive, but when the computer restarted and automatically went to boot from that drive, I received the following \"\"Authentication Needed - You will need to authenticate as an Administrator to change the boot security settings.\"\nWhen I click on Enter macOS Password, I get this error : \"Recovery is trying to change system settings. No administrator was found.\" So it doesn't even give me the option to enter the password.\nThis is very strange to me, as I have admin access to this laptop, but it's not even allowing me to enter anything.\nI've looked into a few things now, and it seems these newer macs have some Secure Token on the T2 chips, and this error could be linked to that, but I'm not 100% on this.\nIt's worth mentioning at this point that the computer is a company laptop and after speaking to our IT department they assure me that they certainly don't setup any firmware passwords or encryption at a boot level, and they don't select any options that prevent the mac from booting from an external drive.\nTheir only solution at this point is a format and reinstall, but I'm sure there must be another way around this.\nDoes anyone have any advice on how I can access these files before formatting?\nOr even freeing up enough HD space so Big Sur can complete the installation?\nIs there a way to allow the mac to boot from an external drive given the error message\n\"Recovery is trying to change system settings. No administrator was found.\"\nA way to bypass this using Terminal perhaps?\nOr even, somehow copy folders to an external device via Terminal when the mac is in recovery mode.\nAny advice or things to try would be much appreciated.\nThanks so much\n\ndiskutil list shows:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:

recovery options to save the data requires the macbook being mountable via TDM and I'm unable to do this as it's greyed out and not mounting in disk utility. What would you suggest as a next step?\n\nA: You aren’t seeing the Users directory because of the read-only system volume that was introduced in Catalina: For every system volume named “Foo” there is a second volume named “Foo - Data” that contains your Users directory.\nYou mentioned that you can boot to Target Disk Mode. If that is still the case, go ahead and do that, but this time on your lifeboat Mac open Disk Utility, go to View -> Show All Devices, and check to see if there is an unmounted (greyed-out) volume next to your target’s “system” volume which has the “- Data” suffix. If so, select it and press the Mount button. You may need to enter a FileVault password at this point.\nAlternatively, you can use Terminal on your lifeboat to examine which volumes are available and what their statuses are:\n$ diskutil list\n$ diskutil apfs list\n\nYou can also do the same thing when booted into Recovery mode (Tools -> Terminal).\nUPDATE:\nWith your target in TDM and mounted on your lifeboat, run the following. (Make sure not to disconnect your target or add/remove any other devices from your lifeboat, otherwise the disk numbers may change and your data volume might not be on /dev/disk4s1.)\n$ sudo diskutil verifyVolume /dev/disk4s1\n\nUPDATE 2:\nAs I keep seeing more and more reports like this, I suspect that you are also in the camp hit with the unfortunate Big Sur installation bug. I suggest reading through that before continuing to debug.\n", "Q: Why is it difficult to drag with the Magic Trackpad 2? I am using a Magic Trackpad 2. I do a lot of design, so I have to drag and move items several hours a day. I click with my right thumb near the bottom of the Trackpad, and I drag with my index finger. The trackpad is very close to the laptop, less than 8 inches away on the same table as the laptop, the battery is fully charged every day.\nBut the trackpad doesn't behave in a consistent way. Sometimes, when I want to click an object and drag it, the trackpad thinks I am scaling in or out, and scales the view on my page. So I have to undo the last action, and try again.\nOther times, I click on an object and try to drag it, but nothing happens, my index finger just swipes the trackpad without anything moving on the screen.\nAnd other times, the trackpad doesn't click when I press down on it, no matter how hard I press down.\nI have been using trackpads for 20 years and it's the first time I find one so approximative and unreliable.\nI am extremely annoyed and disappointed by this erratic behavior - I think it was much easier back when trackpads had a clickable bar, and a non-clickable dragging area. It makes me lose time and confuses me several dozen times a day.\nAre there ways to make sure the trackpad understands what I am trying to do without getting confused?\n\nA: I also have problems with my hands and using force to press down on the trackpad. I have mine set up to not need any pressing down at all, by enabling \"Tap to click\" in the Trackpad settings and using the options under Accessibility to enable dragging by quickly double tapping the trackpad and then keep moving my finger.\nTo set up this drag mode, go to System Preferences -> Accessibility -> Pointer Control -> Trackpad Options... and check the box in front of \"Enable dragging\". I use it with drag lock so that I can reposition my finger if I run out of trackpad to drag on, but you can try either way to see what feels best for you. There's also a three finger drag option here, so try them out and see if any of them feel better.\n\n\nA: I find the three-finger drag option (inexplicably hidden in Accessibility > Point Control > TrackPad Options) to be the best way for dragging. It's a clear gesture that can't be confused with anything else, and becomes second nature after a bit of practice.\nNote that the noise and 'firmness' of the click can be controlled in software - in the System Preference pane, and isn't really a mechanical movement at all. Therein lies the 'magic'.\n\nA: Apple magic mice and trackpads are all designed as Multi-Touch devices so every brush and even close calls will register with the capacitive surface as opposed to direct pressure at one point. Just like the iPhone and iOS based devices, there are dozens of gestures in all devices with even more gestures available on the newer devices.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204895\nIf a single touch device (or multi touch that tracks fewer digits or less gestures) is what you ultimately want, that would explain all the confusion and need to learn and then retrain your digits how to not trigger any of the many ways gesture recognition will foil your intentions. Even if you disable most of the gestures in settings, the hardware is still tracking all those touch points even if the OS ignores some the hardware recognizes.\nThe mental model needed to move a pointer with a different surface handling the mouse down/up control is very different than a multi touch mental model of input. Just like those of us that learned to drive with a manual transmission, something is missing, even when we find vehicles shift paddles on the steering wheel. The old design allows behaviors the new cannot, despite the other new things multi touch allows.\n\nA: I have my trackpad set up so that a left click is initiated by pressing my finger a tiny bit harder into the trackpad, from anywhere on the trackpad.\nNeither the bottom left corner nor bottom right corner of the trackpad are special.\nI believe it's possible to change this configuration in the System Preferences > Trackpad area.\nI would strongly recommend you to start adopting the same usage. With this configuration and usage, a drag can never be mistaken for a scroll or zoom, because a drag has only one finger on the trackpad. No matter how perfect you may have perceived your previous experience to be, there can only be additional issues with using multiple points of contact on a capacitive touch surface, as compared to only one.\nUsing this clicking method also makes general usage easier, because you don't have to hover your thumb anymore, you can just conveniently exert the tiniest amount of force through your index finger—your index finger never has to leave the trackpad surface, a feeling I quite like—nor will you risk accidental two-finger gestures at any other point.\nIn a comment you have written\n\nclicking with the index feels completely unnatural for me and hurts my carpal tunnel pretty quickly\n\nThen obviously you shouldn't use this answer. You can adjust the force necessary to click in System Preferences > Trackpad > Point & Click, I have it on the lowest possible and barely feel any part of my body move when I click. You will also find that you can click with any action in your chain of articulation, using movement from your shoulder, or your elbow, or your wrist, or your finger. If you can find a single-finger solution that works for you, it would be the best solution, but please don't endanger your own health of course.\nYour other concern\n\nmight be a lot less precise to click and drag with the same finger\n\nIs not an issue (I have never found it to be), but in case you really feel impeded by the friction of your fingertip, you should move most of the weight onto your nail which will glide across your trackpad like you've never experienced before.\n\nA: I found if I turned off the Force Click option (System Preferences → Trackpad → Point & Click), the expected behavior returns, and I can drag files in the Finder again.\n", "Q: What characters/length are supported in Mail.app IMAP passwords? I use a password manager and created the password LX7mQW9Tw^V0$Ef2Ag#v*\n    (* don't worry, that's not my password any more, keep reading)\n\nMy DNS / email provider accepted it and I could use it successfully to log in on their webmail app.\nI followed their document on configuring (basic TLS-wrapped IMAP & SMTP) in Mail.app and kept running into trouble.   Eventually, while verifying my password I got the bright idea to change it to something shorter and with less-special special characters.   Finally, as the climax to about an hour of troubleshooting, it worked!\nNow I want to add a note for account setup to help my people avoid this limitation in, apparently, Mail.app (or not, but that's all the evidence I have so far).\nSo back to the question in the topic:  Are there known limitations as to what characters or length Mail.app will support for IMAP accounts?\nThank you!\n\nA: I have longer IMAP and SMTP email passwords than that, using all of those special characters (except maybe $) and have no problems using Mac OS X Mail.app\nWhile it's possible that one of those characters caused the issue, I think that's more likely on the IMAP server side.\nAs far as I am aware there's nothing in OS X Mail.app which should have prevented that password from working. I know it handles passwords that are 50 characters long and contain a variety of special characters just fine.\nIf you're concerned, try changing the password again, and if you run into problems try adding length to the password and using letters instead of special characters. Length generally beats complexity for password entropy anyway.\n", "Q: time command output I have a bash script file called readspeed.\nI am trying to find how long it takes time to execute a bash script file.\nWhen I run time readspeed, the following is the output.\n$ time readspeed                       \n6\nreadspeed  174.19s user 286.30s system 99% cpu 7:40.50 total\n\n\nI'm not sure what user, system, cpu, and total indicated.\nWhat are the differences between user, system, and total?\n$ type time\ntime is a reserved word\n\n$ echo $SHELL\n/bin/zsh\n\n\nA: The output of echo $SHELL shows that you're running zsh - not bash. zsh is the default shell in recent versions of macOS. The time command is then actually performed by the shell instead of running a seperate time program (but it is funnily enough not listed as a shell built-in). The rather terse documentation is available by running man zshmisc:\n\ntime [ pipeline ]\nThe pipeline is executed, and timing statistics are reported on the standard error in the form specified by the TIMEFMT\nparameter.  If pipeline is omitted, print statistics about the shell\nprocess and its children.\n\nThe meaning of the TIMEFMT parameter can be found by running man zshparam:\n\n   TIMEFMT\n          The format of process time reports with the time keyword.

Alternatively, m' or\nu' may be used (e.g., %mE') to produce time output in milliseconds or microseconds, respectively.\n\nFrom this you can learn several things:\nThe time measurements made by time covers both the time used by zsh itself (for interpreting your shell script) as well the time used by any commands spawned by the shell script to do the actual work.\nThe time measurements are split in a \"user\" and a \"system\" part. A program is considered consuming \"user\" time when it is executing on its own (i.e. doing calculations, moving data around in RAM, etc). It consumes \"system\" time when it has asked the operating system to do something on its behalf (for example reading data in from a file, sending data on a network, etc).\nIn addition to the above, you'll see that the last part of the output is the total time. This is understood as being a \"wall-clock\" time. I.e. the amount of time spent in \"user\" and \"system\" mode is determined as the amount of time the program is somehow consuming processor time, whereas the total time is the amount of time passed in the real world - including the time where the program is not actively doing anything and the system is also not doing anything on behalf of the program.\nFinally the \"99% cpu\" part states the ratio between the combined user and system time consumption, and the total wall-clock time spent. For you the \"99%\" measurement means that your program was in some form actively using the CPU almost all the time. A low number would indicate that the system was busy with other things, and your program had periods of idle time.\n\nA: From man bash\nIf the time reserved word precedes a pipeline, the elapsed as  well  as\nuser  and  system  time consumed by its execution are reported when the\npipeline terminates.\n\nSo you see the time spent in user space, the time spent in the system/kernel, and the overall time the command took.\n", "Q: Will iOS 14.5 mean my HomePod can use Spotify? Does this article mean that the HomePod will also be able to use Spotify as its default music service when 14.5 is rolled out?\nhttps://the8-bit.com/siri-now-allows-setting-a-default-music-streaming-service-on-ios-14-5/\n\nA: There are two separate things to be discussed here:\n\n*\n\n*Streaming from an i-device to a HomePod/Airplay speakers\n\n*Using Siri on HomePod to directly play music\n\nThe first option does not limit you to use Apple Music. You can actually airplay any sound over to your HomePod. Just select your HomePod in the Airplay settings or hold your phone close to the speaker while its playing music.\nHowever, asking the HomePod via Siri to play music from Spotify is currently not supported and that is apparently due to lack of Spotify supporting it. There was a feature request at Spotify forums that didn't reach enough votes. [Edit: a new feature request was made which qualified and is still \"live\" with over 4,000 votes as of September 2021. Spotify says they are \"aware of the vote count and popularity of this idea\" but have taken no further visible actions to implement it.]\nThis also implies that updates on Apple's side won't change anything. 3rd party support was announced on WWDC last year. Even further, iOS updates do not necessarily mean anything about HomePod.\nTherefore, I would be skeptical about this feature, although it is possible that support will be added at some point.\n", "Q: Why can't I change Apple ID email? The Apple ID account servicing page makes provision for changing the email address associated with an account. Not just the \"contactable at\" address, but changing the primary address, using the option \"Change Apple ID\".\nI want to do this for my five-year-old son's Apple ID - change it from the existing hisname@icloud.com to a Google Account hisname@gmail.com.\nI have already added hisname@gmail.com against \"Contactable At\".\nWhen I begin to change the primary address, I see the following pop-up, as expected (since I am the parent of the account-holder)...\n\nThe only problem is, that consent notice is never sent. Rather, the input form just updates to display the following error in red, including the bold HTML tags...\n\n<b>Could not send request to Robert.</b><br/>Your Apple ID change request could not be sent at this time.\n\nAs a test, I have attempted to change the Apple ID address to test@mydomain.com (I can use any wildcard prefix at my domain). That time, the consent verification WAS successfully sent.\nSo, why won't Apple accept hisname@gmail.com?\n\nA: From comments (& this took me years to figure out initially;)\nYou can't change an Apple ID address to one that is already in use as a 'Contactable at' or 'Recovery' address.\nOnce removed from there, then it will allow you.\n", "Q: How to disable \"ignore ownership\" option on an external volume on Mac OS X El Capitan? I'm using a MacBook Pro 13'' mid-2012 running Mac OS X El Capitan (10.11.6).\nMy problem is similar to https://serverfault.com/a/402216/616473.\nI use rsync to create backups from my internal drive to an external USB drive.\nIn order to save disk space, I would like the backups to be incremental. For that, I use rsync with the --link-dest option. It should result with rsync not transferring the unchanged previously backed up files. Instead, rsync should create hard links to those files.\nrsync -arv --link-dest=/Volumes/EXTERNAL-HDD/backup-1/ /folder-to-backup/ /Volumes/EXTERNAL-HDD/backup-2/\n\nFor example, the files that have been backed up during Backup 1, and that have not changed since then, should not be transferred during Backup 2. Instead, in the folder backup-2/ should be hard links to those previously transferred files.\nBut rsync doesn't work properly in my case and it is not hard-linking the files (and is copying it twice). The reason for this problem is that rsync is not getting the real UID of the files : https://terminalapp.net/backups-rsync-and-link-dest-not-working/ because of the \"ignore ownership\" option that is enabled by default on Mac OS X.\nSo I would like to disable this \"ignore ownership\" option for the external drive. After some googling, I understand that there are two different ways : via the Finder (there should be a checkbox in the \"Get Info\" section of the drive) or via the Terminal (Change \"ignore ownership on this volume\" from the command line for Mac OS X volume).\nI can't find the checkbox.\nI tried to that :\nsudo diskutil enableOwnership disk2s1\n\nwith disk2s1 being my external drive.\nBut I got the following error : Error enountered enabling user/group ownership: The underlying task reported failure on exit (-69860)\nSo, how the hell can I just turn off this ignore ownership for my specific external drive ?\nThank you for your answers\n\nA: From comments, your disk is formatted as FAT32, which is incapable of holding unix or even Windows permissions.\n\nIt is also very dubious in its hardlink capability. You can force them, but file repair tools are likely to break them.\nBy far the best format for Mac backups is GUID/HFS+ not MBR/FAT32.\nYou will need to Erase (not Partition) the entire disk to change it to GUID/HFS+ (macOS Extended, Journaled; GUID Partition Map in Disk Utility) so you will either need to abandon your first effort or back it up somewhere - but note it will not have correct perms already, so I'd suggest starting over.\n", "Q: Show telephone symbol in Calendar when using arbitrary video conferencing tools Due to the current situation I'm using a lot of video conferencing software to meet with other people.\nI organise my daily schedule using Apple Calendar Version 11.0 and noticed that when I'm using a Zoom link as the location for an event, a nice telephone symbol appears. When clicking on it I get redirected to the said link and can conveniently open Zoom.\n\nHowever, when I use less popular video conferencing tools (e.g. https://bigbluebutton.org/) this doesn't work.\n\nIs there a way to achieve the same behaviour for less popular tools as for e.g. Zoom?\n\nA: The only thing you can control easily is be sure the links to your meetings are attached to the event.\nThis very handy interface came to my attention using Fantastical and it’s super useful, and I’m also waiting for first party support of some handy conference apps.\n\n*\n\n*https://flexibits.com/fantastical\nI’m not smart enough (yet) to figure how to format other links that Apple doesn’t now detect, but know you could try another calendar while everyone figures out the exact mechanism to influence this if the vendor apps don’t get updated to claim their links in a manner Apple can connect the event to the helper app.\nHere’s the list of what apps fantastical can detect:\n\n*\n\n*https://flexibits.com/fantastical#conference-calls-section\n", "Q: Access chat in Microsoft Teams after meeting Is there any way to access chats after a meeting in Microsoft Teams?\nI have some kind of MS Teams app on my Macbook. I use it to join a MS Teams meeting when I'm invited to one.\nHowever, it is not the 'complete' Teams app which also has chat, filesharing and other stuff. I am not part of some company team with a Active Directory account, so I cannot 'log in' to Teams. The app just opens when I click 'Join Meeting' from an invite.\nSo after I wave goodbye and exit the meeting, where to the chats go?\n\nA: Those chats are stored in the storage bucket belonging to the tenant that paid to host the meeting. As a guest to the meeting it’s up to the persons configuring teams server-side whether you get to participate in chat past the meeting time or just for the duration of the meeting.\nI’ve found the in app help to be excellent, but we pay a lot for O365 and I believe our requests go into a priority queue. I would still recommend even free accounts try the help in app if you don’t have any other direct support resource for this situation.\nYour app is the same as everyone’s -  it feature flags and subscriptions enable functions so that many people have different experiences in “the same app, same version”\nJust like Office apps on macOS, it’s the same app for everyone, but the license you bring to it enables features based on which license Microsoft sees for your app/account. All you may need to do is pay more for your teams license if you need extra features.\nIn the paid version, the meeting chat is stored in the calendar, so as Microsoft adds features to the free tier, be sure to check in the calendar tab for past chats in case you do have access to them now or later.\n", "Q: MacBook Air 2020 multiport not working properly The problem: One of the USB-C port of my multiport is not wokring, all others are working fine.\nIn detail:\nThe multiport has two USBC sockets, SD and micro-SD card reader and 2 \"normal\" USB (I think version 3.0) sockets. One of the USB-C ports does not work, but all other sockets do. I need at least one USB-C for an external display and the other to charge the MacBook Air from time to time, but since I cannot use both I need to disconnect the display to charge the notebook.\nWhat I've tried:\nThe display and charging works fine on the one USB-C socket and also no problems if connected directly (I need the multiport also for the USB ports, that's why I still need it...)\nThe multiport should be working fine as I tried another one (same type) because the first did not work.\nIs there any updates to do or driver problems I have to solve? I am not so experienced in this kind of field.\n\n\nA: If both multiports behave the same way — that is, show the same flaw —  then it's likely the flaw is with the multiports' design or construction, or both, and not the fault of the Mac.\n", "Q: How to fix broken text to speech rate on Big Sur I'm on macOS 11.2 using a 16 inch 2019 MacBook Pro. I noticed when I use the text to speech functionality (system preferences > Accessibility > spoken content), the Siri voice doesn't adjust it's speech rate when using the slider (or the button on the popup controller). One thing I've noticed is that any other non-siri voice works. Furthermore, the voice was working till I reimaged my computer. Lastly, I have an older mid-2015 mac and it works just fine (even after I completely wiped it).\nI tried to copy over some plist files from my old mac to see if I could get that to work, but that failed.\nAny suggestions on how to fix the broken functionality?\n\nA: Well, it looks like it is a regression from macOS 10 to macOS 11. I confirm your saying, it worked and now Siri's voice speed can't be controlled anymore in Preferences Pane > Accessibility > Spoken Content\nApple does not notify anything about it in macOS 11's doc\nThe feature seems to be broken and bugs about Spoken Content are not new on MacOS. Look at this for instance.\nUnfortunately, I think your only option is to open a bug ticket on Apple's website and wait until enough people are complaining about it to get it fixed.\n", "Q: App crashing because of cache issue Our app is in development and currently in test flight. The latest version release crashes when the calendar feature is engaged. Our dev agency says it’s a cache issue and instructed us to delete the app, restart the device and redownload the app from test flight. While this works to solve the crashing issue, it’s not an ideal solution. Does anyone know of a solution to this issue that will solve for the cache issue without having to delete app/restart device/reinstall app in test flight?\n\nA: The caching issue is specific to your app, not a generic iOS problem. The solution would have to be internal to your app, and thus implemented by your developers.\n", "Q: TouchID does not lock MacBook Pro anymore on macOS Big Sur 11.2 Is it just me or this feature was removed after updating to Big Sur 11.2?\n\nA: This is apparently a somewhat common issue after upgrading to Big Sur or even the 11.1 -> 11.2 upgrade.\nYou need to do a SMC and possibly a PRAM reset.\nI was able to clear it by powering off the MacBook Pro, holding down the power button on the touch bar for >10 seconds, and then power back on.\nHope that works for you.\n", "Q: Toggling iterm2 with F12 hotkey on touchbar doesn't work Normally I use external keyboard with my macbook pro 2018 and never had any problems with toggling iterm2, I use cmd+F12 as a hotkey.

I had more than the approx. 12Gb required to installed (if I remember correctly I had around 21Gb available). Later, when only 2 minutes were left to finish the installation I had ´An error occurred preparing the software update - Big Sur´. This ended up in a loop after rebooting as described here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252038616\nThe problem is that apparently, the installation required way more than those 12G, so the only way I can think of getting out of this is to start in recovery mode, and use the terminal app to delete folders that I have in my desktop. Once this is done I hope the installation of Big Sur will work.\nI am now in the terminal (bash 3.2) but I don´t know how to get to my desktop.

If at any time this button is grey, then the folder is already at Default.\nAs to the second part; as far as I'm aware the Mac caches the sizes once calculated.

I always get a triggering \"The installation failed\" screen. Since Command+R can't be used to enter recovery mode on Virtualbox for some reason, I used the installation disk and I disabled Csrutil from there. I restarted to the \"Normal mode\" and guess what? It failed again! I double-checked using csrutil status and SIP is off, but why can't the guest additions be installed?\n\nA: You can not install guest additions when using Big Sur. I have seen some hacks posted that are suppose to work, but I have never found one that works with a Big Sur guest.\nHere are some ideas of how to substitute the functionality that guest additions may have offered.\n\n*\n\n*Screen Size: The command given below can be used to change the video resolution of the Big Sur guest. For more information, see section 3.14.1. Video Modes in EFI of the online Oracle® VM VirtualBox® User Manual. You can also download a PDF version from here.\n VBoxManage setextradata \"VM name\" VBoxInternal2/EfiGraphicsResolution HxV\n\nYou should enter this command with the guest is powered off.\n\n\n*Transfer Files by Network: You can use SMB to connect to the guest by the host or any other computer on the LAN. You should make sure the Attached to: for the network is set to Bridged Adaptor.\n\n\n*Transfer Files by USB: You can attach a physical USB flash drive to the guest. To do so, you must first eject the flash drive on the host. When the guest powers off or ejects the flash drive, the host will automatically attempt to mount any volumes on the flash drive. If the host has USB 3 ports, then USB 3.0 (xHCI) Controller should be selected under setting for ports.\n\nNote: VirtualBox defaults to SATA HDD for the guest. You can change this to to SATA SSD or NVMe SDD. Only NVMe SSD has trim capabilities, which I have found to increase boot times. (Booting is when trim operations are performed.)\n\nPerhaps, a better solution would be to avoid VirtualBox all together. VMware now offers the use of Fusion Player for free. You do need to create an account to get a license key. VMware Fusion Player is both Big Sur host and guest compatible with Intel based Macs. Also, installing is simplified. You only need to drag and drop the Install macOS Big Sur application into a Fusion Player window and the installer drive is automatically created. In other words, you do not need an ISO or flash drive to install.\n\nNote: You can have both VirtualBox and Fusion Player installed at the same time. Although, I am not sure if using both to run virtual machines at the same time is wise.\n\nIMO, the fact that I can not install Big Sur on my 2013 iMac, but can install Big Sur in a virtual machine on the same Mac, just seems wrong (or unfair).\n", "Q: Getting all email out from iPhone I had my email connected to an exchange server.

Health Data) I don't use iCloud and want to back up my iPhone on my Mac. I followed this guide to do so and checked the \"Encrypt local backup\" box, since I also want to back up my health data from my iPhone and Apple Watch.\nOne big question is, is my health data really backed up? I think so, but I wanted to make sure, since this data is really important to me, and on the website it said \"If you want to save Health and Activity data from your device or Apple Watch...\" but then it didn't even give me a choice/overview where it specifically said it's backed up.\nHere is the overview of my screen:\n\nThanks a lot in advance!\n\nA: Yes, when you choose to encrypt the local backup, the Health and Activity data will be backed up.\nHad you chosen not to encrypt your local backup, the Health and Activity data would not have been included in the backup.\nAlways remember when dealing with backups: You haven't really backed anything up before you have tried restoring it.\n\nA: This is one irritation I don’t get why Apple doesn’t solve it for us in a way that’s easy to manage and understand.\n\nNo one wants a backup, everyone wants to know the restore from a defined point in time will work. Apple didn’t show us the date of the backup to iCloud until just recently and still doesn’t make it easy to know the backup actually happened and what the time stamp is to Mac.\n\nYes - we know it “should” happen and apple has a KB that says it happens automatically - but we all know automatic things work for years until they don’t. Especially with health data - I wish there were a very clear indication that health data is copied and verified as correct with a date/time stamp.\nIt’s just not feasible to have a second device to test the restore since to check your backup, you have to erase the phone to get it ready for the restore. That’s no way to design a backup verification system in my eyes - there’s a saying about babies in bath water that covers the iOS 14 design implementation accurately.\nI would recommend you enable iCloud and back up the health data only so you know it’s backed up and get a date/time that you can see on your phone before you wipe it. Apple does let us choose what data to back up and health data should fit well within the free tier if you turn off all the other buckets.\n\n*\n\n*Back up your Health data on iPhone\n", "Q: Bring only one app to front after \"show desktop\" applied Consider the situation:\nI have many active apps on my (main) workspace and I've taken screenshot of one of them, which was auto saved on desktop.

Copy it into Script Editor, save it as a script to ~/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts/some_name.scpt and then use the Folder Actions Dispatcher app (available through spotlight, from down in the /System/Library/CoreServices folder) to attach the script to the desktop folder or whatever folder you prefer.\non adding folder items to this_folder after receiving these_items\n    repeat with this_item in these_items\n        set item_path to POSIX path of this_item\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            set this_disk_item to disk item item_path\n            tell this_disk_item\n                if its name begins with \"Screen Shot\" and kind is \"PNG Image\" then\n                    -- this opens the containing folder in the Finder\n                    open its container\n                    -- this opens the screen shot in Preview for editing\n                    open it\n                end if\n            end tell\n        end tell\n    end repeat\nend adding folder items to\n\n", "Q: Macos Big Sur port 80 permission denied with root im facing this problem where im trying to start a server on port 80 of a Macbook Pro with MacOS Big Sur and im getting permission denied.\nI tried running with sudo and also doing \"sudo su\" and then running the server.\nI'm trying running a Nuxt (node js) server\n$ sudo npm run dev\nError: listen EACCES: permission denied 127.0.0.1:80\n\nShould i unlock something?\n\nA: For years I have been running a local node.js server on port 80 with\nsudo npm run\nAfter upgrading npm to 7.6.3 from 6.14.11 i also get a permission denied error. The error disappeared after downgrading back to 6.14.11.\nNo sure if this was an intended change to run node on a port below 1024.\n\nA: No, everything is working as intended. You need sudo to have a command line process listen on low ports. There’s nothing you want to unlock here as this is a protective feature.\nI usually just test on ports higher than 1024 to avoid this risk entirely until it’s time to write a proper wrapper script, but all three options are just as suitable. (Use sudo, use setuid permissions, change the port listen number)\nTo use sudo - run a shell first, then the npm command\nsudo -s\nnpm run dev\nexit\n\n", "Q: is this swap memory use normal? I got myself a m1 macbook air with 8 gb of ram\nIve been using it for a month now and noticed that my swap usage is unusally high, is that something to worry about?\nAs you can see from the screenshot swap is around 3 gigs, and it hasnt gone done down yet.\n\nI was hoping that 8 gigs was enough for vscode and node but now I doubt it\nAlso, my ram usage in the activity monitor always peaks at 6.6-6.7 gigs, never goes up more than that.\n\nlabels are: all ram, used ram, cache, swap\nShould I be concerned?\n\nA: So long as memory pressure looks OK, there's nothing to worry about.\nmacOS keeps things cached in RAM as long as that RAM is not needed by anything else - that gives it a tendency overall to look like it fills up & never empties.\nThe same can be said of swap. It fills, the contents may change, but the swap figure displayed is always a \"high tide\" figure. You never see it go down until you reboot.\nIt doesn't serve you or the OS well at all if it were to periodically flush unused RAM or swap just to \"look tidier\". Its purpose is best served by it just hanging onto it all in case it's needed again.\n\nA: There are two major misconceptions that are often seen in relation to memory management:\n\n*\n\n*Full RAM is bad.\n\n*Full swap is bad.\n\nBoth are wrong.\nRAM is extremely fast compared to other types of storage, both latency-wise and bandwidth-wise. RAM is also extremely expensive compared to other types of storage. Hence, you want RAM to be always full, otherwise you are wasting fast and expensive storage.\nSwapping is bad. Swap isn't. Most OSs will flush pages from RAM to swap preemptively during periods of low system load but keep them in RAM at the same time as well. Why? Because swapping is slow, and thus you want stuff be already in swap in case the proverbial feces hit the proverbial air circulation unit. You don't want your system to start swapping out at the same time when it is already under high load anyway.\nSo, an OS will try to use as much RAM as possible by e.g. caching recently and regularly accessed files in RAM. And it will try to use as much swap as possible by preemptively copying data from RAM to swap, so that if the OS needs the RAM quickly, it can simply use it for a different purpose without having to save it to swap first.\nNow, when I wrote above that the OS will try to use \"as much RAM as possible\", that is not 100% true. It is more like the OS will try to use \"as much RAM as it deems sensible\", and defining what, precisely, \"sensible\" means is one of the things that performance engineers and kernel developers have been trying to improve upon ever since memory management was invented some 70 years ago.\nMacOS in, particular, will try to keep some amount of RAM free, and will also compress some parts of RAM.\n", "Q: Unable to mount encrypted TimeMachine backupbundle using DiskImageMounter I've been backing up two of my MacBooks to a network-accessible USB disk. The backups have been done using TimeMachine and are encrypted.\nOne of the machines was recently damaged and unrecoverable, and now I'm trying to pull some important files from the backup image. On the disk, I have a \"lars-mbp.backupbundle\", which seems to be an encrypted disk image. I've tried to mount the image with DiskImageMounter, but I can get an error:\nThe following disk images couldn't be opened\nReason: no mountable file system\nThe thing is, I was able to open this bundle a few days ago and browse the files contained in the backup, but now I'm attempting to do it again and I've gotten this error.\nI've been browsing through a couple of threads that seem to be related:\n\n*\n\n*Repair Time Machine sparsebundle that will no longer mount\nHowever, this doesn't appear to apply to me. Here's why:\n\n*\n\n*Running hdiutil attach -nomount -readwrite lars-mbp.backupbundle, I only get this: /dev/disk5. Unlike the examples in the linked thread above, there are no partitions or any mention of HFS.\n\n*The com.apple.TimeMachine.MachineID.plist file has a different <key>VerificationState</key> value. While the linked thread assumes the value is <integer>2</integer>, in my case it is 1.\n\nHere's the complete plist file:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>VerificationDate</key>\n    <date>2021-01-17T13:54:45Z</date>\n    <key>VerificationExtendedSkip</key>\n    <false/>\n    <key>VerificationState</key>\n    <integer>1</integer>\n    <key>com.apple.backupd.HostUUID</key>\n    <string>REDACTED</string>\n    <key>com.apple.backupd.ModelID</key>\n    <string>MacBookPro14,3</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nI've been trying to figure out what VerificationState=1 means, but I haven't had much luck. I came across one hint that suggests that it means it's in a locked state, but I haven't found any solution to clear this.\nMy only real clue as to the root cause is the fact that I was able to mount the backup bundle successfully the other night, and as a result of that, something caused the bundle to get locked.\nAny help would be appreciated.\nEdit: Here's some extra context--an attempt to

(And we’re all in the same boat as you - your ask is reasonable on the surface but unlikely to be met in a substantial way.)\n\nOn a practical level, I have had better success with choosing a mail client to match the mail provider and choosing a mail provider that makes Apple’s first party client work better by better managing the content that gets to my device in the first place.\n\n*\n\n*Work is Microsoft, so outlook it is. (warts and opinions on beauty are assuaged by a paycheck.)\n\n*Fastmail has provided sanity to me for mail I manage. It works well\nwith the native client and it’s own app / web app are well designed\nto my eye. I can afford it, and their business model adds value to me. Not everyone wants to fund a service that makes their mail work with native clients, though.\n\n*Hey + Basecamp seemed promising but I can’t seem to navigate the pain that burning bridges to the past would entail to make a run at using Hey for my email.\n\nJust like security software, email changes constantly and how you fund the salaries of people skilled enough to care about optimizing your time with decent software may be at odds with paying them once for software you expect to work in a month or need support in 6 months.\nJust like dozens of companies before it, I wish Postbox (and all newcomers to the space) well, but lifetime support on a fixed price purchase is hard to see as anything but a Ponzi scheme. Whether a company is VC funded or bootstrapping it, developing a popular mail client that do a better job than Apple’ first party client is a money-losing operation for the foreseeable future. Until enough people want to pay substantial money regularly, I don’t see a business model for the innovation you seek in this space.\nAs a postscript, if you don’t buy into mail and standards as the cause of this mess - have a read on how we can’t even agree what a valid email address might be. With that one header field still up in the air for implementation in a standard manner, a proper email client surely can’t be made today to a common standard of use.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.netmeister.org/blog/email.html\nI look forward to other people’s solutions to a gnarly problem and some requirements I can’t see being met in the next 4 years or so in a manner that was possible in past decades.\n", "Q: Big Sur - No \"Create New Folder\" option when using the finder to download files Since I've upgraded to Big Sur, the \"Create New Folder\" option has disappeared from Finder when it is opened in the context of downloading a file.\nHere's an example:\n\n*\n\n*A colleague sent me a file via Slack.\n\n*I'm clicking on the download button on Slack.\n\n*I'm browsing the Finder to the desired folder (I have writing permission in that folder)\n\n*I'm trying to create a new folder for that file.

I would like to disable opening Safari on my Mac. I don't want to delete or modify it in any way, I only want to prevent myself from opening the application itself (If I search for it, or try to open it, it shouldn't run).\nI tried using Screen Time's Content Restrictions by going to the Content and Privacy Section > Apps > and unchecking Safari.\nBut Safari still opens when I am distracted and look for it.\nIs there any way to stop Safari from opening?\nI'm using macOS Catalina. Would updating to Big Sur / higher version help?\n\nA: You could perhaps configure the Parental Controls to prevent browsing by limiting the websites you can view. (Big Sur may have slightly improved controls than Catalina.)\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchl8490d51e/11.0/mac/11.0\nThough of course, there's nothing to stop you from turning the controls off.\nUltimately, I would suggest that the best solution is a non-technical one.\n\nA: Install another web browser and make it as default. Also remove the Safari shortcut from the dock.\n\nA: To effectively stop Safari from opening, in Terminal type:\nsudo chmod 000 /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari\nThis command effectively makes the Safari executable unreadable and not capable of being run.\nNote: This permissions change may be be overwritten the next time Safari is updated by macOS Software Update.\n", "Q: Disk Space taken up by misc/other - not TimeMachine I have OS X 10.15.7 running on a 500GB SSD and OmniDiskSweeper, GrandPerspective and System Information show that I have used about 270GB but only have about 30GB free. OmniDiskSweeper just counts what is there, but GrandPerspective shows 191GB of \"Miscellaneous used space\" (big grey box on the side) and System Profiler lists it as 'Other'. I know I should have loads of space because I moved my Photos library to an external disk and I was sitting at over 100GB at that point, but in the months since then it has ticked away.\nI've tried tmutil listlocalsnapshots / but nothing shows up.\nSomething curious but possibly unrelated things\n1: the disk drive has that second partition \"- Data\" and it is listed as 500GB too. It may be just me misinterpreting the read out, or poor interface design on Apple's part. The reason I mention this is that Disk Xray Lite also seems confused about disk space, claiming I have used 536GB, presumably because it has counted System > Volumes > Data > Users as well as Users, despite them appearing to be the same thing.\n2: I replaced ~/Library/Application Support/Mobile Sync/Backup with an Alias that is to an external drive.

The screenshot of About this Mac -> Storage shows that there are lots of \"Other\" files on this partition, which usually means files outside of your user's home directory (and probably hidden/inaccessible).\nBy default, OmniDiskSweeper can only size folders which you can read. You may use Terminal.app to launch OmniDiskSweeper with root permissions to track down files your regular user can't access:\nsudo /Applications/OmniDiskSweeper.app/Contents/MacOS/OmniDiskSweeper\n\nAlso, /usr and /private are 10x larger than usual.\nAs for the second Data partition: That is weird.

When I try to open the Mojave install app on my computer with Big Sur, it says that the operating system is too old and so it will not let me open it in order to install it on the external usb drive.\nAdditionally, the alternative method - restoring Mojave onto the external drive is not possible because the Mojave install file is an app and not a disk image.\nHow can I proceed to create a bootable copy of Mojave on my external USB drive considering I am on a computer with Big Sur and the Mojave download is an app file which will not open and it is not a DMG file which I would otherwise be able to restore onto the external USB?\n\nA: Follow the createinstallmedia directions here: How to create a bootable installer for macOS\nFor the sake of completeness, here’s the command you would run in Terminal to create the install media for Mojave (it’s slightly different for each OS version):\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Mojave.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume\n\n", "Q: How to remove friend's HomePod from audio selection during phone calls?

It seems like I’ve used up all space on my MBP, and when I rebooted it it became corrupted/inoperable (when I go into disk utilities, Macintosh HD is “unmounted”, and when I press “mount”, nothing happens. On internet recovery, the same thing gives me “Alert: couldn’t mount disk”. Clicking “Repair” gives me “Alert: Partition map repair failed while adjusting structures to fit current whole disk size.”)\nI was wondering if it’s possible to recover any data from it? I have some sensitive documents that haven’t backed up due to poor internet connection. On disk utility it says the drive could not be mounted and I can’t find the drive via the terminal.\nThank you!\n\nA: Is your drive formatted as an HFS+ (macOS Extended) or APFS volume? If it’s HFS+, you can try DiskWarrior. (Though, from the sound of it, the corruption may not be in the volume itself but rather in the partition map, and I don’t know if DiskWarrior is able to fix those errors. May be worth reaching out to their support team.)\n\nA: Sure, all Mac hardware  boots easily from external drives.\nWorst case, you take a suitable drive for your Mac to another, get an OS installed and then connect it to the failed system. Best case, you can boot to internet recovery from the failed Mac and install an OS on to the connected drive and finish the setup without outside assistance.\nFrom there, Data Rescue is the first tool I would take to see about data recovery. Others exist, but that specializes in recovery so start there first.\n", "Q: Share / view files betweek Mac OS X and Linux (Ubuntu) using sshfs and GUI I just want to access file from Mac OS X (Big Sur / 11.2.1) on my Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.2 machine) and vice versa.\nI did not like the idea using SMB - or should I really do it??\nWhat I did\n\n*\n\n*OS X : Enabled System Preferences -> Sharing -> Remote Login\n\n*OS X: I am able to type sshfs (not sure why it knows the command I did some other experiments the other days (e.g. installed meld via brew)\n\n*Linux enabled ssh (server)\n\nWhat works good\n\n*\n\n*Access OS X Filesystem from Ubuntu via sshfs user@192.168.0.1\n\n*Access OS X Filesystem from Ubuntu via the files application by typing sftp://192.168.0.1\nWhat works not-so-good\nAccess the Linux / Ubuntu filesystem from Mac OS X : \nsshfs user@192.168.0.2:/ localMountDir works as well BUT:\n\n*\n\n*strange user and group : user: root, group weel\n\n*going deeper into the path (which is internally another SSD the permission changes from 755 to 750 (or rwxr-xr-x to rwxr-x---)\n\nHow to fix the issue ??\n\n*\n\n*I would guess it has to do with this trange user/group root/weel\n\n*If so how to fix this ?? I looked a little bit about users and groups in OS X but on the GUI -> System Preferences -> Users and Groups -> I do not see any groups\n\n\nA: Looking at your command to mount your Linux drive on Mac,\nsshfs user@192.168.0.2:/ localMountDir\n\nit looks like you are specifying that you want to mount the root of the Linux filesystem (that’s the :/ part). In general, most operating systems assign ownership of root-level directories to a privileged user (i.e., not you). In the case of Linux, root is the name of the superuser and wheel is the name of the group to which root belongs. So what you are seeing is, in fact, 100% correct. And it’s also no surprise that permissions become more restrictive as you descend into certain directories (e.g., if you are trying to cd into your own home directory then it’s expected that it is not world-readable [750], whereas the root of the filesystem should be world-readable [755].)\nWhat I suspect you’re wanting to do is to sshfs directly into your own home directory on the Linux box. So you’d want to specify that on your command line:\nsshfs user@192.168.0.2:/home/YOURUSERNAME localMountDir\n\n", "Q: How to scroll using an external USB trackpad that is not a magic-mouse? In some cramped situations I would prefer to not use the macBook pro internal trackpad but rather an external one as shown\n\nThe right/left clicks and the trackpad area do work fine for traversing the screen and clicking. But then how to scroll the current application window?  On the internal trackpad that would be done by two fingers on the trackpad.\nThe Settings | Trackpad only applies to the internal trackpad of the macBook pro.  There is also an \"Configure bluetooth Trackpad\" : but this is a usb.\nIs this possible? I do not want to use a bluetooth because I have bad issues with the bluetooth freezing the macOS.\nI have a 2020 macBook pro 16\" and am on Catalina.\n\nA: I suspect that the trackpad settings/bluetooth settings may not be all that useful for this.\nFirstly if you do a system report (Apple icon ► About This Mac ► System Report...), you can check to see if the USB device is recognised. This seems to be the case since your saying it recognises left and right clicks.\nMy only suggestion is that this may require some third party software to properly recognise it. For example: SteerMouse. Similar to if you have ever installed a joy stick for a simulator, it usually requires the actual third party software to recognise it.\n\nA: Looking at the picture of your trackpad it looks that scrolling is done by sliding the finger around the right border of the pad. Have you checked whether this works? Not sure if it supports multitouch, which would be required for the \"apple gestures\".\nThere's two Apps I would consider checking out.\n\n*\n\n*Better Touch Tool (paid) - which allows to customize touch gestures in great detail and even add your own. But AFAIK only works on Apple devices. Still worth a try.\n\n\n*Karabiner Elements (free) - which allows to create very complex mappings, but it is complex to operate. You can easily create mappings where mouse movent is turned into scrolling while a key is held down.  There is a Guide for hackintoshes which may help.\n", "Q: Mac Software Updates and App Store don't work over Google Nest wi-fi Not actually sure if this is a Google issue or an Apple issue, but appreciate any insight. My Mac won't load the App Store (the window stays white with no content) and won't download MacOS software updates over my Google Nest wi-fi network.\nAs soon as I tether my computer to my phone, the App Store loads, or the software updates begin, so the issue definitely seems to be related to the network.\nThe network is a Google Nest wi-fi mesh network. There is one base station and two bridged stations. The reliability is good for everything else—web browsing, Netflix, even iOS updates on my phone—but doesn't seem to allow the App Store or Software Updates to load.\nAll I can guess at is that my network might be blocking one of the ports that Apple relies upon for performing updates or loading the app store. I found this page which lists all of the ports and servers necessary for MacOS to do its thing: https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT210060\nIn the Google Home app, in the Settings page, there is a \"Port Management\" section, which allows me to configure elements of the network: set up parental filters, notifications of outages etc, there is an \"Advanced Networking\" sections which includes an area for Port Management. This does not indicate that any ports are being blocked. It looks like you can add port forwarding rules, but I haven't played with this (https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/6274503#how&zippy=%2Cnat-loopback%2Cwith-the-google-wifi-app%2Cwith-the-google-home-app)\nAppreciate any suggestions for how to fix this, as regularly tethering to my phone is wearing thin. If port forwarding is necessary, what settings would I use to permit the App Store or Software Updates to happen?\n\nA: I discovered that the fix for this was to change the Network Location (System Preferences > Network > Location). Mine was set to Automatic, so I created a new location called \"Home\" and used that.\nEven though the Wi-Fi network I was connecting to was the same, this act of changing the location made all the difference and I can now happily perform software updates, load and interact with the App Store, and generally use my network connection for everything I need to use it for.\n", "Q: Automator application that asks me for a YouTube URL before running the command I'm trying to make an Automator application that runs this command:\nyoutube-dl -x --audio-format wav -o \"~/Downloads/%(title)s.%(ext)s\" 'youtube file url'\n\nbut I’d like for it to ask me for the YouTube URL before running.

I'm looking for a very simple way to add a watermark to my screen which should be shown whatever I'm doing, is it during a Zoom call, or is it when giving a presentation, or similar (I don't necessarily need it to show during fullscreen mode).\nThe reason is that I want to record my screen using QuickTime Player, and the watermark should be on the video. I know that there are many post-production tools that offer adding watermarks, but I don't want to do any post-production, I want to have everything on screen while recording already.\n(I also know that there are screen recorders which offer placing a watermark to the end result. I'd rather also avoid using another screen recording software, but if I don't find any other way to do it, then I'm open to a simple, non-pricy alternative to QuickTime Player.)\n\nA: You can accomplish this with OBS Studio. It allows to combine images, video sources etc into one stream and provides a virtual camera which can then be used as the video source in Zoom.\n\nA: It's not the most elegant solution, but I suspect you could accomplish this simply by using Photoshop or another page layout app to create an image containing the watermark. Match the document dimensions to your display's native resolution (on MB Pro: 2880 x 1800), then set this new image as your desktop background. You could even use Keynote to make the image, if you change the ruler increments to pixels instead of inches - as I've done here: \n", "Q: \"This Card is Already in wallet\" message when I'm trying to add card to Wallet & Apple Pay which was removed I removed credit card and I'm trying to add it again in \"Wallet & Apple Pay\", but I get the message as in title.\nAt iWatch I removed and added the same card without problem.\n\nA: I removed other cards which I had already in Wallet and then one by one added them, also the problematic card.\n\nA: I removed all cards from wallet and when I wanted to re-add these got the message \"card already in wallet\".

By adding ⇧ will not make new window active.\nAlso - what action you call minimizing? Because I can't reproduce any sudden window opening if window is minimized (⌘ + M)\n\nA: Might not be the answer you're looking for, but on Safari 15 and up, a possible solution is the Tab Groups feature to separate out tabs into different groups.\nFrom the Apple Support page for Tab Groups:\n\nYou can organize tabs into groups that make it easy to quickly switch between groups of related websites.\n\nTab Groups can be accessed from the sidebar (View > Show Sidebar) and you can create them with the plus button located in the upper right there. Then you can move existing tabs into the appropriate Tab Group.\n\nUsing Tab Groups, you can separate tabs for your different projects into different Tab Groups. When you open other links, they'll open in your local Safari tabs and not in the Tab Groups for your projects. If you want to continue work on the project you can use the sidebar to open a Tab Group again.\n\nA: There's no simple way to do exactly what you're asking, but you could install Safari Technology Preview (or another browser of your choice) and use it for your project (with your minimized windows), while leaving \"regular\" Safari to handle links. Alternatively, change your default browser in Preferences -> General so that Safari won't handle http[s]:// links by default.\n", "Q: Alt+Enter Shortcut in MacOS For over 10 years I have been using Linux, where I always had Alt+Enter as a shortcut to open a new terminal.

There’s nothing wrong on your end. The most helpful thing you can do is to make sure you’ve opted in to share analytics which will allow your panic reports to anonymously get sent to Apple so that their engineers can work on fixing the bug.\nThat being said, one experiment you can try, if you have the hardware, is to use a different display hardware configuration. That is, either:\n\n*\n\n*Connect a different display to your Mac,\n\n*Connect the same display over a different link (i.e., Thunderbolt instead of HDMI or vice versa), or\n\n*Run without a display using Screen Sharing to another Mac.\n\nIf you can try one of these (or, better yet, all three of these!) for a week or more, it would be good data to know if the panics continue or stop.\n", "Q: Disabling wifi password sync between Apple TV and iPhone I'm in an environment with a wireless network that has a different WPA key for each user. My Apple TV and my phone have different passwords, but they seem to insist on syncing between themselves. The end result is I have to keep re-entering passwords on one or the other device. Both devices are on the same Apple ID.\nI've looked through all the settings and can't find anything, but is there any way to stop this password sharing between devices?\n\nA: You need to disable Keychain sync.\nThis will affect all keychain items; you can't selectively choose which items will sync.\nOn the Mac, it's System Prefs > iCloud > Keychain\niOS is Settings > [Your name] > iCloud > Keychain\nIn all honesty, I'd avoid this. Change a password on any web site & you'll have to manually change it on every device that needs to access the same resource; or prevent passwords from being saved entirely.\nThe other thing to perhaps consider is that WPA already uses a different (pairwise) key per device, even if it shares the same password (PSK). Adding one password per device is no more secure, at consumer-level, merely more difficult to admin.\n", "Q: How can I debug a user LaunchAgent that doesn't seem to start or load with launchctl? Problem Description\nRunning the following user LaunchAgent does not show a started job, nor does the job log an error or do anything detectable. The Vault commands embedded in the plist file work fine when run from a user crontab or the command line, though. I've run the following commands as a non-root user:\n# returns exit status 3\nlaunchctl start local.localhost.RenewVaultToken.plist\necho $?\n\n# also returns exit status 3\nlaunchctl enable gui/$UID/local.localhost.RenewVaultToken\nlaunchctl start gui/$UID/local.localhost.RenewVaultToken\necho $?\n\n# returns \"Load failed: 5: Input/output error\"\nlaunchctl load gui/$UID/local.localhost.RenewVaultToken\n\n# no results\nlaunchctl list | fgrep -i vault\n\nTailing the system log doesn't show anything identifiable, nor are any log files created. As far as I can tell, the job can't/won't start or run, but I'm not sure how to effectively debug it further.\nLaunchAgent File Contents\nI have the following file stored in ~/Library/LaunchAgents with the filename local.localhost.RenewVaultToken.plist.

I have around 1700 photos that I've discovered are missing from my iCloud storage.  (These are family/baby photos that we desperately don't want to lose.)\nWhen I try to download the photos from iCloud to Photos I get the following error:\n\nI can see full-screen thumbnails in the Photos app (and they mostly look to be a decent resolution) but when trying to export/share the file it must be looking for the original and gives this error:\n\nIs there any way to export the thumbnails from the Photos app?  I've had a look through the SQLite database file and can't see any blob data that could be thumbnails, although I may have missed it.\nI'm hoping someone has a better idea than just taking screenshots of each photo individually, which is the only option I can think of right now.\n\nA: Unfortunately you are looking in the wrong place.\nBy default the Photos.app (macOS Catalina) stores everything in redundantly named \"Photos Library.photoslibrary\" usually kept in the ~/Pictures folder.\nIf you right(or control) click on the .photoslibrary file and select Show Package Contents it will open a new finder window. I have my Finder set to display columns but the thumbnails are all stored in one place:\n\nOnce inside the .photoslibrary package file they are in:\niPod Photo Cache/FXX/T####.thmb\nAs above. There are not real big or very high resolution but they are something.\n\nA: To add to the above answer: In Catalina and later, the unmodified original versions of photos and videos can be found in the Originals folder. The lower resolution versions are in the Resources folder, within 'Renders' and 'Derivatives' sub-folders. Finding specific photos is a bit difficult since the images are seemingly randomly stored in folders named A, B, C...1, 2, 3 etc. and their original file names (e.g. IMG6407.JPG etc.) are also changed to long character strings.

(Wondering if something might be overdriving the input preamp past an absolute maximum rating...)\n\nUPDATE:\n\nYes I did check speakers before migrating. They worked.\n\nThis is a very important piece of data - it rules out hardware as being at fault. So now we’re solely focusing on what pieces of software in your migration caused this regression.\nWe can do this a few ways:\n\n*\n\n*Create a new user account, reboot, log in with the new account first, and check your audio. This won’t help unless the cause is a user-specific misconfiguration.\n\n*You can try uninstalling one audio app at a time. This won’t help if the uninstaller of the offending software doesn’t do a thorough cleanup.\n\n*Reformat and reinstall the OS but do not migrate. Instead, install your audio software, one app at a time, until you see the failure. This is the most reliable (and most time-consuming) path towards root cause.\n\nThe ioreg command requires Xcode to be installed. If you don’t want to install it (understandably so), you can download IOJones and use its filter bar to search for AppleHDAEngineInput and AppleHDAEngineOutput.\n", "Q: Macbook crashed, need help finding out why I was running Football Manager 2020 with Spotify playing in the background and Firefox was running as well.\nMac suddenly crashed (cursor doesn't move) and audio starts looping – went on for a good 5-10 seconds?

At some point, one of the compressed page table entries (PTEs) became corrupted. The kernel attempted to repair this corruption but was unable and so it rightly induced a panic rather than allowing the OS to continue running in an inconsistent state.\nMemory corruption can happen for a great deal of reasons, including software bugs, hardware bugs, and even cosmic rays occasionally knocking out enough electrons in your DRAM to flip a bit. In order to further debug corruption, we would need to have a core dump from the time of failure. Short of that, there’s no way to begin to discern between the above three possibilities.\nWhat this means for you is: Don’t worry about it too much if this is a one-off event. If, however, you begin to see panics and hangs more regularly (especially if you try repeating the same workload) then that is good data to collect.\n(All that being said: Make sure that you always maintain an ongoing backup of your data. While rare, memory corruption can indicate an incipient hardware failure that may render your machine unusable.

The folders have been refilled just fine during update to Big Sur, but renaming, and hence presumably also deleting, is problematic.

Attempting xcodebuild -license gives Agreeing to the Xcode/iOS license requires admin privileges, please run “sudo xcodebuild -license” and then retry this command.\n\nA: No, I wouldn't recommend using that method. At the same time, you're risking deleting too much, and not actually deleting the whole thing.\nFor quite some time now, Xcode can actually be uninstalled simply by dragging the Xcode app from the Applications folder and into the Trash. This will quite significantly delete most of its footprint.\nOn older systems, you could also open a Terminal and run the following command to uninstall Xcode developer tools:\nsudo /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools –mode=all\n\n\nA: These days, yes (almost).

It works very well, but sometimes I want to point to something on the screen.\nWhat I would like is for something visible - like a circle - to appear whenever I touch the screen with my finger. Is there an app or some kind of setting that will do this? I think I've seen something like this in screen-captured videos before, so I think it's possible.\nI have seen a few pages like this one that say you can do this by enabling \"AssitiveTouch\" and creating a custom gesture, but that really doesn't work very well. (When it's turned on the app can't receive any gestures other than a single tap, so you have to turn it off in order to draw on the screen, then turn it on to point at what you just drew, turn it off to scroll, turn it on again, etc.) So I'm looking for a different solution, other than AssistiveTouch.\nIn case it makes a difference, I should mention that I'm using Zoom on my Macbook rather than the iPad, and sharing the iPad screen via the USB cable.\n(Note: there is a similar question from 2018, but that question is specifically about recording a user's interactions with the device for development purposes. The link in the only answer is broken, but is it's this app it's really quite specific to web development - it wouldn't work for my issue.)\n\nA: As far as I know, doing this in the way you say, seems to be impossible (thats not to say it might not be changed).\n\n\nI think I've seen something like this in screen-captured videos before, so I think it's possible.\n\nThis was almost certainly on an Android device, where there is a system setting to enable visual presses.

This monitor has the same maximum resolution as the internal display of the Mac. This means Mac supports the maximum resolution of Monitor.\nWhen connecting monitor to your Mac, thunderbolt will not be used. The Mac has the ability to determine if the mini displayPort is being used for video or being used for thunderbolt data transfers.\n", "Q: Hidden Python- and R-files: Safe to delete? I am running macOS Catalina 10.15.7 on a 2020 MacBook Pro. I do a bit of programming in R and Python, and in my home directory I saw a bunch of hidden files:\n\nThere are files related to .python_history, .r, .rstudio-desktop, .jupyter, ipython etc. I'm not sure why they are placed here - is it safe to delete these files?\n\nA: Many cross-platform software packages adopt a convention of keeping configuration and data in dot-files/directories inside your home folder. Most of the time this behavior is not configurable and if you remove these then you’re likely to lose some or all of your configuration and/or data for these programs.\nAs @nohillside mentions, these are already hidden both in the Finder and at the shell prompt by default. The only reason to be concerned about tidiness is if you’re worried about other users on your system being able to read and/or write these files. The default umask on macOS is 022 which means that new files and folders are, by default, world-readable. If this is a concern, you should manually set the permissions of all dot-items in your home directory (e.g., chmod go-rwx ~/.*). (You can also set your default umask to something more restrictive, like 077, by adding such a command to your .zprofile.)\n", "Q: Mac Automator: combine images in PDF and resize I not too familiar with Automator for Mac. I am trying to create a quick action to combine several images in a single PDF file and reduce its size with a quartz filter. The actions does indeed create the pdf but it does not reduce its file size. This is what I did:\n\nIf I create two separate quick actions (one to create the pdf from images and another one to reduce the size of a pdf file) and apply them sequentially they work correctly. But not combined into a single action. What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: I think the problem is that Automator passes the incoming files to each action in turn. It doesn't pass the created PDF file in the first action to the 2nd action.\nSo you need to add a \"Get Specified Finder Items\" action to 'get' the PDF that you've just created, and pass it through the workflow.\nOf course, none of this addresses the problem of the fixed name and location of the finished PDF.\nI have written python scripts to be used in Automator workflows, which individually convert images to PDF and apply Quartz Filters (saving the file in the same folder with a unique name); it wouldn't be too difficult to modify them to do both.\nhttps://github.com/benwiggy/PDFsuite/tree/master/Automator_Scripts\n\nA: Actually I do not think the problem is that Automator passes the incoming files to each action in turn. If I try to change the names of the off file after creating it, or move file, Automator does that. There must be another reason why it does not resize the pdf file immediately after creating it\n", "Q: Does Google access my iCloud email through Gmail app If I use the Gmail iPhone and iPad apps for my iCloud email, can Google access my iCloud email that is shown in the Gmail app?\nDo they and can they?\n\nA: If you enter your iCloud password into any app or code (including safari or Apple OS devices), it surely can act on your behalf. Whether that app saves the password securely or not or retransmits any or all of the data or has a switch or timer to enable this periodically is a lot harder to discern.\n", "Q: Kali Linux bootable USB not showing up in boot menu I am using a 2018 MBA running Big Sur\nI wanted to create a persistent bootable USB with Kali Linux and have followed the exact instructions as given in this article: https://medium.com/macoclock/install-kali-linux-live-usb-with-persistence-using-macos-b1574c996491\nHowever after powering on and pressing the option key, the bootable USB does not show up.

-128 is a catch-all shutdown cause in SMC. It’s unfortunately not specific enough to suggest a particular line of investigation. From experience, a couple of things to look for would be:\n\n*\n\n*Poor battery health can cause voltage sag under high workload and leads to a brownout. Given that you’ve mentioned in chat that this happens under AC power, this is unlikely. This bears reconfirmation so please try running only on AC power for a while to see if the shutdown recurs.\n\n*The GPU, especially the discrete GPU, has sometimes been at the root cause. Chrome is an inefficient piece of code and is likely causing utilization spikes. The may force frequent switching between integrated and discrete graphics on systems with discrete GPUs, which yours has. It’s possible that this trips a race condition in the GPU MUX. We can disable the switching by forcing DG always on: Use the Energy Saver system preference pane to disable “Automatic graphics switching”.\n\n*By the same token as #2, we can disable accelerated graphics entirely. This requires either running in Safe Mode (Shift on boot) or using a third-party utility, such as gfxCardStatus. Now, I don’t use Chrome myself (and I strongly urge others not to, for reasons of performance, stability, security, and privacy) but I did come across this answer that would be a good switch to toggle as part of your experiment.\n\n", "Q: Music Library Seems Broken Recently, I noticed whenever I try to open my Music library, I get the following error message:\n\nThe file \"Application.musicdb\" cannot be read because it does not\nappear to be a valid library file.\n\nThe app continues to work however but things are a bit slow. And I tried to look into the library file, by clicking on \"show package contents\" and I can see the mentioned file inside the library but the last modified date shows a couple of weeks back. And I can see more than ~400 temp files (Temp File 1.tmp and so on) are created over the course of the past two weeks, the last one belonging to a few minutes ago. It seems that all the recent modifications are happening via these temp files and the original file, which the app complains about at the start, hasn't been updated.\nWhat can I do to fix this? Is there a proper way to force it to recreate that file or something?\nI'm using the latest version of the OS and the Music app and I keep my music library on an external hard drive.\n\nA: I managed to fix the issue by replacing the problematic file with another one from another music library.\nI asked the Music app to create a new library (by holding the option key while opening the app). I have an Apple Music subscription and I have my music files uploaded to the cloud. I looked into the library file by clicking on \"show package contents\" and then copied Application.musicdb (the file that causes the issue in my main library ) into my main library to replace the problematic file. Then I closed the Music app and opened my main library and everything worked fine. I also deleted all the temp files and the app has been working fine since then.\nHope this helps others with the same problem.\n\nA: Sometimes simple reboot of your mac can help too (I had the same issue on 12.4).\n", "Q: Updated to Big Sur and find -exec results in permission denied I have recently updated to Big Sur from Mojave (not willingly). I have tried to copy a bunch of pdfs in Terminal using the command:\nfind . -name \"*_20*.pdf\" -exec {} ~/Desktop/. \\;\n\nbut it results in \"permission denied\". This command used to work before and indeed I can execute\ncp my_fav_file_2010.pdf ~/Desktop\n\nwithout a problem.\nTerminal and iTerm are added to have \"Full Disk Access\" in the Privacy and Security Preferences. I even reached into /usr/bin and added find and zsh from /bin/ to the list, but it still gives me \"permission denied\". Any tips what is going on and how to fix this?\nkJ\n\nA: The problem is with your find invocation:\n\nfind . -name \"*_20*.pdf\" -exec {} ~/Desktop/. \\;\n\nIf your PDF was named “Foo_20.pdf” then when find matched it it would attempt to run Foo_20.pdf ~/Desktop/. which is an attempt to execute the PDF as if it were an executable, and of course because it’s not (specifically, because it lacks the +x file permission) you get a permission denied error.\nYour command is missing a cp invocation:\nfind . -name \"*_20*.pdf\" -exec cp {} ~/Desktop/. \\;\n\n", "Q: how to bind double tapping the shift key in tmux i spent some time yesterday trying to figure out how i can bind a double tap -esque key binding for tmux, and made some progress, but still incomplete.\ni am hoping to maximize/minimize a pane within a tmux window by double tapping the shift key. even better if i can granularly map it to the left shift key and have double tapping the right shift key perform a different key binding.\nwhile doing some research on how to do this i came across this unix/linux stackexchange q&a. the person who asked that question is essentially asking the same thing i am but on a gnu+linux platform and not a darwin+bsd platform ie. macos.\nin that unix/linux q&a the op who provides the accepted answer recommends using xcape to map a custom binding for xterm (if i understand correctly), and i believe xcape is tied to X11 window manager, and i'm using Alacritty as my terminal emu along with Aqua as my desktop environment, so i don't believe using xcape is a viable solution on macos.  i am aware of karabiner-elements for setting custom key mappings on macos, which i have done for several keys, but i don't think i'd have to set that up (but could be wrong) as this binding is specific to my term emu.\nit seems either my tmux mappings are not correct or alacritty is not passing the mapping to tmux in order to perform the mapping. this is where things get confusing for me.\na couple of things i have tried within my tmux.conf\nset-option prefix2 \"f11\" # WORK!!!\nbind-key \"f11\" resize-pane -Z # double tap f11 (requires holding fn key on mbp keyboard)\n\nwhen i set the prefix2 with the below setting\nset-option prefix2 \"C-S-M\"\nbind C-S-M display \"ctrl+shift+meta pressed\"\n\ni do not see the message flashed within my tmux status bar.\ni have other key bindings in tmux that use the shift key with arrow keys, so i know it's not a problem with the shift key, so i'm confused as to which program i don't have configured properly.\ni have my alacritty.yml config file hosted within my dotfiles repo, and my tmux.conf is hosted within the same repo but i have pasted the important parts above. please excuse my ignorance if i'm forgetting something trivial.\n\nA: Binding C-S-M won't work for two reasons. Firstly there is no key S-M - M is already shifted. Secondly, there is are no uppercase control keys. See https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Modifier-Keys#limitations-of-ctrl-keys.\nYour best bet for keys that the terminal cannot send are to map them to a key that the terminal can send (like F11 or C-F2) using xbindkeys or similar program.\nYou don't need to change prefix to make double pressing a key work, you can do it with key tables, for example something like:\nbind -Tmytable F11 lsk\nbind -Troot F11 switchc -Tmytable\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to update iPhone running iOS 13.5.1 to 13.7 not 14.4?

Is there an app I could use to transfer them to my computer?  I've had good luck with iMazing, but it costs quite a bit.  I would prefer to do this for free if possible.\nThanks!\n\nA: Doing it over USB is incredibly difficult, I've had those same issues where it won't transfer more than a few at a time.  In fact, I've been having that issue since way back when I owned an iPhone 4S ten years ago.\nUsing something like Readdle's Documents app or something like LanDrop works well for transferring media over the web.  There are lots of options for doing it that way.\nBut, if you're transferring a lot of files at once and prefer to do it via lightning cable connection, SanDisk's iXpand Drive is really great.  It's basically a flash drive you plug into your phone via lightning, and it can quickly copy lots of media at once.

In the past, I know that there was a procedure that allowed one to delete an iOS application from an iPhone and then restore on that iPhone the version of the application that is stored on a backup.  This is quite handy when you've upgraded to a new version of an iOS app only to find it behaves worse than the version you already were using before the upgrade.\nI have made use of this, so I know that it was possible at least at one time.\nClarifications about how this is not certain other questions:\nNo, I am not asking whether one can get older versions of an app from the App Store.\nNo, I am not asking about restoring just the associated data for a single application.  (And if one can only get the stored version of the application without stored data, then I'd be welcome at least that much.)\nNo, I don't want to reset all the applications and data or go back to the entirety of a backup.\nYes I do want to get back the earlier/older version of a particular iOS app that has been on my phone.  I do remember that the process started with deleting the new version of the app off the iPhone.  The result is that the app is Not on My iPhone.  Then the process went on to restore that app from the local backup.\nI'm running Big Sur 11.1 on a MacBook Pro with an iPhone 7 running iOS 14.2. The last backup is stored on the MacBook Pro (not on iCloud).\nIf this is no longer possible with Big Sur, then (as in the Title) my question becomes \"What changed and when did it change so that it became no longer possible?\"  Since I've done it before, I know that it used to be possible.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: iTunes 12.6.5.3 was the last version that had the ability to download apps.\nOn September 12, 2018 Apple released iTunes 12.7.0.166 which removed the built-in App Store browser and thus the supported ability to store downloaded copies of apps on the machine that iTunes is running on.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_iTunes\nSee also the article (and comments for) Apple Releases iTunes 12.7 With Major Changes, Including No Built-In App Store\nIf you want to do this today, you need to archive the older version of said app BEFORE you want to restore it. You can do this with a tool like iMazing, that allows you to maintain a local library of apps that are installed on an iOS device.\nCaveat: You must download the app to the local library while it is still available from the MAS. There is no way to retrieve it from the iOS device.\n", "Q: Why does my terminal show % instead of $? (macOS Big Sur) I'm starting to learn python and I've been having to use my terminal a bit; however, all tutorials I have found online show the login info and input symbol as user-macbook:~name$, as well as inserting $ for running commands. However, my terminal displays user@Macbook-Air ~ %, and the usage of $ is not computed.

When I'm using Chrome browser sometimes two icons appear in the dock.  I know the one with dot (left) but what is the one with Mac icon (right)?  The right one just disappears if I click on it.  If I don't do anything the icon (right) will disappear after awhile.\nI think this is handoff feature.\n\n*\n\n*How do I know which device is sending the handoff to my Mac?\n\n*Can it be security hole if I click on it?\n\n*Since someone can send it to my Mac, can my mac accidentally send the handoff to other device? i.e. I'm concerned if the two or more devices are allowed to communicate bidirectionally.\n\n\n\nA: Yes, the icon you see on the right is Handoff from another computer that you are signed into and are near. That computer has a window open in a web browser. (I'm assuming you have Chrome as your default browser)\nYou can ignore it if you want, or select it to \"hand off\" what you are doing on the other computer to this current one.\nTo answer your questions;\n\n*\n\n*The icon that you see there usually shows what device is \"handing off\" from. In this case, it's a desktop, not a mobile device.\n\n*Unless someone is using your computer without you knowing, it's probably not a security issue. This only is shared between computers that are signed in with the same iCloud account.\n\n*Someone can Airdrop something to you, but you have to agree to it. Airdropping from a computer that are are signed into with your iCloud account to another computer, also signed in with the same iCloud account, can just transfer files without asking. No third party can just send, or push, something to you without you agreeing to it.\n\nI hope this helps!\n", "Q: What is Containers/com.apple.mail suppose to look like? My three-month-old MacBook Pro was upgraded to Big Sur as soon as it arrived, before migrating in accounts and apps from the old one.\nIt has since had several seemingly unrelated problems that do not seem to be hardware issues.  None of them happened on the old laptop with Catalina.\nThe worst is with Mail.app.  ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail has no extended attributes, and no ACL.  Finder will not let me see its contents (and no bypass on the contextual menu), but Terminal says I own it and the permissions are 776.  It contains only a Data folder and a plist.  The Data folder contains symlinks to several of the directories in ~.  And if I open Data in Finder, Finder changes \"com.apple.mail\" to \"Mail\" in the path.\nI’ve been told it is not supposed to look like that.  But my oldest backup is more than six months old from the previous machine (which had Catalina), and it never had any of these problems.  I still have that machine, so tonight I charged it and looked, and verified that Time Machine is not lying to me.\nThat's why I'm asking. If your Big Sur is behaving well, do you have a similar ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail or is it very different?\n\nA: The short answer is yes, I believe your ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail is what it is supposed to be.\nJust like you, I do have ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail which Finder presents as one of 6 subfolders called Mail.  Mine has permissions like yours and same content including all the symlinks.\nSo don't worry, everything is (most likely) just as it is supposed to be.\nThe more worrying answer is that Apple Support staff mostly do not have the faintest idea about the changes in Big Sur.  I have come across other reports where Apple Support seems to be reading from their Catalina support notes.\n", "Q: How to find all Sun Sat on command line This works on Ubuntu but not on Mac.\n$ seq -f %1.0f 20210101 20211231 | date -f - 2>/dev/null | grep 'Sun\\|Sat'\n...\nSat Dec 18 00:00:00 JST 2021\nSun Dec 19 00:00:00 JST 2021\nSat Dec 25 00:00:00 JST 2021\nSun Dec 26 00:00:00 JST 2021\n\nHow to find all Sat and Sun from command line?\n\nA: The macOS/BSD version of date can't read from standard input so you need to loop manually.\nfor d in $(seq -f %1.0f 20210101 20211231); do \n    date -jf \"%Y%m%d\" $d 2>/dev/null | grep 'Sat\\|Sun'\ndone\n\nYou can avoid most of the impossible dates created by seq (and get the result faster) by running\nfor m in {01..12}; do\n    for d in {01..31}; do\n        date -jf \"%Y%m%d\" \"2021${m}${d}\" 2>/dev/null\n    done\ndone | grep 'Sat\\|Sun'\n\n", "Q: Reinstalling Mac OSX Lion on Locked Disk I have a 2011 vintage MacBook Pro which is not booting at all.

Your edits are super helpful to come up with next steps.\nI would use the command line and try this in the terminal app.\nsudo softwareupdate --all --install\n\nYou will be prompted to enter your password and if that accepts your password and starts to download and install the updates, you know it’s just a GUI account issue.\nIf you don’t like the command line, another path is to make a second admin user and log out of the problem user (Apple menu - log out) and then try the update from the second account. Either way, you can reduce the potential causes and maybe get your update done, too.\nI get the same prompt, but it works for me today when yesterday I got password errors and I changed nothing.

I realised it happens when I try to reveal a folder which lies in ~/Documents/. Revealing a folder somewhere else, eg ~/Music/iTunes works like a charm. But something like ~/Documents/foo/ falls back to ~/.\nIt might have happened for the first time after a system update, a few weeks/months ago. I am currently running macOS 11.2.1.\nI suspected privacy privileges, and I reset them with tccutil reset All but it hasn't changed anything.\nInterestingly, it seems like I'm not able to change the permissions of ~/Documents/, while it is possible for other folders (see example below).\n Permission management is missing for ~/Documents (left), but is there for ~/Music (right)\nDoes anyone have an idea to explain this behaviour, and how to solve it? I'll be much grateful for any hint.\nEdit 2021-02-15\nOut of the blue, I tried something. I used the action Reveal in Finder of Alfred on a folder in ~/Documents/. It worked, and, since that, so does opening folders from a Spotlight search. It must have done something backstage, but I have no idea what. ¯_(ツ)_/¯\nEdit 2022-07-24\nSee the answer from @junjie below for the real cause of the problem and a workaround.\n\nA: I've figured out the problem. Looks like it had nothing to do with permissions of the Documents folder. The problem seemed to be related to the use of Column view in Finder. If you switch the view of Finder to the List view, Show in Finder/Reveal in Finder will work properly for files in the Documents folder. Hat tip to the Alfred team for discovering this workaround.\n\n\nA: There are two questions here:\nFirstly, Spotlight always sending you to ~/ (and not the folder you asked for) is I believe a bug.\nUpdate: I have a MacBook running macOS 11.3 beta1. On this the search behaves correctly and Finder opens in the expected folder.  So, it seems this bug is being fixed.\nSecondly, my interpretation of permissions for ~/Documents is that Big Sur has taken control of the Documents folder and won't let you make changes.  Unix style permissions and ACLs are overruled by macOS.\nThere is other evidence for the special role of ~/Documents.  Finder now shows subfolders that are not really inside the Documents folder.  These are folders belonging to some apps using iCloud for document storage.\nThere seems to be no way of turning back the clock and restoring the behaviour of Catalina and older.  This is just an example of Apple gradually taking away the freedoms we have come to love in macOS.\n\nA: I encountered the same bug since macOS 11.2 or maybe earlier. Spotlight list results but won't reveal any file in ~/Documents, it always open ~/ folder instead. It annoyed me a lot.\nThe first workaround I tried was to create a new folder ~/Docs, and move everything from ~/Documents into, it works well but not perfect though.\nI believe some core services must be doing little dirty stuff to \"overrulled\" Unix file system as Gilby replied. iCloud Drive become No.1 suspect in my mind. Just go to: System Preference > Internet Accounts > iCloud > check iCloud Drive > Options, check \"Desktop & Documents Folders\" and uncheck again to turn it on and off manually. Wola! The ~/Documents folder now displayed as \"Documents - Local\" in Finder (as well as ~/Desktop), and revealing in Spotlight works again finally!\nPS: It's recommended to empty both Desktop and Documents folder first, thus no time wasted on syncing several GB files with iCloud.\n\nA: The iCloud option for me only worked once then it stopped working again for ~/Documents folder.\nI encounter this issue first from terminal, IntelliJ and VSCode (using open command in terminal and reveal option in these editors)\nfor example using open -R ~/Documents/path/to/folder or open ~/Documents/path/to/folder/file won't open these in Finder but would Finder at this ~/ path and this happens only when the files are in ~/Documents and in columns mode weirdly it works okay in list mode\nanyway the fix that worked for me, is to add ~/Document folder to the sidebar   and then it works fine but the minute you remove ~/Document folder from the sidebar it stops working again, not sure why this is the case\nAgain: add the Documents folder to the sidebar/favourites for the fix\n", "Q: Installing HomeBrew `.app` on M1 I am using MBA M1 with macOS Big Sur v11.2.1.\nRecently discovered that the program mpv is now available natively for M1 macs through brew. When I do brew install mpv then mpv is surely installed and it is indeed native to M1. But the problem is that there is no .app for it and everytime I want to run a video I have to necessarily open terminal and do mpv \\path\\ to\\ file which I want to avoid. So, searching around I found that the new way to do this is to use the --cask option. But when I do an install using the said option, mpv is the Intel version.\nHow do I get the native version to work as a regular app? As I understand it, cask option is merely combining all the files into an .app format and it should not really affect anything. In fact, one should be able to do this fairly easily, without using cask, given the right kind of information. Please help me get this working.\n\nA: Your last point of cask combining the files misses one key step. Someone else has to do the work to assemble and package that app. Homebrew doesn't do that assembly automagically.\nI've installed mpv on three machines and your results are the same as I get - Intel Big Sur has a cask, M1 does not. Both get the command line binary.\nUnless and until someone sends a pull request to add an M1 version of the cask for this package, you'll want to use a different tool or installation method.\n", "Q: Update applied by hand, how to tell App Store app? Net is slow at my home, really slow. It would have taken a week to get Xcode 12.4, so instead I got the package from Apple onto my laptop elsewhere, brought it home, transferred it over, and installed it. Worked great, I'm currently using it.\nBut the App Store app thinks it still needs to be updated. Is there a way to tell it what's up?\n\nA: If it’s working I would leave it be until the next update. Fiddling with a signed app can make it not run.\nI would recommend getting content caching on your slow network. You can even take that storage and Mac to a fast network to get the App Store apps cached to an external disk and bring that cache back to the slow network. Subsequently  when you update at home, the update comes from your local network cache and not Apple.

You could either use the space to install Linux or you could add this space to the APFS container. The command to add the space to the container is given below.\nsudo diskutil apfs resizecontainer disk0s2 0\n\nIf you want to use the free space to install Linux, then nothing needs to be done from macOS. You will need to allocate the free space for Linux partitions when you run the Linux installer.\nYou might consider booting to macOS Recover and posting the output from the command below. This command will not change your computer. The output will give a better idea if the drive was cloned correctly.\ngpt -r show /dev/disk0\n\nUpdate\nIf you enter the command diskutil apfs resizecontainer, the following documentation is produced.\nUsage:  diskutil APFS resizeContainer <inputDisk> limits [-plist]\n        diskutil APFS resizeContainer <inputDisk> <newSize> [<triple>*]\n        where <inputDisk> = A Container Reference DiskIdentifier (preferred)\n              or a Physical Store DiskIdentifier\n              <newSize> = the desired new Container or Physical Store size\n              <triple> = a { fileSystemPersonality, name, size } tuple\nResize an APFS Container. One of the Container's Physical Store disks will be\nresized, and therefore the Container which it defines will be resized by an\nequal amount. You do this by specifying a new Container size; to preview the\ncurrent available range, you can instead specify \"limits\"; no change will be\nmade. A new size of zero is taken as a request to do a grow-to-fit operation.\nIf the new size implies a shrink, you can specify ordered triples in the same\nmanner as `diskutil partitionDisk`, etc, to fill the partition map's free\nspace gap that would otherwise result. If there is more than one Physical Store\nand you specify a Container Reference, the appropriate Physical Store will be\nchosen automatically. Ownership of the affected disks is required, and all of\nthe Container's Volumes must be unencrypted or unlocked.\nExample:  diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk5 110g\n          diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 110g\n          diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk5 0\n          diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk5 1.5t jhfs+ foo 10g ms-dos BAR 0\n\nIn your case, your APFS container only has one physical store disk with identifier disk0s2.\nThe output from the gpt -r show /dev/disk0 command shows there is a block containing 48,8376,007 sectors of free space. This is 48,8376,007 sectors x 512 bytes/sector = 250,048,515,584 bytes of free space.\n \n", "Q: Folder Action to Convert Image Format after AirDrop?

Has anyone written an alternative client in a faster language like C or Go?\n\nA: As far as I know, there exist no other implementations of HomeBrew than the standard one.\nI doubt that the main cause of any wait times is due to the fact that it is programmed in Ruby. Such a program does not \"magically\" become faster just by being implemented in C. It is of course fully possible for other implementations to be faster, however one could also fear that for example an implementation in C would be more prone to security bugs.\n", "Q: Dock Dual Thunderbolt 2 Laptops with dual HDMI out / dual screen sharing? I have a 2013 Macbook Pro and a 2015 Macbook Air. The MBP has a busted screen but works fine otherwise, it has two Thunderbolt 2 ports. The Air is fully functional, it has one Thunderbolt 2 port.\nI like to make electronic music. I have some stuff on one Mac and some on the other. I have two displays I want to use. One is a older LG Flatron with HDMI input, the other is a 4K UHD smart TV. I also own a 2TB Time Capsule.\nIn my head I'm thinking of a setup with the MBP is always docked, maybe closed if possible, always using the two displays, and a Bluetooth keyboard and trackpad controlling it or both. Then I could just add the Air to the docking station whenever I wanted to and share files and monitors.\nI was thinking I could use one for like VST and plugins and the other for my DAW host software. That way I could get the most computing power possible. I’m not sure if that's possible.\nFor a minute I was looking into DANTE or AVB but then that wouldn't solve my dual display needs.\nI thought there has to be a dock that I can hook up both laptops to via Thunderbolt 2 and share data at high speed, with 2 HDMI outputs that I can also share between the computers. But so far I'm not finding anything. All I can find are dual monitor switches for mini DisplayPort or Thunderbolt 3 / USB 3.1 docks with dual display but no dual HDMI. (I don't need to power the screens with HDMI).\nSo, I'm needing some help! I would like the added ports that a dock offers, I would like to quickly file share from laptop to laptop, and i would like to be able to, if possible, share dual external screens for editing and etc.\nDoes anyone know how Ican accomplish this?\n\nA: A dock built to accommodate two hosts will be rare to non-existent.  One reason is few people will want such a thing, and companies build devices for sale that they believe will bring a return on their investment, and another is that how such a dock should behave will be difficult to define, which makes the required investment in building such a dock quite high.\nWhat you are likely going to have to do is build the dock you are looking for from more basic components.  Perhaps a dock for each laptop and a KVM switch to flip the displays between the two computers.\nThere are software solutions that mimic the function of a hardware KVM, and these may be attractive for you on cost and/or convenience grounds.\nSharing data at high bandwidth will be rather trivial with a Thunderbolt cable between the two.  A quick check of the specs on the two laptops tells me that driving what I assume to be two 4K displays may be too much for either computer to handle on it's own.  To do this might mean driving one display from each laptop or adding an external GPU.  Swapping the eGPU between computers is not likely to be trivial, you may have to pick which computer is driving the screens or have a separate eGPU for each computer.\nYou may not need a dock, or perhaps not need any additional hardware.  What you need to do is define your goals more clearly and create your two computer system to match.\nHere's one idea.  The MacBook Pro can be \"permanently docked\" and have the two displays connected.  The Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, and any other user input devices, also connected to the MacBook Pro.  When you need to add in the MacBook Air then it would be connected to the MacBook Pro by a Thunderbolt cable.  The Thunderbolt cable will provide a high bandwidth network between the two computers.  Using a screen sharing program between the two computers you will be able to control the MacBook Air from the MacBook Pro.\nHow the screen sharing (effectively a virtual/software KVM switch) works with the MacBook Air will depend on the specific software used and it's intended behavior.  To have the MacBook Air \"see\" the two screens on the MacBook Pro will likely require \"dummy displays\" to work.  These \"dummy displays\" are video port dongles that will hang off the MacBook Air which will look like an attached display to the computer but have no real screen.\nSharing two high resolution screens will take a lot of bandwidth, even by Thunderbolt standards.  Sharing data over this same network connection will take even more bandwidth.  Spreading this out by using WiFi or some other networking connection will help in resolving what I anticipate to be a bandwidth bottleneck.  Using a hardware KVM instead of a software KVM will mean not relying on a network to move the data for two 4K screens but dual 4K display KVM switches will not be cheap.\nBuying the docks, KVM switches (hardware or software), and cables to make this work might end up being a considerable investment.  So much of an investment that it may make more sense to just buy a new computer to replace the two you have.\n\nA: I don't know of any dock that will support two laptops at the same time.\nI have two suggestions:\n\n*\n\n*Use the Pro most of the time, have an external drive attached to the dock for file sharing. Shut down the Pro unplug the thunderbolt cable connecting it to the dock and plug in the Air when you need to. File transfer from the external drive through the dock should be fast.\n\n\n*Assuming that a thunderbolt dock will have gigabit ethernet, use ethernet cables, hub, and a dongle to the air to network between the pro and the air.\n\nA: You need a Thunderbolt 2 KVM Docking station like this product here:\nhttps://www.aten.com/global/en/products/usb-&-thunderbolt/docking-switches/us7220/\nIt allows you to connect display, mouse, keyboards and other things (such as USB connected musical instruments or DACs) to the dock. Both computers are connected to the dock, and you can then switch between which of the two computers gets to use the peripherals using the buttons on top of the dock.\nYou wrote that you have a Bluetooth keyboard. It can become a hassle as that won't automatically switch over when you press the button (as it is not connected to the dock). I would advise using a cabled keyboard instead (if it is an Apple bluetooth keyboard, you can just connect a cable to it) - or possibly using a USB-Bluetooth dongle that is plugged into the dock for connecting it.\nThe dock has a HDMI port that goes well with your older LG monitor with HDMI input. The dock also has a Thunderbolt port which you can use to connect a Thunderbolt monitor at the same time.\nNOTE: This particular dock does not support outputting HDMI signal AND mini-DisplayPort signal (display connected to the Thunderbolt port) at the same time. In order for twin displays to work this way, one needs to be a Thunderbolt display.\n\nA: The system bumped this question and in that time product offerings have changed which means I offer an alternate answer.  The answer I gave earlier was the best advice I had at the time, and to some extent is still good advice today.  This is an attempt to offer an answer that is not only more up to date but also simpler and less wordy.\nOption One:\nThunderbolt 2 devices today are rare and when you can find them are quite expensive, which no doubt has something to do with the rarity.  Now one is likely going to have to buy Thunderbolt 3 devices and an adapter for Thunderbolt 2.  To share two HDMI screens with two computers with Thunderbolt 2 ports would mean getting two Thunderbolt 3 docks, two Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapters, and a dual HDMI KVM switch.  Then to share files between the computers would mean docks that have Ethernet and connecting those ports by an Ethernet cable, or providing a data path between the computers separate from the dock.  That means buying Ethernet adapters, using peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, or some other kind of hardware.  This collection of hardware could easily cost over $1000.\nOption two:\nBuy a new laptop.  You have a laptop that is getting to be 10 years old and already has a broken display, it's likely to be cheaper to replace the laptop with one more capable than to buy the necessary hardware to overcome it's shortcomings.  This won't remove the need to buy some cables and accessories but this does mean buying adapters off the shelf for $15 than special order items for ten times that price.  This won't exactly solve your screen and file sharing issue with the older laptop(s) but by learning to use the included Apple utilities for screen sharing and file sharing, as well as the built-in Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth, you should find things quite speedy and convenient without additional hardware.  If you do need hardware then, again, it should be common items that are low in price but still high quality and reliable.\nThe first option is certainly viable as it is \"future proof\" in a way by using Thunderbolt 3 docks, which will almost certainly be compatible with a new laptop when the second option inevitably comes.  The cost for this future-proofing is that of the adapters for the old laptops.  Taking the second option now means the obsolescence is averted for the old laptops but will come sooner for whatever replaces them.  Such is life.\n", "Q: How to turn off fireworks on my phone after texting \"Happy New Year\" and any future shenanigans?

I've heard quite a few stories of Big Sur bricking older MacBooks, but I'm not quite sure in which way precisely they get bricked (motherboard or just SSD), so question is whether the following story fits into those reports:\nI have the 13\" MBPR (Early 2015, 2.9 GHz i5) of my 78 year old father here, which is kind of dead after he – if he recalls correctly – performed an update from Big Sur 11.x to Big Sur 11.y (he grabs every update he gets offered, so unfortunately he doesn't pay much attention to the details). Let’s call this MacBook A.\nIt has a 512 GB SSUBX Apple Samsung OEM SSD (Model MZ-JPV5120/0A4). Let’s call this SSD A.\nAfter the update the MacBook doesn’t boot up properly anymore: Apple logo and progress bar appear, everything looks normal at first, but at 50% the progress bars stalls ... and that’s it. I waited as much as 10 hours, but it doesn't move a single pixel.\nFor cross reference/examination I have another 13\" MBPR (Early 2015, 2.7 GHz i5) with 512 GB SSD running Catalina perfectly fine. Let’s call this MacBook B and SSD B.\nHere’s what I've tried and observed so far:\n\n*\n\n*NVRAM and SMC reset multiple times\n\n*Disconnect/reconnect battery\n\n*Reseat SSD\n\n*Attempted to boot into Safe Mode with Shift key pressed (= same behavior: stalled progress bar)\n\n*Swapping SSDs between the two MacBooks swaps the problem from MacBook A to B (in other words: the faulty MacBook A boots fine with the SSD B running Catalina from MacBook B, but MacBook B has the exact same boot problem with SSD A).\n\n*Apple Hardware Test on MacBook A with SSD B = Runs flawlessly resulting in no problems.\n\n*Apple Hardware Test on MacBook A with misbehaving SSD A = Screen stays forever black, and ends in Globe with exclamation sign and error -2003D (which is a OS recovery http connection issue, nothing which matters in the context).\n\nConclusion up to this point: The MacBook A still is perfectly fine, it’s the SSD A which is f#ck3d up (thanks to the Big Sur update).\nNext ...\n\n*\n\n*Booting with alt key pressed: SSD A is listed as valid startup volume. However...\n\n*Booting into Internet Recovery or\n\n*Booting from Big Sur USB stick drive or\n\n*Booting from Catalina USB stick drive show the exact same behaviour:SSD A does not show up in Disk Utility (View All Devices) and does not show up when trying to installing a fresh Mac OS.diskutil list shows multiple volumes of the 32 GB USB boot stick, but not the SSD A (remember: SSD A gets listed when starting with alt key pressed and boots halfway ... so it is there somehow)\n\n*Booting from a Windows 10 Installer USB Stick does show the SSD (however despite being able to format it somehow, I wasn't able to install Windows, which would have been an attempt to at least gain access again to the SSD A)\n\nI have 30+ years of Mac background, I've seen SSDs biting the dust, but this is nothing I've ever seen before.\nIdeas?\n\n\n\n\n\nA: No. We have that update on several Macs identical to yours. You may have a hardware failure, but it’s not the OS that’s causing it. The OS is hobbled by it no other than needing the next write to succeed, there’s no code in the OS that intentionally breaks storage.\nAs it has been for two decades of Mac OS support, coincidence is more likely than cause, here. It stinks when we get a failure, so no amount of experience lessens that disappointment. Worse, it shakes our confidence when we confront how little we can do in the face of hardware failure.\n\n*\n\n*When you run an upgrade, you change the boot process substantially. This is precisely when you discover hardware isn’t up to snuff and pre-existing storage failures become critical. (This is also the time when minor  storage corruptions turn into data loss.)\n\nSeparating causality from correlation is super tricky outside a repair shop where you have access to known good parts, can reconnect cables, run advanced diagnostics and see trends due to hundreds of repairs a week.\nYour next step is to contact Apple for a service estimate. They may just offer a service program and underwrite the cost of the repair. Worst case, you have a second look at your triage and know one cost for repair.\nIn the mean time, you can try erasing it from several OS, but be sure you keep good backups if you “revive” this Mac.\np.s. this sort of error is precisely how many of our SSD bite the dust.

I realize that Angry Birds 2 is likely an inferior offering filled with dark patterns and ads, but I don't seem to have much choice so here we go.\nOne of the devices is iPad mini MD537E/A. It says it is on 9.3.6. Says it's the latest one for that device. App Store will only install some old version of Angry Birds 2, which will display splash screen, ask to log into gaming center (or whatever) and then tell me that I have to upgrade to newer version. Newer version needs iOS 10.0+. I guess this device is too old and it's end of story here?\nThe other one is iPad Pro 12,9\" 2nd-gen MP6G2RU/A. It is on 14.4, which makes it look like a better prospect. However, this one performs even worse: it will start a splash screen, offer me to log in to gaming center, and then nothing happens. Splash screen just stays here. It never goes further.\nThis iPad previously belonged to a relative and sometimes it pops up a prompt to login into the old account, despite being more or less moved to a new one. Maybe it affects the outcome somehow.\nWhat do I do? How do I actually get some of these devices to play Angry Birds for my daughter?\n\nA: The fact that the newer iPad is still prompting about an old account indicates it was likely never reset after the transfer of ownership.  Even when giving a device to a trusted family member, wiping is always a good idea; the new owner likely doesn't need or want any of the older owner's data.  Wiping it will also likely resolve the issues you're experiencing--and even if it doesn't, it will dramatically narrow down the cause.\nThe caveat is that by wiping it, you will be removing all of your data from the device.  You should back up anything important first.  If your daughter has already been using the device, it may be difficult to guess what needs to be backed up.  Some data, such as game saves, may not be reasonable to back up and restore after wiping.\nIf you decide to go through with wiping it, follow Apple's latest instructions; they tend to change across iOS versions.  As of writing, the process looks roughly like this:\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your device is up-to-date.\n\n*Make sure you've backed up anything you want to save and have a plan for restoring it to the device--I recommend using both a cloud backup and an offline backup via your computer.  If the iCloud account on the device is the previous owner's, then keep in mind that you will lose access to any iCloud backups when you wipe the device.\n\n*\"Go to Settings > [your name] > Find My, tap Find My iPhone, then turn it off.\"  This is important.  Note that [your name] may actually be the previous owner's name.  As of writing, this option is usually at the very top of the Settings page.  It's possible that the device isn't connected to anyone's iCloud account, in which case you'll likely see a prompt to log into iCloud in its place.\n\n*\"Tap Settings > General > Reset\", then tap \"Erase All Content and Settings\"\n\n", "Q: Big Sur: PDF Service shell script cannot call python I recently upgraded from Mohave to Big Sur, and the shell script I use as a PDF Service has stopped working.

When the PDF Service is invoked from the print dialog, /usr/bin/python3 -c 'print(\"Python works\")' will print \"Python works\". /usr/bin/python3 /Library/TeX/texbin/pdfbook2 --inner-margin=80 \"$f\" will begin executing, but pdfbook2 will then throw a PermissionError of \"Operation not permitted\" when it tries to run pdfcrop, which is also in /Library/TeX/texbin.\n\n*The first line of pdfbook2 is #!/usr/bin/env python3. The first line of pdfcrop is #!/usr/bin/env perl, which should find /usr/bin/perl, since there is no Perl in my /usr/local/bin.\n\n*So apparently SIP is preventing PDF Services from execing anything that is not in a protected directory, and from using /usr/bin/env as an interpreter (which could circumvent that restriction). Is there any way to give a script permission to do this? Giving the script Full Disk Access doesn't work.\n\n\nA: I have discovered that Big Sur will graciously allow a script to execute in a PDF Service, if the script is put inside an Automator workflow.\nUse the 'Run Shell Script' Automator action, and place the script in there.\nPDF Service scripts normally take a different set of incoming arguments (title, print options, filepath); whereas the Automator workflow only passes the filepath to the PDF, so you need to modify your script accordingly.\nThese problems seem to be unique to Big Sur, and are fixed in Monterey, which will allow PDF Services scripts a bit more latitude.\n", "Q: Failed to authenticate with Google, please try again later macOS Big Sur 11.2.1\nCant add any account to Mail, Calendar, etc..\nFor example, when I try add gmail account to my Mail and follow all steps:\n\n\nSame time when I log in with this account to google in browser, I see in this google account access for 3rd party untrusted applications is enabled:\n\nIt is not needed, google already gives access to my MacBook Pro macOS without this setting.

I need to back up the main Users folder, as well as all other data, from my main Mac (2013 13\" MBP). I've gotten the dreaded UEFI-inspired flashing question mark, and tried running Disk Utility's repair options on it, both on in recovery mode on the main machine, as well as from another machine (with the drive connected via a SATA-to-USB cable into another older MBP — my wife's).\nB/c I didn't have the option of backing up the machine \"normally\" — copying all files and folders through the Finder of my wife's machine, due to perms issues — I've used the utility app Disk Drill to create a .dmg file, encompassing the whole drive's contents (a byte-for-byte copy, is what it's called in this software).\nFirst, is there any other way of getting to the main Users folder, and the Applications, too? They're all hidden, as they were installed/created by a user not present on my wife's machine? (I just wanted the assurance of copying the files by hand, too, before wiping my machine's 1TB SSD and restoring the files from the disk image file I'd created in Disk Drill.) Secondarily (as a bonus question), is there anything suspect with the above approach?\nMany, many thanks, to all who take the time to read, much less answer.\n\nA: Since your failed system was on Catalina, which uses the Read-Only System Volume scheme with separate System and Data volumes, it sounds like you backed up only the System volume. The /Users directory, however, is stored in Data.\nOne possibility for why you did this is that the Data volume might be corrupted and unmountable and therefore didn’t show up in Disk Drill, so the System volume was your only obvious choice.\nAnother possibility is that High Sierra is two major OS releases behind Catalina. In general, it is inadvisable to mount an APFS volume from one OS using an older OS because APFS is a moving target and there are changes and additions to the format & filesystem driver that occur between releases. While unlikely, your wife’s machine may not be able to recognize the /Data volume. (It’s also unlikely but possible that mounting it on the old OS could have unintentionally caused damage to the newer format.) I haven’t used Disk Drill so it is possible that it did image your entire drive and the Data volume is still hiding in the .dmg, waiting to be read on a newer OS.\nAs a general rule, any time disk corruption is suspected, your #1 goal is to minimize disk usage (especially when hosted on the faulty machine) until you’re ready to perform a repair or transfer. Repair is no longer an option since Disk Utility couldn’t do it and no other APFS tools are currently available. So you’re left with transfer.\nTo maximize your chance of transfer, you need to be running at least the same version of OS on the lifeboat unit. You would also ideally be able to remove the physical drive from the target machine and place it in an external enclosure. Even so, your chance of success is slim if the Data drive failed to appear. You do need to be able to accept the fact that your data may be gone. (You could take out the SSD and set it aside, waiting for DiskWarrior 6 to come out and give you another chance at recovery.)\nIn short, try again with a Catalina machine, but minimize how much time the drive is powered on and be ready to call it a day.\n", "Q: Can a MacBook 12 inch (2017) run OSX Mavericks? I have a newish MacBook from 2017, but I have an old backup with programs I need to run from an old MacBook Pro 2013 that was running Mavericks.\nThe app from my backup is only for 32bit and requires Java runtime 6.\nWould my 12 inch MacBook 2017 run Mavericks? (So that I can boot that old program)\n\nA: You can not install Mavericks. The 2017 MacBooks came preinstalled with macOS 10.12.5 (Sierra), so you should be able to run 32 bit software. I have used 32 bit Adobe CS5 and CS6 (basically Photoshop and other stuff) on macOS 10.13 and 10.14 (High Sierra and Mojave), but I get error messages when quitting the applications. This was not a problem with Sierra and older versions of OS X. As Mathew pointed out, if you install Catalina or a newer version of macOS, you will not be able to run 32 bit software, unless you use a virtual machine (see below).\nYou can install Legacy Java (Java for OS X 2017-001), if you need Java 6 runtime support. I currently have this installed on a machine with High Sierra and another machine with Mojave.\nYou could try installing Maverick in a virtual machine. Both VirtualBox and Fusion Player are free products. I am not sure you can still download Mavericks. Yosemite and El Capitan are both available for download from Apple. However, most users dislike the feel of a virtual machine.\n\nA: No.  Macs can only run the same-year OS (in your case, High Sierra or Sierra, depending on when then model was released) or newer.  Mavericks was released in 2013.\nIt's probably best if you find a newer version of the app, (i.e. one that doesn't use Apple Java and/or can use standard Java), or if you have the ability to, recompile the app (to use modern Java.  Unless your 2017 MacBook is running Catalina or newer, you can still use 32-bit apps/programs).\n  \n", "Q: iPad to control Mac Pro computer audio system Technology\nMine\n\n*\n\n*MacPro macOS\n\n*11.0.1 Big Sur\n\nMy wife's\n\n*\n\n*iPad Pro\n\n*iPadOS 14.2\n\nStereo system\nMacPro has a hardwired digital connection to my stereo system's DAC.\nNo other available inputs (wireless or bluetooth) into the stereo system.\nSo, I can not send music directly from any other device to the stereo system.

Is there an app for iPhone and iPad that will indicate charge voltage and current?  Is this information available to the user already by some means I am not aware of?  And without jailbreaking or some other hack?\nThe problem is that there's a number of third party Lightning cables and USB chargers that may not do exactly what they claim on the box and it would be great to be able to verify the claims.  Or there's the possibility that the box is long gone and there's a need to identify the capability of a cable or charger quickly.  It would be nice to get some idea on what a cable or charger can do without setting up some lengthy and involved timing of how long it takes to do a recharge.  It would also be nice to get some voltage and current data without some inline USB ammeter and voltmeter, as such meters can be easily misplaced when they are needed while an iPhone is always in my reach.\nI found I can get some limited information about cables and chargers with my MacBook.  I can connect a cable between my iPhone and MacBook and see what System Information reports as voltage and current being supplied to the iPhone.  Because every USB port on an Apple computer is limited to 5 volts at 3 amps there's only three outcomes it tests.  Plug in cable and System Information shows data and power connection, this means cable has power and data connection.  Plug in cable, System Information shows nothing as if the cable is not connected, but iPhone is charging, means the cable has a power connection but no data connection.  Plug in cable, System Information shows nothing, and iPhone is not charging, means the cable is just broken.  I guess there is a fourth option.  Plug in cable and it starts a fire, then everybody dies, and people are sad.\nI can do something similar with USB power bricks.  I can use a known good USB-C cable and plug USB power bricks into my MacBook and see what System Information reports about it.  Like with the cable test this gives little more than a pass/fail.  A MacBook doesn't \"speak\" USB-BC and so any such USB power brick will just show as providing 5 watts even if it is capable of more.  With USB-PD power supplies it will show the power supplied but not the voltage.  In many cases the power supplied indicates the voltage supplied.  12 watts or less means 5 volts.  More than 45 watts means 20 volts.  Other than that there can be some ambiguity on what the power supply is doing.\nSearching the internet for an iPhone app that does what I'm looking for has proven difficult, perhaps as I don't know the right search terms.  That is assuming an app that provides the functions I'm looking for exists.\nAn app for macOS, or some other OS for a laptop with USB-C, might be helpful.  Such an app will not be much help in identifying USB-BC power supplies and cables but if there is something that can show what a USB-PD power supply is saying can be helpful.  The goal is to identify cables and power supplies in order to see how they will act with iPhones and other Apple devices with Lightning ports.  Something that can tell me what a USB-PD power supply can do is at least halfway to my goal.\n\nA: The only thing I have found that consistently works is a USB-C power meter, such as this one from Satechi:\nhttps://satechi.net/products/usb-c-power-meter?variant=31043692041\nI have tested many combinations of chargers, adapters, etc. and this will give the correct information. I found that some combinations of chargers and adapters work differently with for example a MacBook Pro and an iPad Pro - so getting the reading off a MacBook Pro might not reflect what actually happens with an iPad for example. This has happened to me even though the iPad Pro on paper should support that same voltage/ampere - and probably does - but for some reason having an adapter in between the charger and the iPad Pro makes for a different scenario.\n\nA: I am trying to give you some ideas, however, answering this wall of text is hardly possible, since there are multiple questions and this is a rather broad topic.\n\n*\n\n*Coconut-battery: This Mac App will give you information about cycle counts and power supply on the Mac side. If you connect an iPhone/iPad you can also see their information. This will give you more info about connected wall plugs and batteries.\n\n*Check your cables with a multimeter: Usually a cable either works or it doesn't (and usually it does not work if there is physical damage that you can see). However, you could check that in detail if you use a multimeter.\n\n*Using iPhone/iPad/Mac cables/wall plugs interchangeably is no problem: Your device will draw the current it needs. This means, as long as the voltage is the same, you can use wall plugs interchangeably. E.g. I use my MBPs wall plug (87W, USB-C) sometimes to charge my iPad. Further, all wall plugs have small text on them, indicating the voltage and current they provide. E.g. my MBPs charger states:\n\n\nInput: 100-240V ~ 1.5A 50-60HZ \nOutput: 20.2V--4.3A (USB PD) or 9V--3A (USB PD) or 5.2V--2.4A\n\n\nI know that you mentioned you don't want to use a multimeter, however, for other readers this info/tip might be useful.\n", "Q: Macbook 13 pro 2019, trying to connect 2 monitors I'm using a \"TBI Pro Adapter Adapti-13 Mini USB-C Hub\" on my macbook 13 pro (2019)\nAnd I wish to connect my 2 PHILIPS monitors (243v5) they are the same but from diffrent years.\nI connected them both thru the adapter one with VGA and the other with HDMI and the mac sees them as one monitor, but I would like it to be separated\\chained with the macbook lid closed\nanother this is the adapter is \"shooting down\" for time to time can it be because of the adapter or maybe the mac book can't hold to \"allot of things connected at the same time\" (gaming keyboard, mouse, 2 monitor and sometimes ethernet)\n\n\n\nThank you all for your time :)\n\nA: Judging from the manual, the adaptor can only output the same video signal to the different connectors at once. This means you can extend your screen once, but not multiple times. Most likely, the Mac does not even see that multiple monitors are connected, instead the adaptor just mirrors the one incoming video signal to multiple video outputs.\nTo extend your screen multiple times, you would need to get another adaptor or a powered hub.\nEDIT: \nAs mentioned by @MacGuffin in the comments the manual mentions that this actually is possible under Windows, yet it doesn't show that under macOS. However, trying it with a second HDMI cable instead of the VGA may yield results, although the manual mentions that it should not make a difference - aside from quality.\nSince the manual isn't that detailed, I would just try to contact the customer support mentioned at the bottom. They will be able to tell if and how it is possible to connect multiple monitors with different video outputs on macOS.\n\nAs a general note: While USB-C offers great bandwidth and speed it is still limited at some point. Plugging in 3 USB-devices, two monitors, 1GB Ethernet and Audio may work, but for sure not at maximum speed. It is not only a USB-C limitation, but also the controller in the HUB/adaptor needs to be able to handle all of that.\nFor testing drive speed I can recommend BlackMagic Disk Speed Test.\n\nA: All 2019 MacBook Pro officially support one 5k or two 4k displays.

What next?\n\nA: First of all, the process has evolved as newer versions of OS X and macOS have been released. Basically, you have the right idea. When booting to macOS Recovery, one or more ramdisks are created. The operating system then executes from these ramdisks. The drive (data carrier) where one wishes to install macOS can then be erased and formatted as an APFS container with a single volume. (This step is more complex when two drives are used in a fusion arrangement.) The installation files (which can consist of nested PKG and DMG files) are then downloaded from the internet. Recently, Apple published an article which gives some insight on how this may be accomplished. Here a private/tmp folder is created in the installation volume. The curl command is used to download installation files to this folder. The installation proceeds until the Mac boots to the newly installed Big Sur. Since the the installation files exist in private/tmp, these installation files are automatically erased at this point. The article refers to an installation on Macs with the M1 chip, however the downloaded software is also compatible with Macs with Intel processors.\nThe use of ramdisks, when either installing or booting to recovery, is not unique to macOS. When installing Linux, Grub executes an initrd command which loads a ramdisk file to memory. Windows loads a ramdisk file which is assigned the drive letter X:.\n", "Q: Connecting a MIDI piano keyboard to the iPad with a MIDI cable I have an iPad Pro and wanted to connect a keyboard with my iPad via a MIDI cable that I also have (https://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B00NH13DV2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).\nAnd I don't know which adapter to buy to be able to do it.\nThank you very much\n\nA: The cable you have is actually not a MIDI cable - it is however the correct cable for many keyboards/stage pianos today. The standard MIDI plug looks quite different (it is round), but in the end you'll be able to transfer the same data over the USB cable you have.\nThe adapter you need depends on which version of the iPad Pro you have.

If the folder is already opened, the items are selected and the slideshow starts. This takes into account the various views the window can be in, i.e., icon view, list view, or column view.\nNote that no other manipulation of the state of the front window is attempted after the slideshow finishes because, if it was started manually, any other actions would have to be done so manually after the fact anyway. Additionally, any AppleScript method employed, if possible, to trigger something after the slideshow finishes would probably be resource intensive, having to constantly monitor its state and act accordingly. Therefore I do not consider it practical to implement, even if it's possible to do.\nThe example AppleScript code was saved as an AppleScript application named Start Slideshow in Script Editor, given a custom icon in Finder and added to its Toolbar, as shown in the image below.\n\n\nExample AppleScript code:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    activate\n    set mySelection to selection\n    if mySelection is {} then\n        set selection to every item of front window\n        my startSlideshow()\n    else\n        set mySelectionAlias to first item of mySelection as alias\n        set mySelectionAliasProperties to properties of mySelectionAlias\n        if the class of mySelectionAliasProperties is folder then\n            if name of front window is equal to name of mySelectionAliasProperties then\n                set selection to every item of front window\n                my startSlideshow()\n            else\n                my openFolder()\n                set selection to every item of front window\n                my startSlideshow()\n            end if\n        else\n            my startSlideshow()\n        end if\n    end if\nend tell\n\non openFolder()\n    tell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n        key code 31 using command down\n    delay 0.2\nend openFolder\n\non startSlideshow()\n    tell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n        key code 49 using option down\nend startSlideshow\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and does not contain any error handling as may be appropriate.

On macOS UserA can ask UserB to share their screen simply by entering UserB's Apple ID into a \"New Connection\" window in the macOS Screen Sharing app. Then, by some magic, Apple delivers the request to UserB as an alert on UserB's Macs, anywhere in the world:\n| UserA would like to view your screen.  [Accept] [Decline] [Block User]\nIs there a Windows screen sharing app that UserA can use to make a connection in this way?\n“Why do I ask?”, you ask.\n\n*\n\n*Why VNC? I already have to trust Apple because I run their OS, so for security it doesn’t make sense to hand over screen sharing on the server to a third party server-side app (including man-in-the-middle-attack opportunities for keyboard and mouse scraping). Apple provides VNC server software in macOS.\n\n*Why not use an open port for VNC (via password-protected login). An open port is an invitation to get pounded with connection attempts 24x7. Any person/bot with a stolen username/password pair can get in at any time, 24x7.\n\n*Why do I want the Apple ID trick? I want a human to have to be there at the server to approve each connection request. Also the trick works without an open port on my server. An Apple server does that for me by fielding connection requests.\n\nActually, letting any app on a non-Apple OS act as a VNC client is a bad idea for security reasons (See #1), so it seems the only good solution is to allow connections only from Apple's VNC app, running on macOS. And it seems clear that a client app that can do the Apple ID trick is not going to exist on any non-Apple OS (or on iCloud.com in a browser).\nSo my question is moot.\n\nA: Must it be VNC?  Must the connection use the AppleID to point to the desired computer?  If so then not likely.  I expect that Apple guards dearly how their servers work in getting an AppleID to point to a specific computer screen.  There's other screen sharing systems besides VNC, some of which have a similar means to request a screen sharing session by entering some unique identifier for that person.  It's not likely to be their AppleID except by coincidence that the person uses the same name for their AppleID as they use for their ID on this other system.\nSince you specified VNC in the question I suspect that you are aware that the macOS screen sharing system is using the VNC protocol, and that with a VNC client on Windows one can establish a screen sharing session to a macOS computer.  Apple extended the VNC protocol to make this request by AppleID work so smoothly.  Replicating that will not be easy.\nThe use of an AppleID to connect to another person's computer works because Apple's servers are a central point of contact for the client and server to meet for establishing this connection.  Getting something like that will mean finding or creating a similar central point of contact.\nThere are dynamic domain name services that can allow an ID to follow a person or computer as the IP address changes.  Changes in the IP address can be from either the ISP moving it randomly as ISPs like to do for non-commercial users, or because people move their computer from a home network to a cellular hotspot when away from home.  This will not always be sufficient as there can be firewalls or something that can block a VNC connection.  These may be intentionally created blocks for security reasons, or merely coincidental to how a part of the network is configured.  Clearing such hurdles may not be trivial.\nBoth people using a VPN client to some central network can allow for the Windows VNC client to find the Mac VNC server by use of an unchanging ID no matter where either computer might be.  The network could be one a business or university uses for people to work or study at home.  Such networks might even allow for an ID for the Mac computer to not be some pseudorandom sequence of letters.  Setting up one's own network with VPN access is not likely to be trivial, and can run into the same shifting IP address problems if there's no commercial grade internet connection.  Using some commercial VPN service may or may not make establishing a VNC session any easier as their business model might not have peer to peer connections in mind.\nUsing an AppleID on Windows is not likely to work since Apple isn't in the business of making Windows easier to use.  Some alternative like a dynamic domain name or a VPN might get real close to offering a means to create a kind of user ID to enter as an address for a VNC client to use.  The many options on this and how each would be set up would provide enough material for a good sized book or a semester long course at a university.  Hopefully I gave some ideas on where to start looking for a solution.\n", "Q: Battery indicator on MacBook Air? Why doesn't the MacBook Air have a battery indicator on the device like MacBook Pro?

I have 130+ entries made in secure notes of Keychain Access. How do I restore them?\nIn detail: After upgrade to MacOS 10.13 from 10.11 my login keychain is out of sync and I lost all my 133 Password Entries I saved to secure notes. I can only temporarily restore them via Terminal commands. I see that my old key database was renamed to login_renamed_1.keychain-db. If I rename it to login.keychain-db and open /Applications/Utilities/Keychain\\ Access.app and my Password Entries are there again, but everytime I log out of my User Account (both after restart or after logging out) a new file named login.keychain-db is created and my Passwords are gone again.\nHere is what I do in Terminal:\nbash$ security default-keychain\n    \"/Users/myself/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db\"\nbash$ security set-keychain-password \"/Users/myself/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db\"\nOld Password:\nNew Password:\nRetype New Password:\n\n﻿This puts my keychain back in sync (password is set), but I still miss my PW Entries in secure notes.\nSo I am also setting a Password for the old keychain database (lines beginning with '//' are comments, thus no Terminal input ):\nbash$ security set-keychain-password login_renamed_1.keychain-db\nOld Password:\nNew Password:\nRetype New Password:\nbash$ sudo mv login.keychain-db login.keychain-db-out\n// renaming the current keychain-db to \"*-out\"\nbash$ mv login_renamed_1.keychain-db login.keychain-db﻿\n﻿// renaming the old keychain-db to the name of the default keychain\n\nWhen I open Keychain Access.app after this my Password Entries have returned, but only for so long as I do not log out or restart my Mac. Upon login or startup a new login.keychain-db file is created and the old one is again renamed to login_renamed_1.keychain-db.\nAt this time the only way I can retrieve my Password Entries is to open each entry, copy the contents of the secure note in a Text file, which I would have to repeat 133 times. I would rather keep my old databes instead, as you easily may imagine.\nDoes anybody of you has a solution for this? Thank you in advance for your patience reading this and – hopefully – for your help.\n\nA: I found the solution: I managed to restore my Password Entries permanently. It again involves tinkering with the Terminal, steps are as follows:\n\n*\n\n*open the Keychain Access App\n\n*create new Keychain\n\n*save new Keychain as default keychain; quit Keychain Access.\n// Hint: As soon as a keychain is not the default keychain anymore, you can change its Password again via Keychain Access (no more grayed-out menu commands there)\n\n*Continue inside Terminal:\n\nbash$ security set-keychain-password login_renamed_1.keychain-db  \n// this is setting a new password for the old (corrupted) keychain-db.   \n// Important: you must know the old password for being able to do so.  \n// In the next step I am replacing the default keychain-db with 'login_renamed_1.keychain-db'  \nOld Password:  \nNew Password:  \nRetype New Password:  \nbash$ sudo mv login.keychain-db login.keychain-db-out  \n// renaming the current keychain-db to \"*-out\"  \nbash$ mv login_renamed_1.keychain-db login.keychain-db  \n// renaming the old keychain-db to the name of the default keychain  \n\n\n\n*Restart Keychain Access. The lost 'Secure Notes' are temporarily restored to the Default Keychain, but only until the next login.\n\n*Choose Default Keychain, in the Sidebar choose 'Secure Notes' (I hope this is correct, as my macOS runs with german language).\n\n*Select all Secure Notes of Standard Keychain and move them via drag and drop to 'Secure Notes' of the new Keychain you created in Step 2.\n\n*now to the tedious part: in the now opening Dialogue Window you have to type the Password of the Standard Keychain – For every single entry (which was 133 times in my case).

Following facts:\n\n*\n\n*The files I want to recover are on Mac #2.\nI have another Mac if I need it.\n\n*Mac #2 no longer turns on. It no longer boots up. It powers up, but it won't come to the login.\n\n*On the Mac that works, I can't enable FileVault. I can't because it's a company laptop and without the admin password that goes through the Apple ID, I can't turn on FileVault. However, I think FileVault should actually be enabled on the broken MacBook? It probably isn't.\n\n*It's really just about a file that is in the home directory.\n\n*the Macbook is already a bit older. It should be around 2015.\n\nNow the following questions:\n\n*\n\n*Would it be possible for me to take the hard drive out of the broken Macbook and connect it externally to the working Mac and have access that way? And if so, can I then access the files at all? It is possible that they are encrypted.\n\n*When I turn on the mac in recovery mode and do \"reinstall macos\", will the personal files be deleted?\n\nOr in general, what can I do? Time Machine is probably not an option.\n\nEdit\nThe file is extremely important and of high value. Also, I have a lot of knowledge in Linux. So I can practically handle very well the shell of the laptop and then drag files to a USB if this were possible.\n\nA: The more valuable the files, the slower you should be and refrain from trying command line tools on your only copy of the drive. Test with a rented Mac first to be sure you have control of the system and tools you’re using. That being said, here is general advice for anyone needing data recovery:\n\n*\n\n*You can take a Mac to Apple for repair and ask they transfer the data to a drive you supply. (Pay the pros - get data maybe and a working Mac back)\n\n*You can destroy data by mounting a drive in Target Disk mode if you don’t prevent the second system from running a filesystem check. (The filesystem assumes you have a backup and restores consistency, rolling back changes and orphaning files if needed to provide a sane filesystem that accounts for space. It doesn’t set out to destroy data, but it can in some cases make things worse - why risk it?)\n\n*You can get a file recovery specialist to get your data, and save the repair expense (Pay the pros to get the data - fix the Mac later)\n\n*Reputable vendors like OWC will help you determine how feasible a storage swap is. Figure out precisely what storage costs and what surgery entails and you could be $20 of parts to remove the storage and safely try to recover files. (Pay for software and support once you run the free trial. Spend time learning)\n\nIf care to preserve the data, try booting your old Mac in target disk mode but use a write block tool like Data Rescue to safely scan the old Mac and see what is retrievable rather than letting the OS “repair” the drive.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.prosofteng.com/\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/transfer-files-mac-computers-target-disk-mode-mchlp1443/mac\nI would exhaust all options before working on an Apple portable or try a DIY recovery effort using non-paid tools if you care about getting valuable data off. If you just want to learn and the data is low value, dive right in with https://ifxit.com and disk drill or dd - both of those are amazing tools at a low price to obtain, but in skilled or unskilled hands alike are also known as the data destroyers.\n\nA: When recently I had pretty-much that problem, I was more than surprised… in fact, I was gob-smacked… by how little I had to pay for a solution.\nIt was Stormfront that rescued both my Mac and my stuff and while I have no brief for Stormfront I do think you'd have to go a long, long way to get either a better or a cheaper service, let alone both.\n", "Q: 2 iPhones with iMessage and getting messages from one phone to the other I have a personal iPhone XR. A couple of weeks ago my boss wanted to get business cells for a few of us (I'm a customer facing landscape designer) so we could ignore work calls when we wanted to.  As a Mac/apple user for years but I'm no power user or anything, we selected 2020 iPhone SE.\n\n*\n\n*I want to push my personal texts through to my work phone so that during the day I can set my personal phone aside and not worry about it.\n\n*I have both devices signed in to the same Apple ID and I think I set\nit up right.\n\n*Some things push through and some things don't.\n\nMostly what I've missed is group texts that include android users. At first I thought it was because it's only pushing iMessages through and not true SMS, but I miss texts from some android users but not all. Also I get regular SMS pushed through to my laptop and iPad....so that doesn't seem to line up.\n\nIs there a general fix for having two phones, and allowing the personal one to forward everything to the work phone and being able to switch that on and off cleanly once a day?\n\nA: SMS does not do group messages (well it might be up to the provider)\nIn the UK the phone providers will charge extra for MMS which do do group messages but not directly supported by Messages by default.\nThis is one reason to use WhatsApp, Signal etc.\n", "Q: Filtering duplicates from iCloud Photos Library while migrating from google photos I recently painstakingly migrated my photo library of 15+ years (over 100gb) from google photos to iCloud. I suspect many more will be doing this in the future as google recently announced they will no longer be doing unlimited storage for photos. The problem here is that the library exports originals as well as an -edited version for those files you have changed in google photos. I've tried multiple automatic tools and had some luck with photosweeper but am sure that i still have a few gb of undetected duplicates hiding in there. In some cases Photosweeper just doesn't seem to be sophisticated enough to find them - For example photos from a scanning service that all have the same date, or edited versions where i have rotated and changed the aspect ratio.\nComplicating this is the way Mac OS automatically manages photo storage on the machine, so i'm hesitant to attempt to run any scripts on underlying files that might corrupt the library. In a perfect world I would just do something like\n\n*\n\n*find all files matching (.+)-edited.{jpg,png,heic}$\n\n*\n\n*where there is a matching file without the -edited\n\n\n\n*select and delete/trash the non-edited version\n\n*\n\n*in a way that is safe for my photos library\n\n\n\nAn alternative might be to start over completely and use the google drive app on my desktop to download and copy all pictures that way, but i'm worried i would lose files that way too.\n\nA: I use PowerPhotos for this and am super happy. Dump everything into one library, clone it and then try out various passes until you’re happy, then do the culling on your main library is my advice.\n\n*\n\n*https://fatcatsoftware.com/powerphotos/\nIt lets me make rules once the pre-built ones take a first pass at cleaning the easy and obvious duplicates. You can prefer HEIC and edited or any other sort of metadata for automating which of the duplicates to select to keep and which to trash. It is updated very often, super easy to use and extremely powerful. I’m a decent “shell scripter” but in the end, this tool saved me many days of trying to “yolo” it with scripts. It’s got the goods on parsing photo metadata and wrangling libraries into shape in a safe manner.\nUnless you’re willing to eschew Photos and syncing entirely, there aren’t better options. If you could exist entirely on filesystem and folders and a tool like Photo Mechanic to store photo metadata in the filesystem, I would go all in on Photos and iCloud and hire a tool if you can’t script it yourself.\n", "Q: Disable Fans on MacBook Air 2019 Hi I'd like to disable the fans on my 2019 MacBook Air.

I want to know if its possible and not the Risks\n\nA: Apple sure has listened to this market segment. I would trade that Air for a MacBook (one) or the new Air. Silent running is such a rare pleasure for many portable computers.\nI also strongly endorse never disabling fans on gear that depends on them for cooling and safe operation of lithium batteries that are a clear safety hazard if they charge or run over temperature.\n", "Q: Two different Containers after factory reset? Macintosh HD & Macintosh HD Data? I wanted to start from scratch so I followed the guide that Apple has on their site. After rebooting and logging back in I saw that I have two different containers. Macintosh HD and Macintosh HD Data. Is there anyway to consolidate these into one? It says there's \"Other Data\" that's sitting at 22GB. No idea what that is and I'd love to clean up space on the Mac, that's why I wanted to restart from scratch.\n\n\nA: For a Mac with a single internal drive, starting from scratch usually means erasing all partitions from the drive and creating a new GUID Partition Map with a hidden FAT32 formatted EFI partition and either a legacy Mac OS Extended (Journaled) formatted partition or a APFS container partition containing a single APFS formatted volume. The erase operation is usually performed by using the Disk Utility, but also can be performed by using the diskutil command.\n\nApparently, you either did not perform an any erase or erased a volume instead of the drive.\n\nOnce the drive is erased, a macOS can be installed. If required, any selected Mac OS Extended (Journaled) formatted partition will be automatically converted to APFS.\nTo show the drives in the Disk Utility window, select View>Show All Devices from the Disk Utility menu bar or press the key combination ⌘+2. Also from High Sierra, Mojave and  Catalina, you can select Show All Devices from the pulldown menu shown below.\n\nFor Big Sur, the pulldown menu appears as shown below.\n\nWhen erasing, you should get a popup asking for name, format and scheme. Below is an example from Big Sur. For scheme, you should always choose GUID Partition Map.\n\n", "Q: WindowServer: (CoreDisplay) [com.apple.CoreDisplay:default] [DEBUG] spamming my console and doing excessive amounts of disk activity Macmini8,1 (2018) running up to date 10.14.6 OSX Mojave:\nMy console is getting absolutely destroyed and followed with 'WindowServer: (CoreDisplay) [com.apple.CoreDisplay:default] [DEBUG]' messages and doing excessive amounts of disk activity.

It uses an external brick power supply. I bought it a few years ago and it has never been knocked and sits on my desk in the same place. Periodically I plug it in to do a backup. Last time I used it, the backup completed without any problems or ugly noises.\nHowever, this time the MacBook isn't seeing the external hard drive. I can see the light on the drive, so it's getting power from the external brick. This drive wasn't cheap so I don't want to spend yet more money on replacing it!\n\nA: Short Answer:\nI removed the HDMI Cables from the Thunderbolt ports and connected the 8TB external HD in isolation and it was then recognized and worked correctly.\nLonger Answer:\nAfter doing some basic diagnostics failed to yield any clues, I had an epiphany: I was now using dual HDMI monitors connected to my Thunderbolt ports- (1) HDMI cable connected into a Thunderbolt port on each side of my 2018 MacBook. Generally, I don't use these.  Was it affecting the power is some undefined way?\nSo I unplugged the monitors and just plugged the 8 TB external hard drive into a Thunderbolt port by itself. Bingo: it was recognized and sprang to life. Of course you can plug the MacBook's power cable into any free Thunderbolt port while the External drive is connected as the power cable is definitely going to be power-in and not drawing power FROM the MacBook.\nTo validate my understanding, I used a USB-C pass-through power meter and plugged the external HD into it. The arrow in the below picture revealed that although the external HD had its' own external power supply/brick, unbeknownst to me it was nonetheless drawing power FROM the MacBook. So with the HDMI cable connected to the other Thunderbolt port on the same side of the case, it appears that affected the available power to the external hard drive.\nAlthough this solution deals with an external hard drive, I'd suggest when troubleshooting any device connected to the Thunderbolt ports which is presenting with issues to connect the device in isolation- unplug all other devices- while testing it.\nHope I saved somebody else from needlessly buying a replacement external hard drive!\n\n", "Q: Terminal app can access folders that it isn't allowed In the security and privacy pane I didn't allow the terminal app to access anything.\n\nI didn't allow full disk access either.\nHowever, it can show the contents of Desktop by doing cd Desktop, ls.

I had a look in the activity monitor and when I pulled more information about TabNine, I didn't quite understand the concept of \"virtual memory\". It says \"390GB\".\nHow can it have a virtual memory of 390GB when I have a base variant mac with 8GB|256GB spec ?\n\n\nA: About Virtual Memory\nVirtual memory allows an operating system to escape the limitations of physical RAM. The virtual memory manager creates a logical address space (or “virtual” address space) for each process and divides it up into uniformly-sized chunks of memory called pages. The processor and its memory management unit (MMU) maintain a page table to map pages in the program’s logical address space to hardware addresses in the computer’s RAM. When a program’s code accesses an address in memory, the MMU uses the page table to translate the specified logical address into the actual hardware memory address. This translation occurs automatically and is transparent to the running application.\nFrom Apple Developer Documentation\n\nWhat is secure virtual memory on Mac?\nTo keep your information safe, macOS uses secure virtual memory. Virtual memory is a technique computers use to temporarily move data from random-access memory (RAM) to the hard disk if the amount of available RAM is limited. If the data written to the hard disk as virtual memory is unencrypted, and is never overwritten, it could be captured if the hard disk is scanned, creating a potential security risk.\nSecure virtual memory in macOS eliminates this risk by encrypting the data in virtual memory. Secure virtual memory is always on, so data is kept secure while it’s swapped between your hard disk and RAM. The RAM on your Mac contains no information when it’s turned off.\nFrom Apple Support\n", "Q: Shortcut to save screenshot both to desktop and clipboard The screenshot shortcuts save either to the desktop or to the clipboard, but not to both at once. Is it possible to copy to clipboard, and to save in desktop, the same screenshot preferred in a single shortcut?\nIf a single shortcut is not available, the only way is to save to desktop and then copy the saved image to clipboard manually?\n\nA: One way to do this would be to write an Automator script to copy the image to the clipboard (for instance \"if new image found in folder\"). A example of that can be seen here\n", "Q: Does VSCode have Full Disk Access via Terminal? I can use the terminal in VSCode and the terminal has Full Disk Access, so does VSCode have Full Disk Access?\nCan VSCode and extensions run terminal commands?\n\nA: That is a mix of misconceptions.\nYou do not run Terminal in VSCode. Vscode calls macOS to request macOS to launch Terminal. So VSCode does not have Full Disk Access that way.\nVSCode also can run command line tools directly not via Terminal. These tools might need Full Disk Access which I think can is done by giving VSCode Full Disk Access.\nVSCode also might need Full Disk Access to access files in various different places on the disk.\nExcept for a few special cases for an App to get Full Disk Access requires the user to manually give it. This is via System Preferences->Security & Privacy -> Full Disk Access\nNote I don't use VSCode at the moment but this is the setup for my programming editors.\n\nA: You will need to provide the VSCode full disk access so the integrated terminal can execute the commands. See below:\n\nFor example, I can clear the recycle bin from the VSCode terminal without using sudo when I put the code in the ~.bash_profile\nalias t='rm -rf ~/.Trash'\n\nClear the recyle bin:\n$ t\n\nThis will work as VSCode will have full disk access now.\n", "Q: Mid-2007 MacBook (MacBook2,1) - Software Restore disks I picked up an old Mid-2007 MacBook a few months back, and I have been playing around with it.

So I tried putting the drivers on the installation drive but it did nothing. Any Help Appreciated.\n\nA: The last version of OS X compatible with your Mac is OS X Lion 10.7.5. I assume that you have not purchased Lion from the Apple App Store and therefore can not download a copy. The path to store the Mac from scratch would be as follows.\n\n*\n\n*Install OS X Snow Leopard 10.6. AFAIK, Apple no longer sells this DVD. You can try to purchase a used copy. A free ISO can be downloaded from the internet. You can then either burn to a DVD or create a bootable USB flash drive installer.\n\n*Upgrade to OS X 10.6.8. This is a free download from Apple. I should point out you probably will not be able to download this update from a OS X 10.6 install. In other words, the version of Safari is to old. You should attempt to download to a flash drive in advance or use another machine to download to a flash drive.\n\n*Upgrade to OS X 10.7. This is available from Apple for 20 USD. This purchase is for a download of the software to upgrade from Snow Leopard.\n\n*Upgrade to OS X 10.7.5. This is a free download from Apple.\nBecause of the age of the Mac, you should consider abandoning OS X altogether in favor of version of Linux. What would be available for your Mac depends on the amount of RAM installed.\nDebian with desktop has a 512 MB minimum and recommends 2 GB or RAM.\nXubuntu with desktop has a has a 512 MB minimum and recommends 2 GB or RAM.\nThe current Debian ISO can be downloaded from here.\nUbuntu is a popular Linux. However installing requires 4 GB of RAM. Xubuntu is basically the same, but with a Desktop interface that requires less RAM.\nNote: Due to the age of your Mac, Linux probably should be installed to BIOS boot. I have installed both Debian and Xubuntu on a 2007 iMac with 4 GB of RAM.\nI assume you have the memory split as 1 GB + 512 MB. The maximum memory is 3 GB. You could upgrade by replacing the 512 MB with either 1 GB or 2 GB. OWC seems to still sell memory for your model.\nYou probably could install 32 bit Windows 10. The 64 bit version would require a memory upgrade to at least 2 GB. The drivers can be downloaded from this Apple website. I was able to install 64 bit Windows 10 on a 2007 iMac using the 32 bit Windows 7 drivers. You can download and try Windows 10 without a purchase, but to keep using requires purchasing a license. IMO, Windows probably would run to slow to justify the purchase of a license.\n\nIf you attempt to install a current release of either Linux or Windows 10, you should expect to run into unforeseen problems which may be solved by posting a new question.\n\n\nA: EveryMac.com says:\n\nPre-Installed MacOS:  X 10.4.9 (8P4112)   Maximum MacOS:  X 10.7.5*\n*This system can run the last version of OS X 10.7 \"Lion\" if upgraded to at least 2 GB of RAM.\n\nAll versions of MacOS from 10.4 to 10.7 were sold.

I was under the impression that when I back up my iPhone with iTunes on Windows 10, everything is backed up, so that I can restore everything to a brand new iPhone.\niTunes iPhone backup size (6 GB)\nHowever, when I look at the backup folder size at\nC:\\Users\\<username>\\Apple\\MobileSync\\Backup\n\nit's only 6 GB.\nUsed storage on the iPhone (40 GB)\nWhen I check the \"storage\" section on the phone, music alone is 9 GB, let alone another 14 GB of app data, photos etc.\nAlso, when I check iTunes, it shows \"Documents & Data\" being around 25 GB.\nDiscrepancy (32 GB)\nTherefore, I was wondering, what's missing in the iTunes backup?\nMy research so far\nI've googled for https://www.google.com/search?q=what+does+itunes+backup+include\nand found articles saying \"photos\" and \"music\".\nhttps://www.imobie.com/support/what-does-itunes-backup.htm\nBut that can't be true in my case.

Everything inside /Volumes looks (at first glance) to be folders, but in reality are what are called mount points.  These are just places to join disks into the tree of folders starting from /Volumes.\nWhen you mount a disk, macOS creates a mount point in /Volumes and connects the disk to that mount point.\nWhen you cleanly dismount a disk the mount point is removed.\nBut sometimes the mount point gets left behind.  For example, following a physical disconnect without a preceding dismount.\nThe last few comments in this blog post show someone who has 3 such mount points left behind. Howard Oakley's blog\nYou have two choices:\n\n*\n\n*Don't worry about it.  The mount point is not taking up space on your disk.\n\n\n*Attempt to remove the mount point.\nHoward Oakley advises not to mess with it. The danger when tampering with /Volumes is that you will mess up your whole folder structure and end up with an unbootable system.\n\nA: OK, I figured this out (with thanks to @Gilby):\nIn the Finder I used Cmd+Shift+. to show hidden items and navigated to the Volumes folder.\nThe leftover Mount Point was listed there. A simple cmd+delete removed the Mount Point.\n", "Q: WindowServer crashing intermittently after Big Sur update Two crashes in one week.\nFirst time, my macbook was in idle state, and I was not at the desk.

At first glance, it looks like something is trying to record your screen, and when WindowServer is requesting access, that request is getting timed out and causes WS to be terminated by xpc. Since from your description it doesn't sound like you're trying to take a screenshot/screencap, I can only theorize on possibilities:\n\n*\n\n*You have Screen Sharing or Remote Management enabled in System Preferences -> Sharing and someone is trying to view your screen.\n\n*You have software or malware installed that takes screenshots/caps at certain times.\n\n*You have certain Accessibility features enabled.\n\nNone of the above should, in general, fail in the way that you're seeing, though. So you can check your settings in System Preferences and disable sharing & accessibility features as a test, but that would be a workaround at best, not a root cause & fix. (The malware possibility is there, too, but I'm always hesitant to go down that route until we've ruled out more benign causes.)\nIt should be noted that Big Sur has been a very buggy release and a lot of errors in particular pertain to WindowServer, so my suspicion is that what you're seeing is not at all your fault.\nHere are things to try:\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences -> Sharing: Disable Screen Sharing and Remote Management, if enabled.\n\n*System Preferences -> Accessibility: Disable any accessibility features you may have enabled.\n\n*System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Accessibility: Disable all apps and share a list of them in your question.\n\n*System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Screen Recording: Disable all apps and share a list of them in your question.\n\n*If steps 1-4 don't help, the next time this happens, capture a sysdiagnose after rebooting from your crash and we can try to dig into your logs. You can do this either via the sysdiagnose command in Terminal or by pressing and holding the ShiftControlOptionCommand keys together and while holding these keys pressing and releasing the period . key.\n\n\nA: This is an over-sized comment, because I don’t have the solution either.\nI came across this bug yesterday, and I checked the crash reports. There were five crashes related to WindowServer, forming a crash loop (i.e. crash -> reboot -> log-in -> crash). Some of them are similar to the one in the question; their Termination Details field mentioned “unresponsive work processor” as the crashing context. Other crashes mention (formatted for readability)\n\nis_alive_func returned unhealthy: WindowServer initialization not complete (post IOKitWaitQuiet)\n\ninstead. Remarkably, for all crashes, the stack trace of the crashing thread starts with\n0   libsystem_kernel.dylib          0x00007fff204c82ba mach_msg_trap + 10\n1   libsystem_kernel.dylib          0x00007fff204c862c mach_msg + 60\n2   libdispatch.dylib               0x00007fff203697a0 _dispatch_mach_send_and_wait_for_reply + 530\n3   libdispatch.dylib               0x00007fff20369bba dispatch_mach_send_with_result_and_wait_for_reply + 50\n4   libxpc.dylib                    0x00007fff202421a8 xpc_connection_send_message_with_reply_sync + 238\n\nThe line following XPC (cross-process communication?) library varies from com.apple.LaunchServices to com.apple.HIDPreferences, so I suspect that something is wrong with the XPC library.\nNote that the hex number (address of the method?) is different from OP, but it’s probably because of macOS version (I’m iMac at 11.6.1); the method names fully match, and offsets mostly match.\nAnother note: the crashing thread in the question is always com.apple.tcc.preflight.kTCCServiceScreenCapture, but my experience was different. Only one of my reports crashed at this thread. Others crashed at com.apple.main-thread. I suspect that the screenshot is only one way to trigger this bug.\n", "Q: Unable to remove sound output device iShowU from Audio Midi New here but I have searched and gone through various questions and solutions on removing Multiple Output Devices from Audio Midi but I have not had any luck.\nI have uninstalled iShowU Audio Capture from my Mac but it still shows up under the \"Output Device\" and in Audio Midi Setup with no way to remove it.

In the past, I never had to use ssh-agent and everything worked fine.\nBut I noticed, on GitHub, it is asking people to use ssh-agent, even if we don't use it, it seemed fine.  So I just ignore that lengthy part usually for the ssh-agent and ssh-add.\nBut for a few days I was able to log onto Bluehost, but yesterday day I added a new pair of public and private key to my MacBook Air M1, and now the log in that used to work becomes:\nReceived disconnect from 162.241.123.123 port 22:2: Too many authentication failures for mike123\nDisconnected from 162.241.123.123 port 22\n\nwithout even asking for a password. But it was strange why when it let me log in, it asked me for password, when I thought the whole idea of ssh is not requiring password.\nBut today, it does not even ask me for password but spit out the message above.\nHowever, my MacBook Pro was able to log in, even though it is asking for a password.\nThe Bluehost tech support was saying, I should paste my private key to their Bluehost SSH panel.  But I thought we should never give out our private key.\nSo must we use ssh-agent now?  What might be the issue of \"Too many authentication failures for _____\" and how is it solved?\nP.S. Aftermath: I did follow the steps in the Github docs above and used ssh-agent and ssh-add, and created the file ~/.ssh/config.  The fact that ssh-keygen did not create ~/.ssh/config might suggest ~/.ssh/config is not a usual practice, but after I did the above steps, then I was able to be asked a password and be able to log in again to Bluehost. Why it still is asking for a password, I am not sure, but at least it is letting me log in.\n\nA: No, there's no requirement (new or old) to use ssh-agent.\nAnd no, the whole idea of ssh is not that it won't require a password. One of the ideas behind ssh is that it provides an encryption connection between the server and the client.\nDetermining whether the server and the client are the \"right ones\" (i.e. the ones you want to allow talking together) can be done through many means. One of them is simply requiring the client to enter a username and a password. If you do not supply a username, the currently logged in user's username will be used instead.\nAnother way of authenticating yourself to the server is using keys. The tech support agent that stated that you should paste your private key was wrong. Never give out your private key!\nInstead you want to paste the public part of the key to the server's interface. This way you can login using the key instead of a username and password.\nIn order to ensure that others do not misuse your key, it is common practice to protect the key itself with a passphrase (i.e. not username/password, but a \"long password\"). If you do that, you can either enter the passphrase every time you want to login, or you can use a program like ssh-agent so that you only have to enter the passphrase once when logging in to your computer, and then the key would be ready to use without further passphrases whenever you need to login.\nThe guide you have followed instructed you to create a config file. You're right that the config file is as such not required, but I won't say that it is not usual practice to have one. The reason why they ask you to create one when following the guide is to have the special instruction \"UseKeychain\" set. This makes it so that the passphrase protecting the key is stored in your macOS Keychain.\nThe practical benefit is that now you won't even have to enter the passphrase when you login to your computer. When you login to your computer like normal, that usually unlocks your Keychain as well - including your passphrase.\nThe fact that you're still asked for a password when logging in seems to indicate that your keys setup is not used. Make sure it is actually the password that you need to enter (and not the passphrase) - if so, that is usually because you haven't properly pasted the public part of the key to their SSH panel.\n", "Q: How can I fix or back up a system after I use gparted to resize my drive and the system will not start? I created an EFI to run Ubuntu on my mac it was working well but I didn't have enough space so I created a another partition in disk utility and then went to gparted and turned the new partition to un-allocated space, selected swapoff on my SwapSpace  partition in order to move the un-allocated space next to my ubuntu partion.\nNow I can  no longer select  macOS to boot and am exclusively stuck in linux. I don't know to much about this stuff and am really struggling.\nApple support says to erase everything but I have no backups.\nMy whole drive for my mac is still there and I can see it is taking up space. I just cant access it \nIs there a way to salvage the system or at least back things up now that my system will not boot?\n\nA: I was actually able to figure this out myself (no thanks to Apple), but have seen a lot of questions similar, so I thought I would share what worked for me:\n\n*\n\n*I downloaded Gnome Disk for Linux\n\n*reformatted the corrupted drive to Apple AFPS\n\n*and then remounted the drive\n\nI was able to get everything back and into macOS.\n", "Q: My Time Machine is backing up in /private/var/folders/ My MacBook Pro (10.15.7) is backing up parts of the drive I didn't expect. I have been cleaning up and excluding directories, but this time I found something I thought was excluded by default:\nprivate/var/folders.\nTo examine I have been using 'Timedog'. Here is a piece of today's output:\n\nAgain, as far as I know and as referenced here, the standard exclusions\n/System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/StdExclusions.plist\n\ninclude ('exclude') private/var/folders/ under the \"contents excluded\" category, meaning that the folder container is backed up but nothing inside. Clearly here we have 42.6 MiB of content.\n\nA: This is an attempt at a (partial) answer. It is too long for a comment.\nApple makes changes (mostly minor) to Time Machine without notification or  documentation. I believe that the question and answers here are too old to be reliable for recent versions of macOS.\nThe StdExclusions.plist does not exist inside the backupd.bundle on macOS 11, so that is no longer a mechanism for exclusion.  I don't know if it exists in macOS 10.15.7. And even if it does exist, whether it is used.\nMike Bombich of Carbon Copy Cloner specifies what is excluded by CCC and says that it excludes only part of /private/var/folders.  He lists these as being excluded:\n\n*\n\n*/private/var/folders/*/*/C\n\n*/private/var/folders/*/*/T\n\nOf course, that doesn't directly imply that Time Machine is doing the same, but it is a pointer.\nOn my Mac some files are from /private/var/folders are included in Time Machine.  My Time Machine snapshots include just these:\n\n*\n\n*/private/var/folders/*/*/0/...\n\nThis is all largely circumstantial regarding Time Machine, but does suggest that the exclusion mechanism is more complex (or should I say hidden) than most of us expect.\nJust to muddy the waters, I have to admit that the exclusions.plist file included in the root of every Time Machine (macOS 11.2) snapshot does list /private/var/folders as being excluded!\nFinally, my advice is never to attempt a cleanup of system exclusions if there is any likelihood of wanting to do a full restore.\n", "Q: Problem starting Mac Mail on Big Sur I have just bought a new Mac Mini (M1) with Big Sur.\nWhen I start Mail I get a screen headed \"Message Import\" , \"Welcome to Mail\".

The keyboard is a Logitech MX but I don't want my script to be dependent of that.\nI can use bash, applescript, C, or any other language that can be called/binded to node.js\n\nA: The app Tooth Fairy ($5.99) should be able to do this. Although it's designed for AirPods, it works just as well with keyboards and other Bluetooth devices. After adding a device, you can set scripts to run upon connect and disconnect, so you can call your own scripts to perform whatever action you'd like to take.\n\n", "Q: Catalina crashing at shutdown: “watchdog timeout: no checkins from watchdogd” I have a MacBook Air 2017 with 8GB of RAM and 1.8 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5,\nAfter updating to macOS Catalina, while I’m using my laptop it would freeze and the screen would turn black with a folder sign with a question mark in the middle flashing.

What do I do?\n\nA: Updating to Monterey 12.3 would help get rid of kernel extensions - especially if you can back up your data and do another erase install.\n\nI would start keeping a log of what’s connected to the computer. Since you’ve erased the machine, you’ve ruled out an install issue so this is either the changes you make to the software after its cleanly installed, the hardware itself or the hardware you attach.\nUntil you can make this happen on a clean OS with no data migrated or apps, it’s unlikely to be the OS itself or the hardware on the Mac.\nI would focus first on accessories, then the software you install. Something is not exiting cleanly and the watchdog is letting you know that after waiting a reasonable amount of time for the shutdown process to complete, it pulled the plug and obeyed your shutdown command instead of hanging indefinitely for all the apps to exit cleanly.\nThere was a very insightful comment that belongs in an answer. Your system may have outdated versions of Avast and Virtual Box - consider uninstalling those or updating as appropriate.  This is exactly the thing we have cropped up on some older macs that had different anti virus, security and virtualization software installed. Backup and erase+install solved every single one.\n", "Q: How to get an ssh tunnel started every time my Mac boots?

At idle it will sit at 15-25% CPU time. When moving the mouse cursor it jumps to 30-50% CPU time. This appears to cause some system slowdown under load and reduce battery life.\nThere are a few other threads and questions around the internet about high WindowServer CPU use but they're all for older MacOS versions on older Macs. I have tried some of the suggestions such as:\n\n*\n\n*Looking for excessive logging from WindowServer and disabling those logs -- there don't appear to be excessive logs\n\n*Turning on reduced transparency mode -- no effect\n\n*Disabling apps that draw updates to the menu bar -- no effect\n\n*Closing all apps except top in a terminal -- no effect\n\nSo this appears to be a different issue perhaps specific to M1 Macs or to Big Sur. What might be causing this and how might it be mitigated?\n\nA: Just to share the same experience on an Intel Macbook Pro 2020 running latest Big Sur version (11.2.2) I have WindowServer process idling at ~15% CPU and jumps to ~50% as soon as I start using the trackpad (like continuous round gesture over the trackpad for 20/30 seconds)\nI've reported the issue in Apple Feedback Assistant FB8974295 on the January 18th but still no feedback from Apple so far.\nOn Activity Monitor the highest CPU Time process is WindowServer (and by a good margin)\n\nA: Big Sur has many known issues related to UI performance. It’s almost certain that you’re experiencing one of these bugs, and so you’re unlikely to be able to do much about it yourself. We can try to confirm or refute this hypothesis if you’d like.\nDoes this occur if you’re running in Safe Mode? (Shift during boot) If so, do the following in Safe Mode. Otherwise, do it when the problem occurs.\n\n*\n\n*Run the following command to enable kernel symbolication: sudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\" (this may require you to disable SIP first).\n\n*Reboot your machine and don’t open any apps except for Terminal.\n\n*Do the minimum required in order to reproduce the problem.\n\n*In Terminal, run the following, making sure you’re only running it during the window of time that you experience the system slowdown. (In particular, do NOT have Activity Monitor running when you do this.): sudo spindump -reveal -noProcessingWhileSampling\n\n*After waiting for 10 seconds to collect a sample and another minute or two to symbolicate and format, you’ll get a file in /tmp/spindump.txt that contains a stackshot of every process.\n\n*Upload the file to PasteBin or some equivalent place and we can take a look to see what’s causing the CPU usage spikes.\n\n\nA: Terminal comes with some settings that might amplify the effect. I would close all your terminal sessions and open one that does not have unlimited scroll back. Then in one shell only, run top -u -s 300 and walk away.\nIn 10 minutes you should have a good indication of what the idle CPU usage is.\nThe WindowServer process reacts to everything that might be drawn on screen even if it doesn’t show. Minimized apps, apps running in the dock (watch top in terminal update when docked), hidden apps, browsers running code in tabs that are not visible all need to be processed in the background.\nIt’s not immediately obvious when you look at a Mac to determine if a setup that pushes a lot of updates has been configured. You can further troubleshoot that booting to save mode (easier on Intel hardware) and setting all apps to not auto start and managing which run until you can determine which are causing window server to do work constantly.\n", "Q: Apple Books won't download any books/files saved in iCloud only on Mac (macOS Big Sur) I can't download any books/files I saved with iCloud in the Apple Books app on my Mac anymore (it worked before though).

How do I find out whether the 3.5mm audio jack on the side of my MacBook Pro (2.9 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5, early 2015) allows audio input from a headset microphone.  (I need a headset for Zoom).\n\nA: All PowerBook and MacBook models support TRRS style audio input. Check with the vendor of your headset if you want to use any buttons or volume control if you have questions. Apple branded headphones work well, as do many third party options.\n\nA: Yes, it does support a combination of headphones and mic input on that jack (limited to Apple's spec) as indicated by the specs here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/sp719\n\nA: In answering the more general question on headsets that will work on your MacBook Pro with Zoom I suggest considering Bluetooth and USB headsets in addition to headsets that connect by a TRRS 1/8\" phone jack.\nUSB and Bluetooth headsets will be \"future proof\" since the TRRS phone jack is disappearing from new hardware.  Another \"future proof\" option is Apple's USB-C adapter to go with any headset that uses the TRRS 1/8\" phone jack.\nhttps://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU7E2AM/A/usb-c-to-35-mm-headphone-jack-adapter\nApple produced this USB-C adapter for their iPad Pro but it works on many other devices, including those not made by Apple.\nI don't want to talk you out of a headset with a 1/8\" phone jack.

Currently, my MBA is plugged in (and 100% charged) and through my earphones I am hearing a buzzing sound. If I turn off the power then the sound vanishes.\nMore interestingly though, if I touch my hand to any area on the metal surface the sound vanishes. Likewise, if the power is plugged-in and I drag my hand through any area of the metal surface then there is a distinctive vibration I can feel which is absent when my hand is resting.\nIs this normal behaviour? Is there any chance of damage of any kind? Could this be a grounding issue? I'm pretty sure that the power is grounded (but not 100% sure).\nEdit : Additional Comment -\nIn case it's relevant I bought the MacBook through official online store of Apple so no chance of a run-in with power rating issues. Also, the power supply at my place is rock-steady.\n\nA: Sounds like an earthing issue. If power supply & mains plug and socket are all correctly earthed, this should lessen or disappear.\nSome PSUs aren't earthed* - this I've always considered a manufacturer failing.\nTechnically it's not 'dangerous' as the mains leakage from a switch-mode power suppy is a known quantity, but it does upset people.\n*See How to properly ground a MacBook Pro for details of how even with a three pin plug your Mac may still not actually be correctly earthed/grounded.\n\nA: This used to happen to a family member's MBA when it was plugged into a specific outlet and placed on top of a limestone countertop. Touching it stopped the buzzing. Absolutely a grounding issue.\n", "Q: Auto-hiding dock completely disappears on menu bar screen Once I use the auto-hiding dock on the right screen, I am no longer able to use the dock on center screen.  To resurrect the dock on the center screen I first have to use the dock on the laptop. Once I do that, the dock on the center screen magically comes back to life. This cycle is repeatable, without fail.\nHere is my monitor arrangement. It has the top of the laptop just slightly under the bottom left corner of center monitor. This depicts the actual physical configuration.\n\n\nA: While documenting this problem, I stumbled upon the solution -- after two years of fiddling with this. Note the new placement of the laptop in the arrangement below when compared to that in the original post. I had tried swapping monitors, cables, ports on my MBP dock, the menubar location. Nothing helped. And while I was writing up the original post I thought, I wonder if the laptop being at all under the center monitor makes the OS treat the two as one, vertical viewport when it comes to deciding to raise dock.  Now, I don't know if that's accurate or not, but it got me to try moving the arrangement to have the laptop just around the corner on the side, and voila!  No more strange dock behavior. Now I can freely use the dock on any monitor and it does not get stuck. Now, I just have to undo all the strange muscle memory my mouse arm learned while this was still a problem...\nIf anyone can speak to my supposition about the \"one, vertical viewport\", I'd be interested and grateful to know the details.\n\n", "Q: Choose from list apple script service execution from Safari opens Firefox to display the dialog with list Im trying to use following Apple Script to display a choose from list and perform certain actions based on the choice of selection:\non run {input, parameters}\n    set selT to \"42\"\n    set selectedOption to choose from list {\"Safari\", \"Chrome\", \"Firefox\"} with prompt \"Search with:\" without multiple selections allowed and empty selection allowed\n    \n    global urlToOpen\n    set urlToOpen to \"na\"\n    if selectedOption is not false and length of selectedOption is not 0 then\n        set urlToOpen to \"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=\" & selT\n    end if\n        \n    if ((urlToOpen as string) is not equal to \"na\") then\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            tell (first application process whose frontmost is true)\n                set theActiveApp to name of it\n             end tell\n        end tell\n        activate me \n        \n        display dialog theActiveApp\n        \n        if theActiveApp is \"Safari\" then\n            tell application \"Safari\"\n                tell window 1\n                    set current tab to (make new tab with properties {URL:urlToOpen})\n                end tell\n            end tell\n        else if theActiveApp is \"firefox\" then\n            tell application \"firefox\"\n                open location urlToOpen\n            end tell\n        else if theActiveApp is \"Google Chrome\" then\n            tell application \"Google Chrome\"\n                open location urlToOpen\n            end tell\n        end if\n        \n     end if\nend run\n\nBut, whats happening is; when the Automator service runs, it opens Firefox to display the list of options. It would be a great help to understand this behavior, because Firefox not being the default browser and it is waste of CPU resource to open it.\n\nA: Firefox is likely opening because the script includes:\ntell application \"firefox\"\n    …\nend tell\n\nBased on your description, these lines require AppleScript to launch Firefox to determine if the script is correct – even if the involved lines are never run. Firefox needs to be launched for AppleScript to obtain the application's scripting language support.\nThe other browsers implement AppleScript using a more modern approach. They provide their language support through an embedded Scripting Definition file (SDEF) within the application bundle.\nopen a URL on macOS\nYou can avoid this behaviour by using the macOS open command line tool and passing the desired browser's bundle identifier with the URL to open.\nThis removes the need to write browser specific sections of AppleScript.\nBe sure to quote the arguments:\ntry\n    set myURL to \"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=\" & \"42\"\n    set bundleID to \"com.apple.safari\"\n    do shell script \"/usr/bin/open -b \" & quoted form of bundleID & \" \" & quoted form of myURL\non error (e)\n    display dialog e\nend try\n\nCalling open without a bundle ID will open the URL in the default browser.\nOpen URL with Safari\n /usr/bin/open -b com.apple.Safari 'https://dssw.co.uk'\n\nOpen URL with Chrome\n /usr/bin/open -b com.google.chrome 'https://miln.eu/apps'\n\nOpen URL with Firefox\n /usr/bin/open -b org.mozilla.firefox 'https://indie.miln.eu'\n\n| and Error Checking\nYou could surround the application names with | to defer script error checking from compile time to runtime. See user3439894's answer for this approach.\n\nA: If you want to stop Firefox from opening when not necessary, then change:\n else if theActiveApp is \"firefox\" then\n        tell application \"firefox\"\n            open location urlToOpen\n        end tell\n\nTo:\n else if theActiveApp is \"firefox\" then\n        set |Firefox| to \"Firefox\"\n        tell application |Firefox|\n            open location urlToOpen\n        end tell\n\n\nFirefox does not have an AppleScript dictionary file  (.sdef) and sans some of the basic commands is not really considered AppleScript scriptable.\nNote that while the trick used in this answer works for Firefox in this particular use case, it may not work for other applications that contain an AppleScript dictionary file and calling commands specific to that given application.

I currently have an iPhone 8 with 256 GB storage which I migrated my previous iPhone SE 1st edition with 64 GB storage to when I got it from an iTunes backup and reused the SE for other purposes.  I also have a lot of photos which I originally kept in Photos on my Mac and used Photostream to automatically copy new photos to my iPhone.   At one point I transferred my photo library (50000 photos and videos) to iCloud and did as prompted and it has worked well for me.\nNow I broke the glass on the iPhone 8 so I need to send it in for repairs (corona prohibits walk-in repairs) which may take several days, so I would like to do the \"backup to itunes - restore backup on reset device keeping passwords and everyting\" exercise again but this time back to the iPhone SE\nUnfortunately iTunes refuses to restore the backup as the device is too small.  Investigations show that photographs take a lot of space (see image) even after turning iCloud off on the iPhone 8 and then trying to synchronize from my Mac again with just a single album containing a single image.  Didn't get rid of them.\nI cannot delete the Photos app so this cannot get rid of the data.  I can attach a bluetooth keyboard but the Apple-A command doesn't select all the images for deletion.  I can run xcode on my Mac against the 8 if necessary.\nIs there a way to remove the Photos other than one at a time?\n\n\nA: It turned out when connecting with cable and starting Image Transfer that the Camera Roll on the iPhone contained 38.000 photos (which I suppose somehow happened during my Photos-on-Mac -> iCloud migration last year).\nThe Image Transfer program could delete them all but it took a few hours, and the backup size shrunk as expected to be small enough.\nThe \"Hey you have a new iPhone next to this one\"-transfer from the old iPhone to the new could then complete as expected.\n", "Q: Can I use target disk mode from a Thunderbolt 3 mac to a Thunderbolt 2 for data recovery?

There's some data on it that I kind of want (nothing super important though). I haven't had any luck recovering the data with freely available tools (I tried a few things on Linux live USBs, and I also tried the Disk Drill MacOS USB, which saw nothing), so I was trying to demo the R-Studio data recovery software to see if it could find the lost partitions and files. However, the USB wouldn't boot on the old laptop, and the tech support guy at R-Studio said the only way I could do it was to run R-Studio on another Mac and read the drive using Target Disk Mode.\nIf I buy a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter and a Thunderbolt 2 cable, would I be able to use Target Disk Mode from my 2017 15\" Thunderbolt-3-equipped work laptop? And would this in fact give the level of hardware access needed for lost partition/lost file recovery?\nI feel like the data has to still be there in some form, because I haven't written anything to the disk since I borked it up.\n\nA: Yes, that should work.

Then I saw this article from last summer https://www.macworld.com/article/3564563/dont-keep-your-mac-laptop-charged-to-100-percent-all-the-time-heres-why.html that seems to contradict what I've seen suggested the past few years, which is recommending that your unplug your laptop daily and let it drop to 30-40%.\nSo I am confused on what advice to follow. Each dichotomous suggestion seems to have a basis, but which one is valid?\n\nA: The Macworld article reflects best practice.  The battery is designed to be used.\nI wouldn't be too concerned about dropping the charge to 30% every day.  Even dropping to 80% will help.  For a long healthy life the battery should be used.\nOf course, if you keep it plugged in all the time you don't have to be worried about keeping the battery healthy!\nJust to say it again: The battery is designed to be used.\n", "Q: Always use dark mode, on Mojave I have chosen Dark mode, under System Preferences > General > Appearance.

Yet this annoying service is still trying to connect to Apple!\nWhy the command to disable daemons isn't working?\n\nA: In general, stopping/deleting Apple services is a mistake.  It leads to other unexpected issues which often can only be fixed by a reinstall of macOS.\nIf you really must, for this particular service I would try deleting (perhaps in Recovery mode) /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.apsd.plist and /Library/Preferences/com.apple.apsd.launchd and rebooting.\nNo guarantees this works as this is not something most people would want to test. Report how you go in the comments.

When I unplug my USB-C modem, sometimes it will no longer work again when plugged in, even after having the computer sleep.  The only solution I have found that works is to restart my computer.\nThe following question is very similar.  In my case, the USB works the first time it is plugged in, but may or may not work if unplugged and replugged in.  If the following questions was answered, this one would probably be answered too, but there is no answer to this question yet:\nRefresh USB port / restart usb service\nBoth ports have the same behavior, and even when the hub stops working it still passes power to the computer (can charge through the hub).  So my issue is different from this one:\nMacbook Pro: One USB-C port only works for charging devices\nIt seems this may relate to the SMC, but I don't know why, just that others seem to think that  one cannot reset the SMC without rebooting.\nhttps://www.imore.com/how-troubleshoot-dead-usb-c-ports-your-macbook\nReset SMC without power button\nIs there any way to reset the USB ports without rebooting my computer.  (Or is it possible to demonstrate that the problem is linked to the SMC?)\nThe only way I have found to prevent the problem is to not run my power through the USB-C hub (note that an answer to this question suggests this should be acceptable practice: USB C HUB delivery safe?), but rather to plug them separately into the two USB-C ports.  But this is prevention, not the \"cure\" I am looking for.\n\nA: Try this (you may need to disable SIP first):\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"usb=0x20\"\n\nThis will prevent your USB hubs from entering low power mode, which is one possible cause of unreliable reenumeration for noncompliant devices. It’s just a hunch since we haven’t done a deep dive but it’s a good quick first pass. If that doesn’t help, we can also try disabling deep idle:\nsudo nvram boot-args=\"usb=0x60\"\n\nMake sure you reboot after running either one.\n", "Q: Updating firmware to get OWC Aura Pro X2 SSD to show via Macbook Air Basically I am trying to install a brand new Aura Pro X2 480gb SSD into a Macbook Air 2014, the original apple SSD has failed and is not seen by the Macbook Air.

To install this update, there needs to be an working internal drive compatible with the existing firmware. The original apple SSD was compatible. The new Aura Pro X2 480gb SSD will be compatible once the firmware update is installed.\nI assume you have not ever had High Sierra or a newer version of macOS installed on your Mac. I assume this true, because you state the Disk Utility on the High Sierra installer does not recognize the new Aura Pro X2 480gb SSD when installed in your Mac.\nTrying to install High Sierra to an external drive does not solve your problem.

This is why you're getting a refused connection: Although you may be routing traffic correctly to your remote Mac, sshd did not open port 1234 on that Mac in the first place.\nYou can confirm this by getting onto your remote Mac and either running a port scan (/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Network Utility.app, Port Scan, address 127.0.0.1, ports 1234-1234) or by trying to ssh locally (ssh -p 1234 user@localhost).\nTo fix this: You can change your sshd port by editing its launchd property list.

Any ideas?\n\nA: The Messages app stores history in ~/Library/Messages/chat.db, which is a database in SQLite format. To open it and inspect it, you'll need to install the SQLite tools, which are available from the SQLite website or from Homebrew with brew install sqlite.\nIn a terminal, run sqlite3 ~/Library/Messages/chat.db, which will open the sqlite3 command line. Type SELECT * FROM handle; and search for the relevant conversation - its ID is the number in the first column.\nNext, run .output filename.txt to set a path for the output to be saved, and\nthen run the following command, replacing 12345 with the ID of the conversation you're exporting.\nSELECT handle_id, date, datetime(date / 1000000000,'unixepoch','31 years'), text \nFROM message T1 \nINNER JOIN chat_message_join T2 \n    ON T2.chat_id=12345\n    AND T1.ROWID=T2.message_id \nORDER BY T1.date;\n\nYou will now have a text file, filename.txt, containing this conversation in chronological order. You can run .schema message to see the full list of columns if you would like to save more data - simply add a comma and the name of the column onto the SELECT statement.\n\nA: Another option is the app iExplorer which can extract an entire Messages conversation from first to last message, including images, into a PDF file. I believe they still have a free trial available so you can see if it works for you. It is also a very powerful tool for working on iOS devices outside of the limited Apple app access.\nDisclaimer: I'm a satisfied user of iExplorer both personally and professionally, and have no financial or other interests in Macroplant LLC.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro not turning on after not being used I have stopped using my MacBook Pro (end of 2016) with touchbar for more than a month. Today I tried to boot it up but was not able to.\nBefore not using it, I made sure it was charged to 100% and I shut it down completely. I thought doing so would help prevent the battery from being damaged.\nUnfortunately it seems the mac is dead without any reason. I have to say that when I tried to start it today, the screen lightened up, then I was able to see the login screen for 1second then nothing. I could see that it was at 1% and being charged.\nI tried to leave it charging for 1 hour but still nothing.\nAny idea what to do from here ?\n\nA: Reset your SMC. It controls the power management hardware on your system. It may not be allowing your battery to charge for a number of reasons.\nIf this still happens afterwards, please take a (preferably high frame rate) video of you powering on your machine, including both the keyboard and display, so that we can see at precisely which point in the boot it fails.\nEDIT:\nIn our discussion in comments, we ruled out possible low-hanging fruit:\n\n*\n\n*Ensuring the correct key chord for SMC reset (ShiftControlOption on the left-hand side of the keyboard for pre-T2 units, + Power)\n\n*Swapping the charger cable.\n\n*Swapping the charger.\n\n*Trying all four USB-C ports.\n\n*Verifying live AC power.\n\nBecause of how early in the boot flow the failure occurs, it is likely to be due to a hardware issue. There’s very little you can do to debug this without poking at the hardware, whether it’s you or an Apple support engineer doing it. You would need to start probing voltages along the power rails and looking at power sequencing on an oscilloscope. Maybe it’s something as simple as a bad battery confusing SMC, in which case you could try to replace the battery yourself, but don’t buy one unless you’ve confirmed with a multimeter that yours is bad.\nShort answer: Talk to Apple for options.\n", "Q: Where can I find of Apple TV apps that can be installed in France? I bought a French relative an Apple TV from the US as a gift. Until I can go there and see what the Apple TV App Store has to offer, I would love to see if there's a list of TV Apps that one can install in France to start giving them recommendations based on their tastes.\nWhere can I find a list of French Apple TV apps?\n\nA: Without changing your store country, you can search the App Store in any country using the marketing tools site, previously known as Link Maker.\nhttps://tools.applemediaservices.com/app-store\nEnter a search term and on the next page choose a store country and platform.\n\n", "Q: macOS Big Sur deadlock update This evening my macOS Big Sur requested a restart for an \"important update\". After macOS reboot, I get a screen made of a background with standard Big Sur wallpaper and a mid-size centred-view windows which is asking to me to connect to the Internet because this update cannot be done without access to a network.\nI give my usual Wi-Fi connection, it didn't woks anymore: a popup with an icon representing a smoking appears telling me that the connection using Wi-Fi could not be established.\nSo I take Ethernet cable and plug it into my MacBook Pro and I tried to connect to Internet using Ethernet.

Partition on my OS Volume (not data volume), but all appears to be fine.\nIt is possible to get the rid of this update and let the OS to boot normally?\n\nA: If you need it urgently, since you can boot into Recovery, can you create a new volume and do a fresh install of macOS onto that? Then you can migrate your files over to that new volume and delete the old one.\n", "Q: \"USB Accessories Disabled\" notification from Thunderbolt 3 network connection? I've got a MBP (16\" 2019) connected to a MacBook Air (13\" 2020) both running Catalina in clamshell mode. I have a Thunderbolt 3 cable between them for network connection. Ever since I connected this Thunderbolt cable between them, I get endless notifications reading \"USB Accessories Disabled - Unplug the accessory using too much power to re-enable USB devices.\"\nI'm not certain that it's specifically the Thunderbolt 3 cable that's generating this error; I just know I don't get it when it's not plugged in, and it only appears on the MBP, not the Air. The MBP also has a powered USB-C docking station that has some USB3-connected hard drives and a webcam - but even if I unplug the webcam and USB3 hard drives, I still get the notification about an accessory using too much power, and again I cease getting that notification when the Thunderbolt 3 cable is removed.\nThe Console log output around the notification reads:\n[Line 825 of /AppleInternal/BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/IOUSBFamily_executables/IOUSBFamily-987.140.1/USBAgentAndDaemon/Daemon/Classes/USBDaemon.m] -[USBDaemon portOverCurrent:]overcurrent at 0x14300000\nIs the Air trying to charge itself from the MBP over Thunderbolt? How can I get it to stop, or at least to stop the notification from appearing?\n\nA: \nIs the Air trying to charge itself from the MBP over Thunderbolt?\n\nThat is quite possible.\n\nHow can I get it to stop, or at least to stop the notification from\nappearing?\n\nAs I recall a MBP can source up to 15 watts to no more than two USB-C ports, and no more than 7.5 watts to the other two ports.  Apple laptops can sink power from only one USB-C port at a time.  If there is more than one power source connected then the laptop will choose to sink power from the source that is advertising the ability to source the most power.  If there's two sources advertising the same power output capability then it will choose one at random.  An Apple laptop will not typically switch from one source to another if both are of equal capability but if something should interrupt the connection to the first choice then it might flip.  An interruption might be from the laptop being put to sleep and reawakened, a reboot, a loose cable, a utility power glitch, or something else attached to the power source taking enough power that it changes it's advertised power ability.\nConsidering the MBA side of this connection first there's looking at where it should be getting power.  The first obvious thing to check is for loose cables.  I'll see docks and displays with more than one usable USB-C port to the host, where one supplies more power than the others.  Is the MBA connected to the high power port?  A low power port will supply 15 watts just like the MBP would, it wouldn't take much to trigger the MBA to flip to take power from the MBP.  Even if the MBA is connected to a dock, power brick, or display that advertises 60 watts of power available a glitch in the system could cause a flip.\nOn the MBP side there could be USB power issues other than the power hungry drives and video camera.  Consider what else is plugged in.  Consider that if the MBA is drawing power that it's going to want to take all 15 watts the MBP could give.  Given that you are not seeing the MBP try to sink power from the MBA it's likely that the MBP has a solid power source.  Or, it has a 96 watt power brick and a display capable of sourcing 60 watts connected that it's not likely to try getting 15 watts from the MBA.\nI can certainly agree that it's not certain that the connection to the MBA is the problem but you did make a case on that being a place to look.  What would be helpful is to find a way to maintain this Thunderbolt connection but in a way that no power can travel down that wire.  That's not going to be easy, or at least not cheap.\nOne way to break that power connection and keep the Thunderbolt connection is with two Thunderbolt 2 adapters and a Thunderbolt 2 cable.  That's putting what is likely a $15 cable into a drawer and replacing it with a cable and adapters that would cost about $150.  Oh, and it would cut the bandwidth of the connection in half.  Perhaps with a steady hand and a sharp knife someone could do surgery on a $15 cable to remove the wires that transfer power and not disturb the wires needed for a Thunderbolt connection.  An optical Thunderbolt 3 cable would give full bandwidth and have no power transfer.  An optical Thunderbolt 3 cable would cost a lot of money too.  Is there a means to get Thunderbolt without power delivery that I'm missing?  If it's possible to borrow a couple Thunderbolt 2 adapters and a cable then you could at least test the theory.  Borrowing an optical cable would also work but likely be far more difficult.\nI suspect that using anything other than a Thunderbolt cable to connect the two laptops is undesirable.  A Thunderbolt 3 cable is a very cheap and very fast way to connect two Apple computers.  There's just nothing else like it.  Opening up the set of acceptable solutions to those that include removing the Thunderbolt connection will likely bring a solution faster.  But then that makes it so trivial that there's not much to discuss.\n", "Q: How do you disable the autofocus of a Razer Kiyo webcam on Mac? The Razer Kiyo is not officially supported on Mac, but works anyway. Problem is: autofocus is not convenient, with the camera often jumping in and out of focus. Is there a way to disable it?\n\nA: This is an old question, but in case people are searching for a free and easy solution for their home office setup, I finally found it.\nCameraController is free and works for the Razer Kiyo out of the box.\nIt allows you to disable autofocus and much more.\n\nA: This thread How do you disable the autofocus of a webcam in OS X?\n, on SuperUser, had a similar question, but the answers did not help.\nThe only way I found to work requires access to a computer running Windows and is this:\n\n*\n\n*Connect the webcam to a computer running Windows. I did this in Bootcamp.\n\n*Windows will detect the webcam and then offer to install Razer Synapse.\n\n*Install Razer Synapse (it has an option to sign in as Guest to avoid being forced into creating an account.)\n\n*In Synapse, find the Kiyo and open its advanced settings, then:\n\n*\n\n*Disable autofocus (tick off the 'auto' checkbox.)\n\n*Set the focus value by hand. A value around 190 seems to do it.\n\n*Apply the settings.\n\n\n\nThe new settings are saved into the webcam itself, so they'll work in macOS. Reboot into macOS.\n(Between four Windows updates, installing and testing, this took me fifty minutes. Sigh. But you might have better luck.)\nSome websites recommend using OBS to do this, but:\n\n*\n\n*In Windows, it'll offer the exact same configuration modal as Synapse;\n\n*In macOS, OBS will not offer any configuration modal.\n\n\nEDIT: Webcam Settings ($7.99) did work for me on Mac.\n", "Q: Why does macOS show \".local\" domain name for TimeMachine server when my network is configured for \".lan\" I have a TrueNAS server running on my network that provides TimeMachine services.  My network DHCP server is configured to provide .lan as the domain name.\nHowever, when I go to Time Machine preferences, I see the server as zfs.local instead of zfs.lan.\nWhy does that happen?\nI have another machine that sees the same servers as zfs.lan properly.\n\nA: This may be occurring due to accidental usage of Avahi/Bonjour. If you mount the Time Machine volume to your Mac and click 'Get Info' on a file stored on it, you may see something like smb://lunar._smb._tcp.local/Chrono/. This indicates that the server was automatically discovered because it offered an SMB service. If you were connecting via the hostname it would read smb://lunar.local. If this seems accurate, the solution is to either disable Avahi or Bonjour on your server, or to manually mount via the hostname and change your Time Machine disk.\n", "Q: Xquartz Catalina hangs I've had Xquartz working multiple times on different machines over the years but I just did a new install and have some strange behavior with no windows popping up.\nMy issue is, when I run an app like xclock, it just hangs acting like it's running but no window pops up.  And when I try to quit Xquartz it goes away initially but then comes back after a few seconds.  Even force quit doesn't kill it, it comes back after a few seconds.  Then trying to quite the terminal session, it says Xquartz is still running though killall X11 says:\n\n\"No matching processes belonging to you were found\"\n\nI installed Xquartz via homebrew and manually with the .dmg file and restarting my computer, still same issue.

I installed Rosetta Stone app, which is a popular language learning iOS app, on M1 MacBook Air and tried restoring the contents, but it showed there is no items to restore.\nOn iPhone and iPad, I can restore the contents, but for some reasons I couldn't on MacBook Air.\nI use the same Apple ID and same Rosetta Stone login account.\nSo I wonder if the in-app purchases are not shared between iOS and Apple Silicon MacBooks, or if it depends on each app, or others.\n\nA: Each app developer decides how they validate receipts and licenses. Microsoft Office 365 designed their licenses so macOS, iOS and iPadOS all share the same one license. Apple provides shared app storage so even if the developer doesn’t want to host their own license servers and validation logic, an app developer could easily design shared licensing model via Apple App Stores.\nI don’t see Rosetta Stone saying clearly in support either way which they chose, but there’s no technical reason why they don’t honor one license on all versions of the app. They could easily expect you to pay as well and Apple doesn’t really weigh in which model a developer chooses.\nI would open a support ticket with Apple (since you paid them presumably for the subscription) and with Rosetta Stone (since they publish both apps) to ask how it is intended to work. Once you know their intent you can then pursue support if your license isn’t working or know they just don’t intend this to work.\n", "Q: Soundflower replacement on M1 Macs In the past, Soundflower has been a great way to record audio generated by applications on my Mac. Soundflower's GitHub page indicates that it does not (yet?) support M1 Macs.

And how do I fix it? I tried restarting the system a couple of times, but that didn't fix the issue.\n\nA: The webcam is working fine now. So, I want to note down what I did (although, it isn't much, and I'm not sure how or what exactly fixed the issue).\nI stumbled across this post, asking a similar question. And I decided to follow along with the only answer in it. So, I shut down my mac, held down the D key, and switched on the mac.

PDFs, books and anything you have imported into Apple Books. You already have a backup if you use iCloud and Apple Books and iCloud Drive are enabled on Preferences > Your Name > iCloud.\nDelete the Apple Books app and download it again from the App Store. Then try again and see if it fixes your issue.\nBeta software\nI see you are running iOS 14.5. iOS and iPadOS 14.5 are currently beta operating systems and are expected to have bugs and other random issues. I can't guarantee you this specific issue is caused by the beta, but it's possible. I would test it but since I'm a developer I'm also running the developer beta.\nNonetheless, all of the notices on using beta software from this answer apply.\nIf you didn't have this issue before, you can downgrade your iPad to a stable version and see if downgrading fixes it.\nI'll summarize the downgrade steps but you should check out the complete downgrade tutorial here.\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have a backup of all of your data. If you don't have backups, you will lose all of your data during the downgrade. Backups created on iPadOS 14.5 can't be restored on iPadOS 14.4, which is why Apple tells you to backup before installing the beta. I don't remember if there's a way to keep the data when downgrading without a backup.\n\n\n*Connect your iPad to your Mac or PC via USB.\n\n\n*Open Finder or iTunes and select your iPad.\n\n\n*Force-restart your iPad and enter recovery mode.\n\n\n*Select Restore in Finder or iTunes.\n\n\n*Wait for Finder/iTunes to finish downloading the stable version of iOS to your computer. It will automatically begin installing after it finishes downloading.\n\n\n*Click Ok to the “Your iPad has been restored to factory settings…” message, and wait (don't disconnect the device) until it shows you what are your options for restoring your data.\n\n\n*Restore your data.\nIf you don't have a backup, you can also wait and check if it is fixed on the next betas. Developer betas are released roughly once every two weeks. You should report this and any other issues you find to Apple using the Feedback Assistant app so they can fix it.\n\nIt's best if you report it directly from your iPad, if possible right after the issue occurred, because the iPad will collect logs and diagnostic data that is critical to finding the bug. You can see your bug reports from the web at https://feedbackassistant.apple.com\nI think this is likely a software issue (even if not beta-related), but I'll include two other easy things I've thought of which you can try.\nGeneric cable or charger interfering with the screen\nGeneric cables and chargers can interfere with the touch on your screen and create weird scenarios when using your devices. Try unplugging them and distancing your iPad from the charger and see if this fixes your issue.\nToo much grease interfering with the screen\nIf the screen is way too greasy (a lot, like picking-up-greasy-food-then-immediately-using-the-iPad greasy), it would be possible for the grease to interfere and keep registering as a touch input on the screen after you lifted your finger. iPadOS has many software optimizations to ignore unintentional touches so this issue could be sporadic and closing the app like you mentioned (or just switching to the Home Screen and then back to the app) would fix it.\nI'm mentioning this because there are parents with children who share iPads. If the issue remains after cleaning the screen, then this is not the cause.\n", "Q: Question about root rights I have a question about this post and it says that if you want to leave out the \"sudo\" in front of it, the following is described\nhow to run `hping` without `sudo`\nsudo chown root:wheel /usr/local/Cellar/hping/3.20051105/sbin/hping3\nsudo chmod u+s /usr/local/Cellar/hping/3.20051105/sbin/hping3\nNow comes what I don't quite understand.\nIs it correct that hping is allowed to run with root rights only because root is the owner?\nIt is still far from being authorized it is only said that root can make changes to this file or do I get it wrong?\n\nA: User Richard Wick posted an answer which explains that the command has to call the setuid function in order to elevate the privileges of the command.\nSo changing command ownership to root and adding the s bit to the command's file mode is not enough.

On iPhone I have some contacts in Gmail group, I need these contacts to appear also on my other iPhone, which has only one group, iCloud.\n\nA: You have two options here - you can either keep the contacts in Google Contacts and add your Google account to the other phone so they sync, or you can transfer the contacts to iCloud. If you're only using Apple devices, my recommendation would be to transfer them to iCloud, because it's simpler to manage and works well with Apple devices.

Then, I opened Contacts app on Mac. Then, I go to the group Gmail, click on one of the contacts and then just select all (CMD+A). Then I drag and drop all of these from the Gmail to iCloud (in the left sidebar there are all these groups listed, iCLoud, Gmail....). I do this for other groups as well, i.e. I transfer all of their contacts to iCloud. Then, I just delete contacts from all other groups except iCloud.

I like to adjust which contacts can call me when “Do Not Disturb” is active, but going deep into the settings each time is tedious. Is there a faster way to adjust this setting?\n\nA: Long hold on the “Do Not Disturb” icon in control center, and select “Schedule”.\nThis will take you directly to the “Do Not Disturb” settings, where you can make any desired adjustments.\n\nA: You could use the Shortcuts app to maintain a separate group of whitelisted contacts that are allowed to bypass Do Not Disturb (you can choose to Allow Calls From a group). That way, you can introduce more complicated behavior into the shortcut - for example, \"toggle all family members\", or \"only allow my wife\" - through a menu system within the shortcut.

It does not indicate that the server is down, that the network is flawed, or anything of the kind.\nThe ImagePullBackOff message you're seeing can be caused by multiple things.

What is the best way to do so?\nI have considered a couple of approaches, but I don't want to risk breaking something. Here are those 2 approaches:\n\n*\n\n*simply deleting the file /var/mail/$USER\n\n*This approach:\n\n\nGo to the Finder, hold down the Option key and click the Go menu. You'll see a Library folder in the list. Click that. (You can only see it when you hold down the Option key.)\nWithin, there's a Mail folder, then v2, then subfolders for accounts. Your old account folder may be there, although I've always experienced it being deleted when an account is removed.\n\nI'm a little unsure about this because I don't see V2, but instead V8, and I have no idea what those files are:\n\nSo I am unsure of what to do. The goal is to safely remove any potential junk from my computer, and stop the \"You have mail.\" message from appearing when I start the terminal.\n\nA: Remove /var/mail/$USER.

You can check for sleep entry & causes by examining the power management log:\n$ pmset -g log\n\nIn any case, in order to prevent the system from going to sleep you can acquire a power management assertion with the use of caffeinate(8), which is built in to macOS and accessible via Terminal:\n$ caffeinate\n\nThe system will not sleep until you exit (via Control + C).\nFrom your description, I suspect that you might not actually be on AC power the whole time and instead are running off the battery.

A sample directory is as follows:\n~/2021_1234/\n    01.xx\n    02.xx\n    03.xx\n    01.zz\n    02.zz\n    03.zz\n    01.bmp\n    02.bmp\n    03.bmp\n\nI need the final result to follow this structure:\n~/2021_1234/\n    /2021_1234-TIFF/\n        01.tiff\n        02.tiff\n        03.tiff\n    /2021_1234-JPEG/\n        01.jpg\n        02.jpg\n        03.jpg\n\nEssentially the useless metadata files need to be deleted, and the .bmp files need to be converted to both .tiff and .jpeg files in their own subfolders with the Job Number as well.\nIdeally I would like to also include LZW compression for the .tiff conversion if possible.\nCurrently I'm using a combination of manual copy/paste/delete, alongside 2 Automator Applications, 1 each for .jpeg and .tiff conversion. I'm only using a basic Get Specified Finder Items along with Change Type of Images.\nIt works, but it's not perfect as lots of manual steps still need to be done. Especially when I have to repeat all the steps for multiple jobs.\nThe ideal solution would allow me to simply drag 1 or multiple Job folders into an Automator Application and have it do all the image conversion, subfolder creation, and deletion of unnecessary files without any intervention on my end.\nHowever, I can't seem to find a way to get the other steps done within Automator, and I get quite confused when I look at sample bash scripts that use sips.

As a consequence I deactivated auto mount and I usually format them before mounting them if I do not need to access their content, it is nonetheless quite common for me to need their content: I was wondering if there was any software able to scan them before mounting them; I remember that when I was on windows some antivirus were able to do so (probably mounting them to some sandbox I suppose) and I was wondering if there was any alternative software able to do so on MacOS.\nThanks\n\nA: A common approach to such unknown and \"foreign\" USB drives is to use a virtual machine for mounting. I.e. using a tool such as VirtualBox (free) or VMware or Parallels (commercial software) to run a virtualized Linux or macOS system - and then mount the disk in the there.\nIn almost all cases that limits the amount of damage that can be done to that virtual machine. Virtualisation software usually supports snapshots so that you with 1 click can restore the virtual machine to what it was before the unknown drive was plugged in.\nIt is ofcourse important to remember to setup the virtualisation software to grab the USB drive instead of the host operating system automatically mounting it for you - but as you have already disabled automount, that shouldn't be a problem.\nAnother option would be to use a user-space tool to inspect the disk without actually mounting it. The tool to use depends on the file system on the disk - but for USB \"keys\" it is usually a FAT-based file system. A popular tool for that on Linux would be fatcat - however, I do not know if it runs on macOS. It's not in HomeBrew, but I guess it wouldn't hurt to download it and try to compile it on macOS - it might just work.\n\nA: Under Unix, the user has to start the malware. The malware cannot start by itself when you open the USB stick.\nAbove all, only those programs start that can also be executed, so something like \".jpg\" .mp4 \"\" .txt \"falls out.\nYou should stay away from external software that says it is scanning the USB stick, because most software itself can contain malware and it also sees the contents of the removable media and can intrude on your privacy\nIn addition, a virus scanner is technically not feasible.

For an easy case, you should be able to get Safari to block.  Depending on your browser history and what exactly you type - you may need to block more than “cnn.com”:\n127.0.0.1 cnn.com  \n::1 cnn.com  \n127.0.0.1 www.cnn.com  \n::1 www.cnn.com  \n127.0.0.1 web.cnn.com  \n::1 web.cnn.com  \n127.0.0.1 cdn.cnn.com  \n::1 cdn.cnn.com \n\nYou also will have to disable most of the search bar functionality since you may be typing a web search in your address bar and then Google, Duck Duck Go, Ecosia will look up CNN's IP address for you based on your typing cnn and pre-load from the IP address - not the DNS lookup...\n\nThe above image provides suggested settings for Safari on Big Sur if you implement the block list I provided above for https://cnn.com\n\nWeb browsers and some security apps in some cases no longer only call the OS for DNS. Malware, potentially unwanted software and even legitimate programs are starting to hard code IP addresses to get to their servers - and this can be good in the case where they are testing for broken or malicious DNS - not so good when you're unaware what they are doing.\nThe days of hosts ruling to roost may be long gone unless Apple forces all apps to use system calls. You should be able to get Safari on Big Sur to block sites out of hosts - be sure you open an incognito / private tab or quit the app after making changes.\nEven trying to block sites and network ranges network wide using tools like Pi-hole are being lessened in the ever escalating war between people that want to track and monetize your use of the internet and people that are working towards network neutrality and preserving privacy.\nYou may have to work with Chrome to ensure it’s using system DNS or install an extension that can help block a site or implement a network block on your router outside the app and outside the OS.\n", "Q: How to exclude docker files from time machine backups I don't need back up of my docker files.

Is there any way for an iPad Air to output to the resolution of a 1080p TV (via HDMI converter) that is not app-specific?\nI'm currently using an iPad Air with an adaptor that looks like this:\n\nFrom the comments,\nI am using a 16:9 screen, while the iPad is more of a 4:3 display.\nAs a result, there are black bars to the left and right when output to the television.\n\nA: From the comments and based on actual results,\nthe iPad Air model I have has an output resolution strictly limited to the resolution of the screen.\nAs this screen has a lower resolution than my TV (where the screen is < 1080p), this translates to black bars appearing to the left and the right of the display on the TV.\nIn addition, the output frame rate is noticeably worse with such an output adaptor shown in the original post, showing a 30 FPS video at around 20 FPS.\nThere is no known software fix to this as it is a limitation imposed by the hardware itself.\nAlternatively, I can zoom in the TV to make use of the full screen, at the cost of even worse resolution with the lower output video frame rate even more noticeable.\n\nA: AirPlay can push to 4K resolution but you need an Apple TV or other intermediary. Even plugging the latest    iPad Pro in to USB-C devices that are 4K displays, the OS doesn’t run the resolution you ask. It has to be app specific programming to kick the GPU portion of the Apple Silicon chips to higher resolution via network or USB port.\n\nA: I expect that your iPad Air does in fact have a higher resolution than 1080p (2048x1536px I think), but the general logic in iOS dictates that unless some app-specific work has been done to determine how to treat the external display, it will mirror the device content in a way that reflects the 4:3 aspect ratio.\nIn my experience with an iPad Pro 12.9\" 2nd gen, the default mirroring behaviour means black bars are added not just to the sides, but also the top & bottom of the screen. It seems this may be because of overscan compensation that is applied by default in the OS.\nSome apps (for example Netflix) do use the full extent of the external display.\nI have been developing an app, in which I also take care to display full-resolution content on the external display. Even when ostensibly displaying at 1080p, it was still adding black bars to all sides of the output until I explicitly disabled the overscan compensation (took a while to suss that one out!). What I am now finding, though, is that while the dimensions match, the visual quality of the resulting signal from my device is quite significantly degraded, as if my content had a relatively low-bitrate video encoding applied.\nAccording to this reddit thread, this is due to Lightning being a bottleneck (only USB 2 bandwidth). As such, the content is encoded to mp4 before being decoded by the HDMI adapter.\n", "Q: How to download any file to iPad from a cloud drive through the browser? Is there a way to download files from a cloud drive to the ipad through its browser?\nI made a dummy text file and uploaded to a cloud drive with a public link,\nhttps://tinyurl.com/6whmxito\nand then accessed it through the iPad through both Chrome and Safari.\nThe link works, but I'm not able to download the text file (or any other file).\nThis download-via-browser was also confirmed successful in all other non-apple devices (PC, phone, etc.).\nIs there a step missing?\n\nA: From my findings, it appears that you simply can't download files with any default free browser.\nThe most practical way was to use VLC and transfer the file over WiFi from any other device that supports browser file downloads.\nSteps that made it work were as follows: (https://techlog360.com/wireless-file-transfer-from-pc-to-ipad-iphone/)\n\n*\n\n*Connect iPad to the same WiFi network as the other device.\n\n*Download the file with any other device that supports downloading from a browser.\n\n*On the iPad, install VLC.\n\n*Open VLC, on the Network settings, turn on \"Sharing via WiFi\".\n\n*On the device, open the browser and input the IP address that appeared in the step above.\n\n*Press the + button, select the files from the device, and upload the files.\n\n*The files are then located in \"Files (Apple app) -> On My iPad\".\n\n", "Q: Does restoring a local backup using iTunes enable activation lock?

So basically the account is glued to the device with FMI enabled.\n\n*So then I get a new phone and restore a local iTunes backup that I made of the old phone with the account issue on to the new phone.\n\nFMI shows as enabled on the new phone's settings but I am not sure it's actually enabled. IMEI checker sites such as imeipro show that it's disabled but I want to get your opinion on the matter. I want to format the new phone and worry it too will become activation locked.\nDoes restoring a local backup using iTunes enable activation lock?\n\nA: No, restoring a backup from a device that is locked doesn't lock the new device - devices are locked to accounts, not files in the backup.\nEach device can be tied to find my and data can move between accounts without changing the status of iCloud / Activation / MDM or other locks.\n", "Q: Disabled mac os SIP but still can't delete default apps I'm using mac os 11.2.1 Big Sur. My question concerns using the Terminal utility to delete Apple default apps protected by SIP. I have disabled System Integrity Protection and confirmed that it is off by typing:\ncsrutil\n\nTerminal duly returns \"disabled\" to confirm that SIP is definitely off. I then attempted to delete various Apple default apps, as follows:\nsudo rm -rf FaceTime.app/\n\nsudo rm -rf TV.app/\n\nsudo rm -rf Mail.app/\n\nBut nothing seems to happen. The apps are still in my Applications folder and launch normally. If I try to delete them manually, I get a beep and the deletion is rejected just as if SIP were still enabled.\nCan someone suggest a better way to remove Mail?\n\nA: Big Sur seals the system and signs it cryptographically - deleting parts of the system is no longer as simple as politely asking SIP to stand down for a moment.\nYou might find it far easier to prevent these apps from launching using restrictions or screen time. The effort required to surgically remove apps  is far more than it was in the past.\nHere's how to check if your volume is still sealed before / after trying to tamper with it.\ncsrutil authenticated-root status\n\nHere is an article that goes very deep into which portions of the system you can expect to change and which have added security protection.\n\n*\n\n*https://eclecticlight.co/2020/06/25/big-surs-signed-system-volume-added-security-protection/\n\nIn macOS Mojave 10.14, macOS boots from a single APFS volume, in which sensitive system folders and files are mixed with those which users can write to. The main protections provided to the system come from classical Unix permissions with the addition of System Integrity Protection (SIP)\n\n\nCatalina 10.15 changes that by splitting the boot volume into two: the System and Data volumes, making up an APFS Volume Group. Immutable system files now reside on the System volume, which not only has complete protection by SIP, but is normally mounted read-only.\n\n\nAlthough Big Sur uses the same protected System volume and APFS Volume Group as Catalina, it changes the way that volume is protected to make it an even greater challenge for those developing malicious software: welcome to the Signed System Volume (SSV).\n\nThere is support to make changes to the SSV:\n\n*\n\n*Boot to recovery\n\n*csrutil authenticated-root disable\n\n*Manually mount the correct filesystem - make your changes\n\n*Make a new snapshot and tell the system trust this non-SSV authenticated system. sudo bless --folder /[mountpath]/System/Library/CoreServices --bootefi --create-snapshot\nI don't know a good way to show you how to find your snapshot yet - so you'll need to do some digging and learning and report back if you find a \"cookie cutter\" process that handles things.\n", "Q: I have problem when I make Apple ID using iTunes I have problem when I make an Apple ID using iTunes.\nThe email with a code arrives, but I can not create the id.\n\nWhat are the password complexity rules to get past this error?\n\nA: Basically Apple is saying you need to choose a more complex password.\nCurrently, your Apple ID password must have eight or more characters and include upper and lowercase letters, and at least one number. Apple also uses other password rules to make sure your password isn't easy to guess (things like your name, common words, sequential numbers, etc can be rejected). See Security and your Apple ID for more information.\nI use a password manager (1Password, there are others) that will generate VERY complex passwords, like this:\n1xwEFO6^))hub%$s1\nand all you have to do is unlock it and it generates the password and remembers it for you. So you only have to remember ONE password, the one that unlocks it. Other password managers work the same way.\nSo you will need to create a more complex password before Apple will let you create an account with them. And there is no way around this.\nSo my recommendation? Make a more complex password and get a password manager to help you remember the one's you create.\n", "Q: Which partition do I need to format or fix in order to install Sierra or lion? I have tried in vain to get my MacBook Air back up and running. I did a system restore or reinstall a while back and something broke.\nI've tried command+R and a bootable USB, there doesn’t appear to be a time machine partition or option.\n\n\nWhich partition should I format? Can I clear them all and start from scratch?\nIf someone could show me how to get this issue resolved so I can use my laptop again that’d be great.\n\nA: When restarting your Mac, you may hold Command (⌘)-R to enter your local recovery partition. From there, you should be able to erase and format your internal storage drive (e.g. Macintosh HD) using Disk Utility.\nPlease note that erasing your drive will result in data loss.\nFor macOS Sierra or OS X Mountain Lion, you should erase your drive using a GUID Partition Map and Mac OS Extended (Journaled). For complete steps to erase and format your drive, please refer to How to erase your Intel-based Mac. After erasing your drive, you should proceed with reinstalling macOS.\nIf you've completed the above steps but the same issue occurs, then there may be something wrong with your local recovery partition. You'll want to try the following next steps to access internet recovery (this requires an internet connection):\n\n*\n\n*On an Intel-based Mac, you can use Option-Command-R at startup to upgrade to the latest macOS that is compatible with your Mac, with some exceptions.\n\n\n*On an Intel-based Mac that previously used macOS Sierra 10.12.4 or later, you can use Shift-Option-Command-R at startup to install the macOS that came with your Mac, or the closest version still available.\nIf the above still fails to resolve the issue, you may try creating a bootable installer for macOS using another Mac if necessary.\nIf any issues persist after completing all of the above steps, you may be experiencing a hardware issue. I'd recommend contacting Apple support for further assistance.\n", "Q: How to set up Time Machine to back up to a specific folder in my Synology NAS?

I am using the latest iOS 14.2.  Sometimes, I have some notes or some game that I want to leave open for a while, such as 15 minutes or half an hour, without the screen turning off.\nRight now, it is either 5 minutes or never, so if it is 5 minutes, then I have to keep on operating the iPhone to wake it up every 5 minutes.  If I set it to Never, then I have the risk of putting it aside, and fell asleep or went somewhere, and then wake up with 100% battery running down to 0%.  Is there a way to make it or tweak it to more of a \"moderate\" or medium term, such as 15 minutes or 30 minutes?\n\nA: There's no setting higher than 5 minutes except the \"Never\" setting. So no, you cannot set it to 15 or 30 minutes with the current iOS software.\nNote that the certain apps block turning the screen off while they're running. For example if you're playing a movie in Netflix.\n", "Q: Right click with Voice Control Is it possible to add (or enable a built-in) Voice Control command to perform a Right Click in Mac OS X?\nThat is,  similar to the  built-in \"Single Click\" and \"Double Click\" voice commands.\n\nA: This works for me using the latest version of macOS Big Sur.\nOn my system, all I need to do is speak the phrase “Control Click” and wherever my mouse cursor is at that moment, it performs a Right Click.  However, if I speak the phrase “Show Commands” and search through all of the mouse related commands, I do not see the “Control Click” command listed anywhere.\n", "Q: How to set several siri triggers for the same action (automation) I am someone that is pretty forgetful and don't have the tendency to remember exact sentences that trigger automations on the Shortcuts App.\nThis leads to me having to open the app every time I want to trigger an automation to see what's the name. Because I have to open the app and see the actual sentence I many times just click it instead of just telling Siri the sentence.\nI would like to set several sentences as the triggers for Shortcuts actions so that I can associate more generic sentences to the correct action.\nExample:\nI want to preheat the car.\n\n- \"Hey Siri, preheat the car.\"\n- \"Hey Siri, warmup the car.\"\n- \"Hey Siri, I'm going to drive.\"\n- \"Hey Siri, heat the car.\"\n- \"Hey Siri, cooldown the car.\"\n\nAll of those sentences should trigger the same action. So could I define several sentences as a trigger for the shortcuts when interacting with Siri? Or the only input is exactly what you type in the name of the shortcut action?\n\nA: You could try System Preferences / Keyboard / Text.\nClick + below to add a new text shortcut. Choose something short and easy to remember. Then define the longer, full version.\nperhaps you could somehow trigger the shorter version with Siri (one that's easy to remember), and that would trigger the longer, full version.\nYou might be able to set this up using Soundflow (automation platform that works with all apps, not just music), or Keyboard Maestro.\n", "Q: brew: create install script for all installed packages/casks I am currently planning to reinstall my OS from scratch.

An article says that iOS apps have been caught reading data from user's clipboards:\n\nresearchers found the following iOS apps were reading users’ clipboard data every time the app was opened with no clear reason for doing so:\n\n*\n\n*ABC News — com.abcnews.ABCNews\n\n*Al Jazeera English — ajenglishiphone\n\n*CBC News — ca.cbc.CBCNews\n\n*CBS News — com.H443NM7F8H.CBSNews\n\n*CNBC — com.nbcuni.cnbc.cnbcrtipad\n\n*Fox News — com.foxnews.foxnews\n\n\n(51 more apps not shown for brevity)\nQuestion\nAre all iOS apps able to read the iPhone clipboard, and if so, how can I get a list of which apps are doing it, and be notified each time they do it?\nAlso note\nBy extension, macOS's 'handoff' feature allows apple devices share clipboards when within 10 feet of each other. So in addition to being able to read the iPhone's clipboard, are these iOS apps also able to read the user's MacBook's clipboard (whenever it's within 10 feet, as demonstrated in the youtube link below)?\n\n*\n\n*This demonstrates how an iOS app with access to the clipboard can read not only the clipboard on the iPhone/iPad, but also on any MacBook or Mac within 10 feet (via 'handoff', which is 'On' by default on macOS devices).\n\n\nA: Any iOS can always access the clipboard, there isn't really a way to prevent this from happening. Recent iOS versions show a little info box at the top of the screen when this happens so you should be at least aware if an app does this \"in the background\".\nPS: An app can not access clipboards on other devices. What happens with Handoff is that the clipboards are synced across devices by the OSes (macOS and iOS) in the background so that at the moment an app access the clipboard it may get the content you just copied into it a few seconds ago on your Mac.\n", "Q: MacOS - Manually open as read only I hope this is not a repeat question—searching mostly turned up various versions of people having the opposite problem.\nIs there a way to manually open a file as read-only?\nThe use case would be a file that I generally want write access to, but on a particular occasion want to be very confident I won't accidentally modify.

The results show up inside the AppleScript Result window, but this clears the Clipboard... Does anyone know why AppleScript is clearing the clipboard when using pbcopy in a do shell script command?\n\nA: If you are just trying to replace the - with ▸, then here is how I'd do it:\nNote that in the example AppleScript code the first and last lines of it are for testing to actually set the expected content of the clipboard to work with, obviously they are not needed in the working code.\nExample AppleScript code:\nset the clipboard to \"# 6C (d1/s2): F 11-12 100 Fly (1:12.95Y)\"\n\nset cbText to (the clipboard as text)\n\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to \"-\"\nset cbText to text items of cbText\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to \"▸\"\nset cbText to cbText as text\nset AppleScript's text item delimiters to \"\"\n\nset the clipboard to cbText\n\nreturn (the clipboard)\n\n\nResult:\n# 6C (d1/s2): F 11▸12 100 Fly (1:12.95Y)\n\n\nOn a side note, the issue appears to be with the | pbcopy segment of the command.\nHere is another workaround:\nAssuming # 6C (d1/s2): F 11-12 100 Fly (1:12.95Y) is what's on the clipboard, then:\nset the clipboard to ¬\n    (do shell script \"pbpaste | gsed 's/\\\\x2D/\\\\xE2\\\\x96\\\\xB8/g'\")\n\nResults in # 6C (d1/s2): F 11▸12 100 Fly (1:12.95Y) being on the clipboard.\n\nA: While @user3439894 did present a workaround solution I did find the answer to the pbcopy issue with help from a user on Reddit. Hope this provides help at some point in the future.\n\nPiping to pbcopy is the correct approach. Since do shell script does not run your login shell (see Technical Note TN2065), you have to\nsupply the locale as an environment variable. For Canadian English:\n\ndo shell script \"pbpaste | gsed 's/\\\\x2D/\\\\xE2\\\\x96\\\\xB8/g'| LANG=en_CA.UTF-8 pbcopy\"\n\n\nor\nFor current system language:\n\ndo shell script \"pbpaste | gsed 's/\\\\x2D/\\\\xE2\\\\x96\\\\xB8/g'| LANG=\" & user locale of (system info) & \".UTF-8 pbcopy\"\n\n\nThis caused me quite a lot of confusion when I was making some\nclipboard-modifying handlers. And for reference, I found that you're\nmuch better off using pbpaste/pbcopy than using the built-in commands\nfrom StandardAdditions as these have their own quirks.\n\nSo making a small adjustment to their solution results in:\ndo shell script \"pbpaste | gsed 's/\\\\x2D/\\\\xE2\\\\x96\\\\xB8/g' | LANG=en_US.UTF-8 pbcopy\"\n\n", "Q: How do I remove Legacy System Extensions manually?

I use the “Apple TV Remote” app to control my Apple TV 4K (A1842). From Settings I can see that I have version 2.2 (344.28) of the app (it’s called merely “Remote” in there, but the info screen confirms it is “Apple TV Remote”).\nI can access the app in three different ways:\n\n*\n\n*Via its icon in the Control Center (this is my normal method)\n\n*By telling Siri to ”Open Apple TV Remote”\n\n*By tapping the app’s icon (labelled “Remote”) on my iPhone\n\nHOWEVER: the main screen I get using method 1 looks different from what I get with the other two methods. They look like the following, with method 1 producing the first view and methods 2 and 3 producing the second view:\n\n\nIt almost looks like the first method is running a different app from the other two methods.\nHowever, if I go to Settings>Control Center and see what remote app is in there, I find that it is called Apple TV Remote.\nSo, what’s going on? When I go into Control Center and tap on what Settings claims is Apple TV Remote, why do I get something different from what I get if I tell Siri to open Apple TV Remote (or if I simply find the Remote app and choose it).\nThanks!\n\nA: They are different \"apps\".  The one in Control Center is not even a full-fledged app.  You can't switch to it, or close it, like regular apps.  I think I end up using the one from the Control Center more, since it's easy to launch, and I think that's the one that integrates better with Apple Watch (I can use my watch to control the ATV, if I start the remote on my phone first).\nNotice the multiple uses of the word \"think\".  This is not an obvious design choice by Apple.  The Control Center icon should just call a single full app, just like if you click on the Camera, Alarm, etc, in the Control Center.\n", "Q: Sublime Text is autocorrecting “^” I use Sublime Text 3 for my LaTeX coding.

This post here seems to refer to adding this autocorrection, but again is tough for me to understand what is going on.\n\nA: I would suggest you try turning off spell check.

Since updating to macOS Big Sur, I can no longer print to my HP DeskJet 1010 printer. Each time that I start a print job, I get a dialog with error message that says '\"HPDM.framework\" will damage your computer'. There is no way to bypass the warning in 'System Preferences' -> 'Security & Privacy' as there might be with applications that have expired or invalid developer certificates.\nN.B. I did find a workaround that involved removing the printer from 'System Preferences' -> 'Printers & Scanners' then adding it again with generic print drivers, but this blocked me from using some of the features I typically use, such as printing with just the black cartridge.\n\nA: After much trial and error, I was finally able to get my HP DeskJet 1010 printer working again with the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*Download and run the HP Uninstaller app\n\n*Download and install HP Printer Drivers v5.1 for macOS\n\n*Open 'System Preferences' -> 'Printers & Scanners', right-click the box labeled 'Printers' and select 'Reset printing system...' (if you have more than one printer, you may want to remove just the non-functioning profile by selecting it and clicking the '-' button).\n\n*Click the '+' button to add a new printer, select 'HP DeskJet Series', and follow the prompts.\n\nIt is my suspicion that this will work with other HP printers affected by their revoked developer certificate.\n", "Q: My wireguard install has broken and I'm unable to fix it Since I've installed Wireguard on my MacBook Air running MacOS Sierra it hasn't given me any major problems until now.

In fact, here is someone on the Norton forum seeing the same thing. It's possible that you have a daily scan in the 5-6pm timeframe which hits this bug.\n\n*\n\n*If you’re not already running the latest version of Norton AntiVirus, update to the latest.\n\n*If you are on the latest version and this panic continues to happen, uninstall Norton AntiVirus. Specifically, this means making sure that its four kernel extensions are uninstalled. You can verify via kextstat | grep com.symantec.\n\n*If the panic continues after uninstalling Norton, uninstall your other KEXTs (Black Magic, Soundflower, SoundGrabber).\n\n*If panics continue, we can start to debug them by adding symbolication to your panic output: Disable SIP, run sudo nvram boot-args=\"kextsyms=1\", reboot, and collect & upload a new panic report.\n\n", "Q: Are kernel extensions also stored elsewhere? I discovered a kernel extension earlier in this path \"/Library/Application\\ Support/VirtualBox/VBoxDrv.kext\".\nWhat confuses me a bit, are extensions not saved in /Library/Extension?\n\nA: KEXT files can reside in 3 locations:\n\n*\n\n*Within an application bundle (XXX.app)\n\n*Within an application's sub-directory inside /Library/Application Support\n\n*And inside /Library/Extensions\nGenerally where the app developer chooses to place the kext files depends on the app itself and what makes sense for it (eg. how it stores local data, how frequently a kext might need to be updated, etc).\nKext files related to system functions, like network adapter or mouse drivers, will almost always be inside /Library/Extensions as those are loaded on startup.

Samba, Github ( https://github.com/rsyncOSX ), and Homebrew (I saw one page describing it as a package manager) all the same program?  Or is there some difference (maybe some are forks of others, for example)?\nWhat is Samba from the perspective of a personal computer running OSX?\n\nA: When you install rsync through HomeBrew an additional patch with a bugfix is applied to the code before it is compiled and installed on your system. You will not (automatically) get this patch when installing manually from a .tar.gz.\nHomeBrew also ensures to install dependencies easily. You will have to do that manually when doing it yourself.\nFinally HomeBrew makes it easier to uninstall rsync again, if you do not need it anymore.\nThe software offered on rsync.samba.org and installed in the guide you link is almost identical to the software installed through HomeBrew, except for the extra patch I mentioned.\nThe software on GitHub you link to is actually not rsync. It is a graphical user interface for rsync, that requires you to have rsync installed in advance.\nRegarding Samba: rsync as such does not have anything to do with the software package named \"Samba\" - so there's no \"Samba\" involved in running rsync on your personal computer.\nThe reason why the rsync program is offered through a web site hosted on samba.org is probably just that one of the original creators of the rsync program (Andrew Tridgell) also happens to be original creator of the Samba software package.\n", "Q: Network services deleted via terminal reenabled after Restart I have written a shell script to remove all services excluding ethernet.

This also happens with just running the terminal command  networksetup deletepppoeservice [servicename]\nI presume there is a plist somewhere that repopulates these entries, however I have deleted networkInterfaces.plist to no effect.\nHere is the code snippet in question:\nSERVICE=\"Ethernet\"\nfor NETSERV in ${networkService[@]}; do\n    if [[ \"$NETSERV\" != \"$SERVICE\" ]]; then\n        networksetup deletepppoeservice \"$NETSERV\";\n    fi\ndoneSERVICE=\"Ethernet\"\nfor NETSERV in ${networkService[@]}; do\n    if [[ \"$NETSERV\" != \"$SERVICE\" ]]; then\n        networksetup deletepppoeservice \"$NETSERV\";\n    fi\ndone\n\nThe goal:\n\nThanks.\n\nA: So the solution that I stumbled on was to lock the file using chflags uchg /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist so whatever was modifying it back was denied. Oddly, it was a root owned file so whatever was modding it was root.\nI ran sudo fs_usage | grep /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist and saw no write or modify commands so it had to happen on boot or login.\n", "Q: How to always allow any app to do anything / disable Security & Privacy authorization dialogues Currently on macOS Catalina.\nI work in sound design and audio development. I use several Automator-scripts and other workflow applications to control various stuff, and for every new project or when I make any change in any AppleScript, I get a nagging dialogue to \"Allow for Keystrokes\", \"Allow for Accessibility\", etc. Sometimes I have to re-authorize all my automator scripts after changing a single line in one of them.\nThis is killing my workflow, and this was implemented in macOS Mojave and forward with the new Privacy and Integrity-routines. On High Sierra this was never a problem, which was the system I used before.\nI need to disable this permanently. I want any app to make any change it want. I know the risks, but I don't care. It is not a problem for me running an isolated systems with absolute control over all apps I use. I never install anything new, it's an audio workstation with bare minimum applications installed.\nI've tried Disabling SIP, didn't help. Adding an application to \"Full disk access\" still makes me have to authorized it in all other fields. Sometimes, when I use application A to control application B, if doing changes in App A, the option to again authorize it to control B never shows up, and is not available.\nQuestion is: Does anyone know how I can globally disable the Security & Privacy check in macOS Catalina so that any application I start can control/do whatever it want? If there's no \"official\" setting, is there no way to hack the underlying preferences or similar?\nmacOS should have a power user mode.\n\nA: The only solution that I know of is to approach the problem from another direction.\nWriting all of your own Automator apps (which are going to continually run into this problem), and trying to find loopholes to make them work? That's going to be a losing battle.\nYou might be able to solve this with SD Notary: Notarizing Made Easy from the folks who make Script Debugger. Honestly, I don't know, but it might be worth checking out.\nWhat I would be doing is using Keyboard Maestro to handle the automation. Once Keyboard Maestro has been given the proper authorizations, it can handle any of these situations (I presume, since you don't give specifics, I can't say 100%).\nThen you will have one centralized place where you can control and manage all of these various automation actions, as well as a community where you can ask for help as you learn the ropes.\n\nmacOS should have a power user mode.\n\nI agree wholeheartedly. 100%. No doubt.\nBut it doesn't, and I suspect it is very unlikely to add one.\nThat being said, I think Keyboard Maestro is the closest you can get to a Power User Mode on the Mac. No, it's not from Apple (I doubt they could make anything as good), but I'm not aware of anything that will give you more power and flexibility.\n(Non-Disclaimer: I'm just a user of the app. I don't get paid, compensated, rewarded, or anything else in exchange for my endorsement and recommendation. I just happily give the developer my money whenever a new version comes out.)\n\nA: The answer is in this knowledge base article\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/mac-help/mchl07817563/mac\nYou need to allow the apps to allow control of other apps in the Privacy Settings. If you edit your Automator App, you may need to once again grant access.\n", "Q: Connect one device with Bluetooth I have some wireless earphones which I want to use with my Macbook Pro, iPad and iPhone. Every time I want to switch the Apple device to connect to, however, I need to turn off Bluetooth to the previously used device. Is there any way to avoid this?\n\nA: If you have airpods apple just started supported automatic device switching with the newest software versions (fall 2020). Here is a link to read more about it,\nhttps://www.imore.com/airpods-automatic-device-switching\nIf you don't have airpods and new devices then you may be out of luck for now. Some other bluetooth devices use a button to switch between paired profiles but most don't in my experience. If the devices are all in different rooms it would be one thing but if you have them all on your desk then it is a harder problem. I will say you can disconnect from a bluetooth device without turning off bluetooth but often just as cumbersome a task.\n", "Q: How do I prevent the Mac from sleeping while on display sleep on battery power? \nSo while on battery power you have the option to prevent the computer from sleeping when display is off. How ever this option is only available while on power adapter. Is there a way to do this on battery power? Prevent computer from sleeping when display is of but on battery power? thank you in advance\n\nA: ‎Amphetamine is a free application that will give you a lot of power and flexibility about keeping your Mac awake under various conditions.\nIt has been around for a number of years and considered very trustworthy. I would recommend it without reservation.\n‎Amphetamine even has an option to disable itself when the battery reaches a certain percentage, which will reduce the chance that you will unwittingly run the battery to 0% (it is not generally advisable to run the battery fully empty). Obviously, the final choice is up to you.\n\nA: It seems that simply disabling Turn display off after and Put hard disks to sleep when possible under System Preferences > Battery > Battery has been sufficient for me to disable sleeping while on battery power.\n\nA: You have two options, depending on whether you want a temporary or permanent change in behavior:\n\n*\n\n*Disable system sleep when on battery: sudo pmset -b sleep 0. This setting persists across reboots.\n\n*Run caffeinate in a Terminal window during periods of time when you don't want the system to sleep.\n\n", "Q: Duplicate app icons in the Dock Sometimes when opening apps I get duplicate icons in the Dock for that app. This isn't really a problem, however I'm curious why macOS does this (I suppose this is more of a technical question).\nThis happens a lot especially with VS Code where I often launch the app with the code utility in the Terminal.\nWhy does macOS think these are different apps when they're the same binary?\n\n\nA: I don't have a specific answer as to what causes macOS to do this, however there is an issue on the VS Code GitHub repository which has lots of discussions about this (for VS Code app at least).\nIt seems to have something to do with launching an app directly (executing the binary inside XYZ.app/Contents/MacOS) instead of via Launch Services (the open command).\n\nA: Passing the -n flag when using the open command opens multiple instances of an app. For example, running open -n -a Terminal several times will open multiple instances of the terminal app, as seen below\n\n\nA: Just dropping in here the solution mentioned in the issue pointed by @Decade Moon for easy reference.\nApparently to avoid launching multiple VS Code instances you must use the Finder \"open\" interface instead of calling the VS code binary directly. This can be achieved by setting up an alias in your .zshrc or .bashrc like:\n# Opening VS Code with Finder open so it is referenced as the same program in dock\nalias code=\"open -b

You're getting a KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE at 0x7ffeeccd3ff8 because you've overflowed the maximum stack size and you're trying to write to a protected region (the illegal address is just above Stack in the STACK GUARD region, which was created expressly to catch situations like this).\nThis happened because there was a highly recursive function call chain and it simply exceeded the 512 frame (8192 KB) default stack limit (see ulimit -s). From the looks of the recursed frames (ZEND_DO_FCALL_SPEC_RETVAL_USED_HANDLER() over and over), I'd guess that it's php code (either yours or the unit testing framework) which is recursing, rather than the C code of the interpreter itself.\nIf you aren't sure where the recursion is occurring, one temporary workaround would be to raise the stack limit of the php process using ulimit(1) and run your command again in the same Terminal window:\nulimit -s 65532\n./phpunit --group Jobs_model\n\nThis will run your test with a 64 MB stack limit. Note that the kernel specifies a maximum upper stack limit of 64 MB:\n#define DFLSSIZ         (8*1024*1024)           /* initial stack size limit */\n\n#define MAXSSIZ         (64*1024*1024)          /* max stack size */\n\nso if your recursion is way huge, you'll still run out of space.

For years I have always kept OS and data on separate drives or at least separate partitions.  That always made backups and moving data to new machines simple for me.  This time I struggled to create that same arrangement, but it proved too difficult.\nI sat down recently to attempt to resolve the mess I created.  It appears I had created a 1.05 TB and a .95 TB partition on the SSD.  The 1.05 TB partition contained a \"container\" that contained my OS and data in a couple of \"volumes\".  The remaining .95 TB partition of the SSD was simply a wasteland.\nOver the last couple of days I have made numerous attempts to erase/reformat any or all of the SSD but the Disk Utility simply will not allow any of that (erase is ghosted).  I have tried changing the size of the first partition, but Disk Utility will not allow that either.  Next I tried a few things with diskutil in terminal but do not seem to be making any progress there either.  Command + R and Command + Option + R did not work for me because Disk Utility there only shows disk0/OS X Base System, neither of which can be erased, and Reinstall OS X cannot find any drive at all for the install.\nSo, in summary, help!  If I do a diskutil list in Terminal I see disk0 thru disk13... and that can't be right.  I want to reformat and start over but nothing seems to get me there.  Currently there is no important data on this machine.  Oh, laptop still works fine, I just can't live with system and data on same partition.\nSome of my symptoms sound similar to Redrighthand's \"MacBook-pro Internal PCIe Samsung 512g SSD no longer recognized on MBP (mid 2015 15\" A1398)\".\nThanks in advance for any help.  First screenshot below of diskutil list taken in recovery mode, second screenshot taken of terminal after normal boot.  Last two screenshots are of Disk Utility...\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Turns out the obvious answer was always right in front of me.  I simply did not know enough about the changes made recently to move away from partitions and embrace containers and volumes.  After more study/research I decided I still prefer keeping my data completely away from OS, and therefore partitions over containers for my way of working (bought 1st computer in 1982, built/used/upgraded/repaired numerous PCs until purchased 1st Apple in 2012).\nSo, I created a 16Gig bootable thumb drive and followed Apple's instructions at  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372.

Screen Sharing (and other vnc clients) allow me to select a single display (or view both at once), but neither work well because if I view a single screen then windows will open on the other one, alerts will pop up, etc. It's also basically impossible to use with both displays shown at once on a 13in laptop screen.\nI'm looking for a way to software disable one of the monitors so that I can switch to a single display when I need to.\n\nA: I finally found a solution: the open source project DisableMonitor 3.1 let's you easily disable, enable or change the resolution of all monitors attached to your Mac. It supports macOS 10.15 Catalina and Big Sur (Intel) 11.1.\nDisableMonitor 3.1 is a fork of the original project DisableMonitor, which is no longer maintained.\n\nA: I presume that you switch between local and remote use frequently enough that disconnecting the second screen is not a viable solution?\nOne workaround would be to set your secondary display to mirror the main display. This would effectively reduce the 2 monitors to one logical display.\n", "Q: 2010 27\" iMac - ambient sensor connection on cpu fan 2010 27\" iMac - regarding the ambient sensor connection on cpu fan housing - What is the proper contact position of the sensor with relation to the bracket that secures/holds the sensor in place?\n\nA: The image below was taken from page 238 of the Apple Technician Guide iMac (27-inch, Mid 2010).

Or do I need to keep the app open?\nFor example, some apps like Microsoft Outlook must stay open in order to be notified about e-mails, therefore this is not necessarily something which is not needed to be said.\nIdeally, is there any official or reliable source that says this?

I've been having the same issue and I suspect the reason you've not gotten an effective answer to your question is you mentioned 'invoices' and were likely getting disappointed that queries for amounts just never returned anything.\nTo get Apple mail to return the emails containing numeric values in the message body you need to put the amount or number in double quotes.

Been having several seemingly unrelated problems with a new (2019) MacBook Pro (MBP).  All of them seem more like software than hardware (as a retired software engineer with ten years as an electronics tech prior, I should be able to judge).\nFour or five days ago, all four external disks dismounted and will not remount.  Disk Utility and diskutil and the system info app says there are no disks connected.\nSince this is one of those USB-C only Macs, I had a multiport adapter hub connected to two of the ports, and the USB-A for the disk drives plugged into that.  The cable goes to a seven-port separately powered hub which in turn went to the four drives.  Three of them were powered by the hub, and according to the lights, still get power.  The other has it's own power connection and does have a light on.  The room was unoccupied with a door closed, so no one could have bumped any cables.\nThinking that the adapter hub may have failed, I shut down MacOS, unplugged one of the drives and plugged it into a second USB-A on the adapter.  Booted the MBP; still no drives.\nSwapped the two cables of that drive and the seven-port hub on the two ports of the adapter hub.  Still nothing.  Unplugged the seven-port hub and plugged in a DVD drive that needs USB power.  It worked and tried to play a DVD.  So the adapter hub is presumed OK.\nDisconnected all from the new MBP.  Got out a \"retired\" 2012 MBP with Catalina that had last year used all four drives with the same seven-port hub.  Plugged in the seven-port hub to that and powered it on.  After logging in, looked for external drives in Finder and in Disk Utility.  NONE!\nSo apparently, Big Sur did something to all four drives while I was out of the room that made all of them unrecognizable.  Is there another explanation?  Is there any way to not lose those backups?\nUPDATE: I suspected the MBP and/or Big Sur, since so many other problems appeared when I got them.  But this one appears to be the seven-port hub.\nPossibly related but not duplicates (some symptoms different):\nUSB drives connected to hub disppearing\n\nA: The answer is probably No.  I looked at the USB chain with System Info and found that both machines can see all the USB ports and hubs including the one that I forgot is built into the Seagate drive (which has two unused USB-A ports on it).\nI then connected three of them to the adapter hub, and they mounted.\nRemoved the seven-port hub completely.  Plugged the large Seagate and the small older drive into the two-port adapter hub.  Then the two other drives into the hub built into the Seagate.  All mounted.\nSo, somehow, the seven-port hub (after more than a year with no problems) prevented any of the drives connected to it from being recognized as drives. \nPuzzling how a hub can provide power and allow something downstream to be recognized as another hub, yet not allow it to be recognized as a disk.  Perhaps that merits a separate question.\n", "Q: Draw in Preview If I want to draw something in the Preview app, then for example odd lines become straight or something that resembles a circle becomes a circle. How can I turn this feature off?\n\n\nA: There should be two quite similar icons for two different operations. You are describing 'Sketch' behavior. What you need is 'Draw' next to it.\n\n", "Q: Error in Virtual Box: Failed to open a session for the virtual machine I want to install Ubuntu 20.10 on Virtual Box 6.1.18, when I create the virtual machine is okay so I press start but when I want to search the ISO file this error appears to me.\n\nI saw different solutions in the terminal for Windows, but any for Mac helped me. Downgrade Virtual Box isn't an option because my professor requires this version.\n\nA: The solution is just choose your ISO file not from start button, instead choose from Settings/Storage/Controller: IDE\n", "Q: When searching for an app on my iPhone I get a black, blank screen On my iPad, if I want to search for a specific app, I pull down from the top of my homescreen.

It seems that the iOS simulator draws a black line (representing the real-life microphone?) at the bottom of it, even though it should be on the \"right wall\" if you hold the phone like that.\n\n\nIs this problem on my end (my code, etc.) or is it just a bug with the iOS simulator? This problem persists on other iPhone models as well.\nI used Expo and React-Native to make this app.\n\nA: In fact your assumption that there is a 'problem' is incorrect. This has nothing to do with your code, nor does the line represent the real-life microphone.\nThe black line you describe is displayed at the bottom of the screen by iOS to users to indicate they can swipe up from there.\nThis line can be either black or white, depending on what else is being displayed on the screen. The iOS Simulator is accurately simulating what will be seen by users on an actual hardware device.\n", "Q: How to setup two completely separate partitions on one SSD I have a MacBook with 1TB SSD.\nI want to have two separate partitions with two independent macOS installations.\nI want to make sure that none of the partitions have any kind of possibility to interact with the other, I want them to be as separated as if they were physically separate.\nIs this achievable with, for example, FileVault for each of them?\nEdit: My question is neither \"how can I install two different macOS versions on two different partitions on one SDD\", neither \"how do I use FileVault\", etc. I know how to do all of that.\nI want to make sure that there is no interaction between the partitions possible. Can this be made sure with the above approach? Is it sufficient?\n\nA: No, since Apple designs the OS to be able to erase itself and undo any logical partition you make - anyone with moderate amount of time or technical ability can access the drive.\nYour only play with shared storage is to trust encryption and separation of secrets. But that is flimsy protection if system B can always read, erase and modify system A storage. You don’t gain any data or interaction protection with two OS, you only gain complexity and two code bases and less protection overall.\nThe OS is always aware of the entire storage chain for all attached drives. You need external drives, two of them, to guarantee your “there is no interaction between the partitions possible” clause.\nBut, as long as you are on Catalina or higher, there’s never been a better time to dual boot two macOS systems on the same SSD. You can try it out and see if you can live with two OS and experiment if spotlight will find files and apps on the other system based on how you set things up. But this won’t make things more secure, it makes things less secure in several ways.\n\nA: The answer is no.  Assume I install some software with admin rights on partition B. It can not be made sure, that the program installed on B has no possibility to ask the diskutil to remove entirely partition A.\nUpdate\nMaybe this explanation will make more sense to you. Originally with OS X, many problems could be fixed by booting to the OS X installation DVD. Security existed by storing the DVD somewhere safe. After Snow Leopard, Apple stopped issuing DVDs and instead opted for software downloads. A recovery volume was added to take the place of using the DVD to fix problems. The recovery volume contain limited functionality compared to a full OS X operating system. However, when booted to the recovery volume, changes could be made that are not normally possible when booted to OS X. This concept of recovery has been refined with each new release up to and including the release of macOS Big Sur. Along the way, Apple has taken many steps to prevent booting to recovery without first requiring user validation.\nInstalling a second macOS in a different partition creates in effect an extremely powerful version of recovery. So when booted to the second macOS, you are going to be able to mess with the first macOS, just as if you had booted to recovery. For example, SIP only applies to the partition of the currently booted macOS. The files in the other macOS are no longer protected by SIP. The same is true, if you were to install, then boot to Windows or Linux on your Mac.\nThe best way to protect your Mac is to only have one operation system installed. Once you install a second operating system,  you open up security vulnerabilities that Apple has not begun to address.\n", "Q: Difference Between Duplicating? is there a difference between \"exactly duplicate\" and \"duplicate\"?\nFile> Duplicate / Exactly Duplicate\n\nA: Taken from the answer the OP added to the question:\n\nWhen a directory or a file is duplicated, the (access) rights of the original file are usually not copied and the new file is owned by the copying user. However, if a Mac is used by several users or if network drives are involved, it can make sense not to make a file accessible to everyone.  To do this, right-click on a file, press OptShift and select \"Duplicate exactly\". This ensures that owner and access rights are copied as well.\n\n", "Q: Connect iPhone Lightning Headphones to Mac 2014 (standard headphone jack) I have a Mac 2014 with the standard headphone jack.  My headphones have the Lightning connector.   Ive spent 30 minutes trying to find a converter but no luck so figured I'd try here on Stack. Closest I came was this Anker Piece but thats for USB-C (newer mac)\nPicture below \n\nA: I'd say one does not exist.\nThe reasoning behind you being able to find an adaptor from USB-C to lightning is that both are digital connections. I'm not sure what, if any, data translation would need to be done, but if it was necessary USB-C can carry the power to do it. (Similarly for the lightning to audio cable supplied with the iPhones).\nTo do the same from a regular headphone socket would need the adaptor to carry two-way DACs (digital analogues converters) to & from the earphones & mic, & would also have to be battery-powered, as it can't take power from the headphone socket on the Mac.\nIt's not impossible to do that, but it would be costly. It seems so far, no-one is willing to see if the consumer would be prepared to pay the price.\n", "Q: How many 27\" Thunderbolt Displays does the 2020 M1 Mac mini support? Apple's website does state that \"One display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz connected via Thunderbolt\" so it's probably not possible as per this question regarding how M1 powered MacBooks supporting only a single 27\" Thunderbolt Display as follows:\n\nHowever, would an M1 Mac mini support dual 27\" Thunderbolt Displays if connected as follows?\n\nIf they cannot be daisy chained via Thunderbolt 1 would a second Thunderbolt Adapter perhaps change things if used as follows:\n\nI've seen how the M1 can be connected up to 6x displays in total using Display Link. However, I'm specifically interested in using the 2x 27\" Thunderbolt displays I already have.\nIf you've got this working with a Mac mini, please share your experience. Thunderbolt 1x supported daisy chaining up to 6x 27\" Thunderbolt displays and it would be very interesting to know if this is at all a possibility?\n\nA: Neither of those two suggested display configurations are possible, I'm afraid. You can only connect 1 of the 27\" Thunderbolt displays to the Thunderbolt 3 ports on the M1 Mac Mini. It doesn't matter if you daisy chain two monitors or plug them into each of their own Thunderbolt 3 ports - it still won't work.\nThe only way to natively hook up 2 displays to the M1 Mac Mini is to drive one display (and one display only) through the Thunderbolt 3 port and the other through the HDMI port. Obviously the 27\" Thunderbolt Display does not connect with the HDMI port.\nWhen I say natively, I mean that it is ofcourse possible to use non-native display options - most popular would be a variety of DisplayLink products.\nAdapters such as this do exist that converts the HDMI output to a USB-C style DisplayPort output. I guess you could plug a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter into that, but I doubt that it would work.\n", "Q: Wifi dongle stopped working as soon a I upgraded to MacOS Big Sur 11 version My wifi dongle is not working on Big Sur. Whenever I tried to install the software that came with the wifi dongle, I get a message that the drive is incompatible. I was using a Wifi dongle from this company called Cuddy and when I contacted them, they said they are not sure when are they going to have a compatible driver for the same.\nI found a similar post related to this over here when someone faced similar issue when Big sur was in beta phase.\nAnd I was looking at Gummibando's answer where he mentioned the following:\n\nWhile macOS 11 is in development, you can enable the loading of deprecated KEXTs by disabling SIP. See https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-big-sur-11-beta-release-notes (Deprecations).\n\nHowever, the link is not working anymore. Any other solution to solve this issue?\n\nA: While Apple hasn't realeased an official date for when third party kexts, they have been phasing them out for over a year now and over time the list of depreciated kexts is growing.\nFor now I believe that you can boot into recovery mode using Command and R, and then running csrutil disable in the terminal to disable SIP.\nThis is more like a temporary hotfix than a solution and I would advise getting a new dongle if your manufacturer does not keep up.\n", "Q: To to stop Skype on iPhone & Mac competing for AirPods' connection? I long for the days of 3.5mm connections and headphones that connect directly to the audio source.\nVery often (~20%) on a Skype call, my AirPods fail to connect to the correct device. Which leaves me on a conference call that everyone around me can hear.\nHere is specifically what happens:\n\n*\n\n*Skype rings (iPhone & Mac)\n\n*I answer the call on Mac\n\n*I hear that connecting sound on the AirPods\n\n*The Mac shows \"connected AirPods\"\n\n*I hear another connecting sound on the AirPods\n\n*The Mac shows \"moved to nearby device\"\n\n*The iPhone stops ringing\n\n*I select bluetooth/AirPods and/or sound menu/AirPods\n\n*I hear another connecting sound on the AirPods\n\n*The Mac shows \"connected to AirPods\"\n\n*The audio from the Skype call is playing through the Mac speakers\n\n*I open Skype preferences/audio and select AirPods\n\n*50/50 the AirPods will play the audio, or I need to restart Skype and start over\n\nInstead this is what I want:\n\n*\n\n*Skype rings (iPhone & Mac)\n\n*I answer the call on Mac\n\n*I can start talking\n\n\nPossibly related and more general questions that did not answer this:\n\n*\n\n*How to make AirPods connect automatically to the correct device?\n\n*AirPods connect to correct device\n\n*Can you answer a call with AirPods faster than EarPods?\n\n*Airpods connect to iPhone perfectly but disconnect from MacBook after a few seconds\n\n*How do I stop my Mac from ringing when I get a phone call on my iPhone?\n\nA: Go to System Preferences → Bluetooth and for your AirPods choose Options and set ‘Connect to This Mac’ to ‘When Last Connected to This Mac’.\n\nNow your AirPods won't automatically switch away from your iPhone to your Mac. Make the equivalent change on your iPhone to stop the other way round.\nThen your AirPods will always connect to the last device and you can manually select your AirPods from the Bluetooth or Sound menu to connect them to your desired device.\n", "Q: If Linux is installed in a virtual environment on my mac can I open apps that big sur blocks? I'm trying open this application: http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~lucag/ (It's a research tool might might be great for my work so I really want to access it).\nWhen I try and open the app I get the message: \"You do not have permission to open the application \"ECGWorkbench'. Contact your computer or network administrator for assistance.\"\nIf I installed Linux in a virtual environment on my mac could I then open the the Linux version of the app?\n\nA: Yes, if you have Linux installed in a virtualised environment that you control on your Mac - then you could install applications in there. Restrictions on running applications within macOS using Apple's MDM system would not apply to applications within the virtualised Linux system.\nNote that this all presumes that you have already got Linux up and running in a virtualised environment. If the owner of your laptop denies running most programs, they most probably also deny the installation of virtualisation software.\n\nA: The answer would be yes from an OS view, as the Linux VM would be a self contained system. However, beware of ports blocked by your proxy or any firewall filtering however, as the application could be denied access to external resources by the network your host machine is on.\n", "Q: Managed Software Center - update not updating I have a Brother printer (model: Brother MFC-J475DW) which works fine.

Currently, I just keep it minimized.\n\n\nA: Managed Software Center would only be installed if this is your work computer. A lot of organisations would have things set up so you can only install updates when you are either at your workplace, or connected to their network via VPN.\n", "Q: MacOS kernel panics when unmounting Time Machine disk images over SSHFS mount I made a simple Bash script to back up my Mac through Time Machine over network. It mounts a server through SSHFS using MacFUSE, mounts a HFS+ sparsebundle disk image inside that mount, and tells Time Machine to back up to it, unmounting them when it's done. It usually works just fine, but a kernel panic happens about once in every 6 or so times when it tries to unmount the sparsebundle disk image. The kernel panics seemed to happen both in MacOS Catalina and Big Sur. The same problem never changed even when I changed from a Macbook Air late 2015 to a 2020 MacBook Pro, so I believe the Mac hardware might be irrelevant.\nIs there a way to tell if this is a problem relating to the Apple DiskImages driver, the MacFUSE kernel extension, or something different?

myself with sudden removal of a disk image backing store. It's a bug in the macOS disk image driver, not MacFUSE (MacFUSE wasn't installed on my machine). You should report the panic to Apple. Giving them readily reproducible steps will be key to fixing the issue.\n", "Q: Monitor Mac external USB SSD wear? What is the best way to monitor the wear of my new external USB boot SSD? I'd like to order a new one to have ready before it gets too slow.  I have WD Blue and love the speed, and it worked perfectly the first time.\nAlso, I turned on TRIM via \"sudo trimforce enable\".  Was that a good idea with WD Blue?\nThanks.\n\nA: If your external disk interface supports it, a good tool is to use smartctl. You can get it by installing HomeBrew and then running this command in the Terminal:\nbrew install smartmontools\n\nThen run smartctl like this:\nsmartctl -a /dev/diskX\n\nwhere X should be replaced with the disk number of the SSD in question.\nIn the output, you want to look for a line like this:\n\nPercentage Used:                    1%\n\nThis is an indication of the wear on the drive. However, note that it is not an exact science - the drive could wear out before it reaches 100%, and it might also reach values above 100%.\nNote: Wearing the drive down doesn't make it slow, as you seem to indicate in your question. When the drive wears out it will fail to be able to read some or all of the data that you have stored on the drive.\nMake sure you have a working backup system in place. Just looking at the wear indicator and replacing the drive when the indicator is high won't ensure that you will keep your data.\n", "Q: macOS BigSur keep booting from external backup disk (made with CCC) My Mac is on BigSur and I am using Carbon Copy Cloner to create a one on one disk which is bootable also. I have this setup running for years now and never noticed any problems – also on BigSur it worked.\nNow my Backup Drive crashed and I bought a new HDD. I have exactly build this HDD (one 1 TB partition for CCC for the one on one copy and another 1 TB partition for TimeMachine). But two major problems: The clone partition is the one that get booted after a restart – I also cannot choose another startup disk from system preferences since I only can see the actual booted one. So when I had booted with system SSD only this disk is shown and when I booted from the backup disk only this ons is shown. But the mac should boot from the internal disk by default, what could happened here?\nThe Drive was always plugged in in a Thunderbolt 3 Dock. I also recently switched to an eGPU (Razer Core X Chroma) which now operates as my dock where the HDD is attached. But I think the problem occurred since the new replacement disk. Also when I plug in that drive directly on my macbook this drive get booted on restart.\nAnother issue is that the TimeMachine partition of the disk get mountet sporadically and is making intense work but not running a time machine backup. I tried to disable the volume on spotlight which presents an error (time machine backup cannot be excluded since they are always excluded – something like that) but disabled it by command line with sudo mdutil -i off \"/Volumes/TimeMachine\". Now I think its better...\nMaybe you have an idea.\nThanks!\n-- Update\nThe regular automatic TimeMachine backup is disabled – I have an own task that runs every hour that mounts the volume, do the TM backup and unmount it. That also worked for years now.\n\nA: Maybe solved by reformatting the partitions to Mac OS journaled instead of apfs. Even when these programs also connect to apfs. But seems good actually. Will observe that.\n", "Q: Reinstall MacOS or/vs Reformat? My current install of Catalina has gone a bit wonky. Every other time I start it up it displays the circle with a line through it, so I do a hard restart and it will then boot into Catalina.\nI'm trying to move to Big Sur and wondering if I should do a fresh install/reformat, or if i should do a Reinstall MacOS from the recovery screen.\nFrom what I understand Reinstall MacOS just rewrites the OS files, but keeps everything else intact like document, downloads, apps, etc...?\nShould I upgrade to Big Sur first? Or Reinstall Catalina, and then upgrade to Big Sur? Or just a fresh install? (Running an iMac Pro)\n\nA: The \"circle with a line through it\" is known as the prohibitory symbol. Typically this means that your startup disk contains a version or build of macOS that your Mac can't use. In your case it seems something else is going wrong, but, if I read between the lines correctly, it seems your main goal is to upgrade to macOS Big Sur anyway.\nThe best course of action is really to make a full current backup of your system and then reformat your drive before re-installing macOS.\nYou have a number of options open to you, such as using the Option-Command-R keyboard shortcut at startup to upgrade to the latest macOS that is officially compatible with your Mac (and assuming macOS Big Sur is compatible, then this will be what is installed).*\nIf using this option you'll have the ability to reformat your drive using Disk Utility first before opting for the Reinstall MacOS option. More information on using macOS Recovery to reinstall the Mac operating system is available on Apple's website: How to reinstall macOS.\nAnother option is to just create a bootable installer for macOS and then boot up from that to install macOS Big Sur. You can opt to fully reformat your drive before doing the installation. More information is available from Apple's website: How to create a bootable installer for macOS.\nRegardless of how you go, the main thing here is that you're broadly following this order:\n\n*\n\n*make a full and current backup of your system\n\n*reformat your drive\n\n*reinstall macOS\n\n*transfer across your files etc\n\nFollowing this order means whatever is causing your 'wonky' Catalina installation really shouldn't come across with you.\nNOTE: -\nKeep in mind that many users have had issues with macOS Big Sur, so whether you should make the jump yet is really only a decision you can make.\n* If your Mac has the Apple T2 Security Chip and you've never installed a macOS update, this will install the latest version of macOS previously installed on your Mac.\n", "Q: Merging screen recordings without resampling cmd+shift+5 is incredible for screen recording!\nSplitting a screen recording without resampling the video is easy with quicktime - Edit/Trim the first part and save, then reopen the original recording, Edit/Trim the second part and save. These save super-fast, a testament to simply being copied rather than resampled.\nBut what if I'd like to merge (concatenate) two screen recordings without resampling?\nUsing quicktime's Edit/Add Clip to End seems to force a resampling and takes 10x longer to save. Is there a way around it?\n\nA: There is a command line tool called ffmpeg, which can be installed with any package manager such as brew or macports.\nYou can use concat option of ffmpeg like this:\nffmpeg -safe 0 -f concat -i listofvideos.txt -c copy output.mov\n\nContents of listofvideos.txt:\nfile 'movie1.mov'\nfile 'movie2.mov'\nfile 'movie3.mov'\n\n-c copy makes sure the codec is copied and nothing is resampled.\nMore info about concat can be found here\n", "Q: Is there a dedicated camera is for recording video on iPhone 12 Pro? I am going to get an iPhone 12 Pro to use as a high quality video camera. I know the 3 cameras have different functions, but I don’t know much about this triple camera setup.\n\n*\n\n*Is there a dedicated camera to record video, or does it use all 3 at a time for maximum quality?\n\n*If it uses just one camera at a time, which one is the highest quality?\n\n\nA: The built in Camera app on your iPhone can shoot video from one camera at a time. If you'd like to shoot with multiple cameras at a time, third-party apps can enable this functionality since iOS 13 - for example, DoubleTake by FiLMiC Pro. This does not improve the video quality, but it can let you capture with both the front-facing and rear-facing camera at the same time, for example.\nTo answer your second question, these are some of the features available on iPhone 12 Pro based on which camera you use:\nAvailable for photos only\n\n*\n\n*Night mode (Ultra Wide, Wide)\n\n*Deep Fusion (Ultra Wide, Wide, Telephoto)\n\n*Smart HDR 3 (Ultra Wide, Wide, Telephoto)\n\n*Apple ProRAW (Ultra Wide, Wide, Telephoto)\n\n*Lens correction (Ultra Wide)\n\n*Portrait lighting (Wide, Telephoto)\n\n*100% Focus Pixels (Wide)\n\nAvailable for photos and videos\n\n*\n\n*Optical image stabilization (Wide and Telephoto)\n\n*f/1.6 aperture (Wide), f/2.0 aperture (Telephoto), f/2.4 aperture (Ultra Wide)\n\n*Five-element lens (Ultra Wide), six-element lens (Telephoto), seven-element lens (Wide)\n\nAvailable for videos only\n\n*\n\n*Sensor-shift optical image stabilization (Wide)\n\n*HDR video recording with Dolby Vision (Ultra Wide, Wide, Telephoto)\n\n*Slo‑mo video support for 1080p at 120 fps or 240 fps (Ultra Wide, Wide, Telephoto)\n\nThough all of the cameras perform well enough in great light, it's my personal experience that the Ultra Wide camera especially suffers in dim environments. You should pick which camera you'd like to use based on what you want to capture - the camera's field of view and lens distortion can drastically alter the look of an image.

That is nothing new and has been going on for decades. Likewise with emails - I get emails from unknown people all the time. It doesn't mean they 'know' me and my email address.\nIt's no different for FaceTime. A caller could try their luck and FaceTime a random number or a random email address and if they belong to an iPhone user or to an Apple ID, well, the FaceTime call comes through.\nSo, if you don't want an incoming FaceTime video caller to potentially see you (or your home, etc) then the best option is simply not to answer it. If it turns out to be someone you know, they'll try you again later.\nHowever, you can silence unknown callers to your iPhone's cell number. for more info on this and other options for avoiding unwanted calls to your cell number, refer to Avoid unwanted calls on iPhone on Apple's website.\nYou can also block unwanted callers in FaceTime on iPhone (but this is not the same as 'unknown' callers).\n", "Q: How do iOS devices perform on-device machine learning on photos while most of the photos are uploaded to iCloud? When iCloud photo is enabled, all photos are uploaded to iCloud and only a low-resolution copy is saved on the phone for browsing, the high res photo is download on-demand if the user clicks it.\nPhotos app will perform on-device machine learning when the device is not in use and is charging(typically while you’re sleeping) to detect faces in your photo library so that you have “people albums”. This is just one case that the app is using ML to achieve.\nWhat confuses me is that the low res images are just not good enough to perform ML on, especially for face detection. So how can it analyze those low-res photos and giving the correct prediction?\nI have two guesses:\n\n*\n\n*Don’t care low or high res, just analyze what is on the device. (I don’t really believe this is the case as the face detection is too accurate to be believed that they were a result of ML on 480p photos)\n\n\n*On-demand loading, download the original photo from iCloud while the ML algorithm is running, and delete the original photo from the device when it is done. (Isn’t this a bandwidth waste for iCloud servers?)\nEdit 1:\nI’m interested in how will it handle the case when I manually added some photo to one person(this action causes the model to change, well, eventually change after it learns the new photos that weren’t detected previously), all photos must be analyzed again using the new model. At this time, most high-resolution images (let's say 199GB/200GB) are in iCloud only, so will the system pull them one by one to perform ML using the new model again? What if I “edit” the ML regularly? (by adding an un-detected photo to people album but not all at once) If so, this could be a huge drain to the iCloud servers... don’t forget some people do have more than 1TB of photos in iCloud.\nEdit 2:\nDon't take me wrong, I'm purely interested in how this whole thing works because to me it is done very nicely. And to be clear, I completely trust Apple on the \"on-device\" promise, and this is exactly why I asked this question to get an understanding of the technical details that make it both respecting privacy and giving accurate results.\n\nA: Obviously the phone cannot do its work without the data - so it performs the on-device ML right after the photo was taken, before it is uploaded to iCloud and deleted on device - or if that wasn't possible - it downloads the photo data from iCloud and performs the on-device ML (without necessarily storing the photo on the device).\nWhether or not that is a \"bandwidth waste\" is fully subjective. If you care about the privacy benefits on performing ML on-device, it is not a waste - if you do not care, it could be seen as a waste.\nUPDATE: With your edit, you added a question on what happens if you add new information after the fact - for example changing a name, adding a photo to a specific detected person, etc. Actually the phone does not need to download all photos again to do the whole thing all over.\nWhen the phone has the original image, it can extract features from the photo using machine learning. It is not known exactly which features iPhoto look at, but imagine extracting numbers such as the distance between the eyes, the color of the eye, etc. Another type of machine learning then can group thee numbers into classifications of individuals, which you them can name.\nThese numbers are stored on the phone and allow for you to update certain information and “recalculate” the detected persons without actually needing the full image data again.\n\nA: I would wager the thumbnails that are present and the metadata are sufficient for the models to run on your device. This seems more like an indirect question though. If it just works, what’s the issue with how Apple implements it. If you’re trying to ask if Apple is lying or mistaken about how they handle privacy, we should address that clearly.\nI think your premise isn’t totally correct about needing to download anything. The models run on the data on the device. You can test this by adding photos from files storage while the device is offline in AirPlane mode and no WiFi and letting the nightly tasks run when connected to power.\n", "Q: I can’t update but I can install apps (App Store) I can access the Japanese App Store and I can install the apps but when it comes to updating, it says “App has been removed by the developer from the app store.” (Which is not as my friends had already updated their games.)\nMy region is in Japan (both in the app store and the apple site) and I have never switched it to any country.\nThe only “fix” I found when one of my apps were like this, was to uninstall and reinstall, which isn’t favorable right now as my data will be lost once I uninstall.\n\nA: It is possible that the developer has changed the bundle-ID of the application, which essential makes it a completely new app - just with the same name. This could explain why you cannot update your app that has the old bundle-ID, whereas other user's who downloaded the newer app with the new bundle-ID can.\nThis can happen for example when a company that owns an app sells that app to another developer. In certain cases, they need to use a new bundle identifier.\n", "Q: App Privacy: Why does the railroad company need my steps made and other health data? How-To revoke? \nI was surprised to see that the local railroad company, accesses Health and Fitness data. I use this app only as a timetable for trains.\n\nThe Health app can track your daily footsteps and the flights of\nstairs you climb. You can manually add other information like body\nweight and caffeine intake, and track additional data with other apps\n(such as nutrition and fitness apps) and devices that are compatible\nwith Health (such as Apple Watch, AirPods, weight scales, and blood\npressure monitors, all sold separately).\n\nIs there a plausible reason why the railroad company wants to collect my health data? How can I prohibit this (expect uninstalling the app and use web site)?\n\nA: This is required for the EasyRide functionality. The first time you activate it within the app you are asked to grant access by iOS.\n\n(EasyRide wants to access your Fitness data to optimally support you, e.g. if you forget to sign-off after a trip)\nIf you decline you can't use the EasyRide functionality\n\nYou can check in System Preferences -> Health whether the SBB app has access to its data or not.

If it's useful to know, it's a hotmail account that I'm viewing in the Mail app.\nSorry if this is an obvious question - I couldn't find anything about this online.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Neither Apple Mail on iOS nor macOS has this feature.\nYou could set up a rule on your mail server to move messages categorised as other to a folder which would then appear in Mail, but then the emails no longer appear in Other if you looked at your emails in another client or the web interface.\n", "Q: The application \"XQuartz\" can't be opened I'm quite puzzled by the following issue. I tried to open XQuartz after some time I hadn't used it and I got a dialog box saying \"The application \"XQuartz\" can't be opened.\" I went through all the usual troubleshooting steps (deleting preferences and caches, and reinstalling the application) to no avail. After further troubleshooting I discovered that:\n\n*\n\n*it only happens in my account; i.e., XQuartz works for other accounts on the same laptop;\n\n*it only happens when trying to open XQuartz from Finder; i.e., if try to open XQuartz from the command line with xquartz or open /Applications/Utilities/XQuartz.app, XQuartz opens properly.\n\nI suspect the issue has something to do with environment variables, possibly the PATH variable, for applications launched through Finder, but I'm not sure how to troubleshoot that. Any suggestions? I'm on macOS Catalina 10.15.7\n\nA: The issue was my .zprofile file. I recently installed Intel oneAPI and I had the initialization script in the .zprofile file. I moved the script to the .zshrc file, and now everything works properly.\n", "Q: iPadOS 14 external keyboard arrow keys issues I recently purchased a Logitech K380 keyboard for my iPad, running iPadOS 14.4.

For example, when I enter text on the search bar, I press the arrow key to go back a letter to edit, and it just swipes.

I am on Catalina 10.15.3 and do not want to move to Big Sur just yet. Software Update does have the option to update to Big Sur but I am unable to determine how to do just a minor point update.  How do I install the latest update of Catalina?\nUpdate From a comment by @jefe2000 I am trying the command line version and it seems promising.\n$/usr/sbin/softwareupdate -l\nSoftware Update Tool\n\nFinding available software\nSoftware Update found the following new or updated software:\n* Label: macOS Catalina 10.15.7 Update- \n    Title: macOS Catalina 10.15.7 Update, Version:  , Size: 5099042K, Recommended: YES, Action: restart, \n\n\nBut what is the actual label?  I was unable to get this to work and have created a separate question for it.

Any ideas on to fix that?\n\nA: iOS and iPadOS 14.5 are currently beta operating systems and are expected to have bugs and other random issues. As of this writing, they are on developer beta 2 and public beta 1. There will likely be over 5 betas before this version is officially released.\nYou should not use beta software on your primary devices or on any devices on which you depend. You should report any bugs you find to Apple using the Feedback app (purple/pink icon) that appears on your Home Screen or app drawer when you install beta software on your Apple devices. If you are not willing to live with bugs/issues and report them to Apple, you should not install beta software.\nThere’s nothing anyone here can do to help you with beta Apple software. If you report the bugs to Apple, they will likely fix it before releasing the final version.\nYou can either downgrade your device to a final version of iPadOS such as 14.4 (recommended) or wait until the next beta is released and hope it is fixed by then, but there are no guarantees about beta software and the next version could actually be worse than the current one you have.\nReinstall Apple Books\nSometimes with beta software resetting settings, apps or even the whole device might work. You can try reinstalling Apple Books.\n\n*\n\n*Make a backup of all of your files. PDFs, books and anything you have imported into Apple Books. You already have a backup if you use iCloud and Apple Books and iCloud Drive are enabled on Preferences > Your Name > iCloud. Make sure the backup has finished synchronization before proceeding.\n\nDelete the Apple Books app and download it again from the App Store. Then try again and see if it fixes your issue.\n", "Q: Failed OSX update and how to fix it \nI have a MacBook Pro Mid 2012. Until yesterday it had High Sierra. I tried to update to Catalina with an installer I found online, but the installation breaks up every time and starts again, once the computer is restarted. I get the Error: -69845: File system verify or repair failed.\nLuckily, I have an older copy of the system on an USB stick, so I was a able to boot the MacBook and access the drive. It is locked, so I can´t write it, but at least I can still backup and save my data.\nThe question however is, is there something I can do to save the old installation or is it corrupt now, because the update to Catalina overrode some files and there is just nothing I can do to fix that?\n\nA: You may need two USB drives at this point. Your goal is to make a bootable installer for Catalina.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372\nAssuming you don’t have another Mac handy or can’t convince someone you trust to make a drive and deliver/ship it, from the one you can boot to recovery, open the terminal app in utilities and see if you can run the guide above.\nOn older OS and some firmware, you could also format a USB as FAT (MS-DOS) and just drop the installer app but I don’t think that works for Catalina and you need the script to prepare things.\nEven if your Mac can run internet recovery, since your network couldn’t successfully download the installer app from the App Store, something isn’t reliable in the setup so that might be more hassle than help. Also, you won’t know if hardware is the issue since failing to install is generally one of three things. 1) bad network 2) not the correct steps to erase and install 3) hardware.\n", "Q: Remap function key on external logitech keyboard I am using a Logitech K250 keyboard on my MacBook Pro.

How can I do this? Thank you for your help.\n\nA: It is possible to do with the Karabiner-Elements app.\nAs you have completed the installation, head to the app. In the very first tab choose the input device you wish to make a key remap for, then add a new item and define the initial key and target key (they are in the top section of the drop down).\nThis is it, no need to reboot.

The diskutil command has far more options than can be accessed by the Disk Utility application. Also, the diskutil command is less prone to failure. This makes the diskutil command far more versatile than the Disk Utility application. An Ask Different search for FFFF currently results in at least 150 posts, with yours being the latest.

Afterward, my second monitor did not work\nat all (Apple Cinema HD Display on NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 512 MB).\n\n*I went back to DosDude's post-install patches, and tried to\nre-patch the \"Legacy Video Card\" patch. Still no joy.\n\n*I tried to re-intall the complete DosDude system, but it refused to put an older\nsystem on top of a newer one.\n\n*I made sure I had a good Time Machine backup, then wiped the disk, re-intalled the original DosDude system (ticking \"Legacy Video Card\") and voila — second monitor worked again!\n\n*I then used Migration Assistant.app to try to put things back how they were, using my Time Machine backup.\n\nWhen the restore finished about 16 hours later, I re-booted and logged in. First thing I discovered is that Mail.app no longer works. It wants to be completely re-configured. When I try to configure gmail, it says Google \"didn't authorize\" — after successfully going through the linked login procedure!\nThen I tried connecting to my local IMAP/SMTP server, using the same credentials that are working on a similarly-configured laptop. It accepts my credentials (after many minutes of thinking about it!), and then asks which apps I want to use with those credentials, including Mail and Notes. No matter how I tick those boxes and click \"Done,\" it presents me with the same dialogue with an endless \"Next\" button that apparently doesn't do anything useful.\nWhile digging deeper, I noticed that many of my custom enhancements (Albert, Carabiner, Default Folder, etc.) no longer work. They ask for access to Automation in System Preferences, but then there is no way to change anything. (These were all working before I did the restore.)\n\nMy guess is that something in the restore has messed up permissions, ACLs, or attributes for some of the files that System Preferences uses. But /System/Library/PreferencePanes looks exactly like it does on my fully-functioning laptop, running the same OS and patch kit:\n\nAny thought on what I should try next, short of another complete re-install?\n\nA: Ugh.

When you cd /Applications, the leading slash provides an absolute path rather than relative path, starting at the top of the volume rather than the current working directory (which is your home folder for new shells).\n", "Q: Small black square in top right corner since I updated my Mac to Big Sur, just on one of my four Desktops, this little black square appeared. Does anyone know how to remove it?\n\n\nA: I believe this is a bug with the menubar transparency in Big Sur.\nI often get the same issue often when I switch between spaces with darker and lighter desktop images, as the transparency/font of the menubar adapts to your desktop image. For example, a darker desktop image shows the menubar with white font, but a lighter desktop image shows the menubar as black font.\nIf you don't care much about the menubar transparency, you could reduce transparency in System Preferences>Accessibility>Display and enable Reduce transparency. This will then keep the menubar as a solid grey menubar and hopefully stop the issue.\nAnother solution would be to click on one of the menubar options in the affected area or switch between different desktop spaces, and let the UI processes recalibrate.\nYou could also kill some UI processes in terminal to get it to reset, but I often find the terminal command killall Dock is a safe one and does the job fine.\n", "Q: Two independent Big Sur installations on the same device Assume I have a MacBook Pro 2019 with Big Sur installed.\nMy goal is to have two different partitions on the same physical SSD.\nI want to have two separate installations of Big Sur.\nMy question is:\nHow can I make sure, that nothing I do on either of the partitions has an effect on the other partition? Assume I install some software with admin rights on partition B. Can it be made sure, that the program installed on B has no possibility to read or manipulate any data from partition A, for example system files?\n\nA: The answer is no.  Assume I install some software with admin rights on partition B. It can not be made sure, that the program installed on B has no possibility to ask the diskutil to remove entirely partition A.\nUpdate\nMaybe this explanation will make more sense to you. Originally with OS X, many problems could be fixed by booting to the OS X installation DVD. Security existed by storing the DVD somewhere safe. After Snow Leopard, Apple stopped issuing DVDs and instead opted for software downloads. A recovery volume was added to take the place of using the DVD to fix problems. The recovery volume contained limited functionality compared to a full OS X operating system. However, when booted to the recovery volume, changes could be made that are not normally possible when booted to OS X. This concept of recovery has been refined with each new release up to and including the release of macOS Big Sur. Along the way, Apple has taken many steps to prevent booting to recovery without first requiring user validation.\nInstalling a second Big Sur in a different partition creates in effect an extremely powerful version of recovery. So when booted to the second Big Sur, you are going to be able to mess with the first Big Sur, just as if you had booted to recovery. For example, SIP only applies to the partition of the currently booted Big Sur. The files in the other Big Sur are no longer protected by SIP. The same is true, if you were to install, then boot to Windows or Linux on your Mac.\nThe best way to protect your Mac is to only have on operation system installed. Once you install a second operating system,  you open up security vulnerabilities that Apple has not begun to address.\n", "Q: Big Sur Updates Reset Apache Files Concerning these Apache files:\n/etc/apache2/httpd.conf\n/etc/apache2/vhosts/httpd-vhosts.conf\nUnlike the previous version of MacOS, each Big Sur update resets these Apache .conf files to their original state, wiping out my changes.  These are the only files I changed, so I assume that if I had changed any others that the update would have reset those also.\nAt the bottom of the original httpd.conf file is this line:\nInclude /private/etc/apache2/other/*.conf\nAny .conf files that I place in this directory are left alone during an update.  Should I leave the original httpd.conf file alone and in its original state and place all the changes I need to make in .conf files in the /private/etc/apache2/other subdirectory?  I think this would work but it seems strange because, for example, there's the line \"ServerAdmin you@example.com\" in the original which feels like it should be edited to be my own admin email address, but if I instead create .../other/*.conf files then I'll be setting \"ServerAdmin\" again, which feels very klugey but which I hope works and is kosher.\nIs this the right way to do things?  Or is there a better way?\n(I know that my versions of the files get placed in \"Previously Relocated Items n\" subdirectories in /Users/Shared, but I'd prefer not to have to perform manual restorations after each update.)\n(There was a very similar question several months ago at Big Sur Update wiped my /etc/apache2/extra, and I would have preferred posting this to that thread, but the tips say not to post requests for help or clarification, which seems odd, but I'll follow the guidelines.)\n\nA: Apache is not the only service whose configuration files get overwritten with every update. My annoyance is the SNMP daemon.\nFor Apache, I suggest that you stop using the Apple distributed Apache. Replace it with the Homebrew version.\nThe Homebrew version uses /usr/local/etc/httpd/ for configuration, /usr/local/var/www for document root and is completely independent of Apple's version and so will not get modified by macOS updates.\nJust in case you are not familiar with Homebrew.  You will find numerous web postings about how to install and configure Apache under Homebrew - an example. And you are already aware that there have been other Apache questions in Ask Different.\n", "Q: Limit application launching to boot disk only Does anyone know of a way to restrict macOS (High Sierra) to only launch apps stored on the boot drive?\nI have several alternate bootable drives on my system (different OS versions, bootable backups etc), but find that in almost every case, when I right click a document, and choose \"open with\" the system is preferentially launching apps on non-boot volumes, in preference to the ones in /Applications. Eg, right click on an mp4 file, choose Open With the one and only entry for Quicktime Player X, and instead of the version in my dock launching, a new icon appears in the dock for Quicktime, and if I right click and \"show in finder\", it's on one of my other bootable drives.\nI've removed all the external drives from Spotlight, using the Spotlight privacy feature in System Preferences, and tried reloading Launch services (which results in needing to reboot the entire machine to get all my 3rd party share options back), nothing seems to work.\nI have to assume macOS is supposed to preferentially open apps from /Applications, and I've got something else wrong, for which this is just a symptom, so if there's some other maintenance thing (eg in OnyX etc) I'm happy to hear about it.\nThanks.\n\nA: Just for the benefit of anyone else having this issue, and partially to answer @Tetsujin's suggestion - Tinkertool System, a nice GUI app from from Marcel Bresink has a function to both disable automount of specified partitions, and prevent app launching from specified volumes.\n\nA: I'd suspect you can only do this if each 'other' OS was set to never mount, via fstab - see Time Machine restore to new partition, different computer - & then clear the LaunchServices database [individually for each OS] using  Onyx\n", "Q: How can I remove unwanted preinstalled apps from macOS? In macOS there are a lot of pre-installed bloatware applications. I know that I will never use them.

I've been running Catalina until yesterday when I upgraded to Big Sur 11.2.2. It's noticeably laggy. Has anyone experienced this? I'm not sure if 11.2.1 was laggy, so I was considering downgrading. Does anyone know how I can downgrade to 11.2.1, and possibly back to Catalina?\n\nA: Here is how I would back date a newer Big Sur system to 11.2.1\nIf you have a Time Machine Backup from before you ran the upgrade. That means you can erase the Mac - get the installer for 11.2.1 and then erase / install in a fairly straight-forward manner.\nOnce 11.2.1 is running, migrate data from the Time Machine snapshot or backup interval before the upgrade (or whatever your custom backup procedure entails). If you don't have a backup - make one now so you can hand migrate some of the easy apps and files that are compatible with a downgrade - some apps like Photos databases don't necessarily work backwards so you'd need to handle those errors and issues one by one.\nAlso - Catalina may have made a snapshot of your system that’s usable as a backup, so you would just boot to recovery and restore the system to that shapshot and not even need to worry about an installer.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204015\n\nAnd in macOS High Sierra or later, another snapshot is saved before installing any macOS update.\n\nIf you need to make a bootable 11.2.1 installer, here's how:\n\n*\n\n*Delete any Install macOS Big Sur apps you have in /Applications (or copy them to an external drive)\n\n*Open terminal.app or another tool to get to the command line and issue this command\n\n\nsoftwareupdate --fetch-full-installer --full-installer-version 11.2.1\n\nOnce the installer is there, follow this guide to make an installable USB for 11.2.1\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372\nThen follow this guide to erase install.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208496\n\nA: From your Activity Monitor screenshots, it looks like you're using Chrome.

The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide.

I saw a pushed update for iPadOs to 14.3. Can I update to this since it's not signed anymore, or would it force me to 14.4? I also restated out of jailbroken state and the Pushed OTA is still 14.3. I just don’t want it to force me to 14.4 since 14.3 Is no longer signed. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Not an expert on how iOS/iPadOS OTA works, but my understanding is that it depends on whether or not the update has been locally downloaded yet.\nIf you check Settings > General > Storage and see the iPadOS 14.3 update somewhere in that list (where in the list it is depends on how large it is relative to other files/apps on your iPad), it's been downloaded locally. You should be able to update to it, as the locally downloaded copy should be signed.\nIf you don't see the update file listed, it's likely a cache issue and pressing the button will likely cause it to refresh and download iPadOS 14.4. Some older updates (back when OTA was newer) acted as bridge updates to newer versions, but that's not been the case since well before iPadOS was forked from iOS.\nAgain, I can't say with any sincerity that this is all true and correct. What I can say with sincerity is that you shouldn't update at all if you're not 100% certain that you have saved blobs and are willing to potentially lose your jailbreak.\n", "Q: Find and delete duplicate mails in Apple Mail (Big Sur/M1) How can I find and delete duplicate mails in Apple Mail (on Big Sur/M1)?

See answer https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/350900/278784 for more details on how to export, but also import back after deletions are done. Note that when selecting a lot of emails and dragging to a folder, in my case it took a very long time with seemingly nothing happening until the .eml files were actually exported.\n\n*Use a duplicate file software, I use Duplicate File Finder from the App Store, which is free for exact duplicate file deletion. Delete all duplicates that it finds. This worked great for me, it found all duplicates (I think, because I have >100 000 emails so...).\n\n*Import back the remaining .eml files, also using the details from the answer linked above. You could then delete all the original emails, or do it before you import back the cleaned up emails, but make sure you have a back up.\n\nAs a benchmark, exporting ~10 000 emails into .eml files in a folder took me over 2 hours. During that time, I could check if something was actually going on by looking in Activity Monitor: Mail.app was using around 80% of a processor core, even dropping later to below 30% after a while. Otherwise Mail.app when not doing anything was using only way under 1%.\n", "Q: What are the risks of adding `/usr/libexec` to `$PATH`?

You can verify that by renaming or moving the one in the old default location and launching photos.app normally.\n\nA: Yes, you can transfer the photo library to an external drive or NAS and still back it up.\nYou can simply copy and paste your current library (usually the .photoslibrary package is located in /user/Photos/) to your external storage device. Make sure to not interrupt the copy process, because restarting the copy process means you will lose all progress (unless you use e.g. rsync).\nTo make sure which photoslibrary you are opening follow Steves answer.\n\nBacking up the library also still works e.g. with TimeMachine. Just go into settings -> TimeMachine -> options -> select the external device -> hit the - sign. This will backup the whole external device, but you can exclude all other files by hitting the + sign in that same view and selecting everything except the photoslibrary.\n\nYou didn't ask how many drives are needed for Time Machine but the answer is more than one. Set up multiple drives in rotation and keep one off site if you can. Having one connected regularly is awesome, but more destinations will save your photos if disaster strikes.\n", "Q: zsh: killed git on Mac Hi~ I am just using a Mac with M1 chip.\nI just found when I tried to run\ngit clone ...\n\nI got\nzsh: killed git \n\nWhat should I do?\nI have tried to reinstall git via brew.\nbut it doesn't work.\ngit version:\ngit-2.30.1.arm64_big_sur.bottle.tar.gz\n\n\n\nA: Assuming you used the brew reinstall git command instead of brew install git, and assuming you still have Command Line Tools installed, then I would first install gettext and pcre2 as git needs them.\nSo, first do...\nbrew reinstall gettext\n\n...followed by:\nbrew reinstall pcre2\n\nand then by...\nbrew reinstall git\n\nIf that doesn't work you could try all the commands again but with install instead of reinstall.\nAnd if that doesn't work, what's the result of brew config?\n\nA: I have an M1 so I had to install xcode-select first because reinstalling gettext or pcre2 was not running either.\nDo it in this order:\nxcode-select --install\nbrew reinstall gettext\nbrew reinstall pcre2\nbrew reinstall git\n\nGood Luck!\n", "Q: How to convert file format of massive image How can I convert a very large Portable Pixel Map (ppm) file into a png on MacOS?\nI have a massive ppm image on my computer.

Does it read an entire image into memory, work on it there, then write it out all at once? Does it read one and write one pixel at a time? In Netpbm, it differs from one program to the next, but there are some generalizations we can make.\nMost Netpbm programs keep one row of pixels at a time in memory. Such a program reads a row from an input file, processes it, then writes a row to an output file. Some programs execute algorithms that can't work like that, so they keep a small window of rows in memory. Others must keep the entire image in memory. If you think of what job the program does, you can probably guess which one it does.\n\nInstalling\nYou can install netpbm on your Mac using the Homebrew project, see Install Homebrew. Once brew is on your Mac, use the following command to install netpbm:\nbrew install netpbm\n\nIf you need help using the command line or tools mentioned, please ask questions.\n", "Q: Integrating Zoom with default Calendar I have Calendar events with Zoom links in them.

Photos are synced from my phone with iCloud.\nI'm unable to export HEVC videos to other formats. When I drag and drop to the finder, the cursor shows a green plus sign but nothing happens. No error, but no video either.\nWhen I choose File > Export > Export 1 Video… I get an unable to export error: Unknown error (0).\nThe videos play fine in Photos. I can export them using File > Export > Export Unmodified Original, and they show up as HEVC videos in .mov containers. They play fine in the Finder with Quicklook, and I can open them in Quicktime Player, although File > Export As has all its options greyed out.\nThis seems to apply to every HEVC video in my library. Other formats (e.g. H.264) work normally. I have a newer iMac running Big Sur synced to the same iCloud library, and I can export normally there.\nApple says HEVC support was introduced in High Sierra, so Catalina should be fine. And there must be some support, since I can watch the videos.\nWhat could be causing this and how can I fix it?\n\nA: As an alternative, you may take the original video out of the library by right click on Photos Library.photoslibrary > show package contents and search by filename or extension.\nBe careful to not modify anything that can mess up the library.

One of them being open Spotlight (⌘ + Space), enter first letters of file name and drag it from the results list to email.\nIf you haven't started to write e-mail then 'Share' inside Excel can be used. There are two possible approaches (1) click on icon in right-upper labeled 'Share' > click 'Send a Copy' > change 'Send as' if needed (default Excel Workbook, alternative is PDF) and click 'Email as Attachment' (or on icon next to it which allows to send copy to other apps), or, (2) from menubar select File > Share > Send Workbook (or Send PDF).

Tried opening it various times. Restarted the computer. Remounted the hard drive.\nAny idea how to get it to open?\nFound this thread googling - https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250721038 - but don't understand the proposed solution.\n\n\nA: First things first: before modifying the photoslibrary copy it to somewhere else/back it up, to ensure you are not losing the raw photo data (preferably multiple backups in different locations)!\nI will explain what the mentioned thread means, however: You will not restore album structure, face detection data and edits, i.e. all metadata.\n\n*\n\n*Open photos, immediately hit option and create a new library.\n\n\n*Locate the new photoslibrary package and right click on it. Hit show package contents and copy the originals (previously masters) folder onto your desktop.\n\n\n*While the new photoslibrary is opened, drag the originals folder onto the photos app icon in the dock.\n\n\n*Import the photos \n\nThis will not preserve any albums, face detection data and more. You will have to reorganize the pictures. This method only allows you to copy all the raw photos from your old library into the new one quickly!\nHowever, this allows you to start off fresh and - depending on how much you've been using face recognition, edit features and albums - you may have restored the photos library quite quickly.\nNote: Selecting preserve folder structure when importing the pictures at step 4 will not preserve the albums. It will preserve the folder structure of the originals folder and create for each subfolder a new album.\n\nOther things you could try:\n\n*\n\n*Run first aid (preferably multiple times in recovery mode) on the external drive to check the external HDD for malfunction\n\n*Copy the library to another location and try opening it there\n\nYour photos app window says:\n\nUpdating library\n\n\n\n*This means you must have done some macOS update. You could try to revert to the older macOS version or install a virtual machine and try opening the library from there\n\nApart from that I think you are out of luck, but maybe someone has a better answer, so maybe wait and do not deleted the library in its current state.\n\nEDIT:\nI just realized it says you're opening an iPhoto library, which was Apples previous photos app before the Photos app was introduced in OS X Yosemite in 2015. On Apples forum there is a good thread about what to make sure before transition from iPhoto to Photos.\nIt states:\n\nRepair the permissions, and repair the database\n\nSo if you have an old Mac with an OS X version before Yosemite was introduced, you could try to repair the database there and start again.\nFurther, ensure the drive is formatted correctly (HFS+ usually works well) and you're not connecting to a NAS/shared network drive.\n\nIf your iPhoto Library is not in your Pictures folder, but on an external drive, check the drive for compatibility. Photos may have problems accessing the drive, if it is on a network volume and not locally mounted.\n\n\nThis is again a good example why backups are vital. HDDs these days are really cheap and backing up - even external devices - is not hard, even the built-in TimeMachine app can do that. So please, anyone reading this, think about your backup solution, because its only a question of time when your first device will experience data loss.\n", "Q: I \"erased all content and settings\", but did not sign out of iCloud before selling my iPhone? Before selling my iPhone, I erased my iPhone with all of its content and settings, but my problem is that I forgot to sign out of iCloud first. I somewhat remember being asked to provide my Apple ID in order to turn off Find My iPhone, but I am not fully sure. After erasing the device, I also removed it from my iCloud's devices lists as well. My question is, will my iCloud's data still be synced on that iPhone and accessible to the new owner? As I did not sign out of iCloud before. I know that the data will still be on the iCloud's server, but will it be synced with that iPhone after resetting it as well? I just want to make sure my personal data is fully wiped out on that device from everywhere.\n\nA: To expound on some of the answers - there's two different things at play here\n\n*\n\n*Signing out of your Apple ID\n\n*Turning off \"Find my iPhone\"\n\nAlthough it sounds innocuous, turning off \"Find my iPhone\" is the important part because it turns off Activation Lock, which if not turned off prevents the phone from being able to be reused.\nWith Activation Lock turned on (so, with Find my iPhone turned on) if someone were to steal your iPhone and then try to nuke it to factory settings, during the setup process it would say it can't do anything until the Apple ID associated with the Activation Lock enters their password. The thief isn't going to know this so the phone is useless to them or anyone else now. When word of this got around the criminal community thefts of iPhones dropped dramatically.\nBut signing out of your Apple ID itself isn't necessary. Once Activation Lock is turned off, resetting your iPhone is like reformatting your hard drive.\nAlso I think iOS warns you if you try and reset the device before signing out of Find my iPhone.\nIf you didn't sign out of Find my iPhone, whoever you sold it to may be contacting you soon because they can't use the phone without it signed out, but if you vaguely remember turning it off and no one has contacted you, you're probably good to go.\n\nA: No, once you \"Erase all content and settings\" your iPhone is basically back to factory settings and the new owner will not be able to sync with or sign in to your iCloud account.\n\nA: When dealing with Apple products, it is best you sign out your icloud account before selling. Now to your question, \"will my iCloud's data still be synced on that iPhone and accessible to the new owner?\" The answer is yes, your icloud account is still linked to the device, although the new user cannot access your data without authenticating with your password, but some of his new data will be synced automatically with your icloud. Signing out your icloud means you have unbinded your data with the connect device.\nThis article should help you resolve it https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT205064\nI hope this answers your question.

At first I put my language German, and my country Austria. But now I have changed my default language to English, and my country to United States. I also changed the preferred language in podcast settings.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open iTunes on an iPad.\n\n*Scroll to the bottom and find a setting to Change Region; you may need to set up a new payment subscription.\n\n*Restart the iPad.\n\nSimilarly, on an iPhone,\n\n*\n\n*Open iTunes.\n\n*Scroll again to the bottom and find the option to Change Region.\n\n*Restart the iPhone.\n\nThen open Podcasts and all should be well in either case.\n\nA: Search should find podcasts in other languages, no matter what your app setting is set to. You can change the app language in the settings (see below). To change your suggestions in the Browse tab you will most likely have to change your Billing Address as suggested per comment.\n\nYou can simply select the language in the settings app.\nOpen the settings app, locate the Podcasts tab and set your preferred language.

Not being able to do so means I have one SSD drive almost full and the other largely empty.\nMy question is: Has anyone else found a way to organize files in such a way that the Mac treats the two internal SSD drives effectively as one?\n\nA: I haven't tried this myself but you should be able to create an APFS volume group from your two drives to effectively create one \"Fusion\" drive. You would use\nsudo diskutil apfs create\n\nor\nsudo diskutil apfs createContainer\n\nto accomplish this. You can run those commands as-is to read usage. Also see the manual page for diskutil (man diskutil).\nThe advantage of a Fusion drive is that you don't have to manually manage which files get put onto which drive; the whole thing behaves like a RAID 0 array (i.e., JBOD, \"Just a Bunch of Disks\"). The downside is that you're now multiplying your chances of total data loss if there's corruption on either of the drives. So before beginning, you are very strongly advised to create AND maintain a backup of your data.\n\nA: You can set Photos.app to have its library at a given location in its preferences.\nAs for Documents: there's nothing to stop you just storing all (or some) of your documents on a folder on another drive. You can even put a folder in the Finder sidebar to the location to make it easy to navigate to.\nFiles don't need to go in the Documents folder, and there's nothing special about it (apart from annoying security requests in Catalina and up).\n", "Q: A \"Library\"-folder appeared in my Documents folder on Mac, Is that normal? After starting my computer I have seen a new folder called \"Libary\" that appeared in my documents folder on macOS. I can't access it, because, according to the prompt, I don't have permission, even though I have access as admin.\nThe folder “Library” can’t be opened because you don’t have permission to see its contents.\n\nAccording to the information, it has a size of 0 bytes and was created today after starting up.\nIs that normal, malware, or something else?\n\nA: I am seeing the same issue as you and other commenters, the Library folder is likely result of a bug following the 03/04/2021 Creative Cloud update. I had a message on the 4th stating I was signed out of CC app, and I quit the app instead, and at next launch was still logged in.\nThere are odd behaviors with this release. I am going to stop it from launching at startup until next release.\n\nA: This was reported by several of our users as well so I did some digging.\nThe Library folder itself is owned by root and only root has rwx access. The only folder inside on three different machines I tested was a Logs folder. This Logs folder was empty. All three machines had the same behavior and a similar setup. Deleting the folder was only temporary as it would return after a restart.\nAfter some more digging and some input from Reddit users with the same issue, I believe it has to do with Adobe CC. I removed CC completely, deleted the folder, restarted and it hasn't come back. Before then it was coming back after every restart.\nAdobe has published a patch to fix this folder (i.e. to not have it reappear again after you deleted it): https://helpx.adobe.com/download-install/kb/library-folder-created-on-macos.html\n\nA: It's not 'normal', certainly. (But every computer is different!)\nMy first suspicion is that some software has got the path wrong, so instead of saving files to /Library, it's saving them to /Documents/Library.\nI would open up the Terminal and see if there are any subfolders or zero-size files inside, which might give a clue to what's causing it. At the very least, you can delete it and see if, and when it grows back.\nTo see who owns the folder and what its permissions are:\ncd ~/Documents\nls -l Library\n\nTo change the permissions so you can read the contents, something like:\nsudo chmod -R a+r ~/Documents/Library\n\nAlternatively, opening a root shell will allow you to inspect the contents in the Terminal.\n", "Q: \"No device connected\" for Wacom One tablet I have a Wacom One attached via mini-USB to my macbook pro 2020 running Catalina.

Apparently the \"tremendous weight\" of the usb-c cable for the iPhone - which was a bit entangled with the mini-USB cable to the Wacom -  was just enough to put the Wacom connector out of sorts. Jiggling the cable to the iPhone apparently undid that \"flakey cable\" issue.\nSo the only potential value now to this question is to confirm YES the Wacom One is  working (surprisingly I might add) with macOS Catalina.\nUpdate Apparently there is a specific power cord for Wacom that has a few parts including hdmi, power cable, mini-usb.

(Note that I'm on Big Sur, Karabiner 13.3). Here's what worked for me:\nAfter the first time that I installed and activated your shortcut and tried to use it a dialog came up asking to allow some accessibility or privacy permission. I accepted it without noting exactly what it said but looking through the Privacy permissions in System Preferences I saw that a permission for Automation to allow \"karabiner_console_user_server\" to control \"Terminal\" had been added and its checkbox was checked. At first I didn't think the shortcut had done anything but then I found that Terminal had been opened and the tmux script had been run. (I don't have the tmux script so it failed for me but was displayed in Terminal as a command.) Terminal was the bottom most application (shown last in the application chooser). So when testing the shortcut be sure that Terminal isn't hiding behind everything.\nAt one point I found that if Terminal was running but hidden behind other apps, using the shortcut did work but left it hidden. When it was visible the shortcut did appear to work as desired.\nIn continued testing I checked and unchecked the Automation preference checkbox at various times and when it was checked the shortcut did attempt to run the tmux script. When it was not checked Terminal did open (behind other apps) but the script appeared not to run. I was not asked to accept any privacy permissions after the first time it had asked after installation (probably because Apple prefers confusing someone by not displaying repeated permission requests rather than annoying someone with multiple requests and confusion tends to result in fewer complaints than annoyances).\nSo be sure that the Automation privacy permission in System Preferences that I mentioned above exists and that it is checked. It's probably a good idea to quit and restart Karabiner-Elements as well; I did that at various times just in case. If the permission isn't shown (checked or unchecked) then something else isn't working. Adding permissions for an application to automate another something that, for some reason, can't be added manually and is only asked for when one actually does something that requires the permission (and possibly only once), don't ask me why. (Note that I didn't ever shut down and restart to see if I'd be asked to allow the permission again though I think it wouldn't. I'm not sure.)\nI hope getting the shortcut to work is as simple as this but I imagine there are plenty of other possibilities that might be the issue.\n", "Q: My MacBook Has Run Out of Memory My MacBook Air 2017 13\" has run out of memory.

Thanks!\n\nA: Have you checked that zoom has the right permissions?\nOpen Preferences > Security & Privacy > Screen Recording and check that zoom.us.app is allowed to record your screen. \nAlso check on Preferences > Security & Privacy > Full Disk Access an allow zoom.us.app access. \nLastly, check Preferences > Security & Privacy > Files and Folders and check that zoom.us.app has access to the download folder (presumably to receive files).\n\nI don't know if allowing only access to this folder and then moving the files you want to share there may allow you to send and receive without allowing Full Disk Access that seems excessive.\n", "Q: Error: -69519 when resizing partition of apfs container scheme I am trying to resize the partition disk0s2 in my Mac.

I'd like to be able to use an eyedropper tool on command. The built-in Mac colour picker is nice, so to that end, I set up a keyboard shortcut using BetterTouchTool to open the colour picker; it does so simply by running the choose color AppleScript command.\nThis is only a partial solution, because I still need to click the eyedropper icon to get what I want. Apart from the minor nuisance of an extraneous click, the problem is that the click itself changes focus away from the application I'm using. (For example, suppose I'm using the eyedropper to test the :focus state of an element on a website.)\nIs there a way to tell my script to run the eyedropper tool after opening the colour picker? In other words, I would like to automatically click the button indicated in this screenshot:\n\n\nA: Updated Answer\nI download the trial of BetterTouchTool and resolved the issue in the following manner:\n\n*\n\n*Added a keyboard shortcut assigning it: ⇧⌃P\n\n*Added the built-in Show Color Picker action to the aforementioned keyboard shortcut.\n\n*Added a Run AppleScript (async in background) action, to the aforementioned keyboard shortcut, with the following AppleScript code:\n\n    tell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n        click (checkbox 1 of ¬\n            splitter group 1 of ¬\n            window \"Colors\" of ¬\n            application process \"BetterTouchTool\")\n\nNote that this was done under macOS Big Sur and it works without issue after the initial setup and permissions setting as were prompted.\nNow when I press ⇧⌃P the Color window opens and the color picker button is clicked, and it is active to select a color where the mouse pointer was when the keyboard shortcut was pressed.\n\nOriginal Answer\nI do not have BetterTouchTool, so using Script Editor I find that if one just runs the choose color command, the Colors window is modal and does not allow any additional code that would click the color picker button to run.\nTo work around this, the choose color command can be wrapped within an ignoring application responses statement. However, while this allows the color picker button to be clicked by additional code, one does not get back, e.g. {14896, 20151, 65429} from the choose color command when the OK button is cliched after picking the color.\nExample AppleScript code:\nignoring application responses\n    choose color\nend ignoring\n\ndelay 0.5\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    click (checkbox 1 of ¬\n        splitter group 1 of ¬\n        window \"Colors\" of ¬\n        application process \"Script Editor\")\n\n\nThis was tested under macOS Catalina.\n\nA: I’m not sure if this will help you, but if all you are looking to do is retrieve the color values at your exact mouse coordinates, this alternate solution may be an option for you.\nThis following AppleScript code added as an AppleScript action to a new Automator Quick Action, will allow you to retrieve color values at your exact mouse coordinates, without the need to call on System Events or any Color Picker GUI.\n\nI saved my version in Automator as “Eyedropper At Mouse Location.workflow”.  I then assigned it the keyboard shortcut ⇧⌃P in System Preferences/Keyboard/Shortcuts/Services. Now, pressing the keyboard shortcut ⇧⌃P while in any application, will retrieve the RGB color values at my exact mouse location.\n—————————————————————————————————————-\nThis code requires the third-party utility, Cliclick.\n\n“Cliclick” is short for “Command-Line Interface Click”. It is a a tiny shell/Terminal application that will emulate mouse clicks or series of mouse clicks (including doubleclicks and control-clicks) at arbitrary screen coordinates. Moreover, it lets you move the mouse, get the current mouse coordinates, press modifier keys etc.\n\nIt's free to download but it's donationware, and is easy to install.\nOn my system I have. cliclick in the following directory: /usr/local/bin/. Because of this location, in my AppleScript code and in Terminal app, I need to use the full path to cliclick to call the command. For example: do shell script \"/usr/local/bin/cliclick rc:.\" In AppleScript is telling cliclick to right-click.\n—————————————————————————————————————-\nI’m not quite sure what you intend to do with the color values retrieved so I created three different variables… rgbColors (R,G,B values as integers as record), theColors (R,G,B values as text as list), and theColorsAsText (R,G,B values as 1 long string)\nproperty rgbColors : {R:0, G:0, B:0}\n\nset theColors to words of ¬\n    ((do shell script \"/usr/local/bin/cliclick cp:.\") as string) as list\n\nset theColorsAsText to ((\"Red:\" & theColors's item 1) & \"  Green:\" & ¬\n    theColors's item 2) & \"  Blue:\" & theColors's item 3\n\n(* Not Necessary But This Will Store The Values As A Record Making It ¬\nEasier To Call On Or Manipulate, If Need Be, In Other Parts Of The Script*)\nset {rgbColors's R, rgbColors's G, rgbColors's B} to ¬\n    {theColors's item 1 as integer, theColors's item 2 as integer, ¬\n        theColors's item 3 as integer}\n\nactivate\ndisplay dialog theColorsAsText buttons {\"OK\"} ¬\n    default button \"OK\" giving up after 4\n\n", "Q: cl date function working differently in Intel and M1 machines I have a shell script to calculate the number of days from a particular date:\necho D$((($(date +%s)-$(date +%s --date \"2018-01-01\"))/(3600*24)))\n\nOn my 2019 MBP (Intel), it works.

A straightforward way to accomplish this is by gathering a spindump.\n\n*\n\n*Run the following Terminal command to enable kernel symbolication: sudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\". Make sure to copy-paste this so that you're entering straight quotes rather than curly/“smart” quotes. (If you get a permission error, you will first need to disable System Integrity Protection.

Before iOS 13, one could have a photo up, and could go do something else on his iPhone for a while and go back to the photo and it would still be that same photo.  On iOS 13, however, if you leave the photo for any longer than a couple minutes, that photo is no longer on your screen but it just goes to your entire photo gallery.  Can this iOS 13 bug be fixed somehow?\n\nA: This bug you are describing is the phone not being able to keep the photos app opened in the background, which is a limitation of the phones RAM and how software handles the RAM management. However, many factors can change how many apps and which ones it can keep open in the background. This is also nothing iPhone specific, even computers - windows, macOS, Linux, i.e. every operating system - have to manage the available RAM.\nPossible factors that (could have) changed for your iPhone:\n\n*\n\n*Software update: iOS is closed-source, i.e. no-one exactly knows how iOS is programmed, however, a full iOS update has many changes not only to the OS itself but also to its built-in apps like the photos app. Adding more features to an operating system usually also means your device has to handle more things at the same time, therefore some things may slow down.\n\n*More apps open at once: If you have many apps open at once iOS tries to figure out how to keep as many open as possible, which sometimes means that one big app (especially big games) may be closed earlier than others, even if they were used later.\n\n*Battery degradation: Depending whether you have enabled maximum performance under battery settings, your phone may limit its general performance, as the battery might not be able to power the phone under peak load anymore.\n\n*Other factors: It is really hard to predict what exactly may have caused an app being closed. It could even be something as simple like you getting a big email that your phone is trying to download in the background and therefore needs to free some RAM.\n\nHowever, if you test under as close conditions as possible to how it worked under iOS 12, you can most likely pinpoint it to iOS 13, which is very well possible.\nIn this case you'd need to have a backup to revert to the previous iOS version.\n", "Q: Opening pdfs on firefox in a new tab Using Firefox 86.0 on Big Sur 11.2 and I am trying to find out how to immediately open pdfs in a new tab on firefox when I am given the option to download them.

The keyboard navigation works, but, again, the Tab key only switches between the left list and the \"Search\" field, and I'm unable to click on \"Click the lock to make changes\" so, it's all helpless.\nI Googled for similar issues, but so far found nothing heplful.\nDoes anyone have some idea where to look, what to try?\n\nA: It seems that this very specific issue (ineffective mouse clicks in file picker dialogs and in System Preferences) is surprisingly common on Big Sur and Monterey.  A couple of workarounds that seem to help a bit in some circumstances:\n\n*\n\n*file dialog: resize the dialog\n\n*System Preferences: minimize and then\nun-minmize it\n\n\nThe only way that I have found to immediately resolve the problem is:\nkillall Finder\nkillall Dock\n\nA million thanks to (apparently) the same person who posted this in both Apple Community forums and on Reddit, as that's the only place I seen it, after tons of web searching:\njondavidschober on Apple Community and Littlejd97 on r/MacOS\n\nA: So I tested it in the \"Safe mode\" and no problem. After I restarted to normal mode, the problem is also gone ‍♂️\nStrange, I know I have quite a long uptime, but I installed an update to macOS 11.2.2 last week and the problem survived the installation of the update and restart.\nHope it will never return \n", "Q: Selectively disabling notifications in macOS At random intervals, DropBox pops up a notification telling me that it's almost full and that I should buy an upgrade. There is no way to disable this notification within the DropBox app (it's how they make money after all), but I would like to block it.\nHowever, I still want to see other notifications from DropBox. So I want to block notifications from this app selectively based on their content, e.g. only if they contain the string \"almost full\".\nSo:\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to do this from within System Preferences? (It seems not but there's no harm in asking.)\n\n\n*Is there a way to do it by typing something clever at the terminal?\n\n\n*Is there a reputable third-party app that can do it?\nPS: I'm 100% certain there is no feature in DropBox to disable these notifications. The question is about whether there is a way in MacOS or a third party app to filter notifications from a given app selectively based on content. Presumably, if a solution exists, it will not be specific to the DropBox app but will be a general solution to the problem of filtering notifications.\n\nA: Unfortunately, no. Dropbox notifications are all or nothing. Selecting which sort of notification to ignore is not an option - it just isn't granular enough. I've searched for an official Dropbox feature or enhancement request mechanism, and in the Dropbox Community forums there is a Share an Idea section which may be actually viewed by Dropbox developers.\nGood Luck\n", "Q: How to prevent MacOS from adding dot underscore files (._whatever.html )in zip archives? Our organisation receives zip files from Mac users which contain a ._ file in addition to the file we expect. In the past this was due to resource fork and data fork encoding limitations on other file systems. So for example, when we expect a submission that looks like this:\nREADME.md\nsrc/mysite.html\nsrc/myscript.js\n\nwe generally receive a zip that contains files such as:\n._README.md\nREADME.md\nsrc/._mysite.html\nsrc/mysite.html\nsrc/._myscript.js\nsrc/myscript.js\n\nThis makes it difficult for us to process these files automatically. What instructions should we give to our Mac users to suppress these files we can’t process or handle?\n\nA: There's no native way to automatically exclude resource forks or other extended attribute and filesystem metadata during compression, but many 3rd party apps can do it. These files contain filesystem data that should be preserved and you get a valuable signal that you have lost data when your process strips or ignores these files.\nOne such is Keka (donationware, ie free direct download, paid from App Store)\n\n\nA: No, it is not possible to prevent the creation of resource fork files - the native zip function is designed to preserve this filesystem specific data so you would need to instruct your team to use a different tool or process.\nIt will likely be easier to improve your tooling to ignore files it knows are safe to ignore than to force a change in the behaviour of your users.\ndot_clean on macOS\nInstead, clean the files before ingesting them with macOS's dot_clean:\n\nFor each dir, dot_clean recursively merges all ._* files with their corresponding native files according to the rules specified with the given arguments.  By default, if there is an attribute on the native file that is also present in the ._ file, the most recent attribute will be used.\n\nfind on Linux\nOn Linux, use find to recursively remove all the matching files:\nfind  . -type f -name '\\._*' -exec rm {} \\;\n\n\nA: Yes!\nI faced this problem for some time using bootloaders on embedded devices that use the USB Mass Storage Class. Adding these tracking files will usually corrupt the firmware and it's really frustrating. But there is a solution.\nFirst, when opening the drive do not navigate there in Finder AT ALL. Don't open it. Don't look at it. Don't do anything.\nSecond, open Terminal. We're going to use the cp command to copy the files. However, the key here is the -X option which for macOS will prevent the addition of the resource files.\nFor example:\ncp -X lpc11u35_gr_mango_if_crc_20200717.bin /Volumes/CRP\\ DISABLD/\n\nBingo! No dot-underscore file. No .DS_Store. Nothing, nada, zip, zilch. I know it's tedious to have to go to the terminal, but in cases like this it's a lot better than having a Windows or Linux VM on standby for stupid issues like this.\n", "Q: How to draw onto a shape that I just drew in Preview.app? When drawing using draw tool, if I hover over a shape or image it turns into the hand tool and then I can't draw. How do I fix this?\n\n\nA: In Preview app and once the shape is drawn, you can only move, rotate or resize it.\nHere is an article that comes from the Apple's Preview User Guide :\n\nYou can add a shape to a PDF or to an image using the Shapes tool in the Markup toolbar, and then rotate the shape or change its sides or angles.\n\nIf the hand cursor persists or the shape you just drew does not suit you : click on the Sketch or Draw button again to draw a new shape.\nIf you want to draw onto a shape you have just added : close the image preview you were editing after saving it and re-open the file so the shape will be considered as part of the image.\n", "Q: Change login info in Screen Sharing recents list Running Big Sur 11.2.1 on my laptop, I have a Mac Mini I connect to via Screen Sharing -- it is in the Recents list.

Bring All To Front option doesn't work.\nSometimes I can bring up Mission Control and see the window hiding amongst all my other apps and clicking that works.\nSometimes it doesn't show up anywhere at all and opening new documents just brings the app to the front but no windows are visible.\nSome have suggested it sometimes does this strange thing of collapsing to a thin line but this doesn't happen in my case.\nI completely deleted it and replaced it with latest version 1.54.0 but that didn't fix it.\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: When you open Atom or a file by right clicking Atom icon, you may not see your atom window but you will be able to see the top bar like below\n\nNow Select \"Tile Window to the left of the screen\" and click on another file and select \"Tile Window to the right of the screen\".\nOnce you see both the screens you should be able to minimize/ maximize or close and reopen. When you restart you should be able to see the full Atom Window.\n\nA: Yes its happening in Atom.\nIn my case it hid in the left corner as a thin line. I put cursor around and found out then resize.\nI also tried split screen where hidden windows will show, but it does not work all the time if it hides as thin line window.\n", "Q: New file on my Macbook Pro with odd custom permissions. Have I been hacked? So today I was looking for something on my MacBook Pro and saw folder called library with the custom permissions.\nIt seems like it has to permissions, systems (read, write) and everyone no access.\nI expanded the permissions so that I could view it. However it seems to have an empty folder inside. The empty folder has the same permissions.\nThe folder is located in my iCloud > Documents folder and is called Library and the folder inside of it is also Logs.\nAdditionally I can see that the file was created two days ago.\nMoreover, I have all sharing services turned off in my Systems Preferences > Sharing.\nThere is currently no user profile under the name of systems in System Preferences > Users & Groups.\nWhy do I have a new file with custom permissions ? Have I been hacked? Is there something I can check to see if there is something wrong going on?\n(Also got an email recently saying someone tried to reset a BestBuy password but that my be irrelevant for this)\n\nA: /Library is where system files are kept - configurations for applications, etc. Generally, unless something is broken, you wouldn't need to access /Library for anything. Your main location for your files - the ones you need to access is actually /Users. Hence, permissions for System Only are right for /Library\nI would likewise not be concerned about something that says \"Logs\" on it. Logging is a useful tool for diagnostics - or to put it another way - to work out what is going on or where something may have gone wrong.\n", "Q: Can I change the startup sound on macOS Big Sur? I wanted to find the audio file with the startup chime and either switch it with another one of mine or edit it but i can't locate the file.\nDoes anyone know of a way of finding this file or to get the same wanted result in another way?\n\nA: On an Intel Mac, the startup chime is part of the Mac's firmware. You can't just replace it, like you could a normal audio file.\nThink about this logically—the startup chime plays as soon as you turn on your computer, before it loads the operating system. And if you wipe your hard drive, the sound will still play. How would that be possible, if the chime was stored on your drive?\n\nA: On Intel Macs with T2 chip, the startup sound is stored in there.\nYou can change the sound by jailbreaking it with Checkra1n.\n0. You will need another Mac or Linux PC.\n\n*\n\n*Jailbreak the T2 with Checkra1n.\n\n*Connect to it with SSH.\n\n*Convert the startup sound file to aiff.\n\n*Replace /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/BridgeAccessibilitySupport.framework/AXEFIAudio_VoiceOver_Boot.aiff with that file. (Back up the original file before doing.)\n\n*Use the ‘snappy’ command to make the change permanent.\n\nFor more information, please refer to https://checkm8.info/blog/customize-macos-boot\n", "Q: Bootcamp cannot be selected through option key after patitioning using recovery I have installed windows 10 on my Macbook late 2009 unibody and thus far have worked well.\nI wanted to increase the capacity of my Bootcamp partition so I used recovery to reduce the size of Macos and allocate that space to windows 10, upon restarting the device I was unable to boot in Bootcamp and macos, Bootcamp does not show up when pressing the option key through resetting pram [\nAfter resetting Pram I am able to boot into Macos but not into bootcamp1I was able to boot through macos and see that macos can still detect the Bootcamp partition2\nBut by Opening bootcamp through this way it shouwed \"No bootable device, insert boot disk and press enter\"\nResults from diskutil list:\nApples-MacBook:~ apple$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *250.1 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Untitled                119.8 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data unti                    49.2 GB    disk0s4\n   5:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                80.0 GB    disk0s5\n\nResults From sudo fdisk /dev/disk0/ :\nApples-MacBook:~ apple$ sudo fdisk /dev/disk0\nPassword:\nDisk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 30401/255/63 [488397168 sectors]\nSignature: 0xAA55\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -     409639] <Unknown ID>\n 2: AF 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [    409640 -  234038808] HFS+        \n 3: AB 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 234448448 -    1269536] Darwin Boot \n 4: 0B 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 235717984 -   96168608] Win95 FAT-32\n\nResults from gpt show:\ngpt show: /dev/disk0: Suspicious MBR at sector 0\n      start       size  index  contents\n          0          1         MBR\n          1          1         Pri GPT header\n          2         32         Pri GPT table\n         34          6         \n         40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B\n     409640  234038808      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  234448448    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC\n  235717984   96168608      4  GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7\n  331886592     262144         \n  332148736  156248064      5  GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7\n  488396800        335         \n  488397135         32         Sec GPT table\n  488397167          1         Sec GPT header\n\n\nA: The error message appears when there is no partition flagged as active in the Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table. The sudo fdisk /dev/disk0 command prints out the contents of the MBR table. The active partition is indicated by an * character. This is absent in your posted output.

If the fifth partition contains windows, then you would need to first put the fifth partition in the MBR. Most users opt to download and use the gdisk command do this.\nI should warn you that if you fix this problem, there still exists the possibility that Windows may interpret your repartitioning actions as an attempt to illegally clone Windows to a new machine. If this happens, then the easiest solution to this problem would be to rebuild the BCD.\nThe commands below can be entered to put the fifth partition back in the MBR partition table and make the partition active.

I assume you mean that you have used the standard 128-bit AES encryption that Disk Utility offers by default.\nYou can verify that the image file is encrypted by running:\nhdiutil info\n\nIn the output it will state:\n\nimage-encrypted : TRUE\n\nonly if the image file is encrypted.\nIf you want more specific details about the encryption used, you can run this command:\nhdiutil imageinfo myimage.dmg\n\nThis requires that you know the password to decrypt the image.\nFor an encrypted image it will show the following under \"Properties\":\n\nEncrypted: true\n\nAnd under \"Backing Store Information\" it will list the type of encryption:\n\nEncryption: AES-128\n\nUPDATE: In the comments you have indicated that you really wanted to know this information specifically for \"sparse bundles\" (not savings bundles). In that case, you can still use the above mentioned commands to find out if the files are encrypted, however it does not display the encryption algorithm used.\nThis information is available in a header placed in the token file in the root of the sparse bundle.

So, I've decided not to store my health data in iCloud anymore, for various reasons. I just want to have it on my iPhone and on my iPhone backup on my Mac.\nHere's what I have tried so far:\nSo I turned off Health in iCloud on my iPhone and hoped it would delete all the Health data from my iCloud account. It didn't though, here's a screenshot:\n\nIt seems like it only stopped backing up new data but the old data remains online.\nSo I tried to delete it via the iCloud settings on my Mac, which gives me this prompt:\n\n(Note: There is no Health folder in Finder iCloud Drive).\nIs it safe to click delete or will it also wipe all my data from my iPhone and Apple Watch Health apps?\nAnd if this operation deletes it everywhere, where can I delete it on iCloud only?\n\nA: Health Syncing in iCloud will not appear in iCloud Backups or in iCloud Drive. It is stored directly in iCloud rather than in iCloud Drive or other sub-service.\nIf you turn off the Health switch on your phone, then you have disconnected the local Health repository from the cloud. You can safely delete your Cloud health data after doing this.\nHealth data is stored End-to-End encrypted, unlike backups. The article you linked to refers to iCloud Backups, a different system. When you turn off the Health switch, it will start backing Health up to the non-end-to-end encrypted iCloud Backup. You must also turn off the Health feature in iCloud Backup to avoid this.\n--\nThe phrasing on the Mac is different and likely flawed. The same delete button you've shown on the phone makes it clear that you're only deleting it in iCloud, not per-device.\n", "Q: Is it possible to get back one earlier \"copy\" to paste it back? I typed for 200 words to send to a customer support of a company, and then I copied the content just to keep a copy in my Gmail or Google Docs.\nHowever, before I pasted, I made a phone call using Google voice and pasted the phone number to Google Voice call to dial the number.\nSo the 200 words content is gone.  Is there a way to get it back?  The 200 words is such a small size (probably less than 2kbyte), and this MacBook is used only by me, so I don't worry about privacy of being able to show earlier copy and paste contents.  Is there a way to get that earlier copy back?\n\nA: Not by default, no. The pasteboard is a temporary storage area, with no safety net. (One of the reasons that MacOS didn't have Cut and Paste of files in the Finder for many years, it is often said.)\nThere are plenty of apps in the Mac App Store, and elsewhere, that enhance the Pasteboard's capabilities by storing the pasteboard's 'history'.\nI use Yoink, which does many Drag-Copy-Paste things, including this. Other more simple apps include things like CommandClip, which just keeps the last 10 text entries. Note that this may include passwords, so care should be taken.\n", "Q: mac OS microphone only works when System Preferences Dictation pane is open When using my Mac on various apps (Zoom, Quicktime audio recorder, Skype etc.), the input from all microphones is extremely quiet and voices become inaudible.\nThis occurs for the inbuilt microphone, for Bluetooth headphones, and for AUX headphones.\nThe input volume is turned up to max (see pic below)\n\nBut very strangely, when I open the Dictation Preference Pane (pic below), the microphone then works normally in all apps.\n\nAnyone have any ideas why this might be occuring? And how I can fix it so that the microphone input works normally all the time?\n\nA: I ran into this problem a year ago on a Macbook A1708 and no solution other than dictation worked. Today my patience snapped, I contacted Apple support and continued to look for a way out of the situation without waiting for an answer. After 6 hours I decided to just brush the right mesh of the case with a toothbrush and it was the right decision. Now the microphone works like new. Why did this happen (theory): there are two microphones in the macbook, the main one is clogged, and when you turn on dictation or Siri, the SECOND MICROPHONE turns on.\nSorry for bad english, I'm Russian.\n", "Q: vlc on mac, how to just play videos/songs without the main menu with media library/playlist coming up I just want to click videos and have them play, not have to close this annoying main menu screen everytime, I googled, checked settings, is it not possible?\n\nA: A bit of guesswork required based on very little information, but try\nPrefs > Video > Show video within the main window.\nThat will make it so the playlist window is re-used as the video display window.\n", "Q: Only Transmission traffic through VPN I would like to use my favourite torrent client, Transmission, over a VPN service but at the same time I do not want to direct any other traffic therethrough. That is, I want to use my VPN service only for torrenting with the Transmission client.\nI intend to use NordVPN service and I am coming across 2 problems:\n\n*\n\n*NordVPN offers IKEv2 and OpenVPN protocols on Mac and I'm not sure\nwhether and how I can connect to this VPN so that NOT all traffic is\ndirected therethrough. As for the IKEv2 settings in Mac's Network\nPreferences, there is no \"Send all traffic over VPN connection\"\noption to keep unchecked, like it is for L2TP VPN protocol on Mac.\nAs for the OpenVPN protocol, I'm not sure if this is possible with\nTunnelblick for example or other client.\n\n*Let's say I solve the first\nproblem and I'm connected to the VPN service without sending all the\ntraffic therethrough.

The settings have a preference pane to enable and configure split tunnel.  Here is how it should look to send just Transmission traffic via the VPN.\n\nMy own experience with PIA's split tunnel is that it has been difficult to implement for macOS 11 but is now working reliably.  I had system hangs with the first beta versions of PIA for macOS 11.  I have used PIA's split tunnel the other way round - sending most traffic via the VPN and just specific apps bypassing the VPN.\n", "Q: Making sure Mac M1 doesn't have tracking or screen-capturing software I was given a new MacBook Air (M1) by my employer for work (from home), but I also want to use it as my main personal laptop as well, since having 2 machines doesn't seem necessary.\nThere a chance there might be some software that \"spies\" on me and while I don't do anything illegal or not appropriate (like working for competitors or doing personal things during work time) it's an uncomfortable feeling to know that they might know/see my personal notes or files, etc.\nBTW, I'm not prohibited from reinstalling software, creating users, etc.\nWith these tools at my disposal, what can I do to make sure there's no tracking software?\nI don't even care so much about network traffic as about screen capturing, since it's way more confidential.\nI already started by erasing the disk and re-installing Big Sur. I checked that SIP is enabled.\nWhat else do you think I can do?\nPS. I do have another mac to do the 'target mode' thing I read about, but didn't do that yet.\n\nA: If your employer installs management software, you should not use it as a personal machine, or do so with the expectation it's being tracked. The computer is your employer's property so if they tell you to run a certain enrollment process you should not try to work around this.\nIf it's appropriate to use this as your personal computer, you can and should follow the steps to wipe your computer: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212030.

The Mac running this software has gone the way of all silicon and is now defunct. The data is all backed up; the issue is reading it: the problem is that current versions of Quicken cannot import data from Quicken Essentials for Mac. The data seems to be stored in five binary files in the Quicken folder, and just poking around at the bytes of the file doesn't give me any particular hope of decyphering them manually. Is there any current personal finance software that can import the data from Quicken Essentials for Mac?\n\nA: Broadly speaking, I would create a virtual machine running Mac OS El Capitan and then install Quicken Essentials for Mac onto that. Once that works fine, I'd copy across the five binary files and test to see that they can be opened and viewed just fine from within Quicken Essentials for Mac.\nAssuming this works as expected, what you need to do from here depends on what the end goal is, and the actual version of Quicken Essentials for Mac.\nFor example, if all they want to do is be able to view the data if/when needed, then exporting to CSV files may be all they need to do. These can then be imported/viewed in a plethora of software (including Apple's Numbers and MS Excel).\nOn the other hand, if they want to make full use of the data in a newer version of Quicken, then importing CSV files may not even be supported (depending on the version and platform, etc). In this case they may need to export the data into a different format (once again, depending on the version they have) and then using a newer version of Quicken (but not a recent version) or another third party app to import the data and export it into a suitable format for use/importing by the current version of Quicken.\nThe whole process is going to be somewhat messy as the absence of a common cross-platform file format was one of the biggest issues of Quicken software (not just between Mac/Windows, but between OS 9 and OS X versions and between PowerPC and Intel and so on). Intuit just never really handled things very well and lots of users got burned because of it.\nI'd be happy to update/expand this answer when it's clearer what the exact situation is and what your relative wants to achieve.\nUPDATE\nQuicken stores data in a proprietary QDF file format, but has always offered options for exporting data into other formats. Unfortunately, the options offered have differed over time and with different versions.\nThis means you need to find alternative software that can either import data from Quicken's native QDF format, or software that can import data from one of the other exported formats Quicken has supported from time to time.\nIn most cases, the best workflow for migrating from Quicken to another product is to export the data from Quicken into either the QIF or OFX format. QIF is a format supported by many financial packages, while the Open Financial Exchange (OFX) format is used by banks and supported by most (if not all) financial packages.\nQuicken's support for OFX has been hit and miss, but most versions have supported exporting into the QIF format. So if your relative can get their version of Quicken Essentials for Mac to export data into one of these formats then that's a good start. Otherwise it's a case of determining what format they can export into and then working out the best way forward from there.\nAs for an alternative to Quicken, there's a lot out there. Free versus paid and cloud based versus desktop based.\nBanktivity\nAssuming they're still using a Mac and want to run Mac native software, then one option is to use Banktivity1. Banktivity also offers native iPad and iPhone apps.\nTwo potential cons for this (depending on your relative's situation) is that the current version requires macOS Catalina or higher, and that they've now moved to a subscription model. However, if you don't renew you can still access and use the app - I think it's only the online services you lose access to.\nIf that's a no go, then the previous version did run on macOS Sierra and wasn't based on a subscription, but I'm not sure if/where that's still available.\nOn a positive note, your relative can try it free for a month and see if it'll meet their needs. This should give them enough time to test it's ability to import data (as it fully supports importing data from QIF files). This may be enough for them to file their 2020 taxes.\nMoneyWiz\nAnother option is MoneyWiz, a very popular version for Mac and iOS users. This also supports importing data from CSV, QIF, and OFX files. I have personally used this app (on both Mac and iOS), and am very happy with it - although I have to admit it did take me quite a while to get used to how it works.\nAlso, I've never used it to migrate from Quicken so can't advise as to how easy this is or isn't to do. I do note, though, that they do have a support page entitled Importing from Quicken Essentials for Mac to MoneyWiz which actually suggests importing data from CSV files rather than QIF files.\nFrom memory, they only offer a one week trial period, so your relative won't get as much time to test it out. They've also moved to a subscription based service, but do (or at least did) offer a one-time license option too (but I have no idea of the cost and what you miss out on if you opt for that).\nGnuCash\nGnuCash is not a product I have actually used, but it is free and has versions for macOS, Windows and Linux. Maybe even more.\nIt also supports importing data from QIF and OFX files, so it may be an option for your relative.\nNOTE: Since your relative has 30 years of financial records, and assuming they get their current version of Quicken to work in a virtual machine, they will probably find it easier to leave their historical data in Quicken and start with a fresh set of records in whatever package they decide to migrate to. At least, that's what I've found many users have had to do when changing financial packages after a long period of time.\n\n1. I am not affiliated in any way with this product, nor have I personally used it. However, I do know of people who have used it and are very happy with it.\n", "Q: A bunch of seemingly random files disappeared from my Mac Summary: I just discovered that a lot of files were removed from my personal Mac two months ago. There is seemingly no pattern to which files are missing, except that no folders got deleted and only directories synched to iCloud Drive were affected. I suspect some software or misconfiguration to be at fault here, but I can't pin it down.\n\nI first discovered this three weeks ago when some slides for a past lecture were gone. I was sceptical, since the empty folder was still there, but I let it go. A few days later I noticed more files missing and when I tell you my heart dropped. I sat down and went through all directories and sure enough, about 20% of my filesystem is gone.\nUsing my backups I was able to gather a lot of information about the affected files, and I can tell from the last modified date of affected folders that the files were removed on 10.01.2021 at around 2:00 am. Here is what I found out:\n\nAffected Files:\nThere is no pattern regarding the file itself. Affected files are of every possible type (TXT, PDF, DOCX, PAGES, JPEG, MP4), file names are not related (no special characters etc.), creation and modification dates range from December to 4 years ago. Sizes range from >2 GB MP4's to 0 byte txt-files.\nAffected Folders:\nNo folders were deleted. Files only went missing from random subfolders of Documents, which is synched to iCloud Drive.\nInteresting Edge Cases:\nIn most cases all files in a specific folder are missing. But there are some edge cases which  highlight the randomness of the deletion. The following folder contains scans of my old school reports, where 6 of 11 files are gone. Notice how types, names, sizes and dates are almost identical (there is also 1 Schulnachricht missing):\nFolder containing all files before deletion:\n\nThe same folder after 10.01.2021:\n\nThis is a similar case involving slides from a previous lecture, were 7 out of 9 PDFs were removed:\nFolder containing all files before deletion:\n\nThe same folder after 10.01.2021:\n\nMy Setup:\nI am using a 2018 13-inch MacBook Pro running Big Sur 11.2.1 (20D74). This machine is backed up to a Time Capsule using Time Machine. I also use a PC running Windows 10 (20H2) which is synched to iCloud Drive. I realise that the files also could have been deleted on my PC and my Mac synched the changes. I will go down that rabbit hole when I can rule out the Mac as the cause. I am the only user of those devices and nobody else has physical access to them.\n\nEven though I can restore all the missing files I noticed through the backups, I definitely need to investigate the cause of this event. Please throw any ideas you have at me, I am happy to look into every one of them!\n\nUpdate:\nWhile restoring my file system from the backup today, a possible cause came to mind. I might have enabled and, after a few days, disabled optimise Mac storage. Maybe this operation screwed up massively and only left small files behind, which is how my Documents folder shrank from 39 to 2 GB.\n\nA: You have identified the probable cause.  From Apple:\n\nWhen space is needed, it keeps files, photos and videos, Apple TV\nmovies and shows, and email attachments in iCloud and makes them\navailable on demand. Files don’t take up space on your Mac, and you\ncan download the original files when you need them.\n\n", "Q: Cakebrew says \"Error: Calling 'brew search' with no arguments to output formulae is disabled!\" I am a new macOS user. I just did a fresh install on an A1398 MacBook Pro and upgraded to Big Sur. As I am used to package managers, I decided to investigate Homebrew and Cakebrew to go along with it. I was able to install Homebrew, with no warnings or errors. Then, I installed Cakebrew with the brew command.\nUpon launching Cakebrew, the \"All Formulae\" list reports the following error:\n\nError: Calling 'brew search' with no arguments to output formulae is disabled! Use 'brew formulae' instead.\n\nThe same error occurs if I execute brew search on the command-line.\n\nA: Your error is from the brew command, and Cakebrew is just reporting it. You can see the error if, in Terminal, you do: brew search.  I suspect that your Cakebrew has not kept up with changes to the brew command.\nThe version of Cakebrew installed via HomeBrew is version 1.2.5. I have always used that from Cakebrew web site. From there you will get version 1.2.7.  Try that.  The \"All Formulae\" list works for me.\nEdit: The question was also asked here github. The recommendation is to update to version 1.3.  This fixes the issue.\n", "Q: Automatic (or a quick) way to add page numbers to a pdf document I have a macbook and am running Big Sur 11.2.2. I have some pdf documents with over a hundred pages that I need to put in page numbers. I'd rather not have to do this manually for every page, and was wondering if there's a quick way to do this?\nNote that the pdf documents weren't originally word files, in which case I could just go into the word file and put in the page numbers and re-output it as a pdf.\n\nA: I've written a python script that will add page numbers to a PDF (position of your choice, font, size, etc). It's designed to work as a Quick Action (aka Service) in an Automator workflow\nThe Quick Action can be downloaded from here:\nhttps://github.com/benwiggy/PDFsuite/tree/master/Quick_Actions\nand then move it (after unzipping) to the Services folder of your user Library. You may need to create the ~/Library/Services folder, if it doesn't exist.\nThe python script itself is here:\nhttps://github.com/benwiggy/PDFsuite/blob/master/Automator_Scripts/pagenumber.py\nIt uses the macOS-bundled python2, so should run on any Mac from Leopard upward! The script options for size, font are on lines 88 and 89.

This is done by actually having 2 AES keys and a process where the data is continuously \"tweaked\" specifically to avoid such a problem.\nIf you have chosen to format the drive as APFS and not HFS+, then it won't show up when running the above mentioned command. You can check if that is the case by running:\ndiskutil apfs list\n\nThis will show the disk as being APFS formatted. However, it won't show you which encryption type is being used on the drive.\n", "Q: Disable Screen Recording prompt from bluetooth game controller (maybe Big Sur only?) I have an 8bitdo bluetooth controller that I use to play games on my Macbook with the latest Big Sur. I think since the upgrade to Big Sur, sometimes when I am using the controller Mac OS will break fullscreen to pop up a series of confirmations about whether I want to allow different apps that are currently running to record the screen. I have to click through each one to get back to my game. This happens whether I'm actually playing a game/have Steam open, or if I am just sitting on at the desktop. It happens when I have the controller connected to the Mac and press Select and Start at the same time, or sometimes Select and the Special/Meta button. It doesn't happen every time I press these combinations, I do have to press them multiple times to get the issue to repeat, but it happens very often.\nIs there any way to disable screen recording or this \"shortcut\" or whatever it is? I almost never want to record my screen, so turning off the feature would be fine if possible.\n\n\nA: Open the Bluetooth section of your System Preferences app while the controller is connected. There should be an \"Options\" button next to it. This brings up the following panel for my 8bitdo:\n\nChanging both of the mappings for the Share button to \"Off\" did the trick for me.\n", "Q: Filter my Library on Apple Music My 'Library' in Apple Music is too cluttered for the following reason: whenever I add a song, the corresponding album and artist are also added. Similarly, whenever I add an album, all the individual songs of the album are  added as well.\nAs a result, my library is filled with Artists and Albums that I am not interested in and that are there just because I added on the fly (usually through Shazzam) one song that I happened to like. This problem is compounded by the fact that Apple Music links the song to an arbitrarily chosen album, when the song could as legitimately be linked to another album.\nFurthermore, the individual songs that I added because I like them individually are drowned among all the songs of all the albums that I added because I like the albums generally.\nIn order to sort the wheat from the chaff, I would like to see in the each of the three sections (songs, albums, artists) only the  items that I did personally add to it, and hide those that were added there automatically because I added an item elsewhere.\nFor example, if I add 'Yellow submarine' to my songs, I do not want 'The Beatles' to appear among my Artists. I also do not want 'Revolver', '1' or 'The Red Album' to appear among my albums.\nSimilarly, if I do add 'Exile on Main Street' to my albums, I want neither all of its songs added to my songs nor 'The Rolling Stones' added to my Artists.\nIn a word, I want to see just what I added myself - no more, no less.\nIs there a setting or a filter on Apple Music that could help me achieve this? If not, is there a third party app that could link with my library and allow the kind of filtering that I want?\nI thank you in advance for your help and suggestions. W.\nPS: I navigate Apple Music through iOS and macOS devices.\n\nA: iTunes/Music manages your music library which you can access via various views. So if you add a track its artist will always show up in the Artist view, its album will always show up in Albums (and vice versa). The beauty of this is that you can choose to play all Madonna tracks by selecting her in the Artist view, or choose to play a specific album only by selecting it in the Album view.\nObviously this gets difficult to manage the more your library grows. I currently have over 40'000 tracks in iTunes/Music and found that it's much easier to manage if I use playlists to keep things in places where I find them again.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro 16 Failed to boot after Big Sur update now I'm unable to mount the disk even in recovery mode On reboot it showed the cannot boot from hard drive ? screen.\nI rebooted into recovery mode but it fails to mount the drive.

Keep in mind\nthat you will need to use the Activity Monitor or Terminal (killall <appname>) to quit the app if you close the window.\nIf closing the window quits the app, you can press cmd + h to hide\nthe window. This should make your app completely invisible.\nTo make it visible again, just remove those two lines again and the\napp should behave like before.\n\nSource: Link\n\nso, I was stupid and did this on almost all of my apps, without opening any of them in the process, and now they all won't open at all no matter what I do. I've removed the text, I reinstalled the apps, nothing worked.. Please tell me how to fix this, I need this laptop for work as it is my main machine.\n\nA: That previous Q&A should be flagged, I guess, to indicate that it's no longer a good idea. Apps are now digitally signed and notarized, and I'm guessing that editing the .plist invalidated the signature, so Gatekeeper (a macOS feature) won't let them launch anymore.\nHave you rebooted the Mac? That might help. I would delete all of the apps that you modified, reboot the Mac, and try reinstalling one of them.\nThen I would download and install \"ArchiChect\" from The Eclectic Light Company. Howard Oakley, who runs the site, is both knowledgeable and trustworthy.\nDrag the app that won't launch to the ArchiChect app window, and see what it reports.\nIt's possible that you may be able to get the apps to launch by reinstalling them and then manually removing the quarantine flag. However, you should know that doing so will bypass the security features of macOS, which obviously puts you at some risk if these apps have been tampered with.\nAssuming that you are downloading trustworthy apps from trustworthy developers (and not, say, \"pirated\" or \"cracked\" versions from somewhere) there probably is not too much risk, but you should be aware of it nevertheless.\nTo remove the quarantine flag, enter this command in a Terminal.app window:\nxattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine \n\nMake sure there is a space after the word 'quarantine'.\nThen drag the app that won't launch to the Terminal window, so you end up with something that looks like this:\nxattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Carbon\\ Copy\\ Cloner.app\n\n(I just randomly picked an app with a space in a filename to use as an example.)\nIf you get a message about 'Permission Denied' try the same command prefacted with sudo and then be ready to enter your login password (i.e. the password you use to log in to your Mac):\nsudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Carbon\\ Copy\\ Cloner.app\n\n", "Q: How to toggle between \"Portrait\" and \"Landscape Right\" orientation in iOS simulators via AppleScript? How do I toggle between \"Portrait\" and \"Landscape Right\" orientation in the iOS simulators via AppleScript?\n\nA: On my system, using Script Editor, the following example AppleScript code works for me to toggle between Portrait and Landscape Right of the Simulator window:\ntell application \"Simulator\" to activate\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n    tell application process \"Simulator\" to ¬\n        tell menu 1 of ¬\n            menu item \"Orientation\" of ¬\n            menu 1 of ¬\n            menu bar item \"Device\" of ¬\n            menu bar 1\n            if value of ¬\n                attribute \"AXMenuItemMarkChar\" of ¬\n                menu item \"Portrait\" is \"✓\" then\n                click menu item \"Landscape Right\"\n            else if value of ¬\n                attribute \"AXMenuItemMarkChar\" of ¬\n                menu item \"Landscape Right\" is \"✓\" then\n                click menu item \"Portrait\"\n            end if\n        end tell\n\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide. See also, Working with Errors. Additionally, the use of the delay command may be necessary between events where appropriate, e.g. delay 0.5, with the value of the delay set appropriately.\n", "Q: Why does resetting to factory settings not restore 2019 Macbook to Catalina? My Macbook 2019 came with Catalina. I upgraded to Big Sur. When I restore to factory settings, it seems the only option is for me to go back to a fresh install of Big Sur, and not Catalina. Why is I can't reset to the operating system that the macbook came with? After all, it is a \"factory reset,\" and when it came out of the \"factory,\" it had Catalina and not Big Sur.\n\nA: \"Factory reset\" is a slight misnomer. It doesn't really mean to restore everything back to the same state that it had when it came from the factory, because the original contents of the hard disk are not save anywhere when you upgrade the OS or applications. When you installed Big Sur, Catalina was overwritten; whenever you upgrade an application, the previous version is deleted.\nWhat it really means is that all personalizations are removed. Accounts other than the built-in ones (e.g. Administrator) are removed, and system and application preferences in the built-in accounts are set back to their default values. Applications that weren't included with the system will be removed, but applications that were included will be kept in their upgraded versions. I also assume that local Time Machine snapshots are deleted.\nThe purpose is to get a \"clean\" system, usually because you intend to give/sell the computer and don't want them to get your personal data, passwords, applications whose licenses don't permit transfer, etc. It's not intended to go back in time and revert everything you've ever done to the system.\nIn the old days a computer came with external disks containing the operating system and applications, and you could reinstall the system from them to get back to its original state. Now they no longer do this (and recent Mac models don't even have DVD readers, although one could imagine doing it with flash drives), but you can still reinstall from the network to get an earlier OS.\n\nA: The factory installs software (Garage Band, iMovie, Pages, Keynote, Numbers) in an unregistered state and you will never be able to install that license/state following Apple erase install.\nSo no one is really getting factory unless you have some image of it before you booted it the first time (and Apple honors the license claim a second time).\nErase install recovery has options to get you close to several versions of macOS if you didn’t clone the drive -  documented here:\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904\n\nuse Shift-Option-Command-R at startup to install the macOS that came with your Mac, or the closest version still available.\n\nCatalina is still signed so I must conclude your reset procedure is different than the one above. Let me know if I missed anything relevant. Good luck with the next reset - there are many ways to get Catalina installed but the above is the easiest for me and well supported by Apple if needed.\n\nA: Apple has a website that has a link to the App store where the Install macOS Catalina application can be downloaded. You the can use the instructions from this Apple website to create a USB flash drive installer. Boot from the USB installer to erase your drive and install Catalina. If you have a T2 chip, then you will need to read this Apple website for instructions on how to allow external booting.\n", "Q: How To Change Time Machine Password - Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) How may a Solid-state drive (SSD) Time Machine backup password be changed for a SSD formatted as \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)\"?\nExpected\nThis is how a Time Machine backup password is changed for an SSD formatted as \"APFS (Case-sensitive, Encrypted)\".\nAPFS (Case-sensitive, Encrypted)\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility app > Select the drive under the External category.\n\n*Select in the menu bar File > Change Password...\n\nAPFS Volume\n\nObserved\nThe Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) formatted SSD has the option for Change Password... grayed out.\n\nMac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)\n\n\nA: Remove and Re-Enable the Backup Drive from Time Machine With New Password\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Time Machine\n\n\n*Remove current disk: Select Disk... > Under Backup Disks, choose the existing drive > Remove Disk\n\n\n\n*Re-enable disk without the existing password: Select Backup Disk... > Select disk > Deselect Encrypt backups > Use Disk\n\n\n\n*Cancel the disk backup in-progress > Wait for the disk to decrypt\n\n\n*Repeat Step 2.\n\n\n*Re-enable disk with a new password: Select Backup Disk... > Select disk > Select Encrypt backups > Use Disk\n", "Q: Touch ID doesn't work on MacBook Pro 2019 I have troubles with Touch ID on my MacBook Pro 2019 all the time, it just don't recognize my fingers.

Naturally, this requires compiling a PPC binary. I have a Leopard Virtual Machine set up on my Intel Mac, but I don't have access to any actual PPC hardware.\nMacPorts does not offer any C++11 compilers which can cross-compile PPC binaries on Intel, but I'd thought I'd be able to work around this by running the whole of MacPorts under Rosetta. With Rosetta 2, this would be easy—I'd just set the Terminal app to \"Open using Rosetta\", and everything the Terminal runs would also use Rosetta. This was a commonly recommended way to run Homebrew on M1 Macs, before Homebrew finally added native Apple Silicon support a few weeks ago.\nUnfortunately, Rosetta 1 does not appear to be this intelligent. I can set the Terminal app to \"Open using Rosetta,\" but this causes only the literal Terminal app to use Rosetta. Bash, MacPorts, etc are still running as Intel processes, according to Activity Monitor.\nIs there an alternate way to run command line programs—and preferably all of MacPorts—under Rosetta?\n\nA: Provided you're on a system where Rosetta v1 is available (up to and including Mac OS X 10.6), you can direct the system to execute the ppc segment of a universal binary using the arch command.\n/usr/bin/arch -arch ppc /path/to/some/executable\n\nI've found it useful to keep a virtual machine in Parallels Desktop running OS X Server 10.6 with Xcode and other developer tools installed for this scenario, of compiling older software for obsolete PowerPC Mac systems.\n\nA: On Leopard and Snow Leopard, you can and should use the arch command. Unfortunately, this command does not exist on Tiger. (Well, the arch program exists, but all it can do is print your current cpu architecture.)\nInstead, on Tiger you can use the translate binary directly:\n/usr/libexec/oah/translate /path/to/some/executable\n\nNote that you need to include the full path to the executable. If the executable doesn't exist (or you ignored the prior sentence), translate will fail with a very unhelpful segmentation fault.\n", "Q: How to get back iMovie version compatible with macOS 10.14? How can I get an iMovie version compatible with macOS 10.14. I deleted it to clear up space on the hard drive, but I need it now and the App Store only lists a version compatible with 10.15+\nApple Support recommended to reinstall Mojave (or upgrade) which I would like to avoid. What are my other options to get a compatible iMovie version?\n\nA: If you attempt to install iMovie from the “Purchased” tab of the Mac App Store, you will be given the option to install the last compatible version. This must be done from the Purchased tab, and not anywhere else on the Mac App Store, or the dialog will not appear.\n\nA: Do you still remember the exact version of iMovie running on your Mac?

I had installed FileZilla from the App Store, and not directoy from the Filezilla Website.\nI found a few discussions on this topic - also mentioning FileZilla explicitly - on the net, usually in combination with an advertisement for some \"mal cleaner software\" (for example here). Before the upgrade, I had used FileZilla frequently, and did not notice any problem.\nIs this a false alarm by the Gatekeeper, or should I suspect that this app indeed is infected and remove it?\n\nA: I recommend binning the app in this case. Get a new copy or different tool.\nThe FileZilla downloads and updates now contain PUP - potentially unwanted program (or PUS if software makes more sense than program). The line between malware, adware and privacy stealing information is blurred and when a package has these modifications you will sometimes be prompted with a warning. Even when the owner of a tool decides to monetize their tool, Apple is generally flagging that change with a signing error so people know a common tool isn’t what it was in the past.\nThis warning can be as simple as the application is modified and what was signed isn’t what is running anymore.\nMany people have repackaged this app, so be sure you do the work to get a clean copy or perhaps delete it and redownload.

Lately when I use my AirPods while on a phone call, people are telling me it sounds really muffled. I have no problem using my wired headphones or no headphones at all. Is it possible to tell my iPhone to just use the AirPods for audio output, but use my phone as the speaker?\nAlternatively, if someone has any idea how to fix the muffled sound, that would be great. I don't know when it started happening since I can't how I sound on calls, but I don't think it was always like that.\n\nA: No, I would do an A / B test to see if wired headset is higher quality that the Bluetooth one. You could even do that call with Apple Support so they could hear the difference and set up a repair if your bluetooth microphone is wonky.\nDropping AirPods can happen easily and internal damage can be both hidden to you and cause them to lose massive amounts of quality or just sound buzzy.\nBefore you call support, check the mesh openings (all of them) with a magnifying glass and look for signs of cracking.\nP.S. always having wired headset is my conference superpower. Being able to quickly get perfect sound on a call is well worth the expense and hassle for me when sound quality matters.\n\nA: iOS devices switch both audio routes (input and output) to the last connected audio device. So you can‘t adjust the mic to another source than your AirPods, if you are connected with them. With Live Listen you can speak in the iPhone mic and hear the noise in your connected AirPods.

I bought a LG 27UK650-W monitor that has 4K UHD resolution (3840 x 2160). When I connect it to my MacBook Pro (2019, 16-inch, Big Sur), the fonts are huge. I had to switch from \"Default for display\" to \"Scaled\" and move it down a couple of notches. Once I've done that, the System Report under About This Mac shows:\nResolution:  5120 x 2880 (5K/UHD+ - Ultra High Definition Plus)\nUI Looks like:  2560 x 1440 @ 30.00Hz\nFramebuffer depth:  30-Bit Color (ARGB2101010)\n\nIt is listed as LG HDR 4K Display 27-inch (3840 × 2160) under Displays in About This Mac.\nBy comparison, my work laptop has a Dell U2719DC with 2560x1440 pixels and it works perfectly with the default settings (no scaling).\nI tried both a UtechSmart 6 In 1 USB C Hub and a Belkin USB-C to HDMI Adapter (HKQ22ZM) with the same result.\nShouldn't Apple \"just work\"?  I expect to plug in a monitor and have all pixels available and the UI in some sane state in terms of font sizes.  What am I missing?\n\nA: Some things aren't adding up here. You say the monitor is 4K, instead system report indicates some display has a 5K resolution.\n\nHowever, I think you are misinterpreting the numbers. The scaling option still renders at the highest resolution of your monitor, it just enlarges the UI. What you are losing is space on your monitor, because UI elements will appear bigger, in order to be readable.\n\nImagine an app opening by default with a resolution of 1600x900. If your monitor only has this resolution, it will fill the whole screen. If you instead have a 4K screen, that app will only take some small space on the monitor. Now if these monitors were the same size physically, the app will appear much smaller on the 4K screen. Now scaling allows you to change the appearance, to match the app's size from the 1600x900 monitor on the 4K screen and will display the app fullscreen. The app ends up physically being the same size, yet rendered and shown at the high-res of the 4K monitor.\n\nA: I had also issues with setting up MacBook Pro 16\" (2019) and LG 27UL650-W. Did all kinds of tricks from this post.\nBe aware that most USB-C Hubs with HDMI, will send max 30Hz signals. With my USB-C hub, it got 4K at 30Hz max. I tried USB-C to DisplayPort-cable.

When the MBP is open, the external display only works at 4K 30Hz.\nMy hub and HDMI cable are both capable of 60Hz, as shown by the fact that it works when in clamshell mode. Does anyone know if the M1 MBP is capable of driving a 4K display at 60Hz when the laptop is open?\n\nA: Yes, this is officially possible. Your MBP supports full native resolution on the internal display in addition to a single display up to 6K at 60 Hz.\nTo quote Apple's technical specifications:\n\nVideo Support\nSimultaneously supports full native resolution on the\nbuilt-in display in millions of colours and one external display with\nup to 6K resolution at 60Hz\n\nM1 MacBook Pro 13\" - Technical Specifications\nItalics added for emphasis\nAs you can see, the specs specifically say: \"Simultaneously supports\".\n\nA: Just had the same issue with my M1 MBP 14\" and Samsung U28E590D.

I didn't join crowds a few years ago when Apple slowed down the iPhone clock to preserve battery charge, i.e., I didn't change the battery of my iPhone SE. My battery charge life has been satisfactory, since I'm a smartphone minimalist, i.e., relying primarily on the native apps, and banishing them from operation when I'm done (flicking up) [1]. No streaming video, and maybe streamed audio for a few minutes a year. Infrequent browsing, email, and texting, especially this winter with lockdown.\nThis winter, I was out in the wintery cold and the battery charge dropped from 70% to whatever level causes the phone to shut off and not start again. It was a real downer because I really needed the data connection to look up information and I needed the phone to call someone.\nAround the January timeframe, I visited the Apple Geniuses for the first time in my life and asked for the battery to be replaced. Since then, however, I've never seen the battery deplete so quickly. My usage hasn't changed. The only explanation would be if an iOS update at the same time caused more activity. That would be quite the coincidence, for that to happen exactly the one time that I changed the battery over the space of years.\nIs there any way to confirm that the battery actually got replaced?\nNOTES: [1] I found that if I didn't banish the camera or Google Maps, the battery charge depletes quickly.\nSTEPS TAKEN\n\n*\n\n*Tech support performed remote diagnostics, confirming the 100% battery health.  I'm not sure what details are generated by the diagnostics.\n\n\n*They advised upgrading to iOS 14.4, which apparently has charge preserving features for iPhone SE.  I still saw the pronounced charge depletion when the phone is almost always unused.\n\n\n*The next advised step was to refresh the firmware.  Since I didn't want to install something as massive as iTunes on the computer, they said that an Apple store can do this.  The Apple store tried to do so today (2021-03-14), but the procedure requires a factory reset.  I didn't have the time this weekend to re-establish the environment of my iPhone (including accounts and apps), so I decided to install iTunes at a later date and do it myself.\n\n\n*The staff provided helpful advice. While they agreed that banish apps might help if the phone is hardly ever used, I can also remove risk of unwanted CPU usage by closing the browser tabs. I will do this.\n\n\n*Similarly, using low power mode shuts down many background activities that need restarting, and was meant only to extend the last drops of charge. It's not meant for normal usage, so I will disable that (it was inconvenient to have to re-enable it all the time anyway).\n\nA: \nIs there any way to confirm that the battery actually got replaced?\n\nThere are a couple ways you can use to check the battery status/health on your iPhone:\n\n*\n\n*Check for your iPhone's battery's maximum capacity under Battery Health status in the iOS Settings app.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208387\n\nMaximum battery capacity measures the device battery capacity relative to when it was new. A battery will have lower capacity as the battery chemically ages which may result in fewer hours of usage between charges. Depending upon the length of time between when the iPhone was made and when it is activated, your battery capacity may show as slightly less than 100%.\n\n\nA newer/recent battery should show a number close to 100% for the Maximum Capacity value. You can access this information under Settings app → Battery → Battery Health on your iPhone.\n\n\n*Check the battery charge cycle count and charge retention capacity on your iPhone.\nYou can check the battery charge cycle count and charge retention capacity on your iPhone by using a 3rd party app called coconutBattery. A charge cycle count gives an estimation of full charge and discharge cycles endured by your iPhone.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to upload a folder from the Files app into a computer on the local network? Is there a way to upload a folder from the Files app into a computer on the local network? The only solution I have found is to start an SFTP server on the computer, and use the app Secure Shellfish to expose that SFTP directory in the Files app. This solution is, unfortunately, very slow (maxes out at 9 MB/s in a network that can handle 70 MB/s).\nPS: SMB barely even works, and is the slowest option ever.\n\nA: FE File Explorer can do this:\n\nFE File Explorer is a powerful file manager app on your iPhone and iPad. It can access not only local files, but also files on your computer and NAS. Stream movies and music to your iPhone/iPad. Directly view and manage documents, photos, files on your computers and cloud without downloading to your iPhone/iPad.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the remote computer's server (I recommend a WebDAV server)\n\n*Now add the directories from the Files app you need\n\n*You can copy stuff between these \"remotes\" now.

For example, if a dedicated ⌦ Delete key there isn't present, then fn+⌫ Backspace result in ⌦ Delete.\nMy problem is that this behaviour doesn't persist for keyboard shortcuts: when used in conjunction with ⌘ Command or ⌃ Control, fn is ignored. This generates a few inconsistencies.\nFor example, on my 2017 MacBook Pro ⌘ Command+⌫ Backspace will all previous characters in the current line. Given that fn+⌫ Backspace will delete the next character, I would expect ⌘ Command+fn+⌫ Backspace to delete the remaining portion of the line. However, fn gets ignored and this key combination ends up deleting the previous portion of the line.\nHow can I have access to the \"hidden keys\" accessible with fn even when ⌘ Command is pressed?\nEdit: formatting\n\nA: Even with both  Backspace ⌫  & Delete ⌦ keys,  Cmd ⌘  Delete ⌦  does not clear the line forward of the cursor, even though  Cmd ⌘   Backspace ⌫   clears it rearward.\nIt would appear the inconsistency isn't in the  Fn   key itself, but in the OS's usage of  Cmd ⌘  Delete ⌦ .\n Opt ⌥  Delete ⌦  deletes one word forward of the cursor, as does  Fn   Cmd ⌘   Backspace ⌫ .\n\nA: I would argue that there are no 'hidden keys'.

Problem is, if this is the case, I'm not sure how to delete files since I'm unable to mount the drive for write access in Single User mode.\nThe Panic Error\n\n\n*When logging in with Verbose Mode enabled, the output contains:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kernel extensions in backtrace:\n\n*\n\n*com.apple.filesystem.apfs\n\n*com.apple.kec.corecrypto\n\n*com.apple.driver.AppleEffaceableStorage\n\n*com.apple.iokit.IOStorageFamily\n\n\n\n*panic(cpu 0 caller 0xfff...) /AppleInternal/BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/apfs/apfs-1412.141.1/nx/fusion_mt.c:651 Assertion failed: length.\n\n*The are more lines printed with the final ones being:\n\n@kec.pthread 1\n@kec.corecrypto 1.0\n@kec.libm 1\n\n** In Memory Panic Snapshot Succeeded ** Bytes traced 39400 **\nRecorded panic snapshot in corefile at offset 0x7000, compressed to 18557 bytes\n[Attempting system restart...]\n\nSo, what are my options?\n\nA: panic(cpu 0 caller 0xfff...) /AppleInternal/BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/apfs/apfs-1412.141.1/nx/fusion_mt.c:651 Assertion failed: length\n\nYour filesystem is corrupted (probably from continued operation while full). Because there is not yet any third-party tool for repairing APFS volumes, you need to:\n\n*\n\n*Already have, or make, a backup of your essential files. Continue reading below for details.\n\n*Erase the disk and reinstall macOS.\n\nThere is, unfortunately, no other way out of this. APFS is wonderful when it works, and a complete clusterfuck when it does not.\nIf you do not already have all of your essential files backed up, you can attempt to salvage them. In decreasing order of convenience, your options for this are:\n\n*\n\n*Target Disk Mode.\n\n*Low-level imaging of the drive while booted into an external (non-Mac) OS.\n\n*Physically removing the drive from the computer, which requires separating the LCD from the chassis.\n\nTDM is easiest (assuming you have a second Mac available). However, given the problems you had with merely mounting the drive, this may fail in the same way. There's a slight chance that using a newer macOS (i.e., Big Sur) on your lifeboat Mac could possibly work better than trying Catalina, as there's a chance that it contains a newer APFS driver implementation which could handle corruption more gracefully.\nIf you do install Big Sur on your lifeboat and are able to mount the iMac's TDM'd drive, copy your most essential files off of it first, then attempt to repair with Disk Utility. Do not, under any circumstance, attempt to delete or modify anything on the drive. Otherwise you risk corrupting it beyond repair.\n", "Q: Cant seem to file share between cloned drives Im running two macs on my home office setup; a 2010 Macbook Pro and a 2011 Mac Mini. Both have been upgraded in the past with Crucial SSDs and for each I used the Carbon Copy software to clone the drives before installation. I noticed the other night I couldn't Airdrop between my two machines. I figured this must have something to do with the clone and was wondering if there was a workaround to fix this issue?\nIve also noticed issues in the past with apps like iMessage not updating on both machines, only one or the other.\nFor the time being Dropbox does the trick, but having Airdrop operational between the two would be ideal. Any advice or feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Cloning is intended to provide an identical copy of the system. That is great for disaster recovery, but not so good for running on another computer unless you perform some extra steps.  You have two identical software configurations (possibly even with the same computer name) and that causes confusion.\nIf you don't want to start from scratch on one of the Macs, you need to rename and reset one of the Macs.\nAs a start, I would give Macs different names (do this in System Preferences > Sharing). Reboot. Then remove one from iCloud and re-add it. Again, reboot.  That may be all that is needed - you will need to tell us!\nThose two steps should enable iCloud (for iMessage, etc) and local network services (e.g. AirDrop) to recognise them as separate computers.\n", "Q: Is there another place that passwords are saved in for iOS apps vs safari? I log into Wells Fargo's app with Face ID. But when I try to log in via the web, the password I have saved in iOS does not work (an old password, apparently).\nI'm assuming that to log into the app, my password must be saved somewhere and transmitted to Wells Fargo. If I changed my password and iOS no longer has it, shouldn't I be unable to log in to the app even if my Face ID recognizes my face?\n\nA: Your assumption is incorrect - it's not necessary for an app to know nor transmit your password to login to a service.\nUsually authentication for these types of apps work by you logging with a password for the first login. The app is then issued a token, which you can think of as being a very long, single purpose password. For all future logins, the apps does not authenticate with your own password, but instead using that token.\nThis makes it possible for app developers to let you login using FaceID, TouchID and all sorts of other methods specifically without storing your own password on the device. In addition it allows them to give users the benefit that they can track which units are used to login, and to revoke the token (i.e. invalidate it) so that a specific device can no longer login (without further user authentication).\n", "Q: Creating an installer (.pkg file) from the command line I've seen multiple tutorials in how to create an installer to distribute a MacOS application, but they're all very simple examples (just installing an application and placing it in /Applications).\nTo do that, they use :\nsudo pkgbuild --install-location /Applications --component application-path ./Desktop/installer.pkg\n\nMy situation isn't that complex either, but I can't find out how to do it. I want to install an application to /Applications, but I also want my .pkg to place a .dylib in a specific folder.\nI've tried doing this :\nsudo pkgbuild --install-location /Applications --component myApp.app/ --install-location /destination/for/my/dylib --component myLib.dylib ./myInstaller.pkg\n\nbut it says that it doesn't accept my .dylib because it's not a \"valid bundle component\".\nHow can I do this?\n\nA: I found an alternative, while not the most ideal, it does the job for me. It's using packagesbuild commandline that comes with Packages (http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html). It lets you create a .pkg file through the command line, but you need to create a .pkgproj file, which you create with the Packages application.\n", "Q: Is it possible to run os x 10.8 on a modern mac? I would like to get a new computer, but I have a lot of software that I use which is discontinued and requires OS X 10.8.  Is there a way on a modern mac to have a dual-boot situation so that I can have the latest OS, but also have the option to boot into 10.8 without any performance issues?\n\nA: Dual booting is likely out, the older OS won't have the drivers for newer hardware.  What you could do is run the older OS in a virtual machine.  There's VMWare Fusion, Parallels, VirtualBox, and maybe more I'm missing.\nI run virtual machines routinely and don't experience performance issues so long as there is enough RAM.  As I plan to run virtual machines I buy computers with plenty of RAM from the start.  After that the performance is limited like it was installed \"on the metal\".  There's some quirks with virtual machines that may or may not be problematic and they generally have workarounds.  One issue that comes up is the guest OS is effectively behind a NAT internet sharing from the host, if this is a problem then it can be rectified with a USB network adapter.\n", "Q: Apache on localhost doesn't recognize a website unless I include the full path to index.html Using MacOS 11.1 Big Sur, I'm developing static websites (ie just a standalone index.html, plus JavaScript and CSS files) on my localhost, with the files accessible under /Library/Web Server/Documents.\nUnless I include the full path to the website, including the index.html section, the website fails to load:\n\nI can even reproduce this with the standard \"it works\" file:\n\nHow can I get Apache to check for the presence of the index.html file?\n\nA: Check default settings in httpd.conf - likely you deleted the line that tells Apache what the default file name should be. Check DirectoryIndex listing in your conf file - if missing or edited, add it back in and define index.html as (one of) the default directory file(s).\n\nA: As it appears you do not have any idea about what you broke earlier, you might run into other interesting problems later even if you figure out how to fix this.\nI would strongly suggest you reinstall Apache to get back to its original configuration.  As this appears to be a part of the Big Sur installation (and not XCode) you probably need to boot to recovery mode and reinstall Big Sur from there to get the system back in a known state.\nYou may also be able to just restore the Apache folder from your time machine backup.\nIn the future I suggest you develop against something more controllable.  These days a good suggestion is using Docker with a suitable Apache container.  You are also strongly suggested to learn and use version control of your code, so you don't lose anything if you suffer from hardware failure.\n", "Q: Uploading Time Machine backups.backupdb to cloud service? I'd like to store some of my time machine backups on AWS Glacier Deep Archive so I can have an off-site backup in addition to my external hard drive.\nHowever, I know that time machine uses hard links to save on storage space. Is there some way I can upload my time machine backups to Amazon Glacier (or any other cloud service) while still using the same amount of space?\nIdeally, I'd be able to download only part of the time machine backup at a time (e.g. one version when I need it), but if not, some way to create a backup of the entire backups.backupdb would also suffice.\n\nA: You will not be able to backup/copy all or part of your Time Machine (TM) backup to the cloud in a form that would allow recovery from the cloud to recreate a TM 'backup'.\nBut, I have a few suggestions on how to proceed.\nFor an 'archive' (a point-in-time copy which will remain untouched for a long time) you can copy folders from your Mac to a cloud service like an AWS bucket.  The folders you copy could be directly from your active documents, photos, etc. or could be from a chosen TM date.  If you should need to recover files/folders from this archive you would just copy them back to your computer (TM would not be involved).\nIn my view a better way to proceed is to use a cloud backup service which will maintain a daily (or more frequent) backup of your files maintaining versions of files from all times in the past in a storage efficient way - just like TM.\nYou should not expect a cloud backup to provide complete system restoration. Rather to recover documents, photos, etc. in the event of a disaster which might just be mistaken deletion of a single file all the way up to complete loss of your computer system and its external disks.\nI suggest you explore Backblaze and Arq.\nBackblaze is frequently recommended though I have reservations regarding its failure to backup some file metadata.  It provides both a backup application and cloud storage in a single plan.  It is intended to be be simple to use and by default does backups of nearly everything.\nArq (my favourite) is most commonly used as a backup application with whatever storage you choose to use - e.g. AWS, Google, etc.  I use Arq with cloud storage from both OneDrive (part of Microsoft Office subscription) and Backblaze's B2, though is unnecessary to use 2 storage providers.  Arq is similar to Time Machine in that it does scheduled backups and thins old backups to one a day and then to once a week. Compared with Backblaze it requires a little more configuration.\nPlease note that cloud backup does not replace the need for Time Machine (or some other local backup).\n", "Q: Firmware Locked Password I have an 2012 imac with the most current\nUpdate software being High Sierra.

Please Help!!!\n\nA: Firmware passwords are a security measure intended to stop a stolen Mac from being used. Quite correctly, in my view, Apple won't help you unless you have a receipt or some other way of establishing ownership.\nHave a read of this from Topher Kessler which talks about how the firmware protection is implemented and the steps needed to erase the firmware password.\nIf you do find a way to bypass the firmware password, you probably should not publish it here.\n", "Q: Mac doesn't wake up from sleep since latest OS upgrade (Big Sur) Since upgrading the OS - currently on Big Sur 11.2.2 (20D80)\nI experience failure of my Mac to ever wake from sleep.

This is not user error and only Apple can fix this issue because it is a result of programming errors in their firmware and/or software.\nThe best that you can do is collect as much useful diagnostic information as you can and file a bug report. You’ve already collected your sleep-wake failure report, which is essential to provide.\nAn important step to take prior to filing your report is to eliminate potential hardware catalysts. Try cumulatively adding each of the following steps in order and see if the problem persists or goes away after each one:\n\n*\n\n*I notice that you have several external devices attached to your system, including an Apple multiport adapter, an LG display, a Microsoft wireless dongle, and a Transcend external hard drive. Try disconnecting these and any other devices and dongles.\n\n*Try disabling WiFi and Bluetooth.\n\n*Try reproducing both on AC power and on battery power.\n\nThe next few experiments are intended to exercise the multiple internal routing paths for sleep & wake signals:\n\n*\n\n*You are presumably initiating sleep either via lid close or the Apple menu. Try doing it both ways.\n\n*Try setting a sleep timer and a wake timer (System Preferences -> Battery -> Schedule -> Sleep) for one minute away and two minutes away, respectively, and letting the system sleep and wake itself via the timer without you touching it.\n\n*How are you waking the machine? Keyboard press, trackpad click, lid open? Try each one in order. If all still fail, re-enable Bluetooth, pair a Bluetooth keyboard or pointing device, and press a key/button on the Bluetooth device to wake the machine.\n\n\nA: I fixed the problem by doing 2 things.

Is it possible to recover faster based on tmp files or other method?\nThank you.\n\nA: Your password will be in Keychain if you have ever signed in to the web site directly.\nYou're looking for the one that's listed as www.icloud.com(name@email.com) as a Web form password in the iCloud keychain.\nNone of the other items in Keychain that look like passwords are in fact \"the password\", they are all encrypted tokens of some sort & probably indecipherable.\n", "Q: monitor for 2018 mac mini I just got a new, used Mac Mini as a replacement for my 2011 iMac. My plan was to connect my 2 27-inchers via mDP and use the iMac in Target Display mode using HDMI --> Thunderbolt 2. Upon plugging it all in (and subsequent Googling), I think I learned the following:\n\n*\n\n*The output needs to be Thunderbolt in order for Target Display mode to work, so trying to go from the HDMI port on the MacMini is no good.\n\n*Even connecting via TB, I still can't get audio or use the camera with the iMac in Target Display mode\n\nDoes that sound accurate?\nWith that said, I'm now looking into buying a 3rd 2550x1440 (minimum) 27-incher... one with speakers (which neither of my others have). I've been reading up on the latest mDP, HDMI and TB specs and quickly got in over my head. With a limited budget (around $300), I'm probably going to have to settle for less than the latest of each/any of these... most I've been seeing are HDMI 1.4 and DP 1.2.\nI do web dev work... design and front-end development with some (very infrequent) video and/or 3D tinkering.\nWhat advantages, if any, might I see if I were to bump my budget up and find something with newer HDMI and/or DisplayPort versions? What issues might I run into sticking with the lower versions?\nI can say I have no complaints about my current 27-inchers (both with HDMI 1.4 and DP 1.2), but I feel like since I'm making a bit of an investment, it shouldn't be a dinosaur.\n\nA: Target Display Mode has been deprecated for years. It has major limitations and many bugs and will only get worse with time because it’s unsupported. Don’t base your plans around it.\n", "Q: Distribute an app directly to customers: MacOS vs. iOS I have a Developer Program subscription (\"Enrolling as an Individual\", not as an Organization).\nWith MacOS, it's possible to code-sign / notarize an app, and ship the .dmg / .pkg to customers, without using the AppStore. Since the package is code-signed, the installation process is normal, with no \"Unknown developer\" dialog box.\nIs there a similar feature for iOS? Can we distribute apps to iPhone and iPad users without using the AppStore?\n\nA: It is technically possible to distribute apps to iPhones and iPads without going through the App Store.\nHowever, as you indicate that you want to distribute the apps to iPhone/iPads not owned by you or your organization, it narrows the options.\nIf you want to distribute software to internal test users or external beta testers (or similar), you can use Apple's TestFlight. It allows you to distribute your app to both insider and outsiders without limiting what the app can do compared to an App Store distributed app.\nThere is however limits to how widely you can distribute apps via TestFlight:\nEssentially you can have up to 100 users that are internal (i.e. if you enroll as an organization this would be employees or dedicated extern testers). You can distribute apps to those almost without any delay and without going through a length review process.\nYou can also distribute your app to up to 10,000 external users. However those apps must go through a (shortened) review, and this means that there is some delay to the distribution. Often you will need to wait 12-24 hours to get the first version of an app approved. Updates are usually quicker.\nFinally, TestFlight limits the duration these apps can be used. Essentially when an app is approved for external testing, it expires 90 days later. At that point it will not run on a users device. This means that to ensure people can keep using the app without interruptions, you must release an update 4 times a year approximately.\nIf you were enrolled in the App Store program as an Enterprise, you also have the option of distributing apps to your users without going through the App Store. Here you can deploy apps directly from MDM, email, web sites, etc. without going through any review process. However, you can only distribute apps to your own employees (i.e. devices owned by the enterprise). You cannot use this method to distribute apps to customers.\n\nA: In a word no.\nThe only way to distribute iOS apps (without a jailbreak) is via the app store.\nThere are (currently) lawsuits about this but for the time being the only legit way is via the App Store.\nEdit---\nAs commenters pointed out there is Apple's Testflight and Enterprise certificates but both come with significant limitations not present in App Store apps, or in phones that are jailbroken.\n", "Q: Is there a way to skip a brew package when upgrading?

Here are some of the relevant commands.\n# To pin a package:\nbrew pin composer\n\n# To list pinned packages:\nbrew list --pinned\n\n# To see which version a package is pinned to:\nbrew info composer\n\n# To unpin a package:\nbrew unpin composer\n\n", "Q: Custom notification tones for WhatsApp iphone12 I know how to customize the ringtone on WhatsApp, however, when I try and customise the notification tone, the list to select from only includes the default Apple tones - i.e. Aurora to Synth and Bell to Xylophone.  That's very frustrating. The custom ringtones I've made using garage band or uploaded aren't listed as options (which they are on the ringtone list)\n\nA: This isn't possible.

I tried this with the Audio MIDI app (creating 1 aggregate device with the two inputs) of macOS and judging from the input level in system preferences it seems to work. Now I wanted to use this as the audio input in Zoom, however this did not work. It seems that Zoom somehow only took some of those channels effectively discarding one of the two microphones. Hence my question: is there some way to combine two inputs (ideally adjust their levels) and feed that to zoom?\nI have read a couple of similar questions (just without zoom reference) such as here, but they mostly to point to Audio Hijack which looks great, but I find it ridiculously expensive for such a little task.\n\nA: The problem with aggregate devices in macOS is, I think, that the different input microphones will be assigned to different channels. Zoom might pick up only the first channel of the aggregate device rather than mixing all the channels together.\nUsing a virtual audio device and a mixer software, one could mix the different microphones together into one channel of the virtual device and then select the virtual device as microphone in Zoom. Originally, I was thinking of soundflower (brew install soundflower) or vb-cable (brew install vb-cable), maybe in addition to obs (brew install obs) for mixing. But as BlackHole has been mentioned in the comments, let's try this one:\n\nBlackHole is a modern MacOS virtual audio driver that allows applications to pass audio to other applications with zero additional latency.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the homebrew package manager\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\n\n\n*Install the BlackHole virtual audio device\nbrew install blackhole-2ch\n\n\n\n*Install a mixer software that will be used to combine the microphone sources. You can use Apple Logic Pro if you have it, or you can use obs (free). Unfortunately, I didn't manage to get it working with Apple GarageBand, because this couldn't handle both microphones simultaneously. Here, I'm using obs.\nbrew install obs\n\n\n\n*In obs, in the \"sources\" section, add the first microphone as \"Audio Input Capture\".\n\n\n\n\n*Then add the second microphone the same way in obs.\n\n\n*In the obs settings (Cmd+,), under \"Audio\", under \"Advanced\", select the BlackHole audio device as \"Monitoring Device\".\n\n\n\n*In obs, for both microphones, you need to activate \"Audio Monitoring\". This will route the signal to the BlackHole device.\nYou find it in \"Advanced Audio Properties\" for the microphones.\n\n\n\n\n*Finally, in the Zoom settings, select the BlackHole audio device as microphone.\n\nThe volume levels of the two microphones can be mixed in obs. Zoom used this mix as input.\n\nA: Let me supplement fiedl's answer. You actually would need two things:\n(1) Virtual Loopback: Use Blackhole, VB-Cable (Free), or Loopback ($99).\n(2) Mixer: A software that mixes two audio inputs and output to the loopback device. In the above answer OBS does the job for you, but it's pretty complicated. You can instead use a Free app like Ladiocast to achieve this. Loopback can also do mixing very easily,  but it's pretty expensive; actually it's the easiest and most intuitive solution at the expense of some money.\nSo the cheapest (of no cost) and easiest way I've found so far would be combining Blackhole and Ladiocast.\n", "Q: What does the Zsh variable syntax of colon then letter suffix do?

We decided to use the Apple Business Manager and some MDM solution for managing the devices.\n1.Using the Apple Developer Program is the only way to make the application available on the Apple Business Manager account for further distribution, is this correct?\n2.Once the application is distributed, from the Apple Developer Account to the Apple Business Manager, in case there are no updates needed for the application, there is no need to renew the Apple Developer account and pay the fee. Meaning the application will still be available for distribution and using on the Apple Business Manager Account. Is this also correct?\n\nA: Apple Business Manager is the buy side of things (as is Apple School Manager) and you don’t need MDM but it sure enhances your capabilities if you associate one.\nApple Developer is the sell side and you don’t need a MDM to sell into ABM or ASM.\n\n*\n\n*No - there are multiple avenues for distribution. MDM can assist with many and it depends on the MDM and the app entitlements and where and how you upload the app.\n\n*When a developer account expires, you lose control and can’t renew signing certificates. Currently, Apple doesn’t pull these apps, but there’s  no reason they couldn’t in that case from my reading of our contracts in the US.\n\nWith B2B custom store, public store with private SKU pricing and more, you have diverse options here.\nMy recommendation is to keep your developer account always active since Apple does and will likely continue to require that apps adhere to privacy and security changes even if you don’t bump the SDK as new ones arrive yearly.\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store-improvements/\n\n\n*https://www.apple.com/legal/enterprise/apple-business-manager/abm-us.pdf\n", "Q: Is it possible to detect the current power input on a MacBook? To the best of my knowledge, MacBooks will still charge if the power supply attached provides less wattage then the laptop was designed for. Is there a way to view the current power input, preferably a simple terminal command, or would that be impossible/always the same for some reason?\nIf relevant, I have a MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports), but would like a way that works on other models as well.\n\nA: There is a straightforward way to determine instantaneous* battery charging current, assuming you have developer tools installed:\nioreg -rw0 -c AppleSmartBattery | grep -o -e '\"ChargingCurrent\"=[0-9]*'\n\nThe number is specified in milliamps.\nHowever, this is not going to be the same as the current entering through your AC adapter (this is most apparent when the battery is fully charged, in which case the current will be 0), so it may not help you with what you're doing. I'm not aware of a place where that information gets published, although the PMU must certainly measure it.\nSimilarly, you can view the instantaneous* voltage of the battery, in millivolts, with\nioreg -rw0 -c AppleSmartBattery | grep -o -e '\"Voltage\" = [0-9]*'\n\nwhich, when multiplied by the above current, will give you the power being delivered to the battery (in microwatts, so divide by a factor of 1,000,000 to get watts). But, again, it is not the same as the power being delivered by the AC adapter.\nYou can view more power-related parameters with\nioreg -rw0 -c AppleSmartBattery\n\nUpdate:\nI experimented on two systems – a T2-based MBP with Catalina and a non-T2-based MBP with Big Sur – and found that the former has the keys AdapterPower and SystemPower contained in the BatteryData dictionary property of AppleSmartBattery:\n\"BatteryData\" = {\"StateOfCharge\"=98,\"PMUConfigured\"=0,\"DesignCapacity\"=8790,\"QmaxCell1\"=9017,\"AdapterPower\"=1101610469,\"SystemPower\"=1104635067,\"ResScale\"=244,\"QmaxCell2\"=9048,\"QmaxCell0\"=9082,\"CycleCount\"=69,\"Voltage\"=12503}\n\nSo this is a promising source for determining both the power being delivered by the AC adapter as well as the power being consumed by the system. These, along with the earlier battery charge current & voltage that I showed, could give you a pretty complete picture of the power situation.\nI couldn't figure out the units at first, since the numbers are too high to be W, mW, and even µW, and too low to be nW. Then I remembered that some keys are stored as floating point values, and when I converted 1101610469 into an IEEE-754 float, I got the very reasonable-looking 21.1552219391, which means that it's published in units of watts.\nYou can therefore – on at least certain hardware or software – view the AC adapter power consumption with\nioreg -rw0 -c AppleSmartBattery | grep BatteryData | grep -o '\"AdapterPower\"=[0-9]*' | cut -c 16- | xargs -I %  lldb --batch -o \"print/f %\" | grep -o '$0 = [0-9.]*' | cut -c 6-\n\nand system power consumption with\nioreg -rw0 -c AppleSmartBattery | grep BatteryData | grep -o '\"SystemPower\"=[0-9]*' | cut -c 16- | xargs -I %  lldb --batch -o \"print/f %\" | grep -o '$0 = [0-9.]*' | cut -c 6-\n\nThis uses lldb to do the IEEE-754 conversion, so you, again, will need developer tools installed. It is also very straightforward to write a small CLI tool that uses the IOKit framework to dump these out without needing Xcode installed on the target system, if you needed to have that.\n* - Note that these values only seem to update once a minute or so, so they aren't truly instantaneous.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro asks for old iCloud password for Find My Mac I have a Macbook Pro which I have just wiped the disk and reinstalled Catalina on.\nI'm trying to enable Find my Mac, but in system preferences, under iCloud, the 'Find my Mac' checkbox is disabled with the message 'Find my mac is already in use'. Clicking on it asks for the login details for an old employee who left about a year ago ('Enter the password for example@example.com to disable find my mac'). We do not have access to his credentials.\nI've tried resetting the NVRAM which has not worked (NVRAM is reset successfully but the issue persists).\nIt is odd to me that it is asking for these credentials after completely wiping the disk and reinstalling the system, especially a year after the employee left and his machine was handed over to someone else. Is there any way that we can resolve this without access to the account's credentials? We usually require devices to have some sort of 'find my...' enabled as part of our security policy, but we can't enable it without disabling the old one first.\n\nA: Find My Mac sends the Mac's device ID and other information to Apple's servers and links it to the iCloud account which enabled the service. Once registered, only a correct login with that iCloud account's credentials will disable it.  Wiping the disk does not change the serial number and other information which resides on silicon somewhere on the logic board, and not in NVRAM.\nIf you have invoices or bills of sale which prove your company owns the laptop, you can contact Apple Support and they will (eventually) unlock the laptop.\nI work in elementary education, and Apple Education support has a well-honed procedure for disabling iCloud-locked laptops and iPads. Fortunately, all our purchases go through Apple, so they already have a record of our devices, purchase dates, etc.\n", "Q: If my adapter says 1A or 2.1 which port should I use for my iPod nano? If my wall adapter says 1A and 2.1 A.

I always use the standard account and when I need to perform an action that requires the administrator rights I enter my admin credentials into the popup window.\nI got curious, is it possible for a malware that was installed in my standard user scope to gain the admin rights skipping the administrator credentials popup if it already possesses the admin password and username for some reason, in other words, can it enter the administrator password in the background so the user won't notice anything?\nGenerally speaking, is it possible for malware to do bigger harm if it knows the administrator credentials somehow?\nThanks!\n\nA: Yes, specifically, if malware can pop that up, you may already “be toast” so it won’t need to do this since it could just install a key logger and not tip you off.\nIf you want to learn more about keyloggers or other behaviors that are more solid indications of keylogger, try ReiKey by Objective-See is excellent.\nLuLu and KnockKnock are excellent as well as general tools in this (malware and PUP) space:\n\n*\n\n*https://objective-see.com/products/lulu.html\n\n*https://objective-see.com/products/knockknock.html\n\nWhen you are prompted for the password, normally that’s the OS asking for your password and very low chance that your password is about to be compromised. Malware could be about to run, but it’s not likely and not likely about to capture your password. The program asking for the password doesn’t get your password, just temporary admin rights.\nWhat it does with those rights is the worrisome part, malware or not. It could install a key logger or persistent processes - those are worrisome.\nWorst case, some malware could craft a dialog like your password and fool you to escalate privileges, but this is an unlikely possible scenario.\nAnything is possible, especially if you are a high value target. For most people, tricking you or just running something that’s not signed is the risk here - not losing control of a strong and unique admin password.\n\nA: Yes, it is ordinarily fully possible for malware that knows the administrator user's username and password to gain administrator's rights in the background  without displaying the popup.\nIt is difficult to say in general how much harm malware can do with or without knowing credentials. Certainly the malware knowing the administrator user's username and password makes it easier for it to become privileged and thus be able to do much harm. However malware exists that exploit weakness in the operating system's security in order to obtain privileged access without knowing the username and password of the Administrator user. Avoiding that is best done by keeping the operating system up to date, and not downloading programs from unknown/unreliable sources.\n", "Q: After iPhone photo import to Photos app on macOS, how can I tell if all photos successfully imported? Photos app for macOS seems to have known bugs. Examples: here, here, here, here. Some bugs like photos going into 'not responding' mode; photos app continually finding 'new items'; and photos not believing it has imported photos when it had, can be worked around by reattempting the import - by simply force quitting photos and restarting it, then  clicking on 'Import all new items'.\nThe problem is, after importing said new items, the 'Import all new items' turns blue and clickable again. So photos app never seems satisfied that it has received all the imported items.\nI will be deleting the drive of the device from which photos are being imported, so it is absolutely essential to be certain that all files have indeed been imported.\nQuestion\nHow can I know with certainty that all the photos on a device have been imported successfully to photos on macOS?\n\nA: Sidestep the issue - use Image Capture.\nIf you plug in any phone or SD card etc it will display the contents.\nI set mine to delete on import. Import can be to a folder, or to Photos etc.\nYou can watch the list of photos go down as they are imported.\n\n\nA: This isn't a complete answer, but I leave this information here because unreliable photo imports are a horrible problem to have, since they could result in data loss.\nHere's what I did:\n\n*\n\n*Click on 'Import All New Items' in Photos app\n\n*Once that process \"completes\" (it may not be complete), go back into your device using the pane on the left side of photos. You may see 'Import All New Items' is blue and clickable again, despite you already having clicked that\n\nHere's what I did to solve:\n\n*\n\n*Open finder, go to Pictures, then right click on Photos Library.photoslibrary (or whatever your Photos library is called), then select 'Show Package Contents'\n\n*the originals folder will contain the images/videos from your phone, unfortunately, it may be split into many smaller folders named 0, 1, 2, 3, .., 9, A, B etc.\n\n*right click on the bar in finder that says 'Name', 'Date Modified', 'Size' etc, and select 'Date Added'.\n\n*Now you have a way to know for sure whether a file was added or not (i.e. by ordering by Date Added, and visually checking if it was imported)\n\n*Go back into Photos, click on your device, under the 'New Items' section, select some files, click Import, then go back into finder and make sure they appeared (order by Date Added should make this fairly easy)\n\nThat's what I did. Very painful, but better than either i) losing some important photos/videos, or ii) checking 25,000 photos/videos manually, which would have been completely infeasible.\n\nA: A year later I face exactly the same problem - I can't tell if all my iPhone photos imported successfully on to my MacBook Pro.\nI could see that the number of of photos in 'Recent' Album on iPhone was about 55 photos more than the number imported on Photos App on Macbook. So 55 were missing!\nSolution: on iPhone, go to 'For you', scroll to the bottom, and look for 'Shared with You'. Tap 'See all', scroll to the bottom and it will tell you how many photos are there. For me, there were 55, the exact number missing from the import. So I deemed those photos the ones missing (I could be wrong, and it could just be a coincidence that there were 55 missing from the import and 55 shared with me, but I think that's the reason).\n\nA: You need to plug-in SD card so that it displays contents.

I tried to format it but it didn't work (I think)(I used disk utility and erased Macintosh HD) as it still shows the activation screen and my email address linked to it. How do I unlink it from my account?\nI tried using iCloud but I see the following screen which is my old email address and it won't let me type in my new email address.\n\n\nA: First things first, the reason your MacBook Pro is still linked to your Apple ID is because you need to sign out of iCloud on that device. Reformatting the hard drive is not enough.\nThe What to do before you sell, give away, or trade in your Mac page on Apple's website provides a good summary of what users should do.\nAs for the screen in your screenshot, it's not letting you change the \"email address\" because it's actually prompting you to enter the password for the Apple ID (in this case, the Apple ID being the same as your old email address). The fact that it's an old email address is irrelevant, as it's still an Apple ID attached to you.\nAll you need to do is enter the password for that Apple ID to access iCloud etc.\nIf the Apple ID you used with that MacBook Pro was in fact another Apple ID, then you'll need to log into that iCloud account instead.\nNOTE: Assuming your MacBook Pro has a fresh installation of macOS, you could just go into System Preferences to log out of iCloud etc. and that should disassociate that Mac from your Apple ID.\n", "Q: Fast way to select and delete all photos on an iPhone? One way to delete all photos from an iPhone is to go to the bottom photos in an album, tap 'Select' in the top right of screen, press the bottom right photo and without lifting your finger, move your finger to the top left of screen, where it will continue to scroll up while selecting photos.\nThe problem is, this selects photos at a rate of about 200 photos per 10 seconds. I have 25,000 photos, so I will need to sit there holding my finger in exactly the right place for 20 minutes.\nHow can I delete all photos from an iPhone album quickly and efficiently? (i.e. immediately)\n\nA: *\n\n*Click 'Select'\n\n*Move your finger from the bottom-right most photo and move your photo up to the top left of screen (so the screen starts scrolling up and selecting photos)\n\n*Here's the important step, with your other hand, tap the top left of screen (above where your finger on your other hand is).

Attempts to restore them results in blank files going back into Photos, with no way of distinguishing the bursts from the regular photos.\n\nA: If you can't solve this yourself, please open a support case with Apple so they can assist in the deletion and possibly discover / fix the underlying issue.\nFor my DIY how to solve this without support process:\n\n*\n\n*Recover everything from 'Recently Deleted'\n\n*Go into your Photos, and scroll down to 'Bursts'\n\n*Follow these instructions, noting it will be a little more difficult for you since you may be looking at completely blank images rather than actual images (but it will work even for completely blank images, I can confirm this).\n\nThe steps to delete an individual burst from Photos are\n\n*\n\n*Go into Photos\n\n*Scroll down to 'Bursts'\n\n*Select a burst, and press 'Select...'\n\n*Click in the center of the screen to pick any photo as the 'Favorite' (it doesn't matter which one since they'll all be deleted in a moment)\n\n*Tap 'Done'\n\n*Tap 'Keep Only 1 Favorite'\n\n*Tap 'Select'\n\n*Tap the 1 Favorate photo you chose in Step 6\n\n*Tap the trash can to delete it - it's gone!\n\nRepeat the above steps once for every burst you want to delete.\n", "Q: Screen Time blocks Google websites because YouTube is restricted I'm using Screen Time's feature to block a website:\nSystem Preferences -> Screen Time -> Content & Privacy -> Limit Adult Websites -> Customise... -> Restricted -> https://youtube.com/\n\nFunny thing is, when I try to visit google.com or any of its subdomains (drive.google.com, calendar.google.com), I get this:\n\nI looked at the Network tab, but there I only see requests to the google.com domain, but no requests to youtube.com. And what's even funnier is that when I visit youtube.com by entering it in the address bar of the browser, it loads without any problems. Do you have any idea why Screen Time behaves like this and how to fix it?\n\nA: Your problem is that Google, as part of its single sign-on (SSO) process, also logs you into YouTube. For most of the Google applications, it can set cookies that are valid on *.google.com, but for YouTube, it redirects you to https://accounts.youtube.com/accounts/SetSID with a sign-on token; you can see this URL briefly flash up when you log in.\nIt's this redirect that's tripping up your filter. As described in other answers, you can restrict your filter to www.youtube.com, or you might be able to explicitly whitelist accounts.youtube.com.\n\nA: Yes. The idea is to show you how a site embeds another so screen time appears to be working as intended.\nFix this by white listing the sites Google embeds in the sites you need to ask them to change how they construct their web sites. Or choose a different search provider. (Or don’t use Google sites in general).\n\nThis is highly confusing in practice since when the OS uses a search provider, you don’t always see the network requests. Try changing your search provider to duck duck go and disabling web previews in your browser app / system settings to get an easier set of variables to juggle while you sort out which places you want to block is how I pick these issues apart (in general).\nThe above picture is how I set up Safari for easier triage of blocked sites. You may need other settings if you use third party browsers or to understand if they respect the Safari settings.\n\nA: Your filter is probably too broad: https://youtube.com blocks https://<anythinghere>.YouTube.com.\nTry changing your Screen Time filter to specifically block https://www.youtube.com if your intention is to limit access to YouTube videos. IIRC there is an API or Analytics site that is visited to get some resources, etc.\nI've just tried this and didn't receive any blocks from Screen Time.\nThis article also specifically adds www.youtube.com .\nAlternatively, set the Time Limit for YouTube to 1 minute; this prevents the problem occurring and probably achieves your intention - stop watching YouTube videos.\n", "Q: How do I update macOS App Store apps to the latest compatible version?

I heard that the Thunderbolt 2 which is on my Macbook can be used to charge the Mac by using a USB-C to Thunderbolt connector. Is this true?\nHow can I charge my MBP?\n\nA: Thunderbolt 2 can not be used to charge your MacBook.\nUnfortunately, the only way to charge the model you have is MagSafe – you have to replace the charging board if you want to keep using it.\n\nA: The 2011 MacBook Pro has a peak AC adapter power draw of 60W. It is also Apple’s first laptop to include Thunderbolt, which had only recently been introduced, so it is actually a Thunderbolt 1 port, not 2. The Thunderbolt 1.0 specification allowed for only 10W of power delivery, which is so low that it wouldn’t have allowed the user to run their laptop without draining the battery. And in case you were also considering a USB solution, the maximum power that was capable of being delivered over USB at the time was 25W, according to the USB-BC 1.2 specification (see tables 5-1 and 5-2 for Vchg and Icdp, respectively).\nImplementing either a Thunderbolt power delivery circuit or USB-BC requires additional hardware components, software development, and R&D time. Apple, like all large manufacturers, makes tremendous efforts to reduce the BOM (Bill Of Materials) for every product that they make, as even a $0.10 cost reduction by omitting a single component turns into many millions of dollars the company gains over the production lifetime of the product. Reducing hardware and software complexity also reduces both the engineering time and the risk of late-stage development or field failures, allowing Apple to release a product on time and with higher quality.\nIt is incredibly unlikely that Apple would have gone through the expense and effort of adding an auxiliary power circuit to the MacBook Pro when it could only supply less than half the power that the machine needs and there’s already a perfectly good MagSafe port. So, no, unfortunately: You will need to repair your MagSafe board.\n", "Q: Find all my backed up photos on Time Machine drives I have several time machine backups.

I have a 2020 Macbook Pro (with the M1 chip). I also recently got an ASUS ProArt display which has an HDMI port, Display Port and some USB ports.\nI wanted to see if it's possible to connect the external monitor as a second screen, while also charging my Macbook using the same wire.\nI understand that I need a hub of some sort and a wire that can handle both tasks.\nWhat are the specifications for hardware that would allow me to connect one cable to my M1 Mac and have power and a display share a cable?\n\nA: In general the cleanest solution to achieve this is usually a USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 monitor. These connectors not only have capacity for the video signal, but also feature power and USB passthrough to the MacBook.\nIf you don't have a USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 capable monitor, you would need to get a separate USB-C Hub or docking station. They usually not only feature a video output (usually HDMI), but also USB and SD card slots, sometimes even Ethernet. Yet, be careful: although USB-C is fast (5Gb/s) it is limited, i.e. if you connect 3 external SSDs, a 4K monitor and want 1Gb/s Ethernet, that's obviously not going to work.\n\nYou mention you have an ASUS Pro Art display. Without knowing the exact model, on ASUS website they are all featured as either USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 capable, so you should actually be able to only plug one Thunderbolt 3/USB-C cable into your M1 Mac and be ready to go. Some of them even feature a USB-Hub, which means there are some old-style USB-A ports on the monitor which will also be passed through via the USB-C/Thunderbolt connector to your MacBook. Even further some allow daisy chaining, so you can connect another Thunderbolt device to the monitor and use that as well.\n\nRead more about the difference between Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C.\n\nA: Any hardware that supports USB-4 or Thunderbolt 3 will work. In general, you can have some devices that draw more power than your hardware, but the M1 Air and Pro draw so little power, I don’t think anyone has shipped a display or dock or hub that won’t fully power the 2020 M1 hardware lineup.\nThe Intel Macs that use Thunderbolt 3 can draw more power than a lot of docks/displays provide, so they work as long as the internal battery can make up the difference between whatever power the dock provides and the shortfall based on current power budget. If the Mac idles, the dock should keep it running 24x7 even if the hub is 60 W or lower since most Macs idle less than that.\nAs for vendors - I have had excellent results with:\n\n*\n\n*CalDigit\n\n*Sonnettech\n\n*OWC\n\n*Belkin\n\n*Elgato\n\n*Dell (be sure you check video capabilities, many only run 30 Hz)\n\nI have had very bad results with other vendors I’m not going to name at present so be sure you understand what your warranty and return policies if you buy any brand, especially one not listed above. Some people are fine with inexpensive docks or low refresh rates, others want to launch those accessories into orbit when they realize they could have had 4k + 60 Hz and years of use from a dock had they shopped around a bit and not bought the cheap one.\n\nA: Some kind of dock is likely what you are looking for.  I'll offer an example of such a product to give an idea on what kinds of products are available.\nhttps://eshop.macsales.com/shop/owc-usb-c-travel-dock-e\nThere's all kinds of similar products out there like the example I gave, don't take it as an endorsement but only as an example.  Consider what ports you need on your dock, consider your budget, consider any future growth (4K screen, dual screen, Thunderbolt support, etc.), and look for something that fits your needs.

I have an old MacBook laying around, and I wonder if it's possible to use it safely when the lid is closed? I want to run it as a network device, store files in my home network on it etc.\nIs there a way to use it just plugged in to power and ethernet, close\nthe lid and let it run as a server?\n\nA: The macbook is designed to dissipate a substantial portion of its heat through the keyboard. If you run it closed for a long period of time, it will have reduced performance (as it can't dissipate heat as effectively). Additionally, the added heat could reduce the lifespan of the screen.\nNone of these effects should be too large, and it will work fine closed, but if you can leave the lid open it will be better for the computer's performance and longevity.\n\nA: Use Amphetamine\nNo need to get another monitor, or to buy an HDMI connector or to execute some terminal command. You just need to download this free and open source utility called Amphetamine.\nWhen you run it, it will appear in your menu bar, you can go ahead and click on the logo. And from now, two clicks are enough to finish this :\nClick the \"Indefinitely\" button.\n\nUncheck the middle option saying \"Allow system sleep when display is closed\"\n\nAnd there you go, if you now close your lid, your Mac won't go to sleep. Additionally, if you want to save power and preserve your Mac, you can set the luminosity to the minimum amount (which should make a black screen).\n\nA: Closing the lid on a MacBook while it is running is common, people do that all the time with a keyboard, mouse, and display attached.  Without a display attached it will go to sleep.  A headless monitor adapter is one way to rectify that.  Here's an HDMI example:\nhttps://eshop.macsales.com/item/NewerTech/ADP4KHEAD/\nThis is apparently a popular item as I've seen what appears to be the same product sold under different brands by different shops.  A common use is to allow VNC/RDP/telework software without need for a monitor, which is not far from what you want.  You'll be able to use the macOS screen sharing service to control it over a network for configuration and monitoring.\nThese HDMI headless adapters are common, if you don't have a HDMI port on your laptop then you will need an adapter or have to seek out a DVI, mini-DP, or whatever version.  I did some looking and I haven't found one yet.\n\nA: I do exactly this with my old MacBook Air and have done for some time. The only difference from the above posts is that instead of using macOS I wiped it clean and installed Ubuntu Server (it's still possible to reinstall macOS should I ever want to).\nThere are a few things you need to consider. One is that the wi-fi almost certainly won't work out of the box on Linux as it's Broadcom and depends on a proprietary driver that has to be manually installed. In my case I use a wired USB ethernet adapter which is a better fit for a server use case anyway.\nTo fix the lid closing issue on Ubuntu you have to edit the file /etc/systemd/logind.conf and uncomment the line #HandleLidSwitch=ignore (remove the # symbol at the start).\nThe other problem you'll encounter is the screen being on, which on older models means the Apple logo staying permanently lit. I would imagine this isn't good for it. On my machine I fixed this by adding a line to my crontab that automatically turns it off when the laptop boots:\nDo sudo crontab -e then insert something like the line below:\n@reboot echo 0 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\nThis may be specific to my MacBook Air but the setting looks like it probably applies to most or all Intel-based MacBooks.\nFinally, I recommend controlling the machine via SSH, there is plenty about this if you are not familiar. The OpenSSH server should be enabled by default when you install Ubuntu Server iirc.\n\nA: Try to use the Jiggler\nIt prevents sleep by jiggling the mouse a pixel at a time after the idle threshold is reached. This bypasses any power configuration set in Mac OS.\nI've tested it with a Macbook Pro using the lid closed, with only power and ethernet attached.\nPS: This tool is also helpful if you access a remote application (e.g. remote desktop) that times out. You can simply leave the mouse over the application window and let it jiggle and keep the session alive.\n\nA: To use a MacBook as a server with the lid closed, all you need to do is to ensure that it's powered on and not in sleep state.\nClosing the lid of a MacBook by default puts it into sleep mode irrespective of whether it is plugged into power or running on battery.\nOne common way to keep the MacBook powered on with the lid closed is to connect an external display (and keeping it plugged-in to power, to make sure that it doesn't run out of power) to your MacBook.\nIf that is not feasible, or is not an option that you are looking for, you can refer to the solution in the linked discussion:\n\n*\n\n*https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/361398/279727\n\nYou can accomplish this in  terminal.

This:\ncp ./hb_(lys|gln|thr|glu|ace|nhe)*_aacH*.ptraj ./\n\nWorks just as intended when executed in the terminal. However, putting the same line in an executable script does not work as I receive a\nsyntax error near unexpected token `('\\\n\nI tried escaping \\, does not solve the problem. For bash there seems to be some thing you need to do with extglobthough I can't find any similar suggestions for zsh.\nAny help appreciated.\n\nA: This has nothing to do with shell options. Rather, it depends on what shebang you have in your executable file.\nWhen you run a script as an executable (instead of source-ing it or running it as a function), it runs in a separate sub-shell and not in your top-level shell. A sub-shell inherits its parent's environment (that is, exported parameters), but not any shell options. Instead, the shebang dictates which shell it runs in and with which options.\nIf the shebang is #!/bin/zsh, it will start a Zsh sub-shell with default options, then read commands from /etc/zshenv and $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv, and then from your script.\nLikewise, if the shebang is #!/bin/bash, your script will actually run in Bash, and not in Zsh.\nFinally, if the shebang is #!/bin/sh, it depends on your OS. On macOS, there is a symlink /private/var/select/sh that points to the shell executable to use when the shebang is #!/bin/sh. (Type man 1 sh for more info.) By default, that shell is Bash, and not Zsh, even if you have changed your login shell to Zsh. The only way to change it is to change that symlink.\nBut even if you make /private/var/select/sh point to the Zsh executable, if you run your script with a #!/bin/sh shebang, Zsh will not run in \"native mode\". Instead, it will run in sh emulation mode, which toggles a number of options that are significantly different from the Zsh defaults.\nParentheses are basic glob syntax in Zsh. However, they are not in Bash. So, my guess is, your script is actually running in Bash, because of the shebang.\n\nSo, anyway, long story short: Save yourself the trouble and don't run your script as an executable. Rather, what is usually the most convenient in Zsh, is to add your script's parent dir to your $fpath and then autoload your script as a function.\n", "Q: Can I run old versions of (now incompatible) apps on MacBook Air? A bunch of apps require an M1 chip when you try to download from the App Store.\nSpecifically, I'm asking about Classplus. https://apps.apple.com/in/app/classplus/id1324522260\n I'm pretty sure it's not an iOS app that's using the M1 chip; its first update was on 3 June 2020. My MacOS version is Big Sur 11.2\nIs there a way to download an older version that doesn't require the M1 chip?\n\nA: Apple currently recommends that developers make Universal Binaries for BOTH CPU types. Are you sure that apps only support the M1 CPU and don't work on Intel? Can you give us some examples?\nThey may be advertising that they will work natively on M1, but I would still expect all Mac App Store apps to support Intel CPUs.\nEDIT: The app is an iOS app, which previously would only run on iPads or iPhones. The new M1 Macs can also run these apps. It's unlikely that there was ever an Intel version of this app (as there are no Intel i-devices).\n\nA: The app you linked is in fact an iOS app, and as such requires an M1 chip. Its most recent update was March 2021.\n\nA: \nIs there a way to download an older version that doesn't require the M1 chip?\n\nThis assumes an older version exists and the developer hasn't crippled it in some way.  Someone might have an old x86-64 version of the installer somewhere but it might require a serial number, need to \"phone home\" for activation, or something to make it work.  If the developer revokes permission for the app to run then getting it to run will not be easy.\nAs other answers point out Apple will certainly do what they can to assure people with Intel based Macs can run anything in the App Store for years to come but it's up to the developer to want to create an Intel compatible app and make it available.\nIt's possible that someone, at some point, will make an M1 Mac emulator for Intel Macs to allow the running of newer apps on older Macs.  The M1 is based off ARM and there are 64 bit ARM emulators available now, with QEMU as one example, that could be updated and expanded to run macOS for M1 on macOS for Intel.  I believe this to be nearly inevitable, just not likely to happen tomorrow.\n", "Q: Why is \"Find My Mac\" still complaining about \"Wake for network access\" being inactive, although I just activated it?

Is there any way rEFInd can be configured to be used without the return key.\n\nA: You can try using one of the following:\n\n*\n\n*rEFInd does have the ability to work will a mouse. If this does not work automatically, then you may have to edit the refind.conf file. This file can be found in the EFI/BOOT folder of the EFI volume labeled ElTorito on the USB.\n\n*By default, you can make your selection by pressing a number key. So for example, if the first row on the displayed rEFInd menu has three icons, the you can make a selection by pressing either the 1, 2 or 3 key. In fact, you can do this before the menu is even displayed.\n\n*The return key has the ASCII code of 13, which is a control M. So you can substitute pressing the control+M key combination for pressing the return key.\n\n", "Q: Why is Face ID on used iPhone X and XS often not working? I have seen plenty of used iPhone X and XS that say the phone works fine except Face ID. This made me quite curious as to why most iPhone X or XS have their face corrupted? Apparently it's a depth camera — are depth cameras more susceptible to faults?\n\nA: The simplest explanation is that they've had their screens broken and the replacements weren't done by Apple themselves.\nThe FaceID [and TouchID] secure enclave chips cannot be replaced by anyone other than Apple.

I have a lot of custom settings on my development Mac and every time there is an OS upgrade I have to go back and reset everything.\nI read somewhere that the old config is saved in httpd.conf~previous, but that file doesn't contain my changes either.

Should I install a second copy of apache with brew? and if I do that, is it reasonably possible to disable the built-in MAMP?\nAll solutions are greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Yes, this is a general PITA. Why Apple feels it needs to blow away your httpd.conf settings (not to mention any others) is beyond me. Especially since they stopped supporting Apache \"out of the box\".\nThe good news is they don't actually \"blow them away\" and there is an EASY way to see what files are changed on update AND GET THEM BACK:\n/Users/Shared/Relocated Items/[All your files Apple deems worthy of fight you over] <= It retains the Native structure, so you can immediately spot what you need to change.

The level of \"All Drafts\" shows the badge for the total number of drafts inside it across all accounts, but the message window is blank when \"All Drafts\" is selected. Instead, I now have to click the triangle and go down to the level of the specific account's draft folder itself to see or access any of my drafts.\nWhat has changed? How do I go back to previous situation of being able to access any server-stored draft from any account under the \"All Drafts\" favorite folder?

I am calling a script from a script and passing a positional argument {folder} — whose value is a path that contains spaces so it needs to be quoted.\nThe second script is:\n#!/bin/bash -xu\nfind \"$1\" -type f -iname \"*.srt\" | grep -v -e \"\\\\.eng\" -e \"].srt\" -e \"].[0-9].srt\" | while read -r file; do trash -F \"$file\";done;\n\nI have been unsuccessful in adding quotes around the path variable $1.

Those two echo lines are working. There is output in those txt files. But the Find command never runs when called. I can run the same Find commands in terminal when I quote the path but argument apparently doesn't get quoted because at the first space in the path value the path is clipped.\nI should add that the first script is being called by an application, not in Terminal. So the only way to see the results is to output to a text file... I think.\n\n\n\n*Your post-process script is just deleting *.srt files, so that'd be a rather straight-forward -exec use case. You'll want to refactor that\ninto it's own standalone script and then have filebot call it via\n-exec on the destination folder as explained above.\n\nHere's what the call stack would look like:\n1. qBT calls your qBT_e-program.sh\n1.1. qBT_e-program.sh calls filebot\n1.1.1. filebot -exec calls your delete-srt-files.sh passing along the destination {folder} as Argument $1\n1.1.1.1. delete-srt-files.sh calls find \"$1\" ...```\n\n\n\nAdding more to help troubleshoot. Still stuck on this. I learned how to get some output and have some clues but can't figure the issue out.\nAgain, When I add the path into the script instead of using the quoted variable \"$1\", the script works. When I use the variable it fails and results in this error output. This is being called from the initial script with quoted argument \"{folder}\". I have tried variations on treating the variable: \"{$1}\" \\\"\"$1\"\\\" \"$1/\" -$1.

Fortunately, there is a much more efficient tool.\nYou can use a CLI utility called GraphicsMagick. It's a much more efficient alternative (smaller and faster) to the popular ImageMagick.

I'm doing some heavy copying of files, and wish to do it via the fastest USB-C connection possible.\nI tried holding option and clicking on the apple logo on the very top left, then going to System Information. From here on I'm guessing. I looked under 'Hardware' and see two areas of interest: 'Thunderbolt/USB4', and 'USB'. Does this automatically imply that one or more USB-C ports are faster than others?\nQuestion\nHow exactly can I tell if one (or more) USB-C ports on a MacBook Pro offers faster speeds, and how can I easily know which that is?\n\nA: Apple Menu, \"About this Mac\", \"System Report\", \"Hardware\", \"USB\" and you get a list of all USB devices connected with their speeds. If a device is not connected directly but through a hub, that will cause a little bit of time. If multiple devices are connected to the same hub, they will have to share the bandwidth - they will slow down if they are used simultaneously.\nAnd one trap that might be misleading you: If a hub has only slow devices connected, then it will often report that it has the slow speed itself. So a USB 3 hub with only USB 2 devices plugged in may report that it is a USB 2 hub itself; plug in a USB 3 device and it changes to a USB 3 hub.\n\nA: Apart from the technical specifications which are the same for all ports on the M1 device you own (because USB-4 currently is M1 only on Apple), you could try Blackmagic Disk Speed test to test the actual speeds.\nAs Mr R mentioned in the comments the ports on this device usually allow for much greater transfer speeds than what your media will support. HDDs usually write/read at about 200 MB/s and depending on the SSD model you can reach GB speeds. Modern M.2 NVMe SSDs can actually exceed the 5GB/s speeds port limit, yet at that point you don't only need a very capable SSD and enclosure, but also your M1 Mac needs to handle these speeds. E.g. the internal M1 SSD maxes out at roughly 3GB/s.\n\nA: I assume you have a 2020 model year MacBook Pro with the M1 chip. Your Mac has two USB C ports. Both support USB4, which according to Apple can achieve speeds up to 40 Gb/s. AFAIK there are no USB4 drives yet available for purchase. Thunderbolt 3 drives will work with your Mac and also operate as speeds up to 40 Gb/s, but Thunderbolt 3 drives are not compatible with USB 3.2 or previous versions of USB. There exists USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 drives, which operate at speeds up to 20 Gb/s. However, Apple specifications for your Mac do not mention USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 support. Apple's specifications for your Mac does show support for USB 3.1 Gen 2 (up to 10 Gb/s). This is also known as USB 3.2 Gen 2x1. An example of a USB 3.2 Gen 2x1 drive would be the Samsung T7 Portable SSD. This drive is backward compatible all the way to USB 1.1 and comes with USB type C and A cables.\nUser X_841 posted in a comment to another answer that the \"M1 SSD ... won't be faster than 3GB/s.\" If this is true, then you might consider a Thunderbolt 3 drive such as the Samsung X5, which has a read/write speeds of 2.8/2.3 GB/s and supports TRIM. Thunderbolt 3 is compatible with the newest Macs and many newer PC's. Be aware that you can not connect a Samsung X5 to an older Mac with Thunderbolt 1 or 2 though Apple's Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter. The reason is that the drive is not self powered and the adapter can not provide power.\n\nA: So both ports provide the same speed.\nI’m using a WD P50 external drive USB c 3.2 Gen 2x2 which is theoretically at 2000 Mbps.\nI’m seeing those speeds in the initial burst of Black Magic Disk Test.\nIn real world, I’m getting 1000 Mbps with this drive sustained write of 100Gb.\nThere are 3 possible speed bottlenecks in this scenario:\n\n*\n\n*USB port\n\n*NVMe controller in enclosure\n\n*Drive speed\n(Cable can also affect this)\n\nThere is deliberate vaguely from Apple about the USB 4 implementations on this board because the USB 4 standard does not make it mandatory to support USB-C 3.2 Gen 2x2.\nThe fact I’m seeing a burst in Black Magic suggests the drive is trying to push 20 Gbps thru but that the port is only letting 10 thru.\nGen 2x2 is only allowing 10 Gbps, TB3 external NVMe enclosure is getting 2.3 Gbps sustained 100GB writes with Sabrent gold 1TB NVMe.\n", "Q: How to install Linux compatible apropos When I try to get information about apropos, I get the following:\n$ which apropos\n/usr/bin/apropos\n\n$ apropos --version\napropos from man-1.6g\n\nI tried apropos -r '^report but I get an error:\n$ apropos -r '^report'\napropos: -r: unknown option\n\nThe man page about apropos is very simple:\napropos(1)                                                                                       apropos(1)\n\n\n\nNAME\n       apropos - search the whatis database for strings\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       apropos keyword ...\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       apropos  searches  a set of database files containing short descriptions of system commands for key-\n       words and displays the result on the standard output.\n...\n\nThe above command works on Ubuntu/Linux.\nI am not sure if it is because of the macOS apropos BSD?\nIs there any way I can install Linux compatible apropos?\nOn Ubuntu/Multipass, I get the following.

When I connect to the public IP address of my Mac, the return packets are being routed over the VPN. I need to force these packets to be routed over the public interface.\nThis question has been answered for Linux here: https://serverfault.com/questions/659955/allowing-ssh-on-a-server-with-an-active-openvpn-client/918441#918441. Unfortunately the solutions provided do not apply for macOS Big Sur as ip is not available.\nI am using the official PIA VPN client in WireGuard mode.\nHow can I connect to my Mac via SSH while it is connected to the VPN?\n\nA: If this works when the VPN software is disconnected, then you now have a case to make a configuration change on the VPN server to allow split tunneling.\nBy default, many VPN servers demand and check that all traffic to the Mac (or PC or Android or iOS or unix client) connect only through the VPN. This causes intentional breakage of ssh since its can no longer listen for an incoming connection from your local subnetwork.\nSigning in to a single tunnel VPN intentionally breaks the interface since it exists on the other end of the network tunnel which is a different network range. This is a security issue as most companies consider VPN a firewall to prevent any communications as you have described. This is working as intended for many VPN setups and what you ask may break or be contrary to security setup decision.\nOptions to change this include:\n\n*\n\n*Try to establish your ssh session before VPN tunnels engage.\n\n*Change the nature of your VPN tunneling configuration to allow split tunneling.\n\n*Use a network to network VPN tunnel instead of a client to network tunnel.\n\nIt’s a good idea to review your security policy if someone else imposes VPN since this could be outside their design parameters or violate security policy if split tunneling is intentionally disabled.\n\nA: I have been unable to find a software solution. I solved the issue opening a port on my router to my NAS. There I run a SSH tunnel to my Mac. Now I can run a VPN client on my Mac while connecting to it from outside via SSH.\n", "Q: Unable to mount read-write in Big Sur 11.2.2 in Single User Mode I'm on Big Sur 11.2.2, Single User Mode.

I used a package installer (1Password-7.8.pkg) with a valid signature and removed the signature completely, essentially I did the following:\n\n*\n\n*pkgutil --expand 1Password-7.8.pkg Unsigned.unpkg\n\n*pkgutil --flatten Unsigned.unpkg Unsigned.pkg\n\n*pkgutil --check-signature Unsigned.pkg\nThe output of the 3 step is:\nPackage \"Unsigned.pkg\":\n   Status: no signature\n\nThen I double-clicked on the Unsigned.pkg and was able to do the installation without any warning or blocking from the Gatekeeper.\nThat experiment proves that Gatekeeper doesn't verify the code signature of a package installer (.pkg extension) automatically, am I right?\nIf the assumption above is current, it leads to the second question. How do I verify the signature of a package installer manually before running it?\nApple has a great article on how to check the signature of a package installer: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202369: you simply need to open the installer and click on the padlock in the upper-right corner. This works smoothly in most cases.\nBut if an installer contains the pre-install script, when you open the installer you see a popup with the text \"This package will run a program to determine if the software can be installed.\" the popup looks like this:\n\nIn that case, the padlock is grayed-out and you can't click on it until you click \"Allow\".\nThe problem is when you click \"Allow\" the pre-install script will run and it means that you are running some kind of a script before checking its authenticity.\nUsually, the pre-install script only checks the requirements and compatibility as stated in the popup title. But potentially it can do arbitrary stuff e.g. the zoom installer case: https://twitter.com/c1truz_/status/1244737672930824193\nSo is there an option to verify the code signate of a package installer from the GUI before running it or Apple just missed that case and I need to submit a feature request to them?\nOf course, you can always verify the signature from the terminal like that:\n`pkgutil --check-signature, but running that command for any package installer downloaded from the internet doesn't seem right and there should a native and more convenient way to do that.\nThanks!\n\nA: There is no current way to verify the signature using Installer.app before accepting the pre-flight script.

When you deliver an interpreted script, people always get to see the code - by design.  This is the same for workflows and Automator and shortcuts as it is for perl and bash and python.\nUnless and until there is a compiler to convert your source code into machine language and then strip the source names (or obfuscate and tokenize them) even compiled code often comes with source code to aid in debugging.\nThis is one of the most powerful aspects of scripts that people can see them and know what they do. This enables security validation, “fitness for purpose” checks and easy iteration / comprehension / debugging / adaptation. If you don’t want people to check your work a compiled program allows that on a technical level (or at least requires more work to analyze a binary).\nTransparency is baked into this tool chain so you might need another setup if your needs dictate privacy of the code.\n\nA: Generally, Automator workflow (and even applications) are designed to be opened and edited.\nAnd a workflow has to be read to be executed.

Generally speaking, is it possible for a potentially malicious app to do bigger harm if it knows the device's passcode?\nThanks!\nBTW I asked a similar question for macOS here and it seems that for macOS it's true.\n\nA: The answer is actually quite similar as for macOS:\nThe intention of the system is (ofcourse) that apps are not allowed to bypass/skip these passcode prompt windows, and they're not able to \"just\" put in a code if they happen to know.\nSimilarly on recent macOS versions, apps cannot \"just\" interact with controls in windows they have not shown themselves. You can however give apps permissions to do so (for example an app that enables you to create macros of actions within other programs would be a good example of when you actually want to allow this behavior).\nHowever - as your question on macOS centered around malware, the same is true for malware on iOS - if the app does not \"follow the rules\" and intentionally exploit weaknesses in the operating system's implementation, it is theoretically possible for apps to bypass/skip these prompts if it knows the passcode itself. It isn't really \"theoretical\" as in \"can't really be done in practice\", but more like \"it will be a bother to do\".\n", "Q: Copying greyed out files between drives I am trying to copy data from an external NTFS drive to an exFAT drive.\nHowever, some files are greyed out and give me this error when I try to copy them:\nOne or more items in “IMGP0029.AVI” can’t be changed because they are in use.\n\nEven after clicking Continue and typing my password, it doesn't copy.\nFollowing this answer I tried to run SetFile -c \"\" -t \"\" path/to/file.mov but I get:\nERROR: Write Permissions Error.

When I put my Mac to sleep, the external microphone, for example, is still supplied with power.\nIs there any way that once the Mac goes to sleep, that it will remove power from attached devices?\nMy idea was to use Hibernatemode 25 and that's what I did in the end.  The pmset manpage states that the RAM will be disconnected from the power.  This means that there is absolutely no possibility that the system will wake up in the idle state and start charging.  Why can't Hibernatemode 25 work and how can I turn off the power when the Mac is in sleep mode?\n\nA: Not that I have seen. Apple designs the USB / Thunderbolt ports to support wake from sleep so the firmware has them always active by design.

These are not partitions as stated in your question. The APFS container resides in either a single partition on a drive or two partition on separate drives. In your example, the APFS volumes and snapshot all share in the same APFS container. Below shows the sum of the volumes, snapshot and available space equal the APFS container size. There is no lost of space.\n disk1s5s1    14. Gi\n disk1s4       5. Gi\n disk1s2       0.320 Gi\n disk1s6       0.001 Gi\n disk1s1     192. Gi\n disk1s3        .569 Gi\n Available    22.

The value of 569 MiB came from my Big Sur installation. This value should be the same on your Big Sur installation.\n\nBelow was taken from man diskutil. I edited out the text that does not directly relate to the OP's question.\n\nYou are referring to disk identifiers. In your example, the (BSD) disk identifier string variously identifies a virtual logical volume.  It will take the form of diskCsV, or diskCsVsS where C, S, and V are positive decimal integers (possibly multi-digit), and where:\n\n*\n\n*C is an APFS Container.  This is a virtual disk constructed by\nAPFS to represent a collection of APFS Volumes.  Multiple APFS\nContainers can be active simultaneously.\n\n*V is an APFS Volume; it refers to a virtual logical volume that\nis shared out of an APFS Container.  For example, exported from\nan APFS Container designated as disk1 there might be an APFS\nVolume disk1s1, mountable as a file system and usable for file\nstorage via its mountpoint path.\n\n*S is an APFS Snapshot; it refers to a frozen moment in time of\nthe state of files on an APFS Volume.  For example, if APFS\nContainer disk6 has an APFS Volume disk6s3, and two APFS Snapshots\nhave been \"taken\" on it, these, when mounted, might be\ndesignated as disk6s3s1 and disk6s3s2. Zero or more snapshots\ncan be persistently defined on a volume, but only \"active\"\n(mounted) snapshots have disk identifiers.\n\nIt is important for software to avoid relying on numerical ordering of\nany of the parts.  Activities including but not limited to partition\ndeletions and insertions, partition resizing, virtual volume deletions\nand additions, device ejects and attachments due to media insertion\ncycles, plug cycles, authentication lock cycles or reboots, can all cause\n(temporary) gaps and non-increments in the numerical ordering of any of\nthe parts. You must rely on more persistent means of identification, such\nas the various UUIDs.\n\n", "Q: Can't control monitor volume with keyboard on 2018 Mac mini I just decommissioned my 2011 iMac and replaced it with a 2018 Mac mini and a new 27\" monitor.

But if I dont press anything for a continuous time, it dies again.\n\nA: A few things I would suggest trying.\nSince you were installing a new update that is in BETA (11.3 Big Sur) this runs the risk in many factors but nothing to fear...yet.\nLet's try a few things first before seeing if your T2 Chip got a corrupted Firmware patch.\nYou mentioned your MBP is turning on but no screen is coming up.  I would suggest unplugging your MBP first.\nAnother suggestion is to see if you can spend some money on an external USB C tester here -> USB C Tester to see what Voltage and Amps you are getting.  When plugged in with a USB C tester a MBP 13\" 2020 will give you 20.0 Volts and Amps around 0.4 and climbing to a steady 1.09 and above.  This means the computer is turning on etc.  With the tester you can verify if the computer is boot looping.  What this means it is MOST certain it is a Firmware patch issue, WHICH can be resolved with DFU mode.\nNow in order to do DFU mode you will need another MacBook that has a USB C connection that has the same OS as the one you currently tried to install on your computer.  BIG SUR.  I suggest using any MacBook Pro from 2016 and above.  You will also need to install Apple Configurator 2 from the App Store on the Host computer.\nThere is a YouTube guide on how to do all this. But keep in mind you WILL need a MacBook with a USB C port.  Here is a link to the DFU guide for your MBP.\nI am certain you corrupted your firmware and you need to repair it.

I am running macOS Catalina, on a 2017 MacBook Air\nRecently I moved the I-Movie Library off of my mac, and onto an External Hard Drive. So I checked My storage and it said 30 gigabytes free. Then 3 days later, I checked again, and the storage was almost full. I hadn't downloaded any big items, so I was very confused. Here I am now with Final Cut Pro, telling me my hard drive is full. Is something eating up my hard drive?\nApologies for poor use of StackExchange, this is my first post.\n\nA: A few possibilities:\n\n*\n\n*You're running into memory pressure and are creating a lot of swapfiles. This scenario is likely because the 2017 MacBook Air only has 8 GB RAM, which is not a lot by today's standards and definitely insufficient for any video editing in Final Cut Pro. You can check if this is the case by running /Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor.app, clicking on the Memory tab, and looking at the Swap Used field at the bottom. If you're seeing many gigabytes, reboot your system. Note that this situation may be unavoidable if you try to do video editing on such a low-end machine.\n\n\n*A process is creating a lot of cache or tmp files. A reboot may clear these.\n\n\n*There are background downloads occurring, possibly for OS updates or possibly for other apps you have installed. A reboot probably would not clear these.\nIn short, try rebooting. Before you do, though, it would be wise to Get Info on your hard drive in the Finder and see how much space is available, and then compare it after the reboot. If you find yourself still low on space, you'll need to start diving into subdirectories to see where the space is being used. There are also third-party tools that can help with this.\n", "Q: iPad/iOS full tutorial for seniors in Chinese?

It’s extremely frustrating to not see any useful tutorials at all in other languages.\nAny useful help would be much appreciated.\n\nA: The official iPad user guide is available in lots of languages:\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/welcome/ipados/localeselector\nFor example, zh-cn:\nhttps://support.apple.com/zh-cn/guide/ipad/welcome/ipados\n", "Q: How can I record an app in background Due to my poor organization I have 2 simultaneous lectures this semester, at this moment I'm following one on Phone and I record the other one with the Mac (Quicktime and Soundflower)\nIs it possible to record Chrome or Safari in the background while doing other things on the screen?\nAnd for my specifical purpose, is it possible to direct the audio of an app on the headphones and the audio of another app to a different output (external speaker or Soundflower to record)?\n\nA: It is not immediately possible to record the windows of Chrome/Safari when they're not displayed on screen, as they really aren't rendered when not needed.\nYou could possibly make a more involved setup by running a virtualized operating system with Chrome that you can record indepedently on whether it is shown on the monitor or not.\nSimilarly you could do something like running Chrome under X11 using x11vnc or similar to enable off-screen recording.\nThere is also the possibility of using Headless Chrome by way of for example the puppeteer-video-recorder plugin to record a video - however I think it would be quite a hassle to get setup.\nAs for routing the audio as you wish, you should be able to relatively easily set this up by using the Loopback program.\n", "Q: Third party man pages in touch bar The yellow man feature of the touch bar does not seem to use manpath,\nfor example /opt/homebrew/share/man/ is ignored. How do you configure this?\n\nA: You need to add a MANPATH entry to /private/etc/man.conf as follows:\nMANPATH /opt/homebrew/share/man\n\nThis will direct man to include the specified path directory in the search path (from man man):\n\nIf you don't specify an explicit path list with -M or [the] MANPATH [environment variable], man develops its own path list based on the contents of the  configuration\nfile  /private/etc/man.conf. The  MANPATH statements in the configuration file identify particular directories to include in the search path.\n\nIf have tested it in Big Sur and it works.\nWhy doesn't man honor the MANPATH environment variable in this case? When you look for a man page by pressing the \"Open man Page for Selection\" option in the Touch Bar, a process like the following is executed:\nlogin -pfq <username> /usr/bin/man -P ul <command>\n\nwhere:\n\n*\n\n*username is your username\n\n*command is the command whose man page you want to display\n\nlogin starts man directly, and it is not aware of the value of the MANPATH variable.\n", "Q: Missing 300GB harddisk, how to recover it?

I am opening the book in safari, all i want is to automate in some way the ability to take a fixed location screenshot at intervals save it to downloads or desktop(wherever) and then have a my cursor click the next page button and retake a screenshot a multitude of times would this be possible in anyway?\n\nA: You can do this with the new screenshot key command -  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   5  set to 'Capture Selected Portion'.\n\nOnce set, it will capture nominally to Desktop, each titled ScreenShot date/time [eg ScreenShot 2021-03-15 at 4.42.15 pm, so they will file alphabetically. You can capture using Return/Enter or by clicking the Capture button. The selection area is remembered between snaps.\nYou could potentially automate this, but it's a swift process, so I doubt you'd really need to.\nIf you need to change the file save location, see How do I change the location of macOS screen captures?\n\nA: Yes it is feaseble, you can do it using automator to:\n[Repeat X times]\n1 - Screenshot the whole screen.\n2 - Activate your favorite image editor (ie Photoshop)\n3 - Paste\n4 - Activate Safari back\n5 - Click\n[End Repeat]\nLater you will crop the image to the portion of the screen you want, and export each layer as a single page. Photoshop has a built in script for doing that.\nNow the there are some issues, like waiting for the page to load, and cliking the right place. You can instruct automator to wait a few seconds, if you trust your connection and the textbook server - or else you might end up with a very messi situation. The click is also tricky, you can use third party apps like \"cliclick\" to set an absolute point like (1200x,800y), providing the \"next page\" button is always on the same position. Also, you may want to restrict it to, say 50 loops, because the images will eat a lot of memory if you do 2000 pages in a row, and the system can crash.\nI would choose to avoid the click and loop. You can do everything else using a short cut. I know, it is tiresome, 2000 times the shortcut + a click, but if it is not something you do on a daily basis, I belive it worth the trouble.\nBut since you are pirating stuff, don't you think it is easyer to look it up on piratebay or something?

I have a newly acquired Mac Mini 2018 that cannot get out of reboot loops.\nI’ve already formatted the drive using target disk mode and trying to install a fresh copy of Mojave.

I’ve tried:\n\n*\n\n*resetting pram and nvram\n\ndoesn’t make any difference just reboot loops\n\n\n*making a bootable usb using the Apple Mojave install image and terminal instructions\n\nthe usb can be read, I boot holding down Apple key. The option will be given to install Mojave, once I hit enter, it doesn’t take me to MacOS utilities, it reboots and continues to loop\n\n\n*use internet recovery to install OS\ni can successfully enter internet recovery mode, hardliners Ethernet. the progress bar goes to the end in about 5 minutes and instead of entering the installation program, it gets into a reboot loop and will restart in internet recovery mode and start the process all over again\n\n\n*hold down d during boot to get diagnostic mode\nthis doesn’t do anything. I don’t know if this is because the drive is clean. I can hold down Apple D and it will take me internet recovery and then restart loop.\n\n\n*hold down shift during boot to safe mode.\n\nthis doesn’t work because there is no OS on the internal ssd\n\n\n*install Mojave on an USB and hold down Apple to boot, I can get the drive to appear but hitting enter will just restart instead of trying to load the OS\n\nany ideas? Is this computer a lemon?\n\nA: Wiping the entire internal storage may have been a bad idea, as it also contains the Recovery Partition, and some 'keys' used to authenticate Secure Boot. (Also note that by default, you can't boot to a USB external: you need to set the Secure Boot options to allow that.)\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208198\nYour best bet is to install it from another Mac using Target Disk Mode.\n\nA: I ended up finding a solution. For anyone else that runs into this problem, I used Apple Configurator 2, put the bricked Mac mini in DFU mode  (I didn't know you could with MacOS products) and another Mac to revive or restore the computer. The computer will install BridgeOS which will get the computer back to a state where you can reinstall the OS. I believe in my situation, the security firmware was corrupted during a previous failed installation.

You can't join non-contiguous partitions.\nEither delete the partition named 'datashare', or create a new separate partition in the free space.\nYou can perform these operations by choosing Partition from the toolbar in Disk Utility.\n", "Q: How to stop preview from making smoothed lines?

The iPhone 12 has four cameras; the front camera, a general use one on the back, a wide angle one and a zoom camera.\nDuring video chats placed with the WhatsApp app, only the front camera and the general use one of the back can be accessed.\nIt is therefore very difficult to show certain things during a call that would require the wide angle or zoom cameras.\nCan I use choose which of the 4 cameras of the iPhone 12 WhatsApp will use to share in a call?\n\nA: I believe this is a limitation of WhatsApp. On Android, there was a workaround of switching between front and back cameras, and that would cycle between rear cameras, but even that was removed earlier this year.\nFacetime has a workaround to zoom using this method, which may switch the camera being used: https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/secret-facetime-trick-lets-you-zoom-with-your-iphones-camera-0318068/\n\nWhile engaged in a FaceTime call, switch to the rear camera by tapping the \"flip\" button. Now, double-tap your video feed to expand it. Your feed will become larger, hiding other video feeds from view. From here, just pinch out to zoom the feed like you would in the Camera app. If the trick is working correctly, you should see your video zoom in. Of course, pinching in reverse (pinching in) zooms back out.\n\n", "Q: What is the ‘has list-id containing’ iCloud Mail rule? \nWhat is the “has list-id containing” drop down option mean, how do I use it, and what does it do?\n\nA: \na unique identifier for a mailing list regardless of the particular host that serves as the list processor at any given time.\n\nhttps://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2919\nYou can use this to perform an action for a specific mass email, such as a company's newsletter.\nIf you used the email address, that might change. list-id won't change.\nYou can find the list-id in the email header.\n", "Q: Drive boots but isn't \"located\" The APFS drive I'm writing this text from cannot be located by macOS High Sierra.

Just as it came, it went. There is Paragon NTFS/Disk Utility background to this issue mentioned in a comment above, that might come into play here.\nWhat little I did was figure out there were still Paragon NTFS files in the computer. This is well documented online, the command below should point you to the locations.\nsudo rm -rf \"/Library/Application Support/Paragon Software/\"\nsudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.paragon-software.installer.plist\nsudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.paragon-software.ntfs.loader.plist\nsudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.paragon-software.ntfsd.plist\nsudo rm /Library/LaunchAgents/com.paragon-software.ntfs.notification-agent.plist\nsudo rm -rf /Library/Filesystems/ufsd_NTFS.fs/\nsudo rm -rf /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.paragon-software.installer\nsudo rm -rf /Library/Extensions/ufsd_NTFS.kext/\nsudo rm -rf /Library/PreferencePanes/ParagonNTFS.prefPane\n\nI then left the computer running overnight copying files with Finder as an emergency preccaution to at least save the files.\nToday, I restarted the computer (which I had already done once before without results), and after it took longer than usual to boot, everything was working again.\nGuess you can add it to the long history of people having trouble using NTFS on macOS. Tuxera, Paragon, something always comes up sooner or later.\n\nAlternatively, things I was gonna try today. I read someone saying that you can fix the Partition Table by booting to an external macOS drive and adding a new partition to the drive with problems, which \"overwrites the partition map\" back to normal. I also thought about booting into Safe Mode and seeing if it was recognized there, and physically reconnecting the SATA port of the drive.\n", "Q: Windows boot camp icon greyed out I have used Windows on my MacBooks for several years and rarely boot up into Mac. Maybe once every two or three years. So, I know nothing about Mac. I just booted into Mac and now can’t get back to Windows. The icon is greyed out. How can I get back. I didn’t change anything.\n\nA: An easy fix is to power off the macOS and then hold option / alt when you power on and choose Windows.\nOnce you’re back in your preferred OS you can fix the boot order from the control panel.\nApple has details on most recent macOS versions here: https://support.apple.com/guide/bootcamp-control-panel/start-up-your-mac-in-windows-or-macos-bcmp29b8ac66/mac\n", "Q: Can't boot from Big Sur installed on a USB I'm trying to install Big Sur on a USB so that I can boot from the separate installation on the usb.

So it probably has something to do with the usb or installation.\n\n*I've tried reinstalling mac os on the drive several times, and none of them booted so it wasn't a fluke with writing.\n\n*I was able to turn this same usb drive into a mac installer drive, and that booted up fine, so it seems likely there's some nuanced flag I forgot to set on the usb.\n\n*I tried resetting the parameter ram, but that didn't help.\n\n*I tried installing Catalina instead, but all I could find was the dmg for Catalina, and didn't want to go through the process of first writing that somewhere then trying to install it, but that may be my next step if a separate drive doesn't work (see below).\n\nThe one thing I haven't tried is seeing if I follow the same process for a different usb drive if I encounter the same issue. That should at least narrow it down to the process of installing or the image itself.\nUpdates\nUsing a different device with the same image did work, so it seems like this is a hardware problem with the usb device. However, I've been unable to get this to work with multiple different usb-c devices.\nCatalina also worked, so this seems to be something funny with Big Sur.\nI've also be unable to upgrade from Catalina to Big Sur once the installation is working.\n\nA: Get a new drive. That process is quite a bit longer than you might think you need, but it’s the safest and most direct correct solution. If you have errors with the install it’s likely these are the causes in order:\n\n*\n\n*Bad USB storage\n\n*Bad download of the installer (very unlikely, but it happens)\n\n*Not following the guide\n\n*Failure of the Mac (more likely USB port or cable or hub)\n\nCatalina and Bog Sur are well vetted now. When you asked this, Big Sur is still getting some edge cases patched up, but either should work well now for anyone facing this situation.\n\nA: I actually tried this myself yesterday and it works to perform the install but the same as the original post happens to me as well (Big Sur only). Brand new Sandisk Pro SSD USB drive - 128GB. Not sure if it's something with Sandisk? What USB stick did you end up using? And did you\never get this working with Big Sur?\nSide note: Catalina works just fine.

I have a 13\" 2020 M1 MacBook Pro (MBP).\nI'm currently experiencing some issues with a third-party USB-C hub. I'm considering replacing it with a USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter. The page for the adapter, if read literally, suggests that the M1 MacBook Air (MBA) can drive 4K 60Hz video via this adapter, but the M1 MBP cannot.\nCan anyone confirm that this adapter can transmit 4K 60Hz signal from an M1 MBP?\n\nA: Yes, it can, but you may have the old version of the Apple Digital AV adaptor. You need to make sure the adapter version is A2XXX, not A1XXX, since Apple updated that adapter in 2019 to support HDMI 2.0.\nI have an M1 MacBook Pro and I can confirm the updated version of the Apple Digital AV adaptor does support a 4K 60hz HDMI connection.\n\nA: I just tried plugging a 4K monitor into my M1 MBP using that adapter, and it only gave me options up to 30Hz at 4K.\nI also didn't see any M1 Macs listed in the 60Hz list. So I suspect that all the M1 Macs will only run at 30Hz using a 4K screen on that adapter.\n\nA: I can also confirm that 4k@60Hz is supported on a MacBook Pro (13-inch, M1, 2020, two thunderbolt ports) running macOS 12.0.1 (21A559), with the USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter A2119.\nThis is despite what the linked page says.\n", "Q: applescript - do shell output to variable is blank Hi I'm trying to get the cpuValue but I get \"\" for the variable.\nset cpuValue to \"\"\ngetProcessPercentCPU(\"Safari\")\n\non getProcessPercentCPU(someProcess)\n    set cpuValue to do shell script \"/bin/ps -xco %cpu,command | /usr/bin/awk '/\" & someProcess & \"$/ {print $1}'\"\nend getProcessPercentCPU\n\nlog \"output:\" & cpuValue\n\nOutput\n\"\"\n\n\nA: AppleScript treats variables created with set as local by default (although the documentation isn't totally clear IMO). This means that the cpuValue variable inside on getProcessPercentCPU is local to that handler, and different from the variable with the same name in the outer scope.\nEssentially, you have two different variables that just happen to have the same name, one set to \"\", the other to the CPU percentage for the Safari process.\nYou could solve this by adding global cpuValue inside the handler, but returning values in global variables isn't good programming practice. It's almost always better to return values like a function:\nset cpuValue to getProcessPercentCPU(\"Safari\")\n    \non getProcessPercentCPU(someProcess)\n    set processPercentCPU to do shell script \"/bin/ps -xco %cpu,command | /usr/bin/awk '/\" & someProcess & \"$/ {print $1}'\"\n    return processPercentCPU\nend getProcessPercentCPU\n    \nlog \"output:\" & cpuValue\n\n", "Q: How can I fix my system lagging due to problems with Firefox plugin-container process (IOGraphicsAccelerator, too many contexts) I was running a google meet call in Firefox and had a few other tabs open, including a gitlab one with an embedded video (which might have been part of the cause of this) when I noticed considerable lagging in the responsiveness of windows, not just firefox. I found the following conspicuous messages in the console app:\nIOGraphicsAccelerator::newUserClient(): process plugin-container (PID 1934) has too many contexts (510) + queues (0) + device (171) + shared (171) created. Possibly leaking?\n\nIt also affects opening browser tabs in e.g. Safari and general system responsiveness.\nI couldn't find much on this kind of error message other than the plugin-container process seems to belong to Firefox.\nThis is a Macbook Pro with macOS Catalina 10.15.7.\n\nA: Restarting Firefox solved that issue for me, I no longer observe said messages in the console app and the system behaves as usual.\n", "Q: Unable to customise Samba in macOS Big Sur I'm trying to customise the parameters of /usr/sbin/smbd in Big Sur. Most posts advise to tweak  /etc/nsmb.conf. However it seems that modifying /etc/nsmb.conf has no effect for me.\nI even tried introducing a syntax error in /etc/nsmb.conf. Stopping smbd with\nlaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist and checking that no smbd is alive. Finally restarting smbd with launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.smbd.plist. But /usr/sbin/smbd doesn't pick up any syntax error and runs normally.\nI tried looking for other *smb* files in /etc and /Library and found none. Could it be that Apple doesn't allow modifying the parameters of smbd in Big Sur? Or perhaps should I look at other files?\nThanks for any suggestions!\n\nA: See the comments above from @nohillside and @Marc Wilson. Samba cannot be configured in OSX as you would do in Linux. Thanks @nohillside and @Marc Wilson.\n", "Q: Impossible to key-press three near keys I have never noticed this before, but it seems like MacOS prevents certain key combinations to be pressed.\nFor instance, try pressing at the same time the keys z s and c on a standard Qwerty keyboard. This works and should write something like \"csz\". But if the three keys are all adjacent, for instance z s and x, MacOS drops one or two, or all of them, for instance giving you just \"z\" or \"zx\" or nothing at all. I've noticed this consistently across multiple Mac devices.\nSince I'm programming a software that heavily relies on various key combinations (it's a virtual MIDI keyboard that transforms the computer keyboard into a MIDI controller), how to disable this behaviour?\n\nA: Using the macOS Keyboard Viewer gives you a good overview of the problem. If you hold down Z and X, and then try to press other buttons, you'll see that S, A, Q, W, 1 and 2 will not activate, but all other keys will.\nSimilarly, holding CV stops DFER34 from working. MN stops HJYU67.\n\nYou may want to use the low-level keyDown(with:) and keyUp(with:) methods of NSResponder, or other APIs used for gaming keys, before confirming that it's a hardware limitation.\n(Note that programming help is off-topic here: try Stack Overflow for further discussion.)\nhttps://code.bitbebop.com/macos-game-keyboard-input/\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamecontroller/gckeyboardinput\n\nA: This is a hardware limitation of the built-in keyboard (and most non-gamer consumer keyboards)\nYou have to get a separate keyboard which supports NKRO (N-Key Rollover).\nThere might be issues with macOS compatibility with some n-key rollover keyboards USB keyboard acting strange with MacBook Pro\nSo check if it's compatible before you buy\n", "Q: Can't use VSCode integrated terminal while on Team Viewer My development team recently rented a Mac machine through MacInCloud.\nI've prepared my development environment in this machine, but it seems like Visual Studio Code does not register certain keystrokes correctly like ENTER and BACKSPACE from my local machine (I'm using linux). Ex. When I open the terminal and I enter BACKSPACE for deleting a character an 'a' in inserted, the same goes for the ENTER key.\n\nIs there a hidden setting in team viewer for fixing this behavior or a general way to bedbug keyboard mapping or shortcut functions when they fail to work as expected?\n\nA: Apparently there is a known bug with Team Viewer's Keyboard mapping on Linux, read more here. This is a Team Viewer error only and can be fixed by using another Remote Access software, I am using Chrome Remote Desktop (as suggested by user206904) though performance is not great.\n", "Q: How to uninstall DaisyDisk?

Does anyone know?  They don't have any information on their website. I should have been more careful.\nhttps://daisydiskapp.com/\n\nA: You may want to reinstall it and use \"AppCleaner\" to properly remove it and all of its remnants.\n\nA: If you installed it from the App Store you can delete it from LaunchPad or Finder. Finder moving it to trash works for the direct download version of the app. Spotlight should reveal the location of the app in most cases.\n", "Q: Hotkey to switch to Google Chrome and go to the omnibox (location bar) I would like to setup a keyboard shortcut/hotkey that would switch to Google Chrome and go to the omnibox (address bar).  I intend to use it invoke various custom search engines.\nI found a couple of related questions but not quite there:\n\n*\n\n*hotkey to switch application -- TotalSpaces -- requires a trackpad, which I don't use -- my daily driver is the keyboard.\n\n*Script to raise a single window to the front -- I don't know how bind an AppleScript script to a hotkey (I'm new to the Mac).\n\nI had done something like this with AutoHotKey on Windows.  What's the right tool on the Mac?\nI am already using Karabiner-Elements and Alfred.\n\nA: I think your task is ill-defined & what you have found so far overkill - (that this is because you are new to Mac means that's nothing to be ashamed of, we all start somewhere;) If all you need is to bring an app to the front & enable the location area you can do it in Applescript in 2 lines.\ntell application \"Google Chrome\" to activate\ntell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"l\" using command down\n\nperhaps with an optional delay 0.5 in between those lines in case it's a bit slow to come to the front.\nThe only difficulty is to make this key-commandable.\nIf you set this up as a Script event in Automator, then in previous OSes [I think up to Mojave, I haven't used anything newer] you could just define it as a Service. Once defined & saved, you can then call the Service using\nSystem Prefs > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services\nI think this has changed since Catalina, but someone else would need to detail precisely how.\nSo long as you give it a shortcut that doesn't conflict with anything else, then simply hitting that shortcut will bring Chrome to the front [or launch it if it's not already running] & set the cursor into the search/location bar. It will do this on the current tab if one is already open, or make a new window if nothing was open.\n", "Q: How do I use MacOS Terminal or other app to format an MBR FAT32 SD card as a 0x0C partition, rather that 0x0B? Apple's Disk Utility app can format an SD card as MBR FAT32; but in the Terminal, I confirmed the SD card's partition is in fact 0x0B:\n> sudo gpt show /dev/disk3\n\n start      size  index  contents\n     0         1         MBR\n     1      2047         \n  2048  62746624      1  MBR part 11\n\n\"MBR part 11\" refers to 0x0B.

Just use the command fdisk with the -e option to make the change. In your case, the commands would be as follows.\ndiskutil unmountdisk disk3\nsudo fdisk -e /dev/disk3\ns 1\nc\nq\n\n\nNote: The diskutil unmountdisk disk3 unmounts of all volumes on disk3. The fdisk -e /dev/disk3 command needs to entered immediately afterwards or the volumes may automatically remount. (In this case, there should be only one volume.) Failure to do so may cause a fdisk tp attempt a shared lock. If successful, then a y (for yes) will need to be entered after entering the q command.\n\nAn example is given below.\nMarlin-3:~ davidanderson$ diskutil unmountdisk disk3\nUnmount of all volumes on disk3 was successful\nMarlin-3:~ davidanderson$ sudo fdisk -e /dev/disk3\nPassword:\nfdisk: could not open MBR file /usr/standalone/i386/boot0: No such file or directory\nEnter 'help' for information\nfdisk: 1> s 1\n         Starting       Ending\n #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 1: 0B 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         2 -    1953186] Win95 FAT-32\nPartition id ('0' to disable)  [0 - FF]: [B] (? for help) c\nfdisk:*1> q\nWriting current MBR to disk.\nMarlin-3:~ davidanderson$ \n\nThe rest of this answer is just background information.

This command is particularly useful for reassigning an\n         existing partition to OpenBSD.\n\n flag    Make the given partition table entry bootable.  Only one entry\n         can be marked bootable.  If you wish to boot from an extended\n         partition, you will need to mark the partition table entry for\n         the extended partition as bootable.\n\n update  Update the machine code in the memory copy of the currently\n         selected boot block.

The /usr/standalone/i386/boot0 file is not part of macOS. Instead of reading this file, fdisk substitutes zeros. This results in the update command erasing any existing machine code instead of updating with actual machine code.\n\n \n\nA: Your fdisk invocation should have already partitioned it as type 12. You can press the Ignore button and verify via Terminal that that's the case, then simply eject the disk from your computer and use it wherever you intend to use it.\nIf you intend to use this drive on your Mac, you will need to format and mount it after running fdisk:\nsudo newfs_msdos /dev/disk3s1\nsudo mkdir /Volumes/FLASH\nsudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk3s1 /Volumes/FLASH\n\nHere FLASH is an arbitrary volume name that I chose for sample purposes; feel free to choose your own.\nAs a clarifying point, the s1 portion of /dev/disk3s1 targets the first partition of disk3. If you were to specify just disk3 instead, the newfs_msdos command would overwrite the partition table.\n", "Q: Stuck on login for one user after migration assistant I recently got my MacBook Air 2018 fixed after having some cryptographic error.\nI backed up all my data with time machine and I was able to transfer my data using migration assistant. I now have 3 users and I am only able to log in to two out of the 3. The third user is actually the only one I use and has everything on it. When I log in, (I know it’s the right password), I’m stuck on the loading page. I’ve been waiting for almost two hours.\nI know there are threads that have a similar problem but the solutions offered didn’t really fit the criteria of my situation (meaning I was able to log in to other users except one). Please help I am so grateful it’s my university’s spring break I think I’d be having a panic attack if it wasn’t. Id really really appreciate simple and detailed instructions because I’m not knowledgeable on operating systems, etc. Thank you so much.\n**I don’t know if this info is related to my problem but before I got my MacBook Air fixed, it  couldn’t update the OS due to that cryptographic error I mentioned before. So when I backed up my data it was on mojave. I didn’t realize my OS wasn’t updating until I needed to download XCode for class and it required the latest OS. I ended up wiping the whole disk after backing up my data and then going to a distribution center. Now I have the latest OS (Big Sur) and that is the backstory to my current problem after transferring my data back.\nHere is the link to the spindump.txt file : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hscr19_0gnp_4TxW3XxtFgeirxVTIOy5/view?usp=sharing\n\nA: We can try to approach this a few different ways. Let's start with the easiest and see if we can collect a sysdiagnose during the login process:\n\n*\n\n*Log in to one of your working accounts.\n\n*Run the following Terminal command to enable kernel symbolication: sudo nvram boot-args=\"keepsyms=1\". Make sure to copy-paste this so that you're entering straight quotes rather than curly/“smart” quotes. (If you get a permission error, you will first need to disable System Integrity Protection. You can re-enable it after you're done with this investigation.)\n\n*Reboot your machine normally.\n\n*Attempt to log in to your problematic user account.\n\n*As soon as you attempt to log in, press and hold the ShiftControlOptionCommand keys together, and while holding these keys press and release the period . key.\n\n*This is intended to silently initiate a sysdiagnose. Wait for at least 10 minutes to give it ample time to complete, then do a forced shutdown (press and hold the [POWER] button for 10 seconds).\n\n*Wait 10 more seconds with the machine off.\n\n*Press the [POWER] button. Immediately afterwards, press and hold CommandS in order to boot your machine into Single User Mode. We are doing this because otherwise the sysdiagnose report will get deleted when /tmp is cleaned during multiuser boot.\n\n*You can release the CommandS keys when you're at a command prompt and there is no more scrolling text.\n\n*From here, you need to move the sysdiagnose report to a location where it will not be deleted: mv /private/var/tmp/sysdiagnose* /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Desktop. Here you need to replace YOUR_USERNAME with the short username of one of your functioning users.\n\n*exit\n\n*Log in with the functioning user whose name you used in Step 10.\n\n*Locate the sysdiagnose archive on your Desktop. Double-click to decompress it.\n\n*Upload the spindump.txt file in the decompressed report directory using PasteBin or an equivalent service and add the link to your question.\n\nUPDATE 1:\nLooking at your spindump, there are several processes that are using significant CPU:\n% grep \"CPU Time:         \" spindump.txt  | sort -d | tail -n 5\nCPU Time:         0.330s (661.7M cycles, 244.5M instructions, 2.71c/i)\nCPU Time:         0.792s (1615.4M cycles, 642.4M instructions, 2.51c/i)\nCPU Time:         2.675s (5.9G cycles, 7.4G instructions, 0.80c/i)\nCPU Time:         4.263s (9.6G cycles, 9.0G instructions, 1.07c/i)\nCPU Time:         6.450s (12.6G cycles, 15.3G instructions, 0.82c/i)\n\nThe 6.45s one belongs to spindump, which is to be expected. The more interesting processes are\n% grep -B 12 4.263s spindump.txt | grep Process:\nProcess:          ReportCrash [369]\n% grep -B 12 2.675s spindump.txt | grep Process:\nProcess:          MRT [83]\n% grep -B 12 0.792s spindump.txt | grep Process:\nProcess:          WindowServer [144]\n% grep -B 12 0.330s spindump.txt | grep Process:\nProcess:          kernel_task [0]\n\nFirst, it's surprising to see ReportCrash running. This suggests that there has been a recent process that's crashed and is now being analyzed and prepared for reporting to Apple. Although there are several possible explanations for why this is occurring right now, one theory is that either a login item or a launch agent is (repeatedly) crashing upon your attempted login. You can check this by examining (either from a working account or from Single User Mode) the /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports directory and sorting by timestamp (ls -lt in Terminal / command line). Check for crash logs around the time of your attempted login.\nNext, MRT is using a lot of time. MRT is the Malware Removal Tool. Examining its stackshot, its main thread doesn't seem to be blocked and appears to just be doing a lot of normal I/O and analysis. I'm guessing it's doing its ordinary job of scanning your filesystem for malware. Nothing to indicate that it's involved in the failure chain.\nFinally, coming to WindowServer and kernel_task, either of which can easily stall a login if they misbehave, I again don't see anything in either stackshot to indicate abnormal behavior.\nSo we have ruled out CPU starvation as a failure mode here. Now let's see if there's a blocked process within the critical login path. I notice prominently the absence of Finder from the list of running processes, so there is very clearly something preventing it from launching.\n% grep -c \"Process:          Finder\" spindump.txt\n0\n\nLet's see if there are any processes that are trying to fork() and might be getting stalled:\n% grep \"Parent:           \" spindump.txt | grep -v \"launchd \\[1\\]\" | sort -d \nParent:           UserAccountUpdater [363]\nParent:           UserAccountUpdater [363]\nParent:           UserAccountUpdater [363]\nParent:           kernel_task [0]\nParent:           loginwindow [147]\nParent:           sysdiagnose [404]\nParent:           systemstats [84]\n\nThat's interesting. UserAccountUpdater is running, suggesting that your user account is being upgraded. Given that you mentioned using Migration Assistant to bring your Mojave account into Big Sur, it makes sense that the upgrade has started and has not had a chance to complete. So is anything blocked on this?\n% grep UserAccountUpdater spindump.txt | grep block\n             *1000  ???

This frame comes from a thread in loginwindow, which will also absolutely hang up the login process if something isn't right. There are three children of UserAccountHelper:\n% grep -C 6 \"Parent:           UserAccountUpdater\" spindump.txt | grep \"Process:          \"\nProcess:          mbcachecleanup [396]\nProcess:          migrationhelper [389]\nProcess:          ReminderMigrationTool [390]\n\nmbcachecleanup and migrationhelper both have healthy traces.

One was accounted for above. Another is in UserAccountHelper, blocking access to the font registry. Very interestingly, fontworker and fontd are both also blocked this way. fontd's instance is in the com.apple.xtype.ScannerQueue dispatch queue. This immediately leads me to suspect that the font manager is hanging while scanning your local font library. Perhaps there is a corrupted font and/or font collection installed in your user ~/Library/Fonts and/or ~/Library/FontCollections. You should rename these directories and try logging in again.\nTwo more frames are in WiFiAgent and otherbsd. I also saw blocked frames in securityd and secinitd which may be relevant, but let's investigate what we've discussed so far.\nTo summarize:\n\n*\n\n*Rename your user's Fonts and FontCollections directories (probably easiest to boot into Single User Mode and do this from the command line, e.g., cd /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Library && mv Fonts FontsDISABLED && mv FontCollections FontCollectionsDISABLED).\n\n*Check if there's anything in that user's ~/Library/LaunchAgents.\n\n*Check in /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports for crash reports around the time of failure.\n\n", "Q: How to delete a file with prefix `~$` I use the command ls in a terminal.

I am not able to reset the Mac and I can't reinstall macOS as it doesn't recognize the HDD. I have tried internet recovery.\nMacBook Pro 2011 early is my model.\n\nA: Damage from magnets is hardly possible\nHowever, hard drives can be damaged by extremely strong magnets, but this is much more likely when the hard drive is in use. Typically, a hard drive is also difficult to access without removing it from a computer, so the chance of accidental magnetic damage to these components is very low. And if, for example, the read / write head is damaged, the quality of life is lower but the data is not gone\nCRT monitors and televisions are also easily damaged by magnets, but the technology these devices use is extremely out of date and most people now own a plasma or LCD TV.\nExcept floppy disk\n3.5 Floppy disks have a certain amount of magnetism, so proving that magnets can destroy data on floppy disks has reinforced the myth that magnets can also destroy components in a computer. However, if you buy a cheap magnet and place it near a floppy disk, the magnet will stick to the floppy disk and after a few seconds the information on that disk will be destroyed. You will then no longer be able to access the data.\nOther storage media\nIn general, newer storage devices will not be affected by magnets as they have no magnetism of any kind. Although many computers, hard drives, and other storage devices have electrons in them, a normal magnet does not have the power to interfere with these electrons. This also applies to today's memory cards and flash media.\nNot magnetic media\nOptical media such as CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray Discs do not use magnets to read or write data, and the same applies to flash media such as memory cards, USB sticks and solid state drives (SSDs), which is why magnets cannot cause data loss on these storage media.\n\nIf you do not have a T2 security chip and FileVault activated, it is easier to rescue the data.\nIf you say that your hard drive is defective and your Mac cannot start and you want to recover your data, you may want to try connecting that hard drive to another Mac and try \"First Aid\".\nDoesn't it help? Check with a hard drive recovery company that specializes in data recovery.\n\nA: If your drive is formatted with HFS+ and not APFS, you may be able to use DiskWarrior to repair your drive enough to use Target Disk Mode to extract your data through another Mac onto another disk. However, if the magnet damaged the partition table, or primary and alternate volume headers, or too much of the catalog & extents files, DiskWarrior may not be able to help. In that case you may have to use a professional recovery service like DriveSavers or face the music and start over.\nIn any of the above situations, once you've gotten your data recovered (or decided not to), you will need to do a full erase & install of macOS. You can do this by creating a bootable installer on another Mac.\n", "Q: Time Machine keeps validating backup, how to identify reason? I have a Time Machine backup of my Macbook running the latest MacOS (11.2.3) on my Time Capsule (so not a local drive).\nRecently I've noticed that the \"Validating backup\"-step runs often, presumably daily, which is much more frequent than I expect.   (I notice the drive spins up and keeps running).   Time Machine reports backups are being done on a regular basis.\nIs there a way to get more insight in how Time Machine is working on my machine, and why the validation step happens so frequently?\n\nA: I was suspecting a broken file system on the Time Capsule, but needed proof.   After yet another mysteriously cancelling verification step, I found https://superuser.com/q/1126990/7401 which ended up in\nlog show --last 3d --style syslog  --predicate 'senderImagePath contains[cd] \"TimeMachine\"' --info|less\n\nwhich in turn let me find this log line:\n2021-04-05 00:48:38.359222+0200  localhost backupd[276]: (TimeMachine) [com.apple.TimeMachine:General] fsck returned an unknown termination status: 8\n\nSo, the file system check program reported an error message but Time Machine didn't let me know.  Apparently 8 indicates unrepairable error, which is a rather bad sign.  I then mounted the \"Data\" drive holding the backupbundle file on Time Capsule manually, and as Disk Utility did not want to mount the backupbundle, I found https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/39842/3157 resulting in\nsudo hdiutil attach -nomount -readwrite /Volumes/Data/XXX.backupbundle\n\ngiving\n/dev/disk2              GUID_partition_scheme           \n/dev/disk2s1            EFI                             \n/dev/disk2s2            Apple_HFS            \n\nNow the Time Machine backup shows in Disk Utility, and I could run First Aid on the drive which slowly but successfully repaired the filesystem.\n", "Q: Unable to update to Mac OS 11.2.3?

When I open it, it takes around 10-15 seconds to load. Every time. This is extremely frustrating and I need to fix it.\nI run an Apple Macbook pro 2016 with 16 GB or RAM and an i5. Performance hardware-wise shouldnt be the issue.\nSpecs: Mac OS 11.2\nOutlook 16.47\nAccount: Exchange Mail account\nProblem might be that the exchange account is now 10 years old and heavily used. For obvious reasons, I cannot delete content there. Is there any way to speed things up?\n\nA: tl;dr: Having many Shared Calendars caused excessive CPU utilization & poor performance due to lengthy Outlook syncs. Removing the Shared Calendars solved my performance issues...\nWell, I've got a 2019 16\" MacBook Pro with 32GB RAM and an Intel 8-core i9 CPU. I've been fighting performance issues with Outlook for weeks/months and finally figured out the culprit (for me, at least): Shared Calendars.\nHere were my Outlook for Mac symptoms:\n\n*\n\n*Slow to open and VERY slow to respond either when being launched from an active session or when resuming from a sleep state.\n\n\n*Excessive and prolonged CPU utilization during either state mentioned above\n\n\n*When viewed in Activity Monitor during these states, frequent \"Outlook not responding\" messages\n\n\n*When clicking to respond to a meeting reminder pop-up, spinning pinwheels of death for prolonged periods (sometimes several minutes).\n\n\n*Performance impact mostly seen when doing anything related to Calendar functions\nHere are my specs from an Outlook for Mac Diagnostic Log:\nOutlook for Mac 2021 Build: 16.52.21080801\nActivation Type: Subscription\nLicense Type: Microsoft 365 Subscription\nMicrosoft AutoUpdate Build: 4.38.21080801\nMac OS Version: Version 11.5.1 (Build 20G80)\nCPU Architecture: Intel x86_64\nOK, so far, so good. Then I saw these two lines:\nNumber of reminders: 84,135\nNumber of Calendar Items: 158,532\nNo, those are not typos, so WTH is happening?!?  Here's what I speculate...\nFor convenience, I had added about 25 Shared Calendars to my Calendar view but never displayed more than 2 or 3 at once. They're handy because you can quickly toggle someone's calendar on to check availability, schedule meetings, etc. The problem is that when you add that many calendars, Outlook both downloads all those calendar items to a local cache (more on that below) but also keeps ALL those calendars sync'd. I presume that when you first open Outlook or resume from a sleep state, it triggers a Calendar sync and then chokes on all those Calendar Items and Reminders across your personal calendar AND ALL the Shared Calendars.\nI'm not an Outlook expert, but know it creates a local cache of all your Outlook items so you can view them when you're offline.  In the Windows world, Outlook historically saved all this cached info in a single OST file.  However, on MacOS it appears that Outlook uses a local SQLite DB to index the cached items but stores all of them (emails, calender items, etc.) as files deep inside your Outlook Profile directory. For example, Bill Smith would have his Calendar Items stored here:\n/Users/bill.smith/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/Outlook/Outlook 15 Profiles/Main Profile/Data/Events\nBTW, ever done a unfiltered Finder search using Spotlight and seen a ton of files with descriptions of \"olk15_event\" or \"olk15_message\" in the Kind column? You guessed it: those are your Calendar Items and Emails stored as INDIVIDUAL files in your Outlook Profile's directory structure.\nSo what's the fix? Remove any Shared Calendars you absolutely do not need daily access to.  As soon as you remove them, Outlook will start deleting all these cached files out of your Outlook Profile folders. After I removed all my Shared Calendars, my stats looked like this:\nNumber of reminders: 220\nNumber of Calendar Items: 1,215\nBut the best part is that Outlook now launches and resumes from sleep in just a few seconds and the CPU spikes only last a few seconds before settling to under 10% and then under 1%. And...NO MORE SPINNING PINWHEELS OF DEATH!\nIn a perfect world, there would be an option you could set that only downloaded and sync'd a Shared Calendar when you actually selected it. I'm not holding my breath that that will ever happen.\nAfter speaking with my IT Support Desk, I'm going to see if there's a way to change the retention on old Calendar Items that's independent of Email retention. I mean, who needs access to Calendar Items that are a year or more old, right? Emails, sure, but Meetings & Appointments?\nI'm documenting all this because I'm shocked that there haven't been more posts about this particular issue. Hope this helps someone out there!\n", "Q: Recurring prompt to confirm Style Sheet when opening Safari - How can I get rid of it? Every time I open Safari, I'm asked to choose a style sheet.

I like the idea of Finder tags and I want to use them. I tried tagging files in Finder. Then I clicked the tag in the sidebar and... it just shows a list of all my tags... instead of the documented behavior listed on Apple's website as well as user forums. Please pardon my impudence for daring to question the absolute wisdom of the Mac user interface and its documentation, but is there anything outside of the listed instructions that I need to do in order to get tagged files to show up? I just wanna use tags.\n\nA: You need to have the tags in the sidebar match the tags on your files.\nIf you only use files you tagged yourself, on that Mac, then this is rarely an issue. If you have tags from other users, or share across your network with the same colours but different definitions, you need to dig deeper & click \"Show all tags\" or change which tags show in your favourites.\nTags are in Finder Prefs [prefs for any app can be invoked with  Cmd ⌘   ,  [comma] or from the menu item that shows the App Name, in this case Finder.\nIf you have inherited files from other users or other machines, these labels may not match what you are expecting. A visit to this pref will \"re-think\" what all the tags are. You may find the tags are 'similar but not identical'. You need to set visibility by checking the box & also you can drag into your preferred sidebar order.\nHere's a [rather awkward] screenshot showing that I have 2 'orange' tags with 2 different names [amongst others]. Files tagged as 'Imminent' are not part of the group tagged as 'Orange'.\n\nIf you click \"All Tags\" then you do get an alphabetical list of all tags in the next column. Clicking any one of those will then show the files tagged in that group.\n\n", "Q: Theme setting missing in iPhone Gmail app I want to turn off dark mode for the gmail app. It turned on yesterday without asking me. I know about the global iPhone dark mode setting and it’s set to dark mode but gmail should have its own setting as well But it’s missing. See attached screenshot. It should be listed under the settings section.\nWhere is it now?\n\n\nA: Indeed there doesn’t seem to be a Gmail setting to turn off syncing to the iOS theme (I also looked within the settings of specific mail accounts). This is something Google would need to implement - you can provide this feedback to them from the Gmail app (“Send feedback” is below “Settings” in the side navigation).\nAs a workaround, you can add “Dark Mode” to your iOS Control Center in System Preferences. This will allow toggling the global theme quickly.\nI also noticed that the Outlook iOS app supports overriding the system theme, if you’re looking for an alternative to Gmail.\n", "Q: How to properly unmount image (dmg / sparsebundle) [macOS Mojave 10.14.6]\nI've recently discovered r/w disk images and the particularly fascinating sparse bundle.\nAs I understand it, an image (the .dmg or .sparsebundle itself) is \"attached\" and \"detached\" much the same as an external drive, for example, would be \"plugged in\" or \"unplugged.\" The volumes contained in either case would then be \"mounted\" and \"unmounted.\" But here's the problem:\ncaffeinatedbits ~$ hdiutil create -size 1g -layout GPTSPUD -fs APFS -volname temp -type SPARSEBUNDLE -nospotlight -encryption AES-256 temp.sparsebundle\nEnter a new password to secure \"temp.sparsebundle\": \nRe-enter new password: \ncreated: /Users/caffeinatedbits/temp.sparsebundle\ncaffeinatedbits ~$ \ncaffeinatedbits ~$ hdiutil attach temp.sparsebundle -mountroot .\nEnter password to access \"temp.sparsebundle\": \n/dev/disk8              GUID_partition_scheme           \n/dev/disk8s1            Apple_APFS                      \n/dev/disk9              EF57347C-0000-11AA-AA11-0030654 \n/dev/disk9s1            41504653-0000-11AA-AA11-0030654 /Users/caffeinatedbits/temp\n\nI noted here that attaching the image apparently auto-mounts the volume.

Or could that cause corruption?

As I understand it, it's a very bad idea to do this while the volume is still mounted, but what about the image itself remaining attached?

As of Mac OS X 10.4, dev_name can also be a mount-\n            point.  If Disk Arbitration is running, detach will use it to unmount any filesystems and detach the image.  If not, detach will attempt to unmount any filesystems\n            and detach the image directly (using the `eject' ioctl).  If Disk Arbitration is not running, it may be necessary to unmount the filesystems with umount(8) before\n            detaching the image.  eject is a synonym for detach.  In common operation, detach is very similar to diskutil(8)'s eject.\n\nSo the recommended way to detach would be to simply pass the mountpoint. I’ve tested this on Catalina and it works for me.

The way that APFS works is by creating its own container that covers an entire partition and then mounts it as a separate virtual disk (disk9) which can then have its own virtual partition (disk9s1).\n", "Q: What is causing Word to start selecting text while I type? Periodically while typing in Word on a 2019 MacBook Pro, my keystrokes are captured by some sort of search mode that causes them to select text instead. In the example below, while I was typing \"synonym\", the letter \"n\" did not print to the screen, but caused the selection of text until the next \"n\" in the paragraph. Then when I typed the letter \"p\", the selection expanded to cover the next letter \"p\".\n\n\n\nWhat is making me enter this mode and causing Word to select text by itself like this? Is it related to brushing the touchpad somehow?\nUpdate: This seems to happen especially when I type the letter \"y\". And it also happens in Outlook.\n\nA: I asked and answered this question over at SuperUser. It turns out to be a Word shortcut for extending your selection, bound to F8. It only happens to me on the MacBook Pro touch bar, because of the much more sensitive function keys that I can brush when I type 'y'.\nYou can disable this shortcut by going to Tools > Customize Keyboard, selecting the category \"All Commands\", searching for \"ExtendSelection\", and clicking Remove for the F8 hotkey.\n", "Q: Enabling external booting on a fusion drive Mac I am trying to change the secure boot settings so that I can allow booting from an external disk.

Just the basic records.\nQuestion #1\nHow can I verify that my iCloud account has a recovery key?\nQuestion #2\nHow do I remove that key so that my iCloud account can NOT be used to unlock my drive?\n\nA: You can run this command from the terminal to verify that your iCloud account has a recovery key:\nsudo fdesetup list -verbose -extended\n\nThe list should include your OS users as well as a \"iCloud Recovery Record\".\nThe easiest way to remove the recovery key from the GUI is simply to disable FileVault 2 and then enable it again afterwards (this time do not store the recovery key in iCloud ofcourse). The process does take considerable time, but you can use the computer while it processes.\n", "Q: What does it mean to give apps access to Documents folder on Mac? A lot of apps seem to request access to the Documents folder. Does giving them access mean they can both read/write anything in this folder?\nIsn't this very dangerous and doesn't that mean we really shouldn't be using the Document folder to store private/personal information?\n\nA: The normal Unix permissions system gives the user an area of the disk for their files (the user domain). Apps and other processes launched by the user run 'as the user' and can read and write anywhere in the user domain, (but not in another user's domain, or in system areas.)\nSimilarly, processes run by other users can't read or write in your user account. (Note that System processes are often 'other users'.)\nCatalina and Big Sur are even stricter, requiring the user's express permission for an app to read and write to the Documents folder. This essentially creates a white-list of apps that are allowed in the Documents folder. There are similar white-lists for your Desktop folder, Downloads, and network volumes and external drives.\nThis added security means that a malicious app, unwittingly launched by the user, can't access your files in the Documents folder, without your express permission. Thus, the Documents folder is safer than other folders on the disk.\nOther folders in your user domain are not protected in this way, and can be read or written by any process that you launch.\nIt comes at the cost of a significant annoyance factor and user tendency to click \"Yeah, yeah, yeah\" whenever they see it, which somewhat reduces its efficacy.\nNormally, we expect apps to be able to read and write our files. If MS Word couldn't read .docx files, and couldn't save them either, then the app would be useless.\nYou can reasonably expect commercial applications not to rifle through your correspondence in the hope of finding and transmitting something of use or value. The discovery of such a practice would lead to customers abandoning the app, and likely legal proceedings. (Unless you've agreed that the company can scan your data, as with Gmail and Google docs.)\nThe best way to secure your data is by encrypting your disk with FileVault, using strong passwords on the user account at login and wake from sleep, and by following good practice for safe computing, e.g. not downloading anything from dodgy sites, or when told 'you need to install Flash' etc.\n\nA: Yes, this is a potential problem. If both a tax program and a word processor use your Documents folder, the word processor could theoretically send your tax returns back to its vendor.\nThis is a price we pay for keeping things simple. Ideally you could have separate folders for each application, and they couldn't access each others' documents.\nBut what Apple has done is still better than earlier versions. Previously, there was no application-level protection at all for the Documents folder. Any application you ran could access it, even if it didn't need to read or write documents. Now you're at least required to approve whether an app can do this.\nIf you only install applications from the App Store, you should be able to trust them not to access documents inappropriately. Apple reviews all applications before making them available on the App Store, and this is the kind of thing they will check for. Of course, the world isn't perfect and they could miss something, but you can only be so paranoid. And of course, you have to trust Apple in general -- if you worry about them being malicious, you shouldn't use their operating systems, since it could steal any of your data.\nI wouldn't be surprised if Apple is planning on more fine-grained permissions in the future, and this is just the first step in that path.\n", "Q: Determining/associating the log subsystem for apps installed via package managers I've watched this highly informative talk on the unified logs and been reading whatever documentation or blog posts I can find on the subject, but I haven't found or don't understand how to link an app (for example, an SSHD server) that has been installed via, say Macports or pkgsrc, to a subsystem.\nIs it something the developer has to specify within the code? I use launchctl plists quite often, is it something I can add there? (the man page has nothing on it, same goes for the log man page)\nIf I list the files in /System/Library/Preferences/Logging/Subsystems/ and /Library/Preferences/Logging/Subsystems/ there's a lot of plists that Apple call \"logging profiles\". The /Library/… one has com.openssh.sshd.plist with these contents:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>DEFAULT-OPTIONS</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>Level</key>\n        <dict>\n            <key>Enable</key>\n            <string>default</string>\n        </dict>\n    </dict>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nI can't see if this applies to:\n\n*\n\n*only the SSHD supplied by Apple in /usr/sbin/sshd\n\n*any SSHD run on the machine\n\n*the sshd entry in /etc/services\n\n*something else…\n\nPerhaps I can write a logging profile and place it in there for apps I install? Are apps automatically placed in subsystems because of system resources they ask for? I'm just not sure.\nSorry if the question is confusing, it's because I'm confused! Any help or insight given will be much appreciated.\nNote: The system I'm currently on is 10.14 but I'm asking in a general way as I know the unified logs came in after 10.10 and (as the talk points out) there are slight differences even between OS minor versions.\n\nA: The subject here are the configuration files for Apple's Unified Logging system - in particular for subsystems.\nYes, the subsystem is something the developer can specify in their code. A developer that uses Unified Logging on macOS commonly do so by calling into the OSLog class on macOS 10.x, or the Logger class on macOS 11.x. When initialising an instance of the class, the developer can provide the subsystem as a string - which is recommended to be in the reverse DNS notation (i.e. com.openssh.sshd for example).\nThe developer is free to create multiple subsystems for various parts of the program, so you could in theory have \"com.openssh.sshd.authentication\" and \"com.openssh.sshd.network\" subsystems.\nThe developer can also choose not to specify a subsystem at all - and just log something. This is typically what happens with developers that did not take Unified Logging into account. In that case macOS supplies a default subsystem name - in general this is the bundle identifier for the app.\n", "Q: How can I disable or enable keyboard input source?

I want to connect it to a bigger display. Right now I am considering to buy an LG 27UK850-W 4K 27 inch Monitor (resolution 3840x2160) which has HDMI, USB-C, DisplayPort and USB Downstream Port.\nCan I connect my MacBook and the monitor with the following connections:\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Air -> Thunderbolt 2 Cable -> Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 adapter -> LG 27UK850-W 4K Monitor\n\n\n*MacBook Air -> USB-A to HDMI adapter -> HDMI -> LG 27UK850-W 4K Monitor\nWould there be any limitations with the display quality? Which one is the best way to connect the devices or do you have any other suggestions?\n\nA: I wouldn't recommend any of those. Instead get an ordinary mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable and connect the monitor with a plain cable instead of adapters.\nThe 2015 MacBook Air cannot be charged over the USB-C port in any case, so you cannot benefit from that feature of the monitor right now. However in the future you might have a newer computer, and then the USB-C port with Power Delivery might come in handy.\n\nA: The LG 27UK850-W is not a Thunderbolt monitor. It expects a DisplayPort alt-mode signal from its USB-C port, so proposal #1 definitely won't work. While the Thunderbolt 2 port in the MacBook Air natively supports mini DP output, as soon as you connect it to Apple's Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 adapter, the signal coming out of the other end is purely Thunderbolt.\nWith the second proposal, it will work but is not ideal. USB-A display adapters typically rely on a tech known as DisplayLink, which is what enables USB to output a video signal. Not all adapters support your monitor's native resolution and refresh rate, so if you were to go this route, best to carefully check the adapter's maximum supported display mode. Some adapters top out at 3840x2160 @ 30 Hz, which is fine for watching movies, but will feel noticeably laggy with basically any other task.\nAs @jksoegaard has said, getting a regular Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable will be the best option, cost and image quality considered. Is there any particular reason why you are considering your proposed approaches?\n\nA: Whenever I post an answer regarding video, I usually corrected by some other user. Lets see how far I get this time.\neverymac.com states the following for a MacBook Air \"Core i5\" 1.6 13\" (Early 2015):\n\n\n\n\n2nd Display\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport:\nDual/Mirroring*\n\n\nMax. Resolution:\n3840x2160 (4K)*\n\n\nDetails:\n*Although Apple originally only reported that this model could support a single external display up to 2560x1600, third-parties discovered that it actually could support a 3840x2160 (4K) display, and Apple subsequently revised their official documentation to confirm this, as well.\n\n\n\n\nApples Technical Specifications states for MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015):\nGraphics and Video Support\n\n*\n\n*Intel HD Graphics 6000\n\n\n*Dual display and video mirroring: Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 3840 by 2160 pixels on an external display, both at millions of colors.\n\n\n*Thunderbolt digital video output\n◦  Native Mini DisplayPort output\n◦  DVI output using Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter (sold separately)\n◦  VGA output using Mini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter (sold separately)\n◦  Dual-link DVI output using Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter (sold separately)\n◦  HDMI audio and video output using third-party Mini DisplayPort to HDMI Adapter (sold separately)\nAccording to DisplayPort.org, \"4K Ultra HD refers to 3840 x 2160 pixels\".\nI assume then you would probably what a mini DisplayPort to 4K HDMI adapter (or cable) and monitor with HDMI input and at least 4K resolution.\nI believe the fact that the Mac's mini DisplayPort can also do Thunderbolt 2 is not really relevant in this case.\n", "Q: Unity: How can I run Unity builds created in High Sierra & Verify they run on Mojave without a Mojave computer? I have Unity 2020.3.0f1 Mac apps that were created on end-of-life High Sierra computers. I recently purchased a Mac Mini M1 computer. The apps run on both computers. I have to execute a terminal command on them to get them to open on the M1 computer.\nApple changed the App Store Upload process so that now we have to notarize that new apps will run on Mojave.

I'm using Catalina on an formatted APFS SSD and am finding a correct way to backup the OS. In the plugged in external HDD, I create a backup volume with APFS format using Disk Utility. But when I choose it as the backup volume in Time Machine, Time Machine requires the volume have to be erased. I did it and then go to Disk Utility to check, the volume is now formatted as Mac OS Extended (Journaled).\nShould I continue to use it? Will it occur any problems when I make a restore from backups on a Mac OS Extended (Journaled) to an APFS SSD? Thanks for any help.\n\nA: Time Machine in Catalina only supports HFS+ as a destination volume.  The first macOS that supports APFS as a destination volume is Big Sur.\nref:\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/types-of-disks-you-can-use-with-time-machine-mh15139/10.15/mac/10.15\nvs:\nhttps://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/types-of-disks-you-can-use-with-time-machine-mh15139/11.0/mac/11.0\n\nA: While, in general, APFS is better suited for SSD disks and HFS+ (macOS Extended) is better suited for rotational media due to their respective statistical access patterns and ensuing consequences for seek time and flash wear, either format could in principle be used for backup purposes if Time Machine has enabled support for it in a given macOS release. In theory*, restoring from an HFS+ to an APFS volume (or vice versa) should present no problem, as the file copy is done at a higher abstraction layer in the call stack that is agnostic to the underlying storage format. Neither format has inherent limitations that would prevent it from being used as a TM backup and it's merely a question of application (i.e., Time Machine) support. Refer to Marc Wilson's insightful answer for details on which macOS version has enabled support for which formats.\n* — The difference between theory and practice is that, in theory, there is no difference between theory and practice, and in practice, there is.\n", "Q: Tell if running process is running under Rosetta or is M1-native by Command Line If you have an M1-based Macbook you can tell if a process running on the machine is Apple/M1 or Intel/Rosetta in Activity Monitor, but is there a way to get this information on the command line?\nI'd like to be able to quickly show a count of how many Intel processes are currently running on my machine under Rosetta.\n\n\nA: Here is some snippet to check all Rosetta 2 pids and inspect them:\nps -p `fuser /usr/libexec/rosetta/runtime | sed -e 's/.*: //' | sed -e 's/ /,/g'`\n\n\nA: This actually can be done with AppleScript if you know the PID of the process:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to return architecture of processes whose unix id is 758'\n\n\nA: TL,DR: fuser /usr/libexec/rosetta/runtime\nI know how to see which processes are non-native.

In all versions of macOS and OS X I have access to from Mountain Lion to Big Sur, I can access the resource fork of any file or directory using the current syntax in the terminal:\nfilename/..namedfork/rsrc\n\nI know that at some point this syntax replaced the previous syntax which was:\nfilename/rsrc\n\nBut I don't know when the change happened. I assume it was when the little known Named Forks feature was introduced. Apparently you could access any named fork in this era thus:\nfilename/..namedfork/myfork\n\nThese days the latter two syntaxes do not work. No fork other than the resource fork is accessible, though the method to access it is the one that was originally due to named forks.\nNamed forks were introduced with HFS+ in 1988 with version 8.1 of the OS. Named forks were deprecated in 2013 with version 10.9, Mavericks.\nThe odd thing is that on my Mountain Lion machine, which was before named forks were deprecated, I can't access named forks, only the resource fork. Attempting to use the file/..namedfork/forkname where forkname is anything other than rsrc results in the Not a directory error.\nThis means that this method for accessing named forks went away before named forks were officially deprecated.\nDoes anybody know the history of when file/rsrc was introduced, when it was replaced with file/..namedfork/rsrc, and when file/..namedfork/anyotherforkname stopped working?\n\nA: According to Wikipedia:\n\nFrom the POSIX interface, the resource fork could be accessed as\nfilename/..namedfork/rsrc or as filename/rsrc; the shorter form\nwas deprecated in Mac OS X v10.4 and removed completely in Mac OS X\nv10.7.\n\nIt cites an archived Apple developer document.\n10.7 is Lion, of course.\n", "Q: Sound Gone on Macbook Pro Retina 15\" late 2014 running MacOS Big Sur 11.3 Beta A few weeks ago, the sound on my  Mac just died.

Both were running on Big Sur. All my music files are on an external drive and I have always used iTunes/Music with the 'keep music media folder organised' option ticked.\nIn ~/Music/Music/ on your old laptop you should have something similar to this:\nMusic\n├── Media.localized\n│   └── Automatically\\ Add\\ to\\ Music.localized\n└── Music\\ Library.musiclibrary\n    ├── Application.musicdb\n    ├── Extras.itdb\n    ├── Genius.itdb\n    ├── Library\\ Preferences.musicdb\n    ├── Library.musicdb\n    ├── Preferences.plist\n    └── sentinel\n\n3 directories, 7 files\n\nCopy all the files from the  ~/Music/Music/ directory from the old Mac on to the new one (be sure to create a backup of the original directory on the new Mac before overwriting any files).\nEnsure that the Music Media folder location in Music (Preferences > Files) is pointing to the correct location - do this before the next step (I'm not sure if relevant or not but I happened to do it in this order). Save and quit Music.\nReopen Music, holding down the option key as you open it. Browse to the ~/Music/Music/ directory and choose Music Library.musiclibrary. This opened up with all my playlists, album artworks, play counts etc. from my old Mac intact.\nNote - only follow these instructions if you are transferring your Music library to a completely empty one!!\n\nA: I'm not sure why the instructions refer to the 'Automatically Add to iTunes' folder. This shouldn't be necessary, so long as your old & new users have the same name & you always used default settings for iTunes.\nYour previous library must be consolidated before you do this - that ensures all necessary data/tunes are in that folder structure & not scattered elsewhere. iTunes should do this by default. In prefs > Advanced, the boxes for 'Keep iTunes Media folder organised' and 'Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library' should be checked. If they aren't, you need to manually consolidate, from the File menu > Library >\nThen all you need to do is copy the entire iTunes folder to the new Mac.\nIf there was no existing structure, ie if the account hasn't yet launched iTunes, then it should immediately see & use the new data. This should show in the folder location in the advanced tab.\n\nA: TLDR; To move a Music library from one Mac to another, copy the contents of the ~/Music folder on the old Mac to the same location on the new Mac, and hold down ⌥ option while opening the Music app on the new machine, where you can select the library you just copied.\n", "Q: Enable sudoing for the logged-in user for one specific prefpane only?

The upgrade appears to complete successfully, but at the login screen, when I click an account and enter the password, I briefly see a beach ball, then an interminably spinning \"wheel\" below the account name/pic like this.\n\n\n\nI have tried various workarounds to no avail, including:\n\n*\n\n*Force shutdown and boot again\n\n*Safe boot\n\n*Boot to recovery mode, run Disk Utility and run First Aid on the internal disk and Macintosh HD and Macintosh HD - Data partitions. Confirmed permissions on user directories /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/*username* appeared correct.\n\n*Enter password, then hold Option key while clicking login button (instead of pressing  Enter  key); tried in both normal and safe boot modes.\n\n*Boot to recovery mode, delete /Volumes/Macintosh HD/var/db/.AppleSetupDone and reboot.

We've been using NoMAD and NoMAD Login at least as far back as High Sierra, so I don't think that's the trouble... Also, apparently NoMAD Login isn't loading. At the login screen, I see the Big Sur login screen, not the NoMAD Login screen. I would appreciate any tips/suggestions for other possible steps. I'd rather not wipe/format and clean install Big Sur if I can avoid that.\nI managed to gain ssh access to the normally-booted system. I have an Apple Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter connected to the MacBook. The system wasn't connecting to the network (no associated DHCP lease) when booting normally, but it was connected when in recovery mode. I found if I boot the system normally, enter my password, press/hold Option and click the button to login (not sure if this is necessary), the wired network comes up and I can ssh to the machine using an administrator account. I was hoping to add another (admin) account this way, but if I try sudo [some command], the session hangs and doesn't prompt me for a password. I was able to use this method of access to reset the administrator's password, but this made no difference. Without a functioning sudo, I don't think there's a way to create a new administrator account...\nAfter backing up critical data, I abandoned efforts to resolve the post-upgrade trouble, booted to recovery mode, used Disk Utility to delete the volume set and the Reinstall macOS Big Sur option to do a clean install.

I recently purchased an Apple Watch with the Milanese Loop band and have been struggling with the band loosening over the course of the day. Multiple times an hour I need to re-adjust the magnetic clasp. Googling for milanese loop band slipping shows a lot of other people having similar problems, but no clear answers.\nHow do I stop my Milanese Loop band from slipping?\n\nA: I was surprised at just how bad the Milanese Loop band was at staying fastened, and couldn't explain why some people were having problems and others weren't.\nReversing the band solved the problem for me.\nThe band is reversible, in the sense that the side that is fixed and the side that is looped can be swapped. If you're having trouble with slippage, try swapping the two sides using these instructions\n\nThis significantly reduced slippage for me and made the band much more pleasant to use. I almost never think about slippage anymore.\nThe reason this works (I believe) is because of the way our forearms are constructed. When we rotate our wrist, the ulna on the bottom stays relatively fixed and the radius rotates around it, causing more motion on the top side of our wrist (by our thumbs) than on the bottom. Moving the fixed band to the motion side decreases the tension on the loop, reducing the chance of slippage.\n", "Q: Secondary click does not register even though it is checked on (MacOS Big Sur) So I just updated to macOS Big Sur from Mojave.

What exactly is System Events now?\nWhat I definitely know is that there is it an app and that is /System/Library/ CoreServices/System\\ Events.app.\n\nA: System Events is a faceless background app provided by Apple that gives AppleScript access to certain system functions and attributes. For example, we can use the app to change the desktop picture, control the user interface of other applications, change the screen saver, navigate the file system hierarchy, and more. Open Script Editor, choose File➔Open Dictionary..., and choose System Events from the list of apps. This will show you the AppleScript commands you can invoke.\n", "Q: Is it possible to keep Whatsapp from saving *outgoing* sent videos to Camera Roll?

System Integrity Protection from Apple protects very important parts of the system and is, in my opinion, the main reason a Mac is so secure.\nThat's why I ask myself the question whenever I boot Linux or Windows, for example, on a different volume. Can Windows, for example, then change something in the area of e.g. / system or does the system integrity protection also protect there?\nThe same question also with disk mode. Is the Mac protected by the SIP if it is used as a hard drive by another Mac?\n\nA: No, System Integrity Protection is not active when you are running other operating systems or when you mount the hard drive in another computer.\nThere are other protection mechanisms (such as Secure Boot and T2 disk encryption) on modern Macs that protect your system from booting \"malicious\" (i.e. infected) operating systems, and from the disk being simply mounted on a different computer.\n", "Q: Can you monitor a folder for changes?

See Launch Daemons and Agents.\n\n*Create an AppleScript application that uses AppleScriptObjC to receive notifications for file system changes. I can add an example of that if you think it's necessary, though I'd recommend using one of the others for most cases.\n\nI suppose something could be done using syslog, but it seems like a lot more work than the approaches I mentioned.\n", "Q: FaceTime on macOS cannot connect to camera, but all other apps can MBP 13\" 2017, macOS 10.15.7, FaceTime 5.0\nAfter about 10 seconds of trying it pops up the message below:\n\nRestarting my computer does fix the problem.

Current power mode configuration of any Mac can be displayed with pmset -g command, and this command's output does not include a hibernatemode entry. I try to enable hibernation with sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25 where 25 indicates power-off hibernation. Unfortunately this doesn't power the device off because the power light is still on when I put the device to sleep. Curiously enough, running pmset -g again still does not include a hibernatemode entry.\nIs hibernation removed in new M1 Macs or macOS Big Sur? If not, what is the correct way to enable it?\n\nA: Hibernation on Mac m1 just released yesterday. Just update your mac to MacOS Big Sur 11.3 to enable hibernation.\nYou can see the change log here:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211896\nto enable it you can use this command:\nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25\n\njust for your information based on man pmset\nSAFE SLEEP ARGUMENTS\n     hibernatemode supports values of 0, 3, or 25. Whether or not a hibernation image gets written is also dependent on the values of standby\n     and autopoweroff\n\n     For example, on desktops that support standby a hibernation image will be written after the specified standbydelay time. To disable\n     hibernation images completely, ensure hibernatemode standby and autopoweroff are all set to 0.\n\n     hibernatemode = 0 by default on desktops. The system will not back memory up to persistent storage. The system must wake from the\n     contents of memory; the system will lose context on power loss. This is, historically, plain old sleep.\n\n     hibernatemode = 3 by default on portables. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will power memory\n     during sleep. The system will wake from memory, unless a power loss forces it to restore from hibernate image.\n\n     hibernatemode = 25 is only settable via pmset. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will remove\n     power to memory. The system will restore from disk image. If you want \"hibernation\" - slower sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery\n     life, you should use this setting.\n\n     Please note that hibernatefile may only point to a file located on the root volume.\n\nSo by default, the hibernate mode for a MacBook is 3, other device(imac, mac mini) is 0.\nActually, 3 is safe mode and uses very low energy also wake up faster, my MacBook can live for weeks just using this mode.

I changed default behaviour of F-keys to normal F1, F2, etc. So in order to activate 'media' keys like volume up/down I need to press Fn+F-key. Now, what I've realised is that pressing Fn with F1, F2, etc sometimes (50/50 chance) changes the keyboard layout as well! God, it is so annoying. It shouldn't be so 100%. I think that's just a bug. So, how can I disable Fn for changing my keyboard layout?\n\nA: This new feature of MacOS Big Sur can be turned off by unchecking a box in System Preferences > Keyboard.\n\nA: For people using Mac os Ventura, to deactivate the effects and FN keys,\nGo to system settings and keyboard shortcuts.\n\nGo to the function keys and activate the toggle like the image below.\n\nNow go to the Mission Control tab and uncheck the F keys\n\nSo it's done now you can use the regular fn keys.\n\nA: I felt a screenshot may be helpful here.

I've gotten to grips with the chflags man page so far, even if it's rather uncommon for man pages. Nevertheless, I find 2 parameters very peculiar. What exactly does chflags opaque and nodump do?\nManpage\n\nhttps://ss64.com/osx/chflags.html\n\n\nA: The nodump file flag can still be used by macOS. Apparently, the opaque file flag has never been used by macOS or OS X since at least Snow Leopard.\n\nHere is an example of the use of the nodump file flag.\nBelow is the output from the command ls -lO hi.txt bye.txt. Note bye.txt has the nodump flag.\n-rw-r--r--  1 davidanderson  staff  nodump 8 Mar 20 12:13 bye.txt\n-rw-r--r--  1 davidanderson  staff  -      9 Mar 20 12:13 hi.txt\n\nNext, the command tar --nodump -cf mytarball hi.txt bye.txt is executed to create the archive file mytarball. Afterwards, if the command tar -tvf mytarball is entered, the contents of the archive will be printed. Below is the output.\n-rw-r--r--  0 davidanderson staff       9 Mar 20 12:13 hi.txt\n\nNote that the file bye.txt was omitted from the archive because of the nodump flag.\n\nHere is an example of the use of the opaque file flag.\n\nWhile I can provide an example, the example will not work with macOS. Instead the example will use the current version of FreeBSD.\n\nThe macOS operating system is derived from parts of BSD Unix. BSD implements two forms of unioning: the -o union option to the mount command and the mount_unionfs command. When testing various versions of OS X and macOS, I found Snow Leopard does implement the -o union option, while High Sierra and Big Sur ignore this option. All three versions do not include the mount_unionfs command. AFAIK, the opaque file flag is only used by this latter form of unioning. So to provide an example, I will turn to FreeBSD, which does include the mount_unionfs command.\n\nThe basic idea here is to allow modifications to be made to a read-only mount. In the following example, I will remove a directory containing a file, then create a new empty directory with the same name.\n\nIn this example, I have a DVD with two directories named dog and cat. The directory dog contains the file poodle and the directory cat contains the file siamese. After putting the DVD in the optical drive, I entered the following commands as root user to mount the DVD and view the contents. The current directory is the root user's home directory /root.\nmkdir pets\nmount -t cd9660 /dev/cd0 pets\nls -lRFo pets\n\nBelow is the sample output.\n\nTo allow modifications, I created and mounted the empty directory changes using the -t unionfs option. Also, I printed out the mounts to pets. The mount command actually uses the mount_unionfs command to perform the mount.\nmkdir changes\nmount -t unionfs changes pets\nmount | grep pets\n\nBelow is sample output.\n\nNext, I used the commands below remove the directory named dog and confirm the change.\nrm -fr pets/dog\nls -lRFo pets\nls -lRFo changes\n\nBelow is a sample output. Note that the directory dog no longer appears in directory pets. Also, the directory changes appears to have only gained the empty directory cat.\n\nHowever, a whiteout named dog was added to the directory changes and thus the directory pets. To see the whiteout, the -W option needs to be added to the ls command, as shown below.\nls -lRFoW pets\nls -lRFoW changes\n\nBelow is a sample output.\n\nThe whiteout dog masks the directory dog on the DVD. Next, I used the commands below to create a new empty directory named dog and show the changes.\nmkdir pets/dog\nls -lRFoW pets\nls -lRFoW changes\n\nBelow is a sample output.\n\nHere, the whiteout dog was replaced by the directory dog with the opaque file flag set. This directory masks the directory dog on the DVD. To demonstrate the need for the opaque file flag, I used the commands shown below to remove the opaque file flag and show the results.\nchflags noopaque changes/dog\nls -lRFoW pets\nls -lRFoW changes\n\nBelow is a sample output.\n\nWithout the opaque file flag, the file poodle incorrectly appears in the pets/dog directory.\nThe final commands below just undo all the mounts and changes made in this example.\numount pets\numount pets\nls -lRFoW pets\nls -lRFoW changes\nrmdir pets\nrm -fr changes\n\nBelow is a sample output.\n\n\nReferences\nUnioning file systems: Architecture, features, and design choices\nUnion file systems: Implementations, part I\nWikipedia: macOS\nUnionfs: document reasons for opaque directories\nFreeBSD ls command\nFreeBSD mount command\nFreeBSD mount_unionfs command\nNote: FreeBSD was executed by first downloading the virtual machine ready file named FreeBSD-12.2-RELEASE-amd64.vmdk.xz. This file was used to create a VirtualBox virtual machine with a 2013 iMac as host. This file should also be compatible with VMware Fusion Player.\n\nA: Short answer: nothing particularly relevant on modern macOS.\nLong answer: both of these flags relate to Unix features that you probably never use.\n\n*\n\n*The opaque flag relates to \"union mounts\" -- mounting one filesystem over another, so that you can see the files and folders of both mixed together in (what appears to be) a single folder tree. Setting the opaque flag on a folder makes it... well, opaque, so if there's also a folder by the same name in the other filesystem, you won't see its contents merged in. Union mounts don't seem to work at all in recent versions of macOS, making this flag completely irrelevant.\n\n\n*The nodump flag tells the dump program (a backup utility) that the item doesn't need to be backed up. macOS doesn't even include the dump program (though you could probably add it through homebrew or something). You can tell the tar program to skip nodump files with its --nodump options, and I suppose other backup programs could also take this as a \"don't back up\" flag, but I don't know of any that do this. So again this is pretty irrelevant on macOS.\n\nA: They are POSIX standard flags defined in stat.h and any unix program can read them with the stat call and the system writes and removes them in a standard pattern for compatibility with the dump and unionfs functionality.\n/*\n * Definitions of flags stored in file flags word.\n *\n * Super-user and owner changeable flags.\n */\n#define UF_SETTABLE 0x0000ffff  /* mask of owner changeable flags */\n#define UF_NODUMP   0x00000001  /* do not dump file */\n#define UF_IMMUTABLE    0x00000002  /* file may not be changed */\n#define UF_APPEND   0x00000004  /* writes to file may only append */\n#define UF_OPAQUE   0x00000008  /* directory is opaque wrt. union */\n/*\n\n", "Q: How to move Preview window to other desktop in MacOS?

Finally, I have downloaded TG Pro which has solved the fan issue but the Kernel task is still eating up CPU even though the CPU temp is around 45 degrees. Any clues?\n\n\n\nA: All signs point to your system that measures temperature is out of spec or failing/failed. It’s also likely software is piling on, adding legitimate load to the kernel, making the issue worse.\n\nOne SMC reset a month is too often to cure any physical defect. Second and third resets too quickly won’t help you.\n\nA single SMC reset cures a wrong state measurement if that’s\nthe cause of an issue. You won’t have to do that again for months on functional hardware in my experience.\nSadly, the cost to diagnose and fix a main board is high so most people do the swap as Apple recommended if you can’t live with the system design to let kernel task protect the system.\n\nToo high CPU is a judgement / budgetary call on how much you value your time and not so much a technical issue.\n\nThe system does what it’s designed to do based on measurements. Worse, installing software to track temperature moment to moment can put enough load on a system to cause CPU spikes and add legitimate work kernel_task now has to perform while its stalling - simply observing the system can change it. You might have to remove all modifications to tell if your software is the cause here.\nTo test a clean system you need a cheap USB drive that holds 32 GB and network that can download about 15 GB of data from Apple. You can do the test faster with fast internet and speedy external storage, but a weekend and cheap parts, slow internet is all that’s needed to run a clean new OS to validate your SMC and kernel_task isn’t a software issue.\n", "Q: Why do I get this message every time I open the terminal?

Is there any app,\nThat iCloud notes can sync to ?\nI wanted to have a backup of my iCloud notes\nI know iCloud is already supposed to be a backup, but I have heard of people having problems or notes being deleted out of nowhere, so that's why I wanted another kind of backup\nThat could sync to iCloud so I could keep my notes on iCloud, plus somewhere else\nDoes such a thing exist ?\nThank you.\n\nA: Firstly iCloud is not a backup.  It is a synchronisation tool.  Hence the problems you have heard about with notes being accidentally deleted and then gone for ever.\nSo you need a backup.\nBut this is not so easy because the notes in Apple Notes are stored in a database and not as separate files.\nOne solution is to periodically export your notes out of Apple Notes into separate files in another format and store them somewhere included in your regular backups.  For this get the app Exporter from the Mac App Store.  But this is a one way operation - the only way to import into Apple Notes is by copy and paste of text.\nThe problem you have highlighted is in common with other popular note taking applications (e.g. Bear) which store notes in a database and synchronise with iCloud.  Backup is not straightforward.\nFor myself, I have given up using apple Notes for anything I want to keep.  I now use Typora and have learnt to use markdown for formatting.  Each note is a separate file and backups become easier to manage.  But I have lost Notes' ease of use and synchronisation to iPhone.\nEdit:\nIt is possible to recover lost or accidentally deleted notes.\nThe Apple Notes database (and other stuff) is located in ~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.notes.  This is part of the Time Machine backup.  So there is potential to recover lost notes by using the content of that folder from a Time Machine backup.\nHere is a process which I tested and works:\n\n*\n\n*Delete an unimportant note (to simulate the loss of an important note!),\n\n*Exit Notes,\n\n*Remove Notes from iCloud (in System Preferences - Internet Accounts),\n\n*Recover the folder from Time Machine using drag and drop in Finder,\n\n*Start Notes.\n\nNotes shows all the notes that were present at the point in time when the TM backup was done.  But it is not connected to iCloud and so can't merge the recovered database with any differences in iCloud.\nNow:\n\n*\n\n*In Notes, move the recovered note from iCloud folder to the \"On My Mac\" folder,\n\n*Exit Notes,\n\n*Reconnect Apple Notes to iCloud (in System Preferences - Internet Accounts),\n\n*Start Notes.\n\nNotes merges Notes' iCloud folder with the content on iCloud, but leaves alone the recovered note which is in \"On My Mac\".  If desired this can be moved back into one of Notes' iCloud folders.\nThis is not a straight forward process and is open to error and the risk of losing all notes.  But it is possible if you need to recover an important note.\n", "Q: Open Zoom meeting email link (URL) on iPad Air I am not a regular iPad user.

On launch pmd will attempt to set up networking and advertise its services.\nTry restarting pmd and seeing if this restores the connection. This is not a solution but an experiment.\nDefault macOS\n\nPotentially relevant actions: I replaced /var/db/dslocal from an earlier backup due to slow login, and the issue disappears. However, I think data inconsistency might still be present but hidden because I only restored some but not all of the system preferences/data. I don't have time (yet) to do a clean reinstall.\n\nGiven the above and that Power Manager previously worked, it suggests the replacement of /var/db/dslocal may be the cause of the problem.\nThe best solution is to install a clean copy of macOS.\nRemoval and Reinstall\nWe do not recommend running Power Manager without the supporting agents and applications. Doing so means no warnings, no user interface, and many events will not perform as expected. The agents use the same mechanism as the application to talk to each other; if the application encounters disrupted connections, so will the assisting agents.\nYou can easily remove Power Manager. If you then want to try again, you can re-install using the packaged edition. This will ensure Power Manager is correctly installed.\n", "Q: How to preview what Time Machine would back up? I'd like to preview what Time Machine backup would back up if it did a full backup. The UI shows that the backup will be 300 GB but I'd like to understand better what folders contribute to it.\n\nDetails:\nI use Time Machine with several ignore rules that come from several \"sources\":\n\n*\n\n*I ignore some folders manually via Time Machine preferences (the \"Options...\" button at the bottom of the settings dialog). Those are persisted in /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist.\n\n*I use tmignore to automatically exclude node_modules and other things I have in my .gitignore files. (Folders excluded this way can be listed via tmignore list.)\n\n*Apps can add their own exclude rules, which can be seen by running this command (I'm not 100% sure if it lists everything but that's the command I've used in the past):\nsudo mdfind \"com_apple_backup_excludeItem = 'com.apple.backupd'\"\n\nSo I have at least some ways to list ignored files, even though it's not very pleasant that I have to combine several methods.\nBut even better would be to positively list the files / folder that would be backed up. Those 300 GB most likely contains something that one of the methods above forgot to ignore and I'd like to see what's the biggest contributor to this size. (I used to have a full backup around 100 GB, so there's additional 200 GB hiding somewhere.)\nSolution on a terminal is fine, but if there is a GUI app that would visualize that, even better.\n\nA: Open System Preferences. Tap on the Time Machine option. After having enabled Time Machine and chosen a backup disk, click Options. Click + to define an item that is not to be backed up.\n", "Q: Name change in group thread I have a running group text thread with my 3 sisters.  From time to time instead of one of my sister’s name at the top, it will say her daughter or son’s name.  We’re suspecting that her daughter is somehow hacking into her phone, because they are on the same iCloud.  Is that possible and if so, how can we fix it?\n\nA: You have to be very careful in this situation.\nAny one of the participants in the group can have an address book entry that is wrong and send the messages incorrectly when adjusting group membership.\nThere is zero need for foul play here. First apply Hanlon's razor (Occam’s razor applied to people and technology) and substitute “stupidity” with “people are busy and don’t meticulously track which AppleID they use to sign in to their devices. People want to share purchases and don’t set up proper family sharing and separate their accounts between Messages and the App Store or effectively and regularly audit who logs in to their accounts.”\nCompound that confusion on three to six devices per person and three to six people, and you can end up with an intractable mess when one name maps to a different AppleID that has multiple SMS and emails attached for delivery.\nBack to your specific situation, are you sure the name of your sister’s children maps to a Message account or SMS number they access?\n", "Q: How to continue Time Machine backups from a previous computer? I had MBP 2015 in the past and used Time Machine on it. Last September, I switched to MBP 16'' 2019 and did a fresh installation / manual copy of most of my home directory files, maintaining the layout.\n\nNote: I wanted to do a fresh installation for various reasons but if I were to compare the filesystems in the end, they are almost the same – my home directory is still /Users/borekb, the folder layout under it is exactly the same, etc.\n\nNow I'm trying to set up Time Machine again but I'd like to continue with my previous line of backups – for example, I want to see last year's versions of files that are on the same path. Also, my first backup on this new Mac should be \"incremental\" – I'd like Time Machine to compare what is on my current Mac with the latest state of my previous backups (from September 2020) and does a diff as usual.\nThe key to this seems to be the tmutil inheritbackup command, which I've successfully ran:\n$ sudo tmutil inheritbackup /Volumes/time-machine/Borek’s\\ MacBook\\ Pro.backupbundle\nPassword:\nMounting disk image...\nUnmounting disk image...\nInheriting disk image for machine...\nSuccessfully inherited disk image '/Volumes/time-machine/Borek’s MBP 16.backupbundle'\n\n/Volumes/time-machine is a mounted network folder (I backup wirelessly to a Synology NAS) and the command seemed to work well – it did this rename:\nBorek’s MacBook Pro.backupbundle → Borek’s MBP 16.backupbundle\nI then went to Time Machine UI, selected the time-machine disk, entered my previous password for encryption, etc.:\n\nEverything seemed fine so far.\nHowever, when I start backing up, it does a full initial backup to a new folder inside the .backupbundle that is called after my new computer's name: Borek’s MBP 16. This is what it looks like after I mount the sparse bundle and browse the /Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb folder:\n\nI somehow want to tell Time Machine keep using the original Borek’s MacBook Pro folder (the one that was last modified on 22 Sep 2020).\nHow to do that?\n\nUPDATE 1: I tried changing my computer's name to match the old one but Time Machine still insists on creating a new set of backups from scratch – it just calls the new \"machine directory\" Borek’s MacBook Pro 2:\n\nI have also ran this script, found here (as Big Sur doesn't seem to support -a), to run tmutil associatedisk an all folders found under the original backup location:\nfor f in /Volumes/Time\\ Machine\\ Backups/Backups.backupdb/Borek’s\\ MacBook\\ Pro/*; do\n  if [[ -d \"$f\" ]]; then\n    sudo tmutil associatedisk /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD \"$f\"/Macintosh\\ HD;\n  fi;\ndone\n\nThis also worked correctly but Time Machine still doesn't see my older backups and is attempting to create Borek’s MacBook Pro 2 when I try to run a backup.\n\nUPDATE 2: I've successfully verified backups which was a solution in this answer. The preferences UI still report \"no backups\" so I'm now trying to run a new backup, which was Step 2 in that answer and the author wasn't sure if it's necessary or not. I'll report back in a few hours...\n\nA: If you tap the option key while clicking the time machine icon in the menu bar, you can browse backups from previous or other computers.\n", "Q: Homepod Mini \"no peer to peer\" warning Seeking some resolution with a Homepod Mini. Recently replaced our 11+ year old router with a Linksys WRT3200 ACM dual-band model, running OpenWRT. After initial setup everything on the network connected immediately, including the Homepod. Unfortunately this didn't last long. Homepod is now showing as unavailable in AirPlay from any iOS device. It shows in the Home app and if touched there will display comnnectivity, settings, etc. but lists \"controls are unavailable\". The device is clearly on network - it shows as connected from the router interface, responds immediately to ping, and appears as an available AirPlay option from my MacBook - if and only if I am connected to ethernet. Over wifi, it is unavailable.\nWhat's especially maddening is that the two Ikea-branded SONOS speakers we had prior to the Homepod show in AirPlay all the time and work immediately from all our devices. I can stream to our Roku devices via AirPlay as well. I simply can't use the Apple-branded speaker. I can't figure out what the issue might be.\nI've tried completely resetting the Homepod. I received a warning on setup that peer-to-peer communication was not available. I'm unclear why, as there's no setting in the router wifi config that makes me think mDNS is unavailable, and I have ensured the mDNSresponder package is installed on the router. The ONLY thing I can think might be an issue is that the Homepod is connected to the 5ghz radio (radio0) whereas the other AirPlay devices are on the 2.5ghz radio (radio1). Signal to noise ratio is consistently solid, it does not appear to be related to weak signal or interference. I've read that AirPlay can have issues crossing between radios in a dual-band setup, but my iPhone is on radio0 and plays through the SONOS speakers on radio1 just fine - and can communicate but can't PLAY to the Homepod also on radio0. If it's a cross-band issue I'd think the reverse would be true.\nI don't know if it is an OpenWRT issue or an Apple issue. I'm new to OpenWRT (was running TomatoUSB for years). It's frustrating that this single device seems to be the only one giving me any real trouble. Any suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nA: ...and just like that I found a solution. IGMP snooping wasn't enabled in the LAN bridge, so AirPlay packets were not being routed correctly between wired/wireless devices. I didn't even consider that the LAN settings would be part of the problem, as all devices involved were wireless. Unclear to me whether the mDNSresponder package is required for the router to make this work, but it's working now.\n\nA: I want to second the IGMP snooping solution to this.\n\ndr. Nixon is my hero, just bought a 2nd HomePod since they're being discontinued and I figured I should get one for stereo audio pair while they're still available. Couldn't get stereo pairing to work at all, I got the HomePods to tell me \"peer to peer\" wasn't available on my network and couldn't for the life of me figure out what I needed to change on my Ubiquiti network. This did the trick, stereo pair works now.\n\nA: dr.nixon's answer solved it for me too. Thanks a lot!\nMild caveat at least with unifi devices: Force provision all unifi devices, and REBOOT them. Without provision / reboot it did not work for me.\nIf you happen to also have issues with Thread, reboot your HomePods & AppleTVs after that. Thread was incredibly slow and unreliable for me before I did this.\n", "Q: Unable to install pgAdmin on MacOS Big Sur; possible verification problem So, I potentially have a stupid yet hopefully quick issue; I am attempting to install the latest version of pgAdmin onto my Macbook Pro with the M1 chip running Big Sur. When I attempt to open the installation package nothing happens and it refuses to open. I believe it may be a verification issue, but not 100% certain.\nDoes anyone know how to (preferably simply) resolve this?\n\nA: that program needs to install software in non standard locations.

Is there a quick and easy way to convert many HEIC files to png on macOS?\nExample\nSuppose we take some live photos on iPhone, airdrop them to MacBook, and we want to upload them to a site that only accepts .png files.\n\nI've noticed if you simply change the extension from .HEIC to .png (e.g. in the above image), then as far as I can tell, the image file is treated accordingly by programs and it 'works'.\nHowever, I guess the underlying file hasn't changed, so it could still contain live photo information (I think), which a normal png wouldn't have, which, in a worst case, could be a security risk or in less severe cases simply be an annoyance.\nWhat I know so far\nThe best I can do right now is go through the files one by one renaming them. I would really like to know what other solutions are available (via point and click and terminal), and have a strong preference for not having to download any external software.\n\nA: To convert all .HEIC images in a directory to .png\nOpen terminal. cd to the directory where the .HEIC files you want to convert are stored.\nBe careful, this will convert all .HEIC files in the directory - back them up first if you're not sure you want to do that just yet.\nfor f in *.HEIC\ndo sips -s format png \"${f}\" --out \"${f%.*}.png\"\ndone\n\nIf you want to convert and resize images\nThe following will convert and resize images so the maximum height and width is 400 pixels (but you can change 400 below to any value)\nBe careful, this will convert and resize all .HEIC files in the directory - back them up first if you're not sure you want to do that just yet.\nfor f in *.HEIC\ndo sips -s format png \"${f}\" -Z 400 --out \"${f%.*}.png\"\ndone\n\nReference\n\n*\n\n*sips documentation: https://ss64.com/osx/sips.html\nAdditional note\nTo convert from HEIC to jpeg, use the same code examples above but replace png with jpeg in 2 places, and you'll have jpeg instead.\n\nA: Use ImageMagick to produce JPGs that are the same quality as the the original HEIC files.\nI found @stevec's answer using sips produces very low resolution images that were basically useless for my purposes.

I've been on Android forever and am trying to switch, but am frustrated at nearly every turn. I've tried to take a Google Sheets document I had available on both sheets.google.com and my Android and move it to Numbers so I can use it both from my iPhone and the iCloud web interface. I've updated the formulas on the web interface and it functions just fine, but the iPhone won't see it. Can you help me? I think all the settings are correct to allow for syncing.\nNotes created on iCloud seem to sync just fine. Numbers documents do not. Why?\nIt's a fully-upgraded (as best I can tell) iPhone 12.\n\nA: In your iCloud Settings on your iPhone, System Preferences > Your Name > iCloud, there should be an option for Numbers (and Pages, and Keynote as well, if they're installed), which should be set to 'on'. The option is likely under iCloud Drive.\nIf you disable any of these for any reason, say something like Reminders, iCloud won't sync that data between your devices.\n\nA: I have no idea how it got to this state, but out of desperation I went to Settings, My Name, iCloud, scrolled down past \"APPS USING ICLOUD\" to iCloud Drive which I toggled off, then back on.

If spotlight then crashes when you click the second file in the list, that's a good sign that that particular file is the source of your problems.\n\nA: A couple of thoughts...\nFirst, you might try searching for '1' in a Finder search window. That also uses spotlight, but since the results are presented through the Finder you might get a usable error message that will help you diagnose the problem.\nSecond, you can try working with the unix spotlight metadata commands, particularly mdfind and mdutil. The first lets you run spotlight queries from the command line, so you may get usable error messages. The second allows you to work with the metadata stores directly, even up to nuking the stores for particular volumes.\n\nA: It is rather drastic, but you can tell Spotlight to erase all indexes with this command in Terminal (which will ask for your password):\nsudo mdutil -Ea\nIt will then rebuild all the indexes.\nYou can show the status of indexing with:\nmdutil -sa or mdutil -sav\n", "Q: How do I make my cursor return to its normal size?

I am one of very rare Mac user at my university. In Poland Macs are not popular, and our net administrator and our tech support have no or limited knowledge on macOS. I use desktop MacMini (at work) and MacBook Air (at home) both logged in with the same AppleID, running on Big Sur. I have installed Apple's Remote Desktop (v.3.9.4.) on my MacBook Air and want to connect remotely and work on my MacMini at work (screen sharing). I already contacted Apple's Tech Support and learned that to access remotely from different network router at my university's network has to have set a port forwarding (ports 3283, 5900).\nCan anyone provide me more details on that? I got feeling that I need a ready solution when I contact my net administrator with that to overcome unwillingness to tackle new problems.\nBest regards, Marcin\n\nA: There are a couple of ways to approach this. One is via use of the University's VPN, which would put you right on their network and keep your IT department from having to do anything besides allow you to log into their network via the VPN. This would be my preference as it is common, secure and puts your home Mac right on the same network with your Mac at university.\nBut you don't mention that there was a VPN involved, so...\nTake those port numbers and the IP address of your Mac at the university and your Mac at home and talk to someone in the IT department.\nWhat they will do (if they allow this) is forward your home IP address to your work IP address via those two port numbers. It is all done by your IT department. When they are done with this they should give you an IP address to connect to from home. This IP address will, in effect, be your Mac at University. You would plug that into Apple Remote Desktop at home and it should (if everyone has done their jobs right) connect you from home to your University Mac.\nNote that your University IT department might recoil in horror at what you are suggesting (I would, we don't do this where I work) as it could be a security risk. So your best bet is to see if they have a VPN that you can use.\nWe can help you with that too, but that would be a different question, separate from this.\n", "Q: Does this cable support 1440p/2k 144Hz? I would like to connect an external monitor (1440p/2k 144Hz) to my Macbook Air M1.\nMy monitor has Mini displayport and HDMI outputs.\nDoes this cable support 144Hz on 2k? https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HN8B2ZM/A/mophie-usb-c-cable-with-mini-displayport-connector\nOr can I use an adapter instead of this cable?\nThank you!\n\nA: That cable is marketed as supporting \"4K and 5K external monitor[s] with pixel-perfect clarity\", which implies that it's at least a Standard DisplayPort cable that supports HBR2, capable of up to 4K 60 Hz. Furthermore, cables that carry a DisplayPort Alt Mode over USB-C signal support HBR3, meaning it can support 5K 60 Hz all the way up to 8K 60 Hz.\nAt 1440p, standard DisplayPort cables of HBR2 spec can carry up to 165 Hz signal. HBR3 increases that to 240 Hz.\n", "Q: Creating a reminder on Mac programmatically/in a script, without opening the Reminders app For creating reminders from a script or command-line, the usual advice is to use AppleScript and tell application \"Reminders\" to do this and that—which pops the app open so that it accepts the commands. However, the ‘Fantastical’ app, at least in the first version, could create reminders without opening the Reminders app. They were still native reminders sitting there in Apple's app if I opened it. This approach has a couple advantages for me:\n\n*\n\n*It's faster, since the Reminders app doesn't need to launch.\n\n\n*The Reminders app doesn't hang  around, appearing in the app switcher and in the dock. And I don't need to close it.\nSo what's the trick for doing this?\nI'm  pretty  sure there  were no web APIs involved, since I never had an iCloud account and I don't think reminders can even be synced with third-parties like the calendar. Though I guess Fantastical could do something behind my back, but it's hard  to imagine it happening without a trace.\n\nA: Use EventKit.  Apple has had that API for years.\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/eventkit\n", "Q: 2 SSDs to one partition I have the same external SSD twice. I would like to save the macOS operating system on these two SSDs so that the operating system recognizes the 2 SSDs as one SSD.\nAbout the same as with a FusionDrive, only the difference is not 1x HDD and 1x SSD but 2x SSD. But this should be a startup volume.  So what I can start with.\nMy thought: Create a JBOD in recoveryOS Install macOS on it and boot on it is that possible?\nHow do I get it that way?\nThanks\n\nA: Only two drives would have to be RAID 0.\nThis is the least safe RAID type of all. Plus it would have to be software, not hardware RAID, so even less stable.\nI wouldn't trust it as far as I could spit it, because the first time one of the drives glitches or doesn't hook up to USB just exactly properly first attempt, all your data is gone forever.\nAfter the question edit - trying to make a Fusion drive using two identical speed drives makes absolutely no sense at all. A Fusion drive uses a small SSD as a fast cache to a larger HDD.\n\nA: We do this at work all the time with SoftRaid and NVMe M.2 storage. We have never had a case where booting from RAID paid off performance wise, but I’ll take your requirements as having merit.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.softraid.com/softraid-big-sur-and-the-new-m1-macs/\n\n*https://www.owcdigital.com/products/express-4m2\nRemember, raid is not backup.

I experience the following problem/bug that I would like to have fixed:\n\n*\n\n*My MacBook Pro laptop has the correct time.\n\n\n*My iPad Air (3rd gen) has the correct time.\n\n\n*When I connect my iPad to my laptop via a cable, my iPad suddenly changes to a random and incorrect time. This instantly fixes itself when I disconnect the cable.\nIn particular, the instant I \"share screen\" in Zoom (meaning the Zoom session that I am running on my laptop shares the screen of the Ipad via a cable connection), my iPad suddenly displays an incorrect time that has nothing to do with either the time setting of my laptop or the original time setting of my iPad. This is frustrating because I need to view the time while I am teaching, but I consistently view the incorrect time when I look at my iPad screen (I have to remember to view my laptop screen for the correct time).\n\nA: Was this figured out? As others have said, I have the same issue with the same time 9:41. It makes me concerned when I teach because I see the time and think I have gone over until I remember the issue.  (apologies for not commenting instead. I just joined and it won't let me).\n\nA: I still see this issue whenever the iPad screen is shared via cable. The date and time becomes fixed for the duration of the share, as 09:41 Tue 9 Jan.\nStopping screen sharing from the iPad will return the correct time.\nThis is only via cable; sharing via Airplay does not cause this anomaly.\n", "Q: photos library shows blanks after updating the library What happened\n\n*\n\n*opened my fairly big (1TB) photos library (stored on an external drive, backup/copy on a different external drive)\n\n*Photos started to update the library (no problems, took about half an hour or less)\n\n*Browsed through the photos, realized that there were many blanks:\n\nIn full screen mode, the images appear blank:\n\nThis is the same for all media, i.e. Live Photos, videos and portraits.

The engineers didn't come up with anything/they don't really offer database repair. Their \"advice\" was to manually rebuild the library and use TimeMachine so that there is not only one backup but the history included.

The SSD wrote twice as much data in two weeks as the Macbook Retina 2017 did in two years. I use VSCodium and Google Chrome for Web development. I haven't downloaded anything other than those programs. I haven't logged into iCloud. I have not connected any iPhones to this laptop. I haven't even downloaded old projects. I don't know exactly, I estimate my data on the SSD to be less than 1-5GB considering the programs I have installed in unpacked state. That said, smartctl shows that I have written 17Tb of data to the SSD and continue to write 1Tb daily. I honestly don't understand how this can be. I keep working on my old macbook with the same programs VSCodium and Google Chrome. The smartctl program says I'm writing about 20-30Mb per day. The number of writes to the SSD only goes up when I download files from the internet.\nI have never tried XCode. Maybe there are special programs for Macbook M1 for web development.\nIf I replace VSCodium with XCode and Google Chrome with Safari, can my mac survive the rest of this year?\nUPDATE\nThere is another tool iostat.\nLet's see what the third column of the iostat output shows.\nIn the first screenshot I caught a not very good moment for comparison. When I ran the utility, Chrome Browser was loaded. The second screenshot corrects this awkwardness. The third screenshot is the old Macbook Retina 2017 running under a fairly high load. i7core != m1core\nTo get this low write rate on the MacBook Air SSD, I had to turn Spotlight off. I also (not sure if that helps) disabled Time Machine.\nYesterday's SSD write indications were 20-50 times higher.\nOn the old macbook, I didn't turn anything off. Not the browser, not VSCodium, not Spotlight, not Time Machine. Plus I have two VeraCrypt disk images connected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Don't get carried away with news stories. This is the main takeaway.\nThere's a number of reasons why you shouldn't be worried or concerned (yet).\nIn the comments you indicate that Apple somehow secretly configured the SSD to use it as RAM. This is not the case - this is not how of any of that works. When a Mac runs out of RAM, it uses the disk as a replacement - this is known as \"swapping\". It is a basic technique used on all Macs (not only M1s) and is also used on all other modern operating systems such as Windows, Linux, etc.\nThere's no indication anywhere that the M1 Mac swaps more than an Intel Mac with the same amount of RAM.\nThere's also no indication anywhere that the SSD in the M1 Mac Mini is somehow \"worse\" or degrades faster than SSDs in comparable Intel Macs.\nThe whole scary news story here hinges on the fact that a SMART value is seemingly high on these machines. However, it is really jumping to a conclusion that this means that the drive is actually degrading or that the machine will stop working in a short while. For multiple reasons:\n\n*\n\n*These numbers could very well be interpreted incorrectly. SMART values have always been problematic in that different disk vendors use slightly different definitions and units, and sometimes do not report numbers according to standards - and that their reporting might even change on the same hardware just with newer firmware.\n\nIt could very well be that the numbers are a factor 1000 off because the units are wrong. We cannot know that. Remember that on the M1 Mac, we do not have a direct connection to a Samsung SSD controller or similar (that we have been used to on older Macs) - but rather everything goes through the special Apple integrated disk controller that handles security.\nThe right thing here is to contact Apple for clarification on how the numbers should be interpreted.\n\n\n*It is not so that a SSD drive just suddenly stops working when the lifetime left indicator raches 0%. That's not how this works. Essentially the drive keeps a score of usage, and the vendor has built in some more or less arbitrary threshold number. It could be that this number represents what the vendors will treat as warranty cases, it could be that this number represents what the vendor think is the an average drive's life time - or it could just be any old random number.\n\nIn practice it is very common for drive manufacturers to have this threshold be much lower than the actual average life time of drives.\nWithout confirmation from Apple we cannot really conclude that this number means anything in practice.\nIn any case, if the drives in M1 Macs should die from ordinary usage in less than a year, Apple would have to replace those drives for everyone.\nSo either (a) the numbers that you make lots of conclusions from are not correctly interpreted, or (b) Apple made a huge oversight and sold products that wear out much faster than ordinary.\nWithout further information, I would assume (a) is the most likely. Press Apple for more information and we can know for sure. If (b) is the case, Apple would have to do a recall program of some sort.\n\nA: Reinstalling MacOS doesn't solve the problem. But I did find a solution for myself. The solution is probably not suitable for active Spotlight users. This recipe probably won't help everyone. But it helped me a lot.\nFirst, I removed all the checkboxes in the system settings Spotlight. I also added the file system root to the indexing exceptions. This was not necessary to do. But it solved the problem by 50%.\nNext, open a terminal and type a command:\n  sudo mdutil -i off -a\n\nEnter the password. After running the command, the terminal will list Stoplight search folders and after each folder should be the phrase:\n Indexing and searching disabled.\n\nThen turn off the computer. After that, we turn on the computer in RecoveryOS mode. For M1 Macbooks it is activated by a long press on the Power button (keep the button pressed for about 10 seconds).\nOn the black screen choose from two options cogwheels.\nThen in the main menu select Utilites -> Terminal.\nType the command: csrutil disable. Then enter the password.\nThen we need to restart computer in normal mode. This can be done quickly by typing reboot in the same terminal.\nWhen the system is booted, open the terminal again and type the command:\n  sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist\n\nEnter the password again. These actions were enough to solve my problem.\n\nAfter that, you can reboot the computer again in RecoveryOS, turn on the terminal and type the command csrutil enable. But if you are the only user of the computer and you understand what you are doing, it is not necessary to enable CSR protection.\nIf you need a working Spotlight, as I mentioned at the beginning, this is probably not the solution for you. It's everyone's choice - some people value the integrity of an SSD. But, there will be people who are ready to tolerate 1TB of daily SSD wear and tear for the sake of a working Spotlight.\nAs an alternative, Quicksilver might be a good replacement for Spotlight. This program is free and open source.\n", "Q: How can I troubleshoot or fix when macOS Photos app import from a connected iPhone gets stuck on \"Preparing to import from...\"?

I don't know AppleScript syntax well enough to spot this as a problem, but I do know how to isolate a problem: by removing parts of the code (or replacing them with placeholders if necessary), and seeing if the problem goes away. By seeing which bits of code remove the problem, I can isolate where the specific problem is.\nThis technique is the basis of the \"divide and conquer\" method described here for creating a minimal, reproducible example of a problem before posting it here. This is an extremely useful process to go through before posting, both because it'll reduce the amount of irrelevant stuff people here have to look through to find the problem, and also because there's a good chance you'll spot the problem yourself once it's isolated out.\nIn this case, I used the opposite technique: rather than trying to remove everything except the problem, I tried to remove only the problem. That is, I removed sections of code, and if the problem remained I put that section back and tried removing something else instead. But if removing a section did remove the problem, I'd put it back and then try removing just a smaller piece of it.\nSo, the first thing I did was remove most of the contents of the tell application \"Safari\" ... end tell section (leaving just activate, so it wouldn't complain about an empty section), hit the Compile button, and got no error. So I put it back (Command-Z to undo), and removed just the repeat 100 times ... end repeat section. Compile, still get the error. Ok, put that back... and there's one other line that looks different from most of the others. So I removed the line with {option,control,shift}, Compiled, error gone!\nSo at that point I knew where the error was coming from, and it was just a matter of trying variations on the syntax until I found one that worked.\n", "Q: 'Update' volume appeared after High Sierra install This is a spin off from another question. I recently got a 2018 15 MBP with Big Sur on it. I erased the disk and installed High Sierra as I need to run some old software. The install seemed to go fine but a curious extra volume appeared on the Desktop after the install called 'Update' which seems to contain NVRAM and firmware related files.\nThe volume is mounted normally and not hidden.\nI can find virtually no reference to this happening online anywhere.\nMy guess is it is created as some sort of temporary volume to do with the installation and it should not be there afterwards?\nI followed Apple's instructions about erasing an APFS disk prior to installing High Sierra, but these instructions seemed incomplete in hindsight as they suggest just erasing Macintosh HD if other partitions are not available. As I was new to APFS and its partition scheme, it seemed later a better thing to have done was 'Show devices and then erase the device at the top of the hierarchy and I wonder if what I did helped created this mysterious Update volume ?\nAnyway what is this volume and can it be safely deleted ?\n\n\n\n\nA: \nNote: This answer assumes the reader does not have a Fusion drive.\n\nWhen selecting the Erase button on the top of the Disk Utility window, you should see a popup window similar to the one shown below.\n\nIf instead you see a popup window is similar to the one shown below, then you are not erasing the entire drive. If the drive is not visible on the left side of the Disk Utility window, then press the key combination ⌘2 to show all devices.\n\nWhen erasing the entire drive, you should select APFS for the format and GUID Partition Map as the scheme, as shown below. (Although, if you chose Mac OS Extended (Journaled), then the macOS installer would automatically convert to APFS.)\n\nFrom the way I read your question, I do not think you erased the entire drive. You would probably be better off starting over and erasing the entire drive. This should eliminate the Update volume.\nAlso, consider this: Big Sur uses a newer version of APFS than is known to previous versions of macOS. So if the APFS container was created or updated by Big Sur and all you did is erase a volume before installing High Sierra, then the verify and repair software included with High Sierra may not function properly. So if you need to verify or repair APFS, you should first boot to a Big Sur version of macOS recovery. This is why you would be better off starting over and use the Disk Utility that came with the High Sierra installer to erase the entire drive.\n", "Q: What are safe files to delete to free up space? Apart from deleting old documents and apps that are no longer useful or can be re-downloaded again from the App Store (like iMovie / Garageband), what can safely be deleted from a Macbook Pro?\nI deleted Caches from /Users/John Doe/Library/Containers/com.apple.safari which was 1.1GB, which contained a WebKit folder and a few other ones.\nIn general, if you ignore the /var directory, what files from the /Users/USERNAME/Library and the /Library directory (aside from Caches very infrequently) are safe to delete to free up space and will have no major consequences on the OS?\n\nA: Technically, you can delete every thing in the User Library and the system will continue to work just fine. A brand new user account has nothing in its Library, after all.\nThe user Library contains iCloud Drive files, iOS backups, user-specific app data like Mail and Messages, as well as settings and preferences.\nBut realistically, the small amounts of space you can save here and there (and the constant manual management) is not worth the effort: the biggest occupier of space is your apps and your files. If you're filling up a small internal storage drive, then you need to think about using external drives, network or cloud-based storage.\n", "Q: How can VoiceOver users activate links after the first one, in a message with multiple interactive items? On selecting a message containing multiple links or other interactive items in VoiceOver, how do I activate any after the default first item?\nSuppose an iPhone VoiceOver user receives a SMS message like this one:\n\nHello! Your order number 12345 is ready, you can check status on our website or app here https://app.example.com/orders/12345\n\nWith VoiceOver on, the number 12345 is treated as an interactive item, so most gestures I try on such a message select the number, not the link.\nIf I open the message's context menu, or swipe down to \"Actions - default\", or if I do any of the things described in this Apple forum thread \"How do I open links on accessibility voiceover?\", it only activates the number and gives me the option to copy the number to the clipboard. How can a VoiceOver user reach a link that isn't the first interactive item in the message?\n\nA: I've found one way, but it's not great:\n\n*\n\n*Tap or swipe to select the message containing multiple links\n\n*Do a two-finger rotate gesture until the rotar says \"Links\". For me one rotation left (anti-clockwise) from the default position seems to usually reach Links\n\n*Swipe down repeatedly until the desired link is selected.

When you develop a program you compile a web server as an executable server.\nWhen you run it the firewall would ask \"Do you want the application 'server' to accept incoming network connections?\".\nYou click yes.

I don't want to disable firewall, I only want to disable it for this specific program.\n\nA: Code Signing\nYour binary needs to be code signed with codesign.\nThe permission to accept incoming network connections is associated with the meta-data and signature of the binary, not the specific binary.

This is easy to bypass.\nInstead of coming as one executable it's actually ~120 separate executables that the main one will call, or maybe they can call each other, and my computer will interrupt and quit the program every time it wants to call a new one. I would just grind through them if I thought that the program would call every one every run and I could clean them all up at once, but my guess is it's just going to call a handful at a time so I'll never know if I've gotten them all.\nI ran ls -lha on the directory and they nearly all have the same output:\n-rwxr-xr-x@   1 <user>  staff    92M Oct 29  2019 <name_of_exe>\n\na few are different, but there's no difference between the ones I've already approved and the ones I haven't.\nAfter signing them with the command find . -name \"*\" -exec codesign --force -s - {} \\;, the error message changes and it says:\n\nUnable to open \"<one_of_the_binaries>\" because Apple could not check for malicious software.\nThis software needs to be updated.

I have two Macbook Pros:\n\n*\n\n*Mac1 is 16' 2019 running Big Sur 11.2.3\n\n*Mac2 is 13' 2017 running Catalina 10.15.7.\n\nI am encountering this weird problem while trying to access file on Mac1 from Mac2 via MacOS's File Sharing. In Mac2's Finder, I use smb://Mac1 to open Mac1, but although occasionally it is successful, most of the time it just times out before popping up saying 'connection failed'. However, I can open Mac1 from my iPad very easily. So I guess something wrong on Mac2.\nI checked sys logs in Console app and found something maybe relevant:\nKernelEventAgent   tid 657c52ee type 'smbfs', mounted on '/Volumes/mac1', from '//ABCD@ufo20mbp._smb._tcp.local/mac1', not responding\nKernelEventAgent   tid 657c52ee type 'smbfs', mounted on '/Volumes/mac1', from '//ABCD@ufo20mbp._smb._tcp.local/mac1', dead\n\nin which ABCD IS NOT the correct account name to login on Mac1. I highly believe this could be the reason why the connection fails, but I cannot find any place to reset the account name. I am not sure if I am correct but I tried smb://XYZ@mac1 in Finder, but no luck, in which XYZ is the right login account name on Mac1.\nPlease advice what I should be to fix this issue.\n\nA: Network share credentials are stored in Keychain Access.app. Take a look there. You may search for ABCD to quickly find any credentials containing this login. You can then just delete the wrong items.\nPlease note, when using ⌘ K in Finder, your connection string needs to look like this:\nsmb://<ip address> e.g. smb://192.168.0.123\nor\nsmb://<local hostname> e.g. smb://targetMacName.local (how to find/change local hostname)\n", "Q: When will the M1 macbooks come with only software that is completely native? Has apple announced a timeframe of when the macbooks will ship with only native software for M1 chip? Currently software goes through a translation process in order for it to work on the m1 chips.\n\nA: The new M1 Macs already ship with only native software. MacOS Big Sur is made up of \"Universal Binaries\" that contain both Intel and Apple Silicon (AS) code. On an M1 Mac, the AS code is executed. On an Intel Mac, the Intel code is executed.\n(In fact, the Apple Silicon code is included on Intel Macs running Big Sur.)\nPlenty of third-party software is already available as Universal Binaries. Intel code is only translated when no AS code is available. And you have to download the Rosetta2 translation layer to implement it.\nIf you're asking when will Apple remove the translation layer, so that only AS code can run (as it did by removing Rosetta from OS X Lion): nobody knows.

I have all of my messages stored in iCloud, but for some reason they’re still taking up SSD storage on my Mac. This behavior doesn’t happen on my iPhone, but it does on my Mac and I’m not sure why. If they’re in iCloud, why are they still taking up the internal storage on my Mac? It seems strange that my iPhone doesn’t store messages on its internal storage, but my Mac does. Is there a way to prevent this from happening on my Mac somehow?\n\nA: iCloud Messages is a synchronization tool, not a storage tool.  On either platform, it will download messages to the local device, and eject them again, when necessary.\n", "Q: List of Linux programs which are not in macOS I know the following programs are in Linux but not in macOS.\nAre there more?\nWhere can I find the list?\nPlease ignore BSD counterparts.\ntree\nwatch\nwget\nwdiff\ngdb\nautoconf\n\n\nA: There exists millions and millions of programs out there in the world. Some work on Linux, some work on macOS - some work both places.\nNo-one has or could have a complete list of such programs.\nThe list you have of programs not available on macOS does not seem to be entirely correct either. A watch program is indeed included in the default macOS installation. The rest can easily be installed - for example if you install HomeBrew, you can install the tree, wget, wdiff, gdb and autoconf commands by running:\nbrew install tree wget wdiff gdb autoconf\n\nNote that lots of programs, particularly old ones, exist in multiple versions with the same name. For example Linux draws a lot of programs in from the GNU project, where macOS draws some programs in from the BSD world. So you might have programs with the same name and intended primary functionality on both Linux and macOS, but underlying are really two different programs. In many cases, you can just install the GNU version instead if you dislike the BSD version.\n", "Q: How to change this terminal customization tutorial for usage in zsh rather than bash?

Customizing Zsh is fairly different from customizing Bash. It would be quite a lot of work.\n\nor is there a tutorial for customizing your zsh shell?\n\nYes, there is!  There’s quite a few of them, in fact, but I found this one by far the best: https://scriptingosx.com/2019/06/moving-to-zsh/\nHowever, instead of doing everything by hand, you might just want to copy-paste an existing config to get you started quickly.

This particular model seems to have {audio out, USB-A, power} on the left, {SD (I think), USB-A, Thunderbolt 2} on the right (both listed front to back).\nWe want to use one of our existing monitors hooked up to another of our systems, without having to remove and re-insert cables all the time.\nThis monitor is fed via HDMI from a HP Thunderbolt dock (HSN-IX02) which only has a Thunderbolt/USB-C input, but many other outputs (HDMI, DP, etc). The monitor has HDMI, DVI and DSUB inputs of which the first two are in use.\nI very foolishly bought a mini-DP-to-DP cable, thinking that would work just be plugging the Mac mini-DP output into the dock DP output, not realising at the time that:\n\n*\n\n*the latter was an output rather than an input; and\n\n*the Mac output wasn't even a mini-DP :-)\n\nSo I think what I need is a cable with male Thunderbolt 2 at the Mac end and female Thunderbolt/USB-C at the dock end (the dock has a hard-wired input cable with male Thunderbolt/USB-C).\nMy concern is that all the cables I look at seem to assume the Thunderbolt/USB-C is at the Mac end (which is true for more recent models) and I don't want to blow more money on the wrong cable. In any case, the Thunderbolt/USB-C end for these cables is male and I need female.\nSo I guess my question is: will such a cable work from Thunderbolt-2 at the MAC to Thunderbolt/USB-C at the other end? I assume I will also need to purchase a female-female gender-bender to connect at the dock end as it's the wrong gender.\nA secondary question is: what are my other options, if any, for external displays on this Mac? There appears to be no other output ports and I'd rather not have to buy another monitor since we have no place to put it.\n\nA: First: Your Macs Thunderbolt 2 (TB2) port can act like a mini-DP port, so any cable that is mini-DP to something that can be connected to your monitor will work. However, connecting your TB2 MacBook to that docking station will most likely not work and may be expensive.\nYou mentioned there is a free VGA port on your monitor, so I would get a miniDP to VGA cable. Inexpensive and should serve your needs. However, as Gilby has pointed out in the comments this will usually limit your resolution to 1920x1200.\n", "Q: Where are the tabs in Safari saved (in iCloud or Finder)? I want to recover several links of a website I had open as tabs for quite a few months now.

I split up my virtual desktops into \"topics\" so I can better handle the big amount of open windows and applications.\nOn my laptop, I have virtual Desktops 1,2,3,4,5.\nOn my second monitor, I have 6,7,8,9,10.\nThe virtual Desktop topics are kind of \"paired\" with topics, so e.g. when I am working on coding tasks, I use Desktop 1 (on the laptop) and Desktop 6 (on the second monitor), which both have relevant apps and windows open.\nNow, when I want to switch to another topic, e.g. to Desktop 2 (where I have coding-related but not task-necessary windows open) I also want the second monitor to simultaneously switch to Desktop 7 (basically one virtual Desktop to the right on each device).\nIs there such a possibility/feature?\n\nUpdate\nSo far I only tested the solution of changing the Mission Control settings (see the accepted answer). However, it has a quite annoying drawback:\nWhen the Displays do NOT have separate Spaces, every time I start the Mac and it wakes up from sleep mode, all windows are rearranged back on my laptop (not on my second monitor anymore). This is caused due to the Display Port automatically being disconnected every time the Mac goes into sleep mode. This means I have to rearrange my windows every time I start my Mac, which becomes tedious quite fast.\nSo far, I did not find a satisfying solution that also is relatively simple to do. The second solution to the accepted answer seems like a good workaround, but I do not feel comfortable disabling the system-integrity protection for that. The issue is simply not big enough for me...but this is just my personal cost-benefit calculation. I can imagine, that if someone has more than two monitors and want to switch spaces on specific monitors simultaneously (e.g. when switching spaces on monitor 1, it should also switch on monitor 3, but not on 2) it definitely be worth doing it.\nFeel free to add an answer if you find another (more simple) solution.\n\nA: If your 'pairs' are always the same combinations 1&6, 2&7 etc, then switching off 'Displays have separate Spaces' will solve it - though you'll have to set your pairs up again initially as it won't combine your existing screens intelligently.\n\nIf you need anything more complex/flexible, then you'd probably be looking at something 3rd party.\n\nA: Option 1: Mission-Control Setting \"Displays have separate Spaces\"\nI'm not entirely sure if this is what you're looking for:\nIf you go to \"System Preferences\" ➝ \"Mission Control\", then uncheck \"Displays have separate Spaces\":\n\nThis will couple the spaces of all screens. So if you swipe or switch to another space on one screen, the other screens will also switch to the corresponding space.\nOption 2: Use a window manager\nIf you would like to configure the behaviour and the keyboard shortcuts exactly the way you want and you are willing to spend some time to configure it, consider using a window manager. A nice window manager for macOS is yabai.\n\nyabai is a window management utility that is designed to work as an extension to the built-in window manager of macOS. yabai allows you to control your windows, spaces and displays freely using an intuitive command line interface and optionally set user-defined keyboard shortcuts using skhd and other third-party software.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the homebrew package manager\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\n\n\n*Install yabai\nbrew install yabai\n\n\n\n*For switching spaces to work, you might also need to disable the system-integrity protection: https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Disabling-System-Integrity-Protection -- Maybe have a look at the wikipedia article to decide whether you are ok with that.\n\n\n*Make sure to install and load yabai's scripting addition\nsudo yabai --install-sa\nsudo yabai --load-sa\n\n\n\n*Depending on whether you would like to use window tiling, window-focus features etc., configure yabai in the ~/.yabairc file.\n\n\n*In order to bind window-manager commands to keyboard shortcuts, install skhd:\nbrew install koekeishiya/formulae/skhd\nbrew services start skhd\n\n\n\n*Configure shortcuts in ~/.skhdrc. For example, to bind Command+Ctrl+1 to switch to spaces 1 (on screen 1) and 6 (on screen 2), and to bind Ctrl+1 to switch to space 1 (on screen 1) only, use this configuration:\n# ~/.skhdrc\nctrl - 1 : yabai -m space --focus 1\ncmd + ctrl - 1 : yabai -m space --focus 1 && yabai -m space --focus 6\n\n", "Q: Authenticate SMB file sharing on MacOS 10.15 bound to openldap We're running a file-sharing server running MacOS 10.15 that is bound (for reasons outside of my control) to a bare openldap (slapd) server running on Ubuntu Server 18.04. The LDAP server is using a \"self-signed\" cert on its SSL interface, as the organization I'm at has their own CA.\nAfter working some magic to load the apple.schema and backfill apple guids for each user/group, every service that we offer for our mac clients bound to LDAP (AFP, screen sharing, ssh, etc) will successfully authenticate authorized network users/groups, except for SMB. Right now I am just trying to get smb sharing from a mac client to the file share.\nSome notes:\n\n*\n\n*SMB was initially not working for non-admin local accounts. I manually added the SMB SACL group, com.apple.access_smb, as it wasn't there by default. The resolves access issues for local accounts, but not network accounts. Not sure why it doesn't ship with that group since the PAM module specifically references it:\n\n% cat /etc/pam.d/smbd\n# smbd: service ACL account management support\naccount required    pam_sacl.so sacl_service=smb allow_trustacct\nsession required    pam_permit.so\n\nI can confirm that my network user is a member,\n% dseditgroup -o checkmember -m $USER com.apple.access_smb\nyes $USER is a member of com.apple.access_smb\n\n\n*\n\n*Following the instructions in: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204021, I have disallowed validate negotiate requests from the client and only allowed SMB v2 on the server. There are no options for \"authenticated binds\" or Open Directory replica, as also referenced in the link.\n\n\n*The config for the LDAP binding in directory utility uses custom mappings and authentication as a read-only user.  I've added some custom mappings for apple-y and other things, and included the output of odutil at the bottom in case there are any obvious mappings I am missing.\n\n\n*The tail-end of the debug logs when trying to mount shared drives using SMB as a network user show some ocspd errors, so for the time being I've added 127.0.0.1  ocsp.apple.com to my /etc/hosts.\nLong story short I still cannot get network users to mount shared drives over SMB. From the client, the login box errors with the invalid request \"shake\".

question here:\nThis setup does not work. The MacOS SMB server cannot use a bare openldap (slapd) server on Ubuntu because it uses NTLM for authentication. SASL mechanisms are not supported out of the box with slapd, and have to be configured differently. Ubuntu 18.04 comes with Cyrus SASL, but setting it up requires moving user passwords into the sasldb, configuring and testing SASL auth against the Ubuntu server, and reconfiguring the openldap bind accordingly. Given the complexity there, we're likely going to be moving to FreeIPA or Active Directory that have greater built in support for different auth mechanisms.\n", "Q: Using 2 Ethernet ports at once? I have a 2010 MacPro. For 11 years, I’ve never given the 2 Ethernet ports a second thought.\nNow, I have a NAS and it has 4 ports. And both the Mac and NAS are plugged into a gigabit speed hub. Question - would Mac to NAS Xfer rates improve if I run a second cable directly between the two, and if so, looking for the steps to set it up.\n\nA: If you run a cable directly between the two, and make sure that the NAS is accessed over that cable (for example by using an IP address specifically available over that link), you can make sure that the Mac and the NAS has the full gigabit speed available to them. If you have other devices accessing your NAS at the same time, this will somewhat improve the speed (given that the NAS does not have other bottlenecks).\nIt will however not give you combined speed of both interfaces.\nIf you want that, you want to go ahead and setup link aggregation. This way you can \"bond\" the two ethernet ports into a single virtual network port. The Mac will then have a higher capacity link to your switch. This can increase bandwidth capacity when you community with multiple different devices connected to that switch. If you also similarly connect the NAS using link aggregation with two or more interfaces, you can get the combined speed of both ethernet ports of the Mac when accessing the Mac.\nNOTE: This requires your switch to support link aggregation (notably in the form of LACP). You need to set this up on your switch.\nTo set up link aggregation on your Mac, you do as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Network\n\n\n*Click the cog-wheel below the list on the left, and select \"Manage Virtual Interfaces\"\n\n\n*Click the plus button and select \"New Link Aggregate\"\n\n\n*Select the two ethernet ports and click \"Apply\"\n", "Q: Corrupt Photos in Photos_Private.photoslibrary When I try to open a photo in Photos_Private.photoslibrary, its corrupted.

Every time I plug my device to my 4K monitor into the device (via USB-C to USB-C, or USB-C to DisplayPort), macOS will show a maximum resolution of 1600x900 but my monitor's recommended resolution is 3840 x 2160.\n\nI currently have a workaround to resolve the issue which is the following:\n\n*\n\n*I switch from 1080p resolution to 1600x900\n\n*Un-plug the cable, and plug it back in again\n\n*Then switch to 3840x2160\n\nThis process can be tedious and take a while to complete (between switching resolutions). Is there any solutions which people are aware of?\nThese are the details of the device and monitor\n\n*\n\n*macOS Version: 11.2.3\n\n*Model: MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019)\n\n*Processor: 2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9\n\n*Graphics: AMD Radeon Pro 5500M 4GB\n\n*Monitor: BenQ EW327OU\n\nThese are the things which I've done to date\n\n*\n\n*I can't pin the issue on the monitor, as I've been using a MacBook Pro (2017) with the monitor for a week or so without a single problem.\n\n*Used ColorSync to repair any issues with the monitor profiles\n\n*Used various other cables such as HDMI, USB-C to USB-C and USB-C to DisplayPort.\n\n*Reset NVRAM and SMC\n\n*Re-installed macOS\n\n*I can't reproduce the error in Windows via Bootcamp, so I'm confident it's OS related.\n\n\nA: Confusingly, it does appear to be wire related. I found my original USB-C to USB-C cable which came with the monitor and it resolved the issue.\nEDIT (26/03/2021): I spoke too soon. The issue has occured with this cable as well. However, as noted by Luciano, it appears to be a known bug by Apple and will therefore be resolved in a future release.\n\nA: There is an ongoing bug with Big Sur 11.1 and 11.2 where\n\nUSB-C ports to fail to recognize external monitors, rendering external displays unusable and unable to connect. This appears to be affecting both DisplayPort and HDMI displays connected directly and through hubs and adapters.\n\nand\n\nThe second issue results in resolution issues with external displays unable to work at a full 4K 60Hz resolution, instead locked at 30Hz. In some cases, a 4K monitor is only recognized as a 1080p monitor.\n\nSo far there doesn't seem to be a fix from Apple.\n", "Q: iPhone not working but iPad is working with chromecast I have been using my phone to cast to my chromecast for almost a year with no problems but about a month ago my phone stopped seeing that my chromecast was available.  Fortunately I have an older iPad, so in the case where my phone does not work I use my iPad to cast which still works as it always has.  My iPhone and iPad are both on the same WiFi network so if one sees the chromecast, so should the other.  Why does my phone not see my chromecast on the same WiFi network but my iPad does?\nWhat I have tried:\n\n*\n\n*In the beginning I found that if I reset the chromecast that would allow the phone to see it and cast to it, but that does not work anymore. RESET CHROMECAST = NO\n\n*I try resetting my iPhone but there is no change. RESET PHONE = NO\n\n*In the beginning I found that if I reset the WiFi router that would fix it, but that no longer works. RESET ROUTER = NO\n\n*I thought maybe the chromecast was old and breaking so I recently got a new device but that did not have any effect on this problem.  BUY A NEW CHROMECAST = NO\n\nMy conclusion:\nI may be wrong, but the last thing I can think of is that the phone is broken.\nDoes anyone have any ideas before I conclude that the phone is just broken?\n\nA: I'm afraid that I don't have an answer with something as hard so sort as this problem remotely, but I don't believe it is your phone.\n\n*\n\n*I have recently started to have exactly the same issue.\n\n*Both my partners iPhone and mine, which we both used regularly to cast to the Chromecast are no longer able to do so, and we are using an older iPad, which does still works.\n\nI had initially come to the same conclusion that my phone must have been the problem, but I can't see that both of our phones, which are different models would have broken at the same time.\nI’ll be looking to do all updates in case a recent one has triggered this.\nWe also have a more recent version of a chromcast (the round version) in another room, and the phones still work fine with that one.\n", "Q: Is it reasonable to buy a new Apple Watch even though you own an iPhone 8? I own an iPhone 8 and I am considering buying an Apple Watch SE (GPS, 44 mm). I have had my iPhone for a long time and I have replaced the battery once. In my opinion, the iPhone 8 works perfectly well. But I have been contemplating about getting a fitness watch for a long time now and I really wanna buy an Apple Watch, but is it a good idea? Will it not drain my phone battery when paired? And will all features on the watch be available?\n\nQuestion: Should you buy an older Apple Watch if you own an iPhone 8?\n\n\nA: iPhone 8 supports iOS 14 which is compatible with watchOS 7, the latest OS available. Therefore all the features of the new watch will be available without compromise compared to a new iPhone.\nYour iPhone battery will not have any noticeable impact caused by an Apple Watch. Bluetooth is required for phone/watch  communication, which can use some small amount battery on any phone, and may be more of an impact on an older phone with worse battery life due to age.\n", "Q: Big Sur - Homebrew Install - illegal variable name Trying to install Homebrew on Big Sur 11.2.3\nUsing:\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\nin my Terminal\nGetting:\n\"Illegal variable name\"\nThe above code installed fine on a VM of High Sierra an hour ago. so I know it works\nAnyone have any ideas why it is not working on Big Sur?\n\nA: You need to install homebrew with this command:\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\nNote: Use /bin/bash rather than /usr/bin/ruby.\nThe curl command inside the $() expression is executed and returns the content of the install.sh file. Then, the shell replaces the $() expression with these install instructions. As the install instructions are written for bash rather than ruby, bash is needed to execute them.\nI could not reproduce the \"illegal variable name\" issue, however. Therefore, here are a couple of other workarounds that might help:\nOption 1: Switch to bash or zsh\nThe \"illegal variable name\" could occur if you are not using bash or zsh as your terminal shell, but csh or tcsh instead. (You could find out using echo $0.)\nTry switching to bash or zsh before executing the install command:\n/bin/zsh\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\nThe first line starts a zsh shell. (You can also try /bin/bash instead, but I think, Big Sur uses zsh by default, now.) Then the second line is executed in this shell, which should circumvent the \"illegal variable name\" error.\nThe reason is that the bash and zsh shells might handle the $() expansion differently than csh and tcsh. If csh interprets everything after the $ as variable, it might consider $(... is an illegal variable name.\nOption 2: Install from downloaded file\nIf, as mentioned in the comments, you have already downloaded the install.sh file, try executing the following in your terminal:\n/bin/bash /path/to/install.sh\n\nHere, /path/to/install.sh needs to be replaced by the actual path of the downloaded file. You could just type /bin/bash  and then drag-and-drop the file to your terminal, which should insert the path.\n", "Q: Renamed an icloud drive folder with the .tmp extension and files have disappeared I read that I could rename a folder to have the..tmp extension to prevent it syncing over.

Any idea where I could locate these files or are they lost?\n\nA: You try to restore previous files on iCloud.com:\n\n*\n\n*First, in iCloud.com > iCloud Drive, check if the files are present in the iCloud.com web view. If they are present here, download a copy first and foremost - and then you can decide how to proceed once you've secured a copy.\n\n*If that doesn't work, then again in iCloud.com > iCloud Drive, click \"recently deleted\" in the bottom right hand corner.\n\n*If neither of these work, you can try reaching out to Apple - they may be able to restore an account-level backup if the files are especially important.\n\n", "Q: How to block \"No Caller ID\" calls but not unknown calls My phone number is published on the website of a project I run. However, it seems some young people have found it really funny to start prank calling me. It's very annoying and rather humiliating to have them get a laugh out of me at my expense. I would like to block them.\nThe conventional advice is to enable \"Silence Unknown callers\" in iOS 13. However, this will block not only Unknown Caller ID but also any number not in contacts. This doesn't work for me, because as a part of the project, strangers will contact me by calling which I do want.\nIs there any way to only block private numbers/\"No Caller ID\" in iOS without also blocking people that are not in contacts? It doesn't seem like a hard problem since one can easily tell if it is a number or if it is unknown but I can't figure it out. I've tried the 000-000-0000 trick but it doesn't work.\n\nA: I'm fairly certain it's not currently possible in iOS, but your cell carrier may have this option.\n", "Q: HDR color problem on MacBook Pro 16\" 2019 I am watching same video on a Mac and two phones, iPhone 12 and Android.\nThere is abnormal glare on the Mac. For example in attached pics the Mac shows too much glare on girls face, clothes.\nThis happens when I play this video in HDR in Chrome, it does not happen if HDR not enabled in Safari.\nHow do I solve this problem ?\n\n\n\nA: The trouble with colour is you need to know the start point & you need your workflow to be correctly calibrated & profiled..\nI'm not so sure that YouTube is a great start point, as there is no constant definition of how anything is encoded.\nAfter that you get the issue of each device decoding & interpreting differently.\nYou can only fix this with accurate calibration & profiling using a hardware colorimeter. [This is not cheap, maybe $£€ 250 for a decent one].\nFrom the youtube info on that video…\n\nTo view this video in real HDR you need a 4K HDR TV and a device with YouTube HDR such as Chromecast Ultra.\nIf you are viewing this video on an SDR (normal non-HDR TV) the color and contrast may not look correct.\n\nI have one of those LG OLED 4k TVs, but I don't have a chromecast, so I can't view it on there. What I do have, though is a fully-calibrated workflow on my Mac.\nSo, this is what it looks like on there, in standard HD…\n\nWhich, of course, you can only see the same as I do if your display is also fully-calibrated ;)\nHowever, compared to both your Mac & iPhone pictures to me looks more natural [It's still over-punchy & nothing like \"real life\", but at least the white point looks acceptable]. Your Mac image is even more contrasty & has a yellow cast. The iPhone image is heavily over-saturated & has a yellow deficit, leaving red & blue too hot.\nI'm surprised the phone isn't closer to accurate, out of the box they tend to be reasonably close. I have never, though, seen a laptop screen that wasn't set up badly, unless it's been accurately profiled.  What we're seeing of the phone image, of course, is a photo of its screen taken on another device, meaning we have one, possibly two, further places where the colour-management is poor.\nAs you don't have the recommended hardware to view HDR, then I wouldn't try to view things that way.\nIf you could post further images of how they look in SDR, that could be an interesting comparison.\n[BTW, my personal opinion of HDR as a semi-pro colour \"almost-expert\" is that it completely messes up what might have been a really nice picture;)\nMy LG TV has also been calibrated & all this \"clever\" stuff switched off, because it's just horrible.\nEdit\nI just noticed you said it looks worse in Chrome - that's not a surprise. Chrome ignores so much of the Mac standard toolbox I'm surprised anyone puts up with it.\nThis is taken on the same screen from Chrome - yup, it looks worse. I would expect it to look worse because of Chrome's flagrant disregard for colour profiling. This is not fixable, even with calibration.\n\nSome background qualification, in case my opinions seem too… opinionated;)\nI'm a keen semi-pro photographer, used to working in a fully-calibrated environment - every screen in the house has been accurately profiled. I work in the TV/film industry so I am very used to also seeing correct colour imagery on real professional displays, day in, day out. (By 'real professional' I mean 30 grand for a 21\" display;)\n", "Q: Distribute discount coupons for our app on AppStore (sent via email) As a developer (with Apple Developer program membership), is there a way to give discount coupons for an app sold on the AppStore?\nExample use case: some users who bought many of our apps in the past contact us by email, and we would like to offer them 20% off if they purchase a new app. Is there a way to send them a discount coupon for a specific new app via email?\n\nA: You cannot send out 20% discount coupons for App Store app purchases.\nYou have the choice of either using App Store promo codes that gives the user the app for free, or using App Store offer codes that discounts in-app subscriptions for the first term.\n", "Q: How to use Accessibility Shortcuts for enabling Display Color Filters? As part of my evening routine, I have enabled Dark Mode and Night Shift to turn on in the evening. In addition, I like to turn on the grayscale/greyscale color filter option in System Preferences > Accessibility > Display > Color Filters > Enable Color Filters as shown in the screenshot below (1).\n\nNow, instead of drilling down into the appropriate submenu to turn the color filter on | off, is there a way to add this option to the Accessibility Shortcuts list from the drop-down menu bar button as shown in the screenshot (2)?\n--\nJust to be thorough in my question, I want to show that the existing shortcuts do not include Color Filters as shown below. I do not see an option to add additional/new shortcuts.\n\n\nA: On macOS Big Sur., you can enable that option here…\n\n\nA: A workaround is to use an AppleScript saved as an application. Double-clicking it (saved on the desktop, for example) allows for making the changes quite easily.\nSee https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/413540/248480.\nStill, this doesn't answer the original question so I would look forward to other responses.\n", "Q: How can I disable Finder notifications? Every time I disconnect my mac from its dock, I get a Finder notification about ejecting a drive before disconnecting. It's a drive I use for time machine backup, and I just don't think it's worth it to take the time to eject it every time I want to move my mac.\nIs there a way to disable this notification? The Finder app does not appear in the Notification settings.\n\nA: From what it looks like there isn't a decent way to do this without unloading the entire Notification Center and any other notifications alongside with it.\nHowever, as @Tetsujin noted and as many other people would also concur, for the sake of your drive and how macOS uses it I'd personally recommend just ejecting it for the sake of your data and not to risk nuking that drive even if the chances are small; annoying but necessary with how the file system deals with write caching.\n\nA: I ended up putting the drive on the network using a raspberry pi. Here's the tutorial I followed for anyone wanting to save a few seconds each day\nhttps://mudge.name/2019/11/12/using-a-raspberry-pi-for-time-machine/\n", "Q: User home *apparently* scracthed after Big Sur update After a Big Sur update (to 11.2.3) and the usual multiple reboots, when I was able to log into my account I discovered that the whole user folder was apparently scratched away and recreated as if it was a new user. Generally speaking a really scary thing, even though I have a fresh backup done just before running the update; but it is not a good perspective having to spend several hours while restoring 2TB worth of data (SSD are fast, but that amount of data still requires some time).\nHow to recover from that?\nFortunately I've been able to fix it by myself, so I'm going to post an answer below; just in case it might be useful for others or it happens again...\n\nA: The key point of the problem is that my user profile (fritz) is located on a separate encrypted volume Users, so its actually home path is /Volumes/Users/fritz. When I login after a reboot I use another account to enter into the system (administrator) that is regularly located on the root volume (/Users/administrator): then I enter the encryption password for the Users volume and at last I log into my main account.\nThis setup (which has been working for years) probably messed up the latest system update tool, because it basically recreated a new user fritz from scratch (when I logged in after the system update I was not only asked for enabling Siri - it always does it - but also other preferences, such as the light/dark theme, a thing that happens for users that have just been created). The path of the new bogus account was /Volumes/Users/fritz as it should be but it was not a mount point: it was just a plain directory of the root volume. The Users volume was mounted at /Volumes/Users 1 and everything was still there, but no more associated to the fritz account.\nThe obvious solution was to remove the bogus /Volume/Users directory, but the system wouldn't let me do that, even from sudo - typical security restrictions of the latest macOS's I suppose. I rebooted in Recovery mode just to find - to my surprise - that the bogus directory had not been created in that mode; so it was impossible to remove in that way.\nAt last the solution was:\n\n*\n\n*Log in as administrator as usual, without entering the password for the Users volume.\n\n*Remove the user fritz.\n\n*At this point I was able to remove with sudo the bogus directory /Volume/Users.\n\n*Open the Disk Utility and mount Users. Now the volume was mounted in the right place.\n\n*Re-create the fritz user with all the previous settings (UID and home folder path).\n\n", "Q: RAM Upgrade on 2018 Mac mini I just purchased 64GB of RAM that's compatible with my 2018 Mac mini, but in no way shape or form do I trust myself enough to make the installation myself. I called my local Apple Store to see if they could do it for me, and they said they couldn't do it with third-party RAM for warranty reasons. Does anyone know of a place that could make the installation for me such as a place like Best Buy perhaps? Not really sure who does this type of stuff by I would definitely prefer to have a professional do it instead of risking messing something up on my own.\n\nA: Check your local area for Mac specialists. I found a tame Mac guy, after I attempted to install the RAM, but didn't seat it properly and broke my screwdriver in the process. He charged me £50, so on Crucial's prices I'm still making a massive saving on Apple's charge.\nAs a business, they'll be insured against damage.\n\nA: Apple trains and certifies people to do repairs globally.

When I punch in the valid iCloud account info and server ids, both smtp.mail.me.com and imap.mail.me.com servers fail to connect.\nI saw a reference to app-specific passwords some Apple docs, but I couldn't get that to work.\nWhat am I missing?\nThanks!\n\nA: In 2018, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla deprecated TLS 1.0 and 1.1 effective March of 2020. TLS 1.2 was created in 2008, and thus postdates Panther.\nUnfortunately, this seems to imply that Mac OS X Mail in Panther does not support the security protocols currently required to access iCloud mail servers, or any other modern web server requiring a secure connection.\n\nA: The problem is likely that your email service does not support older versions of TLS (aka SSL, aka HTTPS), and Panther does not support newer versions of TLS. This creates an impasse where neither can talk to each other.\nTo fix this problem, you need an interpreter—a piece of software which sits between you and the server, intercepts your traffic, and modifies it to be compatible. The technical term for this (which you've probably heard somewhere) is a \"proxy server\", and more specifically a \"MitM\" or \"man-in-the-middle\" proxy which decrypts and re-encrypts your traffic before sending it on its way.\nFor Macs running OS X 10.6 – 10.13, I created an easy-to-install package which should be simple to set up: https://jonathanalland.com/legacy-mac-proxy.html.\n\nUnfortunately, the fact that you're on Panther makes things more difficult. I have been unable to make Squid 4 work reliably on OS X 10.5 and below.\nOne alternative is to set up Crypto Ancienne, which is said to be compatible with even OS X 10.0 and NeXTSTEP. Note that because Crypto Ancienne does not perform certificate verification, it cannot offer the security guarantees that usually come with https connections.\nA second alternative is to run a proxy server on a different computer, and connect to it from your Mac running Panther. For instance, you could install my package on a newer Mac (but not too new), uncomment the line in squid.conf to allow non-localhost connections, and add the newer Mac's IP address to your Panther machine. Alternately, install Squid 4 on a Raspberry Pi (ensure the compile time option --enable-ssl-crtd is enabled), and reuse my squid.conf file, adjusting the paths as needed.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Where does Xcode install if macOS is installed on an external drive? I foolishly bought a Mac Mini with 128gb internal SSD for compiling Unity games for iOS, thinking \"all I need to install is Xcode and Unity, and I can put documents on an external drive\". However, macOS eats up about 45GB, Xcode will quickly eat up another 40GB and continue to grow without end, and Unity uses up a few more GB. You need about 40GB of free space to upgrade macOS and about 25GB of free space to upgrade Xcode, meaning that you quickly end up in a situation where there isn't enough free space on the Mac to upgrade anything. One time I cleared up exactly enough free space to upgrade macOS with nothing to spare, then the upgrade ran out of space and failed mid-upgrade (apparently the \"required free space\" is not accurate). This completely broke the OS and I had to erase everything and reinstall from scratch.\nHaving run into the \"not enough space to upgrade\" issue yet again, I'm ready to give up and try something different. Since macOS can be installed on an external drive, I'm thinking I'll reverse the usual strategy - I'll install the OS and applications on the external drive and save documents on the internal drive.\nNormally Xcode can only be installed on the internal drive. If macOS is installed on an external drive, will xCode still be installed on the internal drive, or does it install to the same drive as macOS?\n\nA: Apps from the Mac App Store like Xcode install to /Applications which maps to the Applications folder on the data volume in the same container as the macOS installation. This can be moved wherever you desire after installation, but it sounds like this is the location you want anyway.\nXcode from developer.apple.com is the .app bundle inside a compressed archive. You can download, extract and move the app wherever you desire.\n", "Q: Problems with Varmilo VA88M keyboard, seems to switch to ANSI layout I have, since some 2 months, a VA88M Varmilo keyboard (and am very happy with it), a ISO Nordic keyboard layout.

It worked for a while but then turned on the backlighting permanently which was very aggravating. I mailed them again and got another patch file and that one turned it back to the original problem. By then I started thinking that it might be a hw problem so I returned the keyboard and got another one. After a while that one also went ANSI.

I've been working with .avi files up until now so it hasn't been a problem, but evidently fotos is claiming the mp4s and not even giving me a way to control where they go.\n\nA: One option is to do the following:\n\n*\n\n*On your iPad launch the VLC app\n\n*Tap on the Network option\n\n*Enable the Sharing via WiFi option\n\n*This should present you with at least two http URL addresses\n\n*On your laptop, open your preferred web browser (Safari, etc)\n\n*Enter one of the URL addresses (NOTE: I find the numbered address is much more reliable than the one using your device name)\n\n*You browser will now open a Sharing via WiFi page\n\n*Use this page to directly upload/download files to/from VLC on your iPad.\n\n\nA: You can transfer files to and from VLC (and other supported apps) using Finder or iTunes.\nMacOS Finder (macOS Catalina and later)\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPad by cable or same Wi-fi* network.\n\n*Open Finder and select your device the sidebar.\n\n*Go to Files section in the window.\n\n*Look for VLC in the list: Drag and drop the file on VLC to transfer it.\n\niTunes (macOS Mojave and earlier as well as Windows)\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPad by cable or same Wi-fi* network.\n\n*Open iTunes and select your device from the menu.\n\n*Go to File Sharing int he left sidebar.\n\n*Select VLC and drag and drop the file.\n\nNote on Wi-fi\n*Wi-fi: only works if you have connect by cable at least once before and selected the \"Show this iPad when connected to WiFi\" option in Finder or iTunes.\nGuides from Apple\n\n*\n\n*Finder: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210598 \\\n\n*iTunes: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201301\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2015 Fan Issues I have a refurbished 2015 MacBook Pro 13\", Intel i7 Processor, 16GB RAM and 512 SSD. When I first began using it I noticed it got unusually hot rather often, and so I downloaded Macs Fan Control to keep tabs on it. But whenever I do anything remotely resource intensive, for example playing music or using a virtual environment or using Xcode or VSCode, the CPU gets to temperatures over 100 degrees celsius. This is concerning and I believe it may have made the computer reboot a time or two, though that may have been something else. I am able to control it by keeping tabs on it but it is rather annoying and very worrying that the temperature gets that high. Are there any reasons why it does this?\n\nA: Those temps are most likely fine.\nMBP models usually range from about 40ºC (104ºF) to 100ºC (212ºF) depending on whether the CPU is idle or under load. CPU temps (just like ambient temperatures) typically have a bearing on GPU temps too, especially within the extremely confined spaces of a MacBook Pro.\nIf you'd like, you can refer to the Intel Mac Temperature Database to see the various temperature ranges reported by users. You can also filter the list by model etc.\nIf you're still concerned, you can reset the System Management Controller (SMC).\nThe SMC is basically a chip in Intel-based Macs that manages many of the physical aspects of your Mac. This includes power buttons, LED indicators, cooling fans, how your Mac works in its various sleep modes, and so on.\nBecause the SMC is a sub-system of your Mac, it is not dependent on an operating system being installed.\nYou may be interested in reading Reset the System Management Controller (SMC) on your Mac for further info and instructions on how to reset it.\n", "Q: Facetime overloading my computer's scheduler Running Mac OSX High Sierra 10.13.6.\nMany times when I'm on a facetime call, and when doing other video things, my whole computer gets hangy about 15 minutes in.

Looked at it in Activity Monitor, but couldn't find any one culprit.  I copied the console logs from that hour, and I'll look through it for more info.  Just wanted to get the question started.\n\nA: I believe your MacBook is overheating, which will lead to throttling (automatic downclocking) of your CPU and GPU. While most Intel-based MacBooks do suffer from that to a certain extent, it shouldn't be triggered by a 15-minute FaceTime call.\n\n*\n\n*When using Activity Monitor.app, make sure to have View → All Processes enabled, so system processes are shown as well.\n\n\n*You may use the app iStat Menus or Hardware Monitor to check the temperatures of your MacBook.\n\n\n*It's possible that your MacBook is just dusty, which prevents proper airflow and therefore limits cooling.

Now in big sur I'm finding pdfs fairly often that don't allow me to copy text unless I have a password.  Is there a way to prevent preview from doing this or do I need to find a different pdf reader?  It's incredibly frustrating to have to re-type text from a pdf if I want to google something I just read.\n\nA: AFAIK, Preview has respected the security features of the PDF standard for a long time, so I don't understand/agree with the answer in the other question.**\nA document that has been restricted must have the password supplied to be either printed, and/or copied, and/or opened. Preview itself can add security restrictions to saved PDFs. The security is baked into the PDFKit API that Preview and other macOS PDF utilities use.\n(As far back as OS X Tiger, it was an open secret that ColorSync Utility would ignore security, letting you save a 'clean' version, but this has long been fixed. Even then, Preview respected security.)\nHowever, I would say that 99.9% of PDFs in the wild are not restricted, so it's curious that you say 'fairly often', unless you're mining a reserve of PDFs that the authors expressly don't want you to copy for some reason. You could try contacting the authors and asking for permission: it's conceivable they may have added the protection against copying by mistake.\nNeedless to say, no DRM protection is impregnable, and there are several scripts and apps devoted to removing copy protections from PDFs. The simplest method is that if you can print it, then you can 're-print' the document as a new PDF.\nAt worst, you could use OCR software on a screenshot.\n** As for the other question, the method by which images are 'lifted' from the PDF is not explicitly stated, and that may be different from copy/pasting text.\n\nA: There's probably not a realistic way to get preview to ignore the owner password, but it is fairly easy to just remove it.

I use zsh\nPS: I don't know what I'm doing, so I will really appreciate a detailed response\n\nA: I got the same issue, It took me long enough to understand that it is simple to resolve.\nDuring the installation of brew, we are supposed to execute this comand\necho 'eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)' >> $HOME/.zprofile\nI still remember I executed this command more than once, because of which the path is stored multiple times in .zprofile  file.\n\nWhen I deleted the first and second line using vim editor vim .zprofile\nI was able to get rid of those annoying pop up messages.\n\nA: Each default shell (the program that runs inside the terminal application) has two startup files.\nIf you look at the steps you performed when you set up homebrew, it asked you to modify those startup files. There is a syntax error or unintended side effect of the directions you followed to customize the files to prepare the homebrew environment. Look for lines containing eval or shellenv specifically.\n\n*\n\n*Take some time and change each line looks like it matches those strings - or systematically delete lines you think you understand what they do from your startup file and then test. Make one change, save the file, test. This is the path of learning your way out of this mess. This also could break your shell - so all manner of breakage can happen with an error in your startup scripts (or worse a loop).\n\n*Throw away the startup files - go slower or with someone as you edit the shell startup files using brew doctor as guidance. This is safer if you don’t really know what you’re doing editing the files.\n\nThis “situation” happens to about 95% of the people learning how to set up a shell, so you might choose to pair up with someone that can work with you and show you the ropes or find a guided intro that explains how to debug your shell startup files. Eventually everyone breaks their environment with copypasta - even if the instructions were not malicious.\nTo clear the deck, if you know your backup of this Mac is current, just move the files to /tmp (kind of a junk drawer for shell files) and the log out (Apple Menu - log out of your entire graphical session) log in and try setting up your “dot files” again, slowly and making one line change at a time.\nmv ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile ~/.zprofile ~/.zshrc  /tmp\n\nFiles in /tmp clear at boot so it’s not a good place for long term storage. It is very temporary and not a backup.\nWhat that command does is move both bash and zsh startup files out of the way. I chose those two since they are the default shells covering recent macOS releases. If you chose a different shell or had setup already done, this will undo those settings.\nGood luck in this “choose your own adventure” situation - there’s no wrong choice (although not backing up is a radical choice for some), and welcome to the team that wraps their brain around the wonderful world of shell programming using the unix idiom of computing.\n", "Q: How to \"resize\" side-by-side windows SIMULTANEOUSLY on Mac? I recently switched from Windows to Mac M1 running Big Sur and can't find a feature that I had on my Windows Laptop.\nOn windows, I had AquaSnap installed, which has really nice features. One of those is that when windows were next to each other, I was able to resize the windows simultaneously when they were next to each other. E.g. when I want to make one app bigger and the other side smaller, I just pressed Ctrl while dragging one app to a side and both sides got resized.\nI found a video on YouTube where somebody did this on the Mac, but in the video, both apps went into full-screen mode (and obviously shared the space). However, my Mac does not behave like this (i.e. does not go into full-screen mode and also does not resize both apps simultaneously when resizing) and I think this behaviour was part of an earlier software version.\nIs there another (simple) possibility to activate this feature?\nIt is worth mentioning that on my Mac I have BetterSnapTools installed, but did not find such a feature there.\n\nA: Option 1: Native Split View in Big Sur\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have at least two windows on your desktop\n\n\n*Start by hovering your mouse over the green maximise button of one of these windows\n\n\n\n*Click on \"Tile Window to Left of Screen\"\n\n\n*Then, choose the other window, which should become the right part of your tiled window arrangement, by clicking on that window.\n\n\n\n*When you adjust the width of the left window, the right window will resize accordingly.\n\nTo learn more about Split View in macOS, have a look at this support document: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204948.\nOption 2: Tiling window manager\nIf you would like more configurations options, or you would like to extend this mechanism to more than two windows on one desktop, using a tiling window manager like yabai would be an option.\nFor example, if a couple of windows are on one desktop using yabai, resizing one of the windows makes the other windows adjust their sizes accordingly.\n\n\nyabai is a window management utility that is designed to work as an extension to the built-in window manager of macOS. yabai allows you to control your windows, spaces and displays freely using an intuitive command line interface and optionally set user-defined keyboard shortcuts using skhd and other third-party software.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the homebrew package manager\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\n\n\n*Install yabai\nbrew install yabai\n\n\n\n*Adjust the configuration in ~/.yabairc if needed to customise the tiling behaviour.\n# ~/.yabairc\nyabai -m config window_placement             second_child\nyabai -m config window_topmost               off\nyabai -m config window_shadow                on\nyabai -m config window_opacity               on\nyabai -m config window_opacity_duration      0.0\nyabai -m config active_window_opacity        1.0\nyabai -m config normal_window_opacity        0.90\nyabai -m config window_border                on\nyabai -m config window_border_width          6\nyabai -m config active_window_border_color   0xff775759\nyabai -m config normal_window_border_color   0xff555555\nyabai -m config insert_feedback_color        0xffd75f5f\nyabai -m config split_ratio                  0.38\nyabai -m config auto_balance                 on\nyabai -m config mouse_modifier               fn\nyabai -m config mouse_action1                move\nyabai -m config mouse_action2                resize\nyabai -m config mouse_drop_action            swap\n\nyabai -m config layout                       bsp\nyabai -m config top_padding                  12\nyabai -m config bottom_padding               12\nyabai -m config left_padding                 12\nyabai -m config right_padding                12\nyabai -m config window_gap                   16\n\nHave a look at this wiki to learn more about the tiling-configuration options.\n", "Q: Problem with disk repair I have HDD connected to my Mac which is formatted with HFS and I use for backups.\nI have noticed a problem while running fdisk and fsck_hfs:\nsudo fsck_hfs -rd /dev/disk1s1\nPassword:\njournal_replay(/dev/disk1s1) returned 0\n** /dev/rdisk1s1\n    Using cacheBlockSize=32K cacheTotalBlock=65536 cacheSize=2097152K.\n   Executing fsck_hfs (version hfs-522.100.5).\n** Checking Journaled HFS Plus volume.\n   The volume name is Backup\n** Checking extents overflow file.\n** Checking catalog file.\n** Rebuilding catalog B-tree.\nBlockFindAll:  found 1489232 blocks but needed 1572864\n   Disk full error\n** The volume Backup could not be repaired.\n    volume type is pure HFS+ \n    primary MDB is at block 0 0x00 \n    alternate MDB is at block 0 0x00 \n    primary VHB is at block 2 0x02 \n    alternate VHB is at block 1953521662 0x74705ffe \n    sector size = 512 0x200 \n    VolumeObject flags = 0x07 \n    total sectors for volume = 1953521664 0x74706000 \n    total sectors for embedded volume = 0 0x00 \n    CheckHFS returned 8, fsmodified = 0\n\nThe disk is not full.\nIs there anything I can which does not involve reformatting or buying a new disk?\nIt's a WD Red 1TB about 5 years old.

I've clean installed OSX and many other OSses before and am quite comfortable installing OSes.\nI'm on an older OS X version and some updated applications I use are now 10.15 or higher.  There's only one OSX install on the drive and I don't want to dual-boot the system.\nSince one APFS partition is now mandatory for the System Partition, I would like to meet the mandatory requirement.

I think you can go all in with APFS and use an attached external HDD and Time Machine to limit your performance impact. If at such time you eventually have a slow system, you can reset that fragmentation by an erase install. This assumes no utility will get upgraded to help you with optimization, you’ll still have an out with Apple only tools.\n\nBig Sur makes design assumptions that the user data is on APFS so you may regret forcing it to accommodate HFS+ storage both in the steps needed to set it up and the performance of the system in the end.\nIf you don’t trust APFS, don’t run Big Sur except for in virtualization as a guest OS is my recommendation - stick with older OS and tools you trust.\nDetailing all the “bugs” and debunking them would make a wonderful masters thesis to set this up and document how it performs, but even as a hobby, I couldn’t imagine learning enough from this to make it worth the hassle.

I was wondering if someone can please help me figure it our what to do.\nI followed the instruction on the official website (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/uninstall/) plus some other guides, but I'm note an expert and I didn't reach my goal.  That's what I did:\n1) conda install anaconda-clean\n2) anaconda-clean --yes\n3) rm -rf ~/.condarc ~/.conda ~/.continuum\n4) rm -rf ~/anaconda\n5) conda remove -n myenv scipy\n                         *PackagesNotFoundError\n6) conda remove scipy\n7) conda remove scipy curl\n                         *PackagesNotFoundError\n8) rm -rf ~/anaconda3\n9) rm -rf ~/.anaconda_backup\n10) export PATH=”/Users/MYUSERNAME/anaconda3/bin:$PATH\n\n\n\n*At the end I've deleted the application throwing it in the trash and emptying it.\n\nI'm not sure I did the right steps, maybe you can give me some advice. However, I didn't delete everything because I have still a folder in /opt path, /opt/anaconda3. I'm sure another folder was in /user/MYNAME, but I think I've deleted it, because I can't see it anymore, even in the hidden folders.\nThen, if I run\nconda list\n\nlots of other packages are still available:\n# packages in environment at /opt/anaconda3:\n#\n# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel\n_ipyw_jlab_nb_ext_conf    0.1.0                    py37_0  \nanaconda-clean            1.1.0            py37hecd8cb5_1  \nanaconda-client           1.7.2                    py37_0  \n[...] \nzlib                      1.2.11               h1de35cc_3  \nzstd                      1.4.5                h41d2c2f_0\n\nAlso, conda still run in my terminal as I see (base) every time I open it, here an example:\n(base) MYUSERNAME@MacBook ~ %\n\nI also post the content inside .bash_profil, because maybe It can be related with \"my terminal (base) problem\":\n# >>> conda initialize >>>\n# !!

In your case /opt/anaconda\nYou can find out the correct path by running conda info before starting to remove things  The entry for base environment shows you the directory to remove.\nTo remove the entries from your shell first note that your step 10 is NOT what the uninstall doc says. The doc says look for a line like that and then edit to remove it. However for more confusion the doc does not cover the normal new updates to .bash_profile . You have to remove the section starting with # >>> conda initialize >>> and ending with # <<< conda initialize <<<\nSo I think (I have not tested as I need conda) the steps are\n\n*\n\n*Run conda info and note the base environment\n\n*conda install anaconda-clean\n\n*anaconda-clean --yes\n\n*rm -rf ~/.condarc ~/.conda # I think 3 might do this\n\n*rm -rf <the value found in step 1>\n\n*Edit your shell startup files to both remove any entry altering your path for conda and also the parts in the conda initialise section\n\n*When you have tested all remove the backup directory shown in the doc\n\n\nA: This is a specific example of a common problem. Installers and applications that spray files and detritus all over the filesystem and rely on users to run many scripts, all changing weekly with version upgrades quickly becomes an intractable problem. You should be able to reclaim the 5 GB of space easily without worrying about some stub files and mostly empty config files.\n\nOpen the Terminal.app or iTerm2 terminal application, and then remove your entire Anaconda directory, which has a name such as anaconda2, anaconda3, or ~/opt. Enter rm -rf ~/anaconda3 to remove the directory.\n\nIf you’ve deleted the main program and the main folders (which I repeat above), I would say you’re good. Set up Time Machine so you’re backing up going forward and next time you want to install similar tool chains and environments, be sure you have a backup so you can roll back if that install gives poor results. Unless there’s a large file lying around you won’t gain anything cleaning up hundreds of files and other tools let you find folders and large files to clean them together.\n\nIn the unlikely event you have some issue caused by the leftover files, it’s less complicated and less time consuming to erase and reinstall a Mac and get your documents and apps reinstalled than it is to reconstruct what anaconda installed and surgically reverse every remnant left on the filesystem.\nWorse, if you rm the wrong thing, you may delete more than you bargained for.\n\n*\n\n*How can I make 'rm' move files to the trash can?\nA safer bet is to substitute open for rm and you do need to recognize -rf or any flags passed to rm and delete them. Use the command line to open the folders rather than removing them is my advice if you don’t get exactly the syntax of the commands you are copy and paste into terminal.

I have a Mac Mini 2018 with a 2T SSD.\nI've started to notice a few files getting corrupted, and an I/O error being reported when I try to access them.\nI've run Disk Utility, and nothing bad shows up either running in recovery or normal mode.\nThe worry I have is that the SSD is degrading, but I'm not sure how to confirm my suspicion.\nHow do I tell if my SSD is dying? Or is there some other cause?\n\nA: Disk drives (both HDD and SSD) keep counters relating to their activity.  These go by the collective name SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology).  macOS does not, by default, expose any of these counters.\nThe GUI based app for showing these is DriveDX which has a free trial period.  The installation is a little unusual as it involves the installation of a kernel extension that reads the SMART data.  As well as presenting drive information it includes guidance as to what the counters mean and which are important for drive lifespan and errors.\nIf you are comfortable using Terminal, you can install smartmontools which uses the same kernel extension as DriveDX and reports the same information but not to so pretty and without any interpretation.  The install is easiest using Homebrew.  If you are not familiar with Homebrew, use DriveDX.\nWarning: The key weakness with reading SMART counters on macOS is that it depends on a kernel extension which is some years old and has no developer support. This is most of an issue with recent versions of macOS (particularly Big Sur). BinaryFruit (the makers of DriveDX) have packaged it (with signatures, etc.) so that it installs with as little fuss as possible, but they do not seem to be doing anything for long term support except for keeping their help pages current.\nEdit: That may be somewhat unfair on BinaryFruit as I see they have released a version of the kernel extension for Apple Silicon Macs.\n\nA: From the comments you have given here work the I/O errors, you’re looking at a disk or controller or cabling failure. In this case it is almost certainly a disk failure in progress.\nYou want to stop using the computer immediately and ensure that you have backups of everything. Then replace the disk and restore from backups.\nIn this case, do not rely on SMART status at all. This status can say that the disk is perfectly fine when it is definitely not, and you could risk further data loss this way.\n", "Q: WINE starting an application I built WINE from source, following their INSTALL.UNIX file, so I start wine via Terminal, a UI appears:\n\nMicrosoft Windows 6.1.7601\nZ: \\Users\\USER\\Downloads\\wine-4.20>\n\nso I write\n\nstart \"\\Users\\USER\\Downloads\\PROGRAM.exe\"\n\nit gives the output\n\nFile not found.\n\nso I suspect it may be a permission thing, I go to \"Security & Privacy\" settings and give permission to everything I can in the wine-4.20 folder.\nI can't fix it\nAm I doing something wrong?\nEDIT:\nWell my own answer fixed it, except apparently I need to install Wine Mono\n\nA: You need to write /unix as a flag, as you are one a Mac.

But this is life, and I have to run the apps which I don't trust, otherwise I can not work and live in my society.\n\nA: \n\n*\n\n*Open the .dmg file (basically mount it), double click the app to launch it directly.\n\n*Drag it to somewhere else (user space folder) other than the default Applications folder which requires root permission.\n\n*Drag it to the default Applications to install it.\n\nI am wondering if I choose Option 1, can I say it's much safer way than the Option 3?\n\nNone of these methods provide additional protection. If the application intends to do harm, nothing in the options above will stop the harm being done.\nIf you do not trust an application, the source, or the developers, do not run the application.\nIf you must run an untrusted application, consider a constrained runtime environment such as a virtual machine. You mention performance rules out the use of a virtual machine; this is a security trade off.\nIf a virtual machine is not possible, create a separate non-administrator user account and only run the application using that account.

Be it by accessing macOS utilities's Disk Utility section or the \"Install a previous OSX\" one, my internal storage just isn't listed at all.\nThis is particularly weird given that the computer is working fine, and whenever I access the regular OSX's disk utility, my internal storage unit is being listed properly. Not only that, but the computer is working properly, so I know for a fact that it is no hardware issue that is causing it. I wouldn't even have discovered this issue hadn't I had to reformat this computer.\nDoes anyone have a clue on how can I get Macos utilities to properly track my internal SSD?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: If my suspicion is correct, your Mac boots to an older version of macOS Recovery and Disk Utility of that older version doesn't know APFS, so it just hides the partition.\nFirst, make sure that View → Show All Devices is selected in Disk Utility. With this enabled, all drives should be visible – regardless if Disk Utility knows how to handle the filesystem. This should at least allow you to format the drive.\nYou may also try Internet Recovery. If you're starting your Mac with the keys ⌥⌘R held down until the Apple logo, it should boot into the latest macOS Recovery compatible with your Mac. From there, you should see all partitions and be able to reinstall the most recent compatible version of macOS.\n", "Q: Slow transfer between two external drives Copying data to a USB external drive is much slower than expected.\nI have a 6TB external RAID drive that holds my photos, and I'm trying to do an archive copy of this data to another external USB drive.\nBoth are HDD drives, formatted with HFS+. I have turned off the Spotlight indexing for both drives. I'm using a MacBookPro with fast USB-C ports, and USB 3.0 or better ports on both external drives. All cables are 3.0 (SS) cables or better.\nThe file transfer started at about 200MB/s then slowed to around 20MB/s and sometimes even less. I'm using the Activity Monitor - Disk  to display the read/write speed.\nI think the initial transfer speed was the write buffers on the target drive filling up. I'm expecting a real-life transfer speed for USB 3.0 to be around 100MB/s.\nAny idea why this is running so slowly. How can I figure out the bottleneck?\nJim\n\nA: Assuming there is no fault with any hardware or software, the following are some of the major factors that can contribute to a copy speed proceeding slower than the maximum transfer speed that a hard drive is capable of:\n\n*\n\n*Copying large numbers of small files with a single-threaded copying process...\nThe overhead of simply opening each file for reading and creating each file for writing plus updating the HFS+ file system metadata takes extra time, which can slow single-threaded copy processes like drag-and-drop in the Finder considerably from this extra file system overhead. Some utilities such as the command-line tool rsync can speed up this process by pre-fetching files into its own memory buffer then writing the files to the destination drive from this buffer, thereby reducing the effect somewhat.  Some third-party tools such as SuperDuper!, Beyond Compare, and others also perform some of this buffering to try and speed the file copy process but regardless of the utility used, copying large numbers of small files will naturally result in a lower overall throughput than if large files were being copied, due to this extra file system overhead.\n\n*Copying large files from a hard drive with a severely fragmented file system...\nCopying at the file-level will open the file on the source drive then copy that file from beginning-to-end to the destination drive, but the file may not be stored contiguously on the source hard drive. In that case, the hard drive read-write head may have to seek to many different areas of the disk in order to read the file in-order, slowing file transfer considerably.  This is more common for files that have changed a lot on disk over the years, and not so much for archival files that were created on the drive once then left (like photos) so this is probably not the case here.\n\n*Copying files from a newer shingled-magnetic-recording (SMR) hard drive...\nThe newest SMR hard drives cannot directly read the area on the drive that the HFS+ file system says contains the file.  It must first read an entire track all the way around the disk, then pull out the portion of the data from that track that contains the file data that was requested. This is especially detrimental to copy speed as it mimics the above \"fragmented hard drive\" example, except it ensures that nearly every file behaves as if it is \"fragmented\" so unless you are copying the files off of the drive in the exact same order that they were all created, you will encounter severe slow down in copy speed.

Given that SMS security is a dumpster fire, this seems unwise, and I'd like to disable the feature. However, I'd still like to have a fallback if an authorized Apple device isn't available for 2FA. You'd think that's what a recovery code would be for, but I can't seem to find a path to access my Apple ID by using my recovery code instead of an authorized device.\n\nA: Unfortunately you cannot disable the feature.\nYour best bet is keeping the number used completely private. I.e. do not use your main phone number for this - use a number specifically reserved for 2FA codes so that this phone number is not shared with others.\nAlso I would like to point out that the loophole described in the link you have included has actually been closed shortly after that article was written through a collaboration between T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T.\nHowever it is still true that if you have some other means of providing a second factor than SMS, then you should definitely go for that instead.

In MacOS Big Sur, I figured out an app (downloaded from internet) normally can not access ~/Downloads/, ~/Documents/, ~/Desktop/ folders directly. When it tries to access those folders at the first time, there will be a popup window to ask for permission and the permission can be setup in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Files and Folders.\nEdited: It seems my bad description makes people confused (sorry about my English). I will put two screenshots here to clarify what I mean:\n\nThe above screenshot appears when the app iTerm2 tries to access ~/Downloads folder at the first time in Big Sur. (basically when I execute ls ~/Downloads/ commands in iTerm2)\n\nThe above screenshot is where I can change the folders privacy setup.\nBut, today, I downloaded an app (it's a downloading tool) and installed it by dragging it to /Applications folder. (the same way I installed iTerm2) I tried to use that tool to download a file to ~/Downloads folder and the file can be downloaded and written to ~/Downloads folder directly without any permission requirement. It can also display/read all the files in the ~/Downloads folder. I checked the Privacy setup in System Preferences and it does NOT have that app setup too.\nI am very confused how can that app read/write the file to ~/Downloads without requiring a privacy permission on the protected folder. I thought those protected folders were protected and were not allowed to be read/write before granting privacy permission. But I was wrong.\n(Note that, later I found out Google Chrome App can read/write those protected folders too without asking this privacy permission. File > Open File > Choose any files inside the three protected folders)\nPS1: I haven't mentioned the \"downloading tool app\" name here because that is a non-English app. If anyone consider I should give the name to get a better help, just let me know. Thanks.\nPS2: This is a fresh install of MacOS Big Sur. (Not a upgraded system)\nPS3: The \"downloading tool app\" is a GUI app. (NOT a CML app).\nPS4: I just find out the Google Chrome.app downloaded from https://chrome.google.com can write to (save file to) ~/Downloads/ folder directly without requiring any privacy permission too. This is weird. Why does iTerm, Code and VLC require privacy permission to do any read/write to those protected folders but google chrome does NOT need to require anything.\n\nA: I’m not sure I fully follow all the PS, but when you download the tool in the first place and execute or move the file, you are granting entitlements for the download folder and clearing the quarantine flags on the app signaling that the app can run.\nApple designed this to warn people when they didn’t intentionally run an app so the friction is for unintentional downloads is how I interpret why Apple designed it thusly.\nYou may need a session with someone to pick apart every step and evaluate each program closely to get a specific answer, but generally downloaded apps behave differently than ones the App Store installs with respect to sandbox and entitlement warnings.\n", "Q: Apple ID: How to avoid changing password?

But I want an Automator application that saves the text from clipboard to a GIVEN text file (by editing it, i.e. adding in the next line). Applescript would be okay too. Is there a way to do this?\n\nA: You could use an Automator workflow/application using a Run Shell Script action with:\n/usr/bin/pbpaste >> '/path/to/filename.txt'\necho >> '/path/to/filename.txt'\n\n\nNotes:\nCheck out the manual page for: pbpaste\nYou can read the manual page for command in Terminal by typing command and then right-click on it and select: Open man Page\nThe echo >> '/path/to/filename' line adds a single line feed to the end of the file after the pasted text. You can add addition lines for more line feeds if you so choose.\nIn place of the echo command you can also use, e.g.:\nprintf '\\n' >> '/path/to/filename.txt'\n\nAdding additional \\n for more line feeds, e.g. '\\n\\n'.\nIf you update the file while it's opened, it is not doing to show the updated contents, you need to close/reopen the file to see additional updates to it.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to do it with AppleScript, then in place of the Run Shell Script action, use a Run AppleScript action with the following example AppleScript code wish uses a slightly modified handler from Reading and Writing Files:\nset myFilename to (path to documents folder) & \"Clipboard Text.txt\"\n\nset cbText to ((the clipboard) as text) & linefeed & linefeed\n\nwriteTextToFile(cbText, myFilename, false)\n\n\non writeTextToFile(theText, theFile, overwriteExistingContent)\n    try\n        -- Convert the file to a string\n        set theFile to theFile as string\n        -- Open the file for writing\n        if theFile contains \"/\" then\n            set theOpenedFile to open for access theFile with write permission\n        else\n            set theOpenedFile to open for access file theFile with write permission\n        end if\n        -- Clear the file if content should be overwritten\n        if overwriteExistingContent is true then set eof of theOpenedFile to 0\n        -- Write the new content to the file\n        write theText to theOpenedFile starting at eof\n        -- Close the file\n        close access theOpenedFile\n        -- Return a boolean indicating that writing was successful\n        return true\n        -- Handle a write error\n    on error\n        -- Close the file\n        try\n            close access file theFile\n        end try\n        -- Return a boolean indicating that writing failed\n        return false\n    end try\nend writeTextToFile\n\n\nNotes:\nThe handler from the linked Apple support document was modified to handle both POSIX and HFS+ file paths.\n", "Q: Missed calls on lock screen iPhone 11 Pro I don't mind seeing the missed call notification, but the instant redial feature results in too many unwanted calls -- like returning spam and political calls I didn't want in the first place.

Yes, I'd like to see what missed call the notification is referring to, but I'll forgo that luxury if it means I instantly return the call.\nTIA\n\nA: Notification bodies are protected on the lock screen by default. You don't need to tap the notification to see what the message in the notification is; in fact, that causes the redial.\nWhen you get a notification that just says ‘Notification’, look at your device to unlock it.

I have a webserver running under the 0.0.0.0 address, bound to a given port - let's call it 8080. By using 0.0.0.0 as the host address, I can successfully access my webserver from the iPad using my computer's network IP (192.168.100.5).\nTurns out my server has some redirections pointing to 0.0.0.0:port, and 0.0.0.0 is unknown to my iPad. One idea I had is to make the iPad interpret 0.0.0.0 as 192.168.100.5, but after some thorough research, I couldn't find successful answers on how to do that.\nSo here I am: how can I make an iPad, using Safari, to interpret 0.0.0.0 as 192.168.100.5?\nA parallel example would be, every time I access http://whatever, I'd like my browser (Safari) to access https://google.com or something.\n\nA: There's no IP address named 0.0.0.0. Therefore you cannot be running a web server on that address, and that is the reason why your iPad cannot open such an address.\nYou might be confused because when programming, it is usually possible to specify that you want to bind for example port 8080 on 0.0.0.0. However in that case, 0.0.0.0 is not an address - it is a specific non-address values that means that indicates to the operating system that you want to bind port 8080 on any network interface (i.e. on all the IP-addresses on your computer).\nThe problem here is not with the iPad. Instead you have a misconfiguration on your server that has caused it to send out redirections to 0.0.0.0. Those redirections are invalid in themselves. Ordinarily servers like that are by default setup to redirect to the same IP address that the user accessed the server by initially.\n", "Q: Recycling a damaged Late 2015 into a late 2013 MBP Retina Normally I work on pcs, not macs so I'm not real sure of my options but I'm trying to help a girl out.\nShe has two MBP, a late model 2013 (8GB Ram) and a late model 2015 (16GB Ram). The 2013 has a bad speaker and the keyboard has a few keys that no longer type but otherwise is in perfectly fine working order. She uses a wireless keyboard which she says \"...is cumbersome to travel with.\"\nThe 2015 has seen better days, the case has more dents and dings than a golf ball and is acting up (powers off, the cooling fan is LOUD, battery only lasts 45 minutes, and missing a few screws from the bottom of the case so the touchpad doesn't always recognize taps, and there are two lines going horizontal on the retina display).\nShe wants to know if the processor, ram, and keyboard from the 2015 could be moved to the 2013 laptop or would the performance be marginal between these two systems?\n\nA: Generally speaking no.\nMost Mac laptops before the last couple of generations could only upgrade the RAM. Some you could upgrade the storage with a different drive or SSD module.\nI know, heresy, to most Windows PC technicians but the fact is all current generation Mac laptops have zero upgradable parts. No RAM, No HD/SSD, no Processor, GPU or anything else. It's all integrated to the system board. And replacement means you have a talent for replacing surface mounted parts.\nYou can get info on what is what on the Macs in front of you at the excellent\nhttps://everymac.com\nThey have all the specs for all the Macs down to whether or not you can replace, RAM, HD/SSD, GPU, etc.\nAnd for a good place to find out how to replace/repair those bits that are repairable/replaceable, there is the wonderful\nhttps://www.ifixit.com\nWith lots of pictures and HowTos on replacing and repairing a whole raft of Macs and other Apple Devices, not to mention lots of other computer equipment and electronic devices.\nSome of what you want to do may be possible.

Update: I can't answer as the question is closed (interesting enough I have received a badge for the popular question for the question that was closed). But I have found new info that Big Sur doesn't send to the web sites in UserArgent that it is the version 11.00 as Apple expected problems with web site compatibility. As such there can't be any data originated from the web sites and as most currently published data originates from that source it is likely that there won't be any data on this.\nI can't find any data on Big Sur market share among Mac versions.\nThe only source that covers this is https://gs.statcounter.com/macos-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide\nHowever on that source there is no data for Big Sur - if you download .csv you will see that all values add up to 100% and there is no 'Big Sur' or 'Other' category. I would assume that Big Sur has similar to what Catalina had in this period of year (41%) and that all other values should be corrected by multiplying with 59%.\nBut that is just a guess. Does anyone have any data? Including from his own site if nothing else just if it has at least 1k Mac users a month?\n\nA: In my experience data for macOS adoption (as opposed to iOS) is fraught with inconsistencies. Many sources just lump the different versions of macOS together in the one bucket. Others even lump macOS and iOS together in the same bucket. In some cases, the data is based on web traffic which is also fraught with difficulty (as the same version of browser can be installed on multiple versions of macOS).\nOne thing to keep in mind is the sale of new Mac hardware will include the latest version of macOS (e.g. the M1 Macs all come with macOS Big Sur pre-installed, etc).\nThe last figure1 I recall seeing of new Mac sales was  for the three month period ended 26 December 2020 (8,675,000 Macs, a big jump attributed mainly to M1 Macs). However, many new Mac sales occurred prior to the release of macOS Big Sur or the release of M1 Macs, so that figure will be a mixture of macOS Catalina and macOS Big Sur.\nHowever, the reason I mention Mac sales figures is because your post asks at the end about macOS Big Sur having \"at least 1k Mac users a month\" - which of course is well and truly below the millions it will be based on those sales figures.\nIn any case, over time sites like statcounter (which you've already referenced) and statista will include the latest version of macOS in their charts etc. And for most people, that is all they can really wait for or rely on in terms of these figures.\n1 Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Apple, 27 January 2021.\n", "Q: Connecting Asus ZenScreen MBC16 to Mid-2015 MacBook Pro I bought this nifty Asus ZenScreen to have a second monitor on the go. What could go wrong, right? Well, everything it seems. I am running High Sierra (10.13.6). The ZenScreen takes USB-C input with only one port. The first attempt was to connect via the USB side by downloading the DisplayLink UserAgent 4.3.1 driver. It seems that Apple doesn't want us to do that for some reason? I can connect and it will display a picture- but only a static one. As in, if I have a video playing, only a still image appears, and clicking in that extended desktop will only update to that next snapshot. (A video of this can be provided if need be.)\nNext, I tried HDMI to USB-C. And learned that HDMI does not provide power.\nThird, I purchased the seemingly overpriced Thunderbolt Cable and USB-C adapter, as the internet informed me that Thunderbolt does in fact provide power. Still no avail.\nNow I have a lovely paperweight and several cords that I don't need to boot. Any thoughts?\n\nA: Using an Asus ZenScreen should be fine. The only issues I've ever seen people have is that the auto sensing orientation feature (to switch between landscape and portrait modes) seems to be somewhat glitchy.\nConsidering you're on macOS High Sierra, you should be using the ASUS MB series driver v4.3.\nEven if you have already installed this, I would suggest downloading/installing it again. Once you do, go to Apple > System Preferences... > Security & Privacy.\nIf you're prompted to enter your credentials to unlock the Preference Pane, then enter them in.\nNext, check to see if you have a message at the bottom of the window asking you to allow use of the software (If so, you'll see an Allow button near the bottom right.

And the behavior is the same no matter if I use the Screen Sharing as the client on another Mac, or some third party VNC viewers on PC. While the Vine VNC Server does not have this issue and works perfectly.\nSo I wonder if there is a way to stop the system default VNC server from rendering the cursor of the remote machine. I have heard the rumors that the $80 Apple Remote Desktop can somehow configure this, but I haven't yet made the investment. Can someone confirm?\n\nA: It depends on where you take the screenshot.\nEven with Apple Remote Desktop if you invoke the screenshot on the local Mac it will include the cursor on the remote instance - which has no clue a screenshot is being taken.\nIf you invoke it on the remote instance the cursor will hide.\nIf the key commands are the same for both local & remote, then the local instance will launch in preference to the remote.\n", "Q: How does macOS detect keyboard?

What is the meaning? So, I am trying to understand my VPN connection observing the traffic in Little Snitch. My VPN is connected and I can see its connection to the server and the amount of data that is transfered. Shouldn't go all my data through this connection? Why is there, for example Firefox, connecting to a huge amount of IP-Adresses and sending/receiving a huge amount of data? When observing the map it looks like the connections start at my 'real location'. I looked up my IP on the browser and everything seems to be working fine.\nJust wanted to understand the causal chain of data flow for Example googling something in Firefox.\nThanks for your answers!\n\nA: A VPN is nothing more than a different connection to the internet. Without the VPN it looks like this:\nMac -> Local Network -> your Router -> your ISP -> the internet\nThis is vastly simplified, if course, but will work for what we are doing here.\nThe VPN is a TUNNEL that starts at your Mac and ends not at the network and servers of your ISP (AT&T, Spectrum, Verizon, etc.) but at the servers and networks of the VPN provider.\nMac -> VPN Tunnel -> (your Router) -> (your ISP) -> (Your VPN provider) ->the internet\nThat pathway above stays the same but it is like running a tube between your Mac and the internet in that your router, ISP and VPN provider, cant see what is in the VPN tunnel, as it is hidden by the VPN.\nAnd instead of your traffic exiting your ISP for the internet in your town, it exits the VPN provider's network anywhere you want it to. Prague, Milan, Mexico City, Vancouver, Miami, wherever they have \"exit points.\"\nThe key point here is that the VPN provides a secure tunnel between you and the end of the VPN. No one can spy on any traffic between those two points.\nBut everything on your Mac (or PC) still talks to everything that you point it to.\nSo if you browse the web using Firefox, it will still connect to every website you point it at. Not to mention all the cookies and tracking code that the website collects on you.\nYou are not being protected from what the website (and Firefox allows it to) does. You are being protected from being spied on between your Mac and the VPN exit point. And you can CHOOSE that end point. And Little Snitch still sees all of that activity, it is just going through the VPN. But it is still going.\nThe most common reason for a VPN is still my ability to connect back to my work network securely. The VPN creates a (virtual) tunnel (a private network) between my Mac or PC at home to my work network. This allows me onto that network as if I were sitting at my desk. And if I then google something the traffic exits from my work network and goes and connects to google.\nA personal VPN, like you have allows you to appear as if you are surfing the web from the next town, state, country or continent and no one can tell where you are actually from. So your ISP may be in in Dallas Texas but with the VPN it looks like you are in Vancouver, BC, Canada.\n\nA: No answer to your question, but a few safety tips on Little Snitch before you use it.\nLittle Snitch installs a kernel extension KEXT to read network traffic. This gives Little Snitch root privileges Little Snitch looks at all network traffic and is therefore vulnerable to any network traffic. The root rights promise big booty if successful: Full control over Little Snitch and the computer.\nIf you want to secure your system, you should not increase its attack surface, but reduce it. The less software that runs with root rights  the better.\nThis is a very unique Unix principle. If you mess up your system with 3rd party kexts, you can put an invitation label on the outside right away, because there are errors in every software The only way to minimize the risk is to run as little as possible under root.\nCan Little Snitch really control all traffic that goes out or comes in from the computer?\nDue to the principle: No! Why? All software on the computer can be compromised. Little Snitch isn't the only piece of code that runs under root on the Mac.\nA malware that also comes onto the computer as a Trojan or through a bug or in some other way, and also has root rights or gains these through another bug, can simply bypass Little Snitch, blind them at the necessary places, or deceive network traffic in front of Little Hide Snitch, make Litte Snitch completely useless.\nBut maybe some other software can't ...?\nNo! The only way to reliably control what the computer is doing with the network is to examine the traffic on the next router to the Internet. No firewall no software on the computer itself can tell you which traffic is really going in or out of your computer.\nWhat is Little Snitch good for then?\nTo review good-natured software that doesn't want to hide anything. An approach that runs on the victim's computer is completely unsuitable for checking malicious software\n", "Q: How do I check the memory usage from a certain time in macOs?

I ran across this comment which stated that it is possible to access the text in the macOS Terminal scrollback:\n\nFinding text in scrollback is a weakness of most terminal emulators; the only ones I know of that provide it are OS X Terminal and Terminator.\n\nI've done some searching, but I have not had any luck finding anything online saying how this can be done.\nThe reason I ask is that I'm looking for possible solutions to this Stack Overflow question, and am investigating whether there is a way to get text from the most recently run command in the macOS Terminal.\nFor this specific use case, I'm hoping to find the line(s) that match a particular pattern, so I can extract the matching text and pass it to the open command.\nThere were failing tests.

Bonus points if it's limited to just the ouptut of the last command, but I can make a workable solution to my problem if I can get the entire Terminal scrollback text.\n\nA: Assuming there is only one instance of the file:///.../index.html URL in the contents of the entire scrolling buffer of the tab, then the following example AppleScript code can do that:\ntell application \"Terminal\" to ¬\n    set tabHistory to ¬\n        history of tab of ¬\n        front window as text\n\nset fileURL to ¬\n    do shell script ¬\n        \"grep -o 'file:///.*\\\\.html' <<< \" & ¬\n        tabHistory's quoted form & \"; exit 0\"\n\nif fileURL is not \"\" then ¬\n    do shell script ¬\n        \"open \" & fileURL's quoted form\n\n\nNotes:\nThe example AppleScript code above acts on the selected tab of the front window in Terminal.\nIf there is a file:///.../index.html URL in the contents of the entire scrolling buffer it will be opened by the open command.\nIf there is more than one instance of the file:///.../index.html URL in the contents of the entire scrolling buffer of the tab, then make the following change in the example AppleScript code above to open the last instance of the file:///.../index.html URL:\nChange:\nset fileURL to ¬\n    do shell script ¬\n        \"grep -o 'file:///.*\\\\.html' <<< \" & ¬\n        tabHistory's quoted form & \"; exit 0\"\n\nTo:\nset fileURL to ¬\n    last paragraph of ¬\n    (do shell script ¬\n        \"grep -o 'file:///.*\\\\.html' <<< \" & ¬\n        tabHistory's quoted form & \"; exit 0\")\n\nIf you want to use Safari to open the URL and have it frontmost, then:\nChange:\nif fileURL is not \"\" then ¬\n    do shell script ¬\n        \"open \" & fileURL's quoted form\n\nTo:\nif fileURL is not \"\" then ¬\n    tell application \"Safari\"\n        make new document with properties {URL:fileURL}\n        activate\n    end tell\n\nThe example AppleScript code can be saved as a shell script with a #!/usr/bin/osascript shebang, made executable and run from Terminal.\n\nNote: The example AppleScript code is just that and sans any included error handling does not contain any additional error handling as may be appropriate. The onus is upon the user to add any error handling as may be appropriate, needed or wanted. Have a look at the try statement and error statement in the AppleScript Language Guide.

What is the extent of 'control'? Question\nMacOS Catalina - System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility\nWhat does granting 'control (of) your computer' include?\nThe following question from 2013 provides some very broad information:\nWhat does Security & Privacy/Accessibility enable?\nbut I would greatly appreciate any more specifics that people can provide.\n\nBackground\nEven if I trust an app now (no mean feat), there is always the possibility that it could suffer a supply-chain attack in the future.\nI would like to understand more about the damage that an app could do if I grant it access to my Mac.\n\nResearch\nI found the following page in the Apple Developer documentation:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/MacAutomationScriptingGuide/AutomatetheUserInterface.html\nIt seems like one example of 'control' could be for an app to instruct Safari to open a particular (malicious) website?\n\nA: As you saw in your research, the accessibility api allows one app to control other apps on your computer, in much the same way you do with your mouse and keyboard. These apps can resize windows, click buttons, type words, copy and paste, etc.\nIf you want an app to be able to do any of these things for you, you will need to grant access to the accessibility api (ie, \"allow it to control your computer\"). If you'd rather it not have that ability, or if there's no reason for it to have that ability, deny access.\nZoom is an example of an app that I do not allow to use the accessibility API.

Is there any setting that would allow the drive to be \"hot swapped\" (I'm assuming this isn't the correct term, but I'm unsure of a better one).\nI'm fine with decreased performance since the system would, I assume, not be allowed to have a cache that would need flushed when ejecting.\nIn reality this is a new Samsung T7 external SSD so it is unlikely that this would ever be an issue due to the speed of the read/writes, but I just hate having OSX throw that warning at me...\nSince it may be relevant I'm on Big Sur 11.2.3\n\nA: I would definitely recommend still unmounting (ejecting) the drive before disconnecting it, but you can actually make it so that writes are not buffered.\nYou do this by changing the mount options when mounting the external drive. You want to enable the \"noasync\" and \"sync\" options. This means that both data and metadata operations happen synchronously - i.e. the operating system waits for a write operation to complete before it lets the application continue.\nNote that this comes with drawbacks - and still isn't a guarantee against data loss:\nThe synchronous nature of things means that you will experience some slowdown in the programs writing to the disk drive. For backup purposes that probably isn't so bad. The slowdown is less severe with SSDs than with traditional hard drives, but it is still there.\nThe writes being synchronous also mean that they're serialized (i.e. performed in order). If you have a program that is often writing to the same location with different data (for example a program updating a counter on disk) - this could lead to more writes to the actual disk. With asynchronous writes, a newer write could cancel an older, not-yet-performed write to the same location. This effectively speeds things up and reduces the number of writes to the disk. For SSDs this is the same as reducing wear of the drive.\nFinally, you're still not guaranteed against data loss yet - for two main reasons:\nA write might still be taking place or about to take to place when you're disconnecting the drive. If the program doing the write is not written to be resilient against \"disconnections\", you might end up in a situation where the application performed only part of a scheduled number of writes - and when the data is read in again, this creates an illegal state in the program. I.e. writes A and B depend on each other, and you're not supposed to have a situation with A performed without B or vice versa.\nPrograms do generally not take care to avoid such situations. You'll find that sort of support in for example many database systems - even in \"small\" systems such as SQLite, which thankfully is being used as a backing storage for many apps today.\nThe second main reason is that often the drives themselves contain a write buffer. Historically, cheaper consumer drives would often just stop working the instant power is lost - and the data in the write buffer would be lost. This would effectively negate the efforts you have made to ensure the operating system does not have a data buffer.\nTraditionally this would be avoided on server systems by having a disk controller with a battery backed write cache - ensuring that as long as power was restored within the next 24-48 hours, the uncompleted writes would be performed when power is restored.\nOn SSDs today many will come with a supercapacitor (you can think of this as a kind of self-charging battery) that ensures that the disk always have power to complete the writes in progress when power is lost. However, some do not - and consumers brands usually do not advertise whether or not they have this feature.\n", "Q: Explanation /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\" I would like to understand exactly what this command does.

However, their web site could be compromised in the future, where this command no longer performs as intended.\nAlso in general it is a good idea to not learn a habit of just cut-n-pasting commands like this to install software.\nA security conscious way of handling this situation would be to download the install.sh file to your computer first. Then you need to read it through and understand what it does - and only then run it. Note that it is not a good idea to merely browse the install.sh file in a browser to determine that it is okay, as it is actually possible for a malicious server to detect whether or not you're browsing the script in a browser, or actually downloading to immediately execute it - and they could swap out the contents underneath you.\nThe main problem here is ofcourse that few people will know how to read and understand shell scripts.\n\nA: *\n\n*/bin/bash executes a new instance of bash\n\n*-c passes one or several commands to be executed\n\n*$(...) runs the command within () and returns its result (Command Substitution)\n\n*curl ... gets the file specified in the URL\n\nSo basically bash gets called to execute the content of the file fetched by curl.\nSome things you may try to understand this in more detail\n\n*\n\n*run curl ... to see what curl returns, or curl ... | less to examine it in more detail\n\n*run /bin/bash -c 'echo \"Welcome to bash\"'\n\n*read man bash and man curl\n", "Q: See when a macOS application accesses the clipboard?

I have a Time Machine created sparsebundle (HFS+) that reports the following limits when using hdiutil resize -limits:\n min     cur     max \n403186088   403186088   34359738368\n\nThat's a current size of 206 GB and a max of 17.5 TB. I draw the conclusion that I don't need to hdiutil resize the sparsebundle to allow it to expand. The host volume has an additional 200 GB free, so the bundle should therefore be able to expand about 100% -- however:\n\n*\n\n*Disk utility reports free space as 1 GB\n\n*Time Machine reports free space as 1 GB\n\nI expected them to detect 200 GB of free space available on the host volume. This is a problem since Time Machine will start deleting backups prematurely.\nHow do I make the sparsebundle expand when necessary to fill available space on the host file system?\nSome additional questions that came up that could help to narrow it down:\n\n*\n\n*Which part of the system is responsible for expanding the bundle when required? Does Time Machine do this explicitly or is it done transparently underneath it? I.e. is this a problem with Time Machine or with something more fundamental?\n\n*Is there a more reliable way to check whether Time Machine has/will run out of space than to look at the \"free space\" figure in Time Machine settings? I.e. can the numbers be trusted? I did remove and add the bundle as a backup destination with tmutil setdestination before checking free space.\n\n*If Time Machine is explicitly responsible for expanding a sparsebundle used as a backup target, will it only do this when it itself mounts the sparsebundle as a step of a networked backup? In other words, when taking the networked drive and plugging it in locally with USB3, and then manually mounting the sparsebundle, would Time Machine just skip the step where it usually expands the sparsebundle target since the bundle is now considered local storage (which doesn't generally use sparsebundles)?\n\nMacOS Mojave 10.14.6\n\nUpdate\nThere are several subtle reasons that combine into why I think my sparsebundle doesn't expand automatically, and why I form the null hypothesis that the free space reported by Time Machine is not erroneous. They include:\n\n*\n\n*I have no good reason to assume that the reported number in Time Machine and Disk Utility UI is erroneous. Conversely, I have been given no explicit assurances that the target volume will expand, nor to what extent.\n\n*Time Machine has to my recollection failed previously to expand the sparsebundle target that it was backing up to, despite lots of available space on the host volume.\n\n*Apple's track record of design suggests to me that if they only expose a single figure (remaining space available) in the Time Machine UI for me to base my decisions on with regards to what actions TM will take in turn, that it would've been removed already if it were an unreliable figure. I don't count the use of sparsebundles (i.e. networked backup) as such a small corner case as to warrant that level of unreliability to be ignored in their UI design phase.\n\n*When the drive is used as a network target, TM seems to report ~200/400 GB available, while attached as a local backup target it will report ~200/200 GB available. A locally mounted sparsebundle is also not showing up in the \"add target\" UI in TM, but has to be added using tmutil. This suggest an inconsistency in how backup targets are handled and that Time Machine manages sparsebundles explicitly.\n\nI realize this is not conclusive, so I tried it out:\n\n*\n\n*I mounted the host volume over USB, and proceeded to resize the sparsebundle with hdiutil to be as small as I could make it, so that it appeared to have ~20 GB free according to all system GUI tools. It shrank by over 100 GB in that regard, so plenty of space to spare on the host volume.\n\n*I mounted the bundle as a local volume, and proceeded to copy an 11 GB Xcode.xip file to it twice.\n\n*The first transfer succeeded.\n\n*The second transfer failed before even starting -- \"not enough free space\". 1.54 GB of additional space was required. This was expected.\n\n*Conclusion: the sparsebundle did not expand transparently, despite over 100 GB of free space on the host volume. There is no reason for me to believe that the figure that Time Machine reports is erroneous, nor that the volume will expand transparently during TM operation.\n\n\nA: Regarding your first question: It is the operating system that automatically resizes sparse bundles as necessary when you add data to them. This is done transparently underneath Time Machine, so it is not something that Time Machine explicitly handles.\nThe sparse bundle itself can have a maximum capacity that exceeds the available space on your drive, as it does not actually occupy any space before you write data to it. You can change resize this, but it doesn't actually change anything about how much space it takes up on the physical drive, but rather just imposes a limit on how much can eventually be written to it.\nEven though Disk Utility reports it as having no real free space, it will automatically expand to fill up the drive. When the physical drive is filled up, it is ofcourse not possible to add more to the sparse bundle until you clear up space or move the bundle to a larger drive.\nWhen you run hdiutil resize -limits my.sparsebundle you'll get a min, cur and max value. You can use the following calculations to get \"human-readable\" numbers for them:\n  min * 512 / 1024 / 1024 = MB data stored in the sparsebundle\n\n  cur * 512 / 1024 / 1024 = limit in MB of how much data can be added\n\n  max * 512 / 1024 / 1024 = the largest limit in MB you can set\n\nYou can change the limit at any time using:\nhdiutil resize -size 500MB my.sparsebundle\n\nThis would change the limit to 500 MB. Obviously it doesn't make sense to set the limit lower than the current amount of data stored. Perhaps a bit counter intuitive, the limit can be set higher than the amount of disk space you actually have available. The limit cannot however be set higher than the max value, which in your case is 16 TB. The reason for the 16 TB is that you have it setup with a block size of 4 kB. You can create sparse bundles with a larger block size to get a higher max value up to the theoretical maximum of just shy of 8 exabytes.\nNote that this limit does not have anything to do with how much disk space is actually taken up on your physical disk. You can find this number running for example:\ndu -sh my.sparsebundle\n\nIf for example use Disk Utility to create an empty sparsebundle with a size of 500 MB formatted with APFS, you'll see that the above command tells you that it takes up only approx. 13 MB on the physical disk.\nWhen you mount the sparsebundle and add files to it, the amount of space taken up on the physical disk increases. I.e. the operating system transparently expands the sparsebundle structure on the physical disk to accommodate the extra data you add to it. However, it won't add more than the arbitrary limit, you have set it.\nIf you select \"Info\" on the mounted sparsebundle in Finder, it will show you how much data has been added to the sparsebundle as well as the amount of \"Free\" space. This amount of \"Free\" space is not the amount of free space on your physical drive, but rather how much is left until you hit the (artificial) limit set on your sparsebundle, which you can change at any time later.\n\nA: I have possibly mixed up the concepts of min, cur and max.\nI had assumed that cur represented the space currently used on the host volume, and not the current total logical space of the image. In the latter case a resize would still be necessary in order to increase available logical size, which in hindsight turns out to have had the desired effect.\n\nTo clarify the problem for future readers (including myself):\nThe root cause of my problem was that I've gotten the impression that sparsebundles will \"expand\" automatically, without getting a clear picture of what exactly will expand.\nSince I was never particularly concerned with the fact that something that's sparse will potentially occupy less space than its advertised internal space — because that's only ever to my benefit — I had just assumed that mentions of how sparsebundles can expand automatically were referring to a separate concept, e.g. expanding its internal volume's space. That's something that would have been useful to know since it would have meant that I wouldn't have to worry about that the bundle's volume was filling up, as long as there's space left on the host volume.\nIn other words, while I could differentiate between the bundle's physical size on disk and its internal volume's size, I thought the latter had the capability to grow automatically. The hdiutil output did not help with that misconception.\nUnsurprisingly (in hindsight) this is not how it works. The volume size is fixed until manual intervention, and knowing that its physical size \"expands\" automatically is only marginally useful, at least for my use case.\n", "Q: When and how does FileVault decrypt a SSD on a T2 Machine Based on what the T2 chip, on user log in, decrypts a SSD with FileVault enabled? Bypassing the user password will result in a possible decryption of the SSD? As several years ago there where tools that bypassed the user password.\nAround the web I have found:\n\nTurn on FileVault, however, and a T2-equipped Mac engages in the same boot behavior as one that handles disk encryption in software. Instead of loading macOS directly, the Recovery partition boots in a special mode that requires entry of the password of any account allowed to use FileVault. Until that password is entered, the disk’s contents remain encrypted just as if it were at rest.\n\nFrom this we can understand that logging into your mac user - an user that is approved by the T2 to unlock the drive on which FileVault is enabled - is enough to decrypt the drive. From this the question, bypassing the user password using some sort of tool will decrypt the drive?\nI am curious because prior to the T2, depending on your configuration you could end with two password requests at log in:\n\n*\n\n*One for the user\n\n*One to decrypt the drive\n\nThat seemed a much stronger and secure approach.\n\nA: No, it is not enough to simply bypass the user password prompt. That's not how it works, and it is not a less secure or less strong approach than earlier - actually it is an improvement.\nThe way the T2 chip works is by always encrypting the contents of the SSD. This happens no matter if FileVault is enabled or not. If File Vault is not enabled, no password is necessary to decrypt the SSD, as you would expect.\nHowever when the user enables File Vault, the keys for decrypting the SSD are encrypted with a key based in part on the user's password. This means that the T2 can no longer decrypt the SSD on its own when booted. No matter how much \"trickery\" you use to bypass password prompts, it won't work, as it doesn't have the key necessary to decrypt.\nAs soon as the user enters his password (or a recovery key) - the T2 has the necessary information to derive the full decryption key and can thus decrypt the contents of the drive.\nNote: The above is grossly simplified explanation of how FileVault and the T2 works, but is representative of how it is perceived by users.\n", "Q: What is single user mode useful for? I don't quite understand on the Internet I couldn't really find anything useful. What is the individual user there for exactly? The terminal that is used in single user mode can also be used in the recovery partition?\n\nA: Single user mode is there in order to be able to diagnose and fix problems with the system. It is commonly used if there's an error with the system that prevents it from properly booting normally into multiuser mode (i.e. the default mode).\nThe single user mode allows advanced users to examine the file system, change settings, and otherwise work with the system and installed programs. In theory, you can run any command line program here - so if needed, you could for example copy all your data to an external drive in order to save files from a non-working system.\nThe command line interface when booted in Recovery mode is similar, but actually not the same. In single user mode you're booting your actual operating system that you would normally start up. In Recovery mode you're booting a separate \"known good\" system that might or might not be the same as your primary system (i.e. it could be an older or newer version for example). In Recovery mode you also wouldn't have immediate access to programs that you have installed yourself. You can mount the primary drive and access your programs that way, but it is not exactly the same.\nNote also that single user mode predates the Recovery partition by quite a lot as it has been there since the original OS X Cheetah release in 2001, whereas the Recovery partition was introduced with OS X Lion in 2011.\n", "Q: recover data from FFFFF partition inside an external drive A few weeks ago, I deleted my Linux partition of my Mac because I was running out of space.\nAfter that, I couldn't boot my OS anymore.

Apple's website says that \"third-party apps can request access to your health records\" but I can't find any apps in the app store that read them. Are there any apps that read health records (e.g., allergies, medications, or immunizations, lab results, etc.)?\n\nA: Here's an app that appears to match: ClinicQ by Health Here.\nThe fourth screenshot on the AppStore claims:\n\nCliniQ can import your allergies, medical conditions, procedures and medications from Apple Health\n\n\nIn the process, I found how to add an institution as a data source (Apple Health can pull records from a compatible portal) although this is not yet enabled in Australia, probably because currently only US, UK and Canada have participating sources.\nI also learned the difference between Health Records and the older Clinical Documents.\nFinding apps that DO NOT access Health Records was quite easy.  For Aussies, the Healthi app can connect to MyHealthRecord records, but doesn't integrate with Apple's Health app.\nAround launch time (2018), A tale of two hospitals mentions Johns Hopkins and Penn Medicine as early adopters.  The same article mentions 'EMR vendors such as EPIC, Cerner, Athenahealth, Meditech and AllScripts'... these are potential sources for more examples of apps that DO use the Health Records.\n\nA: As shown in Apple's official docs, it is completely possible for an app to request permission to read these. However, as Apple suggests, apps will only request this data if they need to, especially with Apple's new privacy labels.\nI don't see the purpose of searching for an app for the sole reason that it uses these, but you may want to check out the apps of health databases or of medical companies.\n", "Q: Parallels VM: Is there a way to run a script on the host when launching a VM? My Parallels VM is configured to use some network services on the host mac via the virtual network, but as the virtual network is not up when the mac host's services are started at boot they aren't listening on the virtual interface and the VM can't connect to them. After starting the VM I have to remember to manually restart those services on the mac host so that they are listening on the virtual network. It's annoying when I forget to do so...\nI'd like to automate this process if possible. Is there any way to configure Parallels to run a shell script on the host after a VM is started and the virtual network is up? (Suggestions for how to run a startup script on the guest VM are not germane.)\n\nA: Absent somebody pointing out a way to do this within Parallels itself, here's a solution using only native utilities - thanks @user3439894 for suggesting a Launch Agent!\n\n*\n\n*Create a /usr/local/bin/parallels_vm_starting shell script and chmod 755 it to make it executable:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n(\n    echo \"----------\"\n    date\n\n    if /usr/bin/tty -s\n    then\n        echo \"interactive\"\n    else\n        # sleep for a bit to give things a chance to settle\n        echo \"background - let things settle\"\n        sleep 15\n        date\n    fi\n\n    # Actions to perform when hosted VM starts up\n\n    /usr/local/Homebrew/bin/brew services restart redis\n\n    # etc. as needed\n\n    date\n\n) 2>&1 | tee -a /tmp/vm-startup.log\n\n\n\n*Create a Launch Agent file ~/Library/LaunchAgents/parallels_vm_startup.plist with this content:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n        <string>parallels_vm_startup</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>/usr/local/bin/parallels_vm_starting</string>\n        </array>\n    <key>WatchPaths</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>/Library/Preferences/Parallels/parallels_dhcp_leases</string>\n        </array>\n    <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n        <string>/dev/null</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThis will monitor the file /Library/Preferences/Parallels/parallels_dhcp_leases, which Parallels modifies when the VM starts (assuming the VM has networking enabled), and will execute the shell script when that happens.\nNote: the DHCP leases file is regularly updated while the VM is up.

My goal is to always have safe and complete versions of the files and no “dehydrated links / stub files for download on demand data on my computers.\n\n*\n\n*assume both Macs have more free storage than my iCloud storage quota\n\n*Assume both are online and internet is fast enough for syncs to happen regularly and efficiently\n\nIs there a way to force iCloud to keep all files at all times current in both my local machines?\n\nA: First and foremost: iCloud is not a backup service. In order to achieve what you want, you need backups!\nYou can use various forms of backups to realize your goal: For example you could use the built-in Time Machine software with external USB-drives in order to have a complete backup that you could store at a seperate location. You could also use a cloud service such as Backblaze, SpiderOak or similar.\nThat being said, you can avoid the Mac removing files from your local disk to free up space by opening up System Preferences, click Apple ID and then remove the check mark from Optimise Mac Storage.\n\nA: The answer posed by @jksoegaard is correct. I use iCloud to synch \"Documents and Desktop\" between my Macs, so I have (except as mentioned below) the same appearance and content on the two machines. \"Optimize Mac Storage\" must, as mentioned, be unchecked.\nThe exception is any local file marked with the file name suffix .tmp. Those files will not be uploaded to iCloud, and not therefore synched with your other Macs. Time Machine happily backs up .tmp files.\nThis is useful in my setup, as some (coincidentally, fairly large items) need to appear on my desktop iMac, but don't need to appear on the MacBook Air. Using .tmp reduces iCloud storage use. The storage hogs are synched separately: email by the IMAP server, photos and music using ChronoSync.\n\nA: As an alternative to iCloud, I use Resilio Sync to synchronise the Documents folder of my laptop (MacBook Pro) and desktop (Mac Mini). Any file created, deleted or updated on either computer gets that operation copied to the other.\nIt even works across different networks, so if I'm somewhere else with my laptop, it still syncs to my desktop.\nThis is in addition to Time Machine backups.\n", "Q: Can MBP 16\" ( Late 2019) retina screen can be replaced with non-retina non-Apple screen? I am getting some lines on one end of the screen I went to Aptronix (Apple retailer in India) customer care they are saying its pressure damage. I have never dropped the laptop nor hit the screen accidentally, but there some little scratches from normal usage. They mostly likely do not want to cover me under warranty so I am searching for alternate options. I wanted to replace my etina screen with a non-retina display like some UHD screen or any other screen.\n\nA: No, that is not practically possible.\nIt is of course theoretically possible, but the costs involved for a one-off would be so high that you could buy a Retina display instead at lower cost.\n", "Q: What does Converting (forward) mean in diskutil? I had an APFS (Encrypted) disk which I chose for Time Machine backups on macOS Catalina.\nI was asked if it was OK to erase the disk (Time Machine on macOS Catalina dosen't support APFS).\nI answered yes and disk was formatted as \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)\".\nInitial backup is done, but encryption is taking forever.\nRunning diskutil cs list reveals Converting (forward) and Conversion Progress: 2%.\nWhat does Converting (forward) mean and was my data backed up in clear (meaning it was encrypted during initial backup)?\nWhy is it taking forever to encrypt data given disk was formatted as \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)\" before data was backed up?\nThanks!\n\nA: Converting \"forward\" means that direction is from not encrypted -> encrypted. I.e. you started with a blank disk and enabled encryption.\nIt is possible to do a conversion in the opposite direction if you later decide you do no want your disk to be encrypted.\nYour backup was encrypted - it is not stored in the clear when encryption is enabled.\nEncryption does take a long time, yes. It is intentionally throttled to not consume system resources, but takes place in the background. You can keep using the computer and the disk while it is working.\nIt can be a pain if you're encrypting an external disk and need to keep it connected for a long period of time, but unfortunately that is normal.\n", "Q: Macbook external display rearranges homescreen I've just set my PC moniter as primary screen when I plug in my MacBook (Air 2020) but it keeps rearranging my Homescreen.\nWhen I rearrange it so it fits my external display and unplug my laptop it will place the apps on top of each other so I that doesn't work.\nCan I prevent this from happening?\n\nA: Because it's a laptop with its own screen, as soon as you unplug your Primary screen, the internal once again becomes Primary & all windows will migrate to it.\nRe-connecting the other display it will then once again reassign it as Primary - but the 'damage' has already been done & it will not be able to correctly place the windows back where they were.\nYou may benefit from using a third party window manager.

The macbook itself is out of warranty, and even though the public Apple site lists an option to get it serviced out of warranty anyway, that option disappears when logging in with the associated Apple ID.\nThere is a Premium Reseller nearby that can replace the battery, but they require, aside from the laptop itself (obviously) full root access in the form of the password of an active administrator account.\nAre there any tips for protecting the data on the laptop? Just erasing all data isn't quite enough on an SSD as all data can easily be retrieved if I'm not mistaken. The laptop doesn't have a T2 chip, if that makes any difference (2014 model). Are there any tips on this matter?\n\nA: To my knowledge, it is not easy to retrieve data deleted from an SSD. If TRIM is turned on (and it will be on a MacBook in most situations), there is no way for the operating system to retrieve the contents of a block that has been erased. Specialized forensic analysis software can read deleted blocks that have not yet been overwritten, but this is only possible with certain SSDs.\nIf you wanted to be very careful, I would suggest the following:\n\n*\n\n*Turn on FileVault and wait for the volume to be fully encrypted.\n\n*Boot into recovery mode and erase the disk.\n\nAn article about recovering data from SSDs: Afonin, Oleg.

It retains a full copy of your photos in iCloud (accessible on iCloud.com as well).\niCloud Backup is a one-way backup of your current photo library on your device. It can only be restored by restoring your entire iCloud Backup.\nYou can safely turn off Photos from your backup - unless you prefer to manually manage your photos, I'd recommend doing this instead of turning off iCloud Photos.\nIf iCloud Photo Library is on, there will be a note saying \"Photo Library is backed up separately as part of iCloud Photos\" - if you don't see this message, double check that your device is actually syncing with iCloud Photos. You can do this in the Photos Setting or in iCloud Settings > Photos.\n", "Q: Where does Google Drive File Stream store offline files and folders on a Mac? I use Google Drive File Stream for work, and there are certain mission-critical files that I need available for offline access.  File Stream makes this easy: control-click on the file, and choose \"Available Offline\".  Great!\nBut where are these files stored?  With the \"old\" Google Drive (now \"Backup & Sync\") there was a Google Drive folder at the top of my user directory; this folder was always available, whether Backup & Sync was running or not, and Time Machine would back it up for me (if I wanted it to).  With File Stream, I have no idea where those files are -- when the program is not running the \"Google Drive\" volume unmounts from my system, and the files appear to be completely inaccessible; moreover I don't think Time Machine backs them up.\nWhere is File Stream storing these offline files?  Is there a way to back them up, or to access them when the program is not running?\nJust for clarity’s sake: I am interested in the answers to these questions on MacOS, specifically in Catalina, if that makes a difference.\n\nA: By default, Google Drive for desktop (formerly known as Google Drive File Stream) stores cached files in ~/Library/Application Support/Google/DriveFS/$account_id/content_cache, where $account_id is the numeric ID of your google account. The files aren't encrypted or anything, but they don't have any metadata (or even their original filenames) so I don't think you'll find them terribly useful. The metadata seems to be stored in various SQLite databases in in the $account_id folder. In an emergency an expert might be able to reconstruct the original file names and folder structure.\nIf you want a full backup of your Google Drive, you can try backing up the Google Drive volume itself (/Volumes/GoogleDrive), while Google Drive for desktop is running.\n", "Q: How to copy link in Google Docs app?

When I run git --version in the Terminal, I get prompted to install the \"command line developer tools\":\n\nWhat exactly do I get from these \"command line developer tools\", and how much disk space will the installation use up? I don't want to drag along a whole bunch of useless programs just because I want to use a single command.\n(Assume that I do not want to use Homebrew, for whatever reason. The question is asking about the disk space used up by an installation of Apple's \"command line developer tools\").\n\nA: The installer says it requires 2.72 Gb of space. It installs a variety of Unix tools for compiling software, and other advanced usage (such as git) on the command line, including 'many other useful commands that are usually found in default linux installations' (osxdaily.com). It also includes the SDK frameworks and header files for macOS APIs. And python3.\nSeparating out what it is exactly that you need and what you don't is not really feasible, and may cause errors. Presumably, you're doing some kind of scripting/programming, for which other tools in the CLDT might be useful.\n\nA: As @benwiggy says you cannot split up the command line tools.\nHowever if the issue is just that you want git then there are other ways\n\n*\n\n*Install command line git binary and associated tools from the Git downloads web page\n\n\n*Install a git GUI tool that includes its own copy of git efor example SourceTree. Other Git GUI clients are listed on the  Git website\n\nA: I recently got a Mac, my motivation--coming from Linux--was to find out why Linux projects from developers working on Macs I came across ended up being the maintenance burden for me and my team that they were. Surprising insights.\nI have a Unify Dream Machine Pro, so I at least have some insight how much traffic it generated even if an installer for some reason does not want to tell you. I acknowledge that it may be sufficient for Mac users at home to just tell them how long it will take, while game launchers show all kinds of statistics about downloads, but for developers... oh come on Apple!\nYou won't trust me if I'm not going to post a screenshot, so here it is:\n\nThe SSL/TLS connection which downloaded 189 MB was the Visual Studio Code download which instructed me to install the developer tools. So for version 2395 we have 2.84 GB of data.\nWhen I log into the developer portal I can see downloads which are not more than 700 MB in size like Command Line Tools for Xcode 13.4. The numbers don't add up here.\nbt@Benjamins-MacBook-Pro ~ % git --version\nxcode-select: note: no developer tools were found at '/Applications/Xcode.app', requesting install.

Each around 590 to 740 MB. So you download old software to then download newer software and 3 different releases. This will make sense at some point in my Mac journey, but for the start I only wanted git-cli which should be no more than 50 MB, at least that would be close to what Ubuntu does including direct dependencies.\nWhen I have time I will try to set up a proxy to identify what it downloads, but that has to wait. Trying to use my sonatype nexus repository from the command line as a raw proxy did not work, I guess because it starts a GUI and ignores http_proxy, https_proxy, HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY variables.\n", "Q: Unable to include external media drive in time machine backup I have recently moved my apple photo library to an external hard drive to save space on my internal SSD, however i would obviously still like this external drive to backup with the rest of my computer. However it appears i am unable to take this drive off the excluded list (as shown below), does anyone know how i can remedy this?\nCheers.\n\n\nA: Best guess is the drive is the wrong format.\nTime Machine won't back up NTFS, FAT or ExFAT.\nAPFS should work, but 'safest' is HFS+ [MacOS Extended, Journaled] using GUID, not MBR. These options are available in Disk Utility.\nYou will not be able to change the format \"live,\" you will need to copy this data elsewhere, then erase the drive & then copy back to it afterwards.\n", "Q: Is there any difference installing command line tools with xcode-select --install or through developer.apple.com Is there any difference installing command line tools with xcode-select --install in the terminal and installing it through the graphical program from developer.apple.com ?\n\nA: There shouldn't be any difference, no.\n", "Q: MacOS terminal switches computer name from “macbook-pro” to “huawei_p_smart”: should I worry?

Why did this change happen, and should I worry about this? I do not own a Huawei, nor did I change any of my laptop's settings myself. I'm running iTerm on MacOS Catalina v10.15.7.\nScreenshot:\n\n\nA: No. Your router tells your mac how to name itself and the Mac will take the name assigned to the router. Then you might decide to process those names or change terminal or decide to change your router setup.\n\n*\n\n*OS X computer name not matching what shows on terminal\nThis is common that many DHCP servers don’t ask Mac what their name is or don’t record it uniformly. Apple OS provides many “names” for your Mac which complicates things as well. What happened is your Mac asked the router for an address and name and it assigned the old name from an old device that previously used the address your router assigned.\nYou would need to patch the router or log in to the router and follow the vendor guide to assign a Mac name to your MAC address for the name to be one that makes sense, I believe.\n", "Q: Is there no \"expose\" feature (show all tabs) in iterm2 on Big Sur?

In my case I had to plug in the main monitor (in terms of the one which holds the menu bar) first.\n", "Q: If i run terminal on rossetta2 then will all the processes run on rossetta 2 itself? Reason i am asking is i want to build some docker images which are not suitable on arm right now .. so i am just wondering If i run terminal on rossetta2 and build docker images. Those images will be built on rossetta2 ?\n\nA: No, code execution doesn’t work that way on macOS Big Sur.\nRosetta2 automatically translates the app when you install it from an Apple install package or translates on the fly if you otherwise side-load the executable and library code.\nIt doesn’t virtualize a system - it translates code.\nThings like kernel extensions or scripts can not be translated and will fail outright. App developers must make new versions of those extensions and scripts in that case.\nThe only thing running terminal in Rosetta2 will accomplish is you use the translated M1 instructions and not the optimized ones for the terminal app itself.

I am running into walls trying to make the stick from my own computer, which is an M1 MacBook Air running Big Sur.\nAn El Capitan .DMG is downloadable directly from the Apple Support page, which provides instructions on how to make a bootable volume, with a major caveat On a Mac that is compatible with El Capitan, open the disk image and run the installer within, named InstallMacOSX.pkg\nI used a utility to extract the Install OS X El Capitan.app file from the .dmg and then ran the terminal command from that support page:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyUSBVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app \nBut this yields /Applications/Install OS X El Capitan.app does not appear to be a valid OS installer application.\nWhen I google this error some results indicate it is due to an expired file, but changing my system date to 2016 does not fix it.

Things you can use to have a similar effect:\n\n*\n\n*Fullscreen zoom in Accessibility settings you can modify zoom and for example - make it fullscreen or control with keyboard, but there is only one thing you need to remember to double-tap screen with 3 fingers and move zoom with also 3 fingers (because \"normal\" scroll acts normally as without zoom ). I won’t share the screenshot here because zoom resizes that to size the same as without it.\n\n*Resize font (only in Accessibility settings and in shortcuts) to make font size up to about 1000 times bigger than normal and it resizes also icons, (I just saw that when moving this font-slider in setting and watching icons of setting’s tabs).  It’s named \"enable bigger fonts\" and should be over this place where you choose font size - [Settings ▶ Accessibility▶ Display and Text Size \"Bold Text\", \"Larger Text\"] here is the maximum size of text (and even other things) by enabling that:\n\nYou can also bold text if you want in the category above text size.\nBTW, you can force that but then it’d really be hard and then you’ll need to modify iOS.\n\nA: On your iPad go to settings. From settings go to Display and Brightness. Go to the page on the right and move to bottom of page. There you will see View. Tap on that header and you'll get a page called Display Zoom.

It is entirely hosted on icloud - I am using the 'optimise iphone storage' setting and have no high res images stored locally on my laptop as the library is too large. I'm getting concerned that iCloud is the only place I have the full resolution images stored and I want to download a backup of the entire library to an external HDD (preferred), or a second cloud service (less preferable) to ensure I have a second copy. I am happy keeping my main library on icloud as it works well for me and allows me to sync all my different devices (iphone, macbook, 2x ipads), I'm just looking to make a second backup copy in case something goes wrong. I don't need to use or access these photos under normal circumstance.\nI can't work out how to do this. The only options I seem to be able to find is to either download 1000 images at a time from iCloud to my external HDD (which is near impossible as I can't work out how to select 1000 at once), or download the entire library to my laptop, then backup from there - which I don't have space for on my laptop (photos library is 250GB, laptop entire SSD is 250GB).\nI'm not especially concerned about preserving file structure or anything like that, I just want to make sure I have all the images in case anything ever goes wrong with iCloud. What is the most sensible option? I'll pay for 3rd party software if that's the only option, though happy to put in some legwork to do it manually if there is a sensible way to do it. I don't mind manually adding future pics to the backup.\n\nA: I think you have two options here:\n\n*\n\n*Download the images and save them to your external hard drive\n\n*Create a photo library on the external drive and use that one with iCloud enabled (however iCloud is not a backup service, only a syncing service, so you'd then also want to backup that drive)\n\n\nFor the first option there are multiple online guides:\n\n*\n\n*iCloud to Mac\n\n*iCloud to PC\n\n*iCloud to iPhone\nI assume you are one a Mac. You should be able to simply hit cmd + a and be able to download all of the images. If not select an image, then scroll down as far as you want, hit shift and select the last image.\nThere is a download limit of 999 images in iCloud.com, so you'd need to select a certain range of images with shift. This will - for 30000 images - take quite some time but is technically possible.\n\nI would however encourage you to pursue option two for multiple reasons. What you'd want to do:\n\n*\n\n*get another external hard drive with at least the size of both your current external drive and the MacBooks internal drive combined\n\n*Create a new photos library on your MacBook, store it on the current external drive\n\n*Enable iCloud on that photos library (go into the photos app settings with this library opened and open the iCloud preference pane). After some wait time, you should have all the images synced across your iCloud devices, including the photos library stored on your external drive\n\n*Connect your newer and bigger hard drive as well and enable Time Machine in your mac settings including a backup of your external drive. That way you ensure you have both your Mac and your photos on the external drive backed up with history.\n\n*If you don't want a TM backup you could also open the library package (right click on the .photoslibrary file and the show package contents) and copy the images to somewhere else. All images excluding deleted ones are in the Master and originals folder inside the library package.\n\nThis article may also help you: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204264\nSome advantages of option two:\n\n*\n\n*both your Mac and the external drive are backed up\n\n*You can work with the photos app offline and don't need to use the web interface on your Mac\n\n*You get a backup history of your photoslibrary and mac files\n\n*If iCloud at some point fails, you can get the actual library back (including albums, face recognition data,...) and not only the raw images\n\nI know that you would need to buy a second drive to achieve this, yet even multiple TBs of storage capacity these days often costs less than 100€. I just recently had to restore my photoslibrary due to some bug I suspect in macOS BigSur and - trust me - it is not worth it taking that risk.\n\nNote: For option two you could theoretically also partition the one disk you have and use the second partition as backup partition, yet a phyiscal failure of that drive will mean you lose the data on the external drive, but not the data in iCloud, which includes the photos.\n\nA: I would move your Photos.app Library to a large external volume. Follow the steps in this Apple Support document:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201517\n(Broadly, quit Photos.app, then move your library in the Finder, then launch Photos and in the preferences point it to your new location. Designate the library as the 'system library'.)\nOnce you've done this, then you can make sure that everything is stored on the external volume.\nYou'll also need at least one other external volume to maintain a backup copy, of course.\n\nA: The previous responses suggest fairly comprehensive solutions for you. I would vote for Time machine, because it backs up automatically and incrementally. See this for step-by-step guidance. It describes a setup similar to yours where downloading everything from the iCloud library to Mac isn't possible due to space limitations. Basically, you will need two EHDs - One on which you'll have your Photos Library, and another with Time Machine. Move your Photos Library to EHD1, turn off Optimize Mac storage, and make it the system library. Once it has fully downloaded from iCloud (Will take time), set up Time Machine on EHD2, and override the default setting to ignore external drives by going to the System Preferences, and for Time Machine > Options > Select drive > click – (minus) > Save.

But I'm scared that I might download some trashy software because all the stuff I find on google just turn out to be ads.\nDo you have any recommendations?\n\nA: I would recommend MalwareBytes. However, macOS already includes XProtect, which is a regularly updated blacklist of malware. On top of that, there are lots of built-in security features that make it very difficult for malware to do damage: processes are limited in what they can read or write.\nOf course, I'm not suggesting that 'Macs don't get malware'. But if you're already cautious about downloading 'trashy software', then that's as effective as anything.\nWhat you didn’t ask is are there products more effective than one that just tries to catch up with known malware. There’s a class of products that scan for suspicious behavior so you can decide if a program is worth the risk or be alerted to an uncatalogued risk. Start with Objective See products in that case.\n\n*\n\n*https://objective-see.com/products/blockblock.html\nLuLu and KnockKnock are worth looking at as well as the linked BlockBlock app from above.\n\nA: Many security researchers recommend this malware scanner. Myself even if I don't think much of 3rd AV software https://de.malwarebytes.com\n\nA: Everyone always recommends Malwarebytes… however the free version will not actively scan, so you're left with remembering to run a scan.\nThere's nothing wrong with it, but if you look at AV-TEST (which is about the closest thing to an actual official authority on which antivirus is 'best') you'll see it's not even listed.\nNow, that is for two reasons - 1. Companies have to pay to be listed & 2. When Malwarebytes was listed on there a few years ago it scored so badly that one can only imagine they didn't want to keep paying for such damning evidence. [Opinion mine.]\nSo, based on that, I'd look at what is listed on AV-TEST & pick something that does well, not only on the latest report, but also going back in history. They all have a tendency to rise & fall over time, so you really want one that tends to always stay near the top.\nPersonally, I recently settled on Avira & it hasn't yet irritated me sufficiently to remove it again. That's usually my tipping point - when ads to buy a freeware version get in the way or even a paid antivirus starts to feel like it's weighing the machine down.\nI still do have Malwarebytes on here & do occasionally run it. The free, non-interactive version doesn't clash with any other installed anti-virus.\nNever have two active scan/live antivirus solutions on one machine - they can fight.\nThe trouble with Googling for \"best mac antivirus\" is that due to some rather dodgy SEO techniques, many of the top results, if you look closely enough, are recommending their own antivirus, & the only other places that particular one is ever mentioned is on other sites using the same SEO techniques… so it all gets a bit cyclical.\nI wouldn't trust one of these as far as I could spit it.\n", "Q: What i need to do to backup and secure my mobile data before sending it to repair I have iPhone 11 and its screen was broken, so I will send it to an authorized reseller for Apple. but before doing so I will remove all the data I have these data include; photos, videos, apps (mail app, WhatsApp, and other apps).\nHow I can securely remove the data inside my phone, so it can not be recovered when I send it to the technician?\n\nA: Apple gives instructions on what to do before a repair, bit it should really just be this article.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201351\nI prefer that checklist since it talks about Apple Watch and health data backup.

I would start up back to macOS and be sure you have internet, wired Ethernet preferably, and try to validate your user is set up properly or make a new admin account.

But then cmd+C won't work as the Copy shortcut anymore.\nIs there a way to have both?\n\nA: The Shortcuts Prefs won't allow you to add the same Menu item twice, so no, this cannot be done.\nAdditionally, in Finder, the Copy menu item is a 'smart' structure, meaning it always contains the name or count of what would be copied by the key command. You cannot use the shortcut replacer at all on a smart menu.\nExamples…\n\nFurthermore, attempting to override a system-wide command like Copy is bound to fail somewhere.

And well, it entered into a reboot loop.\nI tried to activate the recovery mode, with no success — is simply continues to reboot by itself and the MacBook does not detect it at all.\nIs there any hope to recover the data I have?\n\nA: First problem was that the battery was not charged completely and my MacBook Pro wasn't able to charge the phone's battery, hence the reboot loop.\nI searched an original charger, connected the iPhone and let it charge. Once the battery was charged, the reboot loop stopped, but the Apple logo was still stuck on the screen.\nTried to force restart a couple of times, and enter in the DFU mode and eventually managed to activate the DFU mode.\nConnected the iPhone to the MacBook.

I repeated the steps, it completed almost successfully, giving the same unknown error at 100%...\nTried again and got the same result.\nFinally, I reset my iPhone and restored a recent backup.\n\nMoral of the story: if the storage is full, you may want to delete applications and data you can get later anyways, rather than rebooting the device.\n", "Q: How to enter @ and € on a German MacOS installation?

It is not available on macOS.\nThe POSIX standard prescribes a getrlimit() system call for retrieving these limits for the current process. It is available on macOS as it is POSIX-compliant.\nLinux on the other hand has implemented a system call known as prlimit(), which allows getting these limits for other processes than the current process. The system call is specific to Linux and not available on other Unix-like operating systems.\nAll in all this means that there's no direct API for retrieving that information on macOS.\nHowever, you can retrieve the information by the way of inspection inside the other process. For example by attaching similar to how a debugger would attach (ptrace()), or by the use of dtrace. It is though possible for the other process to actively resist this measure.\nDepending on your specific use case, which you have not revealed, YMMV.\n", "Q: Get notes text with shortcuts app I need to create a \"Choose from\" script on my shortcut project.

What is it and where is it? It sounds like it has something to do with iOS. Thank you!\n\nA: If the Photos app is open on your Mac it opens photos.sqlite-shm. You can see what files Photos has open using Activity monitor. For me it is ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/database/Photos.sqlite-shm\nThus your sync process is correctly saying that  the file is in use\nYour process thus has to make sure that Photos.app is not running.\n\nA: This is a legitimate database that backs Photos content on macOS (and probably tvOS, iOS, iPadOS).\nIt's inside the \"Package\" that is your Photos Library and you can have more than one Library with Photos, so the name can vary.\nIf you look inside your Pictures folder (~/Pictures) you can use the Finder Go menu to go to this location once you know what your library is named. For me it's \"Photos Library.photoslibrary\"\n\nThe real question comes next. Why does this sync process not work and why would it not tell you to quit the Photos app or grant permissions. By default, macOS will not let any program access photos, contacts and more and the program has to \"ask\" to get permission.\n\nAbove you can see the \"unix\" permissions for the files in question.\nThe where is this is easy - the what's really broken? is harder to guess. Also - we might need you to ask a follow on question that explains where your research led if the idea of a home folder / permissions granted or unix permissions isn't relevant or helpful - I would rather not assume you're an expert or a beginner without a little more context.\nIn summary - you may not even want to sync the Photos library since not all the photos in there might be stored in a way the sync tool expects. Can you just store your photos in a folder / export them or do you intend this to be a two way process that makes both databases stay in sync no matter how a photo arrives in the Photos app?\n", "Q: Sudden greyscale shift on Macbook Air I think this is a duplicate of an old question without a good answer: Display appears different on two accounts using same color profile\nMy child was doing schoolwork on her school-issued Macbook Air.

I already have Paragon NTFS installed, which allows me to write to NTFS drives. What should my next step be?\n\n*\n\n*I could drag and drop everything from the Finder into the new SSD. However, this might not copy over some hidden files and might not be a good option.\n\n\n*I could drag and drop after revealing hidden files, but that might also cause issues (?)\n\n\n*I could use rcopy to make sure everything gets copied over (including hidden files), although I don't see any difference between this and option 2.\nNote: This question is not necessarily related to BootCamp—I would like to know the same for M1 Macs as well, which do not have BootCamp.\n\nA: You can use the dd command to clone the disk as follows:\n\n*\n\n*If the source SDD is larger than the destination SSD, start up your Mac in Windows 10 and shrink the partition on the source disk, as explained in this Microsoft document: Shrink a basic volume, so that its size is smaller than the destination SSD. Then restart your Mac in macOS.\n\n\n*Connect both SSD disks to your Mac\nIf you get a message similar to this when connecting the destination disk:\n\nselect \"Ignore\".\n\n\n*Launch Disk Utility (located in the Applications > Utilities folder).\n\n\n*Select the source disk and write down the device name.\nIn the screenshot below, the device name is disk2:\n\n\n\n*Select the destination disk and write down the device name:\nIn the screenshot below, the device name is disk3:\n\n\n\n*Select the source volume and unmount it.\n\n\n\n*Select the destination volume and unmount it. (This step will not be necessary if were prompted to select \"Ignore\" in step 1.)\n\n\n\n*Launch Terminal (located in the Applications > Utilities folder).\n\n\n*Run:\nsudo dd if=/dev/rdiskX of=/dev/rdiskY bs=1m\nwhere:\ndiskX is the device name of the source disk (in the example above, disk2). Note the r in /dev/rdiskX: we use the raw device file for a faster copy.\ndiskY is the device name of the destination disk (in the example above, disk3). Note the r in /dev/rdiskY: we use the raw device file for a faster copy.\nsudo is a command that lets you run the dd with administrative privileges.\nType your password if requested.\nIt is extremely important that you don't mix up the device names of the disks! Otherwise you will overwrite your Windows 10 disk.\nThis may take a while, so be patient. You can check the progress of dd as explained in this answer: How can I track progress of dd\n\n\n*Test the destination SSD. You may want to extend the volume as explained in this Microsoft document: Extend a basic volume\nMore information\nFor more information on dd, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_(Unix)\nFor more information on sudo, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo\nFor a very similar but command line-only method to clone disks in macOS using dd, see: https://pbxbook.com/other/dd_clone.html\n", "Q: Macports and Xcode help I have no idea what I'm doing.

I know this is possible because I keep accidentally bringing up Spotlight Search randomly when I’m using apps.

If it does, how can I view it? And can I delete that record if I want to?\n\nA: Yes, macOS does keep a history of everything users download, although users can prevent items from being recorded in that history if they're using their browser's private browsing function or other software designed to ensure your privacy (e.g. the Tor browser, etc).\nSo, downloading anything in a typical browser (even right-clicking on an image and saving it) is recorded. However, if you're using a private (or incognito)  window (e.g. via shiftcommandN in Safari, Opera or Chrome, or shiftcommandP in Firefox) any items being downloaded will not be recorded in the history.\nYou can use a terminal command to view what is in your historical record. Note: it’s going to be one extremely long list and you’ll probably find viewing it isn’t very useful. Regardless, you can do this as follows:\n\n*\n\n*Launch Terminal app (usually found in your Utilities folder within the Applications folder)\n\n*Once it opens, copy and paste the following command:\n\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.QuarantineEventsV* 'select LSQuarantineDataURLString from LSQuarantineEvent'\n\n\n*Press return\nTerminal will now spit out a long list of addresses pertaining to your downloaded files.\nTo delete this history, you need to enter (or copy and paste) the following command in Terminal and press return:\nsqlite3 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.QuarantineEventsV* 'delete from LSQuarantineEvent'\nTo confirm that you've deleted your history, just run the first command again.\n", "Q: How would I limit per day usage for user with standard access rights to X minutes on macos 10.15?

I use screen capture utilities like Movavi and Snagit on my MacBook Pro 2019 (Big Sur) to record software demos. When using a headset or any other microphone connected to a USB port, the recorded audio is in stereo.\nWhen I use any external audio interface (PreSonus Studio 24C or Behringer U-Phoria UM2) as the captured audio source, I only get one side (the left side) of the audio. Using either interface with an application that doesn't capture the screen in any way works perfectly, clear audio from both sides.\nI'm certain that the audio interfaces are working properly. For instance, I can record my voice just fine using Vector 3 (or any other audio recorder) and the audio interface, and it's clear stereo.\nI need to use an audio interface because the mic I need to make a good recording needs an interface in order to work with my MacBook Pro. I haven't had a lot of luck troubleshooting this, even through contacting support from Movavi and Snagit. I'm trying my best to go through all possible system settings and configuration tweaks that I can - is this a common problem with screen capture scenarios? I was about to chalk it up to a third-party bug, but this seems to persist no matter what utility I use, yet the audio interfaces work perfectly fine with any other software that isn't doing a screen recording and I'm a little baffled as to why.\n\nA: The task as asked is in effect \"how to sum two inputs to one, stereo to dual mono?\" one side being the mic/line etc, the other side being just silence.\nIf you could persuade QuickTime, or any other recorder to record only mono audio this would be one way. If you need additional music etc that must be in stereo, then somehow you need to persuade the Mac itself to sum both yout input channels to mono.\nI cannot seem to find any way to achieve that with the Mac itself, nor much of the commonly-available audio routing tools - Audio Hijack, Loopback, Audio-Midi setup etc, testing with Aggregate inputs & everything I could think of.\nAll I did manage to achieve was to sum before sending to the Mac. In my case, it needed the input software of my Line 6 interface. Setting the input to only one of the 2 potential channels Line 1, Mic 1 etc, then the software itself was doing the sum to mono for me & the Mac would then be happy to place it in the centre of the stereo image.\nSetting the input to Stereo Line/Mic etc would send to just one side or the other.\nPresumably, this would be considered 'expected behaviour' for a stereo source, though it does look like if you use the Mac's headphone input or a webcam etc, then it already 'knows' there is a single mic, not stereo.\nInterface image, just as an example -\n\n I didn't take the time to clean the 'amplifier' setup to be straight clean, so it still looks more like a guitar amp & pedals. That doesn't affect the routing, only the audio quality]\n", "Q: System time growing an accumulating latency High Sierra 10.13.6.

How can I do this?\n\nA: So, the answer is likely neither. Apple prefers to deliver a message securely and end to end encrypted and not deliver to any phone number for security and privacy reasons. The APNS system uses your contact information that is registered to make a device unique address. The same “message” sent to two of your devices is encrypted differently. When decrypted, they are the “same message” but over the air, the messages are unique and distinct.\n\nSMS messages can be forwarded to devices that have none (iPhone sets up forwarding of the message content to an iPad or Mac using Text Message Forwarding opt-in settings)\nThe AppleID you use for Messages can have SMS and email as addressees. You can sometimes tap the message and see which if your contact items a message was addressed, but it’s hit or miss for me since it matters if you are reading these on iOS or iPadOS or macOS how it looks. Select yourself at the top of the chat window and see if one of your “addresses” is a different color is my best advice. The software tries hard to just show you who it was addressed to, not which of your data points was the recipient.\n", "Q: Homebrew says I got the latest version of Emacs installed, but the emacs command indicates it's still the old version I updated my emacs version using Homebrew.

Since I installed it, I cannot make calls using my iPhone xs with either of my Mac computers. The window comes up telling me I’m using Facetime audio with my iPhone, but I immediately get a message in the window saying that the phone and the computer must be connected to the same WiFi network in order to complete the call. Repeated attempts at this have failed.\nIt looks like everything is set up on all Apple devices for this to work.\nOn my Nighthawk app, all 3 devices show up on my 5 GHz network.\nThis worked with the former WiFi router I had and replaced. It was not a mesh system. That router had the ability to connect to either the 2.5 GHz or the 5 GHz network manually. Apparently, the Nighthawk does not have the manual connection option.\nI’ve tried logging out of and back into Facetime to no avail.\nMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) running macOS Catalina 10.15.7;\niMac (Retina 4K, 21.5 inch, Late 2015) running macOS Cataline 10.15.7;\niPhone XS Max IOS 14.4.2\nOn the Apple sight I can only find older similar questions - nothing recent except what I posted there.\nAny help is welcome and appreciated.\n\nA: Update\nThis is working for me now for the last 2 days.\nWhen the new WiFi router was set up, I took advantage of the option to use the exact same network name and password for my network that was used with the previous router (different manufacturer and network type). Basically, I’m lazy and didn’t want to relog into 20+ devices on the existing network. That may have contributed to the problem.\nAs I said previously, I logged out of Facetime on my Macbook Pro {MBP) and logged right back in again. There was no difference in operation. However, I shut the Macs down at the end of every day and restart them the following morning. The day after I did the Facetime logout/login, tried it again and it worked. Also got a notification on my other Apple devices about the log in on the MBP after using phone with facetime.\nSo I’m keeping my fingers crossed that it’s fixed.\n", "Q: Restore Time Machine backup from Mac Mini to Mac Pro?

There's no need to create a Time Machine backup first in order to migrate data and settings.\nIt does not matter that one is a Mac Mini and the other is a Mac Pro.\nMigration Assistant will be default allow you to transfer the data over the network.

From man networksetup .. NOTE must be an admin to run it.\n\nDESCRIPTION\nThe networksetup command is used to configure network settings typically configured in\nthe System Preferences application. The networksetup command requires at least admin\nprivileges to change network settings. If the \"Require an administrator password to\naccess system-wide preferences\" option is selected in System Preferences > Security &\nPrivacy, then root privileges are required to change network settings.\n\nYou can make changes to many OSX network settings using similar tools to linux platforms, using networksetup ensures everything running is properly informed, settings are saved, and upon reboot those saved values are still usable (exactly as if you had used System Preferences) - see this answer to another networking questions that talks about how that works.\n\nThe basic reason is that macOS has two different levels of network configuration: the live state (which ifconfig en0 down changes) and the \"configuration database\" which corresponds to the settings created in the Network pane of System Preferences and/or the networksetup command.\n\nIn this particular case the -setwebproxy and -setsecurewebproxy options change the proxy settings for a particular network service - e.g. HT user3439894 - these set the proxy on the Wi-Fi network service.\nnetworksetup -setwebproxy \"Wi-Fi\" localhost 8080\nnetworksetup -setsecurewebproxy \"Wi-Fi\" localhost 8080\n\nDepending on the actual network configuration will need to choose the appropriate service..\n\n-setwebproxy networkservice domain portnumber authenticated username\npassword\n\n\nSet Web proxy for networkservice with domain and port number.

(i don't remember the others).\n\nAll the above approaches doesn't work at all.\n\nI plugged in my cable on Windows PC and it worked beautifully! But unfortunately doesn't works in this iMac.\nHow to solve this ?\n\nA: The Ethernet service is shown as Connected, so the physical ethernet link was successfully established.\nAn IP address was received by the DHCP server, as well as a valid configuration for subnet, gateway and DNS servers, so communication from your Mac to the DHCP server (in this case your router) was successful. This rules out any problem with the ethernet connection itself.\nYou have already verified that changing the IP address does not have any effect, so we can also rule out firewall rules that block on that basis.\nYou have also disabled any proxy settings in the service's \"Advanced\" settings.\nTherefore either\nA) it's a configuration issue on your Mac or\nB) your router blocks connections from/to the MAC address of your Mac's ethernet adapter.\n\n*\n\n*To rule out any possible service misconfiguration, remove the Ethernet service (with the button - below the list of services) and add it again. Don't forget to click Apply when done.\n\n\n*Make sure you have disabled all apps that reconfigure your routing (e.g. VPN) or filter your traffic (e.g. firewalls).\n\n\n*Try doing a traceroute. This helps determine where packets stop. Open Terminal.app and run the following command to trace a route to your ISP's DNS server (which I've taken from the screenshot):\ntraceroute 103.109.124.52\n\nIf this doesn't provide answers, take a look at the router configuration and logs.\n", "Q: Can Apple TV be used as a thin client?

That can be done in a pinch, but not for ongoing software development work.\nNote that the \"Remote Desktop for TV\" app requires an RDP server, which you will typicak find on Windows. If you run macOS on your MacBook Pro, you'll typically want a VNC client instead.\n", "Q: GarageBand Plugins won't work because developer is not certified So I was downloading plugins for Garageband.

You know going to Macintosh HD> Library> Audio> Plug-Ins> Components. I've done this process lots of times. It works. But when I tried to use the new Plugins--Which I will say, do show up in Garageband--it says “Plugin Name.component” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.\".

I'm on a MacBook with a touchbar – that's how I control volume levels.\nIn practice, I only use two volume levels: \"silent\" (two bars) and \"loud\" (13 bars). It is a bit annoying to go through all the in-between levels when I want to go from one to the other.\nIs there a trick or a touchbar app to allow me to define \"silent\" and \"loud\" levels and then jump between them quickly?\n\nA: You can control the volume with AppleScript. For example:\nset volume output volume 100\nwill set the volume to 100%\nset volume output volume 5\nwill set it to 5%.\nVia shell script, the commands would look like this:\nosascript -e 'set volume output volume 100'\nSo that's part one: how to jump between 2 volume levels.\nPart two is \"How do I invoke those commands?\"\nI don't know any way to do it via the Touch Bar, but if I was committed to using that, I would look at BetterTouchTool.\nMy preferred solution would be a keyboard shortcut using Keyboard Maestro.\nYou could also use FastScripts.\n\nA: You could set it up as an Automator Quick Action (Service) containing a simple toggle-switch Applescript\nApplescript volume runs from 0 to 100 so doesn't precisely line up with a whole number of bars, so you may need to juggle the two values until they're comfortable.

I did a default delete of Safari data using CCleaner.

I noticed this yesterday when 22GB suddenly disappeared and I started to receive low disk space warnings. It seems to me this partition is for some update that possibly has gone wrong?\nI have upgraded Big Sur as soon as it was available so that is some time ago. This partition is more recent. A week ago I partiotioned some USB drives and this partition did not show up back then. Also I did reinstall XCode recently but it worked fine.\nI cant remove it from he minus sign. Should I boot from network and delete this or will deleting it create problems? Is there a \"correct way\" to fix this?\n\n\nA: This is quite normal under BigSur and it is not a partition, but a snapshot of your drive. E.g. mine looks quite similar:\n\nThere is nothing you need to worry about and you should not try to delete it. This exact layout has been also discussed in Apple Forums, on MacRumors and on reddit.\nTo quote from reddit (user \"Advanced_Path\"):\n\nBig Sur changes the way how updates are done. Now that the System volume is basically immutable, the way an update is done is with APFS snapshots. The system takes a snapshot of the base volume, updates the necessary file and from that moment forward, it boots from that snapshot.\n\nFurher, I can recommend this article.\n", "Q: AppleID syncing issue I deleted files from my Mac, but at the same time same files from another Mac with the same AppleID got deleted too.

How to do it?\nAlso if I change the AppleID of my Mac then will the files and all data get erased on the other Mac too (there the AppleID will remain as the old one) as a result?\n\nA: iCloud is a sync solution, not a backup solution. Deleting from one device deletes from all, by design.\nIf you used two separate IDs, they would not sync at all. Each would be completely independent.\nIf you don't want syncing, you'd be best to disable it rather than attempt to use two separate IDs.\nSystem Prefs > iCloud > iCloud Drive > Options…\nDisable everything except essentials like Contacts etc.\nAs it's a structure I've never used, precisely because I don't want the same data on all machines, I don't know what warnings you will get if you disable.

She must have accidentally activated it somehow today, but she is unaware of how it happened.\nAssistive touch is turned off (confirmed via screen share*). Nothing in control center is highlighted. I've tried searching for it on my phone to figure out what enables it, but I cannot figure it out. I have googled and all I find is suggestions to turn off assistive tough, but that is off. I don't even know how to google it. I've been trolling through assistive access, FaceTime, and phone settings and can find nothing related to that button.\nWhat is this button and how do you disable it?\n*UPDATE: I screen shared with my mom and had her go to settings > Accessibility > touch > assistive touch. It was off. I had her turn it on and a second floating button with a white circle appeared. I had her turn it back off and the circle button went away, but the arrow button remained.\n\nA: Just to add a little context; this isn't the Assistive Touch button — although it looks similar — it's the Speak Content button, and has no relation to FaceTime.\nWhen you swipe from the top with two fingers, that initiates Speak Content which uses text-to-speech to read whatever is on the screen, which is very useful. But you have to enable this option in Settings → Accessibility → Spoken Content, it's not on by default in iOS.\nMeanwhile assistive touch is the button with the circle in it, which then expands into a menu of programmable buttons you yourself would like to set of easy access (like Speak Screen!).\niOS is always in perpetual 'beta' mode, so there's always bugs with their accessibility options, especially the Speak Screen function can sometimes linger.\nJust in case, keep in mind there's also Back Tap, another accessibility feature, where tapping on the back of the screen two/three times can be set to initialize a command, such as Speak Screen. So make sure that is off, if you don't want it to be on.\n(I only know this as I myself use both Assistive Touch and Speak Content a lot.)\nGood luck! :)\n\nA: Apparently, the \">\" button did seem to have something to do with Assistive Touch, despite attempts to turn that setting on/off not affecting it. That was Apple Support's thought, but something was screwed up, causing that button to exist when it shouldn't, so they had me force-restart the phone and that made it go away. I.e. We held down the power and home button (iPhone 6s plus) until the apple logo appeared in the center of a black screen. Once it fully booted back up, the \">\" button was gone.\n\nA: My grandma had the same problem!! The way to make the arrow touch go away is going to Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content > Speak Screen and turning it OFF! It works!! I got it off.\n", "Q: Unlocking iPad Purchased from Government I have an iPad that was purchased from a previous employer (government local council). I have tried to factory reset it, but when setting up, I am told that this needs to be completed by the administrators for the council that I used to work for. Is there anyway of getting around this, without talking to the administrators from my previous employer?\n\nA: Governments tend to use MDMs, or Mobile Device Management systems. So the only way to deal with this is to get them to remove the device from their MDM. The only way to do that would be to talk to them.\nIf, of course, you purchased this iPad legitimately, there would be no issue in doing this.

However, I have no control over the text formatting.\nOn an Apple Watch, this is especially bad, as the font size is very small, even when the text is short.

This frustrated me and I decided to go off the rules a bit & installed macOS Big Sur (using patched Sur). This was all working fine, until a few days ago, I reseted the PRAM as I was having some issues with the CD-ROM.\nThe problem started here. After I reseted the PRAM, the MacBook started showing the prohibitory symbol. It scared me a lot since it had a lot of data (class notes, reference books for exams, etc.), and for the past 3 days, I've been searching the internet for its fix.\nSo, by now I've come to know that this sign comes when the Hard-Drive contains a macOS, but it's not supported on the Mac. Obviously, it contained Big Sur, which was not supported by this model.\nOn doing Internet recovery, it gave an option of reinstalling Mac OS X Lion, but when selecting a disk to reinstall the OS, it shows only the Boot Camp partition of the Hard Drive and shows the message that it's locked.\nSo, I wanted to ask if there is any method of reinstalling macOS (and obviously this time I'm not going back to Big Sur, only up to Catalina. This experience was enough) without losing any of my data, both from Boot Camp and macOS? If not, then is there a way I could back up files of macOS partition from Boot Camp partition?\nAlso, is there a simpler way to bypass this check, like the bypass created by Patched Sur, as that'll mean I'll not have to go back to Lion and reinstall OS updates to go back to Catalina?\nAlso, I wanted to know what exactly happened when I reseted the PRAM, that this bypass stopped working? This needn't include in the answers, but info on how this happened will help in expanding my knowledge.\n\nA: Firstly, you should always have a backup of your files, so there should be no question of losing anything. Files without a backup are waiting to be lost.\nIf the Recovery partition is indeed on Lion, then it won't read the new APFS formatted disk that Big Sur uses.\nYour first port of call should be to whoever wrote the patch, and ask them about whether it alters NVRAM in any way. It's possible that the reset is unrelated, and merely coincidental, of course.\nI'd suggest that your best course of action is to get an external drive that you can install some working OS to - even if it's Lion, and then upgrade that to Catalina, which at the least will be able to read the disk. Even a cheap 64GB 'thumb' drive may be sufficient in extremis, (though obviously, you'll be buying an external for backing up anyway...)\nYou should be able to install Catalina on the internal drive once you're running Catalina on the external.\nContrary to popular opinion, Apple don't cut off hardware from new OSes on a whim -- it's usually because the hardware lacks some specific requirement, or the 'experience' is brick slow.\nTBH, there's not much that you'll gain from Big Sur: Catalina will run perfectly well and should be compatible with new apps for a few years yet. But ultimately -- it's nearly a 10 year-old laptop. It may well keep running fine as it is for years, but it won't keep pace with the shiniest anymore.\n", "Q: Music app only shows an outdated music library after I've retrieved it from backup I made a clean reinstallation of my Mac a few days ago due to a problem that had been bugging me for a while now. And, among other things, I tried to retrieve my music library from my backup via Time Machine back to the music app. It was the folder „iTunes“.\nTo get all the settings back I’ve opened the file “iTunes Library.itl“.\nBut unfortunately, it seems to be completely outdated (it’s from late 2019!) which also shows in the music app. There are only songs and playlists listed up to that date, even though the songs in the iTunes Media folder (or to be more specific, in username/music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music) are all up to date. I suspect that this happened because of the outdated .itl-file.\nHow can I get back the settings I’ve had a few days back with all my playlists and songs?\n\nA: Thanks to Apple Support I was able to solve it. If you haven't saved your music library in iCloud, you need to retrieve the iTunes folder from your backup (or generally the one where all your songs are saved) and another folder in the same directory, Music, which should contain a single file, Music Library, that's up to date.\nClose the Music app (if it was open) and reopen it while pressing the option key (alt). Navigate to the above-mentioned file Music Library and you've got your latest library back.\n", "Q: \"Call/Cancel\" popup in Google App A few days ago I was using the Google iOS app (not Chrome, but the specific \"Google\" app that you can download in the App Store) to go to shady website in an attempt to stream a movie online. Stupid, I know. I didn't download anything, and I didn't think I clicked on anything, but I started getting a prompt to call a number.\nAs far as I could tell, it wasn't any of the obviously fake ones that tell you to call a number because your phone is compromised or anything. It looked like the legit prompt that pops up when you click on a number in iOS where it has \"Call 808-xxx-xxxx\" on the top row and \"Cancel\" on the bottom row at the bottom of your screen. This is the prompt that comes up if you click on a number in any app.\nAnyways, it popped up a thousand times and stopped when I killed the app. How does that exploit work? Did the webpage just trick my phone into thinking I clicked on a number a few dozen times? Is there any chance I got a virus from the website? Things have seemed fine since. Is there any way to tell if you have a virus aside from just the normal weird symptoms?\n\nA: It seems more likely that this call button was actually just a part of the website. If so the fake button probably was an off-white color rather than pure white.\nIf your phone isn't jailbroken I wouldn't worry about it. Clear your browser cookies to be on the safe side but it's probably fine.\nIf you see any suspicious ads on your home screen or profiles being asked for you to trust then you should worry. If so reset your phone to factory settings  or to an iCloud backup.\nI recommend using Safari for these activities and blocking popups. Make sure to use a VPN.\n", "Q: Create extra dock item that runs a bash script I currently have the Terminal in my dock. I'd like to have another Terminal shortcut in the dock but with this one it will run a bash script which will do some stuff specific to that shortcut.\nNo, I cannot use .bash_profile since the original Terminal short cut will source that too.\nThis is pretty trivial to do in Windows, is it trivial on a Mac also?\n\nA: You can have files in the Dock, but they have to be the other side of the 'dividing line' from apps.\nSo a shell script file, with suffix .command, or .tool, could be in the Dock and would launch on a click.\nThere are other places to have scripts readily accessible in the Mac workspace, of course, such as the Scripts menulet.\n", "Q: Can mac os support greater than 2x retina (for a small 4k screen)? I'm interested in a 4k portable monitor which is 14\" in size.\nI believe it is mainly intended for use with iOS/Android, however it does say supports mac/win.\nThe concern I have is that even at the familiar maximum 2x scaling, which we call retina resolution, 14\" at \"looks like\" 1920x1080 will result in very small ui.\nTo compound the problem in this case, this display is touch, too; which is likely to make finger accuracy an issue.\nDoes or can mac os support greater than 2x retina?\nHow are the supported resolutions for a display defined?\nIs this something apple does, or does the manufacturer do it; can a user adjust it without going too low level?\n\nA: While macOS currently does not support scaling to more than 2x, you can always run a display at less than native resolution. For example, run the display at 2560x1440 while using 2x, so the size of the UI would be equivalent to 1280x720. This should still look perfectly fine on a small screen with such high resolution.\nThe display tells the Mac which resolutions it supports. macOS may not show all of them in System Preferences, but the important ones are usually there.\n", "Q: My contacts in Messages are not syncing on my new Mac I just got a new Mac and my contacts are not syncing in messages.

See below.\n\nWhen you select the first icon - a circle with the letter i in it you get a new pop up as shown below.\n\nAs you can see at the bottom of this pop up is an area to assign a location.  While this may seem tedious, once you go thru it you'll see how simple it is.\n\nA: There is an open source item called exiftool which will let you add location data and a lot more to files.\nAnd while I can no longer remember names, there are tools that will compare timestamps in GPX files with those in images and estimate locations for the photos.  If you find one of those, make a back copy first.  The photos I tried one on were taken in Italy.  My iPad used local time, my sister's Windows tablet used US Colorado time, and the GPS device used UTC.

I've seen all the news around the M1 Mac writing the SSD excessively and I also have very high write counts on my SSD already.\nI do know SSDs do have a spare capacity they can assign to blocks once an original block is damaged. But this is only a few blocks as far as I know - is there any possibility to for example Mae the official capacity of the SSD smaller by 10GB and give those blocks as additional spares to the controller so it can prolong the live of the SSD a bit longer once blocks start dying?\nOr how would you go about securing the SSD Life? Is it a possibility to shrink the partition and zero out the rest of the drive so the controller can use these blocks? Would this include a firmware update of the ssd controller? I'm a bit lost about where to start with this.\n\nA: SSDs just don't work like that.\nFormatting & partitioning aren't placed in 'zones' like on an HD. The sectors/cells that the drive keeps as spares aren't even accessible to the OS, only to the drive's internal firmware. SSDs 'spray' data right across the usable sectors using complex algorithms really only known to the drive itself to prevent excessive wear.\nThe way to ensure an SSDs life is to keep a lot of free space on it. The smaller the drive, the larger the percentage. 10-15% minimum free on large drives; teeny ones, 128GB & 256GB, I'd keep a minimum of 25-35GB free.\n", "Q: Homebrew installed git not working I installed git with Homebrew and /usr/local/Cellar/git/2.31.1/bin is supposed to be the directory where the git executable is installed.

When I plug it into my Linux computer (USB-A on the computer, USB-C in the device), then Linux shows a new interface with an IP, and I can SSH into the device.\nOn a Macbook (where the Macbook also has USB-C connectors), it does not always work:\n\n*\n\n*If I take a usb-c to usb-c cable and use it to connect the Macbook to the device, it does not seem to get recognized (the network interface is not appearing in ifconfig).\n\n*If I connect a USB adapter to the Macbook (one of those USB hubs exposing 3 USB-A sockets), and then I connect a usb-a to usb-c cable between the hub and the device (so it's usb-c <--> usb-a <--> usb hub <--> usb-c), then it is recognized.\n\nMy first thought was that the hub was definitely a USB device/gadget, and maybe that helped because both the Macbook and the device were USB hosts. But I am pretty sure that the device is OTG, and the fact that the device can connect directly to the Linux shows that it can run as a gadget (and for sure the Macbook can run as a host).\nWhat could be the reason for that issue? And optionally: is it correct to think that the Macbook USB ports are not OTG but always host (I have never heard of an OTG port in a computer, not sure if that's a thing)?\nNote: it seems similiar to this old unanswered question.\nEDIT: as required, the System Report when it works. When it doesn't (i.e. with the usb-c-only cable), then the line just does not appear in \"USB 3.0 Bus\"...\n\n\nA: I think the problem is that your USB-C to USB-C cable is in fact power only.\nThe setup you have should work when you connect it directly, but you write the USB part of System Report gives no indication that anything at all is plugged in. If you have used a charger cable that has no data lines, this is what would happen.\nTry with a different USB-C to USB-C cable and it should hopefully work.\nUPDATE: Based on your comments, the problem seems to be that the device itself doesn't actually support USB-C fully. You'll need to configure the Linux kernel with the CONFIG_TYPEC option in make menuconfig in order to have support for USB-C build.\n", "Q: How do I make a mac have a faster boot time? I have a Mac desktop 2017 that has 8  Gigabytes of ram and a 1 TB HDD running Catalina. I was wondering how I can make the boot time faster because of work-related reasons. Thank you\n\nA: Here, I assume your iMac has a 21.5\" screen and was original configured with a internal 1 TB HDD. In this case, your model does not have the PCIe connector for an internal blade SSD. Therefore, you could only replace the internal SATA HDD with an internal SATA SSD. Note, this SATA connector operates at a maximum of 6 Gb/s. So, instead of replacing the internal drive, you would probably be better off with an external 10 Gb/s USB or 40 Gb/s Thunderbolt 3 drive. Also, an external drive would be easier to try and if purchased properly, the drive could be returned if the performance is not satisfactory.\nYour model Mac is not designed to be taken apart. Although, opening the Mac to replace the SATA HDD with SATA SSD would be possible. When I purchased my 2013 iMac, I had Micro Center open the tapped edge Mac and upgrade to 16 GB of RAM. Like your Mac, the internal drive is a 1 TB HDD. Upgrading to Catalina made this Mac unusable. APFS was not made for HDD. I added an external USB Samsung T7 SSD as the boot drive. Even though this Mac only has a 5 Gb/s USB type A port, the performance improved dramatically. This includes the boot time. Your Mac has 10 Gb/s USB type C ports, so I would expect even better performance. Evidently, Macs preform TRIM operations when booting, which can increase boot times. However, the Samsung T7 does not support TRIM, so this will not be a factor. There are reports stating the lack of TRIM will eventually slow down a SSD, but I have not noticed any slow down. I theorize that even at the drive's slowest speed, the drive is still operating faster than the 5 Gb/s USB interface. For reference purposes, below is the output from the System Information application. Your Mac would report a speed of up to 10 Gb/s.\n\nAnother possibility is to add a external Thunderbolt 3 Samsung X5 SSD as the boot drive. These drives are significantly more expansive that the Samsung T7, but the interface is 40 Gb/s. I have one of these drives connected to a 2018 Mac mini. The Mac reports that TRIM is supported and enabled when the Samsung X5 is connected. I have booted Mojave from the PCIe-based internal SSD storage and the external Samsung X5 SSD. I can report that I do not really notice any difference in performance. However, the specifications state the Samsung X5 should have a slightly slower transfer rate. For reference purposes, below is the output from the System Information application.\n\nI should also note that the external Samsung X5 is also reported to be a NVMExpress device, just like the PCIe-based internal SSD storage. (Boot Camp was added manually. You can not use the Boot Camp Assistant to install Windows on external drives.) Note that the Thunderbolt drive is disk0 even though the Mac is current booted to Mojave from the internal drive.\n\nReferences:\nHow do you upgrade the hard drive or SSD in the \"Tapered Edge\" Aluminum iMac models?

Does it depend on the Bluetooth device?\nIt makes sense if the GPS signal can be provided to two iPhones if there are two people hiking together, but maybe it takes extra design steps to make such a Bluetooth device.\n\nA: Yes, this depends on the Bluetooth device.\nAlso note that there's a difference in pairing multiple phones with the same device, and actually be actively using the device from multiple phones at the same time.\nI do not think it is common for Bluetooth devices to allow the latter in this use case, however it is ofcourse possible to implement for the device maker (at the extreme including two separate Bluetooth modules).\n", "Q: How to delete hidden login iterms from backgrounditems.btm? CML way is prefered I am running MacOS Big Sur. I installed some apps downloaded online. I found out many apps were started automatically at startup.\nBy googling and examining my system, I figured out they were started from the file backgrounditems.btm which is located at ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagementagent/. The file stores Login Items.\nBy running a python script downloaded online, I can see many Login Items registerd in the file backgrounditems.btm and they are NOT shown in System Preferences > Users > myuser > Login Iterms.\nI tried the command osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to delete login item \"name\"' to delete the hidden login iterm, but failed with error message \"36:73: execution error: System Events got an error: Can’t get login item \"myapp.app\". (-1728)\"\nThese hidden login iterms are also NOT shown when I use the command osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to get the name of every login item'.\nSo my question is how to remove those unwanted login iterms to stop them autostart at my login. Command Line Way is prefered. I think some GUI apps such as ccleaner may do the job, but I don't want to install some GUI apps which may be autostarted themselves. Basically, I don't want to install an autostart iterm to remove autostart items.\nThanks a lot.\nUpdate\nI figured out the file is in a binary plist format.\nThen I tried two tools.\nOne is the default cml tool plutil. Another one is a thirdy party tool ProperTree. Both can convert and open the binary plist as XML plain plist. But even with a plain plist format, it's kinda hard to understand it. The important sections are still coded in base64 format in xml.\nI can decode base64 with many tools, but I still feel it's kinda too much work for this purpose. Do anyone know any easier way to remove hidden login iterms from the file? Thanks.\n\nA: I don't think it is necessary to remove them using the commands. You can do it from settings.\n\nOpen System Preferences and click on Users & Groups, then click the Login Items >tab. You’ll see a list of apps (and even files and folders) that open every time you log in. - Macworld\n\n\nA: Parsing plists\nYou can use the command:\nfaq -f plist -o json '.[\"$objects\"][] | objects | select(.hidden == true)' ~/Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagementagent/backgrounditems.btm | less\n\nThis will list entries in backgrounditems.btm that are hidden. It uses faq which works like jq but with many different file formats supported for input, including .plists.\nYou could use faq to write a query for that excludes only these entries, or use vim-plist to open the file in vim and remove whatever you like.\nYou might want to check the following if you haven't first though. These seem to be the more likely culprits for your issue...\nLaunchDaemons & LaunchAgents\nHave you checked the Launch Daemons and Launch Agents at ~/Library/LaunchAgents, /Library/LaunchDaemons, and /Library/LaunchAgents?

I.e. some of the keystrokes do not appear in my editor/browser. Also moving the complementary mouse (connected to the same dongle) makes very sluggish moves on screen. It affects all keys.

The keyboard would intermittently skip keystrokes when the keyboard USB transceiver is connected via a USB hub (e.g. anker premium usb-c hub, choetech 7-in-1 usb-c hub).\nIt's not a complete solution, but the problem does not occur when the keyboard transceiver is connected directly to the MacBook (on older models pre usb-c), or via the official simple Apple usb-c to usb adapter, model A1632 (I have not tested the AV multiport one): https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJ1M2AM/A/usb-c-to-usb-adapter\n\nA: I purchased a USB-C to USB-A from Apple that is A1632 and my sculpt works fine now...\nI had a J5create USB hub where I had the same issue mentioned above...\n", "Q: Can't see video files on memory card I have an Extreme PRO 64GB SanDisk memory card for my Canon camera. In macOS I can view the pictures I took, but not the videos. They just don't show up in the Finder window but I can watch them on the camera.\nHow can I access the videos?\n\nA: Make sure they are not stored in the Camera internal memory (if has one).\nVideos are usually much bigger files. What you can try is to open the mounted memory card, switch to List view and select “Calculate sizes” in CMD + J dialog. Sort files by size and dig deeper in the biggest folders until you find the biggest files.\nOr try to identify approximate average size of photos and based on that you can try to search for files in the most top folder level of the memory card by pressing CMD + F and with small plus sign button you can add “File Size” criteria with “is greater than” option and put there value you identified or just something like 20 MB.\nYou may find files that are big but not playable by Quicktime or any video player currently installed on your Mac which means the camera uses its own format that you may need to convert.\n", "Q: Action on Middle-Click on Desktop For years, when I used X, I had it configured so that a middle-click on the background would instantly create an xterm right there.

Your question does not provide enough information that can be used to generate an exact answer. I would need to know which version of firmware is currently installed on your Mac. This firmware is tied to the latest version of macOS (OS X) that was installed on your Mac. You may need later firmware to boot the Windows 10 installer from an ExFAT formatted volume. Also, I would need to know the Windows 10 ISO version and how the ISO was obtained. The contains of early Windows 10 ISOs would fit on FAT32 formatted volumes. The latest Windows 10 ISOs can contain an install.wim file that exceeds 4 GB file limit of FAT32 formatted volumes. However, the latest Windows 10 ISOs download on a PC using the Media Creation Tool may instead contain a install.esd file that would fit on a FAT32 formatted volume. However, Apple recommends using the Windows 10 ISO directly downloaded from the internet.\nFinally, to install Windows 10, you need the correct Windows Support Software for your model Mac. The usual method of acquiring the Windows Support Software is by directing the Boot Camp Assistant to download. This would require first installing the latest macOS compatible with your Mac. After downloading to an external drive, you can erase the internal SSD. Using the Boot Camp Assistant installed on a different Mac will probably result in the wrong Windows Support Software being downloaded. You can also download the Windows Support Software using a PC, but this is a far more complicated process. Therefore, I would recommend using the PC to download the Windows Support Software only as a last resort.\n", "Q: A launchd job without plist file, how does that work and how to find what job triggers it?

I delete the file compeletely with command rm backgrounditems.btm, but magically, after I shutdown and restart the system, this login iterm will automatically be created again inside a new backgrounditems.btm file.\nI am thinking to change this file's owner and group permission.

I am having really a hard time to trace how they auto started.\nTake an example, com.xunlei.Thunder.ThunderHelper is always started automatically after the system starts.\nSo far, I found out there were two things which are related to this process autostart.\nOne is from launchd job (no .plist file):\n$ launchctl list | grep -i thunder\n405 0   com.xunlei.Thunder.ThunderHelper\n\n$ launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.xunlei.Thunder.ThunderHelper\n...\n    path = (submitted by otherbsd.330)\n    program identifier = com.xunlei.Thunder.ThunderHelper\n    parent bundle identifier = com.xunlei.Thunder\n...\n\nOne is a hidden login iterm from $HOME/Library/Application Support/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagementagent/backgrounditems.btm file.

(might not be true)\nIf this is true, it will be very scary!\nHow can I stop MacOS doing this scary thing? Why does it search my entire drive everytime at startup and try to find a helper app to start and add to login iterms too? It's really unbelievable.\n\nA: This is not actually scary - it is intended, well defined and documented behavior.\nApplications on macOS can come with a helper application that is run in the background. The helper app is stored within the application bundle of the main app and managed through the Service Management framework.\nWhen you add an app to a macOS computer, the system will look into the application bundle to determine how this app relates to the system. In particular things such as:\n\n*\n\n*which types of files can this program open\n\n*which icon should be displayed\n\n*does this program require a background helper application\n\nAs you can install applications in any folder on a Mac, this detection and inspection happens everywhere. In particular, you do not have to install apps in the /Applications folder. It does not involve the system \"searching the entire hard drive\", as application bundles are already specially marked. When an application bundle is added to the file system (or moved around), the system knows about it and keeps note of the above mentioned information.\nRegistering helper applications by including them in the application bundle is actually the recommended method for apps that are sandboxed (i.e. for example coming from the Mac App Store), as these apps are not allowed themselves to create files outside the sandbox.\nIf the application does not itself include an option to disable the helper application, it is because the app developer has decided that their application cannot function with the helper. The correct way to uninstall the helper application is to uninstall the main app.\nIn order to manually inactivate the login item, the least \"aggressive\" method is to change the Info.plist file inside the application bundle. Using the Property List Editor find the key SMLoginItemSetEnabled and change the associated boolean value to false.\nYou could also be more aggressive and manually delete the contents of the <app>.bundle/Contents/Library/LoginItems folder.\nIn any case, you risk the app itself not working - and you will have to be wary of application updates that reverse this change.\n", "Q: Logitech Options won't let me change the \"Keystroke assignment\" assigned to a mouse button anymore Logitech Options won't let me change the \"Keystroke assignment\" assigned to a mouse button anymore.

But what about setting it to be mouse button 4, 5, or 6?\nThere are many programs that will let me bind functionality to mouse buttons 4, 5, and 6, etc. But my Logitech mice do not seem willing to expose their extra buttons as just generic mouse buttons. It's very frustrating!\nIf there's no way to make this work for a Logitech mouse, does anyone have any recommendations for a good ergonomic mouse that has some side buttons and merely exposes these as simple generic mouse buttons that apps can identify as such?\nP.S. I'm using Catalina at the moment.\n\nA: It turns out that if you uninstall or disable Logi Options in the System Preferences, then at least two of the side buttons on Logitech mice seem to appear as standard mouse events. I.e., Mouse Button 4 and Mouse Button 5.\nHaving Logi Options configured to do Input Monitoring in System Preferences, which is required for Logi Options to work, blocks apps from seeing Mouse Button 4 and Mouse Button 5 events. And Logi Options itself has no option to just let these events pass through Logi Options unmolested.\n\nA: If you are not finding what you are looking for in the software provided by Logitech for their USB Mac mice there are indeed other ways to do what you want to do.\nThough I have not used either one of these products, they have been around for quite a while and seem to be well supported by their developers.\nI was reminded of these recently on https://MacInTouch.com featuring info about recent updates to a couple of programs that let you customize USB devices that otherwise don't offer Mac software, or their Mac software is not that great.\nThe first is Steer Mouse and the second is USB Overdrive. Either of these should provide at least some, if not all, of the functionality you desire.\n", "Q: Is there any MacBook-supported filesystem that will not do a scan every time its underlying external HDD gets unplugged without eject? Currently, with ExFAT filesystem on an external HDD connected to a MacBook Pro I experience very long scan times (proportional to the size of the HDD, several TBs in this case; MacOS is used here) whenever I plug the drive after it was accidentally unplugged without ejecting the drive first.\nWhile I understand the reason behind it, it is sometimes unacceptable to wait for hours before I can start using it again.\nTherefore I am looking for filesystems that wouldn't render the drive unusable for hours whenever that happens.\nAny suggestion is appreciated, the internet yields no immediate solutions/answers, and I would really like to avoid answering myself by testing filesystems - if this kind of info already exists somewhere out there.\n\nA: When a file system is improperly disconnected, the is a likelihood that there are partially completed write operations. In the simplest cases this might just lead to the corruption of a single file.  But if the file system was in the middle of making a directory/folder change this would lead to the whole folder being corrupt.  In the worst case, it could make the file system unusable.\nSo it is a good thing that macOS makes sure that the file system on any improperly ejected file system is intact and in a consistent state.  You would be very unhappy if there were any problems with the file system that led to a loss of data.\nFor simple file systems the checking needs to be of the whole file system.  And that is slow, as you know!  But, worse, there is a good chance that the disk may become unusable if it was in the middle of multiple write operations.\nMore modern file systems keep a journal of changes so that after an improper ejection, the file system can be set back to a consistent state - undoing any partially completed operations. As well as being more sure, recovery is much quicker than for older file systems. This technology (and its theoretical basis) was developed for databases (in the 1970 and 80s) and later extended to whole file systems.\nBoth the HFS+ and APFS file systems are journaled and are the usual file systems for disks used only on Apple systems.  Windows NTFS is also journaled, but not so easily used with macOS.\nSo the short answer is to use APFS or HFS+.  Recovery will not be instantaneous (and macOS may complain about the mistreatment of the disk), but it will be quicker and more certain than when using exFAT. For better recovery use APFS rather than HFS+.\nBut, be aware that accidentally unplugging a disk (particularly an HDD) can lead to physical problems on the disk drive. So don't make a practice of improper ejection if you value your data!\n", "Q: Why does Skype want to use a \"Xcode Server Builder Identity\" key? While examining some features of XCode, I briefly enabled the XCode Continuous Integration Server. The following dialog box now pops up:\n\nSkype wants to sign using key \"Xcode Server Builder Identity\" in your keychain.\nTo allow this, enter the \"login\" keychain password.\n\nIf I choose \"Allow\" or \"Deny\", the dialog box will pop back up roughly a half dozen times in succession. Using Keychain Access, I find no item named \"Xcode Server Builder Identity\" in the login keychain or otherwise (the only item mentioning \"XCode\" in the login keychain predates any of this), nor in the server certificates for the system Apache server (which the XCode server seemed to want to use).\nWhy is Skype trying to use this key? Where is it stored? How can I stop the prompts (short of always allowing access)?\n\nA: An identity is a certificate with a private key. It's possibly Skype checks the keychain for identities so it can authenticate itself with a server when setting up a secure connection (server authentication is mandatory with secure connections; client authentication is optional).\n\nWhere is it stored?\n\nAs not all items stored in a keychain are shown in Keychain Access, the security utility can (must?) be used to show them instead. The message mentions an identity; the find-identity security subcommand can be used. The options to find-security are limited, and don't include options to filter based on name, label, description, creator or many of the other filters other subcommands take.

Only 5 of these are Mac Pros and of those, none are the current model of the Mac Pro (MacPro 7,1).\nAdditionally, from my own experimenting around, any version of ESXi (up to and including 7.0b) fails to successfully install on a Mac that already has Big Sur installed.  It boots and the ESXi installer runs, but ultimately it fails.\nAnd since Big Sur has been out for 5 months and no version of ESXi (that I am aware of) will install on a machine running that, I have to conclude that VMware and/or Apple isn't serious about supporting ESXi natively on Apple hardware.\nMy plan was to purchase Apple hardware (a rack mounted Mac Pro) so I could run, among other OSes, a virtual Mac.  But this goal is looking more and more unrealistic.\nHave I missed something?  Are people out there successfully installing ESXi over their MacPro7,1 machine's Mac OS Big Sur (specifically Big Sur)?  Has anyone successfully installed any version of ESXi on top of Big Sur running on any Mac (i.e. not necessarily the MacPro 7,1)? And if people are able to do this, how are they doing it?  I have been using UNetbootin to create bootable flash drives from ESXi ISO images.  These all boot and run the ESXi installer (regardless of ESXi version), but the ESXi installer never completes successfully.\nAnd... when I say \"on top of\" I mean replacing the existing Big Sur OS with ESXi such that booting the machine takes you straight into ESXi.\n\n\nA: I don't believe that Apple has any goal of supporting ESXi natively. Officially Apple supports installation of macOS and Windows via bootcamp on certain Apple hardware, afiak.\nI believe the ball is in VMware's court: if VMware wants to include support for Apple hardware configurations they're free to do so. They even might get lucky and an Apple product matches a hardware configuration that they already support. I'm not aware of Apple contributing to the VMware code, and from what I understand Apple is not likely to design a hardware configuration specifically around the ability to support existing ESXi code.\nIf you want to run VMWare guest operating systems on Apple hardware that isn't explicitly supported by VMWare for ESXi you might want to investigate if VMWare Fusion meets your requirements.\n\nA: Apple doesn’t likely care what you run on their hardware as long as you buy Macs and don’t violate the license terms. To back this up:\n\n*\n\n*The licensing terms explain how virtualization is and is not allowed. Fairly explicit terms are added recently, so read the EULA is you’re big into this or need to be professional about this scenario.\n\n*Apple allows unsigned OS to be installed on all new hardware even though they could lock down Macs and have the tool chain and hardware in place that locks down iOS and iPadOS devices (etc...). Apple documents this officially in support articles.\n\n*Apple offers professional services and enterprise level support if you want to pay fir it either directly or through volume of sales. You get dedicated Apple Engineers and support to work through issues like you outlined.\n\nVMWare cares a lot about their esxi product. Being on the HCL is a big deal. They put substantial money and resources to test and vet and support every item on the compatible list. It means they have test labs and people with the gear to test. And not just two machines, they wrangle all the driver versions, and anything has to work with anything, so imaging testing dozens of drives and network adapters and firmware levels and more. Each time you add three new versions, that might be a hundred tests to do with the rest of the test matrix. Lots of gear works very well before it gets officially added to that list.\n\n*\n\n*Support means I have to license ESXi but when I have an issue, I can call them for support and my problem becomes their problem with 24x7 SLA possible and response times contractually agreed upon if my situation is production down.\n\n*VMWAre hires amazing people that are available at conferences, blog publicly, are available on social media as well as in user groups and official support capacities. There is a lot of meaningful support provided before a system is “blessed”\n\n*https://blogs.vmware.com/euc/2020/12/apple-m1-chip-how-vmware-makes-it-work-for-the-enterprise.html\n\n*https://www.virtuallyghetto.com/apple\nNow, back to your plans. I would start with an Intel Mac mini and M1 Mac mini before you pay for the Mac Pro unless you have substantial budget for testing. You can rent gear one as well either direct or co-located. People have been running ESXi on the Mac Pros soon after they released and same on M1 and Big Sur soon after things were announced at WWDC. It’s a matter of spending the time on it and pushing ahead when it’s not supported, so I get you can’t click one button and be done, but how people ar doing this is putting in a lot of work and being detail oriented. We hire full time engineers to do this at work since this task is work. Some of it is not pleasant or easy or intuitive.\nWhen I mentioned rent hardware, check out MacStadium - they can get you the recommended mini to test for $60 a month. Ones in Las Vegas are already set up, waiting for you in 60 minutes or so...\nhttps://www.macstadium.com/configure\n\n\nA: As I understand your question, you have attempted to install ESXi on Mac hardware that is listed on the VMware HCL, but the installer failed near the end.\nYou then conclude that this must be because of Big Sur. However, I do not see how Big Sur itself could have anything to do with that, since Big Sur does not run when installing VMware ESXi or when running VMware ESXi after installation.\nInstead what you should do is to contact VMware support. As you have hardware that is officially supported, failure of the installer to work is either a bug in the installer or a misconfiguration/misuse from your side. Contact VMware support and have them guide you in getting the installer to finish. It might be that you have unsupported third party hardware connected (most notably you will probably have third party storage connected to the Mac) which is causing the problem.\n", "Q: Best macOS for 13 inch MacBook Pro mid 2012 What is the best macOS for MacBook Pro 13 inch mid 2012. macOS Catalina is running very slow.\n\nA: Your question is based on the premise that it is the OS that is causing the slowness. That needs testing, first of all.\nIf Apple says an OS will run on that Mac, that means it should run fine. (Indeed, one of the reasons they cut off older Macs is because the new OS doesn't run well.)\nIf you still have the original hard drive, then that's the likeliest cause of slowness, and it should be replaced by an SSD -- to improve reliability, if nothing else. (If you've already done that, then make sure the SSD has at least 20% free space.)\nNot enough RAM could also be a factor (combined with swapping onto slow storage media). If you haven't already maxed it to 16 GB, do so.\nOr it could be that the slowness is caused by software: things you've installed, possibly for a previous OS, that now don't play well on Catalina. Test booting into Safe Boot Mode (hold down shift at boot), or running in a brand new user account that doesn't have all the Login Items and Launch Agents of your existing account.\nThe 'best' OS is the one that lets you run the apps that you need, while supporting your hardware. Your MBP won't run Big Sur, so you're already falling into 'legacy' territory. As time marches on, you'll increasingly have to stay on older versions of apps and not keep up with the newest and shiniest.\n", "Q: Why does Pages constantly freeze on a particular pages document I'm writing a report (4000 words)on Pages in the past few days.

More recent devices have enhanced capabilities including NFC and Bluetooth range estimation - look up Bluetooth Beacons for that iteration of this feature.\nLastly, the most advanced tech that Apple ships is ultra wide band radio chipsets that augment the previous technologies with time of flight measurements to answer hypothetical situations like “Is your watch closer to the HomePod than your phone?” for instance.\nThe hardware and software are capable of mapping out space and time to figure out where they are in the world as well as how close to other devices they may be moment to moment. Apple then synthesizes a reaction based on multiple signals to let you know a hotspot may be near. This can be as simple as hearing a WiFi beacon indicating a device provides this service or a cryptographically signed two way handshake to validate your AppleID signed in recently on two devices and they can trust the identity and validity of a handshake data exchange.\n\nA: This feature is marketed under the name \"Instant Hotspot\" as part of the Continuity framework and is implemented very  using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).\nThe implementation differ slightly depending on whether or not the user is part of \"Family Sharing\", but the end result is the same. Various forms of encryption are used to ensure security, while being able to determine that nearby devices are signed in to the same iCloud account as the current device. Then it can send a BLE message to the iPhone to request Personal Hotspot be turned on, and then it can connect via WiFi as usual.\nBluetooth LE has a limited physical range, so only devices near by the user can \"hear\" these messages, and only those are able to respond to them.\nIf you want to know how this is implemented, I can recommend the independent article \"Handoff All Your Privacy - A Review of Apple's Bluetooth Low Energy Continuity Protocol\".\n", "Q: Sharing contacts with husband who has separate Apple id My husband and I have separate Apple IDs.

Also in the past, the logging system was overhauled to write these logs to a database first so they can be queried and some but not all of the logs end up in files.\nNow, you can’t see the messages on screen and have to either know which files contain portions of the logged messages or query the database directly after the system has started (or indirectly if the system never completes startup).\n\n*\n\n*Where to see kernel startup messages after boot?\nAddressing the “what changed” with Apple Silicon is Apple completed the transition to all machines running under a T2 with a Secure Enclave and other architectural changes to the startup process.

If this Mac was upgraded to Catalina, then this must have beed done using some sort of macOS patch. The original state for a 2008 MacBook Pro would be Leopard, but you seem to indicate you think this is Yosemite. There have been reports Yosemite failing to boot after installation do to expired certificates. You have give no indication where you acquired Yosemite. Perhaps your statement \"it's a ridiculous undertaking to make a Yosemite boot USB while running Big Sur\" means you used your Mac to create the bootable USB Yosemite installer. If true, this still does not indicate where the Yosemite files came from or the method used to create the installer.\nApple has a website How to get old versions of macOS. I assume these downloads have updated certificates. If you use your Mac running Big Sur to create the USB installer for El Capitan (or perhaps Yosemite) you will first have to install Big Sur in a virtual machine. I have tested this using a free version of VMware Fusion Player where the host was running Catalina. After creating the Install OS X El Capitan application in the Big Sur virtual machine, I would copy the Install OS X El Capitan application to the Big Sur host before following these instructions: How to create a bootable installer for macOS.\n\nAn alternative would to follow these instructions to create a bootable USB Snow Leopard installer. After installing Snow Leopard on the 2008 MacBook Pro, install the Mac OS X 10.6.8 Update Combo v1.1. Finally, use the 2008 MacBook Pro to create the Install OS X El Capitan application.

The ABC and US keyboard layouts on Mac OS appear identical in layout. Is there any reason why Apple chose to include two identical keyboard layouts that perform the same functions?\n\nA: As per this Apple Discussion:\n\nYou should use US or ABC.  ABC is just the same as US but you don't have an American flag.  Some users outside the US may find that preferable.\nABC-Extended (formerly called US Extended) is much like US or ABC, but it lets you type a whole lot more accented characters via option key shortcuts.  If you have a need to type Chinese pinyin with tone marks, then ABC-Extended is the one to pick.\n\nApple also provides ABC QWERTZ and ABC AZERTY keyboards, which are the same as the ones called German and French, but without the German and French flags, for users who prefer that.\n", "Q: Stop malware from being executed by launchd I've got this program running on my computer, /var/root/Library/Application Support/.SectionChannel.dp/SectionChanneldd, which Norton has identified as the malware OSX.Malcol.  However, Norton has been thoroughly unhelpful in doing anything about it.  I've tried deleting the file as well as sending a SIGKILL to the running process.  However, it keeps restarting.\nDigging further via Activity Monitor, I discovered that the parent process is launchd.  How can I figure out what is causing launchd to execute this program and stop it?

I'm looking at the size of a folder in get info, and Finder is giving me two different sizes, differing by about 10 GB! I'm curious as to the reason and source of this size difference. In the image below, it appears to be giving both a size of 43.51 GB and 53.24 GB.\n\nIf this is useful, I'm running Catalina 10.15.7.\nThank you!\n\nA: The size of a file is amount of data (in bytes) that it contains. The size of a folder is the total size of all its files.  But the space consumed on disk is nearly always a bit different and can be considerably different.\nSome reasons for disk space being larger than file size:\n\n*\n\n*Small files consume 4K (most obvious in programming project files);\n\n*file extended attributes.\n\nSome reasons for disk space being smaller than file size:\n\n*\n\n*File compression;\n\n*Sparse files which don't use disk for empty blocks.\n\nSome reasons for disk space being smaller than folder size:\n\n*\n\n*Duplicates of files within a folder, share the same space on disk;\n\n*Clones where parts of a file may share space with other files in the folder.\n\nMost of the time we should not worry about the difference.\nBut clones and duplicates become an issue when copying files and folders between file systems as each file will now consume its full disk space on the destination.\n\nA: The size value is the actual size of the uncompressed files while the 'on disk' value is the amount of disk space needed to store the files.\nFrom https://superuser.com/questions/599112/mac-os-x-finder-substantial-disparity-between-size-and-on-disk-values-for-f\nthe file size is the actual size of the data in the file while the 'on disk' size is the size of the actual disk space used by the file.\n", "Q: \"Automator could not convert the input data to the desired type.\" in quick action I want to be able to view a location embedded in a HEIC file quickly by using 'quick action'.\nIt is how it looks like when I tried to use the function via finder.\n\nHere is the definition of the quick action in Automator.\n\nHowever when I run the quick action, I got this error message \"Automator could not convert the input data to the desired type.\"\n\nWhat does it mean and how can I fix it?\n\nA: The Show Location in Maps action in Automator takes a Photos Media Item as input, not a Finder item.\nIn other words, it could be used in conjunction with a Get Selected Photos Item action, but not as the first action in a Automator Service/Quick Action that is set as Workflow receives current [image files] in [Finder].\nHave look at: The “Show Location in Maps” Action\n\n\n\nUpdate to address comment:\n\nIs there any other way I can retrieve the map location and then show it in the Map app?\n\nHere is one way to accomplish the goal...\nThe following example AppleScript code was tested in a Run AppleScript action in an Automator Service/Quick Action under macOS Catalina and worked for me without any issues:\non run {input, parameters}\n    \n    set imageFile to the quoted form of ¬\n        the POSIX path of (the first item of input)\n    \n    set shellCMD to {\"mdls -name kMDItemLatitude -name kMDItemLongitude \", ¬\n        imageFile, \" | awk '{print $NF}'\"} as string\n    \n    set LatLon to paragraphs of (do shell script shellCMD)\n    \n    if (LatLon as string) contains \"null\" then return\n    \n    set latitude to first item of LatLon\n    set longitude to second item of LatLon\n    set mapsLocation to {\"https://maps.apple.com/?ll=\", ¬\n        latitude, \",\", longitude} as string\n    \n    open location mapsLocation\n    tell application \"Maps\" to activate\n    delay 0.5\n    tell application \"System Events\" to ¬\n        keystroke \"D\" using {shift down, command down}\n    \nend run\n\n\nNotes:\n\n*\n\n*As currently coded it only works with one selected image file in Finder.

My iPhone 12 Pro (Max) gets extremely hot (to the point the screen dims, and beyond) with regularity, usually several times per day with just regular use of fairly basic apps.\nOthers have reported the problem as well:\n\nIs there anything that can be done to alleviate this?\n\nA: If you have a cover or case for your phone, you should try removing them as they tend to hold in the heat. Keep you phone out of the sun and use it in a cool area. You can also turn your screen brightness down some and kill background apps you are not using. If that doesn't help turn off Location Sevices on your phone. Do this by going to settings-privacy-location services off.\nThese and other options are described here and here.\n\nA: iPhone overheating? Cool for about 8 minutes\nNote: The iPhone cannot overheat by itself. If it has got very hot, it activates protective measures and, for example, clocks the CPU down so that it cannot really damage itself or other components. The environment has the greatest influence on temperature. For example, don't leave your iPhone out in the sun.\n\nThe operating temperature of current iPhone models is 0º to 35º Celsius, the recommended storage temperature is -20º to 45º.\nIf the iPhone reaches its personal boiling point, two warning messages inform about the associated restrictions. First, Apple's smartphone switches off its flash (a precautionary measure that also applies if the LED is used for too long) and reports new photos with the message:\n\nFlash is disabled. The iPhone needs to cool down before the flash can\nbe used.\n\nIf it gets even warmer in unfavorable ambient temperatures, the iPhone stops operating completely and only allows an emergency call to be made as long as it is still cooled down to the operating temperature.\nIn its support document with the code # HT2101, Apple writes:\n\nTo be able to use your device as soon as possible, turn it off, move\nit to a cooler location, and let it cool down.\n\nOn average, it takes about 8 minutes to rest in the shade.\n", "Q: How to automate find and replace in numbers with a predefined list?

panic after an erase and install is the ideal situation for troubleshooting. It removes all the third party apps and configuration changes and user data as a cause.\nYou are left with three big areas now to blame:\n\n*\n\n*The install process was bad or you have a bad build. (OS is not healthy or correct)\n\n*Your accessories are triggering this condition but the system and OS are healthy and correct.\n\n*Your hardware is deficient and the OS is healthy and correct.\n\nAre you looking for more about what a kernel panic is or more about what you can do next?\n", "Q: How can I clean my keyboard without turning my Macbook Air on? I would like to turn off my Macbook Air in order to clean the keyboard and not repeatedly press buttons. However, when pressing any button, the Macbook immediately turns on again.\nIs there any way to disable this behavior, so that for example only the unmarked button in the top right turns it on?\n\nA: Open a text editor, save a new file called Cleaning_My_Keyboard.md ...and clean away!\nThis will allow you to clean your keyboard with all the depressed keys being \"swallowed\" by the document which you can then Trash when done.\nYes, exactly what I meant. No need to save the file unless you want to try track trends on the dirtiest / most used keys. Also, clean one key at a time to avoid combo shenanigans.\n\nA: You can turn off the Mac using the power button or the Terminal (sudo shutdown -h now).\nThis prevents the keys from turning on the Mac. The only disadvantage, as soon as you accidentally press the power button, it starts.\nAnother option is to run third-party software that blocks accidental keystrokes, such as Keyboard Clean Tool.\n\nA: I find this annoying as hell. It would have been better that just the TouchID button would have turned it on.\nAnyway, what I do is locking it so that it unlocks just with TouchID and then proceed in cleaning the keyboard, since just some FN keys will actually do something in this state, namely brightness & volume.\n", "Q: Securely deleting data in iOS My understanding is that resetting an iOS device by using Erase all Content and Settings is considered secure deleting, as the key for the encryption is obliterated and no data can be recovered.\nJust to be sure: is that still the case if I set up the device with the same Apple ID afterwards? Will iOS generate a new key, or will the system somehow recognize my Account and use the same key all over again?\n\nA: The encryption key is created from the passcode you create to lock the iDevice. The longer and more complex the passcode, the more difficult it will be to decrypt the iDevice disk. I would doubt very highly that the passcode for your device is in any way linked with your Apple ID. Using the same passcode on your iDevice as for your Apple ID is probably not recommended.\nA wealth of information is found on this page at Operational Security, with some pertinent info I've copy/pasted here.\n\nIf you own an up-to-date iPhone, iPad, or iPod, you are already running full disk encryption. iOS devices ship from the factory with non-user configurable encryption – “non-user configurable” means you can’t turn it off even if you want to.\n\n\nCustom Alphanumeric Code: This passcode option provides the strongest security of all. This option should be considered if security is your primary goal. It should also be considered for some other scenarios: if you leave your device unattended, or if your device is at high risk of loss, theft, or capture. A custom alphanumeric passcode should also be used if you use Touch ID to unlock your iOS device and only rarely enter the passcode. This option has one significant downside: it requires the passcode to be entered on the full alphanumeric keyboard. This tiny keyboard offers the most complexity, but is incredibly tedious to work with, especially when you are in a hurry.\n\n\nYou can make a custom alphanumeric passcode even more secure by using some special characters on the iOS keyboard. The letters A, C, E, I, L, N, O, S, U, Y, and Z all contain special characters. For instance, the letter “a” contains the following special characters: à, á, â, ä, æ, ã, å, and ā. To access them, press the desired letter and hold. A pop-up menu will appear. Slide your finger to the desired character and release. Because of the immensity of the iOS keyboard’s character set, incredibly complex passcodes are possible.\n\n\niOS full disk encryption is only as strong as the passcode you use to protect it, so choose  a good one. I recommend a six-digit numeric, but only if you can’t tolerate anything longer. If you can, I say go with a 10 to 12-digit numeric.\n\n\nA: You are set since Apple only uses the passphrase to help generate entropy on the actual key that's used to unlock the data. Apple wrote a very clear white paper that covers the protections and goes into some technical detail.\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/guide/security/passcodes-and-passwords-sec20230a10d/1/web/1\nIf you set up a device with the same passcode 5 times in a row - none of the keys would be the same and no one could get at the data from the device even if you told them your passcode.\nYou are correct - they key is destroyed instantaneously and the data is cryptographically erased. You don't need any special tool to overwrite any of the data since it was previously encrypted and that encryption exists at rest. When you erase the device, the key that unlocks the data was destroyed and no passphrase will get that key back since it never left the Secure Enclave.\n\niCloud is more complicated, since your data lives in Apple’s servers and can be seen on the web, via API on official and unofficial apps, on Windows and on macOS and other devices in addition to your phone.\nThe encryption keys used to encrypt this data when it leaves your device are not the same keys as the ones used to lock the files at rest on the iPhone hardware.\nSo, you buy a new phone and take a picture of your pet. That pet photo is encrypted at rest with a key that’s entangled with your device passphrase, not actually encrypted with that passphrase alone.\nNow - when you sign up for an AppleID or iCloud account - a different password generates a different set of key pairs both in the cloud and on device. Now things are much more complicated than just a device encrypting data at rest, since we have multiple key pairs and signing certificates and multiple computers involved just to get data to iCloud from your phone.\nThe process to sync the data to the cloud doesn’t need to know how to decrypt the data from storage to show it to you or send it to the cloud since iOS and iPhone hardware handle that encryption transparently to the apps. The running OS isn’t necessarily aware the data is encrypted like a fish doesn’t need to know it’s in the water to swim.\nA different encryption is added before that data backs up or syncs to iCloud servers. In the case with the wiped device, when you sign in to iCloud, new key pairs are generated from that sign in event and used to decrypt the pet photo that comes down from the iCloud backup to your wiped phone (or new phone). The iCloud “app” decrypts the data and then the iOS stores it using the new local encryption key from the Secure Enclave (since your passphrase unlocked the device). Once sync is done and the file written to local storage, it is encrypted at rest with a different key than the key used to encrypt the data when it moved to cloud from old device and  back to the new device from the cloud.\nTo wrap up, the pet photo can be encrypted many times, using different keys based on where it’s heading. The same file gets transformed (in a reversible manner) so that when it’s decrypted, the data is the same file so it looks to us like your pet each time we look at that photo.\nThe hardware encryption is different than the software decryption and pulling this off in a way that people can use and not make mistakes in security is a very hard problem to solve.\n", "Q: Attempting to install HP LaserJet on macOS, no DMG I want to install an HP LaserJet Pro M1536 Multifunction Printer on macOS 10.15 Catalina. The printer already works with AirPrint. I'm attempting to setup the scanner.\nI can not find .dmg, only HP Easy Start.app, e.g. Apple Store. HP Smart...\nWhere could I find simple dmg file?\nNote this site:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201465 where it did show previously scanning not supported.\nAdditional question, if no dmg, downloading HP Smart, will scanner work?\n\nA: HP does NOT have a method to install drivers, a simple dmg file. One MUST use app from Apple store; hence must have an AppleId.\n", "Q: How to configure macOS Server 5.11 for CI with XCode? I have a question. I bought macOS Server from the App Store. I want to achieve this basically:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/xcode_guide-continuous_integration/\nHowever, when I open Server, then on the left it is supposed to show XCode under Services, but it isn't.\nI have posed my main question here:\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/1060038/how-to-let-osx-server-show-xcode-as-a-service\nThis is the main problem, but there seem to be a number of subproblems:\n\n*\n\n*How to configure my router? (which ports should be forwarded?)\n\n*In XCode I enabled the Server under XCode > XCode Server ... (with the slider at the top right). I created the extra non-admin account on my Mac and permitted \"node\" through the firewall. Do I need to add a (non-guest) Server Account under Accounts in XCode?\n\n*In XCode, clicking Product > Create Bot ..., gives an alert: \"Creating a bot requires that the project be under source control that is accessible by the server.\" Note: I put this project in the additional XCode Server logged in user account's shared folder, so I don't know why it wouldn't have access to it? What else/what is the default or best location for repo's and how can I set the location?\n\n*In macOS Server itself, how do I configure it? Under Julius's iMac Pro > Settings, ticking '[] Secure shell connections (SSH)' works, when I forward port 22 on the router and allow SSH in the macOS app firewall: I can SSH in over the internet (using my external IP). I haven't ticked the other two boxes. Under Julius's's iMac Pro > Overview the button Reachability Details... goves No available services (again, this is the main problem I think). I set Julius's's iMac Pro > Access to fairly restricted settings (only me, only this Mac), here it says: \"macOS Application Firewall is enabled. Network access may be affected.\" However, I don't know how it may be affected, I can't add XCode here.\n\n\nA: The article you linked is out of date. Xcode Server is now integrated directly into Xcode and OS X Server (now \"macOS Server\") is no longer required.\nHere's an up-to-date tutorial on getting started with Xcode Server:\nhttps://www.raywenderlich.com/12258400-xcode-server-for-ios-getting-started\nI don't think you want to expose your Xcode Server to the internet, so you best use a VPN.\n", "Q: pinentry-mac: disable Keychain storage I'm using pinentry-mac with openfortivpn, to prompt for passwords and tokens. I installed both using Homebrew.\nHowever, there's a button in the pinentry dialog to save to the keychain, and it's checked by default. I'd like to disable this, or at least make it unchecked by default.\nBased on this and this and the source, I've tried both of these:\ndefaults write org.gpgtools.common DisableKeychain -bool yes\ndefaults write org.gpgtools.common UseKeychain false\n\nBut neither had any effect. Anything else I can do?\n\nA: You were close, and helped me find the solution.\nAccording to this line\nThe correct command is\ndefaults write org.gpgtools.common UseKeychain NO\n\n", "Q: Weird folder setup in Big Sur compared to Mojave. Lots of questions I just upgraded to Big Sur from Mojave.\nWhy are there 3 Applications folders in Big Sur?\n\n*\n\n*One listed on main hard drive which seems to contain everything\n\n*Another in system folder: only some programs here. These are also in main folder\n\n*For the third go to System/Volumes/(hard drive name)/   all apps in this folder.\n\nIn this same folder I see the all the folders and files from my previous Mojave system. Should they be there? What do I do with them? Weird place to store files.\n\nA: Everything is correct.  This is all due to the split of the system volume (Macintosh HD or whatever you called it) into a read-only volume and a read-write volume.\nStart by looking at the disk with Disk Utility.  Press Command-2 (or tick Menu -> View -> Show All Devices).  You should see something like this (the names will be different):\n\nWithin the APFS container you can see two volumes.  In myself case BethSSD and BethSSD - Data.  In what follows replace these with your own system volume name.\nBethSSD is the read-only (highly protected) volume created by the macOS install and has the same content same on every Mac with the same version of macOS.\nBethSSD - Data is a read-write volume and contains everything not part of the read-only volume.

Some of these are covered in Apple Support Document HT201065 (\"What to do before you sell, give away, or trade in your Mac\"), but I have a couple of additions:\n\n*\n\n*Do you have Two-Factor Authentication set up for your Apple ID? Is the Mac the only second factor for it? If so, you'll save time and pain later if you set up some other second factor options before erasing it. Either sign into your Apple ID on an iPhone/iPad/other Mac and set that up as trusted, or log into your Apple ID at appleid.apple.com, go to the Security section and add a trusted phone number.\n\n*You may need to deauthorize the Mac in iTunes, and possibly any other subscription services that the Mac is authorized in.\n\n*Turn off Find My/Find My Mac, so the next owner isn't faced with an authorization-locked Mac.\n\n*Sign out of iCloud (in System Preferences) and iMessage (in Messages).\n\n*Unpair any Bluetooth devices that aren't going with the Mac (unless you don't have a wired keyboard and/or mouse for the rest of this process).\n\nOk, now for how to erase the Mac. It sounds like the problem is that your SSD is formatted with the new APFS volume format, but it's starting in an older version of Recovery that doesn't know how to deal with that format. There are a couple of ways to deal with this:\n\n*\n\n*My recommendation would be to download the installer app, and use it to create a bootable installer flash drive. Apple's instructions are in HT201372, but there's one preliminary step missing: format the flash drive with a GPT partition scheme (most come with MBR instead):\n\n*\n\n*Run Disk utility, and plug in the flash drive you want to use.\n\n\n*Choose View menu > Show All Devices.\n\n\n*Select the flash drive (not the volume(s) listed under it).\n\n\n*Click the Erase button. You should see an Erase dialog with Name, Format, and Scheme options. If Scheme isn't there, you may've selected a volume instead of the entire drive; back out and try again.\n\n\n*Leave the name \"Untitled\", set the Format to \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" and the Scheme to \"GUID Partition Map\".\n\n\n*Click Erase and wait for it to finish. If it fails (it does sometimes), try erasing it again.\n\n\n*Once it's successfully erased, quit Disk Utility and run Terminal instead.\n\n\n*Run the createinstallmedia utility in the OS installer. The command will be something like:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Big\\ Sur.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled\n\n(See the Apple Support Document if it's something other than Big Sur.)\n\n\n*Enter your admin password (it won't echo), follow the prompts, and wait for it to set up the drive.\n\n\n*Once that's done, you should be able to select the drive in System Preferences > Startup Disk pane, then restart your Mac. If that doesn't work, restart and hold Option (note: it'd be the power button on an Apple Silicon Mac) to get the startup manager, and select it there.\n\n\n\n\n*If you don't want to do that (or don't have an erasable flash drive available), try restarting with Command-Option-R held down. That should get you Internet Recovery using the latest version of macOS that's compatible with your Mac (Big Sur at this point), and its Disk Utility should know how to deal with the APFS volume.\nThe installer drive is a bit more work, but it gives you a lot more options if anything (else) goes weird during the process, so (again) I'd recommend doing that instead of the Internet Recovery method.\n[EDIT: and as I was writing this, you apparently tried the second method and something else went wrong. According to this question, that might be due to a network problem. Try the installer disk method.]\n", "Q: How to use Spyder keyboard shortcuts with Mac OS I'm using the Spyder IDE to do Python development on macOS. This IDE provides some keyboard shortcuts I'm used to from other platforms, especially\n\n*\n\n*F9 for running a line or selection of lines of codes.\n\n*F5 for running an entire Python script.\n\nUnfortunately they don't seem to work. I found a suggestion to reset the shortcuts within the application by going to Preferences -> keyboard shortcut and restore the defaults. That didn't work for me, so how can I make these shortcuts work?\n\nA: nohillside gave me a good hint and deserves credit for this answer.  On a Mac when using F functions shortcuts where two different items are on that key, you have to use the \"fn\" key first at the left-hand bottom of your Apple keyboard.  If the the F function key has only one item, then you can use it directly without the \"fn\" in front.\nThus, on my own Apple keyboard (and I suspect yours is the same), you don't have to hit fn before F5 or F6.  But, you have to use fn in front of all the others.\nAttempting to resolve this issue through the Preference -> Keyboard path just did not work at all for me, no matter what I tried.  And, I tried a lot of different things.\nnohillside had uncovered another way to attempt to resolve this issue from a GitHub reference.  It seemed incredibly complicated and very invasive suggesting you modify numerous of your Python packages.  That seemed somewhat dangerous.  And, I am just sticking to the fn solution when typing F9.  That's easy enough, and not that tasking.\n\nA: I think you can do great with this app called Custom Shortcuts.\n\nMoreover, if you like to go to the beginning or end of the line you can do it with Fn pressed along with left or right arrows. I think the application above will likely solve your problem.

I'm assuming that the connection that initiates from the remote box ssh's into yours?\nMaybe leveraging something like tmux on the remote server and within the script send the command to ssh to your machine?\nThis article might be worth peeking at.\n", "Q: MacBook charging extremely slowly, after using 3rd party USB-C charger I have a 16\" 2019 MacBook Pro.\nA few days ago, I didn't have my MacBook charger on hand. After a quick internet research of whether or not it works, I borrowed my wife's DELL XPS charger (USB-C, 130W I believe). My MacBook charged fine with it.\nA few days later, I noticed that my MacBook is charging very slowly (with my Apple 96W charger). I reset the SMC, rebooted, tried a different wall outlet, installed all system upgrades. No luck. Charge speed is around 1% point every 20 minutes with all apps closed. When I run a computing intense task (having a lot of Google Chrome tabs open, or compiling code), the battery discharges.\nI checked the battery status with coconutBattery, but things seem to look normal. The only thing that seems off is that charging wattage. I'd expect that to be somewhat close to my 96 watt maximum.\nSee the attached screen shot. Note that this is with all apps closed.\nAre my issues due to my charger experiment a few days ago? Is this just coincidence and my Apple charger went bad?\n\n\nA: The issue eventually resolved itself through a MacOS update. Also no more issues with 3rd party USB-C chargers.\nIf I remember correctly, it was fixed by version 11.2.2, see Apple releases macOS update to prevent damage from third-party docks and dongles.\n\nA: I doubt it's just a coincidence.  There's more to the Apple chargers than just \"give juice to the battery\", but I couldn't tell you what another charger may have done to your system.\nIt could be as simple as an SMC reset (The SMC manages low-level settings such as battery management).\nFrom howtogeek.com:\n\n*\n\n*Unplug the power, then shut down your Mac.\n\n*Hold the left Shift+Control+Option keys down, then press and hold the power button down. Keep all four buttons pressed down for ten seconds, then let go.\n\n*Plug the power cable back in, then turn on your Mac.\n\nHere's the official SMC reset page from apple:  T2,  Intel chip\n", "Q: How to download Macaulay2 for MacBook Pro? I want to install Macaulay2, and first need to install Homebrew for this.\nI was following https://brew.sh/ by putting\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\" \n\ninto my terminal but it asked for a password. I don't know where I would go for this?\nIs there an easier way to get Macaulay2 for my computer? I have the macOS Big Sur version 11.1.\n\nA: Homebrew needs your Mac password because installing most SW (including homebrew) requires permission from an admin user, which is given by you entering your password.  Just enter the same password you use when you log into your Mac, and homebrew should get installed.  Then, you can type brew install Macaulay2/tap/M2 to install it.\nUPDATE: According to https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/Macaulay2/Downloads/MacOSX/index.html you can also download the SW on a disk image and just drag the Macaulay folder to the Applications shortcut in the disk image, like this:\n\nThen follow the instructions in that ReadMe file to complete the configuration steps needed to use this SW.  This will allow you to use this SW on your Mac without any need for homebrew.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use my public IP address to serve a website? (Catalina) I'm a bit new to the topic of servers, ip addresses (public and private), ports, networking, and how all of this stuff ties together.\nPlaying around, I managed to run apache on my mac and get an html page up and running on localhost. I typed my private IP address into another device and I was able to see this page.\nIf I understand correctly, a private IP address is an IP address that's specific to my \"local network\" which I assume is anything connected to my wifi.\nIs it possible to make a webpage that is served from my mac and visible from devices not connected to my local network? I expect to be able to type my public ip address into a URL bar and see this page.\nI am aware that there is an app from the App store related to this topic, but I feel this should be basic functionality that can be done from the Terminal (correct me if I'm wrong).\nThanks for the help!\n\nA: Much will depend on your network set-up and is beyond the scope of a single answer.\nTry with my Miln Beyond application to confirm your primary outgoing IP address, and if a NAT or UPnP device is on your network. This is to test if the devices are configurable and your network is truly publicly accessible.\nUse Beyond's Beyond Network window to see your computer and network's assigned IP addresses:\n\nDo you have another computer or device on a separate network, such as a mobile phone with a data (non-wifi) connection? Use this second device to test access to your server. Testing access using the same network can provide misleading results.\nIf this works, then you can achieve the same via the command line and Apache httpd.\nUnverified Address\nYou commented:\n\nUnverified potentially accessible address. Provided by local Network Address Translation (NAT) or Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) device.\n\nAn \"unverified\" address is potentially accessible from the Internet. It is unverified only because Beyond has not actively checked it (that requires a membership).\nThe listing also suggests that your router supports NAT or UPnP to open external ports and allow incoming traffic.\nDoes your Internet router have a web interface? The router is a device often supplied by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). If so, look for NAT or UPnP settings; these may also be called Port Forwarding.\nBy default, your router should block incoming traffic from the Internet into your network. To offer a server to the wider Internet, your router needs to be told to accept specific incoming traffic and to pass it to the server inside your network.\nFor short lived servers and services, like video/voice calls, NAT and UPnP are used. This is what Beyond has managed to do on your network.\n\nA: Is it possible? Yes. But there are some caveats:\n\n*\n\n*Your Internet Service Provider may (probably does) block servers of any sort from being hosted behind your network - as listed in their terms of service\n\n*Apache (and therefore websites) generally require constant uptime, hosting it on a Mac is not impossible, by any means, but you'd need to keep the computer turned on all the time. Which can eventually slow your computer down to the point it is unusable by you.\n\n*If you get enough traffic (bots, etc) - it may be considered a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by your ISP. They can suspend your service.\n\nIf, for whatever reason, it turns out that your ISP does not block servers on the network, you can use a service like DynDNS to point a hostname to your external IP which makes everything so much easier to remember.\nYou would also need to port-forward port 80 (and/or 443) via your modem to your internal private IP which may or may not change behind your network.\n\nA: There are several ways to achieve this:\n\n*\n\n*The classic way is to configure your router to do \"port forwarding\". You tell it that any connection destined to port 80 should be forwarded to your computer, so anyone trying to make an HTTP request to your public IP address would be sent to the HTTP server on your Mac.\nYou would probably also do the same for port 443 (HTTPS).\nLimitations apply: your ISP must not block inbound traffic (explicitly or implicitly because they would be using CGNAT), you can only forward to a single server...\nInstead of using your public IP address, you can use a dynamic DNS service which will give you a domain name that maps to your IP address and is updated if your IP address changes. If you have a fixed IP address, you can directly point a DNS name to your IP.\n\n\n*Another way is to do tunnelling. Something on your Mac connects to a server on the outside, and a tunnel is created inside this connection, which forwards traffic received on the outside server's IP/port to your server.\nIf you have your own Linux server hosted somewhere, you could use ssh with a remote port forwarding request (-R) to achieve that.\nOr you can use a service like Ngrok which will do that for you. You tell it the local protocol and port on your Mac, and it will give you a publicly accessible URL which is forwarded back to the server on your Mac. There are probably tons of alternatives.\nThere are also more general-purpose VPNs that could be used, but beware of security implications.\nThe drawback of all these methods is that you depend on \"something\" out there on the Internet, and that all traffic will go through this device/service before reaching your home server. This can add latency or bandwidth bottlenecks, and of course there's often a direct or indirect cost as you need to pay for this \"something\".\nNote that in both cases, you should be mindful about security: your local network is normally protected from the outside by NAT, but you're opening a \"hole\". If there are any security issues on the server you run on your Mac, external users may be able to access stuff on your Mac or on the rest of your network they wouldn't usually be able to.\n", "Q: Big Sur: Booting Win10 from SSD and Disable Internal Drive Computer: MBP 15 Late 2013.\nI have a BIOS booting Windows 10 installed on an external SSD. Windows occupies two partition on this SSD. The first is the System partition and the second is a combined Windows and Recovery partition. Below is the output from the command diskutil list.\n\nSince I updated to Big Sur, I can not boot Windows from the external SSD anymore. I get a message that there is no bootable device and the computer restarts booting into macOS on the internal drive. It looks like Apple updated the boot loader (I can not tell from the new graphics), which appears to be connected to the issue. I have tried pretty much everything at this point and the only thing that lets me boot from the SSD is if I completely wipe/format the internal drive.\nIs there a way to disable the internal boot drive so the boot loader doesn't see it?\n(I know this is a work around, but I don't have the time right now to further investigate the issue with the external SSD and why it can't boot from it.)\n\nA: The firmware, stored on the logic board of your Mac, contains both BIOS and UEFI boot loaders. Additionally, the firmware on the logic board contains the Mac Startup Manager, which allows you to choose available startup disks or volumes. You can access the Mac Startup Manager by holding down the Option (⌥) or Alt key immediately after starting or restarting your Mac.\n\nIFAIK, the the Mac Startup Manager can not be configured to to ignore the internal drive.\n\nHowever, there exists other startup (boot) managers which can be configured to ignore the internal drive. One such free product is the rEFInd Boot Manager. To configure rEFInd to only search for BIOS booting external drives, one only has to add the following line to the end of the refind.conf file.\nscanfor biosexternal\n\nFurthermore, the rEFInd Boot Manager can be configured during installation to be accessible from the Mac Startup Manager. The rEFInd Startup Manager can be installed in your existing EFI partition, so you will not have to make changes to your external drive. If desired, rEFInd can silently BIOS boot windows installed on an external drive.\nI used a 2013 iMac to verify your problem with the Mac Startup Manager exists. Next, I installed rEFInd to verify rEFInd would solve the problem. A more detailed explanation is given as an answer to the question Two Bootcamp installations: first one on Internal HDD and second one on external Thunderbolt 2 SSD.\n", "Q: Get notifications for high CPU usage My new laptop has an M1 chip and no fan, and this is great, but it also makes it hard for me to find out when the CPU has been running high (and consuming more battery than usual).\nHow can I make it show notifications whenever the CPU has been running high for a while?\n\nA: I use iStat Menus.  This is the best paid app for showing, via the menubar, how your Mac is performing.  In addition it also can send notifications for a number of performance related events - and that includes high CPU.\nHere is the preference screen for setting alerts:\n\nYou can download iStat Menus for free and use it for 14 days before deciding whether to pay.\n", "Q: 2020 M1 MacBook Pro: Built-in display does not show entire desktop (truncates 300px from right and 200 px from bottom) It seems like I have a desktop which is slightly larger than my screen. When I maximise a window the bottom portion (approx 300 pixels) and right portion (approx 200 px) are not visible. I can move the mouse to that invisible and perform click operations but the pointer is not visible on screen. (It is shown when in the visible region). Attempting to scroll beyond the visible extremities does not pan the screen.\nSee the attached screen shots. For the truncated ones, I captured a portion of the visible regions, starting at the top of the screen and moving to the right-most visible (or bottom most).  For the non-truncated ones I moved the mouse enough such that I could be confident of being at the extremity of the desktop - but I had to do this unseen.\nHorizontal truncation:\n\n\nThe same thing happens with vertical truncation, but the images take up a lot of vertical space in this post and don't really add much (though I can add them if this is desired).\nI've had to move the Dock to the left of the screen in order to make it visible but I would prefer to keep it on the bottom.\nIn terms of my machine setup:\nI'm using a new 2020 issued M1 MacBook Pro running Big Sur. I've tried both with and without an external display. With an external display, that external display shows fine (and has no truncated region). But in both setups, the built-in display of the laptop is truncated.\nIn case it matters: I migrated my data to it from a 2015 edition MacBook Pro which had been upgraded to Mojave.\nI've tried looking in System Preferences but don't see anything related to screen size in the Displays subsection. I've also tried looking for zoom/magnifying settings (such as might be used for a11y reasons), again to no avail.\nI'd welcome suggestions for things to try here.\n\nA: Previous reboots did not recover desired behaviour. But having checked the presence or absence of symptoms during Recovery Mode as per Andreas Ley's comment in my original question (behaviour was normal), I reboot again into normal mode and correct behaviour remained.\nSo I don't know specifically what was at fault, but an interim Recovery Mode reboot helped to remedy the situation.\n\nA: I believe the following happened:\nYour MacBook display's native resolution is 2560x1600. However, the default setting on the 13-inch MacBooks is 1440x900@2x (making the UI slightly larger for better accessibility). What the MacBook is supposed to do:\n\n*\n\n*Render screen at 2880x1800 (to create 1440x900@2x)\n\n*Scale down to 2560x1600\n\nIt seems your MacBook failed to do step 2 and just displayed the unscaled image natively, thereby truncating 320px vertically and 200px horizontally.\nAlthough I'm not sure what caused this, the reboot into Recovery Mode might have forced a reset of the scaling settings, fixing the issue. Maybe choosing a different scaling for the display might have worked, too.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my 2020 M1 MacBook Air and a cheap Lenovo VGA monitor.\nI didn't want to reboot so I set up my external display again and attached it back to the MBA. Some of the Windows appeared on the external screen but the built-in one was still \"confused\" about its resolution.\nI went into the Display Settings and turned mirroring on and off a couple of times but this did not fix it. Since I've noticed removing a USB stick behaves differently if I remove it first from the USB-C adaptor vs together with the adaptor, I tried disconnecting and reconnecting the external display both from the USB-C adaptor still attached to the computer, and from the computer still attached to the display. I then turned mirroring off and on a couple more times. Finally I closed the lid for 30 seconds and opened it again.\nThe built-in display was now correct and stayed correct after disconnecting the external display.\nThis is not deterministic since I'm not sure which exact step or sequence of steps was the one that finally fixed the problem. If it happens again I'll try to narrow it down.\nIf this happens to anyone else, fiddling with these few things could fix it for you.\n", "Q: Transfer accounts from Mac or iPhone to new iPad?

I just got a new email account and don't want to manually configure each device.\n\nA: Not exactly sure what you mean: if you use the same Apple ID on both devices and you have enabled iCloud storage for keychain, mail, whatever else on the iPhone - assuming that it’s holding all the data you want on the iPad - you’re done.\n", "Q: MacBook Air 13\" 2014 Turned off randomly, won't turn back on I was using my 2014 MacBook Air 13\" (A1466) and the screen suddenly went black and the fans spun up to full speed. I have not been able to turn it on ever since, even after resetting the SMC and PRAM. Nothing happens when the power button is pressed, the backlight/screen doesn't come on, the fans don't spin up either. When plugged in, the orange light on the charger comes on.  What can I do to try fix my MacBook?\n\nA: I don't think there's much you can do except for contacting Apple Support. You can test if the issue is with your display by using Target Disk Mode and booting up off of your Mac. This allows your Mac to act as a hard disk. To boot in Target Disk Mode, press T on your Mac when it is turned off. Then, you will need another Mac. Use a ThunderBolt cable to connect the Macs, restart the second Mac (the working one), and press Option while it starts up. If you see your Mac that doesn't work in the Boot Menu of your Mac that does work, then your computer still partially works and you can recover your data. If it doesn't then again, your best option is to replace the Mac or contact Apple Support.\n", "Q: @ symbol conflicts with IntelliJ shortcut I am using IntelliJ 2021.1 where the VCS menus has been renamed to \"Git\" and a Swiss French keyboard, the problem is that when I try to insert an \"@\" in my code I have to press option + g (the normal location of an @ on a keyboard of this type), which automatically also opens the \"Git\" menu...so I end with a typed \"@\" but also a menu opened without focus...\nI have tried to look for the IntelliJ shortcuts but this one is not listed and the same is true for the Mac shortcuts.\nDo you have any suggestion?\n\nA: Apparently there is no solution for the moment (they are discussing about it since 2017) see here\nWith a lot of shame, I propose as a workaround to define a new live template in IntelliJ and use that one to type @.

I have an internally-maintained macOS app for my macOS Catalina-based enterprise environment which:\n\n*\n\n*Must run as root (it accesses a privileged device API)\n\n*Runs in the background without a UI (via LSUIElement key set to true in its Info.plist)\n\n*Must run for every user who logs into a workstation without manual configuration (e.g. no manual Login Item configuration)\n\nCreating a LaunchDaemon to launch the app seemed to be the right way to accomplish this. However, the app process is found to be hanging after first user login, presumably because it tries to start too early before app/window-supporting libraries are available (I thought setting LSUIElement to true would avoid this, but I guess not. If there's another Info.plist setting for the app I should use to accomplish this, I'm all ears). There are no errors related to the process or launchd service observed in system.log.\nI've observed after login that if I kill the hanging process and the LaunchDaemon restarts it, it then works fine. So, all I think I need is a way to setup my LaunchDaemon plist so that the LaunchDaemon only launches the app on user login like a LaunchAgent, (which I can't use because LaunchAgents can't run as root). Does anyone have a tried and true plist configuration which accomplishes this?

My question is mostly in the subject line, but I'll add more clarity.\nWhenever my device is in Do Not Disturb mode, it supresses all notifications exactly like one would expect.  The issue is when I disable it in the morning either manually, or canceling my wake-up alarm, the notifications that use banners all come streaming in one after the other after the other after the other, etc.\nIt is beyond frustrating, especially when you're trying to do something like reading the subject of an email in the mail app.  A banner notification comes in and covers it. I swipe it away. Another banner immediately comes in, covering it right back up again! I swipe that one away... Another banner comes in!!\nMy choices are...\n\n*\n\n*Turn Do Not Disturb back on (delaying the problem until later)\n\n*Dismissing all notifications from the Home Screen (so now I don't know what they were!)\n\n*Hurl the phone at the wall with sufficient velocity to stop said notifications permanently (always feels like the 'right option' at the time, but it usually subsides moments later.)\n\nSimply put, there is never a case where to me it makes sense to stream them all in one-by-one at the top of the screen like that, especially if I have manually swiped them away.\nIn a perfect world, you'd get a single banner that said 'While you were away, you received xxx notifications' and tap it to go to the notification center, but I'd be happy with the ability to have it the way it is now so long as I'm given the option to say 'Stop notification banners for already-delivered notifications.'\nPoint being even if I did want to read them all right then, that is the most inefficient way to do so!\nSo... does anyone know how to say 'Hey... stop showing the @#$% banners one by one!  It is beyond intrusive and incredibly frustrating.\n\nA: Allow those notifications to go to the Notification Center as well.

I am recording Zoom meetings with my Windows machine and storing the videos on an external hard drive. I wanted to consolidate the folders by adding videos I have recorded on my Mac, but I realize I cannot just switch the external hard drive between the two machines.\nWhy is that possible when using a USB Flash Drive?\nShould I then store the videos temporarily on a USB drive on one machine, and then use that to transfer the videos to a permanent external hard drive connected to another machine?\n\nA: The issue is not the type of external drive you use e.g. Flash Drive, Hard Disk etc but how the drive is formatted.\nWindows and macOS can both read and write FAT and exFAT formatted drives. A flash drive defaults to one of these depending on its size.\nBy default Windows drives are formatted to NTFS. macOS includes (or perhaps used to include) a driver that allows these to be mounted and read but not written to. You can buy third party programs that allow writing to an NTFS volume from macOS. (There is an open source version but I am not certain that works with later macOS)\nmacOS will format a drive in APFS or HFS+. Windows can only read those with the help of a third party tool.\nSo if you want interoperability then you need a third party program or format the drive in exFAT. The downside of the FATlike formats is that the disk cannot hold metadata, for example owner, execution information and is not journaled so that you need to explicitly unmount the drive before removing it otherwise data could be corrupted on the drive.\n", "Q: Apple Watch not unlocking Mac I have an Apple Watch Series 3 and MacBook Pro 2017.

I can't use my Apple Watch to unlock the MacBook.  Does anyone know how to fix this?\n\nA: Well I thought I figured it out, but it stopped working shortly after.  So after much troubleshooting, I really did figure it out.  Wifi has to be enabled on the Apple Watch for the unlock to work.\nIt's funny that none of the apple support documents say that.

I noticed that there are now 3 mds processes rather than 5:\nAnthony@Vincent ~ % sudo lsof +d /Volumes/LaCie.Backup\nCOMMAND PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\nmds      90 root   21r   DIR   1,16      510    2 /Volumes/LaCie.Backup\nmds      90 root   24r   DIR   1,16      510    2 /Volumes/LaCie.Backup\nmds      90 root   28r   DIR   1,16      510    2 /Volumes/LaCie.Backup\n\nRight-clicking and selecting Eject from the context menu still takes quite a while to eject the drive. During that time, I ran the lsof command and received the following output:\nAnthony@Vincent ~ % sudo lsof +d /Volumes/LaCie.Backup\nlsof: WARNING -- child process 73283 may be hung.\nCOMMAND PID    USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF  NODE NAME\nFinder  431 Anthony   15r   DIR    1,6      160 23740 /Volumes\nFinder  431 Anthony   16r   DIR    1,6      160 23740 /Volumes\n\nThe Finder commands appeared in the results right before the drive disappeared from the desktop.\nHowever, running diskutil unmount /dev/disk3 from Terminal ejects the drive almost immediately.\nWhy would Finder take so long to eject the drive? I would've thought Finder was using diskutil in the background.\nUpdate #3 (final update)\nAfter a reboot, Finder, diskutil, and Alfred -- the 3 ways I use to eject this drive -- all seem to work fine. My Mac also restarts and shuts down much faster.\nThank you @jaume for the constructive comments. Can a comment be marked as an answer?\nUpdate #4 (Final, FINAL, update, post accepted answer)\nA month or so on from this, I was still having slow eject times. My tests ejecting the drive were done after a reboot but before Time Machine had a chance to run.\nThe answer from Jaume was helpful but I don't think it solved the problem.\nThe drive was purchased when I was running Catalina and I don't think Catalina supported Time Machine disks formatted with APFS. Now that Big Sur does support the format, I updated the drive to APFS and the eject times are now in the 5 second range.\nAfter numerous restarts and Time Machine backups, the disk is quickly ejecting.\nAlso, in Big Sur, Time Machine drives are no longer able to be added to Spotlight Privacy:\n\n\nA: Some process (or processes) seem to be accessing the drive and preventing it from ejecting. You can list those processes with this command:\nsudo lsof +d /Volumes/<Time Machine hard drive name>\n\nwhich displays all running processes that are accessing the folder /Volumes/<Time Machine hard drive name>\nFrom the information in your post, the culprit is mds:\nsudo lsof +d /Volumes/LaCie.Backup\nCOMMAND PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\nmds      90 root   21r   DIR   1,16      510    2 /Volumes/LaCie.Backup\nmds      90 root   25r   DIR   1,16      510    2 /Volumes/LaCie.Backup\nmds      90 root   27r   DIR   1,16      510    2 /Volumes/LaCie.Backup\nmds      90 root   31r   DIR   1,16      510    2 /Volumes/LaCie.Backup\nmds      90 root   34r   DIR   1,16      510    2 /Volumes/LaCie.Backup\n\nwhich is the metadata server used by Spotlight.\nIf your Time Machine disk is formatted as HFS+, you can prevent this from happening by adding it to the Spotlight exceptions:\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Spotlight.\n\n*Select the Privacy tab.\n\n*Press the + button, select the Time Machine disk and select \"Choose\".\n\nYou may need to reboot your Mac for changes to take effect.\nNote that the you can't add a Time Machine disk formatted as APFS to the Spotlight exceptions.\n", "Q: How to output results of an AppleScript image resizing script and display in automator I am currently using an automator flow that copies finder items, changes them to jpeg, reveals them, and then runs an applescript that presents a dialog for batch resizing by image width.

integer\n\n\n*Save within if…then block, otherwise every selected file will be re-saved, even when not scaled\n\n\n*Use Image Events to save the files\n\n\n*If your folder is a subfolder of Pictures, you can enable 'Dimensions' in list view, which displays something like '2097 ×\n3014', letting you see which images will be scaled. It doesn't\nupdate rapidly so it won't typically display the changed dimension,\ninstead, it displays '--', which at least has the virtue of\nidentifying which files have been changed.\n\n\n*Progress bar\n\n\n*Track scaled images and raise a notification when done, as well as create a text file log on desktop\n\n\n*Optional: Have a dry run script — tests each image's dimensions and reports back (e.g. count of images to be scaled, filenames of\nimages to be scaled). You could even have it change the selection to only those files in the Finder when complete. Then when you run the\nfinal script, it will be clear which files will change.\nFWIW, I tried using factor to scale but I found that after working for a while, it became erratic, and would often lock up the script (and overheat my mac, and require me to manually quit sips). I grew bored of that and used size (but with forcing new_height to be an integer). After that change, it became more reliable. You may find the tracking unnecessary.\n", "Q: macOS Time announcement -- how to speak a longer phrase In macOS (Big Sur), ever since I did:\ndefaults write ./com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs TimeAnnouncementPrefs -dict u -bool YES\n\nthe system announces the time as, for example, \"four-thirty,\" whereas it used to announce the time as \"It's four-thirty\" (with the word \"it's\" and, on the hour, \"o-clock\").\nHere's the prefs structure (~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs):\n{\n    TimeAnnouncementsEnabled = 1;\n    TimeAnnouncementsIntervalIdentifier = EveryQuarterHourInterval;\n    TimeAnnouncementsPhraseIdentifier = ShortTime;\n    TimeAnnouncementsVoiceSettings =     {\n        CustomVolume = \"0.2046729\";\n    };\n }\n\nI've tried:\n\n*\n\n*With and without TimeAnnouncementsPhraseIdentifier.\n\n*Deleting the file com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs and then turning on the time-anounce checkbox in System Preferences.  That restores the file, but not the long speech.\n\n*Using Time Machine to restore an old version of com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs.\n\nAfter each change, I've killed the Dock to reload the preferences.\nHow do I get back the \"it's\" and \"o'clock\" wording?  What values can TimeAnnouncementsPhraseIdentifier take on?\nEdit: here's the System Preferences pane:\n\n\nA: The solution:\n\n*\n\n*(Optional) to get the plist in com.apple.speech.synthesis.general.prefs correct, set the structure as shown in my original question.  Or, simply delete that file and turn on the Time Announce checkbox in System Preferences (Dock & Menu Bar, Clock).  That will re-create the file.\n\n\n*In the two defaults commands, use -dict-add (rather than -dict) so the commands won't delete any existing parameters.  At this point, the defaults command can be used to turn the time announcements on and off.  But, \"it's\" and \"o-clock\" are still missing.\n\n\n*Reboot, and \"it's\" and \"o'clock\" will return.  I still don't know what values TimeAnnouncementsPhraseIdentifier can take on, but ShortTime works (after a reboot).\nBut, my original idea of using defaults write to change the plist didn't work anyway.  The changes do not take effect without a reboot because the OS caches the plist.\n", "Q: What exactly are the files . and .. on mac? Anecdotally, files called . and .. seem to often (always?) be present inside otherwise 'empty' directories on macOS.\nExample\nCreate a new directory (with nothing in it)\nmkdir test\n\ncd into it\ncd test\n\nand list its contents\nls -a\n.   ..\n\nWhat exactly are these files . and ..?\n\nA: Technically and practically, they represent directory entries for the current directory (.) and the parent directory (..), respectively.\nSo cd . always keeps you in the current directory (useful mainly in scripts when a directory is assigned to a variable and the value should represent just the current directory), whereas cd .. always takes you one level up (unless you are already at /, in which case .. is the same as .).\n\nA: In practical terms, the folders named . and .. refer to the current folder and its parent folder respectively. For the root directory (referred to as /) the .. name simply refers to itself.\nThe \".\" and \"..\" names are special in that they do not necessarily represent something actually stored in the file system on the disk, like other names. In some file systems there are actually hard links named \".\" and \"..\", but other file systems do not store them as such.\nSimilarly on modern operating systems, like macOS, it is possible to mount several file systems onto the same folder structure. At the boundaries of such intersections, the \"..\" doesn't refer to a link stored inside that file system, but rather refers to a folder in a completely different file system.\nIn those case these names are purely virtual, while still providing the same functionality.\nThe presence of these names are actually dictated by the POSIX standard for operating systems, which macOS has been certified against since 10.5. In particular the standard specifies that:\n\nThe special filename dot shall refer to the directory specified by its predecessor. The special filename dot-dot shall refer to the parent directory of its predecessor directory. As a special case, in the root directory, dot-dot may refer to the root directory itself.\n\nWhen using the command line interface, you'll quickly become used to the .. name, as you often use commands like cd .. to go the parent folder.\nThe . name serves an important function in terms of security, as it is used to indicate to the shell (the command line interface) that you want to run a program located in the current folder instead of a system supplied command in another location. Imagine that we did not have the . name, and the system simply started the program in the current folder without having it explicitly stated - then a malicious user could add programs with names of common commands to folders on the computer, and when another user came across this folder and intended to run a common command (such as ls for listing files or cd for changing directory) they would instead be starting a malicious program.\nHistorically these names . and .. have been used on many different operating systems, including for example Windows and Linux. It originates from the Multics operating system (originally from 1969), which was the first operating system to feature a hierarchical file system. Multics was one of the main inspirations behind what eventually became Unix, and in the development process they places files according to a \"directory\" (current folder) and to \"directory's directory\" (parent folder). These terms were abbreviated 'd' and 'dd', and were eventually pronounced 'dot' and 'dot-dot' - making way for their current representation\n", "Q: What are the benefits of XNU using Mach features compared to a full FreeBSD kernel? The Darwin kernel is a hybrid of Mach and FreeBSD. What are the benefits of using such a hybrid architecture compared to a full FreeBSD kernel?\nI'm not looking for subjective opinions of why this architecture was chosen, but am rather interested in technological benefits of the architecture, both from a perspective of today and a perspective of the end of the 1990ies.\n\n*\n\n*Which improvements do the Mach features offer over their FreeBSD counterparts?\n\n*What features would be difficult to offer without Mach? Are there things possible with Mach with regards to performance or security that a FreeBSD-only kernel would not allow?\n\n\nA: I would argue that it is a bit too simplistic to say that the Darwin kernel is simply a hybrid of Mach and FreeBSD.\nTrying to look at without the historic implications of why the architecture was chosen doesn't really make sense either. If you were to design a new operating system today, you wouldn't end up with the same result, as the choices available are vastly different now.\nYou have to remember that Darwin did not just \"pop into existence\" by merging source codes of Mach and FreeBSD. That is not at all the case. Instead Darwin descend from Rhapsody, which also a heavily customized mix of components such as OSFMK (Mach), 4.4BSD and Yellow Box (which would eventually become Cocoa).\nIf you have to look at the \"objective benefits\", you would find that there's probably few to none when looking at the choice between the current \"hybrid-kernel\" and a hypothetical monolithic Darwin kernel.\nIf you want to compare it to the actual FreeBSD kernel as of today, there's a huge amount of advantages - mostly related to the fact that Darwin can run Apple's existing code base.\n", "Q: Which tools can I use to analyze memory dumps in macOS? I am trying to analyze memory dumps from specific processes on the MacOS. I am using commands:\nlldb --attach-pid 1041\nprocess save-core \"core\"\n\nAnd the size of the file core is 3.3GB. With the same application process on Windows I've go 150 MB and on linux 600 MB. Makes it hard to analyze it at that size.\nWhat are reliable tools for the analyzing mem-dumps on MacOS, regarding looking for the sensitive data?\n\nA: The reason for the memory dump being so big is that the application has mapped that much memory. It might not actually be \"using\" it, but it could mapped in the way of memory mapped files, or just \"blank\" (unused) space.\nIn terms of tools for analysing memory dumps, it depends entirely on what you're looking for and whether or not you know the internal data structures of the application you're analysing.\nIf this is a third party application, you do not have the source code for, and you're looking for sensitive data in the form of text - I would run the memory dump through the strings program:\nstrings core\n\nAn idea could be to save this intermediate result, and use that for later searching:\nstrings core > text\ngrep searchstring text\n\nIf you want to have a tool that actually understands the contents of the memory dump (for example to differentiate between different types of memory mappings), you can use Rekall.

As the linked answer describes, it has to do with the location of the partitioning tables.\nIf your source and destination drives have the same sector sizes, you can just copy using ordinary dd without any special parameters.\nIf they do not have the same sector size (as in the linked example with an old traditional hard drive and a newer flash-based drive), the partitioning table needs to moved.\nEssentially the computer will try to read the GPT partitioning table at the location of the second sector. For some drives that will be at byte 512 on the drive, for others it will be at byte 4096 on the drive.\nThe dd command you suggest with two different block sizes won’t here. It means that dd will read in data in blocks of 4096 bytes, and write them out in blocks of 512 bytes - thus performing 4 writes for each read. However that still places all the data as the exact same byte indices on the target drive as they had on the source drive.\nFor your purpose you need to move the data that was previously at index 4096 to be at index 512.\nRegarding your other questions:\nYes, encrypted partitions can be cloned with dd.\nFor this type of work you want to use rdisk instead of disk. The r means “raw” meaning that you’re bypassing the disk cache. You’ll end up with the same result, but it will go quicker that way.\n"]
