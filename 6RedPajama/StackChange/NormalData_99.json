["Q: How do I mount a drive so that it is readable by me? I'm working with over SSH with an external hard drive connected by USB.\nI know I can manually mount a drive with the following command:\n\nsudo mount /dev/sdc ~/dirToMountTo\n\nThe problem is, if I don't do it as root, then it says \"mount:only root can do that\".\nIf I do it as root, though, I can't access, read, or write files as a regular user. Only root has permissions to do anything in the directory.\nHow do I mount it so that I can work within it without being root?\n\nA: If you do this often, you may add a line to your /etc/fstab which will tell that the partition can be mounted by a non-root user. Something like this:\n/dev/fd0        /media/floppy0  auto    rw,user,noauto,exec,utf8 0       0\n\nhere, the 'user' option does what you need. See 'The non-superuser mounts' in mount's manfile.\nThe 'noauto' option tells the boot scripts not to attempt to mount the filesystem on boot (see the documentation for -a switch for mount command). Instead, you will be able to mount it explicitly by issuing\nmount /dev/fd0\n\nor\nmount /media/floppy0\n\nAlso, the user who mounted the filesystem should be able to unmount it too.\nFor a one-off mount you need to specify uid=value or gid=value to make all the files on the mounted filesystem to be owned by that user. See \"Mount options for fat\" in mount's manfile.\n\nA: It depends on the type of filesystem.\nFor FAT32 or NTFS you need to specify mount option to give your user read right.\nFor ext3 or ext4 you have to change permissions on the filesystem itself.\n", "Q: Conky, Show Desktop, Swap & Network Meters, Remove Background I used conky colors to generate my conky script \nConkyRC: http://pastebin.com/cfJ2Zj07\nOutput:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I remove the black background? \n\n*Notice the swap & network meteres does not appear to work?\n\n*Conky dissapears on using \"Show Desktop\"\n\n\nA: You will probably want to define the following properties as follows:\nown_window yes\nown_window_colour 000000    \nown_window_hints undecorated,below,sticky,skip_taskbar,skip_pager\nown_window_transparent yes\nown_window_type override\n\nIt will perfectly integrate with your desktop.

Our router is in a different room, and I don't have money for a wifi-card right now. So, until I get a card, I was hoping to use a shared connection from my laptop.  \nI've figured out how to share the connection from my laptop. Though the installer tries to set up the network, and it fails, even though it's connected via Ethernet to my laptop.  \nCan anyone offer some guidance on this issue?\n\nA: James, usually the shared network trick works flawlessly, so that might be a bug in the way it works. It usually sets up a special program called 'dnsmasq' on the shared ethernet device which should give your server a dynamic IP during the installation.\nYou may be able to work around this problem by simply giving your server a static IP address on the shared network. Open a terminal on the laptop and run\nip addr show\n\nYou should get a list with entries like this:\n3: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP qlen 1000\n    link/ether 00:23:6c:87:2c:2d brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n    inet 192.168.1.105/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global eth1\n    inet6 fe80::223:6cff:fe87:2c2d/64 scope link \n           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n\nFind the interface that is your shared ethernet connection, and note the network, so in my case above:\n192.168.1.105/24\n\nMy network is 192.168.1.0/24 and my address is 192.168.1.105\nPick an address (how about 192.168.1.2 in this case) in the same network, and assign it to your server. Give it your machine's address as the gateway and DNS server.\nThat should work to at least get the server able to transfer files from the internet. However, you still won't be able to use the server from any of your other computers because it will basically be firewalled behind your laptop. You can use \"DNAT\" rules to enable that, but that sounds a lot more complicated than just saving up for a wifi card. :)\n", "Q: how to run tomcat as service and not use root user I copy catalina.sh to /etc/init.d/tomcat and sudo chkconfig --add tomcat\nit started as root user,I want use another user,how?\n\nA: If you do want to create your own start up script for whatever reason. Then to run tomcat under another user use su -c \"$TOMCAT_HOME/bin/tomcat.sh start\" nobody when starting tomcat. (nobody is the user in this case that tomcat will start under)\nhttp://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=455567\n\nA: You should not copy catalina.sh to /etc/init.d/tomcat. Ubuntu provides (in its tomcat6 package) a /etc/init.d/tomcat6 startup script that will invoke catalina.sh as the correct user.\nAlso, using chkconfig on Ubuntu is not supported; it's a script for Red Hat-based systems. Don't use it.\n", "Q: What happened to Gobuntu? Some time ago there was available an official Ubuntu derivative named Gobuntu that was using free software only. I think I have not noticed when it was abandoned... Why is it no longer continued?\n\nA: From the Wikipedia:\nhttps://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Gobuntu\nBecause Ubuntu now incorporates a \"Free Software Only\" optional installer, the Gobuntu project was rendered redundant in early 2008.

F9 for kill, F7/F8 for renice..) seem to be captured in the OS rather than in htop.  How can I get those keystrokes handled by the process (i.e. htop)?  I am using the default gnome terminal in Ubuntu 11.04\n\n\nA: I don't think this is a bug. From the htop man page:\nF7, ], -\n\nIncrease selected process priority (subtract from 'nice' value). This can be done by the superuser only.\n\nAnd from renice man page (both htop and renice use the setpriority C\nfunction):\n\nUsers other than the super-user may only alter the priority of processes they own, and can only monotonically increase their ‘‘nice value’’ within the range 0 to PRIO_MAX (20).  (This prevents overriding administrative fiats.)\n\nIn fact if you try to run htop as root it should work as expected. Thanks to user Flavio Grossi for this answer it absolutely worked!!!\n\nA: In the gnome-terminal menus, go Edit -> Keyboard Shortcuts... and uncheck Enable the menu shortcut key (F10 by default).  F9 seems to work as usual, and F7/F8 do acually work but seem not to be able to set the nice value lower than zero, not sure why about that one.  \n\nA: One issue may be that F10 key opens one of the indicators.

I asked for the superuser pass and I was told the root password but even logging in as root doesn't allow me access to hwinfo. also when I try to run anything sudo related I get 'can't resolve host sudo'. can somebody please help me with this? is this normal?\n\nA: I think your problems with \"unable to resolve host blackbook\" are not directly related to your problems with starting hwinfo. The latter, I suspect, is caused simply by the fact that hwinfo in not installed by default. At least I checked a few of my machines and none of them have hwinfo installed. I have to admit that I don't have access to a recent \"vanilla\" Ubuntu box - all of mine were upgraded from older Ubuntu versions. To install the program open a terminal and type the following:\nsudo apt-get install hwinfo\n\n(actually, the error message should've told you to do so).

When I choose my country (Norway) I get two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Norway\n\n*Norway - Eliminate dead keys\n\n\nWhat is meant by \"Eliminate dead keys\"? What does that do? Which one should I choose?\n\nA: There are keys like the hat (^) or other French accents. These only take effect after pressing another regular key on your keyboard. One could say they simply modify the second key pressed. Those keys are called \"dead keys\" and are a special variety of the \"modifier keys\". They are dead in the sense that nothing happens when you press them by themselves. Until you press another key (or press them a second time), you will not see any change.\nExample for the French \"accent circonflexe\" (aka. hat or circumflex ^) on a regular layout with dead keys:\n^  -->  results in nothing\n^ & a -->  results in --> â\n^ & ^ --> results in --> ^\n^ & ^ & a --> results in --> ^a\n\"Eliminate dead keys\" causes those so called \"diacritic marks\" to appear on the first keypress (not modifying the character typed after that).\nSame example with \"Eliminate dead keys\" layout:\n^  -->  results in --> ^\n^ & a --> results in --> ^a\n^ & ^ --> results in --> ^^\n^ & ^ & a --> results in --> ^^a\nThe main purpose of dead keys is to enable you to type seldom used characters easily without taking up too much space on the keyboard.

But I don't know how to install it.\n\nA: If you want 5.5 you need to download the tar.gz version and not the rpm from here: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.5.html and follow the instructions from this link: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/binary-installation.html \nRelevant portions from this instruction (but do read the link itself too):\n2.2. Installing MySQL from Generic Binaries on Unix/Linux\nOracle provides a set of binary distributions of MySQL. These include binary distributions in the form of compressed tar files (files with a .tar.gz extension) for a number of platforms, as well as binaries in platform-specific package formats for selected platforms.\n<..>\nThis section covers the installation of MySQL from a compressed tar file binary distribution. For other platform-specific package formats, see the other platform-specific sections. \nTo install and use a MySQL binary distribution, the basic command sequence looks like this:\nshell> groupadd mysql\nshell> useradd -r -g mysql mysql\nshell> cd /usr/local\nshell> tar zxvf /path/to/mysql-VERSION-OS.tar.gz\nshell> ln -s full-path-to-mysql-VERSION-OS mysql\nshell> cd mysql\nshell> chown -R mysql .\nshell> chgrp -R mysql .\nshell> scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql\nshell> chown -R root .\nshell> chown -R mysql data\n# Next command is optional\nshell> cp support-files/my-medium.cnf /etc/my.cnf\nshell> bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql &\n# Next command is optional\nshell> cp support-files/mysql.server /etc/init.d/mysql.server\n\nA more detailed version of the preceding description for installing a binary distribution can be found at the link.\n\nA: You need to convert the .rpm to a .deb file for it to work with Ubuntu.

I want to copy some text from screen to my clipboard. I know how to get into copy and paste mode in screen, but I want that text to go to my clipboard so I can paste it on the browser, for example.\nHow do I do this? Thanks!\n\nA: In most programs, you would select text and press Ctrl + C to copy it. Pasting text would be done by pressing Ctrl + V. In the terminal emulator program, Ctrl + C has a special meaning, it interrupts (stops) programs by default.\nYour terminal emulator program may have other shortcuts defined. For example, Konsole and Gnome Terminal uses Ctrl + Shift + C for copying the selected text. Alternatively, select text and copy it by using the Copy option in the Edit menu or the context menu.\nIf the output of your program is large, you might want to enable the scrollback buffer of screen. That can be done by adding the below line to the ~/.screenrc file:\ntermcapinfo xterm ti@:te@\n\n\nA: For a raw and dirty implementation, install the package xsel, that allow command line interaction with then X clipboard, then put these lines in your ~/.screenrc\nbind > eval writebuf \"exec sh -c 'xsel -nbi </tmp/screen-exchange'\"\nbind y eval \"exec sh -c 'xsel -bo >/tmp/screen-exchange'\"\n\nthen restart screen.\nNow, when you select something in screen copy/scrollback mode, and write paste buffer to a file with C-a >, you can move to the browser and paste the content of the clipboard as usual (for example with Ctrl-V).\nFor the reverse, copy something in your browser with Ctrl-C, then go to screen and read the clipboard with the new command C-a y, then read the screen-exchange file into the paste buffer with C-a <, finally paste wherever you want with C-a ].\nFor this to work the variable DISPLAY must be correctly set, and you must have access to the X server. This is not a problem when you are on a terminal running on the same X server, but if you run screen in a virtual terminal, e.g. tty1, then you may need to run xhost + on the X side, and export DISPLAY=:0 or similar on the terminal, before starting screen.\nAs you see, it is not simple, and not bullet proof, but I hope it can help.\nThis answer is partly inspired from synchronizing GNU screen’s paste buffer and the X selection\n\nA: Just use copy operation in your terminal application. \nIf you are using gnome-terminal for example, just select test and use context menu -> copy. \n", "Q: Mac Os keyboard layout in Ubuntu After working for some time in Mac OS I realised that I quite like the position of Command key and various system-wide combinations it is used in, such as Command-W for closing document windows or Command-Q for quitting apps.\nForm usability/ergonomics standpoint it is way more convenient for me personally to use Alt or Command key and not having to reach for Command key.\nSince a lot of programs in Ubuntu do already support similar combinations, namely Ctrl-W/Ctrl-Q, I wanted to re-map those to be like their Mac Os counterparts.\nSo, I would like to do the following remap:\nCtrl-W -> Alt-W\nCtrl-Q -> Alt-Q\nCtrl-C -> Alt-C\nCtrl-V -> Alt-V\n\netc\nCan that be done via, say xmodmap, or any other means?\n\nA: You can switch the alt and super keys using the keyboard configuration panel.

Title says 9.04 while the message says 9.10\nAnyway, both are not supported anymore (please see this page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases), so you should upgrade to a more recent release to have a newer R and you could also follow these instructions: http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/\n", "Q: dependency cycle lucid -- oneiric I am trying to install php5.3.6 on Lucid Lynx using oneiric repository to have everything in place on the ubuntu way and avoid manual package compiling.\nI got the following error:\nCouldn't configure multiarch-support for libdb5.1, probably a dependency cycle.\nThe problem is libdb5.1 is depending on multiarch-support but multiarch support wants to install libdb5.1.\ncommand used: sudo apt-get -t oneiric install php5 php5-common libapache2-mod-php5\nWhen i try to install multiarch-support same way it says the same thing.\nHow should i solve this?\nThe reaason for this is to change between versions of softwares on a clearer way without building custom deb packages from source.\n\nUpdate 1\nYes, I am aware of this but i am just trying different scenarios because some of our development sites needed php5.2.x before that I installed from karmic repository on ubuntu lucid lynx and worked perfectly.\nSo  I just wanted to test what if I want the most fresh version from oneiric repository.\nI hoped there is something than compiling it manually from source that I also tested and worked perfectly.\n\nA: First I would not advise you to use a repository which is not meant for that series (maverick, lucid, oneiric etc).

(to save yourself having to enter your password twice in a row, once for the screensaver, once for the keyring)\nThis approach would have the benefit that Alice could enjoy automatic startup without sacrificing too much security (i.e. no unlocked autologin), and save her from entering her password multiple times (by combining screen and keyring unlock - an OK approach security-wise I think).\nIt would effectively, from a user perspective, behave like a conventional startup&login process, only that your system is fully ready once you enter the password (under the conditions of one-user systems and unattended boot up - not untypical for laptop users I maintain).\nInformation found so far:\nad 1): I found this brainstorm, but on adding his code to .profile, my screensaver unlock prompt just endlessly blinks on and off, so this is probably an obsolete process. Any other options or corrections to the linked one?\n[edit]: OK, this part worked by adding gnome-screensaver-command -al to the startup applications. Sadly, on unlock the keyring unlock dialog greets me, so #2 is still outstanding.\nad 2): I couldn't find any hints as to if this is possible.\n[edit2]: It seems there is currently no way to do this, except by disabling the keyring password. \n\nA: With unsecure keyring\nYou could add gnome-screensaver-command -a at Startup Applications:\n1) Alt + F2 then paste gnome-session-properties and click Enter \n2) Click \"Add\" and paste the command above.  \n\nRegards.\nWith secure keyring\n(If you don't want to empty your keyring password) \nAfter the steps above, you make a script that will run at startup and will check if the screen are locked or not.

I have tried Gnome DO which is very similar to Launchy and it's good but there I still miss Executor.\nThe major difference between Launchy and Executor is the the emphasis on user defined keywords, which allow users to set keywords for launching any given application.In other words you can create your own commands/keystrokes.\nI also don't like Gnome DO indexing all my programs,as I don't use all of them,instead I like to make my keywords/progs/folders paths.\n\nA: Why no love for Synapse?\nJust like GNOME Do and similar launchers Synapse is ‘called’ using the keyboard combination Ctrl + Space. If you have a different shortcut hardwired into your actual synapses you can change it to any combination you like via the settings menu.\nFeatures:\nThe default set of plugins shipped with Synapse are as follows: -\n\n\n*\n\n*Applications – searches your desktop files Banshee – allows you to\nplay/enqueue music files in Banshee Commands – runs any command (ie.\n“sudo apt-get update”) Devhelp – search documentation using Devhelp\nDictionary – find definitions of words Directory search – allows\nopening of commonly used directories Gnome session – log out, shut\ndown, restart Hybrid search – complete Zeitgeist results by searching\nfor similar files Rhytmbox – play/enqueue music files in Rhythmbox\nUPower – suspend & hibernate your computer Zeitgeist – search\nanything logged by Zeitgeist But thanks to the Zeitgeist integration\npretty much any application can integrate with Synapse simply by\nintegrating with Zeitgeist.\n\n\n\nInstall:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:synapse-core/ppa\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install synapse\n\n\nA: Try Kupfer\nWhat you can do with Kupfer?\n\n\n*\n\n*Grab current selection\n\n*Add applications\n\n*Add your scripts\n\n*Add your commandlines\n\n*Command-line connection\n\n*Managing Context and Current Selection\n\n*The \"Comma Trick\"\n\n*Save Commands as Files (GIF screencast illustration)\n\n\nKupfer Manual\n\nA: I used to use AutoHotKey a lot in Windows to automate things a bit. \nThe Linux equivalent is AutoKey the main difference between the projects\nis Autokey uses Python for scripting instead of its own language.\nHere is a list of Features from the project home page\n\n\n*\n\n*KDE and GTK versions available, making AutoKey integrate well into\nany desktop environment.\n\n*Write Python scripts to automate virtually any task that can be\naccomplished via the keyboard\n\n*Built-in code editor (using QScintilla in KDE or GtkSourceView2 in\nGTK)\n\n*Create phrases (blocks of text) to be pasted into any program on\ndemand (uses the X selection)\n\n*Create collections of phrases/scripts in folders, and assign a hotkey\nor abbreviation to the folder to display a popup menu\n\n*Regular expressions can be used to filter windows by their title, to\nexclude hotkeys/abbreviations from triggering in certain applications\n\n*Scripts, phrases and folders can be attached to the tray icon menu,\nallowing you to select them without assigning a hotkey or\nabbreviation\n\n*AutoKey can track your usage patterns and present the most frequently\nused items at the top of the popup menu\n\n\nHope this is What you are looking for\n\nA: You can write shell scripts as user defined keywords for Gnome Do.\nAlso, I really like KDE's Krunner dialogue.

I love Synaptic's ability to search the repo for both installed and uninstalled packages, but I would like to use this same ability through the apt command line utility, so I can search for packages from a shell.\nIs there a way to do this?\nThanks for any replies!\n\nA: Yeah use aptitude!\nIf you want to search for something out of the installed packages try:\naptitude search '~i <other search terms>'\n\nAnd you can negate the ~i so this would search packages that are not installed:\naptitude search '!~i <other search terms>'\n\naptitude can do a stupid amount of stuff and it's sad to see it being removed from future versions of Ubuntu (by default - you can still install it).\nYou can read more about aptitude's search terms here.\n\nA: You could search for packages with apt-cache, searching for a pattern is like\napt-cache search <pattern>\n\nIf you only want to search in package names\napt-cache --names-only search <pattern>\n\nPattern are regular expressions, but be aware to protect them from shell expansion. If you use more than one pattern, they are and'ed together.\nThe output is the short description, if you want a long one, use the --full option.\nAlso, aptitude can do more specific searches, for example something like\naptitude search '?installed?not(?automatic)?priority(\"optional\")?name(\"^s\")'\n\nbut aptitude is not installed by default.\n", "Q: Shutdown is always a surprise?

If you are still booting in a bios based machine and not an EFI one, you need to create a 1MB bios_grub partition when installing ( assuming you are going to boot from this drive ).  The partition is required to install the bios based grub on a GPT partitioned disk.\n", "Q: How can I see a wireless network's frequency and/or channel?

Here is some Ubuntu (with GNOME - no KDE) based workstations in our library. Using the computers is free now, before it was only /hour, what is not a high cost. I'm looking for a software, which can help me to manage the computers. How I mean:\n\n\n*\n\n*Notice the user after X minutes, to give her/his place for another user (if there are someone) = A text notice after X minutes (it would be better, if it gives a small signal too with the hardware speaker).\n\n*Auto (& remote) shutdown of the workstations, (also disable them). [Auto power on is not required, because the users can push that power button, if they want to use the machines :D]\n\n*Statistics and other infos about workstations, also their health status (I know munin, but included feature would be better). Eg: temps, SMART datas, login time, remaining time...\n\n*(Updating all systems at once...)\n\n*Free\n\n\nMaybe, cafe softwares won't meet my requirements, I don't know how can I call that software for that situation. I can also appreciate multi software solution.\nI read this page, but these softwares are focused on paying.\n\nA: For billing/timing, you might want to look at Cafepilot. It is free an open source software. It's currently aimed at people paying for their usage but you could give people tickets to use it (CP would think they're worth money but you'd just give them out for free).\nFor monitoring, remote-controlling and updating, check out Canonical's Landscape tool. It's currently quite expensive but might justify itself... You're always free to haggle with Canonical because your situation is somewhat different from the standard enterprise \"seat\" concept.\nOtherwise you can loop together tools like Munin or Cacti with Puppet. Puppet is free and is in the repositories but you probably want to look at the documentation on their main site. Note there is also a paid-for \"Enterprise\" version of Puppet that has a slightly augmented feature set.\n", "Q: Replace audio stream from one file with audio stream from another I have got two video files: .mp4, with a single (incorrect) audiostream, and an .mkv, with two audio streams (one incorrect, the other correct)\nIs there a way to replace the audio of the .mp4 file with the second stream in the .mkv?\nThanks\n\nA: You'd need to extract the audio from the MKV first and then combine remux the MP4 with the new track. Something like this should work:\nffmpeg -i vid.mkv -acodec copy -vn audio.ext\nffmpeg -i vid.mp4 -i audio.ext -vcodec copy -acodec copy -map 0:1 -map 1:0 final.mp4\n\n\nA: Sure, with avconv (same as ffmpeg)\nTry:\navconv -i INPUT_FILE_WITH_BROKEN_SOUND.mp4 -i SECOND_INPUT_FILE.mkv -c copy -map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:1 OUTPUT.mp4\n\n-c copy copies tracks instead of re-encoding them\n-map 0:v:0 selects track to be copied to output: 1st file -> video tracks -> 1st video track\n-map 1:a:1 selects track to be copied to output: 2nd file -> audio tracks -> 2nd audio track\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: Slot Machine Games for Ubuntu?

This happens in both Unity and GNOME Classic.\nThere are lot's of examples of this, but usually only some of the UI elements are unresponsive (e.g., I can't move a window, but I can click a menu somewhere else). The system is not lagging, the UI simply doesn't work. Sometimes I can get it to work by doing something unrelated (e.g., closing one window with Alt-F4 might allow me to move another frozen window).\nThis begins to happen immediately after I login. The behavior is repeatable, but there are so many UI elements that turn on and off that it can get very unpredictable.\nI can usually press super to get the dash and Alt-F2 to get a command prompt. Also Alt-Shift-T seems to usually work to bring up a working Terminal (at least one that accepts commands, even if I can't move the window).\nDoes anyone have any ideas on what might be causing this? The behavior is highly unpredictable and extremely frustrating. I should note that key commands don't always work, even though they seem to in my examples. So I don't think it's just a mouse issue.\nThanks for any help.\n\n\n*\n\n*Distro 11.04. Update Manager has no available updates for my system, so I assume I'm up to date.\n\n*Someone on launchpad suggested checking other accounts. In fact, making a new user and logging into that account, fixes the problem there and on my original account. Deleting the user makes the problem come back.\n\n*There's no change when I add the edd=on parameter on boot.\nAlso, I have to login to the new user before the problem stops on my usual user. This works as a temporary solution, although I'd really prefer to know what's going on (now I'm really confused). Also, I don't particularly want a second account if it's unnecessary.\nDoes anyone know what's causing the problem and making it come back when I delete the second account?\nSystem info:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU: Intel Core i7 950\n\n*RAM: 8GB\n\n*GPU: nVidia GTX460 SE\n\n*Motherboard: Asus Sabertooth X58\n\n*Free Disk Space: 650 GB (64%) (two 2GB drives which are in a RAID 1 array)\n\n\nSome other things I've tried are:\n\n\n*\n\n*unity --reset\n\n*gconftool-2 --recursive-unset /apps/compiz-1\n\n*rm -rf .compiz .gnome .gnome2 .gnome2_private .gconf .gconfd .metacity\nAlso, I've discovered that having another user account is not enough. If I restart or even suspend my system, I need to login to the other account first before my own.\nAlso also, the unity --reset command segfaults when I run it through a tty. The line in the syslog concerning it is\nAug 14 11:26:43 Ubuntu-Desktop kernel: [ 217.921661] compiz[2539]: segfault at 58 ip 00007f674f345c51 sp 00007fffdfc43508 error 4 in libnvidia-glcore.so.270.41.06[7f674e3b3000+144e000]\nI don't know if that will be helpful or not, but I thought it was weird.\nI seem to have the same problem as poster #9 here. That is, I have the nvidia advanced graphics drivers installed, but the additional drivers pane says they aren't in use. I'm confused by this though, since the driver description says they're needed to run Unity. So either the description is wrong, or they are indeed in use. I still don't know if this is related to my current issue, particularly because I didn't change the drivers at all, and the same configuration exists on the new user account where things are fine.\nEdit: I deleted a compiz-1 folder from ~/.config/ to no avail. There was no compiz folder there.\nI don't think the nvidia issue is related. I've updated my graphics drivers to version 280.13, which is the latest from nvidia. On fossfreedom's suggestion I uninstalled those and installed the 173 drivers despite not supporting my graphics card. Predictably, I got no graphics and used single user mode to update my graphics again.\nMore pressingly, I've discovered that the secondary user doesn't solve the problem as I previously thought. The first user to log in (no matter which user it is) has the issue. The second user to log in fixes the problem for both users. Previously I had always logged into my own account and then logged into another, so I never noticed this.\nThis new development means that I can't carry out my previous plan of switching to a new user account. At this point, I'm pretty close to reinstalling. I have another harddrive in the mail that will be large enough to back up all my data completely.\nBut please, if anyone has any more ideas, tell me. I don't really want to reinstall if I don't need to do so.\n\nA: I would consider doing a memtest and maybe a badblocks scan on your drive.  The processor and memory are what draw your desktop or GUI items.  Therefore I'd rule those out before we start pionting fingers at your desktop managers.  Since both Gnome and Unity are acting up I find hardware a much more likely factor.\nSorry for posting an answer, but I do not have the ability to post comments yet.\nAnyway, there is a memtest86+ test on any Ubuntu install cd or usb drive.  I'd go with that first.\nEdit:\nSeems like migrating to a new user account would be the best test as of right now.  Something could just be corrupt from install and reverting when you delete the new user, I don't really know.  But you can try this:\nusermod -m -d /home/jerry -l jerry tom\n### gone ###\nls /home/tom\n### as it moved to ###\nls /home/jerry\n\nThis command gets rid of the user \"tom\" and moves everything to the user \"jerry\".  The ls commands are just to double check your work, listing the new available directory, and the first one should give you an error as it no longer exists.\nsource: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ubuntu-linux-howto-rename-user-account/\nHopefully if you move everything from your current account to a new one, you can have just one account without all the problems.\n\nA: You could also have tried to use unity --reset.\nYou can probably still try it if that works.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I reset my Unity configuration?\n\nA: From your latest update I think there is a fundamental incompatibility with the 270 drivers and your graphics card.\nThis bug report - post #9 reports this issue with the 270 drivers and your graphics card.\nCan I suggest you deactivate the 270 drivers and activate - specifically - the 173 driver.  \n\nA: Have you tried delete/rename/move ~/.config/compiz\nrm ~/.config/compiz\n\n\nA: It's probably a bug in compiz. It used to happen to me a lot, but recently it has happened very few times.\nI can always unfreeze the UI by moving to another Space (shortcut Control+Alt+*Arrow by default). You could try that and see if it works for you, but it's a workaround and there's definitely a bug somewhere, be it in compiz or in nvidia's driver.\n\nA: I eventually just did a complete reinstall. I only copied my data, no settings or anything else. I didn't want the problem to follow me to a new install. This fixed the issue.\n\nA: ubuntu 12.10 and 12.04: i had a very similar situation, where keyboard input suddenly stopped being recognized AND windows could not be moved, but CTRL+ALT+DEL worked and i could click on some links.\ni found out that my problem was with SOUND SHORTCUTS (starting with BACKSPACE).  i disabled every one of them (settings > keyboard > shortcuts >sound) and haven't had that problem any more.\n", "Q: Bad install of bisigi themes E: Type' ://ppa.launchpad.net/bisigi/ppa/ubuntu' is not known on line 2 in source list/etc/apt/sources.list.d/bisigi-ppa-maverick.list \nE:Unable to lock the list directory\n\nThis is blocking me from entering the Synaptic Package Manager!

We have a HP Photosmart B210 series printer.\nThe driver installed automatically without hassle (10.04 LTS Lucid Lynx) when I plugged the printer in and printing to A4 works like a charm.\nHowever, this printer has a separate tray for photo paper (up to 13 x 18 cm) and while it is possible to choose Photo Tray as the paper source from the printer dialog, it displays A4 for the paper type and this cannot be changed. (Printing from the Gnome image viewer.)\nSince this Laptop is primarily used by my parents, a one-click solution where they just have to select \"print to photo\" and have all tray/paper/border/quality settings automatically chosen would be ideal.\n\nI've already updated to the 3.11 drivers from the PPA, but it's not really helping.\nFor example: I can select Photo-Tray+Best-Quality from the Gnome picture viewer, but in the printer dialog of the picture viewer, I cannot change the paper size from A4, so as soon as I try to print, I get an error telling me that the paper size doesn't match. (obviously, as the Photo Tray only supports up to 13x18cm)\nThen I installed the GNOME photo printer, but this utility, while being able to print to the photo tray, doesn't allow me to select output quality and will print with the default A4 paper quality to photo paper ::-)  \n\nIdeas?\n\nA: The version of the lucid hplip package which is used to provide your printer capabilities is quite old (3.10.2).

Wanted to try out Ubuntu Server, and I've been stopped by a stupid issue.\nDuring the install I choose English language (since that's what I want). Then I choose Norway as my country, since that's where I live. On the next screen however, it asks me for locale and it only gives me en_* options?\nNot being able to select anything better I have to go with en_US. I'm also not able to select a Norwegian keyboard layout during the install, which of course is annoying. Working in the terminal with the wrong keyboard layout is basically impossible (Unless you have that other layout in your fingers... which I don't...).\nSo, what do I do? How can I fix this? I want to try out Ubuntu Server with english language, but with Norwegian locale and keyboard layout. In regular Ubuntu this was not a problem at all.\n\nUpdate: Temporary \"solution\" I found was to reinstall and remember to select both language and keyboard layout in the initial menu you get when booting from the installation media. You can select layout by using one of the F keys, and seems like it remembers this choice through the installation. At least the keys seem to do the right thing now :p\n\nA: In case someone else have this problem - try this command in the terminal:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration\n\n\nA: You can change the console keyboard setup by running the following command:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup\n\nThe above command lets you specify quite a few options in addition to your keyboard layout, but you should be able to follow the instructions fairly easily.\n", "Q: How do I remove OpenJDK?

However I am a bit unhappy about the notification panel being invisible. I understand the general concept of notifications being shown for a short amount of time and then you can find them again in the unobstrusive notification tray. However this neglects the use case that I did not notice the on-screen notification (e.g. talking on the phone, or having left the computer for a second or two).\nSo if I miss a notification I will have to check the tray to see it. Basically this means that I am checking the tray all the time for missing notifications which is really counter-productive. \nIs there some way to get the notification tray to stay visible? Or to have it in the top-panel? Or any other means to see \"notifications pending\"?\n\nA: At the present moment, there is a temporary solution which comes in the form of a gnome-shell-extension. You can read more about the extension here. However, this issue of missing notification is something that is being worked on for the upcoming gnome 3.2 update which will be released in September 28th 2011.\n", "Q: Where is the cron / crontab log? I want to verify that my cron job is executing and at what time.  I believe there is a log for my sudo crontab -e jobs, but where?    \nI searched google and found recommendations to look in /var/log (in which I do not see anything with 'cron' in the name) and to edit the file /etc/syslog.conf which I also do not have.\n\nA: You can also direct the output of the individual cronjobs to their own logs for better readability, you will just need to append the output of date somewhere.\n 0 15 * * *    /home/andrew/daily-backup.sh >> /var/log/daily-backup.log 2>&1\n\n\nA: this shows CRON runtime i used Centos 7\ncat /var/log/cron\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu 20.04, /var/mail/{user} had the cron messages i was looking for.\nI couldn't find decent cron logs in /var/log/messages.\n\nA: If you have systemd installed on your system, you could display cron job log by using the journalctl command.\nFor example, on my Ubuntu 17.10:\njournalctl -u cron.service\n\n\nA: Check all CRON related logs in syslog files included compressed log files as well like this way:\nzless /var/log/syslog* | grep CRON\n\n\nA: You can create a cron.log file to contain just the CRON entries that show up in syslog. Note that CRON jobs will still show up in syslog if you follow the following directions.   \nOpen the file \n/etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf\n\nFind the line that starts with: \n#cron.*\n\nuncomment that line, save the file, and restart rsyslog: \nsudo service rsyslog restart\n\nYou should now see a cron log file here:  \n/var/log/cron.log\n\nCron activity will now be logged to this file (in addition to syslog).    \nNote that in cron.log you will see entries for when cron ran scripts in /etc/cron.hourly, cron.daily, etc. - e.g. something like: \nApr 12 14:17:01 cd CRON[14368]: (root) CMD (   cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly)\n\nHowever, you will not see more information about what scripts were actually ran inside /etc/cron.daily or /etc/cron.hourly, unless those scripts direct output to the cron.log (or perhaps to some other log file).  \nIf you want to verify if a crontab is running and not have to search for it in cron.log or syslog, create a crontab that redirects output to a log file of your choice - something like: \n01 14 * * * /home/joe/myscript >> /home/log/myscript.log 2>&1\n\nThis will redirect all standard output and errors that may be produced by the script that is run to the log file specified.    \n\nA: journalctl -t CROND\n\non ubuntu >=18 it maybe\njournalctl -t CRON\n\nFrom the journalctl manual:\n   -t, --identifier=SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER|PATTERN\n       Show messages for the specified syslog identifier SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER, \n       or for any of the messages with a \"SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER\" matched by PATTERN.\n\n       This parameter can be specified multiple times.\n\n\nA: This is a very old question, but none of these answers seem satisfactory.\nFirst make your cron job run every minute, then run cron as non-daemon (temporarily, just kill any crond that may have already started) with test logging:\ncrond -nx test\nAnd see the log of your program execution flowing through your terminal.\n\nA: On a default installation the cron jobs get logged to \n/var/log/syslog\n\nYou can see just cron jobs in that logfile by running\n grep CRON /var/log/syslog\n\nIf you haven't reconfigured anything,the entries will be in there.\n\nA: You could redirect the output of cron to a temporary file.\nSuch as:\n00 11 07 * * /bin/bash /home/ubuntu/command.sh > /tmp/output 2>&1\n\nError and normal output, both will be redirected to the same file\n\nA: Sometimes it can be useful to continuously monitor it, in that case:\ntail -f /var/log/syslog | grep CRON\n\n\nA: It is in /var/log/syslog by default.  \nBut it can be set up to create a separate cron.log, which is more useful.\nThis Q&A describes the process:\n16.04: How do I make cron create cron.log and monitor it in real time?\nAlso in this answer is the instructions to create a wcron command that displays it is near-real-time.  Plus, it links to another answer,\nHow to change cron log level?\nthat shows how to change the log level to include more than just the start of jobs - level 15 will show errors and end time, also.\n\nA: Like mentioned earlier, cron jobs get logged to /var/log/syslog\nYou can pipe the syslog to grep and filter out the CRON logs, like this\nless /var/log/syslog | grep CRON \n\nYou can search through your crontab logs, like this\nless /var/log/syslog | grep CRON | grep <search-keyword-comes-here>\n\nYou can search through your crontab history logs stored in gz files, like this\nless /var/log/syslog.2.gz | grep CRON | grep <search-keyword-comes-here>\n\nIts always considered good to have a logging mechanism, you can quickly setup ELK for your servers, you can also experiment with logz .\n\nA: It may be different depending on the system type and edition. But in many cases, you have to figure out the time basis that the target crontab rule runs on. So for example, if you're searching for the related log for a daily crontab rule, then you'll find the log divided into different files, one per day, in:\n$ ls -ltrh /var/log/cron-*\n\nAnd you'll get the logfiles.\n\nA: I found the current cron logs in /var/log/cron\nand previous logs on /var/log/cron-date.\n", "Q: Environment font size is too small So I've chosen a font by \nSystem Settings -> Application Appearance -> Fonts \nAnd there I've adjusted all fonts to be of 14th size.

What is the recommended way to use chroot from Ubuntu Stable (in my case 11.04) with Ubuntu+1 (11.10)?\nLinked (but probably separate) is \"Is there anything special that I need to do in order to get Xorg working?\" \nReason I ask is because I'd like to test a few GTK3 programs without losing my current (stable) Ubuntu, or having to get my data synced. \nI thought about maybe running a SSH server from 11.10 and then using SSH's X forwarding, but that seems rather cumbersome.\n\nA: In order to chroot to do things like.. configure/install grub, do the following-\n#first, mount new install to /mnt/oneiric\nmount -t proc proc /mnt/oneiric/proc\nmount -t sysfs sys /mnt/oneiric/sys\nmount -o bind /dev /mnt/oneiric/dev\n\nchroot /mnt/oneiric /bin/bash\n\nI wouldn't try to start full gnome this way. The only reason you should really be doing this is if you can't boot into the linux installation for some reason, but still need to run a few things from it.

Our local network server is running Windows Server 2008 and most of clients are XP machines. (except me that am an Ubuntu guy :) Currently I installed samba-client and can share my files on the network.\nIs it possible to configure an Ubuntu Server as a Windows network server? If possible I would like to replace our Windows Server with Ubuntu. It should be able to manage directory access and workgroups as like as windows server.\n\nA: You can install Samba, a system that can share directories, printers and CDROM/DVDROM. Samba can even replace Active Directory, so your other computer users can authenticate on it. You can setup Samba so you have a public, freely available directory, have user-based home directories and shared directories, where the rights are based on their Linux credentials. \nThe main configuration file is smb.conf, which is usually located under /etc/samba, at least under Ubuntu. You can also use something like Webmin to manage your Samba configurations and shares from a web-based interface, instead of manually editing configuration files. \nIf you search on the net, you will find tons of free documentation on SAMBA. \nYou mainly have to install samba itself. enter the command: \nsudo apt-get install samba-server\n\n", "Q: Change AltGr to Ctrl I'm starting to use Emacs, and as any (Emacs) user should know, you constantly use Ctrl.

In the afternoon, I tried to boot into Ubuntu Lucid Lynx once again and I see no display.

Which means that everything is working fine except that it does not display anything on my screen.\nWhat can be a solution to this?\nUPDATE: It Fixed itself, somehow. I still dont have a clue what the problem was so I will provide the details: \nWhen I see the GNU grub menu, I see the following options\nUbuntu, with Linux 2.6.38.10 - generic\nUbuntu, with Linux 2.6.38.10 - generic (recovery mode)\nUbuntu, with Linux 2.6.33.10 - generic\nUbuntu, with Linux 2.6.33.10 - generic(recovery mode)\n\nI normally use the first option to login, but I would just see a message (I remember it had something like RAM not loaded, or detected) and then it will go into blank screen.\nI tried logging with the second option (recovery mode) as it looked like what I needed, and it had the oldschool dos-style blue menu, where I checked the option 'load ubuntu normally' and I was taken to a CLI.\nI tried pwd, and it was showing my home directory. I navigated to one of my directories and compiled and executed a C++ program and it seemed everything was working fine. So I manually restarted and checked the first booting option, and everything is fine. \nWhat could be a possible diagnosis of the problem I faced so that I dont face it again?\n\nA: Without knowing what the exact error message was it will be difficult to diagnose. The basic sequence of events is :\n\n\n*\n\n*You failed to boot into ubuntu\n\n*You tried recovery mode\n\n*Recovery mode runs some extra checks on the system and repairs stuff when it can\n\n*Whatver problem was fixed by the recovery mode basic tools\n\n*You rebooted and it started normally\n\n\nThis could have been caused by anything from a bad shutdown to some intermittent hardware fault, so its hard to tell exactly what caused it to begin with.\nRecovery mode does not automatically start X (the graphic display system) which is why you were dropped into a shell (This is done so you can repair a broken Xconfig from recovery mode). You can start X manually by typing startx as a command next time if you don't want to reboot. If you are running vanilla ubuntu that should start X and run your default display manager (Unity or Gnome). \n\nA: The Ubuntu Wiki related to Troubleshooting BlankScreen provides useful information about why this problem occurs and how to fix it, which in my case solved my problem that was giving blank screen at the boot and I couldn't even see the Login Screen.\nRelated to what you refer about your issue, there is a part that reads just under \"Non Symptoms\":\n\nIf it occurs after entering your password on the login page, you\n  have some different class of issue, such as an issue with 3D / DRM.\n  Try disabling compiz (sudo chmod a-x /usr/bin/compiz), logging in as a\n  different user, or turning off DRI.\n\nHowever, I suggest you take a look at that document and check what of these can give you a clue on where to start for you to fix it.\nGood luck! \n", "Q: Netbook wifi switch not working on a Toshiba NB255-N245 I recently bought a Toshiba NB255-N245 and installed 11.04 with Wubi.

The only package explicitly for  Maverick is Pinta.\nYou could edit your /etc/apt/sources.list (it might have a separate file of its own in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/) so the relevant line goes from something like this: \n deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/directhex/unstable/ubuntu maverick main\n\nTo this:\n deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/directhex/unstable/ubuntu natty main\n\nThis won't always work and might even break things but it's only Mono (I don't think anything critical to booting relies on it) so you could just use ppa-purge to drop the PPA and go back to stock packages.\n", "Q: Ubuntu calendar easteregg/spam?

I'm trying to add lines to my /etc/fstab file.\nbut the lines I add get cleared on reboot because I am using a persistent live USB stick.\nI don't want a lecture. I just want to know which file writes the /etc/fstab file at restart and I want to alter that file so that I can auto mount the disk I want.\nSo this is not really a question but more like a request.\nI am requesting the location of the file/files that are responsible for writing to or resetting /etc/fstab on restart.\n\nA: For my LiveUSB install with Ubuntu 11.10 (which has a casper-rw persistence loopback file), the file that worked for me to have drives mounted automatically is:\n/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/casper-bottom/12fstab\n\nI added lines into that script which worked to add new drive mounts upon boot-up.  The odd thing is that my /etc/fstab file does NOT reflect the drive mounts.  This would seem to suggest that the /etc/fstab file is just a dummy file or something to the LiveCD setups.  Not sure, but changes added to the 12fstab file DO persist.\n\nA: \nAdd your mount commands in /etc/rc.local\n...\nmount -t ntfs-3g -L Inter /media/Inter -o uid=1000,gid=999,umask=002\nexit\n\n\nA: Rather than use a live media with persistence, I always simply install directly to the flash drive. This way any changes I make are kept. Whether the changes are to the data stored there or the system configuration or applications I have installed is irrelevant with this approach.

Is this accurate?\n\nA: Yes - I've done it. It's not totally straightforward though. For instance if you had a custom graphics driver on one machine, but not the new machine, you'll have display problems. And the second thing is that the grub bootloader remembers the partition and uuid of the current machine and these will have to be modified.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you haven't got custom drivers installed (or remove them if you have)\n\n*Make sure you installed the same Ubuntu release on the new machine\n\n*Load the install on the new machine, when you see the grub menu press 'e' on the first entry and note xxx and yyy:\nset root=(xxx) e.g. (hd0,msdos2)\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz.... root=yyy e.g. /dev/sda2 or UUID=nnnnnnn\n\n*Copy the root.disk over to the new machine\n\n*Boot into Ubuntu but only as far as the grub menu\nPress 'e' on it's first entry and change the values you see with the xxx and yyy from your new install. Also delete the line starting search --no-floppy .... Then press Ctrl X to boot.\n\n*After it boots, drop to a terminal (Ctrl Alt T) and run sudo update-grub to fix the grub menu.\nThat's all there is to it.\nPS if you're familiar with partitions, you don't need to 'complete' the reboot and 2nd phase of the install on the new machine. Just finish the windows part of the install, and copy the root.disk and swap.disk into the \\ubuntu\\disks folder, and then reboot, modifying the partition values. But if you're not sure what these are, just complete the install (make it 5GB in size since you'll be trashing it). In that case you can ignore the swap.disk.\nEDIT: another neat thing you can do with a root.disk file... migrate it to a normal Ubuntu install on the same or another machine (same caveats on custom drivers applies). \n\nA: No. That would not setup your Windows boot, for instance. So you'd either have to do that manually, or perhaps you could install it and then replace the root.disk file. I haven't tested that, so be sure to have a backup. \n\nA: Late answer on this for you, but it may help the next person.\nI haven't tested it since I don't have a Windows installation, but I believe that you only need the c:\\boot.ini c:\\wubildr(.mbr) and c:\\ubuntu\\ to the new machine. On bootup, change the old UUID to the correct disk. If both machines will be on the same network, you may want to edit /etc/hostname after you boot the first time.\n\nA: Yes,if the machines have the same specs you dont need to do anything more than just installing Ms windows OS and wubi, then replace disks folder with a saved copy.\n", "Q: TTC fonts support Can Ubuntu(or linux) properly support .ttc font format? \nI have copied from my Windows 7 partition to Ubuntu 10.04 some fonts, including entire Cambria family, but it seems like default Cambria version with .ttc extension cannot be displayed in linux.

I'm considering purchasing a device which enables me to stream my music wirelessly using the network. I would like to stream using the network and not by Bluetooth. I found some bluetooth devices, but my laptop does not have bluetooth and I'm not fond of having a bluetooth dongle permanently.\nSo, is there a low-cost alternative network enabled audio streaming adapter that allows airplay to stereo streaming?\nThanks!\n\nA: There are several solutions that enable us to stream music over a local cable or wireless network to a stereo. All this solutions involve some adapter on the receiver side to transform the digital audio signal. Some stereo devices already have this feature inbuilt. In all other case we may need to purchase some adapter. In the following I will list a few solutions that start from less than $100:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Airport Express / Air Tunes: proprietary RAOP streaming protocol supported by VLC and pulseaudio.\n\n*Bluetooth audio adapter (e.g. Logitech, Hama): supported by Bluez but may need an additional Bluetooth dongle\n\n*Internet Radio: any receiver capable to tune to Internet radio can receive audio streams generated in Ubuntu. These often are also capable to receive uPnP/DLNA streams.\n\n*Old PC as network client: we can also attach an old PC to our stereo to act as a receiving client for audio streams.\n\n*Proprietary solutions: they are usually higher prized and only few offer a Linux software (e.g. Squeezebox)\n\n\n\nAll of these solutions have their advantages, and disadvantages. So mainly we may decide on what hardware we already have (where a spare PC attached to the network may be the least costly variant with a maximum of flexibility).\n\nHere comes my own personal experience on various solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Apple RAOP-protocol used by AirTunes is well established in MacOS, and in Windows, but on a Linux system we are faced with a very long delay of several seconds during streams. In addition, achieving a stable connection that survives hours of playback can be quite a challenge. Streams will have a fixed bitrate only.\n\n*Bluetooth signals have a limited range where a streaming connection is stable. This range is in a distance where we could also use an audio cable coming out of our soundcard. The audio quality offered by the A2DP protocol may be disappointing for a purist's ears.\n\n\nTherefore my recommendation would be to attach an Internet radio receiver to our stereo. We could generate \"radio\" or DLNA streams with some music players, but with  an Icecast Server and additional software such as Darkice we are able to stream the audio output of our local soundcard. By this we can use any music player to manage the streams. The python application stream2ip helps to establish a connection to an Icecast server, and also supports Bluetooth, and RAOP/AirTunes streams.\n", "Q: What are the /dev/ramX devices? In /dev I have 12 or so devices named ram0 ram1 etc. What are those? What can they be used for?\n\nA: A lil' search, showed Those are RAM disks.\nWhat is a RAM disk? \n\n\n*\n\n*A RAM disk is a portion of RAM which is being used as if it were a\ndisk drive. RAM disks have fixed sizes, and act like regular disk\npartitions. Access time is much faster for a RAM disk than for a\nreal, physical disk. However, any data stored on a RAM disk is lost\nwhen the system is shut down or powered off. RAM disks can be a great\nplace to store temporary data.\n\n\nFor short,  a RAM disk is a virtual file system that runs entirely from your PC’s main memory, which means it’s lightning fast to read and write anything you want.\n", "Q: Source/Dot operator error on login. Possibly caused by bad byobu uninstall I am getting an error message every time I ssh into my box or run sudo -i.

I don't know if this has anything to do with the problem, but that's my point of reference before which everything worked fine.\nWhat could be going wrong here? Any ideas anyone?\n\nA: So the root cause of this issue was indeed byobu (well actually the lack of byobu). I do not know why but for some reason byobu didn't clean up a line from ~/.profile.This was the last line of the file: . $(which byobu-launch). Luckily I was able to find this line quite easily and quickly by doing the following (as advised by @enzotib and @geirha):\nFirst I ran bash -xl to enter bash as a login shell(-l) in debug mode(-x). When I ran this I could see what the offending line was. Once I knew what was causing the problem I issued cat <file> | grep . $(which byobu-launch) for every file that is executed when bash starts up. \nThose files are the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*~/.bashrc\n\n*/etc/bash.bashrc\n\n*~/.profile\n\n*/etc/profile\n\n*/etc/profile.d/*\n\n*~/.bash_profile\n\n*+ all others that are included/executed by any of the above files.\n\n", "Q: What Mesa and X.ORG version will Ubuntu 11.10 use With only 2 months left, what version of Mesa and X.org will Ubuntu 11.10 use.

dmesg files in /var/log/ for anything strange\n", "Q: \"Lock\" one specific file so that I nor root no longer have access to it any more To combat procrastination, I edit my /etc/hosts file by adding time-wasting websites and pointing them to localhost. However, the flesh is weak and I often find myself reverting my changes. \nI was thinking of the following solution, but I don't know if it is technically possible.\nI would ask a trusted friend to come over, create a new account with a strong password that I don't know, change the owner and permissions of the /etc/hosts file so that only that new user can change that file and that I nor root no longer have access to it.\nThe use case would be that I ask my friend to come over before the exam period, he changes the file and puts the procrastination blocking measures in place, and that during the time I need to study I have no way of editing the file myself. After the exam period is over, I ask him to 'unlock' the file and I can browse freely again.\n\nA: You can lock a file so not even root user can edit it.\nsudo chattr +i /etc/hosts\n\nStop reading this answer until after you exams :)\nThen you unlock the file again using \nsudo chattr -i /etc/hosts\n\n\nA: Ultimately, if root access is available, there is no foolproof way to stop a smart user from doing what they want. I do not think that there is a way to do this, other than to relinquish root access.\n\nA: You could set up another user account that is a regular desktop user than cannot use sudo.\nThen get your mate to come round and log in as you on your existing account, edit the /etc/hosts file, then reset your password without telling you what it is and log out.\nThen you have to use the new account, which does not have the rights to edit /etc/hosts.\nYou will still need to exercise will power though to stop you from booting from a live CD/USB.\n\nA: As an alternative, the same time you make your /etc/hosts file, you could also edit the /etc/sudoers file or just remove your user from the admin group. Changing group is probably easier.\nYou should probably build a safe-guard so that you can add yourself back to the group. I suggest adding something in /etc/rc.local or something in a wake script (quicker than doing a full reboot).\nIf the worst happens and you are locked out, you can boot to recovery mode (in grub) and use the root console to manually add your user back to the admin group.\n", "Q: How do I  accept inbound connections for a specific program? Windows firewall allows to specify a program that will accept inbound connections no matter on which port(s) is listening (instead of specifying the port(s) to allow for that program). Is this possible in Ubuntu with the default firewall? How?\n\nA: You may want to take a look at this help.ubuntu.com post on the firewall, particularly the \"ufw Application Integration\" section.\n", "Q: How do I disable SSHD from starting automatically? After installing openssh-server, the server start every time I boot. If I want it to be manual what do I need to do?\nIn version 0.6.7+ of upstart I would add a \"manual\" stanza to the job file.\n10.04 has upstart 0.6.5-8. What is the preferred way to disable ssh from starting automatically in this case?\n\nA: For system having systemd the proper way to do it is\nsudo systemctl disable ssh.service\n\nthen\nsudo systemctl stop ssh.service\n\n\nA: note to the reader:\nfor me (ubuntu 14.xx) only Bryan Agee's answer worked:\n/etc/init/ssh.conf: comment out the \"start on filesystem or runlevel...\" line\nwhy won't the others do?\n\nsudo mv /etc/init/ssh.conf /etc/init/ssh.conf.disabled\n\nwill result in completly deactivating the service. It is then not startable through \"service ssh start\" anymore.\n\nupdate-rc.d ssh enable # sets the default runlevels to on \n\ndoes simply not work (perhaps uses different autostart routine)\n\n/etc/init/ssh.conf.override with \"manual\"\n\nsimply doesnt work\n\ntouch /etc/ssh/sshd_not_to_be_run\n\nalso completly disables the system\n\nsudo apt-get install bum\n\nnice software, but it doesn't show ssh, so nothing to do here\nperson questioning:\n    why are the above answeres even here? is the start system so complicated or does nobody tries his solutions? oO\n\nA: sudo apt-get install bum\n\nStart bum with administrative privileges, disable openssh-server, confirm it, done.\n\nA: Rename /etc/init/ssh.conf to /etc/init/ssh.conf.disabled.\nsudo mv /etc/init/ssh.conf /etc/init/ssh.conf.disabled\n\n\nA: For versions with ssh started by upstart, run touch /etc/ssh/sshd_not_to_be_run. The upstart init script checks for this file and, if existent, does not start sshd.\n\nA: The manual method provided /etc/init/ssh.config.override method does not work for me using Ubuntu 14.04.03. sshd still starts automatically. \nThe /etc/ssh/sshd_not_to_be_run method prevents manual sshd start.\nI had to use Brian Agee's method of removing the \"start on\" on line of /etc/init/ssh.conf. Then to manually start sshd:\nsudo service ssh start\n\n\nA: This should be enough,:\n update-rc.d ssh enable # sets the default runlevels to on \n update-rc.d ssh disable # sets all to off\n\n\nA: I had the same question and here's what I did about it. It's a bit of a hack, perhaps, but it works well enough, and you don't need to compromise the program in any way. Put the following in your crontab:\n@reboot sudo service ssh stop\n\nThis tells cron to stop ssh every time you turn on your computer. Using ssh to connect to another computer isn't affected, as this only turns off the server service. And if you want to re-enable it for a short while, all you have to do is:\nsudo service ssh start\n\nJust remember to turn it back off when you're done!\n\nA: In your /etc/init/ssh.conf, comment out the start on line:\n# ssh - OpenBSD Secure Shell server\n#\n# The OpenSSH server provides secure shell access to the system.\n\ndescription     \"OpenSSH server\"\n\n#start on filesystem or runlevel [2345]\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\nrespawn\nrespawn limit 10 5\numask 022\n\n", "Q: How do I get the svn client to use a different copy of SSL? I was having an SSL issue with my SVN client. I saw online that it may be due to using an old version of OpenSSL. So I followed these instructions to build the latest version of OpenSSL. The latest version is now in /opt/openssl/ but the old version still exists. How do I point svn to use the SSL in /opt/openssl ?\n\nA: The version of subversion included in Ubuntu 11.04 at least does not link with OpenSSL, but instead uses the GnuTLS library:\n$ ldd /usr/bin/svn\n...\n        libgnutls.so.26 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgnutls.so.26 (0x00007fab1dd33000)\n...\n        libneon-gnutls.so.27 => /usr/lib/libneon-gnutls.so.27 (0x00007fab1d239000)\n\nSo compiling a new version of OpenSSL is not sufficient.  If you want Subversion to use it, you will probably have to recompile the Neon library and Subversion itself.\nWhat makes you think that the SSL library is the cause of the problem you're seeing?  Perhaps there is some other solution to your problem aside from recompiling everything.\n", "Q: Anyone get sound working on a HP 8540p? When running 10.10 on my HP 8450p laptop, sound worked fine.

I have a Dell laptop, Inspiron 9100, with a ATI Technologies Inc RV350 [Mobility Radeon 9600 M10] video card. The video performance has always been pretty poor in Ubuntu. Though slightly improved in 11.04. Symptoms are video tearing on full screen, stuttering images due to low refresh rates. \nI have read about the ATI propriety drivers with catalyst. On the web there seems to be those for and against propriety drivers and also some problems (sometimes serious) after installing the propriety drivers. \n\n\n*\n\n*Would you recommend it?\n\n*Will it help video performance?\n\n*What are the risks (i.e. will I end up with a blank-screened brick)?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*I would recommend it only if you are using 3D Applications which have a poor performance or simply don't work with the open source drivers.\n\n*Yes it increases the performance (a lot).\n\n*You can always boot into the recovery mode and install the open source drivers (if you have a blank screen or stuff like that). See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/FglrxInteferesWithRadeonDriver#Problem:__Need_to_fully_remove_-fglrx_and_reinstall_-ati_from_scratch for detailed instructions.\n\nA: a) No. ATI dropped support for older cards in 2008, including your Mobility Radeon 9xxx. This means that the Catalyst/FGLRX driver from ATI will NOT work properly with your card.\nb) Very unlikely. Even if you are lucky and the driver would work and get anything from your card, it is doubtful the performance will be any good, because, as I've already said, the support for 9xxx was dropped a long time ago.\nc) The risks are very small though, if you try to install it won't do any harm to your hardware, but if the driver won't work, Ubuntu should enter a lo-fi graphics mode with a res of 800x600 or similar, so you will be able to deactivate the driver and fall back to the open-source one. Alternatively you may be unable to start the X server, but you can boot in the rescure mode and disable the driver from command line.\nConcluding, your card is simply too old, and ATI does not care about you - they want you to buy a new one. However, the open-source driver developers do care about old cards, so the only way you can get anything from your card is to use the default, open-source driver.\n", "Q: How to copy only file attributes (metadata) without actual content of the file? I've already copied terabytes of files with rsync but I forgot to use --archive to preserve files' special attributes.\nI tried executing rsync again this time with --archive but it was way slower than what I expected. Is there any easy way to do this faster by just copying metadata recursively?\n\nA: Treating the question as \"rsync only has metadata to copy, so why is it so slow, and how can I make it faster?\":\nrsync usually uses equal mtimes as a heuristic to detect and skip unchanged files.  Without --archive (specifically, without --times) the destination files' mtimes remain set to the time you rsync-ed them, while the source files' mtimes remain intact (ignoring manual trickery by you).  Without external guarantees from you that the source files' contents haven't changed, rsync has to assume they might have and therefore has to checksum them and/or copy them to the destination again.  This, plus the fact that --whole-file is implied for local->local syncs, makes rsync without --times approximately equivalent to cp for local syncs. \nProvided that updating the destination files' contents is acceptable, or if the source files are untouched since the original copy, you should find rsync --archive --size-only quicker than a naive rsync.\nIf in doubt as to what rsync is copying that is taking so long, rsync --archive --dry-run --itemize-changes ... tells you in exhaustive, if terse, detail.\n\nA: WARNING: Without special workarounds, GNU cp --attributes-only will truncate the destination files, at least in Precise.  See the edit below.\nOriginal:\nIn this situation you probably want GNU cp's --attributes-only option, together with --archive, as it's tried and tested code, does all filesystem-agnostic attributes and doesn't follow symlinks (following them can be bad!):\ncp --archive --attributes-only /source/of/failed/backup/. /destination/\n\nAs with files, cp is additive with extended attributes: if both source and destination have extended attributes it adds the source's extended attributes to the destination (rather than deleting all of the destination's xattrs first).  While this mirrors how cp behaves if you copy files into an existing tree, it might not be what you expect.\nAlso note that if you didn't preserve hard links the first time around with rsync but want to preserve them now then cp won't fix that for you; you're probably best off rerunning rsync with the right options (see my other answer) and being patient. \nIf you found this question while looking to deliberately separate and recombine metadata/file contents then you might want to take a look at metastore which is in the Ubuntu repositories.\nSource: GNU coreutils manual\n\nEdited to add:\ncp from GNU coreutils >= 8.17 and above will work as described, but coreutils <= 8.16 will truncate files when restoring their metadata.  If in doubt, don't use cp in this situation; use rsync with the right options and/or be patient.\nI wouldn't recommend this unless you fully understand what you're doing, but earlier GNU cp can be prevented from truncating files using the LD_PRELOAD trick:\n/*\n * File: no_trunc.c\n * Author: D.J.

Here is a script to do so\n#!/bin/bash\n# Filename: cp-metadata\n\nmyecho=echo\nsrc_path=\"$1\"\ndst_path=\"$2\"\n\nfind \"$src_path\" |\n  while read src_file; do\n    dst_file=\"$dst_path${src_file#$src_path}\"\n    $myecho chmod --reference=\"$src_file\" \"$dst_file\"\n    $myecho chown --reference=\"$src_file\" \"$dst_file\"\n    $myecho touch --reference=\"$src_file\" \"$dst_file\"\n  done\n\nYou should run it with sudo (to allow chown) and with two parameters: source and destination directory. The script only echo what it would do. If satisfied change the line myecho=echo with myecho=.\n\nA: In local transfers, when source and destination are on locally mounted filesystems, rsync will always copy whole files content. To avoid this you can use\nrsync -a --no-whole-file source dest\n\n", "Q: Desktop search engine for 11.04 Just as the title says I'm searching for a great desktop search engine with nice Unity integration.

Or is it the (ungültige Kodierung) (mis encoded) at the end of the file?\n\nA: The problem\nGerman umlauts ä,ö,ü and UTF-8 encoding are the problem here. Most likely you copied the files from a windows system (using ISO-8859-1 encoding) to a Linux system (using UTF-8). A computer can only store bits. The mapping of a combination of bits to a real character a human can read is called the encoding. E.g. using UTF-8 the letter a is encoded as 01100001. For umlauts those bit sequences differ in the two encodings, so a UTF-8 system displays another character or doesn't know the bit sequence altogether. That's the whole problem.\nThe solution\nWith the shell program convmv  / sudo apt-get install convmv you can rename files with broken umlauts to their correct UTF-8 charset. Usage:\nconvmv --notest -r -f ISO8859-1 -t UTF-8 <Verzeichnisname\n\nRun that on your files after installing convmv by clicking on the Software Center icon above or using the shell command provided next to it.

My git repos are backed up in dropbox, but, how can I backup my ruby version, with rvm and heroku ssh keys?\nAnd after reinstalling, how do I restore these configs in my new running system?\n\nA: You can back up your ssh keys by creating a copy of the .ssh folder in your home folder. You can backup your Heroku credentials by creating a copy of the .heroku folder in your home folder. It would also be wise to backup any gpg keys you have by creating a copy of ~/.gnupg if it exists.

So just change (in /etc/fstab):\n# swap was on /dev/sda5 during installation\n#UUID=fe10641d-a928-479e-ab3a-b0706b97b601 none            swap    sw              0       0\n/dev/mapper/cryptswap1 none swap sw 0 0\n\nto\n# swap was on /dev/sda5 during installation\nUUID=fe10641d-a928-479e-ab3a-b0706b97b601 none            swap    sw              0       0\n\nIMPORTANT: Before you restart, make sure you check that fe10641d-a928-479e-ab3a-b0706b97b601 is actually /dev/sda5 by running:\nls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/fe10641d-a928-479e-ab3a-b0706b97b601\n\nIt should say something like:\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 2011-08-16 08:28 /dev/disk/by-uuid/fe10641d-a928-479e-ab3a-b0706b97b601 -> ../../sda5\n\nThe sda5 part at the end is the important part. Once you are sure the UUID matches the partition number, run sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda and make sure that /dev/sda5 is a swap partition.\nThen just restart and that's it :) Hope this helps.\n\nA: Like Chen Xiao-Long discribed in his answer, you have to remove \"cryptswap\" line in /etc/fstab. Then you uncomment previously commented swap line so end of file looks like that:\n# swap was on /dev/sda5 during installation\nUUID=fe10641d-a928-479e-ab3a-b0706b97b601 none            swap    sw              0       0\n\nTo verify UUID and filesystem type (with cleaned cache), run:\n~$ sudo blkid /dev/sda5 -c /dev/null\n\nTo try your new configuration immediately you have to reload /etc/fstab:\n~$ sudo mount -a\n\nApart from that I have no idea why an (release?) upgrade causes this error.\n\nOld version:\nRequest:\n\n*\n\n*/etc/crypttab\n\n\n*ls -l /dev/mapper\n\n\n*lvscan (only LVM)\n\n\n*fdisk -l\n\n\n*cat /proc/swaps\n\n\n*why is your UUID line of swap partition commented?\n\n\n*is UUID output of blkid command same as in /etc/fstab (or is that all output of blkid)?\nTemporay fix:\nTo suppress this message on boot you can add mount option \"nobootwait\" or comment line in /etc/fstab.\n", "Q: How does Application Review Board work? According to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppReviews the Application Review Process is good both for upstream software developers and Ubuntu packagers. The point seems to be that the upstream developers have the advantage of getting their apps into the Software Center sooner and easier, while they help the Ubuntu package managers by preparing their application for packaging.\nThis seems to be a great deal. The instruction on wiki states that a developer fulfills some steps listed there, including uploading the application to a PPA, and requests review, and after some time it is reviewed, and accepted & included to Ubuntu repositories, or not accepted at all.\nAlthough this looks like a simple, fair way to quickly add an application to the Software Center, I think I am missing something. I have noticed, that while there are some requests pending, there is no (or barely any) activity there. Everything seems as if it was frozen about 5-6 months ago, and it smells a bit abandoned.\nDid I understand anything wrong, and everything is okay (maybe for example they are being reviewed only at the UDS?), or did something change? Could anyone explain me clearly, how exactly this process of reviews (and inclusion in repositories) works?\n\nA: Current Situation\nThe ARB was a session topic (Tues 6th Sept) in the recent Ubuntu App-Developers Week (5th-9th Sept).\nSummarising the IRC classroom (transcribed as the lesson unfolded hence the brevity and that it reflects the order of the lesson!):\n\n\n*\n\n*In future, just like paid for applications, free/libre apps will be submitted through the MyApps portal (see blueprint below)\n\n*The ARB is a 4 community member group responsible to allow small standalone apps into a stable distro (i.e. has been released)\n\n*Board offers assistance for packaging and ensures apps meets standard ubuntu packaging rules.\n\n*Two apps have gone through the process - 'News' and 'Suspended Sentence' - both made available to Maverick (10.10)\n\n*Confirmed that Launchpad will be dropped in favour of the MyApps portal.\n\n*Ways to get free/libre apps into ubuntu - through debian and sync to ubuntu before feature freeze, via a backport or through the ARB\n\n*Ways to get paid for apps into ubuntu - Canonical partner apps (case be case basis) or via Purchase Apps through Software Center\n\n*If submitted via ARB - you are the maintainer and are responsible for submitting for every new release of Ubuntu.  Hence the preference for packages from upstream since they are automatically sync'd.\n\n*ARB accepted apps are added to extras.ubuntu.com repository\n\n*If there is a critical bug or security issue in an ARB package a board member will attempt to fix on a best effort basis - then contact the maintainer.  Where the maintainer is not responsive - app will be removed and an empty package is pushed.\n\n*ARB members recognise the length review process.  Looking to use Arkose to containerise apps - similar to Android app with a list of actions that an app is allowed to perform.  Should allow faster review without having to do a full code-review (this is the key reason for the current length delay).  It is also the reason cannot accept complex apps or apps written in certain languages\n\n*Also looking to produce a debhelper script to automatically package a app to meet ARB rules.\n\n*Long-term - submission via MyApps as tarball of source code with a build recipe.  This will generate a Arkose or Apparmor profile etc.  ARB process should be then reviewed in hours (rather than as now weeks) before being pushed to Software Center.\nARB Blueprint\nThe Oneiric ARB blueprint was raised in May this year and is targeted for Oneiric.\nThe review tag-line is \n\"We want to socialize how people can get their apps in Ubuntu, and we want to review how well the ARB is working.\n\n\n*\n\n*Which things work well?\n\n*Which are the areas that need improvement?\"\n\n\nSome progress has been made in achieving the blue-print's goals:\n\n\n*\n\n*New app-review mailing list (app-review-board@lists.ubuntu.com)\n\n*checklist of steps for uploading apps to the live extras repository\n\n*Progress towards talking towards stakeholders on how to simplify the process on merging and incorporating changes\n\n*Preparing and article for publishing on Ubuntu Planet\n\n*New beta web-page for developers to guide through the process of submitting (although currently for commercial developers)\n\n\n\nAs the notes in the blue-print indicate - Canonical's own developers need \"motivating\" to get the ARB process working.  There is talk of recruiting someone to primarily to move the process forward.\nTime-frame\nSo to answer the question - the ARB is working for Commercial developers (just), with plans for the ARB to be fully working within Oneiric timeframes.  \nYou could however speculate, given the number of outstanding items in the blueprint - maybe 12.04 would be a more safer bet.\n\nA: In May, there has been ARB review and assessment session meant to improve the way ARB works:\nhttp://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-o/meeting/16441/community-o-app-review-board-review-and-assessment/\nFrom these notes, it seems it is not abandoned, however not really working well as of now.\n", "Q: Can't delete/edit files on my pendrive I'm trying to delete the .Trash-1000 from my pen drive, but with\nsudo rm -rf .Trash-1000/\n\nI got\nrm: cannot remove `.Trash-1000/expunged/2660089871/apps.log': Read-only file system\n\n(one line of this for each file within .Trash-1000/)\nI found this similar question, but I still got the same result after running:\nsudo mount -o remount,rw '/media/SGTL MSCN'\nsudo rm -rf .Trash-1000\n\nSo, any idea how to remove this folder (or its content)?\nBy the way, I need to remove it because I'm using the pen drive to test a software, and there's a file there that should not be found in the pen drive.\n--update\nI thought it was corrupted, like Allan pointed, but the same just happened to another new pen drive I plugged here.. After use it on VMWare (in a new OS that still don't have a name), and go back to Ubuntu, I can no more edit it's files, nither make a filesystem check or format it.\n\nA: If I were to guess it sounds to me like your Pendrive is corrupted.\nthe simple solution is to back-up and reformat however if you want to find out if it is really corrupted or not which could be a sign of a failing flash drive use fsck\nfirst back-up your pendrive/card then find out what mount point its under eg. /dev/sdb , /dev/sdc etc.\nYou can find this information in disk utility under the heading Device: \nin the screen shot it is /dev/sdb1\nYou can then modify these commands and run each\nsudo umount /media/disk\n\nsudo fsck -favVr /dev/sdb1\n\nAlternatively you can click \"check file system\" after unmounting the drive in disk utility\n\nEdit:\nI have found another solution to this problem the steps are as follows\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the USB Drive you are having the problem with\n\n*Open Disk Utility as root open a terminal and enter gksu palimpsest\n\n*Unmount the Drive and remove\n\n*Plug it back in\n\n\nHopefully this will work if all else has failed\n\nA: i had a similiar issue. I was doing a backup of a partition with \"Redo Backup\" to a usb drive. I had to cancel the backup, and the files could not be deleted. The files were in the Trash and still on my external drive, but I could'nt delete any of those, even as root.\nMy solutuion was to boot Windows (I still use it for playing games), and then I could delete the files. Maybe booting from a Live CD helps, or you plug the USB drive to a other computer running a diferent OS. I know this is a bit lame, but it was the quickest solution for me.\n\nA: Open the disk utility(Type \"disk\" in search and click on the first application) then after opening of the application click on your pendrive name \nscreenshot1\nThen, click on the white space(In my case its written \"Sony partition 1 32gb\")\nscreenshot2\nThen, click on \"setting\" icon and select \"Format Partition\".The below screen will appear.Enter \"volume name\" and in \"type\" choose \"for use with all systems and devices(FAT)\" \nscreenshot3\nThen press \"next\" > press \"format\". You are done.\n\nA: For the case of emptying the trash on a pen drive, this ubuntuforums.org page addresses a similar situation.\nOne solution discussed on that page is to select the .Trash-1000 folder in the File Manager and then press <Shift>-<Delete>.\nUpon doing this, the file manager pops up a dialog indicating the action is irreversible and queries whether to continue or not.\nThis solution is known to work on other Linux distributions.\n\nA: chmod +rx .Trash-1000 -R\nrm -rf .Trash-1000\n\nThis should hopefully fix your issue, I had the problem few days back where even if I owned folder I couldn't delete content cause folder was not executable -R if u have recursive folders\nHope that does it for you\n", "Q: Splitting a PDF page in two I have a PDF file that was the result of the scan of a book.\nIn this file 2 pages of the book correspond to 1 in the PDF.

I will be using a Ubuntu server install as a server for a MySQL database. Is there any benefit to having /var in a separate partition from the root file system?\n\nA: I always have /var on a separate partition and never had problems with it. Doing it this way prevents a misbehaving application (like your database server, but also log files in /var/log) from eating up all the space on the disk. Of course it also works the other way around. If someone (or some program) decides to write enormous files in /tmp this would affect your database as well if /tmp and /var reside on the same partition. \nIf you plan on putting parts of your directory hierarchy on different partitions I would suggest to take a look at LVM (the Logical Volume Manager). LVM allows you to dynamically extend your 'partitions' (called Logical Volumes or LVs in LVM parlance). This means that if your LV containing /var/ is almost full you can extend it, grow the file system on the fly and continue without any interruption to your database. \n\nA: I've tried to run one of my natty servers with a separate /var a couple of weeks before - it just doesn't start.\nThere seems to be a pretty long history of Ubuntu having various problems with /var on a separate filesystem\nSo, your best bet is to have some separate data partition, just not put there your entire /var\n\nA: You could either make a symlink or just mount the partition as /var. If you want to mount it as /var you'll need to specify that in /etc/fstab.\n", "Q: Chromium Instances running as root Using Lubuntu and its Task Manager (LXTask) I noticed that some instances of Chromium are running as user root.

How to get deskbar-applet in Xubuntu?

There are a number of default plugins which are similar in functionality as deskbar as well.\nIt uses the Zeitgeist backend - so it is similar to Unity - when you use a file or application it is automatically indexed for you to find again.\n\nA: Catfish is built in, it's just not obvious it's a file system search application. Put a shortcut to it on your panel.\n\nA: I'd recommend trying Gnome Do, it's not as snappy as synapse, but the difference is marginal and it supports more apps and is much better at finding files.

In Firefox 5.0 on Ubuntu 11.04, Bindwood is disabled as \"incompatible with FF 5.0\". The xpi on Launchpad can't be installed for the same reason.\nI'm aware of various bug reports concerning bookmark sync, and indeed I never actually got it working in earlier versions of Ubuntu and Firefox, but this Bindwood incompatibility seems to close off any prospect of getting it working.\nI know about Firefox's own sync, too, but I'd rather get Ubuntu One's working, partly so as not to have to set up yet another account.\nIs a fix being worked on, or am I missing something? I had thought the latest Ubuntu would offer the best chance of working bookmarks sync.\nLooks as though Firefox's built-in sync may be the answer, after all. Expecially as, following another routine upgrade, I'm now using Firefox 6. That's too bad - but I guess Ubuntu could argue it's not worth their while to duplicate something that now works in Firefox.\n\nA: Ubuntu One does not support Bookmark-Sync any more: Putting bookmark sync to bed\n\nA: Install the Addon Compatibility Reporter extension -- with that, you can force Firefox to treat this extension (or any extension) as compatible.  In (common) cases where an extension just needs a compatible-version-bump, this is the perfect workaround.\nIt's of course possible that the extension is legitimately incompatible due to Firefox code changes, in which case this might cause problems.  It's probably worth backing up your ~/.mozilla directory before doing this, just in case.\nHaving said that, I've personally never hit any issues from using the Addon Compatibility Reporter.\n", "Q: Is having the 'swap' partition at the 'beginning' better than at the 'end'? I recently installed Ubuntu 11.04 onto a RAID0(stripe) device using the alternate installation disc and manually partitioned the HDs ext4 and swap partitions; during this process, I was reading in a forum walkthrough (can't remember where...) that having the swap partition at the beginning of your hard drive could be better for some reason!\nIs the idea that the swap is \"closer\" at the beginning so its accessed quicker with a lower latency/delay? The HD 'needle' moves less to reach the swap...\nThis confuses me because I like to think of Hard Drives as likened to a samurai sword(not literally)!\nI was told that the last inch or two at the tip of the sword is the cutting edge because it travels the fastest.\n(Think of a ball on a string and as you swing it around the ball at the end of the string is travelling at a greater speed than it would be if it was closer to the source - your hand)\nBUT since the HD is spinning at (x)RPM then the outer edge of that HD should be spinning relatively faster (+x) providing quicker read/write rate.\nSo does the swap position affect performance in anyway? If so, is it better to have it placed in the beginning for immediate access, or at the end for increased read/write?\nI would think the swap is sized and placed according to the individuals needs but how do I decide...\nEDIT:\nAs a note, I do have 8GB of RAM (4x2GB) so I noticed that the swap has not been used in any of my GIS (mapping and analysis) processing. 8GB is the full capacity for my motherboard.\n\nA: You should use RAM, not SWAP, because swap is terrible slow, compared to RAM. You can use RAM for the sleep mode. \nThe speed to access the first or the last sector on disk, when the head comes from the sleep position is so small (6–20 ms), that it doesn't affect your experience. \nIf you have many read/write cycles from swap, so that microscopic intervals could sum up to a mentionable fraction of a second, you would have continuous reading from swap - not repeated movements from a sleep position, so this could only be an argument, if there are more bits read from the outer sectors, than from the inner ones. \nBut do you know whether the first block is on the outer or on the inner side, and where the head is in sleep position?\nAnd are you sure, that more information is put on the outer sectors? Maybe the bits there are at the proportion wider, as the disks rotates faster, so that you have a constant number of bytes in each sector. At least the diagram of wikipedia (DE) suggests so.\nBut - modern drives have a controller, which presents himself to the outer world as a virtual hard drive, and manages it's internals on his own, so every model could handle its geometry differently. \nIf you really depend on performance, you should go for more RAM, more RAM, more RAM. If you can't get more RAM for your machine, you should consider buying a faster hard drive, instead of guessing with it's geometry. \n\nA: You can measure the speed of different areas of the hard drive with System > Administration > Disk Utility (palimpsest from command line): pick your hard drive from the list and click on Benchmark. For swap use the read-write test results will be more salient, but please note that the test erases data. The resulting graph should give you an idea of the internal performance differences your drive has.\n\nA: Forget swords and balls on string. Think of a stack of CD platters and then you will have in mind an image closer to what a hard drive is actually like.\nWikipedia on hard disks\nThink also of the amount of Memory in the computer and ask, how often does the swap partition get used? Your question could be irrelevant. Disks do not have a beginning or an end. They have outer edges and inner edges. Data is placed across more than one platter. Seek times and access times, as well as spin speeds, would turn any answer into a debate.\nNote this point from the Wikipedia article under HDD Formatting \n\nModern HDDs ... appear at their interfaces as a contiguous set of logical blocks; typically 512 bytes long\n\nIt only appears that has a beginning and an end. If performance is a concern then more RAM will have a greater effect than the placement of the swap partition.\n\nA: It does not matter, the system will spend just about the same amount of time (maybe delays of microseconds or even smaller than that. All in all you would not realise the difference anyways.) read/writing swap if it's at the beginning or the end.\n\nA: I don't think the end matters overly much but just in case I toss it at the beginning on my regular machines, but for my 2U rack which has 4.5 TB. I have 360g of that in 4 striped 7200 Barracudas that serve as the swap file and temp directories.\n\nA: It does not matter at all and the difference is fractions of a second.. so if you going for fractiona of a sec faster load time then more than likely the beginning would be your best bet.. considering the majority of time it's gonna be reading towards the beginning to the middle or so.. unless your hard drive has tons of data on it.. in which case it will be reading from the farthest point from the beginning when that data is accessed... But at the end of the day who cares \n\nA: I ran a benchmark to test some speeds for myself. On a 500G ASMT Drive I created 16G partitions at the beginning and at the end. I created ext2 filesystems on them (no journaling). Tested copying some files to them, mounted as 1 and 2.\n# rm -r 1/{*,.*} 2/{*,.*} 2> /dev/null; time /bin/cp -a /mnt/4/Syncs/osmand/. 1; time /bin/cp -a /mnt/4/Syncs/osmand/. 2\nreal    0m3.500s\nuser    0m0.016s\nsys     0m1.490s\n\nreal    0m21.152s\nuser    0m0.001s\nsys     0m1.535s\n# rm -r 1/{*,.*} 2/{*,.*} 2> /dev/null; time /bin/cp -a /mnt/4/Syncs/osmand/. 1; time /bin/cp -a /mnt/4/Syncs/osmand/. 2                                                              \nreal    0m4.721s\nuser    0m0.012s\nsys     0m1.509s\n\nreal    0m19.691s\nuser    0m0.000s\nsys     0m1.518s\n# rm -r 1/{*,.*} 2/{*,.*} 2> /dev/null; time /bin/cp -a /mnt/4/Syncs/osmand/. 1; time /bin/cp -a /mnt/4/Syncs/osmand/. 2                                                                                               \nreal    0m4.784s\nuser    0m0.006s\nsys     0m1.503s\n\nreal    0m19.664s\nuser    0m0.000s\nsys     0m1.526s\n\nThe beginning partition was about 5 times faster in these tests. With larger tests, I experienced less dramatic differences, but the beginning partition always seemed to be faster. I suspect that at the end of the disk the writes may have been crossing platters more often.\n", "Q: How to prevent svnserve from overwriting SVN repository permissions? Some coworkers and I are accessing SVN repositories through SSH. In order to make the repositories readable and writable to all of our accounts, we have created a group called \"developers\" and made each repository owned by that group.\nHowever when one of us commits, certain files in the repositories have their permissions changed from adminuser:developers to user1:user1. This prevents any of the other users from committing to the same repository.\nI have worked around this problem before, but I forgot how I did it. I have heard the \"wrapper\" idea, which involves writing a wrapper script for svnserve that changes the umask to 002 and then executes the actual svnserve binary. But that doesn't seem to be working for me now. How do I go about fixing this problem?\n\nA: Ok, I found it. Full instructions can be found here: http://odyniec.net/articles/ubuntu-subversion-server/\nSpecifically, it says\n\nAdditionally, you need to make sure that all new files and directories created in the repos directory (in other words, anything committed to the repositories) will also be owned by the group. To accomplish this, use chmod again to set the set-group-ID bit on the directory, which causes any file created inside it to have the same group ownership as the directory itself. Effectively, everything in repos will belong to the svn group.\n$ sudo chmod g+s /usr/local/svn/repos\n\nFor me, since I had multiple repositories already, I used\n$ sudo chmod -R g+s /usr/local/svn/repos\n", "Q: IPv6 over PPPoe? What is the best way to be able to get IPv6 addresses over PPPoe? \nI currently use NM-Applet to get internet service from my ISP, but it has no IPv6 tab on PPPOE connections. I wouldn't mind using some command line tool, but it would be nice to transfer my settings from NM-applet to whatever tool if I have to do that.\n\nA: You can try adding\n+ipv6 ipv6cp-use-ipaddr\n\nto /etc/ppp/options. Depending on how your ISP provides IPv6 this might be enough to give the machine itself IPv6.\nMany ISPs assume that a router connects with PPPoE instead of a PC, so this might not work for you. The only way to get IPv6 in this situation is to configure your machine as a router. It should then use DHCP for IPv6 to ask for Prefix Delegation. The prefix it gets can then be used to assign /64 subnets to your networks or your local machine. And if you want to provide IPv6 service to your local networks you should run radvd (router advertisement daemon) to advertise that your machine is a router.\nThe easiest is to use wide-dhcpdv6 for this. The basic idea is to request prefix delegation from one interface and then use that prefix to assign subnets to other interfaces, like:\ninterface ppp0 {\n    # Request Prefix Delegation on ppp0, and give the received prefix id 0\n    send ia-pd 0;\n};\n\n# Use subnets from the prefix with id 0\nid-assoc pd 0 {\n    prefix-interface eth0 {\n        # Assign subnet 1 to eth0\n        sla-id 1;\n    };\n};\n\nLet's say that you received prefix 2001:db8:1234::/48 from your ISP. This example would then assign 2001:db8:1234:1::/64 to eth0.\nA basic radvd.conf would look like:\ninterface eth0\n{\n    AdvSendAdvert on;\n    prefix ::/64\n    {\n        AdvOnLink on;\n        AdvAutonomous on;\n    };\n};\n\nOh, and don't forget to put\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1\n\nin your /etc/sysctl.conf.\n\nA: Sander Steffann's answer is great, but if you found you got the IPv6 address (can be checked via ip addr or ifconfig), and mtr -6 www.google.com was still not working, it might be caused by some sort of default routing assignment in your local router (can be checked via ip -6 route or netstat -6rn).\nOne way to solve this issue is to disable RA on your ethernet port, like this (change the existing file in /etc/netplan/):\nnetwork:\n    version: 2\n    renderer: networkd\n    ethernets:\n        enp3s0:\n            accept-ra: false\n\n", "Q: What does each of these network services do I have the services listed in the /etc/init.d folder starting with 'network':\ncyrex@cyrex:/etc/init.d$ ls network*\nnetworking                  network-interface-security\nnetwork-interface           network-manager\n\nWhat does each of these do.

In Windows; you have the C:\\ drive. This is the primary drive upon which Windows is installed.\nHowever, Linux uses a different naming scheme: sda, sdb[1-4], etc. Can anyone give me a brief outline of it so I might actually understand it instead of being confused by it?\n\nA: While SCSI and SATA will continue to be around for some time in mainstream desktop and laptop configurations, mobile devices using eMMC storage in the /dev/mmcblk*p* naming scheme have been around a few years and non-SATA high performance NVMe SSDs (/dev/nvme*n*) are not far away.\n\nA: Pavlos G. is mostly correct, however /dev/hd** is no longer in use by IDE harddisks (and CD drives), they have been using /dev/sd** since kernel 2.6.19 (and ubuntu since 7.10, ~2007)\n\nA: In general, the letters (fd, sd, hd) refer to the device type ('SATA, SCSI/SATA, IDE'), the third letter is for the device order (a the first, b the second, etc) and  the numbers refer to the partitions the device has, starting by zero.\n\n\n*\n\n*hd refers to an IDE-type drive\n\n*sd refers to a SCSI drive in general, but is mostly popular for SATA drives and CD/DVD\n\n*fd is floppy disk\n\n\nSo for example:  \n\n\n*\n\n*the first (1) partition on your first (a) SATA drive is /dev/sda1  \n\n*The third (3) partition on your second (b) SATA drive is /dev/sdb3\n\n*the second partition (2) of the second (b) IDE hard disk is '/dev/hdb2'\n\n\nThis device naming is more of a background one, as the actual point to access it a directory mount point. \nI think that the following three articles will help you a bit:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu install-guide: Device Names in Linux\n\n*http://tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/Partition/\n\n*Ubuntu install-guide: Linux Devices\n\nA: You really shouldn't rely on the sd* naming scheme. It can change dramatically depending on drive spin up, hot plugging, and additional storage adapters. Best thing to use to uniquely address your device is the persistent links like /dev/disk/by-id/. Linux doesn't have the \"boot from first disk\" limitations and can also mount drives by label so drive ordering is really irrelevant. \n\nA: Just for clarity, on the Windows side you're confusing the file system naming with the drive naming.  Windows hides the drive naming from you almost completely, but you can see examples in the registry and if you edit your boot.ini file.  A disk reference there might look like this:  \nmulti(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\n\nYou can also see individual disks in the disk manager tool.  The reason I bring this up is that the ntfs file system allows you to play all kinds of games.  You can mount a separate disk to a folder in your C: and another drive at the same time, and unmounted disks may not have a drive letter at all.  So don't confuse the file system from disk naming.\nLinux is similar, here.  sda1 is a common partition name, but it could be mounted anywhere on the file system.\n", "Q: PHP upgrades from 5.3.2 to 5.3.6 I am using Ubuntu 10.04.

Why is that?\nUPDATE\nI notice I need to use ./. But I thought it will look in the current directory anyway?\n./test.sh\n\n\nA: You need to start it with ./file.sh, because the current dir is not in the PATH. \nIf this isn't sufficient, becaused you missed, what frabjous suggests, to chmod a+x, you should start programs beginning with a shebang #!/bin/bash with \nbash file.sh\n\nnot\nsh file.sh\n\neven if sh is a symbolic link to /bin/bash. \nThe shell checks how it was invoked, and can be invoked as sh to act in a compatible mode, therefore it can fail to handle some bashisms, which would work if invoked as bash file.sh. \nThat was not your problem, but might become one, if you don't know these subtle distinction. \n\nA: First you need to make sure the file is executable:\nchmod +x file.sh\nAnd then to run it, you either need to put it in your PATH, i.e., one of the directories of files the OS searches when looking for files to run, which you can find with echo $PATH, or else you need to type in:\n./file.sh\nRather than just type file.sh. \nYou can just type file.sh, if it's in your PATH, which I recommend. A good place is in ~/bin. Create that folder if it's not there, and under Ubuntu, it'll get added to your path when you log in.\n", "Q: No keyboard layout in keyboard preferences to match Danish macbook Some critical keys (@) are in accessible on my Macbook running Natty.

I have two HP remotes, one is a huge remote for the TV tuner and media centre, and the other is a tiny remote for just controlling a media centre.\nIs it possible to get them to work with Ubuntu (11.04) using LIRC? I know at least one of them is recognized, as I can use one of the buttons to turn the screen off.\nWhat would I need for full support? (The laptop is a HP DV7 1020us, but the remotes are found in just about all the HP laptops from this period).\n\nA: There are two main ways LIRC supports remotes.\nOne is just via a generic IR receiver. It's possible to \"train\" these to get a config file, or download one. These just list the pulse timings for each button.\nThe other means is via an event device - which is the likely mechanism of the remote you've got, since it already has an effect on your machine. This is where the kernel has a driver for this remote, and translates it's pulses into events.\nThe device is effectively plumbed in as an extra keyboard with some odd keys, some of which have bindings in X. You can use LIRC to add extra bindings to such a device via it's evdev (event device) module.\ndo\nlsmod | grep evdev\nAnd see if the evdev module is loaded - this is often in response to one of these remote receivers. The kernel drivers for these modules usually map the events to the standard set of key codes. Some of the keys might even be in the usual keymap - the remotes I have produce the correct keycodes for numerics, enter, etc - and you can see them inputting keys into applications like any other HID keyboard.\ntry working out which /dev/input/eventN device your remote is - try looking through your dmesg output ; e/g/\ndmesg | grep event\nThen run one of the LIRC debug tools, irw\nirw /dev/input/eventN  # should produce a list of button identifiers when you point and shoot. Once you have this working ... \nFrom here you can configure LIRC to receive certain button presses and send other keys to applications.

I've got a LoCo event coming up, and a local company (that uses and loves Ubuntu) has approached me (since I'm the organizer) with the following proposal: \nThey'd like to \"sponsor\" the event - bring in coffee (as well as providing us with a meeting place) in exchange for a nice little blurb - is that considered \"OK\" to do? \nAre there guidelines for this sorta thing already? Or do I have to use my gut to make sure it doesn't become \"commercial\"?\n\nA: I don't see anything wrong with this at all! It already happens in other LoCos. You're approaching it with the right mentality though. The benefit (of funding, etc) to the event attendees should heavily outweigh the marketing presence. A visible logo and a mention at the beginning and end seems like a typical convention, erm, convention.\nIf they want to sit everybody down and give them a 10 minute talk, that's probably too far... Unless they're going to give everybody an ice cream and a cigar... There's always a balance to be made, I guess. \nI've had a rummage around for official guidelines but haven't found anything but as Andrew says, there are mailing lists for this sort of support.\n\nA: Per discussions I have had with a LoCo Council Member there is no problem accepting sponsorship's or donations from companies so long as such a sponsorship or donation does not come with strings attached that require the LoCo to do sales pitches or endorse a certain product or company. \nFurther I have talked with a few other LoCo Team Leads and it seems like accepting sponsorship's and donations is common and helps LoCo's provide common things like stickers, shirts and light food at events.\nI guess a good rule of thumb is just try to make it clear that by making a donation or sponsoring an event that they are not entitled to any endorsement or perk other than perhaps a personal thanks at the event or once on the mailing list. Additionally I personally feel that when accepting donations or sponsorship's it is best to be transparent to your entire LoCo and make sure the entire team knows what was donated/sponsored. \nIn closing I suggest if a company is going to sponsor an expense that you ask that they directly pay for it versus accepting any monies.\nSurely, if you have any questions or need guidance you can always seek out such from the LoCo Council via their mailing list or on IRC.\n\nA: As an Ubuntu member, I don't see anything wrong with this in the least. Especially if the sponsor \"uses and loves Ubuntu.\" There's precedent for this as well. Just off the top of my head, I know that the UK LoCo Team's podcast has sponsorship.

Is babl not installed properly? If yes, How do I rectify it? Is the path improper? Where should a 'package' be installed to be findable?\n\nA: It looks like you need to adjust your PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable so the configure script can properly resolve the location of the babl library that you installed in the previous step.\nYou can do so in two ways:\nexport PKG_CONFIG_PATH=\"$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/opt/gimp-2.7/lib/pkgconfig/\"\n\nwhich will take the current value of PKG_CONFIG_PATH and append /opt/gimp-2.7/lib/pkgconfig/ to it.\nWhen using export the value of PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable will persist during single terminal session. Once the command above is run you can invoke configure script as normal:\n./configure --prefix=/opt/gimp-2.7\n\nAnother way to achieve the same end result would be to invoke the configure script as below:\nPKG_CONFIG_PATH=\"$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/opt/gimp-2.7/lib/pkgconfig/\" ./configure --prefix=/opt/gimp-2.7\n\nWhen invoked in this way the value of the PKG_CONFIG_PATH will only be modified for the time of execution of the configure script.\n", "Q: SSSD + Encrypted /home, no longer automounts at login I've switched a few boxes over to SSSD, so they now authenticate against a central LDAP server, and cache the credentials when I'm offline. This works fine, and the Ubuntu packages installed fine.\nBut now when I login, my home directory is no longer auto-decrypted/mounted. If I drop out of GDM and login at the console, I'm presented with this error:\nkeyctl_seach Required key not avaliable\n\nIf I run the suggested command (ecryptfs-mount-private) and give that my password, my home directory is unlocked fine.\nI'm trying to understand how the login process has changed, such that my password is no longer unlocking the encryption key automatically. I figure it's a PAM issue, so I've included my /etc/pam.d/common-auth file below.\nI presume the password is being passed to SSSD, then skipping whatever step is usual done to unlock the key. Can someone explain how that's usual done?\nauth    [success=3 default=ignore]  pam_sss.so\nauth    [success=2 default=ignore]  pam_unix.so nullok_secure try_first_pass\nauth    [success=1 default=ignore]  pam_winbind.so krb5_auth krb5_ccache_type=FILE cached_login try_first_pass\n\nauth    requisite           pam_deny.so\nauth    required            pam_permit.so\nauth    optional            pam_ecryptfs.so unwrap\n\n\nUPDATE 1:\nauth.log is reporting this error when a user logs in:\nlogin[14202]: NULL passphrase; aborting\n\nA google only turns up this error in the source of pam_ecryptfs.so, and is triggered when \nthe recieved PAM_AUTHTOK is NULL:\nrc = pam_get_item(pamh, PAM_AUTHTOK, (const void **)&passphrase);\n[...]\nif (passphrase == NULL) {\n    [...]\n    syslog(LOG_ERR, \"NULL passphrase; aborting\\n\");\n    [...]\n}\n\nSo as least pam_ecryptfs.so is being called (i.e. it's not that it's being skipped because SSSD is in place). However why is it getting a NULL passphrase?\n\nUPDATE 2:\nNow I've learnt more about PAM, I've updated the post with a copy of my common-auth file, since that's the one being used at login (not common-password)\n\nA: Turns out the answer was in the documentation! I just needed to first figure out what the problem was, and then go back checking each element of the setup:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/natty/man8/pam_sss.8.html\nAdding the option \"forward_pass\" to pam_sss.so tells the SSSD module to put the entered passphrase on the stack, so that other modules (i.e. pam_ecryptfs.so) can use the information.\nSo my ecryptfs + SSSD enabled /etc/pam.d/common-auth file looks like this:\nauth    [success=3 default=ignore]  pam_sss.so forward_pass\nauth    [success=2 default=ignore]  pam_unix.so nullok_secure try_first_pass\nauth    [success=1 default=ignore]  pam_winbind.so krb5_auth krb5_ccache_type=FILE cached_login try_first_pass\n\nauth    requisite   pam_deny.so\nauth    required    pam_permit.so\nauth    optional    pam_ecryptfs.so unwrap\n\nNote: having the word \"debug\" at the end of the pam_ecryptfs.so line also broke things!\nI've certainly learnt a lot about PAM, ecryptfs and gnome-keyring today!

I am living in Lebanon where it is rare to find an Ubuntu CD to buy, let alone find someone capable of installing it.\nI want to download Ubuntu and install it by myself, but I don't want to dual boot because I don't have a powerful computer.  I have used Ubuntu on my VPS, but never on desktop before. I would like to know if Ubuntu can be downloaded and installed on an XP Pro then remove XP Pro.\nCan anyone guide me through the process?\n\nA: First of all use the live CD to boot into an UBUNTU live session (do not install). Then you can save all your music and ebooks as you can access the windows partition. If you now want to install UBUNTU you can choose to use the whole disk for the install thus windows will be deleted and UBUNTU installed. \n\nA: You can do the following, if you dont have access to another machine. \n\n\n*\n\n*Reinstall any OS\n\n*Download and burn Ubuntu\n\n*Install Ubuntu from the Cd, while doing this format the drives.\n\n\nI also believe afaik they still mail copies of Ubuntu if you ask for them, I am not sure if they will ship to Lebanon though. \n", "Q: There is a crackling sound each time I mute or unmute the sound Sound otherwise is fine but there is a crackling sound when I mute or unmute the sound, also when a video player stops or starts playing a movie, or when any application using sound stops or starts - there is always this annoying crackling sound, how do I fix it?\n\nA: There is something in your audio chain that is incorrectly (de)activated when sounds starts or stops, you should try to reinstall the audio related drivers as well as programs like ALSA.

I have a old intel o4 machine without graphics card. Still now I'm running Ubuntu 8.04 I would like to install Ubuntu 11.4 version. Would that require graphics card support?\n\nA: By \"graphics card\" you probably mean \"discrete graphics card\" as opposed to \"integrated graphics card\". There is no requirement at all to have discrete one. \n\nA: Answer: Depends.\nYou can run the Classic Ubuntu Session at the very least - you might not be able to run Unity, the new desktop interface. To find out if it can, please take a look at this question - How do I know if my video card can run Unity? - it'll have to answers that you seek.\n\nA: Although I haven't tried to do the install without a graphics card, I've run several machines where I used the serial port as main terminal. Lately I configure my virtual machines (that use KVM) in such a way that I can use the virtual serial port to connect to them in case of emergency (like a network failure). This works fine. \nThis question points to some help for headless installs.\nI assume here that you're going to use the system as a headless server. Correct? In that case you needn't worry about the Unity interface etc. \nOr do you want to run desktop applications through SSH? In that case I totally depends on the CPU power and RAM of the machine you're talking about.\n", "Q: Screen flickers in response to P, can't bind it to anything I'm running Ubuntu 11.04 on ThinkPad Edge 11\" and no matter what X session or wm I use, P makes widgets blank out for a fraction of a second.

Everything I tried to open was white.  Even the shutdown menu.\nWhat causes this and how can I fix it?\n\nA: Sounds like it might be an issue with compiz. Try pressing Alt+F2 and then type compiz --replace. \n\nA: I had this problem with an embedded nvidia GPU on the motherboard. (A GeForce 6150SE component as part of the nForce 430 chipset).\nOpening nvidia-settings, I noted that the driver was convinced that the card had 256MB of RAM even though the RAM was shared system RAM, and the BIOS had it set to 64MB.\nSetting the BIOS allocation of RAM to 256MB rectified the problem with white windows, as in, recipes that previously reliably produced white windows no longer did so.\nHowever, the graphics performance is now a little sluggish, with operations like dragging windows and switching workspaces eliciting pauses.\nWhile your problem appears to be with Natty, this was on Oneiric.\n", "Q: Touchsreen always returns cursor to upper left corner Just installed Ubuntu 11.04 on a brand new Fujitsu Lifebook T901.

Is there someway to make it turn into the resize function in a larger area?\n\nA: It depends on the theme used. You could change your theme, or edit the theme if you really wanted to, but an easier and more consistent way is to hold down Alt and drag with the middle mouse button. You can imagine it as slicing the window into a 3x3 grid, and clicking in any rectangle but the center one will allow you to drag the appropriate side or corner.\nNote that Alt + MiddleButton is the default configuration. To change it (at least in Compiz):\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System -> Preferences -> CompizConfig Settings Manager if running classic Gnome, or search for CompizConfig Settings Manager in the Dash if running Unity.\n\n*Find the Resize Window plugin; it's under Window Management.\n\n*Open it and go to the Bindings tab if you aren't already there.\n\n\nThe last two settings are called Initiate Window Resize.

As in the topic: I would like to remove files in a directory that have been modified in a particular date range. How can I do this ? \n\nA: The command GNU find is the way to go. For example, to delete all files in the current directory between 1 and 5 august, you can use the following command\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type f -newermt 2011-08-01 ! -newermt 2011-08-06 -delete\n\nIt is better to execute the command without the -delete action, first, to see the listing of interested files (a good substitute could be -ls that produce an ls-like listing).\nRemoving the -maxdepth 1 specification will traverse all subdirectories, too.\nYou can also specify hours, for example\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type f -newermt '2011-08-01 10:01:59' \\\n                         ! -newermt '2011-08-06 23:01:00' -delete\n\nBe warned to not remove single quotes, that protect spaces between date and time.\nThe character ! is a negation, it should be read: newer that this date but not newer that this other date. \n", "Q: Sound notification over SSH I just switched from the Konversation IRC client to the terminal based IRSSI. I'm starting IRSSI on a remote machine using GNU screen + SSH. I do not get any sound notification on new messages, which means that I've to check out IRSSI once in a while for new messages.\nThat's not really productive, so I'm looking for an application / script that plays a sound (preferably /usr/share/sounds/KDE-Im-Irc-Event.ogg and not the annoying beep) on my machine if there is any activity. It would be great if I can disable the notification for certain channels.\nOr, if that's not possible, some sort of notification via libnotify, thus making it available to GNOME and KDE.\n\nA: I do this with libnotify.

I have Testdisk in /home/monkey(my user name)/testdisk-6.12\n\n\nA: In nautilus filemanager, when you right click testdisk_static select Properties. In the Property dialogue, that comes up go to the tab Permissions there check the box that says Allow executing file as program. Once you have done that, you can double click on testdisk_static in nautilus and tell it to run the program if testdisk as a graphical user interface.\n\nIf it has no GUI, you will have to run it in shell. You can do the following:\ncd PathToTestDisk         # go to direcotry testdisk is located\nchmod +x testdisk_static  # allow for the binaries to be executed\n./testdisk_static         # execute program\n\nEdit your question with the exact problem if that doesn't work.\nIf you want testdisk to show up as a regular shell command you can create a symbolic link in /usr/local/bin like this:\nln -s /Path/To/Test/Disk/testdisk_static /usr/local/bin/testdisk\n\nIn order for this to work, you must use absolute paths on the first argument.\n", "Q: Uninstall Enlightenment E16 on Ubuntu 10.04 How can I uninstall e16 from Ubuntu 10.04\nI have Gnome and KDE installed too, which i want to keep\nThanks\n\nA: Supposing you have used the Ubuntu Software Center, you can go there and uninstall by clicking at \"Remove\" button.  \nElse you can open a terminal and paste: sudo apt-get purge e16\n", "Q: Why is my Laptop shutting down when playing The Sims 3? Whenever I try to play The Sims 3 using Wine 1.2 in Ubuntu Natty the Acer Aspire 4935G is just shutting down without any warning. According to appdb.winehq.org The Sims 3 should work almost perfectly fine (Gold status) on Ubuntu and as long as the laptop does not turn off everything does work fine. \nI also tried different graphics drivers but NVIDIA current worked best for the GeForce 9300M GS. When the laptop is shutting down while I'm playing The Sims 3 I found the following messages (amongst others) in jokey.log:\n2011-08-14 10:52:28,537 DEBUG: nvidia.available: falling back to default\n2011-08-14 10:52:28,745 DEBUG: nvidia_173 is not the alternative in use\n2011-08-14 10:52:31,054 DEBUG: nvidia_173 is not the alternative in use\n2011-08-14 10:52:31,113 DEBUG: nvidia_173 is not the alternative in use\n2011-08-14 10:52:40,779 DEBUG: Shutting down\n\nI couldn't find any errors in kern.log, Xorg.0.log or syslog.

Maybe the laptop is overheating? How can I check if this is the case?\n\nA: Your computer is most likely shutting down unexpectedly because either the kernel or BIOS thinks it's in imminent danger, usually due to overheating issues.  There may be a faulty driver, or perhaps you have a broken fan but don't notice the heat buildup unless you tax the system by running Wine.  There could be another sort of cooling problem as well, such as a lack of (or too much) thermal paste.\nWhile Wine's the proximate cause here, this isn't really Wine's fault - it's exposing a deeper problem in the system.\n", "Q: What is the difference between 'su -' , 'sudo bash' and 'sudo sh'? I would like to know what is the difference between \n\n\n*\n\n*su -\n\n*sudo bash\n\n*sudo sh\nI cannot login as root while doing su - because I do not have the root password - I mean I have my user password with which I can sudo \"command\"  but this password does not work for su -\nI can log in as root with sudo bash with my user password and I can login while doing sudo sh but then I get a command prompt in this form\n# \n\nA: su -:\nThis will change your user identifier and inherit the environment variables as if you had logged in with that user.  Normally you would use the format su - <userid> to login as the user .  If you drop the \"userid\" it assumes you are trying to login as root - which you can't (unless you change the root password).\nsudo bash & sudo sh:\nAnything  after the sudo is a program to run - so in these cases you are asking to run a couple of shells - bash and dash respectively. use man bash and man sh for more details on the different shells. \n\nRelated Questions: \n\n\n*\n\n* How to know my root password?\n\n* What Linux shell should I use?\n\nA: Background \nIn Linux (and Unix in general), there is a SuperUser named Root. The SuperUser can do anything and everything, and thus doing daily work as the SuperUser can be dangerous. You could type a command incorrectly and destroy the system. Ideally, you run as a user that has only the privileges needed for the task at hand. In some cases, this is necessarily Root, but most of the time it is a regular user.  \nsu - \nThis command is used to login at root account.\nBy default, the Root account password is locked in Ubuntu. This means that you cannot login as Root directly or use the su command to become the Root user. However, since the Root account physically exists it is still possible to run programs with root-level privileges. This is where sudo comes in - it allows authorized users (normally \"Administrative\" users) to run certain programs as Root without having to know the root password.  \nSee How to Enable Root Account.  \nsudo sh \nThis command runs \"sh\" as a super user.\nThe sh utility is a command language interpreter that shall execute commands read from a command line string, the standard input, or a specified file.\nsudo bash \nThis command runs \"bash\" as a super user.\nBash is the shell, or command language interpreter. Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh). It is intended to conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard. It offers functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive use. In addition, most sh scripts can be run by Bash without modification.  \nReferences: 1, 2, 3.\n", "Q: After deleting files I do not get any more space on my hard drive and files are not in trash I am deleting files from my filesystem because I am running out of space but I do not get any more free space after deleting them.

But, how could this happen?\nupdate===========\n@con-f-use: I've used a thumb drive named \"Install Ubuntu\" to install ubuntu, BIOS Version: 53CN14WW.\n@CYREX, @jo-erlend: Yeah, it looks really cool ;) I'm wondering if this could happen on another laptop\n@Col: I've pulled out all the USBs while taking those images.\n@James Henstridge: I don't know if it's a EFI BIOS, how to distinguish?\n\nupdate===========\nIs there any test that i can run to figure out if it's a uefi/efi bios?\n\nA: What you see is the a UEFI BIOS. Unlike the legacy BIOS, there's MBR where the bootloaders always try to overwrite each other. Instead, bootloaders are installed in the form:\n<EFI system partition>/efi/{vendor}/{file}.efi\n\nThe EFI partition is a small, FAT32 formatted partition usually located at the beginning of the hard drive. It stores the bootloaders for all the UEFI compatible operating systems you have installed.\nOnce a UEFI compatible operating system is installed, it copies the bootloader to the EFI partition and creates an entry in the NVRAM which points to the bootloader. In your case, ubuntu points to \n<EFI system partition>/efi/ubuntu/grubx64.efi\n\nWindows, for example, creates an entry called \"Windows Boot Manager\" pointing to\n<EFI system partition>/efi/microsoft/bootmgrw.efi\n\n\nSo, with a UEFI BIOS, you can use its boot menu to select your operating systems, set the default operating system to boot, etc.\n\nAlso, Ubuntu 11.04's installer has a bug where it will reformat your EFI partition. So, if you have Windows installed, it will no longer boot. You'll have to install Ubuntu first, then Windows.\nEDIT: One more thing :) If you want Windows to show up in the boot menu, you have to boot the install DVD in UEFI mode. There should be an option for that if you look in your BIOS settings.\nHope this helps\n\nA: Had the same Problem with a Phoenix SecureCore Tiano bios. To remove it I selected the ubuntu entry and pressed DEL a small x appeared at it's left. After saving and rebooting it was gone.\n\nA: When you access the BIOS/UEFI you have the option for Fast Boot or Legacy setup for your system. You can turn off Fast Boot and select Boot Order, and in the Boot Order is the Ubuntu option. The system will use whatever you set; Fast Boot is UEFI. You should encounter a big red warming window telling you that you could screw up your system if you make the wrong choices in that section; proceed with caution.\nI encountered the Ububtu bug the last time I tried to replace Windows. Ubuntu displayed an error when trying to partition the disk, and Windows immediately LOCKED the drive so nothing could be changed. I had a nice expensive brick then. When Ubuntu gets serious about itself, they will provide an installer that does all that stuff correctly and renders itself useful. Until then, run it from a virtual environment.\n", "Q: Is GNOME-DO Themeable? I was wondering if Gnome DO is themable, besides the 5 pre-installed themes..

Have anyone tried to change the source code in order to change the theme?\n\nA: It's entirely possible to add themes to Do, but it does require coding, although it's pretty simple.  It'd be technically feasible to write a theme which loaded SVGs, which could then provide easily-installable themes.\nI'm not particularly interested in doing that in the immediate future - I find the existing themes sufficient, and there are problems I'm more interested in fixing - but I'd be happy to review a merge request.  To do that, you'd make a branch of Do's source code, make your changes, push that branch up to launchpad, and then request a merge into trunk with bzr lp-propose lp:do.\nYou're welcome to hop on to #gnome-do on freenode, too.  It's fairly quiet, so if you ask a question don't be surprised if it takes a while for someone to get back to you :).\nDo's not dead - I've made two releases this year already, and have some core enhancements nearly ready to merge.\n\nA: To my knowledge, GNOME Do can be user themed, but you will probably not find any themes floating around, or any documentation, because GNOME Do has been replaced (for several months now) by Synapse* and Docky, both of which can be themed.\n*See also this wiki.\n\nFrom by GNOME Do's maintainer: Do's not dead :).  Synapse is a fine project, but I (obviously!) think that there's still stuff Do does better.\n\n", "Q: /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo missing i wanted to install and use asus_switcheroo but unfortunately the vgaswitcheroo folder is missing.\nI already checked whether vgaswitcheroo is actually enabled and as i use the vanilla kernel it is (2.6.38-11-generic). \n[EDIT]\nAfter looking a bit further into it it seems to help some people to enable kms on intel and radeon drivers to have the folder.

I found a solution: deactivate all proprietary drivers of your graphic card and then reboot. After that, the folder reappeared onto \"/sys/kernel/debug\".

In my case other reasons were these;\n\n\n*\n\n*I was powering down my discrete gpu on boot, so it wasn't even getting detected.

I am looking for a way to retrieve a single file from the Data partition. It is a *.odt file with mainly text in a table in it.\nSo far I tried to use photorec and tried to find some keywords of that file with grep but without any success. Some files are reproduced but not the one I am looking for.\nIs there a way to grep though the partition to look for some key words? Or are there other tools more suitable to retrieve the data?\n\nA: Depending on the size and fragmentation of the lost file it could be possible to recover it, as when a partition is formatted, a tiny fraction of the available space is actually overwritten.\nUse photorec and\n\n\n*\n\n*choose the same partition the file was on\n\n*select File Opt and check to look for zip files (*.odt files are in fact zip files)\n\n*choose Whole to analyze all data, not just \"unallocated\" data\n\n\nThen you will be presented with all zip files photorec has found. There is no way to grep the files directly as they are compressed, but you can use zipgrep as shown below. Or, as no filenames will be retrieved, you'll have to open each one and check.\nTo automate the search change directory to the retrieved files use zipgrep to find a word or a pattern, for example like this (it will show all files with the pattern pattern in them):\ncd retrieved_files\nfor F in *; do zipgrep -q pattern \"$F\" && echo $F; done\n\n\nA: The guide to data recovery in Ubuntu's community documentation is an excellent resource. As it explains, you can attempt to recover partitions with parted, testdisk, or gpart. If that is not successful, you can use other methods to try to recovery individual files from the drive. These other methods are also explained in that guide.\nAny changes to your partition table--including the creation of new partitions--are unlikely to overwrite the actual data in your files. So, assuming that is the only change that has been made, your files should be fully recoverable (perhaps with some effort).\n\nA: Try using testdisk under ubuntu, this can both restore the partition table and recover lost files.\nThe command to use in terminal is : sudo apt-get install testdisk\n", "Q: Ubuntu One's iPhone music app does not cache songs.

I synced my music folder with Ubuntu One and all my music is appearing in the app. However, after playing several hours of music, the app did not cache any song to play offline. Is there a way to set how many songs are cached? When are the songs cached?\n\nA: In the current version, songs are only cached manually.  You can cache a song for offline play by tapping the circle button to the right of the song in the list.

When I create a launcher item for jvisualvm according to the regular procedure described here, it does not behave as expected.

In Ubuntu, there used to be a keyboard preference which makes the numpad more sane, it was called something like \"Make Shift+NumPad work like Windows\".\nThe problem this options solves is, that when you press NumPad 7, it acts like the \"Home\" key, which is all fine, but if you press Shift+NumPad 7, it acts like the \"7\" key, which is not fine because I'm on a laptop and the regular \"Home\" key requires me to pull of an anatomically insane move. Anyways, this option made Shift+NumPad 7 act like the \"Home\" key.\nI can't find that option under XUbuntu. How do I set it?\nUpdate: GUI or command line, doesn't matter.\n\nA: After some grepping I found the solution: You need to add the numpad:microsoft option to the XkbOptions. On older Ubuntus, do that in your xorg.conf. On newer ones open the file /etc/default/keyboard and change this line:\nXKBOPTIONS=\"\"\n\nto\nXKBOPTIONS=\"numpad:microsoft\"\n\nSave and reboot (restarting X doesn't seem to work, at least not with RAlt+PrintScreen+K). You may need to run sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration for changes to take effect.\n\nA: For uBuntu 18.04, another options is to use Dconf-Editor, a powerful GUI for most uBuntu settings. If not installed, open Terminal and type:\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get update\n\n*apt-get install dconf-editor -y\nOpen dconf Editor, then /org/gnome/desktop/input-sources/xkb-options.\nOn a fresh uBuntu installation, Custom value will be blank. Turn Use default value OFF then:\n\n\n*\n\n*insert ['numpad:microsoft'] (if blank) or\n\n*append , 'numpad:microsoft' (after whatever is there, if not blank)\n\n\nFor example, ['caps:none', 'numpad:microsoft'] which both disables Caps Lock and uses the NumPad as in Windows. Close dconf Editor, no reboot required.\n\nA: I had a similar problem on lubuntu.  I tried changing the /etc/default/keyboard file, but it didn't help.\nI think the reason might be that I had Layout changer on my system.  However, adding numpad:microsoft in the \"Advanced setxkbmap Options\" field in the options of the Keyboard Layout Handler actually worked.  I didn't even have to reboot the X.\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04 have no more \"Miscellaneous compatibility options\" in the keyboard settings. Editing /etc/default/keyboard also is not a working solution. But dconf database contains the required options with key /org/gnome/desktop/input-sources/xkb-options. This options should be completed with numpad:microsoft to something like ['grp:alt_shift_toggle', 'grp_led:scroll', 'numpad:microsoft'] manually in dconf-editor or using  this script:\n# !/bin/bash\nold=`gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options`\nnew=`echo $old | sed \"s/'numpad:microsoft'//g\" | sed -r \"s/(, )+/, /g\" | sed -r \"s/(, )?]/, 'numpad:microsoft']/\"`\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options \"$new\"\n\n\nA: In Xubuntu 16.04 the XKBOPTIONS setting ( XKBOPTIONS=\"numpad:microsoft\" ) in /etc/default/keyboard is ignored - I consider this to be a bug.\nI'm using the following command as workaround:\nsetxkbmap -option 'numpad:microsoft'\nIn order to run the above command automatically when starting the graphical\ndesktop environment, I've create an Application Autostart entry:\nMenu > Settings > Session and Startup > Application Autostart > Add\n\n          Name: Make Shift+NumPad work like MS Windows\n  Description: whatsoever\n     Command:setxkbmap -option 'numpad:microsoft'\n\n\nA: Glad I found your post. Using Natty Narwhal, I found a similar option in the Keyboard settings.\n\n\n*\n\n*Search for Keyboard\n\n*Click Layouts tab\n\n*Click Options button\n\n*Expand miscellaneous compatibility options\n\n*Check \"Shift with numeric keypad keys works as in MS Windows\"\n\n*Close and you're good!\n\n\nA: On Ubuntu 19.10, you can get this functionality by installing gnome-tweak-tool, then opening it, going to Keyboard & Mouse -> Additional Layout Options then expanding Miscellaneous compatibility options and checking Num Lock on: digits; Shift for arrow keys, Num Lock off: arrow keys (as in Windows), as shown here:\n\nThe changes take effect immediately.  It seems to change the same setting as the answer by @AlainD\n\nA: Kubuntu 20.04 also has Miscellaneous compatibility options menu! So, you can fix numlock and shift+home / shift+end issue.\n\n\nA: Running Ubuntu 20.04 in Virtual Box on a Windows host, I needed to turn on these options in Tweaks to get shift- and control-shift- keys to work in Windows style.\n\n*\n\n*Tweaks > Keyboard & Mouse > Additional Layout Options > Miscellaneous compatibility options > Shift does not cancel Num Lock, chooses 3rd level instead\n\n*Tweaks > Keyboard & Mouse > Additional Layout Options > Layout of Numeric Keypad > Wang 724 keypad with unicode additions (arrows and math operators; math operators on default level)\n\nFor example, in a text editor with NumLock on, this allows ctrl-shift-numpad4 to move left to the start of a word while selecting the word.\n\nA: For me 'keypad:pointerkeys' option helped on Lubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver\n", "Q: Is there a CD Ripper compatible with Creative Zen MX? I have a Creative Zen MX MP3 Player, and whenever I rip a CD in Banshee media player and then transfer the files over to my player, the metadata seems to not be there, or not displaying (E.G. No album art, no artist, no track title; just displays filename.) I have \"Write metadata to files\" ticked in the preferences but it still doesn't show up.

I use vim a lot and it occurs to me that most of the time I don't even really need a GUI, since I'll only use my computer to take notes in VIM. The problem is, though, is that colors don't show up correctly on tty (i.e. when I press Ctrl+Alt+F1, F2, etc). I found a plugin for VIM that makes colors work better with terminals that usually work with GVIM, and that's made them work in, say, gnome-terminal, but not in TTY. \nThis post seems to suggest that I'd have to recompile the whole kernel to get this to work. Is there an easier way? Can it be done? \n\nA: Are you asking about how to get 256 colour support in Linux console ttys?  As the post you've linked to says, you'd need to modify your kernel to do that (and the modifications you'd need have not been written: it isn't just a matter of changing the config).  Without modification, you'll have to make do with the standard 16 colours on the console.\nAn alternative would be to switch to a different terminal emulator.  One option is fbterm, which has been packaged on Ubuntu under the same name.  It is a terminal emulator that can run directly against the Linux frame buffer device.\nIf you are just after a full screen terminal emulator, another option would be to just use the standard GNOME terminal emulator and hit F11.\n", "Q: Why did Thunderbird replace Evolution in 11.10? According to this, The default email client for Ubuntu 11.10 will be Thunderbird instead of Evolution. I've used Evolution since Ubuntu 9.10; I've always used the default applications because I thought they were recommended.  \nWhy is Thunderbird the new default email client instead of Evolution?\n\nA: Both Evolution and Thunderbird are great applications. The fact that Ubuntu will switch to Thunderbird as a default mail client, should not be considered as a discouragement from using Evolution. It'll be just as available, easily installable and well supported. \nBut setting up an email account is much easier with Thunderbird and that's important. It's also easier to use in many ways. And I've been an Evo-freak and spent several years living in it, so to speak, but I really love Thunderbird as an email client. It has some features Evo just can't compete with, in my humble opinion. \nAnother thing is that Thunderbird is also well supported on Windows and since we're now getting Ubuntu One support on Windows, I think it'll be nice to be able to sync contact data and bookmarks with both operating systems (and others in the future). For people who dual boot, for instance, this is magnificent. They'll just install LibreOffice, Firefox and Thunderbird in Windows, along with Ubuntu One, of course and then they can just reboot and still have their files, tools and other data just as available. The same goes for people who take their work home, such as students or office workers. Interoperability is key if Ubuntu is going to really hit the masses, and using Thunderbird as default helps in that regard as well as making Ubuntu easier to use. \n\nA: Here's a list of pro's and cons on deciding to change to Thunderbird: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-o-default-email-client\nEvolution pro's:\n\n\n*\n\n*Good integration with the desktop already (eg, messaging menu and appmenu)\n\n*Integrated with existing translation infrastructure for developers in launchpad\n\n*Calendaring functionality by default, and integrated with the desktop\n\n*Support for syncing contacts with U1\n\n*Contacts sync with GMail\n\n*GNOME release process is better aligned with our 6 month cycle\n\n*Exchange support (no idea how well this works, but it exists)\n\n\nEvolution con's:\n\n\n*\n\n*Outdated and confusing UI\n\n*Historically has been fairly slow and unstable (although it is better now)\n\n*UI is pretty bad on netbooks and other small form-factor devices\n\n*I'm not convinced that Evolutions additional features are that important to our target users\n\n\nThunderbird pro's:\n\n\n*\n\n*Responsive and more active upstream\n\n*Familiar brand for users moving from other operating systems, which has the same benefits as shipping Firefox\n\n*Lots and lots of extensions, and a very rich extension framework\n\n*Initial account setup is so much more intuitive\n\n*I like the tabbed interface ;)\n\n\nThunderbird con's:\n\n\n*\n\n*Translations not integrated with Launchpad (we have the same issue with Firefox though)\n\n*Integration with the desktop lacking (no messaging menu or appmenu)\n\n*No exchange support (not true for lightning: there is a working lightning data provider, http://gitorious.org/lightning-exchange-provider/pages/Home )\n\n*Calendaring support is only available via an addon (Lightning), and is not integrated with the panel clock\n\n*No GMail or U1 contact sync (although GMail contact support is available via an addon)\n\n\nAnd adding all up the result is in favor of Thunderbird it seems.\nHere is the the pdf 'Thunderbird & Evolution User research findings' on which they based the conclusion to change.\nOn canonical Thunderbird & Evolution Usability Testing \n\nA: Re: Calendar\nWhile ReminderFox as add on isn't integrated either, it still works fine enough for the few calendar uses I have in Thunderbird.\nRe: Evolution vs. Thunderbird \nI think it's all a question of preference. Personally, I'd always choose Thunderbird, wheather in linux or windows. I don't like Evolution as I found it too clunky and reminded me far too much of Outlook which I somewhat detest.\n\nA: Canonical did a usability testing between both email clients to see which is more friendly to the user. Results can be seen at Canonical’s design blog.\n\nA: I have found exchange support for Thunderbird with this extension: https://exquilla.zendesk.com/home \nIt works really good (download from that place is newer than the addon in mozilla addons website). \nWorks much more better than evolution's support. \nIt has some notes to keep in mind. \nhttps://exquilla.zendesk.com/entries/20887131-creating-an-exchange-account \n", "Q: Disable Auto-start Application I couple of versions of Ubuntu ago I setup a program to start automatically when the computer turns on.

I followed the procedure at ubuntu wiki \"GitKernelBuild\" page.\nIn short, download the tar.bz2, extract, copy my old config, make oldconfig, and then\nfakeroot make-kpkg --initrd --append-to-version=-custom kernel_image kernel_headers\n\nAll went fine, I am using this kernel right now, except one little thing: I cannot build other modules, build dkms etc. Further info follows:\nThe produced deb files are two:\nlinux-image-2.6.39.4-custom_2.6.39.4-custom-10.00.Custom_amd64.deb\nlinux-headers-2.6.39.4-custom_2.6.39.4-custom-10.00.Custom_amd64.deb\n\nI am a bit confused by this.\nIn normal ubuntu kernels, even those in mainline-ppa, there are three deb files that are installed. For example, for the same kernel from the mainline ppa there exist these packages:\nlinux-image-2.6.39-02063904-generic_2.6.39-02063904.201108040905_amd64.deb\nlinux-headers-2.6.39-02063904-generic_2.6.39-02063904.201108040905_amd64.deb\nlinux-headers-2.6.39-02063904_2.6.39-02063904.201108040905_all.deb\n\nAs you can see, there are two different header packages. Indeed, after installing them, the mainline ppa packages create a directory under /lib/modules:\n/lib/modules/2.6.39-02063904-generic\n\nIn that directory, a symlink exists which points to the -generic headers under /usr/src\n/lib/modules/2.6.39-02063904-generic/build -> /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.39-02063904-generic\n\nUnder /usr/src, two different directories exist for this kernel\n/usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.39-02063904-generic\n/usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.39-02063904\n\nNow, here is the problem with my own two packages:\nIn /usr/src there is just one folder, \n/usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.39.4-custom\n\nAnd under /lib/modules, there is a folder\n/lib/modules/linux-headers-2.6.39.4-custom\n\nThe real issue, and the reason I am writing this post is this symlink that gets created in the above directory:\n/lib/modules/linux-headers-2.6.39.4-custom/build -> /home/nickped/projects/kernel/linux-2.6.39.4\n\nAs you can see, it links back to the directory where I built the kernel - which of course might not exist afterwards. This causes other modules (for example vmware, virtualbox etc) to fail to built, as it can't find important things.\nWhy does this happen? How can it be fixed? Why there are two and not three deb files produced? What is the purpose of those 3 different deb files that official releases have, and how can they be created by others?\n\nA: To answer the first question Why are there only two packages? or Why aren't there two header files? -- when they're cross compiled, they're packaged up to handle every use case. By splitting the headers into a larger all package and a smaller arch-specific one, you save bandwidth pushing them out to users. When you're doing it yourself, you only need it for one arch so one headers file will do.\nAs for the symlink through to your source location, I have had the same issue. I have not found a good fix other than to also generate a linux_source package (just add that on after kernel_image kernel_headers) and then fix the symlink manually.\nThere is actually a question all about this side of things already. The long-term solution seems to be hacking in a script that runs after each kernel installation that just fixes the symink up.\n", "Q: CPAN vs. APT: Conflicts in versions? I can't find the answer to this anywhere: Does a module installed via APT conflict with one installed via CPAN?\nAlong with that question are these: Where do the installed CPAN modules live? Are they accessible globally or just to the installing user? How do you know which one? How do you know what's installed and which takes precedence?\nShould CPAN even be used when modules are installed via APT?\n\nA: On Debian and Ubuntu CPAN (/usr/bin/cpan utility) installs modules into /usr/local/lib/ by default. And debian packages keep their files in /usr/share/perl5/ and /usr/lib/perl5/. So files installed via /usr/bin/cpan won't overwrite files installed via apt.\nThere's nothing wrong with using system perl, and mixing apt and cpan code will generally work.\nYou can also choose to package any cpan distribution not available in your apt repositories manually. It's easy with the help of dh-make-perl tool:\ndh-make-perl --cpan Some::Module && cd Some-Module* && sudo debi\n\n\nA: I use perlbrew.  It installs a local version of Perl and cpan.  Everything it does is done in your home directory.  It's straight forward to install and use and you can install the latest version of Perl.\n\nA: When installing from CPAN directly I would recommend using local::lib to a directory private to you.\nSee the boostrapping technique https://metacpan.org/module/local::lib \nThat way the CPAN installed module will be only used by your user and it will have a very clean separation from the modules installed using APT.\nIt will also make it easy to get rid of the CPAN-installed modules if you encounter any issue or when you upgrade Ubuntu.\nThat's how I use it on Ubuntu.\n\nA: You can use both but they will conflict. They're written to the same place so if you install something from apt and then install a later version from cpan, you could bodge things up.\nI don't do much Perl but in Python I certainly have the dilemma you're talking about: apt-vs-PyPI. I personally opt for apt whenever I can. It means I should get updates without having to remember to maintain each individual Python package. Not only that but it means that all my systems should be running on the same version of those packages.\nIt doesn't always work out. Sometimes you don't have new enough things in the repos or something you need just isn't packaged up. Neither way is perfect but I believe apt to be more perfect. Just be aware of what you're doing and you should be okay.\n\nEdit - Almost forgot, there is a better way to section things up so the system can have its own environment and whatever you're developing can live in its own environment (that you manage completely with CPAN), Like Python's virtualenv...\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/1423879/how-can-i-install-specialized-environments-for-different-perl-applications\n", "Q: How do I start the GUI (Window Manager?) over VNC?

How can I easily archive my gmail account emails in Evolution? I would like a solution easily as gmail archive. After lot of googling the only solution that I found is manually sending to the All Email Folder :/.\n\nA: Had trouble setting this up until I found this related question & answer \n\nOpen Evolution Preferences under the Edit menu. Under Mail Accounts click once on the account in question and click the Edit button on the right. This will open the Account Editor. Click on Defaults and you should see there under Special Folders a setting for the Archive Folder which may be unset. Click the button to choose a folder to archive messages to. Now CtrlAltA should archive an email.\n\nFor gmail, you'll want to use 'All Mail' as the 'Archive' folder.  You can do a similar thing with trash / spam - by default they map to the gmail trash/spam folders, but you can configure a folder to move them to.\n\nA: You can simply click 'delete' to remove an email from the Inbox. By default the email will still be available in the All Mail folder. If you really want to delete an email (something you probably don't do as often as 'archive'), drag that email to the Google Mail trash folder.\n\nA: In the Settings on the Gmail website, you can set it to archive deleted messages so whenever you delete a message it will be archived on Gmail's server.\nThe settings can be found in Gmail -> Settings -> Forward and POP/IMAP with the label When a message is marked as deleted and expunged from the last visible IMAP folder. Here is a picture of the settings, it's the 3rd section.\n\n\nA: Since October 2014, Evolution supports archiving. Archive action is available via the message menu (right-click on the message) and the default shortcut is Ctrl+Alt+A.\nFrom this post:\n\nArchive like Gmail does\nIf you use Evolution with a Gmail account, and you want the same functionality as the Gmail archive button, you can accomplish this by setting the Evolution archive folder to point to the Gmail “All Mail” folder, which will cause the Evolution archive action to behave as Gmail’s does.\nTo use this functionality (with or without Gmail), simply select the messages you want to move, and click the “Archive…” button:\nThis is also available via the “Message” menu. You can also activate with the Control-Alt-a shortcut.\n\n\nA: I believe the issue you are having is related to the POP protocol.  You may want to check into IMAP:\nhttp://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en-GB&ctx=mail&answer=75725\nI don't know if IMAP, works as well as POP via Evolution, but I don't see a reason it shouldn't.  The main thing that you need to make clear is whether or not you want your Evolution archive to directly correlate to your gmail account.\nBecause at the end of the day an archive is just a database.

I've spent three days reading manuals and forums and think I've done everything right, but keep getting the same error. Any tips to get me on the right track are greatly appreciated!\n\nA: In short: you need to set up an address on interface eth1 before the DHCP can serve requests from it.\nLonger story: the DHCP server will read the configuration file, then match the subnet declarations with IP addresses currently assigned to interfaces.  Only interfaces whose IP address matches a subnet declaration will serve requests for that subnet.  Hence, you need to set up eth1 with an address in the 192.168.0.0/24 range, if you want the ISC DHCP server to serve requests for 192.168.0.0/24 from it.\n\nA: Below worked for me in Ubuntu 12.04\napt-get remove --purge dhcp3-server\nsudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server\n\nGo to /etc/dhcp. create a new file \"dhcp.conf\"\nBefore that keep a backup of existing \"dhcp.conf\" file\nAdd the below details to new dhcp.conf file\n# Sample /etc/dhcpd.conf\ndefault-lease-time 600;\nmax-lease-time 7200;\noption subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;\noption broadcast-address 192.168.1.255;\noption routers 192.168.1.254;\noption domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2;\noption domain-name \"mydomain.example\";\nsubnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {\n    range 192.168.1.10 192.168.1.100;\n    range 192.168.1.150 192.168.1.200;\n} \n\nNow go to /etc/defaults/isc-dhcp-server and add your interface name to the file isc-dhcp-server\nModify the /etc/network/interfaces file with your server static details as similar to below\nauto eth1\niface inet eth1 static\n    address 192.168.1.149\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    gateway 192.168.1.255\n    dns-nameservers 192.168.1.1\n\nAfter this run sudo /etc/init.d/isc-dhcp-server restart and sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\nNote: Dont forget to install dhcp client in your client system. Also after installing dhcp-server in your server system, remove the system from the external network so that it will not harm other devices already in the network, other than the particular client you are interested in\nNow if you connect your client to the same network where your server is hosted, the client will acquire an ip with in the specified range\n\nA: Another way to start dhcp-server is possible using service utility.\nFor example:\n# sudo service isc-dhcp-server start\n\n", "Q: How to upgrade LibreOffice to 3.4.2 How to upgrade LibreOffice from 3.3.2 to 3.4.2 Final (2011-08-01) on 10.10\nI added the PPA\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa  \n\nand tried to  use update manager in system -> administration to upgrade it and could not find any package to upgrade.\n\nA: The libreoffice team have not updated their PPA with any newer version of libreoffice beyond 3.3.2 for maverick and natty.

To do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run the Live CD in the system with the drive giving problems.\n\n*Open a terminal.\n\n*Run sudo fdisk -l to find your Ubuntu partition and it's location (for example, /dev/sda5\n\n*Run sudo e2fsck -f /dev/<nameofyourpartition>.\n\n*Allow for any permissions problems to be fixed.\n\n*Reboot to the installed system, and the problem should be fixed.\n\n\nIf this does not work, then you can reinstall the gnome-power-manager package in Synaptic (sorry if that is the wrong name; search first before reinstalling).\n\nA: I have the same issue today. dpkg --configure -a didn't help at all or reinstall the power management package.

The problem was caused by doing a backup with rsync of my home directory and filling the partition to 100%. The solution was to: \n(1) boot from a disk to get a command line terminal up - in my case using GParted partition editor on a DVD. \n(2) create a temp directory that will be used to mount the full partition on. Use a command something like - sudo mkdir my_temp_dir. \n(3) Use this temp directory to mount the full partition that exists on the pc hard disk. Use command something like - sudo mount /dev/sda3 /home/user/my_temp_dir. That second argument is the location (in my case) of the partition that's full. GParted shows a helpful graphic to see what exists and the statuses of the hard disk partitions. \n(4) Change directories to the offending directory where the backups are stored. Use command something like cd /home/user/my_temp_dir/mybkups. \n(5) Using command ls -l convince yourself you know which directory to remove. (5) Remove the offending directory and the files it contains using command something like sudo rm -r my_large_dir. Caution required with this command - anything it removes isn't coming back - so be sure. \n(6) When that command has executed then exit out of command line terminal, close Gparted (or whatever you've used) and remove disk. \n(7) Boot as normal and Login should be possible.\n\nA: I have got the same error and could not login to my linux for several hours.\nSolution: \nWhen you prompted user list to login. Press ctrl+Alt+F2\nYou will be entered into a terminal.\nLogin with your username & password.\nDelete all files under /var/log.\nThis has fixed my problem.\n\nA: I could solve the same issue by cleaning /media/* path. below cmd may help some one.\ncd /media\nsudo chmod 777 *\nsudo rm-rf *\n\nThe actual issue in my case was, mounted volumes put a trace in /media path which crashes the login with message \"The configuration defaults for GNOME Power Manager have not been installed correctly\".\n", "Q: Did Synapse forget everything and so why?

I have virtual desktop enabled in the wine.cfg (resolution 1280x1024), but the game is displayed a lot smaller than the screen and is in the top left corner of the screen. In fact, it's pretty much exactly the same problem that someone had on appdb (except that my monitor is square, not wide screen): Don't Fullscreen, Opens Top-Left Hand Corner\nI've done some reading on this, and I'm guessing (although not sure) that it has something to do with my xorg file not being able to handle anything other than 1280x1024 (if that is the case, though, I don't know what to do to add more resolutions).\nNote: another thing that makes me think it has to do with my xorg is that when I play Worms Armageddon, the menu screen is small (like all the other games), but when I play a level, it goes to full-screen mode. Which, I'm guessing is because it supports 1280x1024 whereas Battle Realms/StarCraft (being older games and without recent updates) don't support that high of a resolution.\nNote: another thing I noticed about playing StarCraft I, whenever I play it with virtual desktop less than 1280x1024 (i.e. windowed), instead of wine changing the StarCraft resolution to fit the window, StarCraft makes the window fit its resolution (which is really small).\nDoes anyone know how to fix this?

It looks like it mounts the compressed filesystem as I want, but not on the drive I want it.  It seems to me that it just creates a temp mounting folder for compression.\nWhat I would like it to do is take over one whole drive(or 2) that I use for data backup.  For instance:\nMy os is on sdc\nBackup1 is on sdd\nBackup2 is on sde\nI would like fusecompress to mount Backup1 & Backup2 as compressed filesystems.  Can someone help me out with this?  I feel like I'm just messing up the syntax.\nP.S. It is totally acceptable for it to just be a folder inside of the sdd & sde drives that is compressed and mounted.  End result is just 2 mounted locations that are fully compressed on both drives.\n\nA: I think you have to mount an initially empty directory to an empty mount point, then everything you copy to the mount point will be compresses on the original empty dir, but still appear and can be used as if were not on the mount point.\nWhen you unmount with fusermount -u, the data remains in compresses state on the original directory. When you mount again it will be visible as if were not compressed on the mount point.\nIf you put something on the original directory it will not be compressed, being the mount active or not. Only data put on the mount point when the mount is active will be compressed.\nSo, to sum up the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*choose or create two empty directories (the first one will hold all real compressed data, so choose this one carefully);\n\n*run the command fusecompress first-dir second-dir \n\n*copy all data you want to compress to second-dir (you can move, instead of copy, if you so desire, and to free space)\n\n*when you're done, you can unmount with fusermount -u second-dir\nbe aware to never access directly first-dir, when you need to you have to mount again as in step 2.\n", "Q: How do I get the GUI to come back?

I want to upgrade my HP DV6000's wireless card with a BCM4321, but I already have problems getting my BCM4311 to work. Is the BCM4321 card supported? How would I set it up?\n\nA: If you're planning to upgrade a card yourself, I'd personally opt for an Intel wireless chipset. Intel has an unrivalled record for providing drivers for their WiFi cards. You can  all but guarantee it'll work on Linux.\nI didn't know the BCM4321 had onboard BT. I've no idea if it works. As for WiFi, I think it's covered by the newer bcm80211 (renamed to something else in 2.6.29) which works very well for the brcm4313 in this laptop. You need at least Natty for this to work well.\nOn a side note, if wireless transport speeds are important to you, check to make sure it's not hard-limited. The 4313 is limited to a pathetic 72MB/s.

I'm using disper and auto-disper to change screen profiles (undocked; laptop screen + external screen; two external screens). \nI wanted to run auto-disper --change after waking up, so I put the following script in /etc/pm/sleep.d:\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n    thaw | resume )\n        auto-disper --change &> /home/myHome/autodisper_on_wake.txt\n        ;;\nesac\n\nUpon wake, I get the following in autodisper_on_wake.txt, indicating that the script did fire:\nAssuming disper defaults...\n'NoneType' object has no attribute 'endswith'\nUnable to fingerprint display configuration\nhome\nschool\nundocked\n\nBut no change happened - despite unplugging my monitor before waking my machine (going from profile 'school' to profile 'undocked'), I'm still in profile 'school'. \nAny ideas how to proceed? (FWIW, I changed autorandr to have PROFILE and CONFIG point to my absolute home directory, rather than ~ [I thought maybe wake scripts execute as root, so it would look in ~root for profile data]).\n\nA: I searched for this auto-disper thing on google and found something by that name at https://github.com/wertarbyte/auto-disper and looked at the source. It appears to be running X11 based commands, but your pm-script is likely not being run with an X11 environment. There's no clean way to do this, but if you make the assumption that your X session will be running on display 0 (which will typically be the case if you are the only one logged in graphically), you might get it working by running the command as your user and setting the DISPLAY environment variable.\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n    thaw | resume )\n        sudo -u yourusername env DISPLAY=:0 auto-disper --change &> /home/myHome/autodisper_on_wake.txt\n    ;;\nesac\n\n\nA: This worked for me (I am using Ubuntu 12.04 with lightdm):\n#!/bin/bash\n\nUSERNAME=\"xxx\"\nexport DISPLAY=\":0.0\"\nexport HOME=/home/$USERNAME\n\nif [ \"$1\" = \"suspend\" ]\nthen\n    echo \"Switching back disper\"\n    su $USERNAME -c \"/usr/bin/python /usr/bin/disper -s\" \nfi\n\nif [ \"$1\" = \"resume\" ]\nthen\n    echo \"Change disper\" \n    su $USERNAME -c \"DISPLAY=:0.0 disper -l ; sleep 1; DISPLAY=:0.0 disper -S ; sleep 4; DISPLAY=:0.0 disper -S\" \nfi\n\nMaybe also without disper -l and calling disper twice, but I did not check yet\n", "Q: A sudden drop in free disk space I'm using Ubuntu 11.04. Today I suddenly started to get \"low disk space\" warnings. When I checked, I saw that free space on my Ubuntu partition is decreased like 2 or 3 gigabytes. I didn't install anything recently and I don't keep my files in my Ubuntu partition.\nWhat could be the reason for this?\n\nA: I found this to be a problem for me caused by log files building up.\nlogrotate is run as part of cron.daily which by default runs at 6:25 which is quite possible that your machine is never on at this time.\nSo I would start by checking /var/log disk usage.\nIf it is that, you can fix it by editing /etc/crontab and changing it to run cron.daily at 9:25 instead (or a time you know your machine is often on).\nThere is an application called \"Disk Usage Analyser\" installed by default. Use that on the whole filesystem.\n\nA: It could be a number of things (internet caches, caches for other files, a runaway process storing data, etc.).\nYou can install Baobab (if it's not already installed) and use it to find out where most of your disk space is being used up.\n\nA: Most likely, a buggy program started spamming error messages to stdout/stderr. These get logged to ~/.xsession-errors and ~/.xsession-errors.old, which can quickly fill several gigabytes of space Bug 60448.\nA temporary fix is to truncate the file, by running > ~/.xsession-errors and > ~/.xsession-errors.old. (Deleting won't work, since the file is kept open.)\nSee also How do I  prevent .xsession-errors from eating disk space?.\n\nA: Press ctrl + h to show all your hidden folders. Look for .Trash1000. If such a folder exists, clear the files in it to get some space. You can also try clearing your trash and ~/.local/share/trash\n", "Q: What is edge.launchpad.net and how does it work? Quite often I find myself on edge.launchpad.net instead of the 'usual' launchpad. It looks exactly the same as traditional launchpad, so I wonder if there is any difference. This happens usually when I go to launchpad by clicking a link on a third party website. \nSomehow people prefer to link to the edge subdomain of launchpad, or at least I have such impression.\nSo what exactly is the edge.launchpad.net? And why some people prefer it than the usual launchpad.net?\nLooking for information I was always redirected to https://help.launchpad.net/LaunchpadReleases and https://help.launchpad.net/BetaTesting , but I didn't find there anything about edge. I guess it may be something like a testing environment, if yes, than how does it differ from staging.launchpad.net and qastaging.launchpad.net?\n\nA: There is absolutely no difference between edge.launchpad.net and launchpad.net. It used to be used for easy testing of new Launchpad code, but is now deprecated.\nBack in the olden days (well about twelve months ago) then anyone could join a special group on Launchpad. If you were a member of this testing group then whenever you visited launchpad.net you were automatically redirected to edge.launchpad.net. Because of this automatic redirection, a lot of people forgot about it, and posted links to edge.launchpad.net all over the place. Although this wasn't harmful (anyone could go test on edge.launchpad.net) I can see people being confused by it.\nFor some reason they've let the domain hang around for a while, to be honest they've probably just forgotten about turning it off (well redirecting everyone back to launchpad.net).\nAnyway, the point is that right now, you get exactly the same results whether you view edge or the main domain.\n\nA: It was something like testing environment -- https://answers.launchpad.net/launchpad/+faq/75 and members of launchpad-beta-testers had this by default, but it's now deprecated -- http://blog.launchpad.net/general/edge-is-deprecated\n", "Q: Caps lock key swaps back to default after minute or so after I set it with setxkbmap Im trying to swap caps with control in last ubuntu xfce4 windows manager.

Any advice ? \n\nA: It looks like you are experiencing this bug on bugzilla - and reported also on Launchpad.\nUpstream says this is fixed - however this has not been backported on Natty.\nWhilst I don't normally recommend installing deb packages from different versions of Ubuntu - in this case, the package is simple without dependencies - and the launchpad bug recommendation is similar.\nI recommend that you download the oneiric deb (do not add the oneiric repository) and install it.\ni.e. 32bit from here, and 64bit from here.\nsudo dpkg -i <name of the deb file downloaded>\n\n", "Q: Unable to change brightness in a Lenovo laptop Brightness adjustment keys <Fn + ⇑/⇓> have no effect (although they are recognized by the environment), and I can't change the brightness using GUI tools as well. This seems like a problem in Linux itself, not the desktop environment.\nI can change the brightness in Windows OS, so it's not some kind of hardware fault.\n\nDetails:\n          Lenovo B570 (Model Name: 20093)\n          Integrated Intel HD graphics card\n          Kubuntu 11.04 (Linux 2.6.38-10-generic, KDE 4.7.0), everything up to date\n          No proprietary graphics drivers (only Wi-Fi one)\nWhat I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/default/grub↦GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT: acpi_osi=Linux, acpi_backlight=vendor, nomodeset. And yes, I did update-grub\n\n*Edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf (no such file, even after sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg)\n\n*Edit /proc/acpi/video/VGA/LCD/brightness (no such file)\n\n*sudo setpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=XX (no effect)\n\n*xbacklight -set XX (\"No outputs have backlight property\")\n\n\nHow can I fix this issue?\n\nA: *\n\n*Install linux-kamal-mjgbacklight - a patch for Linux kernel.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check whether it will work for you:\nlsmod | grep ^i915\nSomething like i915 331519 3 should appear. If there's no output, this will not work.\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kamalmostafa/linux-kamal-mjgbacklight\n\n*Install updates (sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade)\n\n\n*Reboot.\n\n*Now you can use the terminal to adjust brightness, as suggested by Lekensteyn.\nIf it's OK for you to change brightness with terminal+sudo, this is the end of the answer.\nIf you are on GNOME desktop, brightness may even function fully already.\n\n*Download my brightness changer script, allow it to be executed, and put it to /usr/local/bin/:\nwget -O brightness http://ideone.com/plain/yPlo5\nchmod +x brightness\nsudo mv brightness /usr/local/bin\n\n*We have to allow the brightness file to be edited, so that sudo isn't needed everywhere.\nAlso, we want to make the brightness setting restore itself to the previous setting when the system boots (it is not saved by default, unfortunately).  \nThe mentioned brightness script can handle it all (with restore parameter), just add it to autorun.\nTo do this we will edit /etc/rc.local (sudo nano /etc/rc.local or any editor instead of nano).\nAdd the following line before the exit 0 line:\n/usr/local/bin/brightness restore\n\n*It is best to reboot now.\n\n*So the brightness script works. You may go to terminal any time and type these:\n\n\n*\n\n*brightness - get current brightness setting\n\n*brightness value - set the brightness to value\n\n*brightness inc step, brightness dec step - increase or decrease the brightness by step (if it's not specified, a default value is used from the configuration file, usually 10% of maximal brightness)\n\n\n*Now you might want to map brightness change to your hotkeys.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Set XF86BrightnessUp to brightness inc\n\n*Set XF86BrightnessDown to brightness dec\n\n\n*If you want to tweak something, make sure to look at /etc/bx_brightness.conf\nYou can change the step by which brightness is changed with brightness inc/dec\n\nThanks to Toz for his priceless help in this thread.\n\nA: If the GUI tools fail, try to use the terminal for it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal\n\n*Run: ls /sys/class/backlight/*/brightness. Example output would be:\n/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\n\n*If nothing is found, the kernel does not support brightness control (missing drivers?). Otherwise, you can use the below commands (replace acpi_video0 accordingly):\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the current brightness level:\ncat /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\n\n*Get the maximum brightness level:\ncat /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/max_brightness\n\nThese commands return brightness levels which ranges from zero to max_brightness (see above).\n\n*To change the brightness level, you need to write a number to the brightness file. This cannot be done by an editor like gedit. Say you want to change your brightness to 5, you have to run:\necho 5 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\nAlternatively, if you just want to set the brightness level to the highest available:\nsudo tee /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness < /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/max_brightness\n\n\nA: I think I found an easy and least effect to the existed things' way for adjusting intel_backlight using udev rules.\nI noticed \"change\" action of \"backlight\" subsystem when I press Fn+Up/Down on my Lenovo G360 notebook running kernel 3.2.

With it you can set up hot keys to control brightness, use your mousewheel or select from a drop down list in the indicator. I have replaced 'Fn' with 'Win+Alt' which is very similar for my hands and now I can also use it with an external keyboard!\nTo add PPA and install:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:indicator-brightness/ppa\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install indicator-brightness\n\nHot keys should be assigned to:\n/opt/extras.ubuntu.com/indicator-brightness/indicator-brightness-adjust --up\n\nand\n/opt/extras.ubuntu.com/indicator-brightness/indicator-brightness-adjust --down\n\nFootnote: Out of the box, the birghtness indicator recognizes 7 levels of brightness in my system. By adding acpi_backlight=vendor to the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in /etc/default/grub, that number is bumped up to 16! \n\nA: I have a lenovo ideapad z400.\nI tried all the TIPS listed above, no success. \nSo I found a different one that worked very well :\nPut the following line in /etc/default/grub \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"acpi_backlight=vendor acpi_osi=Linux resume=/dev/sdYY\"\n\nYY = Swap area, use swapon -s to see you swap device.\nExecute an update-grub as root\nAfter the reboot the problem was solved.\n\nA: I have a Thinkpad T450s with Nvidia graphics and binary drivers on Ubuntu 14.04. In order to get the backlight working I had to edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file by adding the following line to the intel device definition (The xorg.conf-file is created when installing the binary drivers):\nOption      \"Backlight\"  \"intel_backlight\"\n\nThe complete section is now:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier \"intel\"\n    Driver \"intel\"\n    BusID \"PCI:0@0:2:0\"\n    Option \"Backlight\" \"intel_backlight\"\n    Option \"AccelMethod\" \"SNA\"\nEndSection\n\n\nA: Try this. It worked for my Ubuntu 14, Lenovo B570, Intel Graphics.\nOpen a terminal and create the following configuration file, if it does not exist:\nsudo touch /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf\nNow we need to edit this file. You can use any editor be it a terminal one or graphical.\nsudo gedit /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf\nAdd the following lines to this file:\nSection \"Device\"\n        Identifier  \"card0\"\n        Driver      \"intel\"\n        Option      \"Backlight\"  \"intel_backlight\"\n        BusID       \"PCI:0:2:0\"\n\nEndSection\n\nSave it.

Eventually in the Bios I found a 'Hotkey' enable/disable function. Paradoxically, it was 'Enabled', but this in fact enables a single key press operation for the function keys. In fact, if you use the traditional 'Fn + Function keyX' technique, they don't work. \nIf you 'Disable' the hotkey function in the Bios, then the function keys work 'as expected' (Fn + Function Keyx). - After doing this, all the function keys worked OK. So much for progress  \n\nA: I had to add these lines to grub:\nacpi_backlight=vendor acpi_osi=linux thinkpad-acpi.brightness_enable=1\n\nNote that last one.

I have one desktop, with a 1TB disk, and a laptop with a 500GB disk. I also have a home server, which has a 1TB disk. The server's disk is completely usable for the solution.\nI'd like a solution that would be able to run on my home network - so Ubuntu One is out of the question, and it's prohibitively expensive for the amount of data - and would allow my laptop, with a smaller total hard drive space than my desktop, to access all my files - I believe this removes an rsync based solution.\nI would also like to be able to access files that have been \"synchronised\", for lack of a better word, to my laptop when I am not connected to my home network. This would also be useful for my desktop, in the case of the server being powered down.\nI am quite competent with Linux, as well as networking, so I am not afraid of any technical issues.\nThanks in advance,\nJoe.\n\nA: I think you would like to make your own personal \"Dropbox\" at your home server.   \nThere is a project called lipsync:   \n\"A lightweight service that provides automated file synchronization between multiple hosts\nlipsync is an open source, lightweight service that provides automated two-way, Dropbox file synchronization in Linux by utilizing OpenSSH, rsync, and lsyncd. lipsync is a the realization of a popular blog post of mine named HOWTO build your own open source Dropbox clone Since I made the posting I’ve received a great deal of interest, and had time to test and architect a workable solution.

So the average user could just use the laptop not worrying about it? I know there's Voria's PPA but that should be OOTB support.\nThanks.\n\nA: Samsung laptops, just with other manufacturers' machines, use wildly different components from one model to another. It's impossible to say that they'll all just work.\nGoogling the model number is usually a good starting point for finding users with problems but even if you don't find issues, it doesn't mean you won't have them.\nIf you can find a list of the specifications you can check the individual components (graphics, wireless, etc) for issues which might exist in different laptops with these parts, again, with Google.\nAnd there is the Ubuntu Certified Hardware page for which manufacturers can submit their laptops for testing. The problem specifically for you is Samsung don't submit their computers for testing. If you're buying many, many machines, perhaps you have enough power to convince somebody at Samsung to join the certification program.\n", "Q: Is the Ubuntu policy manual out of date?

I know how to modify xorg.conf and get it to start at about 1024x768, but I can't get it to start at 1600x1200.  It is quite an inconvenience to have to go and manually start them up each time.  We are using these servers as automation agents.  We are browser testing using sikuli so we can't go headless.\n\nA: By default, X will use DDC to probe the monitor for its supported resolutions.  If the monitor is not plugged in, then this will not be possible.  If you know the characteristics of the monitor, you can program in additional modes through the xorg.conf file.\nIf you haven't already, add a Monitor section.  This can be hooked in in one of two ways: either a Monitor \"$IDENTIFIER\" directive in the Screen section (the old way), or a Option \"monitor-$OUTPUT\" \"$IDENTIFIER\" directive in the Device section (the new multi-head aware way).  If you use the second method, it uses the same output names as the xrandr utility.\nIn the Monitor section, add one or more ModeLine directives for each of the modes you want to program.  According to the man page, the format is as follows:\nModeLine \"name\" clock hdisp hsyncstart hsyncend htotal vdisp vsyncstart vsyncend vtotal options\n\nIf the monitor is plugged in, you should be able to get this information from the xrandr --verbose command.  For instance, if it shows the following:\n  1920x1080 (0x59)  148.5MHz +HSync +VSync *current +preferred\n        h: width  1920 start 2008 end 2052 total 2200 skew    0 clock   67.5KHz\n        v: height 1080 start 1084 end 1089 total 1125           clock   60.0Hz\n\nThen the corresponding ModeLine would be:\nModeLine \"1920x1080\" 148.5 1920 2008 2052 2200 1080 1084 1089 1125 +HSync +VSync\n\nYou should then be able to configure that mode even though the monitor is not initially connected.\n", "Q: How do I access machines on the home network with their machine name? I have all machines connecting to the internet through a wireless router (occasionally I plug a machine into the router via cable). I have installed the ssh package and can access one Ubuntu machine from another using, for example, \"ssh 10.0.0.2\". However, the local IP addresses change as machines are switched off and on and reconnect to the router, so I'd prefer to use \"ssh machinename\".\nIf I do type \"ssh machinename\", nothing happens, no error, no returning to the prompt.\nWhat do I need to install/configure to access Ubuntu machines via their machine name?\n(As a side note, I have Samba installed so I can access Windows machines on the same network. I have set name resolve order = lmhosts wins bcast host because I use OpenDNS, I'm not sure if this could affect Ubuntu networking. Name-based resolution works in both directions between Windows and Ubuntu (for example, connecting to an Ubuntu machine with WinSCP).)\n\nA: First, make sure you have the Avahi daemon installed. (Should be installed by default on Ubuntu Desktop, but not on Server.)\nsudo apt-get install avahi-daemon\n\nThen to access them, add \".local\" to the end of the name, for example\nssh machinename.local\n\nI'm not sure if it's possible to remove the need to add .local\n\nA: In case you only want to ssh into a machine by using a good to remember name you can also define a name in ~/.ssh/config by adding an entry like e.g.:\nHost myremote\n    HostName 192.168.0.0 # IP or myremote.local name of remote\n    Port 980 # Port to connect if different to defaults\n    User <myloginname>\n\nWe are then able to ssh to myremote.local by simply typing:\nssh myremote\n\n", "Q: NM-applet's VPN menu disappears I spend my days hopping between VPN connections in Ubuntu 10.10 and this is becoming severely annoying.

(Said menu item is still there, it just doesn't have a submenu or do anything when clicked.) Every time I killall nm-applet and start it again, which usually brings the menu back. \nHas anybody here experienced this and been able to fix it?\n\nA: I have the same issue.  \nI have that package version (0.8.4~git.20110318t152954.9c4c9a0-0ubuntu1), running on 11.04.

The version of network-manager-gnome available in that PPA is newer then the Canonical version and has some bugs in it that apparently crash the applet (causing the VPN menu to dissapear). You can check to see where your version of network-manager-gnome is coming from by opening synaptic and searching for network-manager-gnome. As of today, the latest Canonical version is 0.8.4~git.20110318t152954.9c4c9a0-0ubuntu1 and the maintainer of the package should be the Ubuntu Core Developers.\nIf you notice that your version of network-manager-gnome is not coming from the Canonical, select network-manager-gnome in synaptic and then select 'force version' from the package menu. This will prompt you to select the version you want to force, select 0.8.4~git.20110318t152954.9c4c9a0-0ubuntu1.\n\nA: Thanks tons!!! this worked:\nI created a bash command called vpn-applet.sh \n#! /bin/sh\nkillall nm-applet\nnm-applet --sm-disable &\n\nThen I  \nchmod +x vpn-applet.sh   \n\nran it (as root?), and the menu problem was gone. \nNow I don't need to reboot!\nThanks\nPlease, lets get this nasty problem fixed.

From the technical overview of Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric:\n\nUbuntu 11.10 has migrated away from /var/run, /var/lock and /dev/shm and now uses /run, /run/lock and /run/shm instead (respectively).\n\n\n\n*\n\n*I hardcode these paths in my applications, why is this change made to Oneiric?\n\n*What can I do to make my applications backwards- and forward-compatible? Is there a better way other than checking first for the existence of /run, and then /var/run?\n\n\nA: The intent is to reduce the number of tmpfs file systems.  On 11.04, there are separate tmpfs file systems at /var/lock, /var/run and /dev/shm.  If these directories were all under a single parent directory, then only a single tmpfs would be needed.  It also provides an obvious location for further runtime state data that shouldn't persist over reboots.\nUnless your application depends on canonical paths of files, your application should run without modification since the old locations will be symlinked to the new ones.  The AppArmor policies are one case that does depend on the real path names, which is why it was mentioned specifically.\nThe following links should help explain the rationale:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel/2011-March/150031.html\n\n*https://bugs.linuxfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=718\n\n*https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/fhs-discuss/2011-May/000061.html\n\n*http://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/RunDirectory\n\nA: From what I have read, this was the original explanation given as to why /run was introduced. http://lwn.net/Articles/436012/\n\nA: *\n\n*/run is a new cross-distribution tmpfs location for the storage of transient state files—that is, files containing run-time information that may or may not need to be written early in the boot process and which does not require preserving across reboots.\nMaking the /run directory available brings us a step closer to the point where it is possible to use the system normally with the root filesystem mounted read-only, without requiring any clunky workarounds such as aufs/unionfs overlays.\n/run replaces several existing locations described in the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard:\n\n\n*\n\n*/var/run → /run\n\n*/var/lock → /run/lock\n\n*/dev/shm → /run/shm [currently only Debian plans to do this]\n\n*/tmp → /run/tmp [optional; currently only Debian plans to offer this]\n\n*/run also replaces some other locations that have been used for transient files:\n\n*/lib/init/rw → /run\n\n*/dev/.* → /run/*\n\n*/dev/shm/* → /run/*\n\n*writable files under /etc → /run/*\n(so you probably can expect these to move aswell).\nSource:debian release goals\n\n*I would advice on creating a part in your software where you set these directories in variables, change your code to use these variables and then alter the variables based on the system it is used on (but I bet you knew that already).\n\nA: You should not hardcode any of these /run paths!\n\n\n*\n\n*Use /var/run, because a symlink will be in place to /run if applicable\n\n*/var/lock is the same as above\n\n*Don't hardcode /dev/shm ever, always use shm_open etc (the posix API)\n\n\nA: Note: since /run introduction, small configurations might get troubles. My Ubuntu server is 256Mo RAM and /run is by default set to 49Mo.\nAt startup, it fills the filesystem until fullness.\nMaking changes in fstab does not operate to inscrease tempfs /run size. Neither does others procedures I found on gg.\nI found the solution to add in init script : /etc/rc.local the line \n    mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /run -o remount,size=85M\nto extends at startup.(The 85M is for my conf.) \n", "Q: Installing Windows after ubuntu on a separate HDD? I have Ubuntu 11.04 installed on my machine and I would like to install windows 7 as well. I heard that Windows 7 creates an additional partition along with the normal one and I was afraid that this might overwrite some of my ext3 partitions.\nTo avoid this risk I'm thinking of installing Windows 7 on a separate drive. Will Windows affect the MBR if they are installed on a separate drive? Do I have to edit grub after installing Windows? Is there any safe/easy method to do so?\n\nA: Windows likes to be the big I am & will believe itself to be the primary OS.  This can cause problems, for instance, when effecting a repair install (therefore wiping GRUB.)  It is best practise to have 7 on primary disk (sda) & Linux on secondary (sdb.)  \nYou can then alter boot order in BIOS, or if this is not possible, use EasyBCD from within Windows.  Since you have separate physical disks you have some redundancy if one should fail.  Might be  a good idea to keep an image of 7 on NTFS partition on your secondary Linux HDD.  & also image just your Linux partitions with Clonezilla to your primary Win HDD (no point having an image of an image!)\nHope this makes sense...\n\nA: Installing Windows will overwrite the MBR anyway (had this problem some time ago). The way you can get it working, is to physically UNPLUG the drive with your Ubuntu, by completely removing it from your computer, then installing Windows on the other drive, and re-plugging the drive with Ubuntu. \nThis way you will be completely sure MBR will be okay, for Windows installer will have absolutely no access to the drive with Ubuntu, as it will be separated from your computer (but some people advice it is even safer too temporarily keep the unmounted drive in a separate room, just in case [not really, I'm just kidding]).\nThis way you will get both systems installed on separate drives. After re-plugging make sure to alter your BIOS setting - you want to start the boot from the Ubuntu drive, as that's where GRUB is. Note that on first boot you will (most probably) not have an option to boot Windows. To fix that, boot into your Ubuntu and run sudo update-grub, this should detect Windows and add it's entry to the boot menu.\n", "Q: How do I create application launchers in Gnome Panel I currently use individual application launchers to create something like below for the apps I commonly use\n\nThey are tedious to create/modify as I have to move/modify 1 by 1 - Is there a better way?\nUPDATE: I am using Ubuntu Classic, the launchers are added by \"Right Click Panel > Add to Panel > Application Launcher\"\n\n\nA: From any menu\nTo add a launcher to a panel from a menu, perform one of the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*Open a menu that contains the launcher.

Should I create it? I'm worried about U1 uploading my whole Documentos (My documents in Spanish Windows).\n\nA: Since I don't use Windows, I cannot provide a detailed answer. These are assumptions. If you test them and they fit, then great. :)\nYou should have an Ubuntu One control panel GUI application. If it's similar to the one in Ubuntu, then you should have a page called Cloud Folders. There you can choose which folders to sync on that device. And you can sync as many folders and you like and you don't have to sync all folders on all computers. For instance, you can sync one folder between your office desktop and home office desktop, but not with your laptops. \nI would not expect Ubuntu One to create a special folder on Windows and I would certainly not expect it to sync the entire Documents folder. I think that would be a major bug. Instead, you should choose folders to sync and if you need others, then you should create them and configure them to be synced. \nHope it helps. :)\n", "Q: Where can I find a comprehensive list of compatible USB devices?

I have them both plugged in, and when I want to use the headphones I just turn off the speakers and switch on the headphones.  I know that simultaneous output on digital and analog is supported by the hardware, because it worked fine in Windows XP.  But on Ubuntu, I seem to only get one at a time, depending on which setting is selected in the combo box located at System -> Preferences -> Sound -> Hardware.  \nHow can I get simultaneous analog and digital output without having to switch the profile every time?  I'm on Ubuntu 11.04 and it's an HDA Intel chip.  \n\n\nA: We have the optional application paprefs  that allows to install a virtual output device to pulseaudio. This enables simultaneous output to all attached sound cards/devices:\n\nThe additionally created audio output device for simultaneous output may be selected in the \"Output\" tab from pulseaudio sound preferences menu:\n\n\nFrom the command line we can also load the device for simultaneous output without having to run paprefs by\npacmd load-module module-combine-sink\n# pacmd load-module module-combine # for PulseAudio < 1.0\n\nPut this line (without pacmd) in your /etc/pulse/default.pa to load this device at startup.\n\nA: The accepted answer doesn't work anymore, at least from ubuntu 16.04 LTS (maybe even more, but I am not sure). What works is the following (tested in ubuntu 17.10): https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio/Examples\nSpecifically add the following to your /etc/pulse/default.pa\n### Load analog device\nload-module module-alsa-sink device=hw:0,0\nload-module module-combine-sink sink_name=combined\nset-default-sink combined\n\n", "Q: Why can't I install FreePascal and the Gold linker at the same time? I develop in Haskell privatly, but for school I have to use Delphi (I am allowed to use Lazarus though). To speed up linking in GHC (The compiler for Haskell) I installed binutilus-gold. But now, when I try to install lazarus, I get a conflicting package: binutils-gold. Does anybody knows, how to install both at the same time?\n\nA: Unfortunately we have that:\n\n\n*\n\n*lazarus     depends   on lazarus-ide\n\n*lazarus-ide depends   on fp-compiler\n\n*fp-compiler conflicts with binutils-gold\n\n\nso I suggest to remove binutils-gold and stay with binutils.\n\nA: I don't know much about Ubuntu package policies, but the search for \"ld\" of Free Pascal can be overriden using the -XP parameter.\nThe -XP parameter specifies a prefix that prefixes all calls to binutils with this prefix, and can be added to FPC's fpc.cfg to make it a default.\nIf you want to have the gold utils default, just create symlinks to say binutils-ld binutils-as binutils-ar etc somewhere in the $PATH and add \n-XPbinutils-  \n\non an empty line to /etc/fpc.cfg (some debian and ubuntu versions have a /etc/fpc.d hierarchy for FPC configs)\n", "Q: Where is the PPA sources config file? I have added three PPAs.\nHow do I backup their configuration?\nWhere is the PPA config file?\n\nA: PPAs tend to be added into their own files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/. Here is an extract from a ls in that directory on this system:\nam-monkeyd-nautilus-elementary-ppa-maverick.list\nam-monkeyd-nautilus-elementary-ppa-maverick.list.save\nawn-testing-ppa-maverick.list\nawn-testing-ppa-maverick.list.save\nbanshee-team-banshee-unstable-maverick.list\nbanshee-team-banshee-unstable-maverick.list.save\nbanshee-team-ppa-maverick.list\n\nIf you're trying to move these to another system or back them up, just using these files is not the best idea because these files have version specific strings in them. Look at my answer on another question. It will generate a list of PPA strings that you can add back manually (or with a little script that just loops the list).\n", "Q: Minimal system or minimal virtual machine on install? I've been thinking a lot about this lately and haven't been able to find any good documentation online that explains this:\nWhen installing Ubuntu Server, I can choose between Minimal system and Minimal virtual machine by hitting the F4 button at the install screen.\nWhy should I choose one over the other?\n\nA: You choose virtual machine if you want to install this server inside a virtual machine (ie. Virtualbox, VMware Player) and that install is optimised for usage within a virtual machine.\nOtherwise you are installing on a system itself and should choose for minimal system\n\nA: *\n\n*Default server = Server kernel + \"Basic Ubuntu server\" task packages\n\n*Minimal system = Server kernel + no additional packages\n\n*Virtual machine = Virtual kernel + no additional packages\n\n\nVirtual kernel is a more lightweight version of the kernel with several modules like audio and SATA left out. In VirtualBox you need to modify the guest VM settings first if you want to use a \"minimal virtual machine\" (otherwise the Ubuntu guest will crash):\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable PAE/NX\n\n*Delete the SATA Controller and use SCSI Controller to add the hard disk. Enable host I/O cache.\n\n\nA: Using 'minimal VM install', I found that it has a vm-related modules loaded by default:\n$ modinfo vmw_balloon\nfilename:       /lib/modules/3.2.0-29-virtual/kernel/drivers/misc/vmw_balloon.ko\nlicense:        GPL\nalias:          vmware_vmmemctl\nalias:          dmi:*:svnVMware*:*\nversion:        1.2.1.3-k\ndescription:    VMware Memory Control (Balloon) Driver\nauthor:         VMware, Inc.\nsrcversion:     D9F701E37D1BF118F0537DE\ndepends:        \nintree:         Y\nvermagic:       3.2.0-29-virtual SMP mod_unload modversions 686 \n\nso it looks like such install option is more suitable to work under VM environment.\n", "Q: Connect/disconnect from VPN from the command line I have two VPNs setup on my Ubuntu machine, one using vpnc and one using PPTP. These were both setup using the GNOME network manager interface and work great. However on occasion I need to access this machine remotely - is there a way to connect or disconnect to these VPNs from the command line?\n\nA: ihashacks's answer with Matt's comments worked for me... almost.  Had to tweak one line.\nMy password-flag line actually read: \"Xauth password-flag\". The accepted answer wouldn't work for me until I changed to the following\n[vpn]\n...\nXauth password-flag=0\nIPSec secret-flags=0\n\n[vpn-secrets]\nXauth password=<my pw> ## This is the one I changed.\nIPSec secret=<group pw>\n\nNot sure why my VPN connections have \"Xauth\" before every mention of password.\n\nA: If you want to interact with NetworkManager from the command line you can use the \"nmcli\" command.\nlist all NM connections: nmcli con\nstart connection (wifi, vpn, etc): nmcli con up id ConnectionName\ndown connection: nmcli con down id ConnectionName\n(more nmcli commands in the nmcli manpage).\n\nAlso note that regular users usually don't have permission to control networking. Using the commands above with sudo should work for most connections, but VPN specifically might fail with \"Error: Connection activation failed: no valid VPN secrets.\"\nIf that happens to you, it's likely that the VPN password is stored in your user's gnome-keyring, which makes it inaccessible to the root user. This comment explains why.\nTo fix this, edit /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ConnectionName and under [vpn], change the password flags line to:\npassword-flags=0\n\nIf there is a line starting with Xauth password-flags, change it instead.\nThen add the following below the [vpn] block:\n[vpn-secrets]\npassword=YourPassword\n\n(If in the previous step you changed the line Xauth password-flags, add Xauth password=... instead.)\nNow restart network manager by:\nsudo service network-manager restart\n\nThen starting the VPN connection with sudo nmcli con up id ConnectionName should work without problems.\n", "Q: How do I disable the vga16fb module during Ubuntu Server setup? I have used the instructions given in the following link to fix the slow Hyper-V console of a Ubuntu Server box.\nhttp://solyaris.wordpress.com/2010/05/01/ubuntu-10-04-on-intel-driver-and-server-frame-buffer/\nI am hoping that there is a way to fix the problem before the install so that the installation routine won't take so long.\n\nA: Two possible suggestions you could try - during the install you should be given the option to edit your boot line.\nTry adding video=vga16fb:off immediately before quiet splash.\nAlternatively try the option vga16fb.modeset=0\n\nA: From what I understood in your link, all your did was blacklist the vga16fb module so it won't load at startup. You can dynamically unload a module from the command line using the rmmod command. So if you are using the GUI installed try opening a terminal and running the command:\nsudo rmmod vga16fb\n\n", "Q: How do I setup a timer based notification? Being a compulsive computer user, I am in front of it all day. I sometimes lose track of time when I am working on my comp. I need a notification service to alert me of the current time, either by a popup notification or a sound being played or both.\nFor the popup, I found the Free Desktop notification standard which uses a DBus API.\nI was able to create a notification using DFeet, a graphical DBUS explorer. I used the following arguments:\n\"wakeup\", 1234, \"\", \"The time is\", \"9PM\", [], [], 1\n\nIt works fine so far, but how can I take it further from here?\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I invoke this from the command-line?\n\n*How do I automate this command? Is cron still the recommended way of automating time based actions?\n\n*How do I play sounds along with the popup? Either via the FreeDesktop API or via a media player?\n\n\nA complete solution would be appreciated and perhaps useful to others too.\n\nA: Since I couldn't use dbus-send I wrote a python script instead. The pynotify module internally uses the dbus API. For extra kicks I added a fortune cookie in the message. Works like a charm:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\"\"\"python 2.7 script that creates a notification using pynotify. It shows the current time and a small fortune cookie\"\"\"\ntry:\n  import pynotify\n  import time\n  import subprocess\n  if pynotify.init(\"Wakeup service\"):\n    subprocess.Popen([\"paplay\", \"/usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/message.ogg\"])\n\n    # You can get more stock icons from here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3894763/what-icons-are-available-to-use-when-displaying-a-notification-with-libnotify\n    timeStr = time.strftime(\"%I:%M %p %d %b\")\n    cookie = subprocess.check_output([\"/usr/games/fortune\", \"-s\"])\n    n = pynotify.Notification(timeStr, cookie, \"/usr/share/app-install/icons/ktimer.png\")\n    n.set_timeout(1)\n    n.show()\n  else:\n    print \"problem initializing the pynotify module\"\nexcept Exception as exc:\n  print \"Exception\", exc\n\nI then scheduled this using cron. The crontab entry looks like:\n0,30 * * * * DISPLAY=:0 ./local/bin/notify_new.py\n\nUpdate:Added a method to play a sound using pulse audio\n\nA: You can use a simple Python script, like this:\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport dbus\nimport sys\n\nbus = dbus.SessionBus()\n\nnotify = bus.get_object('org.freedesktop.Notifications', '/org/freedesktop/Notifications')\nmethod = notify.get_dbus_method('Notify', 'org.freedesktop.Notifications')\n\nmethod(\"wakeup\", 1234, \"\", \"The time is\", \"9PM\", [], [], 1)\n\n\nA: You can send messages using the dbus-send command. See man:dbus-send for more details about that. \n", "Q: Refer to folders using /dev/sd#/* Can we bind folders with their directories described with the drive names? For example:\n/dev/sda1/Folder\n\n\nA: No. /dev/sda1 is a partition. The partition contains a filesystem which you'll mount. But you can mount them anywhere you like. Nothing really wrong if you want to use /partitions/sda1 instead of /media/hollidays-2011 for instance, but I don't understand why you'd want to.\n\nA: No, you can't do that. /dev/sd* are devices. But you can always mount your partition automatically by placing a line like this one below in your fstab and using its /dev/sd* name:\n/dev/sda4    /media/sda4    [... options ...]\n\nAnd referring to your reply to jo-erlend:\n\n\"in a particular case, mounting a partition with either UUID or label failed. The partition is one the same device as /, so it is mounted automatically.\"\n\nI assume that you meant 'The partition is on the same device ...', right? It is not mounted automatically. '/' is mounted because it has its own line in fstab file.\nuuid files (located in /dev/disk/by-uuid/) are just links to their associated /dev/sd* files. So it is very much likely that if mount fails with uuid, so it will using /dev/sd*.\n", "Q: Disable screensaver while watching flash videos I generally watch lot of lengthy videos on YouTube. I always experience a problem because the screensaver is activated every 5 minutes.\nI would like to know how to disable the screensaver while watching flash videos. I know, that I can change the screensaver timer or completely disable the screensaver. But I don't want to do that. I just want to disable it while I am watching full screen videos on my browser.\nUpdate: I am using google chrome.\n\nA: Use caffeine, there is absolutely no need to patch flash player, that is way too much work when you can just install caffeine. When you run caffeine it will be in your notification area, a little coffee cup, when you want to watch a video just click on the icon and go to 'disable screen saver'. I use this all the time when I watch videos on the net. When you are done you can just click on the icon again and go to 'enable screen saver'.\nhttps://launchpad.net/~caffeine-developers/+archive/ppa\n\nA: You'll have to patch the flash-player to send the appropriate signals, like Totem does. Unfortunately, most people have to use Adobe Flash, which is proprietary software. \nBut did you know that Totem supports watching videos from Youtube? It does deactivate the screensaver when you're playing stuff. You find it in the dropdown list that normally says playlist in the right-panel of Totem. Hope that helps. :)\n", "Q: High resolution in Thinkpad T60 with ATI X1400 I salvaged good old T60 machine, with ATI X1400 and hi resolution screen (1600x1200).

The same way as installing Kubuntu but having the option to change between desktops (KDE or Gnome). If I try to install xubuntu-desktop it tells me it wants to remove ubuntu-desktop and the notify-osd.\n\nA: It's likely a conflict between xfce4-notifyd and notify-osd. Since notify-osd is in required by ubuntu-desktop, it needs to be removed. But removing ubuntu-desktop, does not mean removing the actual software. The ubuntu-desktop package itself is a meta package which is only there to ensure that all components are present. So, installing ubuntu-desktop will install firefox, for instance, but uninstalling ubuntu-desktop will not remove firefox.\nI don't know why there is a conflict between those two notification systems, but that's probably something you should have a look at before you start, since notify-osd is rather cool. \n\nA: May not be exactly what you want, but you can install Xfce (sudo apt-get install xfce4) as a separate package and simply choose that as your desktop session when you log in. You shouldn't need to remove a thing.\n\nA: As it has been mentioned it is because notify-xfce4. Personally I like it more than notify-osd, it supports themes, you can set the position and transparency of notifications, you can dismiss them and have actions on click. That said they are fully compatible, notify-xfce4 will work with Ubuntu desktop, and if you remove it later and reinstall notify-osd, that will work with Xubuntu flawlessly.\n", "Q: Use `less` to view BIG (multi-gigabyte) CSV files I have a big (multi-gigabyte) CSV file, which I am viewing with a puny computer.\nI would like to view my file using less or some command like it which doesn't have to read the whole file at once to show me part of it.\nIs there a command out there which can show me my file in comma-aligned columns?\n\nA: There is a csv column formatting question on another StackOverflow site - does this work for your very-large file?\ncat somefile.csv | column -s, -t | less -#2 -N -S\n\n\nA: I just tried vim with a 514M text file.

I have been running Ubuntu inside a VM for the past 6 months or so, but I am struggling to get great performance out of it. My goal is to be able to setup a dual boot of Windows and Ubuntu, so that when I really need performance I can just boot into Ubuntu, but for other times when I need to use Windows, I can still pop open the boot instance of Ubuntu in a VM. \nIs this possible? I have done this in Parallels for Mac, but I'm not aware of anything that will allow me to do this in Windows.\n\nA: I can't see why this should be impossible. Let's break down the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*VirtualBox on Windows probably uses a file on the Windows filesystem to store the guest (Ubuntu) virtual HDD. Learn how to use a partition instead.\n\n*Once, you have a real Ubuntu partition, set up a bootloader (grub) or modify the bootloader you already have.\n\n*Now, boot into Ubuntu. Ubuntu should recognize your hardware (which is different from the emulated hardware when running inside VirtualBox). If your hardware is supported, see if VirtualBox guest additions (graphics, networking) cause any trouble. Check whether networking needs work.\n\n*Go back to Windows and see if Ubuntu under VirtualBox still works.\n\n*Be very careful with hibernating Ubuntu. \n\nA: It turns out that Kris Harper's post has the exact answer to the question.\n\nThe menu.lst file was part of the original GRUB. Ubuntu now uses GRUB2 by default, so the config file has changed to /boot/grub.cfg.\nHere is a rather long primer about GRUB2. Scroll down to section 5 to read about editing the GRUB config file. Note that you shouldn't edit this file directly in normal circumstances. Instead, editing /etc/default/grub is the preferred way to prevent overwriting your changes on update.\nHere's another primer on editing the GRUB2 config file. It's not as technical.\n\n", "Q: Dockmanager helper for Thunderbird Can I find anywhere a dockmanager helper (for use with DockbarX, docky and awn) for Thunderbird?\n\nA: There is a add-on available for Thunderbird that allows docks such as docky and awn that use Dbus to display unread mail counts.\n\n", "Q: How to stop mysql from running at boot time? Currently, my MySQL server starts on every server boot. For a couple reasons, this is undesirable behavior. Is there a way to disable this behavior?\n\nA: Things have changed quite a bit in Ubuntu now. I think from version 11 onwards.\nMySQL is handled by Upstart while Apache still uses traditional SysV init scripts\nFor MySQL, you can use the new override feature in Upstart to modify the starting behaviour:\nsudo echo \"manual\" >> /etc/init/mysql.override\n\nFor more info, see the section \"Disabling a Job from Automatically Starting\" in the Upstart Cookbook.\nAs Apache still uses the traditional SysV init scripts you can use\nsudo update-rc.d -f apache2 remove\n\nto remove the links from /etc/rcX.d or, alternatively use\nsudo update-rc.d apache2 disable\n\nwhich \"disables\" the script by changing it from a start script to a stop script. This is reversible by \nsudo update-rc.d apache2 enable\n\n\nMost of this information I got from here: https://askubuntu.com/a/40077/24678\n\nA: To prevent mysql from starting on boot:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the terminal: Ctrl+Alt+T\n\n*Open the mysql.conf file: nano /etc/init/mysql.conf\n\n*Comment out the start on line near the top of the file, the start on might be spread across two lines, so comment out both.

From Applications -> Ubuntu Software Center search for \"boot up manager\". After installing you will find it in the System -> Administration -> BootUP-Manager. Another is Webmin. Webmin uses your browser. After installing point your browser to https://localhost:10000/ Look for services and work it from there.\n\nA: Well I am using Ubuntu 20.04 on my laptop. The problem I faced is that mysql service starts at boot up and takes 32 seconds to move to the next step in the sequence of bootup. So I decided to disable it from the boot sequence to make it boot faster. For this I followed the below steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*I checked for mysql running status by command:\nsudo service mysql status\nThe result showed the status as in the snippet shown below.

Cheers.\n\nA: Or if your really laze like me you could just open a Terminal session and then type: \nsudo perl -pi.orig -e 's/start\\s+on/#start\\s+on/' /etc/init/mysql.conf && sudo perl -pi.orig -e 's/and\\s+/#and/g' /etc/init/mysql.conf\n\nYou can then just issue a reboot command then your system will boot-up without mysql started. \n\nA: Actually, there is also another method to accomplish this, via the sysv-rc-conf tool.\nYou can install it by typing\nsudo apt-get install sysv-rc-conf\n\nIt allows you to take control over all available services, including running/stopping them in place and configuring services' operation per runlevel.\nEdit: You have to run tis tool as root:\nsudo sysv-rc-conf\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 18.04, sudo systemctl disable mysql will prevent mysql-server from autostarting on boot.\nFor linux, there are 3 main init systems: Systemd, Upstart and SysV. Although nearly all Linux systems run on Systemd. The other two init systems might also co-exist in your system.\nFor Systemd, use command sudo systemctl disable mysql;\nFor Upstart, use echo manual >> /etc/init/mysql.override;\nFor SysV, run the following command sudo update-rc.d mysql disable\nIf you'd like to find which init system is running on your server, please read this answer.\n\nA: Since 15.04 you can simply do:\nsudo systemctl disable mysql\n\n\nA: You can use chkconfig tool package\n$ chkconfig --level 345 mysqld off\n\n", "Q: Chrome quick list open specific website I have managed to get quick list showing for chrome, however I would like to add a link which opens chrome and goes to a certain website.

It should not ever be a problem with the released version of Ubuntu, so it will only be a problem with -updates/-security and with the current dev release. Basically what happens is squid gets the Packages.bz2 from one mirror, and then later it is updated but your cache doesn't get it, leading to files missing or what appears to be a corrupt Packages.bz2.\n", "Q: Recovering \"My Pictures\" folder on Windows using Ubuntu My windows partition got infected with a virus so I can't boot in Windows.

Fortunately it's relatively painless, but appears to be a little daunting.\nThe first thing to do is install the dhcp server. sudo apt-get install dhcp3-server should achieve this.\nOnce it's installed, you need to set what interfaces it should run on. To do this, you need to edit the /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server file on 12.04 (pre-12.04 the file may be called dhcp3-server). To do this, run sudo nano /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server. It should have a line like this:\nINTERFACES=\"\"\nchange it to match your interface name, in your case bnep0:\nINTERFACES=\"bnep0\"\nuse CTRL+O (thats o as in onion, not 0 as in 10) to save the file and CTRL+Q to quit\nnext you need to set up the DHCP server.

To verify, try\necho \"http_proxy = http://www-cache.uni-mannheim.de:3128/\" | sudo tee -a /etc/wgetrc\necho \"use_proxy = on\" | sudo tee -a /etc/wgetrc\nwget http://www.google.com/\n\nIf this works, you should perhaps use the provided vpn connection instead (it probably supports more protocols). Alternatively, you have to instruct all relevant software to use this proxy.\nDon't forget to remove those two lines from /etc/wgetrc once you're done with the testing.\n", "Q: Unable to log-in using Ubuntu One Files with the Android application I installed the Ubuntu One Files Android app to my phone(Samsung I5800).

Been pulling my hair out forever searching for an answer that isn't needlessly complicated.\nInstall and use Open Broadcaster Software (aka OBS Studio).

My tutorial is in the context of recording the audio from a Google Hangouts call, but the same concepts apply to anything.

My laptop has been freezing and going to black screen of death when I run anything related to display (Share desktop, stream video, etc).

It gave an error before login saying \"select the recovery mode\" and after clicking OK, it didn't give the same error on reboot but I've lost the 11.04 graphical interface and all I see is the interface of Ubuntu v10 with slow visuals (even scrolling up/down on browser is really slow).

Is there a way (preferrable via GUI, but may be via command line) to extract a zip file and delete the zip after extracted, all in a single command?\n(I remember I saw someone doing something like this in the command line one day)\n\nA: It's pretty easy through a shell command:\nunzip <filename>.zip && rm <filename>.zip\nPerhaps, if you're using nautilus, you could create a relevant nautilus-action in order to automate the command through a GUI selection.\n\nA: For a GUI I'd say the easiest way is a nautilus script. The main line of which would be:\nunzip \"$item\" && trash \"$item\"\n\nIt works in bash/dash just as easy. In nautilus the whole thing would look like this:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n# Nautilus script to unzip and then remove a zip archive.\n# Nautilus script usually go in \"$HOME/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts\"\n\nIFS='\n'\nfor item in $NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS; do\n    if [ -n \"$(file -b \"$item\" | grep -o 'Zip')\" ]; then\n        unzip \"$item\" && trash \"$item\"\n        # use trash instead of rm to move them to trash\n        # (trash-cli package installed)\n    fi\ndone\n\n\nA: You could simply write a bash script. It will look something like this:\nunzip $1 && rm $1\n\nwhere $1 is the argument with a value of your zip file's filename. Then alias unzip command in ~/.bashrc file to run this script.

I assume that I am administrator as I am the only user of the machine and can use sudo in terminal. What am I doing wrong?\n\nA: That is a known bug. You can remove the residual config files without synaptic using this handy one-liner:\naptitude -F %p search '~c' | xargs sudo dpkg -P\n\nYou may have to install aptitude if you haven't done that yet.\n\nA: If you have sudo privileges, try:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge banshee evolution\nIt should do the same thing as what you would do in Synaptic. You can do this for all packages with remaining configs.\n", "Q: Bring nohup job to foreground Consider the following nohup execution:\nnohup script.sh > script.out &\n\nIs there a way to log off the terminal, reconnect, bring the process back to foreground and interact with it using the keyboard?\n\nA: If you wanted to start a script, have it run without the output bothering your terminal and then bring it up later to interact with it, you might want to take a look at a terminal multiplexer. Depending on your system I would recommend tmux or screen. You can find some info on how to use them in the links below:\ntmux:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Tmux Primer\n\n*A Quick and Easy Guide to tmux\n\n*Tmux Cheat Sheet & Quick Reference\nscreen:\n\n\n*\n\n*Screen - Community Ubuntu Documentation\n\n*GNU Screen: an introduction and beginner's tutorial\n\n*screen keyboard shortcuts\nedit: added links for tmux primers\n\nA: I'll second the use of a terminal multiplexer, but tmux, not screen. Screen is, for all intents and purposes, unmaintained. Its configuration is a dark art, likely first recorded in an appendix of the Necronomicon. Attempting to write your own config is as a glimpse of Cthulu. Seriously. Look around at people's .screenrc files. To be sure, there are ways to mediate screen's abomination of a config flle. Byobu does an admirable job as the veil between mortal users and unholy code. It comes with sensible colours, a menu interface, and perhaps most importantly, a status bar.\nBut as I said, I recommend tmux instead. It still requires some minor configuration,  but it is well documented, and your config file won't look like gibberish. Also, you start out with colours and a status bar. Compare my screenrc and tmux.conf files:\n\n\n*\n\n*screenrc\n\n*tmux.conf\n\nA: nohup does not disconnect a command from terminal, it makes your script ignore SIGHUP, and redirects stdout/stderr to a file nohup.out, so that the command can continue running in the background after you log out.\nnohup does not automatically put the command it runs in the background. One must do that explicitly, by ending the command line with an &.\n$ nohup ./script.sh &\n[1] 3390\n$ nohup: ignoring input and appending output to ‘nohup.out’\n\njobs can print currently running jobs and their status. If the command jobs cannot find it, then it is no longer a child process of that shell.\n$ jobs \n[1]+  Running                 nohup ./script.sh &\n\nOne can be bring back a background job to foreground in bash using fg even if it is run with nohup. But that won't change the output redirection, which will still be going to the file nohup.out.\n$ fg\nnohup ./script.sh\n\nIf you close the shell/terminal or log off, your command is no longer a child of that shell. It belongs to init process. If you search in pstree you'll see it is now owned by process 1 (init). That cannot be brought back to the foreground because the foreground no longer exists.\n\nA: If you are just interested in looking live hat the output this might suit you:\nnohup script.sh 2>&1 script.out &\n# later:\ntail -f script.out\n\n\nA: Any Linux command can be sent to the background with '&' appended at the last.\nTo view all the background jobs, you can issue jobs \njobs\n[1]  + suspended  nohup sh zookeeper-server-start.sh ../config/zookeeper.properties\n[2]    running    nohup sh kafka-server-start.sh ../config/server.properties\n[3]  - running    nohup sudo mongod --dbpath=/var/lib/mongodb\n\nHere I am running 3 jobs in background: zookeeper, kafka and mongo daemon.\n[1],[2] and [3] are respective job numbers for these tasks.\nYou can bring those task to foreground using fg %$taskNumber.\n", "Q: Find installed dictionary I installed dict-freedict english-french from Ubuntu Software Center. Synaptic Package Manager shows it installed in Section: Word Processing (universe) but I cannot locate it. Thank you. \n\nA: In synaptic, you can select an installed package, right click, and select 'Properties'. There should be a tab named 'Files' that lists out all of the files contained in the package. This should tell you where your files were installed too.\n\nA: I hope you are are looking for the application. But dict-freedict english-french is only the database.

I got to install Ubuntu 11.04 64bit.\nThanks everyone for the help.\n\nA: If the monitor goes to sleep when you are in the BIOS screen (before any OS is loaded), then it's a hardware or (more strange) a BIOS issue.\nTry to update your computer BIOS as the last resort. I fear that the most likely cause is a hardware problem (either monitor or video card related).\n", "Q: How to set up vnc server? I want to set up a vncserver on my machine. I need each remote user to start separate session - so they see the login screen after connecting, log in, and so on - without interrupting another users.\nHow this can be done?\n\nA: VNC Server does not show you the login screen - instead it takes you straight to the desktop, after you have logged in. If your goal is make sure that the users can log in remotely with a GUI without interrupting the other users who are already logged in, here is what you need to do.\nFirst, install vnc onto your machine.\nsudo apt-get install vnc4server\n\nFor each user, you can make them set a vnc password\nvncpasswd\n\nthat asks for a password. Afterwards, each user can log in remotely (via the command line) and set up their own VNC server:\nvncserver\n\nThis will output something like \n\nNew 'machine:1 (user)' desktop is machine:1\nCreating default startup script /home/user/.vnc/xstartup\n  Starting applications specified in /home/user/.vnc/xstartup\n  Log file is /home/user/.vnc/machine:1.log\n\nOnce this is done, each user can log in to the GUI of their respective accounts using your machine's ip address and the desktop session number. In the above example, if the IP address of the machine is 10.0.0.1 then you can can put 10.0.0.1:1 as the server to connect to in the VNC client.\n", "Q: unity home quicklist not working hello i have tried adding some quicklists to the unity launcher i added some to the gnome-terminal and they work fine added some to the nautilus-home but cannot get them to display here is my .desktop file\n    [Desktop Entry]\nName=Home Folder\nComment=Open your personal folder\nTryExec=nautilus\nExec=nautilus --no-desktop\nIcon=user-home\nTerminal=false\nStartupNotify=true\nType=Application\nCategories=GNOME;GTK;Core;\nOnlyShowIn=GNOME;Unity\nX-GNOME-Bugzilla-Bugzilla=GNOME\nX-GNOME-Bugzilla-Product=nautilus\nX-GNOME-Bugzilla-Component=general\nX-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=nautilus\nX-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=bin;Documents;Downloads;Pictures;Video;Music;Ubuntu One;src;\n\n[bin Desktop Shortcut Group]\nName=bin\nExec=nautilus bin\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[Documents Desktop Shortcut Group]\nName=Documents\nExec=nautilus Documents\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[Downloads Desktop Shortcut Group]\nName=Downloads\nExec=nautilus Downloads\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[Pictures Desktop Shortcut Group]\nName=Pictures\nExec=nautilus Pictures\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[Video Desktop Shortcut Group]\nName=Video\nExec=nautilus Video\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[Music Desktop Shortcut Group]\nName=Music\nExec=nautilus Music\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[Ubuntu One Desktop Shortcut Group]\nName=Ubuntu One\nExec=nautilus Ubuntu\\ One\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[src Desktop Shortcut Group]\nName=src\nExec=nautilus src\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n\nA: A few things wrong - here is a suggested revision:\n[Desktop Entry]\n\nName=Home Folder\nComment=Open your personal folder\nTryExec=nautilus\nExec=nautilus --no-desktop\nIcon=user-home\nTerminal=false\nStartupNotify=true\nType=Application\nCategories=GNOME;GTK;Core;\nOnlyShowIn=GNOME;Unity\nX-GNOME-Bugzilla-Bugzilla=GNOME\nX-GNOME-Bugzilla-Product=nautilus\nX-GNOME-Bugzilla-Component=general\nX-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=nautilus\n\nX-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=bin;Documents;Downloads;Pictures;Video;Music;UbuntuOne;src;\n\n[bin Shortcut Group]\nName=bin\nExec=nautilus bin\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[Documents Shortcut Group]\nName=Documents\nExec=nautilus Documents\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[Downloads Shortcut Group]\nName=Downloads\nExec=nautilus Downloads\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[Pictures Shortcut Group]\nName=Pictures\nExec=nautilus Pictures\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[Video Shortcut Group]\nName=Video\nExec=nautilus Video\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[Music Shortcut Group]\nName=Music\nExec=nautilus Music\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[UbuntuOne Shortcut Group]\nName=Ubuntu One\nExec=nautilus \"Ubuntu One\"\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n[src Shortcut Group]\nName=src\nExec=nautilus src\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\nSuggested changes:\n\n\n*\n\n*the group names (the bits between the square brackets) cannot have spaces\n\n*I've quoted \"Ubuntu One\" - not sure if necessary but makes it easier to read.\n\n\nA: Two things,\n\n\n*\n\n*You have a tab between the \"T\" and \"arget...\" in your \"bin\" entry.\n\n*I could be wrong, but I don't think the shortcut group entries can have spaces.

It works in principle but there is one issue that forced me to stick with Ubuntu 8.04 (for now):\nWhen the guest VM is Microsoft Windows (2K, XP), the mouse cursor turns from an arrow to a hand when it hovers over the Task Bar (or close to it -- The problem is not limited to the Task Bar area but rather to an arbitrary margin on the outer side of the desktop. This margin can be as wide as 1/8 of the guest's desktop.). When the mouse moves, this hand cursor blinks and the system doesn't respond to mouse clicks. When the hand cursor blinks, the Num Lock LED on my keyboard blinks as well.\nWhen I move the mouse cursor back to \"the desktop area\" (as defined in the highlighted text above), it functions normally.\nThat is, the problem exists only outside that \"desktop area\".\nObviously, this makes it very difficult (read: impossible) for me to use the Start Menu, SysTray and the rest of the Task Bar.\nMy workaround for now is to launch programs via their Desktop shortcuts or via the keyboard.\nNote: The same exact VMWare Workstation 6.5.5 (64-bit) on Ubuntu 8.04 (64-bit) doesn't exhibit this problem.\nAnyone seen this problem before? Do you know of a solution (or better workaround) to this problem?\n\nA: The issue you have described is a known issue since Karmic and also occurs on Lucid.\nThe solution is to start vmware but also force VMWare to use the GTK mouse i.e.\nexport VMWARE_USE_SHIPPED_GTK=yes && vmware \n\nAlternatively, you can edit /etc/vmware/bootstrap to put the above exported environment variable before it invokes vmware.\n", "Q: How do I set up Aqemu / kvm tap device?

If you have 2GBs of RAM or less, you should probably stick with 32-bits, as 64-bit applications use more memory and some apps don't have 64-bit versions (you may run most 32-bit apps by installing ia32-libs, however)\nIf you have 4GBs or more of RAM, however, you should definitely move to 64-bit. The 32-bit kernel can't address more than 3GBs of RAM on most computers, and although you can install the PAE kernel which can address +3GBs of RAM, the future is obviously 64-bit :)\n\nA: Congratulations!  It sounds like you have a nice system.\nI started out with the 32-bit version because it was my first time with Ubuntu (and Linux) and that was the recommended download, but after using it for awhile I decided to see how the 64-bit version would perform (I had the RAM and the processor for it).  I found that the 64-bit version was sometimes slightly faster, and it has been very stable (so was the 32-bit version).  I have been told that there are a few things that don't run on the 64-bit version, but I haven't found anything that wouldn't run on it except for one piece of hardware.\nIt was a Linksys USB wireless antenna.  Finding the 32-bit drivers had been tough and then installation was somewhat involved (for someone new to Linux), but it worked.  I could not get it to work at all with 64-bit Ubuntu.  Fortunately, I didn't really need it and so have been pleased to stay with the 64-bit Ubuntu.\nHowever, you should be careful of such things.  If you have room (and I imagine you do), install 64-bit Ubuntu alongside the 32-bit version and see if everything works, and it'll also give you the opportunity to compare speed and stability.\n\nA: You should definitely go with 64-bit. 2 Years ago I would have cautioned against this due to lack of support for certain applications and hardware devices but now this is almost a non-issue. When you use a 64-bit OS, you can use 16GB RAM, which is great for actualization (running multiple operating systems concurrently under your Linux installation).\n", "Q: Scrolling with Trackpad I have a Lenovo G550, I want to activate the scrolling (right border) of my touchpad.\nIt works with Windows, but in Ubuntu I can't find the way to do it.\nI see \"Mouse config\", Scrolling is activated but it doens't work.\nAny idea?\n\nA: Press Alt + F2 and paste gnome-mouse-properties.  \nThen go to touchpad and select \"Edge scrolling\".  \n\n", "Q: Prevent kernel modules  filesystems; (xfs,jfs,reiserfs) from loading I noticed just about all the file system modules are loaded by default on boot - filesystems I'll never use.

Have you started gparted before checking or are you on a live system maybe?\n\nA: One reason for these filesystem modules being loaded is down to a package called os-prober which is used by grub-common to detect other OSes on attached disks (specifically in /usr/lib/os-probes/init/10filesystems). This gets called by grub2 related packages and other system updates.\nHowever the filesystem check (and the subsequent loading of the modules) can be disabled on a system by adding the following line to the grub config file /etc/default/grub:\nGRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=true\n\nThen one needs to run the update-grub command to update /boot/grub/grub.cfg:\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: How can I cluster two machines to double the processing power?

If I install ubuntu, can I install the server afterwards?  Like, I install ubuntu on one partition then use apt-get or something similar to get the server?\n\nA: What's the difference between desktop and server?\n1) The first difference is in the CD contents. The \"Server\" CD avoids including what Ubuntu considers desktop packages (packages like X, Gnome or KDE), but does include server related packages (Apache2, Bind9 and so on).   \n2) The Ubuntu Server Edition installation process is slightly different from the Desktop Edition. Since by default Ubuntu Server doesn't have a GUI, the process is menu driven, very similar to the Alternate CD installation process.\n3) Ubuntu server installs a server-optimized kernel by default.\n4) Ubuntu Desktop will receive 3 years of support, while Ubuntu Server will be supported for 5 years.\n\nIf I install ubuntu, can I install the server afterwards?\nYes, you can do this by donwloading and burning the server cd and installing it in another partition.   \nOtherwise, you can just use apt-get to install the packages you need like Apache and Bind9 for example.  \nReference: 1.\n", "Q: How do I run a graphical application in a virtual console besides ?

Maybe I am not opening multiple screens correctly? here is an example:\n$ screen rtorrent # works fine - I can move around with the arrow keys and the page refreshes when things like the download rate change\n$ ctrl a+d # exit rtorrent and return to the shell\n$ screen cp /tmp/x1 /tmp/x2 # assume x1 is very large so this takes a long time\n$ ctrl a+d # exit the copying and return to the shell\n$ screen -ls\nThere are screens on:\n        26608.pts-0.hostname (18/08/11 10:15:39)     (Detached)\n        8329.pts-0.hostname  (17/08/11 13:44:00)     (Detached)\n2 Sockets in /var/run/screen/S-username.\n$ screen -r 8329.pts-0.hostname # resume rtorrent and now it is frozen - I cannot move around with arrow keys and the page never updates\n\nI have a feeling this problem is reproducible - you could try using screen top instead of my copying example above.\nIs there some control command I can use in screen to fix it or should I run rtorrent with more screen options in the first place?\nI am using rtorrent version 0.8.2 and screen version 4.00.03jw4 (FAU) 2-May-06\n\nA: it turns out that the copy command was maxing out the usb connection. I have a dodgy USB hub which is unpowered and seems to run at usb1.1 speeds - I was saving the downloads from rtorrent onto an external hard drive over this usb1.1 connection whilst also copying files from this drive to another drive.\nNow that I have figured out that the hub was slow I removed it and the two instances of screen (rtorrent and cp) work fine together. Neither of them freezes :)\n", "Q: Arithmetic binary operators -gt, -lt give error but work in a shell script I wrote this simple script it works too but shows an error\nclear\necho Enter 1st number\nread n1\necho Enter 2nd number\nread n2\necho MUlti is `expr $n1 \\* $n2`;\nif [$n1 -lt $n2]\nthen\n echo $n1 'is bigger than' $n2\nelse\n echo $n2 'is bigger than' $n1\nfi\n\noutput\nEnter 1st number\n5\nEnter 2nd number\n10\nMUlti is 50\n./script.sh: line 7: [5: command not found\n10 is bigger than 5\n\n\nA: The [ is a command builtin, also known as test, and as all commands requires at least a space to separate it from other words in the command. [ is also available as a regular command in /usr/bin/[ or /usr/bin/test.\nThe presence of a final ] is instead a requirement of the command, when invoked as [, and the spaces around it are required as for every parameter of a command.\nThat said, in bash you should use the command [[, that has some avantages over [, like for example supporting && and || for logical operations, beside -a and -o.\nMoreover, to do integer arithmetic operations and comparison between integers it is better to use arithmetic expansions $((math operations)), and the corresponding command ((math ops)).\nWith these observations, your script could be:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nclear\necho \"Enter 1st number\"\nread n1\necho \"Enter 2nd number\"\nread n2\necho \"Multi is $((n1 * n2))\"\nif ((n1 > n2)); then\n  echo \"$n1 is bigger than $n2\"\nelse\n  echo \"$n2 is bigger than $n1\"\nfi\n\nRemember to make it executable (chmod +x my-script), then execute it with ./my-script.\n\nA: For bash conditional if statements, you need to have a whitespace right before and right after your condition. Yours should look like:\nif [ $n1 -lt $n2 ]\n\ninstead of\nif [$n1 -lt $n2]\n\nGoofy, but that's the bash shell. \n", "Q: Is there any differences between Gnome-Global menu and Appmenu-indicator? I'm wondering that is there any differences between Gnome-Global menu and Appmenu-indicator? Or are they just only one? Which one is still being developed?\n\nA: Global menu is old and I don't think it is being actively developed anymore.\nApplication Menu is under very active development by the Ubuntu community and Canonical employees. \nApplication Menu supports way more apps than the old global menu.\n\nA: appmenu-indicator is designed to be a desktop agnostic way to provide for a \"global menu\" from GNOME, GTK, and QT applications.\ngnome-global-menu is GNOME/GTK specific.\nThat is just the surface. Programatically, there are several underlying fundamental differences.\nThe loose description of each might seem the same but I would focus on appmenu-indicator in Ubuntu for the best integration of all \"Ubuntu provided\" software.\n", "Q: How to delete file(s) in secure manner? Is there a way to make sure that a deleted file can not be recovered? \nAs you know, deleting a file by pressing shift-del or using trash doesn't mean that file is gone forever. It resides somewhere in the computer.\nIn day to day life, law enforcement or thieves use recovery programs to reveal our private data or something else. \nThey can recover all data that resides on hard disk, in RAM, and even USB.\nTo protect us from these people, what should one do? Which program should one use?\nNote: I don't want an answer like first use a recovery program then erase that file with shred. With just one program, I want to erase all unused/deleted files on my computer.\n\nA: If you want a solution which can't be thwarted by a pathologically obsessed individual then you should consider some combination (limited by monetary resources) of:\n\n\n*\n\n*degaussing -- magnetically erasing the hard drive\n\n*physically disabling the hard drive -- i.e. industrial hole punch\n\n*acid bath <-- you can't get bits from a pile of goo.\n\n\nThese solutions range drastically in cost & ingenuity.  A few:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.semshred.com/hard_drive_crusher\n\n*http://www.edrsolutions.com/solution.asp\n\n*http://www.doc-res.com/hard-drive-destruction.shtm\n\nA: For SSDs and other flash storage media\nSSDs and many other flash storage media use a technique called “wear levelling” that reassigns unused blocks of storage cells based on their number of previous write cycles to prolong the drive’s life time. As a consequence, overwriting block ranges doesn’t work as a method to erase storage content securely (or even efficiently) like it does for hard disk drives. On the other hand, flash storage allows much faster and efficient secure erasure of blocks, block ranges, or entire drives.\nErase the entire drive\n\nYou should use the drive's security erase feature.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Make sure the drive security supports secure erause1 and is not “frozen”. If it is, it may help to suspend and resume the computer.\n$ sudo hdparm -I /dev/sdX | grep frozen\n       not     frozen \n\nThe (filtered) command output means that this drive supports secure erasure, is ”not frozen” and you can continue.\n  \n*Set a User Password (Eins in this example). This password is cleared too, the exact choice does not matter.\nsudo hdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass Eins /dev/sdX\n\n  \n*Issue the ATA Secure Erase command.\nsudo hdparm --user-master u --security-erase Eins /dev/sdX\n\nSee the ATA Secure Erase article in the Linux kernel wiki for complete instructions including troubleshooting.\n\n(source)\nIf the command output in step 1 is empty the drive does not support secure erasure but may still support the TRIM command required for the section below.\nErase a drive partition\nThe blkdiscard(8)2 can erase block devices securely if the drive supports it1:\nsudo blkdiscard --secure /dev/sdXN\n\nwhere /dev/sdXN is the path to the block device node referring to the drive or partition to erase.\n\n1 If your drive is inside an external casing with a USB or FireWire connection the translation chipset may block support of some optional features like secure erasure and TRIM even if the enclosed drive supports it.\n2 Available and installed by default since Ubuntu Xenial Xerus (16.04).\n\nA: There isn't one command that you can run which will easily clean up all the already-deleted files for you. However, there are a number of things you can do to reduce your vulnerability to this sort of attack in future.\nAs others have said, using tools like shred or srm allows you to delete a specific file by actually overwriting it, rather than just removing it from the filesystem. If you're feeling bold, you can replace the rm command with shred or srm to securely delete files going forward. That means that whenever you (or another program) tries to delete something using rm, the secure delete command will run instead.\nHowever, if you're using a solid state disk, or even some newer mechanical disks, shred and other overwriting-based methods may not be effective, since the disk may not actually write where you think it's writing (source).\n\nFull-Disk Encryption\nA more convenient option is full-disk encryption. If you use the alternate installer, Ubuntu can automatically set up a fully-encrypted disk for you you, but you can also customize and configure the settings yourself. Once installed, the encryption is almost invisible to you: after you enter the passphrase (be sure to pick a good, long one) when the computer starts up, everything looks and feels just like normal Ubuntu.\nYou can also encrypt external media like USB drives using Ubuntu's Disk Utility. Setting up an encrypted external disk is as simple as checking the \"encrypt underlying filesystem\" box when formatting the disk. You can even store the passphrase on your (encrypted) keyring, so that you don't need to enter the phrase every time you plug that disk into your computer.\nIf your whole disk -- and all your removable media -- is encrypted, there's much less to worry about. A thief or police officer would need to swipe your computer while it's on, (or within a minute or two of turning it off if they're very good) in order to access your data. If you hibernate (rather than suspend) your computer when it's not in use, then you should be pretty safe.\nIf you ever need to completely destroy all your data, you don't need to do a Gutmann wipe of your whole disk. Simply overwrite the very beginning of the disk, to destroy the headers for the encrypted volume. Unlike with a regular filesystem, this will actually make it impossible to recover the data.\n\nSo, how do you go from your current setup to a safely encrypted disk? It's quite a challenge to retrofit a currently-installed operating system to use an encrypted disk. The easiest approach is to backup all your data and settings, then reinstall with an encrypted disk. When backing up, make sure to back up your data to an encrypted external drive, but don't save the passphrase in your keyring.\nAfter you've backed everything up, you may want to aggressively wipe your hard drive, to make sure that none of your existing data can be recovered in the future. If you're using an SSD, the process is even more challenging, so depending how much you want to invest in the process, it might be worth destroying your current disk (a challenging proposition) and starting with a new one.\nWhen reinstalling the OS, if you haven't aggressively wiped the disk already, you should make sure to completely fill the new encrypted partition, which will overwrite all your old data. Once you've restored your backup, you may want to aggressively wipe the start of the backup disk, to destroy the encryption header, so that it can't be recovered again.\n\nA: I would say the the solution is a combination of several answers given here. For already-deleted files and partitions still in use, I agree with Matt.\nThen, for the future I would suggest to start using secure-delete tools instead of simple 'rm'.\nLast, when it will be possible to reformat the partition, the option of encrypt the partition should be considered. Perhaps using some approach that offers Plausible deniability like in Truecrypt\n\nA: Update:  If you have not yet deleted the file that you want to be non-recoverable, use the accepted answer.  If, however, you already deleted the file[s], then this is the next best method that I know of. \nIf I read you right, you want to erase all your previously deleted files.  Here is a simple way to do that:\n$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/mounted/partition/tmp_file bs=1M count=999999999999\n\nLet that run till it complains till it gets a disk write error [out of space].  Then delete the file!  What this does is just fill up your empty disk with 000s, so all your previous files get overwritten.  Make sure to delete the file now, or you will not have any disk left. You might want to do this a few times if you are really paranoid.  Or if you want to write random to your disk, I'd suggest replace /dev/zero with /dev/urandom.  \nHowever, this will take much much longer, so I'd run it overnight.  Also, if you want a progress meter, do this instead:\n$ free=$( df {PARTITION OR MOUNTPOINT}  |awk '{print $3}'|tail -1 )\n$ dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=999999999999 | pv -s \"$free\" > /path/to/mounted/partition/tmp_file\n\nFirst you are getting your free disk space with du, awk, and tail, then using dd to get /dev/zero, piping that to pv which stands for \"pipe viewer\", that redirects everything to tmp_file\nOnce again, delete the file afterwards.  $ rm tmp_file\nAnyway, hope someone finds this useful! :)\n\nA: Shred\nThis command line tool is already installed from the core utilities in Ubuntu to securely erase and overwrite single files using the Gutman method.\nFast shredding\nshred -vzn 0 /dev/sdc1\n\nerases whole partitions by overwriting everything with 0s in a single iteration. If no legal aspects require another procedure, doing so is most probably safe to securely delete your private data.\nfrom Craig Wright Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2008, 5352, 243-257.\nSecure shredding\nshred -vzn 3 /dev/sdc1\n\nerases the whole partition using 3 iterations with random numbers. In addition (option -z) this writes zeros to hide the shredding process at the end. This will take 4 times longer than the fast method.\nNOTE: By shredding a partition we will overwrite this partition with 0 or random numbers. It therefore efficiently deletes everything including file system caches on that partition forever. This can also be used to remove unwanted remnants of deleted files. Files we want to keep will have to be backed up before shredding.\n\nWipe\n\nMore options, and the possibility of erasing directories in addition to single files, are offered by this command line utility.\nwipe filename\nwipe -r dirname\n\n\nAdditional notes on journaling file systems and SSDs:\n\n*\n\n*Please read the notes in the linked manpages on security issues arising from still recoverable backups in journaling file systems when erasing single files. Overwriting whole partitions rather than single files will effectively erase all data even when using a journaling file system.\n\n\n*Erasing data on a solid state disk (SSD) can if at all only be done by overwriting the whole drive (not only single partitions) with several iterations. Some SSDs may have an inbuilt feature to erase data but this may not always be efficient (see this link from comment). At present there is no general recommendation on the wiping processes or number of erase iterations needed to securely remove all data remnants on all SSDs available.\nThese options can be added in the context menu of Nautilus and Thunar.\n\n*\n\n*In Thunar, open \"Edit\" then \"Configure Custom Actions\"\n\nAdd (the plus sign)\nName \"Shred File\"\nDescription whatever you like\nAction \"shred -u %f\"\nSimilarly for wipe.\n\n*\n\n*For Nautilus see this question and those related\n\nSelect \"Appearance Conditions\" and select \"Other Files\"\n\nA: First, delete files with rm on the terminal or with shift-delete on nautilus.\nBetter yet, use srm, from the Secure-Delete tools package.\nYou can install the secure delete tools like this:\napt-get install secure-delete\n\nSecond, use sfill to wipe out unused space on your disk:\nsudo sfill -f <directory>\n\nThis will take some time, since it is using crypto techniques to fill out the disk.\nWarning: this is going through your whole filesystem, and you are root. Use with care!\nThis will create a file which wipes out all previously existing data. The file will be created in <directory>.\n\nA: A GUI program for this is BleachBit (it's also in the sources). More recent (deb file) version at the BleachBit Sourceforge page.\nBeyond simply deleting files, it includes advanced features such as shredding files to prevent recovery, wiping free disk space to hide traces of files deleted by other applications.\n\n\"BleachBit quickly frees disk space and tirelessly guards your privacy.\n  Free cache, delete cookies, clear Internet history, shred temporary\n  files, delete logs, and discard junk you didn't know was there.\n  Designed for Linux and Windows systems, it wipes clean 90 applications\n  including Firefox (vacuuming to make it faster), Internet Explorer, \n  Adobe Flash, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari and more.\" (from http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/)\n\nBleachBit has several advanced cleaners:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clear the memory and swap on Linux\n\n*Delete broken shortcuts on Linux\n\n*Delete the Firefox URL history without deleting the whole file—with optional shredding\n\n*Find widely-scatted junk such as Thumbs.db and .DS_Store files.\n\n*Delete the OpenOffice.org recent documents list without deleting the whole Common.xcu file\n\n*Overwrite free disk space to hide previously files\n\n*Vacuum Firefox, Google Chrome, Liferea, Thunderbird, and Yum databases: shrink files without removing data to save space and improve speed\n\n*Surgically remove private information from .ini and JSON configuration files with deleting the whole file\n\n\nFor details on how to use Bleachbit to delete securely specific files and folders\nsee this answer.\n\nA: I use truecrypt file image for such essential data. I't handy, free, crossplatform and I don't need a full disk nor using any extra software to \"really delete\" the file. \nJust make sure you have strong password and make make backup of the image file. I keep backup in a cloud. \n\nA: *\n\n*The first option is shred. The previous answer in regards to shred is lacking some needed details. You will not overcome the file system caching, snapshots and journaling, etc. if you run shred on the partition (as in the example of sdc5), and data will remain, lots of it potentially.\nFor shred to be effective, especially on modern SSD's etc, you must run it on the device not the partition. This would be /dev/sdc ... without a number on the end (partition number).\nYou will need to do this from a live USB if the drive you wish to clean is the primary device for your computer. In this case, you will be best to add persistence to the live USB when you create it so that you can download a few extra tools to do the job properly also.\nRun the command: sudo shred -vfxz /dev/sdc or sda or whatever the device name is. If you are unsure of name, open Disks or GParted to identify your device, or run the command-  lsblk in the terminal and identify the name of your device there. \nAdding the letters f and x to the command is important as f= force permissions and x=exact size of files. Without these you may miss data that required permission to read or write, or miss data when the file is rounded up to the block size.\nYou can add a desired number of write passes by adding -n (number you desire). Example: sudo shred -vfxz -n 5 /dev/sdc\nThis is the first port of call to wipe your drive. It may help to run similar tools such as shrub, secure-delete and nwipe. They all work in the same way with very similar commands and slightly different methods and patterns. Go to the Linux man page or Google them to quickly become familiar with how to use the commands. It is not likely you will need more than the standard 4 shred passes, but if it is important you might as well go the extra mile as it could possibly help.\n\n*Your RAM may well have data on it. After installing secure-delete, run the command for sdmem. This will wipe your RAM memory. However the first data you ever filled the RAM with, plus any data that stayed in RAM for prolonged periods, may well have left a trace.\nWhen buying new RAM(or HD's/SSD's for that matter), it is best to fill the drive to completion a few times. You could use shred, but dd     is probably better here. Command:\nsudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/ # (insert your device partion name)\n\nIt is also best with RAM to repeat this procedure before using sensitive data if you want to increase your security, and wipe sensitive data from RAM as quickly as possible afterwards. It is this time left in place that is mostly responsible for its ability to leave a trace.\nThe only thing left to do is create a partition or install your next distro.\n\n*Encryption - People often state this as a reliable method, but if you are going to continue to use your hard drive or pass it on to someone else, this is not an effective option. With regard to legal trouble, failing to unlock an encrypted device is often not an option and can be presumed guilt or an actual offense in many places. It may stop a thief, etc. though (stealing data only lol).\nAlso note, an encrypted home folder is very different and protects nothing from physically being examined on your computer, it is for online/system safety essentially and can be circumvented.\n\n*If disposing of the device - After wiping with shred, then encrypting with a long password that contains special characters like * etc. to break up the letters and numbers of your password, use shred again but you can just specify the first 10gig of the drive (depends on size, but this is a large safe number). Example: sudo shred -vfxzs10G /dev/sdc This is quicker and just as effective as shredding the whole drive in these circumstances.\nThen to be sure, take the hard drive and RAM out, the RAM is easy to snap and destroy, SSDs are too. You can get creative and release that paranoid energy while breaking them.\n\nA: You can use DD to secure erase a file, good luck recovering it when you do that.  See an example on this site.\nHere is the command to secure wipe a file (Adjust the bs=xx parameter)\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/test/myfile.txt bs=27 count=1 conv=notrunc\n\nwhere bs=## is how much random data to write to a file in bytes (must match the size of the file being overwritten, enter file size in bytes as seen in ls -l command) \n", "Q: Manage ubuntu 11.10 desktop from server webconsole Are there any alternatives to Ubuntu landscape as I want to manage ubuntu desktops of different version 10.04,11.04 and 11.10\n\nA: With so many desktops, why don't you contact Canonical? They're experts. It's what they do. You're not saying why you're looking for an alternative to Landscape. You're actually not saying much at all. \nIf you just want to manage users, storage, etc, then an LDAP+NFS-setup might be appropriate and you have lots of software to manage those services. If you want to upgrade many computers at the same time, then it's possible to do that using ssh and some scripts. But until you provide more information about your needs and why Landscape isn't suitable, it's impossible to provide a detailed answer.\n\nA: Just a clarification: Landscape will manage those different Ubuntu versions just fine - from your wording it seems to indicate you think Landscape won't manage different Ubuntu versions.\n", "Q: How can I disable arbitrary default multitouch gestures in Unity? I'm using a custom Touchégg multitouch gesture setup in Ubuntu 11.04 with a Magic Trackpad. Since the default gestures (such as 3-finger tap and drag to move windows, 4 finger tap to reveal the dash, etc.) are apparently hardcoded in Unity, I'm unable to assign any custom Touchégg actions to them, and some default gestures (that I don't intend to use much, if at all) occasionally mix up with my similar custom-assigned ones and get triggered by accident. \nIs there a practical way (short of tweaking the uTouch source) to disable some of the default gestures?

The steps to download Unity source code are the same as before (I will copy & paste domster's snippet):\nsudo apt-get build-dep unity\ncd /tmp  #It can be done somewhere else, feel free to change the base location.\nmkdir unity\ncd unity\napt-get source unity\n\nAt this point, the file to be edited is only /tmp/unity/unity-6.8.0/plugins/unityshell/src/unityshell.cpp.\nFind the method UnityScreen::InitGesturesSupport() (line 3368 for Unity 6.8.0).\nThen, comment all the lines starting with gesture_sub_launcher to make it look like:\nvoid UnityScreen::InitGesturesSupport()\n{\n  std::unique_ptr<nux::GestureBroker> gesture_broker(new UnityGestureBroker);\n  wt->GetWindowCompositor().SetGestureBroker(std::move(gesture_broker));\n  /*\n  gestures_sub_launcher_.reset(new nux::GesturesSubscription);\n  gestures_sub_launcher_->SetGestureClasses(nux::DRAG_GESTURE);\n  gestures_sub_launcher_->SetNumTouches(4);\n  gestures_sub_launcher_->SetWindowId(GDK_ROOT_WINDOW());\n  gestures_sub_launcher_->Activate();\n\n  gestures_sub_dash_.reset(new nux::GesturesSubscription);\n  gestures_sub_dash_->SetGestureClasses(nux::TAP_GESTURE);\n  gestures_sub_dash_->SetNumTouches(4);\n  gestures_sub_dash_->SetWindowId(GDK_ROOT_WINDOW());\n  gestures_sub_dash_->Activate();\n\n  gestures_sub_windows_.reset(new nux::GesturesSubscription);\n  gestures_sub_windows_->SetGestureClasses(nux::TOUCH_GESTURE\n                                         | nux::DRAG_GESTURE\n                                         | nux::PINCH_GESTURE);\n  gestures_sub_windows_->SetNumTouches(3);\n  gestures_sub_windows_->SetWindowId(GDK_ROOT_WINDOW());\n  gestures_sub_windows_->Activate();\n  */\n}\n\nRe-build Unity following domster's instructions again:\ncd /tmp/unity/unity-6.8.0\ndpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -nc\ncd ..\nsudo dpkg -i *deb\n\nEt voila again!

Here are step by step instructions for patching unity-4.24.0.\nIn a command line, enter:\nsudo apt-get build-dep unity\ncd /tmp  #It can be done somewhere else, feel free to change the base location.\nmkdir unity\ncd unity\napt-get source unity\n\nAt this point, comment out the following 2 lines in the file\n/tmp/unity/unity-4.24.0/plugins/unityshell/src/unityshell.cpp:\nGeisAdapter::Default()->Run();\ngestureEngine = new GestureEngine(screen);\n\nand the following 4 lines in the file /tmp/unity/unity-4.24.0/plugins/unityshell/src/Launcher.cpp:\nGeisAdapter& adapter = *(GeisAdapter::Default());\nadapter.drag_start.connect(sigc::mem_fun(this, &Launcher::OnDragStart));\nadapter.drag_update.connect(sigc::mem_fun(this, &Launcher::OnDragUpdate));\nadapter.drag_finish.connect(sigc::mem_fun(this, &Launcher::OnDragFinish));\n\nThe source code is in C++, so commenting a line is done by adding // at the beginning of the line.  For instance, the line \nGeisAdapter::Default()->Run();\n\nbecomes\n//GeisAdapter::Default()->Run(); .\n\nBack to the command line, enter:\ncd unity-4.24.0\ndpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -nc\ncd ..\nsudo dpkg -i *deb\n\nEt voila!\nNow if you logout and log back in, gestures should function normally.

I have installed Ubuntu 11.04 on my HP pavillion ZX500 with the Ati Radeon 9200 Graphics card. It works fine right now but the only problem is that the Unity desktop doesnt come on. It makes me have to use the classis one and the only reason I installed linux is to use unity. Does it need hardware acceleration for Unity?\nI installed it on my PC and liked it so much I installed it on my laptop. I have heard there are drivers for ati cards in linux. I am new to linux, can anybody tell my how to get the right drivers or enable Unity?\n\nA: To check if your graphics card and driver can support unity-3d you can run the following in a terminal:\n/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p\n\nOn a new install, by default, the Open-Source driver is selected.\nThere maybe an ATI proprietary driver available - ensure you are connected to the internet and look at System - Additional Drivers.  If there is an ATI driver offered to you to be activated, then click on the \"Activate\" button.\nIf both unity_support_test reports unity-3d is not available and if there are no additional drivers you can install, your recommended option is to install the unity-2d package available in the Software Center.\nIn October, the version of unity-2d will be much closer -in terms of capability - to unity-3d and thus is a viable alternative.\n", "Q: How to list recursive file sizes of files and directories in a directory?

I want to remove any and all activity logs for SSH remotely. How do I get to it?\nMy account on the remote server doesn't have admin privilege, and as such I just want to remove user to user connection records.\n\nA: The answer to this lies in sshd.conf and sshd_config (server) and ssh_config (client). Depending on the log level it logs to /var/log/syslog (default) and/or /var/log/auth.log (loglevel 'verbose' contains ssh login attempts).\nIf present /var/log/secure also contains an access log.\nYou will need root/sudo access to edit any of these files: they will be word-readable but not world-editable.\nNext to that. Besides the login from the ssh daemon the command last also shows (failed) logins from ssh. The information for this command comes from /var/log/wtmp (There will be several more I bet).\nAnd there is also the probability the sysadmin installed auditd or logwatch making it practically impossible to hide activity since they could get a notice based on activity undoing the registration of the ssh activity impossible.\nExample of /var/log/auth.log:\nAug 10 10:10:10 rinzwind sshd[3653]: Invalid user text from {ipadress}\nAug 10 10:10:10 rinzwind sshd[3653]: Excess permission or bad ownership on file /var/log/btmp\nAug 10 10:10:10 rinzwind sshd[3653]: error: Could not get shadow information for NOUSER\nAug 10 10:10:10 rinzwind sshd[3653]: Failed password for invalid user test from {ipadress} port {port} ssh2\nAug 10 10:10:10 rinzwind sshd[3653]: Excess permission or bad ownership on file /var/log/btmp\n\nA: You would want to look at /var/log/messages and/or /var/log/syslog. \n", "Q: Dell M6600, AMD Firepro M8900, Graphics Driver and Power issues I've just received a M6600 and tried to install Ubuntu 11.04 on the machine with some pretty poor results. \nBy default the Radeon driver is used for the graphics card however it appears to run very poorly (screen re-drawing visible, tearing of dialogs while moving them). \nI installed, through Jockey, the fglrx driver (however I don't know the version that was installed) with even poorer results.

As soon as I selected a different gtk theme with gnome-tweak-tool, things started working buttery smooth again.  Hope this helps someone else out.

How can I change my password otherwise if I don't have access to that server physically, i.e. I am connecting remotely with ssh using terminal.\n\nA: Do these two things just to make sure:\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\nThis first part remounts the root partition as read/write since it was only in read mode. It actually dismounts the root partition and then mounts it again as read/write.\nThen do this:\nchmod 640 /etc/shadow\n\nThen do the sudo passwd USER. It should work after that. This part gives the correct permissions to the shadow file.\n\nA: If you insert the wrong passwd\n$ passwd\nChanging password for rinzwind.\n(current) UNIX password: \npasswd: Authentication token manipulation error\npasswd: password unchanged\n\nyou get this error. If you are sure that you inserted the correct one, this error might also show up if you are using shadowed password files and the shadow doesn’t have an entry for this user (basically/etc/passwd has an entry for this user, but /etc/shadow does not).\nIn order to fix this, you can either add the entry manually (make a backup first!!!) or recreate the shadow file with pwconv (Manpage).\n\nA: Another problem might be that the disk is full. I got this error when resetting a password, and later checked my disks with df and found that no space is available on my disk. After freeing some I could reset the password without problems.\n\nA: This issue occurred due to the incorrect permissions set to /usr/bin/passwd.\nPlease try to set the permission as 4511 by using the command:\nchmod 4511 /usr/bin/passwd\n\nThis will resolve the issue.\n\nA: If you are using SELinux, running this command fixed the issue for me.\nrestorecon -v /etc/shadow\n\nThanks to this conversation for the solution.\n\nA: Check if you have messed up the common-password file in /etc/pam.d/.\nThis will cause errors if your present password does not match the one that common-password wants.

If you have the incorrect number of colons in the line for your user entry, the 'passwd' command cannot parse it and refuses to continue with the exact error message provided.\n\nA: The error says that the PAM module (see: man pam_chauthtok) was unable to obtain the new authentication token. This may happen on Ubuntu when the user doesn't have default password set yet and passwd is still requesting it, so the workaround is to change the password using root privileges, e.g.\nsudo passwd $USER\n\nso you won't be asked for the current password and the error won't happen.\nSee also: Authentication token manipulation error\n\nA: The server I was working on was configured with some sort of Windows Authentication through PowerBroker Identity Server(PBIS).\nBasically when I input sudo pam-auth-update, the following options appear:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Unselect the first item of the list using the Space Bar Key  to Select/Unselect, and Up/Down arrows if necessary.\n\n*Then move to the Ok Option using Tab, and Left/Right arrow keys if necessary.\n\n*Press Enter on top of the Ok Option.\n\n*After this, I could use passwd and adduser as normal\n\n*Once you are done with your user configuration, you can go back to sudo pam-auth-update, and leave the settings as before.\nIn the general case (i.e. not using the PowerBroker Identity Server(PBIS)), it seems to be important to have the Unix Authentication activated (and no other authentication system).\n\nA: In Lubuntu 15.04 I had the same token manipulation error. I figured this is due to the file system still in read only mode. \nUsing:\nmount -o remount,rw /\npasswd\npasswd: Authentication token manipulation error\n\nThis does not work but this does:\nmount -o remount, --rw /\npasswd\npasswd: Authentication token manipulation error\n\n\nA: Using the above info I found that this solved my problem\npam-auth-update\n\nI need to remove extrausers option from pam. \nIn my logs I noted the following errros.  \njournalctl -f\npasswd[16497]: pam_extrausers(passwd:chauthtok): user \"xuser\" does not exist in /var/lib/extrausers/passwd\n\n", "Q: System not reaching login on GUI Yesterday I finally got around to upgrading from 10.04 to 11.04 (I'm very forgetful about such things). I did an upgrade through the update manager, first to 10.10, then to 11.04. Unfortunately, I've run into an issue, stemming primarily (I believe) from the fact that my hardware doesn't seem to support Unity.\nWhen I boot my machine, I get a screen that looks like this one (linked because the original image is kinda large). It stays on this screen indefinitely, with no animation, no mouse movement, no dialogs, etc.\nHowever, I am still perfectly able to connect to the machine via SSH, and even create NoMachine connections with a Gnome session running on the computer. So it isn't freezing, it just no longer presents a working GUI frontend on the primary monitor. Needless to say, this is inconvenient. So I'm going to purchase a Unity-approved graphics card for the beast, but I'm wondering if there's anything I can do in the meantime, to get a Gnome or Xfce session going when I'm at the physical machine.

If that solves the issue,\n  you can remove it from your /boot/grub/menu.lst as a workaround.\n\nNOTE: even when this document refers to the menu.lst file, that file doesn't exist inside my /boot/grub folder, which is grub.cfg in my case. (I can't say why but no need to comment about it)\nAlso Check the Analysis techniques section of the page in order to gather further information related to your specific issue and let us know, somebody may have more experience with your specific problem than I do.\nKeep us posted on your issue.\nGood luck.\nP.S. You can edit your /boot/grub/grub.cfg using a live session CD/DVD but make sure you always keep a backup of your original file.\n\nA: A couple suggestions to try:\n\n\n*\n\n*xorg.conf - possibly you had installed a nvidia driver, but through the upgrade it has been replaced by the open-source variant.  Try via SSH sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup\n\n*KMS issue - possibly you have to boot with nomodeset in your grub boot option.  Whilst booting press shift to display your grub.  Press e to edit the grub line.  Then add nomodeset immediately before quiet splash.  CTRL + X to boot.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu One does not sync: firewall settings? I'm new to Linux.

I launched Ubuntu One on my system and then ran tcpdump and egrepped on 'Ubuntu' and attached a screenshot of the output. It may be possible your firewall does not support SPI to remember the SSL state as Ubuntu One is making connections back to your machine over a different port.

Simply change your DNS to Google's public DNS or OpenDNS. Both are free.  \nTo answer your questions in the comment:\n1) Yes, it is supposed to. No, you don't have to install anything. (There is a set of certificates your system 'knows' by default. Like you could identify 5 currencies. Let's say these are the biggest and most trusted, most used ones. So you are all fine. In case you would REALLY need an another currency (a new certificate), you have to install it. BUT, Ubuntu got a package for this, and the Canonical team updates that package every time you need a new certificate, or remove an old one. Just don't forget to update your system once in a while.)\n2) Usually your router uses an SPI firewall. But that won't block such service, so I guess you can rule that one out ... too.

I'm running Ubuntu 11.04 64bit and am currently using Ubuntu One file sync for all of my files and devices. I just discovered Deja Dup and was wondering if it was a good idea to use it in addition to Ubuntu One?\n\nA: Ubuntu-One is an excellent tool to synchronise files and folders between multiple machines using the \"ubuntu\" cloud as storage.  Synchronisation is done automatically when it detects a file change.\nHowever, Deja-Dup is another versatile tool in that you can backup & restore folders to local storage, a local network machine, a remote machine or indeed to a Rackspace or Amazon Cloud - and can be done on a timed-schedule.\nI use both Ubuntu-One and Deja-Dup to provide backups - Ubuntu-One to allow me to sync files across multiple computers in real-time and Deja-Dup to backup Ubuntu-One files on a timed-schedule.\nThe reason I do this is the small-print in the Ubuntu-One terms & conditions - you are responsible for backups of files in the UbuntuOne Cloud.\n\nA: Synchronization and backups are two subtly different things.\nUbuntu One will give you immediate access to the current version of your data and no access to older versions of your data.\nDéjà Dup will give you slow access to older versions of your data.\nSo, Ubuntu One will help for some sorts of disaster recovery, namely losing your laptop or some such.\nBut Déjà Dup will help a few more types of disasters, like, \"I need the version of this presentation from last month.\"  Or \"Oh crap, I just copied over this file accidentally and Ubuntu One already synchronized it.\"\n", "Q: Can 't find Thunderbird I was using TB 5.0 then the system requested to upgrade to v 6.0 I tried to installed from the .tar.bz2 file, extracted the files but was not be able to make it run.

From here I get nowhere and now I'm stuck. Should I try to install Ubuntu some other way or does anyone have an idea of what I should do?\nUpdate for answer by Pavlos G:\nMy problems are many. First off, I left the idea of having Windows side to side with Ubuntu and wanted to install only Ubuntu. So Windows is not really the issue, but the problems I had (or have) were two major ones:\n\n*\n\n*Windows would not start. It only said \"put in your Windows installation cd\" and I think that something went wrong during the partitioning part of the installation.\n\n\n*At first, the computer did not won't to start at all which I learned how to fix, but than I got other problems. The computer asked me to install a special device for my graphic card (AMD Radeon HD 6470M) and I did. When I reboot the computer later on Unity, this was gone and Ubuntu had gone back to Gnome. So I figured out because I had nothing on the computer (it's new), I could make a reinstallation instead. ...which now is the problem, but I think your link maybe can fix it.\n\nA: Try ubuntu as the username with a blank password.\nMore info can be found here.\n", "Q: Is there a Ubuntu sanity check? Is there a standard procedure to 'unit test' an Ubuntu system against the deb packages?\nAssume, a system has ubuntu-desktop installed according to the package manager. Can I find out, whether the file system has all the files in ubuntu-desktop and dependencies? \nrelated question: Find packages with corrupted files\n\nA: For the most part, deb packages come with a md5 file containing signatures of all files in the package. These files are located at /var/lib/dpkg/info/$pkg.md5sums.\nTo simplify the periodic check of all installed packages, the debsums package can be of help. Install it, clean the cache with:\nsudo apt-get clean\n\nthen run sudo debsums_init to generate md5 sums for packages that do not provide them (the packages are downloaded to generate such sums).\nNext, edit the file /etc/default/debsums and set CRON_CHECK=weekly to configure a cron weekly job for the check of debsums.\nYou can run the check manually with the command:\nsudo debsums -cs\n\nRegarding the integrity of the dependencies, I suppose that the command:\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nshould signal and try to resolve any problem it finds relative to installed packages, but the Debian/Ubuntu package management system is a very complex object, and could be very difficult to find and resolve its problems.\n", "Q: Is there a safe way to reinstall via the package manager? Assume, I have a system with all the packages installed, which I want, and all configuration files set up as desired. However, the files on the file system could have become corrupted or missing due to some mistake in the past or hardware error. The corrupted files would be replace if the package in question was reinstalled. Such a situation is described elsewhere\nCan I safely run\naptitude reinstall ?installed\n\nto get a fresh version of my system?\n\nA: A good way to deal with file corruption is to use `debsums' (see these instructions, and also this great answer), though they're starting with a non-booting system) which will discover which files are corrupted; then you can reinstall just those packages.\nYour reinstall command is safe, but it's not guaranteed to fix everything that might have been caused by a hardware error.\nYou might also like to force a fsck or run a badblocks scan.  You can do both of those from inside the disk utility.\n\nA: I would not suggest to do so, because it could be a very long and for the most part un-useful operation. Moreover configuration files and personal configuration files are not involved in the simple reinstall, and the problem could be just there.\nIt is better to try to determine which packages have problems and reinstall only these packages. \n", "Q: Is there a web based terminal/ssh client? I'm at a library, and all of the computers are Windows based.  I'm sshing into my Ubuntu box somewhere else. The terms of service says \"You may not make any changes to system files.\" However, when I ssh into my Ubuntu box, it might \"look\" like I'm hacking, since I've had a few people (including I presume the library supervisor) look at my computer funny when I opened a website where the text was a monospaced font and the website background was black. Running Command Prompt will certainly be considered to be hacking if looking at a website was.\nIf I'm sshing into my box it appears as though I'm \"hacking\" into the computer. I'd like to somehow do it in a web browser with nice happy looking text, so that it actually represents what I'm doing; I'm not going to hack into the computer, I'm only using a computer somewhere else.\n\nA: What you'll probably want to do, is to install a HTML-based terminal emulator. There are several (many) to choose from. That will give you a text field in a webpage (such as the one I'm currently typing into) and that will run on your system.\nThis is a list of such applications, in no particular order.

Author has Docker image as well for easy setup.\n\nA: Disclaimer: I'm the primary developer for Shellvault.\nAnother option is Shellvault, a web-based cloud SSH client that you don't have to download or set up yourself. It has terminal multiplexing, it looks nice by default, and since it's cloud-based, you can administer your servers from any computer without setting up SSH on a new machine.\n\nShellvault is a Software-as-a-Service, so it's not free, but it has free trial so you can see if you like using it. After the 7-day trial, a subscription costs $5/month.\n\nA: This project is no longer available, but another option was: https://bashify.io [the current website is an unrelated image sharing and link shortener].\nIt was a Software as a Service. It used to run an SSH in the web browser completely installation free.\nDisclaimer: I'm the developer.\n\nA: If the Library is using Firefox and has the ability to install add-ons, try FireSSH - its a javascript based SSH client.\n\n\nA: You should try Bastillion - https://www.bastillion.io You can use multiple terminals simultaneously (like tmux).\n\nA: I recommend Serfish Console, as it uses ssh and requires no installation. You could also try Chrome Remote Desktop, as it works from any internet-connected computer, as long as you install the software on the computer you want to connect to. Chrome Remote Desktop also lets you use the desktop on the computer you are connecting to, and does not require port forwarding.

I tried remove the installer itself, but the fonts are still there..Is there away to COMPLETELY REMOVE the fonts?\n\nA: You can uninstall the font instead of just remove it.\nsudo apt-get remove ttf-mscorefonts-installer\nThen according to @Oli answer, update font cache\nfc-cache -rv\n\nA: Because of the way the fonts are allowed to be distributed, the package downloads installers and extracts them into their own directory in /usr/share/fonts/truetype/.\nTo clean up those extracted files, just run this:\nsudo rm -rf /usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts\n\nYou can be more thorough (run locate msttcorefonts to find more places where various helper files are excreted) but the other command should have cleaned up all the fonts.\nYou might find you need to clear the font cache after this for applications to realise the fonts have gone.

Trying out Ubuntu Intrepid, I have discovered that RightAlt+F1 doesn't take me to tty13. \nI've exhaustively tried every option presented to me in dpkg-reconfigure console-setup, the best I've been able to manage thus far has been to have both Alt keys behave the same (LeftAlt+F1 and RightAlt+F1 both going to tty1).\nPlease note that using GNU screen is not considered a valid response to the question - this is specifically about how to get the keyboard to behave properly with multiple consoles under Ubuntu. The crazy thing is that every other distro I've tried just handles this correctly, including Debian Lenny.\n\nA: In Debian, I would just edit /etc/inittab, but Ubuntu uses Upstart.\nApparently, you're supposed to edit /etc/default/console-setup and set the ACTIVE_CONSOLES variable to be /dev/tty[1-13] in your case.\nBefore changing this, Right-Alt + Ctrl + F1 would bring me to tty1. Now, I just get a blank screen that I can't do anything on. I also had to manually copy the file /etc/event.d/tty1 to /etc/event.d/tty13 and change the settings inside appropriately.\nI can't seem to get it to work.\nshrug\n\nA: On most systems, if you are at a text console, you can use Alt + the arrow keys to move to next and previous console.\n\nA: There's a nice program called chvt that takes you to another virtual console. (e.g. 'sudo chvt 1' would pop me right out of X, right now.) It's a bit obnoxious in that X drivers don't always like vt-switching. On the other hand, it's saved me more than once when X has gotten wedged. You might also want to look at a program called \"open\" which opens a new virtual terminal.\n...But if your problem is really that you want more terminals, what I'd really recommend is to look into screen. It does all kinds of nifty things. Like being able to ssh in and connect to the same session you worked on locally, in what I think of as \"multiplayer\".. (well, you can be attached to the same (backend-) session from multiple frontends.) It kicks ass. I use it every day at work, where I have a very long-running session on one of the anarchic dev-servers.\nAs for your actual reported problem, well.. hmm.. how's your keyboard configured? Does it work with some more 'popular' keymap?\n\nA: Are you running X?  If so, check your Gnome or KDE keyboard shortcuts to make sure that this isn't bound to something else. \nIf you're not using X, then why not just use \"screen\" for console / shell management?  That's a much more elegant solution than relying on Linux's multiple consoles.  man screen \n\nA: Mostly, virtual consoles tty8 through tty63 are unused and unassigned. There's no applications running on them, and they're not assigned to any keypress. However, you still can open an application on it as described in one of my older answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make your user the owner of that console: sudo chown \"$USER\":tty /dev/tty13\n\n*Run openvt -c 13 -l or openvt -c 13 -s \"bash\"\n\n*If you return to TTY1 or any other tty  that has assigned keyboard shortcut, and want to go back to the TTY13 that you've opened, use sudo chvt 13 for that ( and if I'm not mistaken - if you're added to tty group you should not need sudo for that ).\n\n\nIf you add yourself  to tty group, you can later skip the step #1 and assign the command in step #2 as keyboard shortcut\n\nPlease also note that proper combination is Ctrl+Alt+F1 and not Left Alt+F1  indicated in the question body. For virtual machines in Virtual Box, that's slightly different - it's Left Ctrl+F1. \n\nA: After a lot of attempts to fix this various ways, I finally figured out how to use dumpkeys and loadkeys to modify the kernel's \"keyboard translation table\". Here are the loadkeys strings to set RightAlt+F1 through RightAlt+F12 to their respective offsets from tty12:\naltgr   keycode  59 = Console_13\naltgr   keycode  60 = Console_14\naltgr   keycode  61 = Console_15\naltgr   keycode  62 = Console_16\naltgr   keycode  63 = Console_17\naltgr   keycode  64 = Console_18\naltgr   keycode  65 = Console_19\naltgr   keycode  66 = Console_20\naltgr   keycode  67 = Console_21\naltgr   keycode  68 = Console_22\naltgr   keycode  87 = Console_23\naltgr   keycode  88 = Console_24\n\nWhy Ubuntu doesn't include this in the default setup remains a mystery. :)\n", "Q: Is there a way to test packages I build for correct dependencies? I'm absolutely new to packaging, so forgive me if I am asking something obvious for an experienced packager...\nHow can I be sure that mentioned all the dependencies correctly in my package?\nSay that my application make use of lib library-xyz which is not installed by default. If I build the package and install it on my developing machine, library-xyz will be installed already, so - even if I failed to mention it as a dependency - the program will still run correctly. But another user on a fresh install of ubuntu won't have library-xyz installed and the program will likely crash for him.\nThe way I am testing now is having a fresh ubuntu install running in a VM and installing the package there, but since it seems like a common problem, I wonder if there is a better way to test, something adopting the same philosophy of chroot but that - instead of \"cutting out\" parts of the filesystem would \"cut out\" all those installed packages that are not \"default\" in a clean ubuntu installation.\nI'm packaging python programs.\n\nA: The lintian program runs after building a package using debuild and should warn you for missing libraries when building a binary package. The ldd command can be used to check which libraries are needed for a package.\nI use the below script for fetching library package dependencies quickly:\n#!/bin/sh\n# Save it as executable ~/bin/pkglibs\n# Usage: pkglibs directory\n#        pkglibs file\nlist_lib_pkgnames() {\n    local lib=\"$1\" libs\n    # get the libraries for given \"$lib\", stripping out linker libraries\n    libs=$(ldd \"$lib\" | awk '/=/{print $1}' | grep -vE '^(linux-vdso|linux-gate)\\.so\\.1$')\n    # if there are libraries, find the matching packages for it\n    [ -n \"$libs\" ] && dpkg -S $libs | sed 's/: .*//'\n}\nsearch=\"$1\"\nif [ -d \"$search\" ]; then\n    # for directories, recursively search for library dependencies\n    find \"$search\" -type f -exec \"$0\" {} \\; | sort -u\nelse\n    list_lib_pkgnames \"$search\"\nfi\n\nThe command may take a while for large directories since it test each file separatedly. It can be optimized to generate a list of libraries first, and then passing the unique entries to the dpkg -S command, but that is an exercise for the reader.\nExample: pkglibs /usr/lib/mesa/:\nia32-libs\nlib32gcc1\nlib32stdc++6\nlibc6\nlibc6-i386\nlibdrm2\nlibgcc1\nlibstdc++6\nlibx11-6\nlibxau6\nlibxcb1\nlibxdamage1\nlibxdmcp6\nlibxext6\nlibxfixes3\nlibxxf86vm1\n\n\nA: As explained in my comment above regarding pbuilder, it's useful mainly to verify build dependencies (similar to upload the package to a launchpad PPA), but won't be useful to check dependencies unless you add some additional steps in your packaging scripts like running unit tests.\nAnother similar solution (run tests in a restricted environment), if you're just considering dependencies against python libraries, would be to create a virtualenv so that you're in control of the python libraries available during testing. One tool that would be usefull to manage the virtual environments using multiple python versions while running the tests would be tox.\nThis won't add the dependencies for you in the debian/control file, but could be helpful anyway.\n", "Q: Don't raise window on click (while hold) It seems that Compiz support forum is used for spam, and as I noticed similar questions answered here, I thought it'd be best for me to ask here\nI'm on Ubuntu 11.04 and window manager uses Compiz\nWhile on Windows I got used to this feature which I'll try to explain:\nImagine simple drag&drop operation - I have Explorer maximized and I open Notepad on top of it. Now, if I click and hold mouse button on a file in Explorer, Notepad loses focus but it's still visible - Explorer window isn't raised over it, so I can finish my drag&drop operation. That's not happening on Linux, and I want to make it somehow.\nIn Compiz 'General options' there are similar settings, but nothing can bring me this feature back it seems. Sourced from Internet it seems also that Openbox window manager allows this feature while pressing Super/Win keyboard button.\nSo I want to know if this is somehow possible with Compiz or alternatively Metacity\n(I know that I can hover on Launcher, then raise application and drop, but for some reason it's not reliable always[1], and I find above feature more easier)\n[1] Launcher shades, then hovered application raises but it does not accept dropped source\n\nA: I'll answer this question myself, in case someone else looks for this feature. As said, I was unable to make it work with Compiz, then for some other reasons I decided to remove Compiz and install Unity 2D with Metacity. Good move for me, as now I found that while holding Ctrl or Super key, application used as drag & drop source isn't raised :) \nLet me explain once more using Linux naming:\nMaximize Nautilus (it doesn't have to be miximized of course, but it's easier to explain this way). Launch Gedit. While GEdit is on top, press Ctrl or Super, then drag some text file from Nautilus and drop it on Gedit window, which is still on top and even did not lose focus.\n", "Q: What do I need to get started with thin clients? I'm planning to make an ubuntu server (with load balancing to a few offstage computers) and have thin clients connect to it.  Unfortunately, I don't know how to make a thin client, or the setup involved.  I really like virtualization and servers and stuff like that.\nBasically, I'd have a resource pool of computers sitting underneath a desk and I could have another computer, somewhere else that runs off of it...  I'm not sure if I'm getting the concept right.\n\nA: You can use X2Go for thin clients, both on the server and on the clients. You'd probably network the servers to add a shared storage using nfs or similar, and LDAP for users and groups. Then you install the software you need on all the computers. That means your user can log onto any server with his username and password and get his desktop and files. Then you can use DNS for load balancing, for instance. \nThere are many ways of doing it. The more specified your question is, the more detailed the answer can be.\nI think actually X2Go has load balancing included, but I've never tried it. www.x2go.org has more info.\n\nA: This is not directly related to virtualization, and \"pools of computers\", but the LTSP project allows you to boot several thin clients through PXE, in a way that users will be able to log in to the Ubuntu server and get a regular Ubuntu desktop, just as if they were sitting at the server's console.\nSince this is a very common use case in schools, LTSP is one of the main features in Edubuntu; browse through the Edubuntu mailing lists for discussions on the subject.\nI would also recommend Dave Richard's blog and his book: Linux Thin Client Networks Design and Deployment; although he uses another Gnome-based distro, the main concepts still apply, and he shows you clearly how to scale the graphical login to hundreds of users by deploying separate 'application servers'.\n(links to edubuntu.org and davelargo.blogspot.com de-fanged by stack exchange)\n", "Q: My dropbox and network indicators moved to the bottom panel I log in and now my Dropbox and network indicators are on the bottom panel just right of center.

Clicking or right clicking or attempting to drag to the top panel just opens my Dropbox folder or my network menu.  How can I get them where I want them?\n\nA: Basically the applet you are looking at is notification-area-applet try right clicking somewhere in space aound the icons[you may see a separator line near icons try right clicking on that rather than icon itself] and see it will give you option to remove it. I use unity nowadays so I forgot if there is gui for adding/removing applets in gnome.

Until Ubuntu 11.04 this worked fine (for several years) but since 11.04 its been broken. Just doesn't work. I've tried to find solutions, hacks, etc, have posted on official ubuntu forums, but it's just broken. I travel a lot and give a lot of (scientific) presentations, and really need this functionality. Since 11.04 I have to stand up at a conference, plug in my laptop and then go through the hassle of nvidia-settings, detect displays, mirror displays, apply, etc. Argh.

How many times in a month do I need to install it?\n\nA: We can open \"Settings...\" for options on how often Update Manager checks for updates, and to always install security updates in the background.\n10.04 LTS\n\n12.04 LTS\n\nThe automatic check for updates can be set in steps from Never, Every two weeks, Weekly, Every two days, and Daily.\nIt is recommended to check for security updates frequently.

Updating of other packages can be done whenever this is convenient, but you will not get bugs fixed until you do it.\n\nA: You should install as often as possible in order to keep your system safe and reliable. But you don't have to. And you can run the update manager whenever you feel like it. But you can also have a look at the details. Sometimes it's obvious that the fix doesn't apply to you, in which case it isn't important that you install it. \n\nA: Every time would be the best. But I don't do that either, only when I see security updates I will update immediately otherwise I update when I have the time to do so.\n\nA: You'll have to distinguish between what is mandatory (what you have to do) and what is recommended (what you should do):\n\n\n*\n\n*You don't have or need to install any update.

You'll benefit from this by getting a more secure system (the fixed security issues cannot be exploited) and a more updated system which is hopefully more stable.\nIf you're bothered by the update manager popping up I suggest you do as Takkat recommends and have Automatic updates set to \"Install security updates without confirmation\" (Update manager - Settings - Updates - Install security updates without confirmation). With this settings you should be OK to ignore the Update manager most of the time. Do the updates when you have time and feel like it, e.g. do it roughly once a month.\nAlso note that you can set it to look for updates less often (Update manager - Settings - Updates - Check for updates). This way it won't popup as often.\n", "Q: xorg.conf to get current \"Section \"Device\" content by default the xorg.conf doesn't exist in /etc/\nI could generate it by Xorg -configure.

I can't do it at the moment.\nSo is it possible to get xorg's content or at least on option which is\n\nSection \"Device\"\n  (the driver line)\n\n\nA: referring repeatedly to the assumption that it won't be necessary doesn't help those who have to. While the automatic startup does provide a functional Gui it is far from what the video card could really do.\nxorg -configure on the other hand doesn't create a usable result, claiming that there are more devices than there really are (and so does the configuration look like)\nFor such issues it was extremely helpful to see, what the automate found and did when starting X as it is running now.\n\nA: Usually you want need to set the xorg.conf file yourself since settings are automatically determined.\nMost options can be guessed from the Xorg log at /var/log/Xorg.0.log (0 is the display number). If you've an i5 or i7 processor, you're likely using the intel driver (the log will have a line with \"(II) intel: Driver for Intel Integrated Graphics Chipsets: ...\").\nIf you still want to proceed generating the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file, you need to run Xorg -configure as root without an active X server. Disabling the X server will make you loose your graphical session, so make sure that you've saved all work and logged out. When ready, switch to a virtual console by pressing Ctrl + Alt + F1 and login the text console. First, stop the desktop manager: sudo stop gdm or if you're not using GNOME but KDE: sudo stop kdm. After that, you can run sudo Xorg -configure. After that, you can run sudo start gdm or sudo start kdm to get back to the graphical session. If not, (re)move the generated /etc/X11/xorg.conf file.\n", "Q: Are the dark toolbars also coming to gtk2 applications? The gtk3 theme in Oneiric has seen some improvements: dark toolbars and those awesome scrollbars I just discovered (when not using the overlay scrollbars). Are these improvements also coming to the gtk2 theme so we have consistency between gtk2 and gtk3 applications?\n\n\n\nA: You can already have that in Natty. It is unlikely that it will be an official 'backport' since that's not Ubuntu's way.\n\n\n*\n\n*All credits go to James Schriver/Dashua from launchpad.\n\n*Only for Natty.\n\n*From OMG Ubuntu: \n\n\nGlobal dark toolbars\nPut together by Dashua, the following Natty-only PPA contains a modified version of the Ubuntu light themes that applies this ‘dark toolbar’ style to all of your installed GTK+ applications.\nAs this ‘style’ is very much in-progress it doesn’t work correctly with all applications. Bear this in mind before installing, and make a back-up of the original Ambiance theme in case you wish to revert.\nAlso provided via Dashua’s PPA is a patched version of Nautilus-Elementary.\nGetting the changes\nYou can upgrade your version of Ambiance and Nautilus with these unsupported changes by adding ppa:dashua/ppa to your software sources (see the Technical details about this PPA on how to add a PPA). \nOnce added, run the Update Manager to apply the relevant updates. Select Ambiance in the Appearance Properties window for the theme to take effect. You may need to log out and back in in-order for changes to Nautilus to appear.\nAlso note that this version of Ambiance has Faenza set as the default icon set. If you don’t wish to use the Faenza icon pack you can change. Click the customize button in Appearance Preferences, go to the icon tab and choose an icon set of your choosing. The default Ubuntu icon set is Ubuntu Mono Dark.\nAnd it will look like this:\n\n", "Q: How to enter a directory with the 'cd' command if it has 700 permission and is not owned by me? I tried to use sudo cd name_of_dir but am getting the error message: \nsudo: cd: command not found\n\nIs there any other way to enter a directory owned by another user which has 700 permission?\n\nA: You can also elevate yourself to root user by:\nsudo -s\n\nThen you can cd to any directory which doesn't allow normal user in like:\ncd /root\n\nOr\ncd /var/lib/\n\nThen after you're done in there type:\nexit\n\nTo logout of the root user privileges.\nFor elevating yourself as root, you can also combine the two commands by && operator as below, this operator also maintains their execution sequence, if current command executes successfully and only then the next command is allowed to execute:\nsudo -s && cd /var/lib\n\nOr\nsudo -s && cd /root\n\n\nA: sudo -i\nto open \"root console\" and then\ncd /path/to/directory\n(cd is a shell builtin command, so it can't be the sudo target)\n\nA: If you really want to make sudo cd directory work, you can define a bash shell function called sudo that runs a new root shell when run that way, and just runs the regular sudo command otherwise.\nAs presented in other answers, most users will not want to bother doing that, but will instead want to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Run sudo -s, or sudo -i if you want a login shell (remember that one effect of sudo -i is to start you out in root's home directory), or sudo bash if you want to force bash or be able to pass options to the shell.\n\n*Run cd directory in the new shell.\n\n*Perform whatever (other) actions need to be taken as root in the new shell.\n\n*Once done, run exit to leave the new shell. It's important not to forget this, because you don't want to perform more actions as root than you intend!\n\n\nSo, if you want to, then you can write a shell function (or a script) that performs the first two of those actions when sudo is followed by cd, and just runs sudo normally otherwise. Please do not use this as an alternative to learning why sudo cd does not otherwise succeed, because if you don't understand what is going on, then you will likely be very confused by being in a new shell (and you may not understand any error messages that occur).\nHere's one way to write such a shell function, which also reminds you that you're in a new shell and that you should exit out of it when you are finished. (That reminder is likely to be useful for users of any skill level, because one is not generally accustomed to being in a new shell when one runs sudo without -s, -i, or the name of an actual shell as an argument.)\n# Make sudo treat \"sudo cd [DIRECTORY]\" as a special case and start a shell.\nsudo() {\n    if [ \"$#\" -eq 2 ] && [ \"$1\" = 'cd' ]; then\n        sudo bash -c '\n                if cd -- \"$2\"; then # When cd fails, its own message is enough.\n                    printf \"%s: Running %s shell in %s\\n\" \"$0\" \"$USER\" \"$2\" >&2\n                    printf \"%s: Type \\\"exit\\\" once you are done!\\n\" \"$0\" >&2\n                    exec bash # Replace this bash shell with an interactive one.\n                fi\n            ' bash _ \"$2\" # Use $2 as the dir in the intermediate shell, too.\n    else\n        command sudo \"$@\"\n    fi\n}\n\nYou could put this in your ~/.bashrc, though this is a weird enough way to use sudo that you may only want to enable it occasionally. In that case,  it's better to put it in its own file. If you create a file called sudo.bash in your home directory with those contents, then you can make the sudo function available--so that it will run instead of the regular sudo command--by running . ~/sudo.bash. That takes effect in the current shell and its child shells, but not others. For the same reason that files like .bashrc are not executable, don't mark sudo.bash executable with chmod. This is really a library, rather than a standalone shell script. If you did run it as a shell script, it would define the function... but only in the shell that ran the script, not for you as the caller. (Of course, you can write a script for this, that just doesn't happen to be the approach I've taken here.)\nTo check and see if sudo is currently defined as a shell function, and to see its current definition if it is one, run type sudo. To disable (i.e., undefine) the function once it's defined, run unset -f sudo. To manually run the regular sudo command directly even if the shell function is defined,  run command sudo. Note, however, that you don't have to do that, because this sudo function actually does that itself whenever there are more or fewer than two arguments passed to it or the first argument passed to it is anything but cd. That's why you can still use it in the normal ways people use sudo.\nNote also that the shell function shown above does still let you pass other arguments to sudo, but that will prevent it from treating cd specially.  Running sudo -u user cd directory in particular is not supported, though you could extend the shell function to support that case. Nor is sudo -i cd directory. The shell that it creates is similar to what you get with sudo -s. The code does not actually run sudo -s, but uses sudo bash, so the -c option works properly. It actually runs bash twice when you pass cd and a directory argument to it (and zero times otherwise). When you run sudo cd directory, first it forks off a separate bash shell from the one you're running  the sudo function in and changes directory. If that succeeds, it replaces that bash shell with a new, interactive one that you can use.\nHere's an example of how that shell function automatically \"does the right thing.\" Notice that sudo ls -A /root behaves normally. Only when I then attempt to cd to a directory with sudo is a new shell created, and I am reminded explicitly of what is going on.\nek@Io:~$ sudo ls -A /root\n[sudo] password for ek:\n.aptitude      .bashrc  .config  .emacs.d  .nano     .rpmdb\n.bash_history  .cache   .dbus    .local    .profile\nek@Io:~$ sudo -k  # invalidates my current timestamp... like I left for a while\nek@Io:~$ sudo cd /root/.local\n[sudo] password for ek:\nbash: Running root shell in /root/.local\nbash: Type \"exit\" once you are done!\nroot@Io:/root/.local#\nroot@Io:/root/.local#\nroot@Io:/root/.local# exit\nexit\nek@Io:~$\n\nIf you try to sudo cd to a directory that you can't change to even as root, then you will just get an error message:\nek@Io:~$ sudo cd /nonexistent\n[sudo] password for ek:\nbash: line 1: cd: /nonexistent: No such file or directory\nek@Io:~$ sudo -k\nek@Io:~$ sudo cd /etc/crontab\n[sudo] password for ek:\nbash: line 1: cd: /etc/crontab: Not a directory\nek@Io:~$\n\nI have used sudo -k in between invocations in the above examples to show that it authenticates you as root before attempting to change directory. But you don't actually have to run sudo -k yourself. Because the shell function is just a thin wrapper for the real sudo command, caching of your credentials and other common sudo behaviors still work normally.\nThough it works well and is kind of neat, I admit that shadowing the real sudo command with a function of the same name is super weird. Most users will probably just want to perform the steps sudo -s, cd directory themselves. But in case anybody wants this--and also to demonstrate that it's possible--there it is.\n\nA: To open a root directory we may run a root shell, e.g.:\nsudo su\n# cd /root\n\n\nA: sudo cd won't work because the cd command is built into the shell. So you are saying become root and then run this command. You become root and then the command after sudo is searched for but there is no cd command to find. \nThe method to use is to switch to the user that owns the directory. Permission 700 is meant as \"owner can read, write and execute\". \nSo if root owns the directory sudo -i, password and then cd {dir} is the only correct method. If someone else owns the directory you can still use the 1st method but can also change to that user with su {username} and then use cd as that user. \n\nA: As others pointed out -- it's shell built-in:\n~ % which cd\ncd: shell built-in command\n\nSo, why don't you sudo the shell itself?\n~ % sudo $SHELL -c \"cd name_of_dir\"\n\n\nA: As far as the to su or not to su debate,  I think it's silly. su is against the religion of Ubuntu and it's not something to do carelessly.  It's amazing what an rm -rf * can do if you're root.  But, if you're comfortable with the command line interface (CLI) and have system level tasks to do, there's no reason not to use su.  I've used several distros where no one even mentioned using sudo. It's just a matter of what kind of work you're doing and which method you're most comfortable with. I use both.\n\nA: @Daniel Bauke's solution works when what you're trying to sudo is a compound command, such as cd /some/path && ./executableScript.sh which may be what you need if executableScript.sh needs to be executed from within its directory, and it requires sudo both to enter the directory and to run the script (and you want to do this in a non-interactive/session kind of way.\nTo reiterate, Daniel Bauke's solution is:\nsudo $SHELL -c \"cd /some/path && ./executableScript.sh\"\n\n", "Q: Get only one package from 11.10 to install on 11.04 I need one really important package from oneiric to be installed (upgraded) on natty.\nHow can I extract just single deb file?

Check that you have the proper modules installed.\nThen in terminal run the following command:\nsudo modprobe snd-hda-intel\n\nNow run the command:\nsudo aplay -l\n\nand see whether you are getting the list of hardware devices.\n\n\n*Do you have the sound modules installed?\nOpen a terminal and type (note the backticks ` for command substitution):\nfind /lib/modules/`uname -r` | grep snd\n\nYou should see a large list of items come up.

Fixed it.\nSound card not detected - Ubuntu 20.04 - sof-audio-pci\n\nA: TL;DR: On a Dell XPS laptop, it may be a BIOS thing.\nI've had the same - all of a sudden, Ubuntu stopped playing sound and no player could recognize the sound card, no soundcards found... from aplay -l, although all drivers were installed.\nThis happened on a Dell XPS 15 9560 with Ubuntu 16.04 dual booted with Windows 10.\nAfter trying every troubleshooting step, including re-installing and booting into different kernels, I realized sound stopped working in Windows, too.\nEventually, it was something in the BIOS that suddenly gone haywire... After a BIOS update, the problem was solved.\nOn another occasion, when the problem repeated, I entered the BIOS, disabled Audio completely, applied, then re-enabled it, and on reboot, sound was back.\nMy takeaways:  \n\n\n*\n\n*If running a dual-booted system, and basic troubleshooting steps are not working, check whether sound is working on the other installed OS, too.\n\n*Make sure BIOS is up to date, and try to disable/enable Audio for getting the sound back.\n\n", "Q: Why is magento not packaged for Ubuntu? I know it is simple to download and install but so are many other applications such as phpmyadmin, drupal and Zend Framework and they are all just an apt-get away.\nWhy is there no package for magento in the repositories or apparently from anywhere else?\nIs it a licensing issue? The software is dual licensed under a commercial license and Open Software License (OSL 3.0).\n\nA: Part of the issue might be with Debian ruling the OSL V1.1 (Magento is now under 3.0) as a non-free license. Conversations on the debian-legal mailing list went:\n\nhttp://www.opensource.org/licenses/osl.php\nWe did this one a few months back, but nobody raised the\n  patent/reciprocity thing at that time. Here's the offending clause:\n10) Mutual Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate\n  automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted\n  to You by this License if You file a lawsuit in any court alleging\n  that any OSI Certified open source software that is licensed under any\n  license containing this \"Mutual Termination for Patent Action\" clause\n  infringes any patent claims that are essential to use that software.\nI think this one's non-free too. It's certainly absurdly overbearing.\n\nAnd more on that here.\nIt still seems to be GPL-incompatible because of the way it adds extra restrictions. I didn't think GPL compatibility was a necessity for universe inclusion, but Debian getting in a fluster over it will have stalled the upstream packaging process.\nThere's no reason why that should have stopped an Ubuntu user from packaging it. It just needs somebody who's willing to take up the task. I should add that this is not a one-off job. Security updates need to be pushed as soon as they're available.\n\nA: Have a look at the list of all applications that need to be included in the repositories: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.tag=needs-packaging There is more than 2k entries. I think it's not packaged for ubuntu only because the packagers don't have enough time, as there is lots of other work to do.\nThe license rarely is a problem. Note that quite a lot of free commercially-licenced applications are packaged for ubuntu (proprietary drivers or Adobe Flash for example).\n", "Q: How to test your speaker? I'm trying to use skype in ubuntu 11.\nBut it fails.\nIt seems something is wrong with my speak driver, how can i fix it?\nIt's ok in Windows.\n\nA: You can test your speakers in sound preferences:\n\nRegarding sound issues the Ubuntu Wiki has a SoundTroubleshootingProcedure that checks in detail any issues regarding sound. \n\nA: you can test it using gstreamer properties just press alt-F2 then enter\ngstreamer-properties\n\nit should look like this just press test on default output\n\n\nA: Also it is worth being aware that there is a tick box in your skypoe options box to stop skype messing up your sound options as well which if you are running pulse audio it sometimes does. I have found that deselecting the option here helps where it says Allow Skype to automatically adjust my mixer levels. \n\nMore info here from the skype site \nskype for linux\nLet us know how you get on\n", "Q: How to prevent KDE from loading the Gnome desktop for fullscreen applications? Every time I start an application that is using fullscreen mode in KDE my gnome desktop background is loaded before starting the program. This is aesthetically diturbing and I suspect there is a waste of ressources when the gnome system is somehow started in the background. \nAffected are:  \n\n\n*\n\n*wine applications using fullscreen (started via playonlinux) \n\n*virtualbox using fullscreen or scaled modus \n\n*firefox flash plugin  \n\n\nWhat I did (inspired by some hints in various forums): \nreplaced gdm with lightdm (flash plugin seems to be fixed now) \nused \"killall nautilus\" - but this had no effect at all. \nHow can I make sure KDE doesn't use any gnome programs or settings in the background without removing gnome (as gnome is used as an alternative login for testing purposes!)? \np.s.: I am using 11.04 Ubuntu with kubuntu desktop installed, 64bit, newest nvidia drivers \nHere's the output of \"ps aex | tee\" as suggested: http://paste.ubuntu.com/678832/\n\nA: Almost without a doubt I can be sure you are running Dropbox, which starts Nautilus under KDE no matter what you do. If you want nautilus to go away, you can run killall -9 nautilus. You can even add this to KDE startup applications and have it run only in KDE.\n", "Q: auto-mount another user's encrypted /home at login I'm using encrypted home directories, and in my day to day activities, I have two user accounts I switch between, one for personal stuff, one for work stuff. However, it's fairly common that I need to access personal files for work stuff, or vice versa.\nSo, how can I set up automatically mounting the other directory at login? I use the same password for both, so the system should be able to access to the encryption keys at login time. I've done a bit of googling, and I can't even figure out where the config files for this are...\n\nA: Steps to decrypt a user folder can be found in this discussion thread:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=11107254\nOnce you have the encryption key for the second directory in your keyring, you could execute this on login:\nsudo mount -t ecryptfs /home/user/.Private /home/user/Private\nand the second directory would be available at /home/user/Private\n\nA: i believe the encrypted home is unlocked with your login password but only through the gnome-keyring the actual password for the home folder is a rather long randomly generated password\ni've never done it but it should be able to unlock it using this long password and save that to your keyring\n this command will get you the long passphrase\necryptfs-unwrap-passphrase ~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase\n\nyou will have to do this logged in as the other user\nthen this should add it to your keyring\necryptfs-insert-wrapped-passphrase-into-keyring\n\ndo this logged in as the other user taking not of the unwrapped passphrase in the first command\ni've never done any of this so it would be a good idea to have a look over the man pages first\nalso make a note of both of the wrapped passphrase aswell just incase when you add it to the keyring it removes your passphrase not sure if it will store 2\n", "Q: VirtualBox choking I had VirtualBox running just fine but on the update to 11.04 it choked.

By this you will always run the latest stable issue, where usually many bugs got fixed. You will still have the Open Source version running as long as you don't install the Extension Pack.\nSee also this more elaborate answer. For running Unity you will also have to install the Guest Additions.\n\nA: If I remember correctly, when a new kenel is installed, some modules have to be either re-done, or recompiled in order to bind to the new kernel. I don't remember the commands for those, but I used to reinstall the latest of Virtualbox and the problem went away.You may see those displayed as VB gets installed.\n", "Q: Repair and consulting service for home-users? I have a new Laptop on which I installed Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (dual boot with preinstalled Windows 7) since about a month. However there are three consistent problems that I have not been able to get rid of, no matter where I look on the internet. The primary reason is that it is difficult to explain and diagnose such problems when one of many things might be the issue. \nSince I am sadly not an expert (yet), I would like to have some linux junkie have a look at my system and fix my problems. The problem is, I do not have a Linux Users Group that is active in my vicinity. I hardly know any expert. So are there such services or people that look into such problems at affordable rates?

Not sure though.\n\nA: A couple things to try. You can follow the instructions here.\nIn summary, run xrandr to get a list of your monitors. The first one listed (e.g. VGA1) will be your primary monitor. Then run sudo xrandr --output VGA2 --primary to make your second monitor primary. Note that your monitors may not be called VGA1 and VGA2. You'll need to look at the xrandr output to find the correct names.\nSecondly, your monitors look like they might have the same connection type. If that's the case, you could try switching the cables they use to connect.\nLastly, if all else fails, you could just switch the physical location of the monitors. Maybe not the best solution, but also probably the simplest.\n\nA: ubuntu 18.10\ngo to display and set the primary display to the screen which you want to have the launcher:\n\n\nA: for 11.10 there is no workaround, but there is a ppa on launchpad (unsupported) that fixes the issue. \nTo install: \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo add-apt-repository ppa:vanvugt/unity\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo apt-get install unity\nYou will need to relog for the changes to take effect. \n", "Q: How do I extract DNS IPs using a script?

When I try to install updates (via either Update Manager or apt-get upgrade) the usual apt upgrade process is stopped as it shows me some changelogs, for example:\n\nNothing will happen until I hit the q key, then it outputs: \napt-listchanges: Mailing root: apt-listchanges: changelogs for msg\n\n(msg is my hostname)\nand finishes installing the updates as usual. This doesn't happen when installing a new package, only when installing updates.\nWhat is causing this? How can I fix it?\n\nA: apt-listchanges is a package that does exactly what you describe:\n\napt-listchanges is a tool to show what has been changed in a new version of a package, as compared to the version currently installed on the system. It does this by extracting the relevant entries from the changelog file, and the NEWS files.\nIt can be run on several .deb archives at a time to get a list of all of the changes that would be effected by installing or upgrading a group of packages. It can be configured to do this automatically during upgrades using apt.\n\nThis package has probably been installed on your system.

This question is cross posted from Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7113768/stripping-ubuntu-10-04-server-down-to-jeos-like-setup\nI am setting up a web application to run on cloud servers that will be created and destroyed programmatically via a supplied API. For my purposes I want a stripped down version of ubuntu like JeOS, to which I would be adding Node.js and some Node modules. The server company offers the ability to create custom system images by taking an image of a running server but my initial server needs to be booted with an image provided by them, in this case an Ubuntu 10.04 LAMP image. I would therefore need to strip out the unneeded packages. What is the safe way to accomplish this? Is there a list somewhere of what is included in JeOS or something similar so I can determine what is unsafe to remove?\nI want to note that I have read similar questions where uses are trying to strip the server down for performance reasons, where the key is minimizing the number of running processes and memory usage. In my situation I am looking to minimize the image size to reduce the time it takes to create a new server\n\nA: I think what you want is called Ubuntu Core.\n\nUbuntu Core is a minimal rootfs for use in the creation of custom images for specific needs. Ubuntu Core strives to create a suitable minimal environment for use in Board Support Packages, constrained or integrated environments, or as the basis for application demonstration images. It is available for the i386, amd64, and armel architectures.\n\nHere's a build example. Hope this helps.\n\nA: Turnkey Linux ha a couple minimal versions, one of which is called literally 'Bootstrap JEOS', based off 10.04 LTS server.  Might be worth looking into, although their 'Core' image might be more useful, or just use their default LAMP image and be done with it...\n", "Q: php5-fpm incomplete install - no config file I've set up a server with Ubuntu 11.04 and Nginx+PHP-FPM+Varnish+APC+MySQL+Memcached+WordPress. Everything runs pretty nice, but there is a tiny problem with the PHP-FPM service. Install goes OK after the usual\napt-get install php5-fpm\n\nBut when you start the service, there is a problem with the config file. It seems that comes from the Debian package, that uses certain directory (/var/www) that it is used there, but not by default in Ubuntu. So each time I restart the service, I get this: \n# service php5-fpm start\n * Starting PHP5 FPM...\nAug 19 20:57:31.622788 [WARNING] [pool www] pm.start_servers is not set.

Where do I have to put the right config file for PHP-FPM??\n\nA: From the OP:\n\nLooking for more config files I've finally found the one that allows me to set the right parameters. It is\n/etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf\n\nThere you can find most of the parameters needed to restart PHP-FPM with the settings anyone can need.

This doesn't do anything for me in this situation, and I end up having to close the window, and reconnect.\nIs there a way to enable Ctrl+C to work normally, or is there a different key sequence in Ubuntu that will implement the break?\n\nA: This incessant trapping of the interrupt signal (control C) has been bothering me for many years.  When I hit CTRLC in a program, it's because I want keyboard control back, and I want that control back immediately, with prejudice.  There's no reason for something like 'less' to ignore control C.  It's a bad design decision.\nFortunately, there's another key combination which is not (yet) being ignored by most programs:  control-\\.  This sends an 'abort' signal which is generally not trapped that also serves to give you back control of your terminal.\n\nA: You can quit man (which uses less) by pressing q.\n", "Q: Memory stick not formatting? I have a 8gb memory stick pro duo that is refusing to format or be read correctly.\nWhile deleting a file off of it from my Playstation Portable, the battery got accidentally knocked out.\nNow, nothing is able to read it.\nI get this message when i try to format it:\nError creating file system: \nhelper exited with exit code 1: helper failed with:\nmkfs.vfat: failed whilst writing FAT\nmkfs.vfat 3.0.9 (31 Jan 2010)\n\nTwo methods for reading off the stick are by inserting it directly into the computer or by putting it in my playstation and connecting to it through a wire. When I use the latter method and attempt to open it, I can see a bunch of files with random symbols as names (forum isn't allowing me to post a screenshot). \nAnyone know how I can fix this? Be specific with instructions, especially ones that involve terminal because I am new to Linux.Thanks in advance.\n\nA: With the stick connected to the PC try to give the following command (and if the rest of my answer is not helpful) add the output to your question:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nSearch for the device name of this 8 Gb stick. Let's assume it is sdc1 do a:\ncd / \nsudo umount -l /dev/sdc1 \nsudo swapoff /dev/sdc1 \nsudo sfdisk -R /dev/sdc\n\n\n*\n\n*1st command is to make sure you are not cd'd into the USB stick. Could be cd /tmp/ if you want.\n\n*2nd command is an unharmful un-mounting.\n\n*Execution of the 2nd and 3rd command might get you error messages.\n\nRegarding the last command:\n\n*\n\n*sfdisk is a partition table manipulator.\n\n*The last command will make the kernel re-read the partition table and should not end up in an error. It is important that does not give any error and if it does add it to your question.  A typical error that it could show is: device busy for revalidation (usage = 2).\n\nIf need be:\ncat /proc/partitions\nsudo sfdisk -uM -s /dev/sdc\nsudo sfdisk -uM -s /dev/sdc1\n\nshould each report the filesize if you are in doubt of the actual device name. The 1st one will also show other partitions so you can also use this as an alternative to the 2nd command (sudo fdisk -l). Or as confirmation you are doing it correctly :)\nUp to here it is all undoable.\nIf you do not get any errors type in:\nsudo sfdisk /dev/sdc <<EOF \n,, c \nEOF\n\nThis will totally kill the partition table so be careful to type it correctly. If you decide to copy/paste this do not copy/paste this as one block but do each line seperately.\nNext is a reread of the partition table:\nsudo sfdisk -R /dev/sdc1\n\nAnd this command should start formatting it:\nsudo mkfs.vfat -c -F 32 -n LABEL -v /dev/sdc1\n\n\n*\n\n*I have ofcourse not tested this but I am fairly sure I made no typos :)\n\n*And again: this -will- delete any contents on the USB flash drive.\n\n\nA: I've seen memory sticks that wont format after having ISO9660 images on them, whatfixed it for me was writing zeros first.\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/the-device bs=512\nlet it run for a minute or so, then ctrl-z to stop it\nthen try formatting again.\n\nA: I had the same problem before.

Most R packages are in the gnu-r section, and typing + on the section header will install all packages in the section. For more precise matching, press l to limit the display and enter ^r-cran- as the regexp, then press + on the “Not Installed Packages” line. You will get a conflict notice that you can resolve by pressing . a few times then ! to validate the solution.\nYou can use aptitude from the command line too. aptitude '~n^r-cran-.*' selects all the r-cran- packages for installation, then choose your desired conflict resolution.\nIf you don't want to use aptitude or want a non-interactive solution, you can generate the list of packages with apt-cache r-cran-, so:\napt-get install $(apt-cache r-cran- | grep -Fvx r-cran-vr)\n\n", "Q: How can I change the order of cycling windows in Unity launcher?

I've been wondering why canonical releases a *.04 release (ubuntu), advertises that it is supported for three years, and then a *.10 release comes out and isn't supported for three years.\nMy question: what's different about the *.10 release?\n\nA: Canonical has Long Term Support releases that are supported for three years on the desktop and 5 years on servers. These are released every two years on even numbered April releases. (So your comment about April releases is only half right. For example, 9.04 wasn't an LTS release but 10.04 was).\nCanonical does this to ensure that people will have support (security fixes, backported drivers, etc) of their operating system for a long period of time, while enabling Canonical to have major releases on a comparatively fast and regular schedule. (There aren't many other operating systems that put out releases every six months).\nIt's great for server admins as well as large adopters of the system because they don't need to upgrade as frequently and they have a long term upgrade schedule ahead of time.\nNote: from 12.04LTS, the LTS-versions are supported for 5 years\nMore info:\n\n\n*\n\n*What's the difference between a Long Term Support Release and a Normal Release?\n\nA: That's not how it is, actually. Ubuntu is released every six months, approximately. This is among other things in order to stay current with Gnome, who also releases every six months. Other distros and upstreams are doing the same thing now, and I think the main argument is that it keeps the energy up on the developer side, and keeps the expectations high on the consumer side. Although most of the releases have been on time, the first LTS version, the Dapper Drake was delayed two months because it wasn't ready. So it became 6.06 instead of 6.04. We also had a 10.07 which was for ARM SmartBooks. That's one of the reasons why we use these nicknames. They're alphabetical, so if we're on Natty now, it makes sense that the next one is Oneiric, and that 12.04 will be called P-something.\nAnyway. Every fourth version is marked as an LTS. This means that in even years, the april version is an LTS, but not in odd years. Why every fourth? Supporting an operating system is lots of work and you really have to limit it. But you also want to support some versions for a longer period of time so that businesses and normal consumers can use it without having to upgrade all the time. I suppose every two years is a nice and round number. Other than that, there's probably no good reason. \nNote: from 12.04LTS, the LTS-versions are supported for 5 years\n", "Q: Ubuntu detects another monitor when I don't have any other monitor Ubuntu detects a DVI monitor even if I don't have any.

In cleaning up an answer today, I noted the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*LTS desktops get updates for three years\n\n*LTS servers get updates for five years\n\n*An Ubuntu desktop is (essentially) a superset of server packages.\n\n\nSo in the fourth and fifth year, if LTS Server gets Kernel updates*, are these also provided for LTS Desktop? What about other core-system stuff?\n\n\n*\n\n*I realise the Kernel is a little special because there is a -server variant but are updates pushed for -generic (et al) too?\n\n\nA: 12.04 LTS and future releases\n12.04LTS and further LTS releases are planned to have upgrades both for the desktop and server version for 5 years after release date.\nYou can read in the Ubuntu LTS wiki page:\n\nA new LTS version is released every 2 years. In previous releases, a Long Term Support (LTS) version had 3 years support on Ubuntu (Desktop) and 5 years on Ubuntu Server. Starting with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, both versions will receive 5 years support. There is no extra fee for the LTS version; we make our very best work available to everyone on the same free terms. Upgrades to new versions of Ubuntu are and always will be free of charge. \n\nNon LTS release will still be maintained and will receive updates for 18 moths after release date.\n\nA: Yes, an LTS desktop gets upgrades for server packages after three years. If you have openssh-server installed on your desktop, for instance, then that will be supported for five years because it is a server package. Desktop applications still gets unsupported after three years. When 12.04LTS is released, the LTS support period is upgraded from three years on the desktop to five years on everything. \nYou can use the command ubuntu-support-status to get an overview.\nFor versions prior to 12.04LTS, I would expect the desktop kernel to not be supported after three years. The desktop really is not supported after three years, even if some of the packages would be. Again, this changes when 12.04LTS is released. \n", "Q: What do I do once a branch is marked as 'Needs Fixing' I have a branch to be merged here:\nhttps://code.launchpad.net/~headbangerkenny/ubuntuone-android-music/branch/+merge/71364\nI got told what I needed to fix and did that, do I need to set anything else?\nI can't find any kind of help on help.launchpad.net so I'm stuck\n(It's probably something really really silly, but ya know!)\n\nA: Looking at your merge request, you need to leave a comment saying \"I did what you asked, it's ready now\".

It is based on infrstructure that is no longer being used by anyone.\nIf you like that type of setup, then I would recommend you have a look at Xfce. I think xfce4-panel is much better than gnome-panel, and it's actively developed. I believe their panel plugins are mostly written in Vala. But Xfce4 is also able to use gnome-panel applets if you install xfce4-xfapplet-plugin.\nBecause of all the modernization (gnome-panel has been unchanged for years) it's become a little more difficult to start programming.

As Ubuntu and Gnome gets modernized, Xfce begins to look like a natural replacement for the \"conservative Gnome\" that many are used to. And even if the modern desktops are nice, some people will prefer the old ways. But can you simply switch from Gnome 2 to Xfce4 or are there things to consider? I am asking this as a single question, but it can obviously be broken down into many: \n\n\n*\n\n*Can I still use the app-indicators that I'm used to?\n\n*Can I still use Gnome panel applets? \n\n*Is it possible to use Compiz with the plugins I've been using? \n\n*Can I use custom launchers and docks like I can in Gnome 2?\n\n*Can I use the same themes, icons, etc? \n\n*Is it ok to just install xubuntu-desktop on my Ubuntu install, or should I install Xubuntu from scratch?\n\n\nSince I haven't done this, I don't know what questions to ask. So even if I haven't asked them, please do answer them if there are important things to consider. \n\nA: Xfce4-panel can use Gnome panel applets if you install the package xfce4-xfapplet-plugin. Not all applets will make as much sense though. The session applet, for instance, will attempt to log you out of Gnome 2, which isn't running, so it will do nothing. The same goes for applets that handle the screensaver and other such DE-specific things. In those cases, the xfce4-panel will have its own plugins that provides these features. \nApp-indicators are based on DBus, which means they can be used on any desktop environment that supports it. This is one of the big benefits of indicators. They'll work well on KDE, Gnome Shell, Unity, LXDE, Xfce or any other environment. I do believe that there is a native xfce4 plugin to display indicators, but in any case, you'll be able to use the Gnome panel applet just as you did in Gnome.\nUsing a custom dock like Docky or AWN, should not be a problem at all. I haven't tried it. \nI see no reason why you shouldn't be able to use Compiz and all its plugins. I haven't tried that either. But I have used Xfce4-panel with Compiz, and that works well. \nYou can use the same icons, but window decorators will be different. Perhaps if you use Compiz, you can still use the other themes, but I don't know. \nYou can just install xubuntu-desktop, except for a single conflict: the notification system. You'll be told that ubuntu-desktop needs to be uninstalled, but that will not uninstall all your software. However, since both Gnome and Xfce provides tools to handle screensavers, sessions, etc, it might be cleaner to do a fresh install. \n\nA: As I did this about a week ago, here is an updated answer for 12.10:\n\n\n*\n\n*xfce4-xfapplet-plugin is no longer available in Ubuntu repositories, and wouldn't really be useful even if it was, because xfce is currently based on gtk2 and so xfapplet would only be able to show gtk2 gnome-panel applets, none of which are available in the Ubuntu repositories. So basically, no, you cannot use gnome-panel applets in Xubuntu any more, not without compiling loads of software yourself.\n\n*likewise, app-indicators are barely supported for the same reason. Anything which goes through indicator-application will work eg weather, cpufreq, skype. The sound indicator still has a gtk2 port. None of the really important stuff (datetime, session, messaging, printers, bluetooth) are still maintained as gtk2 ports, so these won't be available in Xubuntu 12.10. Some of them have equivalent plugins in xfce, some don't. You'll rely much more on the old gnome2-style notification icons which don't work at all with multimonitor.\n\n*xfce supplies different default applications. The main thing missing from these is Ubuntu One integration, especially in the file manager and music apps.\n\n*compiz still works just the same as it always did, although 0.9 is somewhat less stable and slower than 0.8. If you want to configure the compiz window decorations you need to use gnome-tweak-tool. All the plugins like desktop wall work just the same with xfce4-panel as they did with gnome-panel. You will need to configure compiz from scratch because the defaults have been totally changed to accommodate Unity.\n\n*xfce supports gtk2 themes, though if you want all your gtk applications to look decent you need to find a gtk theme that supports both gtk2 and gtk3, which dramatically limits your choices. Basically light-themes are still the best. The icon packs (ubuntu-mono-light/dark) work fine.\n\n*Whether to install xubuntu-desktop or ubuntu-desktop? If you install them both you will get two text editors, two video players, two file managers etc etc. which is not a good thing at all when you have a \"start menu\" style desktop. But as noted above, the xubuntu-desktop apps really aren't as good as their gnome counterparts. There are a few other minor irritations eg the default Xubuntu screensaver isn't smart enough to know not to activate when you are watching a video or playing a fullscreen game. So if you only want a traditional panel type desktop you are probably better off installing ubuntu-desktop and then installing xfce4-panel and dependencies, and not the full xubuntu-desktop. That's my recommendation anyway.\n", "Q: Command line archive manager / extracter I keep forgetting all the corresponding extract commands for every compression format.\nSo I was thinking about writing a script that merely maps file extensions to the appropriate extract command. But I guess something like this already exists, I just can't find it.\nI would be happy with something like file-roller, but file-roller is a GUI tool.\n\nA: What hasn't yet been mentioned is the swiss-army-knife of command-line utilities: atool; it is available in the repositories: click atool  or run sudo apt-get install atool.  \natool is actually a script comprising various functions such as aunpack, apack, als, acat, adiff, and arepack. Probably the most common use of the program is to extract archives using the aunpack command. There are quite a few interesting and useful options, but the basic way to extract most archives is just to run, for example,\naunpack myarchive.tar\n\nThe support for tar, 7z, zip, jar, rar, ar, lha and many more archive formats and their variations are documented by entering man atool in the terminal or by viewing the Ubuntu manpage online. \nSo, the useful thing is that if you have a tar, zip and gz archive in the same folder, all you need to do to extract them all is to run\naunpack -e *\n\nand all supported archives will be unpacked with their folder structure retained. If the name of the resulting folder already exists, it will not be overwritten, but will be given a unique name like unpack-5645. \nOr if you want to choose just one type of archive and unpack them all, instead use \naunpack -e *.zip\n\nIf you need files unpacked directly in a particular directory, with only the sub folder directory structure being retained (if it exits), enter, for example,\naunpack -e Scripts11.zip -X /home/mike/Videos\n\nIf a file with the same name already exists, you will be prompted for an action either to rename or overwrite unless you have specified the force option (-f) in the command.\nAs the manpage notes, aunpack first extracts\n\nfiles  to  a  unique\n         (temporary) directory, and then mov[es] its contents back  if  possible.\n         This also prevents local files from being overwritten by mistake.\n\n\nWith the other tools, other actions are possible, as mentioned by the man page:\n\n\n*\n\n*apack creates archives from the files or folder specifies or stdin\n\n*als  lists files within the specifies archive\n\n*acat enables one to extract archive files to stdout\n\n*adiff enables you to compare the two archives specified\n\n*arepack makes it possible to convert one archive format to another by placing the contents of the original archive in a temporary folder and then repacking the new one.\n\n\n\nThere are many more useful options for all of the utilities, but probably the one used the most will be aunpack, as that makes it so easy to extract multiple, different archives. It is great to be able to just issue one command and be able to extract multiple different archive formats without having to use the various commands for tar, zip, etc.\nFor a very recent article describing how to integrate the atool functions into the custom actions of your filemanager, such as Thunar, see this online magazine.\n\nA: There is a tool called dtrx -- do the right extraction.\nInstall it from the Ubuntu repositories and run dtrx somefile.someext. The tool will interactively query the user about nested archives (zip of zip files).\ndtrx is a sophisticated version of frabjous's extract.\n\nA: A couple of suggestions:\nunp\nunp (available from software-center) is a small perl module that will decompress a wide variety of archives into the current folder.  Use unp -s for the archive formats it supports\nBy default, it decompresses archives into the current folder.\nfile-roller\nfile-roller itself can be run from the command line. Use file-roller -h <archive name> to decompress the archive.\n\nA: From here, to put in your .bashrc:\nextract () {\n   if [ -f $1 ] ; then\n      case $1 in\n         *.tar.bz2)   tar xjf $1      ;;\n         *.tar.gz)   tar xzf $1      ;;\n         *.bz2)      bunzip2 $1      ;;\n         *.rar)      rar x $1      ;;\n         *.gz)      gunzip $1      ;;\n         *.tar)      tar xf $1      ;;\n         *.tbz2)      tar xjf $1      ;;\n         *.tgz)      tar xzf $1      ;;\n         *.zip)      unzip $1      ;;\n         *.Z)      uncompress $1   ;;\n         *)         echo \"'$1' cannot be extracted via extract()\" ;;\n      esac\n   else\n      echo \"'$1' is not a valid file\"\n   fi\n} \n\n\nA: What kind of formats do you need to deal with?  One way is to write a shell script, which checks the extensions of its argument.  Or, if all you deal with is variations on .tar.*, simply doing tar -xf will deal with most of those automatcially.  (I therefore only remember that and unzip which suffice for everything I usually come across.)\n", "Q: Upgrading to 10.04 broke my TrueMobile 1150 wireless My laptop was running 8.04 LTS (hardy), using network manager I believe, and the wireless worked fine.

The server is installed in the root directory itself, so I don't want to  risk losing any data.\nPlease give me some tips to help sort out this problem. \n\nA: Following the instructions on the Ubuntu community docs I discovered a massive trash file -- it looked like a backup of /var/log/syslog.1, presumably something was spewing loads of output to syslog...\nThe command that found it was:\nsudo find / -size +1G\n\nAnd then any large file in a folder called .Trash is probably good to delete...\n\nA: I successfully cleared 3.5 GB by removing old headers and images.\nPlease note on some systems this also attempts to remove the current kernel which is not a great idea - see comments below for how to check.\nI used the following command:\ndpkg -l 'linux-*' | sed '/^ii/!d;/'\"$(uname -r | sed \"s/\\(.*\\)-\\([^0-9]\\+\\)/\\1/\")\"'/d;s/^[^ ]* [^ ]* \\([^ ]*\\).*/\\1/;/[0-9]/!d' | xargs sudo apt-get -y purge\n\nYou can check what packages will be purged executing the first part of the command:\ndpkg -l 'linux-*' | sed '/^ii/!d;/'\"$(uname -r | sed \"s/\\(.*\\)-\\([^0-9]\\+\\)/\\1/\")\"'/d;s/^[^ ]* [^ ]* \\([^ ]*\\).*/\\1/;/[0-9]/!d'\n\nReference\n\nA: Recently I faced similar situation. Too many applications got installed and they started using my root mount space. I am listing out few steps which I followed and hoping that you could also use the same.\n\n\n*\n\n*Clean apt-get cache. Following command will remove all downloaded deb files from apt-get cache directory.\nRun this command: sudo apt-get clean \n\n*Move /home mount point to different drive. Previously, my home folder was situated  on root drive. So I moved my home folder to separate drive. This helped me to release lot of stress from root mount because most of applications store their data in /home/user_name/ folder. Read how to move home folder to separate drive.\n\n*Increase size of root partition I know it is very obvious answer. But believe me, our data need changes over the time. I thought 20 GB /root mount would suffice but withing a year I have re-sized my root mount and increased to 50 GB. \n\nA: Use dpkg-query to find the largest packages and remove the ones you don't need anymore (source):\ndpkg-query --show --showformat='${Package;-50}\\t${Installed-Size}\\n' | sort -k 2 -n | grep -v deinstall | awk '{printf \"%.3f MB \\t %s\\n\", $2/(1024), $1}'\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu, each folder can have its own filesystem. That means you can move any folder onto its own partition, another disk or even on a remote network. This is particularly popular for home directories, since that means you can reinstall Ubuntu without changing your personal settings or loosing any files. It's also popular in networks where users should be able to log onto different machines and still get their personal settings and files. But it is useful in many different cases, such as yours.\nApplications aren't installed into a specific folder, like you seem to suggest. Different parts of the application is placed in different parts of the filesystem. The main program is usually placed in /usr/bin, whereas configuration files are placed in /etc, for instance. In your case, MySQL, the databases themselves are placed somewhere in /var. I think /var/mysql.\nSince /usr and /var are both directories in the root filesystem, they will use the root filesystems space. But as I said, you can move them to different filesystems. In the case of MySQL, you can configure where databases are stored. You could easily move databases to /home/username/.mysql/databases for instance. \n\nA: Here is a script I run to free space on root partition\nfunction myclean {\n    ## Show free space\n    df -Th | grep -v fs\n    # Will need English output for processing\n    LANG=en_GB.UTF-8\n\n    ## Clean apt cache\n    apt-get update\n    apt-get -f install\n    apt-get -y autoremove\n    apt-get clean\n\n    ## Remove old versions of snap packages\n    snap list --all | while read snapname ver rev trk pub notes; do\n        if [[ $notes = *disabled* ]]; then\n            snap remove \"$snapname\" --revision=\"$rev\"\n        fi\n    done\n    ## Set snap versions retain settings\n    if [[ $(snap get system refresh.retain) -ne 2 ]]; then snap set system refresh.retain=2; fi\n    rm -f /var/lib/snapd/cache/*\n\n    ## Remove old versions of Linux Kernel\n    # This one-liner is deprecated since 18.04\n    # dpkg -l 'linux-*' | sed '/^ii/!d;/'\"$(uname -r | sed \"s/\\(.*\\)-\\([^0-9]\\+\\)/\\1/\")\"'/d;s/^[^ ]* [^ ]* \\([^ ]*\\).*/\\1/;/[0-9]/!d' | xargs apt-get -y purge\n    # New 2 lines to remove old kernels\n    dpkg --list | grep 'linux-image' | awk '{ print $2 }' | sort -V | sed -n '/'\"$(uname -r | sed \"s/\\([0-9.-]*\\)-\\([^0-9]\\+\\)/\\1/\")\"'/q;p' | xargs apt-get -y purge\n    dpkg --list | grep 'linux-headers' | awk '{ print $2 }' | sort -V | sed -n '/'\"$(uname -r | sed \"s/\\([0-9.-]*\\)-\\([^0-9]\\+\\)/\\1/\")\"'/q;p' | xargs apt-get -y purge\n\n    ## Rotate and delete old logs\n    /etc/cron.daily/logrotate\n    find /var/log -type f -iname *.gz -delete\n    journalctl --rotate\n    journalctl --vacuum-time=1s\n\n    ## Show free space\n    df -Th | grep -v fs\n}\n\n\nA: I've just created a bash script to do that:\nIMPORTANT: before run this script reboot your system to ensure you have the last installed kernel running\n#!/bin/bash\n\nset -eu\n\n# REBOOT first to ensure you have the last installed kernel running\n\n# clean Journal\nsudo journalctl --vacuum-size=50M\n\n# clean old unused kernels\nsudo dpkg -l 'linux-*' | sed '/^ii/!d;/'\"$(uname -r | sed \"s/\\(.*\\)-\\([^0-9]\\+\\)/\\1/\")\"'/d;s/^[^ ]* [^ ]* \\([^ ]*\\).*/\\1/;/[0-9]/!d'\n\n# clean apt packages\nsudo apt autoremove  \nsudo apt clean\n\n# first ensure to have the configured snap retain to 2\nsudo snap set system refresh.retain=2\n\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8 snap list --all | awk '/disabled/{print $1, $3}' |\nwhile read snapname revision; do\n   sudo snap remove \"$snapname\" --revision=\"$revision\"\ndone\n\nThis will free up the common system garbage from journal logs, unused kernels and old snap packages.\nI've just cleaned up to 7GB.\nOTHER TIP:\nIf you use Docker, consider moving the content of /var/lib/docker in your home partition: https://www.guguweb.com/2019/02/07/how-to-move-docker-data-directory-to-another-location-on-ubuntu/\n\nA: For me, the issue was dangling and unused Docker images, and volumes.\nI use the following command to find how much space can be reclaimed:\ndocker system df\n\nNext, if you intend to prune only dangling images:\ndocker system prune \n\nIf you want to go all in and do a deep clean, then prune with force:\ndocker system prune -af --volumes\n\nI reclaimed about 70 GB back.

They also then say to 'Reboot your system' (which seems to be so that you can see the cleaned up boot menu) so in this case isn't necessary.\nThe grub bootloader menu used to show all the older kernel versions on the main page, but they are now placed out of the way behind a sub-menu. It's much neater but a newcomer to Ubuntu/Linux may not be aware that they are there taking up space.\nAs suggested, don't remove the current kernel and it's also advisable to keep the previous kernel version too, just in case you need to roll back to that one.\nThere are faster ways to do this, but I prefer the simplicity of this method, mainly because I can understand each command along the way:\n\"What kernel version am I using? What kernel versions do I have? Okay, purge that one.\"\nRinse, repeat, admire the space you've freed up.\nIt's fairly easy to copy the name of the specific older kernel you want to remove from the results that dpkg --list | grep linux-image gives you in the terminal, and then use sudo apt-get purge and paste the copied name in.\nRemoving 3 or 4 older kernels will usually free up about a GB of space in your root drive.\n\nA: When I need make more free space on servers I use this command:\nfind / -type f -size +50M -exec du -h {} \\; | sort -n\n\nIt finds all files bigger than 50 MB and \"du -h\" make a better list of files and \"sort -n\" after pipe make list numerically sorted by file size. \n\nA: You cannot change the path where the package manager install applications. Most application files are saved to /usr. If you want to recover space on the root partition, moving /usr to a different partition is a possible solution.\nFrom comments:\n\n\n*\n\n*Preserve the permissions when copying, i.e. better use the command line if you are unsure what your file manager will do.\n\n*The right way to this, is to mount a new filesystem to /usr or use mount --bind. It's not clear how well a symlink would work. \n\nA: If you have a lot of seperate filesystems, the following trick might prove handy: Mount / another time, but this time under /mnt. Now all of your searching for large or many files can be done, without traversing wrong fileystems. \nIt can also help you find the files that are hidden under another mount. \n\nA: As of today it's better to use the new feature (since 14.04) to remove older kernel images:\nsudo apt autoremove\n\nCheck out more details: Why doesn't Ubuntu remove old kernels automatically?\n\nA: Check which folder is taking space in the root partiion\ndu -hsc *\nI found \\timeshift folder taking most of space. (You may or may not have enabled this periodic snapshot). You can move this from root to \\home (assuming you have mounted home in a different partition). Or reduce the frequency from timeshift GUI and if you feel it is safe, delete the older backups.\n\nA: If you have mssql database server installed, that can eat up your memory. Run NCurses Disk Usage\n$ sudo ncdu / \n\nTo check what folders and files are taking max storage. The mssql data are usually stored on \n/var/opt/mssql/backup/\n\n", "Q: Can CD-RWs and DVD+/-RWs be mounted rw? @enzotib mentioned the following command\nsudo mount -o remount,rw /cdrom\n\nDoes this imply I can mount a CD or DVD in rw mode and use like a (real) filesystem? Does this work with the popular ISO-9660 filesystem, which is read-only by design? Will this create a multsession CD with one session per change (or per mount)?\nWould this work (differently) on a ISO image file on a read/write filesystem?\n\nA: You can use UDF file system as packet writing and it effectively works as USB drive (or as diskette). See this link.\nFor example, BluRay discs as well as DVDs are usign UDF file system.\nYou just need to make it with UDFtools and mount it read/write.\n\nA: No they cannot.\nTo give a quick example why they cannot be mounted rw imagine mounting a blank cdr/cdrw, there is no file system on a blank cd, how do you specify one on mount then? How do you mount something to write on that has no valid file system?\nEven nautilus with his integrated cd recording abilities does not follow that logic, the recording is not done automatically, it creates a tmp place to keep the files until you instruct to write them to a cd, blank or not.\nMounting a cdr/cdrw rw and writing on it as you with for example a USB disk is not possible.\n", "Q: Won't boot if USB stuff is plugged in? Edit: it fixed itself, but I have no idea how...\nI have a new laptop running Ubuntu 11.04.  If I have certain USB devices (a wireless mouse, or my camera, but not a USB flash drive) plugged in to any of the computer's USB ports, Ubuntu won't boot.  (They work fine as long as I plug them in once I can see an Ubuntu splash screen.)  It gets to GRUB, and if I run in recovery mode, it starts booting, then freezes at about 2 seconds, and goes to a black screen.  (Without recovery mode, it just does the black screen.) \nCtrl+Alt+F1 does nothing; I also can't ssh into it at this point.  Removing kernel options quiet splash from GRUB did nothing except give a \"Loading, please wait...\" message with the USB not plugged in; the same for replacing them with noapic.  My BIOS has no \"legacy USB\" option that I can find.\nNothing I can find in /var/log is updated when this happens, so I have no logs.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: You could do the folllowing: You could disbale the USB ports until the boot ends and then activate the USB ports: I think you could do this via vim.\ncd /etc/default\nsudo vim acpi-support\nChange the module line the following:\nMODULES=\"usbcore\"\n\nI am really not sure if this works and if this has the consequence that your USB ports doesn't work anymore  I will not take that on me. I would recommend this solution only experts who could redo this. Only works if you got usbcore. Some peaople haven't got it.\nYou should first test if you have got it:\n$ ls -l /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/usb/usbcore.o*\n\nCould also work with this folder: /usr/src/linux-your-version/drivers/usb\nThis could work because: If you start ubuntu your usb devices are of course off but after the boot they should of course be activated like after a suspend. I had this problems ones with an laptop. It would also be very cool if you tell us your exactly laptop model because it could have other reasons.\n\nA: Your do nousb as grub boot command and activate it after boot but I don't know how to. Or maybe easier disable acpi support and do a quit splash should work with: ro quiet splash noapic\n", "Q: Screen intensity before and after inactivity On my ThinkPad W520 laptop, after a short period of inactivity (eg. no mouse movement) on battery, the screen dims for power saving.

The Archive Mounter feature in recent Ubuntu editions is great: you just use it on any *.iso file and it mounts it as if you'd put a CD in the drive ... well, almost.\nIf you want to just read the data, it's great, but if you want to actually execute any programs on it (for instance, to run an old game in wine), you get an error:\n\nThe file '/home/{myName}/.gvfs/{myIsoFile}/{myExecutable}.exe' is not\n  marked as executable.  If this was downloaded or copied from an\n  untrusted source, it may be dangerous to run.  For more details, read\n  about the executable bit.\n\nIf you try use the GNOME properties dialog's Permissions tab, it tells you:\n\nThe permissions of \"/home/{myName}/.gvfs/{myIsoFile}/{myExecutable}.exe\" could not be determined.\n\nAnd if you try to sudo chmod a+x that path, you get:\n\nchmod: cannot access `/home/{myName}/.gvfs/{myIsoFile}/{myExecutable}.exe': Permission denied\n\nSo, my question is ... does anyone know how to get ISOs mounted (through the Archive Mounter) AND still be able to execute their contents?\n\nA: I tried to look if gvfs-fuse-daemon uses some kind of \"defaults\" file to no avail. I know it's not a \"gvfs\" soluction, but, if it's a problem of exec- property in the mount, you can try the old good command line: \nmkdir /tmp/try\nsudo mount -o loop,ro,exec,dev /path/to/isofile.iso /tmp/try\n\nI suppose that it could still have problems depending on the type of the filesystem in the iso image. \n", "Q: How do I enable Compiz in xubuntu? I would like to use Compiz in Xubuntu (under xfce obviously).\nI have seen this tutorial: http://www.ghacks.net/2010/07/11/run-compiz-with-xfce4/\nFirstly, this didn't work well for me, because when trying compiz –replace ccp & in a terminal, it tells me there is no plugin such as cpp, and the window decorations are lost right away.\nIs there a reliable way to run Compiz with XFCE, please? I miss my desktop cube.\nUPDATE\nThanks for the answers so far. Just running compiz --replace still causes the complete loss of window decorations.\nAlso, I tried fossfreedom's suggestion, and then I get the output below.

If you don't have it installed, then you can't load it. Try compiz --replace instead.\nAlso, if you run compiz that way, you should use the nohup command. Otherwise, when you close the terminal, compiz will also be closed. So instead, you'll write: \nnohup compiz --replace\nTry this and provide some feedback. If it doesn't work, then we'll have another look at it. :)\n\nA: You might check that window decoration is enabled in Compiz.  Run \"ccsm\" (the Compiz config manager, which should also show up in a menu somewhere).  \nIn the 'Effects' section, the \"Window Decoration\" feature should be checked.\nClick the \"Window Decoration\" box and it's settings appear; in there, the decorator command can be specified.

Doing locate bookmarks and locate bookmarks.png has turned up no useful results.\nHere is the icon that I'm looking for to change. I just need to know the path to it:\n\n\nA: You should always say which version of an application you're using when you ask for help. Is there any good reason why you were looking for bookmarks.png, or was it just a guess? :) \nIn order to find out which files that is installed with a package, use dpkg -L. I did dpkg -L firefox | less, and it showed me lots of files, including /usr/lib/firefox-6.0/chrome/icons/default\nBut that wasn't it, so I moved upwards. I eventually found file:///usr/lib/firefox-6.0/omni.jar which seems to provide the default skin. Skinning Firefox is popular, so you'll probably not have any difficulties finding information about that. \n\nA: Thanks to help from @Jo-Erlend Schinstad, I've learned that Firefox uses a sprite for some of its toolbar icons, including the icon it uses for the Bookmarks menu. The image can be found by navigating to /usr/lib/firefox-*/ (* representing the version) and opening omni.jar with Archive Manager (File Roller). Then, in Archive Manager, navigate to /chrome/browser/skin/classic/browser/. The sprite Firefox uses for its toolbar items is named Toolbar.png.\nThe reason I wanted to know this was to make the icon consistent with the Humanity icon theme. I edited changed the Bookmarks icon in the sprite to use Humanity's default Bookmarks icon.

I have windows 7 installed. The Hard disk is composed of C: for windows 7, D: recovery; E: HP tools. I want to install Ubuntu on a different partition to be safe in case I need to remove either windows or Ubuntu without any problems. \nAnother question: Does the dual boot using automatic partition by Ubuntu to solve my problem? \n\nA: When you boot to the graphical installer (not the installer in Windows) then you'll be able to choose which harddisk to install it on. If you already have Windows installed there, then you can choose how much disk space each operating system shall have. It's just a slider from 0% to 100%, although those extremes won't be valid if you want to have both. :)\nThe installer will add entries to your boot menu automatically so that you can choose between Windows and Ubuntu when you start the computer.\n\nA: Avoid using automatic-anything on a computer that already has an OS installed on it.\nWhat you should do, for example by using GParted from a Ubuntu Live CD, is to re-size one of your partitions (preferably your largest) so that you shrink it. It will then leave x amount of unallocated space, which you can select and then use to create a brand new partition where you will later install Ubuntu on. \nRepeat the process, but this time, create yet another partition that is slightly larger than your RAM.\nWhen installing Ubuntu put it on the large empty partition you created above, using a ext filesystem. You will want to mount it as \"/\". Mount the other smaller partition as \"swap\", and then start the install.\nTo answer your other question: Dual booting doesn't touch your partitions. To speak of dual booting is just to say that you have a computer with two OS:s on it, and that you, when you start it up, are allowed to choose which one you will boot up.   \n", "Q: \"Failed to set DisplayPort power\" - Dual Head freezes OS Problem\nNo picture appears on the second, externally, connected monitor.\nAll used to work perfectly until a week ago or so.

But at boot, GDM is still the default. How can change this so LightDM is loaded automatically at boot instead of GDM?\n\nA: sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\nWill prompt you to make it default. More information here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LightDM\n\nA: Do this:\n$ sudo systemctl disable gdm.service  \n$ sudo systemctl enable lightdm.service\n\nHere enable starts service at boot. You can know more about it here.\n\nA: /etc/X11/default-display-manager should currently contain something else than lightdm.\nLike I answered in another question, since LightDM starts on your machine, you should reference the binary in /etc/X11/default-display-manager :\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"/usr/sbin/lightdm\" > /etc/X11/default-display-manager'\n\n", "Q: Automatically add/scan existing cover art in Banshee? I built my Banshee DB from scratch and am now facing the issue, that none of my albums shows cover art unless I start playing one of its songs. All the album folders contain a cover file cover.jpg and I don't want anything to be downloaded from the internet.\nI guess one workaround would be to play one song from each album for one second and then skip to the next via the remote control functionality of Banshee but that seems rather cumbersome.\nIs there already a way to trigger this cover art scan from within Banshee?\n\nA: This has been a bug which is now resolved.\n\nA: To quote Banshee maintainer Bertrand Lorentz's post on the mailing list:\n\nWith banshee 2.1.0 or later, you can tell banshee to fetch all cover \n  art by adding the --fetch-artwork command line option. \n  Just quit Banshee and type the following in a terminal : \nbanshee --fetch-artwork \n\n\nI would assume this batch artwork gathering should follow the same order of priorities as normal, so cover.jpg should be looked at before searching the internet for artwork. If you want to be extra sure, you could temporarily check the \"Disable features requiring Internet access\" box in Banshee's Edit > Preferences.\n", "Q: Hibernate option in login screen menu? How can I add a hibernate option to the GDM 3 menu? I only have suspend there but I need hibernation as it does not eat the battery. (Just to make sure - I am talking about the menu in the greeter, not in the gnome-shell itself - the system is multi-user and every user is supposed to switch to greeter and hibernate when done).\nThe hibernation itself is working just fine (from Gnome Shell menu or command line), just no option in GDM. Alternatively, custom keyboard shortcuts working under GDM would do the trick as well.\n\nA: I found a partial solution - creating a hibernation keyboard shortcut working in GDM.\nFirst I ran the following commands to enable login for gdm user:\nchsh -s /bin/bash gdm\npasswd gdm\n\nfollowed by the password. The I logged in as gdm user and adjusted the keyboard shortcuts for gdm user. I would still like to get it to the menu as well but at least a partial workaround for the moment.\n\nA: If switching to lightdm is an option, you can just enable hibernation normally (which you may have already done) like shown here. The lightdm top-right menu will contain the hibernate option, just like the in-Unity menu. You can log in to Gnome Shell just as well from lightdm.\n", "Q: DHCP-server doesn't start at boot because of wrong startup order Apparently the isc-dhcp-server is started too early in the boot sequence, it states that it has nothing to do. If I just log directly in as root and start it using the init.d-script, it starts normally.\nMy setup is basically an utterly standard router, with an eth0 on the inet side, and an eth1 on the lan side. However, I've defined a bridge instead of the eth1 for the lan-side. Thus, the lan-part of the network isn't up until the bridge is up.\nI currently believe that the dhcp server is brought up before the bridge is brought up, probably because the bridge is brought up with the 'networking' task, while the eth's are taken up with the 'network-interface' tasks - which are run earlier. (also, the bridge takes a small age to get up compared to the eth's).\nIf I do take away the bridge config, instead using eth1 directly for the lan side, things work. (However, judging by syslog, things are still tight.)\nIdeas of how the get DHCP to start later?\n(The reason for the bridge, is to be able to use KVM with bridged networking..)\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem.  \nI fixed it by editing /etc/init.d/isc-dhcp-server and adding a sleep 10 at the top.\nI tried sleep 5 but it wasn't enough. \nHopefully it will work for you too.\n\nA: Network interfaces are up only after the networking task is done in the upstart sequence.You can see at the configuration of the task in /etc/init/networking.conf that the only thing that it does is running ifup -a.\nI fixed the startup sequence by removing the isc-dhcp-server symlinks from /etc/rc?.d folders and adding a new task for the upstart. The only thing you have to do is to add a config file /etc/init/dhcp_start.conf and edit it to something like this:\n\nstart on stopped networking\nexec /etc/init.d/isc-dhcp-server start\n\nIt is a nasty hack, but works.\nYou can also add another task to gently shutdown the dhcpd on another event, like for my network:\n\nstart on stopped bridge-network-interface br0\nexec /etc/init.d/isc-dhcp-server stop\n\nI found somewhere else that people say to start dhcp on started networking instead of stopped networking. It is essentially wrong since the interfaces are configured only after ifup -a command exits and not when it is brought to life. It worked for them only accidently because ifup executing in parallel to dhcp was quite fast to finish.\n\nA: Put the correct interfaces into /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server. In my case:\nINTERFACES=\"br0 eth2\"\n\n\nA: None of the above worked for me, I finally got it working by adding these lines to my rc.local script\nsleep 10\n/etc/init.d/isc-dhcp-server start\n\nWithout the sleep 10, this had no effect, I also had trouble getting the default route to stick as well, so I added\nroute add default gw 192.168.1.1 eth1\n\n(I don't have an eth0, never have understood why)\n\nA: Try this, it worked for me:\nrm /etc/init/isc-dhcp-server.override\n\nI removed the file because it says manual inside the file.\n", "Q: How do I fix grub so that it shows up during boot? I installed Ubuntu alongside Windows but GRUB doesn't show up during boot and Windows starts instead.\nI used a liveCD and followed these instructions on the Ubuntu help wiki, but they didn't help.\nI use the standard Windows 7 bootloader. Windows came preinstalled on the desktop. I have yet to successfully boot into Ubuntu on this machine except with the live CD.\n\nA: The problem is probably due to the wrong partition being booted when the computer starts.\nTo fix this boot from a live CD\n\n\n*\n\n*Open system -> administration -> gparted partition editor\n\n*Check which partition is flagged with boot\n\nif the partition flagged with boot is ntfs (File System column) it probably means the computer boots into Windows without passing by grub. (If it is not marked with ntfs do not continue with my instructions)\n\n\nTo fix this right click on your the ext4 (File System column) (the Ubuntu partition) manage flags and select boot.\nRestart your PC and you should be presented with the GRUB menu.\nIf your computer refuses to boot after proceeding with the above steps, reboot from the live CD and mark the lately flagged ntfs partition back with boot.\n\nA: You could try pointing the \"boot\" flag for the drive to the Ubuntu partition.  I had to do this for my installation, in order to preserve the ability to use the GRUB Bootloader.\nYou can use gparted for this.  But you will have to do it from a LiveCD in order to prevent the drive from being mounted/used actively.\n", "Q: How do I add a system preferences shortcut to desktop? I removed all gnome panels and have created a beautiful desktop using \"Docky\" and \"Slingshot\" only. It sounds stupid but I'm a neat freak and panels in classic and Unity just didn't do it for me. I do not have access to my system settings, however. Is there a way I can add a real quick shortcut to the desktop so I can open it and pin to Docky?\n\nA: You can create a .desktop file or simple bash script that runs gnome-control-center. Either that or you can drag and drop that launcher from Slingshot.\n\nA: If you're using Elementary, then the simplest way I can tell you would be to open the terminal with ctrl+alt+t, then type gnome-control-center. After it's launched, right click the icon for it in Docky and choose \"Pin to Dock\".\n", "Q: How are releases named? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow are release codenames chosen? \n\nI'm not sure if there is a particular naming convention with Ubuntu. To give an example, Apple uses big cats, Microsoft uses numbers.\n\"Jaunty Jackalope\" and \"Natty Narwhal\" are creative names. I'm wondering who chooses them? Is there a pattern or something similar?\n\nA: The names are a combination of an adjective and an animal name with the same first letter. The names are alphabetical, so after Natty Narwhal (11.04) comes Oneiric Ocelot (11.10). After that comes P.P, which is scheduled for release in April 2012, and will therefore get the version number 12.04. \nSince it is possible that a release has to be delayed, it is possible that the version number will change. The Dapper Drake, for instance, was initially scheduled for April 2006, but it had to be delayed two months, so it became 6.06 instead. In that way, it's nice to have alphabetical code names. Since 12.04 hasn't been given a name yet, some people are referring to it as \"The P-cycle\". The Ubuntu Developer Summits are also named like that: UDS-P for instance, is where planning of 12.04 will take place. \nMark Shuttleworth comes up with these names. \n\nA: There's a good article about it at this link - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames - which explains the system, such as it is, and which includes a list of the names that have been given so far.\n", "Q: Bash Script: How to get file name/path Suppose I want to associate PPT files to be opened with a bash script that converts it to PDF then opens it with the approperiate PDF editor. How do I do that? \nConversion will be done with uniconv as I learnt from another question\nuniconv -f pdf presentation.odt\n\nI believe I have to change \"presentation.odt\" with the filename that triggered this script\n\nA: Do you mean that the script will be called with (for example) presentation.odt as an argument? The argument is available as \"$1\" in the script (the double quotes are required if the file name contains characters like spaces which the shell would otherwise expand). You can construct the name of the PDF file by stripping away the .odt suffix: ${1%.odt}. Note that it's unoconv, not the unrelated uniconv.\n#!/bin/sh\nunoconv -f pdf \"$1\"\nappropriate-pdf-editor \"${1%.odt}.pdf\"\n\n\nA: In a shell script, you can access command line parameters through the variable 1, 2, 3, ..., as in\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"$1\"\necho \"$2\"\necho \"$3\"\n# ...\n\nIf you need it, \"$0\" represents the script name itself.\nYou can also reassign these variable, and shift them, to access more than 9 parameters.\n\nA: If you want to find all .odt files and feed them into unoconv, you can use the find tool to find all of them, then pipe it into xargs, which can do parallel processing.\nfind * -type f -iname \"*.odt\" | xargs -i -P12 \"uniconv -f pdf {}\"\n\nThis will find all files in the running directory, recurssively, piping files that it finds into xargs, which will run up to 12 processes silmultaneously (use -P0 for unlimited processes).\n", "Q: Opening a terminal on Eee PC I have an Eee PC 1005PEB that I want to install Ubuntu on. I've tried hitting ctrl+alt+t on the Express gate screen but nothing happens. I've also tried to boot from a live CD on a usb, but nothing seems to work, I've tried it on the left & the right side ports.\nI'm not too experienced with Linux, but I've been using it on my HP Pavilion for a couple of months. Can anyone point me in the right direction?\n\nA: I don't think opening a terminal will do much good if you haven't installed Ubuntu yet.  You want to get to the BIOS menu; I don't know what it is on the Eee PC, but often you must press F2 or F12 while it boots up.  The correct key is probably in a manual somewhere or displayed on screen.  You want to choose to boot from the USB.  Then you can install Ubuntu and use a terminal to your heart's content.\n\nA: Had the same issues as I needed to resurrect an old EEE PC 1000.  The only way around this problem, I found, was to ignore terminal and install from a DVD.  The BIOS settings key at startup is F2.  Set the DVD drive as primary startup.  Also try LUBUNTU instead of UBUNTU on older EEE PCs, it works much better.\n", "Q: Why won't the terminal display new lines?

(Without exit.)\n\nA: try one or both of these:\n\n\n*\n\n*type ctrl+c, then type reset, then press enter.\n\n*type ctrl+c, then type stty sane, then press enter.\n\n\nthe ctrl+c is to clear any other characters you might have typed in the command line.\nreset or stty sane usually fixes a messed up terminal. Read the man page of reset and stty for more information.\nNote that if the terminal is messed up enough then it might be that not even ctrl+c or enter will work as expected. There are still other methods to input characters, but they involve ancient dark magic. In that case, it is usually easier to just close the terminal and start another one.\nMy understanding of the inner workings of a terminal is not deep enough to explain why or how it does that.\n\nA: It is not the intended use for vi to take input from stdin.\nAnyway, you can get newlines again with\nstty sane\n\nwithout resetting the terminal.\n", "Q: My Ubuntu One account is empty but I'm still using 8.7 MB? \nPossible Duplicate:\nUbuntu One, Dashboard shows 14.5mb used and files folder shows nothing \n\nMy Ubuntu One account is empty but the Ubuntu One website says I'm still using 8.7 megabytes. Why is this?\n\nA: At the uttermost right, there is a label containing \"More\". If you click it, then the file will be expanded like a treeview, and you'll get options to publish, download or delete the file. Also, if you login to your Ubuntu One account on your desktop, then you can delete the file in Nautilus, because deletes are also synchronized. \n\nA: Go to your Ubuntu One folder in nautilus and press CTRL+H.

This should be about 5x that for USB 2.0.\nAnyone have a clue why I am getting USB 1.0 speed out of a modern mainboard with zero USB 1.0 ports and only USB 2.0?\n\nA: Do not rely on the \"theorical speeds\". They will never be accomplished by somebody unless they are in the perfect conditions. The perfect conditions include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Correct altitude (How high or low you are influences)\n\n*Position (If you are in a city next to a power generator is not the same as in a farm)\n\n*Correct motherboard... scratch that... PERFECT motherboard to usb configuration (including the minerals used to create the part of the motherboard to connect to the usb and give those speeds)\n\n*And last... you have to be in the moon for it to work perfect ;)\n\n\nWhat am saying here is that none of the said speeds have been accomplished. None. they have only be accomplished on the labs where they made it under very strict conditions. This is why I get a little angry when they say for example:\nUSB 1.0 Full - 1.5MB/Sec <-- Not true. I always get between 100KB to 350KB. You might get a little more but not 1.5MB FTW!!\nUSB 2.0 - 60MB/Sec <--- Really? Ya Really? If you have a good motherboard and when I say good motherboard I mean one that has proven at least for a year to give good results and not some cheap one, then you might get to 40MB/Sec. I can give an example of the following which applies to many other motherboards. I have an Intel DP35DP. The front usb panel says that it supports 2.0 but somehow they do not run as fast as the back usb connections. This is true for most motherboards. In this example you can see that you have both USB supporting 2.0 but not both have the same speed because it depends on 2 things: You motherboard connection to that specific usb connector and your usb pen drive. I have 2 USB 2.0 pen drive. Both are 32GB but see here. One is Kingston Data Traveler and the other one is Sandisk. I for one are one of those that when somebody says Crucial, Kingston or Corsair and know they are good. when I tested both, in all tests Sandisk had 2x to 3x times faster speed than Kingston.\nThis made me know that, even on the same motherboard, different pen drives can have different speeds. And this changes on other motherboards. So there is no \"only speed\" for a pen drive when testing it out on several mother boards. I have to say that the max speed Sandisk gave me was 32MB/Sec to 38MB/Sec while the max Kingston gave me was 11MB/Sec to 13MB/Sec.\nNow lets go to the motherboard configuration before going to the OS. My motherboard and many, MANY others have an option in the BIOS (When you cold boot the PC press like crazy F2, DEL, F10 or ESC) until you enter: THE BIOS!\nIn the BIOS look for an option that says High Speed or Full Speed. I find it dumb that one says HIGH and the other FULL because is misleading but whatever. Select High Speed to get the 480Mb speed (Or 60MB/Sec). Full speed is just about 12Mb (Or about 1.5MB/Sec). But remember even if you save it to High Speed you will not get some crazy 60MB/Sec on your pen drive, not even external usb hard drive.\nNow after doing the BIOS part enter Ubuntu and do some tests and run some commands like 'sudo lsusb -v' to get some info on the USB ports. also you can try 'lshw' for more info on the motherboard.\nBefore I end this I wish this helps in understanding the problem that hunts us all about USB 2.0 and the \"speed\" it should have. This should solve the doubts we all have with USB ports, where to look for the problem and some knowledge about how the USB makers \"make up\" some weird speeds in TheoryLand but do not apply on RealWorldLand. Good luck.\n", "Q: What to do if my hard disk has bad sectors? I had a desktop Sony Vaio JS VGC-JS15G with a 320GB hard disk...\nI tried to install Ubuntu recently in this machine but it always stuck during the installation process..\nI had open disk utility and at the overall assesment it say Disk has bad sector.\nWhat should I do? Should I buy a new hard disk?\n\nA: I'd personally not risk any valuable data on a disk that shows any signs of failure (of which a bad sector can be).\nIf the machine is under warranty (it's 12 months), I'd just send it back (after backing up the disk - they won't recover any data for you). If it's not, it might be worth opening it up to see if the disk itself has a longer warranty with its own manufacturer and doing that.\nOtherwise just replace the disk. Small mechanical disks are cheap. Small SSDs aren't but they're superawesome.\n\nA: I'd say it's premature to pay for a new HD at this point. The install issues you have could depend on something else that's not related. Please try the alternative install cd, which lacks the fancy graphics and is a little harder to get started with, but works wonders. If that fails as well then you might have a real issue.\nTo verify if you really have hardware issues you could use http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/ or something similar.

This is my biggest issue with Linux and the main reason I don't use it as my main working OS.\nWhenever I use caps lock to write something in upper case and disable it in order to keep writing the next letter AFTER I've disabled it is written in upper case.\nSo, my text comes out weird, as SOMETHING *L*ike this\nI've tried Linux Mint, Fedora ... and the issue keeps happening.\nSearching Google I've found some very rare persons have the same issue, but I was unable to find any solution.\nIs there any way to solve this or am I DOOMED *F*or life?\nBTW, whenever I ask this question someone suggest I should learn to use shift, instead of caps lock. I know, that's the right way, but I'm used to use caps lock and, well, it should work.\n\nA: This is quite easy to fix. I have successfully used this technique on two people with a 100% success rate:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put the blade of a knife or tip of a flathead screwdriver underneath the capslock key.\n\n*Twist.\n\n\nThe key should come flying off and you can dispose of it the best way you see fit. The recovery from such an operation is surprisingly short. Your little finger (what should be controlling that stuff) should quickly learn to find the shift key.\n\nIn all seriousness this is a long-standing but extremely rare bug. By long-standing I mean there are reports of it occasionally popping up all the way back to 2003.\nUltimately this is something you either have to get onto (hunt down an X developer, give them your laptop for a few weeks and probably pay them for their time), or put up with.\nI would opt for learning to type properly. It's much quicker with the Shift key.\n\nA: Try with a different keyboard on that computer and also try the faulty keyboard on another computer, with a Linux OS. \n\n\n*\n\n*If the new keyboard works, probably your keyboard lacks compatibility with Linux.\n\n*If the new keyboard has the same problem, or something similar, I would start thinking the problem is your computer. \n\n*If the old one doesn't work on another PC, it is the faulty keyboard that is the problem. Replace it.\n\n\nSource: comment by David M. Sousa\n\nA: There are keyboards which have DIP switches to override the Caps lock key if you are willing to replace your keyboard or use an external one.\n\nA: I'm not sure why people say this is such a rare issue, it happens to me on every distro regardless of keyboard or computer. Using shift is a good workaround since it will save you time and make your life easier in the long run. I type very fast, however, so I constantly run into this caps lock issue and using shift hasn't been worth my time until now because it slows me down.\nYou can change the keyboard map on most distros to fix the issue (ish) by doing the following:\nxkbcomp -xkb $DISPLAY /home/yourusername/myxkbmap\nnano /home/yourusername/myxkbmap\nOnce you're editing the file, locate the part that says key <CAPS> and remove it. You'll find it about halfway down the file.\nReplace that line with this:\nkey <CAPS> {     repeat=no,     type[group1]=\"ALPHABETIC\",     symbols[group1]=[ Caps_Lock, Caps_Lock ],     actions[group1]=[ LockMods(modifiers=Lock), Private(type=3,data[0]=1,data[1]=3,data[2]=3) ]   };\nThen save and set the file to your keyboard map by entering\nxkbcomp /home/yourusername/myxkbmap $DISPLAY\nLimitations\nThis is not a perfect fix, and you'll notice that this kind of turns the caps lock key into a shift key itself. So before you would get something like this: \"I'M jason\" and now you'll get \"I\"m jason\".\nThis is a minor inconvenience since the only time you would notice this is if a character came right after a capital letter (like \"I'm\", but those are uncommon).\nFeel free to set this as a startup script to run each time you turn on the computer. Note: when you start from sleep the keyboard map resets so you'll have to manually run your script again.\nKnown instances of this not working\nFor some odd reason, this fix only works on Debian/Ubuntu based distros (as far as I've tested it). So forget it if you're using Fedora or OpenSUSE or something else non-Debian.\nAlso, this fix oddly doesn't work on newer kernels. I use Ubuntu 20.04 LTS a lot because it's the most recent LTS for me. As far as I've tested it works on every version except 21.04 or higher.\nI'm on the hunt for a fix for 21.04 and other systems, but since the amount of people who use caps lock to capitalize is few, almost nobody knows what the issue is or how to fix it.\nBesides that, this does work really well for me on almost every system I've ever needed. It's always the first thing I set up when I switch to a new distro. It's sad that it doesn't work on newer Ubuntu versions though.

What would be suggested as best practice?\nUPD: As I understand command sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade is only for current system update and all of it packages.\n\nA: Most of the times, upgrades are quite safe.\nUnfortunately, you can never be 100% sure that everything is going to go well.  \nSo I suggest you do what everyone does when an upgrade is imminent: backup.\nGet an external HDD or any other kind of storage (network file server...), backup all your necessary files (including configuration files for running servers like apache, samba, etc) and then proceed with the upgrade.  \nUpdate: If Ubuntu Server is an image running on a VMware Workstation, why don't you just clone/backup this image and then do the upgrade?\nYou'll have to run: sudo do-release-upgrade\nMore info can be found here\nLatest update:  \nAfter the upgrade, the screen would go black with a blinking cursor.\nWe discussed the issue and found out that grub entries had splash vt.handoff=7 appended although there was no GUI installed.\nWe then tried to edit the grub entries and delete the above parameters, which worked.\nSo we then edited /etc/default/grub and made GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"\".\nSaved the file, issued a sudo update-grub in order to update the grub menu entries and the problem was solved.\n\nA: Always assume that upgrading will fail horribly and plan your steps accordingly. \n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your files \n\n*\n\n*Make sure config files in /etc/ like apache, samba, cups etc are saved too.    \n\n*MySQL: make a mysqldump of your database. \n\n*Also think of backing up up your /home/ and shares.\n\n\n*Check that you can actually restore your backup.\n\n*It is also custom where I work to then make a full backup of the whole disc.\n\n\nWe use a second system to store an uncompressed backup so I can ssh files back to the new system. But you can also do this with a usb stick or drive if need be. 1 advantage of a virtual server you have is that you can clone your image and try the upgrade on the clone.\nDuring an update I tend to skim over the files that are getting replaced/upgraded/deleted but when you do a distro upgrade this is rather pointless.\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the upgrade and pay close attention to any errors.

When booting completes, you are switched to tty1, where you are prompted to log on. Thus, the boot messages are not actually cleared; you are simply switched to a different console from the one that contains them.\nTo view them again, you can switch to tty7 by pressing Alt+F7. You can switch back to tty1 with Alt+F1 (and to the second with Alt+F2, and so forth). This does not (and should not) apply on most Ubuntu Server systems, but when a GUI is running, Ctrl+Alt+F1 must be used to switch to tty1 (and Ctrl+Alt+F2 for tty2, and so forth).\nPreventing the screen from being cleared after a user logs out, so the text from their session is visible in the subsequent session\nIn your home directory there is a file called .bash_logout which contains something like:\nif [ \"$SHLVL\" = 1 ]; then\n    [ -x /usr/bin/clear_console ] && /usr/bin/clear_console -q\nfi\nThat is what causes the screen to be cleared on logout. To stop that from happening, comment out all those lines, so it looks like:\n#if [ \"$SHLVL\" = 1 ]; then\n#    [ -x /usr/bin/clear_console ] && /usr/bin/clear_console -q\n#fi\n\nA: After hours of googling, I found the solution in this thread and this question.\nFirst, add console=tty1 to your GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX (I also suggest to add noplymouth to inhibit plymouth and its useless splashscreen).\n#> sudo vi /etc/default/grub\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"console=tty1 noplymouth\"\n\nThis forces the kernel log to be printed on tty1 instead of tty7 and avoid the tty switch before the login prompt.\nThen just go into /etc/init and edit one or more of tty1.conf, tty2.conf, tty3.conf, tty4.conf, tty5.conf, tty6.conf or console.conf. I edited them all adding --noclear option to the getty command. For example, editing tty1.conf:\n#> sudo vi /etc/init/tty1.conf\n\nyou'll have to replace:\nrespawn\nexec /sbin/getty -8 38400 tty1\n\nwith:\nrespawn\nexec /sbin/getty -8 38400 --noclear tty1\n\nThat's all, run sudo update-grub and now your system should boot in a single tty without clearing it.\n\nA: for systemd set TTYVTDisallocate to no.\nto achieve this, run systemctl edit getty@tty1  and enter the code below\n[Service]\nTTYVTDisallocate=no\n\n", "Q: Is pad.ubuntu.com available for everyone?

I've bought the HP LaserJet Pro P1102w. \nI want to use it with Ubuntu Lucid (10.04), but it is not in the list of supported printers. How can I install this printer on Lucid?\n\nA: Your particular printer is supported via the hplip library.  Unfortunately, the version by default in lucid is too old for your printer - lucid has version 3.10.2 and you require at a minimum v3.10.4\nThere is a \"untrusted\" PPA on launchpad with the latest version which you can install - this is from the hplip development team.\nIf you install this PPA, it will upgrade your lucid hplip library.  Next time you plug in your printer it should then be recognised correctly.\nThe PPA's name is: ppa:hplip-isv/ppa, you need to add it to your software sources, which you can do by following these instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What are PPAs and how do I use them?\nOr via the command line:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:hplip-isv/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get hplip\n\n\nRelated Questions: \n\n\n*\n\n* Are \"PPA's\" safe to add to my system, and what are some \"red flags\" to watch out for?\n\n* How to install ppa packages in an apt-get style\n\nA: Thanks for your answers.

I use the USB-connection, so I haven't tried it with the WiFi yet.\nThe P1102w uses the driver foo2zjs, but I needed a version newer than 2010-05-28.\nThe version in Lucid (10.04) is too old, but the one in Maverick (10.10) works fine. \nLuckily it's possible to install the package from Maverick in Lucid without dependency problems.\nInstructions for everyone who needs it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to http://packages.ubuntu.com/maverick/foo2zjs\n\n*Download the right package. Don't know if you need amd64 or i386? Type in a terminal: dpkg --print-architecture\n\n*Install gdebi if you don't have it already: sudo aptitude install gdebi\n\n*Install the printer driver: gdebi foo2zjs_*.deb\nIf you already have an older version of foo2zjs, you can replace the last two steps with (I didn't test this): dpkg -i foo2zjs_*.deb\n\nA: That printer works with hplip version 3.10.4+ (source). It works over USB, UTP and even the wireless works.\nLucid uses 3.10.2-2 according to package.ubuntu.com so you will need to install the newer version and that can be found on sourceforge.\n\nA: Switch the printer off. Hold the buttons WLAN and RESET down and switch the printer on.\nUbuntu will start the printer installation. Then the printer should work.\nIf that doesn't work, proceed as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the driver from the HP-Home-Page by choosing (Linux-Ubuntu-10.04)\n\n*Copy the printer driver (e.g., hplip-3.11.7.run) from the download area to the desktop.\n\n*Open the terminal and enter at the prompt: cd desktop\n\n*At the next prompt enter: sh hplip-3.11.7.run\n\n*A longer routine begins with several questions to answer in between.\n\n*At the end try to print a test page.

I'll be happy to hear what can I do.\n\nA: Just to make sure: please check your BIOS and confirm you did not put 'boot from LAN' as the 1st boot option. I assume it is not since moving the lid crashes your system.\nPXE errors are generated by the network boot ROM: the boot process is attempting a network boot (probably your BIOS' 4th boot option), which means that your system was unable to boot from a HDD, CD-ROM, or USB device (the 'standard' first 3 boot options).\nThe error you posted \"media test failure, check cable\" to me holds the most sensible answer: the hardware inside is faulty. When moving the lid it causes a power shortout causing it to reboot/crash. Find someone or a company that can safely open it and have a look inside. \nI do not believe it to be a HDD failure that would result in other type of errors more focused on files not found. You can some what try to confirm this by inserting a bootable cd and start from it. Move the lid and if it crashes you can comfirm it to be more likely to be hardware related.\n", "Q: Changing permissions on serial port I'm using the Arduino IDE in Ubuntu, and am having issues with the serial port. It has worked in the past, but for reasons that may be unnecesary, I felt the need to change the ownership of some of the files from root ownership to my users ownership.\nThis made the IDE work correctly, but I lost the ability to use the correct serial port.  In the dev folder, the port I need is listed as permission 166. Someone (who is no longer in the area to help me) swapped the permissions to 666, which made it all work gloriously.\nHowever, it reverted back as soon as I restarted my computer, and if I now try to use the command:\nsudo chmod 666 ttyACM0\n\nnothing happens. No error messages, but no permission change either.  \nHow can I change it, and how can I get it to change permanently.\nI apologize if this question is overly simplistic or unclear, I'm an ubuntu noob, and I wouldn't begrudge feedback!\n\nA: The issue with the permissions for /dev/ttyACM0 can be permanantly solved by adding yourself to the dialout group.\nYou can do this with:\n\n*\n\n*sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER\n\n\n*Logout and then log back in for the group changes to take effect.\n\nA: I couldn't get Rinzwind's suggestion to work, because it complained that the user account already exists. Instead, I used this command to add an existing user (terrik) to an existing group (dialout), as described on the Ubuntu Help Wiki.\nsudo adduser terrik dialout\n\nAlso useful is this command for listing your current groups, although as Rinzwind says, you have to log out and log in before the serial port starts letting you in.\ngroups terrik\n\n\nA: Try going into System / Users and Groups and checkeing the box on your username in the TTY Group.\n\nA: Another possibility is to make a rules file in /etc/udev/rules.d/ directory. I had similar problem and I have created 50-myusb.rules file in the above directory with this content:\nKERNEL==\"ttyACM[0-9]*\",MODE=\"0666\"\n\nNote that this will give any device connected to ttyACM socket read/write permissions. If you need only specific device to get read/write permissions you must also check idVendor and idProduct. You can find those by running lsusb command twice, once without your device connected and once when it is connected, then observe the additional line in the output. There you will see something like Bus 003 Device 005: ID ffff:0005. In this case idVendor = ffff and idProduct = 0005. Yours will be different. Than you modify the rules  file to:\nACTION==\"add\", KERNEL==\"ttyACM[0-9]*\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"ffff\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"0005\", MODE=\"0666\"\n\nNow only this device gets the permissions.

I installed Ubuntu 11.04 on Virtual Box.  It had poor performance (had low max resolution, cursor was choppy when going across the screen, none of the unity stuff was there), until I installed the Virtual Box Guest additions.  After installing the guest additions, everything worked beautifully until I an update through the update manager.  Everything looked like crap again (the unity stuff is gone, and the mouse cursor lags when going across the screen, overall just doesn't look nearly as nice as it did pre-update).  \nI reran the guest additions installer and everything is almost back to normal (the mouse cursor is one cm off target and there is an inch at the bottom of the screen which you can't use), but I would like to mitigate this for future updates.  Is there a way to mitigate this issue when installing updates?\n\nA: [Solved it] It was the same problem. It's suddenly occurred after Ubuntu update\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install dkms\n\n*sudo /etc/init.d/vboxadd setup\n\n*Insert CD VBoxGuestAdditions.iso\n\n*sudo sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\n  after do it anything not occur.\n\n*very important: Turn off the machine and reboot it.  \n\n\nRef: http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#idp11306688\n\nA: This should have been taken care of by dkms - this builds kernel support each time the kernel is updated.\nEnsure dkms is installed before the next time you run the VBoxGuestAdditions module\ni.e.\nsudo apt-get install dkms\ncd /cdrom\nsudo sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions-x86.run\n\n\nA: You should re-install the guest additions every time you update virtualbox. For the latest guest additions I think they update the kernel modules automatically if you update the kernel with apt.\nJust make sure you have the build-essential and current kernel-headers packages installed.\n", "Q: Where is the reference to the currently used icon theme stored? There are several related questions, but I found none that really answered this detail:\nWhere is the reference to  the current icon theme stored?\nSince the icon theme can be changed, hence so too the path to its folder, it must be stored somewhere. I'm making an application and I want it to draw its own icons from the icon theme currently in use. I've seen answers showing how to retrieve the path using Python and Gtk, but I am using PyQt and would like to avoid importing Gtk as well.\nIs there a configuration file somewhere holding the current icon theme's name or path? Or do you know a PyQt means to do that?\n\nA: A reference to the current icon theme can be found in gconf-editor at:  \ndesktop > gnome > interface > icon_theme\n\nYou can alternatively read directly ~/.gconf/desktop/gnome/interface$ cat %gconf.xml file.\nUnfortunately, this does not provide a path to the relevant icon theme. I'll check how this setting relates to the path and i'll let you know ;-)\n\nA: Have a look at PyXDG (package python-xdg in Ubuntu).  xdg.IconTheme.getIconPath(iconname) gets you the path to the give icon.\n\nA: This looks too easy, so I'm probably missing something here... but what about:\nicon = QIcon.fromTheme(\"firefox\")\n\nQT is supposed to take care of this itself.\n", "Q: Youtube playing audio many times Ubuntu 11.04, Firefox 6.0, Shockwave Flash 10.3 r183.

This doesn't happen on Vimeo, nor does it happen in Google Chrome.  Any ideas?\nEdit: it also happens in Youtube's HTML5 mode.\n\nA: I figured it out.

When the Gnome desktop has focus, hitting F1 brings up \"Ubuntu Desktop Guide\". How do I disable this keyboard shortcut?\nUPDATE: This problem seems to be gone in Ubuntu 12.04 (hitting F1 while the desktop has focus does nothing). I believe the question is specific to Ubuntu 10.04 which I no longer have installed, so I cannot verify the answers.\nI will accept whatever answer is confirmed by the community (post a comment on the answer that works for you) and please mention what Ubuntu version you're using.\n\nA: 14.04\nInstall the DConf editor, go to org > gnome > desktop > wm > keybindings.\nAssign the F1 key to some inoffensive function, like 'raise'.\n\nA: For 12.10\nYou can disable the help browser by opening \"System Settings\" -> \"Keyboard\" and switching to the \"Shortcuts\" tab, then under \"Launchers\" turning \"Launch Help Browser\" to \"Disabled\".\n\nHowever some applications, for example the terminal, have their own help settings you will have to turn off as well.  For the terminal, open the \"Edit\" menu and click on \"Keyboard Shortcuts\".  Scroll to the bottom and change the key for \"Contents\" under \"Help\".  To turn the shortcut off, select it and then hit backspace.\n\n\nA: You can go into Settings->Keyboard->Shortcuts->Starter and press backspace on the coressponding item. Sth. like 'Launch help'\nHowever other applications might still open their help on F1\n\nA: In Ubuntu 20.04\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys help '[]' \n\nit works in my laptop\n\nA: Just to Disable F1 may not be functioning in gnome. \nThe practice way to avoid F1 to bring up Help window is to assign it to some unused function or a common function, such as 'raise'.\nIn most Ubuntu releases, using Settings->Keyboard->Shortcuts to assign F1 to 'raise' should work, except Ubuntu 14.04. \nUnder Ubuntu 14.04, use dconf-editor to reassign F1 to 'raise' described by The Thunder Chimp above.\n\nA: For Linux Mint 20.10\nI'm running gnome. I just opened settings, didn't see anything for F1 so I added one and named it F1, for command just added null and then typed the F1 key.  This seems to have worked to disable F1 default behavior for example in my browser.\n\nA: Yeah, I thought it was basically hard-wired into the system, as I've never found where that was set, but turns out I could just reassign F1 to something else by making a custom keyboard shortcut. Who woulda thunk it?! So I figured rather than let a good key go to waste, I assigned it to open the Pictures folder. Note if you want to do something like that, you can't use a tilde (~) in the path, but have to use the full path, or it will fail.\nI did this in Ubuntu 20.04, in the MATE desktop. Haven't checked if this is set in Gnome and KDE as well (since I'm doing it in MATE's Keyboard Shortcuts), but looks like I'd be able to do this in those DEs too, if needed.\nMany thanks to you guys for your replies in this thread!\n\n", "Q: Top of the window hidden beneath panel In Lucid some irritating pop up windows on chrome come up and are hidden beneath the top panel.

A higher-level tool like apt-get is required to fetch anything from repositories. dkpg is only the core tool that installs/removes/configures packages, taking care of dependencies and other factors. apt-get and aptitude are tools that manage repositories, download data from them, and use dkpg to install/remove packages from them. This means that apt-get and aptitude can resolve dependencies and get required packages from repository, but dpkg cannot, because it knows nothing about repositories.\n\nA: AFAIK, dpkg provides no mechanism for dependency resolving. It checks/warns for dependencies, but does not do any further action. You'll have to solve the problems on your own.  \nAs the Debian wiki states here:\n\ndpkg checks dependencies and will refuse to install a package whose dependencies aren't met, but it won't help you find and install those dependencies. You need a higher-level tool (eg dselect or apt-get) for that.\n\nSo I think that you'll have to use apt-get or aptitude in order to install the package you're interested in, as well as any dependencies involved.\nSince this package is not in the 11.04 repositories, just run:  \nsudo apt-get install libctemplate0 libzip1 libpython2.6 python-pysqlite2 python-paramiko\nsudo dpkg -i mysql-workbench-gpl-5.2.34-1ubu1010-amd64.deb\n\nand you should be ok.\n\nA: You can use apt-get -f install to install all the packages dpkg -i complains about (but looking at your question you probably knew that ;) ).\ngdebi might be a better alternative.\nDescription: Simple tool to install deb files\ngdebi lets you install local deb packages resolving and installing its \ndependencies. apt does the same, but only for remote (http, ftp) located \npackages. \n\nOn a 3rd note... gdebi was replaced by the Ubuntu Software Center. If you install the .deb from within GDM (nautilus) USC will take over and try to install the deb. And that includes the dependencies. That is if you are not bound to command line ;) \n\nA: You can install a package and get dependencies from repositories with\nsudo gdebi package.deb\n\nIf you already installed the package with missed dependencies, you can dowload and install dependencies automatically with\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nAlso available is a graphical version gdebi-gtk, linked to .deb nautilus right click action \"Open With GDebi Package Installer\".\n", "Q: How to convert from from ubuntu desktop 11.04 to ubuntu server 11.04 How to convert from from ubuntu desktop 11.04 to ubuntu server 11.04\nWhat does the below command do?\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-server linux-image-server linux-server\n\n\nA: What's the difference between desktop and server?\n1) The first difference is in the CD contents.

Anyway...\nI've had Ubuntu 11.04 installed on my desktop since it's release. Up until an hour ago, it was working fine. I clicked on an update from the update manager, now booting into a graphical mode is completely broken, (the start-up load hangs at 'Check Battery State ... [0k]'). I restarted my computer, and booted into safe mode, and launched the terminal. This all works fine. I then typed :\nsudo gdm start\n\ninto the command prompt, hoping that I would be able to start things manually. Instead, it spat out this:\ngdm-binary[230]: WARNING: Unable to load file '/etc/gdm/custom.conf'. No such file or directory.\ngdm-binary[230]: WARNING: Unable to find users : no seat-id found.\ngdm-binary[230]: WARNING: Gdm Display: display lasted 0.070467 seconds\n\nThe last line was printed about 8 times, with slightly different times, before it gave up and failed. Some information which might help, I have Gnome 2, Unity and KDE (not sure which version), installed. My graphics card is the GTX 275, and I have driver the Nvidia driver 275.21. So yeah, I think the update has gone and moved custom.conf somewhere, but I have no idea on how to fix it. I have a graphics programming assignment due on Friday and I would be eternally grateful if I could get this fixed well before then. Thanks.\n\nA: Alright, so I managed to solve this issue. The trouble was that I wasn't using the Ubuntu packaged graphics driver, so after a kernel update the kernel was expecting a particular graphics driver, but was actually linked against a newer version. Re-installing the driver seems to have fixed the problem temporarily, but it might re-occur as soon as I do another kernel update.\n", "Q: How supported is a Dell 15z? I am looking to buy a new development machine and would like to run Ubuntu natively. I have been looking at the Dell 15z, but it looks like there are some compatibility problems. However, I also saw a an article that made it look like most everything was working.\nThese may be somewhat out of date, so I was wondering if anyone had any updated information. I would hate to buy the laptop and then have it not work well with Ubuntu. Also, I don't know much about how compatibility changes over time. If it isn't that compatible now, will it likely be more compatible in the future? Will developers likely resolve the compatibility issues, it is just a matter of time? Are we dependent on Dell to release driver fixes for stuff? Thanks!\n\nA: The Ubuntu Forums thread gives you a recent and fairly accurate picture of what the current status is. There appear to be several ongoing issues with this laptop (wireless, optimus grapihcs, trackpad). All are getting viable workarounds but none of them seem to amount to full fixes.\nPeople are going to keep working on the graphics and wireless because they're fairly widely used technologies (on other laptops) so it's probably just a matter of time. I doubt Dell will be helping out because it's not one of their officially supported Ubuntu machines.\nPersonally, I'd just shop for a better laptop because with the hacking around and the (currently) diminished featureset is going to mean you spend a lot of time just getting it working and still won't get what you paid for. A lot of other machines \"just work\".\nYou could also let Dell know you're not going to purchase it unless they support Ubuntu on it. They're not telepathic so even if they ignore your request, if enough people request support, they'll realise they're losing money to other manufacturers.\n", "Q: Live-USB with read-write stick I've got one of the few USB Sticks with hardware read only switch (Trekstor). I'd like to use a bootable Linux with it, e.g. to fix problems with Windows PCs without danger of infecting or changing the stick's contents.\nHowever, for installing updates or new software on it in a safe environment, it should be possible to write to the stick when the switch is on write enabled.\nI'm not sure how switching form one mode to the other is internally done. Any experience with such a kind of drive and how to configure live-USB in this case?\nIf restart is required to change the writing mode, this would be ok.\n\nA: Live USBs are not intended for installing updates and new software. Their main purposes are hardware testing, software evaluation and the system installation. Some persistent storage is offered as an option for saving personal files and settings. You really don't need a USB stick with a hardware switch to run Ubuntu from. As for fixing Windows, I rather doubt Ubuntu is the best tool for the job.\n", "Q: Is Gnome 3 lighter than Gnome 2? As we are going toward Gnome 3, I would like to know what to expect. May be a more responsive desktop, faster startup of apps? Or should I start to thinking in another DE if performance is a concern?   \nI am wondering about a Gnome-3 vs Gnome-2 comparison, not Gnome Shell vs Unity.\n\nA: First problem to do this comparison: how to decrease the influence of User Interface at the results?   \nMy first solution was to use Lubuntu as both 11.04 and 11.10 has the same LXDE environment (see below the Old). But latter I thought what now sounds obvious: how can someone compare Gnome versions not using Gnome? o_O The comparison had to be done otherwise. So it was. ;-)  \nI created a virtual machine with VirtualBox then installed 11.04 and Oneiric Ocelot one alongside the other. After that the guest addons were installed and the systems rebooted.       \nI opened a terminal and type uname -a to see some information:  \n11.04 \n \nOneiric Ocelot \n\nThen I use the command top to see the running processes and memory usage: \n11.04 \n\nOneiric Ocelot \n\nThe graphical monitor:\n11.04 \n \nOneiric Ocelot \n\nAt last I opened in this sequence: Firefox, Libreoffice, Banshee.\n11.04 \n\nOneiric Ocelot \n \nConclusions \nWith top we can see that in both the 4 most resource intensive processes are in this order:  \ncompiz > Xorg > gnome-terminal > top  \nThe System Monitor shows that\n11.04 was using 271.9 MiB of RAM and ~20% of the CPU\nwhile\nOneiric was using 345.1 MiB of RAM and ~20% of the CPU.  \nAfter opening some programs these values come closed:\n11.04 was using 482.6 MiB of RAM and ~20% of the CPU\nwhile\nOneiric was using 481.1 MiB of RAM and ~20% of the CPU. The swap partition has been used with 19.0 MiB  \nI think that maybe Oneiric is preloading some libraries so apps can load faster. This would explain why 11.04 has initially less RAM usage but after opening some programs the RAM usage comes virtually equal. \nSo while some could argue if it is or it isn't fair to compare an alpha to a premium software, these numbers shows just a little change.      \nEnjoy ;-)  \n\nOld\nTrying to eliminate others variables to isolate Gnome-3 vs Gnome-2 comparison I've downloaded Lubuntu 11.04 and Lubuntu 11.10 alpha-3. (Here comes another problem: is it fair to compare an alpha software with a premium software? Later I will come back to this point.)    \nI created a virtual machine with VirtualBox then run both Operating Systems with virtual Live CD.  \nThen I opened a terminal and type uname -a to see some information:  \n11.04 \n\nOneiric Ocelot \n\nThen I use the command top to see the running processes and memory usage: \n11.04 \n\nOneiric Ocelot \n\nThe graphical monitor:\n11.04 \n \nOneiric Ocelot \n\nAt last I opened in this sequence: Chromium, Archive Manager, Abiword, Gnome MPlayer.\n11.04 \n\nOneiric Ocelot \n\nSo we can see that Oneiric with LXDE is using less cpu and less memory even at an alpha version. I'm happily surprised here. But after all things are as they should be: evolving for the better.    \nHopefully this can ease the intuitive belief that Gnome is getting heavier. (Became heavier is the natural evolution of others systems, not here ;-) )  \n\nA: GNOME3 is currently unsupported in Ubuntu 11.04 (at the moment).  And like GNOME, it is not the lightest Desktop Environment.  It will break things :P   If you need a lighter desktop environment, XFCE or LXDE (or whatever the acronym is) are two of the lightest Desktop environments that work at the moment.  In future, GNOME3 may be released as stable, but for now I don't recommend using it (because it doesn't at all increase performance - rather it breaks your system)\nEDIT\nGNOME3 will ship with 11.10, however as I stated, it will not be light.  It'll be relatively heavy on your system.\n\nA: Gnome 3 is heavier, slower, and less-functional.\nBut Ubuntu will use Unity as its default shell.\n", "Q: Can Ubuntu act as a Domain Controller for multiple OSes? I would like to install Ubuntu server at my church to start testing a few options (to eliminate Microsoft usage). Some PCs use Windows XP, and some use Ubuntu.\nI would like the Ubuntu server to be a Domain Controller so that any user account will be able to log on to either a Windows or Ubuntu desktop.\nIs this possible?\nI would also like to be able to manage accounts from the server? (eg. adding, removing, modifying)\n\nA: Depends on what version of Ubuntu you need to use.\nThe Samba version is what really matters.\nTo become a member of Active Directory, you would join the server as described in the documentation for Samba. Then Google how to either become a member server, or clone its data from the ADS, and then reconfigure the smb.conf to be standalone.\nTo do it without Windows Active Directory (or just domains for NT4 servers)\ncreate the server with a wizard if your not sure, or edit a sample smb.conf in the help/documentation to your requirements (also known as standalone server mode).\nIt uses LDAP or NIS for its services. (depending which way you choose to setup)\nZentyal has server software (and was based on Ubuntu, previously known as EBOX)\ncould be worth looking into.\nMaybe if you are stuck for which way, always consult Google first, then the Ubuntu community. This way I can assure you you would save yourself some time, plus you are more likely to be helped more quickly if you did some research first.\nAnyway for client computers and servers (depending on what OSs you're planning to use, here's a list \"based on my personal experience only\"). It comes with no warranty, guarantees, it could be fit for reference of my experience, but not for purpose as things change fast in Linux/Ubuntu/Samba.\nWith that said, here is that list I mentioned.\nNT based Windows versions\n• Windows XP Professional / Media Center editions\n⠀• (works both ways for joining networks, home editions doesn't do server connectivity)\n• Windows 7/Vista\n⠀• (could work both ways, but needs registry changes to use the standalone properly, but can make the OS slightly less secure.)\n• Windows Server 2008 & 2008 R2\n⠀• (join its domain, clone the ADS @where possible@ and then unjoin by reconfiguring it to be standalone, using smb.conf @cannot be used as bdc to samba@\n(well, unless there's been changes since I last checked, but to my knowledge,then no, it cannot.)\n• Windows Server 2003\n⠀• (can do same as Windows Server 2008, but has the ability to join either methods, as it's from same code base as XP)\n• Windows 2000 Servers\n⠀• (the standalone is almost the equivalent of a 2000 Active Directory)\n• Windows 2000 Pro\n⠀• (can join both but I think it would need for newer ADS versions to be in compatible mode @sometimes explained as not secure@ )\n• Windows NT 4.5 Back Office (the upgrade discs, technically not an outright standalone OS)\n⠀• (it doesn't have active directory, but used a service before ADS was born called \"Back Office\", use this reference as the same as NT 4 server)\n• Windows NT 4\n⠀• (standalone method only, nt4 doesn't have ADS as far as i know)\n• Windows nt 4 Server\n⠀• (same as above, but u can join the Ubuntu to a nt4 domain, and set Ubuntu to be the PDC, and the NT4 as BDC if you wanted)\n• Windows NT 3.x (server)\n⠀• (standalone only, I don't know if it can be the PDC to Ubuntu, I think it's BDC to Ubuntu only due to its age)\n• previous versions of Windows NT\n⠀• (I doubt you use them, and would think it's irrelevant)\nNon-NT based Windows versions\n• Windows Milennium Edition\n⠀• (no direct domain connections, but can use logons for profiles and remote shares, but is unsecured as the logons are in the registry as plain text, as far as I know.\n• Windows 98 & 98 SE\n⠀• (same as Milennium Edition)\n• Windows 95\n⠀• (same as Milennium Edition)\n• Windows 3.1.1 for Workgroups\n⠀• (technically not an OS, but can link for shares only, if used with network adaptor add-ons such as Novell Netware, which would require software equivalents for Ubuntu, or Suse software)\n• Windows 3.1\n⠀• (same as Windows 3.1.1)\nPrevious non-NT-based OSs than 3.1 - (highly irrelevant to you I would assume)\n\nA: Ubuntu can be a \"Domain Controller\" for Windows hosts via samba. This certainly works for XP. For newer client OSs, your samba version may have some minor limitation compared to the latest Windows server. You will easily find a tutorial online. If not, ask another question.\nThere are several options how an Ubuntu server can provide features similar to a Windows domain controller for Linux (including Ubuntu) clients. One option is samba if you have this infrastructure set up already. Other options are NIS or LDAP. This part of the setup happens to be more sophisticated since there are numerous options. Again, I recommend you find a tutorial suitable for your use case.\nSamba can work with UNIX system accounts (regular Ubuntu accounts). Technically, the Samba password and the UNIX password are not the same thing. However, in a typically setup, changing one password automatically changes the other one, such that they always match.\nAccount management is always done at the server.\n", "Q: PDF files shown on Chrome have no spaces Why while viewing PDF files on ubuntu on Chrome no spaces are shown? \nIs it my problem or it's same for everyone? \nIf I open that file in Firefox it asks me to download it, but I can't see it without downloading.\nEDIT: maybe anyone knows how to make it automatically download like in Firefox?\n\nA: You can disable Chrome builtin PDF viewer.

Say currently I am using 11.04 32 bit, then come October could I upgrade to 11.10 64 bit? Not a fresh install, or separate install. It is possible? If not what would be the recommended way to go about this?\nThank you for your time and answers\n\nA: I think this is not possible. You would have to reinstall the whole system, because you need to \"change\" all packages in your system from 32-bit binaries to 64-bit binaries.\nWhy do you need a 64-bit system? If you have 4 GB RAM (or more), you can just install PAE kernel (package linux-generic-pae). PAE supports up to 64 GB of RAM.\n\nA: You can't directly upgrade the two. My understanding of that is that the upgrade reuses as many things as possible, and reusing 32 bit components would defeat the purpose. \nThe way I'd do it is to create a backup of your home directory, install Ubuntu 64-bit, then restore the home directory from the backup. Because most, if not all, of your settings are in the home directory, everything should be preserved. You'll then need to reinstall all of your applications, but that should be fairly straightforward. \nFor the backup, turn on hidden files (Ctrl-H), select all of your files (Ctrl-A), and copy them to an external drive. You should unplug the drive before the installation for safety reasons. Once you're done with the install, copy the files back. You'll need to turn on hidden files again if you want your settings to be preserved, since most of them are in hidden directories.\n", "Q: What is the proper way to install a free/libre kernel? What is the proper way to install, for example, the Debian Squeeze libre kernel in Ubuntu Natty?\nIs it safe to do so?\n\nA: *\n\n*Get the source package from Debian\n\n*Check whether Debian or Ubuntu kernel has non-standard patches\n\n*If the kernel version is different, find out whether this affects userland.\n\n*Compare the configuration and adopt if necessary. (You can use the old .config file from Ubuntu when you make *config the new kernel.)\n\n*Compile\n\n*Make binary package through make-kpkg\n\n*Repeat for any relevant module\n\n*Install binary packages\n\n\nHowever, according to the COPYRIGHT file natty's default kernel is free (licensed GPL): http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/main/l/linux/linux_2.6.38-11.48/copyright\nHence, removing all non-free packages should also meet your goal.\n", "Q: Do I need to reboot my computer to read data from two SD cards? I stuck an SD card in the card reader, imported my photos with Shotwell, deleted the photos from the card (again, with Shotwell), then right-clicked on the desktop icon and safely removed the card.\nI then physically removed the card and inserted another. The computer is ignoring it. How can I tell Ubuntu that there's a new card in there now and I want to look at it? I know that rebooting the computer will work, and I'll do that this time, but there must be a better way for next time.\n\nA: There is a similar report on launchpad.\nFor those affected, the suggestion in the report is not to use \"Safely Extract Drive\" (Natty) or \"Safely Remove\" (Precise) (as shown in the picture below) but to unmount the drive from the command line. \n\nThe issue is that where a USB memory stick is unmounted before removal (i.e. use Safely Extract Drive), SD cards use-case are apparently treated differently - the use case is that SDxx memory cards are expected to be ejected, leaving the card reader mounted and ready to read the next card inserted.  \nThe workaround for is to use the terminal:\nUse mount -l to list your mounts - your SD card will be reported like the following extract: \n/dev/sdb1 on /media/7804-99AA type vfat (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=udisks,uid=1000,gid=1000,shortname=mixed,dmask=0077,utf8=1,showexec,flush)\n\nunmount using the device name shown\numount /dev/sdb1\n\nNote - if this affects you, subscribe to the launchpad report.  During testing with 12.04 I'm perhaps fortunate to be unaffected, but there is a comment in the thread that a user using 12.04 was also affected.\n\nLinked Question:\n - What is the difference between Eject and Safely Remove Device\n\nA: Unfortunately it seems that at the very moment when you choose the \"Safely remove\" option, what is \"safely removed\" is the device itself. I am not sure if this is a common behavior for this items, but having in mind that at the time when we \"safely remove\" a USB drive from the slot, what we are removing is the physical item.\nMay be we need a revision on that but meanwhile you can give a try to \"eject\" instead of \"Safely remove\", which is doing the trick for me. I am using this:\n\nBus 003 Device 002: ID 1019:0c55 Elitegroup Computer Systems (ECS)\n  Flash Reader, Desknote UCR-61S2B\n\nAnd I experience the same when \"Safely remove\" the device (instead of the SD card). Behavior that is not observed when ejecting.\nI should warn you that you must be careful when you \"eject\" your device, you may lose some data if the file transfer has not finished yet. But this can happen even if you \"Safely remove\" or unplug the memory card and the file transfer hasn't finished yet.\nKeep me informed on your issue, I will appreciate a lot your feedback.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: tar: Backing up an encrypted /home folder?

At home however I do not have a static ip.\nMy solution (semi-working)\nSo I figured I register with dyndns and add a rule to /etc/iptables for that dynalias myUser.dynalias.net:\n# in /etc/iptables\n\n*filter\n:INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]\n:FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]\n:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]\n:RH-Firewall-1-INPUT - [0:0]\n-A INPUT -j RH-Firewall-1-INPUT\n-A FORWARD -j RH-Firewall-1-INPUT\n\n-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT\n# namesevers\n-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p 50 -d some.local.ip -j ACCEPT\n-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p 51 -d the.same.local.ip -j ACCEPT\n    # ...and so on...\n# all connections already established (started outgoing from my machine)\n-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\n# allow local connections\n-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 --source some.local.ip/255.255.0.0 -j ACCEPT\n# allow my dns\n-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 --source myuser.dynalias.net -j ACCEPT\n# block all others (without answering - thus nobody is able to scan the network)\n-A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP\n-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -j DROP\nCOMMIT\n\nWhat's not working with this solution\nThat works until my home ip is reset each day at midnight. So on weekends I'm basically screwed and can not login. My guess is, that I have to update the rule on a regular basis (e.g. using cron). My question is: How do I update the rule on regular basis? For some reason, when I update the table on a running system using:\nThe update commands (not working):\nsudo iptables -D RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 --source ip.that's.listed.by.-L.option -j ACCEP\nsudo iptables -A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 --source myUser.dynalias.net -j ACCEP\n\nI can not ssh into my work pc after that update. The only thing that helps is calling someone to reboot my work pc. Somehow the changes will not take effect without that reboot despite the rule being listed correctly:\nusername@server:~/bin$ sudo iptables -L\nChain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \nRH-Firewall-1-INPUT  all  --  anywhere             anywhere            \nDROP       icmp --  anywhere             anywhere            icmp echo-request \n\nChain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \nRH-Firewall-1-INPUT  all  --  anywhere             anywhere            \n\nChain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination  \n\nChain RH-Firewall-1-INPUT (2 references)\n# some stuff (e.g. nameserver)\n# ....\nDROP       all  --  anywhere             anywhere    \nACCEPT     tcp  --  123-123-12-123.host.name.foo.bar.at  anywhere            state NEW tcp dpt:ssh \n\nIn this listing there is no difference before and after update at all - it just doesn't work to ssh into the work pc.\n\nA: Some times ago, I was faced to the same problem, and my solution was to create a template iptables files of rules, to modify on the basis of the current dyndns retrieved IP, then setup the tables with iptable-restore. The routine tested the IP periodically and updated the firewall when required.\nI abandoned such approach when a collegue asked to use the same ssh server, and setting up the system for two IPs, though not particularly difficult, make me change my mind.\nI would suggest some other way to approach the problem.\nA commonly used approach is to use software to detect and block attacks. For example fail2ban can analyze ssh logs at runtime and ban/unban suspicious hosts using firewall rules. \nOn the other part, denyhosts add suspicious hosts to /etc/hosts.deny, achieving the same target of fail2ban.\nYet another option is to use a third party public ssh server (see shellium, blinkensheel, etc.) as a bridge to reach your personal ssh server, in which you should trust the public server and no others, and which as a static IP. \nI'm sure experts out there can suggest yet other solution better than what I suggest.\n", "Q: Launch application via ssh I am new to SSH. I can connect to a remote computer.\nI can also launch an application on a remote computer and see its GUI on my screen.\nBut I do not know how to launch an application without it producing output on my screen.  \nI want to launch an application (eg. rhythmbox), and close the ssh connection, leaving the application running, without sending any output to my screen.\nSurfing the web I have found some advice, but nothing helped me;\nssh -X name@domain\nnohup rhythmbox &\nlogout\n\n\nA: Do you mean you want Rhythmbox to display onto the remote computer's screen? The screen onto which a GUI application is displayed is indicated by the DISPLAY environment variable. When you run ssh -X, DISPLAY is set to a value that indicates that display requests must be forwarded over the SSH connection. To make the application display on the remote computer's screen, set DISPLAY to the value :0.\nssh username@example.com 'DISPLAY=:0 rhythmbox &'\n\nThere's one more hurdle: when an application connects to an X display, it needs to provide a sort of password called a cookie. The cookie is generated each time the X server starts. Ubuntu stores the cookie in a file with a randomly generated name. The easiest way to find the cookie is to store it in a well-known file name when the X server starts. On Ubuntu, add this code to your ~/.profile:\ncase $DISPLAY:$XAUTHORITY in\n  :*:?*)\n    # DISPLAY is set and points to a local display, and XAUTHORITY is\n    # set, so merge the contents of `$XAUTHORITY` into ~/.Xauthority.\n    XAUTHORITY=~/.Xauthority xauth merge \"$XAUTHORITY\";;\nesac\n\nFor more background, see ssh DISPLAY variable.\n\nOr did you mean you never ever want to see the Rhythmbox window? If so, make it connect to a virtual X server, xvfb . Start the virtual X server, then tell Rhythmbox to connect to it.\nssh username@example.com 'Xvfb :1 -screen 0 800x600x8 & sleep 1; DISPLAY=:1 rhythmbox &'\n\n", "Q: How can I rewrite lines in a txt file using grep [sed]?

There is a gedit plugin called Modelines and the plugin is described as\n\nEmacs, Kate and Vim-style modelines support for gedit.\n\nWhat are modelines? And how do they work in gedit?\n\nA: Gedit modelines are described here.\nIn text file (in source code comments for example) you can add some configuration customization hints for the editor (like display tab as 4 spaces in this this file).\n\nA: Modelines allow you to set preferences on a file-by-file basis, and allow you to mimic some of the preference-setting options of a few other popular editors (Vim, Emacs, and Kate).\nFor example, if you have your gedit preferences set to use 4 spaces per indentation, you can use modelines to override this and set only 2 spaces per indentation on that particular file.\nActually creating modelines in your documents is another matter, though. It can be rather complex (look at the documentation for the Kate modelines), and is generally suited to people who are intimately familiar with their editors of choice. This is why the gedit documentation links out to the various manuals for Vim, Emacs, and Kate, rather than describing their modelines in detail within the documentation.\nHere is a sample vim-style modeline in a python file. Let's call it test.py. The line at the end turns on the modelines, sets the tab spaces at 24 spaces (clearly a bad python coding practice, but done just for effect here), and turns off the expanded tabs feature.\nprint \"hello\"\nprint \"say what?\"\n\n# ex:set ts=24 noet:\n\nGive it a try in gedit and let me know if it works for you. The vim modeline options are documented fairly well here. If you would like to wade through the Emacs documentation to find their modeline options, you are welcome to do so.  :)\n", "Q: why doesnt notepad++ in Wine display the filenames properly?

The only thing that really bugs me is how Banshee doesn't have a dark toolbar, yet Rhythmbox does. Imo it really integrates it much better..\nRhythmbox:\n\nBanshee:\n\nI know the stable release is quite a ways away, but I'm just curious as to why this is the case. \n\nA: Banshee's toolbar looks different because its toolbar color is hard-coded.  This was initially coded in the days when it wasn't popular for gtk themes to set custom colors for the toolbar.  It was done to help the resize grip widgets (and possible other custom icons and widgets) blend in better with the toolbar.\nUnfortunately, the custom toolbar makes Banshee stick out like a sore thumb with themes that do paint the toolbar.  There's an open bug report (mine, actually ;) ) for the issue.\nPart of the problem can probably be found near line 214 of BaseClientWindow.cs.  I tried my limited C# abilities and couldn't come up with a fix.  If you can, I'm sure the Banshee devs would welcome a patch. :)\n\nA: This is not on official answer, but some creative guesswork on my part: Banshee uses Mono, which has always had issues integrating 100% with the GTK theme. Therefore, to get to to look right in the GTK2 days, it required an rc file (which is like a theme for one program). As yet in 11.10, I haven't seen any rc files that would be used to fix little issues in theme compatibility. This is why Banshee looks out of place.\nIf you want to see another instance of rc issues, look at the Ubuntu One control panel. In Natty it has a different tab switcher because of custom rc file. In Oneiric, this doesn't exist.\nNow, as for why those RC files don't exist, I cannot say. GTK3/the unico engine may not support it yet or it may not be possible, or it may just be waiting in the pipes.\nRecap: Rhythmbox native GTK app, will look right. Banshee is a Mono app, will never look 100% correct without some work.\nEDIT: Please read MichaelMS's comments on this answer, he clarifies some of the misconceptions in this answer. (Mainly that Banshee COULD look 100% right, but is coded in a way that it doesn't.)\n", "Q: How can I restore a corrupted Shotwell db?

I am setting up a LAMP server, and am looking at using a spare 32bit box I have.\n\nA: from my experience since I did the same question you are doing I have the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Both will be the same if what you want is stability. I mean like really REALLY the same. 4 Months of using Ubuntu 11.04 in both 32 and 64 as a server and 8 more using 10.10 as 32 and 64 as server can prove it. \n\n*Both will get updates for more security and stability.\n\n*Lamp works excellent in both. Easy to install in both (same way actually) and no problems whatsoever with 0% reboots.\n\n*Remember that 32 has the 4GB limit which can be jumped by using PAE but come one, if you can use 64bit, you can use more than 4GB easily.\n\n*If you have 32bit hardware with no 64bit compatibility then I recommend 32bit since you will loose a lot of the benefits of using 64bit software on 64bit hardware.\n\n*Both will offer the SAME SPEED. But here is the catch. On 64bit, there are several cases where USING the 64 capabilities will come in handy. For example compiling something will be done faster (Of course using multiple CPUs will also accomplish this). For my experience, for the normal LAMP usage, I have not seen a speed difference. not in MySQL, not in apache, cpu usage, memory usage. The difference is there but is so small is not worth mentioning.\nBasically, in your case, use the 32Bit Server and enjoy a very good server indeed.\n\nA: no difference in stability. it theoretically won't have access to as much memory (but running it on 32 bit hardware means you don't have that much anyway) and slightly slower for programs optimised for 64 bit architectures, but a lamp stack will run fine.\ni only just changed over to a 64 bit server for my lamp machine a couple of months ago. no real difference other than future expansion\n", "Q: After computer upgrade streaming media is choppy I just upgraded my computer to: \nAMD x4 955, \nMobo: MSI 970a-G45 AM#3+ socket,\nGPU: XFX ATI 6870.  \nAfter I upgraded I reinstalled 11.04.

For example google-chrome (I know they finally made a repo), virtualbox, and unstable WINE. I'm actually using debian testing (wheezy) now, and I particularly miss wine and emerald. I've had a lot of experience doing things the hard way then finding out about some really elegant trick that solves all problems. I'm wondering if there is one for this.

I'm considering eventually writing a shell/perl script that checks each package's website for updates and downloads it...\n\nA: The answer is, APT repositories are the elegant solution. If a distributor does not have an APT repository, yes, you will need to script fetching each package and generate the packages.gz file for the local directory repository. The biggest issue is fetching the package - since there's no repo, there's no standard and scripting will be very specific for each package.\n", "Q: Sound stop working I have a little problem, I touched something related to alsa on the software center, becuase there was a corrupted package that I tried to install (alsa-conexant... or something like this)\nAfter removing it, the sound stop working, now at the taskbar it does not show the sound notification.\nI can acess sound config, via \"Sound\" in Applications, but when I try to choose a Hardware, the list is in blank, there are no devices. \n\nA: You may have removed a package or two too many.

Despite the error I get I think that the system boots okay because I can use the system but this error is very annoying. \n\nA: The message says some errors were found on the filesystem which fsck is afraid to fix automatically, so you need to do it manually. To do this, press M when it prompts you - this will drop you into a emergency root console. From there you'll be able to run\nfsck /dev/sda1\n\nwhere /dev/sda1 is the name of your /boot partition. You can see the list of partitions by doing fdisk -l.\nAlternatively, you can try fsck -A to check all partitions but I suppose it'll only work if the root partition is already mounted so fsck can access /etc/fstab.\nIt'll probably ask you a few questions - I usually just agree with what it proposes. Also, there's 'a' option which will fix things automatically but the man file suggests to use it with caution. So, ultimately, fsck -Aa should fix all errors on all partitions without asking any questions.\nAfter you're finished, exit the shell with Ctrl-D and the machine will reboot.\n\nA: I had a similar problem except I had created a RAID volume formatted with XFS.  Every time the OS booted I would get the Serious errors were found... message.

Each book has been placed in its own zip file, and each zip file has been given its own folder. My problem is that I do not want to have to go through each file and unzip them and put the ebooks in one place manually. If I can get the zip files in one place, it will be an easy job to unpack all of them with one command. \nSo, how do I get my files into one folder, instead of in their own subfolders?\n\nA: Assuming that all the directories that contain the zip files have a common parent, you could use find to find all of the zip files then execute unzip on those files specifying the directory to extract the files to:\nfind /path/under/zip/folders -name \"*.zip\" -exec unzip {} -d /target/path \\;\n\n\nA: The wildcards approach can quickly get messy if there is more than a single level of nested folders...\nI usually perform similar tasks (and most of other file operations) using Midnight Commander.

Now you can select all your zips by pressing * and copy/move them to the directory in another pane by hitting F5 or F6\n\nA: Do you have experience using wildcards? you could do something like\nmv common_part_of_folder_name*/*.zip .\n\nwhere the asterisk symbol basically means \"anything\".

You have everything you need. :)\n\nA: My personal preference is filezilla.\nYou can install it from the repositories by typing sudo apt-get install filezilla.\nIt's quite stable and with plenty of features.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to download by using a shell FTP client (no GUI), you could try to use wget or ncftp.\nSome examples:  \nncftpget –R –v –u \"username\" <ftp_site> <local_dir> <remote_dir>, (where \"R\" = recursive, \"v\" = verbose)\nwget -r ftp://username:password@<ftp_site>/\nwget provides many options, i've used it many times myself and i think that you should really try it (read it's 'man page', it's worth it)\n\nA: A few command line solutions from this thread on SO:\nwget -l 100 --user=<user> --password=<password> ftp://server/which/folder\n\nThe -l 100 is for setting depth to 100, as -r sets it to 5.\nOr:\nwget -r ftp://user:pass@server.com/\n\nMight not always work, as per SO, so try -m instead.\nOr use ncftp as below:\nncftp -u <user> -p <pass> <server>\nncftp> mget directory\n\nAlternatively use sftp:\nscp -r user@server:/which/folder /destination/folder/\n\nThis one is highly recommended over plain FTP.\n\nA: Any FTP client is able to download directories recursively and also authenticate with a username and password. Just start Ubuntu Software Center, search for \"ftp\" and choose one of the options.\nFilezilla looks like a good candidate to install and see if it works for you (though I never used it).\nOr do you mean you want to download files in some unusual way (in a terminal, from a shell script, etc.)?\n", "Q: My kernel won't boot. What steps should I take? I installed versions 2.6.38~10 and 2.6.38~11 of the Linux kernel via apt-get and unfortunately neither one boots at all. As soon as I select the kernel in GRUB, the kernel panics and the CAPS LOCK key flashes. The latest version of the kernel that I have that boots is 2.6.38~8.\nI have tried editing the boot parameters by removing quiet and splash but that does absolutely nothing.\nWhat options do I have for debugging the kernel and finding out what is malfunctioning?\n\nA: I had something similar to your case. Try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot 2.6.38~11 with recovery mode.\n\n*From the recovery menu, choose \"drop to shell with i-net access\"  (or something similar)\n\n*type in the terminal: telinit 3 to switch to runlevel 3\n\n*Enter your username, Enter password\n\n*Type: sudo service gdm stop to close the x server.\n\n*Type: sudo nvidia-installer -f --update ; this will download the latest driver and reinstall it.\n\n*That's it, type sudo service gdm start and you have your desktop back.\n\n\nAt point 6 you don't really need to reinstall the driver. All you need is to build the module for your current kernel version, but i couldn't figured it out how to do it.\n\nA: you need to re-run the NVidia .run file so that the new kernel modules will be built\nthe easiest way to do this would be to modify your boot parameters in grub\n\n\n*\n\n*when grub opens with a list of choices, press 'e' to edit the option\n\n*select the second line(the one that starts with kernel) and press 'e' again to edit that\n\n*goto the end of the line and add a space and a 3\n\n*now press ENTER to save (i think just check the help at the bottom of the screen) and 'b' to boot\n\n\nyou should now be booted into a normal terminal on runlevel 3 so no graphics drivers are needed\ncd to the directory where you've downloaded the NVidia .run fiel and run it again as root, remember to have it rerun nvidia-cconfig for you\nif you reboot after that all should be well\nthis is unfortunately something you'll have to do every time you update your kernel\n\nA: Remove the quiet and splash params, read the error messages that come up when booting fails. \nTry the single or recovery boot option. I expect it fails during the loading of the kernel. If so then  boot up into using a live disk mount your root partition. Search the contents of your [root-parition]/var/log/ directory. The kern.log, lastlog, boot.log, messages, debug, faillog and syslog could help. Paste them as part of your question to get more help. \nYour error messages are added to the end of the log files. So it will usually be the last messages into the log file that you need to look at. But some times it will dump memory and such with is not as useful. So I would include the most obvious looking error messages or the last 50 lines to be safe. \n", "Q: How do I install glib?

How can I control a NTFS partition at all?\n\nA: You can mount the NTFS partition with read-write permissions for root only\nsudo mount -o fmask=0177,dmask=0077 /dev/sdaX /media/root-view\n\nwhere /dev/sdaX is the NTFS partition device, and /media/root-view is a mountpoint, to be created if necessary (obviously, you can choose the name you like).\nThen install bindfs allowing to mount a directory on a mountpoint with modified permissions. The bind mount would be established as follow\nsudo bindfs -p ugo=rwX /media/root-view/shared /media/user-view\n\nwhere shared is a directory you want to share, and /media/user-view is another mountpoint, to be created if needed, as above.\nNow all users have read-write access to /media/user-view, representing the /shared folder on the NTFS partition, and no access to other directories on the same partition.\nYou can repeat the bindfs for all directories of your interest, but would be better to reorganize the content of the NTFS partition, putting all directories to share inside a single directory. I mean, change the layout from\n/shared01\n/shared02\n...\n/shared10\n/unshared01\n/unshared02\n...\n/unshared10\n\nto\n/shared\n    /shared01\n    /shared02\n    ...\n    /shared10\n/unshared\n    /unshared01\n    /unshared02\n    ...\n    /unshared10\n\nWith this layout you only need to share the directory /shared, giving automatic access to all sub-directories.\n", "Q: standard partitioning scheme for ubuntu home user \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat's your recommendation on drive partitioning schemes for a desktop and home server? \n\nThis thread is a continuation of my failed attempt to install ubuntu on a new pc.

The permission scheme set up on Linux systems has been very well thought out, and it goes deep into the system. You can really do a lot of damage to your system very easily, and the point of having you enter a password is to make sure you want change your system in some way.\nAnother possibility is that some malicious piece of software tries to damage your system. This has been a huge problem on Windows systems for years. On Linux, it's very difficult to do something like this because all major changes to your system need to be authenticated.\nIn the end, how often do you need to enter your password? Installing software should only happen once, and then it's set up. You'll need it to make changes to the system, but again, you're probably not going to do this very often and it's easy to make a typo and break your system.\nIn the end, it's up to you, but I urge you to consider how inconvenient entering a password is, and how much you gain from having that extra layer of security.\n", "Q: How do I install the Intel HD 3000 video driver? how do I install a new video driver? \nI need to install the Intel HD 3000 video driver in my PC which is running Ubuntu 10.04.\n\nA: Sandy Bridge Graphics such as the HD3000 will need an upgrade of the Mesa support beyond what is available for Lucid.\nOne of the best PPAs with a mesa version that has backports for Sandy Bridge support is from Stefan Glasenhardt.\nI would NOT install the install the x-org edgers PPA which is often quoted.  x-org edgers - as the developers themselves say - is very unstable and can cause major graphics issues since updates are frequent and often sparingly tested.\nSince you are using a modern laptop, you will also require the more up-to date Kernel - 2.6.38 which is available from Synaptic Manager.\nHow to install:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:glasen/intel-driver\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-generic-lts-backport-natty linux-headers-generic-lts-backport-natty\n\nNote\nWorking with the OP - this solution only works for 32bit Ubuntu.  64bit Ubuntu with this solution will leave you with a frozen/messed up graphics and as such should be avoided.\n\nA: Your best solution is probably to upgrade to 10.10 and then 11.04. That has the newer drivers available already.\nAlternatively there are drivers for 10.04 available, with some risk of instability:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAs documented on Ubuntu's own forums.\n\nA: 10.04 is way too old to get them working, you have to upgrade to 11.04.\nBut even with that, the Intel 3000 drivers on a Macbook Air (4,1/4,2) will not work properly because of bugs in the linux kernel. See http://keithp.com/blogs/MacBook-Air-2 for an explanation of this. The result is that you'll need Linux Kernel version 3.2 to get them fully working.\n\nA: after you did what 'fossfreedom' posted just change the following line in '/etc/default/grub'\n GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quite splash\"\n\nto\n GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quite splash i965.modeset=1\"\n\nalso you might see >>this Post<<\n\nA: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quite splash i965.modeset=0 is workable in sandy bridge. Also be careful while updating the system. Only use below command:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:glasen/intel-driver\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-generic-lts-backport-natty linux-headers-generic-lts-backport-natty\n\nInstall lucid-1.04 and use above code.\nThanks guys, after a long time, good post.

I have seen it before. I am just wondering what exactly does it do? \n\nA: From man apt-get: \n   -f, --fix-broken\n       Fix; attempt to correct a system with broken dependencies in place. This\n       option, when used with install/remove, can omit any packages to permit APT\n       to deduce a likely solution. If packages are specified, these have to\n       completely correct the problem. The option is sometimes necessary when\n       running APT for the first time; APT itself does not allow broken package\n       dependencies to exist on a system. It is possible that a system's dependency\n       structure can be so corrupt as to require manual intervention (which usually\n       means using dselect(1) or dpkg --remove to eliminate some of the offending\n       packages). Use of this option together with -m may produce an error in some\n       situations. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Fix-Broken.\n\n\nA: Here's where I found it very useful. I ran a dpkg command to install a couple of .deb packages, but the install failed because some dependencies were missing.\nI then ran \napt-get -f install\n\nand it installed exactly the dependencies that were needed. I was then able to re-run my dpkg command and everything worked.\n", "Q: How can I permanently change the text size for gnome-terminal?

Again, this can be done in 2 different ways:\n\n1.1.

Configure your router to directly connect to dyndns.org and update the IP address everytime\nit changes.\nYour model (WRT54G) supports DDNS so it's quite easy. You can find more info here\n\n\n*Forward all incoming requests (i.e. from the Internet) to your Ubuntu webserver.\nThat is, configure once again your router to accept all incoming requests from the Internet for port 80 and forward them to port 80 of your Ubuntu machine.\nAgain, more information about port-forwarding can be found here\n", "Q: How do I fix very slow/choppy experience with an ATI Radeon HD 5850 xtreme?

For the installation on my laptop, where i have only one HDD with Win 7, the installer automatically detected my 64 GB free space and installed Ubuntu to this space and GRUB was properly setup for dualboot. (The first page of the installer already offered me the option to do so.) Now i want to install Ubuntu on my desktop PC where i have a slightly different setup: on my first HDD i have 320 GB where i have Win 7 installed. My second HDD (not partition!) of about 1 TB is split up into 896 GB for use in Windows (not another instance of Win 7!) and 128 GB free space where i want to install Ubuntu.\nWill Ubiquity recognize Win 7 on my other HDD and install GRUB without problems, as i do not want to reinstall Windows ;)\n\nA: Yes, I've done nearly this exact setup and the installer recognized Windows 7 on the other drive and installed the GRUB bootloader appropriately.\nNote that it might recognize Windows 7 as Windows Vista since they have the same (or similar) loaders.\n", "Q: LibreOffice Keeps crashing when I start it up?

The new and preferred way to stop start and restart services is through /etc/init.d. So, for example, to stop or start the Apache Webserver, you can run\n/etc/init.d/apache2 stop\n/etc/init.d/apache2 start\nThe same is true of many other services, but probably not all. You can use the utility sysv-rc-conf to see which services you have that use an init.d script and manage them that way as well. Run it with sudo sysv-rc-conf.\nIf you're looking for a GUI application, try Boot up Manager. Install with\napt-get install bum\nand run from the UI or from a terminal with\nsudo bum\nUsage and documentation can be found here.\n", "Q: Gwibber 3.1.5 almost unuseable After a recent update my Gwibber installation is almost totally useless.  I'm wondering what the process is to totally uninstall my system of Gwibber and all its' files and start over with a completely new installation.  The version I'm having problems with is 3.1.5 and would like to downgrade to the last stable version.  Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Assuming you have installed the gwibber-daily ppa from launchpad you would copy and paste the following into a terminal:\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:gwibber-daily/ppa\n\nThis will revert you back to the default v3 natty install of Gwibber.\n\nA: As fossfreedom pointed out, you need to purge the PPA. You can avoid doing that if you know how to downgrade packages using Synaptic, or if you want to reinstall gwibber.\nTo do the reinstall method (which will potentially remove a few other packages that you can easily reinstall), open synaptic, disable the Gwibber-daily ppa (I'm guessing you used that one), reload your sources, remove all gwibber-*, *gwibber and gwibber* packages, and install gwibber and the related packages again.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can PPAs be removed?\n", "Q: Remove ubuntu one from messaging indicator I have been trying to find a way to remove the Ubuntu One entry from the indicators' panel.\nI have removed the ubuntuone file from /usr/share/indicators/applications\nand edited it out of the seendb.keyfile in ~/cache/indicators/messages/\nbut it keeps returning.\nI just want it gone, as I do not need it at all.\nHow can I do it? I have Ubuntu Natty amd64.\n\nA: User a terminal and make the directory\nmkdir -p ~/.config/indicators/messages/applications-blacklist/\nFiles in here should be paths to .desktop files which will be blacklsited on startup. The .desktop files in question are located in\n/usr/share/indicators/messages/applications\nso you can make symlinks from there to this directory. Thus\nln -s /usr/share/indicators/messages/applications/menuItem ~/.config/indicators/messages/applications-blacklist/menuItem\nwill remove menuItem from the messaging menu. Run\nls /usr/share/indicators/messages/applications\nto see what the names of the .desktop files are and look for the one mentioning Ubuntu One.\nYou can run\nkillall gnome-panel\nto see the changes immediately. Else, a logout should work as well.\n\nA: If instead of blacklisting the menu item you completely want to get rid of Ubuntu One, remove the following packages:\nsudo apt-get purge ubuntuone-client python-ubuntuone-client python-ubuntuone-storageprotocol\n\nAfter logging out and in again, Ubuntu One (and the menu item) should be gone.\n\nA: Now that Ubuntu One is dying, I wanted to remove the Ubuntu One indicator. I realized that the above methods either hide the indicator or remove the application, not the indicator itself.\nSo to remove the Ubuntu One indicator from the top menu bar:\n\nsudo apt-get remove indicator-ubuntuone\n\n", "Q: How can I preview HTML documents from the command line? I use catdoc to preview Word documents from the command line. Is there something similar for HTML?\nIn other words I would like to do cathtml Webpage.html | less and get more or less a man page look output.\n\nA: There are these so-called text html browsers, of which I have successfully tested Lynks and eLinks. Of which elinks has became my favorite.\nAnyway, they are different than a \"web page previewers\" as you suggest in your question. They are more like active real time browsers, which carries on lots of useful features for an easy web browsing and of course, you can also use it for local/remote web pages preview.\nInformation about Lynks is in the wikipedia and can be reached clicking here. The information related to the elinks is here.\nMy elinks screenshot for you to see elinks in action:\n\n\nA: One solution is to use lynx -dump, as in\nlynx -dump file.html\n\nor\necho \"<div>this is a div</div>\" | lynx -dump -stdin\n\n\nBetter:\nUse w3m -dump, it respects the page layout. It is awesome.\nsudo aptitude install w3m\nw3m -dump file.html\necho \"<div>x</div>\" | w3m -dump -T text/html\n\nYou can set the number of columns of the terminal for getting the better layout, for example, if you are using a full-window terminal, 200 can be a good try:\nw3m -dump -cols 200 file.html\n\n\nA: You can use html2text to look into an HTML document from command line. \nsudo apt-get install html2text\nhtml2text Webpage.html | less\n\nbut not exactly a look similar to man pages, it depends on the html input, of course.\n\nA: You could use w3m which should already installed - if however it isn't \nsudo apt-get install w3m\n\nAn example command syntax:\nw3m -dump askubuntu.com | less\n\nIt can be used with both URL's as well as file-based html files\nw3m -dump index.html | less\n\n\n\nA: You can combine a use of html2text and mdless.\nhtml2text Webpage.html | mdless\n\nAlternativly plus curl to download the file first\ncurl https://askubuntu.com | html2text | mdless\n\nThe curl does download the file in the stdin of html2text. This gives mdless the markdown which will be shown like a pager.\nIt is not the same as the man pages. And you can't click on links like on real browser, for that use w3m or elinks\n", "Q: How to run testsuite for GCC? I'm a newbie in Linux. I have installed Ubuntu 11.04 (64 bit). \nI want to install gfortran (GCC). They sugest to run testsuites first. Then I installed Dejagnu. I have found some instructions here\nI followed them.

Just go to the software center, search for gfortran and install it (or click on the little package icon in the previous sentence).\nSame goes for dejagnu  -- if you really need it you do not have to compile and install it yourself, just use Ubuntu's package manager.\nYou can find a lot of information on installing software for Ubuntu here on the help wiki\n", "Q: Rollback Xubuntu-desktop install: Change GDM Theme I recently installed xubuntu-desktop but much to my dismay, lots of applications came with it that I didn't want. \nI apt-get removed xubuntu-desktop but it turns out I had to go through each programme and remove it manually anyway, now that I have done that, I have a proper desktop apart from the login screen still shows the Xubuntu theme. \nHow can I change it to its original Ubuntu default theme? \nIs there a way that avoids installing Ubuntu Tweak?\n\nA: It seems an age now, but you could use gksudo gdmsetup to customise your GDM login screen.  This seems to have been dropped after Karmic.\nIf you want to re-theme your GDM, add gnome-appearance-properties to GDM's autostart folder:\nsudo ln -s /usr/share/applications/gnome-appearance-properties.desktop /usr/share/gdm/autostart/LoginWindow\n\nLog out. \nThe appearance properties window will appear on the GDM login screen.\nConfigure GDM how you want, then close the window and log back in.\nWhen you're done and want the window to stop opening with GDM, run:\nsudo unlink /usr/share/gdm/autostart/LoginWindow/gnome-appearance-properties.desktop\n\nUse this AU question and answer to reset the xubuntu gdm icon back to the canonical orange circle-of-friends.\n\nA: Reinstall the gdm package.

The system requirements for these OSes are much lower than 10.7GB.  \n\nA: The minimal size is only recommendation -- if you want you can change it.\nIn LiveCD environment (before running installation) open terminal and run\ngksudo leafpad /usr/lib/ubiquity/plugins/ubi-prepare.py\nat line 303, there's variable size and at line 310 you'll find this\nmin_disk_size = size * 2\njust change the number 2 for adjustment (now the minimal size is 5 GB * 2, I've replaced it with 0.8), save the file and run Installator again.\n\n\nA: Believe you are seeing a glitch in the installer, as they usually require 4.0GB.

Unfortunately I accidentally clicked on one of the pre-set options and did not get a chance to manually specify the size of my root partition and swap space. I had 350GB of unallocated space and ubuntu made the entire 350GB the root drive (.ext4). Seeing as using fdisk or resize2fs inside ubuntu would be bad as this is the root drive, would it be ok if I used a windows based partitioning program to resize the root partition? I want to shrink the root partition down to 100GB and have the remaining 250GB as a NTFS parition that I can use in windows and mount on ubuntu. \nI know this is a lot of text but thanks for reading!\n\nA: You can resize the partition after booting from the Ubuntu live CD (or USB stick - in other words, the same medium you installed it from).\nUsing a windows-based partitioning program would most likely destroy all data on the linux partition (unless you're talking about some specific program which is explicitly aware of ext4 and knows how to resize it)\n", "Q: how to increase the screen resolution? I installed Ubuntu in my Lenovo ThinkPad X60. Currently the screen resolution is set to 1024x768, which is the maximum resolution in the settings. Is it the hardware maximum resolution?\nCompared to what has been in Windows XP, everything looks so big. How can I make them all small?\n\nA: Maximum resolution for ThinkPad X60 is 1024x768, so you can't increase it.\nYou can change size of the text, that could help.\nRun \"Appearance\" (if you have classic desktop, then from menu System → Preferences → Appearance, if you have Unity then run ** Dash** (Ubuntu button in top left corner) and search for \"Appearance\"). Navigate to Fonts where you can set size of all system fonts (or click on Details... to set DPI for whole system).\n\nA: While it's correct that you cannot get more than 1024x768 on the laptop's screen, it really has to be mentioned that you can get a much higher resolution if you connect to an external monitor simply using a VGA cable. \nE.g. I am on 1920x1080 right now on an X60; To further back this up, check the specs for the GMA950 graphics chipset that X60 comes with http://www.intel.com/products/chipsets/gma950/ and you'll see it can go all the way up to 2048x1536 @75Hz.\nOther than the above, if you happen to have a monitor with a non-VGA reception, you can always get a VGA to DVI/HDMI convertor to connect the different cables, however I've noticed that in the case of using a VGA to HDMI conversion box the resolution does not get higher than 1024x768 as it does not recognize the monitor.\nLastly, in my case I had to disable the X60's native monitor output when connecting to an external monitor, as having them both on at the same time made the visual experience quite sluggish, while just having the external monitor on was with no probs at all.\n", "Q: Cannot install wine on Ubuntu natty 64bit [broken dependency] I've just installed Ubuntu natty 64bit.

This mirror is not updated very regularly and users of this mirror faced this kind of problem several times including me. So change the mirror to Main Server or US server or anything.\n\nA: Try sudo apt-get install -f \nThat will install the dependencies. \n\nA: Dunno if you've solved this already since it's been awhile, but after a few hours of mashing my head against the keyboard doing stuff that didn't work (AAAAAAAH), I solved it as described here. I've included the relevant info below. Hope it helps!\n\nOn an Ubuntu system you can install the same dev packages that the packaged Wine uses from built-in package manager:\nsudo apt-get build-dep wine1.3\n\nIf the build dependencies have changed recently, you may need to enable the Wine PPA to get an updated build-dep. Developers may want to enable the Wine PPA anyway, as it provides an updated wine-gecko package and sometimes newer versions of packages needed by Wine on older Ubuntus.\n\n", "Q: How to add a folder to a playlist in Banshee? Now how do you add an entire folder to a playlist of Banshee. Say, you have a precious folder in which you have put your favorite songs one by one. How do you create a playlist for that folder?\n\nA: You can do this using Banshee's “smart playlist“ feature:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add a new smart playlist (Media → New Smart Playlist…)\n\n*Choose “File Location“ and “Starts With“ as a criterion\n\n*Enter the name of your folder. Note that it has to be a proper URL, i.e. something like /home/user/Music/Favorites/\n\n*Then add the folders by Media-Import Media\n\n\nThe advantage of such a “smart” playlist is that it dynamically adapts, so you can simply drop new files into that folder and they will appear in the playlist.\n\nA: To achieve what you want we will create a playlist then import it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal\n\n*Go to the directory your files are in : cd /PathToMusicFiles\n\n*ls *.mp3 > playlist.m3u (if you are not importing .mp3 change the extension)\n\n*Open Banshee\n\n*Media -> Import Playlist (the file you want to import is /PathToMusicFiles/playlist.m3u)\n\n\nA: I am also trying to get an answer to the same question. Tried danjjl's suggestion. But didn't work. (2nd step was my problem)  I used New Smart Playlist. It is working well. But it is not the best method.\nTry this: Use New Smart Playlist and take this criterion (e.g.): File location, Contains, (Folder name) as content. Save it and try. \nYou will be able to add Folder with this suggestion. If it didn't work add more selection options by clicking the + sign to reach the desired folder. You can verify the number of files in the actual folder and the appeared number of files against the added folder name.\n", "Q: How can I remove the rounded edges and transparent border from a metacity theme? I have a problem with my current theme. When windows top border close to top panel, there's a transparent background at the top corner (please take a look at the attached image). \n\nSo, how could I :\n\n\n*\n\n*remove it?\n\n*change the rounded corners (I love the less rounded corners - like MAC OS X)\n\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: To change the corners, you will have to edit the theme, or choose a different one. Also, you should ensure compositing is enabled, if you want rounded corners. You can do this by using compiz instead, or by running gconf-editor, opening the /apps/metacity/general item in the tree, and enabling the compositor_effects option in the list on the right. With that on, you should not see this artifact in the theme.\n", "Q: How to fix bootchart error bootchart throws this error message.\nsudo  pybootchartgui\nNo path given, trying /var/log/bootchart.tgz  \nwarning: path '/var/log/bootchart.tgz' does not exist, ignoring.\nParse error: empty state: '/var/log/bootchart.tgz' does not contain a valid bootchart\n\n\nA: In my version of ubuntu (12.04) bootchart creates a different log file every time the computer boots, this goes into the directory /var/log/bootstrap. Though, bootstartgui looks by default to the file /var/log/bootchart.tgz which does not exist. \nIn 12.04, if you install bootchart properly, you automatically get an image file of the boot graph representation, so you do not need to run bootstartgui. \nIn fact, it is enough to run (Alt+F2):\nnautilus /var/log/bootchart\n\nthen double click on the image that contains the date and time that you are interested in. \nIf you want to delete useless logs and save space, you can start nautilus with sudo from the commandline: Type (Alt+Ctrl+T) and then:\ngksu nautilus /var/log/bootchart \n\nThis will give you a window where you can also delete files. Be very cautious not to delete anything on another folder!\n\nA: That error seems to be normal when you installed pybootchartgui (is for viewing bootcharts) but did not install package bootchart (this makes the bootchart) (source). \npybootchartgui is also used to view other machine's bootchart so bootchart is not a dependency of this package.\n\nA: Ubuntu 15.04 and later\nThe boot chart will appear in /run/log/bootchart*.svg with a time stamp in the name.\n", "Q: What is the current status of windicators? This cool feature was first told to be included in 10.10. According to this answer, they were postponed to 11.04, but it turned out they have not appeared there. Now we are after feature freeze for 11.10, and still there is no sign of them. So what's up with them?\nI haven't heard a word about them for a long time. Is this idea abandoned? Note it was initially the reason for moving the window-ops buttons to the left corner. Or maybe they are under heavy development and soon will be included in 12.04?\n\nA: I haven't heard anything about Windicators since I answered that last question. I admit I'm not everywhere and I don't see everything but I'd have expected to have seen something if development was ongoing.\nThe problem with them is they'd be a complete nightmare to implement just to do half the things Mark was hoping they would... Especially if you want to do that in a nice, standard way that works for all applications.\nThe effort is far better spent on making Unity good.\nI consider Windicators abandoned -- but I'm not in charge of anything :) They may well get pulled up later on but I can't say if or when that'll happen.\n", "Q: chmod files only in all subdirectories Please someone assist me with chmod, I have the following file structure\n-dir1\n--file1\n--file2\n--dir1a\n---file1a1\n---file1a2\n--dir1b\n---file1b1\n---file1b2\n\nHow do I chmod 655 to all files under dir1 and all subdir?\nSo all files will have 655 permission and all dir will remain as they were.\nThank you\n\nA: Better to use\nfind . -type f -exec chmod 655 -- {} +\n\nThe other proposed solution from @sagarchalise will not work if filenames contain spaces or start with a dash.\n\nA: I think going inside dir1 and\nfind . -type f | xargs chmod 655\nwill do the trick.\nOr this version, which supports file names with spaces:\nfind . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 655\n", "Q: What process are started by the system? How to find what process are started during bootup process. Are there any ways to find using any command, like one found in windows \n<msconfig>.\n\nFor more about please read.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSConfig\n\nA: Most of the scripts inside /etc/init and /etc/init.d are run during bootprocess if you haven't changed any of their configurations. There is an application called BootUpManager i.e. bum.\nsudo apt-get install bum\n\nwhich will let you configure bootup scripts.\nUbuntu uses upstart i.e. /etc/init/*.conf for bootup scripts  \n\nA: Most of the bootup processes get low PID numbers [or so it seems]. So try this\n$ ps -ef|less \nand view the low PID processes. \nAlso, as previously mentioned, check /etc/init/ and /etc/init.d/\n", "Q: How does automatic login work? I found that one my user login for user (hadoop) automatically gets logged in after boot process. I wanted to know where exactly in the boot process it does. \n\nA: In GDM. /etc/gdm/custom.conf:\n[daemon]    \nAutomaticLoginEnable=True\nAutomaticLogin=hadoop\n\nYou can just edit that manually. \n", "Q: How do you setup system email to send to a Gmail account? Often when I'm working on a terminal, I'll see the \"you have new mail in...\" message. I know I can see this mail by looking in my system's mail folder (/var/mail/), but this is inconvenient. Also, if the message is important, such as a notice about low system resources, or drive problems, or a failed cron job, I may not see that message or check the system's mail folder for weeks or more.\nHow can I set it up so that all these messages get sent to a real email service, like Gmail, which I check daily?\n\nA: See this:\n\nUsers can control their own mail delivery by specifying destinations in a file called .forward in their home directories.\n\nSo, when you do this:\necho \"yourmail@example.com\" > ~/.forward\n\nthe mails should be forwarded to the e-mail you've specified (in this case, yourmail@example.com)\n", "Q: How to install/start Ubuntu classic? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to revert to GNOME Classic? \n\nI have installed 11.10 and I understand it doesn't come with Ubuntu classic but if I really want to go back and not use Unity what options do I have?\nCan someone please guide/advise me what do I have to add/install to get Ubuntu classic as an option?\n\nA: Install the package gnome-session-fallback then you can select \"GNOME Classic\" at the login screen.\nNote that this is not Gnome2 but the Gnome3 fallback session. There are some differences to Gnome2, like you need to use Alt-righclick instead of just rightclick to edit the panel.\nSee gnome-panel is dead, long live gnome-panel for more about the new panel.\n", "Q: Synchronization of .tar.gz-file seems to constantly start all over again I am still quite new to u1 (using the integration in Ubuntu 11.04). My earlier synchronizations, though, worked fine so far (folders outside of the Ubuntu 1-folder). Simple, comfortably etc. But then my next attempt was to synchronize a .tar.gz-file (1.9 GB, this time in the u1-folder), and here u1 seems to run into problems - and/or me? What I observed: \n\n\n*\n\n*I have tried to upload the file now for about 4 days in a row (computer is in use and online most of the day and during large parts of the night, too). It\nhasn't finished yet. \n\n*At times I got every few minutes notifications\nthat u1 started the sync-process again, as if the connection had gone down in\nbetween. Once I also caught the program disconnected, not due to any\naction on my part.\n\n*The notifications have stopped, but instead I checked the current transfers via terminal (u1sdtool --current transfers). And the bytes written keep going up - and then a while later I am down a few digits again.\n\n*The amount of u1-space that I am using according to the panel hasn't changed at all.\n\n*The file is nevertheless visible in my web-account, though marked as getting synchronized.\n\n\nFrom looking around a bit, I thought first that it might have to do with the file being compressed. But that problem was solved according to posts I found here. My second guess was the file size. Again, this is supposed to be no problem. My third guess: I signed up for an account with 5 GB of free space, currently using 1.9 GB ... and the original free space given to users was 2 GB ... However, I didn't get any notifications that I'd be running out of space. (Before considering buying more space, I'd obviously want to see that things work as it is.)\nNow, if anyone has an idea, maybe even a solution for me, I'd be more than glad. :) Everything else worked so smooth so far that I'd like to stick to u1 if possible (after some very frustrating experiences with Syncplicity, for instance).\n\nA: Change the name of the file and it should upload correctly. I had a similar problem last night with a png file. I don't know what causes it and I'll leave that to one of the developers to answer, but changing the file name seems to fix the problem.\n", "Q: How to remove my application's appindicator programmatically? I know how to add an appindicator menu from my application, but I can't seem to find how to remove it but still keep my program running in the background.  Is there a way to do this?\n\nA: Found out that you can hide an indicator by calling\nindicator.set_status(appindicator.STATUS_PASSIVE)\n\nWhich was all I needed.\n", "Q: X does not want to start.

Trinitron Multiscan 20se II.  I've been trying to install Linux for two week and I'm not giving up yet!  Almost, though\n\nA: I'm giving up.  Three weeks of troubleshooting, this is too much.  I decided to install Ubuntu on a virtual box on my iMac.  Then I deleted it because it was having issues with unity and after 2 days of trying to fix it, I gave up, again.  Thank you for all of the help that I received, because it did help.\nHi, Mac.  Long time no see.\n\nA: Second Try\navtolle has reported to make an iMac with with an ATI Rage 128 device (looks like yours) to work by adding this lines at the xorg file:\n  \nSection \"Monitor\"\n\nHorizsync 28-51\nVertrefresh 43-60\n\n\nSection \"Screen\"\nSubSection \"Display\"\nModes \"1024x768\"\nEndSubSection\n\n\nSection \"DRI\"\nMode 0666\nEndSection  \n\nAlso you could change the Modes \"1024x768\" to yours (1152x870). Be careful with this because setting a bigger resolution than your card support has been report to break the monitor.\nFirst Try\nDo you know the specs of your monitor?\nHave a look at this:\n\"\nMessage: \"Screen(s) found, but none have a usable configuration\"\nYou get an error message:\n\n(EE) Screen(s) found, but none have a usable configuration.  \nFatal server error:  \nno screens found  \n\nIn most cases this means there are no video modes available for your configuration. Each entry in the list of specified or default video modes gets checked if it lies withing the limit or the hardware: if it lies within the sync range specified or probed for the monitor, if it will work with the memory available on the video card or if the pixel clock lies within the range supported by the chipsets. There are many more limits. For each rejected mode you can see in the log file the reason for rejection:\n\n...\n(II) VGA(0): Not using default mode \"320x200\" (vrefresh out of range)  \n(II) VGA(0): Not using default mode \"720x400\" (insufficient memory for mode)  \n(II) VGA(0): Not using default mode \"360x200\" (hsync out of range)  \n...  \n\nIn most cases the monitor ranges are the reason why your modes where rejected. Please try to extend these ranges carefully until you get a working mode. Please note: on older monitors you need to be careful extending the ranges as it can be easily destroyed. There may be other reasons why you get this message.\nIf the specified depth is not supported with your hardware.\nIn this case try depth 8, or if you are using the vga driver even depth 4.\nIf you specified a combination of options the driver cannot handle.\nIf loading of a required sub module wasn't successful. In this case you'll get a message that the loading failed. Please try to investigate, why. The message may give you a clue: you may be using the wrong version of the module, or the file may not exist.\n\"\n\nA: The error in your latest edit is due to a missing monitor section:\nCan I suggest the following simple xorg.conf based on the values you have given:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier  \"Configured Video Device\"\n    Driver      \"ATI Technologies Inc Rage 128 PF/PRO AGP 4x TMDS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier  \"Configured Monitor\"\n    Horizsync   24-82\n    Vertrefresh 56-85\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier  \"Default Screen\"\n    Monitor     \"Configured Monitor\"\n    Device      \"Configured Video Device\"\n    Subsection \"Display\"\n       Modes    \"800x600\" \"1024x768\"\n    EndSubsection\nEndSection\n\nSection \"DRI\"\n  Mode 0666\nEndSection\n\nIf you dont have the correct Driver \"ATI Technologies Inc Rage 128 PF/PRO AGP 4x TMDS\" value try \"vesa\" instead \n\nA: As I pointed out yesterday personally I feel the best solution for you would have been to post on the actual thread.  It is important that people let me know if they are having problems with the guide.  Maybe I have got something wrong or perhaps could explain it better?\nYou say you are using a non standard external monitor. Therefore it is inadvisable to use an xorg.conf that you just found 'on the internet'. If I am reading correctly you first tried to configure your own xorg.conf so that is good.  However, it is also useful to have a look at what other people do if you run into problems. Have a look on the linked site in the guide which has many sample xorg.conf files.\nAs previously advised you only need 1 of each section.  So shortening your orginal xorg.conf I get this:\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"X.org Configured\"\n    Screen         \"Screen0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier   \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName   \"Monitor Vendor\"\n    ModelName    \"Monitor Model\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n        ### Available Driver options are:-\n        ### Values: <i>: integer, <f>: float, <bool>: \"True\"/\"False\",\n        ### <string>: \"String\", <freq>: \"<f> Hz/kHz/MHz\",\n        ### <percent>: \"<f>%\"\n        ### [arg]: arg optional\n        #Option     \"NoAccel\"               # [<bool>]\n        #Option     \"SWcursor\"              # [<bool>]\n        #Option     \"Dac6Bit\"               # [<bool>]\n        #Option     \"Dac8Bit\"               # [<bool>]\n        #Option     \"DMAForXv\"              # [<bool>]\n        #Option     \"ForcePCIMode\"          # [<bool>]\n        #Option     \"CCEPIOMode\"            # [<bool>]\n        #Option     \"CCENoSecurity\"         # [<bool>]\n        #Option     \"CCEusecTimeout\"        # <i>\n        #Option     \"AGPMode\"               # <i>\n        #Option     \"AGPSize\"               # <i>\n        #Option     \"RingSize\"              # <i>\n        #Option     \"BufferSize\"            # <i>\n        #Option     \"EnablePageFlip\"        # [<bool>]\n        #Option     \"Display\"               # <str>\n        #Option     \"PanelWidth\"            # <i>\n        #Option     \"PanelHeight\"           # <i>\n        #Option     \"ProgramFPRegs\"         # [<bool>]\n        #Option     \"UseFBDev\"              # [<bool>]\n        #Option     \"VideoKey\"              # <i>\n        #Option     \"ShowCache\"             # [<bool>]\n        #Option     \"VGAAccess\"             # [<bool>]\n    Identifier  \"Card0\"\n    Driver      \"r128\"\n    BusID       \"PCI:0:16:0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier \"Screen0\"\n    Device     \"Card0\"\n    Monitor    \"Monitor0\"\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Viewport   0 0\n        Depth     1\n    EndSubSection\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Viewport   0 0\n        Depth     4\n    EndSubSection\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Viewport   0 0\n        Depth     8\n    EndSubSection\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Viewport   0 0\n        Depth     15\n    EndSubSection\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Viewport   0 0\n        Depth     16\n    EndSubSection\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Viewport   0 0\n        Depth     24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nIf that doesn't work then try the following option in your device section: \nOption      \"UseFBDev\"      \"False\" \nSome people seem to use this too:\nOption      \"NoInt10\"       \"True\"\nFor further queries please post on the thread/guide, but it seems you have given up so this answer maybe redundant anyway.  I hope you give lubuntu or xubuntu another try on your powerpc. The apple forum has a lot of information on it for you to tap into.  \n\nA: Adding Option \"NoInt10\" \"true\", and setting \"UseFBDev\" to \"false\" works for certain, however you get a particularly sluggish system. The problem has to do with the fact that r128 support has been pulled from mesa-gl, and usually ubuntu pulls it from the distro as well. To solve this last problem I had to recompile a kernel with the rage 128 compiled as a built-in \"driver\". I now only have a problem with udev, which I currently workaround by stopping it with: sudo stop udev.\nThe following xorg.conf made my xserver work without recompiling a kernel, sluggish is better then nothing for now:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier      \"ATI Technologies Inc Rage 128 PF/PRO AGP 4x TMDS\"\n    Driver          \"r128\"\n    BusID           \"PCI:0:16:0\"\n        Option      \"UseFBDev\"      \"false\"\n        Option      \"NoInt10\"       \"true\"\n        Option      \"Display\"       \"CRT\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier  \"Configured Monitor\"\n    VendorName  \"LG\"\n    ModelName   \"LG FLATRON L1919S\"\n    HorizSync   30.0-83.0\n    VertRefresh 56.0-75.0\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier  \"Default Screen\"\n    Monitor     \"Configured Monitor\"\n    Device      \"ATI Technologies Inc Rage 128 PF/PRO AGP 4x TMDS\"\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n        Modes       \"1280x1024\" \"1024x768\" \"800x600\"\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\n\nA: Colaborative wiki for Apple iMac G3 and others:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://wiki.gilug.org/index.php/AppleImacG3350-ubuntu1104\nThere you can find a working xorg.conf\n", "Q: Annotating packages at installation to ease maintenance with apt / aptitude  I manage my packages with aptitude.\nI occasionally go through my list of packages, removing obsolete\napplications (in the sense that I do not want to use them any more).\nFor example, while I have a limited number of development libraries on my\nsystem that I do want installed permanently, a lot were just there to\nallow me to compile some program from source once, and a long time\nago. To make those clean-up sessions take unneeded dependencies into\naccount, I use the markauto command of\naptitude.\nThe problem is that I sometimes can no longer trust my memory to make the\ndifference between packages that are transient, and things that I need to\nkeep (because, e.g., I will need them to recompile something\ntomorrow). The situation is even more acute when I share administration\nduties over a server with another admin. Alternatively, I wish I would\nhave the discipline to clean up all packages that are transient after\nuse, but history proves it's too much to hope for.\nHence : is there a tool that, like markauto would let me annotate packages at\ninstallation time, not with a flag but with a simple comment string saying why they are\nbeing installed?\nIdeally, that comment would be retrievable with aptitude\n(or synaptic, or whatever kids these days use to manage\npackages). Ideally, this would be something that me and another admin on the same server can collaborate on, and it would thus, for example,\nbenefit from the same lock-management system as the package-tree already has.\n\nA: Aptitude supports \"user tags\", see if they meet your requirements.\n   add-user-tag, remove-user-tag\n       Adds a user tag to or removes a user tag from the selected group of\n       packages. If a package name contains a tilde (\"~\") or question mark\n       (\"?\"), it is treated as a search pattern and the tag is added to or\n       removed from all the packages that match the pattern (see the\n       section \"Search Patterns\" in the aptitude reference manual).\n\n       User tags are arbitrary strings associated with a package. They can\n       be used with the ?user-tag(<tag>) search term, which will select\n       all the packages that have a user tag matching <tag>.\n\nAlso see the options --add-user-tag, --add-user-tag-to, --remove-user-tag, --remove-user-tag-from. One example usage:\naptitude install cinnamon --add-user-tag \"for=cinnamon; date=$(date)\"\n\nNevertheless, I fear they are only visible/usable through aptitude.\n", "Q: Problem running windows software on wine I installed a windows game successfully, however when I tried to run it, the software is asking me to insert the CD into the CD-ROM, which I did.

You'll need to shrink the partition to free up some unallocated space on the drive. Then you will be able to create a new Linux partition in that space.\nGParted is not installed by default, look for it in the Software Center or install it in therminal by doing\nsudo apt-get install gparted   \n\nIt won't be possible to modify your Ubuntu root partition (or, more precisely, any partition which is in use) while booted in Ubuntu. To do this, boot from Ubuntu Live CD and run GParted from there.\nMake sure you have a backup of your important data before proceeding because it's a potentially dangerous operation.\nYou can find more documentation on GParted here: http://gparted.sourceforge.net/ \n\nA: You can re-size partitions, provided they are not in use mounted when you do so.\nIt will probably be easier to do this after booting up using a live disk. Not into your installed system. \nAs this is risky you should make sure you have a back up before you begin. I lost a whole system due to a power out-age do this. You have no excuses for not having back ups if some thing goes wrong.\nYou may need to install additional file systems tools such as ntfs-tools if you want to re-size partitions other then ext2/3/4. \nLots of good documentation on using Gparted can be found here.\nhttp://gparted.sourceforge.net/documentation.php \nWith this document giving you step for step instructions on how to re-size a partition. With nice screen shots.\nhttp://gparted.sourceforge.net/larry/resize/resizing.htm\n\nA: It's a very generic question so I'll do some assumptions and write a generic answer. Usually if I have to do such things and the other operating system is windows I do the following. In windows disable hybernation and fast boot (depends by the windows version). Use defrag 2 times and fully defrag every disk windows can see. Write on your phone the amount of space you have available in windows and the amount of ram on that machine. Then produce a live usb with Gparted live. Reboot windows and boot the gparted live usb. Decrease size of the windows partition but leave at least twice the size of the ram on that partition (just to be sure). Increase the size of linux partition you want to increase. Commit your changes and reboot. Boot linux and check if everything works. Boot Windows and check if everything works. Be happy.\n", "Q: How to use SSH (ssh & rsync commands)? How can I SSH with a remote server so I can browse files and edit them? I have a username and password to use.\n\nA: You could use sshfs to mount a remote directory to your local filesystem.\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSHFS:\nCommand-line Usage\nNow, assuming that you have an SSH server running on a remote machine, simply run the SSHFS command to mount the remote directory. In this example, the remote directory is /projects on remote host far. The local mount point is ~/far_projects.\nmkdir ~/far_projects\nsshfs -o idmap=user $USER@far:/projects ~/far_projects\n\nTo unmount,\nfusermount -u ~/far_projects\n\nTo add it to your /etc/fstab,\nsshfs#$USER@far:/projects /home/$USER/far_projects fuse defaults,idmap=user 0 0\n\nNote that you have to change $USER to your login name when editing fstab, but it is not necessary when typing commands (the shell does it for you in that case).\n\nA: SSH comes by default in all Ubuntu versions so you save in having to install it (+1 for having it already there ;) )\nExcept of course in the case where you want a SSH server for your Ubuntu server. In that case you would\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server \n\nwhich should make your computer/server ready to be a ssh server.\nTo use it is fairly easy:\nssh USER@SITE for example if my username is cyrex and the site is ubuntu.com then you would do this:\nssh cyrex@ubuntu.com\n\nNow lets say you want to copy a file called bubblegum.txt from your computer to your ubuntu site and want to leave that file at the /var/www folder in the ubuntu site. you can do this (assuming your user has enough permissions in the ubuntu site) by using SSH's Brother, SCP (Which also comes by default in Ubuntu):\nscp bubblegum.txt cyrex@ubuntu.com:/var/www \n\nNotice the : between the USER@SITE and the folder where you want to copy it. It is the one that separates both elements.\nNow lets say you are uploading some huge file with scp and then the worst happens, the world explodes. How can you keep on uploading that file to the server. Then you got SCP's big brother, rsync (Comes by default in Ubuntu). In many ways scp and rsync do the same thing but here are some big differences between them:\n\n*\n\n*rsync can upload partial files left from rsync or scp after a disconnection or world domination.\n\n*rsync can show the progress much better than scp\n\n*rsync can optimize the upload in such a way that you can actually save seconds or minutes on the upload. It also shows at the end of the upload how much you have saved.\n\nAnyway, in the case scp could not upload the entire file this is where rsync comes in to rescue. (Thanks to Marco Ceppi for the tip. Vote up his comment if you like cats.. and/or dogs)\nLets say you did the upload mention above from scp and it got to 60%. How can you continue in that 60% without losing your times worth for the upload. You would do this:\nrsync --progress --partial bubblegum.txt cyrex@ubuntu.com:/var/www  \n\nThis tells rsync to show the progress in a nice human readable way with the --progress flag. It also tells rsync to check and continue from where the file bubblegum.txt got to with the --partial flag. You can also simplify the amount to write with the -P parameter which is the same as --progress and --partial, so the above would look like this:\nrsync -P bubblegum.txt cyrex@ubuntu.com:/var/www  \n\nYou can even CTRL+C the upload and resume it by doing the command from rsync above. Very cool to have the ability to resume something anytime any amount of times.\nFor more info for rsync which comes by default with Ubuntu you can type the following terminal commands:\nman rsync  \ninfo rsync  \nrsync --help\n\nNow to specify a port for SSH. To specify it you can do it like this:\nssh cyrex@ubuntu.com -p PORT. For example: ssh cyrex@ubuntu.com -p 1234 to tell it to use Port 1234 for the SSH service. This has to be configured in the server first for it to work.\nTo configure it just open in the server the file ssh_config like this: nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config and change the line that says # port 22 to another port. Also remember to remove the comment from that line. It should look like this: port 1234 in the case for the example above.\nNow just restart the ssh service in the server and you are done. To restart the service just do this:\nsudo restart ssh\n\nor\nsudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart\n\nNOTE - You can also use SSH from GUI tools like filezilla which offer the option to use ssh instead of ftp. ssh can also be accessed from within the Ubuntu menu:\n\nwhich gives access to several options including Windows share, SSH and FTP:\n\nFor more information about SSH you can use one of the following commands in console in your Ubuntu box:\nman ssh  \ninfo ssh  \nssh --help\n\n\nA: Assuming the ssh server is already set up, open a terminal and type:\nssh username@hostname\n\nYou'll be prompted for your password; just enter it. If you need a port number, add -p PORTNUM.\n\nA: If you want to browse the server through Nautilus like you do with files on your local machine:\n\n*\n\n*Open Nautilus (\"Home Folder\")\n\n\n*Go to \"File\" --> \"Connect to Server\"\n\n\n\n*Select \"SSH\" under \"Service Type\"\n\n\n*Put the IP address or domain under \"Server\"\n\n\n\n*Add your username and check \"Add bookmark\" if you want the location saved to your bookmarks.\nThe folder should open right up for you.\n\nA: If you can use Vim, Pico, or etc, you can use the terminal:\nssh MYUSER@mysite.com\n\nEnter your password, and you are in.  From there, it's just like a regular terminal, except you have no GUI.  \nNote, you can add the '-X' option, and if your server has an X server configured, you can run GUI programs.  Just type their name if you added -X and it will launch a GUI window.\nNow, you will probably want to set up passwordless login.  If you have no key already, type ssh-keygen and just hit enter to all the defaults.  Then do ssh-copy-id MYUSER@mysite.com.  Once that's done, just type in ssh MYUSER@mysite.com and you don't have to enter your password!\nIf your username is the same as your Laptop's username, you do not need MYUSER@.  You can just do ssh mysite.com.  You can also use the -l MYUSER option instead of MYUSER@\nIf you want a GUI, Nautilus can do this.  File -> Connect to Server -> [select 'SSH', then fill in login details] ->  Connect.\nIf you want to just copy a single file, use scp [secure copy].\nscp MYUSER@mysite.com:path/to/file.dat ./\nThis copies the file \"~/path/to/file.dat\" to your current directory.  Note, if you do not have a slash or tilde after the :, it will act like you are in your home directory [~/].  If you want to upload, scp ./local_file.dat  MYUSER@mysite.com:\nThat will put it in your home dir.\n\nA: ssh -X -C user@host nautilus --no-desktop to go in gui mode :)\n", "Q: Why is start menu button not showing up? why ubuntu start button not showing up in ubuntu 11.10; While upgrade from 11.04 to 11.10 it throwed me upgrade not successful, but i'm able to login as 11.10, now that i see there is no ubuntu start button. \n\nA: The \"Start\" button is on the left side, the first button on the launcher.\n\n\nA: As far as I'm aware, the \"Ubuntu start button\" has moved in 11.10 from the top menu to the panel - the panel is displayed when you move mouse cursor to the left edge of the screen.\nSee this for more details: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/08/revamped-dash-lands-unity-2d/\nThere is a chance, however, that you mean something completely different :)\n", "Q: How do I easily rename multiple files using command line? One of the ways I quickly rename files in Windows is \nF2 > Rename > Tab (to next file) > Rename ...\n\nBut in Ubuntu/Nautilus, I can't tab to next file. But being on Linux, I think there must be a command line alternative.\nHowever, sometimes, I may want more control over how to rename specific files. In that case, perhaps its better to be able to tab to the next file\n\nA: Not really the same question as How can rename many files at once? but I'm going to suggest the same program that I suggested in that answer: qmv.\nqmv is a handy tool from the renameutils package. It enables you to use your favorite text editor to rename files. Combined with the power of vim, you have an excellent renaming utility.\nI usually invoke it like qmv -f do in the dir where I want to rename a bunch of files. Or if I want to rename recursively qmv -R -f do.\nWhenever I have the need to rename multiple files, I always fall back on qmv (and vim).\nhttp://www.nongnu.org/renameutils/\n\nA: In the command line, to rename a single file the command is simply\nmv file1.txt file2.txt\n\nIf you want to do it in batch, you'll probably want to do it via a script. If you provide more details I or someone else can probably whip one up for you. That said, a script to append stuff to a file might look like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nfor file in *\ndo\n    # separate the file name from its extension\n    if [[ $file == *.* ]]; then\n      ext=\"${file##*.}\"\n      fname=\"${file%.*}\"\n      mv \"$file\" \"${fname}_APPENDSTUFFHERE.$ext\"\n    else\n      mv \"$file\" \"${file}_APPENDSTUFFHERE\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nDepending on exactly how you need things renamed this will likely be tweaked, for instance if you have specific renaming rules to follow. (Personally I'd do this via a Perl script since my bash-foo is not that great, but that's just me.)\nNote that I got the separation of filename and extension from a previously asked question.\n\nA: In case you want to do it without command line, similarly to what you have been doing in Windows, use right arrow key instead of tab key. This will select the next file just as tab does in Windows.\n\nA: If the only suitable option is renaming the files manually, a great way to do that is using vidir (in the moreutils package):\nsudo add-apt-repository universe && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install moreutils\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       vidir allows editing of the contents of a directory in a text editor.\n       If no directory is specified, the current directory is edited.\n\n       When editing a directory, each item in the directory will appear on\n       its own numbered line. These numbers are how vidir keeps track of what\n       items are changed. Delete lines to remove files from the directory, or\n       edit filenames to rename files. You can also switch pairs of numbers\n       to swap filenames.\n\n       Note that if \"-\" is specified as the directory to edit, it reads a\n       list of filenames from stdin and displays those for editing.\n       Alternatively, a list of files can be specified on the command line.\n\nExamples\n\nRenaming files selectively\nCurrent working directory's content:\n.\n├── bar\n├── baz\n└── foo\n\nRun vidir, rename the filenames in the lines containing the filenames you wish to rename; hit CTRL+O and CTRL+X:\n\n.\n├── bar.bak\n├── baz.old\n└── foo.new\n\n\nSwitching filenames selectively\nCurrent working directory's content:\n.\n├── bar\n├── baz\n└── foo\n\nCurrent working directory's files' content:\n$ for f in *; do printf '- %s:\\n\\n' \"$f\"; cat \"$f\"; echo; done\n- bar:\n\nThis is bar\n\n- baz:\n\nThis is baz\n\n- foo:\n\nThis is foo\n\n$ \n\nRun vidir, switch the numbers in the lines containing the filenames you wish to switch; hit CTRL+O and CTRL+X:\n\n.\n├── bar\n├── baz\n└── foo\n\n$ for f in *; do printf '- %s:\\n\\n' \"$f\"; cat \"$f\"; echo; done\n- bar:\n\nThis is foo\n\n- baz:\n\nThis is bar\n\n- foo:\n\nThis is baz\n\n$ \n\n\nRemoving files selectively\nCurrent working directory's content:\n.\n├── bar\n├── baz\n└── foo\n\nRun vidir, remove the lines containing the files you wish to delete; hit CTRL+O and CTRL+X:\n\n.\n└── baz\n\n\nA: Try pyrenamer.\nIt's not integrated with nautilus, but it gets the job done. Here is a review.\nThunar (part of XFCE) also has a renamer that you can run separately.\n\n\nA: I use rename all the time.  It is pretty simple, but hopefully you know basic regex:\nrename \"s/SEARCH/REPLACE/g\"  *\n\nThis will replace the string SEARCH with REPLACE in every file (that is, *).  The /g means global, so if you had a SEARCH_SEARCH.jpg, it would be renamed REPLACE_REPLACE.jpg. If you didn't have /g, it would have only done substitution once, and thus now named REPLACE_SEARCH.jpg.  If you want case-insensitive, add /i (that would be, /gi or /ig at the end).\nWith regular expressions, you can do lots more. \nNote that this rename is the prename (aka Perl rename) command, which supports complete Perl regular expressions. There is another rename which uses patterns, and is not as powerful. prename used to be installed by default on Ubuntu (along with Perl), but now you may have to do:\nsudo apt install rename\n\n\nHere are a few examples:\nPrefix\nAdd:\nrename 's/^/MyPrefix_/' * \n\n\n\n*\n\n*document.pdf renamed to MyPrefix_document.pdf\nRemove:\nAlso you can remove unwanted strings.  Let's say you had 20 MP3 files named like CD RIP 01 Song.mp3 and you wanted to remove the \"CD RIP\" part, and you wanted to remove that from all of them with one command.\nrename 's/^CD RIP //' *\n\n\n\n*\n\n*CD RIP 01 Song.mp3 to 01 Song.mp3\nNotice the extra space in '^CD RIP ', without the space all files would have a space as the first character of the file.  Also note, this will work without the ^ character, but would match CD RIP  in any part of the filename.  The ^ guarantees it only removes the characters if they are the beginning of the file.  \nSuffix\nAdd:\nrename 's/$/_MySuffix/' *\n\n\n\n*\n\n*document.pdf renamed to document.pdf_MySuffix\nChange:\nrename 's/\\.pdf$/.doc/' *\n\nwill change Something.pdf into Something.doc. (The reason for the backslash is, . is a wildcard character in regexp so .pdf matches qPDF whereas \\.pdf only matches the exact string .pdf. Also very important to note, if you are not familiar with BASH, you must put backslashes in SINGLE quotes!  You may not omit quotes or use double quotes, or bash will try to translate them.  To bash \\. and \"\\.\" equals .. (But double-quotes and backslashes are used, for example \"\\n\" for a newline, but since \"\\.\" isn't a valid back escape sequence, it translates into .)\nActually, you can even enclose the parts of the string in quotes instead of the whole: 's/Search/Replace/g' is the same as s/'Search'/'Replace'/g and s/Search/Replace/g to BASH. You just have to be careful about special characters (and spaces).\n\nI suggest using the -n option when you are not positive you have the correct regular expressions. It shows what would be renamed, then exits without doing it. For example:\nrename -n s/'One'/'Two'/g *\n\nThis will list all changes it would have made, had you not put the -n flag there.  If it looks good, press Up to go back, then erase the -n and press Enter (or replace it with -v to output all changes it makes).\nNote: Ubuntu versions above 17.04 don't ship with rename by default, however it's still available in the repositories. Use sudo apt install rename to install it\n\nA: I'm using krename. It is a GUI app. It could read mp3 tags and so on.\nIt exists as a separate app as well as a part of Krusader.\nThere's also a rename script - which is a part of standard perl installation (You probably have it installed). Check it out with man rename.\n\nA: There seems to be a project on launchpad called nautilus-renamer. You can install it by running make install once you download the script and untar it. It seems to have some functionalities or if you do know some programming may be you could just enhance it to your need as it is just a python script. \n\n", "Q: Can anybody help me to make Kworld UB445-Q TV tuner work?

I'd like to do it, because of the firefox extended-selection feature (acutally it is a XULrunner feature - which is a firefox engine).\nAnother solution would be to find out where all the KDE help handbooks are located. Do you happen to know that?\nEdit: knowing where they are won't help - since them are in a docbook format - not in html.\n\nA: You cannot use Firefox as your help browser in KDE.\nFrom the Kubuntu-docs package:\n\nThough KHelpCenter is recommended, all documentation in this package\n  is HTML, which means you can view it with any web browser by browsing\n  to /usr/share/doc/kde/HTML/en/kubuntu/\"section\".\n\nAlso the KOffice-doc-html package:\n\nThe documentation will be installed into the usual directories\n  /usr/share/doc/kde4/HTML/\"language\"/\"app\"/, for instance\n  /usr/share/doc/kde4/HTML/en/kword/.\n\nIn other words, you will just have to use KHelpCenter, or manually convert the files from docbook format to HTML (which I will not cover here as that is out of the scope of the question).\n", "Q: failed to boot grub when adding a windows partition on XP First,I installed XP working.\nSecond,I installed Ubuntu 10.10 64 bits working,and I have some disk space unused.\nThird,I boot into XP and use XP's tool to add one partition D.\nBut when I reboot,the grub failed to boot.\nIt shows\n  grub rescue>\n\n  ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo fdisk /dev/sda\n\n  WARNING: DOS-compatible mode is deprecated.

It might work to just create a new ext4 partition in the remaining space of the extended partition but i doupt that the old data would still be there. you'd need lots of luck.\nI assume that the XP partition tool somehow broke it because it's not aware of other operating systems with other partition types. In future always use the linux tools for partitioning. they don't bully windows partitions.\n", "Q: Is there a program where I can embed other programs' windows? I'm a developer and am often working on multiple different projects. It would help me a lot to have a software where I can create a profile for each project. If I start a profile it should open other programs I configured before and display them inside a single window. It should be possible to arrange them in tabs or also on a screen, one on the left and one on the right or similar.\nI think mainly about browsers, PDF-viewers and terminals. This will give me access to the bug-tracker in a browser, log output in a console, specifications in a PDF and so on. It would make switching between projects much easier.\nIs there anything or does anyone have a hint how it could be implemented with a scripting language?\n\nA: What I'm offering is little more than a theory. It may lead nowhere.\nThere are alternative window-managers like bluetile, xmonad and awesome that can nest multiple windows in a nice tiling configuration (that is, all child windows are placed next to each other, rather than being allowed to overlap.\nThey can all (and there are a lot more than just those) be scripted in various languages. bluetile and xmonad both use Haskell while awesome uses lua. \nThe problem is, they replace the standard window manager. bluetile is the only one designed to work alongside traditional Gnome components so you might have most initial luck with that. Either way, you might battle to keep both a traditional desktop and be able to swap out for a tiled one. You might find that creating a new user for each project where each has its own desktop configuration, is what works best.\nThat said, you might find you prefer a tiled desktop for everything.\n\nA: KDE provides exactly this functionality with a feature called 'activites'.

(A metaphorical tweezer rather than a sledgehammer.)\nYou can use any editing command instead of sed. For example, if you wanted to use ed to touch up a line that starts out looking like this:\n2 * * * * /sbin/flitch --days 3,4 > /var/log/flitch.out 2>&1\n\nSay this line is among many lines or you have many different crontabs to update on different systems and you only know your line is going to be the only line with the term flitch in it.\nIt might look like:\n$ cat /tmp/edscript\n/flitch\ns/3/9/\nw\nq\n$ crontab -l > /tmp/out && ed /tmp/out < /tmp/edscript && crontab - < /tmp/out\n$ crontab -l\n...\n2 * * 1 * /sbin/flitch --days 9,4 > /var/log/flitch.out 2>&1\n...\n\nNow I must admit that nearly 100% of the time sed will do what ed will do, but it's always good to have an extra tool on the Swiss army knife. ^.^\n", "Q: VLC HD bad playback I'm getting unsmooth and unsynced vertical playback placback with VLC. My hardware is certainly capable of running 1080p. It's watchable but not as good as on windows with media player classic and the k-lite codec pack.

This is what both your client and external relays use to move messages around the internet. SMTP uses port 25.\nDovecot has nothing to do with how emails land on your server. For this you need a Mail Transfer Agent like postfix. This is a SMTP server that will listen for external connections and route emails accordingly.\nInstall that from the command line (it'll walk you through some configuration options). You'll want to research the configuration because it can get a little complicated and you don't want to be an open relay (that is, you only want to accept email for your domains, and not forward on emails from spammers)\n\nA: I've got the same problem: can receive mails and consult them only if they are sent from the same machine on which run the mail servers.

I just built an HTPC / homeserver, I used ubuntu 10.04 lucid lynx and combined it with xbmc. \nThe hardware I'm using is Asus e35m pro (embedded low voltage cpu and HD6310 gpu). \nHowever if I run 1080p video footage, everything starts to stutter. I checked with htop from an ssh connection and noticed one of the cores goes into 100% load. \nI was wondering why it does not use the GPU instead ? (I have installed proprietary drivers from ATI). Do I have to change settings ? \nIs it XBMC related, ubuntu related or does ATI just not support hardware video decoding on their GPU on linux ?  \n\nA: I am not sure who to point the finger at, but what essentially happened is that NVIDIA provided one API to do this with their cards and ATI provided one for theirs. As you can guess they are not the same, so in order for programs to take advantage of this, they have to be coded to support it. \nFrom what I can find, this is not currently in the stable release of XBMC (Dharma 10.1), but lucky for you is in branch for the next release. Your options at this point are to either wait for the Eden edition, or jump ahead and get a nightly build of XBMC. Obviously the nightly build can be unstable, and you have to accept that as part of the risk if you choose to so. \nIf you want to go the nightly route, check out this thread on the XBMC forums that gives you a couple different options and ways to get it installed.\nOh, also apparently if you are willing to go the Windows (ducks just in case somebody gets mad, sorry) route, the zacate seems to work pretty well on that platform also. \n\nA: I have same hardware and this thread was big help for me. Especially xbmc from lars-opdenkamp repository.\nhttp://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?t=98169\n\nA: I am assuming you have a fusion based system? For me the following guide was very helpful: http://youresuchageek.blogspot.nl/2012/06/xbmc-install-and-config-howto-for-linux.html\nIf you just want xbmc in ubuntu (not standalone) install the xbmc-xvba from the wsnipex ppa as mentioned in the guide. (also follow the bit on only enabling xvba, not vaapi and vdpau and the refreshrates). For me (on ubuntu 12.04) compiz didn't like xbmc but if I started xbmc with the following script it worked as expected and with hardware acceleration:\n#!/bin/bash\nmetacity --replace &\nsleep 2s\nxbmc\nunity --replace &\nexit;\n\nIt will kill compiz, start xbmc, and start compiz again when you're closing xbmc.\n", "Q: How to achieve media streaming from my local machine to the internet?

This might be a little off-topic but I ran that command under Mac OS X and it didn't complain about anything, nothing bad happened.\nI have the familiar setup, Mac G4 800mhz 832mb ram lubuntu 11.04\n\nA: Mac OS X uses a different file system type (HFS+), which based on your feedback (I don't use it) can be checked with the filesystem mounted.\nExt3 and Ext4 can not be safely checked while mounted.\n\nA: Running fsck -fy on a mounted ext3/ext4 formatted drive is not recommended because logically, it will be trying to analyse for inconsistencies on effectively a moving target.  The action of modifying the filesystem means that anything you have analysed will have to be reanalysed.\nThere is very similar question and answer on the Unix Stackoverflow site that has more detail as to why it is a bad idea.\n\nA: You cannot do that because you can cause damage to the partitions.\nWhat you can do is first umount the disk you're interested in and do the fsck, if it's the root disk, the simplest thing you can do is to run an ubuntu live cd and run it from there.\n", "Q: Are there any lightweight XMPP server?

I have an installation service in a central data centre and proxies in other data centres and need to pre-populate those proxies with the contents of the installation.\nWhat's the best way to do this? \nI've been thinking of writing a script along the lines of:\n\n\n*\n\n*debootstrap - with --include option to include all additional packages above and beyond the minimal setup, run this once inside each DC to populate the proxy.\n\n*apt-proxy-import - apt-proxy can add debs directly into the cache, take them from an existing installs /var/cache/apt/archives dir.\n\n*Take the cache miss and have a slow first install?\n\nA: Have you considered using apt-proxy or apt-cacher-ng instead of squid? To make use of squid's caching, you could allow either of those through squid to the internet.

Since we're past feature freeze does that mean that there will be no more efforts into integration of Thunderbird and Unity?\n\nA: According to this article, Thunderbird has already achieved complete integration with all of the special menu schemes in Unity. Even if 11.10 ships without complete integration, it shouldn't be any trouble to add it in yourself. You'll either be able to manually modify it, or add in a Mozilla PPA which includes a post-feature-freeze version of Thunderbird and Lightning.\nIt's already quite possible to add Thunderbird to the time/date indicator in Ubuntu: these instructions will take you through it step by step. They also explains how to thoroughly integrate Thunderbird with your Ubuntu desktop.\nSince we're in feature freeze, there aren't likely to be major changes to the calendar indicator design before 11.10. This should make it easier for the Thunderbird developers (and independent add-on developers) to update their Unity-ready addons for 11.10. If you're looking for other unity-specific ways to make Thunderbird play nice with Ubuntu check out these three addons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu Unity Messaging Menu Integration\n\n*Unity Launcher Integration\n\n*Ubuntu Unity unread count and quicklist\nNote that they may become unnecessary, if Mozilla continues to add Ubuntu/Unity functionality directly into Thunderbird. This AskUbuntu answer gives some other ways that you can customize your Unity Thunderbird launcher.\nIf you're feeling particularly adventurous, and want to try out the latest and greatest versions of Thunderbird right now, you can try out one of the Mozilla personal package archives:\n\n\n*\n\n*Thunderbird Stable (the current version)\n\n*Thunderbird Next (beta)\n\n", "Q: How do I set a VLC instance to run as a Live Wallpaper I've seen an article describing how to use VLC as a live wallpaper for the desktop, however the options mentioned there only refer to Windows.\nWhat would I need to do to achieve the same result?\n\nA: VLC does support video as background. Simply run the cvlc command:\ncvlc --video-wallpaper --no-audio /your/videofile\n\nThere are other helpful options to cvlc such as aspect ratio etc. You can find them using \nvlc --help\n\nIf you still want icons on your desktop you may need to take a look at xwinwrap, but it requires a little digging. There is an option to set movies as background. I dont know how to do it with VLC but it has been done with mplayer. \n\nA: vlc does not work on either windows or Linux for the backdrop.  The only thing it does is play full screen with no controls.  It does NOT place the video in the background.  I have been working with it for over two years and that is the best I can get out of it!\n", "Q: Where can I find the source for libtracker-miner? I've compiled Tracker from sources as described here. But when running 'tracker-control' it says something about not being able to load libtracker-miner-0.12.so.0 (see error message below).

I'm looking for a laptop for work, and I will be running Ubuntu as primary OS (close to 100% of the time).\nThe Toshiba Tecra R840 caught my eye with its higher resolution display (1600x900). I cannot find any information on Linux compatibility however. I am looking at ordering with integrated Intel HD 3000 graphics only, no switchable graphics or anything.\nAny thoughts? If there are laptops with similar specs (high res display, <1\" thick, light, sandy bridge core i5/i7) that are known to be Ubuntu compatible, please point me to them.\n\nA: Try the Lenovo Thinkpad T510 or T520 with integrated graphics.

I can recommend to you any Acer (as brand) and Acer TravelMate whole series, even older systems which shipped with an OS preinitialised, such as Vista, XP, etc. You can add packages such as the travel mate package after installation and all special dedicated buttons will work. This will make you feel like those series were built to use Ubuntu. What's more, the packages is free, and that package was developed in a time when Acer was not giving official support, so it has a long, positive usage history, and with time became even better.\nEven if you take anything similar from HP, or Dell, you will not miss. Best of all, describe what you need and contact some of those companies that I mention.\n\nA: The resolution of the screen for the laptop is not a problem for Ubuntu. Does not matter if it is higher, Ubuntu will just work. There is one example I can mention that I had the pleasure to test which was an Acer Aspire that was 18.6'. If I remember correctly it was 1920x1080 resolution and Ubuntu did not have any problem detecting that resolution or any of the resolutions below that one. Not even when I connected a Video Beam to it to have 2 monitors. No problem at all.\nI can not say about other laptops but for the past 2 to 3 years with the many laptops that have passed me by none had any problem related to resolution or if Ubuntu could detect it or not.\nLike I said, Ubuntu just works for laptops resolutions (Sounds like an Ad but is true)\n", "Q: Can't install package libglib2.0-dev because it depends on some unknown version I have 10.04.2 LTS and I want to install libglib2.0-dev.

Ubuntu is trying to extract compressed files from the exe-file, perceiving it to be a self-extracting zip-file, which it is not. \nThe first thing you should do, is to find out why you want to use Itunes. Is it possible that there are other players that are better suited to your needs? \nI don't think Itunes can be used on other platforms than OS X and Windows. If you really have to use it, then you'll need to install Wine or you can install Windows in virtualbox or something and run Itunes on that. \n\nA: By default Ubuntu tries to open an .exe file as if it is a zip archive (to be able to work with self-extracting zip archives, I suppose). iTunes installer is not a zip archive - that is why the operation fails.\nAs root45 has noted, Ubuntu does not support running Windows .exe files directly - you need to install Wine to run the application directly in Ubuntu or use VirtualBox with a Windows copy running in a virtual machine.\nIf you sill sure you want to run that file - try saving it to disk first (select \"Save as\" instead of \"Open\" when Firefox asks you, or right-click on the link and select \"save taget as\" instead of just clicking. \nActually, looking at your error message, I think that the file may be already downloaded to a folder called \"untitled-folder\" on your desktop.\n\nA: If you want to open it, first write in a terminal.\nsudo apt-get install wine1.2\n\nafter that you can open it by doing double click, or by terminal, whatever you want.\nHowever I prefer to use virtualbox-ose, but first you need a windows ISO or CD.

However, I am having troubles with ekiga and upon looking them up it sounds like it is a NAT problem. Since I have control of both clients, I figured IPv6 would be much easier because I wouldn't have to worry about NAT. However, it sounds like Ekiga doesn't support IPv6. Is there a SIP client that supports IPv6 and is FOSS that runs on Ubuntu?\n\nA: Ekiga isn't a client as such, but a provider. Think of them as the sip equivalent of Gmail.  I think that any sip call has to go via a provider.   So you want to find a provider that supports ipv6. I would guess that most of them do. These would all be paid services, but for calls to sip addresses with the same domain you might not have to pay anything.\n\nA: Empathy is installed by default and supports SIP. You'll need to install http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/telepathy-sofiasip. \n\nA: Linphone (at least the version in 12.04) supports IPv6 or IPv4 (I don't think it does both at the same time).\nIf you go into the settings (Linphone > Preferences) and go to the Network Settings tab, there is a use IPv6 instead of IPv4 tab.\nI tested doing a call directly between clients using an IPv6 address, and it worked.\nLike daithib8's answer states, finding an IPv6 proxy/registrar (what he calls a provider) is another issue separate from what client you use. \n", "Q: How do I restore the old look of Ubuntu 10.10? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I switch to the Classic GNOME Desktop? \n\nWhere I can restore the old look of Ubuntu 10, or get back the \"start\" panel? the new left sidebar is beauiful , but kinda hard to get quick access to applications cause i need to search every time the app name\n\nA: *\n\n*Log out\n\n*Choose \"Ubuntu Classic\" from the session menu (at the bottom)\n\n*Log in\n\n", "Q: Can I safely remove all the files in /tmp?

Though my /etc/defautl/rcS indicates TMPTIME=0?\n\nA: In Unix, deleting a file removes a reference to it from its parent directory (this actually is called \"unlinking\"). \nThe actual file data is only deleted when it's not referenced from any directory (a file can have multiple so-called hardlinks) and it's not open by any program. \nSo yes, deleting files from /tmp should not crash programs which potentially keep those files open.

I have a folder of png files that have transparent backgrounds. I would like to convert them from the command line and maintain the images' transparent backgrounds. \nI'd appreciate any help. \nSince jpgs don't support transparency so how can I specify the output jpg's background color's hex value? Right now it defaults to #ffffff? I have tried this script, but it gives the output jpgs white backgrounds:\nmogrify -quality 100 -format jpg *.png\n\nUpdate\nI created these png files in inkscape. I should mention that my goal in converting these pngs to jpgs is to get rid of jagged edges on circular or angular objects. The pngs currently have jagged edges and I read that converting them to jpgs might solve this problem. However converting via the method outlined in Christian Skjødt's answer gives the images even worse jagged edges. Is there a way that I can convert the pngs to jpg and also use anti-aliasing or maybe another technique to get rid of the jagged edges? Thanks for the help. \n\nA: I'm sorry there is no way, jpeg format doesn't support an alpha channel so you can't have transparency.\n\nA: To smooth the edges you could create the PNGs 10x larger than your target size, then resize with anti-aliasing to JPG. I have done this using Python and the Python Imaging Library to good effect, but I'm not sure how to do it using other tools.\n\nA: The JPEG format does not support transparency -- therefore maintaining the transparent backgrounds is not possible if you want to (or have to) use the JPEG format. See Wikipedia for an overview of the capabilities of different image formats.\nNote that the JPEG 2000 does indeed support transparency, but it is much less common than the JPEG format. It depends on your use case whether this is a viable alternative.\n\nA: To your second question: \nTo specify the background color when converting your images you can use the -fill option:\nmogrify -quality 100 -format jpg -fill \"#FF0000\" -opaque none *.png\n\nUsing -background provides similar results.

At the moment, as standard, double-finger-tapping right clicks, and tripple-finger-tapping middle clicks ... I would like to switch these two actions, while retaining the two-finger scrolling.\nThis makes sense to me because I use middle click a lot, and also middle clicking with two fingers correlates with scrolling with two fingers (on a traditional mouse, scrolling is done with the middle wheel).\n\nA: Try:\n synclient TapButton2=3 {Two Finger tap}\n synclient TapButton3=2 {Three finger tap}\n\nOr just change the numbers to 2 and 3 as I don't know what default numbers are applied by ubuntu, to see what supports your need.

My desktop is currently working in headless mode. There isn't an X server and because it's all configured up for Nvidia, forwarding isn't working (missing NV extensions, etc).\nI need to log into my online bank account but the only place that has the account number is Firefox on my desktop! It has saved it to the field and now I need to extract it somehow.\nDoes anybody know of what I'd need to get into it? Desperate times. \n\nA: One option (that I'm holding back from) is copying the whole profile out to this laptop and replacing the current one (after backing it up) and using it just like that.\nI can't see why it wouldn't work but I've had some weird things happen when moving profiles around in Firefox before, hence me looking for a cleaner, remote option.\n\nA: Firefox form auto-completion database is a SQLite file. You'll need to install sqlite3 in order to access such databases. After doing that, you can run a SQL query against the database (replace PROFILE.NAME accordingly):\nsqlite3 -header -column ~/.mozilla/firefox/PROFILE.NAME/formhistory.sqlite 'SELECT fieldname, value FROM moz_formhistory'\n\nYou can limit the search to values containing \"123\" by appending WHERE value LIKE \"%123%\" after moz_form_history.\nThe password database gets more tricky as the contents of it are encrypted and therefore it's easier to start Firefox using the copied profile folder. Copy ~/.mozilla/firefox/PROFILE.NAME from the remote side to the local side in ~/tmp-ff-prof (tar + scp + tar). Then, run:\nfirefox -no-remote -profile ~/tmp-ff-prof &\n\n-no-remote takes away the need for closing all Firefox instances.\nYou might also be interested in Firefox Sync which allows you to share your passwords between profiles.\n", "Q: \"mountall main process executable changed\" causing long boot times I am desperately trying to improve my machine's boot time but I cannot succeed.

It just stopped responding.\nOn top of it all, I was repulsed by the way Ubuntu looked on my monitor. On Windows, when you have a larger monitor, it just expands everything.

Any way to fix it?\n\nA: Your problem is coming from the fact that while intel supports Linux well, they don't do the same with resolution on Linux (I know from experience). It is frustrating but I'm not sure if you can work around it. Possibly adding something to the xorg.conf file to set a custom resolution could do it, but in the past I've had rather mixed results (sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't).\nYour best bet (may) be to use the latest Ubuntu version when it's available (11.04 is out now, but 11.10 will be here soon). Newer drivers might_just_work with a higher resolution.\nOn your 12\" system you won't have that problem btw.\n", "Q: Blank page when trying to access phpmyadmin I would like to access phpmyadmin.

If it can't fix it, then you're out of luck.  You can try to wipe the whole disk and start over, and the disk may turn out to be ok, or you may need to replace it.  Start by zeroing out the whole disk ( assuming it is sda ):\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda\n\nIf that completes without errors, check the SMART stats in the disk utility again.  The pending and offline_uncorrectable counts should be zero.  If the reallocated sector count is still zero, then the drive is fine, and you can format it and continue to use it.  If the reallocated count has gone up, then the drive has some physical damage that may grow worse over time.  If it is under warranty, have it replaced.  If not, then run the long smart self test once a week or so to make sure no additional bad sectors develop.  If more bad sectors do pop up, then you will want to replace the drive.\n", "Q: RT3090 random disconnects on wifi?

(this includes purple or black screen, flashing cursor, stuck at splash screen...)\n\n*No grub menu? \n\n\nThe post contains a pretty exhaustive list of keyboard shortcuts to help diagnose graphics problems on Linux systems, e.g.\n\nCtrlAltF1\nSwitch to the first text terminal. Under Linux you can have several (6 in standard setup) terminals opened at the same time. Terminals start as tty0 and go up from there.

Going this way, you will have more of a chance to be able to toggle between a graphical session or text terminal session (sometimes). At a text console, at least you have the ability to install files and make changes to config files, and if you can get back into a command prompt, you could then stop the gdm service that is locked.\n\n\nYou can stop the gdm service via\nsudo service gdm stop\nThere's even a table of contents post that can help find the post in the thread that might help your particular situation. \nAgain, this all comes from a thread at the Ubuntu Forums.\n", "Q: How to make sure apt-get has the latest version of Software How to make sure apt-get has the latest version of application or software; I tried installing monit but the latest version that I got was 1.5 from apt-get but the site http://mmonit.com/monit/ has totally different version ie., Monit 5.2.5.  \n sudo apt-cache search monit\n sudo apt-get update\n sudo apt-get install monit  << gives 1.5 version \n\nDo I need to add the latest ppa/deb in apt-add-repository before installing.

Now that I can finally enjoy my VMWare Workstation 6.5.5 on Ubuntu 10.04, I noticed that it feels significantly faster and snappier than when it is running on Ubuntu 8.04 (same exact machine, dual boot).\nIs this my subjective imagination or can this be backed by known benchmarks?\n\nA: I can't answer about specific vmware benchmarks - but a strong possibility is better graphics drivers with 10.04 compared to 8.04.\nYou may have been having 3D graphics issues with 8.04 - this is likely to have improved under lucid and thus the full 3D graphics capabilities in Workstation 6.5 would now be available.\nIn addition - if you did a new 10.04 install with a ext4 filesystem you will have noticed a better disk-throughput compared to the ext3 filesystem in 8.04.  This was discussed and benchmarked by Phoronix when comparing KVM benchmarks from 8.04 through to 10.10.\nWithout knowing what hardware you have, its a little difficult to give you specifics.\n", "Q: Developing Unity compliant apps in Python - where to start? I'm an experienced programmer who is interested in developing apps for Linux, specifically GTK, and more specifically apps that are Unity compliant. Aside from the obvious step of learning Python, what's the best way to learn things like:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to develop a GUI interface (probably using Glade)? Are there any good Glade2 tutorials?\n\n*Where are the Unity specific API calls? (such as putting a notification icon on the top panel, and using \"badges\" on the launch icons (a la Unity Mail's message count).\n\n\nAlso, are there any good Python IDEs that are similar to Xcode or Visual Studio, where you can design your interface, and then double click on buttons and widgets to tie code to them?\nThanks for any help.\n\nA: There is a list of APIs available here:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/\n\nA: Good question. \nFirst of all, the appindicators are not Unity specific in any way. Actually, they run just as well on Xfce or KDE. It's very, very, simple to use. You'll create an indicator object, set the name of icons to use when it needs attention, etc, and simply attach menus to it. The indicators are then sent over dbus and properly displayed in a manner suitable for the current desktop environment. In Unity, Gnome Shell, Xfce and LXDE, it'll be displayed as GTK menus, and in KDE it'll be displayed as Qt menus, etc. Very neat. You can find more information about it here: http://unity.ubuntu.com/projects/appindicators/\nIn the right pane of Glade, you have a Signals page under Properties. Here you can simply type the name of the method to use as handler for that signal. In your code, you'll just create a gtk.Builder object, load the XML that Glade produces and use the gtk.Builder.connect_signals method to connect all your signals to their methods. This means you can use Glade interfaces in almost any programming language. Since that is so easy, and since languages are different by nature, it makes little sense to add coding to Glade itself. For coding Python (and other languages), I will recommend having a look at Geany ( http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/geany). It is a very good editor/IDE. \nOther things in Unity are so new, there is little documentation, except as code examples. Some of the APIs are just now becoming stable, such as for Scopes and Lenses, which weren't even called that a little while ago. As a beginner, I'd wait a little bit before looking into those things. \nThe entries on the launcher, are actually just referred to as LauncherEntry in code, and it can use a progress bar, a counter and QuickLists. I haven't actually coded that myself, but this page has an example and it seems very easy, like the rest of the Unity APIs: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~unity-team/libunity/trunk/view/head:/examples/launcher.py\n", "Q: Accessing .VDI Image from Ubuntu VirtualBox I have Ubuntu 11.04 installed in VirtualBox 4.0.10 on a Windows Vista Home Premium \n32-bit host.

I also posted this on ubuntuforums.\n\nEdit:\nThere is at least one other program besides NetworkManager that's writing to resolv.conf, and I know this because when I refresh NetworkManager, the resolv.conf file that gets generated has a comment that says # Generated by NetworkManager, and the version that it keeps changing to does not.\nSo I am trying this:\nwhile true; do echo listening; lsof | grep /etc/resolv.conf; echo sleeping; sleep 1; done\n\nEdit 2:\nAdding output of files:\n$ cat /etc/network/interfaces \nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nNo such file as /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n$ sudo cat /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/Auto\\ Ethernet \n\n[connection]\nid=Auto Ethernet\nuuid=#######omitted#######\ntype=802-3-ethernet\nautoconnect=true\ntimestamp=1314377063\n\n[ipv4]\nmethod=auto\nignore-auto-routes=false\nignore-auto-dns=false\ndhcp-send-hostname=false\nnever-default=false\n\n[802-3-ethernet]\nspeed=0\nduplex=full\nauto-negotiate=true\nmtu=0\n\n[ipv6]\nmethod=ignore\nignore-auto-routes=false\nignore-auto-dns=false\nnever-default=false\n\n\nA: I had the exact same problem - resolv.conf would be rewritten every time the server was rebooted.\nIt was caused by DHCP. To set resolv.conf to what I want it to be, I edited /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf and added the following:\nsupersede domain-name \"my.domain.com\";\nprepend domain-search \"my.domain.com\";\n\nYou can actually control quite a bit about your resolv.conf file by making changes to this.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: Open up a terminal and type \nsudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf\n\nthe  +i takes care that the file wont be reseted on a boot even by root.\nTo undo the above \nsudo chattr -i /etc/resolv.conf\n\nFor more \nman chattr\n\n\nA: I disable the update of resolv.conf by creating a file called disable_make_resolv_conf in /etc/dhcp3/dhclient-enter-hooks.d\n#!/bin/sh\nmake_resolv_conf(){\n}\n\nIt replaces the standard function by the same name that's responsible for the resolv.conf refresh.\n\nA: Another option that I've had some luck with involves using resolvconf.\nAdd any entries to this file:\n/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base\n\nAnd they will be added to the /etc/resolv.conf.\nThanks to this Ask Ubuntu posting: How do I include lines in resolv.conf that won't get lost on reboot?\n\nA: You can make static additions to /etc/resolv.conf. Those additions could override the things that are being automatically added. \nFirst, install the resolvconf package.\nThen, press Alt+F2 and run gksudo nautilus. Open /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head if you want to add to the start of the file; open /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail if you want to add to the end. Make your changes, save/close the files, and then run sudo resolvconf -u to apply the changes. \n(Sorry that I don't remember if the settings at the start or end of the file have the highest priority.)\n\nA: (This answer contains ways to investigate what's going on. I may be able to give an actual solution if you use these methods to gather and provide more information.)\nA possible trigger for the seemingly spontaneous updates to /etc/resolv.conf is when your DHCP lease is renewed. Check how long you get DHCP leases for (this should appear in the system logs, I think in /var/log/syslog).\nYou can use auditd  to find out what modifies the file. Start the daemon (sudo service auditd start) and tell it to watch for modifications to that file:\nsudo auditctl -w /etc/resolv.conf -p w\n\nAudit logs are in /var/log/audit/audit.log. You'll see the time the file was modified and the name of the program that modified it.\nIf you have the resolvconf package installed, Network Manager may be stepping on its toes. Try bringing all network interfaces down, then stop Network Manager (sudo service network-manager stop), then restart it.\n\nA: Late at this but I will post my case as it was different from all of the above.\nIn my case, /etc/resolv.conf is a symlink to /var/run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf, and for some reason cat /etc/resolv.conf gives me error no such file or directory (maybe because it's empty?)\nIf I open it with vi and add nameserver x.x.x.x it works, but is cleared on reboot.\nI tried to edit /etc/network/interfaces and add dns-nameservers x.x.x.x, changed /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf and removed under request domain-name-servers, also edited prepend domain-name-servers x.x.x.x.\nResolvconf binary is not installed, NetworkManager.conf didn't have anything relevant. But everytime I restarted the machine, there was no domain server.\nI'm not sure what the reason is but it seems to have to do with the fact that this is a VBox machine, started by GNS3 and because of that inside VBox setting, I have to leave it with no interface created. Apparently GNS3 creates a \"UDP interface\" on the fly when I start the machine, provided that I start it from GNS3.\nSo, to save me from searching endlessly, I just added echo nameserver x.x.x.x> /etc/resolv.conf to /etc/profile, problem solved (not solved, but worked around hehe). But it could be interesting to know what goes on with that scenario if anyone ran into it.\n\nA: If you have the file /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\ncat /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nyou can configure NetworkManager to stop resetting resolv.conf with\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"\n[main]\ndns=none\n\" >> /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf'\ncat /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nNow manually change your /etc/resolv.conf and test its permanence with\nsudo systemctl restart NetworkManager\n# sudo service network-manager restart\ncat /etc/resolv.conf\n\nSource: https://askubuntu.com/a/623956/452398\n\nA: Just make entries in your ifcfg-ethX files like so\nDNS1=192.168.X.X\nDNS2=192.168.X.X\nDOMAIN=yourdomain.com\nthen network manager will post pend those records to the resolv.conf file after you restart the services or restart your box.\n\nA: Just in case someone falls in the same case:\nI Forgot I set dhcp on an interface inside the file /etc/network/interfaces\nNetworkmanager will modify /etc/resolv.conf from the dhcp answer he gets.\nhth\n\nA: When there is # Generated by NetworkManager in /etc/resolv.conf\nEdit Network Manager config:\nsudo vim /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nin [main] section add rc-manager=unmanaged:\n[main]                                                                                                                                   \nrc-manager=unmanaged\n\nWhy? \n\nrc-manager -\n  Set the resolv.conf management mode.

So all my folders are synced into the cloud, but no file is available for offline use as the option is missing. Ticking every single file to download them is not a appropriate solution, because it takes long times to \"sync\" 100+ files manually. Besides of that changes have to be \"resynced\" manually as well. To cut a long story shot: Where is the \"sync locally\" option in this app? And supposingly there isn't such an option: what is your workaround for this?\nGreetz\nrodgerwilco\n\nA: There is no \"sync locally\" or \"sync folder\" option on the android UbuntuOne Files app. Should be a high priority feature add, in my book. UbuntuOne does the automatic photo upload quite well. It just needs a way to do the same for other user-selected SDCARD folders.  Seems silly that you have to add files individually rather than entire folders, like you can with UbuntuOne on Linux/Ubuntu or various cloud storage apps for Windows.\n\nA: The app FolderSync in the Android Market claims it can do it. Try it out: marketlink\n\nA: You can long-press on a folder to download all files inside it: you do not have to download each one individually. This does not keep those files in sync (that is: further changes to those files in the cloud need to be manually downloaded again) but it's a lot quicker than downloading each file individually. \n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on a Macbook Pro using EFI instead of rEFIt or similar I installed Ubuntu on my macbook pro (8,1) a few months back using the rEFIt method (so it's an emulated BIOS). I want to give EFI mode a try. Unfortunately I have not found a clear guide on where to begin. I have read through scattered forum posts with hints about patches needed in the kernel and things like that, but I haven't seen any comprehensive guide.\nI have seen this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MactelSupportTeam/AppleIntelInstallation#Single-Boot:%20Ubuntu%20Only\nThat appears to be what I'm looking for. If it is, then my question is this: Is there a way to do EFI and maintain a dual boot environment? The dual boot guides on the same page require rEFIt. If that's not what I think it is, where can I find info on how to install with this method?\n\nA: I have a Macbook Pro 8,2 and when booting EFI mode instead of with CSM (BIOS), video is completely unusuable, even text only boot has a totally scrambled screen. I haven't found a work around for this yet, so I'm depending on the CSM.\nAs for rEFIt, it doesn't necessarily require CSM. It's just adept at finding various bootloaders for linux and Windows and Mac OS and presenting them to the user. Those bootloaders can use EFI mode, or may depend on BIOS which on EFI systems means the use of a CSM to \"emulate\" BIOS. I found rEFIt to be a little confusing as to what's going on and showed numerous options for booting only two of which would work. So I just restored to Apple's EFI startup disk selection menu using option key at startup.\nWhat I've learned so far is that Apple's startup disk menu (option key @ startup) will produce a hard disk icon labeled \"Windows\" if the follow three things are true about that hard drive: it contains a hybrid MBR rather than a pure GPT, one of the partitions in the MBR has the boot flag set and it doesn't matter which one as long as it is not the protective MBR entry, the first 440 bytes of the disk (LBA 0) contains bootloader code.\nIn this case, you get a Windows labeled hard disk icon when using option key at startup and when choosing this option it basically means boot into Grub2. From there you can choose whatever your Grub2 configuration has found which could be one or more Linux and Windows installations on that disk.\n\nA: I don't have a Macbook myself, but while looking for a way to install Ubuntu on my uefi notebook I stumbled upon this nice little guide below. After the rEFIt step, there are more steps to enable Uefi. I hope it helps!\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/ubuntu-efi/index.html\n\nA: I have a MacBook Pro 8,2 with ubuntu 12.04 and I got efi booting to work.  I can get text mode to work,  but i haven't been able to get a gui running.  The screen that asks if you want to run ubuntu in low graphics mode comes up, but when you choose anything, it freezes and you have to force the computer off.  Its a problem with the dual graphics.  And vga switcheroo isn't working at all.  \nIf i start 'failsafe x'  from recovery mode,  it still doesn't start.  'screens found but none have usable configuration' \nI've gotten it close to working by using the opensource drivers. (no fglrx)  Adding 'blacklist radeon'  to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist  And adding 'modprobe radeon'  to /etc/rc.local.  When i do this, the ubuntu splash shows up after grub-efi boots the kernel,  and then the login drums play as if LightDM is running.  \nInstalling apple_gmux didn't help at all.  \nIf you use refit,  you should see two entries for Ubuntu.  One for grub-efi and another for the normal boot.   \n\nA: I have 2011 (I think it's early 2011) Macbook Pro 8.2.\nI'd had a lot of grief until yesterday, when I finally tried to install Ubuntu from the \"normal\" Ubuntu 12.04 (ubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64.iso) instead of the MAC version (ubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64+mac.iso).\nThe latter gives you rEFI (emulated bios) - you actually cannot get EFI from the MAC version iso, as it only supports the BIOS booting (sic!). How misleading!\nI used the \"normal\" iso after I put an new, empty SSD drive to my MBP 8.2 and in installed in EFI mode and everything (with the exception of the wifi firmware which needs to be downloaded) has been working without any problems since.\n\nA: I have an MacBook Pro 15\" (2010) and i am able to dual boot with EFI. Try using Ubuntu 12.04 and follow the guide on this Wiki Page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFIBooting.\nNote: I have removed my windows installation to do this.

I'm running Ubuntu 11.04. I use the terminal to start a bash session, and I want to add an environment variable:\n$r@hajt:~$ env THEVAR=/example\n\nBut it's not working. It shows all the variables with THEVAR being the last one, but another call to env does not show THEVAR anymore- env | grep THEVAR returns nothing.\nSimilarly, scripts with export (export THEVAR=/example) or other variable assignments (THEVAR=/example) don't add the environment variable.\nI know I'm doing something wrong, I know it should be something simple, but I just can't find what.\nUPDATE:\nThe real meaning of my question was this one:\n\n*\n\n*Can a shell script set environment variables of the calling shell? \n(Anyway I'll choose the most voted answer and leave the edited title -that wasn't what I was asking)\nenv runs a program in a modified environment, then dismisses all the changes.\n\nA: To set variable only for current shell:\nVARNAME=\"my value\"\n\nTo set it for current shell and all processes started from current shell:\nexport VARNAME=\"my value\"      # shorter, less portable version\n\nTo set it permanently for all future bash sessions add such line to your .bashrc file in your $HOME directory.\nTo set it permanently, and system wide (all users, all processes) add set variable in  /etc/environment:\nsudo -H gedit /etc/environment\n\nThis file only accepts variable assignments like:\nVARNAME=\"my value\"\n\nDo not use the export keyword here.\nYou need to logout from current user and login again so environment variables changes take place.\n\nA: If you are doing things via script, one easy way to set environment variable permanently is put below statement in your script,\nif [[ ! -d \"$MyVar\" ]]; then \n    export MyVar=\"abc\"\n    echo 'export MyVar=\"abc\"' >> ~/.bashrc\nfi\n\nIf you need to evaluage expressions like pwd, you can use this, for example,\necho \"export EIGEN_ROOT=\\\"$(pwd)/eigen\\\"\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\n\nA: To set an environment variable once, use the export command in the prompt, not in a shell script:\n$ export THEVAR=/example\n\nThe variable will be set for the rest of the shell session or until unset.\nTo set an environment variable everytime, use the export command in the .bashrc file (or the appropriate initialization file for your shell).\nTo set an environment variable from a script, use the export command in the script, and then source the script. If you execute the script it will not work.\nFor an explanation of the difference between sourcing and executing see this answer:\n\n*\n\n*What is the difference between executing a Bash script vs sourcing it?\n\nA: If you are using Ubuntu or any Unix-based system then export the variables in the ~/.bashrc file. It's a hidden file and you can get there through the terminal or by unhiding hidden files in the file system.\nThen edit the file and set export THEVAR=/example there, save and it's done.\n\nA: To permanently add a new environment variable in Ubuntu (tested only in 14.04), use the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal (by pressing CtrlAltT)\n\n*sudo -H gedit /etc/environment\n\n*Type your password\n\n*Edit the text file just opened:\ne.g. if you want to add FOO=bar, then just write FOO=bar in a new line\n\n*Save it\n\n*Once saved, logout and login again. \n\n*Your required changes are made.\n\n\nA: If you are deploying JAVA aplication using TOMCAT you can set environment variables the following way:\n1.sudo su and cd to /var/lib/tomcat8/bin/ (or whichever is your tomcat bin path)\n\n\n*touch setenv.sh(if it doesn't exist), if file present already do 'vi setenv.sh'\n\n\n*chmod 777 setenv.sh (make file executable)\n\n\n*vi setenv.sh and set following line in setenv.sh\nexport key=value\n\n\n*sudo systemctl restart tomcat.service\nIn your java file you can use the following code to check if the variable is set\nprivate static void printEnv() {\n    System.out.println(\"******************************Environment Vars*****************************\");\n    Map<String, String> enviorntmentVars = System.getenv();\n    enviorntmentVars.entrySet().forEach(System.out::println);\n\n    System.out.println(\"******************************system Vars*****************************\");\n    Properties enviorntmentProperties = System.getProperties();\n    enviorntmentVars.entrySet().forEach(System.out::println);\n}\n\n\nA: To get the environment/var changes to persist after the script has completed, you have to usesource ./script.sh or the shorthand notation for source, \".\", like . ./script.sh\nSource will execute the commands in the script as if you have typed them in... so it does change some aspects of the script, such as exiting... so if your script checks something and decides to exit if false, for instance, via calling exit 0, it will terminate your current terminal / shell session.\n\nA: I know it's pretty late, but if you want to add an environment variable for all users (e.g. JAVA usage) - you can do the following:\n1) Open /etc/bash.bashrc using nano (you can use whatever editor, I do not prefer VIM as it's the worst when it comes to user friendliness - nothing personal).\n2) Append to the file:\nexport VAR=path\n export PATH=$PATH:/bin\n\n3) (Better if you can bounce the box) - or simply open a new SSH session and confirm using `env' command.\nBUT IF you want each user to have a separate setting for this, you have to make a change (scripted) to .bashrc file under ~/.bashrc (or /home/$USER/ if you are new to Linux systems)\n", "Q: Why does my default sound output change when I reboot? I have a media center computer that was working fine.

Since I have my TV plugged into the HDMI port, when the HDMI option is selected, everything works great.

At the Office 365 launch, Gordon Frazer, managing director of Microsoft UK, gave the first admission that cloud data — regardless of where it is in the world — is not protected against the USA PATRIOT Act.\nThe same goes for data stored in the Ubuntu One cloud?\nhttp://blog.ucilia.com/index.php/cloud-technology-cloud-servers-cloud-telephony-news/60-how-safe-are-eu-based-cloud-data.html\n\nA: According to the US, if a company is registered in the US, all data they hold anywhere in the world is fair game. So this includes all servers used by Microsoft, Amazon and Google anywhere in the world according to the US. And in the last few days there has been another example of this:\n\"Google is the next major company to admit Patriot Act issues, as it admits to handing over data held in a European datacenter back to U.S. intelligence.\" ZDNET, August 11, 2011 \nI am not a lawyer and not related to Ubuntu One/Canonical and not a lot of users here are legal experts with knowledge about this situation so an answer to your question will all be conjecture. And it also depends on how stubborn the EU is about enforcing own law and opposing the US Patriot Act.\nUbuntu One Terms of Services\n\nThis agreement is governed by the laws of England and any dispute will be heard by the courts in England. Failure by Canonical to enforce any right or provision of this agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any part of this agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the partie's original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. The terms of this agreement do not affect your statutory rights. \n\nUbuntu One is based in the UK so the company is subject to the EU laws and the European Data Protection Directive. So the answer to your question should be no Ubuntu one is not affected by this if you store the data on a EU server\nIf you want to make sure before you start using Ubuntu One that your data will not be handed over to the US you can contact them yourself and get an official responce (from Ubuntu privacy policy):\n\nPlease submit any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, or about our use of your personally identifiable information to our account assistance form at /help/contact/ or by postal mail at the following address: Canonical Group Ltd, 27th Floor Millbank Tower, 21-24 Millbank, London, England, SW1Q 4QP.\n\nAny data stored on a cloud worth protecting should be encrypted. Might not stop the US from getting it and also might not stop the US from decrypting it but it should be made as problematic as possible ;-)\n\nA: It is never safe to assume that anything you place in a public cloud is kept private, even if the service provider has the best of intentions. You should always err on the side of caution. Canonical might be based in the UK and therefore not affected by the US laws, but does anything prevent them from using another cloud as an extension of their own service? Because if they did that and the other cloud is US based, then it'd still be subject to US law. \nIf you use the cloud for personal stuff, then you must make sure to encrypt it. You must not make assumptions when it comes to privacy. And even Canonical is not immune to disloyal employees. \n\nA: Yes, no matter the current laws or terms of service you need to think carefully about what you store this way.  Laws and TOS can be changed quickly and easily.  Companies can come under a lot of pressure to hand over information, and they will hang you out to dry as soon as look at you if it might affect their bottom line to withold or protect information. Regardless of protection laws.\nAs example, witness the big credit card companies illegally blocking payments to Wikileaks - it seems the law is actually only for you and me to adhere to.\n\nA: UbuntuOne relys on Amazon S3 as backend, therefore the data is eventually stored in the US and can of course be subjected to Patriot Act law enforcement!\n\nA: Data may not end up in the US, assuming Ubuntu One have specified the EU.\nQuote from Amazon website re S3.\n\"Objects stored in a Region never leave the Region unless you transfer them out.

Inside this pictures folders, there was a hidden folder called .trash-info or .trashinfo. Inside this folder were two sub-folders, called \"info\" and \"files\". the files folder contained the file, which seemed to be synchronized on and on. \n(I think the .trash-info folder was created by moving some pictures in the trash in shotwell.)\nSo I deleted the .trash-info folder.

I'd prefer my hostname to be hidden (or a fake hostname to be shown - both variants are interesting actually) from my network peers (including routers ad DHCP servers). \nI believe my IP and MAC addresses are enough for them to know. How to achieve this in Ubuntu?\nIn practice I've seen SOHO wireless routers to detect client's (clientside-set) hostnames showing them on their DHCP lease tables. Not sure if this works with Ubuntu, but with Windows I'm pretty sure. I'd like to avoid this in all the OSes I use, Ubuntu being the main of them.\n\nA: That's probably the most excentric question I've read on AskUbuntu so far. You can connect to a computer on your network by using hostname.local instead of using the IP address. I don't understand why anyone would want to hide that. You can easily change it, though, if you don't like the default of using the username in the hostname. That is understandable. \nJust edit /etc/hostname to the hostname you like and then edit /etc/hosts to reflect that change. You need to reboot afterwards. \n\nA: The only reason to have an host name, is, to use it from the net. On the host itself, you rarely need the hostname. \nIf you want the others to use a different hostname, choose a different hostname. \nWhile the idea of a soul as a stealable thing is nonsense, the idea to be dependent on knowing the name is super nonsense.  And a computer having a soul is meganonsense; believe me! \n", "Q: Can I remove the mounted drives launcher icons in Unity 2D?

If you want files to appear there by default, just add them to /etc/skel. That goes for default configurations as well, so you can make a prototype user and copy that users home directory onto /etc/skel. Automatic setup of email accounts, etc, will require some scripting, but doesn't necessarily need to be very complicated. If you wanted to provide default web feeds for Liferea, you'd add the feeds to the prototype user and then simply copy the ~/.liferea_1.6 folder to /etc/skel/.liferea_1.6 and it would just work. \nSome applications doesn't work like this.

Im a new Ubuntu user, well new to Unix actually even if usually work with MacOS I had never really looked into it.\nI installed Ubuntu on my laptop a few days ago and so far everything was going well, until all of a sudden the trackpad stopped responding.

All hidden directories were still in the zip-file.\n\nA: The correct method would be:\nzip -r zipfile.zip directory -x directory/.*\n\n\nA: While zipping dirs excluding some file extension:\n$ cd /path/to/dir\n$ zip -r dir.zip . -x \"*.log\" -x \"*.cache\"\n\n\nA: Without hidden folders and files in directory:\nzip -r zipfile.zip directory/*\n\ndirectory:\n|── .git\n│   \n├── src\n│   └── Work.file\n├── .test\n│   └── .file\n└── test.file\n\n$ zip -r zipfile.zip directory/*\nadding: directory/src/ (stored 0%)\nadding: directory/src/Work.file (stored 0%)\nadding: directory/test.file (stored 0%)\n\n\nA: Add \" to the .* (otherwise, your shell expands .* to the dot files in the current directory), and also exclude hidden files in subdirectories:\nzip -r zipfile.zip . -x \".*\" -x \"*/.*\"\n\nThis will result in files starting with a . not to be added into your zip file.\nrinzwind@discworld:~/tmp$ ls -la\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 rinzwind rinzwind 4096 2011-08-28 00:15 tmp\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 rinzwind rinzwind 4096 2011-08-28 00:15 .tmp\nrinzwind@discworld:~/tmp$ zip -r zipfile.zip . -x .*\nadding: .tmp/ (stored 0%)\nadding: tmp/ (stored 0%)\nrinzwind@discworld:~/tmp$ zip -r zipfile.zip . -x \".*\" -x \"*/.*\"\nupdating: tmp/ (stored 0%)\n\n\nA: First of all if you don't have installed zip install it first as follows:\nsudo apt-get install zip\n\nThen for simply creating a zip file:\nzip -r compressed_filename.zip foldername\n\nIf you want to exclude hidden files:\nfind /folder_path -path '*/.*' -prune -o -type f -print | zip ~/compressed_filename.zip -@\n\nExcluding Files from a Zip Archive\n(taken from http://osxdaily.com/2013/04/30/how-to-exclude-files-from-a-zip-archive/)\n\nThe basics of file exclusion when creating a zip archive are centered\n  around the -x flag, which is used to exclude files from the archive\n  that match a specific name or pattern. At it’s most basic, it will\n  look like this:\nzip archive.zip files -x \"ExcludeMe\"\n\nMeaning you could exclude a single file, say it’s named “Nothanks.jpg”\nzip archive.zip images/ -x \"Nothanks.jpg\"\n\nLet’s cover a few specific examples where this is useful.\nExclude .DS_Store Files from Zip Archives\nThis will prevent the typically invisible Mac metadata .DS_Store\n  files from being included in a zip archive, which are bundled in by\n  default:\nzip -r archivename.zip archivedirectory -x \"*.DS_Store\"\n\nIf the directory includes subdirectories however, you’ll want to use\n  another variation of that command to exclude the the ds_store files\n  from subdirectories as well:\nzip -r archive.zip directory -x \"*/\\.DS_Store\"\n\nNote: not all shells require the quotations for this command to work\n  properly, but in the bash shell (the default for OS X) you will need\n  to use the quotes for excluding with wildcards and patterns.\nExclude Specific File Types from a Zip Archive\nWith wildcards, you can also exclude all files of a certain type by\n  focusing on the extension. For example, this command will zip an\n  entire directory, minus any .jpg files:\nzip -r archive.zip directory -x \"*.jpg\"\n\nThat could be modified for any specific file extension or pattern\n  matched in a file name.\nExclude the .git or .svn Directory from a Zip Archive\nZip a directory, minus .git and it’s contents:\nzip -r zipdir.zip directorytozip -x \"*.git*\"\n\nZip a folder, without including the .svn directory:\nzip -r zipped.zip directory -x \"*.svn*\"\n\nExclude All Hidden Files from a Zip Archive\nSince patterns and wildcards can be used, you could also exclude any\n  or all invisible files and folders that are made so by being prefixed\n  with a period, whether it’s a directory like .svn or an individual\n  file like .bash_profile or .htaccess.\nzip -r archivename.zip directorytozip -x \"*.*\"\n\nOr to exclude all invisible files from all subdirectories:\nzip -r archive.zip directory -x \"*/\\.*\"\n\n\n\nA: This also excludes hidden files in unhidden directories:\nfind /full_path -path '*/.*' -prune -o -type f -print | zip ~/file.zip -@\n\n\nA: Example for excluding all folders begining with . :\ntar cvpzf folder.tgz folder/ --exclude '.*'\n\nBetter compress but slower :\ntar cvpjf folder.tar.bz2 folder/ --exclude '.*'\n\n\nA: This one includes all \".\" directories, subdirectories, and \".\" files or directories within directories...\nEssentially the first answer but includes top level \".\" files. \nfind /full_path -path '*.*/.*' -prune -o -type f -print | zip ~/file.zip -@\n\n", "Q: Compiz widget layer interferes with libnotify notifications I use the Compiz Widget Layer plugin so as to have a fullscreen Terminator window a keystroke away. The only issue I have is, when I'm in the Widget Layer, notifications don't appear, so I don't come to know when someone sends me an IM in Pidgin. Does anyone have a solution that can make libnotify notifications appear in the Widget Layer?\n\nA: I found that libnotify is designed in such a way as to not disturb users when they're using a fullscreen application, and that does make sense from a design point of view. So instead of using Terminator fullscreen, I got rid of its titlebar using the \"Window Rules\" plugin. This way it looks like it's fullscreen, and I also receive notifications properly.\n\nA: I have a possible solution, but I have not tested it so you will have to comment and tell me if it works.\nAdd (title=notify-osd) to your Widget Layer match option as follows:\n\nIn light of your comment (that this does not seem to work), I suggest reporting a bug against compiz. (ubuntu-bug compiz).\n", "Q: What do I do when bad sectors are reported? Ubuntu says I have bad sectors on my laptop (186 of them to be exact) and sometimes can't even boot - I'm running a live CD now. Is it the end for my HD?\nIf yes, any recommendations for a good laptop HD? My machine is Compaq Presario CQ60.\n\nA: I have personal experience with bad sectors on laptop, so Ubuntu was right when warning message appeared. I printed out a screenshot (by Disk Utility) with information about bad sectors. Being under 2-years warranty, a local repair service center has changed faulty HDD without any question.\nRegarding a new HDD. Buy SSD drive - it's fast and shock-proof and energy-saving solution, yet it's expensive :)\nGood luck,\nVincenzo\n\nA: Quite likely your hard drive has some form of physical damage and unless it is an older, slower drive, I would suggest you replace it ASAP. If you cannot boot you're in even more trouble. To avoid data corruption, don't try to access the hard drive until you have bought a new one.\nI would suggest a regular drive at 7200 rpm or so, or an SSD if you are not going to be doing a lot of high activity things on it (SSDs can be \"worn out\" by too many read/write cycles a bit faster than a regular HDD).\n\nA: In any case... Backup frequently. But I would also recommend using a SSD on a laptop since they aren't that affected by shock. For instance, I once ruined my HD on my way home from work. I thought I had configured the laptop to suspend when the lid was closed, but I hadn't. So I closed the lid and put it in my backpack and walked home. I wasn't running or anything like that, and it was only a few hundred meters, but still... I got thousands of bad sectors and had to replace it. That would not have happened to an SSD. \nI was about to say you can print SMART results in Palimpsest, but it doesn't look like you can. But you can use run \"sudo smartctl -a /dev/diskname\" to get some very useful output. If you add it to your question, I'm sure the answers will improve. \nIn the meantime, I'm filing a bug report about Palimpsest. :)\n\nA: you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*backup (and pray all important data is still there)\n\n*get a new drive\n\n*install a new system and restore/recover data from the backup\n\n\nA: Way to give your HDD some more life\nOne thing I looked into a lot on the net and found out myself, is what to do when you start getting some \"bad sectors\", a problem I came across with my HDD which recently caused boot failure just out of nowhere and received the \"treatment\" I explain.\n1. Backup your data\n2. Get a new disk, especially if you can do it for free (warranty).\n3. Try to give your HDD an orientation. I mean, tell ALL its little magnetic spaces (sorry I am not an engineer) to have the same polarity (seems they get a little crazy after some overwrites...) Best and easiest way to do that is by a zerofill, which makes your entire disk like 000000000000..., but there are also some Windows apps like DRevitalize that do pretty much something like that in not so uniform a way (and without losing data supposingly-never tried it to be honest)\nYou can do a zerofill by a LLF (low level format), or a slow format (device, not just partition) in Ubuntu's Disks GUI, or through your terminal, using the \"shred\" command: sudo shred -n 0 -v -z /dev/sdX (where sdX the disk you want to erase) and probably in a million other ways, I don't think it matters that much how you do it.\nI tried a 2-pass zerofill on a disk with 250 bad sectors and 75 more \"pending\". It eliminated the \"pending\" sectors somehow and significantly improved access times for some 2500 more sectors, from \"<500ms\" to \"<150ms\" (surface test with HDDScan). I guess some of those would soon become \"bad\" and remains to see if I can expect a time gain of days, weeks or more...\n", "Q: Installing Windows 7 using Virtual Box without having a CD I would like to create a windows 7 virtual machine on my computer, but I don't have my install disk.  I currently have it installed on my computer in a dual boot with ubuntu 11.04 and was wondering if there is a way to create a virtual machine using the already installed version, without needing to procure a CD with windows 7 on it.\nI am reasonably tech savy but would not consider myself an expert by any means.  If this is possible, would it be very difficult, and would there be any way to make it easier?\n\nA: I'd've made it a comment but I'm not allowed.\nI'm using Windows7 through VirtualBox and I don't think things you'd like to do possible.\nAnother thing - as far as I understand - you can download windows7 from anywhere - it's perfectly legal - the important thing is whither you have a serial number. If you deal with laptop - it must be sticked at the bottom. Then after you'll install the Win7 with your number at VirtualBox - you'd have to make a call to your local microsoft office.\n\nA: Yes, it's possible, but it's not easy. You can check this guide in the VirtualBox Forum:\nhttp://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?t=33356\nNote that this is quite offtopic and not Ubuntu related (it's a windows thing), you will be able to obtain more and better help in the Virtualbox forum or in some Windows site.\n", "Q: Read Only usb stick that won't let me do anything to it Somehow I messed up and accidentally made my usb stick into a read only file system.  I have tried a bunch of things to delete the files, including the basic (rm -f myfile) and attempting to allow writing (sudo chmod +w myfile) and then deleting, but none of this seems to work.  Any ideas on what I can do.  I don't have anything on the usb stick that I need, but I don't want to throw away an otherwise perfectly good piece of equipment.\nHow can I make it work?  Am I going about this completely the wrong way?\n\nA: I encountered this.  The fault was corrupted partitions.  Check your partition on the  USB stick.  This can get corrupted if you try formatting on Win and then on Ubuntu.  use \"gparted\".  You should see only 1 active partition. If you have an \"unallocated\" partition as well, the USB stick wont work.  If so, delete all partitions, and create one active partition only for the full gb size of the usb stick. unplug then plug in again, and you should have R/W again.\n\nA: Commands like rm and chmod are done on a mounted file-system. So if the file-system is read only those do not work. What you need to do is to mount the file-system as writeable.\nSome USB sticks have a switch on the stick to mount them read-only. Maybe that is the \nreason. It could also just be broken or damaged due to not correctly umounting it.\nBefore you do anything: copy the files over from the stick.\nIf it is not a hardware switch  unplug and plug the USB stick and issue a\ndmesg | grep -i panic\n\nThis will show you any panic messages. If you are seeing alot of them related to the USB stick and if it is a FAT partition you can use dosfsck to fix it.\nYou can find out how it is mounted with\nmount\n\nand use\ndosfsck -a /dev/sd{xn}\n\nto fix an MS-DOS partition table or sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sd{xn} to format the disc. Where {xn} is a letter and digit you got with the mount command.\nYou can also use gparted to format it by the way.\n\nA: Yes, if the filesystem is read-only, then setting modes on files will not have any effect at all. You can see in /etc/fstab if the filesystem is mounted read-only. But if you don't have anything on it, then you can also just make a new filesystem for it in gparted or palimpsest (the latter is installed by default in Ubuntu and is called Disk Manager or something).\n\nA: Check if you have the package ntfs-3g installed. Worked for me ;-)\n(remove and plug in your usb drive again after installing ntfs-3g)\n\nA: As I mentioned here I had a similar problem. \nntfs-3g already installed, chmod commands also did not help, did not see any significant error codes. Gparted did not work either. In fact, I found no USB worked. $dosfsk command did not help either. \nAll I did was reboot the ubuntu 16.04 machine with the stick in and now the USB sticks work.\n", "Q: How to install ubuntu on free dos \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to install Ubuntu? \n\nI am buying a samsung rv 509 laptop which come with dos pre installed.

Currently I have a XP desktop with no provision for CD burning but there is a provision for USB drive.\n\nA: Head over to the Ubuntu download page:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download\nStart downloading your preferred version of Ubuntu (the default should be fine).

Kubuntu 11.04\nAfter installing UbuntuOne for KDE via KPackageManager I have to inform my authentication password twice on every boot: one for KWallet and other for a \"keyring\", in this order. Is it possible to authenticate only once, in KWallet?\n\nA: No.\nKeyring is a GNOME thing. KWallet is a KDE thing. The UbuntuOne client is written with GNOME in mind, so it uses the Keyring.  There is no KDE version of the client.\nWhat you could do is install seahorse to manage the GNOME keyring, then set the login keyring password for GNOME to blank, so then it won't bother asking on login because it wouldn't be storing the authentication information encrypted at all... which obviously has its own security implications.\n\nA: Currently Ubuntu One uses GNOME Keyring to store credentials on Ubuntu.\nIn fact, there is code in the client to use python-keyring (we use it on the windows port), which supports KWallet, so it's not outside the realm of possibility that someday we may support KWallet automatically on KDE.\nHowever, there are no resources allocated to it at this time.\nHowever^2 the client is open source ;-)\n", "Q: Update Manager says 'Not all updates can be installed' I have 11.04 installed with Gnome 3 and everything was working fine until I tried to run the update manager.

You may have to do this a few times until all the packages are installed. \n", "Q: How can I install Ubuntu Server on an PowerPC Mac? I have an original mac mini (pre-late 2005 model) that I bought at an auction. The computer was completely wiped clean. There were no disks given with the computer. I turn the computer on and it loads a gray screen with a folder in the center, blinking with the question mark and smiley face.\nHere's what's I've tried.\nI burned Ubuntu on to a cd using another computer and loaded it into the mini. I reset the computer and waited for the cd to load. The cd never loaded. I took the cd out and restarted the computer.\nI made a USB install drive, following the instructions on Ubuntu's website. I turned off the mac mini. I inserted the USB into the mac mini. I turned on the mac mini while holding down the alt key. A purple screen comes on with two buttons, one for 'refresh' and one for 'next'. There are no other buttons or items on the screen (excluding the mouse).\nMy question: How do I install Ubuntu on this mac mini?\n\nA: You're trying to install i386 software on a PowerPC CPU. That's a completely different architecture, with a different instruction set -- they're not compatible.\nUbuntu has dropped official support for PowerPC a long time ago, but there are still community builds available. A good starting point is the Ubuntu Power PC FAQ.\n", "Q: How do I create an encrypted filesystem inside a file? I've found this interesting tutorial on flossstuff blog.\nIt explains how to create an empty file, format it as ext4, and mount it as a device.\nI'd like to know if it can be created as an encrypted ext4 file system.\nI've tried using palimpsest (the disk utility found in System menu) to format the already created file system but it doesn't work as it detects the file system being used. \nIf I try to unmount the file system, that won't work either because it doesn't detect the device (since it's not a real device like a harddrive or a USB drive).\nSo my question is, is there an option to create the file system as encrypted from the beginning? I've used these commands:\nCreate an empty file 200Mb size:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/file bs=1M count=200\n\nMake it ext4:\nmkfs -t ext4 file\n\nMount it in a folder inside my home:\nsudo mount -o loop file /path/to/mount_point\n\nIs there any way the mkfs command can create an encrypted ext4 filesystem asking for a decryption password?\nI'm planing to use this as a way to encrypt files inside Dropbox.\n\nA: You can use the losetup command with the -e parameter to create an encrypted loop device. Details available at http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Cryptoloop-HOWTO/loopdevice-setup.html\n\nA: Follow next steps to create an encrypted file with filesystem inside:\n1. The faster way to create file of given size is:\nfallocate -l 128M /path/to/file\n\n2. Create LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) partition within the file using dm-crypt tools:\ncryptsetup -y luksFormat /path/to/file\n\nYou can check that file is encrypted container:\n/path/to/file: LUKS encrypted file, ver 1 [aes, xts-plain64, sha1] UUID: 7e2af5a1-3fab-43ea-a073-3b9cc6073f00\n\n3. Open encrypted container:\ncryptsetup luksOpen /path/to/file data\n\ndata is device mapper volume name. You can choose other name.\nThis opens the LUKS device, and maps it to a name that we supply, in our case creating a file at /dev/mapper/data.\n4. Create ext4 filesystem on this device:\nmkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/data\n\n5. Then create mount point:\nmkdir /path/to/mount\n\n6. And mount device there:\nmount /dev/mapper/data /path/to/mount\n\n7. To unmount filesystem and close LUKS device:\numount /path/to/mount\ncryptsetup luksClose data\n\nNow you have encrypted LUKS container with ext4 filesystem inside.\nWhen you want to use it simply repeat steps 3 and 6. When you are finished call step 7.\nThis article was very helpful to me.\nAlso one day your container will run out of space.\nSuppose encrypted container file size is 128 MB and we want to increase its size to 512 MB.\nTo increase its capacity follow these steps:\n1. Unmount and close LUKS device (see step 7 in above list).\n2. Increase container file size:\n dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/file bs=384M count=1 oflag=append conv=notrunc\n\n3. Open LUKS device.\ncryptsetup luksOpen /path/to/file data\n\n4. Resize LUKS device to match container file size.\nFrom man page:\n\n\nIf --size (in sectors) is not specified, the size of the underlying block device is used.\n\n\nSo you can just:\ncryptsetup resize data\n\n5. Then resize ext4 filesystem:\ne2fsck -f /dev/mapper/data\nresize2fs /dev/mapper/data\n\n6. Now you can mount filesystem back:\nmount /dev/mapper/data /path/to/mount\n\n\nA: You can use cryptmount to encrypt a filesystem, also if the filesystem is on a file.\nThe cryptmount manual page has a very simple and detailed explanation that I report (modified) here, and it do mention explicitly a file based filesystem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Step 1\nAdd an entry in /etc/cryptmount/cmtab, as follows:\nmycrypt {\n    dev=/media/data/mycrypt dir=/home/enzotib/mycrypt\n    fstype=ext4 mountoptions=defaults cipher=twofish\n    keyfile=/etc/cryptmount/mycrypt.key\n    keyformat=builtin\n}\n\nwhere /media/data/mycrypt is the support file created by dd and /home/enzotib/mycrypt is the desired mountpoint.\n\n*Step 2\nGenerate a secret decryption key \nsudo cryptmount --generate-key 32 mycrypt\n\n\n*Step 3\nExecute the following command\nsudo cryptmount --prepare mycrypt\n\nyou will then be asked for the password used when setting up the key\n\n*Step 4\nCreate the filesystem\nsudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/mycrypt\n\n\n*Step 5\nExecute\nsudo cryptmount --release mycrypt\n\n\n*Step 6\nNow mount the filesystem\nmkdir /home/enzotib/mycrypt\ncryptmount -m mycrypt\n\nthen unmount it\ncryptmount -u mycrypt\n\nAlso, if you need to crypt a directory, encfs may be worth to take into consideration.\n", "Q: How to revert software sources back to default? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I fix this “E:Type '*' is not known on line * in source list …” update error? \n\nI had a little problem with the sources of my update, I'm running Ubuntu Natty Narwhal and I was tinkering with binaries for installing a Firefox add-on called fire sheep and I think that some how my update sources were altered and evertime I try to upate I get this error message\nAn unresolvable problem occurred while initializing the package information.\n\nPlease report this bug against the 'update-manager' package and include the following error message:\n\n'E:Type 'See' is not known on line 2 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list'\n\n\nA: I don't think it has anything to do with the add-on but I had a similar problem.

That should give you a funny-looking vertical panel on the side of one of your monitors. Right-click that new panel, and un-check the box that says \"expand\". You will then have a small little panel with a handle on it, under orientation, choose bottom (or top, wherever you want it) and it should now be a small horizontal panel floating on your screen. Move it where you want it, and check expand again and it will be locked in place. Right click on the panel and choose \"add to panel\", and choose \"Window List\". I'm assuming since you said you wanted something like MultiMon for Linux you wanted a task lisk of the apps/windows open on each screen, for that screen. This should be what you are looking for.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Unity side bar freeze bug I just installed ubuntu 11.04 and the side bar of the unity interface tends to freeze after a certain period of time and I can only fix it by restartyng the computer.

I'm writing a very simple browser based MP3 player in PHP. Part of this project requires that every MP3 file is converted to a WAV file.  There's a function in PHP called shell_exec that allows you to execute a command via the shell. For my project, whenever someone uploads a song to their account, the following command would be executed:\nshell_exec('ffmpeg -i inputSong.mp3 outputSong.wav')\n\nSo let's say there are 10 different people who finish uploading a song at the same exact time. Does the Linux server execute 10 shell commands simultaneously or does it only do one at a time?\nIf a server can handle multiple shell commands simultaneously, would the server be able to handle converting 10 different songs at the same time or does it only do one at a time?\n\nA: If you were to support a large number of users you would have to investigate an alternative method of handling the conversion process.\nFor example you would likely setup a job scheduling system such that you post requests to the system to convert a file and poll the system for completion status.  The scheduling system would take tasks from a queue and say perform up to four file conversions at a time.\nThis question might be of interest:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/q/265073/175849\n\nA: If you are doing it via PHP (or any other language that has access to shell commands) they will be done separately, which means that they will be done simultaneous if by chance the 10 users use the PHP script at the same time. Each PHP call through shell_exec will be done independent of the others. I myself have a shell_exec script which shows some information to my users for certain images and this is done independently from other PHP executed scripts through shell_exec.\nThere is a limit to how many simultaneous users PHP can handle, but it depends on your web server, PHP configuration file and MySQL if you are using it. I know the number is greater than 100 at the same time.\nWhen using CPU intensive commands, for example converting videos, the effective use of the commands would then depend on how much RAM you have and how much CPU power you have. For someone with 64 MB RAM and a 80486 it would go bad to try to convert two videos and 10 songs. That would overload the system. For someone with a Core 2 Duo server and 4 GB RAM I think converting several songs would be a piece of cake.\nSo basically, yes, Linux can handle multiple simultaneous shell commands, specially from PHP, but the overall performance would depend on the resources of the server (CPU, RAM, hard disk drive, etc.)\n", "Q: Will the new NetworkManager 0.9 be included in 11.10 and what features will it bring? Today I read that the 0.9 version of Network Manager which comes with \"ton of great changes\" (Which actually does not say much ;) ) was released so I was wondering if it will be coming with Ubuntu 11.10 and if yes what features does it bring since they are not mentioned in the main web page of the network manager.\n\nA: \nRelease process Network Manager v. 0.9\nThis major new release is planned for March 2011. It's most significant feature is a huge simplification of the configuration model, bringing benefits to both users and developers. The most significant feature for users will be richer and more capable network control and configuration applets for GNOME 3.0's GNOME Shell and Ubuntu's Indicator system, and full support for fast user switching and shared computers.\nFor developers, the 0.9 release merges the User and System settings services into NetworkManager itself, allowing simpler client applets and streamlined configuration management. As a result NetworkManager's D-Bus API is also much simpler, and further API convenience methods will be provided for common client operations like creating a new connection from a scanned access point, filtering existing connections for a specific device, etc.\nFor more detailed information on the architectural changes in the 0.9 release, see NetworkManager/ApiSimplify.\n\nBesides the list at the last link NetworkManager D-Bus Reference Manual also states NetworkManager now supports Intel WiMAX mobile broadband devices.\nAnd to answer your question: the Oneiric packages list shows version 0.9.0-0ubuntu1 for network manager.\n\nA: I think it would be correct also to say that you'll not be able to import your old network configurations into the new Network Manager because the structure is changed and it's not compatible with the old gconf style configs.\n", "Q: How do I install Filezilla server? I'm trying to get Filezilla FTP server and install it, but I can't find out how to.

To fix this go to Configure Wine and click Add Application then select Fillezilla installation program (Server) and in Windows Version select Windows Vista or higher. You can choose. I picked Windows 7.\n", "Q: 3D-accelerated Adobe Flash? How can I get Flash to be 3D-accelerated for a computer with a powerful discrete graphics card? Is there any specific version of Flash required or specific configuration for it?\n\nA: Flash 9.0.115.0 brought 3D hardware acceleration to Linux. Due to a series of problems using 3D acceleration, the feature is not enabled by default. \nTo enable 3D acceleration you have to set OverrideGPUValidation to true.\nYou can either do this in:\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/adobe/mms.cfg (you might need to create the folder) for a system wide change\n\n*~/.adobe/mms.cfg for a user change\nSee here: http://blogs.adobe.com/penguinswf/2008/08/secrets_of_the_mmscfg_file_1.html\n\nA: Along with what danjil said; you need to ensure that your card is supported. Unfortunately, up to know flash only supports HW acceleration on nVidia cards, and then only with supported drivers (they must support the vdpau acceleration API).\nIf you are using ATI graphics, or Open Source drivers for any card that does not support this API, you will probably not get hardware acceleration even in Flash 11.\nHowever, Adobe has said in the past that they have plans for supporting VA-API as well, so hopefully the wait should soon be over.\n", "Q: How do I make my windows minimize like a Mac in classic Gnome?

Maybe you want to install it by Wine or PlayonLinux. Your Steam games are installed on your Windows partition, because Steam did it. Of course, you can mount your Windows partition on Ubuntu, and launch your game manually by double-clicking on the .exe which will be using Wine. In my opinion, if you run on a dual-boot, it is better to run your Windows Steam games on Windows, because Wine is a good solution for apps like Office 2007 or Internet Explorer which does not require a good configuration, but if you want a good experience when playing a game, just don't use Wine, and play on Windows.\n", "Q: unable to connect to broadband connection with two LAN card I have installed Ubuntu on my system, which has two LAN card. One of the LAN card is not working. But the other do work. I have tried configuring the internet connection but failed. \n\nA: From your comment, I assume, you want to setup a PPPoE connection. This is a method used by some broadband modems to connect a single computer to the internet. You have already connected modem and computer via ethernet and the method works on Windows. You want to know how to do the same with Ubuntu. The fact the you have two network cards could make it harder to get the configuration right? Did I get this?\nOn modern versions of Ubuntu all network connections are handles by the network-manager. You can access the network manager via its icon (two computers) in the status bar. You can right-click the icon and select \"edit connections ...\" or similar. This opens a dialog box. The last tab in this dialog reads \"DSL\" or \"Broadband\" or similar. Here, click the  \"Add + \" button and enter username + password for your broadband connection.\nThis is the standard method that you should try first. At the moment, I do not know, how Ubuntu decides which network interface to use. Possible, it will scan all of them for a PPPoE modem.\n", "Q: Issues after Marlin file browser installation?

For instance, if you have a website which files are in /var/www/amira, then you could set the files and folders to belong to www-data:amira. Then you would allow that group to edit files and add users to that group. The amira user would already have that group as its primary group. This is a much better approach than saying a user can edit all roots files since you can then limit which files are editable by who. If amira got hacked, then the website would be editable by the hacker, but your openssh-server would still be safe, for instance.\n", "Q: How do I stop wireless from reactivating after waking from suspend?

The assumption therefore is that the project is either in an extensive lull or has been abandoned.\nThe software itself in the tar file I have found nigh-impossible to compile.\nMy suggestion therefore would have been to install ubuntuone-control-panel-gtk - this gives you a GTK type interface for Ubuntu-One.\nHowever this package is only available for Maverick and Natty.  It hasnt been backported to Lucid.  There is one potential PPA available with this package backported.  However, as the author himself says - use with care.  Therefore - take the authors advice and backup first using a good backup tool such as Clonezilla\nTo Install on Lucid/Maverick\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:kalon33/experimental-stuff\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ppa:kalon33/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntuone-control-panel-gtk\n\nNOW VERY IMPORTANT\nOpen your software sources and untick both the Kalon33 experimental PPA and Kalon33 PPA.  The reason is that you probably will not want any of the authors extensive builds for Lucid/Maverick.\nFinish off running\nsudo apt-get update\n\nRunning UbuntuOne\nThe package will install Ubuntu-One under the Settings menu.\n", "Q: Customization for quicklists of Unity is reverted after reboot I followed the instructions here to modify my quicklists of Unity. For examples in order to add an \"Root Terminal\" item I modified my gnome-terminal.desktop as follows:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Terminal\nComment=Use the command line\nTryExec=gnome-terminal\nExec=gnome-terminal\nIcon=utilities-terminal\nType=Application\nX-GNOME-DocPath=gnome-terminal/index.html\nX-GNOME-Bugzilla-Bugzilla=GNOME\nX-GNOME-Bugzilla-Product=gnome-terminal\nX-GNOME-Bugzilla-Component=BugBuddyBugs\nX-GNOME-Bugzilla-Version=2.32.1\nCategories=GNOME;GTK;Utility;TerminalEmulator;\nStartupNotify=true\nOnlyShowIn=GNOME;Unity;\nX-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=gnome-terminal\n\nX-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=Root;\n[Root Shortcut Group]\nName=Root Terminal\nExec=gksudo gnome-terminal\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\nAnd then I dragged it to the launcher. It worked fine before rebooting. But after the system is restarted, the Terminal button launcher is reverted (No Root Terminal after right click), despite of the desktop file has been modified.\nSo what steps do I miss? Thanks for those who gives hints.\n\nA: First step is to copy the .desktop file over to ~/.local/share/applications and to edit that version. ~/.local/share/applications overrules the .desktop from /usr/share/applications.\nThe ones in /usr/share/applications get recreated probably to prevent malformed desktop files to crash Unity: in case of a crash it can fallback to the unchanged version.\n", "Q: How to send keystrokes to Chrome in Ubuntu?

The Novacut architecture uses CouchDB to keep the UI and backend servers network-transparent. In the normal, single-computer case, the servers run locally on that computer. But you can likewise run the servers (and CouchDB) on other systems, without the UI noticing the difference.\n\nA: Well you could include a language that can run shell commands like php and this way take advantage of stuff like installing apps from a webpage and executing some commands (Like detecting which theme to use and what CSS to use depending on the system theme). For example you have this two questions which might help:\nCan a server handle simultaneous shell commands? (Which talks about executing multiple commands)\nRun a line command from a web (Clicking in a webpage link) (Which talks about clicking on a link and installing an app from the software center)\nFor a way to learn what theme is used you could parse the ubuntu file where it has the value for the default theme and depending on it modify the CSS of the site to reflect the new theme.\nQuestions about theme and where to find it can be found here:\nWhat file I need to edit to change the text color in a theme?\nDesktop forgets theme?\nEditing GTK theme (adding a border)\nAll of this (and more if you use the search) help you know where to look when parsing and what files you can check to see what theme the system is using and what to use in the web page then.\n\nA: A good starting point for bindings and APIs on Ubuntu can be found on developer.ubuntu.com. I don't have any experience with it, but you will probably also want to look into Gjs, the Javascript bindings for GNOME. \nDepending on what you are trying to do, you could just build the app like any HTML + JS app and then throw it into a Webkit view. It's extremely simple to do in python:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk, WebKit\nimport os, sys\n\nclass Browser:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.window = Gtk.Window()\n        self.window.set_default_size(800, 600)\n        view = WebKit.WebView()\n        view.load_html_string(\"<strong>Hello World!</strong>\", \"file:///\")  \n        self.window.add(view)\n\n        self.window.show_all()\n        self.window.connect('destroy', lambda w: Gtk.main_quit())\n\ndef main():\n    app = Browser()\n    Gtk.main()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n\nA: Yes, you can write apps in pure html/css/js and yes binding are available for JS using GObject introspection. Take a look at GnomeSeed https://live.gnome.org/Seed\nSeedKit: https://live.gnome.org/SeedKit\nTutorial: https://live.gnome.org/Seed/Tutorial\n\nA: You can develop using HTML + Javascript for the interface by using an embedded WebKit frame in a Gtk window (this is easiest to do in Python). The hardest part is communicating with the system from your HTML/Javascript application.\nYou can do this by passing messages between Javascript and Python. You will, however, have to write the system logic as Python functions but this is pretty easy to do.\nHere is a simple example showing communication between Python and Javascript. In the example, the HTML/Javascript displays a button, that when clicked sends an array [\"hello\", \"world\"] to Python which joins the array into a string \"hello world\" and sends it back to Javascript. The Python code prints a representation of the array to the console and the Javascript code pops up an alert box that displays the string.\nexample.py\nimport gtk\nimport webkit\nimport json\nimport os\n\nJAVASCRIPT = \"\"\"\nvar _callbacks = {};\nfunction trigger (message, data) {\n    if (typeof(_callbacks[message]) !== \"undefined\") {\n        var i = 0;\n        while (i < _callbacks[message].length) {\n            _callbacks[message][i](data);\n            i += 1;\n        }\n    }\n}\nfunction send (message, data) {\n    document.title = \":\";\n    document.title = message + \":\" + JSON.stringify(data);\n}\nfunction listen (message, callback) {\n    if (typeof(_callbacks[message]) === \"undefined\") {\n        _callbacks[message] = [callback];\n    } else {\n        _callbacks[message].push(callback);\n    }\n}\n\"\"\"\n\nclass HTMLFrame(gtk.ScrolledWindow):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(HTMLFrame, self).__init__()\n        self._callbacks = {}\n        self.show()\n        self.webview = webkit.WebView()\n        self.webview.show()\n        self.add(self.webview)\n        self.webview.connect('title-changed', self.on_title_changed)\n\n    def open_url(self, url):\n        self.webview.open(url);\n        self.webview.execute_script(JAVASCRIPT)\n\n    def open_path(self, path):\n        self.open_url(\"file://\" + os.path.abspath(path))\n\n    def send(self, message, data):\n        self.webview.execute_script(\n            \"trigger(%s, %s);\" % (\n                json.dumps(message),\n                json.dumps(data)\n            )\n        )\n\n    def listen(self, message, callback):\n        if self._callbacks.has_key(message):\n            self._callbacks[message].append(callback)\n        else:\n            self._callbacks[message] = [callback]\n\n    def trigger(self, message, data, *a):\n        if self._callbacks.has_key(message):\n            for callback in self._callbacks[message]:\n                callback(data)\n\n    def on_title_changed(self, w, f, title):\n        t = title.split(\":\")\n        message = t[0]\n        if not message == \"\":\n            data = json.loads(\":\".join(t[1:]))\n            self.trigger(message, data)\n\ndef output(data):\n    print(repr(data))    \n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    window = gtk.Window()\n    window.resize(800, 600)\n    window.set_title(\"Python Gtk + WebKit App\")\n    frame = HTMLFrame()\n    frame.open_path(\"page.html\")\n    def reply(data):\n        frame.send(\"alert\", \" \".join(data))\n    frame.listen(\"button-clicked\", output)\n    frame.listen(\"button-clicked\", reply)\n    window.add(frame)\n    window.show_all()\n    window.connect(\"destroy\", gtk.main_quit)\n    gtk.main()\n\npage.html\n<html>\n<body>\n<input type=\"button\" value=\"button\" id=\"button\" />\n<script>\ndocument.getElementById(\"button\").onclick = function () {\n    send(\"button-clicked\", [\"hello\", \"world\"]);\n};\nlisten(\"alert\", function (data) {alert(data);});\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>     \n\nThe only python code you really need to pay attention to here is the code from def output(data): to the end of the file which should be pretty easy to understand.\nTo run this make sure python-webkit and python-gtk2 are installed then save the files in the same folder and run:\npython example.py\n\n\n\nA: Now we have  AppJS -- https://github.com/milani/appjs !\nAs they said, \"It uses Chromium as the core (so that the latest HTML5 APIs are supported) and Node.js as the backbone.\"\n", "Q: Is it possible to set Dash to show a black background instead of generated from the wallpaper?

Well, not at all, I use NTFS compression a lot (in the past). VDI (Virtual Box) files get a really good ratio.\nNow I had discovered Pismo file Mount (and it also works on Linux). it can create a file that acts as a container (as a folder) and can be compressed (also with better ratio than NFTS) and at the same time encrypted.\nWhy I mention it. because any clone tool will see such container as a file (when not mounted as folder) and read/dump/backup the compressed stream of data, not the plain uncompressed data (as with NTFS compression). so restoring is as with any other file.\nInstead of compressing a NTFS folder with NTFS compression attribute, I put a Pismo file Mount virtual folder. get better compression, etc.\nI must also warn all of you interested on such free tool. it has no shrink (at least yet), so if folder content changes a lot it is not a so good idea.\nBut for immutable Virtual Disks, ISOs, and things that will not change, the ratio it gets is very close to LZMA2 ones (7-Zip) and it can be read/write on the fly.\nAnd it is cross-platform.\nNote the bad guy of NTFS compression talking about fragmentation. when you write a file to a NTFS with NTFS compression on, it does it this way (yes horrible designed, I think it is done like that to ensure greater fragmentation in intention way, worst can not be done):\n\n\n*\n\n*Start write position is pre-calculated as 64K*N, where N is the number of the 64K chunk that will be tried to be compressed\n\n*A buffer for 64K is reserved\n\n*That buffer is filled with 64K and then compressed\n\n*Only the 4K blocks needed are written, the rest are let as free space\n\n\nSo it creates a lot, lot of GAPs in the middle of the file, and only after a file defragmentation that GAPs disappear, but that defragmentation does not occur until user order it (contig.exe, defrag.exe, etc).\nYes, it writes the N'th 64K chunk on a position multiple of 64K, no matter if previous data could or not could be compressed, it leave a Gap between each 64K chunk (if all could be compressed).\nPismo File Mount virtual folder compression acts like any normal compression is supposed to be done, piped mode, so no gaps. at least until you delete something.\nAlso another warning, do not put VHD / VHDX files inside it, Windows will not be able to attach them! Windows uses a kernel trick to mount such things, it does not use file-system level, works at low level.\nI would also like to get my hands on a Linux NTFS defragmenter, sure would be faster than all that run over Windows. it is a total madness to defragment free space. or better talking. creating a whole big enough for a new big file.\nAlso it would be great my memory work better. in the past I was using a tool (command line, sorry) on Windows that could copy/move a file in non-fragmented way. moving the needed files away while getting that needed whole, and not fragmenting that ones. it only gives a message if it can not find a way to put the file (impossible to get a hole) or a different warning if it needs t fragment another file (asking if authorised by user), etc. was really great. I did not remember the name (and maybe it does not work with modern windows, it was for Win2000).\n\nA: Yes, you can use shake. You'll first need to add a custom repository to your system:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:un-brice/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install shake-fs\n\nThen you can do\nsudo shake /some/dir\n\n\nA: There is no such a tool around, for what I know.\nSome site reports the following command\n# WARNING - does not work\nfsck -t ntfs --kerneldefrag /dev/hdX\n\nbut this does not work, and it is not clear where do they get it.\n\nA: No.  These are Windows filesystems so you will need to use Windows to defrag them.\n\nA: There is a very well know tricky cheat to archive a NTFS defragmentation (including free space)... it can be done with a Live Linux like SystemRescueCD...\nBut, you must have a second HDD or at least a 51% free space (that if not using compression).\nThe trick (very tricky) is to use tools to \"clone\" the partition, but not typical ones... there is a tool that can \"clone\" a NTFS parttion but not doing an exact \"clone\"... let me explain...\nThe tool is fsarchive (if i do not remember bad).\nIt makes a very big file (as clone tools does), with all files (beware of NTFS special metadata of files, streams i think they are callled), just as a \"clone\" tool does...\nBut the tricky part comes when restoring... it does not put files where they where, it puts files without any fragmentation at all.\nI had used it for Windows System partition as well as for NTFS data partitions... with succed... not very easy to use / understand (read carfully the docs)... but can do the trick.\nRemember... such big file it create can be compressed, so not really need to have a 51% free.\nBut any way, first you must Shrink NTFS partition... use GParted (if i dont remember bad).\nSo steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Worst case: HDD has only one BIG NTFS partition, with enough free space\n\n*Boot SystemRescuCD (if you want start X windows with wizard command)\n\n*Use GParted to shrink NTFS partition to its min size (will fragment NTFS files more, no matter)\n\n*Use GParted to create another partition on free space, better if ext4 type (journal)\n\n*Mount such new partition, but do not mount NTFS\n\n*Use fsarchiver to create a \"clone\" of the NTFS partition, use compression and store the bif file on created partition\n\n*From now on this is very RISKY: Use GParted to delete NTFS partition and re-create it\n\n*Restore the \"clone\" using fsarchiver, all files on NTFS partition will be 1 fragment (except one or two because $MFT could be putted on middle, not at strat or end of partition)\n\n*Use Gparted to shrink NTFS partition if needed\n\n*Check NFTS is correct, can be mounted, read/write, and dismounted\n\n*Unmount newly created ext4 partition\n\n*Use Gparted to grow that ext4 (or better, delete it and recreate it)\n\n\nThat's it, folks... as i said very tricky and risky, of course.\nBeware Key Points: \n\n\n*\n\n*NFTS shrink let enough free space to hold a compressed image of the NTFS partition (51% free on the HDD will ensure there is enough)\n\n*fsarchiver does not save NTFS streams?\n\n*fsarchiver restore do not put files where they where, it put them unfragmented (like a copy)\n\n*After deleting and recreating NTFS partition there is no back way\n\n\nThe steps are for: Use a LiveCD / LiveUSB linux to defrag a NTFS partition that uses 100% of the disk, with no other HDD connect to such PC [must have enough free space].\nIMPORTANT:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some could think if you have 51% free on the HDD after NTFS shrink it could be safer to just create that ext4 and copy all NTFS to it, then delete NTFS, recreate it and copy them back... DOING THAT will cause looses, like NTFS security permisions, etc\n\n\nAs long as i know GParted/fsarchiver is the most near solution (for using only a LiveCD/LiveUSB with Linux), not fast, somehow risky, but satisfing terms imposed by the person who post the question.\nBE AWARE: It is very, very risky... as with any \"clone\" tool... and for now i do not know any other best way... and it will loose NTFS streams (if i do not remember bad)\nPLEASE: Read carfully fsarchiver docs, before using it.\nI have any responsability (i had used it on my own data, but allways i have a external BackUP - good partices).\nIn practice... all info i have, i put them on at least three different mediums (HDD, DVD, Flash Memories), with at least three copies on each medium, so i have 9 copies... if i loose 8 of them it rest one more to recover data... i am a little paranoid, i kown.\n", "Q: User friendly way to access an MTP device (Android 3.0 tablet) Is there a user friendly way to access a MTP device from Ubuntu such as an Android 3.0 tablet?\nThanks.\n\nA: One suggestion is to use Ubuntu One or DropBox to move stuff on/off.\nUbuntu's default music management application, Rhythmbox (Applications → Sound & Video → Rhythmbox Music Player), supports first to fifth generation iPods, including the iPod mini, iPod Photo, iPod Shuffle, iPod nano, and iPod Video.

I have Lubuntu and Ubuntu partitions on my drive.  I've been having an interesting time with the new lubuntu partition.  I've encountered strange things with the game Minecraft, Java and graphics drivers on the lubuntu partition. \nFirstly, I'll say that Minecraft runs fine at about 60fps on the Ubuntu partition with the latest drivers. (This is lower than it should be as it's a pretty decent graphics card [Radeon HD 5700].)\nWhen I first started lubuntu, I tried to see if I could get Minecraft running on Java.  Java crashed when loading the main game graphics on both Sun and OpenJDK without proprietary drivers.  \nJava also crashed on both Javas with proprietary drivers after the necessary restart.  However, after disabling (with 'remove' button) the proprietary drivers with jockey-gtk in the session after the restart to install the drivers, Minecraft ran very well at ~120fps.  This didn't continue after another restart, when it ran at 9fps.\nAfter failing thereafter on lubuntu to get it working at >15fps, I tried reinstalling lubuntu and installed the exact same driver (the latest one, not the one appearing on jockey) and Java versions as on Ubuntu.  That is, now Ubuntu and lubuntu have the same graphics driver and Java version.  Minecraft still crashes in the same way on lubuntu but works fine on Ubuntu.  I would appreciate any explanation for any of these events.  What differences between lubuntu and Ubuntu could cause this?\n\nEdit:  After installing the 32bit driver version on lubuntu (seeing as\n  lubuntu is 32bit), I have Java \"working\" for Minecraft.

I have Ubuntu installed on an Ext4 RAID1 with Windows 7 on another disk. The RAID is a software RIAD setup in Ubuntu.\nI've used the Ext2Fsd project to mount normal Ext4 systems, and it works well. When I try to mount one of the RAID disks, I get a \"UUID is 0\" error.\nI'm wondering if anyone knows a way to access my RAID in Windows. I've seen this question, but the only answer that mentions a software RAID doesn't really offer any evidence.\n\nA: For starters, never try to mount one half of a RAID1 array without mdadm (the software raid you will be using on Ubuntu) being present. It handles how the two drives sync up so if you mount and alter (access times count as altering) one disk, mdadm has a real challenge to work out what's gone wrong. It could result in needing to rebuild the array or even data loss.\nI was going to suggest you have a virtual machine (Ubuntu Server is very light) that mounted the partitions directly (as modern VMs can) so you're using the same version of mdadm as your install of Ubuntu. It's fairly sound logic but it's a lot more flimsey than a native install because you have a software layer between Ubuntu and the disks.\nI say I was going to suggest it because I read Accessing Linux mdadm RAID+LVM volumes/data in Windows using a VM - Rewritten from somebody doing exactly what I imagined who corrupted an non-insignificant portion of their data.\n\nI think the only safe ways to share a RAID array with Windows are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Keep Windows in a VM or run it on another computer\n\n*Run the RAID array on another computer (eg dedicated NAS or another sort of server)\n\n", "Q: How to use global hotkeys when in fullscreen game? None of the global shortcuts work when I'm using any fullscreen game, including Alt+Tab.\nI can't get out of the game until I use some kind of \"exit\" option, can't start/stop the music player...  \nThis is especially annoying on my laptop, as fullscreen applications increase the brightness to the maximal value (which is another problem, but I think they have a common root), and I can't change it.\nI use Kubuntu 11.10.\n\nA: It seems to me in a lot of games this simply does not seem to work, it really depends on the game. The only hotkeys that work always are the global hot keys for switching to terminal, like Ctrl+Alt+F1 etc., I think it must have to do with how the other hotkeys are handled in Ubuntu, at least with certain hardware, in some games I can not even change my volume with the funct key. However in games like Ryzom all the hotkeys work, and even the hot corners work for showing all windows and showing desktop etc.\n\nA: A solution that works for me:\nThere is a plasmoid called Show desktop. I assigned Meta+D shortcut to it. Pressing Win+D minimizes all windows, though it doesn't change the screen resolution (at least immediately).\nAfter you pause the music or respond to an IM message - maximize the game window again.\nThough it is really pity no one implemented this in Kwin by default.\n", "Q: Why do I get a 'Connection closed' error when trying to branch a Launchpad branch?

The nvidia driver from nvidia.com won't work with it out-of-the-box because of the way it's connected (through the CPU).

Should I always run applications using optirun before the command name?\nThanks.\n\nA: The official AMD fglrx driver has some support for hybrid graphics itself; there's less need for Bumblebee and solutions like that.\nOf course, this doesn't work on the AMD/Intel hybrid system I have, so I'm not sure quite how good the support is. ☺\n\nA: As you can see from the very first stuff you read from the Site.\n[...]nVidia Optimus support for Linux[...]\nBumblebee aims to provide support for nVidia Optimus laptops for GNU/Linux\ndistributions. Using Bumblebee, you can use your nVidia card for rendering\ngraphics which will be displayed using the Intel card.\nSo no, it's for Optimus enabled laptops Only.\n\nA: Currently, Bumblebee supports NVIDIA hardware only, but the Bumblebee Project team is investigating options for AMD Switchable Graphics Technology which can be tracked in issue 52 on Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee.\nAs far as I know, the fglrx driver already supports hybrid graphics as was mentioned in http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-909802.html. The radeon driver does not have this option, but may be supported by Bumblebee in the future.\nAs for your second question, commands must be preceeded with optirun only if you want to run it with the discrete video card, e.g. optirun firefox.

When I opened the app on the iPad, it said I need to subscribe to the streaming music service. I did. I entered my account information but I still can't find the songs. What else should I do?\n\nA: The streaming service relies on metadata scanned from songs found in your personal storage (so you can pick songs based on e.g. artist rather than what folder you put them in).  This metadata scan is only performed for people who have subscribed to the streaming service, so it may just be the case that your songs haven't been scanned yet.\nIf the problem doesn't correct itself in a few hours, I would suggest using the contact form so the problem can be investigated and you can make use of the service you've paid for:\nhttps://one.ubuntu.com/help/contact/\n", "Q: SSD or USB for HTPC/Homeserver (only the OS) I have a htpc / homeserver  (apache2, mysql for some website testing) and I also use it as a htpc. My current setup is, it is in my bedroom, the OS is installed on a 2 TB drive, but at night the OS starts writing or reading some stuff from the disk. It is quite annoying as it does not spin down completely and makes noise, which irritates me :p.\nI was thinking of putting the OS on a usb drive or an SSD. But what would be the best option? Is getting the SSD the best option?\nI'd like some pro's and con's. :)\n\nA: I would probably find out what it is that starts using the disk at night, why it does it at night, and how to make it do that some other part of the day, preferably when you're not around. I would look for updatedb. \nBy default, Ubuntu runs certain tasks at 6:25am every day. This updates some databases, etc, and will cause disks to spin up. If that timing seems correct to you, then you can edit /etc/crontab. You will see a line line this one: \n25 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )\nThe first column is the minute of the hour, the next is the hour, then there is day of month, month and day of week. An asterisk means every. For instance, the hour column is set to * for the hourly scripts. So, if you edit it to say, 0 12 * * * blablabla, then it will run then it run every day at noon. \nThe scripts themselves, are stored in /etc/cron.hourly, cron.daily, etc. You can just add runnable scripts there in order to add features yourself. \nI hope that helps. :)\n\nA: No matter how hard you try, you wont be able to eliminate all activities that are preventing HDD from spinning down. There are cron / anacron jobs, auto-updates, heck, even screensaver can trigger HDD. Ive tried this in my netbook, to conserve energy, and its simply not possible without some serious hack and fine-tuning.\nSo yes, SSD or USB are great solutions for silent operation. My pros and cons:\nSSD\nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*Speed - Its the fastest non volatile storage you can get, period\n\n*Size - It starts from 32~64GB and all the way to 256GB (or even more)\n\n*Compatibility - Any motherboard with Sata will handle them\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Price - They are still very expensive compared to HDD. Prolly overkill to an htpc\n\n*Install - You have to open you machine, screw it, plug wires, etc etc\n\n\nUSB Stick\nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*Price - Very affordable, and you prolly have a few 4~16GB lying around already\n\n*Plug and Play - Stick it and boot. No wires, no opening your case\n\n*Portable - Take it to any PC and you have your portable htpc server ;)\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Size: Usually top USB sticks are 32~64GB. Not that you need more for an htpc\n\n*Blinking led: Try to find one without led, or it will be annoying. Sandisk's Cruzer Blade may be an option\n\n*Ancient BIOS may not boot from USB. Well, they may not have Sata either, so not really a con compared to SSD\n\n*Speed - Even the fastest USB2.0 is no match for an SSD\n\n\nMay I add a 3rd contender?\nSD Flash Card\nPros\n\n\n*\n\n*Cheapest of all.\n\n*Pretty decent speed of you get a good class card\n\n*Put that never-used card reader to some good use ;)\n\n*Don't use one of your precious USB slots\n\n\nCons\n\n\n*\n\n*Need a card reader (duh)\n\n*Not good if you actually use your card reader in your htpc\n\n*Smallest size of the bunch\n\n\nHope that helps!\n\nA: It's also possible to use some kind of \"live\" distro to run everything in RAM.

You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete.\n\nScript: resource://gre/modules/XPCOMUtils.jsm:282\n\nSometimes it is other scripts.\nObviously it does not happen when I close Firefox before closing the lid, and waking up is much faster. It might be linked to Gmail specifically.\nAny idea what is going on and how to stop it from happening?\nNatty/Lenovo Thinkpad R500/ATI\n\nA: I expect the problem is with your session expiring on the server. \nWhen your client, Firefox tries to initiate communication it will use the expired session_ID / cookie. In gmails case, the server expires sessions when you log out, or if there has been no communication with the client for a few minutes about 15. Gmail, uses ajax to continuously check if the client is connected. It maintains a list of all currently active connections sessions using unique sessionID associated with an account. \nWhen you go into hibernate, you browser looses its connection to the server, and your session will expire on the server. When you try to reconnect, the scripts on your client will try to connect using a sessionID the server does not know exists, as it destroyed that session when it could no longer detect that your client was connected. \n\nA: The problem was that at return from sleep, Firefox would see scripts have been running for an unusual long time (because of sleep) and thus proposed to kill them.\n", "Q: How to run a checkdisk? I suspect there might be bad sector on a disk. I used ext3 filesystem.\nWhat tool is the best equivalent of the error checking tool of Windows?\n\nA: Throughout this answer I'll assume, that a storage drive appears as a block device at the path /dev/sdc. To find the path of a storage drive in our current setup, use:\n\n*\n\n*Gnome Disks  (formerly Gnome Disk Utility, a. k. a. palimpsest), if a GUI is available, or\n\n*on the terminal look at the output of lsblk and ls -l /dev/disk/by-id and try to find the right device by size, partitioning, manufacturer and model name.\n\nBasic check\n\n*\n\n*only detects entirely unresponsive media\n\n*almost instantaneous (unless medium is spun down or broken)\n\n*safe\n\n*works on read-only media (e. g.

It still appears as a block device to the kernel and in the disk manager, but its first sector holding the partition table is not readable. This can be verified easily with:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/null count=1\n\nIf this command results in a message about an “Input/output error”, our drive is broken or otherwise fails to interact with the Linux kernel as expected. In the a former case, with a bit of luck, a data recovery specialist with an appropriately equipped lab can salvage its content. In the latter case, a different operating system is worth a try.

CD, DVD, BluRay)\n\nTo test the read integrity of the whole device without writing to it, we can use badblocks(8) like this:\nsudo badblocks -b 4096 -c 4096 -s /dev/sdc\n\nThis operation can take a lot of time, especially if the storage drive actually is damaged. If the error count rises above zero, we'll know that there's a bad block. We can safely abort the operation at any moment (even forcefully like during a power failure), if we're not interested in the exact amount (and maybe location) of bad blocks. It's possible to abort automatically on error with the option -e 1.\nNote for advanced usage: if we want to reuse the output for e2fsck, we need to set the block size (-b) to that of the contained file system. We can also tweak the amount of data (-c, in blocks) tested at once to improve throughput; 16 MiB should be alright for most devices.\nNon-destructive read-write check\n\n*\n\n*very thorough\n\n*slowest\n\n*quite safe (barring a power failure or intermittent kernel panic)\n\nSometimes – especially with flash media – an error only occurs when trying to write. (This will not reliably discover (flash) media, that advertise a larger size, than they actually have; use Fight Flash Fraud instead.)\n\n*\n\n*NEVER use this on a drive with mounted file systems! badblocks refuses to operate on those anyway, unless you force it.\n\n\n*Don't interrupt this operation forcefully! Ctrl+C (SIGINT/SIGTERM) and waiting for graceful premature termination is ok, but killall -9 badblocks (SIGKILL) isn't. Upon forceful termination badblocks cannot restore the original content of the currently tested block range and will leave it overwritten with junk data and possibly corrupt the file system.\nTo use non-destructive read-write checks, add the -n option to the above badblocks command.\nDestructive read-write check\n\n*\n\n*very thorough\n\n*slower\n\n*ERASES ALL DATA ON THE DRIVE\nAs above, but without restoring the previous drive content after performing the write test, therefore it's a little faster.  Since data is erased anyway, forceful termination remains without (additional) negative consequence.\nTo use destructive read-write checks, add the -w option to the above badblocks command.\n\nA: fsck  - check and repair a Linux file system. Invoke it using\nfsck /dev/sda1\n\nwhere /dev/sda1 is the drive you want to check. See 'man fsck' for more details.\nThere's also 'badblocks' command which checks a device for, you guessed it, bad blocks.\nThe drive need to be unmounted when checked, so to check the root partition you need to create a file 'forcefsck' in the root of the partition and reboot. The device will be checked upon the next boot:\nsudo touch /forcefsck\nsudo reboot\n\nAlternatively, you can boot from a Live CD and run the check from there.\n\nA: You can test-read the entire disk, while showing a progress indicator:\ntime sudo pv /dev/sdc >/dev/null\n\nCertain disk problems would manifest as reported I/O errors.  This is a bit nicer than dd due to the progress indicator and because the command-line interface is a bit more standard and a bit less typo-prone.  Note that pv is basically and enhanced version of cat.  It may not be installed by default, but can be installed with sudo apt-get install pv.\nA similar approach is to read the disk with one of the several available tools that are specifically aware of disk I/O errors -- and have the feature of \"trying hard to rescue data\".  Search for ddrescue in the package manager.\n\nA: If you have a partition that you CAN NOT LOOSE THE DATA follow these steps\n\n\n*\n\n*Determine which partition you want to check for bad sector using the \n\n\n$fdisk -l commnd\nLets assume that the partition to check is called /dev/sdPTC (partition to check)\nand that you have another partition to store the results mounted on /scan/resultPath/ folder\n2.Then you can run this command\n$sudo badblocks -v /dev/sdPTC > /scan/resultPath/badsectors.txt\nwhich will determine what are the bad blocks of the given device and store them on a file called badsectors.txt\n\n\n*Now you can use fsck command to tell Ubuntu not to use the bad sectors mentioned in the badsectors.txt file. \n\n\n$sudo fsck -l /scan_result/badsectors.txt /dev/sda\nThat way life of the hard disk is increased a bit until you get a new one for replacement.\n\nIf you have a complete partition that you want to check for bad physical sectors and you CAN AFFORD LOOSE ALL DATA on that partition or is EMPTY follow these steps\n\n\n*\n\n*$sudo apt-get install gnome-disk-utility\n\n*$sudo gnome-disks\n\n*Check and double check that there is no important data on that partition\n\n*Using gnome-disks DELETE/REMOVE the partition by hand using the \"-\" sign\n\n*Using gnome-disks CREATE a new partition and select the \"slow\" option that will check the given space for errors \n\n\nA: smartctl\nIMO smartctl is a better tool. You likely have to install it first\nsudo apt-get install smartmontools \n\nThen\nsudo smartctl -a /dev/sda | less\n\nto print drive health data, attributes, and available test results. To quit less, type q. Alternatively\nsudo smartctl -H /dev/sda\n\nto just print health data.\nTo begin a new short (a few minutes) or long (up to many hours) self test in background:\nsudo smartctl -t [short|long]\n\nGSsmartControl \n (home page) and Gnome Disks are graphical front ends if you prefer.\nSee also\n\n\n*\n\n*Smartmontools\n\n*http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-find-out-if-harddisk-failing.html\n\n*http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/linux-and-open-source/using-smartctl-to-get-smart-status-information-on-your-hard-drives/\n\nA: badblocks\nYou can check for badblocks running the command\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo badblocks -nsv /dev/[device-partition] > bad-blocks-result for a non-destructive read-write test. That will generate a file called bad-blocks-result with the sectors damaged.\n\n\n*\n\n*\n-n Use non-destructive read-write mode.  By default only a non-destructive read-only test is done.\n\n\n*\n-s Show  the progress of the scan by writing out rough percentage completion of the current badblocks pass over the disk.\n\n\n*\n-v Verbose mode.\n\n\n\n*Then, you can run sudo fsck -t ext3 -l bad-blocks-result /dev/[device-partition] to tell the file system where the bad sectors are and move data away from them, if possible.\n\n\nYou can find more reading about it here.\n\nA: Disks\nTo check for bad sectors check the SMART data, probably the best accessible by launching the Disks utility (Palimpsest). Even if you don't see any bad blocks there, launch a self-test to be sure.\nThe program is bundled in the gnome-disk-utility package. Run gksudo gnome-disks\n\nOr in Ubuntu 16.04 version (3.18):\n\nBadblocks\nYou can also use badblocks\nsudo badblocks -sv /dev/sda\n\nto just check, or to check and fix first write the result to a temporary file:\nsudo badblocks -sv /dev/sda  > bad-blocks-result\nsudo fsck -t ext4 -l bad-blocks-result /dev/sda1\n\nwill check the whole disk and print out all bad blocks encountered on /dev/sda.\nFrom badblocks manual:\n\nImportant note: If the output of badblocks is going to be fed to the e2fsck or mke2fs programs, it is important that the block size is properly specified, since the block numbers which are generated are very dependent on the block size in use by  the  filesystem.  For this reason, it is strongly recommended that users not run badblocks directly, but rather use the -c option of the e2fsck and mke2fs programs.\n\nfsck\nfsck itself will not help you find bad sectors, worse still, if there are a lot of bad sectors it can damage your data even more. Use it only when the disk is healthy.\n\nA: F3 (Fight Flash Fraud) is another option which should additionally detect fake flash drives (flash drives whose actual capacity is a fraction of advertised capacity):\n\n\n*\n\n*Install F3\nsudo apt install f3\n\n\n*Insert your drive\n\n*Write test data to the free space on the drive (check where your drive is mounted with lsblk)\nf3write /media/$USER/D871-DD7C/\n\n\n*Read the test data\nf3read /media/$USER/D871-DD7C/\n\nReference:\n\n\n*\n\n*f3 documentation site\n\n*Source code\nBadblocks works well but it isn't designed for detecting fake flash drives and may not report any errors for them.\n", "Q: DV6325us and AR9002wb-1ng I have recently added an Atheros AR9002wb-1ng WiFi combo card to my HP Pavilion Dv6325us laptop.

I would like ssh, sudo su and umount /home and run diagnostic on it.  Is there a runlevel I can used to close X and other process using /home while keeping network access?  Or another way?\nthanks\n\nA: First, log out all user manually, then ssh with root.\nUse \"lsof | grep home\" to find remaining process that use /home and kill them all.\nYou can umount.\n\nA: /home is only typically in use when users are logged in.  The root user has a /root home specifically so the root user is not dependent upon additional mount points.\nEnable root SSH login\nFor Ubuntu this means you need to give root a password in order to login via ssh:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo#Enabling the root account\nConsider that the root account may be disabled from SSH access by default, verify the setting in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:\nPermitRootLogin yes\n\nLogoff users and prevent new logins\nTo kick users off in a multi-user environment one would normally change to the single-user run level 1.

It defaults to 1 which would explain this behaviour (you're single threaded so no number of backends will change anything).\nTry setting it to 4, or even 8, in the nginx config file.

Apt-pinning or changing the dependencies in the deb package might be a better way.\n\nA: It is not possible without hacking in some way into the package management system, I think.\nThe reason is that logwatch declare postfix, or alternatively mail-transport-agent, as a dependency, and not as a recommend.

I've created a package which contains 32-bit libraries for compatibility with 32-bit applications on 64-bit systems, stored in /usr/lib32. This causes the ia32-libs dependency being added to my package. However, the package works perfectly fine without those libraries as other 32-bit programs should install ia32-libs themselves.\nHow do I prevent the build process from generating the ia32-libs dependency? nvidia-current seems to able to do this too, but uses CDBS which I do not use. (I use a plain rules file as generated by dh_make)\n\nA: Removal of the ia32-libs dependency is explicitly covered in the Debian Multiarch Implementation guide:\nhttp://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/Implementation\nWhich basically means if there are certain dpkg tools that are emitting too many packages when specifying multiarch then it is a tool bug and now is a good time to file a report.\n\nA: To make debhelper ignore the 32-bit libraries, I had to add a target for ignoring paths containing /usr/lib32:\noverride_dh_shlibdeps:\n    dh_shlibdeps --exclude=/usr/lib32\n\nAfter that, the ia32-libs dependencies would not be calculated anymore.

Any idea, how i can do this in this new version of Ubuntu?\n\nA: This, in a terminal:\ncat /vmlinuz | padsp tee /dev/dsp > /dev/null\n\nUbuntu uses PulseAudio as its sound server (before I think ALSA's dmix was used, I believe. I don't remember.)\npadsp is a PulseAudio tool that wraps /dev/dsp to PulseAudio.\nThe oss-compat package, as suggested by MrShunz, enables ALSA's OSS compatibility layer, so it has to go through ALSA to get to PulseAudio which finally uses ALSA to access the sound device. So:\noss-compat: OSS->ALSA->PulseAudio->ALSA\npadsp: OSS->PulseAudio->ALSA\n\npadsp is also already installed by default, I think. If it isn't though, bash will tell you which package contains it :)\n\nA: Newer versions of alsa have the sound devices under the directory /dev/snd/.

How do I display the menu bar of VirtualBox?\nFunctions like cdrom, usb, etc need access to the menu bars to work.\n\n\nA: On Windows XP and Windows 7, as of Aug 2014, there's more to the story. To bring up the menu, and to be able to access all items on the menu:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're in scale mode, disable that with Host+c.\n\n*Bring up the menu by pressing Host+Home.\n\n*That will display the first of several menus. To get to additional menus, press the right arrow key.\n\n\nA: To return ownership of keyboard and mouse to your host operating system, VirtualBox reserves a special key on your keyboard for itself: the \"host key\". By default, it is the right Control key on your keyboard on a windows machine and left Command key on a Mac.\n\nA: I was tearing out my hair until I noticed that Ubuntu 16.04 puts menus not on the window but at the top of the screen (status?) bar. I didn't have the window maximized because I did not want to see excess white space, so the window has a bar also and that is where I was looking.  :) noob moment of the day for sure.\n\nA: Because you're in scale mode which causes it to be hidden.\nHost + C is the toggle for scale mode (where Host is Right Control by default)\n\nA: I came here to find an solution and suddenly had the hunch that something was interfering with the guest window processing host keys.  I turned out that I enabled the \"Show postion of pointer when the Control key is pressed\" checkbox.  Disabling it fixed the problem and now I can switch from scale mode to full screen and seamless mode. Also have the mini menu back :)\n\nA: I faced the same issue on my macbook pro and I found a solution:\n\nA dirty workaround if using Ubuntu is to shut down all VirtualBox, and then edit the ~/.VirtualBox/VirtualBox.xml file. Find the line\n<ExtraDataItem name=\"GUI/Toolbar\" value=\"false\"/>\n\nand change the value to true.\nIf any process were still running when edited the file, the changes will most likely be gone once the processes update the file.\n\n(Source)\nIn case you don't find this line (like in my case) simply add this line.\nOn OS X you can find VirtualBox.xml in /Users/<username>/Library/VirtualBox dir.\n\nA: Weird.. but you want to also make sure the menu has the proper options selected. so by.\n\n\n*\n\n*going back to the Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager, \n\n*right click your virtual machine, go to setting\n\n*then go down to user interface.\n\n*make sure all your menu options are highlighted blue. \n\n\nmake sure the options look like this.\n\n\n\n*hit apply and/or ok (cant remember which one)\n\n*go back to your virtual machine, press Ctrl + home\n\n*use the arrow keys to go down to view then select show menu bar.\n\n\nsolved.\ndo note.. if u don't see the menu after pressing Ctrl + home. try pressing ctrl + c then ctrl + home. \n\nA: Sooo... First use \"Host\"+\"Home\" buttons, next go to \"view\" --> \"Full screen mode\" --> now you are in the full screen mode and you have to escape from full screen mode and you will see the top menu bar. :)\n\nA: CTRL+C or CTRL+F won't work if the machine is paused. \nYou have to press CTRL+P to unpause, if the menu is hidden.\n", "Q: Find duplicate files and folders and move these to a different folder \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to find (and delete) duplicate files \n\nIs there a reliable duplicate file/folders utility, (with GUI) for Linux that can find duplicate files or folders and move them to different folder?\n\nA: fdupes\nNo GUI but fdupes  / sudo apt-get install fdupes is very fast and reliable.

So no crashes, I will probably use the ATI/AMD sites 1 again to see if it crashes, then post the log. \nUPDATE\nI just rebooted from a crash, this time, I am using Open Source drivers. \nLast \"few\" lines of Xorg.0.log on pastie\nSame for syslog\nMaybe its not a graphics or driver thing? Can it be something else? How can I troubleshoot?\nUPDATE 2\nIt might also be Unity? I installed a \"bare\" Ubuntu 11.04 system via Alternate CD then install the packages. While using Ubuntu Classic, all seemed well. Then I switched to Unity, it appeared not to work with the defuault dirivers then things start going wrong ... also see below ... Whats with the super dark shadows and artifacts with the launcher?\n\n\nA: yes, the proprietary drivers are very bad. Actually, they've been responsible for 100% of freezes I've experienced on Ubuntu for the last two years since I got my Radeon HD5850. But luckily, the open drivers are now very good. They are much faster than the proprietary drivers, very much more stable and they seem to provide a similar set of features. Since they're open, you also don't need to update them manually anymore. \nIn 11.04, I have had a few minor draw issues with it in Unity, but except for that, it's been very good and stable. In 11.10, which goes into Beta 1 tomorrow, I haven't had a single issue. I've been told that AMD now has people working full time on the open driver. I haven't been able to verify that, but the rapid progress they've suddenly made, makes that seem probable. It's a very good thing if it's true, because they make really good hardware, and it's been very annoying that they've had so poor drivers. The bonus for us users of Ubuntu, is that it makes new releases of Ubuntu feel extra fast and good :)\nBy the kernel, you seem to be running 11.04 and I would strongly recommend that you try using xserver-xorg-video-radeon instead of the proprietary drivers. The issues I've had are very small. Some white dots on the dash is all. This is based on my experiences with the Radeon HD5850, of course, but I've been told that other cards in the 5-series, as well as newer cards also work very well. I'd appreciate it if you leave a comment with your experiences. I'll also add the 11.04 tag to your question to make it easier for others to find your question. \nUpdate: no doubt, Unity will provoke more driver problems than Ubuntu Classic, since it makes much heavier use on Compiz. I personally could never get the proprietary drivers to work well with Unity. The open drivers also caused some issues, but they were minor compared to the ones caused by the proprietary drivers. I've never had crashes like you've had though. I've had to re-run compiz in order to fix minor issues, but nothing worse than that. But we don't have exactly the same hardware, so... What I can say, is that it's improving and that in Oneiric, I have no issues at all. So, all in all, it seems to me that AMD is making large improvements in this area. \n\nA: The ATI drivers are awfull, you might try the free drivers. Two years ago the close-source driver was better (well... less bad) but by now the mesa drivers are really improved.\nAlso, you should try the free drivers from xorg-edgers, they're experimental but more stable than the amd's.\n\nA: It's a problem with proprietary drivers, sorry but u can't use them, instead, try the latest Xorg drivers, here is the ppa: https://edge.launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa\nTo install them do:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-add-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\n*sudo apt-get update\n\n*sudo apt-get upgrade\n", "Q: Reload bash's .profile without logging out and back in again Is it possible to coerce bash to reload the .profile file without logging out and back in again?\n\nA: This should work for the current terminal:\n. ~/.profile\n\n. is a bash builtin and a synonym for source, see man bash:\n\n.  filename [arguments]\n  source filename [arguments]\n       Read  and  execute  commands  from filename in the current shell environment (…).\n\n\nA: If you don't want to start a new shell but execute the script in the current shell, you source it:\nsource script_name.sh\n\nsource = .\nThe Bash source built-in is a synonym for the Bourne shell .

It's entering Beta 1 on Thursday. In any case, it doesn't hurt to download and boot a live session and see how you like it.

However, to clean the contents of ~/ itself is a bit more complex, and I will update my answer if I find a safe way to do that.\n\nA: You can safely remove all files in the home directory, because they are recreated, apart from files copied on user creation from /etc/skel, so\n#!/bin/bash\n\nshopt -s dotglob \nrm -rf /home/username/*\nsudo -u username cp -a /etc/skel/* /home/username/\n\nwhere username should be substituted with something meaningful.\nPer your request (\"when computer starts\") this can be executed from /etc/rc.local. More likely, you want to execute it between each to logins, so put it under /etc/gdm/PostSession or /etc/gdm/PreSession.\n\nA: You could do something like\n#!/bin/bash\n\nrm -rf /home/Guest/Desktop/*\nrm -rf /home/Guest/Documents/*\nrm -rf /home/Guest/Downloads/*\nrm -rf /home/Guest/Music/*\nrm -rf /home/Guest/Pictures/*\nrm -rf /home/Guest/Videos/*\n\nSave this as something like cleanup.sh and make it executable with chmod +x cleanup.sh. Then you can call ./cleanup. Note that this removes everything in these folders, use with care.

After refusing to uninstall my drivers it then it suggests I try going here to http://askubuntu.com\nOther than asking this question I see no other solution, so I guess my question is:\nWhat the heck am I supposed to do a proper bug report or get a solution to my never ending issues with Kubuntu and KDE 4's Plasma and especially Activities?\n\nA: The Package you would want to run the Ubuntu-Bug script against is plasma-desktop so th full command would be\nubuntu-bug plasma-desktop\n\nyou can run this command from a terminal or by pressing alt+f2 and pasting the command in the text box.\nIf you find a bug matching yours you can add yourself bay marking that this bug affects you too or starting a new bug if none match your circumstances and give information that it is the Activities plasmoid that is causing the crash/freeze. Obviously you will need to set up an account in launchpad first before reporting the bug. \n", "Q: Disable \"middle click to lower window\" behaviour on gnome I am using the Chromium web browser, and standard gnome (i.e. not unity). Chromium (like lots of things) has many tabs, and allows you to middle click on a tab to close the tab. But if I middle click on the blue part outside the tab, then it lowers the window underneath all the other windows. However I often find myself attempting to middle click on a tab to close it, and accidentally middle clicking outside the tab (which is the title bar in chromium), and hence accidentally lowering the window.\nHow do I disable this \"middle click to lower window\" behaviour?\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu Tweak and there should be a setting for it.\nYou can also get at it through gconf-editor. Go to apps > metacity > general > action_middle_click_titlebar and set it to \"none\". This value, \"none\", is case sensitive.\n\nA: I'll assume that you are using GNOME Shell. You can change this setting using a tool called gnome-tweak-tool, which appears as \"Advanced Settings\" in the activities overview.\nFirst, install gnome-tweak-tool using Software Center.\nOnce it is installed, go to the Activities overview, type \"Advanced Settings,\" and open the application that appears.\nYou can configure lots of things in this tool, but the one you're interested in is in the Windows section on the left side. Click that, and change \"Action on title bar middle-click\" to whatever you want.\n\n\nA: This works for Chromium:\ngconftool-2 --type string --set /apps/metacity/general/action_middle_click_titlebar \"none\"\n\n\nA: In case anyone wants to turn this on, there's a bug affecting it on recent Cinnamon. See https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=777821. \nThe work around:\nManually create a .config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini with:\n[Settings]\ngtk-titlebar-middle-click=lower\n\nThen restart chrome with chrome://restart\n\nA: For 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) it could be disabled with the command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences action-middle-click-titlebar 'none'\n\nRestore original state:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences action-middle-click-titlebar 'lower'\n\nAlso, the following variants are possible:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences action-middle-click-titlebar 'toggle-shade'\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences action-middle-click-titlebar 'maximize'\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences action-middle-click-titlebar 'toggle-maximize-horizontally'\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences action-middle-click-titlebar 'toggle-maximize-vertically'\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences action-middle-click-titlebar 'minimize'\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences action-middle-click-titlebar 'shade'\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences action-middle-click-titlebar 'menu'\n\nBut the bug is still there, option from the Google Chrome Settings \"Use system title bar and borders\" could lower the impact...\n\nA: As of Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS this problem is solved using $ gnome-tweaks window/middle and just clicking to none.\n", "Q: Theming or changing colors for Nautilus? I've got a dark theme for emacs and I use white-on-black for my terminal; to match the color scheme I have going, I'd like to make Nautilus also white-on-black. Is it possible to theme Nautilus or otherwise change the color scheme?\nThanks!\n\nA: Yes. You can create a custom nautilus.rc (for GTK+ 2.x) or nautilus.css (for GTK+ 3.x).\nUnfortunately I do not have a link or instructions on exactly how to theme it, but there are a few themes out there that have these files inside (such as Ambiance and Radiance), and if you take a look at how their definitions for Nautilus are structured, you should be able to work it out pretty easily.\n\nA: Since nautilus is gtk, it will use the same theme as the rest of the gnome applications, so you can search for a theme than you like.\nThe only thing I can think if you don't want to change the gtk theme in the rest of apps, onlyfor nautilus, is create an script than launches nautilus whit a diferent theming:\nFor example, I use ultimate edition theme in all my gnome, but I don't like how it looks in firefox, so I made a script called \"firefox\" and put it inside my $HOME/.scripts directory. The script contains just this:\n#!/bin/bash\nenv GTK2_RC_FILES=/usr/share/themes/New\\ Wave\\ Dark\\ Menus/gtk-2.0/gtkrc /usr/bin/firefox \"$@\"\n\nNow you'll have to make a script called nautilus, and change the word firefox in the script for the route to nautilus executable. And of course change the \"New\\ Dark\\ Menus for the name of a theme you like for nautilus and you have installed in /usr/share/themes\nOne thing, if the name of the theme contains spaces, you have to put \\ before each space so the script recognize the route.\nWish it helps\nEDIT:\nI forgot to say. If you want to launch that script manually you'll need only to call it, in the directory where it is like this:\nFirst you allow it to run (just needed the first time:\nchmod +x nautilus\n\nRun it:\n./nautilus\n\nBut if you want to run nautilus with this script by default, you'll need to create a folder where to put your scripts, save it inside and define that folder as your personal script path:\nmkdir .scripts\n\nCopy the nautilus script inside and give it permisions with \nchmod +x .scripts/nautilus\n\nSet $HOME/.scripts as a PATH:\necho \"PATH=$HOME/.scripts:$PATH\" >> .bash_profile\n\nThis way, every time nautilus is started it will be started for your personal script.\n\nA: You can change the colour of the main panel by opening edit -> backgrounds and emblems and dragging  a colour to the main panel\n\nA: Gnome has a program called Gnome Tweaks to configure Gnome.\nGnome Tweaks allows, among other things, to change the theme. There is a Advaita-dark theme available by default.\nPlease note that this changes the theme of all the OS, not only Nautilus.\nIt's possible to install new themes. Here are some examples.\n", "Q: cursor stops in the middle after pressing home key In terminal i've changed my PS1. \nI think it maybe causing issues with allowing me to hit the home button. Normally by hitting the home button it's suppose to return to the first character on the first line\nmy prompt file: https://raw.github.com/chrisjlee/dotfiles/master/.prompt\n# Setup color Variables\n#############################\nSTARTFGCOLOR='\\e[0;36m'\nSTARTBGCOLOR=\"\\e[0;32m\"\nENDCOLOR=\"\\e[0m\"\n\nexport PS1=\"\\e[0;36m\\n[ $STARTFGCOLOR$STARTBGCOLOR\\u@\\h\\e[01;35m \\w $STARTBGCOLOR$STARTFGCOLOR]\\e[0;32m\\n\\e[0;35m]$ $ENDCOLOR\"\n\nWhenever i redo the last command (by hitting the up button in terminal) and hit the home button it'll stop halfway. And then the characters will not read correctly\nHas anyone else have this issue?\n\nA: You have to wrap every color code in escaped square brackets like this: \\[colorcode\\].\nExample:\nSTARTFGCOLOR='\\[\\e[0;36m\\]'\nSTARTBGCOLOR=\"\\[\\e[0;32m\\]\"\nENDCOLOR=\"\\[\\e[0m\\]\"\n\nExplanation: bash has to calculate the length of the prompt so it can place the cursor correctly when you press home. For whatever reason bash does not consider color codes as taking no space on screen. You have to explicitly tell bash that the color codes do not take up space by wraping them in escaped square brackets.\nSee here for more explanation.\n", "Q: Cannot enable desktop effects on a Thinkpad X220 My environment is as follows:\nLaptop: Thinkpad X220, Intel HD graphics family(i915).\nDual-OS: Windows 7 professional, Ubuntu 10.10.\nMy problem is I cannot enable the desktop effects.\nI have installed the xserver-xorg-video-intel using this commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:glasen/intel-driver\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel\n\nand reboot.\nHowever, when I attempted to enable the desktop effects, it displayed \"searching available drivers\", \"desktop effects cannot enabled\".\nWhen I opened the \"Additonal Drivers\", there was no corresponding video driver available.\nWho can tell me whether there is a trick when install or load the Intel i915 driver on Ubuntu 10.10 or not? Thanks a lot. \n\nA: Also, try running:\nglxinfo | grep direct\n\nYou shoul'd see an output telling you Direct rendering: yes\nOtherwise, your graphic card is not being properly detected.\n", "Q: How do I convert LVM partitions to NTFS/Ext? I have an LVM partition that is split into /projects (500 GB) and /backup (1.5 TB). I cannot mount it because it was on a root machine that crashed. How can I restore the data without do LVM to Ubuntu harddrive?\n\nA: This is pretty well documented in the LVM howtos and elsewhere. Just move the disks to a system with LVM, reassemble the volume group, activate the LVs, and backup like you normally would. I don't see what NTFS has to do with it, unless you're trying to accomplish this from a Windows host. There are drivers out there that can add LVM support to Windows though I've never tried them.\n", "Q: Installation from USB flash drive froze after boot I am trying to install Ubuntu 11.04 on a computer that has Windows on it.\nI created an USB stick with Ubuntu's utility included on the live CD and the restarted and booted from USB.\nAfter i get the line below printed on the screen and nothing happens:\n\nSYSLINUX 3.82 2009-06-09 EBIOS Copyright (C) 1994-2009 H.

I got a new Lenovo Thinkpad. I'm preparing to install Ubuntu on the computer. The BIOS settings give me the choice of setting it to \"UEFI-only\" or \"Legacy.\" I'd prefer to use UEFI-only because it's supposed to allow faster boot.  But I don't know how well Ubuntu supports UEFI. Which setting is advisable?\n\nA: Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty) supports booting from UEFI as explained by this Ubuntu community wiki.\n\n\"From Ubuntu 11.04 onwards (x86_64 only), the ISO CD supports UEFI booting and the Ubuntu installer will try to setup the bootloader got (U)EFI boot.\"\n\nIf you are dual booting with Windows - make sure you are using Windows Vista (SP1 + 64bit) as the minimum.\n\nA: *\n\n*If you already have an OS (eg Windows) installed in EFI mode, you must leave your BIOS in EFI mode.\n\n*If you already have an OS (eg Windows) installed in Legacy mode, you must leave your BIOS in Legacy mode.\n\n*Else, you can install Ubuntu in whatever mode you want. You can even try both modes and check if one is faster than the other.\nOther remarks:\n\n\n*\n\n*EFI is best supported by recent 64bits (amd64 ISO) versions of Ubuntu, such as 12.04.\n\n*you can convert an installed Ubuntu from EFI mode to Legacy mode (or contrary) via Boot-Repair's Separate /boot/efi option.\n\n", "Q: How do I make noatime mounts default? I'm making an Ubuntu derivative, and I want to make noatime the default mount option for all filesystems (instead of relatime which is default in Ubuntu).\nThere seems to be a boolean default_relatime kernel parameter for switching between defaulting to atime or relatime (also available by writing to /proc/sys/kernel/default_relatime), but I can't find an equivalent for noatime and I don't know how to enable that in a distro by default.\nHow to configure to record data to pendrive instantly? suggests that there's a way to add noatime mount parameter via udev, but I have no idea if that will work for internal media and how to do it.\nWhat's the least invasive way to make the kernel default to noatime?\nCurrent default can be viewed using \"cat /proc/mounts\" because it shows even implicit mount parameters; don't trust \"mount\".\nYes, I've read Is it worth to tune Ext4 with noatime? and I still want to do it.\n\nA: The kernel used to have a config option for whether to use ATIME or RELATIME; dunno if that also included some option for NOATIME.  In any case, that's gone now.\nI studied util-linux as well, to see if the mount command had configurable defaults or could be modified, but it did not appear to be the case.\nHowever, it looks like you can patch the kernel to change the default behavior.  Modify ./fs/namespace.c, around lines 2334:\nlong do_mount(...)\n...\n    /* Default to relatime unless overriden */\n    if (!(flags & MS_NOATIME))\n            mnt_flags |= MNT_RELATIME;\n...\n\nSwap that around:\nlong do_mount(...)\n...\n    /* Default to noatime unless overriden */\n    if (!(flags & MS_RELATIME))\n            mnt_flags |= MNT_NOATIME;\n...\n\nAnd that should do it.\n", "Q: How to install google earth?

There is not much we can do to check the quality of those packages but if you trust the source, you can try these alternatives for package installation.\nA \"bad quality package\" most probably does not affect your overall system stability or break your system. This is even less so when you trust your source. There even is a list maintained by Debian that shows occurences of Lintian tags in packages from the Debian archives.\nNevertheless it is a good idea to find out what exactly is wrong before we install such a package.

I've been playing with Ubuntu Oneiric on my netbook (where breakage isn't really a concern); I like the new lightdm login screen, but it has one minor annoyance: in addition to my own user account, there's another account for occasional use by my girlfriend, and her user account is the one that's always focused (presumably because it's first alphabetically).  \nI know how to fix this in gdm but haven't found a solution for lightdm.

I figure this is a standard setting for a printer, but when I save as a PDF I prefer the background colors to stay. How can this be done?\n\nA: Firstly, I'm not sure it has any relation to Ubuntu... :)\nSecondly, there may not be a good generic way to save a website page to PDF while keeping the background - think of pagination, page numbering, titles etc. Think of white text on dark background. In many cases the results won't look good - that's why browsers fall back to white background. Also, many sites use separate stylesheets for printing, which additionally remove elements which are not needed on paper - navigation, menus etc.\nWhat you need is a way to make a screenshot of the whole page - this will preserve all detais of the page how you see it. There are plugins for Firefox to do this - I suppose there may be something for Chrome too.\nThe Firefox plugin I used is called Screengrab \n\n", "Q: How can I protect my data when lending my computer to someone? I'm going to lend an old PC with dual boot (Ubuntu and Win XP) to a friend for few days.\nUbuntu contains a lot of data that I want to keep confidential.\nI have protected my session with a strong password.\nIs that enough to keep my data confidential?\nI have heard that booting from a live CD can give access to the installed data; is that true?\n\nA: You are correct. Someone could still access your data through a livecd. You should take a look into encrypting your home directory. They ask you to do it when you install ubuntu but you can also do it after the fact. Here is some information to help you: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedHome\nThe information on that page is good for Ubuntu 8.10 and newer.\nBasically you need to do this\n1) Make sure you have ecryptfs-utils (sudo apt-get install ecryptfs-utils)\n2) Add a new user with an encrypted home - (sudo adduser --encrypt-home)\nIf you have any more questions or run into problems just reply :)\n", "Q: \"no such file to load -- zlib\" error when installing a gem When I decided to install gem in ubuntu yesterday ( with this command : sudo gem install algorithms ) , bash gave me an error. How can I install gem in ubuntu like that installing on windows ?\n************** This is a screenshot from my Terminal ********************\n\n\nthanks\n\nA: \"No such file to load -- zlib\" - gem cannot be installed because it needs library dependency to be installed first. In this case:\nsudo apt-get install zlib1g zlib1g-dev\n\nThen try to install the algorithms gem again, it should work.\n\nA: If you could put the error message here, it will much easier to get help.\nRight now, I have to guess, did you installed RubyGems already?\nAfter that you may also need doing \nsudo gem update --system\n\nBasically you need install zlib first, and using rvm to remove and re-install Ruby. I remembered I did using rvm to install Ruby on Rails last time on Ubuntu 10.04 as well.\nIn a ideal world, apt should be the one stop shop for every package and will automatically\nresolve dependency for you. But it probably will never working that way, unless your package management could compile for you as well when necessary. Gentoo handle Ruby installation slightly better without need rvm to manage Ruby and then Gems manage gems. But using Gentoo to install  Gems is not easier either. \nI always thinking Ubuntu or other Linux package manager systems like Portage is much ore better than what Windows have, but in the case of install Ruby Gems Linux doesn't seems any significant simpler or better.\n\nA: Ah, thanks for the screenshot. Not being snarky, just saving space. I believe your answer is in another thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/769496/ubuntu-noob-rails-install-fails-on-zlib\n\nA: This should be solved by following the instructions here (Link takes you to a Ask Ubuntu answer) and then trying to install the gem again.\n\nA: Install rvm on you ubuntu and install  ruby 1.9.2 or any. then you can create a gemset with\nrvm 1.9.2@blabla --create\n\nand run gem install algorithms\n", "Q: Installing/executing .bin file \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I install a .bin file? \n\nI have a .bin file called file.bin and I am new to ubuntu and I am trying to figure out how to install it.\nWhat is the proper command to run via Terminal?\nI have tried:\n./file.bin - reports error \"Directory does not exist\"\n\nand  \nsudo ./file.bin - nothing happens at all with this command.\n\nHow do I execute this binary?\n\nA: Go to the directory where you have your file (say file.bin) and ensure the permissions will allow you to run it:\nchmod u+x file.bin\n\nThen run it with either of:\n./file.bin\nsudo ./file.bin\n\nYou may alternatively have to use something like:\nbash file.bin\n\nYou should refer to the installation instructions.

I don't want to connect with to the GUI (rdesktop) - instead I want to connect to Windows PowerShell from the terminal.\nThis is because I want to administer the Windows machine similarly to how you can administer a headless Linux server: running background jobs, writing shell scripts to perform daily/weekly remote maintenance, shutting down/logging off thru shell scripts.\nWill rlogin work, and if so how? If not, what other options are there?\n\nA: There's a commercial proprietary tool called PowerShell SSH Server (read TechNet description) that will let you log in over SSH.\nThere's also a free proprietary tool freeSSHd - you can run it and replace the standard cmd command shell with PowerShell.\nFinally, if you'd prefer a free software (open source) solution, you can install the Cygwin SSH server and run PowerShell under that. (Apparently this is slower.)\n\nA: You can also use WinSSHD from Bitvise and set the Terminal shell for each allowed user as \"powershell.exe\".\n", "Q: Share files between Ubuntu 11.04 and 10.04 over LAN I have one desktop wired to router running Ubuntu 10.04 and a laptop running 11.04 connected wireless to the same router, both accessing internet.\nHow do I share files between these machines?\nI have enabled share for folders in the desktop(10.04), but error 255 in laptop(11.04)\nSAMBA installed in both machines\n\nA: If you're only using Ubuntu or other free operating systems, then I would recommend installing http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/openssh-server. Just install it on both machines. You don't have to configure the service in any way. Then, on the client in Nautilus, select File > Connect to service.. In that dialog, choose the SSH protocol, provide username and password. You can choose to remember the password for one connection, for the desktop session or forever. If you're on a local network, then you can just use hostname.local as address (for instance, mypc.local). If you're on the internet (because SSH supports that in a secure way) you can enter the IP address.\nNow you can use folders on the other PC as if they were local. You can also remote control it using that server, so it's useful in other cases too. \n", "Q: How do I open an .eml file in Evolution? Open EML extension mail file in evolution.if anybody sent mail from outook to evolution not able to open the file please help\n\nA: Evolution will not display such thing inline, and it will rely on the environment to open the file. Try downloading the file outside of Evolution. That should present you with a dialog where you can choose which application should handle that file type. Evolution should then use that application to open it. \n", "Q: Internet Dropping out on Toshiba Qosmio x505 I'm helping a friend with installing Ubuntu on his Toshiba Qosmio x505 64-bit laptop (natively runs Windows 7 64-bit).

At work, I get very buggy behaviour, such as full screen applications 'ghosting' when maximized, and other strange effects. I would like to try and completely reset the monitor configurations (not unity or compiz), before doing anything else. In 10.10 this would be accomplished:\ndpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\n\n\nA: If you think it's some user preferences settings, then you can create a new user \"temp\", login as a \"temp\" and see if it's ok. \nYou can also try xrandr --auto.\n", "Q: Event registration on loco.ubuntu.com On Planet Ubuntu there was a post asking RSVP to an Ubuntu Jam organized by the Californian LoCo.

(including password input) I am using Truecrypt to secure my data and am obliged to use Dropbox for some file sharing. I've set up my Dropbox folder on the Truecrypt mount.\nWhen I log in Dropbox throws an error, because the Dropbox folder doesn't exist yet. I then have to mount the folder and restart Dropbox.\nIs there any way that I can script the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*start Truecrypt, prompting to mount favorite volumes\n\n*\n\n*cannot set a time for this as it's based on user input (I have to enter my admin password and Truecrypt password, and I must admit that sometimes I get distracted and make coffee while doing this)\n\n\n*only when volume is mounted, start Dropbox\n\n*options to do this automatically (on login) and manually\n\n\nA: You can add a script to delay Dropbox from starting up - the link to a dropbox forum question with the answer is here\n\nA: iwatch is a commandline tool to allow you to monitor and respond to filesystem events using the inotify subsystem.  I'm not sure which event would be best but I would guess that some filesystem event occurs when a filesystem is mounted.\n\nA: I had to do something quite similar. Here is what I ended up doing:\n\n\n*\n\n*remove Dropbox auto start feature of course\n\n*have Ubuntu auto start the following script:\n#!/bin/bash\n#First let's check DB isn't running, you never know\ntest \"`dropbox status | awk '{print $2}'`\" == \"isn't\" || exit;\n#mount private\ntruecrypt --mount #you may optionally indicate which container you wish to mount\n#wait for truecrypt\nwhile test ! -d /media/truecrypt1/Dropbox\ndo\n    sleep 1\ndone;\n#start DB\ndropbox start\n\n\nA: Maybe you can parse to df output to discover if the volume is mounted. My Bash-foo is quite feeble, so here is a python script that should do it:\n#! /usr/bin/python\n# *-*coding=utf-8*-*\n\n\"\"\"Try to start dropbox after some volume is mounted\"\"\"\n\nimport os\nimport time\n\nMOUNT_POINT = \"/home/javier/Private\"\n\nmounted = False\nwhile not mounted:\n    f = os.popen(\"df\")\n    for line in f:\n        if MOUNT_POINT in line:\n            mounted = True\n    f.close()\n    if not mounted:\n        time.sleep(3000)\nos.system('dropbox start')\n\nYou should change MOUNT_POINT to anything that df will output only when the volume is mounted.\nI add a more pythonic way of doing it, but harder to port to bash and less flexible, it will need the real mount point.\n#! /usr/bin/python\n# *-*coding=utf-8*-*\n\n\"\"\"Try to start dropbox after some volume is mounted\"\"\"\n\nimport os\nimport time\n\nMOUNT_POINT = \"/home/javier/Private\"\n\nmounted = False\nwhile not mounted:\n    if os.path.ismount(MOUNT_POINT):\n        mounted = True\n    else:\n        time.sleep(3000)\nos.system('dropbox start')\n\n\nA: You could try the following batch script. I use this in some of my own scripts that require some pieces I keep within a truecrypt container. Just throw the following in a .bat file. You will have to update some of the code depending on where you store your files and what not.\n@echo off\n\nIF EXIST \"Z:\\\" (goto startDropBox)\n\"C:\\Path\\To\\Truecrypt\\truecrypt.exe\" /v C:\\Path\\To\\Truecrypt\\Volume /lz /a /q\n\n:startDropBox\nC:\\Path\\To\\DropBox\\Executable\\Dropbox.exe\n\nThe code assumes you always mount your volume on drive Z. From my experience, the code should hang at the truecrypt log-on screen before proceeding to the next part (running the dropbox executable). \nTo run this at startup, you could try replacing the dropbox shortcut in your startup folder with this batch file and you could run this manually if you wanted as well.\nFor other command line switches with Truecrypt look here:\nhttp://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=command-line-usage\nHope that helps!\nEDIT: Just realized this was an ubuntu forum, my bad! But could be nice for wandering Windows users quickly hides\n\nA: The script should be something like this:\nFirst, create it in your home. Added a dot at the beggining so it will be a hidden file:\ngedit .dropboxdelayed\n\nThen, paste this inside:\n#!/bin/sh\n#dropboxdelayed()\nsleep 20 &&\ndropbox start -i &\n\n20 is the number of secconds of delay, don't know how much does truecrypt to mount your encrypted data so you should try it and adapt the number.\nGive it permision to run:\nchmod +x .dropboxdelayed\n\nAnd create an entry pointing to it in System>Startup applications (remember to disable the other Dropbox entry there or you will be running two instances of it at the same time).\nWhish it helps.\n", "Q: Assign multiple keyboard shortcuts for one action I've been wondering how can I assign to multiple keyboard shortcuts to do the same action?\nMore specifically, I want to be able to change my volume with both my headset buttons and my keyboard.\nI'm able to change the volume with just one at the time: with the one I define in the 'Keyboard shortcuts' application.\nIs there any way?\n\nA: You can assign multiple keyboard shortcuts (keybindings) for the same command using gsettings command line.\nOne important thing to know is that Ubuntu 18.04 Settings GUI only shows the first keybinding for a command, so if you have multiple keybindings for a command, the others won't appear in Settings. You can use gsettings to all the keybindings.\nLet's say I want to add another keybinding for \"Switch to Workspace 1\". The default for me was Super+Home, but I want to add a second keybinding Ctrl+1.\n# list all keybindings\ngsettings list-recursively | grep -e org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings -e org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys -e org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power | sort \n\n# confirm no other keybinding conflicts\ngsettings list-recursively | grep '<Control>1'\n\n# set multiple keybindings for \"Switch to Workspace 1\"\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-1 \"['<Super>Home', '<Control>1']\"\n\n# confirm value is set correctly\ngsettings get org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-to-workspace-1\n\nNow you can use either Super+Home or Control+1 to Switch to Workspace 1. Remember, you will only see the first one Super+Home in the Settings GUI, but it will work!\n\nA: I do just that with Custom Shortcuts:\n\nI use xdotool key --clearmodifiers XF86AudioLowerVolume (and XF86AudioRaiseVolume) command instead of amixer set 'Master' 10%+. The only difference/downside I notice is that even Repeat Keys on Typing tab is set this doesn't apply to this custom shortcut.\nHowever, I wasn't able to do some things like use Fn+F7 to turn off my screen (xset dpms force standby). It doesn't detect it as a shortcut event.\n\nA: You could probably use xmodmap to reassign the buttons on your headset to the same as you use for your keyboard. \n\nA: update for ubuntu 20\n\nhave to say those days, dconf-editor is very easy to use, really nice.\n\n0. preview\n\n\n\n1. location input\nfolder too deep ? copy & paste location.\n\n*\n\n*click title bar \nor\n\n*Ctrl + F\nor\n\n*Ctrl + L\nto active localtion bar input:\n\n/org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/switch-to-workspace-up\n/org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings/switch-to-workspace-down\n\n\n\n2. search in folder\nmany items in folder? search it.\nNOTICE: this is different with Ctrl + F\n\nsearch result:\n\n\n3. bookmark\nmark the location you often use.\n\n\n4. changes\nBefore applying the modifications,\nIt even intimately shows the difference.\n\n\n5. default value\nyou can use default value,\nand keep your changes in setting (but not effective )\n//Refer the previous img.\n\n\n\nIt's awesome, perfect user experience \n", "Q: Ubuntu wont detect my second monitor anymore Is there a way to restart it to its default settings? i've tried everything else\n\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\n\ndoes not work\n\nA: If you are using the default opensource drivers or ati/nvidia drivers then one quick way to reset is simply to move to one-side xorg.conf and then reboot i.e.\nsudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup\n\nYou rarely need to sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg for the latest versions of Ubuntu.\nATI Graphics\nIf you have been playing with ATI graphics installs then deactivate the driver from the Additional Drivers window and then reactivate to reinstall.\nAdditionally run the aticonfig routine to generate a new xorg.conf\naticonfig --initial -f\n\nNVIDIA\nIf you have been playing with NVIDIA graphics installs then deactivate the driver from the Additional Drivers window and then reactivate to reinstall.\nYou can also remove all references to nvidia kernels install via\nsudo apt-get remove nvidia*\n\nThen reinstall the driver from Additional Drivers window.\nAdditionally run the Nvidia routine to generate a new xorg.conf\ngksudo nvidia-settings\n\n\nA: Check your cables.\nI know this is kind of a off-topic answer, but I spent hours blaming linux for the problem, upgrading and downgrading kernels, nvidia drivers, resetting X.\nTurns out the years of linux being terrible with multi-monitor support has coloured my expectations, and once in awhile, a cable just stops working that reliably.\n", "Q: Whereare the shortcut settings for audio/video actions stored?

But note that this directory only exists if you changed any of the values -- keys with their default value (e.g. play = XF86Audioplay) are not stored. Default values for the multimedia keys are stored in a so called schema file (for details see the gconf documentation): \n/usr/share/gconf/schemas/apps_gnome_settings_daemon_keybindings.schemas\n\nThat said: If all you want to do is get the actions associated with a certain keybinding, you should never have to use the files directly. Instead, query the gconf database with a command like this:\ngconftool-2 --get /apps/gnome_settings_daemon/keybindings/play\n\nTo get the default value (and other details about the key), you have to query the schema:\ngconftool-2 --get /schemas/apps/gnome_settings_daemon/keybindings/play\n\n", "Q: dpkg cannot remove package > linux-restricted-modules I'm having a couple of issues with my Ubuntu server currently.

I don't see anything like a verbose switch in the man pages. What does apt-get use for establishing connections? (I assume not wget, because like I said, that works).\n\nA: My first step when having problems getting packages is to choose a new server. Especially when you are having no other connection issues.\nTo do this you need to open the software sources dialogue which is available through the software centre.\nwhen you open this you will see in the middle of the first tab a drop down selection. From this you need to choose other... you should then see a window similar to this\n\nHit the Select Best Server button this will ping all of the servers in the list and choose the closest one for you. Obviously any of the servers which are down will not be selected meaning that which ever is selected will definitely be up.\nIf you are still having problems after this then it is a more serious problem.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How to modify the Firefox homepage in LiveCD for every new user?

The next command finds all .mp3 files in the current directory and its subdirectories, and copies them to the ../TEMP2/ folder, preserving paths:\nfind -iname '*.mp3' -exec install -D {} ../TEMP2/{} \\;\n\n\n\n*\n\n*find -iname '*.mp3' - finds all files ending with .mp3 (case-insensitive) and\n\n*\n\n*-exec - executes a command for each match:\n\n*\n\n*install -D {} ../TEMP2/{} - copies the matched file to ../TEMP/ preserving the path. ({} is replaced by the path including filename)\n\n\n*\\; - ends the -exec command\n\n\n\nIf you want to get the progress, add -ls (\"list\") to the command before -exec. It can be put after \\; too, but in that case the name is shown after being copied. Examples:\nfind -iname '*.mp3' -ls -exec install -D {} ../TEMP2/{} \\;\nfind -iname '*.mp3' -exec install -D {} ../TEMP2/{} \\; -ls\n\n\nA: There are several options, but none is really simple, I'm afraid…\nrsync\nrsync -r --include=\"*/\" --include=\"*.mp3\" --exclude=\"*\" --prune-empty-dirs . ../TEMP2\n\nThis tells to exclude all files (exclude=\"*\"), but to look into all directories (include=\"*/\") and to include all mp3 files (include=\"*.mp3\"). If you do not want to copy directories not containing any mp3 files, in addition the --prune-empty-dirs option is necessary.\nzip\nzip -R archive.zip \"*.mp3\"\nunzip -d ../TEMP2 archive.zip && rm archive.zip\n\nThe first command creates an archive with all mp3 files, the second unzips the content to the target directory and deletes the archive file if it was successful.\nfind\nfind . -iname \"*.mp3\" -exec install -D {} ../TEMP2/{} \";\"\n\nThis will find all mp3 files and copy them to the corresponding path in the ../TEMP2 directory, after creating the directory structure first (install -D).\ncopy all and delete the rest\nThis only makes sense if you have just a few files that you don't want to copy:\ncp -r * ../TEMP2\nfind ../TEMP2 -type f \\! -iname '*.mp3' -delete\n\nThis copies everything and then deletes all files that are not mp3 files\n", "Q: How do I get wifi working on my HP Pavilion dv2000 laptop?

Packages\ni386, ia64, i636, x86_64, i486, amd32, amd64, sparc, powerpc, arm, noarch... am I missing anything?\nProcessors\n\n\n*\n\n*intel - atom, i5, i7\n\n*nvidia - tegra\n\n*amd - 32, 64\nam I missing anything?\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n*\n\n*Can someone help me match the package with the processor?  \n\n*Which processors are 64bit?  \n\n*Can I run 32bit packages on 64bit processors?\n\n\nA: This is a very broad question, I'll try to answer it making groups.\n1.- Big Iron, old architectures, you shouldn't care about them unless you're into them.\n\n\n*\n\n*sparc -> Sun Sparc, a cpu for big iron\n\n*powerpc -> Power PC, you're only likely to find it in old macs.\n\n*ia64 -> Itanium, again you are not going to find this in a PC.\n\n\n2.- Not PC, but a very current and used architecture:\n\n\n*\n\n*arm -> Arm, you will find this CPUs everywhere, from phones and tablets to TVs and routers. But not in what is normally called a PC. The NVidia Tegra is an Arm CPU integrated with a couple of other chips, including a GPU.\n\n\n3.- 32 bits PC architecture, the packages that you should use if you installed Ubuntu 32 bits, but that can also work on 64 bits. Older Atoms (series Z5xx, Z6xx, N2xx and 2xx) are 32 bits CPUs:\n\n\n*\n\n*i386 -> Intel 386 CPU or compatible, includes anything from the last 20 years.\n\n*i686 -> Intel Pentium M, newer and compatible chips. Your usually AMD or Intel chip is going to be able to handle them.\n\n*amd32 -> AMD 32, any processor that you can find today will be able to use that package.\n\n\n4.- 64 bits PC architecture, you can only use this if you have a 64 bits CPU and a 64 bits Ubuntu installed. Most if the Atoms, all i5, i7 and all current AMD processors are here.\n\n\n*\n\n*x86_64 -> Any 64 bits CPU computer, you will need a 64bits cpu (most of the newer ones), and a 64 bit version of Ubuntu installed.\n\n*amd64 -> It's just another name for x86_64.\n\n\n5.- Everyody can use them:\n\n\n*\n\n*noarch -> This packages are usually scripts, files or programs in some interpreted language, they will be useful to any computer.\n\n\nA: You seem to be misunderstanding processor with architecture. A processor is hardware component. An architecture is the \"machine language\" it understands: its set of instructions, registers size, etc.\nSo, different processors, from different families, can \"speak\" the same \"language\", meaning that they understand same binary code and act accordingly. For example, both (ancient) 386 and 486 processors understand i386 code. Pentium introduced some \"extensions\", like MMX, SSE, etc.\nSome processors also understand more than one instruction set, for backwards-compatibility: for example, all modern AMD (and Intel) CPUs are compatible with both i386 and amd64.\nA detailed list of architectures (with links to which processors support them) can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CPU_architectures\nLast but not least, for your last question, the answer would be: yes, you can run 32bit packages in 64bit processors, since most will understand both architectures, as long as your OS is also 32-bit!\n\nA: In general, things ending in \"86\" or \"32\" are 32-bit and things ending in \"64\" are 64 bit.\nSo, i386, i486, x86, i686 and AMD32 are 32-bit. And IA64, x64, x86-64 and AMD64 are 64-bit.\nPowerPC can be 32-bit or 64-bit depending on the model.\nARM is 32-bit.\nSPARC can be either depending on the model.\nProcessors can vary as well. Depending on the model, the Intel Atom processors can either be 32-bit or 64-bit.\nStarting with the Core2 processors, all of Intel's newest processors are 64-bit. This includes the Core i3, i5, i7 series.\nTegra uses ARM, so it's a 32-bit model as well.\nIn general, you can run 32-bit applications on 64-bit processors. The compatibility issue arises with a 64-bit operating system. Ubuntu comes in both 32-bit and 64-bit variants, and not all 32-bit software will run in a 64-bit operating system. Developers often make compatibility packages that you can use. Here is an Ubuntu documentation article discussing the differences between 32-bit and 64-bit on Ubuntu. See the bottom for compatibility options.\n", "Q: How do I remove a package with \"rU\" status? I was trying to install some 32bit libraries with dpkg -i --force-architecture command. But it failed due to dependency problem.\nNow if I try to install 64 bit version of the same library, it says it is already installed. If I try to remove it it says its not installed.\ndpkg-query -l shows that the status is rU for the package.\nI tried dpkg-configure -a, dpkg--reconfigure, apt-get install -f, apt-get clean, apt-get autoclean and basically every possible Google search.\nHow can I get out of this stuck package installation?\n\nA: Multi-arch packages should be suffixed with :arch where arch is i386 or amd64. Try the i386 version of libgtk1.2 by explicitly naming it:\nsudo apt-get purge libgtk1.2:i386\n\nIf this fails due to dependency issues, try adding the -f option.\nWhere did you get these libraries from? The current GTK+ library is at 2.24-4 for Natty (libgtk2.0-0). libgtk1.2 can be found in Hardy and Dapper according to packages.ubuntu.com.\n", "Q: Is there a graphical ssh-agent in 10.04 LTS Server? I have a co-worker who installed the gnome desktop on top of 10.04 LTS Server.  His gnome session is running under ssh-agent, and if he runs ssh-add directly, it immediately prompts for his passphrase and adds the key.  He hasn't restarted the session, so I'm not sure if ssh-add is required for every session.\nI'm use to OS X, where ssh key passphrases are stored in the keychain, so that you only need to remember your account password.  Is there a similar central password storage with a graphical interface for Gnome?  Is it standard on the Desktop edition, or is it an additional install there as well?\n\nA: The program your coworker is looking for is ssh-askpass:\n\nunder X, asks user for a passphrase for ssh-add\n\nThis is integrated into Gnome in the package ssh-askpass-gnome (which will interface with Gnome Keyring, so you can save the ssh key decryption password in the keyring, and it will be supplied as needed) - note that it should already be installed if the metapackage ubuntu-desktop is.\n", "Q: How do I find my Windows partition?

I mounted the partition using \"Disk Utility\" but still I can't find it in my Home Folder.\n\nA: The partition should be visible in the left pane of Nautilus-the-file-browser, and also in the left pane of Open File dialogs.\nIf you click on it there, it'll be mounted in a directory under /media, as Dirk Hartzer Waldeck pointed out.\n\nA: It will be mounted under /media.\nThat is the folder media from the very top folder root /.\nYour home folder will be /home/yourusernamehere.\nSo you need to go up two levels and find media there.\n", "Q: How to use Wi-Fi channels above 11?

My basic test has been this:\npref('browser.startup.page', \"http://askubuntu.com\");\n\nAnd so far I have put that line in:\n/etc/firefox/syspref.js\n/usr/lib/firefox-6.0/defaults/pref/vendor.js\n~/.mozilla/firefox/whatever.default/prefs.js\n~/.mozilla/firefox/whatever.default/user.js\n/usr/share/xul-ext/ubufox/defaults/preferences/000system.js\n\nI quit Firefox, make the change in the file and then log out and log in and start FF again. Every one of these has been unsuccessful. \nKeeping in mind that the default homepage is only the first of about a dozen settings I need to customize, how can I get Firefox to use the settings I am adding?\n\nA: Firefox generally reads its settings from ~/.mozilla/firefox, so if you have the settings in a shared location, once that folder has been created, Firefox will ignore your shared settings. What you could do however is take a look at the addon xulet-ubufox  used by Ubuntu to modify Firefox settings (it is installed by default), and see how that gets it done.\nAnother option, if the systems do not yet have user accounts set up (or if you can recreate the accounts), is to put a customized ~/.mozilla/firefox folder in /etc/skel. This will be copied to all new accounts.\nA third, possibly easier option, is to create the customized defaults, package them in a deb that points to some shared location like /usr/share/firefox-defaults, and then copy these settings on startup (of the user profiles) to ~/.mozilla/firefox. I don't know the full technical details of accomplishing this, but I believe it should be possible to do it by adding something to /etc/rc.local\nAnother way to get this ~/.mozilla/firefox re-initialised on every login could be by making a 'login-script', activated by the pam-script module. See here for more info on how to use it.\n\nA: Your safest bet is to change the value in Firefox and then look in about:config for what has changed.

(i.e. can I take my wubi install away from windows?)\nor is there a way to from inside ubuntu have it run the ubuntu iso somehow so I can just wipe the system and install it fresh? (even if it means I need to have an e.g. 2gb partition just for the image to reside in).\n\nA: If you have a USB Flash drive of 1GB or more you can use the following method.\nWhat You Will Need\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll need to download the Universal USB Installer.\n\n*Download your chosen Ubuntu ISO Image from Here.\n\n*A USB Flash Drive with 1GB or more of available free space.\n\n\nThe Process\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the Universal USB Installer...\n\n*Download your Ubuntu/Linux ISO of choice.\n\n*Open up the Universal USB Installer program and select your Linux ISO from the list.\n\n*After selecting your Linux ISO select the name of the drive you wish to write the Ubuntu program to. NOTE: This process will completely remove ALL data from your drive when writing the Ubuntu Program to it so make sure it's the one you want to use!!!\n\n*After the process completes turn off your pc, stick in the Live USB that you just made, then turn your pc back on, and then select the USB Drive from your boot menu. After that you can either test Ubuntu on your machine or install it!\n\n*Enjoy your new Ubuntu installation!\n\n\nIf you wish to create a flash drive that is persistent (I.E. You can save stuff to it like files and settings etc...) might I suggest that you take a look at the following question and it's subsequent answers? Method to create a live USB disk (with persistence) which actually works?\nHopes this helps you out!!!\n\nA: *\n\n*Use Windows 7 to shrink one of your partitions (you can shrink a mounted partition while running Windows). If you already have 4 primary partitions you'll need to remove one of them first. \n\n*Boot wubi and install GParted and create an extended partition in the free space you created, and then 2 logical partitions, one an ext4 partition large enough to contain your Wubi install, and optionally 1 swap partition (> size of RAM).\n\n*Migrate wubi to the partition, installing the grub bootloader at the same time\n\n*Boot the migrated Ubuntu and format the Windows partition, which you can then reuse as a separate /home or you can use the same migration script to move the migrated Ubuntu to it.\n\n\nThis solution doesn't require a live CD/USB (although it's always a good idea to have one.\n\nA: The Ubuntu Help Wiki has a section on Installation Without a CD with sections like from USB, Windows, Linux, VM, etc.\n\nA: You have to use alternative cd\n\n\n*\n\n*First Download the Alternative cd iso using torrent from this link.\n\n*Either mount or burn the iso to usb (using startup disk creator).\n\n*A dialog will be displayed offering you the opportunity to upgrade.\n\n*Follow the on-screen instructions. \n\nA: If your laptop supports it, you should be able to do a net install using PXE. Most laptops will allow you to \"boot from the network\" at startup. You might have to hit ESC or something like that during boot to get in the right menu.\nThis does require you to do a bit of setup on another machine in your network, which will serve the Ubuntu installation media. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PXEInstallServer\n\nA: Please make a backup before testing this because I'm not 100% sure it will work flawless.\nI think the way to do it is something like this (untested):  \n\n\n*\n\n*Format one partition that will be your destination for the installation (I suggest you to choose the ext4 format)  \n\n*Copy the your files and folders from wubi to the new partition  \n\n*Make sure you have a folder named /boot/ with at least two files like initrd.img-2.6.38-10-generic and vmlinuz-2.6.38-10-generic \n\n*Than you will have to install grub:  \nThese instructions were adapted from: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2#Recover \n\"METHOD 3 - CHROOT\nThis method of installation uses the chroot command to gain access to the broken system's files. Once the chroot command is issued, the LiveCD (in your case the wubi installation) treats the broken system's / as its own. Commands run in a chroot environment will affect the broken systems filesystems and not those of the LiveCD.\n1) Boot to the LiveCD Desktop (Ubuntu 9.10 or later) (Open Ubuntu at Wubi). Please note that the Live CD must be the same as the system you are fixing - either 32-bit or 64-bit (if not then the chroot will fail).\n2) Open a terminal - Applications, Accessories, Terminal.\n3) Determine your normal system partition - (the switch is a lowercase \"L\")\n\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nIf you aren't sure, run\ndf -Th  Look for the correct disk size and ext3 or ext4 format.\n\n4) Mount your normal system partition:\n\nSubstitute the correct partition: sda1, sdb5, etc.\nsudo mount /dev/sdXX /mnt   # Example: sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\n5) Only if you have a separate boot partition:\nsdYY is the /boot partition designation (for example sdb3)\n\n sudo mount /dev/sdYY /mnt/boot \n6)\nMount the critical virtual filesystems:\nsudo mount --bind /dev  /mnt/dev\nsudo mount --bind /dev/pts  /mnt/dev/pts\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nsudo mount --bind /sys  /mnt/sys \n7)\nChroot into your normal system device:\nsudo chroot /mnt \n8) If there is no /boot/grub/grub.cfg or it's not correct, create one using\nupdate-grub \n9)\nReinstall GRUB 2:\nSubstitute the correct device - sda, sdb, etc. Do not specify a partition number.\ngrub-install /dev/sdX \n10) Verify the install (use the correct device, for example sda.

It runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. You can either let UNetbootin download one of the many distributions supported out-of-the-box for you, or supply your own Linux .iso file if you've already downloaded one or your preferred distribution isn't on the list.\nUNetbootin can make a \"frugal install\" on your local hard disk if you don't have a USB drive.  For the Hard-Disk/ \"frugal install\" mode, UNetbootin uses a Linux-based installer to install a small modification to the bootloader to boot the desired distribution's installer or to load the system utility, no CD required. After the distribution has been installed, or once done using the system utility, the modification to the bootloader is then undone.\nYou can use the following link to run the \"frugal/hard-disk install\":\nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/unetbootin/wiki/installmodes/\n\nA: If you have an Ethernet connection to the machine, and it supports it, you may be able to network boot/install. That is, use the drive on another machine to install Ubuntu over your local network.\nCheck out the Ubuntu community doc for it over here.\nEdit: Wow, jelmer, beat me to it while I was typing.\n\nA: Yep, all your friend needs to do is download and install Wubi. It's designed for this exact scenario. You can check it out here: http://wubi-installer.org/\n\nA: He could setup a live CD ISO for PXE boot, or use one that is available on the net.\nSee Netbooting Ubuntu Live CDs.\n\nA: I once installed an Ubuntu derivative(Samurai) using Virtualbox to mount my harddisk raw partition as a virtualbox hard drive. It involves creating a vmdk file which is linked to the partition. Then anything you do on the virtualbox goes to the partition. Even the grub install worked. \nHowever, this method is quite risky as it involves giving raw access to Virtualbox. Further you can,quite simply try to boot into Windows twice (the second time inside your VirtualBox), so it is not recommended. But it is always an option to install it, and just delete the Virtual Machine. However your boot structure, partition should still retain your brand new Ubuntu install.\nHere's the link I used :\nAccessing Physical Disks on Virtualbox\n\nA: He can download and install wubi which doesn't require a usb or cd key. Here is a link. \nHere is also another link on the various way ubuntu can be installed. \n\nA: You could use Unetbootin and set it to use the hard drive.\n\nA: Wubi will allow you to install Ubuntu while keeping Windows installed. If at anytime he decides he does not like Ubuntu he can uninstall it just like a normal program and it will give him his space back. If he does any other install it will be much harder to uninstall. He'll have to use the Disk Management tool and delete the partition and then extend the Windows partition. In order to get Wubi you can download it at http://wubi-installer.org/ or download the current Ubuntu release and then use 7-Zip to extract the ISO and then click on wubi.exe. An installer should appear and he can follow the instructions from there. It's very simple for even the most non-tech users.\n\nA: Well, theoretically, if you already have more than one partition on your disk or some unallocated space, you could boot Ubuntu using wubi, create a new partition from there, install Ubuntu on that partition, reboot, remove the Windows partition.\nThe point is - you can't modify partitions or install Ubuntu on a partition you booted from, so you need more than one. Wubi does not count as a separate partition - it resides on the Windows partition so you can't touch that.\nBut, honestly, USB drives are very-very cheap these days - make a small investment and save you some time :) \n", "Q: Nautilus is frozen, cannot be used, and cannot be killed I'm experiencing the weirdest problem right now. Nautilus is essentially not working right now. My desktop is frozen, clicking and right clicking doesn't work, I can't open anything in nautilus, etc. It simply is broken. The problem is that I can't exactly kill it with anything.\nwhile true; sudo killall -9 nautilus ; done doesn't kill it. \nI can't log out because I'm right in the middle of a long upload and I'm not going to kill it if I can help it. Is there something I can do to reload nautilus without logging out?\n\nA: FYI, I was having the same issue. In my case, it appears to be caused by a faulty mount point somewhere in my FS tree.\nSpecifically, the culprit was a samba mount (cifs) that failed due to me losing VPN. As nautilus mentions these under 'Network' in the left sidebar, I'm guessing this caused it to hang. As a work-around I remounted all my volumes (sudo mount -a) and now nautilus is responsive again.\n\nA: When Nautilus stopped responding and couldn't be killed, it turned out I had sshfs hanged. So this helped to kill it:\nkillall sshfs\n\nWhen sshfs hangs, it sometimes causes a file browser to hang in such a way that it cannot itself be killed, but sshfs can still be killed. Killing sshfs in this situation makes it possible to kill (and restart) the file browser. Sometimes the file browser will quit when sshfs is killed; occasionally it might even start responding immediately and not have to be killed.\nThis does not always work, of course, because when a file browser such as Nautilus hangs, even in the specific scenario described here where kill -9 was ineffective, it is not always due to a problem with sshfs. However, this does seem to be a fairly common cause of the problem.\nKilling sshfs also stops other filesystem activity through sshfs mounts. When sshfs is malfunctioning, you probably want that. When it's not, and some other problem is hanging your file browser, you may not.\n\nWhen a process can't be killed, even with SIGKILL, even by root--which is what the question here describes happening to nautilus--it's usually because the process is stuck in uninterruptible sleep (see also 3dGrabber's comment).1\nIt's normal for a process to enter uninterruptible sleep for very short periods of time. Processes communicate with the kernel through system calls. Some system calls, while executing, cannot be interrupted by signals, so any signals sent to the process must wait until the system call has completed. Normally, that happens, and then the signal is received. But when a system call that can't be interrupted hangs, the process can never receive a signal, unless the hang can be stopped through some other means.\nKilling a process is achieved by sending it a signal. By default, the kill command sends SIGTERM, which processes are free to handle however they want and is thus sometimes ineffective. The harsher way to kill a process is SIGKILL (which kill -9 or kill -KILL sends). Processes cannot choose to ignore SIGKILL, but they still do not receive it while in uninterruptible sleep.\nA common cause of prolonged uninterruptible sleep is malfunctioning drivers, including filesystem drivers. Drivers are often implemented as kernel modules, and while most kernel modules can be loaded and unloaded, once one is malfunctioning and unable to complete an operation, there is often no reasonable and safe way to force it to stop while continuing to use the system. To end a process that's stuck in uninterruptible sleep, it's usually necessary to reboot.\nFUSE drivers are a major exception to this. When they malfunction, you often needn't reboot. With FUSE, the details of how a filesystem is accessed are implemented outside the kernel, in an ordinary program. To access data on a FUSE filesystem, a program will still make system calls, but the kernel delegates them through the FUSE module into a handler program.\nsshfs is a FUSE filesystem driver. When data are accessed on an sshfs mount, a system call is performed that delegates work to an sshfs process. (Behind the scenes, to mount an sshfs filesystem, /usr/bin/sshfs was run. Or you may have run the sshfs command manually.) If this malfunctions, it can cause the program attempting to access the sshfs filesystem to remain in uninterruptible sleep, yet the sshfs process itself may remain killable. When that process is killed, the system call becomes unstuck, returning an error code to indicate failure, and the program that made the system call can terminate or continue running.\nMalfunctions causing prolonged uninterruptible sleep are not unique to sshfs. They can happen with any filesystem, FUSE or not, though if it's not a FUSE filesystem then you likely must reboot. And there are other commonly used FUSE filesystems where this could occur, such as ntfs-3g. It doesn't happen often with any filesystem, but in practice it seems to occur more often with sshfs than most other FUSE filesystems.\nAny program making a system call that uses a malfunctioning filesystem driver could run into this. But you would usually at least be trying to access a file on an sshfs mount, and thus have some idea of what might be wrong. In contrast, file browsers frequently access data outside of where you are currently working, in order to avoid giving outdated information about things like what filesystems are currently mounted and how much space is available on them, and sometimes to fetch information in the background to build thumbnails.\n\n1 Another scenario where this could happen is when it's a zombie process. However, unlike a process stuck in uninterruptible sleep, a zombie processes rarely causes problems, since the only resource it takes up is a row in the kernel's process table. A zombie nautilus processes would typically go unnoticed. In particular, that shouldn't keep a subsequently executed nautilus process from managing the desktop.\n\nA: Running the command\nkillall nautilus\n\nfixed this for me - it may help a future visitor.\n\nA: I had the same problem.\nRemounting one of the external USB drives didn't work due to \"device is busy\".\nlsof showed up that a file was held open by an already closed application. \nps showed that the application was still running, despite the already closed window. \nkill -9 didn't work on that application either.\nAs umount -f also just complained device is busy, I finally decided to disconnect the external drive's USB cable.\nAt that very moment, all pending kill -9s seemed to take place – both nautilus and the still running application closed and disappeared from my ps output.\n\nA: Have you tried nautilus -q already?\nIt exits (and restarts) nautilus.

Is this because it becomes unresponsive, or is it because Ubuntu can't cope with the demands?  Is there a way to circumvent this, for example, by increasing the virtual memory?  If so, how?\nNote that I am running Version 11.04 of Ubuntu on a single Pentium 4 processor with 4GB of RAM.  If it's any help, my computer is a DELL Optiplex 210L.\n\nA: It's likely the resources issue: out of memory. When Ubuntu runs our of memory, the OOM killer kicks in and kills some processes until it has enough memory again. If your program consumes loads of memory, perhaps there is a bug in it. (e.g. it would not make sense to take 500MB for reading a PDF.) Sometimes, other programs are responsible for eating memory. On KDE, kmix and knotify4 is known to use a lot memory under certain conditions wihout giving it back. To solve that, I've a cron running restarting these processes use excess memory.\nSolution: upgrade your RAM and/ or add more swap. More RAM will definitely help more, swap is much slower and just delays the death of your application.\n", "Q: How do I get Chinese input to work? How do I configure Ubuntu to input Chinese?\n\nA: My system had a similar problem: I was able to choose \"Chinese\", but it didn't really input any Chinese. The key step missing was to install a specific Chinese input method/package. E.g.:\nsudo apt-get install ibus-pinyin \n\nAfter installing Pinyin in this example, go to System Settings → Language Support → Chinese (Pinyin). \nNow it works as expected.\nThis thread helped me to figure out this solution. It also suggests another input method:\nsudo apt-get install ibus-sunpinyin\n\nP.S.\nAfter either of those commands do not forget to restart the IBus daemon\nibus restart\n\n\nA: This method is through command line. It relies on installing ibus-libpinyin (which is known as Ibus Intelligent Pinyin) and adding it as input source to gsettings schema. This has been tested multiple times on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS  as well as 15.04\nFirst install ibus-libpinyin\nsudo apt-get install ibus-libpinyin\n\nThen, run the following command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources sources \"$(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.input-sources sources | sed \"s/]/, ('ibus', 'libpinyin')]/\")\" \n\nThe command above takes output of gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.input-sources sources, gives it to sed, which removes the last square bracket and appends , ('ibus', 'libpinyin')] to its output. That particular schema has entries in format [(INPUTMETHOD1, LANGUAGE1), (INPUTMETHOD1,LANGUAGE2)], so this is the reason why sed has to be used to insert text in that fassion. Finally we use output of that as input for gsettings set command, through parameter substitution with $( . . . )\nAlternatively the two lines can be combined into a simple script:\n#!/bin/sh\nSCHEMA=\"org.gnome.desktop.input-sources\"\nKEY=\"sources\"\nsudo apt-get install ibus-libpinyin\ngsettings set $SCHEMA $KEY \"$(gsettings get $SCHEMA $KEY | sed \"s/]/, ('ibus', 'libpinyin')]/\")\"\n\nHope that helps other users!

The Win7 installer is only seeing the virtual drive as 1GB in size and refuses to install on it. I initially used the \"Auto\" setting when creating the drive, but when that didn't work, I tried setting it explicitly to \"Qcow2\" after finding an old tutorial. That didn't work, either.\nIs there a particular drive type that reports its size to Windows correctly? Or, is there a way I can tell Qemu to tell the VM that the size is different from its starting size (since the default is a dynamically expanding format)? The VM drives are stored on a 1TB drive with 3/4 of its space unused, so I'm not really concerned about drive space and a static-sized file could be used, if that's what it takes.\n\nA: I don't know about your problem, but I successfully installed Win7 on qemu with this command:\n\nvirt-install --connect qemu:///system -n win7 -r 2048 --vcpus=2 -f\n  win7.qcow2 -s 30 -c\n  win7.iso --vnc --noautoconsole\n  --os-type windows --os-variant win7 --accelerate --network=bridge:br0\n  --hvm\n\n-n Name\n-r Ram\n-s Size in GB\n-c Installation media\n\nYou might want to try this\n\nA: First you have to create an image to use like a hdd:\nqemu-img create -o size=30GB win7.img\n\nThen start the qemu to use the ISO as cdrom:\nqemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom path/to/win7.iso -hda win7.img\n\nIt will install windows, then, to start it:\nqemu-system-x86_64 -hda win7.img\n\nI hope this will help you,\nArian\n", "Q: Unable to boot into Ubuntu after Ubuntu-Fedora Dual Boot I tried to dual boot Ubuntu and fedora, but now I am unable to boot into my Ubuntu installation.

Is there a way during a clean install to choose 2d instead of the 3d even though my hardware would support 3d? My main applications that I use are for graphic design and photography and need all the resources I can when working with large files and/or large number of photos. From all the reading, 2d is lot less resource intensive, is this true? I switched from the LTS to xubuntu, but I really would like to learn this new UI.\n\nA: In Oneiric Unity 2D is the fall back mode. If the hardware is not capable of running Unity 3D then Unity 2D is installed. You may find that the video drivers that come with the installation are capable of running your video card in 3D. In this case Unity 3D will be installed. I think this happened when I installed 11.10 alpha four months ago.\nIn this case you need to open the Ubuntu Software Center and search for Unity 2D and install the four parts of Unity 2D. Then reboot and at the login screen after you have clicked on your user name you will see a menu with the option to load into Unity 2D. Ubuntu in that menu is Unity 3D.\nThe login manager will usually load the last chosen mode. So, next time you boot you will already be set up to run the Unity 2D desktop.\nOn my system I have set myself up as two different users so I can switch between 3D and 2D without rebooting. I wanted to compare the two setups. You might find that useful. \nCorrection: In the menu Ubuntu is Unity 3D and Ubuntu 2D is Unity 2D. I have just tested the accuracy of my reply.\nRegards.\n\nA: Sure, you can select Unity2d during the installation when installing from the minimal iso. Obviously, you'll also have to select and install the other packages manually as well.\n", "Q: I accidentally removed myself from sudoers, how can I fix this? I have one admin account and recently I have accidentally added myself to a single group (usermod -G without -a). \nSo, I am not in the sudoers file any more. However, it is not possible to log in to root by default on Ubuntu. Do I reset the password for root during the boot process?\n\nA: No need to reset root password (well, technically, Ubuntu's root does not even have a password). Do this:\n\n*\n\n*Reboot your PC\n\n\n*In Grub's OS selection screen, choose \"Ubuntu xxxx - recovery mode\"\n\n\n*Now you have a console with root privileges. Add your user back to sudo group:\n  usermod -a -G sudo youruser\n\nThe shell might reply that it cannot do it because the file system in mounted in read-only. To remount your fs in read-write: mount -o remount,rw /\n\n*\n\n*That will be enough for sudo. But its suggested you also re-add yourself to other default administrative groups. You can reboot, logon normally and use GUI:\n\nMenu > Administration > Users and Groups > Advanced Settings > User Privileges or Account Type (Change...) > Administrative\n\n*\n\n*Or use this command:\n  sudo usermod -a -G adm,cdrom,plugdev,lpadmin,sambashare youruser\n\nNotes:\n\n*\n\n*The sudo group used to be the admin group prior to Ubuntu 12.04. If you're on anything older, replace the group sudo with the group admin in the above commands.\n\n*Starting from Ubuntu 20.04, the fuse group does not exist anymore. It allowed regular users to access /dev/fuse using fusemount, i.e., to mount FUSE filesystems. But since Debian 8 /dev/fuse is already world-writeable by default.\n\nImportant Note:\nThe default set of groups for what is considered an \"Administrator\" role\nchanges over time, as some groups become obsolete or irrelevant (such as tape or floppy), are removed, renamed or re-organized, or are created in your system only when related packages are installed (sambashare, virtualbox, www_data). So in a few years adm, cdrom or lpadmin might not exist (that is, if they still do!).\nBesides, some features that currently use groups for filesystem-based permissions might change to another access permission mechanism, such as udev, PAM, AppArmor, SELinux, etc.\nSo the only way to get an updated list of groups is... to check your current system! Create a new temporary Administrator user using the GUI, or do a fresh install in a VM, and see which groups the user is assigned to by default.\n", "Q: Protecting against (infinitely) slow DNS servers Recently, one of my ISPs DNS servers got into trouble. To quote the support desk personnel it \"wasn't completely down so connections were just infinitely slow\". My application was down for a couple of hours, as it couldn't connect to critical services on other machines.\nWhile I have redundant DNS servers in my /etc/resolv.conf file, it appears that this slowness wasn't enough for the DNS client to declare the DNS server is down, and to fallback to a secondary DNS server.\nI fear this sort of problem could strike again, so I have been reading up on Ubuntu DNS configuration. There appears to be a timeout option with a default of 5 seconds, but that doesn't seem to have worked here.\nQ1: Is there a log file where I can see the DNS attempts and confirm my understanding that the timeouts didn't trigger?\nQ2: What do I need to do to implement such timeouts, and protect myself from such DNS issues again?\nFor the record, my /etc/resolv.conf file (expurgated):\nsearch localhost\nnameserver IP.addr.ess.1\nnameserver IP.addr.ess.2\nnameserver IP.addr.ess.3\n\nI'm running Ubuntu 9.10 (Yeah, yeah, I hope to get a quiet period in December to upgrade.)\n\nA: You can try changing your DNS servers with Google's ones. It might be unfeasible if your ISP blocks external DNS queries, though.\nI suggest you install a local DNS forwarding/caching nameserver such as pdnsd, which is highly configurable. Then you put nameserver 127.0.0.1 in your /etc/resolv.conf; pdnsd takes care of forwarding requests to other nameservers, or resolves lightning fast from the local cache. You can also configure a timeout after which a nameserver is considered to be non-responsive, so it would seem to fit your needs.\nPdnsd also supports parallel access to multiple DNS servers, so if one is slow the application will not be slowed down. It even supports this with fail-over servers (e.g. contact first two servers in parallel; if they don't respond, contact two more, and listen for responses from all four servers, etc.)\nFrom the aptitude description:\npdnsd can be used with applications that do dns lookups, eg on startup, and can't be \nconfigured to change that behaviour, to prevent the often minute-long hangs\n(or even crashes) that result from stalled dns queries.\n\nSecurity note: pdnsd is (self-confessed) not safe for outsiders to access: if your machine is out on the Internet, you need to configure a firewall to only allow local machine access.\n", "Q: Ubuntu doesn't see my partitions correctly I bought a new desktop and installed Windows 7 first. I am now trying to instal Ubuntu 11.04, but it doesn't see my partions corectly.\nAny thoughts are appreciated. Thanks.\nHere is the windows setup:\n\nWhat live cd partioner sees:\n\nWhat ubuntu live cd sees:\n\n\nA: Your harddisk is using the Dynamic Disk Format, which is not compatible with Linux and some Windows Version (Home Editions). Windows allows you to convert every disk to a Dynamic Disk but not back to a Basic Disk. Dynamic Disk format is used to provide features like Software RAID. You're setup doesnt seem to use such a feature, therefor you can safely use the Basic Disk format.\nYou can backup all your data, delete all partitions and create a new partition table (make sure you don't convert it to a Dynamic Disk again).\nThere are ways to convert this disk back to a Basic Disk without copy all data around. This Blog entry describes a method using Test Disk. But be careful, and as always, make a backup first!\n\nA: My guess is this: your Windows setup is using some sort of LVM on your drive. So D:Work, E:Torrents and F: are not real partitions, but rather LVM logical volumes. Nautilus can see and read them (hence your 3rd picture showed them all), but the installer is instead showing you the real partition table. So, you have:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda1: 1MB   - Windows \"LVM fake partition table\" maybe?\n\n*/dev/sda2: 100MB - Windows \"System Reserved\" partition (created by windows 7 for many purposes - encryption, page file, etc)\n\n*/dev/sda3: 200GB - Windows OS partition\n\n*/dev/sda4: 750GB - Anything else (combined D:Work, E:Torrents and the empty F: partition)\n\n\nAs you can see, Ubuntu can read those logical volumes, but cannot install into one of them. And since you're already using your 4 primary partitions, you need to delete one to created an extended partition so you can overcome this 4-partition limit.\nMy suggestion on approach would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up everything. Seriously.\n\n*Read the link I provided you to remove the System Reserved partition.\n\n*Make sure your Windows 7 still boots fine after removing it.\n\n*Using Ubuntu Live CD, shrink the 200GB Windows partition to make room for Ubuntu\n\n*Create an extended partition there. 50GB will be more than enough. 15GB if you're really desperate.\n\n*Run the installer. Now you can create additional partitions inside the extended for Ubuntu (10~20 GB), Swap (~5GB) and, if you want, /home (whatever space you have left)\n\n\nThese are just directions... just say so if you need more details in any of the steps above.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I have had trouble with NTFS filesystems since I started using Linux with Ubuntu 8.10! I still have difficulty every once in a while... I think your best chance would be to use the windows 7 install disc to just delete the partition that you want to use for Ubuntu, and then you can format it in Ubuntu (most likely) with ext3 or ext4. Thats how I have always got around it. Sometimes Gparted's live CD from a couple years ago works better on NTFS than the newer versions.

My home directory is encrypted with ecryptfs. I booted and logged in straight into root. Root see my home directory before I log in, but it shouldn't, and it wasn't that transparent.\nHowever, when I check /home, the /myusername/.ecryptfs folder is there normally, and so is the .Private. So, it seems that encryption is there.\nNote:\n\n\n*\n\n*No changed passwords between the dates, so that isn't it.\n\n*It can be a coincidence, but I noticed that this happened after I used a common trick to dismiss the keyring asking for wifi password on login (the one you change the default keyring and leave wifi password as clear text).\nMy question is:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I make it hidden to root again without changing my user password?\n\n\nA: eCryptfs does not protect your data from root.  eCryptfs is only sufficient to protect your data at rest on the physical media.\nAfter you've logged into the system as your user, your decrypted data is only protected by Discretionary Access Controls (DAC).  This is generally enough to protect you against other non-root users on the system, but not root.\nAlso, are you absolutely sure that never entered your non-root user's password on this system after booting?  Because the situation you describe is impossible -- root would never be able to see your decrypted data if you haven't logged in yet.  This is how eCryptfs protects you against LiveCD attacks.\n", "Q: Ensure swap encryption, add /var encryption, full HD encryption \n*\n\n*I encrypted my swap with ecryptfs, but sometimes when I boot during the splash screen it says the swap is not encrypted, then it disappears.

How can I clean them systematically?\n\n*Supposing the answer to number 2 is that it leaks a lot, is full HD encryption a better option to solve this? If yes, what free program to use, since ecryptfs does not have this option?\n\nA: You should really ask one question at a time, instead of 3 together.\nYou can see your swap partitions with:\ncat /proc/swaps\n\nAnd you can see your device-mapper encrypted swap partition configuration with:\ncat /etc/crypttab\n\nAs long as all of your swap partitions listed in /proc/swaps are also configured for encryption in /etc/crypttab, you're in good shape.\nHome Directory Encryption is only meant to protect the data you store in your home directory, and is intended as a balance among security, usability, and performance.  Various bits of system information \"leak\" (as you say) to /etc (configuration files), /var (varying program information and log files) and /tmp (temporary files).  If you want to encrypt all of that, you should use full disk encryption, which you can configure at installation using the Ubuntu Alternate Install media.\n", "Q: Extract part of a video with a one-line command If I have a video, normally avi, but could be any, and I want to create another one in the same format but just a part, the position i seconds to f seconds into the video, what is the one-line command to do this?\n\nA: Do you need to cut video with re-encoding or without re-encoding mode?\nYou can try to following below command.\nSynopsis:\nffmpeg -i [input_file] -ss [start_seconds] -t [duration_seconds] [output_file]\nuse FFmpeg cut mp4 video without re-encoding\nExample:\nffmpeg -i source.mp4 -ss 00:00:05 -t 00:00:10 -c copy cut_video.mp4\nuse FFmpeg cut mp4 video with re-encoding\nExample:\nffmpeg -i source.mp4 -ss 00:00:05 -t 00:00:10 -async 1 -strict -2 cut_video.mp4\nIf you want to cut off section from the beginning, simply drop -t 00:00:10 from the command\n\nA: This can be done using mencoder or ffmpeg.\nmencoder\nSay that you want to cut out a part starting at 00:00:30 into the original file with a 5 seconds length and that it shouldn't be reencoded (if you want to re-encode it you'll have to replace copy with audio and video codecs, for a list of available audio codecs issue mencoder -oac help, for a list of available video codecs issue mencoder -ovc help), then you issue:\nmencoder -ss 00:30:00 -endpos 00:00:05 -oac pcm -ovc copy originalfile -o newfile\n\nYou'll have to replace orginalfile and newfile with actual file names, the latter is the name of the file that is created to hold the cut-out part.\nffmpeg\nSay that you want to cut out a part starting at 00:00:30 into the original file with a 5 seconds length and that it shouldn't be re-encoded (if you want to re-encode it you'll have to replace copy with audio and video codecs, for a list of available codecs issue ffmpeg -formats -E), then you issue:\nffmpeg -ss 00:00:30 -i orginalfile -t 00:00:05 -vcodec copy -acodec copy newfile\n\nYou'll have to replace orginalfile and newfile with actual file names, the later is the name of the file that is created to hold the cut out part.\n\nFor reference see http://lazyxiong-tech.blogspot.com/2007/05/using-mencoder-to-cut-out-pieces-of.html and \"7.

Any disadvantages? Is all metadata kept during conversion?\nEdited, because of @N.N. suggestion. Here are the links to the separate questions:\nWhat is the maximum audio bitrate humans can distinguish?\nReducing bitrate in conversion of mp3 and ogg\n\nA: For me Ogg Vorbis sounds a lot clearer and the file sizes are much smaller than their mp3 equivalent so instead of encoding mp3 at 128kbps I can use ogg's at 64kbps which sounds the same and are half the size.  Also, mp3's are specifically 2 channel audio whereas ogg vorbis can handle up to 256 channel's. Lastly, ogg vorbis format is open-source and free to use on any device where mp3 is proprietary and programmers get paid licensing fee's for it's use.\n\nA: Ogg Vorbis is a superior format for many reasons, not only being an open, royalty-free, patent-free standard. Just to name a few technical aspects, it has native metadata support, gapless play and multichannel, unlike MP3's ID3v1/v2 tags (v2 has no standard at all), player hacks to mitigate gaps (try listening to a live album) and 2 max channels (stereo). So MP3 is inferior in every way... its only \"advantage\" is being there several years first, got massively widespread, so any digital player (including car players, portable players, dvd players) can read it.\nBut, as for converting your MP3 to OGG... do not do this!\nTranscoding to a lossy format will not improve its quality in any way... in fact, it may decrease quality! Both MP3 and Vorbis encoders are lossy, meaning they achieve high compression ratios by throwing away inaudible parts of the audio waveform. However, the MP3 and Vorbis codecs are very different, so they each will throw away different parts of the audio. The degraded quality may or may not be perceivable for a single conversion, but it will add up for each transcoding.\nBut if you have a lossless source (either FLAC, WAV, CD-Audio), and you want to convert from that to a smaller, lossy format, and you don't mind about portability (ie, you mostly in PC or in players that support it), go ahead and use ogg. It is superior than MP3.\n", "Q: Where did the Unity modal dialogs go? I'm using Oneric and I was rather impressed by the Unity modal dialog addon. After a few upgrades it was gone. Where did it go?

If you never used a PPA check how to add software from a PPA.\nedit:\nAs shown in comment Clara OCR exists too but it got stuk at Hardy and their website has 2009 as last updated.\n\nA: tesseract-ocr would be the great one compared to all others. \nFor Installation, run the below command \nsudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr\n\nUsage is tesseract filename.jpg output.txt, then it will generate output.txt file.\nYou might consider selecting the appropriate language. In that case, you will need to install tesseract-ocr-LANG package, where LANG is the three-letter ISO 639-2 language code. Right now you have 123 languages on 18.04 repo. Then use for example:\ntesseract mySpanishText.jpg output -l spa\n\n\nA: Using tesseract-ocr we can extract text from images. I have tested gocr which didn't work well as compare to tesseract-ocr\nInstallation:\nsudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr\n\nPython program to convert all the image files with png extension inside of current directory to txt file\n#!/usr/bin/env python3.10\nimport os\nimport subprocess\n\ndef list_files(path):\n    files = []\n    for name in os.listdir(path):\n        if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(path, name)):\n            files.append(os.path.join(path, name))\n    return files\n\ndef convertImageToText(img_file):\n    #process = subprocess.Popen(['tesseract', img_file,\n    #    ''.join(img_file.rsplit('.png', 1))])\n    os.system(f\"tesseract {img_file} {''.join(img_file.rsplit('.png', 1))}\")\n\n\ndef startOperation():\n    list_file = list_files(\".\")\n    print(list_file)\n    for img_file in list_file:\n        if img_file.lower().split(\".\")[-1] == \"png\":\n            convertImageToText(img_file)\n\nstartOperation()\n\n\nA: TextSnatcher\nTry TextSnatcher. This application uses the Tesseract OCR 4.x for the character recognition behind the scenes.\n\nProbably the easiest way to install it on Ubuntu is to get it from Flathub:\n\n*\n\n*First, if you haven't already, install Flatpak using the Ubuntu quick start guide. Remember to restart your system afterwards.\n\n\n*Go to TextSnatcher on Flathub and click Install. Or, if you prefer the command-line, run this command:\nflatpak install flathub com.github.rajsolai.textsnatcher\n\n\nA: Frog\nTry Frog\n\nTo install on Ubuntu using Flatpak:\n\n*\n\n*First, if you haven't already, install Flatpak using the Ubuntu quick start guide. Remember to restart your system afterwards.\n\n\n*Go to Frog on Flathub and click Install. Or, if you prefer the command-line, run this command:\nflatpak install flathub com.github.tenderowl.frog\n\n", "Q: How to install and activate NVIDIA drivers without Jockey? Short and precise: I would like to install and activate the most recent proprietary NVIDIA drivers from the repositories without using Jockey. How can I do that?\n\nA: If you decide you want to install the NVidia driver from the .run file provided on the NVidia website:\nGetting the Driver\n\n\n*\n\n*Put in information about your video card.\n\n*Review the license and release information (this page will be different, for different video cards, and different CPU's - 32-bit vs. 64-bit).\n\n*Download the driver (also different!).\n\n\nThese .run files are shell scripts with binary data embedded in them. Thus they cannot be treated as text files, even though shell scripts usually are text files. If your web browser tries to display their contents as text:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can try right-clicking on the download link (\"Agree & Download\") and clicking Save Link As....\n\n*You can download with wget, a download utility that tends to be smarter about these things than most web browsers. To do this, right-click on the download link, click Copy Link Address (or Copy Link Location) and pass it to the wget command. For example:\nwget http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/304.64/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-304.64.run\n\nInstalling the Driver\nYou cannot install by double-clicking on the .run file. You don't want to open the file in a text editor (most of it isn't plain text anyway, so you'll see all those red escapes like in the screenshot you showed us). Furthermore, to run successfully, it must be marked as executable and the GUI must be turned off.\nOnce you have the .run file, quit all running programs, log out, and switch to a virtual console (by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1.\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in by entering your username and password as prompted. As you enter your password in the Terminal (here and later), it won't look like anything is happening--no placeholder characters like * will appear\n\n*Go to wherever you downloaded the driver. For example: cd ~/Downloads\n(The ~/ part represents you home folder, and can usually be left out.)\nIf you want, you can actually download the driver now with wget. But the advantage of downloading it from a Terminal window is that you can paste the name in from your web browser.\n\n*See the name of the driver: ls *.run\n\n*Mark it executable: chmod +x *.run\n(If there's more than one .run file, you may want to specify the whole filename, so as to make just the right one executable.)\n\n*Quit the GUI: sudo stop lightdm\n\n*Run the driver installer with sudo (it must be installed as root) and ./, for example:\nsudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-304.64.run\n\nAfter ./, you can just type the first few characters, then press Tab and the shell will guess the filename for you.\nYou'll then be prompted for more information and the installer will attempt to install the driver.\n\n*After installing the driver you'll likely have to reboot for it to work (sudo reboot or Ctrl+Alt+Delete).\nBut if you want to try reloading the GUI, you can do so: sudo start lightdm\nThis might not be necessary, but you can try switching back to the GUI with Alt+F7.\n\nA: In terminal you can install nvidia drivers by typing the following:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\n\nA: There are different ways by which you can install Nvidia drivers on to your system. Before installing by any of the method it is recommended that whether your Nvidia card supports \" optimus \"   Technology. you can see if it supports Optimus technology by following command\nlspci | grep VGA \n\nOutput:\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev ##)\n02:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation Device #### (rev ##)\n\nIf your output is something like this that, it shows both intel and nvidia controller it means your nvidia card supports Optimus technology and you have to follow different method to install nvidia drivers.\nif your output shows only nvidia compatible controller then you can install latest drivers on your system by just one command in terminal\ncode:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nif you want to activate your drivers follow these steps\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System settings\n\n*click on additional drivers\n\n*select the nvidia driver and click on activate (your driver will be downloaded and activated).\n\n*reboot your system\n\n\nif you have optimus technology supported nvidia card, you can install nvidia drivers by using \"bumblebee\".

Some audio bitrates go as high as 256kbps. But I have listen to very very clear music with 92kbps. I became suspicious that beyond a certain bitrate of x kbps the average human ear cannot tell the difference at all. What is x? \nThough the question is not ubuntu specific, it came up because of a ogg open-format question that I split.\nAdvantages of mp3 to ogg\n\nA: Bit rate per se is not distinguishable because it's not a measurement of the audio information that we hear. It's the size of information after the encoder removes what it considers inaudible (and thus, \"disposable\" with no or minimum perceived quality loss).\nGood encoders have good psychoacoustic algorithms, meaning they wisely choose how to remove high frequencies and frequencies whose amplitude is too small to be perceived, and then packs the \"chopped\" wave in the given bitrate. The higher the bitrate, the less an encoder needs to chop off from the original audio.\nBut how distinguishable are the removed parts have more to do with the decisions made by the algorithm (its psychoacoustic model) than with the actual bitrate. Poor encoders (like ancient Xing) will need a higher bitrate than a good one (like a modern LAME) to achieve the same level of perceived quality. Because given the same bits, it chose poorly what to encode and what to discard.\nSo do not think of MP3 bitrates the same way you think of a CD bitrate. In a CD, the analog sound wave is just digitally encoded, nothing is removed. So the more bits you have the more accurate your sound wave will be. You have a 1-1 mapping from bitrate to perceived accuracy. That is not possible with MP3 (or OGG) encoding, or any lossy encoding that relies on psychoacoustic models.\nAlso, \"distinguishable\" is subjective: human hearing and high-frequency sensitivity deteriorates with age... so you may enjoy 96kpbs now, but 10 (or 20) years ago you would certainly \"need\" more. Different people distinguish high-frequencies (or small amplitudes) differently.. so for them a given encoder might be better than another one, even with a lower bitrate. Also, the equipment and environment plays a key role: listening to music in a car in the road is not the same as in a quiet room with  high-quality headphones.\nThere are other factors too... specially VBR... which means the bitrate constantly changes... going up to 320 for parts of the song that require more complex encoding, and going down to 96 where nothing needs to be removed. So a VBR file of 128kpbs average will usually have much higher quality than a 160 (or even 192) constant bitrate (CBR) one.\nThat said, a 128kpbs VBR is perfectly fine for me, even using good-quality headphones. For CBR, 192 is enough for transparency (meaning I cant distinguish from original, lossless CD audio). I'm 33, and not an audiophile, so your mileage may vary.\nAn analogy:\nA good analogy came to me now.. it may help understand why it's impossible determine that \"X kbps is more than the human ear can distinguish\":\nThink of audio as a house and its furniture. You're moving to another house. Your moving truck is your bitrate: the larger it is, the more furniture you will be able to pack to your new home. But since it's a one way trip and the truck isn't big enough to hold everything, something will always be left behind, and therefore lost. \nWill you be able to distinguish that something was lost?  Do you agree that it depends a lot more on what was chosen to be left behind than how big the truck was, even tough a bigger truck will indeed help?\nDo you agree that it's impossible to measure how big the truck must be so its \"indistinguishable\", unless the truck is big enough to hold all your furniture? (that would be lossless encoding, like FLAC. And that's about 5 times bigger than the largest MP3).\nFinal words:\nSome may say that objective measurement on human hearing thresholds is possible. True, you can measure human ear for how high a frequency must be to become inaudible, or how many dB a given sound can be below the \"dominant\" one for it to be indistinguishable. But you can not directly translate that into bitrates, because how many bits are required to encode (or discard) that depends on how much of it is present on a given song.\n\nA: Hydrogenaudio's forum has done several ABX tests on this issue. Most people can't consistently tell the difference between uncompressed source material and compressed files in the ~160kbps VBR range, but some music is really hard to compress accurately, and some people are adept at hearing the difference with lossy encodings at even 320kbps for certain music. The answer is: it depends.\nDo you mean that 192 kbps is very, very clear? 92kbps is a somewhat low bit rate, and I can easily tell the difference. Unless you're listening in a noisy environment where quality doesn't matter as much (like listening to a portable device on the bus), I would avoid ever going below ~128kbps VBR with stereo music. You're sacrificing quality to save a little space, and the trade-off is not worth it in my opinion.\nYou can go down to some pretty low bit rates (under 80kbps, say) and maintain acceptable quality for mono music and speech.\n", "Q: Reducing bitrate in conversion of mp3 and ogg I can save space by reducing bitrates of songs to x*, the value beyond which humans don't discern any difference. If so, how to reduce the bitrates with CLI:\n 1. mp3 to mp3 conversion\n 2. during mp3 to ogg conversion\n 3. ogg to ogg conversion\n\nOf course, if the original bitrate is inferior than this \"x\", I don't want to artificially increase, I dare say.\n* Reference to other question:\nWhat is the maximum audio bitrate humans can distinguish?\n\nA: Do not do this. Transcoding from a lossy format to another lossy format will only decrease quality. You won't save any meaningful space. No matter if it is from mp3 to mp3, ogg to ogg or mp3 to ogg. You will lose quality. They are called lossy formats for a reason.\nDo the test yourself: convert the same song 5 (or 10) times from 128 to 128. Yes, same bitrate. Quality will be inferior than original file. Every conversion introduces artifacts that will lower the perceived quality. A file that was transcoded from 320 to 256 than to 160 will sound worse than if encoded directly from source to 160\nIf you really want to save space, get your original, un-encoded, lossless files, and convert them once to your desired bitrate. My strong suggestion? Go VBR. lame's -V5 for casual listening (average ~130, much higher quality than any other 160 or 192 CBR), or -V3 if you're very picky about quality.\nDo not use CBR if you're trying to save space. Its a dumb format: why keep a constant, say, 160 kpbs if some passages of the song would require much less than that to achieve \"perceived perfection\"? Those \"wasted\" bits could be used more efficiently in other passages where complexity (lots of instruments, multiple (and high) frequencies, etc) would require more bits.\nVBR can do that. Goes up all the way to 320 when that is needed, to keep quality, and reduce down to 96 (or less) to save space when it doesnt require many bits for same perceived quality. \nIn other words: VBR's are both more economical (saves when not needed) and higher quality (increases when needeed). A wise choice if you want a good balance between less disk space and great quality.\n\nA: To do this you could use ffmpeg with libavcodec-extra-52.  \ncd to the directory of the file, then:  \nffmpeg -i input.file.mp3 -ab 64 -f ogg output.ogg  \n\nor  \nffmpeg -i input.file.mp3 -ab 64 -f mp3 output.mp3  \n\nThe number after -ab is the bitrate. If you want to use VBR then replace -ab for -aq. \nBe aware of MestreLion advice.\n", "Q: How to control output from crontab? I am trying to run a test case via automation testing (sahi) , so I am running it repeatedly after 1 hour (via crontab).\nWhat I want is that whenever my test case fails i should receive the email otherwise not. Right now I am receiving mail whether it passes or fails.\nIn short, can I send mail to a person depending upon the output I get in terminal.\nI am using Ubuntu 10.10.\n\nA: Pipelineing works in cron just as well as in bash. You could pipe the output to a script, that examines it and sends the mail. Or even easier use grep:\n# in /etc/crontab\n\nMAILTO=a.b@c.de\nSHELL=/bin/bash\n\n# m h dom mon dow user      command\n30  * *   *   *   confus    /home/confus/bin/someCommand.sh | grep -A 11 -B 10 \"Error:\"\n\nThis will send an e-mail to a.b@.c.de when the stirng \"Error: \" occures in the output of someCommand.sh. In this case the text of the e-mail will be the output from 10 lines before and 11 lines after the occurrence of \"Error: \" (hence the -A for after and -B for before).\nThe mail is only send if the computer running cron has a working mail-server installed. A script to process the output is of course more flexible and considerably more work.\n\nA: It sounds like either the exit code of your command is not being set correctly or that you are sending messages to stdout but not capturing/redirecting it.  On a success, you should return 0 (exit 0).  And on a failure return a positive number less than 256 (exit 2).  Cron will detect the exit code and send email (MAILTO variable in crontab) on a non-zero exit code.\nAlso, if any output is sent to stdout or stderr, that is emailed to the user, regardless of the exit code.\nSee the cron(8) manpage for more information.\n", "Q: How to make secondary partition accessible to me (and root) only I have workstation with 160GB HDD capacity.\nI have partitioned it with:  \n\n\n*\n\n*40GB -- for OS(Ubuntu) Installation  \n\n*40GB -- for my personal data, and  \n\n*80GB -- for all other (public) data.  \n\n\nI have installed Ubuntu 11.04 on 1st partition.  \nConfusion : How can i make 2nd partition (Personal data) visible and accessible to me (and root, of course) only.\nAll other programs and files need to be accessed by all the users, but those 40GB must be accessible to me (my account) and root.\nHow can I achieve this (or some alternate)?\nNote : If referring to any link, then make sure it's easy to understand as I am very (very) new to Ubuntu.\n\nA: It's rather easy to do: set the directory where your disc is mounted to your username and usergroup. Only users that are that username or are part of that usergroup and of course root will have access. So lets assume you gave this disc (during installation) a mountpoint called /discworld/. Log in with your admin-user and do...\n sudo chown $USER:$USER /discworld/\n\n... and any other user should get an permissions error when trying to access this disc. \n(where $USER needs to be replaced for the username you want this for unless it is the admin-user)\nSidenote: \nIf you did not add a mountpoint during installation you can add one to /etc/fstab. If you got questions about how to do that ... search AU first and if no good results are found ask a question about it ;-)\n\nA: In Ubuntu you'll have a problem if you only set the permissions of the files in this 2nd partition to youruser and root, because if you boot with a live-CD you'll automatically gain root rights.\nSo I would say you should try truecrypt on the 2nd partition, and encrypt it fully, then after starting the system, you can use your password to decrypt and use this partition.\nFor an English instruction refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/TrueCrypt.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Package at: http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads Linux -> Standard (x64/x32)\n\n*Unzip this package. \n\n*Open terminal type:\nsudo sh path/to/unzippedcontent/truecrypt-7.0a-setup-x64\n\n(Where you have to replace path/to/unzippedcontent by your file specific path.\nAnd x64 by x64/x32.)\n\n*Follow installation instructions.\n\n*Start truecrypt by typing:\nsudo truecrypt\n\n\n*Follow the instruction in the tutorials given above.\n", "Q: Laptop keyboard has gone crazy \nPossible Duplicate:\nKeyboard sticks randomly \n\nMy laptop keyboard has gone crazy.

So if your file looks like\n\nName: Sally\nDate of Birth: 7.31.76\nAddress: 1234 Main St.\nSSN: 123-45-6789\n\nyou can run grep Name info.txt and it will return Name: Sally. You can then redirect the output to another file. So calling\ngrep Name info.txt > info2.txt\nwill output the line to the new file info2.txt. If you want to append new lines, you can do\ngrep Address info.txt >> info2.txt\notherwise the file will be overwritten.\nYou could also learn to use a command line text editor like vim.\n\nA: You can use grep to search for a regular expression in details.txt and redirect the result to the new file.\nIf all the lines you want to copy have something in common the other lines don't you can use  :\ngrep \"string in common\" details.txt > new.txt\n\nIf not you will have to search for each line you want to copy, still using grep, and append them to new.txt using >> in stead of >.\n\nA: The file you showed has all the details on one line:\nname : farah age : 23 phone number : 0123 education : degree\n\nI have assumed that you can hard-code age : etc into the command, but the text following it will vary, and that the details may not be in the given order or be contiguous.\nYou can extract parts of the line with grep's -o flag. This prints only the matched part, rather than the whole line.\nIf you want to include the age : and phone number : parts, you can either use the -e flag to specify multiple matches, or alternation.\n$ grep -oe 'age : [^ ]*' -e 'phone number : [^ ]*' file\nage : 23\nphone number : 0123\n\nThe expression [^ ]* means any number of characters that are not a space, so it matches characters after age :  up to the next space.\nReplace file with the name of the file that contains your details. You may write the new file by redirecting the output to a new file with the > operator, like this:\ngrep -oe 'age : [^ ]*' -e 'phone number : [^ ]*' file > outfile\n\nWhen you do that, you won't see any output. You should check the output first, then add redirection.\nHere's the example with alternation. We use the -E flag to tell grep to use extended regex. The syntax is (pattern1|pattern2) - this matches pattern1 and/or pattern2. If either is found, it will be printed (regardless of whether the other is found or not). I'm now using + meaning at least one of the preceding character, instead of * meaning zero or more of the preceding character. In this context, they both work equally well.\n$ grep -Eo '(age : [^ ]+|phone number : [^ ]+)' file\nage : 23 \nphone number : 0123 \n\nIf you want to omit the age : and phone number: parts, you can use the -P flag to ask grep to use Perl-compatible regular expressions. This supports alternation, and also a way of matching text after a given pattern:\n$ grep -Po '(age : \\K[^ ]+|phone number : \\K[^ ]+)' file\n23\n0123\n\nIf you want to format the text differently, you can use sed, for example:\n$ sed -r 's/.*(age) : ([^ ]*).*(phone number) : ([^ ]*).*/\\1:\\2 | \\3:\\4/' file\nage:23 | phone number:0123\n\nThis depends on age coming before phone number, so adjust accordingly if that's not the case. If you can't rely on the order, you can use this very convoluted command:\n$ sed -r 's/(.*)(phone number : [^ ]+)(.*) .*/\\2 \\1\\4/; s/(phone number) : ([^ ]+) .*(age) : ([^ ]+).*/\\1: \\2 | \\3: \\4/' file\nphone number: 0123 | age: 23\n\nThis rearranges the line so that the phone number : section comes first on every line, then does a second replacement to select the desired details. I owe the technique used here to this answer by muru.\nNotes on sed commands not covered by previous explanations\n\n*\n\n*-r use extended regex for more readable commands (GNU sed understands -E with the same meaning)\n\n*s/old/new/ replace old with new\n\n*(pattern) saves pattern to reference later, with \\1 or \\2 etc (corresponding to the left-to-right order in which the capture groups occur - note that sed will only hold up to 7 of these!).\n\n*. any character, therefore .* represents any number of any characters.\n\n*; separates commands, as in the shell.\n\n\nA: There are also editors which work in the terminal, e.g. nano, vi and emacs.\nIf you are using a graphical user interface on your local machine and a terminal on a remote machine, you can also use the mouse to copy and paste from one terminal window/tab to a second one.\n\nA: Assuming input file details.txt contains:\nname: farah\nage: 23\nphone number: 0123\neducation: degree\n\nyou can select lines \"name\" and \"phone\" by extended grep and redirect output to new.txt:\ngrep -E \"age:|phone number:\" details.txt > new.txt\n\nThis will produce new.txt with:\nage: 23\nphone number: 0123\n\nHow it works:\nGrep prints only matched lines. The -E options enabled extended regexp which gives you possibility to use | (alternative). Remember to quote whole pattern, so | will be interpreted by grep. Otherwise shell will try to interpret. You don't want this here.\n", "Q: Failure of Power Supply during Remote Desktop Connection makes the local Machine unusable?

I mistakenly enabled the Pre-release updates (natty-proposed) repository and then upgraded all packages.\nHow can I undo this?\nHere are the test results from @enzotib's instructions and the test results from my instructions.\n\nA: This page suggests that Apt pinning can be used to downgrade from an entire repository by leveraging the fact that pin priorities higher than 1000 can cause package downgrades.\nOne solution, then, might be to temporarily increment by 1000 the default priorities of all package files except for those from the natty-proposed repository:\napt-cache policy | awk '\n    /^ [0-9]+ / {\n        p = $1;\n        getline;\n        r = $0;\n        if (r !~ /a=natty-proposed/) p += 1000;\n        print \"Package: *\\nPin: \" r \"\\nPin-priority: \" p \"\\n\"\n    }\n' | sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/downgrade-from-natty-proposed\n\n(Note: This method fails to increase the priority of package files whose release fields contain commas. See this question.)\nAfter doing this, apt-get --simulate upgrade can be used to test for successful downgrade detection. After confirming that the correct downgrades are detected, sudo apt-get upgrade should be all that is needed to perform the downgrade.\nWhen the downgrade is complete, use Software Sources to disable the Pre-release updates (natty-proposed) repository, then remove the temporary priority increase:\nsudo rm /etc/apt/preferences.d/downgrade-from-natty-proposed\n\nFinally, reboot so that all running programs are their downgraded versions.\n\nA: Here's a more general way to revert from locally installed packages, proposed and backports packages to the stable+updates channel. While the other answers are correct and work in a similar way, I think this is a more elegant approach.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you removed the entries of -proposed or -backports in your /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/* files.\n\n*Add an apt-preferences file, e.g. /etc/apt/preferences.d/99-back-to-stable-updates containing (for precise here - replace with your version):\nPackage: *\nPin: release a=precise\nPin-Priority: 1001\n\nPackage: *\nPin: release a=precise-updates\nPin-Priority: 1001\n\nPackage: *\nPin: release a=precise-security\nPin-Priority: 1001\n\nPackage: *\nPin: release a=precise-proposed\nPin-Priority: -10\n\nPackage: *\nPin: release a=precise-backports\nPin-Priority: -10\n\nThis pinning of > 1000 will make apt force a downgrade on packages from that channel and a priority of < 0 on the -proposed and -backports channels will make remove any additional packages too.\n\n*Now run\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nInspect the proposed solution apt will give you, and if you think it's okay, then accept it. If you need to check on why and what version it will be downgraded to, check this with apt-cache policy packagename to see what versions are available and what apt decides is the candidate for installation.\n\n*Remove the /etc/apt/preferences.d/99-back-to-stable-updates file again, as it's not needed anymore.\nThanks to mlind on the Ubuntu forums for this inspriation on pinning in his post from more than 5 years ago - yet it helped me out pretty well today.\n\nA: I cannot find a simpler solution than the following. Yet hoping someone get in with a better answer.\nThe following script that can execute the downgrade\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# get a list of installed packages\ndpkg --get-selections | awk '{ print $1 }' > all-packages\n\n# run apt-cache policy on each of them, then elaborate with the awk script \napt-cache policy $(<all-packages) |\n  ./get-prev-pkg-vers >old-versions\n\n# install previous version of packages\nsudo apt-get --simulate install $(< old-versions)\n\nThe awk script, named get-prev-pkg-vers is as follow\n#!/usr/bin/awk -f\n\n/^[^ ]/ {\n    package = $1\n    gsub(\":\", \"\", package)\n    search_next = 0\n}\n/^     [^ ]/ {\n    installed = 0\n    version = $1\n    if (search_next == 1) {\n        print package \"=\" version\n        search_next = 0\n    }\n}\n/^ \\*\\*\\* [^ ]/ {\n    installed = 1\n}\n/^        [^ ]/ {\n    branch = $3\n    if (installed == 1 && branch ~ /proposed/) {\n        search_next = 1\n    }\n    installed = 0\n}\n\nWhen running the script, the proposed repo should NOT have been disable yet.\nRemember to set the executable bit on both scripts.\nA problem with this approach is that all downgraded packages will result as manually installed (also those that were automacally installed).\nTo be safe, add the --simulate option to apt-get at end of the bash script.\n\nA: Reverting all packages from natty-proposed is probably not needed: most packages will be updated to the same versions soon through natty-updates anyway. \nIn case you have a problem with one package, you could revert that one package using the method darent presents (after disabling -proposed), or you can use sudo aptitude install packagename/natty. But more importantly, you should file a bug against the package. Few people actually test natty-proposed, and if regressions (=new problems) occur they should certainly be reported. Otherwise they might end-up in the updates for all ubuntu users. So if you have any issues, please report.\n\nA: In synaptic you can disable the repository for proposed and update your sources. Then you'll see than all the packages than have been updated appears as locally installed (since they're not in the repos anymore).\nNow you'll have to \"downgrade\" those packages. Select one by one, and in the upper menu chose:\npackage > force version\n\n(or Control+E)\nA menu will appear with the avalliable options. I'd choose the lower version number  for each package. If you make a mistake and there's a newer version in the normal repos, it will be solved in a later update.\nA quick solution would be to use the purge-ppa command pointing to the porposed repository, but don't know if it would work with them, i've only used it to purge external ppa's and downgrade packages to the official ubuntu versions.

It turns out that you can't have an underscore in your hostname, which is why I was getting this error. Changing the underscore to a hyphen fixed my problem.\n\nA: Two things to check (assuming your machine is called my-machine, you can change this as appropriate):\n\n\n*\n\n*That the /etc/hostname file contains just the name of the machine.\n\n*That /etc/hosts has an entry for localhost. It should have something like:\n\n 127.0.0.1    localhost.localdomain localhost\n 127.0.1.1    my-machine\n\nIf either of these files aren't correct (since you can't sudo), you may have to reboot the machine into recovery mode and make the modifications, then reboot to your usual environment.\n\nA: In AWS, go to your vpc and turn on \"DNS Hostnames\".\n\nA: The symptom given in the question may correlate strongly with this more specific problem:\n$ hostname --fqdn\nhostname: Temporary failure in name resolution\n\nThere are different ways that this could be resolved, one of which is to add your hostname as localhost in /etc/hosts (as shown in several other answers).  This may be the right thing to do in general, but it isn't the only possible resolution.\nA \"fully qualified domain name\" may be supplied by an external DNS server or similar (if such is available on your network).  In this case, sudo will not complain, despite the missing entry in /etc/hosts.\n\nNote: sudo attempts to dereference the hostname, even though it isn't necessarily required, due to optional capabilities in the sudoers file.  See sudo command trying to search for hostname.\nAs long as the delay isn't too long, this error message is typically harmless.\n\nA: I had the same problem. I solved it by editing the /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname files... on the /etc/hosts file, just edit the top part as shown below.\n#vi /etc/hosts\n    127.0.0.1   localhost\n    127.0.1.1   localhost  myhostname\n\n\n\n\n#vi /etc/hostname\n    myhostname\n\n\nA: If you are using Vagrant, then login into the guest and run\n    apt-get --no-install-recommends install virtualbox-guest-utils\n", "Q: Way to turn on WAN antenna (mobile broadband) while leaving LAN antenna (wifi) off?

I could have both on, both off, or one on and one off.\nUsing my laptop's Fn keyboard shortcut to activate the antennas in Ubuntu appears to be an all on or all off action. Battery life when using Ubuntu is not the greatest. So I was thinking it might be helpful to make sure that unnecessary antennas are not on when they don't need to be. So when I am away from home and using Mobile Broadband is there a way I can disable the WiFi antenna, and vice versa for when I am at home?\n\nA: yes!  I just discovered this recently myself - rfkill lets you manage switching all your various radio devices\nrfkill list\nto show devices, and their on/off (aka \"block/unblock\") status\nrfkill unblock wwan\nshould switch on your built in 3g.  man rfill for more info!\n", "Q: CSS editor with real-time preview and selector localization The title says everything about what I'm looking for. Basically it should be an software that collects all styles of a website so I can edit them and save them.\nPlease read the question carefully, because I want all mentioned conditions to be met.\nEDIT: I want to be more clear here or rather describe my desired workflow. Starting situation will be that you have the sources of the website on your local machine.\nNow I want to open the plain sources (HTML/CSS) in my editor/IDE/whatever (no WYSIWYG!). And I want a live preview right next to it or in different window (not in another tab!), I want to see it as I edit the source. The preview should be updated automatically (or when I save the file which essentially would be the same because CTRL+S is kind of a reflex :P).\nAdditionally it should have an inspector that works like those in Firebug or Chrom(e|ium). When I click on a CSS selector in that inspector, the cursor should jump right to it in the respective source file.\nANOTHER EDIT: Found this https://stackoverflow.com/q/4680109/220652. Almost the same problem.\n\nA: This question seems to have already been discussed but you are more specifically talking about a CSS Editor. And I am sure that's why they haven't marked your question as duplicated.\nHowever, what I can suggest you is the usage of several tools which I have posted in answers to other questions, like this: Dreamweaver alternative in ubuntu?, and even when I can bet that you have already seen it, I transcript it here for your convenience:\n\nYour question seems to be a little bit ambiguous.\nFirst of all and related to the alternative to Dreamweaver, I found\n  all the suggestions of all the other answers excellent, but when\n  looking for an alternative to Dreamweaver, the closest application\n  -for me- it was the Amaya Project. Which seems to be richest than\n  other alternatives and a little bit more sophisticated than the\n  Kompozer.\nA screenshot from the official web is here for you to see it in\n  action: \n\nAdditional screenshots can be reached by clicking the next link:\n  http://www.w3.org/Amaya/screenshots/Overview.html\nYou may find it a little bit unstable, or at least it was for me but\n  it may also fit your needs.\nAfter playing with WYSIWYG editors, I prefered direct encoding with\n  BlueFish but it is not a WYSIWYG editor.\nAnd about the suggestions for your issue with the firebug I can't say\n  anything, sorry.\nPlease let us know how did you do if you give Amaya a chance. \nGood luck!\nEdit\n  == After installing Amaya, I find it yet far from stable but somehow\n  it seems to have a better features than other applications, if you\n  consider that other software are simple Text Editors and Amaya is like\n  a WYSIWYG editor.\nI tested what you said in your comment and I found that Amaya don't\n  even get noticed that something changed in the files/folders\n  structure/name. Which won't fit your needs related to this.\nIn the next screenshot you can see I renamed the \"resources\" folder to\n  \"resources1\" and Amaya is yet showing it as \"resources\" and there is\n  no way to force it refresh. Even after restarting the software and\n  loading the project again, Amaya won't notice it.\n\nI am going to follow your question closely hoping somebody come and\n  drop a good alternative.\nGood luck!\n\nAlso, in the answers of other users to the same questions I found the \"Blue Griffon Web Editor\" which seems to be the only stable web editor that features a real time preview window, that -btw- can't be seen in split mode. You can only see the code or the WYSIWYG preview, not both at the same time.\nScreenshots placed here for your convenience:\nPreview Screen:\n\nCode Screen:\n\nThis tool includes lots of useful tools but some of the add-ons or plugins may be non-free (paid). Which reduces the attraction to it.\nThe Aptana Studio 3, which I reccomend in this answer: Basic Web Development IDE/Editor like Dreamweaver? is -for me- the best tool for programming, since I can live preview using a web browser in my dual view extended desktop. Which may be not your case.\nThat's what I can suggest. Sorry if this don't fit your needs and...\nGood luck!\n\nA: Ok, everbody listen! Geany is just AWESOME! It has a plugin that adds a browser preview. You can place it in the sidebar, in the \"bottombar\" or in an extra window. And now the two extra bonus bad ass killer features. 1. This browser uses WebKit. That means, it has this awesome inspector! 2. The browser reloads when you save an open document.\nBesides this it has so many other awesome features but you should try it yourself. I for one just fell in love. Here you have a screenshot:\n\n\nA: Sorry folks, but I will answer my own question. I just found Stylebot. It meets almost all conditions I have. It doesn't have any auto completion but I can live with that.\nHere is a screenshot. The sidebar is Stylebot. You have a basic editing mode where you can quickly edit some simple properties, an advanced mode where you can edit the plain CSS for the selected element and with \"Edit CSS\" you can edit the whole CSS for the page.\n\n\nA: Try the Firefox addon Firediff. It integrates with Firebug adding the \"Changes\" tab, which, as the zen-like name suggests, shows any changes you make to the CSS or DOM.\nRight click a CSS change in the \"Changes\" tab to save either a diff or a snapshot of your changes.\n\nThere is also cssUpdater, though I haven't used it.\nAs for \"selector localisation\", I'm not totally sure what you mean but there is selectBug, which you can download here.\n\nA: There are a few options.\nCurrently I simply use Google Chrome's Developer Tools (Action Video) as it allows for a wide range of inspection, detailed reporting, and over-riding. After making my changes I just copy the updated CSS and over write the relevant sections of the CSS file, refresh, continue plugging away.\nHere I have edited a definition in Chrome's Developer Tool\n\nI can follow the file name and line number (after copying the changes) and just paste them into the editor\n\nBeyond that there is a tool recently launched called WebPutty which is designed to alleviate your described problem. While I haven't used it personally yet it's developed by Joel Spolsky's company Fog Creek Software (Joel is also Co-Founder of StackOverflow) So I'd be willing to bet it's a relatively stable, simple, and effective product.\n\nA: Aptana Studio is a great IDE but if I'm not wrong, it doesn't have Real-Time Preview.\nAnyway, if u r interested: http://www.aptana.com/products/studio3\nP.S: It has a Hot-Key set for Preview so it's not that big of a deal.\n\nA: Not software per se, but the Stylish Addon (chrome and firefox) updates a page automatically when you save an override stylesheet. Unlike FireBug, it does save it so you can copy and paste it into a proper .css file when you're satisfied.\n\nA: just a couple of weeks ago a new player raised on this field. I'm talkng about Adobe's open source code editor Brackets. \nAll the info you need, here:\nhttps://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Linux-Version\nThe version spring30 was just released a couple of days ago :)\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How do I automount a fake raid? Hardware\n\n\n*\n\n*Asus K8N4-E Deluxe Mobo\n\n*Sil 3114 fake raid, onboard\n\n*2 Seagate 250 gb hd, hosting my /home\n\n*A backup on a separate hard disk of /home\n\n\nWhat I have so far\nI've made the raid using the Sil 3114 firmware. I'm using raid level 1. I have a bash script I run as root as soon as I get a prompt:\ndmraid -ay\nmount /dev/mapper/sil*1 /home\n\nThe problem\nI have to logon as root and use that stupid bash script every boot. Ubuntu isn't automatically understanding the raid volume. I haven't put the raid volume in fstab because it doesn't exist on boot. How do I have /home from my fakeraid automounted at boot?\n\nA: Here are the steps needed to setup fakeraid and get relevant partitions auto-mounted:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the dmraid package: \nsudo apt-get install dmraid\n\n\n*Reboot (this is because dmraid adds itself into initramfs)\n\n*The fakeraid device should appear e.g.:\n$ ls /dev/mapper/*\nbrw-rw---- 1 root disk 252,   0 Dec  6 16:21 /dev/mapper/isw_dhdhchcbaf_Dima\nbrw------- 1 root root 252,   1 Dec  6 16:21 /dev/mapper/isw_dhdhchcbaf_Dima1\ncrw------- 1 root root  10, 236 Dec  6 16:22 /dev/mapper/control\n\nAbove, *Dima is the fakeraid device, while *Dima1 is the partition. If you don't have *N, you need to create a partition table, create a partition, format ot with a filesystem and reboot again.\n\n*In Ubuntu, all partitions are mounted by UUID by default. Let's find out UUID:\n$ sudo blkid\n[sudo] password for xnox: \n/dev/sda: TYPE=\"isw_raid_member\" \n/dev/sdb: TYPE=\"isw_raid_member\" \n/dev/mapper/isw_dhdhchcbaf_Dima1: UUID=\"92edd1fd-94c5-4617-b829-fa4a8378b7ae\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sdc1: UUID=\"A904-D2E7\" TYPE=\"vfat\" \n/dev/sdc2: UUID=\"6669d411-80c3-41cc-a629-ad84e1ee6854\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sdc3: UUID=\"2bf263f1-753f-4b2e-92a6-b00381515e0c\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n/dev/sdd1: UUID=\"C499-1A68\" TYPE=\"vfat\" \n\nSee that the wanted one is UUID=\"92edd1fd-94c5-4617-b829-fa4a8378b7ae\"\n\n*Therefore the /etc/fstab entry would be:\nUUID=\"92edd1fd-94c5-4617-b829-fa4a8378b7ae\" /srv/dima ext4 defaults 0 0\n\n\nA: This should just work as the dmraid package installs hooks into the ramdisk\nto probe fake raid devices. If that isn't working then you have a real bug.\nTo get back to a sane baseline please perform:\nsudo -s\napt-get install --reinstall dmraid\nupdate-initramfs -u -k all\nreboot\n\nIf that device still isn't showing up in /dev/mapper then please file a bug.\n\nA: I believe @ppetraki is correct about this being a bug in the version of ubuntu this was about. A good workaround is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Write an upstart service that runs dmraid -ay when the system boots.\n\n*In fstab, mount the devices by their UUID\n\n\nA: Does your Volume Name have spaces in it?\nI came across your problem, while researching my own.  In my case the volume was called \"Big Data Volume\".  dmraid mapped that as /dev/mapper/isw_gdghjicjaBig%x20Data%x20Volume, but other parts of the process continued to try and use \"/dev/mapper/isw_gdghjicja_Big Data Volume\" and failed.\nI went back into Windows (I presume that's why you too are using dmraid, to dual-boot Windows), and Intel's Matrix Storage manager, and renamed my volume to Big_Data_Volume.  Linux then booted, and mounted the mirrored volume correctly, without me doing anything else.\n\nA: try this in fstab:\n/dev/mapper/sil*1  /home  reiserfs  user,nosuid,exec,nodev  0  0 \n\nThen do sudo mount -a or reboot \n\nA: You don't have to do anything normally; it just works out of the box.  Ubuntu runs dmraid to activate the volume as soon as it is detected, unless you did something odd.  Ideas that come to mind are you compiled your own dmraid instead of installing it through the package manager, or you boot with the nodmraid kernel argument.  You might also check and make sure that sudo blkid identifies the underlying disks as sil raid components.\nBy the way, fakeraid is not as well supported as mdadm raid, so unless you are dual booting with windows, you should ditch the fakeraid and go with mdadm.\n", "Q: apt-get install python-software-properties dependency problems So, I was trying to add a repository using add-apt-repository and I got this error:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gijzelaar/opencv2\n[sudo] password for foo: \nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/bin/add-apt-repository\", line 8, in <module>\n    from softwareproperties.SoftwareProperties import SoftwareProperties\nImportError: No module named softwareproperties.SoftwareProperties\n\nLike a n00b, I thought it would be a good idea to simply uninstall and reinstall python-software-properties using apt.\nUpon reinstall, i got this:\nfoo@ubuntu:/$ sudo apt-get install python-software-properties\nReading package lists...

I have a problem here with mouse sensitivity. I open mouse settings to increase the sensitivity to maximum and the mouse is slower. I make it minimum sensitivity (through the slider) and the mouse is incredibly fast.\nIs this a bug or do I just not get it?\n\nA: I think this makes sense, but it's just unintuitive. Let's imagine you move the mouse 1 cm. During that time, the mouse takes a series of readings about it's location which then determine where the mouse should move on the screen.\nIf the mouse sensitivity is very high, it might take 1000 readings during that 1 cm. Each of those readings corresponds to a piece of data determining where the mouse moves.\nNow suppose we set the sensitivity very low. Now it might only take 100 readings during the same 1 cm (because it's less sensitive to movement). But since these two actions correspond to the same movement of the mouse, the cursor will need to \"jump\" a little bit to fill in the \"gaps\" in data. That is, since your measurement is less fine, the movement on the screen is correspondingly jumpy, which might make it seem faster.\nPersonally, changing the setting between the maximum and minimum barely has any noticeable difference to me. But I imagine this has more to do with hardware (both the mouse and the display) than anything else.\nI could be wrong, and maybe this is a hardware bug, but that's how I see it.\n", "Q: How to configure LVM & LUKS to autodecrypt partition? I have recently installed ubuntu server 11.04 with the full lvm encryption(installed from the setup) . I wish now to use a key file to do automatic unlock.

I ignore it and continue the others steps and reboot but nothing happened and it ask for the passphrase .\nThanks for the help .\n\nA: Improving Randy Orrison's answer, here is a small script I created, that will make system fallback to asking user for password if it fails to find the keyfile.\n#!/bin/sh\n\nask_for_password () {\n    cryptkey=\"Unlocking the disk $cryptsource ($crypttarget)\\nEnter passphrase: \"\n    if [ -x /bin/plymouth ] && plymouth --ping; then\n        cryptkeyscript=\"plymouth ask-for-password --prompt\"\n        cryptkey=$(printf \"$cryptkey\")\n    else\n        cryptkeyscript=\"/lib/cryptsetup/askpass\"\n    fi\n    $cryptkeyscript \"$cryptkey\"\n}\n\ndevice=$(echo $1 | cut -d: -f1)\nfilepath=$(echo $1 | cut -d: -f2)\n\n# Ask for password if device doesn't exist\nif [ ! -b $device ]; then\n    ask_for_password\n    exit\nfi\n\nmkdir /tmp/auto_unlocker\nmount $device /tmp/auto_unlocker\n\n# Again ask for password if device exist but file doesn't exist\nif [ ! -e /tmp/auto_unlocker$filepath ]; then\n    ask_for_password\nelse\n    cat /tmp/auto_unlocker$filepath\nfi\n\numount /tmp/auto_unlocker\n\nSave it and replace keyscript=/lib/cryptsetup/scripts/passdev in /etc/crypttab with the path to this file and run sudo update-initramfs -uv and you are done.\n\nA: These instructions from howtoforge.com got me up and running with an automatically decrypting volume.\nHow to: Automatically Unlock LUKS Encrypted Drives With A Keyfile\nStep 1: Create a random keyfile\nsudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/root/keyfile bs=1024 count=4\n\nStep 2: Make the keyfile read-only to root\nsudo chmod 0400 /root/keyfile\n\nThat will make the keyfile readable only by root. If someone get access to this keyfile, then you have a bigger problem on your computer anyway.\nAlternatively chown your desired keyfile to root:root and move it into the /root folder\nStep 3: Add the keyfile to LUKS\nLUKS/dm_crypt enabled devices may hold up to 10 different keyfiles/passwords. So, next to having the already setup password we're going to add this keyfile as additional authorization method.\nsudo cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sdX /root/keyfile\n\nsdX is of course your LUKS device.\nFirst you'll be prompted to enter an (existing) password to unlock the drive. If everything works well, you should get an output like this:\nEnter any LUKS passphrase:\nkey slot 0 unlocked.\nCommand successful.\n\nStep 4: Create a mapper\nLUKS devices need to create a mapper that can then be referenced in the fstab. Open /etc/crypttab\nsudo nano /etc/crypttab\n\nand add then a line like this:\nsdX_crypt      /dev/sdX  /root/keyfile  luks\n\nor you can use the UUID of the device:\nsdX_crypt      /dev/disk/by-uuid/247ad289-dbe5-4419-9965-e3cd30f0b080  /root/keyfile  luks\n\nsdX_crypt is the name of the mapper that is being created. You can use here any name e.g. \"music\" or \"movies\" or \"sfdsfawe\" ....\nSave and close the file by issuing ctrl-x, enter, enter. Ctrl-x closes nano but first it asks to save the file [yes = enter] and what the name shall be [same name = enter].\nWhat we have done there actually is telling that /root/keyfile shall be used instead of password entry to unlock the drive.\nStep 5: Mount the device in fstab\nNow, we have an unlocked device (well, not yet but when the system is being booted up) and we just need to mount it now. Open /etc/fstab:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nand add a new entry like:\n/dev/mapper/sdX_crypt  /media/sdX     ext3    defaults        0       2\n\nMake sure you have the correct mapper name that you added in step 4. Also make sure that the mount point/folder exists. After having added it, save again the file and close it (ctrl-x, enter, enter).\nStep 6: Reboot or remount\nThat's it. Now you can reboot and the additional devices should be auto-unlocked and mounted. You can also test it by remounting all devices:\nsudo mount -a\n\n\nA: I've just been through this on my new home server, it took a lot of googling and guessing, but I've got it working.  I'll attempt to reproduce the steps here.  I'm using Ubuntu Server 11.10, and started with a pretty much standard install using encrypted LVM, so I'll just relate the changes I made from there.\nSetup:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda1 is my unencrypted /boot partition\n\n*/dev/sda5 is my lvm partition which contains everything else -- root, swap, and home\n\n*/dev/sdc1 is the partition on my USB flash drive where I'll store the keyfile\n\n\nFirst, I created a keyfile, just in my home directory:\ndd if=/dev/urandom of=keyfile bs=512 count=4\n\n(you can use a larger blocksize or count for a larger key)\nTell cryptsetup the new key (it's the contents that are important, not the filename):\nsudo cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sda5 keyfile\n\nThen, I formatted my USB flash drive with ext2 and gave it a label.  I used a label, so that later I can mount it by label, and replace the USB flash drive in case something goes wrong with it.\nsudo mkfs -t ext2 /dev/sdc1\nsudo e2label /dev/sdc1 KEYS\n\n(of course, your device will vary)\nNow, copy the keyfile to the USB flash drive, owned by root mode 400:\nmkdir KEYS\nsudo mount /dev/sdc1 KEYS\nsudo cp keyfile KEYS\nsudo chown root KEYS/keyfile\nsudo chmod 400 KEYS/keyfile\n\nModify /etc/crypttab.  Mine originally contained\nsd5_crypt UUID=(...) none luks\n\nwhich I changed to\nsd5_crypt UUID=(...) /dev/disk/by-label/KEYS:/keyfile luks,keyscript=/lib/cryptsetup/scripts/passdev\n\nFinally, update the initramfs:\nsudo update-initramfs -uv\n\nIt now boots using the keyfile on the USB flash drive.  If I remove the flash drive (say, when I go on holiday) it doesn't boot and my data is secure.\nIf anyone knows how to get it to ask for the passphrase if the USB flash drive is missing, that would be handy as a fallback.  Hope this helps, any additions or corrections would be more than welcome!\n\nA: @deitch \nI had the same setup like @Randy Orrison and ran into the same issue as you and it turns out is a bug of systemd which tries to mount the / filesystem again as it finds the corresponding entry in /etc/crypttab.\nTo resolve this i just removed the entry for sda5_crypt from /etc/crypttab once the update-initramfs -uv command was ran.\nReeboot and everything works fine as intended.\n", "Q: Two Ubuntu partitions with different swap partitions I have installed two Ubuntu partitions and they appear to be using two different swap partitions.  Is this a safety thing or is it a waste of space?  If the latter, how do I set up one Ubuntu to use the other's swap partition?\n\nA: It's a waste of space - when installing the second Ubuntu you could've just pointed it to the existing swap partition. Actually, I even think the installer automatically configures an existing swap partition to be used if it can find one.\nTo fix the situation (well, if you consider it a problem), you need to open /etc/fstab file of one of the ubuntus, locate the line which mentions \"swap\" and change the device name (or partition UUID) there. \nThe line would look something like\n# /dev/sda2\nUUID=69222dd6-31ea-488e-a4c1-8f5a5fbba098 none            swap    sw              0       0\n\nso you can change it to\n/dev/sdb5 none            swap    sw              0       0\n\nor, even better, find the UUID of the swap partition and use it instead:\nsudo blkid /dev/sdb5\n/dev/sdb5: LABEL=\"SWAP-sdb5\" UUID=\"69222dd6-31ea-488e-a4c1-8f5a5faac456\" TYPE=\"swap\"\n\n", "Q: How to switch between hybrid Graphics Intel/nVidia?

I have a laptop (Dell Inspiron 11z) and and SSD (Samsung 128GB) on order.\nOn my current laptop, I have a spinning HDD and use LVM and LUKS encryption.\nI would like to use LUKS on the SSD but from doing a bit of research I am not sure if this is desirable/possible.\nIt seems that LUKS (possibly???) may prevent TRIM from working.\nI can't find any concrete info on this and lots of the info on SSDs such as alignment etc seems to be out of date.\nWill TRIM work with LUKS? Because a laptop may be prone to theft, I like to have my data properly encrypted so this is important to me\n\nA: TRIM does not work for LUKS encrypted partitions because the data being written on the disk is encrypted, even if a block is \"empty\" according to the filesystem. From cryptsetup 1.4 and later (supplied with 12.04 Precise) and Linux 3.1 (not supplied with Precise), TRIM can be enabled (it is not enabled by default for security reasons). See also TRIM on an encrypted SSD\nIf you begin to notice a big performance decrease, you should consider backing up the data, clearing your SSD and put the data back. (this may be a reinstall too)\nWhether TRIM is supported or not for LUKS encrypted partitions, I'd certainly enable it unless your data isn't worth anything.\n\nA: LUKS does not allow TRIM by befault, because of security concerns.\nGiven the right versions of kernel and cryptsetup you can enable it though, either manually or on boot.\nI have posted a step by step guide to enabling TRIM with LUKS encrypted partitions in Ubuntu 12.04 or any Debian with cryptsetup 1.4+ and Kernel 3.1+. (Feel free to copy it here if some askubuntu guidelines deem it necessary.)\n\nA: It is possible to trim it manually with fstrim tool if everything configured correctly (subject is covered in various howtos).

(11.04) tl;dr \nInstalling Wubi 11.04 over Win7Pro (64-bit) on a Dell Latitude E5520 has now taken over an hour to reach the halfway mark in the \"Copying files...\" stage. The hard drive appears inactive for long periods No network connection, Wifi is on and networks available, system is responsive. But just oh so slow. What gives?\nFull story\nI've finally unpacked my new Dell Latitude E5520. My first move was to install Windows 7 Pro (64-bit) from scratch, followed by Ubuntu using Wubi. I'm using Wubi because the system comes with three paritions (Recovery, OS, and something else - boot booster?) and I like having a data partition available so I can blank the OSes without having to restore my data. That brings the partition count to the maximum four. Besides, for similar reasons I've been using Wubi on my Eee 1015P netbook. Wubi makes so little impact that I've never gotten around to replacing it with a proper installation.\nSo, I downloaded Wubi and ran it while online. The Windows phase of the installation goes ahead without any problems at all. I selected a username and password, regular Ubuntu flavour, and assigned the maximum 30GB for the Ubuntu filesystem. I then reboot into Ubuntu by my own choosing. The Wubi install proceeds to \"Copying files...\" and copies the files. Slowly. Not just user-impatience slowly, really slowly. Getting to the halfway mark took over an hour, and there are long periods (nearly 15 minutes at one point) where there was no apparent hard disk activity. The HD light doesn't flicker and the fan switches off for a few minutes at a time. The system is responsive (I can move the cursor with the mouse or touchpad, for example), just nothing seems to be happening.\nWhen I first tried this, I thought the installation had failed, so I hard-rebooted my machine back into Windows and removed Ubuntu. I then downloaded the ISO manually, unplugged the network, and tried Ubuntu again. Since I have more time to spare, I've left it longer, with the drop-down terminal section open to see if any errors were coming up. I don't think so, since each file seems to be followed by something like\ndebconf (filter): widget found for ubiquity/install/title\ndebconf (filter): --> 0 OK\n\nbut it's still crazy slow. The current file is taking more than 25 minutes. The only notable thing I can think of is that the Wifi is on and there are networks available. There isn't a hardware Wifi button. I guess I could've disabled it in the BIOS, but I've now progressed further than I did before, and I suspect it's working. Just excruciatingly slowly. I don't remember this happening when I installed 10.10 on my Eee.\nEventually, I think the screensaver kicked in, which led to an unresponsive blank black screen. I hard-rebooted again, but disabled the Wifi in the BIOS on the way. I went straight back to Ubuntu (i.e. I didn't reinstall via Wubi). The same sluggishness seems to be persisting, though: slow copying and long idle phases.\n\nA: Following the advice in the comments, it seems that disabling the Wifi sped things up. I don't know if the system kept trying to connect to one of the networks instead of copying files or something.\nAlternatively, if the Wifi wasn't what helped, then just keep trying. For me, the install finished on the third attempt.\n\nA: For others stumbling on this page (like myself) that have the same Wubi installation problem (except that I'm using 32bit), see this series of postings in Ubuntuforums where this is answered in detail. Particularly, post #8. \nAlso, note that this didn't actually work for me. I finally installed the 11.10 wubi release which configures the install in windows without having to reboot to do the installation (I'm using Windows 7 on a Dell Inspiron E1505).\n", "Q: Keyboard layouts failing to apply I have an Ubuntu 11.04 install for which I can't seem to get the correct (UK English) keyboard mapping set on.

I'm working on a desktop machine with plenty of screen real-estate, so I don't need my windows' title bars to merge with the global menu bar when the windows are maximised. Moreover, I'm working on a dual-screen set-up, so the fact that a window is maximised doesn't mean that it's the only window visible.\nBefore Unity I'd switch to a maximised window by clicking on its title bar, or close the window, even though it isn't focused, by clicking on its close button; I can no longer do this because the title bar is missing and the global menu bar is empty on that screen. This isn't a huge problem - I can click on some of the window's chrome to focus it - but it's unintuitive and it's forcing me to relearn my mousing behaviour.\nI'd like to turn-off the merging of title and global menu bars, but how?\nEDIT:\nI simply want the title bar of the window NOT to merge with the top panel whenever I maximize a Window.

If you have the GUI frontend \"gconf-edtor\" installed, just launch it and navigate to /apps/metacity/general, then un-check “show_maximized_titlebars” to remove the maximized window titlebar.\n\nOr, you can execute this command in terminal to remove it:\ngconftool --type bool --set /apps/metacity/general/show_maximized_titlebars false\n\nRun this to re-enable it:\ngconftool --type bool --set /apps/metacity/general/show_maximized_titlebars true\n\n\nA: As far as I understand, this is not yet possible (there is some talk of bringing it to Ubuntu 12.04 or 12.10, but we will have to wait and see).

Don't know why, but WinUSB worked so I didn't investigate further.)\nThis is what I do to create a bootable USB drive for UEFI firmware:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a GPT partition table on your USB drive. In GParted, chose \"Device\" and then \"Create partition table...\". Choose gpt in the dropdown.\n\n*Format a partition on the USB drive to FAT32 using GParted. All UEFI compliant firmwares must support FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32, so any of these should be fine, but NTFS will not work.\n\n*Mount the USB drive like you would any other external storage so you can access the filesystem on the partition you created.\n\n*Mount the ISO you wish to add to the USB drive so you can access the files in there.\n\n*Now, when you have access to both the ISO and the USB drive as filesystems in your file manager (Nautilus or whatever) just copy and paste all files in the ISO to the USB drive.\n\n*Add the 'boot' flag to the partition you've created and added the files to. In GParted, right click the partition, choose \"manage flags\" and then check the \"boot\" option. \n\n\n(While testing this I couldn't mount the USB drive anymore after setting the boot flag. I don't know why, but GParted could still see it and the end result was still a bootable USB drive, so I guess it doesn't really matter.)\n\n\n*Restart your computer and choose to boot from the USB drive.\n\n\nOnce again: Please note that for this to work, your computer's firmware must be UEFI compliant and the ISO must be ready for UEFI boot. \nIf you find an EFI directory in the ISO that's usually a good sign. \nTo see whether you're currently using UEFI boot, run sudo efibootmgr -v in a terminal. If it lists a number of boot options you're good to go. If you're using BIOS compatibility mode you'll see something like this:\nFatal: Couldn't open either sysfs or procfs directories for accessing EFI variables.\nTry 'modprobe efivars' as root.\n\nFor more information on UEFI, please read this excellent essay on the subject: https://www.happyassassin.net/2014/01/25/uefi-boot-how-does-that-actually-work-then/\nAlso, I don't think Ubuntu will work with Secure Boot enabled, so you'll have to disable that to be able to use UEFI boot with Ubuntu.\n\nA: I know that question is a bit outdated, but for the sake of compleetness I add a link to a modern standard Ubuntu GUI application for burning iso on a flash drive: Disk Creator.\n\nA: If you're using Ubuntu to burn Windows ISO to USB you could use WinUSB. Unetbootin won't work with Windows ISOs. It supports only Linux distros.\nHowever, installing WinUSB on current Ubuntu versions is not an easy task. More than that WinUSB has older GRUB dependencies that may interfere with your bootloader setup, so you may end up with a non-bootable Ubuntu. Well that shouldn't be such a big problem if you were making a Windows USB to get rid of Ubuntu. But that is not guaranteed either.\nCurrently there are two methods for booting an operating system. EFI loading and MBR loading. Which one is suitable for you depends on the PC/motherboard capabilities. The method for creating a bootable USB for each of the above mentioned boot loading methods is described on How can I create a Windows bootable USB stick with Ubuntu?\nWinUSB can only make MBR bootable USB drive.\n\nA: Ubuntu can mount .iso files from nautilus in Natty. \nHave you tried copying the contents of the .iso to the desired USB drive? \nFrom there you should be able to tell your PC to boot from the USB with no problems. \nIf that Fails to work you can use UNetBootin in order to copy/burn the .iso to disk.\nThis blog post Describes how to do that.\n", "Q: Optimize Ubuntu install on USB-drive for longer life I've got an Ubuntu installed on an USB-drive for portable use.

I have even tried VLC and movie player, both of which failed.\n\nA: You may be in the need to install Restricted Extras on your system. You can do it by dropping sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras in a terminal\nAdditionally, information provided in this page can be useful, specially this which refers to Real Media, posted here for your convenience.\n\nIntroduction\nRealPlayer is a media player originally developed by RealNetworks in\n  1995. It supports a number of audio and video codecs such as\n  realaudio, realvideo, mp3, ogg vorbis and theora, h263, and AAC.\n  RealPlayer for Linux is based on the open-source Helix Player which\n  can be found at the Helix Community Website.\nPlease Note: RealPlayer is proprietary software, is not supported by\n  the Ubuntu community, and is not available from the official Ubuntu\n  repositories. It is located in the non-free section of third-party\n  repositories which the user must specifically enable.\n\nWhich lead us to the possibility of the installation (alternatively, of course), of the Real Media Player for Linux, which seems to be discontinued but you can find older versions in the \"Helix and RealPlayer Archive\"\nHowever, the installation of the sole codec should do the trick. I suggest you  to try the restricted extras in first instance and to try again the .rm playback using your favorite media player.\nGood luck!\n\nA: \nMPlayer plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI, Ogg/OGM, VIVO, ASF/WMA/WMV,\n  QT/MOV/MP4, FLI, RM, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM, RoQ, PVA files,\n  supported by many native, XAnim, RealPlayer, and Win32 DLL codecs. It\n  can also play VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, RealMedia, and DivX movies.\n\nSMPlayer (GUI for MPlayer)\n\nA: Ubuntu restricted (install as said above or in Synaptic or Ubuntu Software Center) is a must as far as I am concerned. Many other problems may be solved this way. It worked for me and didn't have to agree to anything like eula etc. Nothing wrong having the microsoft fonts. As far as a better option is concerned, a \"better\" one has to be a possible one. This one works. SMPLAYER is a must too. Anyway, the fact that VLC didn't do the trick in the fist place might point to a special problem with the file. \nBut finally you might want to try Real Player for linux (here)\n", "Q: Encrypted LVM not accepting my passphrase anymore I have Ubuntu 11.04 on Thinkpad X41 and have been using it for a couple of months. From time to time System Update used to run and show me a list of recommended updates.

I guess there might be something about this Intel AES-NI but no idea how to fix it.\n\nA: The Intel AES-NI instructions are not present in all CPUs. That warning shows up on my LVM every time I boot and is not the reason, why your LVM cannot be unlocked.\nDo you have a custom keyboard layout defined? Not sure, whether this also applies to LVM, but TrueCrypt always uses US keyboard layout on startup. Maybe your keyboard layout was switch during update due to some overwritten config file?\nIf nothing helps, try booting from a Ubuntu USB stick oder a Ubuntu CD and try mounting your LVM volume in the live system. But don't use the 11.04 image: I think I remember trying to change my LVM using that one and LVM didn't install on that live image.\n\nA: I had the same problem and I still have the problem with newer kernels. So, stick with 3.2.0.24-generic kernel. After that, all Ubuntu kernels don't accept my passphrase.\n", "Q: How to set up a virtual machine with VirtualBox I have decided to set up a virtual console on my laptop to be able to test stuff like other distros. I have never attempted such things before so I'm a bit hesitant and therefore I need a complete step by step guide for such an operation using the virtualbox.deb I have downloaded. Any other tips is also welcome.\n\nA: In addition to the installation instructions already provided, a couple of tips on using VirtualBox, especially one on file sharing between the host and guest machines, can be found in a series of blog entries starting at: http://linuxnorth.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/entering-a-virtual-world/   The first blog entry (\"Entering a virtual world\") discusses installation of VirtualBox directly from the Ubuntu Software Centre.  The two subsequent posts (\"Virtually in control\" and \"Opening a window to the virtual world\") are essentially tweaks for using the virtual machine.   \n\nA: To begin with, you can simply double-click the DEB file you've downloaded to open the Software Center. Then simply click the 'Install' button to install the package:\n\nOnce the package is installed, press the super key (typically a button on your keyboard with the Windows logo) and begin typing 'VirtualBox'. When the VirtualBox icon appears, click it to start the application:\n\nAt this point you will be presented with the VirtualBox main window:\n\n     * Click for larger image\nNote that in the screenshot above, I already have a number of virtual machines - since you are just starting with VirtualBox, you won't have any yet. To create one, click on the \"New\" button in the toolbar. You will be presented with the \"New Virtual Machine Wizard\":\n\n     * Click for larger image\nThe wizard will begin by asking you for a name and OS Type for your virtual machine. You may enter whatever name you like - what is entered here will be displayed in the main window later when you go to start your virtual machine. OS Type consists of a list of operating systems and specific versions / distros underneath. For example, if you are giving Fedora a try, select Linux in the OS drop-down and then Fedora in the version drop-down.\nThe next step asks you for the amount of memory to assign to the virtual machine. In most cases, VirtualBox picks a sensible default based on the information you provided in the previous page and the amount of memory you have installed. Just accept the value and click \"Next\".\nThe next step asks what virtual hard disk should be used for your virtual machine. Since you don't have any virtual hard disks yet, leave the \"Create New Hard Disk\" option selected and click \"Next\". You will then be guided through the process of creating a new virtual hard disk.\nWhen creating the virtual hard disk, you will first be asked whether you want to create a dynamically expanding hard disk or a fixed size one. Since the fixed size disk will occupy a huge amount of space, I would suggest going with the \"Dynamically Resizing Hard Disk\" option. The next step is to give it a name (you can just leave that at its default) and select its size. You will need to check the website of your OS to find out the minimum amount of space required. Generally, 10GB should be enough for most Linux distributions while still providing some room to install applications, etc. Once you have finished with the \"Create New Virtual Disk\" wizard, you will be returned to the \"New Virtual Machine Wizard\". Click \"Next\" and then \"Finish\" and you're done - you've just created a virtual machine!\nWe're not ready to boot it quite yet though. We need to install the operating system on it. I'll assume that you want to install a Linux OS using an ISO CD image. You'll likely need to download the 32-bit version of the OS you want to try (look for a \"32-bit\" or \"i386 / i586\" option). Once you have the ISO file, click your new virtual machine on the left in the main window and click the 'Storage' section on the right:\n\nClick the CD icon in the Storage Tree and then click the smaller CD icon on the right:\n\nSelect \"Choose a Virtual CD/DVD Disk File\" and browse to the location of the ISO file that you downloaded earlier. Now you can click OK and dismiss all of the dialogs.\nYour new virtual machine is ready to boot! Simply double-click its entry in the main window on the left and it will (hopefully) start:\n\n     * Click for larger image\nYou'll have to wait a minute or two for your new OS's installation menu / installer to load. To interact with your virtual machine, simply click inside the window. VirtualBox will display a dialog explaining how capturing the mouse works.\nHopefully that's enough to get you started.\n", "Q: How do I enable the ctrl+alt+backspace shortcut in 11.10 (gui)?

The screensaver, although enabled, activates only in the first few hours after logging in.\nWhat can be the root cause of the problem?\n\n\n*\n\n*Incorrect screensaver or blanking settings cannot be the root cause, because these features work with the current settings right after logging in.\n\n*User-visible applications (such as Firefox, Chrome, their Flash player or Skype) cannot be the root cause, because the screen doesn't blank even after I quit these. (Verified with ps ax.)\nIs there a workaround?\nHow do I debug the problem? Is there a tool which displays a counter like 1:57 seconds until blanking?\nPlease note that in this question I don't care about sleep, suspend or hibernate -- I care only about blanking the display.\n\nA: You could start by checking that gnome-screensaver is still running:\n[user@host] ~> ps ax |grep screen\n 1939 ?        Ss     0:06 gnome-screensaver\n\nIf it is running kill it with 'kill [pid]' and restart it with 'gnome-screensaver --debug'\n\nA: I've searched for hours and found two ways: \nBash Scripts: Here is a thread that has 2 ways. Post #7 is when the answers begin: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=11738584#7\nEasier way: Stop using gnome-power-manager:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install xfce4-power-manager\n\n*Don't do anything to gnome-power-manager. Keep it in your system and ignore it like an annoying classmate. If you uninstall it, it will uninstall vital Ubuntu components.\n\n*Go to System > Preferences > Startup Applications\n\n*\n\n*Find: Power Management and click Edit. Change: gnome-power-manger to xfce4-power-manger. Save. (If you add in a custom Startup Applications entry for xfce4-power-manager, it may not start. Don't know why that happens.  Editing the original Power Management is more reliable.)\n\n\n*Hit Alt-F2 and run command xfce4-power-manager-settings.  Change the settings.\n\n*Reboot. \n\n*Downside: \n\n*\n\n*The screen will darken/turn off during video apps because gnome-screensaver does not tell xfce4-power-manager to inhibit itself during video playback.\n\n*If the xfc4-power-manager works, but is unreliable, you might want to upgrade to version 1.0+ using this ppa: ppa:alexx2000/xfce\n\n*If that still doesn't work, change gnome-screensaver to xscreensaver.\n\n*If that still doesn't work, use my last option: Spend more than a week trying out different OSes, give up, and upgrade to Ubuntu/Gnome-Shell 11.10.  This problem has been solved there. Interestingly, Ubuntu 11.10 uses xscreensaver and not gnome-screensaver.\n\n\n", "Q: How to change the monitor's refresh rate? How do I change the monitor's refresh rate in Oneiric? \nThere is no option to do it in the Displays dialog now. By default it's 60Hz, but I need 75Hz on my monitor.\nIn previous releases there used to be such an option in the Displays dialog.\nEdit - Half baked solution\nThe best I could do so far was:\nxrandr -s 1280x1024 -r 75\n\nThis is perfect, but my problem is that it isn't permanent. It defaults back to 60 Hz after logging out and back in.\nPerhaps this should go into some script and added to startup? I just don't know how to do that.\n\nA: So my solution is, which seems to work well on my system:\n\n\n*\n\n*I opened up Startup Applications\n\n*I clicked Add\n\n*I typed a name and the following in the command field:\nxrandr -s 1280x1024 -r 75\nUsing this xrandr -s 1280x1024 -r 75 is run at every sytem startup and sets the refresh rate as required. There could be a better option but right now this seems to be OK for me.\nHopefully the LTS will fix the showstopper bug of no easy, gui way to change the refresh rate.\n\nA: The refresh rate for a monitor is automatically detected by Compiz.\nIf you wish to change it,  install compiz-settings-manager you can do that with the command below.\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Warning: What are some of the issues with CCSM and why would I want to avoid it?\nFind in the dash \"ccsm\" and click the composite plugin.\nUntick \"detect refresh rate\" and adjust the refresh rate to your manual setting.\n\n\nA: You should be able to use xrandr. Calculate the needed modelines for your resolution and refresh rate:\ncvt 1600 900 75\n(Here my example resolution is 1600x900.) Now create a new mode with xrandr:\nxrandr --newmode \"1600x900_75.00\"  104.00  1600 -hsync +vsync\nAdd the new mode to xrandr:\nxrandr --verbose --addmode VGA-0  \"1600x900_75.00\"\nand activate it\nxrandr --output VGA-0 --mode \"1600x900_75.00\"\nNote that your values will be different. In particular, your monitor might not be VGA. Run the xrandr command with no arguments to find out the name of your monitor and use that instead. Running xrandr -q will display a list of available outputs. \nHere's some more information on xrandr.\n\nA: In 12.04 you can change the refresh rate by modifying the rate tag in ~/.config/monitors.xml after you configure your monitor(s).

Is it worth hand editing the xorg.conf file maybe? Or am I just out of luck?\nThe graphics card (NVIDIA NVS 4200M 512MB) seems to be functioning ok. Unity and the composite effects are all working and pretty snappy.\nI did have to disable something called Optimus in the BIOS but I gather this is just a power saving thing.\n\nA: From what I understand, \"Optimus\" is the technology, which decides, when to use the dedicated Nvidia graphics card and when to use the on-board intel graphics chip.\nhttps://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Nvidia_Optimus:\n\nFor now, Nvidia has no plans to support Optimus on Linux. This makes hardware acceleration impossible by the Nvidia adapter.

In addition the display port would not work and dual-link DVI only outputted the above resolution. What I ended up doing was updating the bios to revision A07. This resolved the display issue.

As not all applications communicate with Jack, nor do I run it all the time, I would like to know if there are any alternatives.\n\nI got the 'tumbleweed' badge for this unpopular question, and thought to demystify it with a bounty and little comment :)\nFirst, I know very little about Ubuntu's underlying audio stack, as I'm new to Linux. I think that question is asked clearly for those who might know about it. Then here is what I got so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*It seems this is possible through module-ladspa-sink with which help I could load LADSPA plugin and use it globaly.\nProblem here is that I found only one LADSPA Impulse convolver plugin in Steve Harris plugins and this plugin comes with preset impulses so common user can't customize it.\nI downloaded source code, and thought that I could maybe include my impulse in it, then compile it, but format of this impulses is unknown to me as I'm not a programmer. My impulse is 32bit PCM WAV while impulses in this package are in a form of number arrays in C header files (link) so I can't find my way there. If I knew this format rules, than I guess it wouldn't be hard for me to represent my impulse following convention.\nI tried to contact Steve by mail (which is encouraged on his portal) but my mail was rejected as reported by Google Mail\n\n*Brutefir\nThis could be another possible solution, but...\nHome page was inaccessible so I used cached view to read boring documentation without single usage example. After that I searched Google for possible example usage and found some \"specialized\" examples that shred a bit of light about it, but I couldn't find anything about the meaning of .brutefir_convolver configuration file.\nThis project seems discontinued and I don't know if it is good idea even if I knew how to set it\n\n\nA: I'll post my last comment as answer as I give up from expected solution\n\n\n*\n\n*I found Steve on github and it turned out that format of this impulses included in his plugins source as header files is simple single channel normalized PCM data array.\nI replaced one of provided impulses with mine, changed two more files to accept new impulse name and successively compiled it, installed it and then test it in Audacity.\nReal world wanted to show it's face. Setting module-ladspa-sink was pain. Why does it has to be so complicated? Instead I added Impulse Convolver LADSPA plugin in my .asoundrc file and rebooted.\nResult was disappointing - sound was awful and volume fluctuating. I later found that Impulse Convolver is one of rare plugin that's not RT capable? Damn!? - It comes with preset impulses, it's mono and on top of that can't be used in real time\nConclusion: If we exclude possibility that Brutefir can be set as convolver, then except  jack_convolver there is no real Linux plugin that can provide \"the mother of all effects\" - Convolution\n\nA: Just use jack + jconvolver\nInstructions to get pulseAudio to pass everything through to Jack here:\nhttp://trac.jackaudio.org/wiki/WalkThrough/User/PulseOnJack\n\nA: This LADSPA convolver now exists: https://github.com/bmc0/dsp\nI've written up a howto here:\nhttp://mythtv-multikabel.blogspot.nl/2015/11/room-correction-using-drc-fir-and.html\n", "Q: How to recover from uninstall of ubuntu-desktop?

Can I ask it to install dependencies automatically somehow?\nThanks.\n\nA: \n'ubuntu-desktop' and several other key packages\n\nAs it may be possible to reinstall all removed packages this is a time consuming process, even more so as we obviously don't exactly know what packages and how many were removed.\nIt is safe to reinstall Ubuntu and keep all private data from your home when you take care not to choose \"Erase\" during the installation process. By choosing \"Upgrade\" as depicted below all you data in your /home are kept untouched. However you will have to reinstall additional packages that are not installed by default and you will also have to reinstall customizations you may have made outside your HOME directory.\nAs always it may still be wise to backup your data before you do so.\n\n", "Q: Basic Web Development IDE/Editor like Dreamweaver? I've used Windows for many years, using Dreamweaver as my editor as it had a file tree which is based on a project (via Local, FTP or SFTP).\nI need a web development IDE with the following functionality:\n\n\n*\n\n*syntax highlighting for PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript \n\n*file tree - Local, FTP, SFTP, Project-Based (e.g. via the methods of Local/FTP/SFTP) in other words, like Dreamweaver\n\n*can open multiple files (tabbed)\nAdditionally, I wouldn't mind features like debugging, class listings, etc, as long as I can hide them away.\n\nA: If you're looking for a simple editor I would go for gedit + gedit-ftp-browser. Gedit has a lot of extension and you can add a class browser etc...\nYou can use of course Eclipse + plugins but it's really like using a bomb to kill an ant.\n\nA: Well, there is a younger cousin of Adobe Dreamweaver. Its called Brackets. It has almost the same features as adobe Dreamweaver, and on top of that, new and amazing features like the ability to extract code hints from a .psd file, and better yet, its free... :)\n\nAlso, Brackets has a tasty feature, called live preview, whereby each and every change you make in either your css or html file in the active project is previewed instantly in a browser running alongside :\n\n\nA: I would probably have to recommend KompoZer, which is an unofficial bug-fix release of the popular application, Nvu.\n\nTo quote the KompoZer features page:\n\nFinally, a top-notch WYSIWYG web page program for the rest of us! Now there's no need to >pay a little fortune for a program to create and edit great-looking web pages, including >powerful and easy to use CSS capabilities.\nKompoZer is a complete Web Authoring System that combines web file management and easy-to-use WYSIWYG web page editing capabilities found in Microsoft FrontPage, Adobe DreamWeaver and other high end programs.\nKompoZer is designed to be extremely easy to use, making it ideal for non-technical >computer users who want to create an attractive professional-looking web site without >needing to know HTML or web coding.\n\nKompoZer version 1:0.8~b3.dfsg.1-0.1 is currently available in the maverick and natty universe repositories.\n\nA: Your question seems to be a little bit ambiguous.\nFirst of all and related to the alternative to Dreamweaver, I found all the suggestions of all the other answers excellent, but when looking for an alternative to Dreamweaver, the closest application -for me- it was the Amaya Project. Which seems to be richest than other alternatives and a little bit more sophisticated than the Kompozer.\nA screenshot from the official web is here for you to see it in action: \n\nAdditional screenshots can be reached by clicking the next link: http://www.w3.org/Amaya/screenshots/Overview.html\nYou may find it a little bit unstable, or at least it was for me but it may also fit your needs.\nAfter playing with WYSIWYG editors, I prefered direct encoding with BlueFish but it is not a WYSIWYG editor.\nAnd about the suggestions for your issue with the firebug I can't say anything, sorry.\nPlease let us know how did you do if you give Amaya a chance. \nGood luck!\nEdit\nAfter installing Amaya, I find it yet far from stable but somehow it seems to have a better features than other applications, if you consider that other software are simple Text Editors and Amaya is like a WYSIWYG editor.\nI tested what you said in your comment and I found that Amaya don't even get noticed that something changed in the files/folders structure/name. Which won't fit your needs related to this.\nIn the next screenshot you can see I renamed the \"resources\" folder to \"resources1\" and Amaya is yet showing it as \"resources\" and there is no way to force it refresh. Even after restarting the software and loading the project again, Amaya won't notice it.\n\nI am going to follow your question closely hoping somebody come and drop a good alternative.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Kompozer is a decent feature full html/css editor http://kompozer.net/features.php, u can give it a try.\n\nA: Sublime Text 3\nSublime Text has been around for a while. In a nutshell it is a pure text editor that has comparable features to TextMate, but it has a much more fluid modern GUI and is incredibly extensible which can enhance it past just a text editor.\nAs standard\nOut of the box, you get an excellent productivity tool for editing text files, with helpful functionality to make text editing a dream. Syntax highlighting is supported for all popular languages, and the less-so-popular-but-still-awesome languages are available via...\nPackages\nSublime has an ever-growing package ecosystem, that uses Python to script the editor, making it possible to transform Sublime into a full-featured IDE rather than just a standard text editor.\nThe beauty behind the way Sublime does this is that you start off with a simple text editor and only add what you need, rather than the approach of other IDEs where you start off with everything and it is really slow and confusing to learn.\nYou've also got the package control package to download and install packages automatically from within Sublime Text itself.\nGoto anything\nMaking it really simple to get at ANY feature or file with lazy searches. If you want to open a file in the project with a path of PageView/RT/Login/_Common.php you can just type pvlcom into the goto anything window.\nChanging the syntax highlighting or interacting with a package is also possible through the command palette.\nIDE features\nI use Sublime Text 3 for web development, and the package community has something for every need... I'm sure there are packages for other environments too. Here's just a breakdown of what ST3 offers me, a web developer.\n\n*\n\n*Syntax highlighting for SASS/SCSS.\n\n*Syntax highlighting for Behat / Mink.\n\n*PHPUnit package to allow class's tests to be run from the class itself.\n\n*PHP XDebug to step through your code and inspect variables at execution time.\n\n*PHP parsing. Displays errors inline in your code when there is a syntax error.\n\nThere are also many MySQL capabilities of ST3, but I have other dedicated software for that so haven't looked into it.\n\nA: Other relevant software:\n\n\n*\n\n*BlueGriffon\n\n*Amaya\n\n*Aptana Studio\n\nA: Blue Griffon is standalone editor similar to Kompozer (both come from Nvu), but it's under active development - it supports HTML5 and CSS3.\nWeb Developer addon for Firefox offers some support for live editing of CSS and HTML with saving, however it's not very robust (no syntax highlighting etc.).\nFor your Firebug question, see Stack Overflow.\nNote that some versions of Dreamweaver can be run using Wine, check out Dremweaver entry at WineHQ.\n\nA: Even when I added the accepted answer at the question mentioned by @fossfreedom, more precisely at Dreamweaver alternative in ubuntu?, in the comments of your question. I must accept that I didn't notice before the existence of Aptana Studio.\nI include here a few screenshots for you, covering some of the points of your interest.\n\nSyntax Highlight for PHP:\n\nSyntax Highlight for HTML:\n\nSyntax Highlight for CSS:\n\nSyntax Highlight for Javascript\n\nFile tree illustrated in these screenshots and this examples:\nProject Explorer:\n\nApplication Explorer:\n\nMulti-Tabbed files\nillustrated in the above screenshots.\nI have noticed that there is support for FTP/SFTP file browsing/management but these are features that I don't use so I can't provide further details but I am sure you will find it in the Aptana Studio site.\nIn my experience, I stopped using all these tools that I formerly used in order to start enjoying this excellent application, that tops all the other similar alternatives.\nI suggest you to try it. Is as easy as download and run, or follow the instructions of the producers in order to have this application installed and running in your system. For me is good to have it inside of my home folder, from where I start it by double clicking the program's icon. The application will find its updates and download to the appropriate folder when necessary.\nThere are several alternatives, like those mentioned in the previous questions, including those that features WYSIWYG editors. But this is also a great alternative.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Here are the alternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quanta Plus\n\n*Aptana Studio\n\n*Bluefish Editor\n\n\nBut you can use any other text editors to edit files like Gedit, vim, etc.\n\nA: I use BlueFish for my HTML and CSS editing, but it doesn't have a full WYSIWYG editor. Unfortunately, there is no drop in replacement for Dreamweaver on Linux. If you have a license, Dreamweaver is rated Silver on WineHQ, so you may have luck installing it with Wine, though I cannot guarantee it, and you might experience issues with the installation. You can look at the issues listed for Dreamweaver CS5 at WineHQ.\nAs far as FireBug, I usually just copy and paste the edited code into a gedit and put it where I need it from there.\nOther software includes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Blue Griffon\n\n*Kompozer\nI'm sure their's others as well. I've tried a few of the WYSIWIG ones, but I've yet to find one that comes close to Dreamweaver's abilities, although I've run those to their limits at times as well.\n\nA: I think gedit is the best editor. Because it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Light.\n\n*Has syntax higlightning.\n\n*Supports a lot of different programming languges and HTML. \n\n*pre-installed in Ubuntu.\n\n\nA: For a DW replacement software, there's probably nothing closer than Quanta, which unfortunately drags in a lot of KDE dependencies on the standard GNOME desktop.\nWhile Kompozer/Nvu let you toggle between code view and and WYSIWYG, they both lack some of the features of DW, though there's definitely a good range of features to love about each.\nMy favorite development platform is Bluefish, for its excellent syntax highlighting. \nFor a more full-featured development environment, there's Aptana, Komodo, and Eclipse.\nSome others that are very popular, but i can't personally recommend as not having worked with them much, are Geany and Screem\nA buddy of mine has a great article about web development on linux on his blog\n\nA: I never use anything more than just Gedit, which does it all fine (I program mostly directly; never WYSIWYG, gives you cleaner code). But as said before, there is also Bluefish Editor which is very good too. After having tried it myself, I only find very minor faults with it.\n\nBut Kompozer is a very good alternative, if you prefer WYSIWYG editors, although for more advanced programming I do not recommend it.\n\n\nA: Gedit with plugins is all i need for most of my html needs.\nSeamonkey-compozer which is very similar to kompozer is a cool WYSIWYG editor. It has no kde dependencies and is actively developed.\nFor PHP and the likes I love bluefish because it has got Code and syntax highlighting.\n\nA: You don't indicate whether you prefer a free product, so may I suggest PhpStorm or WebStorm, both from JetBrains. They are payware, but are not terribly expensive. The site says they are cross-platform; I haven't tried them on Linux, but they work quite nicely on Windows. They are complete standalone IDEs: the former specializes in PHP development, while the latter is a bit broader for general web development. There are free trials available, so why not given them a go?\n** No affiliation, just a satisfied customer!\n\nA: Out ther are much competition !\nSorry for what i must tell , i'm a linux enthousiast but linux software won't get you far.\nKompozer and bluegriffon are nice but they will make your life harder and you won't get a professional result so you will not go far !\nSorry ! i dont like what i'm gonna say but windows is the only solution if you are professional.\nI'm not a fan of dualbooting so i formatted my pc with windows no matter how i hate them.\nOperating system's purpose is to have available software to make your job done and not countless distributions.\nIf you want a simple webpage you can download for free bluegriffon and buy the templates addon you will find it very usefull !!\nAlso there are countless free templates online that you could use on kompozer to build your webpage faster.\nPS1: i may change my mind when ubuntu 12.04 will come cause i'm really a fan of ubuntu.\n:-)\n\nA: I have personally used KompoZer for web development since few years. I also designed the new official website for KompoZer using KompoZer itself. \nHowever, KompoZer has not been updated since some years. So I have been trying BlueGriffon for a while. It does take some time to get used to BlueGriffon but it is the closest thing you can get to Dreamweaver. Also, for scripting purposes I use Aptana Studio or Eclipse.\n\nA: I spend many time to find replacement, but true is Quanta, KompoZer and others great horror against Dreamweaver. \nSo ur can did it my way, use Wine for DW and +Firebug+GoogleDeveloperTools.\n\nA: I'd suggest Aptana Studio 3 or Titanium Studio. Both are from Appcelator. More over, with Titanium Studio, you are able to create native applications for windows, linux, mac, android and ios.\n", "Q: Any alternatives to Virtualbox for virtualization \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhat virtualization software can I use? \n\nWell as the title reads, are there any other virtualization softwares in the mould of virtualbox be it proprietory or open source? \n\nA: KVM is Ubuntu's \"official\" virtualization platform.\nsudo apt-get install qemu-kvm\n\nWill get that installed for you.

I've installed Ubuntu to my hard drive completely, and wiped my Windows 7. I do not want Ubuntu anymore; I want Windows 7 back. But when I put in my CD to reinstall Windows 7, it said my disk partition needed to be in ntfs format. I can't format my drive from here, but I can delete it, although I don't know what that would do. The other partition I have is my system recovery partition. So how do remove this partition?\n\nA: I'm pretty sure Windows installer has an option to delete partitions/use entire disk/something similar, though the last time I used it it was WinXP, not Win7.\nAt any rate, it's not a problem for Ubuntu to be concerned with, it's a problem/defect of the Windows installer :)\nHowever, if you boot from Ubuntu live CD, you should be able to delete the Ubuntu partition and you also may be able to create a new partition and assign it NTFS partition ID.\nJust to clarify: partitions have an \"ID\" attribute, so if you created a partition for Ubuntu, it's ID will be 83, which is \"Linux\". You can not just format this partition to NTFS - you need to delete it and create a new one with different ID.\nObviously, all data will be lost, so make a backup.\n\nA: Use the delete option. It will remove that partition and allow you to install Windows again, if that is what you want.\n\nA: Using the Ubuntu installation disk, you can format the drive to ntfs.\nFirst, open the gparted application.\nNext, right click on each of the partitions listed one by one and select delete to delete each one until you have nothing but free space listed.\nThen, right click on the \"free space\" select \"new\" and select partition type \"primary\" and set the format type to \"NTFS\". \nFinally, click on the green check-mark to apply the changes, this may take a little while so be patient. \nWhen you are done, exit out of Ubuntu, eject the Ubuntu disk and replace it with the Windows installation disk and you'll be good to go. \n", "Q: Do I need a desktop to run a GUI? I am setting up a light weight VM, following the guide in the Ubuntu Documentation\nWhat I want to be able to do is launch a GUI application. I don't need / want anything on the desktop.\nFirst I installed xorg. But I can't launch a gui. The next step is to install a \"Window Manager\". So I installed xfce4, and then startx launches a desktop. \nWhat do I need to launch a gui but not launch a desktop?\n\nA: If you want to control exactly what runs when you run startx you should create a .xinitrc file in your home directory.  If you make .xinitrc something very simple like:\nxfwm4 &\nxterm\n\nThen startx will run with only a window manager and a terminal.\n\nA: From gdm you can select xterm (recovery console) and it will give you a simple terminal runing on X. From it, you can start any gui app without the full desktop, like:\nnautilus $HOME &\n\nSince gnome is not running, the themes won't work so you'll see the application running in simple gtk (ugly but functional).\nRemember to add & at the end so it returns to prompt in case you want to start other applications.\nAlso, if you install evilwm\nsudo aptitude install evilwm\n\nand run it fromt that xterm, also with the &, it will allow you to move the windows with Alt+click\nevilwm &\nnautilus &\nwhatever_program &\n\n\nA: If you start with a clean minimal installation, install openbox, then run startx on startup. After this, you just need to right click the desktop to access the Openbox menu which should allow you to launch a xterm or any installed applications.\nOpenbox is very light and has little dependencies.\n\nA: I asked this question over at unix.SE, and got the following answer:\nIf you build the VM and use it as a server, then ssh with x11forwarding (e.g. ssh -X), then the system does not need a desktop or window manager, although the host will.\n\nA: why you don't install gnome it is easier !!!\n\nOr if you still want xfce :\nhttp://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/01/install-xfce-4-8-in-ubuntu-10-10-ppa/\n", "Q: Why removing the xfce4 package doesn't remove the XFCE desktop environment? I wanted a window manager, so I installed xfce4. I used \nsudo apt-get install xfce4\n\nto do this. To remove it, I used\nsudo apt-get remove --purge xfce4  \n\nwhich didn't work, and neither did\nsudo dpkg purge xfce4\n\nas evidenced 1) startx launches the xfce desktop, and 2) apt-cache search xfce4 returns a long list of installed packages.\nSo, how can I get rid of xfce4 and it's dependencies?\n\nA: Note that apt-cache is not showing you installed packages, but rather those which are known about.\nTo test what you have installed, you might like to use:\ndpkg --get-selections | grep xfce\n\nBe sure to look at the second output column to see whether it's installed or deinstalled.\nAfter purging all xfce packages, the above command returns no output on my machine.\n\nA: Aptitude can do this by using package search ~n and using -P to prompt when adding or removing packages. \nsudo aptitude -P remove ~nxfce4\n\nSubstitute remove with purge if you would like to remove the system configuration files:\nsudo aptitude -P purge ~nxfce4\n\nTo remove user config files (use -r with care - recursive delete!!):\nsudo rm -r ~/.config/xfce4\n\n\nA: xfce4 itself is a meta-package that will install a default configured xfce desktop environment.\nIn most cases the base files that comes with xfce4 are: xfconf, xfce4-utils, xfwm4, xfce4-session, thunar, xfdesktop4, exo-utils\nSo you can do\nsudo apt-get purge xfconf xfce4-utils xfwm4 xfce4-session thunar xfdesktop4 exo-utils xfce4-panel xfce4-terminal\n\nThen most of the package that were associated with these package become autoremovable so you can run\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nor, almost all xfce4 package depend upon libxfce4util-common. Just purge that one and you remove everything related to xfce \n\nA: sudo aptitude purge xfce4 desktop-base exo-utils gtk2-engines-xfce libexo-1-0 libexo-common libgarcon-1-0 libgarcon-common libthunarx-2-0 libtumbler-1-0 libxfce4ui-1-0 libxfce4util-bin libxfce4util-common libxfce4util4 libxfconf-0-2 orage tango-icon-theme thunar thunar-data thunar-volman tumbler tumbler-common xfce-keyboard-shortcuts xfce4 xfce4-appfinder xfce4-mixer xfce4-panel xfce4-session xfce4-settings xfce4-utils xfconf xfdesktop4 xfdesktop4-data xfwm4 xfwm4-themes\n\nWill remove everything related with xfce4 in your computer. You will need to install aptitude first if you haven't:\nsudo apt-get install aptitude\n\n\nA: I think you should try aptitude.   \nInstall it: sudo apt-get install aptitude \nMaybe you will have first to install again xfce4: sudo aptitude install xfce4 \nNow purge it: sudo aptitude purge xfce4 \n\nps.: I've never installed xfce4 but the command apt-cache search xfce4 also gives me this output.\n\nA: Try this:\nType 'sudo apt-get remove --purge xfce4. Yes,  you've akready done this,  but a few extra seconds involved  won't hurt...  much. \nThen type 'find xfce4' (as rarely, if ever, everything IS actually removed)\nThen manually delete anything found. \nThen type 'sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get autoremove, this, in most cases removes any no longer needed dependencies.\nFor some reason Ubuntu expecting that you will at some future point reinstall a program, it leaves behind some of the configuration files, which in many cases causes problems later. \nThis is the quickest way that I know of, there are indubitably better ways available,  but this method works for me,  which, is all that matters. \n", "Q: How to establish wireless connection from command line?

So this is the first version of Ubuntu that stops the sound from coming out of my speakers when I plug in headphones. Unfortunately it also stops the sound altogether... I would like to submit a bug report but I can't remember how, nor what program I should submit it for?\n\nA: This question should have all the information you need about issues with alpha and beta releases.\nIn particular, this link covers how to report bugs.\nAs for what package you should file the bug report under, try to narrow it down as much as possible. If it only happens for specific programs, there's probably a common link between them.

It is almost like a beveling of the global menu bar. It seems common when using Chrome, but it also occurs when I am using other programs, such as nautilus. I find it quite annoying. Is there anything I can do?\n\n\nA: If you are referring to the blue thing, it is a part of Unity in 11.04, and I don't think you can disable it (at least I don't remember being able to; I'm on 11.10 now). It only appears when an application requires your attention.\n\nA: When you're saying \"gap\", do you mean that blue triangular marker in the upper left corner? \nIt's actually not a gap, it's an indicator that one of the windows in the launcher requires your attention (the same thing is indicated by a blinking/pulsating icon or button in other window managers - since the Unity launcher is hidden most of the time, just pulsating the icon would make ne sense)\nI guess it may look like a \"gap\" if your wallpaper is of a similar blue color... but it is not.\n", "Q: Are there any GUI equivalents of \"Initctl\"?

I would really need some guide how to fix these problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can't hear any sound after plug-in earphone.\n\n*I can't adjust the screen brightness.\n\n\nThank you.\n\nA: I too have the Acer Aspire 4750G, however I use Linux Mint 11, though it is based on Ubuntu 11.04. I too also can't adjust brightness, however I was able to fix the plug-in earphones to work, or the headphone jack. The way I was able to fix it was that in the BIOS, I changed the graphics card from switchable to integrated, and all of a sudden the headphone jack started working. But if you want to play games in Windows, you have to switch the graphics card from integrated to switchable. I'm not sure why changing the graphics card settings affected the headphone jack. If sound doesn't work when you changed it, go to sound preferences and in hardware make sure Analogue Stereo Duplex is selected and in output select Analogue Speakers.\nI'm not sure why changing graphic card settings fixed my headphone jack, but it might be because the Intel chip controls the headphone jack and when you use switchable, and since nVidia Optimus is not supported officially in Linux, that some aspects of the Intel chip like sound cannot be used. Hope this fixes it!.\n\nA: You may want to try the following and see if it will fix the brightness control after a reboot:\nSudo edit the file etc/X11/xorg.conf and add the line Option \"RegistryDwords\" \"EnableBrightnessControl=1\" to the Screen section.\nE.g.\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n    Device         \"Device0\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"RegistryDwords\" \"EnableBrightnessControl=1\"\n    Option         \"NoLogo\" \"True\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection \nEndSection\n\n", "Q: Can't play 1080p/Blueray films without lag Most of the films I watch on my PC are in HD, those of 20GB or more, even between 50-72GB.

This caused a lot of problems and I spent hours troubleshooting. I then tried removing the driver by unchecking the driver in Additional Drivers and now everything works fine.\nObviously Ubuntu recommends the STA driver but the other driver seems to work much better. All documentation I find about Ubuntu and BCM4313 also suggests the STA driver. \nWhy is the STA driver recommended? \nWhat is the advantage of using that driver? \nWill it cause problems when not using the STA driver?\n\nA: I think the recommendation of using the STA driver is because the open source driver brcm80211 is still considered unstable. It is in the 'staging' area of the kernel.\nFor example, my machine (which also has a BCM4313) freezes if I toggle the hardware switch. (this has been fixed in the Oneiric kernel.) The open source driver does give a more stable connection than the STA driver, though, especially with WPA/Enterprise connections.\nMy recommendation is to use the open source driver. It works better for me, and from your question I gather that it works better for you as well. And it is open source, too.\n\nA: With brcmsmac driver your wifi should work fine but it only supports managed and monitor mode. There is no support for ad-hoc, access point and bridges yet. So a better option is use a \"wl0\" driver which supports managed and ad-hoc modes plus bridges and works much better. Procedure for installation:\n1-sudo apt-get install bcmwl-kernel-source\nor you can install it from synaptic manager also, make sure broadcom-sta-common, broadcom-sta-source, firmware-b43* are NOT INSTALLED.\n2-Even if you install the wl0 driver it won't load automatically as it is blacklisted by default. So make sure \"/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-bcm43.conf\" file looks like this:\n# Warning: This file is autogenerated by bcmwl. All changes to this file will be lost.\nblacklist b43\nblacklist b43legacy\nblacklist ssb\n#blacklist bcm43xx\n#blacklist brcm80211\nblacklist brcmsmac\nblacklist bcma\n3-If you wish you can copy above contents in your blacklist-bcm43.conf file.\n4-Hope this works, best of luck! and make sure you restart your pc.\n\nA: I have the same problem with my netbook. The thing is when you install sta drivers, the other alternatives become blacklisted so you won't have the choice to use the b43 (or bc43, don't remember exactly the name) driver.\nTry this:\ncat /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nYou'll see there which modules are blacklisted. If you see there something refering to the broadcom drivers, edit the file:\nMake a backup copy, for if you need to revert the changes:\nsudo cp /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf /etc/modprobe.blacklist.conf_backup\n\nOpen it:\nsudo vim /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nor if you feel more confortable with a gui:\ngksu gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nSearch the line than refer to the broadcom driver and coment it (adding # at the beginning) Save the changes and reboot. Now you should see a new option in additional drivers.\nIn case it doesn't work, just revert the changes by:\nsudo cp /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf_backup /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nYou should also try to reinstall the sta driver and see if it works better:\nsudo aptitude reinstall bcmwl-modaliases\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: skype: error while loading shared libraries: libXss.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory I am using ubuntu 11.10 64bit,\nskype was working however after running sudo apt-get autoremove skype is throwing\n\nskype: error while loading shared libraries: libXss.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: For later 64 bit Ubuntu versions\n$ locate libXss.so.1\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libXss.so.1\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libXss.so.1.0.0\n$ dpkg -S libXss.so.1\nlibxss1:amd64: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libXss.so.1.0.0\nlibxss1:amd64: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libXss.so.1\n\nSo you have to install a 32 bit version of libxss1 library file (ie,libxss1:i386) because there isn't a 64 bit version of skype. 32 bit Skype must need a 32 bit library file. So installing 32 bit version of libxss1 package will solves your problem.\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\nsudo apt-get install libxss1:i386\n\n\nA: Looks like you're missing a library file. The program apt-file can be used to find which package provides a certain file. (dpkg -S does this too, but does not work for packages which are not installed)\napt-file search libXss.so yields:\nia32-libs: /usr/lib32/libXss.so\nia32-libs: /usr/lib32/libXss.so.1\nia32-libs: /usr/lib32/libXss.so.1.0.0\nlibxss-dev: /usr/lib/libXss.so\nlibxss1: /usr/lib/libXss.so.1\nlibxss1: /usr/lib/libXss.so.1.0.0\nlibxss1-dbg: /usr/lib/debug/usr/lib/libXss.so.1.0.0\n\nYou need to install the libxss1 package for that library.

First when I decided to install kubuntu-desktop on the same machine as my standard ubuntu-desktop, I tried to integrate those two in a way that I use some of the same applications on either desktop. I failed doing that because of integration issues (I'm not talking about the look!). \nNow I like to try a different approach: I want to separate those two to the max. \nBut I find that either desktop seems to load a lot of programs that have no place nor function in the other one. E.g. Tracker starts alongside with the Strig/nepomuk stuff, Dropbox seems to load half of gnome into KDE and kwallet starts in gnome even when no application tries to access it. Gnome keyring on the other side starts with KDE for a good reason, but I can't set it up to use my login password as authentication without entering it again to start the keyring. \nWhat are the right settings to separate the two desktops to the maximum possible extent? \nWhere are the files controlling this?\nFor example I tried to use LightDM to have no gdm or kdm running but it seems to mess up some things like keyboard bindings ... \nIs there a tutorial out there that I couldn't find while googling? \nAny comprehensive information should help!\n\nA: Unfortunately, once the two Desktop Environments are on the same installation (using the same or different directories), there is no real way to separate them.\nThe only way to get them \"completely separated\" is to install them on two separate installations. I'm sorry that it is that way, but essentially that's what it boils down to.\n\nIn light of your comment, there is an option you can add to the .desktop files that prevents them from showing in specific environments.\nI believe this setting should be \"OnlyShowIn\" and the value would be KDE, GNOME, Unity, etc.\nIn KDE it is possible to set this manually for your startup applications (but only for KDE itself).\n\nA: I found a solution on this site\non /etc/xdg/autostart , there are:\n\n\n*\n\n*tracker-miner-flickr.desktop\n\n*tracker-miner-fs.desktop\n\n*tracker-store.desktop\n\n\nedit them with \nOnlyShowIn=GNOME;\n", "Q: How do I get rid of double battery monitor status? \nPossible Duplicate:\nTwo battery indicator symbols, how do I get rid of one? \n\nIt seems there is a bug that displays an extra battery monitor in Oneiric.

When you go into expo mode, any old notification-area icons show up on top of the wallpaper.

I am archiving a folder using following command:\ntar jcf \"home/username/forum/forum.tar.bz2\" /var/www/forum/\n\nThen I am extracting using :\ntar jxf forum.tar.bz2 ./\n\nIt extracts correctly, but creates /home/username/forum/var/www/forum folder. What do I need to do in order to extract it into /home/username/forum folder?\nThank you\n\nA: When creating the archive use -C /var/www/ to change the current directory to /var/www while creating the archive. \ntar jcf home/username/forum/forum.tar.bz2 -C /var/www/ forum\n\nThis will cause the 'forum' folder to be in the top level of the archive and will therefore extract directly into the current folder when you run:\ntar jxf forum.tar.bz2 ./\n\n\nA: In addition to dv3500ea's answer, you can use the next command to extract tarballs containing var/www/forum/ to forum/:\ntar xjf forum.tar.bz2 --strip-components=2\n\nvar/ and www/ are two path components, hence the 2 in --strip-components.\nIf you're not sure what's inside a tarball, use the t option:\ntar tjf forum.tar.bz2\n\nPipe it through less so you an use arrow keys for scrolling.\nA general note about the options used:\n\n\n*\n\n*x - extracts a tarball, I always place it as first option since it's most logical to see what a command does\n\n*c - creates a tarball\n\n*t - lists the contents of a tarball\n\n*j - make tar uncompress bzip2 compressed tarballs. This is redundant with the .bz2 extension, so you may remove this option as well\n\n*f - this option expects a filename as argument, it's either the tarball to be extracted (tar xf file.tar.bz2) or created (tar cf file.tar.bz2)\n\n\nA: The fast (and possibly wrong) solution would be to change your command to change directories before tarring.

Just call up the gkbd-keyboard-display app. You will need to pass it an argument of the layout name you want to view. For example for the standard US English layout:\ngkbd-keyboard-display -l us\n\nIf you don't know the name of your layout, you can use setxkbmap -query to find it. To view your current layout whategkbd-keyboard-display -l $(setxkbmap -query | sed -n '/^layout/ {s/.*: *//g;p}')ver it may be, try:\ngkbd-keyboard-display -l $(setxkbmap -query | sed -n '/^layout/ {s/.*: *//g;p}')\n\nThe app will show you the current layout including what you will get with modifier keys and show you what keys you are currently pressing. It does not act as an on-screen keyboard to enter keystrokes via the mouse, it only shows you info about the keyboard layout.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 20.04 > Settings > Regions & Language > Add input source.\nClick + to add any input source, then in the menu bar top right you have a menu for selecting input source and at the bottom of this menu is \"Show Keyboard Layout\".\nIt does not do exactly what you want because pressing a modifier does not change the appearance but it shows up to 4 possible characters for every key.  Pressing modifiers also allows to identify Control, Super, Meta, Alt, Menu.\n", "Q: How can I configure and print with an HP LaserJet 1000? Could anyone help me to configure printer?

Well does the multiarch feature of 11.10 mean 64bit users will be able to install 32bit '.debs' without resorting to the 'force--architecture' command? \n\nA: There is indeed no need for --force-architecture anymore with multi-arch support with a some notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*The libraries on which the package depend must support Multi-arch\n\n*Even if multi-arch is supported, it's possible for a library package to make the system install either the 32-bit version or the 64-bit one, but not both. So, the package in question should not have a need to depend on such a library unless there is no 64-bit equivalent necessary.\n\n*Many packages from third-party websites do not set the necessary dependencies. Before multi-arch, a dirty hack called ia32-libs was created. This would contain the 32-bit libraries for multiple packages, and therefore it was easy for the maintainer to say \"just install the ia32-libs package.\" In most cases, the dependencies are mentioned for the 32-bit sysems, so you should install those, but for the 32-bit architecture by adding :i386 after each package as in:\nsudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 libc6:i386\n\n", "Q: Why do I get a blank screen when booting from a CD or USB stick?

XFCE supports a hotkey to move a window to another workspace. \nIn fact this does two things: \n\n\n*\n\n*It moves the window to the new workspace.\n\n*switches to this workspace. \nI'm trying to disable this behaviour and make the hotkey only move the window without switching the workspace. Is this somehow possible, perhaps using hidden options?\n\nA: wmctrl lets you manipulate windows. You can bind keyboard shortcuts to the following commands:\nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -t 0  // Move active window to workspace 1\nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -t 1  // Move active window to workspace 2\nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -t 2  // Etc...\n\n\n\n*\n\n*wmctrl - man page\n\nA: It is also worth recording here that it is possible to do this with xdotool, which can be installed with\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\nYou can bind the command below to perhaps a spare button on the side of your mouse, and then you can click that button to flick the active window to another workspace.  The number of the workspace is specified at the end of the command.\nxdotool getactivewindow set_desktop_for_window 1\n\nThis will move the currently active window (the one that has focus) to the desired workspace, while keeping you on the workspace where the command was issued, which was just what you specifically required. (To actually move to that other workspace yourself, you would use xdotool set_desktop 1.) \nYou could also select a particular window to move instead of just the active window, but probably shifting the active window (whatever it is) would be most useful to bind to a key.\nNote: If you use a different window manager than that of the default on Xfce, or you use compiz, you may need to look at the viewport options in the xdotool manpage or try wmctrl instead. \nFor more detailed information on using xdotool for manipulating windows and workspaces, please see my answers here to related, but different questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*how to shift applications from workspace 1 to 2 using command\n\n*Is there a command to go a specific workspace?\nThere are so many things you can do with xdotool; please see the Ubuntu manpage or man xdotool.\n", "Q: Found an error in font in Ubuntu, where and how should I report it? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I report a bug? \n\nI am playing with Braille Unicode characters and I just realised that DejaVuSans Mono and FreeMono (and maybe other fonts too) show character:\n\n⡳ U+2873 BRAILLE PATTERN DOTS-12567\n\nas\n\n⡣ U+2863 BRAILLE PATTERN DOTS-1267\n\n(they both look the same in Character map, or if used in text)\nDot no 5 is missing.\nShould I report it somewhere?

Then\n\"METHOD 3 - CHROOT\nThis method of installation uses the chroot command to gain access to the broken system's files. Once the chroot command is issued, the LiveCD treats the broken system's / as its own. Commands run in a chroot environment will affect the broken systems filesystems and not those of the LiveCD.\n1) Boot to the LiveCD Desktop (Ubuntu 9.10 or later). Please note that the Live CD must be the same as the system you are fixing - either 32-bit or 64-bit (if not then the chroot will fail).\n2) Open a terminal (Applications > Accessories > Terminal).  \n3) Determine your normal system partition - (the switch is a lowercase \"L\")\n\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nIf you aren't sure, run  \ndf -Th  \n\nLook for the correct disk size and ext3 or ext4 format.  \n4) Mount your normal system partition:\nSubstitute the correct partition: sda1, sdb5, etc.  \nsudo mount /dev/sdXX /mnt  \n\nExample: sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt \n5) Only if you have a separate boot partition:\nsdYY is the /boot partition designation (for example sdb3)\nsudo mount /dev/sdYY /mnt/boot \n6)\nMount the critical virtual filesystems:\nsudo mount --bind /dev  /mnt/dev\nsudo mount --bind /dev/pts  /mnt/dev/pts\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nsudo mount --bind /sys  /mnt/sys \n7)\nChroot into your normal system device:\nsudo chroot /mnt \n8) If there is no /boot/grub/grub.cfg or it's not correct, create one using\nupdate-grub \n9)\nReinstall GRUB 2:\nSubstitute the correct device - sda, sdb, etc. Do not specify a partition number.\ngrub-install /dev/sdX \n10) Verify the install (use the correct device, for example sda.

I'm almost sure that you need them.\n\n\n*\n\n*The only way to stop your system from sending UDP packets is to not run any program that uses UDP. I have no idea how you can do this.\n\n\nThis being said, I must confess that, in my 45 year  career as a sysadmin on Unix and Linux with the last 20 years in security, I've NEVER encountered a situation where turning off UDP was a good idea. It seems like you're trying to secure your system by randomly turning things off, without understanding what you're doing, or how security works. Please don't.\n", "Q: while setting upstart in application giving error wht i have done is \nsudo emacs /etc/init/app.conf\n\nand then i write the code for my upstart \n# application Server\n\ndescription \"applicationServer\"\nauthor      \"Rahul Mehta <rahul23134654@gmail.com\"\n\nstart on (net-device-up\n    and local-filesystems\n    and runlevel [2345])\nstop on runlevel [016]\n\nexec /lily/bin/launch-hadoop\n\nwhen i try to save this file it says :\n/etc/init/: no such directory\n\nwhat should i need to do to solve this problem. \nUsing Ubuntu 8.04.\nOn Ubuntu 11.04 it is giving me this error \nstart: Job failed to start\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 8.04 includes an older version of Upstart that stored its configuration files in /etc/event.d.  So you should either put your configuration file in that directory, or upgrade to a more recent version of Ubuntu that stores Upstart configuration files in /etc/init.\n", "Q: sort the results from `apt-cache search ` Is there a way to sort the results from apt-cache search <keywords>?\n\nA: Pipe the result to sort:\napt-cache search keyword | sort\n\nThe vertical bar is called pipe. It takes the output from apt-cache and transfers it to the input of sort.\n\nA: You can pipe the output of apt-cache search to popsort.py (see footnotes) which sorts it in the increasing order of popularity and displays a popularity rank at the beginning.\nFor example, a typical apt-cache search run might look as\n$ apt-cache search sqlite browser             \nalice - Web browser (WebKit or Gecko) based IRC client\ngtkcookie - editor for cookie files\nhoteldruid - web-based property management system for hotels or B&Bs\nnova-consoleauth - OpenStack Compute - Console Authenticator\nruby-http-cookie - Ruby library to handle HTTP Cookies based on RFC 6265\nsqlitebrowser - GUI editor for SQLite databases\n\nIf the output is piped to popsort.py\n$ apt-cache search sqlite browser | popsort.py \n66341 hoteldruid - web-based property management system for hotels or B&Bs\n58787 nova-consoleauth - OpenStack Compute - Console Authenticator\n43444 alice - Web browser (WebKit or Gecko) based IRC client\n36506 gtkcookie - editor for cookie files\n8052 ruby-http-cookie - Ruby library to handle HTTP Cookies based on RFC 6265\n7114 sqlitebrowser - GUI editor for SQLite databases\n\nwhich shows that sqlitebrowser, ruby-http-cookie are popular by an order of magnitude compared to others.\nFootnotes\n\n\n*\n\n*popsort.py is a python script I wrote.

From the man page: \nkill - send a signal to a process\nThe default signal sent by kill [pid] is SIGTERM which usually but not necessarily asks the process to terminate. It's quite possible to write a program that plays a happy tune when you send the SIGTERM signal to it, but not recommended.\nAnother common signal is SIGHUP which is often used to ask a program to reread its configuration files.\nIf you really want to kill a program you need to use the SIGKILL signal by doing kill -9 [pid].\n\nA: If kill is invoked without any parameter, it sends the signal number 15 (SIGTERM). This signal can be ignored by the process. This signal notifies the process to clean his things up and then end correctly by himself. That's the nice way.\nYou can also \"send\" the signal number 9 (SIGKILL) that cannot be ignored by the process. The process will even not recognize it, because the kernel ends the process, not the process itself. That's the evil way.\nOne says kill -9 <pid> always works. That's a misbelief. There are situations where even kill -9 does not kill the process. For example when a process has the state D (uninterruptable sleep). A process comes into this state everytime it waits for I/O (normally not very long). So, if a process waits for I/O (on a defect harddisk for example) and it is not programmed properly (with a timeout), then you simply cannot kill the process. No matter what you do. You just can try to make the file accessible that the process continues.\n\nA: Processes can ignore some signals. If you send SIGKILL it will not be able to ignore it (and neither catch it to do cleanups). Try:\nkill -9 {PID}\n\nLearn more by reading the manual page:\nman kill\n\n\nA: It sounds like you might be suspending a process (perhaps by pressing Ctrl-Z in the terminal).  In this state, your process will not respond to a SIGTERM as it is frozen.  Running 'fg' thaws the process, so it can pick up the signal and self-terminate. That could explain why 'fg' appears to update the process list.\n\nA: This is what i used to pill localhost running on port 80 (By angular cli)\nGet running app info on port 80\nsudo lsof -i tcp:80\n\nAfter That \nsudo kill -9 3348\n\nwhere 3348 is pid of the running process \n\nA: From within C++, I executed:\nkill(4024, SIGKILL);\n\nAnd on a linux(Ubuntu) terminal,\n$ ps -ax | grep my_su\n\nThe output was:\n4024 pts/1    Z+     0:00 [my_subscriber] <defunct>\n\nSeemingly, it (4024) still surviving. However, as soon as I terminated the parent process which called the above \"kill\" statement, 4024 didn't appear any more. Now I judge \"defunct\" process is nothing more than a line displayed and decided to ignore it. I hope my experience could help someone out there. Cheers!\n\nA: You also may use kill -l to display the supported signals by your architecture, and learn more about the signal you may wish to use to properly send a signal.\nNote: as others may have mentioned, the use of kill -9 {PID} is not recommended unless its a zombie process. once a process receives a SIGKILL will shutdown immediately without cleaning or any other proper procedures.\n\nA: If you trying to kill a process with PID and it still runs on another PID, it looks like you have started that process in a different account most probably root accout. so Login in with sudo su and kill it\n", "Q: Starting tomcat6 shows missing conf directory. I've just installed Tomcat6 via apt-get on lucid. \nLooking at the directory created here:    /usr/share/tomcat6\nI was expecting a conf directory to be created under this (based on experiences elsewhere).  Instead there was a skel directory created. Under this there was the directories bin and conf. \nDo I need to patch up the installation by creating a hard link of a conf directory inside tomcat6 that points to .../tomcat6/skel/conf - or is there something better?\nPS - Why do I need to to this? Why doesn't it work out the box?\n\nA: /usr/share generally contains read-only data. You're likely looking for the /var/lib/tomcat6/ directory which contains both the conf and logs directories.\nskel is the abbreviation of \"skeleton\" which means it should be copied somewhere.\nAccording to the Ubuntu manual on tomcat, you should create an instance with:\ntomcat6-create-instance tomcat-instance\n\nThis will create a directory named \"tomcat-instance\" containing some subdirectories like conf. To start it, run:\ntomcat-instance/bin/startup.sh\n\nFor more information and other links, please refer to the Ubuntu manual.\n", "Q: Clementine keyboard shortcuts not working Does anyone else encounter problem with Clementine's keyboard shortcuts not working ?\nI have them assigned to \n\nbut they do not work.

This solved my problem.\n\nA: Disabling Gnome's shortcut keys only works, if the shortcuts you want to use are not define by the Gnome shortcut system, because clementine cannot fetch the shortcuts. \nTherefore we have to deactivate the gnome shortcuts and go to gnome-control-center keyboard to the tab Shortcuts. There deactivate the shortcuts in Sound and Media which you like to control with Clementine. For instance I disable Play (or play/pause), Stop playback, Previous track and Next track. You can deactivate a shortcut by clicking on it and the if there is written New shortcut... press backspace. \nThen start clementine, go to tools, preferences to the tab Global Shortcuts. Uncheck the box Use Gnome's shortcut keys. And assigne the shortcuts you want to use to control clementine.\n\nA: Open up System Settings, select Keyboard.  Go to the Shortcuts tab, click Sound and Media in the left column.  For Play (or play/pause), click on Audio Play to change the hotkey.  \nI changed it to Ctrl + AudioPlay for example, anything un-useful just to be out of the way.\nNow (as previously stated) in Clementine, go under Tools -> Preferences -> Global Shortcuts and uncheck Use Gnome's shortcut keys.

How can I create the equivalent of this directory link?\n\nA: From the manual page of ln:\n\n-d, -F, --directory\n  allow the superuser to attempt to hard link directories (note: will probably fail due to system restrictions, even for  the  superuser)\n\nAn application cannot see whether a hard link is a hard link or the original file path.

If I want my application to store a few settings, that persist when an application closes, then where should I store them?\nI'm not talking anything complicated: two booleans and a string (although in the future I might want to store more complex settings)\nI've heard gconf, dconf, gsettings, etc all mentioned. What is the \"preferred\" method? Preferably one that's nice and easy in Python.\n\nA: gconf is deprecated, so for a new project I would not use it. dconf is a backend for storing the settings, as an application developer you should normally not have to bother with it.\nWhat you seem to need is gsettings, a high-level API (API documentation for C) to store/retrieve settings without bothering how/where they are actually stored. gsettings is part of gio, which is one of the core packages of gnome (like glib and gobject). This blog post gives a short introduction how to use it with Python.\nIf you do not want any dependencies on gio (e.g. you are not developing a GNOME application) and want to store simple config files, I'd suggest to use the $HOME/.config directory (or whatever directory defined by $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS) instead of $HOME/.your_appname, in line with the freedesktop spec.\n\nA: Application runs system wide\nthe appropriate place to store settings would be:\n/etc/[application]/\n\nwhere a subdirectory is optional.\n\nApplication runs in a per user mode\nsettings should be stored in the user HOME, preferably in a hidden directory:\n/home/<user>/<.application>/\n\nSee also the Debian FHS.\n\nApplications running in X-Desktop\nApplications for the X-Desktop (e.g. GNOME, KDE, Unity, Xfce) should refer to the XDG Base Directory Specification where the following file locations are defined in local variables:\n\n\n*\n\n*$XDG_DATA_HOME defines the base directory relative to which user specific data files should be stored. If $XDG_DATA_HOME is either not set or empty, a default equal to $HOME/.local/share should be used.\n\n\n*$XDG_CONFIG_HOME defines the base directory relative to which user specific configuration files should be stored. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is either not set or empty, a default equal to $HOME/.config should be used.\n\n\n*$XDG_DATA_DIRS defines the preference-ordered set of base directories to search for data files in addition to the $XDG_DATA_HOME base directory. The directories in $XDG_DATA_DIRS should be seperated with a colon ':'.\n\n\n*If $XDG_DATA_DIRS is either not set or empty, a value equal to /usr/local/share/:/usr/share/ should be used.\n\n\n*$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS defines the preference-ordered set of base directories to search for configuration files in addition to the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME base directory. The directories in $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS should be seperated with a colon ':'. If $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS is either not set or empty, a value equal to /etc/xdg should be used.\n\n\nA: Quickly, which is is one of the newer helpers for application development for Ubuntu, defaults to storing all preferences with desktopcouch. \nThe advantage is that those settings can be synchronized with other installations via the Ubuntu One tools. \n", "Q: The installer needs to commit changes to partition tables, but cannot do so because partitions could not be unmounted. /cdrom I have tried several times to install Natty on its own partition on my laptop (WinXP, Intel x86) using UNetBootin, but it always fail. \nThere is a dialog box:\nFailed to unmount partitions\n\nThe installer needs to commit changes to partition tables,\nbut cannot do so because partitions on the following could\nnot be unmounted.\n\n/cdrom\n\nPlease close any applications using these mount points.\n\nWould you like the installer to try to unmount these partitions again?\n\nIf I click on \"continue\" Ubiquity will hang up, that is, the slideshow will play forever.

The service can be started and stopped using:\nsudo /etc/init.d/tomcat6 start\nsudo /etc/init.d/tomcat6 stop\n\nYou can verify if the service is running by viewing http://localhost:8080/, either using a browser or from the command line:\ncurl http://localhost:8080/\n\nIf this is not working out of the box for you then something is either odd about how your machine is set up, or about how you are trying to run the Tomcat service.\nIf you are trying to run Tomcat in any way other than using the /etc/init.d/tomcat6 script, you are likely to run into complications. There are two environmental variables that define where the Tomcat distribution and files are located; CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE.

If you are trying to run Tomcat on a development machine (eg, from an IDE such as Eclipise), then you will find that the way the package installs Tomcat is unsuitable, and you should instead be installing a private instance either using the instructions in the server manual or by downloading it directly from the Tomcat website and extracting it manually.\n", "Q: Do I need to act on \"Tomcat6 APR based Apache Tomcat Native library not found\"?

I installed tomcat6 on lucid using apt-get. All working.\nI installed tomcat-admin. Not working. \nI amended the /etc/tomcat6/tomcat-users.xml file to uncomment the users and roles (from the default) to be like the following:\n<role rolename=\"tomcat\"/>\n<role rolename=\"role1\"/>\n<user username=\"tomcat\" password=\"password\" roles=\"tomcat\"/>\n<user username=\"both\" password=\"password\" roles=\"tomcat,role1\"/>\n<user username=\"role1\" password=\"password\" roles=\"role1\"/>\n\nThis still didn't work. \nThen from the following page I added. \n<role rolename=\"manager\"/>\n<user username=\"admin\" password=\"secret\" roles=\"manager\"/>\n\nthen it worked. \nWhy doesn't this occur as part of the install? (Why isn't this in the Ubuntu Manual on Tomcat ?)\n\nA: Ansered in the comments.\n\nThe Ubuntu Manual has: \"Access to the manager application is protected by default: you need to define a user with the role \"manager\" in /etc/tomcat6/tomcat-users.xml before you can access it.\" I stumbled upon this myself several times, i thing many people are missing it... \n\n", "Q: Bash history search, partial + up-arrow I have searched, but not found anything on this. I am looking for a functionality in bash, using a terminal.\nWay back when, I had a user on a debian system, and a friend set me up with a convenient history search feature (I believe I used tcsh then), where I would type the beginning of a previous command, hit up-arrow, and it would do a search, based on the partial string.\nE.g. if my history is:\n./script.pl\n./script.pl arg1\ncat output\ncat output | grep yada\n\nAnd I type ., and press up-arrow, it would show me: ./script.pl arg1. Press it again and it would show ./script.pl, etc.\nVery much like it would perform a grep on .bash_history. Is there a way to get this functionality?\n\nA: To complete lesmana's answer regarding ~/.inputrc that I should create under my Trusty 14.04, verify/add in ~/.bashrc (the first line already exists in my ~/.bashrc):\nshopt -s histappend  \nPROMPT_COMMAND='history -a'  \n\nIt's already explained in French here.\n\nA: The following solution combines & extends some of the above mentioned approaches:\nadd the following lines to your ~/.bash_aliases file (no need for ~/.inputrc) in order to achieve the following behavior:\n\n\n*\n\n*move up/down in history (only entries with same prefix) by pressing CTRL+UP and CTRL+DOWN. This can co-exist to the standard functionality of moving up/down in the full history via UP and DOWN alone\n\n*jump to next/previous word in a commandline by pressing CTRL+RIGHT and CTRL+LEFT\n\n\nbind '\"\\e[1;5A\":history-search-backward'\nbind '\"\\e[1;5B\":history-search-forward'\nbind '\"\\e[1;5C\":forward-word'\nbind '\"\\e[1;5D\":backward-word'\n\nRe-login to the shell (or run source ./bash_aliases) in order to apply the changes.\n\nA: Create a file named setup_readline.sh with mode 644 in /etc/profile.d/ with following content, login and check you preferred keys:\nbind '\"\\e[A\": history-search-backward'\nbind '\"\\e[B\": history-search-forward'\n\nI think is the best way to do this. Mostly if you using configuration management systems  such as chef, puppet, etc\nAnd system config still untouched!\n\nA: Perhaps you may want to try https://github.com/dvorka/hstr which provides simple and multi-line simple filtering of Bash history which as based on a metrics (when, how often and length of commands matters) - you can use arrow keys to easily navigate the history:\n\nIt can be easily bound to Ctrl-r and/or Ctrl-s\n\nA: There is an alternative similar to what @lesmana mentioned above, but you do not have to create a new .inputrc file.\nInstead, if you have sudo permissions, you can enable this in the /etc/inputrc file. In this file are various keyboard settings including the history search feature (for 18.04 at least). The excerpt from /etc/inputrc is:\n# alternate mappings for \"page up\" and \"page down\" to search the history\n# \"\\e[5~\": history-search-backward\n# \"\\e[6~\": history-search-forward\n\nUncomment the bottom two lines using a sudo file editor (e.g., $ sudo vim), and a new terminal session will have the history search feature (for all users). This way, you do not have to worry about creating a ~/.inputrc file, nor will you have to add an $include statement as @Tulio Casagrande mentioned in the comments to preserve your ctrl-arrow inputs.\n\nA: Create ~/.inputrc and add these lines:\n# Respect default shortcuts.\n$include /etc/inputrc\n\n## arrow up\n\"\\e[A\":history-search-backward\n## arrow down\n\"\\e[B\":history-search-forward\n\n\nTIP: Read at the bottom for an explanation of $include /etc/inputrc or what to do if you already have the file ~/.inputrc.\n\nLines starting with # are comments.\nI can't remember what is backward and what forward. Experiment with it. Maybe you have to switch backward and forward.\nClose and re-open all terminals for the new behaviour to become effective.\n\nA bit background information:\nBash is using readline to handle the prompt. ~/.inputrc is the configuration file for readline. Note that this will also take effect in other software using the readline library, for example IPython.\nRead the bash manual for more information about readline. There you can also find more history related readline commands.\nTo get the escape codes for the arrow keys you can do the following:\n\n*\n\n*Start cat in a terminal (just cat, no further arguments).\n\n*Type keys on keyboard, you will get things like ^[[A for up arrow and ^[[B for down arrow.\n\n*Replace ^[ with \\e.\n\nFor more information about ^[ and \\e see here: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/89817/380515\n\nAbout the line $include /etc/inputrc:\nReadline tries to read ~/.inputrc for configuration. If that file does not exists it will try to read /etc/inputrc. That means if ~/.inputrc exists it will not read /etc/inputrc.\nSome distros have prepared some config in /etc/inputrc. If you then create ~/.inputrc you will lose the prepared config. This may or may not be what you want. To still keep the prepared config in /etc/inputrc you can use the line $include /etc/inputrc in your ~/.inputrc.\nIf you already have the file ~/.inputrc that means you either already know what you are doing. Or you inherited if from the person who set up your system. Or you previously followed a different guide which told you to create the file and forgot about it. Either way you might want to check /etc/inputrc and decide if you want to keep it with the line $include /etc/inputrc.\n\nA: Ctrl + R will give you this sort of functionality. Start typing a partial command and it will come up with old ones which you can navigate with the up and down arrows.\nMore info here.\n", "Q: Where do the files that I download go?

I'm trying to set up my ubuntu system to use TOR globally, in all applications, but I can't seem to find any instructions for the newer releases, so everything I find it years out of date.

I see from this article\nthat I seem to be able to have a \"start menu\" in dockbarx? How can I do that? I think it will have a shutdown button in there already\n\nA: That's dockbarx running in the gnome-panel. The button is the gnomenu applet, not a part of dockbarx.\nThere is no real way to add a start menu to dockbarx but the start menu cardapio can be launched at the mouse cursor with the command \"cardapio show-near-mouse\". If you make a custom launcher with alacarte or whatever and drag it drag it to DockbarX you get a start menu. It will look a bit weird since DockbarX can't register when programs with no normal windows have started so the \"wait\" look will stay for 10 seconds after you'd clicked the button but it will work normally otherwise.\n", "Q: How well does the Dell Inspiron Duo work? I am thinking seriously to buy a dell inspiron duo tablet/pc, but as a ubuntu lover I don't know if it works well or which features will be lost.\nHas anyone worked with this tablet?? any suggestions??\nThanks :)\n\nA: It works, but make sure to test your system to make sure all the hardware works, and it doesn't have the Dell power loss issue before putting Ubuntu on it. If you don't, then Dell tech support's sock puppets in India will act like Ubuntu caused the problem and it'll take a lot of arguing to get them to even consider it being a hardware problem.\nYou'll know you've got the issue if it randomly switches off at the BIOS screen.\nThere's a thread in the Ubuntu forums about getting the touch screen working; it seems like the driver requires manual installation and a little (fairly simple) configuration. The only thing that doesn't seem to work at all is the accelerometer, which doesn't have a driver as of this writing.

However, this feature is only officially supported for Windows and Mac, or for 3rd-party clients for those operating systems. I would like to be able to use this feature with Ubuntu 11.04.\nI have already taken a look at this question, but had no luck with its answer...probably because it never asks me for my school password, and I can't find a way to input one.\nIf there's a way to do this using what's already installed by default, or from some other application, please let me know.\nUPDATE: When I try connecting through Nautilus, I get the following error message, regardless of whether I picked WebDAV (http) or Secure WebDAV (https):\n\nAnd just to reiterate, at no point does it ever ask for my password.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 14.04:\n1) Open Nautilus (File manager)\n2) Click on 'Connect to Server'\n3) As server address enter:\ndavs://<username>@<webdav_address>\n\nIt is important that webdav_address doesn't contain the protocol. So for example if your web url is: https://example.com/webdavand your username is alice, the corresponding address for the server will be:\ndavs://alice@example.com/webdav\n\n\nA: All of the server connections are handled in the same way in nautilus. You fill out the data for nautilus to connect to the remote server at which point it will be added as a bookmark to the bookmarked folders list.\nThe first time you try to connect to the server if it is password protected you will be asked to provide the password and you will be asked whether you want to save the password permanently, for the current session or forget immediately. Once the server has been mounted it can be browsed like any other folder on your system.\nHope this helps    \n\nA: In Nautilus (the file browser), select File > Connect to ... and select WebDAV. Enter the information you need, such as a host name, a directory, port and username. Check the box to create a bookmark, and you'll find it in your Files and Folder lense and in the left pane in Nautilus. \nYou'll be able to use your WebDAV share as if it were a local folder. \n\nA: Use directly the protocol webdav://\nOften you can use directly the protocol webdav:// in your file browser.\nNowadays under kubuntu, for example, it's enough to write in Dolphin instead of a local path the address required with the protocol webdab:// before.\nFor example,\nwebdav://192.168.1.10/remote.php/webdav/\n\nIt will prompt for username and password, then you will deal with it in a manner similar to a local path.\nNotes:\n\n*\n\n*Working on Kubuntu 18.04.2 LTS\n\n*Dolphin (currently Version 17.12.3)\n\n*A local instance of webdab under nextcloud accessible with an address similar to\n192.168.1.10/remote.php/webdav/\n\nA: This looks more like a windows name resolution problem... it cannot resolve the netbios name of the server.  It should work with te IP address however.\n-To mount a windows share on a DHCP network, it is convenient to be able to mount by netbios name... it's very easy:\n1) Edit your /etc/nsswitch.conf file with your preferred editor (gedit, kate, nano, vim, etc)... search through the file and look for the line that looks something like this:\nhosts:      files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4\n...and add \"wins\" to the end of the line so it looks something like this:\nhosts:      files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] wins dns mdns4\n2) Save the file.  Note: \"wins\" MUST come before \"dns\" if you are using the openDNS service.\n3) Now you'll need to install winbind\nCode:\nsudo apt-get install winbind\n4) Reboot, or restart your network.\n", "Q: How to remove the old gdm \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I make LightDM the default display manager? \n\nI have installed Ubuntu 11.10 beta and all of its changes are now working and let me testing them, but the only missing thing is the lightdm's new theme which doesn't work and insted I have the old gdm login screen.

I need to clean up my server from PHP 5.3 packages (there are plenty of them) in order to be able to compile PHP 5.2. What is the easiest/safest method to get rid of them all?\n\nA: First, you have to remove Apache and all of its dependencies with:\nsudo apt-get purge apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5 mysql-server libapache2-mod-auth-mysql php5-mysql phpmyadmin\n\nand then:\nsudo rm -rf /etc/apache2; rm -rf /etc/php5; rm -rf /var/lib/mysql; rm etc/mysql \n\nIf you have any issues with phpMyAdmin, try entering this into the Terminal:\ndpkg-reconfigure phpmyadmin\n\n\nA: You'll probably want to purge all the php* packages from your system.

You're then going to want to check each of these file paths, i.e.:\ncd /usr/local/include/php\nls\n\nAnd delete them as is appropriate. Be careful not to delete anything that's critical to another process you need to keep running, though, unless you want to have to reinstall that too.\nTo remove a directory, or file, we use the rm comment with the -rf flag, so given the above example, we'd type:\nsudo rm -rf /usr/local/include/php\n\n\nA: This method is not advised to be used without careful review.

Fortunately, I didn't type the -y option, because it chose about hundred of packages without php in their name.\nsudo apt-get purge `dpkg -l | grep php| awk '{print $2}' |tr \"\\n\" \" \"`\n\nHow it works:\nFirst, a list of packages is generated using this series of commands: dpkg -l | grep php| awk '{print $2}' |tr \"\\n\" \" \". \nHint: You can run this part of the command in your terminal to see what packages would get removed. You should get something like:\nlibapache2-mod-php5 php5 php5-cli php5-common php5-json\nFinally, when you run the full command, this list of packages gets passed to sudo apt-get purge, removing all of the packages.\nHint: If it feels safer to you, you could just as easily run them separately, and copy+paste the list of packages to remove like so: sudo apt-get purge libapache2-mod-php5 php5 php5-cli php5-common php5-json\n\nA: The regex the two people said is incorrect.\nInstead of using php.* or php* One should use ^php* \nThats the right answer.\nSo you would use: sudo apt-get purge \"^php*\" \nAlthough I dont recommend using this method cause its highly automated and I encourge you to use sudo apt list --installed | grep php to get the list of packages and use these package names that you got from above command in this command:  \nsudo apt-get purge PACKAGENAME_ONE PACKAGENAME_TWO\n\nA: apt list --installed 2>/dev/null | awk -F '/' '{print $1}' | grep '^php' | xargs -r sudo apt purge;\nsudo rm -rfv /etc/php/5.3;\n\nExplanation\napt list --installed 2>/dev/null - list of installed packages with version and other info;\napt list --installed 2>/dev/null | awk -F '/' '{print $1}' - list of installed package names only;\napt list --installed 2>/dev/null | awk -F '/' '{print $1}' | grep '^php' - list of installed package names only starting in php;\napt list --installed | awk -F '/' '{print $1}' | grep '^php' | xargs -r sudo apt purge- pass list of installed package names only starting in php as arguments for sudo apt purgecommand;\nsudo rm -rfv /etc/php/5.3 - remove all configuration files for php5.3;\nIf necessary\nsudo rm -rfv /etc/php/5* - remove all configuration files of all php5 versions (php5.3, php5.4, php5.5 etc.);\nsudo rm -rfv /etc/php - remove all configuration files of all php versions (php5, php7 etc.);\n\nA: I use sudo apt remove php8.0*\nIt removes php and all related packages - for the given version - and downgrades the system to any other existing, installed (older) php version.\n\nA: First I run sudo apt list --installed | grep php to show all installed PHP versions then I removed the mentioned specific PHP version (8.1) with all related dependences (extensions) by run sudo apt-get purge 'php8.1*'\n", "Q: Making the \"Switch\" Windows to Ubuntu I am a information systems student in college and I'm just getting tired with the BS that goes along with windows and I'm planning to switch to Ubuntu.  Is there anything new users need to know right from the start?  Also I've tried googling for resources for new users but have came up with mostly Ubuntu vs other Distro links, so if anyone could provide links to some Linux/Ubuntu beginner tips it would be great.  Thanks in advance!\n\nA: *\n\n*Try booting a live session of Ubuntu on the computer you want to install it on. That way, you'll confirm that the hardware works as expected. If there is something you're worried about, check Hardware drivers in Ubuntu. Sometimes it's necessary to install proprietary drivers for wlan, for instance. You won't be able to do that in the live session, but you will be able to confirm that drivers are easily available. \n\n*Make sure you know what you want. It is useful to write down a list of everything you use the computer for.\n\n*Find out if there are anything you need to do that cannot be done in Ubuntu. If that's the case, then you'll want to keep a small partition with Windows on it. That's very easy in Ubuntus installer. \n\n*When Ubuntu is installed, most users will want to install the package Ubuntu Restricted Extras. When Ubuntu is installed, you can click this link to install it, or just search for it in Ubuntu Software Center: http://apt.ubuntu.com/p/ubuntu-restricted-extras.\n\n*Explore Deja-Dup, which is the default backup system in Ubuntu 11.10. It's easy to use, so use it actively. You'll find it in the system preferences, which is the first entry on the power menu in the upper right corner.\n\n*Explore the system, and please write down everything that isn't immediately obvious to you and if you can, explain why. New users have a fresh perspective that is very useful to developers. \n\n\nI think most users should be able to just use Ubuntu. A primary goal for you should be to explore Ubuntu Software Center, as that is a concept Windows users are not familiar with and where you'll find most of the software you'll ever need. \nI recommend using the Guest user as much as possible when you're experimenting with the system, as nothing you do as a guest can harm the system, and everything you do is forgotten when you log out or reboot. That means you can really go to town on the system and not worry about a thing.\nYou should also get yourself an account at http://one.ubuntu.com. You get 5GB of free online storage and you can sync with all your computers. You get databases and stuff too, and you get OAuth and OpenID so that you don't have to register with username and passwords on all those sites and just use \"login.ubuntu.com\". Very pleasant. \nI'm sure there are other things, but you'll have to discover them for yourself.\nGood luck and have fun! :)\n\nA: This seems to be a good intro in the way of videos go and if you can bare the Irish accent.\nhttp://www.linuxnewbieguide.org/content/video-tutorial-ubuntu-desktop-basics\n\nA: I have recently switched to Ubuntu and I have been using it for about 3 months now. I will share some of the things I think are good to do/know.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have enough time to install.\nAssume it takes 5 hours or so. Depending on the kind of install you're going to do, this may be the time you need. (If you're going to classic dual-boot, you will want to back-up your windows system.) The actual install will take much less time, but if you want to start tweaking your system right away it's nice to have some time to do it.\n\n*Take things slowly. Once you get confortable, don't be afraid to tinker, but back-up before trying new things.\nSeeing as you're an IS student, I assume you're somewhat comfortable with terminals etc. I recommend you attempt to stay on the beaten track for at least two or three weeks. Once you get comfortable with command line usage, you can start tweaking critical system parts, if desired, if you back up files you're changing beforehand. If things go wrong, you can use the recovery mode to restore the back-up file. If you're going to do large operations on critical parts of your machine, do a full system backup ( http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=35087 ). For example, I did this before installing bumblebee, which provides experimental support for hybrid graphical solutions. In general, I back up my system every two weeks or so.

I have an ethernet cable (not a crossover cable) to connect my laptop and my desktop ubuntu machines. I want to transfer large amounts of data. Is it possible with such a cable? I believe that between two Windows machines such a connection is possible (though I'm not totally sure).\n\nA: A direct connection between any two computers is perfectly possible with a cross cable hooked up to both of them and can be bought at any store that sells network cables. If one of the two computers is more modern, you don't even need such a cross cable and any network cable will do.\nHardware config:\nHave a look at this AskUbuntu Q&A how to set up a static IP address and set one computer to use 192.168.1.1/24 and the other to 192.168.1.2/24\nPlug this cable into the Ethernet ports of both computers.\nSoftware:\nThe easiest way to transfer files between computers is NitroShare as it doesn't need any infrastructure and is easy to install&use and is blindingly fast.  It also runs on everything: Ubuntu, Windows, ...\nTo install NitroShare, use the following steps:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:george-edison55/nitroshare-dev\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nitroshare\n\nA small icon now shows up in the menu bar:\n\n(do these steps on both computers)\nOn one computer, click the NitroShare icon and click \"Send Directory\" and (assuming you want to send your user's data) send Documents, Pictures, ... over one by one.\nWarning! Do not send the entire /home directory as that will copy your configuration files as well!\n\nA: Most Gigabit Ethernet (10/100/1000BaseT) adapters have auto MDI/MDIX function. Therefore, if you have it installed in one computer, you can connect it with other computer using a standard Ethernet cable - its a hardware issue not a software issue.\nMost modern PC's that have a gigabit ethernet port has this capability - just plug in both PC's - if they talk to each other then at least one computer has one of these ports.\nOlder PC's you will not be able to do this - you'll need a cross-over cable.\nHowever, its quite easy to create one from a straight cable if you dont want to purchase one specifically.\nA Crossover cable is an Ethernet cable (Cat 5, Cat 5e or Cat 6) that has pins 1, 2, 3, 6 on one end crossed to pins 3, 6, 1, 2 on the other end respectively. \nTherefore if you are handy with a wire-stripper you can cross-over the correct wires.\n\nA: In addition to the configuration in other answers (on setting IP addresses), I'd recommend Giver as a program to transfer stuff easily between two computers.\n\n\nA: I will install ssh-server on ubuntu machine, and winscp on windows. Both task are trivial, and then you can Total-commander-like copy files.\n\n\n*\n\n*install openssh-server on ubuntu box\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\n*install WinSCP (scp graphical client for windows)\n\n*copy files you need.\n\nA: Of course you can! Connect them with the cable, set IP addresses for each machine, for example 192.168.1.1 for your desktop and 192.168.1.2 for your notebook. Don't forget to disable/enable the connection after you set the addresses, as it may be necessary for them to become active.\nThen, on one of your machines, possibly the source of the data, right click the folder you want to share, go to \"Share\" and enable sharing. Samba is required for this and you will be asked whether you want to install it when enabling sharing, otherwise, if it's already installed, it will just work right away. Remember to set an easy sharing name, something short and without spaces.\nNow, go to the other machine, open nautilus (or any other file manager thereof) and go to location:\n\nsmb://192.168.1.2/folder/\n\nWhere:\n192.168.1.2 is the IP of the source machine where the folder is being shared.\nfolder is the folder name you set when enabling the sharing.\nIn nautilus, you can go to this location by clicking CTRL + L and writing it to the address bar.\n", "Q: How do I change the transparency level of gnome-terminal? I want to increase or decrease the transparency of gnome-terminal in Unity.\n\nA: Did you try in Terminal - Edit -> Preferences -> Profiles -> Edit -> Background ?\n\nA: On the other hand you can try CompizConfig. When you start it go to \"Accessibility\" and activate \"Brightness, Opacity and Saturation\" plugin. When you open it on Opacity tab you can set combination for mouse buttons or keyboard keys to change opacity of any active (focused) window. Default in my case was \"Alt\"+Scroll wheel.

It becomes more noticeable if I continuously scroll. Muting my laptop's speakers has no effect.\nIs this by design, or some strange quirk?\n\nA: This is likely interference from the CPU power supply traces.\nI particularly notice this in cases where there is a CPU governor that changes it's clock speed depending on load. The buzz you hear is actually the frequency at which the governor is changing CPU speed.\nI recall an old laptop where the sound was not just audible in the 'phones, it actually manifested as a buzzing noise from the motherboard. For a while it was possible to suppress it by disabling SpeedStep and running the CPU at full clock speed all of the time, but eventually it was near constant, and I had to get the motherboard replaced for fear of losing my sanity.\nThese days I notice interference in my 'phones when the CPU load changes dynamically - when loading games in particular (bursts of CPU activity as it processes resources, followed by pauses as it waits for buffers to fill from the disk). It's more obvious when the headphones are plugged into the front panel of my desktop than the rear, which reinforces the idea that it's electrical interference ; the traces for the front panel are closer to the CPU, possibly. I plug my phones into the rear sockets which seem to be better shielded.\nYou might find that you get some relief by enabling the \"spread spectrum\" controls in your BIOS - these controls adjust the timings of internal system clocks to make the square edged waves less harsh and are designed to generate less interference. As noted in the article, spread spectrum is often disabled in overclocked systems to help prevent clock skew, but these features are usually enabled by default. You probably won't find these settings on a laptop BIOS though.\nThe other technique I use for combating this is to reduce amplifier levels. The alsamixer terminal application is useful here for finding all the relevant levels, some of which can be hidden in the GUI mixers. Dropping them all out of the red zone to about 80% means that the initial interference is amplified less and becomes inaudible. This also makes listening to music on my Windows laptop bearable - reduce the master volume to about 30%, rather than the Wave volume, and the interference disappears. This also reduces clipping on some hardware.\n\nA: Not sure since the internal speakers should be turned off by default but if this is the sound made by the internal speaker of your system you can turn this off with several methods.\n\n\n*\n\n*with\nxset b off\nxset b 0 0 0\n\nxset is a user preference utility for X. The b option controls bell volume (1st 0), pitch (2nd 0) and duration (3rd 0) in milliseconds.  \n\n*You can also change this by editing ~/.inputrc (single user) or /etc/inputrc (global)\nset bell-style visible\n\nto change it to flashing and\nset bell-style none\n\nto turn system beeps off.\n\n*You can also blacklist the module \nsudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nand add \nblacklist pcspkr\n\nOn my system number 3 is already set as default so I would expect this to be so on your system too. This also seems to be the default method to turn system speaker off.\n\nA: I've encountered something similar on some of my older desktop PCs and, as far as I could tell, it had to do with devices being set up to share IRQs without actually being able to play well together.\nGiven that one of the systems made a clicking noise every time I rolled the scroll wheel while the system was under any kind of non-trivial load, they may be the same thing. (The problem tended to be some form of \"input from the keyboard/mouse causes clicking on the audio output\" when I encountered it on various PCs)\nIn my case, fixing the problem was as simple as toggling the \"Plug-and-Play OS\" setting in the BIOS. That changed which IRQ assignments were done by the BIOS and which by Linux and, in turn, altered IRQ assignments enough to resolve the conflict.\n", "Q: How can I move /var to another harddrive? I've put a new SSD as /dev/sda, the old HD as /dev/sdb.  And done a fresh installation as one partition on /dev/sda1.\nThe main quirk in my set-up is that I don't want to repartition the old HD, since it's got lots of data on it.  \nSince I had a swap partition on the HD before, I've put that into fstab.  I've also mounted the HD.  And /tmp (and /tmp/var) are in tmpfs.\nBut, how can I go about moving /var to the HD?  I can junk the old one (currently sitting under root at /dev/sdb5, and /mnt/hd).  \nDoing a simple ln -s /mnt/hd/var /var doesn't seem to work.  Is this something I need to do with mount -o bind?   I'm asking because the \"attempt, fail, recover\" cycle time is pretty long.\n\nA: The quick and easy way would be to edit your /etc/fstab file and add an entry similar to the one that you should see for the / partition and just put the necessary pointers such as the fs type, ext4 and point it to /dev/sdb5. Reboot and it should work. I would mount it to a temporary mount point and recursively copy or rsync it to that filesystem to ensure that you do not loose any data first.  \n", "Q: What are the hotkeys to find the next and previous occurrence of a search term in man and info?

What is the hotkey to get to the previous occurrence of \"n\"?\nAnd what are the hotkeys to get to the next and previous occurrences of a search term in info?\n# info mplayer\n\n\nA: For the man command, as you say, use /YOUR_SEARCH to find the first occurance of YOUR_SEARCH and then n to get to the next one.

Now I want to know how I can switch from Ubuntu to Windows 7 and from Windows 7 to Ubuntu without restarting the computer.\n\nA: I think that what you are looking for is some virtual machine if your intention was to use both the operating systems at the \"same\" time, because if you want to switch between them you will have to restart, unless there are some hack that actually works.\nSince when you start up your computer Bios looks for bootable parts of your harddrives, then grub/grub2 takes care of the rest.\nSo my solution is to install windows 7 as a virtual machine using Virtual Box, that's the software I use, and I have found it to work well for me, only thing that might be problematic is USB, if you use the open source one.\nVirtual Box\n\nA: I agree with Rinzwind. If you only need windows occasionally for few applications, installing Wine (Wine Is Not an Emulator) can be an option, to run these programs. \nThis can avoid the disruption of a reboot - how it compares to a VM-installation: I can't say, I guess it might be a bit faster. About stability and compatibility, you have to find out yourself.  \n\nA: This is not possible from a standard dual boot setup. You can put links on your desktop to reboot from one to another but a reboot is required. \nYou could do this with virtualization though using a hypervisor: Use a virtual machine manager (VM Ware or Xen) to install all the operating systems and you can then start both operating systems independent of each other. Here is a How to installing Ubuntu 11.04 with Xen 4.1\nVirtualbox is a program where you install a operating system inside another one (so that is not exactly what you are asking). This type of virtualization is called supervisor. Using this kind of virtualization is not independent of each other though: your guest system suffers a performance penalty since you need 1 to run the other.\n\nA: I agree with deepak, the only way to \"dual boot\" is with a VM, that is the only way. i reccommend Oracle VM VirtualBox, at www.virtualbox.org > Downloads.\n\nA: Provided your hardware is compatible, you could pretty much accomplish what you have in mind using XenClient 2 under which ALL of your operating systems would (once reinstalled) be running as virtual operating systems.\nNote that XenClient 2 is based on the Xen.  To run XenClient, your CPU must support VT-x or AMD-V.  Also, XenClient 2 is currently in a \"free to try\" phase of development.

Is it safe to upgrade? \n\nA: The ubuntu-desktop package is a meta package which means it doesn't actually do anything by itself, but only requests other packages by depending on them. When you install ubuntu-desktop, then it'll need to install all packages it depends on, or the meta package cannot be installed. If you remove ubuntu-desktop, however, only the meta package is removed, not the software it brought in. \nFor instance, if you have Ubuntu installed and you want to install Xubuntu, then you'll have to uninstall ubuntu-desktop first. That is because the notification systems are different. If you look closely, then you'll see that there is a conflict between libnotify-osd which is used in Ubuntu and xfce4-notifyd which is used in XFCE. Neither one is essential, so you can safely ignore the warning that ubuntu-desktop needs to be removed. \nI realize that you didn't ask for XFCE. But the point is that you need to know why ubuntu-desktop cannot be installed. It might be a very minor issue, in which case you can just ignore it. On the other hand, it might not. It's impossible to say without knowing. \n\nA: Ubuntu 11.10 beta 1 is safe to experiment with and test but definitely not safe to upgraded a working system to.

I had an Ubuntu install (8.04) which failed to upgrade on /dev/sda2. But now, I have three layers of boot managers stacked: \n\n\n*\n\n*old grub on MBR, gives me choice to WinXP or old Ubuntu\n\n*windows boot selector (don't know its official name), gives me choice between real XP and new ubuntu\n\n*new grub, list all the available systems.\n\n\nI would like to install a fresh Ubuntu on another partition (eg. overwriting the old install, I got dedicated partitions for /home and do not care about wiping out the old install), which is easy enough when you have a CD. Problem is I do not have a CD and I cannot convince my BIOS to boot from a USB device. \nI did a little search on this site and google, and asked the same question in french on ubuntufr, and this seems to be impossible. this question is close to what I am looking for but not quite, and I really find this limitation strange: I would think that it should be possible to install a complete system without repartitionning, then configure boot system to point to this new root. \nHere is a detailed description of the system's partitions (using script in this post, description is in the first post of the topic): post on ubuntu-fr\nThanks for your help,\nArnaud\n\nA: Indeed. I see no reason why you wouldn't be able to do that. It would be much easier if you listed your disks and partitions though. You've mentioned /dev/sda1 and 2, which is used for your Windows and Ubuntu roots. You mention a dedicated partition for /home and you do not mention swap. It would be nice to have a complete overview.\nBut not having a CD or a bootable USB is not necessarily a problem at all. For instance, you can use UNetBootin from http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/. It will \"install\" the CD image to your harddrive so that you can boot from it just like a CD or bootable USB (except it will be much faster, of course) and then you can install as normal. I believe that's what they call a \"frugal install\" since you don't have to throw away any CDs. This should be your preferred solution. \nHowever, if you're interested in the challenge, then it should also be possible to install it manually from the Wubi install. It is not a virtual system, so you will have access to the other partitions in your system. The only one you should not touch, is the Windows partition where your Wubi install resides. So, you should be able to mount the 8.04s root partition, delete everything and copy the root file system from your Wubi install onto that partition, fix things and reboot. I haven't tried this though and there are things you'll have to fix. For instance, Wubi installs have a /host mount point that points to the Windows file system containing the Wubi file system. This will no longer make sense in a real install. You'll also need to update the bootloader. There's probably lots of other small issues. But it should be possible. \nUsing UNetBootin is quite easy, so unless you're interested in the challenge for the sake of the challenge, that is what you should do. \nGood luck, and have fun :)\n", "Q: CA.pl file missing, how do I reinstall it?

As a workaround I kept installing applications from terminal which works fine. \nTherefore, my question is how to make Software Center recognize that I am connected to Internet?\n\nA: You can't ... yet.\nPlease file a bug for both these issues: it's definitely an issue to not be able to override what NetworkManager tells Software Center, and it's also an issue that NetworkManager can't handle your Mobile Broadband connection.\nAs a workaround, if you're not using one of your connections, you could add dummy entries to /etc/network/interfaces to trick NetworkManager into thinking you're online. The way to do this:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 manual\n\nIf you don't need to use your wired connection. Then reboot or restart NetworkManager. Of course this will break it for when you really need to use it :(\n\nA: The answer for this question, worked for me. The suggestion is to stop and start network-manager as follow:\nsudo stop network-manager\n\nand then\nsudo start network-manager\n\nThis fixes the issue with Ubuntu Software Center not detecting you Internet connection.\n\nA: Manually entering the connection settings solved my software center network detection problem.\nClick on the network icon in your taskbar, go to Edit connections, edit your connection and under IPv4 designate a Manual method, and then add IPv4 address, network mask and default gateway\nI understand this might not help mobile broadband users, but hey... worth a shot\n\nA: i have same problem  Install Boutton can be used and i have message  No network connection / ALL THIS PROBLEM  juste after using file for network connection beacause i have fixe my ip with on etc/Network/Interfaces ,  and after my software center can not detect any network .. \n\nSolution, if you don't need use Network-Manager , Remove It, and your software Center by default switch automatically to use  etc/Network/Interfaces   to connect to internet .\n", "Q: How do I uninstall all instances of Java and blacklist it from being installed again? For security reasons I want to remove/uninstall all instances of Java from my computer and prevent it from being installed again. On Windows computers I would simply just not install the software found at this webpage: http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp\nBut on Ubuntu I've noticed that Java seems to have gotten installed on my system without my explicitly doing it and it shows in several ways, e.g., through plugins, etc.\nWhat Java software on ubuntu is the equivalent of having installed the software at http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp on Windows? Will uninstalling one \"Java-named app\" uninstall everything Java related on my computer?\nHow do I blacklist Java so that it isn't installed again?\n\nA: Fistly, I also think totally banning Java is a bit paranoid :)\nSecondly, you can achieve what you want by removing Java packages from the system - this will also un-install all the programs which depend on it. Something like\nsudo apt-get remove java-common\n\nthen you'll need to make it non-installable, so it won't ever be installed as a dependency of another program (which will make the packages which depend on it non-inslallable too). My google-fu says that you can achieve this by editing /etc/apt/preferences and adding something like\nPackage: java-common\nPin: release a=fakerepo\nPin-Priority: 1001\n\nThe \"fakerepo\" thing makes apt to look for the package in a wrong place which prevents its installation.

Here is my story:\nOriginal system came with Windows 7, got openSUSE installed on the second hard drive, and dual boot for this setup worked fine.  Wanted to switch to Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11.04 dual boot so I did a Windows system recovery and it appeared to give me back a fresh Windows 7 install.  \nI then go to install Ubuntu 11.04 and the installer informs me I have multiple operating systems already installed.  I go to the advanced partitioning option and sure enough Windows 7 is on /sda while openSUSE is still on /sdb.  From here I followed this guide (How to dual-boot Linux and Ubuntu with two hard drives) after I had deleted all the openSUSE partitions on /sdb through the Allocate Drive Space tab of the installer.  I make the /boot, swap, /, and /home partitions and set the GRUB into the MBR of the second disk (/dev/sdb).  Everything installs fine. \nI reboot, Windows loads automatically, install EasyBCD and add an entry for Ubuntu into the Windows Boot Manager while assigning the type as GRUB2.  Reboot the system and it now shows dual booting options for both Windows and Ubuntu.  \nProblem is: while I can use Ubuntu fine when I try to boot into Windows it just gives me a black screen and after a little while the fans start running crazy.  If I restart the computer I will sometimes get the message that my system was put into hibernation mode because the temperature got too high (90C) which I presume is in accordance with the fans going crazy.

Over your first HD (sda) you have 2 different windows entry. One for \"SYSTEM\" and another for \"OS\". That might make a lots of difference for booting them. The thing is that it will be great to know if the win7 is at the \"SYSTEM\" or \"OS\".\nIf can still boot in ubuntu I recommend to try to fix your boot entries using this program called Grub-Customizer.

I installed Oneiric on a clean system, and found that the font tab is gone from the Appearance settings. This is a problem, because by default the text in Ubuntu is too large.\nI changed the text from normal to small in the Universal Access settings, but then it was way too small.\nI also tried it this way, but it doesn't appear to have any effect.\nHow can I get back the fine control and change my DPI from 96 to 90?\n\nA: Just open gconf-editor , navigate to the key /desktop/gnome/font_rendering/dpi and adjust to values you need.\n\n\nA: If the key text-scaling-factor is missing from gconf-editor, check alternatively:\n gsettings list-schemas | grep org.gnome.desktop.interface\n gsettings list-keys org.gnome.desktop.interface\n gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface text-scaling-factor\n gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface text-scaling-factor 0.9\n\n(replace 0.9 with the desired value).\n\nA: Gnome Tweak Tool\nThis is a common issue on the forums - the move to gnome3 has dumped many of the customisation features that were available in gnome2.\nOne GUI tool that exists in Software Center is gnome-tweak-tool - its a partial solution to allow you to customise some aspects of fonts.\nThe \"Text scaling factor\" is the option you are interested in - its unfortunate that it is a sliding bar so you will not be able to enter the actual DPI value.  Click on the sliding bar and use the left/right arrow keys to decrease/increase the font size.\n\ndconf-editor\nUsing dconf-editor which is available in the dconf-tools package allows you to set the \"Text Scaling Factor\" numerically i.e. changing the default value by fractions of numbers (1.2, 0.9 etc) changes the overall screen font size:\n\nUniversal Access\nIf you just want to adjust the text size universally without need detail you can do this from the universal access tool:\n\n\nA: Did you try setting DisplaySize in xorg.conf?\nI added to /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d a file with the size in mm, let's see how it works:\nSection \"Monitor\"\n  Identifier \"myMonitor\"\n  DisplaySize 223 125\nEndSection\n\n\nA: There is a new option Scale for menu and title bars in System Settings > Displays in Ubuntu 14.04 as described in this Ask Ubuntu answer, to set system-wide scaling factor.\n\nA: On Pop!_ OS (which also uses GNOME shell) I had to set scale to 200% for HiDPI to work.

If this worries you a lot, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*try installing some dock, such as Docky, AWN or CairoDock.

But Gnome panel is deprecated and will go away with 11.10 never to return. It's based on really ancient technologies that should've been put to sleep years ago. \nBoth Gnome Panel and Xfce4-Panel can be run with Unity, though, meaning that you can have both a Windows-type dock and the more intelligent Unity at the same time. :)\n", "Q: Anybody know how to get the eyedropper tool to work in the GIMP when running Ubuntu 11.04 in Virtual Machine from 7? Sorry this is so long. If you don't care why I need to run GIMP inside a virtual machine when I could just run it in Windows, or just want to take my word for it when I say that I have no other choice, you can scroll down to the section labeled \"The Problem\".\nIntroduction\nI might be the only person on the planet who relies on being able to use GIMP from an Ubuntu 11.04 install inside a Virtual Machine (OpenBox OSE) from Windows 7, but this is my situation. \nI work for a small company which has a shared computer for use by myself and several coworkers. Although I have a MAJOR project on the back-burner which sees the company switching over to Linux and implementing a more integrated system, Windows 7 is currently required for the business's use of Microsoft Access.\nMy coworkers wouldn't even know how to spell \"Linux\" and do all their work from Windows. I haven't really used Windows in about 4 years other than when using and maintaining the Access databases at work - all of my personal computers run Ubuntu and I'm much more efficient in that environment. \nI'm a heavy user of desktop spaces and really have trouble being constrained to the single workspace when running GIMP in 7, and have trouble remembering where to look for files (\"My Documents\" vs \"Home\"). For that reason (and because I'm testing other applications for future use by the business) I have Ubuntu 11.04 installed in VirtualBox OSE in which I spend a great deal of time during my shifts. The ability to minimize Ubuntu and return to the Windows environment is unfortunately required as I often need to make use of Access.\nI use GIMP to create various advertisements, logos, and other media for the business. I do this in addition to the same work my coworkers are doing so my time for such projects is extremely limited.\nThe Problem:\nWhen I run GIMP in Ubuntu 11.04 (untested with previous versions of Ubuntu) inside a virtual machine, it seems that the GIMP eyedropper tool thinks my entire screen covered by the default Natty wallpaper and when I use the tool all I get is purple. Fuzzy Select and other tools that require colour recognition do work properly, however.\nI think this is more to do with how Virtual Box OSE displays the desktop rather than an issue with GIMP itself. I've seen brief flashes of the Natty wallpaper (not the one in use, by the way), most predictably replacing drop down menus when RAM is low-ish (drop-down box is proper size but displays a piece of the wallpaper instead of the menu).\nHas anybody else noticed this and/or know of a way to fix it? It's really hard to match colours by just \"eying it\"! :P\nRunning Ubuntu 11.04 64bit (Unity DE) in VirutalBox OSE v4.0.12r72916 (latest), GIMP 2.6.11\n\nA: This is most likely an issue of the Guest Additions graphics driver, that may also depend on the graphics driver from the host. You may want to update Virtual Box to the latest release (at present 4.1.2) including updating Guest Additions.\nIf this bug is not yet fixed try running 10.04 with desktop effects (Compiz) set to \"off\".\nSide-note: graphics in virtual box will be much better integrated in 11.10 where you will also have the option to run Unity2D. However there are other issues that warrant waiting for the official release.\n", "Q: How to search the contents in a directory from terminal while you're in the middle of writing a command? I'm trying to become comfortable with the terminal by using it as much as I can.  The aspect of my computer usage where I lose most time using command line instead of the gui is when I try to find a song I am interested in.\nMy music folder is structured like so Music->Bands->Albums->Songs\nI often forget what Album a Song is in but I always remember what Band played that song.\nI don't search for the song from the Music directory because it takes too long to find a song (I have a lot of music) so I search for the song after I get to the Band directory.  Right now in command line I have\n# totem /home/user/Music/Red\\ Hot\\ Chili\\ Peppers/\n\nbut I forgot what Album the Song \"Dani California\" is in (totem is a music player in gnome.)  The quickest way for me to get around this is to get inside the Red Hot Chili Peppers folder in the file manager gui and hit  ctrl+f and type \"Dani California\".\nIs there a way I can search the contents in a directory from terminal while I'm in the middle of writing a command? Or do you have any recommendations on how I can most quickly achieve the same goal I do in the gui from the command line?\n\nA: This is not particularly intuitive as the auto-completion is not working, but you could achieve what you want using file masks:\ntotem /home/user/Music/Red\\ Hot\\ Chili\\ Peppers/*/Dani\\ Ca*\n\nAnother option is use find and then make it pass the filenames it has found to totem:\nfind . -name \"Dani Calif*\" -exec totem '{}' +\n\nThough this isn't exactly \"search while you're writing a command\"\n\nA: Hitting \"tab\" twice should give you a list of files or directories. Then just type part of the one you want and hit \"tab\" to complete it.\n\nA: Really interesting question.  That's a pretty neat way to force yourself to use the CLI.  But man, that sounds too painful for music.  I don't see how I could live with the limits of Totem (vs. Banshee or Rhythmbox).  I would think banning yourself from using Nautilus and gedit would go far enough to force you to use a terminal more often.\nBut I admire your patience and discipline.  Perhaps you might want to look into a CLI/Terminal oriented music player.  Here's a good review of some:\nhttp://www.linux.com/archive/feature/124907\nApologies in advance if none of them solve the particular problem you're asking about, but given the background of your question, I think you might find these options interesting nonetheless.  Best of luck.\n\nA: The already suggested solution of metachar is great, but sometimes it could not be enough.\nI use frequently more than a terminal at a time, multiplexing a single window using screen, but gnome-terminal's tabs could do the job as well (I should point out that the screen solution will work also in a ssh session or in a virtual terminal, so it is more general).\nSo, switching to another terminal, you can use the locate command whose results are obtained much more quickly than from find.\n\nA: It can also be done via Bash programmable completion. I've put together a small sample script.\nThe script below completes a fap (find and play) command which you should define separately, for example\nfap\n#! /bin/sh\nfile=\"$2\"\ntotem \"$file\" > /dev/null &\nexit 0\n\nThen put the following script into the /etc/bash_completion.d directory\n/etc/bash_completion.d/fap\n_fap()\n{\n    local cur prev dir i saveIFS\n\n    COMPREPLY=()\n    _get_comp_words_by_ref cur prev\n\n    saveIFS=$IFS\n    IFS=$'\\n'    \n    dir=\"$cur\"\n    if [ -z \"$cur\" ]; then\n        dir=\"/home/user/music\"\n    elif ! [ -d \"$cur\" ]; then\n        dir=\"`dirname \"$cur\"`\"\n    fi\n\n    local files=$(find `dequote \"$dir\"` -type f -iname \"*${prev}*\" -printf \"%p\\n\")\n    COMPREPLY=( $( compgen -W \"${files}\" -- $cur ) )\n\n    for ((i=0; i < ${#COMPREPLY[@]}; i++)); do\n        _quote_readline_by_ref ${COMPREPLY[i]} COMPREPLY[i]\n    done\n\n    IFS=$saveIFS\n\n    return 0\n} &&\ncomplete -F _fap -o nospace fap\n\nChange the dir=\"/home/user/music\" line accordingly (start folder for your music collection). Next source the script\n. /etc/bash_completion.d/fap\n\nNow you can use TAB completion like this\nfap frozen [TAB]\nfap frozen /home/user/music/MADONNA\\ -\\ RAY\\ OF\\ LIGHT/TRACKS/09\\ -\\ Madonna\\ -\\ Frozen.mp3\n\nor, if there are more options\n$ fap girl [TAB]\n$ fap girl /home/user/music/MADONNA\\ -\\ RAY\\ OF\\ LIGHT/TRACKS/[TAB][TAB]\n/home/user/music/MADONNA\\ -\\ RAY\\ OF\\ LIGHT/TRACKS/04\\ -\\ Madonna\\ -\\ Candy\\ Perfume\\ Girl.mp3\n/home/user/music/MADONNA\\ -\\ RAY\\ OF\\ LIGHT/TRACKS/13\\ -\\ Madonna\\ -\\ Mer\\ Girl.mp3\n$ fap girl /home/user/music/MADONNA\\ -\\ RAY\\ OF\\ LIGHT/TRACKS/0[TAB]\n$ fap girl /home/user/music/MADONNA\\ -\\ RAY\\ OF\\ LIGHT/TRACKS/04\\ -\\ Madonna\\ -\\ Candy\\ Perfume\\ Girl.mp3\n\n", "Q: How do I fix a download issue when updating? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I fix a 404 Error using a PPA? \n\nFor some reason every time I try to update by terminal, synaptic, and update manager I get this error message and I cannot update all the data I need.\nW:Failed to fetch cdrom://Ubuntu-Netbook 10.04 _Lucid Lynx_ - Release i386 (20100429.4)/dists/lucid/main/binary-i386/Packages  Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\n, W:Failed to fetch cdrom://Ubuntu-Netbook 10.04 _Lucid Lynx_ - Release i386 (20100429.4)/dists/lucid/restricted/binary-i386/Packages  Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs\n, W:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/canonical-dx-team/une/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found\n, W:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/canonical-dx-team/une/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n, W:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/lorenzo-carbonell/atareao/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found\n, W:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/lorenzo-carbonell/atareao/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n, W:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/meebey/ppa/ubuntu/dists/maverick/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n, W:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/team-xbmc/ppa/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found\n, W:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/team-xbmc/ppa/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n, W:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-desktop/gnome3-builds/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found\n, W:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-desktop/gnome3-builds/ubuntu/dists/natty/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found\n, E:Some index files failed to download.

First use xinput list to find your device id:\nuser@ubuntu:~$ xinput list\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Logitech USB Trackball                    id=10   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Wacom ISDv4 E3 Finger                     id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Wacom ISDv4 E3 Pen                        id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                id=15   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                     id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                                 id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                                 id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                              id=9    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ HP Webcam                                 id=13   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard              id=14   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ HP WMI hotkeys                            id=16   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\nSo in my case, the touch part has device id equal to 11. Next, you set the device enabled property use xinput set-prop, like this:\nuser@ubuntu:~$ xinput set-prop 11 \"Device Enabled\" \"0\"\n\nYou can enable it again with:\nuser@ubuntu:~$ xinput set-prop 11 \"Device Enabled\" \"1\"\n\nYou'll have to do this every time you restart your computer. Also, the device id may change between boots.\n\nA: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=9496609&postcount=1\nThere you'll find a script to disable/enable the touch AND a patch to fix the touch problem.\nWorked perfectly with mine.\n\nA: You can also use xsetwacom, which I think is a proxy for xinput, but for wacom/touch devices only.

You'll need a program to receive emails (that would be postfix) and a mail delivery agent to get the mails to your client via POP3 or IMAP. This could be dovecot - to use with postfix just use the dovecot-postfix package. The guide mentioned above explains what you have to do. \n\nA: Its actually pretty easy to enable sendmail to send mail out from localhost.  Its just a single change in the default sendmail.cnf  file , then start the sendmail service.  I do this all the time with cron scheduled jobs that send emails.

In Ubuntu Oneiric 11.10 it's possible to configure a Google Online Account. I'm able to configure this program to get access to Mail, Contacts, Calendar and Chat.\nBut which programs use this data? There is no information about that.\nAfter I configured my Google Account, I supposed that I will be able to use Google Chat with Empathy, or that I will be able to access my Contacts and Calendar in Thunderbird.\nBut none of this is true. So, how does Ubuntu use the configured Google Accounts?\n\nA: The idea is that those types of accounts should be configured in one place and then all other programs can get your identities. Your email clients, IM clients, VoIP, photo albums, etc. \nObviously, any tool must exist before applications can start to use it, so it's no surprise that many applications doesn't use this yet.

(It goes back spinning without me triggering anything)\nMy question is, what can I do to make my hard drive calmer?\n(It's a SATA 500GB 7200RPM) \n\nA: hdparm -B 127 should configure your drive for maximum power savings however if there is a flush to disk then it has no choice but to wake up. To counter this you can install powertop to profile programs that write to disk repeatedly. If it's workable, you might be able to reconfigure those programs to write to a tmpfs mount of your creation, or by using an existing tmpfs like /run is up to your discretion. You could also adjust the swapiness and vm caching attributes to tell Linux to hold onto more ram, thus flushing to disk less.

But as a programmer it is annoying to see those many errors every time you open a terminal.\nThe reason I found out is that when I installed a armeabi tool chain it created a folder called bin in the home directory and all the executables inside this directory are for arm processor. But my terminal when it is being opened it is trying to execute these arm binaries and hence it shows an error that these binaries cannot be executed (since my proc is not arm).\nTo solve this I can remove this folder (I tried it and it worked) but thats not the optimal solution. I want to know the script that is getting executed when I open a terminal where it is trying to execute wrong binaries at the launch.\nI had a look at ~/.bashrc but there is nothing relevant to my problem in that.\n\nA: As suggested by aquaherd, I would move the arm utils to a different directory so they are not in your path:\nmkdir ~/armdev/\nmv ~/bin ~/armdev/\n\nThen you will have to add ~/armdev/bin/ to the path of your arm development tools, but that shouldn't be too hard (and is probably a separate question where you should specify what tools you are using for the arm development).\n", "Q: Unity + HD 4250 = Not a good idea? I have been using 11.04 on my Compaq Presario CQ56-116SO. I have used Ubuntu from 9.10 version, and all have been working perfect, no lag etc. \nBut now, when the 11.04 was released, I installed it, I installed my ATI drivers (I play games like Urban Terror so i need those drivers) but oh my god! \nAll lags in 11.04! Well when I don't have any programs running it doesnt lag, but when I open apps like Nautilus, aMSN, etc., and they are open at the same time and when I move windows it lags like hell, and this will piss me. \nI never had lag with other versions! I even tried to use Classic Desktop, all lags there too, same bad peformance like in Unity. \nWhat is wrong with 11.04, why it lags with an HD 4250? In older versions all worked without lag, effects etc., no lag. But the 11.04 is a pain. \nAny fix for this? Disabling VSync and Detect fresh rate makes it run much better, but I still have huge lags. Hope the 11.10 fixes this. When I buy a new computer I'm gonna buy a computer with an NVIDA graphics card, my friend got an 8800GT and he don't have any lag in Unity. \nI even have tried 11.4 ATI drivers, no help.\n\nA: You seriously need to try the 11.10 drivers have a look here if you want to install them. They are really recommended!\nThey solve many many problems including lag on video play, desktop window dragging, etc.\nAs a general rule tough I really suggest you do not run a desktop environment with 3D effects while playing 3D games, specially if you are using wine. Unity2D is a very good choice for you, its fast, nice to look at and works flawless.\nI was using Unity2D until a few days ago with the 11.8 drivers cause of stability and use (no need for 11.9 if they worked the same). Installed 11.10 and the difference was humungous, went straight for Unity3D, effects: working, video play: working, necessary hacks and mods: none. Everything worked out of the box just perfect. At the moment I have to say 11.10 drivers are the best I have used till now.\nAbout the nVidia purchase, well do as you want ofc but since most of these issues are driver related and both ATI and nVidia seem to have problems anyways I would say its a waste of money. Specially because google is reporting that the future 11.12 drivers from ATI are \"even better then the 11.10 version\".\n\nA: Unity in 11.04 uses Compiz and doesn't work well with many Nvidia and ATI cards. That's probably not going to change with 11.10, but Unity2d, provided with 11.10, should work.\nA lot of users think that Natty's Unity is at the experimental level, and making it the default window manager was a mistake. :)\n\nA: Yes, there are some issues with AMDs proprietary drivers with Unity on 11.04. It has improved in 11.10 and the Unity 2D has also become a dashing ... shell. :)\nIn 11.04, what you'll want to do, is to deactivate Compiz. You can do that by choosing the \"No effects\" option when you login. \n", "Q: How to find full path of device I've connected? I have USB device, which is actually identified as serial device by Ubuntu 10.04. How can I find its full path?\nls -la /dev/\n\nshows a lot of devices.

I've tried fedora 15 with no luck (the Radeon not detected but always on and runs with max performance, introducing heat problems). \nI've tried the open source radeon driver, the proprietary driver, and in fedora, it just didn't work. Everytime I installed a radeon driver, I can't boot anymore (and have to uninstall it from terminal). The Intel video only works with VESA mode, and I can't get a decent performance with it. Even then, there's still the heat problem that basically make the laptop unusable for more than 15 minutes.\nSo now I'm looking for another distro. Does ubuntu support this configuration yet?

It works nicely, but VirtualBox guests (connected to the host with NAT) can't resolve work-related hostnames.  \nThe OpenVPN server pushes a \"dhcp-option DNS\" to the client, so the host CAN resolve those hostnames, but it looks like the guest cannot... Is this expected? Am I missing something?\n(Both host and guest are Xubuntu Lucid)\n\nA: Are you able to connect at all to any vpn-IP?\nFirst try to ping one of those IPs.\nIf that's successful and you're unable to ping a vpn-hostname then you are facing a DNS problem.\nWhat works for me is having the virtualbox network adapter set to Bridged and the interface set to the vpn (tap0 in my case).\nBy the way, since the mode is bridged, if you're having a network issue on the guest it's very likely you're also having it on the host.\n", "Q: Why is the latest version of Miro not in the repositories? \nPossible Duplicate:\nWhy isn't  Ubuntu using the latest versions of some applications? \n\nWhat's the reason that the available version of \"miro\" is only 3.5.1 in Ubuntu 11.10?\nThe latest version of miro is 4.0.3, and there is still a ppa available with the latest version.\nBut why isn't miro available in the official repository? \n\nA: That's just the way that the Ubuntu Packages work, for most applications they don't have the latest versions.

The error you have says that the Microsoft compatible DLL which has been recoded by Wine is missing a particular function.  It is likely that 1.3.x has this function coded in its version.\nCan I make two suggestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a valid Windows license - look for a DLL called \"msvcp80.dll\".  Copy that DLL probably to ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/system32.  Then use winecfg to override the inbuilt msvcp80 DLL\n\n*Alternatively, uninstall version wine 1.2 and install version 1.3.x from Software Center.  This usually is the latest development version of Wine - you need to be aware, updates are usually made every two weeks and sometimes software breakages can occur.\n\n", "Q: Why is wireless to wireless transfer so slow? I have two WiFi connected computers via a WiFi modem/router to share my internet connection. This setup works fine to access the internet but I am not able to effectively transfer files between these two computers. The maximum speed is around 300 KB/s and it fluctuates a lot (generally going downwards). Sometimes the download even stalls. Is there something wrong with my Wifi drivers?\nAll my wireless devices are capable of 54 Mbps connectivity. I don't see anything near it while transferring data over my WiFi router to the other computer. Has anybody else seen better performance?\n\nA: The 54Mbps is the upper bound, and in that 54Mbps, a percentage is overhead even with no other devices.\nFull duplex wired networks can also have all devices connected to a router communicating at once...on a wireless network, only one device can talk at a time, and the way they do it is by checking to see if there is anything else signalling, and if so, they wait for a random length of time before trying again.\nSo with your laptop and an access point, that is already two devices sharing the bandwidth. Anything else on that frequency, or even near it, and you will get increased retries, collisions etc. \nEven turning your microwave on may affect it, depending on just how good the shielding is.\nYou also should realise that bps is not the same as B/s - a Byte is 8 bits, so 300KB/s is 2.4MB/s of data, plus a few hunderd K of overhead - so it isn't quite as bad as you think:-)\n", "Q: Do I have to check \"Enable Bookmark Sync\" on both machines running 11.04? If I want to sync firefox bookmarks only one direction, do I have to check \"enable bookmark sync\" on both machines? Both are running 11.04 and firefox 6.01.\nHow about both directions? \n\nA: If you don't enable bookmark sync on a machine, then it will only use the local bookmark store.\nSo if you want to share bookmarks between two systems, both must enable bookmark synchronisation.  Unfortunately, I don't think any of the Firefox bookmark synchronisation systems support one-way synchronisation, so this will give you two way sync.\n", "Q: How do I do a raw write to a cd with dd? How do I do a raw write to my CD drive /dev/scd0? I want to write a bootloader (that takes two sectors) directly onto a CD, is this possible?\n\nA: As CDs are not traditional block devices, writing via dd will likely not result in a usable CD.  If you want to write an image to a CD, use the wodim tool (what used to be known as cdrecord).\nwodim dev=/dev/cdrom file.iso\n\nAlternatively, you can use the graphical Brasero Disc Burner application included in the default install of Ubuntu.\nNote also that a different process is used to boot off a CD compared to booting off a block device like a hard disk.  Rather than just executing code found in the first sectors of the image, it makes use of a process called the El Torito Bootable CD Specification.  In effect there is a table in the CD image that says where to find boot loaders for one or more CPU architectures.  The boot loader either exists directly on the CD itself, or inside a floppy disk image.  In the latter case, the BIOS emulates a floppy drive backed by that image and boots as normal from there.\nIf you want to boot Linux from the CD, I would suggest using the ISOLINUX boot loader.  A copy of the boot loader can be found in the syslinux package.\nIf you want to use some other custom boot code, the floppy emulation mode might be an easier choice.\n\nA: I see a couple of shortcomings with your approach...\nFirstly, it is generally impossible to write arbitrary sectors on a CD-ROM - unlike the hard drives, optical media does not support random writes. Think about CD-R disks, opening/closing sessions and other stuff.\nSecondly, the procedure of booting from a CD is quite different from booting from a HD - in some cases bootable cdroms use an image of a floppy or emulate a harddisk etc. See El Torito standard for more details \nSo, to make a bootable CD, I would imagine you need to prepare a bootable ISO image using ISOLINUX or some other boot loader. Burning that ISO to a CDROM using some standard program such as Brasero or K3b would produce a bootable disk.\n", "Q: Does 32-bit PAE with more than 4GB RAM improve speed? I would like to buy a Thinkpad T420 with 8GB RAM configuration and install specifically 32-bit Ubuntu Desktop with PAE as I heard that 64-bit version has some issues such as providing support for applications based on Flash. Theoretically more RAM gives better speed, but practically there could be some issues such as consuming more power etc. Therefore, I am not sure whether I can get improved speed if I use Ubuntu 32-bit PAE with 8GB RAM instead of 32-bit PAE with 4GB RAM or not, specifically for watching streamed movies, playing videos, video encoding etc. Therefore, I am in dilemma whether to buy T420 with upgarded 8GB RAM or not?\n\nA: PAE with 8GB RAM may be faster than a machine with 4GB RAM, by avoiding paging.  PAE with 8GB RAM will also probably be slower than a 64-bit kernel with 8GB RAM, due to PAE overhead.  Just how much faster or slower depends on what you use the machine for.\nFlash works reliably on 64-bit Ubuntu, so it's no longer a reason to install a 32-bit OS. 32-bit binaries will just run on 64-bit Ubuntu without you needing to do anything special.  So the short story is, today, if you have 4GB or more of memory, you should just install a 64-bit kernel.\nPhoronix did some benchmarks showing a substantial disadvantage to PAE on some tasks.\nMore RAM uses more power, and gives more opportunities for something to fail.  The main benefit is that with more RAM, your machine needs to do less physical disk IO, but this is only a benefit up to the point that all the data it touches fits in memory.  So, there is no point installing more memory than will actually be useful to fit your typical working set.\n\nspecifically for watching streamed movies, playing videos, video encoding etc\n\nThe first two don't need a lot of memory; only enough to make sure your browser and video player are not paging.  The second is mostly cpu-bound, not ram-bound.\nSo, either 4GB or 8GB memory would be fine.  If you expect to do development or other more memory-intensive tasks later, get 8GB.  Either way, install a 64-bit kernel.\nThe AMD deck \"Myths and facts about 64-bit Linux\" from 2008 makes these points:\n\n\n*\n\n*64-bit mode allows more registers, wider registers, and new instructions, so both applications and the kernel can be more efficient, even ignoring the issue of memory use\n\n*64-bit mode is often faster even on machines with under 3GB RAM \n\n*32-bit apps run very well on 64-bit kernels\n\n\nSince 2008 most applications will be primarily developed in and tuned for 64-bit mode.\n\nA: PAE does not improve speed but gives you the chance to use more than 4GB of memory. The performance impact is very little actually and you will only \"feel it\" if you start using the memory above the 4GB limit. Basically if you have a 32Bit PAE Enabled system with 8GB RAM the performance impact will only come AFTER an application starts using the memory above de 4GB (This is the one from 4GB to 8GB). But the impact is very little. You will not notice it. What you will notice is 4GB of more ram.\nAlso for a system with 4GB of ram is not needed or recommended to use PAE since you are not going over the limit which is the 4GB of ram (which is a 2 by the power of 32 in bytes)\nFor videos like flash games, flash youtube videos, etc.. you won't notice anything different from a 32Bit with PAE or a 32bit without PAE. It will be the same performance.\nLastly, the performance and issues associated with the 64Bit Version of Ubuntu last i heard were solved with several flash updates (Like the Flash 10.3 version) so if you install it right now and then install the flash version of adobe you should not have any problems.\nNow for the \"Should I buy or not buy the laptop with 8GB or ram\". Well if you are like me on my home that the things i use it are to listen to music, see movies in HD quality, download stuff, open like 10 Libreoffice documents to work on, open Firefox and Chrome to work, etc.. then you do not need 8GB of ram. With 4GB of Ram you should be not just fine but happy (since you did not overspend on 4 more GB of ram to not use them).\nNow if you are like me on my work place and you like to compile stuff, configure servers, render images and videos, etc.. Those are some heavy usage cases. So you need more ram for them to operate faster. Rendering something with 4GB is not the same as 8GB. Same for compiling (with the appropiate flags) and for the rest of the intensive cpu/memory apps.\nBut for the normal work, video watching, typical downloader and common user 4GB is enough.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Install 64-bit version better, it gives some performance improvements. With Ubuntu 11.10 even better because it is based on the new Debian multi-arch which means that it can install 32 and 64 bit programs on any architecture so there are no disadvantages in the 64-bit system compared to the 32-bit.\n\nA: PAE is useful when you have 4GB RAM or more. In case if you have no problem with specific software you may have, try a 64-bit OS. \nGood luck.\n", "Q: Change the default Downloads directory I originally had a Downloads folder, but decided to create a separate partition for it.\nSo I renamed Downloads to Downloads2. I know, I should have just cut and pasted the content, but this seemed easier.\nAnyway: for some reason Downloads2 was now the default Downloads directory. It even got the Ubuntu Download icon (the arrow alone)\nBut no matter what I do now: Downloads2 is still the default download directory. Even changing its name does nothing this time around. How is that possible? And how do I change it?\n\nA: Ubuntu Tweak can be useful for you this time, but includes the install of the Ubuntu Tweak software, whose intuitive GUI will guide you on this and some other useful processes.\nWhen installed, simply choose Ubuntu Tweak from within the System Tools sub-menu in the main menu. After which you can go to the \"Personal\" section in the sidebar and look inside \"Default folders\", where you can choose which will be your default folder for Downloads, Documents, Desktop, etc.\n\nI hope this help you.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Nautilus-the-file-browser is smart enough to notice that you're renaming a \"special\" folder (\"Downloads\" in your case) and adjust its settings to use the new name.\nThe settings are stored in the file $HOME/.config/user-dirs.dirs - you can either edit this or just do some trickery with renaming your current Downloads2 back to Downloads via Nautilus.\nThen you can move the contents from there to a separate partition and then mounting that partition as $HOME/Downloads.\nSee this question for more details.\n\nA: In Nautilus try Bookmarks > Bookmarks.  You can edit the locations of the bookmarked folders.\n\nA: Use xdg-user-dirs-update\nxdg-user-dirs-update --set DOWNLOAD /absolute/path/to/new/download/folder\n\n", "Q: How can I fix a \"disk not ready error\" when booting from USB?

Thinkpad T420 comes with an option of choosing between NVIDIA NVS 4200M Graphics with Optimus Technology, 1GB DDR3 Memory and Intel HD Graphics 3000. \nWhich one has better compatibility with Ubuntu?\n\nA: Note that while both NVidia and Intel graphics are well supported in Ubuntu, Nvidia Optimus is a complelely different beast - it's a technology to seamlessly switch from an energy-efficient Intel chip to the powerful NVidia chip when an application requires some extra performance.\nMy understanding is that the current state of support of this feature in Linux is not complelely free of trickery. See Project Bumblebee for more details and be ready to get your hands dirty :)\n\nA: you have for the Nvidia card the proprietary Drivers that can be installed during or after the Live CD installation. So its not a problem to install them. One click away. You also have the open source version of it, the Nouveau version. It is good, but if you do pick Nvidia I highly recommend (Until Nouveau catches up to the proprietary one), to install the proprietary version of the Nvidia driver.\nNow for the Intel, it is my understanding that it will work out of the box but to fully have the Intel power of the HD series of cards you can wait for Ubuntu 11.10 or upgrade 11.04 when it comes out. There has been several updates regarding the Intel HD series.\nBut if you tell me, which one runs better, faster with little to no hassle, then I would go with the Nvidia using the proprietary drivers.\n\nA: Both nVidia's and Intel's are known to be well supported on Ubuntu, nevertheless you can find issues reported by users like this: Poor Performance with Intel HD 3000 GPU and I am sure that there are also known bugs with nVidia drivers as well... a search in this site will drop lots of documented issues (try this) \nAnyway, in my experience, nVidias are better supported and reports less major issues or less of those kind of issues that requires a hard work in order to get it fixed.\nI would suggest you to go for nVidia if it doesn't represent a more expensive investment.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I own a T430 with the Intel graphics option and I've been using it out of the box on Ubuntu 12.04 with triple display  (two external monitors and thinkpad LCD), 3D acceleration in the desktop manager and WebGL support on all browsers and even hot-swap monitor configurations without any reconfiguration, logout or reboot. And did I mention \"out-of-the-box\"?\nI just got myself another T430, this time with the nVidia Optimus option. So far spent about eight straight hours and three reinstalls and can't get things to work. Google is not encouraging: there are several convoluted and partial solutions and no consensus what's best.\nHands down: avoid nvidia optimus at all costs\n", "Q: How to remotely lock out users from logging in temporarily I'm not sure how to word this. I would like to be able to, remotely, lock down my kids' access either for an amount of time, or have lock/unlock control. Basically, I want to lock out an account temporarily until I unlock it remotely.\n\nA: A quick-and-dirty solution would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*ssh into the box\n\n*change the password of the user your kids log in with (\"sudo passwd kiddies\")\n\n*issue \"sudo poweroff\"\n\n*tell them to finish their homework before they can use the machine again.\n\n\nThere may be better ways to disable a user account without changing the password, such as\nsudo usermod --expiredate 1 kiddies\n\nor \nsudo passwd -l kiddies\n\nand to unlock:\nsudo passwd -u kiddies\n\n\nA: Not sure about doing it remotely, but you could just change the password and change it back when they are allowed to have access again. You could try LogMeIn or Teamviewer.\n\nA: You could do it with a root cron job that creates and deletes \n    /etc/nologin\nSee \"man login\" for information.

If I use the first vim to copy a line (with yy), how do I paste to another terminal's vim (with p)? Is there any command or settings can do it? Can I copy and paste into the global system clipboard?\nI know the following ways are possible, but I want a simpler one:\n\n\n*\n\n*I do not want to exit the first vim and reopen the second vim.\n\n*I do not want to use separate window (with :sp).\n\nA: I move around between various Unix-family machines and have found the following sequence always works for me:\nIn source vi session:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use ESC m a to mark first line\n\n*Use ESC m b to mark last line\n\n*Use :'a,'b w! xfer to write out range to a scratch file\n\n\nIn destination session:\n\n\n*\n\n*Move cursor to insertion line\n\n*Use ESC :r xfer to read in text\n\n\nI know it's not pretty but it always works for me!\n\nA: First you must install a clipboard-enabled version of vim. To accommodate users with non-graphical environments (eg Ubuntu Server users), vim and vim-tiny do not hook into this capability. You'll want to install GVim , which be launched either graphically or in your terminal. GVim will replace the vim command.\nYou can yank the text into the 'cut buffer' from the first vim, and then paste the text into the second vim. To copy to the global cut buffer, use the + register. The \" key allows you to specify which register to use when doing a yank or paste operation.\nIn the first vim, yank a line into the + register:\n\"+yy\n\nthen, to paste from the + register in the second vim:\n\"+p\n\nFor more information on the registers available, check out :help registers. You can also use \"+p to paste text copied from any other source on your system.\n\nA: Its actually quite simple: install a version of vim that supports clipboard. if your vim does not, get any one of the following:\nsudo apt-get install vim-athena\nsudo apt-get install vim-gnome\nsudo apt-get install vim-gtk\n\nOnce installed, just run vim. You can also verify that clipboard is enabled by running:\n vim --version|grep clipboard\n\nyou should see +xterm_clipboard.\n\nA: Best solution that worked for me (that doesn't require me to change my keybinding habits) is here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9166328/how-to-copy-selected-lines-to-clipboard-in-vim\njust put:\nset clipboard=unnamedplus\n\nin your .vimrc.\n\nA: You will probably all hate this answer. I used to work in vi back in the 80's on a variety of Unix computers and have had the recent occasion to play around in Linux.  \nMy solution to cut and paste is using Putty running on Windows to access my Linux box. \nPutty lets you copy any txt in it's window by simply highlighting it. you can then go to another Putty window/session and right-click to paste. \ncouldn't be easier. and now there's vim. too bad that wasn't around back in my day, it would have helped me fend of the emacs mafia. \n\nA: I like the solution of Bill, and I have created a mapping:\nvmap <leader>y :w! /tmp/vitmp<CR>                                                                   \nnmap <leader>p :r! cat /tmp/vitmp<CR>\n\nthe first one in visual mode copy all in /tmp/vitmp\nand the second one copy the content from /tmp/vitmp in the file\n\nA: It's not exactly using yy, but if you select the text you want to copy with mouse (sometimes you may need to use Shift-[drag]), switch to the other terminal window and do a [middle click] or Shift-[middle click] there, the text will be inserted at your current insertion point.\nThis works for most command-line and GUI programs, not only for vim.\n", "Q: updatedb & locate command problem - Files from external hard drive are no longer indexed after rebooting Files from my external hard drive are no longer indexed after rebooting.

This configuration is set in the file /etc/updatedb.conf. Specifically the entry /media in the PRUNEPATHS line.\nSome ideas how you can make updatedb to index your external drive:\n1. Mount the external drive unter /mnt.\nIf your external harddisk is supposed to be mounted permanently then I suggest to configure it so that it is mounted under /mnt instead of under /media. That can usually be done by editing /etc/fstab. Search for \"fstab\" to learn about that. You will need sudo rights to edit /etc/fstab.\n2. Create a dedicated database for your external harddisk and query that on demand.\nThe following command will create a dedicated database:\nupdatedb -l 0 -o ~/.externalharddisk.db -U /media/externalharddisk\n\nThis will create the database in the hidden file .externalharddisk.db in your home. You do not need sudo for that command. Execute the same command again to keep the database updated. Carefull: if you run that command while the external harddisk is not mounted then updatedb will think the files are deleted and will empty the database.\nYou can set up a script to automate that task. Search for \"cronjob\" to learn how to do that. Note: you can set up a user cronjob as user. You do not need sudo rights to set up a user cronjob.\nThe following command will query the database:\nlocate -d ~/.externalharddisk.db searchterm\n\nYou can also query the dedicated database and the default database at the same time:\nlocate -d ~/.externalharddisk.db: searchterm\n\nThe colon at the end followed by nothing means to also search in the default database.\nYou can make an alias for easier use. Put the following line in your .bashrc:\nalias locate-external='locate -d ~/.externalharddisk.db:'\n\nNow you can use locate to search only the default database and locate-external to also search in your external harddisk.\n3. Remove /media from PRUNEPATHS\nNote: I do not recommend this! This is because of the way updatedb works. If updatedb runs while the external harddisk is removed then all entries pointing to the external harddisk will be removed from the database. If updatedb runs while the external harddisk is connected then entries pointing to the external harddisk will be added again. Since updatedb is running regulary in the background you can never be sure whether the files from the external harddisk are currently indexed or not.\nFurthermore: if you remove /media from PRUNEPATHS, this behaviour will also apply to any other external storage you happen to have mounted while updatedb is updating the database.\n\nA: In updatedb.conf you have /media in PRUNEPATHS. You should remove it, since your external drives seem to be mounted there.\n\nA: These are further embellishments to be added to Lesmana's answer \n[1] slight embellishment: may i suggest adding the -i to make sure case of the query searched is no longer an issue: so to add to .bashrc >> \nalias locate-external='locate -d ~/.externalharddisk.db: -i'\n[2] As regards the updating of both databases; the one in the main HD and the new one in the external; it is probably worth adding one more entry to the .bashrc    \nalias updateALL='sudo updatedb && updatedb -l 0 -o ~/.externalharddisk.db -U /media/externalharddisk'  \nand then to simply run updateALL in terminal to update both databases at once\nPS:of course do not forget to run . ~/.bashrc to firm it all up once a new line is saved in the .bashrc\nPS²: and of course too externalharddisk in all the lines above is replaced by the name of your external HD name ie /media/YOURHDNAME\n*PS³  and you can of course conflate both update and locate in your .bashrc\nalias LO='sudo updatedb && updatedb -l 0 -o ~/.externalharddisk.db -U /media/externalharddisk ; locate -d ~/.externalharddisk.db: -i'\nso now all you need to update and search is to enter   LO 'followed by the terms you seek'\n", "Q: Have desktop load first after login before loading the indicators This is weird. My laptop which is newer and faster by over twice as much than my desktop, and 64-bit nonetheless VS 32-bit, seems to boot slow compared to the latter. What is even more weird is that the laptop appears to load the DE slower because it attempts to ready everything in one go. As a result, after logging in, it is stuck for how many seconds with just the GDM background (the default Ubuntu wallpaper) before it loads the desktop. Imagine a KDE splash screen after login without the splash! Not very pretty.\nI know having a lot of indicators can be one main cause, but I almost have the same indicators on my laptop and desktop, the latter just ahead by one more indicator. I'm not saying desktop is faster on this (loading the DE) but the impression is faster because the difference is that after logging in on the desktop it will very shortly load Unity interface then load the indicators one by one. The progress can be seen on the top right portion as the indicators appear. \nThis is how I want it ideally. Is there a way to recreate this? Some settings under compiz, GDM/Gnome or Unity, or whatever I have to tweak to get this behaviour?\nThank you! :)\n*note: As indicated above, I am on Natty with Unity\n\nA: It seems after several boots, like almost 2 weeks in (yes the 64-bit Ubuntu is about that old because the prev 32-bit with PAE really was too buggy) the loading process of the desktop has settled in better. The loading time has decreased and appears to be faster.\nThe behavior is still far from what I wanted or expected because I was used to my desktop where Unity launcher and top bar would load very shortly after log in then it will load the indicators after, not load it all at once in one go.\nI am curious how two things could be so different when supposedly this is the same version I've installed except that it's 64-bit. Then even the desktop has a smoother bootsplash screen and shutdown process. I hardly see any command line text that makes everything very ugly and dirty, but on the laptop plymouth is hardly seen in the beginning and lots of \"ugly\" text during shutdown before plymouth takes over.\n", "Q: Desktop version to server migration I have installed ubuntu desktop 10.10 and lamp server and i am using it for past 6 months. and i never use that computer for anything else..

I've installed Servers and installed the ubuntu-desktop package if I felt the need for a GUI on the system. I'm sure doing the reverse would work as well.\nIf you want a GUI but do not want the additional bloat that comes with Desktop edition, go ahead with it. Uninstalling Open Office, GIMP, Firefox etc should not cause any problems at all.\n\nA: Surely you can do this though apart from uninstalling the office suite, which would free several hundred megabytes of diskspace, most other programs use very little disk space so uninstalling them would give you little benefits for the time spent. \nAlso be aware that some programs are required for Ubuntu to function properly so it's possibly to accidentally uninstall the whole desktop while trying to uninstall, for example, evolution.

How do I add a directory to the $PATH in Ubuntu and make the changes permanent? \n\nA: sudo vi /etc/profile.d/SCRIPT_NAME.sh\n\nadd there \nexport PATH=YOUR_PATH_WITHOUT_TRAILING_SLASH:$PATH\n\n\nA: The recommended way to edit your PATH is from /etc/environment file\nExample output of /etc/environment:\nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\"\n\nFor example, to add the new path of /home/username/mydir\nPATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/home/username/mydir\"\n\nThen, reboot your PC.\n\n\nSystem-wide environment variables\nA suitable file for environment variable settings that affect the system as a whole (rather than just a particular user) is /etc/environment. An alternative is to create a file for the purpose in the /etc/profile.d directory.\n/etc/environment\nThis file is specifically meant for system-wide environment variable settings. It is not a script file, but rather consists of assignment expressions, one per line.\nNote: Variable expansion does not work in /etc/environment.\n\nMore info can be found here: EnvironmentVariables\n\nA: Whenever I \"install\" my folder of BASH scripts, I follow the pattern of the test for a $HOME/bin folder that's in most .profile files in recent versions of Ubuntu. I set a test that looks like \nif [ -d \"/usr/scripts\" ]; then\n   PATH=\"/usr/scripts:$PATH\"\nfi\n\nIt works just about 100% of the time, and leaves me free to change it in a GUI text editor with a quick \"Replace all\" should I ever decide to move /scripts somewhere closer to my $HOME folder. I haven't done so in 6 Ubuntu installs, but there's \"always tomorrow.\" S\nBZT\n\nA: I think the canonical way in Ubuntu is:\n\n*\n\n*create a new file under /etc/profile.d/\n sudo vi /etc/profile.d/SCRIPT_NAME.sh\n\n\n\n*add there:\n export PATH=\"$PATH:YOUR_PATH_WITHOUT_TRAILING_SLASH\"\n\n\n\n*and give it execute permission\n sudo chmod a+x /etc/profile.d/SCRIPT_NAME.sh\n\n\nA: Using ~/.profile to set $PATH\nA path set in .bash_profile will only be set in a bash login shell (bash -l).\nIf you put your path in .profile it will be available to your complete desktop session. That means even metacity will use it.\nFor example ~/.profile:\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n  PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/bin\"\nfi\n\nBtw, you can check the PATH variable of a process by looking at its environment in /proc/[pid]/environ (replace [pid] with the number from ps axf). E.g. use grep -z \"^PATH\" /proc/[pid]/environ\nNote:\nbash as a login shell doesn't parse .profile if either .bash_profile or .bash_login exists. From man bash :\n\nit looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that\n  order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists\n  and is  readable.\n\nSee the answers below for information about .pam_environment, or .bashrc for interactive non-login shells, or set the value globally for all users by putting a script into /etc/profile.d/ or use /etc/X11/Xsession.d/ to affect the display managers session.\n\nA: For complete newbies (like I am) who are more comfortable with GUI:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your $HOME folder.\n\n*Go to View → Show Hidden Files or press Ctrl + H.\n\n*Right click on .profile and click on Open With Text Editor.\n\n*Scroll to the bottom and add PATH=\"$PATH:/my/path/foo\".\n\n*Save.\n\n*Log out and log back in to apply changes (let Ubuntu actually load .profile).\n\n\nA: Open your terminal, type gedit .profile and insert the following:\n# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists\nif [ -d \"$HOME/bin\" ] ; then\n    PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/bin\"\nfi\n\n #the following line add Bin where you dont have a Bin folder on your $HOME\n    PATH=\"$PATH:/home/mongo/Documents/mongodb-linux-i686-2.2.2/bin\"\n\nClose and open terminal, it should be working.\n\nA: For persistent environment variables available to particular users only. I highly recommend Ubuntu official documentation.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables\nReferring to documentation above, I have setup my Android SDK path-tools by:\n\n\n*\n\n*creating ~/.pam_environment file in home directory.\n\n*the content of which is PATH DEFAULT=${PATH}:~/android-sdk-linux/tools.\n\n*additional custom user path can be added by separating paths with colon (:).\n\n*this requires re-login, which means you need to log-out and log-in back to desktop environment. \n\n\nA: Edit .bashrc in your home directory and add the following line:\nexport PATH=\"/path/to/dir:$PATH\"\n\nYou will need to source your .bashrc or logout/login (or restart the terminal) for the changes to take effect. To source your .bashrc, simply type\n$ source ~/.bashrc\n\n\nA: Even if system scripts do not use this,\nin any of the cases that one wants to add a path (e.g., $HOME/bin) to the PATH environment variable, one should use\nPATH=\"${PATH:+${PATH}:}$HOME/bin\"\n\nfor appending (instead of PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/bin\"),\nand\nPATH=\"$HOME/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}\"\n\nfor prepending (instead of PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\").\nThis avoids the spurious leading/trailing colon when $PATH is initially empty, which can have undesired effects.\nSee e.g. https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/162891/append-to-path-like-variable-without-creating-leading-colon-if-unset\n\nA: Put it to your ~/.bashrc or whatevershell you use rc (or to beforementioned ~/.profile) AND ~/.xsessionrc so it will also work in X (outside shell).\n\nA: Put that line in your ~/.bashrc file.\nIt gets sourced whenever you open a terminal\nEDIT: Based on the comments below, for a more general setting that will apply to all shells (including when you hit Alt-F2 in Unity), add the line to your ~/.profile file. Probably shouldn't do both however, as the path will be added twice to your PATH environment if you open a terminal.\n\nA: The recommended place to define permanent, system-wide environment variables applying to all users is in:\n/etc/environment\n\n(which is where the default PATH is defined)\nThis will work in desktop or console, gnome-terminal or TTY, rain or shine ;)\n\n*\n\n*To edit, open the terminal and type:\nsudoedit /etc/environment\n\n(or open the file using sudo in your favorite text editor)\nTo make it work without rebooting, run . /etc/environment or source /etc/environment. Since this file is just a simple script it will run and assign the new path to the PATH environment variable. To check run env and see the PATH value in the listing.\nRelated:\n\n*\n\n*EnvironmentVariables - Community Help Wiki\n\nA: Adding it to .bashrc will work but I think the more traditional way of setting up your path variables is in .bash_profile by adding the following lines.\nPATH=$PATH:/my/path/foo\nexport PATH\n\nAccording to this thread it appears as though Ubuntu's behavior is slightly different than RedHat and clones.\n\nA: To set it system wide, append the line export PATH=/path/you're/adding:$PATH to the end of /etc/profile.\nTo add the directory for only the logged-in user, append the same line to ~/.bash_profile.\n\nA: In terminal, cd to the_directory_you_want_to_add_in_the_path\necho \"export PATH=$(pwd):\\${PATH}\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\nThis wasn't my idea.

It is up to the creator of the file to decide whether the name should have an extension. Linux looks at the first few bytes to figure out what kind of file it is dealing with.\n\n\n*\n\n*To remove all non-hidden files* in a directory use:\nrm /path/to/directory/*\n\nHowever, this will show an error for each sub-directory, because in this mode it is only allowed to delete files.\n\n*To remove all non-hidden files and sub-directories (along with all of their contents) in a directory use:\nrm -r /path/to/directory/*\n\n* Hidden files and directories are those whose names start with . (dot) character, e.g.: .hidden-file or .hidden-directory/. Note that, in Bash, if the dotglob option (which is off by default) is set, rm will act on hidden files too, because they will be included when * is expanded by the shell to provide the list of filename arguments.\n\nA: Since this question is constantly at the top of Google when I search for this myself:\nThe other answers suffer from different problems:\n\n*\n\n*Some of them include . and .. which is noisy, confusing, and annoying.\n\n\n*Some of them forget hidden files (files beginning with a dot).\n\n\n*They don't delete in a correct (deepest-first) order to allow directory deletion.\n\n\n*They descend into other (mounted) file systems, which is often undesired.\n\n\n*They're difficult to extend properly with extra parameters (more on that below).\nSo, to RECURSIVELY delete all files AND folders in a directory, do this:\nfind \"${DIR}\" -xdev -mindepth 1 -printf \"%d\\t%y\\t%p\\0\" | sort -z -r -n | cut -z -f3- | xargs -0 -r -- rm -d --\n\nNote that I added an -xdev argument to prevent descending into mounts (like /proc etc.).\nWhy not -depth or -delete?\nDespite people constantly downvoting me for this, those methods have a downside: it doesn't seem like they're extensible enough to allow -pruneing a subdirectory (without introducing more problems). By contrast with this method, you could insert\n-not \\( -path \"${DIR}/subdir\" -prune \\)\n\nbefore the -mindepth argument to exclude subdir from having its contents deleted.\n\nA: *\n\n*To remove a folder with all its contents (including all interior folders):\nrm -rf /path/to/directory\n\n\n\n*To remove all the contents of the folder (including all interior folders) but not the folder itself:\nrm -rf /path/to/directory/*\n\nor, if you want to make sure that hidden files/directories are also removed:\nrm -rf /path/to/directory/{*,.*}\n\n\n\n*To remove all the \"files\" from inside a folder(not removing interior folders):\nrm -f /path/to/directory/{*,.*}\n\nWarning: if you have spaces in your path, make sure to always use quotes.\nrm -rf /path/to the/directory/*\n\nis equivalent to 2 separate rm -rf calls:\nrm -rf /path/to\nrm -rf the/directory/*\n\nTo avoid this issue, you can use 'single-quotes'(prevents all expansions, even of shell variables) or \"double-quotes\"(allows expansion of shell variables, but prevents other expansions):\nrm -rf \"/path/to the/directory/\"*\n\nWhere:\n\n*\n\n*rm - stands for remove\n\n*-f - stands for force which is helpful when you don't want to be asked/prompted if you want to remove an archive, for example.\n\n*-r - stands for recursive which means that you want to go recursively down every folder and remove everything.\n\n\nA: To delete all files and directories(including the hidden ones) in a directory, you can try the following:  \n\n\n*\n\n*delete the folder, then recreate it\nrm -rf dir_name && mkdir dir_name\n\n\n*use find\nfind dir_name -mindepth 1 -delete  \n\nHere we specify -mindepth 1 to exclude the directory dir_name itself.\nTake a look at the following link:\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12593/how-to-remove-all-the-files-in-a-directory\n\nA: You can cd into the directory and then run the command rm *.* just like in DOS if you remember.\n\nA: If you want to delete only files in /path/to/directory you can do \nfind /path/to/directory -type f -print0| xargs -0 rm \n\nor\nfind /path/to/directory -type f -exec rm '{}' \\;\n\nYou can do loads with find, the advantage is you can list what is found without piping it to rm so you can see what will be deleted before you start.\n\nA: To delete current directory, you could for example use rm -d ./*\n-d tells to delete directories as well.\n", "Q: Set wireless automatically to connect my network How I can make automatically wireless connect to my network, because first of all it always tries another one and only after this it connect to correct one, or it is impossible?\n\nA: Right click on the NetworkManager applet in the top panel and select \"Edit Connections...\"\n\nOn the Wireless tab select and delete all connections that you don't want to connect to.\n\nFinally choose your WLAN connection and click on Edit. \n\nMake sure you have Connect automatically enabled.

Almost every text editor supports some features such as syntax highliting, try gedit.\nMany developers still prefer working in command line with vim editor. It's very powerful, but it has (for today) unusual control mechanisms (3 modes, etc.). See http://www.vim.org/\nIf you prefer more powerful IDE, there are 2 options included in the Ubuntu packages by default. However, noone of them is installed out of the box. You can get NetBeans and Eclipse by simple:\nsudo apt-get install eclipse\nsudo apt-get install netbeans\n\nBoth of them are based on java so you need java to run them (java is installed by default so you don't need to bother with this). I have very good experience with NetBeans, it supports many programming languages, enterprise features, versioning etc. Check it out on http://netbeans.org. However, usually there is not the latest version in the packages so you can download it from the webpage. It works perfectly for me, except updates, so I need to update manually.\nI don't have any experience with eclipse but it's said to be even better than NetBeans. Especially, it supports many SDKs or addons for special development like Android or Windows Azure.\nThe third option of IDEs I'd offer to you is IntelliJ IDEA. As far as I know, it's not present in packages, but you can download it on the official webpage: http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/. There is many versions of JetBrains IDEs, supporting different languages and providing different options. Some of them are free, some of them are paid.\nOf course, there is a LOT of more options. Depends what language are you willing to use, what services you need to connect to etc.\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu ask to check my hard drives every so often? Recently, I've been compelled to restart my computer a lot. When I boot, Ubuntu now starts scanning my hard drives for errors, but assures me that I can cancel if I want by pressing 'c'.\nWhy does Ubuntu do this? If it's necessary, why is it something I can cancel? If it's not necessary, why force me to do it? On what basis is the number of restarts decided?\n\nA: These are routine file system checks, initiated every 30 reboots. The option to cancel it is there so that you are not detained from something critically important, however, it's recommended to let it run once in a while. I don't know on what basis the number of reboots was set, presumably, common sense. If it's too annoying, you can increase the number of reboots without checking partitions using the 'tune2fs' command.\n\nA: A disc check is forced by the system every 30 restarts. If you skip the disc check it will do it the next time you restart (unless you manually remove forcecheck). \nYou can force this yourself by putting a file forcefsck in / by issuing a\ntouch /forcecheck\n\nfrom the terminal.\nIt is not necessary to always do a check when it's prompted but should be done every now and then. You can cancel it if it is not the right moment for you at that time and let it do the file system check when it is more convenient. \nYou can also use tune2fs to alter this behaviour.\nsudo tune2fs -c 60 /dev/sdXY\n\nwill set this to 60 restarts.\nYou can also change this to a time period with -i:\nsudo tune2fs -i 30d /dev/sdXY\n\nfor 30 days or 1m for 1 month or 10w for 10 weeks.\n(replace /dev/sdXY by the device name for the partition like /dev/sda1. You can get this name by running sudo blkid or ls -lA /dev/disk/by-label if the partition is labelled)\nsudo dumpe2fs /dev/sda1\n\nwill show loads and loads of information. Part of this includes: \nFilesystem created:       Thu Feb 12 09:06:50 2009\nLast mount time:          Fri Aug 26 07:19:34 2011\nLast write time:          Fri Aug 26 07:19:34 2011\nMount count:              2\nMaximum mount count:      25\nLast checked:             Fri Aug 12 07:22:16 2011\nCheck interval:           15552000 (6 months)\nNext check after:         Wed Feb  8 06:22:16 2012\n\n\nA: It is possible to completely disable the file system check on ext-filesystems using:\nsudo tune2fs -c 0 /dev/sdXY\n\nThis might not be a good idea thou. The tune2fs manpage notes: \n\nYou should strongly consider the consequences of disabling mount-count-dependent checking entirely. Bad disk drives, cables, memory, and kernel bugs could all corrupt a filesystem without marking the filesystem dirty or in error. If you are using journaling on your filesystem, your filesystem will never be marked dirty, so it will not normally be checked. A filesystem error detected by the kernel will still force an fsck on the next reboot, but it may already be too late to prevent data loss at that point.\n\n\nA: While mikewhatever and Rinzwind are right for ext-Filesystems, afaik, it doesn't happen if you choose to use reiserfs. I'm using it for 10 years without problems and can recommend it. No fsck any more.\nI don't know for the other filesystems, popular on Linux. \n", "Q: Moved HDD to another server and networking wont work Had to move hard disks from one server to another.  System boots fine and I can access the command line of the server from the console.  However the networking seems broken.  the /etc/network/interface file still has the same static IP setup as before.  The link light is on on the NIC but I just cannot get it to ping out and am unable to ping the server.   pinging the loopback works fine so networking is running. \nUsing lshw -class network I can see the device I have connected listed.\nAm I missing something obvious here or am I going to have to reinstall (which does need to be done at some stage due to some other mistakes I have made oops)\n\nA: The name of your network device will likely have changed. Run\n/sbin/ifconfig -a\n\nThat should list all of the interfaces that have been detected. You will likely find something like eth1 in there. If you replace eth0 with eth1 in /etc/network/interfaces and then run \n/sbin/ifup eth1\n\nit should bring your network up.\nAn alternative is to rename your new eth1 to eth0 by editing /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules and rebooting.\nNote that the interface names may differ on your specific system.\n", "Q: What GPARTED alternatives are available?

I'm working with two virtualized servers which keep time extremely poorly for some reason, so that one is always a little bit ahead of the other (up to 2 seconds).

I've tried:\n./ meaning\n./ ubuntu\nIt was the same as nothing. :(\n\nA: Others have already explained what . and .. means (current directory and the parent directory respectively). This applies to all path names.\nWhen you open a terminal, you usually start in your home directory: ~ (which expands to /home/username). The below paths are all equivalent, providing your current working directory is /home/username:\n\n\n*\n\n*/home/username\n\n*.\n\n*../username\n\n*../../home/username\n\n*../../../home/username (the parent directory of / is still /)\n\n*./././././. (the current directory in the current directory in the ...)\n\n*./ (trailing slashes are allowed for directories)\n\n*/home////username/// (and so are multiple slashes)\n\n\nDo not confuse ./program with . program. ./program runs a file in the current directory with the execute bit set. . ./program is a bash thing and can alternatively be written as source ./program which reads bash commands from the program file in the current directory and executes them in the current shell.\nIf you wonder why you can just run gedit instead of /usr/bin/gedit and not program instead of ./program or /home/username/program, see the related question:\n\n\n*\n\n*What are \"$PATH\" and \"~/bin\"? How can I have personal scripts?\n\nA: ./ or just . is unix shorthand for the current directory. \nYou need to specify it when the current directory is not in your PATH. The PATH is the list of folders searched when you run a program. (You can determine it by writing echo $PATH.) If an executable file is not in your PATH, to run it you need to specify the folder it's in. You could do this by giving the full path to the file, but if the file is in the current directory, you can use ./ as shorthand.\nSimilarly, ../ or just .. is shorthand for the directory above the current one.\n\nA: It means to start from the current directory path.\nLet's assume you have a path like this:\n/usr/ /usr/bin/ /usr/local/bin\n\nand inside /usr/bin/ there is an executable called yiic.\nIf you issue yiic it would start the one in /usr/bin/. \nBy issueing ./yiic you tell the system to look inside the current directory for this executable.\n\nA: Every directory in the command line has two \"special directories\" called . and ... These are shorthand for, respectively, the current directory and the directory containing the current directory.\nSo for example, cd ./more/directory/names just means, \"start at the current directory and continue in the path.\" Similarly, the command cd .. means, \"change one directory up.\nIf you want the name of your current directory, you can use the pwd command. Also, if you use the -a flag for ls, you can see these two special directories. That is, ls -a will output a list starting with . and ...\n", "Q: How do I get the GRUB menu to display? I've been having this issue with my hp dv7t laptop. I fixed it using the recommended option: set GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash radeon.modeset=0\" and run update-grub. \nHowever, that caused a different problem. Before, even though ubuntu would go into a blank screen, the grub menu would always show. Now, GRUB loads (I know that since switching the \"beep on load\" option works), but I don't see the menu, or anything else, until the timeout is hit and the default option boots. This makes the system workable, but I don't like not having a recovery option and not having a grub menu in general.\nThere are no other OSs on the system, it's a clean install of Ubuntu Natty 64 bit.\nHitting shift after GRUB loads doesn't help.\nHow do I get the GRUB menu to show up?\n\nA: Hold down the Shift key while your computer is booting up, and don't let go until it actually shows.

My question is how can I use it to search for files like I could in the Start menu of Windows 7? Presently it just shows some file names if they were used very recently and in the present session. Is this a problem because my files (mostly music) are on a different drive than the one in which Ubuntu is installed? \n\nA: The dash is a shell in Ubuntu, and you can search in the shell, but not very good with the shell.\nYou use locate, find, which, whereis and so on, to search for files, and you can do it from the dash, but it would work the same way as in other shells, like bash or zsh. \nI don't know how the 'recently used' search works on windows, but I guess the programs have to use a certain library, to work that way, and I see multiple problems. \nIf you start a program on linux, this file is read, some libraries are read, configurations in /etc/foo or ~/.foo are read, or maybe both. A single program can open hundrets of files, but most of them without the intent to modify them. But it can be filtered, such that only files, opened with the same file-open-dialog get protocolled. \nBut that would mean, that files, opened written with the gtk-toolkit would be protocolled, those written with Qt wouldn't. \nBut if they are moved with some tools, filemanager, command in the shell - the system will not update that change. \nThe same problem ocucurs, when you use removable storage like USB-Sticks, or modify files in the cloud from a different working place. \n", "Q: Why can't I open files and locations across a home network?

Please help me understanding Apache configuration better since I'm new to setting up my own server (I've only run XAMPP earlier) and please advise regarding how I should set up a firewall as well :D\n\nA: You need to tell Apache that it should use name-based virtual hosting instead of IP based. So append the following to your /etc/apache2/apache2.conf to define:\nNameVirtualHost ip.address:port\n\nAnd each virtual host should define a port:\n<VirtualHost example.com:80>\n\n\nA: I think you'll need to add your public IPs as well if you want other computers to be able to connect.

Is there any? I really like the way markdown is implemented in SE bunch of sites, where I can easily write code blocks, performing formatting or even use latex on some of sites like writing $\\pi$.  I also like how this online editor looks and feels. But it's all online.\nIs there any offline WYSIWYG analogs of notepag or WMD in Ubuntu that optionally supports pdf as an output format? Both markdown and latex desired.\nI desire to simultaneously use Markdown and LaTeX. I'm planing to use an editor for writing some technical stuff with math, but it's annoying to be constantly in \"LaTeX-mode\". So it would be awesome to immerse in LaTeX when I need formulas and use markdown when I need to speak on natural language.\nUPD. Almost all answers was quite useful, but none of them answers directly on my question. I'll accept @N.N. answer as a most complete.\n\nA: Lyx comes to mind. It's technically a LaTeX editor, so it's maybe a bit more complicated than you're looking for. But it is basically WYSIWYG, and supports LaTeX. I don't know of any other document editors that do that.\n\nA: I recently discovered Zim, a very interesting editor, that is meant as a note taker and organizer, that supports a sort of markdown and the insertion of mathematical stuff, and is WYSIWYG. \nHere is the description:\n\nZim aims to bring the concept of a wiki to your desktop. Every page is\n  saved as a text file with wiki markup. Pages can contain links to\n  other pages, and are saved automatically. Creating a new page is as\n  easy as linking to a non-existing page. This tool is intended to keep\n  track of TODO lists or to serve as a personal scratch book. But it\n  will also serve you when writing longer and more complicated\n  documents.\nA \"desktop wiki\" means that we try to capture the idea of a wiki, not\n  as a webpage but as a collection of files on your local file system\n  that can be edited with a GUI application. The main focus is a kind of\n  personal wiki that serves for all kind of notes: todo-lists,\n  addresses, brainstorm ideas etc.\nBut we want to go further then just a wiki filled with random content.\n  It should also be possible to use you random notes as the basis for\n  more structured data: articles, presentations etc. Zim will not\n  include tools to layout a presentation or something like that, you\n  should use your office suite of choice for that, but it should be a\n  tool that can deliver all the content for a presentation in a form\n  that only needs a template and some layout before usage. Therefore\n  certain features normally not found in wikis will be added.\n\nand here are a couple of screenshots:\n\n\nIt is available in Ubuntu repos, but a more up-to-date PPA version is available too.\n\nA: I suggest that you stick with LaTeX (only) for the following reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*In using a markup external to LaTeX you'd need an additional program (editor or compiler) to pdflatex or whatever you use. This may be an unnecessary overhead and may make it so that it's harder to share your files due to portability (LaTeX is commonly used for technical texts but not some markup solution). If you stick with LaTeX you don't need this overhead.\n\n*In using a markup external to LaTeX you may lose some of LaTeX's tremendous customizability.\n\n*You can match the ease of writing with a markup such as WMD in LaTeX.\n\n\nI can think of the following ways to ease writing with LaTeX:\n\n\n*\n\n*Autocomplete. Use an editor that suggest completion of phrases, e.g. to suggest \\emph{ if you start to enter em.\n\n*Snippet management. Use an editor that lets you define snippets, e.g. if you write em and press Tab it will enter \\emph{} and place the cursor between {} and place the cursor after } as you press Tab again. If you use gedit see http://live.gnome.org/Gedit/Plugins/Snippets.\n\n*Use an editor in which you can use templates (either via a template function or snippets), e.g. so that you may write something short or press some keys to input a certain document class, some packages to load and the places the cursors between \\begin{document} and \\end{document}. This way you'll start writing on a new document with LaTeX in an instant.\n\n*Use a setup that makes compilation and viewing of output easy. This means using an editor that suits you and that you know well. The following list might be interest for you https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/339/latex-editors-ides. Also, you might find tools such as latexmk.\n\n*If you think some macro is verbose define your own macro around it. Say that you find \\longmacroname{} verbose, then you can define a shorter macro name around it such as \\newcommand\\foo[1]{\\longmacroname{#1}} so that you may use \\foo{} instead. Note that this can be a bad practice if macro names are hard to understand for those reading your code.\n\n\nA: ReText and some conversion tools might be interesting:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://sourceforge.net/p/retext/home/ReText/\n\n*http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/\n\n*http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/\n\n*http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/\n\nA: I just discovered https://stackedit.io/editor.\nApparently it is also available offline and includes many other interesting features aside from being a WYSIWYG Markdown+LaTeX editor/viewer.\n\nA: There is retext, but I do not think it supports LaTeX, though it is possible that you can ask the author to add support for it.\nTo install it on Ubuntu:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mitya57\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install retext\n\n\nA: http://www.inkcode.net/qute was a lightweight markdown editor with LaTeX support.  Seems abandoned — no developement since 2013.\nIts standing out feature is per-paragraph toggling between markdown editing and display, which gives 3 benefits:\n\n\n*\n\n*While writing you'll be mostly seeing a nicely-formatted document, not source.\n\n*You don't need Synctex to jump between document and source - you just click to edit in-place.\n\n*Better use of screen space than 2 side-by-side panels (although that's available too - F12).\n\n\nA downside is that it's too lightweight on features.  E.g. \"Qute does not support undo and redo. You may try Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y, but unpredictable things may happen.\" :-)\n\nA: There is a reasonable solution to your needs posted on tex.SE, which provides a markdown environment within latex documents, so that you can easily enter markdown throughout the document. The environment uses pandoc to convert the markdown syntax to tex, and inserts it in place.\nI say it's only 'reasonable' because it seems that you wanted to be mostly within markdown, with occasional breaks to latex, and this solution is rather the reverse, being a latex document that provides for markdown syntax.\nhttps://tex.stackexchange.com/a/101731/14811\n\nA: If you are mathematically/statistically inclined, it is possible you already use R. If you use the RStudio IDE for R it provides a version of Markdown (RMarkdown) which accepts maths using LaTeX. I can only speak first-hand for the Windows implementation - which I find superb.

Typical examples of such\n  services are Netflix and Amazon Instant, which both use the\n  proprietary browser plugin Silverlight. These services cannot normally\n  be used on Linux since this plugin is only available for Windows, and\n  the only open source alternative (Moonlight) is lacking support for\n  DRM.\nPipelight helps you access these services by using the original\n  Silverlight plugin directly in your browser, all while giving you a\n  better hardware acceleration and performance than a virtual machine.\n  Besides Silverlight, you can also use a variety of other plugins that\n  are supported by Pipelight. Take a look at the installation page for a\n  complete list.\nPipelight uses a patched wine version to provide a windows environment\n  to the plugins, but you do not need to worry about this as Pipelight\n  will take care of installing, configuring and updating all supported\n  plugins. From the perspective of the browser these plugins will behave\n  just like any other normal Linux plugin after you have enabled them.\n\nInstallation instructions are available here: http://pipelight.net/cms/install/installation-ubuntu.html\nAdditional steps are needed to enable to Unity 3D web player plugin in your browser, which are detailed here: http://pipelight.net/cms/plugin-unity-webplayer.html\n\nA: The player you said doesn't seem to support Linux as of yet. It would be really hard to get this working and not worth your time. \nDid you try using the Internet Explorer that ships with Wine? Try installing the latest version of Internet Explorer on Wine and see if that plugin installs in that browser. Download it first, put it in that virtual C drive and keep doing something until it works/ breaks. \nIf that doesn't seem to work, you may try VirtualBox like Sergey suggested, but i think it would be useless to play games in VirtualBox.\nSomething not related to question: If you want to watch some videos in 3D then try Bino player. It enables you to watch videos in 3D... So, if you wanted to watch a video in 3D, you can use it.\nOr may be you can record your browser screen and later watch it in 3D, but that just sounds crazy. There are some players like this in software center, so check out if any of them helps you in watching your browser in 3D. May be you can try your luck with Firefox addons too.\n\nA: They are about to launch the Unity4 preview which will provide a Linux client. \nI think it will be available during the summer.

The sync worked flawlessly from the start to the end but after looking at the result I noticed that some songs were missing on the Android device. After looking closer to the problem I saw that only songs that had a special characters in the name (&, /, +. etc) were not synched.\nAre there other people having this problem and has anyone found a solution? Preferably one that does not consist in changing song names :)\n\nA: This is not just a Banshee problem, most syncing programs - rsync for example - also chokes when certain special characters exist within file names.  And that's the issue, it's filenames, not song names that cause problems - song names are recorded in metadata.  Knock up a shell script that replaces these special characters in the filenames, rescan and everything should look the same but should now sync without issue.\nRegards,\nSimon.\n", "Q: Why does my Thinkpad X220 screen get garbled after a while? I am running 11.04 Desktop 64bit on my Thinkpad X220 which is brand new. I ran Windows on it for a few days and that seemed to run fine. It's still on there on a separate partition. \nUbuntu installed OK, with no major issues except that my screen gets garbled at irregular intervals. The way in which it gets garbled is not consistent -- see example screens below -- and I have found no way to reproduce it.\nIt never happens straight after bootup, it seems to mostly occur after a day of work. I can keep working, everything responds like there is nothing wrong, except I can't see what I'm doing anymore. Needless to say this is hyper annoying. Before I send the laptop back to get it repaired or replaced, I would like to try and find out if this even a hardware problem or if it's traceable to Ubuntu. It does not seem to happen under Windows but then I rarely boot into Windows.\n\n\n\nA: Long time ago I had very similar problems with some videocards - both times it turned out to be a symptom of the videocard dying.

In Ubuntu you can do this by pressing Alt-Ctrl-F1 and then Alt-Ctrl-F7\n\nA: I have a similar problem with 11.04 on my X120e.  It gets fixed by entering screen-off mode and then coming back to normal.  That is, I run xset dpms 3 4 5 wait 6 seconds until the screen is thoroughly off, then move the mouse to bring the screen back and run xset dpms 300 301 302 to return to a normal 5-minute screen-off time.

I use a lot of terminal windows (at least three, up to 5 or 6). \nIf I am working in one of them, and switch to another app via the unity launcher (say the web browser), and then come back to the terminal windows by clicking on the terminal icon in the Unity launcher, the window that had focus and was raised is not raised anymore and may or may not still have focus.\nThis is really annoying as I have to dig under all the other terminal windows I do not want to finally find and click on the one I do want.\nIs there a way that Unity can remember which terminal window had focus and was raised?\nUpdate: thanks to everyone, but as far as I'm concerned this is a bug in Unity\n\nA: You can also use the Alt-` shortcut to switch between open windows of the same application.  It's not exactly a solution, but it might help you get back to your terminal faster. I typically use Alt-Tab to get to the terminal application and then switch to whatever window I need.  \nYou could also use scale function to show all your windows and then click the window that you want.  By default, I believe the shortcut is Super-W, but it can be changed in the compiz settings manager under Window Management->Scale->Bindings->Initiate Window Picker for All Windows\nHope this helps! \n\nA: IMHO this is a bug in Unity. The last used window in an application group should be the one raised and with focus when I come back to this group by clicking on it's button in the launcher\nI won't report any more unity UI bugs, though, given the treatment that obvious UI shortcomings in Unity are given: see this one for example\nI switched to terminator: problem solved\n\nA: A solution could be put the terminal window always on top (right click on the title bar > Always on top), then roll it up. \nRolled up window example\nYou can enable roll up action with double click on the title bar, going to System Settings > Windows, and changing double click action from Maximize to Roll Up.\nThen, you can put the rolled window on a corner, doing what you want with the other application, and when finished roll down the window.\n\nA: I use Alt+Tab to get back to my terminal. \n", "Q: Can I run a remote X session in windowed mode?

See this link for some initial details (update - the info there is obsolete, see below).\n\n*write a simple script which adds an emblem to the file and then launches the media player. The above link even has a sample script for reading the emblems\n\n*set up the script as the preferred application for opening video files \nOf course, the script won't be able to tell whether you finished watching the video, whether you were watching carefully or if you want to re-watch it again - you can set emblems manually for that.\nUPD: Actually, here's how to set emblems on a file. The rest is trivial...\nUPD2: Here's a simple script which labels a file and opens it in totem:\n#!/bin/sh\ngvfs-set-attribute -t stringv \"$1\" metadata::emblems favorite\ntotem $1 &\n\nSave it somewhere and set executable bit. Then you just right-click on a video - Open with - Other application - Use a custom command - [x] Remember this application - enjoy! :)\n\nA: startme=date %s\nvlc $1\nendme=date %s\ntimewatched=$(( $start-$end ))\n\nI have a script which goes WAY beyond this, including remembering videos in a \"favorites\" folder that is rescored after every viewing. This is based on a combination of time watched, total time watched for all videos, and number of times viewed for that file and for all files. I also have one of these for image galleries and might make one for music, but what's really needed is for this stuff to be incorporated into geeqie, vlc and whatevermusicplayerthatdoesntsuckorusemonothatwillbesupportedinthefuture.\n\nA: Right click on the file and add a note via the Properties. With any text therein, the file icon gets an overlay image resembling a note (which in your case cud mean that this video is watched).\n\nA: This is not an inherent ability in either nautilus or nautilus-elementary and there aren't any extensions that have this functionality. \nSo no, unless you can develop an extension to do this. I imagine such an extension would need to use zeitgeist to accurately tell if a video has been watched.\n", "Q: Animals popping up randomly There are pictures of animals that are popping up randomly on my computer.  When I move the mouse over the animal it turns into a a sword icon, and when I click it, the animal disappears but after a few minutes another animal comes up.  I think it may be related to Chromium but I'm not sure.\nWhat is this and how can I get rid of it?\n\n\nA: If you are not joking then this can be a mistake. May be there is some web script or a background process running.\nSo what you can do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close browser and see if animal appears again.\n\n*If appears again then type ps -A in terminal and watch for any suspicious process and terminate it as soon as you see it.\n\n*If you can not see any suspicious process, restart your computer.\n\n*If nothing works feed it what it wants and pray to God that it runs away without harming you.\n:D\n\n\nA: I found it... it was a Chrome extension (I think called \"MMO\")...

Converting .tif to .jpeg I'm trying to mass convert a handful of .tif files. I found phatch could look like a good candidiate but I'm running Ubuntu 11.04. Looks like they don't have a .deb for my version.\nAnyone have any alternatives to phatch or any other recommendations as to quickly batch convert tif to jpeg files.\nI'm looking for a non-Photoshop (ala Wine) solution.\n\nA: Use mogrify, the tool intended for batch processing inside ImageMagick\nmogrify -format jpg *.tif\n\nIn case you don't have ImageMagick:\nsudo apt-get install imagemagick\n\n\nA: I found this question while trying to do it myself; for future reference you can also do it like this:\nconvert *.tiff -set filename: \"%t\" %[filename:].jpg\n\nor to put it in a subdirectory\nmkdir jpg\nconvert *.tiff -set filename: \"%t\" jpg/%[filename:].jpg\n\n\nA: Easy. Install imagemagick:\nsudo apt install imagemagick\n\nIts simplest usage is:\nconvert File.tif File.jpg\n\nIt is smart and goes by your file extension.\nNow, for doing batch conversions, we shall use a loop.\ncd into the directory where your tif files are.\nthen:\nfor f in *.tif; do  echo \"Converting $f\"; convert \"$f\"  \"$(basename \"$f\" .tif).jpg\"; done\n\nRead also as:\nfor f in *.tif\ndo  \n    echo \"Converting $f\" \n    convert \"$f\"  \"$(basename \"$f\" .tif).jpg\" \ndone\n\nThat should do it!\nAlso, once you convert all of the files and verify the new jpg's integrity, just run rm *.tif in that directory to delete all your old .tif files.  Be careful with asterisks though, don't add a space after the *, or you will delete all your files in the directory.\nTip: If you have a folder with subfolders that holds these images. You could use this for loop to find all .TIF files within that folder:\nfor f in $(find -name *.tif); do ...; done\n\n\nA: Imagemagick should be able to convert them. It is a package of commandline programs, if you are OK with that.\nPart of that is convert - \nman convert: \n\nconvert  -  convert  between  image formats as well as resize an image,\n         blur, crop, despeckle, dither, draw on, flip, join, re-sample, and much\n         more.\n\n\nA: If you prefer a GUI application, you can install Phatch through the normal repositories. Just open Ubuntu Software Center and search for it. I'm not on 11.04 anymore but I had it installed back then.\n\nA: The answers above use *.tif for tif selection, but this will return an error if you have too many files in your current working directory. A simple workaround is to use a python script to convert each file in the cwd:\nimport glob, os\n\nfor c, i in enumerate(glob.glob('ecco_images/*')):\n  print(' * converting', i)\n  os.system('convert ' + i + ' ' + i.replace('.TIF','.jpg'))\n\n\nA: I would like to add to @Matt's answer that if you would like the files to be saved in the subfolders you can do the following:\nfind . -iname *.tif | while read f; do echo \"Converting ${f}\"; convert \"${f}\" \"${f%.*}.jpg\"; done\n\nThis also handles the issue if your file-path/name has spaces in it.\n\nA: The GIMP GUI Solution Using a Batch Process Plugin\nWorks in Ubuntu 18.04 using GIMP 2.8\nBatch Processor Input dialog window\n\nBatch Processor output dialog window\n\nInstallation Instructions\n\n*\n\n*Download the current plugin file from DBP - David's Batch Processor homepage to your desktop.

Then I can use\nchkconfig sshd on\n\nor\nchkconfig sshd off\n\nHow can I do the same in my Ubuntu 11.04? + How do i mention in which runlevel it should start?\n\nA: chkconfig is for sysv init system and Ubuntu uses upstart, to list all services and their status type initctl list. Currently there is no tool to enable or disable services in upstart so you have to manually rename the file in /etc/init so it doesn't end with .conf.\n\nA: Even if Ubuntu uses Upstart, not all services have been migrated to it yet and hence the old System-V style init scripts (files in /etc/init.d/.)\nAccording to the manual page of chkconfig, off and on are used for stopping or starting services, not disabling them.\n\n\n*\n\n*To start the SSH daemon (which is named ssh), run: sudo start ssh\n\n*Similarly, to stop it: sudo stop ssh\nTo list the status of all services, use:\n (N.B. output is lengthy and goes to stderr)\nsudo service --status-all 2>&1 | more\n\nThese commands work for both the Upstart scripts as well as for the services in /etc/init.d/.\n", "Q: How to make the window manager to show the X - [ ] not on left top corner but bottom left or bottom right corner?

I was trying to make it -90 or -180 or -45 but cant make it yet.\n\nA: I've come across a script that does what you want to do:\n#!/bin/sh\n  rotation=`xrandr -q | grep \"Current rotation\" | cut -d\"-\" -f2`\n  if [ $rotation = \"normal\" ] ;\n  then\n    xrandr -o left   <-------- change it to whatever you want\n  else\n    xrandr -o normal \n  fi\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Simply save these lines in a file and make it executable. The script\nsimply checks for the current rotation mode. If it’s normal then it\nsets it to left, otherwise it sets it to normal. (note that to use\nthis script, you must have the RandR extension and your video driver\nmust support it).\n\n\nAs you can see you can change just those values to fit your needs.\nOr just type this:\n   xrandr -o orientation <------- where \"orientation\" is left, right, normal, etc.\n\nSource\n", "Q: Why does my screen go gray?

I have a Dell N5010 15R with a 64-bit i3 processor, Intel HD graphics, 320GB hard drive and integrated network card. I wanted to know which Ubuntu version to install in order to have the capacity to use the HD integrated graphics card's full potential. \nI want to get in Ubuntu and stop using Windows 7, but will it run programs like FL Studio or Vegas Studio Pro or similar?\n\nA: The hardware should work nicely with Ubuntu. You're mentioning Windows applications, and those will not normally run in Ubuntu at all. However, there is something called Wine, which can be used to use Windows applications on Ubuntu. Not everything will work, and not everything will run nicely. You can have a look at http://appdb.winehq.org and search for the applications you need. \n\nA: Any Ubuntu flavor will work with your Laptop, They are all the same it's just the GUI and default software (read: Desktop Environment) that's different.\nAbout running FL Studio with WINE: according to WineHQ it runs almost flawlessly. Vegas Studio however won't run at all (except version 9.0e)\n\nA: You should download and try a live-cd and test it before you touch the hardrive. Just keep in mind than the performance will be even better if you decide to install it on the hardrive. Ubuntu would run like a charm on your configuration (my main computer broke some days ago and right now I'm running it in an old pentium 4 with only 300 mb ram and everything works, so imagine in your i3...)\nAlso, you could make a dual boot system if you want to keep win7 just in case you change your mind later (but I don't think you do). There's hundreds of tutorials about it.\n\nA: I have a 17R, bought a month or so ago, so the hardware's probably pretty similar.  The only thing with which I've had a problem is the touchpad -- the protocol used by the touchpad isn't entirely reverse-engineered yet.  This means the touchpad will still work, even with side-scrolling, but some of touchpad-specific features (like turning it off when you are typing) are still under (quite active) development.\n", "Q: How do I resize root partition? I have a dual boot setup with Ubuntu and Windows 7. I need to shrink my root Ubuntu volume in order to get some free space to create a new partition. Are there any Windows based tools that will do this for me? I tried booting up in gparted to do this but I cannot tell which partition is which since I cannot find the size (it displays everything in blocks).\n\nA: You can burn the Parted Magic OS into a CD and boot from that. That OS includes a very basic graphical interface as well as GParted and other graphical tools. It should make a job like resizing any partition really easy, because it boots from ram and you can manipulate any partition from the familiar environment of GParted.\n\n\n*\n\n*Website\n\n*Screenshots: You can note from the screenshots that size on that GParted is displayed quite nicely.\n\n\nResizing a partition is a slow task, so make sure your computer doesn't shut down if you are on a laptop for example.\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot with Ubuntu installation cd, choose to try ubuntu \n\n*Use GParted partition editor to resize your partitions.\n\n\nA: Yes, use gparted.  Boot from your Ubuntu CD and in the terminal type:  sudo -i gparted\nthere you can resize and delete/create partitions.  When you apply the changes, I would recommend not to interrupt the progress.\n\nA: Parted Magic is a good suggestion, but if you already have an Ubuntu live CD or USB stick you can boot from that and run GParted from there. Basically, you need to boot from something which is not the hard drive you're going to resize partitions on.\nAs it's already been pointed out - gparted is a graphical utility, so what you're referring to as \"GParted\" is definitely not it. Which brings me to another important point: make sure you have a backup of everything, because your chances of screwing everything up are relatively high :)\n\nA: Use GParted from live CD/usb of Ubuntu...it is a good tool to work with partitions\nif you don't have a live CD/usb get one, download Ubuntu and burn it on a CD...keeping a live CD with you is always helpful.\n\nA: I had this exact problem, and have since solved it.

The problem is sometimes after a power outage the ntfs gets damaged. If your boot sda1 device were Linux and the ntfs were in sda2, fdsk would repair it automatically during boot. But since the boot is in the same damaged device, it can't.\nIf you have windows, try booting into windows, reach the desktop, and restart it properly. Next time you boot the sda1 would be corrected and linux should boot normally.\n\nA: Use boot-repair as suggested by fossfreedom. \nChoose \"Advanced Options\" → include \"filesystem recovery\" and it should work like a charm. I need a good celebration for having my computer recovered.\n\nA: Boot Repair\nIf you are confident that you have a good backup, I would try Boot-Repair\n\nYou can \"install it\" on your LiveCD - Instructions in the link.\nTry the \"Recommended Repair\" option.

Whenever something happen which require notification (connecting to a wireless network or low battery status) Ubuntu (unity) gives a nice floating message which (usually) vanishes after several seconds.

In its code it says (config_store.py):\nCONFIG_FILE_PATH = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser(\"~\"),\".stackapplet\") \n\nwhich sets the CONFIG_FILE_PATH to ~/.stackapplet. I would have to change the source code manually to override this.\n\nAnother example: wireshark\nhomedir = getenv(\"HOME\");\nif (homedir == NULL) {\n    pwd = getpwuid(getuid());\n    if (pwd != NULL) {\n        homedir = g_strdup(pwd->pw_dir);\n    } else\n        homedir = \"/tmp\";\n}\npersconffile_dir = g_strdup_printf(\"%s\" G_DIR_SEPARATOR_S \"%s\", homedir, PF_DIR);\n\nThis gets the home directory path either from the HOME environment variable, or from the /etc/passwd entry for the current user, or it sets it to /tmp if all fails. \n\nDifferent programs get the HOME path in different ways, you just can't change all the \"home\" references to /home/user/.config.\n\nA: That depends on each program more than on the system. In some cases you can launch them with shortcuts to specific configurations. ie:\nconky -c /home/user/.config/.conkyrc\n\ndosbox /home/user/.config/.dosbox/\n\nThose comands would save their configurations inside .config (i also dislike having my home full of small files and folders). But I don't know if there's a way to make it default or you'd have to set the configuration and the launche for each program (that if they allow you to set it). I don't think since that would mean changing your whole $HOME value. Somebody correct me if I'm wrong.\n", "Q: GIMP Package dependencies cannot be resolved I need a little help from some friends.

Here is the thing. I got new SSD and want to run clean install of Ubuntu 11.04 on it. I have install usb which I made right after 11.04 was released. And my question is - should I now download again iso image to avoid lots of updates or this is the same version as it was before an I will have to update anyway?\n\nA: Even if you download it again, you'll have to update anyway (there's updates almost every day so if the iso you download now was created some weeks ago, you'll have to update).\nWhat you should do is install with your usb, and when it asks you if you want to download the latest updates from internet during installation answer \"no\". You can do it later from the desktop and it will be faster.\nLet's say the firefox in your \"old\" iso is 5, and the firefox in the \"new\" iso is 6. It doesn't matter because the version in the repos is 6.0.2 so whatever you install it will be upgraded, and it will be the same clean install, don't worry (this is not windows, who gets slower in each update...).\n\nA: No, you can update.

Is this because I don't have permissions to view the content, or does this mean that the hard drive is corrupt/there's nothing there and all my effort is in vain anyway?\n\n\nA: You'll have to set the filesystem permissions on the filesystem, not the block device. So, you'll run chmod on /media/mountpoint, not on /dev/sdx. In any case, root always has complete access to everything, so if you run gksudo nautilus, you won't have any problems accessing any files. \nIt is not unusual for users to have the /home on a different partition. This enables you to reinstall Ubuntu without loosing any personal files or settings. That may be the case. You should look through the other partitions and see what they contain. \nYou can run a smart-test on the drive to see how badly damaged it is.

And i can move my mouse on the left way below the visible part, and the desktop icons are going down there too i have to reposition them manually.\n.\nxrandr --current outputs this:\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 2180 x 1440, maximum 2806 x 2806\nLVDS connected 1280x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 353mm x 199mm\n   1280x768       60.0*+\n   1366x768       60.0 +\n   1360x768       60.0  \n   1280x720       60.0  \n   1024x768       60.0  \n   1024x600       60.0  \n   800x600        60.0  \n   800x480        60.0  \n   640x480        60.0  \nDFP1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nCRT1 connected 900x1440+1280+0 right (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 410mm x 257mm\n   1440x900       59.9*+\n   1280x1024      75.0     60.0  \n   1280x960       60.0  \n   1280x800       60.0  \n   1152x864       75.0     59.9  \n   1280x768       60.0  \n   1280x720       60.0  \n   1024x768       75.0     70.1     60.0  \n   1024x600       75.0     70.1     60.0  \n   800x600        72.2     75.0     60.3     56.2  \n   800x480        72.2     75.0     60.3     56.2  \n   640x480        75.0     72.8     67.0     59.9\n\nI' pretty sure DFP1 is my HDMI output, i', not using that one.\n\nA: Can you configure using xrandr?

This happens in both 11.04 and 11.0. I read in some place that this apps are “blacklisted” to explicitly not use overlay scrollbars, but why?\nEDIT (17 Sep): Now Update Manager has been whitelisted and it uses overlay scrollbars (see this revision). Synaptic still is blacklisted.\n\nA: This was actually a bug which was reported on launchpad.net , it was confirmed by the Ubuntu Team and then subsequently fixed.\nYou can see the history of this bug here: \n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/update-manager/+bug/843456\n\nA: It has possibly something to do with the fact that they are applications requiring root access. If you run synaptic without administrative privileges, synaptic will join the appmenu. If you run it with admin privileges, it will not. My guess is that these parts of the Ayatana framework require D-Bus-communication from app to shell and backwards. However, communication from System-Bus to Session-Bus seems to be problematic.\n", "Q: What gaming keyboard(s) will work with Ubuntu? I've been looking at gaming keyboards to use on Ubuntu system.\nMicrosoft has a few popular ones (e.g., Sidewinder X4, X6), but the programmable function keys appear to be unusable without the Windows software.   (Though here's a post from someone who has a more recent project that uses usbmon and xdotool to add functions to some keys.)\nAnother choice in my budget is the Cyborg V.05.  It seems about right for my needs, but I would be depressed having a bunch of useless, nonprogrammable keys on it. \nLogitech has some models (e.g., the Logitech G110), though again I expect that the extensive macro capabilities (which I don't need) would be lost under Linux.   There's a project called g15tools which has some code to work with older Logitech gaming models, but I don't know what the current status is.  Last entry there was in March 2010.  There are also a number of very old posts around the internet with regard to the Logitech G11 and G15.  Compatibility with the current keyboards, Ubuntu version, and Linux kernel are suspect.\nI'm in the U.S., and so it appears that few of the Roccat keyboards are available, and they're over-priced.  Support might be OK for these, though -- there's a short Phoronix article about Roccat improving their Linux support, and there's also a project and webpage for \"Using Roccat Hardware with Linux\". \nHonestly, the only feature I have to have is good backlighting for the keys, and if it's not wired (which is fine), the wireless capability should function.  I could probably live with dead function keys, as long as they weren't in places that would interfere with things like Unity/compiz shortcuts. \nAny experience or suggestions?\nI've not seen much to inspire confidence with programmable/macro keys.\nThere is a thread (with no solutions) on the Sidewinder X4 on ubuntuforums here.\nI'm also considering the Logitech Illuminated Keyboard as a possibility, even though it's not specifically a gaming keyboard.  It is backlit, and it's supposed to be a nice keyboard.\n\nA: I know this is an old thread, but I would like to toss in my three cents, adjusted for inflation.\nI personally run Ubuntu 13.10 in a home-built quad core gaming rig, which used to run Windows 7 Ultimate x64. I reformatted and installed Ubuntu about eight months ago, and I haven't looked back since. I use a Razer Lycosa backlit keyboard with a matching Razer Imperator mouse, and both work flawlessly. I don't use the built in macros on the keyboard, so I can't vouch for that. What I can vouch for, is the backlighting works perfectly, the multimedia keys are flawless, and the anti-ghosting is excellent. I'm an exceptionally fast typer (90-105 wpm) and this baby never flunks out on me. I've had serious issues with Logitech boards dogging out when I'm in \"beast mode,\" typing reports, papers, etc. I don't get that with my Lycosa. \nThe extra USB port, as well as headphone and mic jacks also work on the back of the keyboard, because they're just extensions/pass throughs from the back of the tower. When you hook up the Lycosa to your PC, you have two USB ports, as well as a mic and headphone jack to plug in as well. \nIn conclusion, the keyboard works perfectly out of the box for Ubuntu, unless you HAVE to have the macros. I'm pretty sure you can plug it into a Windows machine for configuration, and then plug it back into your linux box to use them, since your macros are stored in the keyboard itself.\nThe Razer Imperator mouse also works like a dream in Linux. Since it was first used on a windows machine, the DPI settings were already loaded into the mouse's memory. Once plugged into ubuntu, no software was needed because the Imperator is hardware based. The DPI adjusters on the spine of the mouse still work flawlessly, as well as the extra thumb-buttons for back and forward, or whatever you choose to run there. All of the lights work, and I've had absolutely no mishaps on either device.\nI hope this helps at least one person out there. If so, my work here is done. :-)\n\nA: I tried a Razer Arctosa once, and it ran fine without any issues. It does not have any programmable keys, so I can't vouch for that, but the backlight & the multimedia keys ran fine.\nI'm pretty sure that would be the case with other models as well. A little bit of searching reveals the following blog post, which mentions the additional USB and headphone jacks not working on Ubuntu for a Razer Lycosa.\nMy advice would be to try them out before buying them. Hardware compliance with Ubuntu is not something very strong at the moment, esp in the Gaming sector.\n\nA: Please have a look at this.\nI implemented a user space driver for the Microsoft Sidewinder X6. Has all the same functionality as the windows drivers with the exception of macro recording and run button.\n\nA: I ended up trying then sticking with mechanical keyboards.  These worked \"out of the box\" with Linux/Ubuntu -- no problems. They are a step up in terms of durability (with the mechanical switches rated for tens of millions of keystrokes), and many, including the ones I use, have \"n-key rollover\" -- if you hit several keys at once, they all register flawlessly.  \nThe only issue I had to correct was the scroll lock key and light not functioning correctly (and this fix is documented elsewhere).   I've ended up using two keyboards -- a very nice black Leopold, and a flashier Cooler Master \"CM Storm\".  Both are 87-key \"tenkeyless\" keyboards.   (I'd also recommend looking at WASD Keyboards, which I didn't go with simply because they stocked only full-size boards.)\nThe 87-key keyboards don't have the number-pad, so you get full-size keys but with a smaller footprint.  This is especially nice because you can (assuming you use your right hand for the mouse) get your mouse in closer to the keyboard.  This is more ergonomic, and it may keep your arm and hand from tiring as quickly.  I opted for Cherry MX brown keyswitches, but a lot of gamers prefer the MX black switches.  \nUltimately, I opted not to get backlit keys, but there are several mechanical keyboards that have lighting of various or variable shades.\nAlso of note: I tried the Cyborg keyboard mentioned in the question, and was not happy (I returned it).  It felt too cheaply made for what it cost, and I thought the backlighting was blurry and distracting.\n\nA: Roccat hardware support is great, thanks to Stefan Achatz\n& Roccats  high end feature's are awesome\nbut they are costly!\nmay i suggest some cheap chinese mechanical keyboards, because they tend to use standard drivers\nbut i personally use all there hardware & i love it\n", "Q: Unable to suspend - power manager vanished Recently, after a few upgrades, I find that the power-management applet indicator has\nvanished, and the option of Suspend has suddenly changed to Power-off.

(AFC protocol) I have an jailbroken iPod Touch, and I have the afc2add package.  When I  plug it into my ubuntu laptop, it automounts my iPod's Media directory, as well as the app file sharing folders too.  When I use Nautilus to transfer a file into the Media folder, it peaks at about 5MB/s.  However, when I use a terminal to copy a file to the ~/.gvfs/Matt's iPod folder [In Nautilus, it shows up as \"Matt's iPod\"], I have only seen it go up to about 2MB/s.  \nCan anyone give any clues as to why it is over half slower to cp a file instead of using Nautilus's GUI copy?   \nBy the way, the I can tell how fast it is going with a terminal copy, I have a script with pv [In a nutshell, it is: pv $1 > $2], and that was going about 1.5MB/s.  So I also tried cp, and set up a loop to du the file every second, and it jumped up somewhere near 2 MB every second.\n\nA: Nautilus would be going through fewer layers of indirection, which could account for the difference.\nNautilus is a native gvfs application, so it communicates with the gvfs backends directly.  \nIn contrast, cp is talking to the kernel via a FUSE file system mounted at ~/.gvfs, which is handled by the gvfs-fuse-daemon process, which in turn talks to the gvfs backends.  Impedance mismatches between the POSIX API and gvfs might account for the less efficient transfers.\nYou might be able to get similar performance on the command line using the gvfs-copy command from the gvfs-bin package, copying to the appropriate  URL.\n", "Q: irw isn't picking up all of my remotes keypresses I have a Harmony 650 remote I am using for XBMC. I have it set up as a MCE remote in lirc using an HP ir usb receiver. When I run irw, not all of the keypresses are being picked up. I can see the red light flashing on the receiver, but nothing in irw. The only keys it is picking up are Channel Up, Channel Down, OK, 1, 2, and 3. I was considering using irrecord to create a custom lirc.conf file for the remote, but wanted to check if anyone had any ideas first.\n\nA: I had a similar problem trying to get a remote working with MythTV on Natty.  It seems that the kernel in Natty has IR remote capability built in and this should work with many types of IR remote.  However, the problem is that the kernel maps some of the keys to keycodes greater than 256 and X can only handle keycodes in the range 0-255.  I was eventually able to get my remote working by re-mapping the necessary keycodes to stay within this range.  This is done using a utility called ir-keytable (in repository).  It can also be used to track key presses instead of irw, which does not seem to work with the kernel driver.\nNote that I did not need to install lirc to get this working.\nHope this points you in the right direction.\n", "Q: No root file system is defined error after installation I installed ubuntu through Wubi and once i rebooted I get no root file system defined error. here's the output of the

I want to use the dvorak-fr-bepo keymap in the console (tty1 to 6) when I type Ctrl + Alt + F1. In particular, I need the special characters as \"Ê\" or \"ç\" since there are some in my password.\nSo directly when I installed Ubuntu, I chose for the Bépo layout when asked.\nNonetheless, the consequence is that I am able to type basic characters, but not special ones. For instance, when I typed BÉPO I got only \"bpo\".\nOn the contrary, when I used to use a French Azerty layout, I could type the special characters.\nHow do I definitely set a different keyboard-layout in the console?\n\nA: Install package console-common, then use commands install-keymap to install a default keymap from a .kmap file, or loadkeys to switch between layouts. Use man on these commands for more info.\n", "Q: What's they Key combination for the Compiz Grid Plug in? I've installed compiz setting manager.

The num is on on the numpad. What exectly should I press to move window to the grid? Thanks.\nUPDATE: Maybe the problem caused by virtual machine? I'm running Ubuntu as guest machine. But another hotkeys work well.\n\nA: 1) Make sure the Grid plugin is enabled.  \n\n2) Click over the shortcut key combination and change it to what you want.  \n \nAs our friend Uri Herrera said above, it makes difference if you use numpad keyboard.   \nEnjoy ;-)\n\nA: It's probably because you're on a virtual machine. Do other Compiz effects work?\nSome hotkeys are related to Compiz, but not all. The one that worked for you may have been a standard Gnome one.\n", "Q: creating .deb package but bad permissions into destination folder I'm building a .deb package for my latest game, http://sundaycoders.host-ed.net/download.html.\nEverything is OK concerning files locations, menu entries and icon once deb package has been installed.\nThe game files are installed into the directory : \n/usr/games/marball/\nOnce running, the program needs to generate 2 files (first time launch) (.cfg and .sav files) but it doesn't seem that the folder has permission rights to create files into it.\nAny help with this issue? Should I add a command during the .deb package build process?\n\nA: In Unix those things should go into user's home folder - something like $HOME/.marball/game.cfg etc.\nThe user won't (and shouldn't) have permissions to modify files in /usr/whatever\n\nA: /usr/games/marball is a system wide location, meaning that changes to files here will affect all users. This is why ordinarily a program run by a normal user can't create files here. It looks like the files you want to create are configuration and saved game files. On a multiple user system you would want to be able to have separate saved games and configuration for each user so storing these files in a system wide place wouldn't be suitable even if you changed the permissions to allow for this.\nThese files should be stored in the user configuration directory. To get this directory, you should first look for the environment variable \"XDG_CONFIG_HOME\". If this doesn't exist, use ~/.config (you can get the location of '~' from the \"HOME\" environment variable). In this folder your game should create a 'marball' folder and use this as the location of 'marball.cfg' and 'Marball.sav'.\nYour game is cross platform so you will need to only use this method on Linux. However, it is good practice to store these files  somewhere in the home folder (or equivalent) on all platforms.\n", "Q: How to control fan speed on my desktop? I found a post on \"How to control the fan speed on my laptop\" but nothing about the same thing on a desktop. I'd like to replicate the same thing on my desktop but till now I had not such luck. \nI tried to do the same thing on that post, so I followed every step. Unfortunately I got stack in \"3. Configure fancontrol\" when you execute the command sudo pwmconfig. I get the following message:\n# pwmconfig revision 5857 (2010-08-22) \n\nThis program will search your sensors for pulse width modulation (pwm)\ncontrols, and test each one to see if it controls a fan on\nyour motherboard. Note that many motherboards do not have pwm\ncircuitry installed, even if your sensor chip supports pwm.\n\nWe will attempt to briefly stop each fan using the pwm controls.\nThe program will attempt to restore each fan to full speed\nafter testing. However, it is ** very important ** that you\nphysically verify that the fans have been to full speed\nafter the program has completed.\n\n/usr/sbin/pwmconfig: There are no pwm-capable sensor modules installed\n\nSo when at the point \"4\" I execute the command sudo fancontrol I get:\nLoading configuration from /etc/fancontrol ...\nError: Can't read configuration file\n\nIs what I'm trying to do even even possible on a desktop computer?\n\nA: On a desktop, I'd be more inclined to look at controlling the CPU fan speed in the BIOS rather than through the OS. From what you've written, it looks like your Motherboard doesn't support software control of the CPU fan anyway. In most Bios setups, there is an option to change the heat to speed ratio of the fan, that would be my first port of call if you have a hot or noisy cpu/fan.\n\nA: Baring being able to control speed/noise with software, Zalman makes a hardware adjustable fan speed controller that costs less than $10 and works with 3 pin computer fans. Not all fans are software speed controllable. I may be mistaken but I've read that a 4th pin is required for software control. You can determine which fan is noisy by applying pressure to the center hub a fan to slow it down and identify which fans are noisy. Put the controller in line with the fan power and turn the knob slowly until the noise is no longer audible. You can also install the lm-sensors package to get readings of fan speeds and resulting temperatures. In my case, adjusting for sound cut the fan speed in half and there was no difference in temperature for the cooled processor.\n", "Q: Why can't I buy more storage?

The virtual host is using qemu-kvm. \nAccessing the virtual windows using virt-manager is possible, but way to slow. Using rdp with tsclient is much better, but still not that fast.\nIs there a better way to access the guest system?\nIs VirtualBox that much besser when accessing the graphical windows desktop?\n\nA: If you want something that really rocks, you'll probably want to have a look at SPICE, which works with KVM and the newest virt-manager. It really is something else. The last time I played with it on Ubuntu, it was a little difficult to get up and running, but it was definitely worth it. I know people have been working to make this easier, but I don't know how how far they've come. \n\nA: I tried using kvm as desktop virtualization for Windows XP in the early days. As you pointed out as well, the access to ghe graphical interface is the biggest problem. I used rdesktop directly in full screen mode back then, but ended in using VirtualBox just because of that...\nI'm really happy now with virtual box, its fast and reliable. Even browsing which is probably one of the most graphic intense application I use is working fine.\nI must admit that I have never tried SPICE, so it might be worth to take a look at that first.\n\nA: Xen is known to be very good at this but you will need to compile and configure it by ur self. It has direct access to the Hardware which gives big performance improvements.

I'm looking for a program that will grab media files (photos and videos) from my camera (or cell phone) via USB and download and rename them.\nAs a benchmark, I'm comparing against cam2pc which has some crucial features -- and I can't find a Linux tool that handles video files as well. Unfortunately cam2pc doesn't run very well under Wine, otherwise this question would be unnecessary.\nThis is what cam2pc lets me do, which is what I'm looking for on Linux:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the program (or have it start automatically when a camera device is connected).\n\n*Select from a list (or preview) of photos and videos to be downloaded.\n\n*\n\n*JPG, AVI, MOV must be supported.\n\n\n*Review/edit the renaming pattern that will be applied to the photos and videos after the download, in particular taking the date from their creation timestamp and not from EXIF because videos don't have EXIF.\n\n*\n\n*Must support a user-customizable pattern for the downloaded files, like\npath/year/year-month-day hour-min TOPIC serial#.lowercase-extension\ne.g. photos/2009/20091218 1214 Skiing with friends 003.avi\n(In cam2pc, that would look like %Y%m%d %h%u %P %{num:3}.%{ext})\n\n\n*Click start, lean back, end of story.\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Renaming according to EXIF won't do, because video files don't have EXIF data but they should be renamed to fit into the same pattern. I don't want to do this manually for video files, after the photos have been renamed (it's what I do now, and it's no fun).\n\n*I attempted to write an elaborate shell script to copy the photo/video files and rename them according to their creation timestamp. I am not a developer or shell guru, so this quickly became too complicated. I'm thinking there must be someone besides me that downloads video shots off their cameras, who also want to rename the shots. What to they do?!\n\n*Most photo-management tools I've found ignore video altogether, and they certainly can't rename them. If anyone can point me to a program that does this (well), I would be most grateful!\n\n\nA: While preparing to re-write the shell script and looking at Launchpad.net, I came across Rapid Photo Downloader which on first view looks to be an exact match.\nUpdate:\nRapid is  a very cool program but for some reason it doesn't see any pics in my iPhone. I think that's not a problem with the program but rather with my phone or my computer.\nUpdate 2:\nAccording to Rapid 's developer, the problem likely is that some Gnome component needs updating and that it won't make it into Rapid for a good while. Too bad for me.\n", "Q: How do I save all images from .xls file? I've got a xls file with exactly 167 images that I must save and post on a website. The sheer number itself is painful, but what complicates things is that you can't directly save images from Calc - you need to copy it to Writer first and then save. \nThis isn't the way I would like to do things, so is there a way to save all the graphics in the file somehow?\n\nA: *\n\n*Open the xls file in OpenOffice or LibreOffice\n\n*save it as a open document (.ods). \n\n*rename file to  have .zip extension\n\n*uncompress that zip file\n\n\nAll images should be in a Pictures/ directory in that zip file.    \nThis also works if you are given a .PPT which can be saved in Impress.\n\nA: If you want to get scripty there are some perl scripts to unpack Open Document Formats at:\nhttp://books.evc-cit.info/odbook/ch01.html#unpack-program-example\n", "Q: Panel theme reverts to standard GNOME in indicator area My top bar looks normal up to the point where the indicators appear.

There are many applications and Ubuntu updates among them. but there's no dependency failure because they were all downloaded by 'add/remove applications' and 'update manager' automatically. \nNow I have installed the same version of Ubuntu (9.04) and I want to install those apps and updates again(though they are not new versions). In other words, I want to make this fresh Ubuntu install exactly like the old one but without downloading any thing and using only those .deb files that I copied. All I have is an archive folder containing the .deb files and a 'pkgcache.bin' file.\nI know I can double-click the .deb files and install them manually but then I have to find out and follow the dependencies one by one from the installer errors. \nI have also tried adding an offline repository but it didn't work. I think because all of my .deb's are in on folder, and there is no separate 'main', 'restricted', ... folder?!\nIs there a way to do all of this automatically?\n\nA: Eureka!\nAll I had to do to install a group of .deb files automatically was:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd deb-files-location\n\n*sudo dpkg -i *.deb\n", "Q: How to index a pdf document? I am reading a PDF document in Ubuntu 11.04 using the default \"Document Viewer\". The document is more than 500 pages and it takes a while to complete a \"Find ...\" for a particular text. Is there a way to index the PDF documents on the above mentioned platform? I am looking for a functionality inbuilt into the reader itself.\n\nA: Tracker can index your pdf documents. It is very fast and reliable.   \nIf you don't use this great tool yet, you can configure it to only index your pdf documents:  Alt+F2 then paste tracker-preferences go to \"Locations\" and choose the folder of your pdf.  \n\nA: I'm not sure any of the pdf readers support text indexing - probably because the indexing itself would be rather expensive and pdf files opened and closed 'ad-hoc'\nHowever, I've done some testing and can see that okular - the default viewer from KDE - has much faster search than evince (the default viewer from Ubuntu). I.e. it takes maybe a second for okular to scan the whole 500-page document, while evince spends ~5 sec on the same task.\nYou can install it by typing\nsudo apt-get install okular \n\n(or just search for it in the Software Center)\nif this is the first KDE program on your machine it would require installing quite a bit of dependencies, but it may be well worth it - I'm finding KDE programs generally more capable then their Gnome counterparts... Okular supports pdf annotations, for example, which is also useful sometimes.\n\nA: Alternate PDF viewer\n\nOverview\nA very lightweight and fast alternative to Okular that doesn't come with any of its KDE dependencies is qpdfview. It's still in beta but I found it to be just as stable as its big counterparts. Search performance is fantastic and at least on par with Okular.\nInstallation\nQpdfview ist not yet available in the official repositories but can be easily installed from the developer's PPA by typing:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:b-eltzner/qpdfview && apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install qpdfview\n\n\nPDF indexing\n\nOverview\nI wasn't able to find an alternative to Adobe Acrobat's indexing capabilities on Linux and it appears that's because embedded indexes still aren't part of open PDF standards. \nHowever, there are a number of very powerful desktop search engines out there that are both faster and more efficient in PDF indexing than Adobe's proprietary tools. Tracker has been mentioned already but there are other apps out there as well. You can find a very thorough comparison here.\n", "Q: How to start and kill the procedure? I have some runnable-jar files. I want to run them at regular intervals and also kill those processes after some time. I am a newbie when it comes to Ubuntu or linux in general. Can anybody suggest me the best practice to achieve it?\n\nA: Use something like\n#!/bin/bash\njava -jar <name-of-the-jar-file> &\njavapid=$!\nsleep <some-time-in-seconds>\nkill $javapid\n\nin a file, make it executable (chmod +x ) and run it using\n./<filename>\n\nThis will start the jar-file and kill it after some time. There are several ways to excecute the command at regular intervals. You could use cron ( http://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto ) to always excecut it as long the computer is runnig. Or use a simple shell script loop to start the execution from the command line:\n#!/bin/bash \nCOUNTER=0\nwhile [  $COUNTER -lt 100 ]; do\n     <same as above without the first line>\n     let COUNTER=COUNTER+1 \ndone\n\nThis will run the command 100 times, you could stop the execution simply by pressing ctrl-c.\n\nA: The best way would be to create a shell script that runs the the executable, retrieves the PID of the process then kill it after a certain amount of time. \nYou can then add this as a job in your crontab to launch it at regular intervals. \n\nA: This sounds like a job for cron.\n\nA: For killing a process using kill command, we have to keep track of PID of the process to be killed. So, we have used pkill -f  to kill the process. Now, I only have to remember the name of process and do not want to track the PID. The code for starting process remains the same.

The easiest way to do this is to force a user. (Samba users will access the share using the local user's privileges.)  Make sure that the user you specify has ownership and/or appropriate file system permissions.  For ease of use in my example, I'm using root.\n[root$]\npath = /\ncreate mask = 0755\nforce user = root\nbrowsable = yes\n\nTo answer your second question, the create mask is the default permissions that will be assigned to any file or directory created on the share by a Samba user.\n\nA: Here is a quick start on SMB2 with Samba 4.x .

It has Intel GMA 4500M integrated graphics and worked just fine. Great display, sharp, crisp, etc.\nI decided to do a fresh install of 11.10 Oneiric and now am having problems. Originally I was getting the dreaded blank screen where the brightness was turned almost completely off. Some searching pulled up several easy fixes (editing GRUB).\nRight now I am still having one issue. The screen resolution is stuck at a max of 1024x768 giving me a distorted screen. \nIs there any way to fix this issue? I've Googled, searched Ask Ubuntu and also spent time on the forums looking for a solution. Thus far, nothing. Apparently, was and still is a concern in Natty?\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I have an Intel GMA 4500. I Googled for answers but nothing seemed to solve my problem.\nFinally I came across this that says for acpi_osi=Linux, the brightness meter works in reverse, which was why my display started with a blank screen i.e. since it is reverse, max brightness = blank screen.\nFollowing are a few interesting notes from the link:\n\n\n*\n\n*Without i915.modeset=0 the backlight does appear to start in the off position. Hitting Fn-brighter once turns it back on. On my keyboard, brighter is Fn-left-arrow and dimmer is Fn-right-arrow, which is different than I usually see.\n\n*Starting with kernel modesetting gets me a graphical console that works fine\nuntil X tries to start.\n\n*X won't start with kernel modesetting, either automatically or from runlevel 3. X -configure fails. With nomodeset 1024x768 is the only available resolution once logged in to a session. Of note, kdm comes up at the correct resolution with nomodeset but once the X session starts it falls back to 1024x768.\n\n*acpi_osi=Linux is required for the back light keys to function. I see no lasting benefit to having turned it on and off as described in Comment #18 - still doesn't work with it off here.\n\n*Same symptoms booting from the F15 DVD. nomodeset option works at reduced resolution, black screen with default graphical installer.\nSo if your display starts with a blank screen, try decreasing the brightness to check if the screen appears. My display works fine now, but in reverse.\n\nA: Problem solved. Hope it helps someone out there!\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1840959\n\nA: Actually it works with the i915 driver and modesetting activated but there is a little trick to do. The black screen is only due to the fact that for some reason,  the backlight is switched off. I've written the solution here it's in French but you may Google translate it.\nBasically, the black screen is just a side effect but the it boots well, you can see that it is working if you use a torch light and point it to the screen. To switch on the screen you you have to \nsudo setpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=00 \n\nEither by ssh or blindly with a tty and it magically switch on the screen. You have to modify /etc/rc.local to make it permanent at startup. The problem arise when you wake up from sleep as well, so you have to create and edit the file /etc/pm/sleep.d/10_screen_sleepand copy this : \n#!/bin/sh\n# Switch the backlight on after woke up from sleep\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n     resume|thaw)\n        sudo setpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=00\n        ;;\nesac\n\nBy doing so, you will be able to use the driver Intel AND a high resolution.\nHope it helped.\n\nA: Also in http://www.fedoraforum.org/forum/showthread.php?t=247355\nRe: [Acer Aspire 3820T] Fedora 13 brightness issue\nBefore deciding to google the issue (which led me here), I've randomly discovered another solution - brightness value set in sysfs (or just \"set\") will be applied on reboot, so if after boot \"/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\" shows 0 out of 9, setting it to 9 (via \"echo\" or keys) and just rebooting sets max brightness right from the BIOS screens and grub (which are also dim with 0).\nGuess the same effect should also apply to suspend-to-disk (basically the same reboot) and suspend-to-ram, but I haven't tested it.\nNot that it's in any way better than setting brightness on the fly, which works for me with \"acpi_backlight=Linux\" added to cmdline (thanks!), still I thought I'd mention that in case that acpi setting won't work for someone (possibly with another laptop model or kernel).\n\nA: Running Mint 11 on Acer Aspire 5734Z w/ Intel GMA 4500m \nOriginally when trying to install Mint from a live CD I was getting a blacked out screen. The video was there, but I could barely see it. I used “nomodeset” in grub, installed the OS and ended up with the same issue as described above, brightness level was right and video was visible but resolution was distorted and stuck at 1024x768. Changing the grub.cfg to acpi_osi=Linux (as mentioned above ~thank you!) instead of “nomodeset” fixed my resolution and gave me control of my brightness levels, but every reboot required adjusting the brightness level. \nI found this fix for the brightness level reboot issue....\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/752165 (Post #9)\nWhen I added the line of script to the /etc/rc.local file as suggested and rebooted my system there was no need to adjust my brightness settings.. it worked! :) Or it worked until my system went into screensaver/standby mode!

It's not a good practice to share accounts in any case. It's better to share documents and folders between the users. I'm not sure what happens if you share the folder both on Ubuntu One and locally. I don't think it should cause any problems, but you may have to download files even though they're already on disk. You should probably share a test folder first to see how that works. \nRemember that Ubuntu One is also used to login to other websites, so it is a very good idea for everyone to have their own accounts. \n", "Q: How to check if Xvfb is (already) running on display :0?

Normally Ubuntu is so stable!\nI have samba set up on an Ubuntu server (11.04), sharing a directory mounted on a RAID 5 array managed by mdadm. If I access this via a Windows PC, and modify a large number of files quickly (e.g. some bulk edit operation, in this case applying changes to tags of music files), the server becomes completely unresponsive.\nBy that I mean the connection is lost, I can't SSH into or ping it, and pressing keys on the keyboard does nothing (which I can see if I log on locally first; after the lock up the terminal doesn't respond at all).\nI left it for about an hour last time this happened and it didn't get any better, so I had to hard reset it, which I really don't want to do again.

As I have installed the latest version of TeXLive under Ubuntu, I want to be able to use it when running an integrated development environment like KILE.  Though a solution (and fix) was presented on the KILE Support Discussion Group, it involves downloading, compiling and installing the latest version of KILE.\nIn order to compile KILE, I need:\n\n\n*\n\n*KDE Libraries 4.2 or better\n\n*Qt 4.5 or better\n\n*Cmake 2.6.2 or better\n\n*A recent C++ compile, for example GCC 4.4\n\n\nMy problem is that I can't determine what version of the KDE libraries or Qt I have installed on my system.  Note that I am running Ubuntu Version 11.04.\nMy question, however, is whether or not the latest version of KILE (Version 2.1) will be included in the next release of Ubuntu (i.e. Version 11.10).  If so, I could save myself the effort and grief of compiling and installing KILE.  If not, will my installing the latest version affect the Synaptic Package Manager's ability of applying any future releases/updates to KILE?\nAny help/suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nA: According to the source page for kile, 11.04 shipped with 1:2.1.0~svn1112278beta4-2ubuntu2, and 1:2.1.0~svn2010122beta5-1ubuntu1~natty1 is available as a backport.\n11.10 already appears to have 2.1.0 final. \nThis fellow appears to have a PPA of Kile 2.1 so that you don't have to compile it yourself:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~kile/+archive/stable\nYou can find information on how to add and use PPAs here:\n\n\n*\n\n*What are PPAs and how do I use them?\n\n*Are PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some \"red flags\" to watch out for?

You can use the function imagecopyresized instead, but the resulting quality will be worse then. \nDepending on the destination size, you can combine these two, first reduce the pictures size by imagecopyresized half of its size, and use then imagecopyresampled to reduce the size to its final size.

How can I do that?\n\nA: If you set a high(ish) value for either oom_adj or oom_score_adj then they will be killed first. e.g.\necho 15 > /proc/[pid]/oom_adj\n\noom_adj goes from -16 to 15 and as mentioned above oom_score_adj accepts -1000 to 1000\n\nA: We have choom now.\ntl;dr:  choom --adjust -100 myprogram.\nThe man page has more information.\n\nA: Looking into the code is always a good idea. Normally I use the search function of kernel.org, but its currently down. Github does a good job too. I found this:\n\nInstead, a new tunable,\n  /proc/pid/oom_score_adj, is added that ranges from -1000 to +1000.  It may\n  be used to polarize the heuristic such that certain tasks are never\n  considered for oom kill while others may always be considered.  The value\n  is added directly into the badness() score so a value of -500, for\n  example, means to discount 50% of its memory consumption in comparison to\n  other tasks either on the system, bound to the mempolicy, in the cpuset,\n  or sharing the same memory controller.\n\nFrom https://github.com/mirrors/linux-2.6/commit/a63d83f427fbce97a6cea0db2e64b0eb8435cd10#include/linux/oom.h\n\nA: This is an old question. With systemd in recent systems it couldn't be easier.\nAs you prefer, export EDITOR=vim or whatnot, then:\nsystemctl edit mysql.service\n\nand input the two drop-in lines:\n[Service]\nOOMScoreAdjust=-150\n\nsave & exit; done — permanently.\n\nUse systemctl edit --full if you're confused by the concept of config drop-in (just be careful to avoid writing to /usr/lib/systemd/system/*.service as your edits will get destroyed on updates).\n\nDoc: man systemd.exec\n\nOOMScoreAdjust=\nSets the adjustment level for the Out-Of-Memory killer for executed processes. Takes an integer between -1000 (to disable OOM killing for this process) and 1000 (to make killing of this process under memory pressure very likely). See proc.txt[1] for details.\n\n\nA: Based on my own Q&A on Unix&Linux on a similar question.\nAs Stuart pointed out very well in his answer, valid values are integers in the range of -1000 to 1000 for oom_score_adj. The lower the value, the lower the chance that it's going to be killed.\nIt's very inconvenient to have to change this value over and over again once you restart the application. The information is simply lost after the process has terminated. Upstart (the init daemon in Ubuntu), has a nice option for this to configure for daemons to make sure it's set whenever it has (re)started:\n\noom score\n[...] snip [...]\nExample:\n# this application is a \"resource hog\"\noom score 1000\n\nexpect daemon\nrespawn\nexec /usr/bin/leaky-app\n\n\nSo, basically, you can edit the /etc/init/myservice.conf configuration file for the services you like to change, to include a line oom score -1000. I do assume that the services 'pbs' or 'gridengine' you're talking about in your question is Upstart-enabled, otherwise you'll need another way to change this permanently.\n\nA: If you can modify the start script spawning the process that you want to prioritize for oom-killer, add the following to the start script:\necho 1000 > /proc/self/oom_score_adj\n\nThe value is inherited for child processes.\n\nA: The files /proc/<pid>/oom_adj and /proc/<pid>/oom_score_adj adjust the same setting in the kernel and you can modify either one. The difference is that the older interface oom_adj uses more coarse scale from -16 to 15 whereas newer oom_score_adj uses scale from -1000 to 1000.\nYou can verify that both files control the same setting like this (in shell):\n$ cd /proc/$$\n$ grep . oom_*\noom_adj:0\noom_score:0\noom_score_adj:0\n$ echo 500 > oom_score_adj\n$ grep . oom_*\noom_adj:8\noom_score:500\noom_score_adj:500\n$ echo 10 > oom_adj\n$ grep . oom_*\noom_adj:9\noom_score:588\noom_score_adj:588\n\nI used Linux kernel version 5.4.119 which seems to have off-by-one behavior for the older interface. I'm not sure if this intentional or not. The read-only file oom_score returns the actually used value which should be identical to oom_score_adj.\nSetting negative values for either file requires root access so this can be used only to volunteer for killing in case of system running out of memory (OOM).\nThe way oom_score works is checking the actual memory usage of a process and then counting 1000 * memory_usage_of_process / total_usable_memory_in_system + oom_score to get a comparision number for every process. The higher the number you get, the more probable its for OOM Killer to select the given process (in addition to memory usage, the amount of child processes are considered, too). The value of -1000 for oom_score is special because it cannot be selected by OOM Killer no matter the computed value of the above computation. In most cases the resulting value would be negative enough to not be selected in any case.\nAnd you can use either of these to volunteer your shell (script or not) as the volunteer for killing in case system runs out of memory. Note that all new processes launched by a process will inherit the same oom_score_adj value by default so you can basically write a shell script that does\n#!/bin/bash\necho 1000 > /proc/$$/oom_score_adj\nthe-command-that-should-be-killed-if-oom\necho 0 > /proc/$$/oom_score_adj\n\nThat way only the-command-that-should-be-killed-if-oom (and it's subprocesses) will end up with oom_score_adj value 1000 and your script is still using the value 0 after the third line. You can obviously skip the last line if the script doesn't need to do anything after the process exits – in that case you should also use exec to save some RAM by not keeping the shell script alive after starting the process.\n", "Q: Will Unity 2D continue using metacity or will it use compiz?

Think about your use-case, maybe something other than plain AES is better suited.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a password manager like Keyring for passwords\n\n*Encrypt your home directory (very easy to do with the Ubuntu installer)\n\n*Use GPG if you want to communicate securely via email\n\n*OTR with Pidgin if you want secure instant messaging\n\n*Use Cryptocat for secure chat\n\n\n\nIf you want very simple platform independent encryption, you can use openssl.\nPlease note: You can use this to hide birthday-gift-ideas.txt from your roommate, but don't expect it to be secure against a determined attacker!\n\n\n*\n\n*As was pointed out in the comments, this method uses a naive key derivation function, so your password needs to be superlatively good in order for you to have a chance of being secure.\n\n*Additionally, this method doesn't authenticate the ciphertext, which means an attacker can modify or corrupt the contents without you noticing.\n\n*For many types of security, encryption is simply not enough (e.g. you can't just use encryption to communicate securely)\n\n\nIf you still want to use openssl:\n\n\n*\n\n*Encryption:\nopenssl aes-256-cbc -in attack-plan.txt -out message.enc\n\n*Decryption:\nopenssl aes-256-cbc -d -in message.enc -out plain-text.txt\nYou can get openssl to base64-encode the message by using the -a switch on both encryption and decryption. This way, you can paste the ciphertext in an email message, for example. It'll look like this:\nstefano:~$ openssl aes-256-cbc -in attack-plan.txt -a\nenter aes-256-cbc encryption password:\nVerifying - enter aes-256-cbc encryption password:\nU2FsdGVkX192dXI7yHGs/4Ed+xEC3ejXFINKO6Hufnc=\n\nNote that you have a choice of ciphers and modes of operation. For normal use, I recommend aes 256 in CBC mode. These are the ciphers modes you have available (only counting AES):\naes-128-cbc ← this is okay\naes-128-ecb\naes-192-cbc\naes-192-ecb\naes-256-cbc ← this is recommended\naes-256-ecb\n\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm\n\n*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation\nPlease note:\nOpenSSL will ask you for a password. This is not an encryption key, it is not limited to 32 bytes! If you're going to transfer files with someone else, your shared secret should be very strong. You can use this site to get a sense of how good your password is:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm (this doesn't take into account any dictionary attacks!)\n\n*http://howsecureismypassword.net (this at least check for common passwords)\n\n\nWarning: I have checked that these sites don't send your password to the server, but that can change at any time. Use these sites with dev tools / inspector and check if they send anything before typing in your strong password.\n", "Q: Can I reset Unity 2D?

I am willing to buy vaio S series laptop. Can anyone answer my following questions?\n\n\n*\n\n*will Ubuntu 11.10 run smoothly with full hardware compatibility on vaio S series laptop?\n\n*is there ubuntu support for vaio or vaio support for Ubuntu?\n\n*googling on net found that there are some problems running Ubuntu on vaio is that true? if so will I get support from any community?\n\nA: Partial answers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 11.10 is not released yet. It will be released in oktober 2011 (Hence the 11.10). The most current version of Ubuntu is 11.04, however, I can't answer your question for that version.\n\n*I highly doubt Sony offers support for Ubuntu. However, a lot of people who use Ubuntu share whatever problems they have and the solutions they have found and did or didn't work. As far as I know there is no specific support for Vaio laptops.\n\n*There may well be problems, but in my experience, most problems can be fixed. \"Support\" for Ubuntu is provided by Canonical, where you can buy it, and the community, which provides it for free. If you are looking for a solution and you can't find it by Googling, describing your problem properly and asking kindly for a solution here, on a forum such as ubuntuforums.org or in irc (#ubuntu at irc.freenode.net) will often result in someone posting a solution to your problem\n\nA: I've had a Vaio before and at the time, the only problem there was, was with the wireless card not being recognized so not plug and play but there was a rather easy way around it.\nI would suggest you go there with an Ubuntu CD, stick it in, test:\n1) Sound\n2) Wireless\nThese are usually the incompatible stuff, if it works everything else should be easy.\n\nA: I've sony vaio vpcee31fx and i used ubuntu 11.10 on flash memory, except unity all the features was good, but unity was awful, i searched the web and there is a solution to get rid of unity but still have a beautiful environment. Just right now I'm installing it on my laptop and during installation I'm surfing Internet to get to know more about it.\nubuntu 10.04 had some problems with my soundcard but this version has no problem but this version doesn't support my touchpad completely.\n\nA: My best recommendation is to stick Ubuntu 10.10. After upgrading with my VPCS11M9R to 11.10 I experience a lot of error, mistakes, a lot of functionality is raw or just missing, while 10.10 was the best. At the moment I am thinking to roll-back to the previous version.\nWith 11.10:\n1. Bluetooth doesn't work correctly with browsing the mobile phone\n2. suspending often leads to freezing and needs manual re-start\n3. unity panel sometimes doesn't work properly\n4. wimax is not activated bu default, in case of compiling of the stack (see linuxwimax.org) often leads to the buffer overloading and needs re-start of the network-manager\n5. skype is working not good - often freezing\nCanonical supports Ubuntu, but not certain laptop models.

I'm writing a CLI script that asks a series of questions before doing a few things. How can I pass them as arguments so that I don't have to keep entering them every time I want to test my script?\nBasically, it should pass 4 items to STDIN, like \"text1[ENTER]text2[ENTER]text3[ENTER]text4[ENTER]\" automatically.\nYes, I could modify my script to actually read the shell arguments, but I don't want to do it that way, since it's supposed to run more like a wizard.\nLooking for something like\nSOMEPROGRAM myscript arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4\n\nor\nSOMEPROGRAM arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4 | myscript\n\nOr something like that. Is there such a program?\n\nA: I understand you do not want to modify myscript.\nRegarding the second solution you ask for, you can use printf:\nprintf '%s\\n' text1 text2 text3 text4 | myscript\n\nso that, defining an alias for SOMEPROGRAM as:\nalias SOMEPROGRAM=\"printf '%s\\n'\" \n\nyou could effectively call\nSOMEPROGRAM text1 text2 text3 text4 | myscript\n\nThe first form is ambiguous (from the point of view of SOMEPROGRAM), because it don't know where myscript options end and text parameters start, unless myscript is effectively invoked without any options. In this case you could use a function:\nSOMEPROGRAM() {\n  myscript=\"$1\"\n  shift\n  printf '%s\\n' \"$@\" | \"$myscript\"\n}\n\nso that you could effectively call\nSOMEPROGRAM myscript text1 text2 text3 text4\n\n\nA: So basically, you want to pass each argument as a line to a child program. Below is a script that loops through all arguments passed ti SOMEPROGRAM and prints them as a line. You can pass an empty line (\"enter without entering something before\") by passing an empty argument as in SOMEPROGRAM yes '' | myscript.\n#!/bin/bash\n# This is \"SOMEPROGRAM\", it prints each argument as \"answer\" to  a program that\n# must be piped. Usage: SOMEPROGRAM yes 1 no 2 | myscript\nfor arg; do\n    echo \"$arg\"\ndone\n\nIf you always need to answer \"yes\" to your script, use the coreutil yes:\nyes | myscript\n\nIf you need to pass some other value, say \"no\":\nyes 'no' | myscript\n\n\nA: You can pass the parameters, but it won't work, you'll also have to modify the bash script to accept the params from the command-line as well.\n\nA: If you are writing a script then just use getopts so the arguments are passed to the scripts and then you can use those args as you want? Is this something you are looking for? \nhttp://wiki.bash-hackers.org/howto/getopts_tutorial\n\nA: For simple cases, the way enzotib describes it with piping stdin from a file seems reasonable. Consider this script:\n#!/bin/bash\nread -p \"What's your name?\" name \necho $name \nread -p \"Age?\" age \necho $age\necho \"Your name is \" $name \" and your age is \"$age\n\ninvoke it with:\necho -e \"Foobar\\n14\\n\" | ./namenage.sh \n\nThe -e is to enable escape sequences like \\newline. \nFoobar\n14\nYour name is  Foobar  and your age is 14\n\nNote how magically, bash doesn't print the prompt for reading. \nHowever, for more complicated cases, there is a program, called expect to handle interactive CLI programs, where you have to wait for the next prompt, before entering the second value, and I guess you can even branch under conditions. \n\nA: With bash, you can do this:\nmyscript << END\narg1 \narg2\narg3\narg4\nEND\n\nor\nmyscript <<< $'arg1\\narg2\\narg3\\narg4\\\n\n\nA: I'm pretty sure you're looking for expect.\nedit: example added\n  \n#!/bin/bash  \nUSER=\"root\"  \nHOST=\"192.168.1.111\"  \nPASS=\"secret\"  \nexpect -c \"  \nspawn ssh $USER@$HOST  \nexpect \\\"password:\\\"  \nsend \\\"$PASS\\r\\\"  \ninteract  \n\"  \n\n--from this blog\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu contain its own picture/video viewer/player?

And considering the discussions here and at Meta, that probably is a good thing.\n\nA: After searching a bit I came across RatioMaster.NET 0.42 that claims to work under Linux with mono 2.6.3 and hardcoded support for torrent clients uTorrent, BitComet, Azureus, ABC, BitLord, BTuga, BitTornado, Burst, BitTyrant, BitSpirit. So this does not include transmission or deluge but some of these do work native under Linux or work with wine. \nDid not test that program... my ratio on private trackers is more then sufficient ;)\n\nA: Install Azureus and use Greedytorrent with WINE.

Any virtual page can be mapped to any physical page.\n\n*For the most part, yes, the kernel memory is limited to 1 GB, but the page cache can grow larger than that because only a small bit of it must be mapped into the kernel address space at a time.\n\n*Kernel memory is non pagable.\n\n\nNote that this applies to the 32 bit kernel only.\n", "Q: Is it possible to have 32 bit libraries installed on a 64 bit system? I have the 32 bit shared libraries installed, yet I am still getting this error while trying to install pogoplug:\n./pogoplugfs: error while loading shared libraries: libfuse.so.2: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64\n\nIs there something else I need to do to get the program to load from the 32 bit libraries?\nA similar question was asked earlier this year, but was not given any answer.\n\nA: For some libraries, it's possible to have both the 32-bit and 64-bit libraries installed on a 64-bit system. This is available through the ia32-libs package on Ubuntu 10.04 and before. According to the filelist of ia32-libs, there is no libfuse.so.2 file included. That means that you cannot have both architectures installed at a time.\nSince Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric, it's possible for packages to allow simultaneous installation for different architectures which is called \"Multi-Arch\". Unfortunately, if I may believe the filelist of libfuse2 on Oneiric, this package has not been transitioned yet. That can be determined from the package dependencies: if a package depends on multiarch-support (like libdrm2), it has support for multi-arch support. However, this is not a guarantee that the package can be installed for multiple architectures simultaneously.\nTo query your local cache for the multi-arch capabilities of a package, say libc6, run:\napt-cache show libc6 | grep ^Multi-Arch:\n\nFor this command, the output is Multi-Arch: same. That means that both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of a package can be installed at a time. If there is no output, the package is not ready for multi-arch support. Other possible values are foreign (not co-installable, but it can be used to satisfy the dependencies of other architectures) and allowed (iirc, only one package is allowed to be installed at a time, but the package can be used to satisfy dependencies of other packages)\nYou should be able to install 32-bit packages on a 64-bit system with:\nsudo apt-get install packagename:i386\n\nBuilding 32-bit libfuse for 64-bit machines\nSince the 32-bit fuse library is not supplied with ia32-libs, you've no other choice than building it yourself.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the build dependencies for fuse and get the source code:\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs libc6-i386\nsudo apt-get build-dep fuse\napt-get source fuse\n\n\n*Configure the source tree and build fuse (adjust the directory name if needed):\ncd fuse-2.8.4\nCFLAGS=-m32 ./configure --host=i386-linux-gnu\nmake -j 50\n\n\n*Install the 32-bit fuse library (adjust the version accordingly):\nsudo ln -s libfuse.so.2.8.4 /usr/local/lib/libfuse.so.2\nsudo install -m644 lib/.libs/libfuse.so.2.8.4 /usr/local/lib/\n\n\n*Update the linker cache:\nsudo ldconfig\n\n\n*(optional) Remove the source files:\ncd ..\nrm -r fuse-2.8.4\n\n\nA: Yes there is.

I've recorded a video using recordmydesktop, but have unfortunately chosen for capturing the whole screen (1600*896) instead of a small part with geometric 900*690.\nHow do I crop this video? Preferably in the editor I'm using, Kdenlive, to minimize quality loss. I've tried the Crop, Pan & Zoom and Scale0tilt effects, modifying the pixel ratio, movie size inside project settings options without success.

Use the Loose Crop option, then switch back to the Summary tab to see a visual representation of the crop effect. I found it rendered faster than kdenlive using the crop effect as well.\n\n\nA: If nothing else works, you could use mencoder. It is not an interactive editor and will result in re-encoding of the video. If you can live with that, here's how: mencoder -oac pcm -ovc x264 -vf crop=900:690:0:0 -o output.mp4 input.mp4 where the :0:0 part is upper left coordinates of the cropped area. You may want to play around with -oac and -ovc options and see which codecs produce the best results.

I think I understand the instructions given in How to add a directory to the PATH? about adding directories to $PATH. But I don't understand how to add directories to $MANPATH or $INFOPATH.\nAlso -- in googling around for help I have noticed that sometimes directions say export PATH=/usr/share/lib/something:$PATH and sometimes they say export PATH=$PATH:/usr/share/lib/something. Which is it?\n\nA: If your man pages are in /usr/local/myproject/man, all you need to do is add that to (the end of) /etc/manpath.config:\nMANDATORY_MANPATH        /usr/local/myproject/man\n\n\nA: *\n\n*These 2 are almost the same:\nexport PATH=/usr/share/lib/something:$PATH \nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/share/lib/something\n\nThe only difference is that the first one puts the directory to add in front and the second one puts it behind the current directories in $PATH. It only matters if there are commands inside /usr/share/lib/something that have the same name inside one of the directories in $PATH. \n\n*To add directories to $MANPATH or $INFOPATH as required from the link you posted you do that by changing the config files inside the link.\nIt says to open the global version of bash.bashrc with:\nsudo vi /etc/bash.bashrc\n\nand to add at the end:\nPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH; export PATH\nMANPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/doc/man:$MANPATH; export MANPATH\nINFOPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/doc/info:$INFOPATH; export INFOPATH\n\nThis sets $PATH, $MANPATH and $INFOPATH. And it also tells you to edit /etc/manpath.config with:\nsudo vi /etc/manpath.config\n\nand to add \nMANPATH_MAP /usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-linux /usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/doc/man\n\nunderneath # set up PATH to MANPATH mapping.\n\nIf you are unsure about this make a backup 1st (never a bad thing) with:\nsudo cp /etc/bash.bashrc /etc/bash.backup_$(date +\"%Y_%m_%d\").bashrc\nsudo cp /etc/manpath.config /etc/manpath.backup_$(date +\"%Y_%m_%d\").config\n\nThe weird string changes into the current date. If you mess up just copy the backup back over the original file:\n$ touch test1\n$ cp test1 test1.$(date +\"%Y_%m_%d\")\n$ ls\ntest1  test1.2014_11_14  \n\n\nA: \nx:y:z:$PATH or $PATH:x:y:z?\n\nBarely different. $PATH contains a :-separated list of places where bash (the shell/terminal) should check for a program.\nFor example if you type cat the way the terminal understands what that means is to look through the first, second, third elements of $PATH, then save the first location it finds for later invocations of cat.\nIf I have two different versions of a program in two different places, with one of them being preferred, and $PATH tells the shell to search in the wrong order, then there's a problem. Otherwise, no problem.\n\n\nexport\n\nOpen a terminal and type \necho $a\na=5\necho a\necho $a\n\nYou'll see that a=5 set the variable value and $a refers to the variable name, not the value.\nOpen a second terminal and type echo $a. It should again be blank.\nThe difference between export and assignment (=) is explained here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1158091/defining-a-variable-with-or-without-export.\n", "Q: What application is good for note taking using tablets (printable in A4)?

I was wondering if there are plans to add support for purchases in Muon Software Center just like there is in Ubuntu Software Center?\nThat would be handy, and as Muon developer is part of Kubuntu team, I think this makes sense... \nBut does anybody knows whether there are concrete plans?\n\nA: Amusingly both USC and Muon don't use Launchpad for blueprints: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/muon so it's hard to tell directly if there are any plans. Then again the paid for services are offered by the ubuntu-one 'online services' team, so it is probably they and not any other team or project that would have the plan at all.\nAsking on #ubuntuone I found an answer that ubuntuone development has no plans for kubuntu.

My laptop monitor alone displays it fine, but my external monitor does not for some resolution-related reason. \n", "Q: How can I convert an ODT file to a PDF? Does anyone know how to convert an ODT file (LibreOffice) to PDF?\n\nA: Here are a few more details about the \"non-GUI\" method.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use this method not only to convert ODT files to PDF. It will also work for MS Word DOCX files (it will work as well as LibreOffice is able to handle the particular ODT), and, in general all file types which LibreOffice can open.\n\n*I do not think that there is a binary named libreoffice as one of the other answers suggested. However, there is soffice(.bin) -- the binary that can be used to start LibreOffice from the command line. It is usually located in /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/; and very often, a symlink /usr/bin/soffice points to that location.\n\n*Then, in most cases the parameters --headless --convert-to pdf are not sufficient. It needs to be:\n--headless --convert-to pdf:writer_pdf_Export\n\nBe sure to follow exactly this capitalization!\n\n*Next, the command will not work if there is already a LibreOffice GUI instance up and running on your system. It is caused by bug #37531, known since 2011. Add this additional parameter to your command:\n \"-env:UserInstallation=file:///tmp/LibreOffice_Conversion_${USER}\"\n\nThis will create a new, separate environment which can be used by a second, headless LO instance without interfering with a possibly running first GUI LO instance started by the same user.\n\n*Also, make sure that the --outdir /pdf you specify does exist, and that you have write permission to it. Or, rather use a different output dir. Even if it is just for a first testing and debugging round:\n$ mkdir ${HOME}/lo_pdfs\n\n\n*Hence:\n/path/to/soffice                                                     \\\n  --headless                                                         \\\n  \"-env:UserInstallation=file:///tmp/LibreOffice_Conversion_${USER}\" \\\n  --convert-to pdf:writer_pdf_Export                                 \\\n  --outdir ${HOME}/lo_pdfs                                           \\\n/path/to/test.docx\n\nThis works for me on Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 with LibreOffice v5.1.2.2 (using my specific path for the binary soffice which will be different on Ubuntu anyway...). It also works on Debian Jessie 8.0 (using path /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/soffice). Sorry, cannot test it on Ubuntu right now....\nIf all this doesn't work, when you try to process DOCX:\n\n*It may be a problem with the specific DOCX file you try the command with... So create a very simple DOCX document of your own first. Use LibreOffice itself for this. Write \"Hello World!\" on an otherwise empty page. Save it as DOCX.\n\n*Try again. Does it work with the simple DOCX?\n\n*If it again doesn't work, repeat step 7, but save as ODT this time.\n\n*Repeat step 8, but make sure to reference the ODT this time.\n\n*Last: Use full path to soffice, to soffice.bin and to libreoffice and run each with the -h parameter:\n$ /path/to/libreoffice -h  # if that path exists, which I doubt!\n$ /path/to/soffice -h\n$ /path/to/soffice.bin -h\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Do you get an output here?\n\n*For which one of the three binaries/symlinks?\n\n*Record the outputs.\n\n*Tell us your outputs!!!\n  \n\n\nCompare them to the command line you used:\n\n\n*\n\n*Are there any changes in parameter names, capitalizations, number of dashes used, etc.??\n \n\n\nFor comparison, my own (Mac OS X) output is here:\n $ /Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice -h \n\n LibreOffice 5.1.2.2 d3bf12ecb743fc0d20e0be0c58ca359301eb705f\n\n Usage: soffice [options] [documents...]\n\n Options:\n --minimized    keep

--headless --invisible --convert-to pdf --outdir \"$base\" \"$document\" \n    shift\n\ndone\n\nFor installation instructions see here: How can I install a Nautilus script?\n\nA: I'm adding a new answer, because in recent times a series of new conversion paths were opened by Pandoc gaining the capability to read ODT files.\nWhen Pandoc reads in a file format, it converts it into an internal format, \"native\" (which is a form of JSON).\nFrom its native form, it can then export the document into a whole range of other formats. Not only PDF, but also DocBook, HTML, EPUB, DOCX, ASCIIdoc, DokuWiki, MediaWiki and what-not...\nSince here the wanted output format is PDF, we have another choice of different paths, provided by what Pandoc is calling a pdf-engine. Here is the list of currently available PDF engines (valid for Pandoc v2.7.2 and later -- previous versions may support only a smaller list):\n\n\n*\n\n*pdflatex: This requires LaTeX to be installed in addition to Pandoc.\n\n*xelatex: This requires XeLaTeX to be installed in addition to Pandoc (also available as an additional package to general TeX distributions).\n\n*context: This requires ConTeXt to be installed in addition to Pandoc; ConTeXt is available as an additional package to most general TeX distributions).\n\n*lualatex: This requires LuaTeX to be installed in addition to Pandoc (also available as an additional package to general TeX distributions).\n\n*pdfroff: This requires GNU Roff to be installed in addition to Pandoc.\n\n*wkhtml2pdf: This requires wkhtmltopdf to be installed in addition to Pandoc.\n\n*prince: This requires PrinceXML to be installed in addition to Pandoc.\n\n*weasyprint: This requires weasyprint to be installed in addition to Pandoc.\nThere are some more and newer PDF engines now integrated into Pandoc, which I have not yet used myself and which I currently cannot describe in more detail: tectonic and latexmk.\nWARNING: Do not expect that the appearance of your original document will be identical in all the PDF outputs to the print preview or PDF export of the ODT! Pandoc, when converting does not preserve layouts, it preserves the contents and the structure of documents: paragraphs remain paragraphs, emphasized words remain emphasized, headings remain headings, etc. But the overall look can change considerably.\nExample commands\npdflatex:\n pandoc -f odt -o mydoc.pdf mydoc.odt --pdf-engine=pdflatex\n\nXeLaTeX:\n pandoc -f odt -o mydoc.pdf mydoc.odt --pdf-engine=xelatex\n\nLuaLaTeX:\n pandoc -f odt -o mydoc.pdf mydoc.odt --pdf-engine=lualatex\n\nConTeXt:\n pandoc -f odt -o mydoc.pdf mydoc.odt --pdf-engine=context\n\nGNU troff:\n pandoc -f odt -o mydoc.pdf mydoc.odt --pdf-engine=pdfroff\n\nwkhtmltopdf:\n pandoc -f odt -o mydoc.pdf mydoc.odt --pdf-engine=wkhtml2pdf\n\nPrinceXML:\n pandoc -f odt -o mydoc.pdf mydoc.odt --pdf-engine=prince\n\nweasyprint:\n pandoc -f odt -o mydoc.pdf mydoc.odt --pdf-engine=weasyprint\n\nAbove commands are the most basic for the conversion. Depending on the PDF engine you pick, there may be many other options possible to control the appearance of the output PDF file. For example, the following additional parameters may be added to all those paths routing through LaTeX:\n -V geometry:\"paperwidth=23.3cm, paperheight=1000pt, margin=11.2mm, top=2cm\"\n\nwhich will use a custom page size (a bit larger than DIN A4) with margins of 2cm on the top edge and 1.12cm at the other three edges).\n\nA: Note: I decided to delete my answer from this question and to post a modified version of it here when I realised that unoconv doesn't deal with psw files at all well, and doesn't convert them successfully to other formats. There may also be problems with docx and xlsx formats.\n\nHowever, Libreoffice fully supports many file types; full documentation is available at the official site, which details the valid input and output formats.\nYou could use the command-line libreoffice convert utility or unoconv, which is available in the repositories. I find unoconv to be very useful, and it is probably what you want. Even though Takkat has briefly mentioned unoconv, I thought it would be useful to give some more details and a batch conversion one-liner.\nUsing the terminal you could cd to the directory containing your files and then batch convert all of them by running a one-liner like this:\nfor f in *.odt; do unoconv -f pdf \"${f/%pdf/odt}\"; done\n\n(This one-liner is a modification of my translate script featured in this answer.)\nIf you later want to use any other file formats, just substitute the odt and pdf for any other supported input and output formats. You can find the supported formats for a file type by entering unoconv -f odt --show. To convert a single file use, for example, unoconv -f pdf myfile.odt.\nFurther information on and options for the program can be found by entering in terminal man unoconv or by going to the Ubuntu manpages online.\n\nA: You can also use the command-line of libreoffice for your purpose. That gives you the advantage of batch conversion. But single files are also possible. This example converts all ODT files in the current directory to PDF:\nlibreoffice --headless --convert-to pdf *.odt\n\nGet more information on command-line options with:\nman libreoffice\n\n\nA: Another Nautilus Script\nThis very simple and lightweight Nautilus Script uses unoconv to convert selected file(s) compatible with LibreOffice to PDF format:\n#!/bin/sh\n#Nautilus Script to convert selected LibreOffice-compatible file(s) to PDF\n#\nOLDIFS=$IFS\nIFS=\"\n\"\nfor filename in $@; do\nunoconv --doctype=document --format=pdf \"$filename\"\ndone\nIFS=$OLDIFS\n\n", "Q: How to reinstall Ubuntu as part of dual boot?

(grin)\nI found and followed 2nd paragraph in [ Can I expand my /boot without upsetting the system? ].  I'm now going to boot the LiveCD I used to install (64-bit) and trust GParted to move partitions and increase size of sda1 to 1GB (now 100MB).

I have an Ubuntu 11.04 installation. The /home directory is on a partition\nwhich uses the ext4 filesystem. I haven't changed the default configuration so\nthe filesystem is mounted at boot time with the defaults mount option. man mount explains which mount options the option defaults implies:\nrw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and async.\nI noticed that the access time (atime) of a file isn't updated every time I\naccess a file (for example with an editor or cat).\nI looked around in the man page of mount and found the following option:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*relatime: Update inode access times relative to modify or change time. Access time is only updated if the previous access time was earlier than the current modify or change time.\n  \n\nThis is exactly the behaviour which I observe on my system. But the relatime\nmount option is not enabled.\nIs the behaviour described in the description of the relatime mount option the\ndefault behaviour of atime? Does this apply to all filesystems which support\natime?\n\nA: From man mount:\n\nSome of these options could be enabled or disabled by default in the system kernel. To check the current setting see the options in /proc/mounts.\n\ncat /proc/mounts\n\nShows that relatime is an option for almost all filesystem mounted, but I can't say for sure if is a default for every filesystem that supports atime.\n\nA: I had exactly the same problem and tried remounting the filesystem with atime and the relatime.

The target remains the same, in order of the scripts above.\nI am worried, I have tried to find any answer for days and nights. Toshiba does not supply drivers or soft support for linux, marketing of course.\nI only see the device is up by protocols and down phisically, My question is, is it possible to enable  or not shutdown physically the device?,\nbecause in the toshiba model nb255 the wifi is not set up/down bye means of a physical switch, but by means a combination of Fn + F8 (only for windows 7, no one more), Is there one possibility to configure the hot keys in ubuntu? \n\nA: Thank you for your wealthy help.\nNow, I have solved this issue by using the following. We most agree that is a temporal method while we haven't a final solution:\nThe machine is Toshiba NB255-SP1002M, 32 bits, originally with Windows 7 starter in Spanish. In this machine you can up the wireless device (AR9285) ONLY via software (no via hardware exist) by pressing Fn + F8. This profile is managed by means a Toshiba support utility named TVAP Toshiba Value Added Package (versionv1.3.6; 04-09-2010; 44.36M).\nNormally, by shutting down the wireless device (with Fn + F8) we save charge in the battery; so in some time I turned off the device. After I booted the machine and then I installed Linux Ubuntu 11.04 Natty N. Finally, it is when I saw the abnormally that you say me in order to my initial question above, because I understand you when you said me if I had accidentally shut it down.\nI discovered that at the time there is not an utility in Linux for  a TVAP (unfortunately, TVAP exists only for Windows platform, as far as I know). So, the solution was to recover Windows 7: I made a little partition (20 GigaBytes) so I installed it. I downloaded the TVAP utility in www.toshiba .com and installed it. Then I have a principal partition for Ubuntu 11.04 and secondary partition for Windows 7. Now, I am able to turn on and of the AR9285 in the Windows 7, so I finally turn it on. Next, I restarted to Ubuntu and I fortunately I have:\nroot@zorrillo:~# \nroot@zorrillo:~# rfkill list\n0: phy0: Wireless LAN\n    Soft blocked: no\n    Hard blocked: no\nroot@zorrillo:~# \nroot@zorrillo:~# lshw -class network\n  *-network\n       description: Wireless interface\n       product: AR9285 Wireless Network Adapter (PCI-Express)\n       vendor: Atheros Communications Inc.\n       physical id: 0\n       bus info: pci@0000:07:00.0\n       logical name: wlan0\n       version: 01\n       serial: 00:26:4d:c3:d0:44\n       width: 64 bits\n       clock: 33MHz\n       capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless\n       configuration: broadcast=yes driver=ath9k ip=192.168.0.10 latency=0\n       multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11bgn\n       resources: irq:17 memory:f0100000-f010ffff\nBefore, I had the parameter *-network DISABLED  in the last command. Note, now we can see that the \"DISABLED\" word does not already exist.\nThe only manner to manage the AR9285 in Ubuntu via hardware is by playing whit the BIOS utility when restart the machine. It could be annoying, remember it is provisional for me while TVAP does not exist for linux. Unfortunately, I am not software developer for support this weakness. I advert I have proved whit UBUNTU 11.04 and 10.04 LTS and for both, It is the one manner that I have know now.\nIt is not uncomfortable for me. Really the Windows 7 is encapsulated in a little space of 20 Gigabytes; and meanwhile I have available 220 Gigabytes for linux, so what's the problem?\nYo maybe decide to erase Windows 7 (once you have turn on the wireless device with the windows TVAP utility, if you want you can write erase of your hard disk), however I prefer remain the Windows 7 for any similar problem.\nSo, the next challenge is to create the TVAP utility in linux platform; maybe it is necessary to apply inverse engineering at the TVAP Toshiba Value Added Package. So, who will be the valient? hahaha. However I'll try.\nThanks guys, a salute from Coatzacoalcos, México.\n\nA: The wifi card is hard-blocked - this could either be a kernel issue or if you had accidentally/abnormally shutdown the machine, you just need to remove the rfkill blocking device i.e.\nsudo rm /dev/rfkill\n\nThen reboot.\nIf this doesnt work - please add to your question the output of sudo lshw -class network\n", "Q: Should I Upgrade Or Fresh Installation? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs a clean install better than upgrading? \n\nUbuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot) will be out soon.

It's a panel applet you can add to your bottom panel in place of your window list, and it should be able to duplicate all this functionality for you. (Also, to make the icons bigger, just increase the size of the panel then.)\nYou could also try removing the bottom panel and replacing it with Docky in panel mode, but then you won't get previews.

In that case libraries will end up in /usr/lib/ (Libraries for the binaries in /usr/bin/ and /usr/sbin/.) and the executable in /bin (Essential command binaries that need to be available in single user mode; for all users, e.g., cat, ls, cp), /usr/bin or /usr/sbin (Non-essential command binaries (not needed in single user mode); for all users).\nSome other important directories are /opt and /usr/local/share.\n/opt: Optional application software packages. Jasperserver (a stand-alone and embeddable reporting server) for instance installs into /opt.\n/usr/local is for data that must be stored on the local host and is used for installing software/data that are not part of the standard operating system distribution. In this directory you will find lib for libraries en bin for executables.\nYou can use system settings, main menu to browse for executables. Or from command line with locate. Or inside Ubuntu Software Center you can browse all the files that are used for a package. Examples using locate and libreoffice:\nlocate libreoffice|grep bin\n\nwill show /usr/bin/libreoffice. \nSidenote: Eclipse is in the software center so no need to download a zip (unless you want the newest version and not the most stable one):\n\n", "Q: How to host a tiny RESTful application written in Java/C#/Python? I want to write a tiny RESTful server in some language that can run on Ubuntu 10.04, \nbut I have no idea how to host it. \nCurrently I have a VPS at Linode.com (Disclaimer: referral code) with nginx, I might have Apache running as well but not configured correctly, running that serves some public websites (Wordpress). \nDoes that mean port 80 is taken? How should I host my application to be able to handle urls like http://myip/User/Zolomon for instance?   \nDo I have to communicate with nginx in some way, since I suppose it's what handles the URL?\n\nA: You'll first need to find out if port 80 is taken. Likely, given that you're running NGINX (and maybe Apache), port 80 is already used on this machine. You can find out quite easily by running netstat the following snippet will give you just a list of the ports currently in use on your server.\nnetstat -lnt | grep -v tcp6 | awk '{ print $4 }' | awk -F':' '{ print $2 }' | sort -n\n\nShould produce something like this:\n22\n25\n53\n80\n631\n1337\n\nWithout knowing exactly how you're written this RESTful application it'll be hard to say how you should hook it up. If it comes bundled with it's own standalone webserver, or if you're using something like Tomcat, C# WebServer, or Cherrpy; then you will need to configure the application to use a port other than the ones listed in the output from the command. Some popular alternative web ports are 8080, 8081, and most values in the 9000 range. Once you change that port in your Applications configuration and launch it, you'll be able to access it at http://youip:PORT/User/Zolomon where PORT is the number you chose.\nIf this is an application that needs Web Server software to be installed, you'll need to setup a Virtual Host definition in either NGINX or Apache (whichever you're using) so that the Application will be run when you access it via http://youip/User/Zolomon but setting up the specifics for that seem to be out of scope for the question you've asked.\n"]
