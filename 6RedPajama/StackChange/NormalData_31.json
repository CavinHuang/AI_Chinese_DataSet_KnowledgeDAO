["Q: Accuracy of wireless quality indicator Wireless networks listed in the dropdown menu from the menu bar have a quality indicator, shown by the number of \"bars\" in their icon (1-4).  On my 2012 MacBook Pro, this indicator seems to be 3 bars even for networks that cannot be used because they are too distant.  Even some 4 bar networks are unusable because of poor reception quality.\nIs this normal?  Is there a way to adjust this so that the number of bars corresponds in a useful way to the quality of the service?\n\nA: 4 bars = 100% signal\n3 bars = 75% signal\n2 bars = 50% signal\n1 bar = 25% signal\nWhy is it that you have signals with 4 bars and you can not connect could be other problem than signal strength.\nI use the RSSI (received signal strength indication) as indicator, and the Noise as second indicator on signals that show >50%. With those 2 values one can decide if the WiFi is worthwhile.\nThe most telling number is the Transmit rate, that shows how high is the actual data transfer.\n\nIn this example one has 4 bars signal, but it is not useable, due to to very high noise and RSSI.\nThe most telling number is the Transmit rate, that shows how high is the actual data transfer rate.\nIf you hold the ALT key while clicking on the WiFi icon you will see the additional information on the currently connected network. Look at the Transmit rate, the higher the better ie >100 (It is the speed of data transfer).\nMac has more detailed Network analysis tools. In the Spotlight type Network Utility to find  it.\n", "Q: Safari keyboard shortcut for iCloud tabs? Is there a keyboard shortcut for the iCloud tabs in Safari (7.0.5)? So far I have to click on the cloud button to view iCloud tabs.\n\nA: In Safari 6 or newer, ShiftCmd\\ or a two finger pinch invokes the \"Tab View\" which includes iCloud tabs.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202525\n", "Q: iPhone using data despite per-app cellular data being disabled My iPhone 5 with iOS 7 is using data for no reason. I have done everything I can think of to stop this.\n\nTurn off your wifi, then reset your cellular network statistics, let it sit for 5 minutes, then go back to the cellular pane in settings and see whats using the connection\n\nSource: http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/22tqhd/what_is_the_spinning_wheel_next_to_the_wifi/\nHere are my test results. This seemed like a good idea so I did it. I was extra thorough and did it for 2 hours. During the 2 hours I waited it did not stop at all. \n\nHere is everything I have turned off. \n\nHere is my usage. \n\nI have turned off Background App Refresh. I have also closed all my apps. \nWhat else can I try? \n\nA: You need to also turn off background updates, which is where the bulk of the data usage is likely occurring.\nSettings> General > Background App Refresh > Background App Refresh Off. Of course, you can choose which apps you wish to turn off individually for background refresh instead.\nDon't forget that if you are worried about cell data usage, you can also put your phone in Airplane mode, which turns off all radios, but then manually turn on Wifi. This will force your phone to use only Wifi, as the cell radios are off. Simply turn off Airplane mode when you wish to use the cell radio again.\n\nA: Going off that Reddit post more than your question but...\nBefore reading Apple's documentation I always assumed the spinning wheel was started and stopped by the operating system whenever there is network activity. But that isn't the case. It is up to app developers to choose to start and stop it by setting the networkActivityIndicatorVisible to YES to start it and then NO to stop it.\nSo, in theory, seeing that activity indicator might not actually mean there is network activity. It could be that an application has started it but for some reason not stopped it.\nIf the perceived problem is that the activity indicator is spinning constantly, the only way I can think to test this is to turn the phone off completely, then turn it back on and see whether the activity indicator has started again. If it stays quiet or only appears sporadically my guess would be that it appearing constantly is because an application started it but failed to stop it.\n\nA: If you want your phone to use NO cellular data, including push notifications, go to Settings -> Cellular and turn Cellular Data to OFF. That should allow you to make and receive phone calls and SMS messages (although iMessage will be disabled).\n", "Q: Old GarageBand had a legit drum roll; can't find it in 10.0 I've written quite a few tunes with older versions of GarageBand, and I always use the MIDI editor / piano roll (or whatever that note-by-note editor is called) for creating drum tracks. In the older versions of GarageBand, there was a legitimate, real, snare drum roll. It was a plain old regular note in the MIDI editor, just like a regular snare hit or bass kick. But I can't find any such thing in GarageBand 10.0. When I google for how to make a drum roll, all I see is people cramming together regular snare hits, which sounds ugly and electronic to me. For an example of what I'm talking about, listen to my tune here, at about 2:40 and 2:45. I used rolls like these throughout the tune, but these two are longer and more noticeable.\nDoes anyone know how to do this in GB 10.0?\n\nA: If you go to “Orchestral > Percussion > Orchestral Kit” and go to C0 and hit H you’ll get a good drum roll. I found it by going down and holding down each key until I found it.\n\nA: I know exactly what you are talking about.  It took me some time to find, but it is in there.  Snare drum roll is in \"Orchestra Kit\".  The note is A0.  Took me time to find because my piano controller only went down to C1.  \n", "Q: A window manager that re-sizes and re-arranges ALL the windows for a given application with one keyboard shortcut? I have done research on Ask Different to see if this has been posted and to the best of my knowledge nothing this specific. I reviewed this but that question is more general. \nSo imagine that I have 10 (or more) Evernote windows and I want, with one shortcut,  for all of them to be resized to half the monitor to the left. And then I have 6 terminal windows and want them all resized to a quarter screen to the upper right (different shortcut). \nPS: What I currently use is SizeUp and it works great BUT in the case of the 10 Evernote windows, I'd have to use the keyboard shortcut 10 times.\n\nA: After testing Stay, I think it does what you want. Just launch your desired apps and store all open windows. You can then restore them on Stay's menu bar icon, with a shortcut key or have them restored automatically, when you launch each of the apps in question, or change displays.\nI emailed Matt, Stay's dev and this is what he had to say about automatic restoration when launching apps and window title pattern matching:\n\nStay does indeed have an option to restore windows when launching apps. It’s the checkbox labelled \"Restore Windows as applications are launched” in Stay’s preferences window.\nStay does its best to restore windows that it hasn’t seen before, but which are similar to windows that have been stored in Stay. When you store a window in Stay, it actually stores a set of attributes that it can use to identify that window, rather than a reference to the specific window that’s being stored. So if Stay sees another window that has the same identifying attributes, it will restore that window with the same size and position.\nThere are situations where this approach doesn’t actually work all that well in practice though, and as such, Stay has a feature designed to help with this called window title pattern matching. There’s documentation on this feature available here:\nhttp://cordlessdog.com/stay/documentation/window-title-pattern-matching\nThe basic gist of it is that you can control how Stay identifies your windows by telling it how to identify windows by their titles. The simplest use case is to set a pattern of .* (period asterisk) on a stored window, which will make that stored window match all of an application’s windows.\n\n\nA: You could also use AppleScripts like this:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set b to bounds of window of desktop\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell windows of process \"Terminal\"\n    set position to {(item 3 of b) / 2, 0}\n    set size to {(item 3 of b) / 2, (item 4 of b) / 2}\nend tell\n\nYou can assign shortcuts to scripts with FastScripts, Alfred, or Karabiner.\n", "Q: CTRL + CMD + SPACE brings up Characters window instead of Emoji window I'm in Mavericks. When using messages to chat with someone, I used to be able to press CTRL + CMD + SPACE and a little Emoji window would popup and I could choose from an Emoji or type the name of an Emoji to filter the window.\nA few days ago, something changed. I don't know what. Now, when I pretty CTRL + CMD + SPACE, a separate \"Characters\" window pops up in the middle of the screen. It contains Emojis along with hundreds of other type of special characters. It's WAY slower than the emoji window and you can't type the name of emoji's immediately without first clicking into the search field. Anyways, its way worse than it was before.\nHow do I get the little Emoji window back in Messages? What did I do to change this?\n\nA: I think you just need to Collapse the Character Viewer by clicking the button next to the search field.\n\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/PH13867\n", "Q: How can I find my lost iPhone 5c? I lost my iPhone 5c in Gypsom, Colorado and am pretty sure it has 50% or more of battery remaining. \nHow can i locate it?\n\nA: If you have Find My iPhone enabled on the device, go to icloud.com and see if the device is online.

My phone wasn't wanting to update but eventually did but they ordered me a replacement phone long story.\nAll my apps and pictures came up on my phone and some loaded but I didn't have time to wait on all them to load. They said when you get around Wi-Fi just resume the download. With my job I haven't been around Wi-Fi. Yesterday I noticed some of my apps are missing off my phone. What may have happened?\n\nA: there could be a couple things off the top of my head.\n\n\n*\n\n*resume download has been iffy for me.  but go into the app store and go to the purchased history and all your previous apps will be in there.  you'll just have to download them and rearrange to how you like them.\n\n*but consider those may no longer compatible with the new ios version?  doesn't sound like it from how you described it but...\n\n\nA: You mention that you've had a replacement phone and therefore presume you're restoring an iCloud backup. If this backup is interrupted, next time the device connects to Wi-Fi the device will prompt you to continue the restoring. If you cancel this, the restore is cancelled. To continue the restore, you will have to start the restore process again by erasing your content and restoring from the iCloud backup.\n", "Q: Quick way to Print Multiple Emails Using Mail.app, or exporting from same, is there a quick way to print all the emails from a single folder?\nI have about 50 email messages in a folder and I need to print a copy of each one.  I know I could \n\n\n*\n\n*Open each email\n\n*Print it\n\n*Remove it from the tray (to conform it printing)\n\n*Repeat 50 times\n\n\nThat, however, seems super time consuming. I'd rather be able to \n\n\n*\n\n*Somehow combine all the emails into a single document\n\n*Print that\n\n*Walk away\n\n\nI know I can export to mbox, but I don't know of anyway to view a unified mbox as a single logical document (dealing with a combination of plain text, HTML formated, multi-part, attachments, etc)\n\nA: I tried your request:\nI selected 50 emails, then choose Print under File Tab.\nIt took some time to generate the print files, but then it showed me print preview for 50 emails.\n\nWithout proceeding (do not want to waist my toner), I see there is no problem in printing 50 emails all at once.\n", "Q: Apple Mail marks email as read This is very annoying and makes me miss important email. After receiving an email, it's marked as read by the Mavericks Mail App. Anyone bumped into the same issue? Any ideas?\n\nA: I had/have the same issue.  With IMAP email server, if you have another computer, or phone, etc.  checking mail from the same server it marks it as read in Mail.   Change your settings (or remake a profile) to POP instead of IMAP.  Solved for me.\n\nA: I was having the same problems with OS11 (Big Sur). All of my mail for 1 account was coming in as read and I was missing important messages.

I have been iMessaging with them for years, they are family and all have iPhones and haven't changed anything with their carriers, usage, etc.  All of a sudden I got the Not Delivered Message.  Can anyone help me figure this out?\n\nA: It's hard to figure out what's the actual problem without more information or being at the scene. Some simple fixes you may try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your iPad.\n\n*Make sure you are not in airplane mode.\n\n*Make sure you have interact connection. You can test by browsing a webpage.\n\n*Go to 'Contact's and double check if their phone numbers (including country code) and/or apple id emails are correct.\n\n*Test whether you can message others.

Most of them will open your search in a new tab.\nDoes Safari support this, and what's the key combo?\n\nA: There IS a way - in Safari Version 10.0.3 at least.\nType a slash (\"/\") after the domain name. As in,\nsemiconducted/<enter>\n\nwill resolve to www.semiconducted.com\nVoila!\nFound at:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4032903\n\nA: Safari 8.0 does: Press and hold the Control key for a moment while you’re editing the location and you’ll see the search icon turn into an icon indicating that it’s interpreting the input as (part of) a URL instead of performing a search. The label “Search selected search engine” next to your text will change to “Go to Site” and the ‘Go to Site “your text”’ menu item in the completions list will be selected. Typing Control+Return will navigate there.\nBy the way, you can use Control+N (next) and Control+P (previous) to navigate through the completions list using the keyboard. (These are emacs-style navigation key bindings.)\n\nA: Safari doesn't support this out of the box.\nYou can do this with Keyboard Maestro using a macro such as this:\n\n\nA: There are many ways to do this. \n\n\n*\n\n*You can of course use AutoHotKey(ahk) to define any key combo and mapping you want, which can be used in any text-editing environment, not necessarily in a url bar. So this is an overkill. (Other hotkey apps also work.)\n\n*Similar to Internet Explorer(or maybe Chrome, Firefox?), Safari also uses ctrl+enter(or return) as a shortcut to navigate to a website, which is illustrated in Chris Page's answer. However, a slight difference is that, in Safari, you have to hold the ctrl key for a moment(as mentioned in Chris Page's answer), while in Internet Explorer, you can simply hit ctrl+enter immediately after you type the address name, say, you type 'nba' in url bar, then hit ctrl+enter(no pause is needed), it will automatically navigate to www.nba.com . In fact, this shortcut can be found in Internet Explorer's help document.\n\nA: I'm using macOS Monterey ver. 12.5\nUsing the forward slash \\ after the name of the site seems to work:\nCmd+\\+Enter will result in https://www.apple.com/\nIf you press Shift+Enter, it will open a new window and go to the site.\n", "Q: iMac 14,1 won't Netboot from Deploy Studio server running OS 10.8 A little background, we have a lot of iMacs at my organization, different models.  We have about 5 different servers running Deploy Studio.  \nI have found that any of the 14,1 iMacs (late 2013) will only net boot to DS servers that are running OS 10.9+, if I attempt to net boot from a server running OS 10.8.5, using the same image that is hosted on the other servers, the unit will not net boot.  The unit stays at the Startup Manager for a few seconds, seemingly frozen, then Apple logo spinning gear, boots to login window of internal HD.\nI have read that the TFTP protocol has changed, could this be the reason for the discrepancy of net booting from the same image on different Deploy Studio servers?\n\nA: This was eventually resolved.  We discovered that with Mavericks we could not netboot across subnets, which we previously had no issues with, so it seems to be unrelated to Deploy Studio or model.\nAlso learned that the TFTP protocol change is only relevant during netboot if you get the prohibited sign during boot, which we did not get.\n", "Q: iOS Sync Device Name I have set up Google sync on my all my devices as I use the iOS Chrome app. When using the Chrome app I click on 'other devices' and my iMac device name shows up as iMac-2. I was wondering if it's possible to somehow rename/change my iMac device name. I've tried unlinking my iMac and linking it back up again but nothing has worked so far. I know it's only a small issue but it's bugging me.\n\nA: The other devices list on Chrome uses the name of the Mac given to it, or the DCHP if that fails. To change the name of the Mac, go to System Preferences → Sharing and enter your desired name in the box at the top. You may need to log out and back in for Chrome on OS X to update the name.\n", "Q: iPhone 5 no phone services I am unable to dial out receive calls or text messages. \nHow can I fix the problem? \nI've tried shutting it down waiting awhile then turning it back on and the phone still shows \"searching\".\n\nA: If you have no phone service check following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable Airplane mode (if it is enabled)\n\n*Check that your SIM card is inserted properly.\n\n*Check if you see your phone service provider name.\n", "Q: Retina MacBook Pro - Quad core vs. Dual core and virtual machines (VMware Fusion) I am looking to get a Retina MacBook Pro and I am really torn between the portability of the 13\" dual core i7 and the four cores of the 15\" quad core i7. The majority of my work will be done using a virtual machine (VMWare Fusion). For this reason no matter which machine I choose I will be going with an SSD and 16 GB RAM. Also, I'm not really concerned with price as I really want to get the best performance. Portability vs. performance is my biggest concern. This laptop will serve as my dedicated workstation.\nThough I would prefer the smaller form factor of the 13\" Retina MBP I am concerned that the dual core i7 might not be fast enough to handle multiple virtual machines running at the same time. Within the virtual machines I will be running Windows 8, SQL Server, Visual Studio 2013, and IIS. \nDoes anyone know just how much difference the quad core would make as compared to the dual core as it pertains to running virtual machines? Also, dies the dedicated 2 GB graphics card available on the 15\" come into play at all when dealing with virtual machines?\n\nA: I would say that will depend on your work. If performance is of the essence, go with the 15\" model. You're also going to appreciate the extra screen estate when having documentation and your code side by side. \nGraphics however, play little role when it comes to virtualization especially when you don't run any graphics-intensive apps. \n", "Q: How can I take 120 fps video on iPhone 5s without slow-mo? How can I take 120 fps videos by iPhone 5S without using slow motion feature ?\n\nA: \"Slow motion\" is a application name for recording at 120 frames per second.\nRecording at 120 fps requires that software feature enabled.\nPlayback speed is your choice, slow motion or not.\n\nA: Shooting at \"slow motion\" is shooting 120 frames per second realtime. If you playback the resulting video at 120fps, you will see it in realtime. The \"Slow motion\" is a post-recording playback feature that slows the 120fps video down to 30fps. So recording \"slow motion\" is indeed giving you true 120fps video.\n\nA: You can first take videos with the slow motion feature then edit the video.Just scroll the blue line towards the another blue line then it will be just a normal video and not a slow motion video.\n", "Q: Can I backup my MacBook Pro onto my Dell Laptop? I've used 40 GB of space on my MacBook Pro, and I want to back it up. The only thing I have with enough space is my Dell laptop (500 GB). Is there any way I can back it up onto there? If so, how?\n\nA: Another alternative is to spend < $100US to purchase a external USB HD (Western Digital, Seagate, and LaCie make good drives,) and use Time Machine to back it up. Time Machine is a very handy and reliable method to backup your entire Mac.\n\nA: CrashPlan by Code42 supports backing up data between different operating systems running on local computers:\n\nDust off that old computer. It doesn’t even matter which operating system it uses. Install CrashPlan on both computers. Make sure to use the same email address. Your other computers will show up in “Computers” under “Destinations.” Select computer you want to back up. Click “Start Backup.” You’re on your way.\n\n\nA: On the Microsoft website there is some information about moving data from a mac to a windows PC: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2636421\n\nA: You can configure your Dell computer to share a specific directory to a network. There are plenty of articles about sharing files between Windows and Mac.\nOnce sharing is set up, you can configure Time Machine to backup to your Windows computer.\nI would recommend connecting both computers via an ethernet cable, so that backing up would be faster.\n", "Q: How do I AirPlay mirror my iPhone screen to my MacBook Pro? I am using a 13 inch Retina MacBook Pro with Mavericks and a iPhone 5s with iOS 7.\nI want to record game tutorials. Where the game is running on my iOS device and I'm recording the tutorial via a screen capture of an AirPlay on my MacBook Pro.\nAfter searching apps from the App Store, I found that there is no apps to record your screen and the only way is through AirPlay on your Mac or Apple TV. \nIs there any free and legal way to do do?\nI have tried a trial of X mirage and it is just what I wanted, but it cost money. I want to record my iPhone. \nNote that I do not have any other apple devices.\n\nA: An app which works great for me is Reflector. Its not free, but there is an unrestricted 7-day trial for you to experiment with. You can use the free Quicktime Player on your Mac to record a video of the screen (or a selected portion thereof) of the iDevice, once Reflector is displaying it on the screen.\nI use this combination all the time.\n\nA: You can do as others have suggested and download another piece of (paid) software for your Mac, or simply hang tight until iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite come out, at which point (assuming Apple maintains the feature) the QuickTime Screen Recording function will work on an iOS 8 device connected to the computer via USB. \nIn addition, a service called iRec should allow you to do what you want (without the use of a computer) once it is released later this year. \n\nA: *\n\n*Download and install iTools Pro on your Mac.\n\n*Connect your Mac and iPhone to same network.\n\n*Click on Airplayer button from iTools's windows.\n\n*Wait for Airplayer to be downloaded.\n\n*Connect to Airplayer through Airplay from your iPhone.

Here is the link to a tutorial:\nhttp://www.labnol.org/software/quicktime-ios-screen-recorder/8375/\nThis way you don't need reflector and the quality is even better.\n\nA: Use QuickTime Player (which is pre-installed on OS X)\n\nA: Use Shou screen recorder, no need jailbreak, download from https://shou.tv/ios\n", "Q: Where do I find an iPhone 4's MEID (ebay purchase)? I'm looking to buy and repair an iPhone 4 from eBay, however the seller hasn't stated the status of the MEID.

Is this also true for the iPhone 4?\nUpdate: The phone doesn't turn on and it does not have the sim tray. Is there any other way to find out the MEID number?\n\nA: The MEID number (the first 14 digits of the IMEI number) is inscribed on the SIM tray on iPhone 4 phones.\nIt is also available in Settings -> General -> About as \"IMEI\" (just ignore the last digit).\nMore information including photos here: iOS: How to find the serial number, IMEI, MEID, CDN, and ICCID number.\n", "Q: Will deleting photos from the Camera Roll also delete them from albums? If I created a new album and placed the photos I wanted in it. If I delete them from photo stream & my camera roll will they be deleted from the new album as well? \n\nA: Yes, photos are not copied to the albums, just referenced, so if you delete the photo that the album references the photo from then the photo will be deleted from the album too.\n\nA: Yes, photos in albums are basically like shortcuts or aliases if you will, to photos in the camera roll that you can organize into certain categories of your choice.\n", "Q: iOS Mail automatically switching account, depending on recipient My Mail app switches from my iCloud account to Gmail when sending an Email to a Gmail contact. How can I disable this?\n\nA: You are probably replying to the message from inside your gmail inbox which will use the gmail account as the sending authority since the email was sent to this account in the first place. The error therefor isn't with the mail.app it is with the way that your emails are sent to you.\nIf you want to change the address in which you send your email from just tap on your gmail address and switch it to your iCloud address. \nIf you don't want to have the automatic reply address to be your gmail one I suggest not using the address to receive emails to.\nAll that mail.app can do for default address is to ensure that your iCloud account is the address that is used when you compose a new email.\n", "Q: Recover Yahoo password that's stored on my Mac I forgot the password to an old Yahoo account as well as the answers to my security questions.  When I try to recover it using keychain, I only find a very long series of letters and numbers that is not the password (I would never come up with that, and even when I try to use it to open my account, it doesn't work).\nNow, I don't rely care about the account any more, but the funny thing is that I can still log in on Yahoo messenger from my Mac, which means that the password IS saved somewhere in the machine. \nAny idea how I can recover the password itself if it's not in the keychain?\n\nA: Actually, the password may not be stored on your Mac since most log in services use the password to generate a cryptographically strong (or at least significantly longer) string that acts as a \"cookie\" to authenticate your client to access the servers that hold your yahoo content.\nUnless you used a different program than Keychain to store the original password itself, you have checked the primary source of saved passwords on OS X and might not be able to recover the original password.\n\nA: Depending on the browser you're using, the password may be stored in its data structures.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Safari - Go to Preferences > Passwords tab \n\n*Google Chrome - Go to Preferences > Settings > Show Advanced Settings... link > Passwords and forms > Manage Passwords link\n\n*Mozilla Firefox - Go to Preferences > Security tab > Saved Passwords button\n\n", "Q: Can't log in to Apple Developer to enroll Today I opened new Apple account for enrolling Apple Developer Program for iOS as an individual developer.

( Yes brand new one, it seems that they got some old phones stored of different brands and models. )\nThe problem is that this iPhone won't charge by any possible way:\n\n\n*\n\n*What happens when I connect it to the charger:  The red charging icon appears then iPhone starts up till the activation screen appears, the top right battery icon appears as charging for the 1st time and after a few seconds it appears as fully charged.\n\n*As soon as I remove it from the wall charger it turns off.\n\n*Connecting  with my pc/mac won't make it  turn on. ( not enough power)\n\n*I'm stuck at the activation screen due to the previous two points.\n\n\nI went to the vodafone customer care and they told me they can't repair or replace it by the same model but I can  return the phone and can get my money back.\nHowever, I love this classic phone and I want to keep it.\nSo my question is do you think that battery is dead because of being stored for more than 4 years or can it be something wrong with the iPhone charging circuit?\nIn this first case I can take the risk and pay for the new battery but I won't open the phone in the second case and I will return it.\n\nA: Apple does offer a one year warranty, so if you are the first buyer, you should be able to register and get them to replace the battery for free. I don't know exactly when they discontinued selling that model, but start with trying to register that device to you at support.apple.com using the serial number from the box. You might need to call into support or fax them the receipt since it's so far past when they were expecting to enroll new owners, but once you know if Apple can/will service it, you can decide to repair it through them or on your own.\nIt's likely the lithium battery has failed permanently due to not being stored for long term with 50% charge. I typically get out my old devices once a year and charge then to 50% and then power it off. If the voltage drops too low then you will need to replace the battery as it will never charge or even hold but a fraction of the intended energy.\nThe customer care has given you good advice and it's great that they offered you the money back. I would say if you are happy with the price, look at repairing the battery yourself. That design was very easy to self-service - especially if you realize it's unique and will take your time with the service.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPhone+3GS+Battery+Replacement/1545\nThe parts should be readily available and the tools are inexpensive. Older phones (original) and newer phones are much harder to replace the battery due to tools or design of the connectors and internals. I'd say keep the phone unless you really can't afford the replacement cost of the battery.\n", "Q: How to run Say \"something\" in background in AppleScript I would like to have AppleScript code like this:\nrow 1\nsay \"some long text here\"\nrow 3\n\nWhen it starts to speak text, it same time continues to row 3.\nI create my scripts in AppleScript Editor and i don't know enough about process control on OS X to understand backgrounding yet.\n\nA: Like this\nsay \"some long text here\" without waiting until completion\n\n\nA: You can do this by getting Terminal to run the line of AppleScript:\nset myscript to \"say \\\"some long text here\\\"\"\nignoring application responses\n  tell application \"Terminal\"\n    do script \"osascript -e \" & quoted form of myscript\n  end tell\nend ignoring\n\n", "Q: Empty space in the place of icons in Finder I see empty spaces in Finder on OS X 10.9.4, exactly as on the picture.

I have Photo Stream set up and my pictures show up in iPhoto on my Mac.  Do I have to import them to keep them permanently?  How can I free up iCloud space?\n\nA: \"My Photo Stream\" does not consume space in your iCloud account storage quota so deleting photos from Photo Stream will not free up iCloud storage space. \nIf Photos.app has \"My Photo Stream\" turned on in the iCloud preferences, any photos that any device adds to \"My Photo Stream\" will get automatically imported into the Photos.app library on your Mac. They do not have to be manually imported. \nIn recent (2017) versions of Photos.app, individual images can be selected and deleted from \"My Photo Stream\", but be careful when deleting things. Photos deleted from \"My Photo Stream\" MAY also be removed from the local library on the device (depending on exactly how they were deleted: delete key; menu items; contextual menu; etc.), but they will not be removed from any other devices that have imported the images into their local library (which happens automatically with Photos.app on the Mac). Photos that were removed from the local library can be recovered from the \"Recently Deleted\" folder on the device, and are not added back to \"My Photo Stream\". Note that the photos visible in \"My Photo Stream\" can differ between different devices, perhaps due to time lag between local caches and server updates.\nTo reclaim iCloud storage space, remove data from other services such as Documents and Data, Mail, and iCloud backup. In particular, iOS device backups can consume a lot of iCloud space - you might consider having iOS devices backup to your Mac through iTunes rather than backing up to iCloud. This change can be made using iTunes when the iOS device is attached via a USB cable.\n\nA: Open the iCloud preference pane on your Mac to get the easiest way I've found to manage the storage.\nClick the Manage... button in the lower right.\nThis will calculate all the storage users counting against your quota and offer you details on how to clean up each category. Once you've reviewed each bin - you can decide to delete or if you would rather purchase more storage to keep what you have stored in the cloud.\nMy experience is people can do one step to free up significant backup space from iOS. Go to the Settings app and then iCloud > Storage & Backup > Manage Storage\nSelect the device you are on and then under BACKUP OPTIONS - turn off Camera Roll and possibly any other items you don't want backed up.\nThis means you need another way to back up your photos, but since you have a Mac - you could set iPhoto to automatically back up all photo stream contents or regularly sync the photos and videos from iOS to the Mac and then back up the Mac to a cheaper hard drive or service than iCloud.\n", "Q: iMovie update stuck with phantom app when I updated iMovie back on July 7, I had an error where it kept continuously saying that I had an update, but what it kept doing was installing the same update over and over.

As long as the mac is awake there is no problem at all to backup or retrieve files.\nHowever, the problem occurs during sleep when Time Machine tries to backup during Power Nap. Once it wakes from sleep it displays the error message that TM backup failed and in the console I can find the somewhat more detailed message: \"No destination resolvable\"\nTo me it seems that during sleep the system dismounts all mounted volumes because it loses ethernet access at the point when it goes to sleep, but once it briefly wakes during Power Nap it does not remount the volume from the SMB share, but rather just looks for the previously mounted Sparse Disk Image Bundle at /Volumes/MyBackup/. \nOnce the system wakes fully from sleep it remounts the disk image without any problems. \nSo my questions is: is it possible to have the mac remount the Sparse Disk Image Bundle that is located on an SMB share to backup during Power Nap?\n\nA: No - Power Nap is extremely selective about what activities it will take on and thus far, no third party hooks or API is provided by Apple to allow someone to easily modify what happens when the OS wakes from a nap.\nClearly, someone could reverse engineer things and come along with a solution, but that hasn't happened yet.

I've been playing an iPhone game for about a week and today the phone didn't detect some of my swipes.  It still detected most of my swipes, but on a few occasions I swiped and nothing happened.  I did drop my phone on a carpeted floor yesterday so I wonder if that has anything to do with it.\nAre there any apps that let you test the iPhone touchscreen?  I would think someone has developed an app that lets you touch/swipe anywhere on the screen and it gives you visual feedback that it detected your touch/swipe.  I searched in the App Store and didn't see anything.\nI found this answer that said there are a few utilities that let you test the responsiveness of your iPhone, but it didn't mention the names of those utilities.  It also mentioned a web site named Sparky, but I went there on my iPhone and couldn't do anything there.\nI have an iPhone 4S running iOS 6.1.3.\n\nA: Sparky works for testing multitouch, so you can try different areas of the screen by holding one finger in a place you know works and move the other elsewhere. If the line breaks, then the second finger is in a location that doesn't work. You can test it full screen (without the Safari UI but the status bar is still present) by adding it to the home screen.\n\nA: i know this is an old post but if somebody is still looking for a solution to their touchscreen problems, there is an application on app store which helps you test the touch screen of your iPhone and iPad. its a brilliant app.\nhere's the link:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/touchscreen-test/id1126113478?mt=8\n\nA: You can test most of the functions of iphone including the display by Phone diagnostics app.\nLink to download: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/phone-diagnostics/id1171677218?ls=1&mt=8 or you can search Phone diagnostics or Hitek Nova.\n\nA: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/touchscreen-test/id1126113478?mt=8\n--> It works.\nFor Google Play App, I found Phone Doctor Pro which is similar to this one:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hitek.phonedoctorpro.android\n", "Q: If the iphone gets stolen, if i wipe all the information from the iphone from my icloud account it can be usable?

The thief could wipe the phone by putting it into DFU mode, but upon trying to access the phone they would run into the problem of still having to input the iCloud password into the phone so that they are able to access it as it is still registered in Apple's data base as being connected to your account.\nSo yes the phone can be made to go back to its original state by recovery, but no it will not be able to be activated as long as they do not have your iCloud password.\n", "Q: Can I still get charged for data if I dont use my sim card?

My server is running Open Directory, and we would like to get the Radius service up and running.  I've been running through many other posts with similar problems, but have not found a solution yet.\nOne of the biggest issues I seem to be encountering is that (almost) every article I find says something like:\n\nYou turn on RADIUS for OS X Server by selecting your Apple wireless device in the Server app's sidebar and selecting “Require user name and password login over Wi-Fi.”\n\nMy server does not show anything like that in the sidebar.  I have tried numerous configurations, with no luck.

I am going to an engineering school, and often typing isn't the primary method I would like to use to enter equations, data, or text.\nDoes OneNote for Mac support this? I know the Windows version does.\n\nA: Running OneNote on Mavericks here, and right now it does not support tablet input in the way you have described (I wish it did). A possible compromise is to run Windows and OneNote in a virtual machine (or BootCamp), but it really depends on your needs and what you’re willing to put up with.\n", "Q: Convert Numbers.app spreadsheet to JSON document?

So I have the same clash of clans village on my iPad and my iPhone. \nHow do I start a new village on my iPad while keeping the same one on my iPhone?\n\nA: At this time it is a little late. You will have to factory reset one of them, redownload the game and start that game with a new gamecenter ID (do not use your old one for your base, but a brand new ID). Then you will have a new account. You can switch between the two by simply changing your Gamecenter ID from one to the other on either device. Without the factory reset, it will always default you back to your \"original\" base, even with a new gamcenter ID.\n", "Q: Can I activate three 3GS iPhones if i set them all back to factory settings using iTunes? I was wondering if I have 3 3GS iPhones and they are all locked and I set them back to factory settings using iTunes, if I could activate them and just activate using one SIM card and then use them just with WiFi with out the SIM card?\n\nA: Yes, as you said yourself you need a simcard to activate them.

However, the alias still exists as a address I can send/recieve iMessages from.\nOn my iPhone I can still tap the i button to get info, and remove the alias. This allows me to remove the email address from my iPhone (it claims: You will no longer be able to receive iMessages at XXX@icloud.com on any device.) However if I turn off iMessages and turn it back on the alias reappears. The alias also shows in Messages on Mac, and there doesn't appear to be anyway to remove it from Messages for Mac.\nIdeally I want to permanently delete the alias from iMessage.\n\nA: Ok – think I've sorted it. I had to remove the email address from the Manage your Apple ID: https://appleid.apple.com/signin \nThe email alias had become an Alternate Email address. Deleting it there removed it from iMessages after signing out and then back in.\n\nA: I don't know how to permanently delete the alias, but in the iMessages settings, you can find a list of the email addresses you can send/receive from, and you can uncheck ones that you don't want to use.  You could uncheck the email to remove it from receiving/sending iMessages, but I don't know how to delete aliases.\n", "Q: Alternative to AlwaysAppendSearchDomains on Yosemite?

I am doing antenna simulations in order to visualize the electric field produced by an iPhone and an iPad. In order to do so, I need to know what typical power output these devices have.\nFrom Wikipedia it is said that:\n\nWhereas a mobile phone can range from 21 dBm (125 mW) for Power Class 4 to 33 dBm (2W) for Power class 1 [...]\n\nI need to be more precise than this, so I was wondering if anyone knew what power class a regular iPad and and iPhone is?\n\nA: The radio frequencies and they respective power are regulated by official sources. In the USA, you will need to go to the FCC web site to get precise numbers for the radio power output.\nIn order to search the FCC OET Equipment Authorization database, you will need the FCC ID of the device you want to lookup. \nAll devices that use radio frequency spectrum are required to print their unique FCC ID on a label on the device. \nIt may also be printed on a separate document that accompanies the device. \nExample for iPhone 4S WiFi radio.\n\n", "Q: Downloaded app won't open because it is from an unidentified developer I have download photo express mac version on my MacBook Pro and it won't open it said can't opened because it is from an unidentified developer.

Happening to all kind of headphones.\nThe preferences say \" Digital out : The selected device has no output controls.\"\n\nA: When you are using a digital out device, the Mac simply passes the digital signal to the receiving device where the settings should be adjusted, this is the correct behavior. Unless your Mac is mistaking the headphones as a digital device when they are really analog, then this isn't a Mac issue. To determine if it is a Mac issue I'd try plugging in another analog audio source (different pair of headphones) to see if the problem is repeatable, otherwise it could be something with the headphones (or even the headphone cable).\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Sound Settings > Output and select your headphones.\n\nA: Go to System Preferences > Sound Settings > Output and select your headphones.\nThis worked out well for me!

If I want to delete photos off my Camera Roll after transferring them to iCloud, will those photos be lost permanently?\n\nA: Deleting photos from the Camera Roll has no effect on photos already in your PhotoStream and vice-versa.\nPhoto Stream is temporary so if you don't access your PhotoStream on your computer where the photos can be saved locally on your computer (there is an option to do this automatically with iPhoto on a Mac), you should import the phtoos from the Camera Roll with your computer. You can delete the photos from the Camera Roll after the photos have been imported by your computer as with any other digital camera. \n\nA: If you remove them from your Camera Roll and don't delete them in your PhotoStream they will remain on iCloud.\n", "Q: Black Screen Failure, requires forced reset restart Macbook Pro 15\" I'm getting the Black Screen more & more often.

One thing I would really like to do is \"dock it\" to my existing rig.. two dvi displays, keyboard, mouse, etc.\nI know apple doesn't do docking stations so I was wondering what my options are?  So far it looks like I am going to have to plug and unplug up to 4 cables to accommodate my setup.  This is totally a pain.  I dock and undock my current laptop up to 5 times a day.  I don't want to have to mess will all these wires every time.

How do I get more? iCal allows 25,000 event entries to be backed up on iCloud. I need more. Is there a way to go over this limit, or segment the iCal file into years, and only activate locally (on my desktop Mac) the years I need at that time? I only need the last 12 months for my iPhone and iPad, but I need the last 10 years of iCal on my desktop. Any solutions? Note: A good solution for me would be to only back up to iCloud my desktop iCal events going back 12 months, and leave my desktop iCal untouched. The problem appears to be when I go online, and iCal attempts to sync with iCloud, and can't - because the desktop iCal has over 25,000 entries.\n\nA: Why not take the last 9 years of calendar entries, export them as an iCal Archive, then create a new calendar, import those entries, but do not sync to iCal. You can then delete those entries from your daily calendar, while maintaining history in your archive calendar. You can sync this archive calendar to your iPhone via iTunes, rather than iCloud. Of course, you can do this with your 10 years of entries as well, but you will not get the nice benefits from iCloud on your daily calendar.\n", "Q: Cursor jumps around on Macbook Pro mid-2010, without trackpad installed to solve my erratic cursor on my mid-2010 MacBook Pro, I brought my computer to the local apple store and had the trackpad completely uninstalled. Does anybody know what it means for the trackpad to completely uninstalled? Ok, anyways I'm going to post a question I never got a reply to on the apple support page. Here it goes.\nMacbook Pro mid 2010 15 inch\nProcessor: 2.4 GHz Intel Core i5\nMemory: 8 GB\nSoftware: Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M 256 MB\nOk all the problems started two years ago, after I bought the computer. For the first four months everything was all dandy until I notices that my cursor behaving erratically, even though I was using a mouse. So I thought that the problem was a bulging battery, even though the trackpad still appeared normal. So using the universal access preferences, I completely turned off the trackpad completely, (using the option to switch off the trackpad when a mouse was in use).\nBTW, the mouse was new and corded; used on other computers, it behaved normally.\nAnother year and a half goes by, and I start encountering another problem. This time the computer would occasionally power off. This occurred randomly, with no preference as to which program or application was more susceptible. In the console it read as a kernel panic, (I had no idea what that meant) and as usual I ignored the problem, blaming it on a faulty battery that would soon need to be replaced. Finally one day I mustered up the courage to go to my peach mac provider and understand the problem.\nI was duly shocked to hear green checks all round. Everything was fine in fact (including the battery) expect the trackpad; a problem, which employees assured me, was common enough. Trackpads on my type of macbook pro would occasionally go haywire and just screw up. The estimate for replacement was $170, which was too deep for my pocket, so I politely declined and asked for any other solution. After some prodding, they said they could \"unscrew\" the trackpad, and I was all ears for this, because I gotten used to working without one. So the trackpad was uninstalled and I returned happy to my house. Also, they told me that a kernel panic was a software issue that could be the fault of the OS X or a third party application.\nI forgot to mention, along with the panics, came the general erratic behavior of the cursor. Not as before, where the cursor would go around clicking and dragging mayhem everywhere, but just general skipping around and inaccuracy. So to solve this problem, I bought a new mouse. It was a G100s.\nSet to discover the reason behind the kernel panics, I did everything I could to solve the problem. In fact I deleted my entire hard-drive and reinstalled the OS and backed-up the backup. After this, the kernel panics have not yet reoccured (will edit if one does) but the mouse foolishness did. I was afraid to reset the VRAM or whatever you call it, since it also deletes the error log, something that I may want to keep as proof for any techies that may have the solution to the problem.\nOnce, I started up in safe mode and the mouse worked fine, in fact gloriously accurate, however I was not and could not perform any cpu intensive programs to heat things up. I say this because the mouse problem only occurs after about 30 minutes on the computer. I notice that the general mouse performance is subpar compared to using it on another computer.\nIf anyone can provide any possible solutions or anything please feel free. And I forgot to include a vital piece of information or something is written in a confusing manner, tell me.\n\nA: I have a similar problem with my 2009 MacBook Pro. I've been told by an aftermarket apple dealer that it is the graphics card. The card is damaged by overheating. The overheating is due an erratic fan. The erratic fan is caused by a damaged logic board.\n", "Q: Using the same audio input on multiple devices, recording iOS video I am recording video with two iOS devices (which I will then use for camera cuts, etc...), and I would like to use a single audio source for both videos.\nMy thought is that I would need some kind of splitter that could take output from something like the iRig PRE, then split that and plug it into both devices as a microphone and it would work as such.\nIs there such a device?\nOr am I going about trying to edit video from multiple cameras all wrong?\n(What I'm doing at the moment is recording the audio line separately, then syncing it to each video, rendering out intermediate sync'd up video, and then editing those files together, which seems like it wastes an extra step; but I've no professional training in how this is generally accomplished.)\nThe only answers I've found here seem to involve using separate headphones and a mic running into the same jack on a device, which is kind of the inverse of what I am looking for.\n\nA: There were no devices which were designed to filter matching audio into two iOS devices at the same time. The solution I went with in my comment is likely the best.\nThat is, Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro X both have a feature which will use audio to automatically sync up video tracks. I recorded high quality audio with an external microphone, and using that in conjunction with the audio built into each device, FCP:X was able to create a multi-camera clip with the three audio tracks and two video tracks synced up. I could then select each audio track and each video track independently.\n", "Q: Mailto: tag won't dissappear I've had this problem a few times in the past.

I want to confirm what driver each Mac is using and I cannot locate that specifically. I have looked at all the drivers on each machine and they both look to have the same driver options on each computer. \nSo how to I tell which driver they are each currently using? In case it is a simple as they are using different drivers.\n\nA: In Safari, enter the address (without quotes) \"localhost:631\" to view your CUPS administration page.  The tabs along the top are fairly self explanatory.\nAdministration > Manage Printers > Select the printer.  This will show you the driver that it is currently set to use.\nIf you instead receive a message that the web interface is currently disabled you will need to first enter this line into Terminal and press return.\ncupsctl WebInterface=yes\n\n\nA: Go to System Preferences → Printers & Scanners, select your printer and click Options & Supplies.

I am not a mobile app developer, but we do feature responsive design in our website which works very well across all mobile browsers. \nSo if I were to make an app that only contains a fullscreen WebView component that loads the website, would that app be approved to get on the Appstore?\n\nA: Apps which are just web views are specifically against the App Review Guidelines:\n\n2.12 Apps that are not very useful, unique, are simply web sites bundled as Apps, or do not provide any lasting entertainment value may be rejected\n\nSource: App Store Review Guidelines\n\nA: In my experience....no, would not get approved. \n", "Q: How long does it take for a review to appear in the App Store?

I had Wine installed however wine my.exe no longer works. I get a -bash: wine: command not found error. I thought it might somehow have become de-installed, but upon trying to reinstall I get: wine-1.7.19 already installed To install this version, first 'brew unlink wine'. I've been having lots of permission errors which can't be corrected by disk utility, all of which are \"ACL found but not expected\" and brew doctor found a whole load of broken symlinks which have since been pruned. All very odd behaviour.\nHow do I get Wine to run without having to unlink it and reinstall it? I'd much prefer if I could just continue where I left off.\nI'm not using MacPorts as far as I'm aware.\n\nA: If it is a simple problem then brew unlink wine and brew link wine might resolve it. This isn't the same as uninstalling and reinstalling, which would be brew remove wine and brew install wine. It should be quite quick.\nWhen brew installs a piece of software it installs it to /usr/local/Cellar and then links it to /usr/local/bin. Unlinking just removes those links, so it is still there but basically sitting somewhere it wouldn't normally be found.\nBut the first thing to try would be to check that /usr/local/bin is in your path. You can check this by typing echo $PATH in a Terminal window. You should see something like /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin.\n", "Q: Remote app on iPad regularly loses connection to Mac I'm using a Mac mini with an external 3TB hard drive to run my audio system.\nI'm controlling iTunes on the Mac mini using Apple's Remote app on my iPad.\nMy problem is that Remote seems to lose the connection with the Mac repeatedly,\nso in turn I lose the ability to control my music.

For some reason the Login screen is mirrored on both my monitors and annoyingly this changes the resolution and aspect ratio shown on the MacBook, I really don't like it, and it's never done this before. It also creates a strange animation as the screen logs in which I fins even more annoying. Before the second monitor would show the background of the login screen but certainly would not effect the resolution of the main screen or be mirrored. What's going on there?\nThanks,\nMike\nTwo screenshots, one of the displays and a profile error which I can't help but feel is also a side effect of the issue I had.\n\nA: Pressing ⌘+F1 is the shortcut for switching between mirrored (same thing on both displays) and extended desktop (each display is independent) modes.\nPressing that while at the login screen should sort your problem.\n", "Q: Is it legal to develop iOS apps on Windows? Is it legal to develop for iOS on a Windows machine? I have researched this on Google, but I do not seem to be able to find a direct answer, yes or no, whether it is legal or illegal to do iOS app development on Windows.\nHere is an article that I have found regarding the legal issue (or lack of): http://www.pmbaty.com/iosbuildenv/legal.html\nIs it legal to develop iOS apps on a non-Apple hardware such as a Dell or Lenovo machine or any other hardware which is generally made for Windows or Linux? or On vmware? \nWith regard to location, I am talking about India, or otherwise non-US resident.\n\nA: Yes\n…it's legal to develop iOS apps on hardware or software other than Macs and OS X respectively as it does not violate the Registered Apple Developer Agreement:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/programs/terms/registered_apple_developer_20100301.pdf\nYou can develop iOS apps on any platform that you can, using a variety of software available. The legal problems come from running OS X on unsupported hardware, or running pre-release software without being a developer, etc.\n\nA: Yes as long as you pay your developer fees if you wanna launch apps on appstore. But running OSX other than on an Apple device is illegal as the software is only sold on Macs and not for the public and its made not to work on any other platform.\n\nA: No, it's not, at least not with the \"PMBaty iOS Buildenv\",\nit's a pure license violation.\nThe iOS SDK can only be legally used on Apple Systems.\nhttp://www.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/xcode.pdf:\n\nYou agree not to install, use or run the SDK on any non-Applebranded computer, or to enable others to do so. \n\nI have asked that guy to provide the source code for the GPL programs\nthat he is using (cctools, ldid, etc.), but he has strictly ignored my e-mails regarding to that.\nHe has also violated the Cygwin license in the past.\nThat guy is a shame.\n", "Q: Can't create a new desktop workspace?

Also note that you can have a maximum of 17 desktops, or 16 desktops and Dashboard, then the + button is no longer available.\n\nA: Fun fact: If your desktop background is black (like mine is) you can almost see the \"+\" icon.  If you squint you can see its drop-shadow.

I use it as my VPN server, my bittorrent rsync server, web server, ssh server and so forth.\nSometimes I manually disconnect the LAN cable from my server to speed up my connection for online gaming, afterwards I plug back the LAN cable.\nWhat is a good way to temporary disable the LAN device on my MacBook running OS X 10.6.8? Preferably that it automatically enables again after a specified period of time (some sort of timer). I would prefer a method via SSH.\n\nA: Selfcontrol\nSelfcontrol is an app build for a different purpose, it disables your network connectivity for a certain amount of time to keep you from visiting social websites and keep you more productive. It makes it possible for you to create a white-list or a black-list to allow or block certain ip-adress/sites.\nSo I login to the server, set Selfcontrol to 1h. Now my internet connection from my server is disabled for 1h and will automatically come back afterwards.\n\n\nA: If you disable your LAN device, you won't be able to log on SSH again.\nIf you need just to disable internet access for this machine, you could remove the default gateway with: sudo route delete default and add with sudo route add default GATEWAY_IP.\n", "Q: How do I access hidden or specific directories/paths from the finder?

My understanding is that when files are deleted on a computer (and here, I am considering the iPhone a \"computer\"), those files are typically recoverable using forensic tools. I know there are easy ways to delete everything securely, however...\nHow can one delete individual files on the iPhone such that they are unrecoverable, without deleting everything?\n\nA: This app in Cydia seems like it would do the trick (provided it works as advertised):\nhttp://cydia.saurik.com/package/iwipe/\nThe app works by making a very large file that takes up all the free space in the user memory and writes zeros to all the bits. So to securely delete individual files, one would simply (insecurely) delete them (marking them as free space), and then wipe free space with the above app.\n", "Q: Mac mini won´t boot up I have a Mac mini that fell from a desk, my kid was playing aroung and it hit the floor, I picked it up and it stared up but when the Apple logo comes up the little cricle appears and thats it, it wont boot, up, I dont know what to do, I tried some of the commands booting up and they dont work but i dont know if its because i have a wireless mouse and keyboard. Also, i gotta mention i have a CD stuck in the drive that I cant get out. Please help, any idea of what i can do?\n\nA: It sounds like the hard disk may have been damaged, or perhaps its connector has become disconnected.\nIf you can dismantle it, try disconnecting the hard disk and reconnecting it. If that makes no difference, then it sounds like you need a new hard disk (or even an SSD).\nInstalling is possible from a USB stick, so you don't need to use the DVD drive. But while you are dismantling the machine, you might want to look at getting the CD out of the drive!\nAlso - you didn't mention which model/year the Mac Mini is. That makes quite a difference to any instructions someone might want to show you.\n", "Q: Log out of Apple TV Can you sign out of Apple TV using an iPad or phone? I logged into my exs Apple TV and now I am not sure what he can see or use in my stuff.\n\nA: The easiest way is probably to change your Apple ID password. However, you would then have to sign in to all your own devices again using the new password.\n\nA: Go to https://appleid.apple.com/ log in with your AppleID and password. In the next page, scroll down and you will see every device you have signed into with that AppleID. You can remove any device from the list right from within that interface by clicking on the device you wish to remove and confirming the removal.\n\nA: Probably not, you could use the Remote app but you would have to be on the same network as the AppleTV and be able to see its output. Which probably isnt an option as its your ex's.  I would go with Scott's answer, as inconvenient as it might be, it will prevent unauthorized access to your account. \n", "Q: What external screen size/resolution will make using Xcode on an 11 inch Air better? I'm looking for an external LCD for my 11 inch Macbook Air (i5, 2013). The only thing I (am going to) use the Mac for is Xcode so the screen size needs to support development needs.\nI hear the minimum decent resolution for Xcode is 1920x1080. \nIs that enough or should I be looking for more pixels?\n\nA: I would look at the pixel counts for the current iMacs since I've never heard of anyone that couldn't get substantial work done with the smaller but that most developers really appreciate the pixels of the larger iMac if they do substantial coding (6 hours a day or more).\nhttp://www.apple.com/imac/specs/\nThe lower pixel count is 1920-by-1080 and the larger is 2560-by-1440\nI've actually been productive on the 11 inch Air when traveling, but having a second display of any size was a big plus when at a desk to have code or documentation on the built in display and the app running on the larger screen (or the other way occasionally). \nThe fact that you have one use in mind for the Mac means you probably can do with less screen than someone that will also want to do communication, email, calendar as well as coding.\n\nA: My experience is largely with either my old 17\" MacBook Pro (1920 x 1200, 17\") and 23\" external monitors that run at 1920 x 1080.\nFirst off, the extra 10% of vertical space makes a huge difference.\nSecondly, I have found 1920 x 1200 to be fine, and it should be possible to get a screen at that resolution for your budget.\nThirdly, if you can get a 1920 x 1200 screen at 27\" for $250, that sounds like a bit of a bargain.\n23\" is a fine size, and 1920 x 1080 is acceptable, with 1920 x 1200 preferred. You don't want 30\" at 1920, but 27\" should be OK.\n", "Q: Is there any iTunes Connect API? What I am actually looking for is to get the app download statistics from iTunes connect. Ideally a dashboard would be possible with a full API. \nThere was this idea where some coding could be done in the iphone app section so as to determine if the app is being launched for the first time and so fire a url with the flag. Rather than intercepting or proxying the the communications from the iOS iTunes connect app, I would like to retrieve an app's download statistics from iTunes connect itself.\nIs there a public API or private framework to reverse engineer this?\n\nA: As noted in a PDF released by Apple, there is a java tool to export the data from iTunes connect. \nThis is to compensate the absence of API for iTunesConnect. Still in late 2017, Apple provides no API for iTunes connect or app review services. \n\nA: after looking everywhere I did not find a PHP version of the reports API so made my own.\nYou can check it out on https://github.com/Finnb8r/itunes-connect-sales-api-php .\nI realize that this is not an Objective-C wrapper but this link comes out on top when generally looking for an API.\n", "Q: Messages.app on mac: search in history i've a problem, i'm able to search for string in messages.app. It actually tells me all the matches for every conversation, the problem is that is shows only the last match, how can i go through all the results?\n\nA: You can simply use\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘ + G in order to jump to the next occurrence\n\n\nand\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘ + Shift + G in order to jump to the previous one.\n\n\nA: Have you tried Spotlight Search? \nCmnd + Space\nMake sure Messages is enabled for Spotlight Search in your Mac System Preferences.\n", "Q: Apple Push Notification reliablity I have one app supported on both Android and iOS. The app needs a background service which hits a remote server every minute. The job is simple for Android app but since background tasking is not supported in iOS I need to employ push notifications for iOS app. Apple says that the delivery of push notification is never acknowledged. I cannot afford push notification failure since I need to send a very crucial message through notification. My questions are:\n1) What is the failure rate of push notifications? \n2) Are push notifications always reliable to send important messages?\n3) Assume that the server which is supposed to send push notifications sends a large number of push notifications every minute. What are the chances of push notification failure in such a case?\n4) Which circumstances cause push notification delivery to fail?\nIf you have any useful resources please provide the same. Thanks.\n\nA: The notifications come through 99.9%, I think the 0.01% is when your phone doesn't have network. That is the only reason it won't go through, unless you have a poor server with 10000 requests per second then yes that will fail. \nSo for best results just get a good server. I don't think you can help people with cellular coverage. Even if you did run in background they won't be able to pull data from internet if they don't have cellular network. \nApple just wants you to not rely on it 100%, so make a backup plan for it, let the user know the app can't connect to the server if there's no network. I'll say do push notifications, then if that fails try get from server manually and make local notifications, if the app can't make connection to the server fire up a local notification that says it couldn't connect to your server.\nHope this helps?\n", "Q: View Time Machine backup drive on Windows 7 I use an external hard drive to regularly backup my Mac using Time Machine. However, I wanted to copy the data on this drive to a Windows 7 machine which does not work. It seems, that the PC recognices the external dirve, but does not list it.\nIs it even possible to run the hard drive on a PC? I suggest this might be due to the formation. Is there a way to overcome this problem without re-formatting the disk?\n\nA: You can access an OSX formatted disk using 3d part applications such \nHFSExplorer or Macdrive\n\nA: You can read HFS+ disks on Windows by installing Apple's Boot Camp drivers:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1638\n", "Q: Format SSD and restore TM backup My SSD stopped mounting by itself on boot.

However, after booting all I see is the Guest user and not the admin user. \nHowever, I have a TM backup and would like to simple erase the entire disk and restore. The issue is I can't erase the disk in Recovery Mode using Disk Utility as it does not get mounted automatically.\nWhat would be the best approach?\n\nA: Hold down the Command and R keys at startup to start the computer from the Recovery system. The Recovery menu that appears includes the option to restore from a Time Machine backup.\n\n\n*\n\n*First: delete your SSD drive using Disk Utility.

Are these settings usually stored in some plist file? \n\nA: It depends on the Application, but mostly it's stored in the defaults database. You can check for example Mail.app with:\ndefaults read com.apple.mail DefaultWindowState\n\nIf You do not know the key just grep with \"window\" the output from defaults read BUNDLE_ID\nwhere BUNDLE_ID is Your application bundle identifier which can be read like this:\nAPP_PATH=\"/Applications/Mail.app\"\ndefaults read \"$APP_PATH/Contents/Info.plist\" CFBundleIdentifier\n\nYou can try to change keys in plists using defaults command or locate plist file in ~/Library/Preferences directory and change it manually.\n", "Q: Prevent display from turning off with certain applications I have a MacBook Pro, and during media presentations, my screen automatically turns off according to the settings app (which of course is operation as usual, to be expected).\nI'm looking for an Applescript, setting, app, commandline command, etc. that could disable the auto screen shutoff per app rather than constantly having to change the setting globally. I've already looked for a setting within the app itself (ProPresenter, in this case) with no luck. I'm also okay if the solution bases its action on the presence or absence of a second display.\n\nA: Caffeine is a small free app that can be used to temporarily override Mac settings such as sleep, screen dimming, and screen savers. The app lives in your menu dock, where you can click to turn it on (fill up the coffee cup) before your presentation, and then turn it back off (empty the coffee cup) after your presentation to set your settings back to normal.\n\nA: Amphetamine  (which Chris mentioned in a comment) makes it trivial to automatically disable sleep whenever some app is running or frontmost. From what I see online, I'm not sure Caffeine has that feature.\n", "Q: iPhone setting to turn off auto-detection of phone numbers?

Is there any workaround of that? \n\nA: Apple IDs can be created with the None payment method providing you are attempting to do something that doesn't require payment. For example, you can create an Apple ID without a payment method by going to the iTunes Store and purchasing any free app. You will be prompted to create an Apple ID and can select None as the payment method.\nFor more information, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create an iTunes Store, App Store, or iBooks Store account without a credit card or other payment method\n\nA: Head over to iTunes and select a free app. It will ask for an account.

It's my first post here.\n\nA: i've looked at external SSD's for my mac as well. they seem to be pretty pricey for their purpose. Regards the speed, thunderbolt delivers about 10Gb/s which is plenty. it seems at least as fast as an internal SSD, and a heck a lot faster than USB 3.0. If you have to absolutley get an external SSD, get one that supports thunderbolt, or even better to get one that supports thunderbolt 2.0.\n\nA: I have a Samsung 540 EVO 1TB drive running with a Seagate Thunderbolt adapter - and the performance is stunning.

I answered, but it was not my daughter. I saw the caller. Once the caller saw me, she freaked out and hung up. In my \"recents\" the call was identified as from my daughter. What's up with that?\n\nA: Something similar happened to me one time.  I made a FaceTime call, and it connected to a complete stranger.  We both freaked out.\nI had an old, stale cell phone number still attached to the person I was calling.  I suspect, but could not verify, that the number had been re-used and the new owner attached it to a different Apple ID.  FaceTime decided for some reason to place the call to the wrong Apple ID.\nI deleted the old phone number.  Since then, I've never had any trouble making this FaceTime call.\n\nA: You only need your Apple ID to register for Facetime, so it sounds like one of your daughter's friends was playing around with her iPhone/iPad/iPod/Mac. \nOr your daughter sold it, and forgot to log out of her Apple ID before handing her device over.\nAnother scenario could be that she logged into Facetime on a friend's Mac with her own Apple ID, and it's still logged in.\nCould any of those situations be it?\n", "Q: Words with friends cannot be accessed since update Words with friends has been updated and now I can't get in because I don't have a safari password.

Credit to Camelot for the steps.\nThe AppleScript log statement does not write to the StandardOutPath. Writing to a log file takes 3 steps. The second step may take 2 forms depending of wether you want to save previously written data.\n-- Open the log file\nset logFile to (open for access POSIX file \"/var/tmp/myScript.log\" with write permission)\n-- Write some data to it (clearing the existing contents)\nwrite \"some data\" & return to logFile\n-- Or, write by appending, some data to the end of existing data\nwrite \"some data\" & return to logFile starting at eof\n-- Close the file\nclose access logFile\n\nIt may help to rewrite the 1st step as 2 statements:\nset logFilePath to \"/var/tmp/myScript.log\"\nset logFile to (open for access POSIX file logFilePath with write permission)\n\nI am still searching for an answer regarding the log statements and event log.

For me, I just see an email with an attached .ics file for the same invites.\nExpected behavior seen by some people....\n\nHow my mail app shows it...\n\n\nA: Open the Contacts app, select your own email address in the list of contacts. In the menu on top of the screen, go to \"Card\" -> \"Make this my card\". Reload calendar. Then it should work, you will get a notification popup with accept/decline buttons. (I just had the same problem, on a Mac running Yosemite)\nSource\n\nA: I had the same issue. After searching forever to find a solution, I stumbled on an unrelated post that fixed the issue. Apparently, if your contact in the Contacts app doesn't have the same email address that you are trying to reply to/from, then you don't get those choices. \nBasically, change your contact to be \"me\" in the Contacts application and they show up. Contacts>Card>Make this my card\n\nA: on my iPhone:\nThe email address was already part of \"my card\". Still, I could not reply to ics-meetings copied to my calendar. \nIn General settings, Passwords & Accounts: make sure that \"calendar\" is also selected for the email account in question. \nInitially, \"calendar\" was only selected for my iCloud account, but not all of my additional email accounts. \n", "Q: How can I inspect the environment variables of a running process? Is there some equivalent (CLI or GUI) to Linux's /proc/$PID/environ feature?\n\nA: You can inspect environmental variables of running process with\nps eww <PID>\n\n\nA: The following adds on to Mateusz's answer, pretty printing the variables one per line:\nps eww -o command <PID>  | tr ' ' '\\n'\n\n\nA: See the function EnvironFromProcId():\nhttps://github.com/time-killer-games/xproc/blob/main/crossprocess.cpp\nvoid EnvironFromProcId(PROCID procId, char ***buffer, int *size)\n\nFrom the specified PROCID, (typedef for DWORD / unsigned long on Windows, otherwise pid_t / int for Mac, Linux, and other Unix-likes), the function shall copy a vector of environment strings (NAME=VALUE) to 'buffer', and the amount of strings shall be copied to 'size'. This function is not thread safe, however the source may be modified so that it can become thread safe. Note that this uses an incompletely-documented structure on Windows, and in order for it to be able to read the environment block between (to and from) both 32-bit and 64-bit processes, it uses a method that is not as performant as the other platforms. It is built with secondary executables compiled directly into the initial one, which gets extracted to the Windows temp directory at runtime, and runs from there. Depending on the architecture of the target process's associated executable image, that will determine the architecture of the secondary executable to run.  Wrote for Windows, Mac, Linux, and FreeBSD. Ubuntu / Debian needs libprocps-dev, also libx11-dev if compiled using the build*w.sh build scripts which include windowing code, (not the default). FreeBSD will need libX11 if built with windowing.\nOr, compile from the source code using the build scripts (MinGW / g++ on Windows / Linux, clang on Mac / FreeBSD), then run from the command line passing the --env-from-pid pid command line parameters. Pass the --help parameter for the list of all possible options.\nFor convenience, example usage is in main.cpp (the actual CLI code): https://github.com/time-killer-games/xproc/blob/fe14ec70e4e58359ddf3d29aa03c86328c97b49b/main.cpp#L153\n", "Q: Multiple kernel panics per day on MacBookPro4,1 2008 mostly in web surf mode I've had freezing issues more and more frequently (now multiple per day) with my early 2008 Macbook Pro 4,1\nI've pasted a recent kernel panic log beneath, and hope someone can point me in the right direction.\nThis problem was happening on OS X 10.6 recently, and I did a Rember test on the memory which looked \"ok\", as well as verified the hard drive in single user mode—also checked out \"ok\".\nI've since done a clean install of 10.8 but the problem persists.

How to recreate? I started seeing an issue in Chrome (38 on OSX 10.7.5) accessing GitHub. I got a Privacy error. One of the recommendations on SuperUser, and the reply I got from GitHub support, was to delete all expired certificates in Keychain Access, close the browser, and reboot the machine. I followed the advice.\nNow, I cannot access many other sites: LinkedIn, StackExchange sites etc. - all with the same error. I'm forced to use another browser (which btw, shows an error next to the HTTPS lock icon). The Keychain Access certificates view does not repopulate.

Is there any way to have .gsheets show up under spreadsheets?\n\nA: The reason that Google spreadsheets aren't classified by Spotlight as spreadsheets is that information is missing from the Info.plist file within the Google Drive application.\nFor example, in the Info.plist file within the Numbers application bundle Apple define their \"numbers\" document with the Document Content Type UTIs of com.apple.iwork.numbers.numbers. Then further down in the same plist that UTI is then further defined as \"Conforms to\" amongst other things public.spreadsheet. And this is why Spotlight classifies Numbers document as \"Spreadsheets\".\n\n\nHowever in the Info.plist for Google Drive there is no Document Content Type UTIs for gsheet files at all, and therefore no \"Conforms to\" either. So Spotlight just treats it as \"Other\".\n\nThis is something that Google should really fix, and it should be relatively simple for them to do so.\nIn the meantime there is a possible (albeit slightly hacky) potential fix outlined towards the end of this answer to a question on superuser.com: OSX: assign extension to content kind\n", "Q: Forgot old iCloud account password I have changed my Apple ID (email and password) on my computer.

Is there a PoE (Power over Ethernet) kit available for the 802.11ac Airport Extreme? I.e., a kit that will allow me to power the Airport Extreme from PoE instead of from a wall outlet?\n\nA: No - the power supply expects 100-240 VAC and lists the current draw as 1.5 A which seems quite high for the heat it puts out, but perhaps with several USB drives connected and max power it gets even half that usage in real life.\nYou certainly can take DC power from POE using a splitter, but those all seem to provide 1A at 12 VDC which is a far cry short of the wattage listed for the Airport Extreme. I doubt you'd find a DC to AC inverter that would generate enough AC to run the Airport though...\n\nA: There is a solution, see http://find-a-poe.com/wp-content/uploads/WS-GPOE-12v36w1.pdf - works up to 328 ft from a power source.\n", "Q: How do I merge folders using finder?

When he sends out attachments, they show up as the attachment as well as an \"Untitled attachment #####.htm\" file along with it (1 attachment becomes 2, 2 becomes 4, et al). \nMy boss has asked me to look into this because the Mac based coworker sends out several pdf's to clients (This happens on other files too though), and weird attachments may look like spam/viruses to the clients, something we're not too keen on.\nDoes anyone know why this is, and if its fixable through apple mail? I've done some research, but the jury seems pretty out on this on. I can say along with attachments, this coworker uses an html based signature, but if that breaks things, he can probably use an image based one.\n\nA: Do you see these strange attachments in some version of Outlook?\nIn my own testing it seems to be that if there is anything after an attachment then Outlook interprets it as another unnamed attachment and generates an ATT0001.txt file (I'm assuming different versions of Exchange or Outlook might result in different names for the attachments).\nIf you make sure that the attached PDF is the last thing in the email then Outlook seems to parse the emails okay.\nAbout the Insert attachments at End of Message option on the Edit -> Attachments menu in Mail. By default if you drag an attachment onto a Mail message window it'll place the attachment wherever you drop the attachment. But if you select the Insert attachments at End of Message option, then when you try to attach a file Mail will automatically drop it at the end of the message no matter where you actually position the cursor as you drag the attachment over the window. However it won't prevent you subsequently typing text after the attachment, which results in the ATTxxxx.txt file.\nLong story short, make sure the PDF attachment is at the very end of the email and Outlook should parse the email okay.\nLet us know how you get on.\n\nA: I found a fix,\nUse this extension for Mac Mail:\nhttp://universalmailer.github.io/UniversalMailer/download.html\nEDIT: Nazi mods edited my post.

How can we get it to only go to one device ( the one we are sending the message to)? \n\nA: Use different Apple IDs on each device. Using the same Apple ID will mean that the devices will be indistinguishable to FaceTime/iMessage/etc.\n\nA: As mentioned, you should use a different Apple ID on each device, for Messaging.\nHowever, for the Store, you can use the same ID across devices to allow you to share apps, music and other purchased content.\n\nA: iCloud Accounts are Personal, so this means, every Apple User should have an own iCloud Account. \nYou can use your iCloud Accounr for the Store and iCloud Services and your husband can use it also in the Store. \n(Best way is to add first the new iCloud Account on your husbands Phone - switch to AppStore App - logout from iCloud Account - login with AppleID with Payment or purchased Apps) \nIn the Future you can set up a Family Account (iOS 8 Feature) so it will be no Problem to share purchased Apps and Games with the Personal iCloud Account of you Husband.\n", "Q: Can Pages 5 (a.k.a.

So can it import from this version? If so, are there any additional caveats I should be aware of?\n\nA: According to Ars Technica's iWork '13 review, Pages '13 can't open '08 documents.\n\nThe iWork '13 apps on the Mac can open iWork '09 files but not iWork '08 files.\n\nIf you still have a copy of Pages '09 you could save the documents in '09 format and then use '13 to save them in '13 format.\n\nA: If you are not dependent on any Pages specific features like the stationary or embedded images your easiest option may just be to export form Pages 08 as a Microsoft Word DOC file.  Then you can easily open the file in Pages 13.  If you dare to entrust your data to a proprietary Apple file format that is.\nThis lack of backward compatibility over just five years is appalling.

I've made some research on this issue, and the best topics I've found, for they contain almost every other topics answers in a clear and brief way, can be found here and here.\nI've followed even before finding the linked topic all instructions, that is:\n\n\n*\n\n*I do not have any sharing options enabled (System Preferences →\nSharing).\n\n*I do not have \"Wake for network access\" enabled (System\nPreferences → Energy Saver). \n\n*It does not matter if the Mac is connected to a power source. \n\n*I've reset the SMC and the PRAM, but this did not help.\n\n\nand also:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've restarted my mac on safe mode, and tried to enter on sleep mode, but also unsuccessful.\n\n\nSo, as can be seem in many places, the next step is to check the power management log, by doing pmset -g pslog. By doing so, I've discovered the cause for my issue, but I have not found any solution for this problem but to change the power management system, and the alternatives seems only to exist for hackintoshes (as I've found out here).

I'm in the process of replacing OS X's default 'Search with Google' context menu item (found when you right click on text in many apps like Terminal, Notes, or third party ones like the RSS reader ReadKit), with my own one that opens in Chrome as the default aforementioned one is a Safari service and hard-linked to open in Safari only.\nSo currently, my context menu (in ReadKit), looks like this:\n\nI want to be able to get rid of Safari's 'Search with Google' at the top so I don't accidentally use it instead of my own one down the bottom.\nNow I realise the actual file / code for the service may be contained inside Safari.app or in ~/Library/Safari somewhere, (though I've had a quick look not finding anything that stands out in particular), but I'm thinking that if I could delete the service outright, it might cause instability, problems, or be re-added when Safari is updated next, anyway. (Though it would be an acceptable second best, if someone can figure out how to do it - without deleting or affecting Safari itself.)\nAs for the OS X services Preferences menu, it is already unticked, but still present in Terminal, Notes, ReadKit etc.:\n\nSo is there a way I can actually remove it? Where in the system does OS X register / save 'Services', whether ones in OS X by default, third party apps, or ones added by the user in Automator? Maybe I can go there and 'remove' the one from Safari so it no longer shows in the context menus?\nOr maybe there's some app that can tweak context menu items in general in OS X, including this Safari one I'm looking at? (I have already tried Services Manager which doesn't appear to change it, and as for Service Scrubber they say it may cause problems in OS X 10.6 or later so I have not tried it.)\n(N.b., if there's a Terminal hack to just turn off the whole 'Searching' services section in the context menu outright, that would be acceptable for me as I don't use the 'Look up \"x\"' item [above 'Search with Google'] anyway.)\n\nA: My own experience (on 10.9) is that the service uses the default search engine selected for the default browser, so right now my own \"Search with…\" says \"Search DuckDuckGo for…\" and will open in Firefox.\n\nThis doesn't answer your other questions, but it may mean you don't need to bother. I hope it helps. I've an old system running 10.6 so I'll give that a look when I get a chance and see if the same can be done there.\n", "Q: Can read mail on iPhone but not on computer I can check mail on my Phone because the password was inputted when set up.  After a while I forgot it and cannot check mail on my computer!  I tried to retrieve it by using the \"I forgot ..,\" but after many tries, not successful.

Depending on your carrier this may or may not be available.\nIf it's not available there might be another way to hide your caller ID by pre-pending a prefix to the number you dial. For example in the UK you can add 141 to the start to hide your called ID.\n", "Q: How to transfer contacts from iPhone to PC? I have contacts on my iPhone 5 that I wish to transfer to my PC.

Today I have a new rMBP (bottom of the range latest MBP with 4GB RAM and 128GB SSD) coming and I've just found out that annoyingly they have an upgraded model out just £100 more than I paid, with 8GB of RAM and a 200MHz upgrade to the processor (which the latter I'm not bothered about). This is an upgrade to my 2012 Macbook Air 128GB, also 4GB, which I used for Xcode, Terminal, VIM, browsing the internet (same for the rMBA). I always look at my RAM to find that it's usually nearly full, but I don't have any issues what so ever (no slow downs, no crashes, no panics), and it never changes. I don't multi-task (I don't need to). The prime reason for buying a rMBA was for the Retina screen -- I could have got a MBA for the same price.\nI would like to use this for 2-4 years.\nMy question is whether to get the RAM upgrade or not.\n\nA: No it is not enough to have 4GB, since it is minimum you can have and you will always run at max of it.\nMavericks will do the best to manage the space, but there is a limit what it can do.\nBig RAM users (aside of the OS) are the web browsers.\nIt is all dependent what is your activity, apps you use. As said Mavericks will do great job in working your RAM to keep it to a workable levels, but adding RAM can only help.\nHere is an example from my MBA with 4GB.\n\nAnd the top 10 totaling 1.5GB  (as you can see I do not run RAM heavy apps but do get over 4GB.\n\nYes, do the RAM upgrade, it is worth the money.\n", "Q: speed up launchctl execution I've set up a bunch of scripts that need to happen when I connect my thunderbolt dock at home (disable wifi, enable bluetooth, ...).\nTo detect the thunderbolt dock I make use of the following launchctl service:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>                                                                   \n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>romeovs.dock.agent</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>/Users/romeovs/.bin/dock/run.sh</string>\n    </array>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n    <true/>\n    <key>LaunchEvents</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>com.apple.notifyd.matching</key>\n        <dict>\n            <key>com.apple.system.config.network_change</key>\n            <dict>\n                <key>Notification</key>\n                <string>com.apple.system.config.network_change</string>\n            </dict>\n        </dict>\n    </dict>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThis service listens to launchd for a network change to happen (detecting the wired network that is connected to the dock). This setup seems to work but it is really slow to detect and act when the dock is connected.\nIt already takes a long time for the dock network to be set up, but after that it also takes another 5 seconds before the script actually gets called.\nIs there a way to make the service detect the network changes any faster (without setting up a polling service)?\n\nA: The delay is most likely to be within the notification centre; the notifyd service is not time critical.\nConsider using a process observing IOKit level notifications. At the IOKit layer notifications are immediately dispatched and designed for processes reacting to hardware changes.\nTrying using Growl and the HardwareGrowler addition to trigger your script.\n", "Q: How would my friend install my iOS application without App Store? I am developing my first serious application for iOS and I am doing it for my friend (not for public use). So it will be a gift. Now question:\nHow would my friend be able to instal this application? Is there any easy way to share my app with him? I am very confused on how I can share my app on private basis with few people only and how they can easily install it.\n\nA: You can share apps you develop by means of Ad-Hoc distribution. This involves adding the UDID of their device to your developer account (and consequently a provisioning profile) which lets you install the app on devices outside of the App Store.\nFor more information on Ad-Hoc distribution, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/TestingYouriOSApp/TestingYouriOSApp.html\nApple does not operate a private App Store for non-apple use other than the custom business store and it's unlikely individuals would be accepted into that program so you have to self host the content as described above. \n\nA: There should be a button to generate a code that allows you to download the app from the App Store for free somewhere in the developer panel.\n", "Q: Activity indicator in status bar continues after app download is complete Why does the activity indicator in the top left corner in the status bar continue to turn after the app download is complete? (iPad 2)\n\nA: Some apps will continue the download verification and the unpacking and Installation process after the download shows to be done, leading to the wheel continuing to spin till the process is completed.\n", "Q: iCloud preference pane loads indefinitely and prevents access to System Preferences When I open System Preferences, it opens straight to the iCloud pane, which loads a spinner, states that it is loading, and then runs until I give up.

Is there any way to disable the pane or this behaviour?\n\nA: Launch Activity Monitor (in /Applications/Utilities) and look for a process named \"com.apple.preferences.icloud.remoteservice\".  Select it, click the little stop sign with the x inside it, and select \"force Quit\".\n", "Q: Safari SSL Errors What led to the problem\nWhile I was trying to fix the Github SSL error caused by the DigiCert certificates, I deleted some of the certificates in the \"Keychain Access\" application. By doing this I broke my SSL certificates and now I am facing some serious problems. Initially I was not even able to connect to websites such as Facebook or Github because there was some trust issues. I fixed this issue but it seems that I am missing something.\nCurrent problem\nThe problem occurs only with safari. I have tested with the Chrome browser and there was no issue. When I access the Github website (the only website I know that cause the error), I get in my error console a couple of errors similar to this one: \n\nFailed to load resource: An SSL error has occurred and a secure\n  connection to the server cannot be made. (https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/modules/home/gh-windows-app.png)\n\nThis error affect the style of the page, there is no CSS or any image that is loaded on the Github page.\nReferences\nHere is my console output when I try to access the Github page:\n\nHere is the list of my DigiCert certificates:\n\nThank you for your help!\n\nA: If you've deleted the root certificates from your keychain, the easiest way I know to fix this is to reinstall.\nWhen you visit a website, the browser checks the \"chain of trust\" of the website certificate. Basically it checks to see who has signed the certificate. If the root certificates are gone it won't recognise any of the common authorities like Verisign, Commodo, etc as being trusted.\nAnother option might be to download and reinstall a recent OS update from Apple as suggested here https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/123151/4007.\n\nA: I know that this is a closed thread, but I've found a simpler solution.\nGo to https://www.digicert.com/digicert-root-certificates.htm and download all the root certificates and manually add them to your System keychain. (double click)\n", "Q: What does the “Current Period” data usage number mean? In the Settings app, under Cellular > Cellular Data Usage, I see a “Current Period” value of 6.8 GB. However, I’ve checked this number several times over the years, at all different points in my cellular billing cycle, and it always hovers around 6 GB. Is this really the amount of data that I’ve transferred using my data plan since my last bill? If not, what does the number mean?\n\nA: Current Period refers to the period of time since the last reset. This is nothing to do with the cellular plan. You can see the beginning date of the current period by scrolling to the bottom and looking at the date under the reset option.\nIf you have never reset the counter, it has been counting up like the odometer of a car since you started the OS at a clean restore.\n", "Q: How do I set video recording rate to 60 fps or 120 fps and change between the two? How do I set video recording rate to 60 fps or 120 fps and change between the two? I'm looking to be able to use different FPS rates when recording video with the iPhone 5s.\n\nA: the only option using the iphone's camera is by switching between Slow-Mo and Video modes. You can then speed up a Slow-Mo video to normal speed in the photos app pretty easily. You can't convert normal videos to Slow-Mo.\nThere are probably a ton of apps that offer a bit more manual configuration than that. But I don't know of them.\n\nA: There isn't a way to switch between recording frames per second whilst recording, or to record at 60fps at all. Recording with the video mode will record at 30fps and recording with the slow-mo mode will record at 120fps. This 120fps footage can be slowed to 60fps, or simply by removing frames as 30fps footage is recorded, in post processing.\n", "Q: iCloud won't transfer manually added music I have 2 computers on which I listen to my music: a Macbook Pro (which I consider to be my \"main\" computer for my music library) and a Windows 7 desktop, for which the music library was originally populated via iCloud.  Both of them are up and running with iCloud and have been for a long time.  When I rate a title on one, the rating appears on the other.  When I buy a song on iTunes, it downloads to both.  Great.\nBut if I manually add a song to either library, it won't transfer to the other.  Instead, the song is visible on the other computer, but is greyed out and never downloads (or even becomes available for download).  The songs are remixes from music enthusiasts, so they will never be matched by iTunes Match, but that shouldn't keep them from moving to my other devices, should it?\nDoes anyone know what is keeping it from transferring, or how I might fix it?\n\nA: I realise this is months late, but iTunes was never designed to synchronise Libraries in that way. iTunes Match is the closest you will get to automatic synchronisation.\nThe simplest way to do it is to manually add to each Library. \nEven if both Libraries use the same actual source, such as NAS storage, or one of the 2 machines you mention, the Playlist data will not update to reflect the addition of a tune to the other machine - the file would be there, but the player wouldn't realise.\nIt is possible to manually transfer the playlist from one machine to another in such a case, but it needs re-syncing every so often, it can't be automated. The file-paths are absolute rather than relative, so this requires some patience & a lot of find/replace, then must be re-imported to the other machine. For your scenario I don't think that would be the way to go, but I can add instructions to this answer if you need.\n", "Q: Is it safe to store a mac pro at a tilt? MY daughter is going to college and I have been looking for a safe to store it. Most safes are 12.6 inches wide and her mac pro is slightly less than 13 inches, is it OK to store at a slight tilt?\n\nA: Yes - the only problems with storing the Mac Pro are exceeding the temperature ranges or very hard drops. It's an amazingly solid machine, but at some point anything will break if dropped or shocked hard enough. Also, the Mac Pro is 9.9 inches tall and 6 inches in diameter, so you might fit it in quite nicely in a 12 inch safe since the longest dimension of the unit is 11.9 inches.\n\nYou might also look at the Apple lock for the Mac Pro and leave it anchored with a robust cable to a secure anchor.\n", "Q: Error trying to make bootable Mavericks USB drive \nMBP 5,3 running 10.9.4 trying to make a bootable USB 2 drive b/c my wife's HDD on a similar MBP failed.

Have tried to erase, partition, repair, etc both USB drives in Disk Utility.\n\nA: There is an automation tool called DiskMaker X. All you need for the program to work is the disk image that you are trying to make a usb of. It does all the work for you.

I am using Emacs 24.3 on Mac OS X 10.9.4 and I am trying to edit /etc/profile with that. It obviously does not work when starting the GUI version, but for some reason, it also does not work when starting it with sudo from the command line. When I run\nsudo emacs /etc/profile\n\nfrom the terminal, Emacs still complains that the file is in read-only mode and it cannot write it:\nBuffer is read-only: #<buffer profile>\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: /etc/profile is set to read-only for all users, so just using sudo won't help.\nWhat you can do:\n\n\n*\n\n*run sudo emacs /etc/profile\n\n*type C-x C-q to toggle readonly mode within Emacs\n\n*edit whatever you want\n\n*type C-x C-s to save it\n\n\nAlternatively you can run\nEDITOR=emacs sudo -e /etc/profile\n\nwhich automatically creates a temporary copy of the file you want to edit (which makes it a bit safer in case you want to cancel the update).\n", "Q: How to run apple and custom git side-by-side I have installed the Apple Developer Tools 5 on Mac OS X 10.9.4 which comes with Git:\ngit version 1.8.5.2 (Apple Git-48)\n\nI also have installed Git 2.0.1 using the Mac OS X installer. How do I best set it up so that all applications use Git 2.0.1 by default? I could exchange the Apple Git binary for a symlink to the custom one. Alternatively I would have to modify the PATH so that it looks up the custom Git first. Is there any reason to prefer one over the other?\nAlso, is that even a safe thing to do? Would anything, for instance XCode, break if I replaced Apple Git with Git 2.0.1?\n\nA: I've talked about modifying system tools before and the short of it is: don't do it! Things will use the system tools expecting a certain version of a certain tool and if you change that you could break many things.\nInstead, change your path. For example, if your git is located at /usr/local/git/bin/git, add the following to your ~/.bash_profile or equivalent:\nexport PATH=/usr/local/git/bin:$PATH\n\nThis way, you can use your git by running git but the system git will remain available.\n", "Q: iMessage on Mac not working when using VPN iMessage stopped working properly when I use VPN on my Macbook Pro (Mavericks), making me unable to send or receive messages.\nIt says the user is not registered and highlighted in red/pink, but after I disconnect VPN, everything works fine.\n\n\nA: Make sure TCP port 5223 is open through the VPN—this port is required by iMessage.\n", "Q: How do I get rid of errors for disconnected networked drives?

I also get a similar message when opening my Chrome browser. \nI removed these drives (using Finder->Go->Connect to Server) and the problem is still there. I've also checked /etc/fstab, /Volumes, and used the df command although that's pretty much the same as checking fstab.\nIt appears that the drives are completely disconnected/unmounted, so the problem is that I'm still getting the error pop-ups.

However, that drive eventually died, and I replaced it with a 3 TB Western Digital NAS.\nNow, my Parallels VMs run extremely slowly. Actually, to be more specific – they seem to run at normal speed, but take forever to respond to UI inputs (e.g., when I click a button, there's a 30 to 60-second wait before it responds. But once it does, the UI updates smoothly).\nIs there anything I can do to speed up the UI responsiveness, or is this just a side effect of running the VMs off of the NAS?\nI run three different Windows VMs (two Windows 7, one Windows 8), and they're all equally slow, so it's not an issue with just one VM. I also haven't changed any settings or anything else other than moving them from the old FW800 HDD to the NAS.\n\nA: All three of your VMs are stored on your NAS, correct? I am not surprised that they are all slow. You are streaming tons of data over a network and expecting it to work as if it were being used locally.\nVirtual machines perform a lot of disk IO. Using network storage for VHD files and other resources that are used by your VMs is not really a great idea if you need responsiveness. A lot of software has been developed to try and solve the issue of streaming VMs over a network. \nYou may want to look into the many VDI solutions that are available if you really want to continue using your VMs over a network. Just a thought. \nIf this is not a good solution for you, why don't you try keeping a small VHD locally with just the operating system installed on it, and then add the bulk of the storage onto the NAS? That way, the VM would boot/run as quickly as it should (locally), and the majority of your data would reside on the NAS (and be accessible from all VMs and the host OS).\n\nEdit: unless you are connecting your NAS via SATA, in which case I am unsure of a solution to your issue. As soon as I saw \"NAS\" I thought of you streaming your VM images over a network...\n", "Q: Import data from old HDD (on a PC) to new MacBook I'm planning to buy a new MacBook Pro for school next month, and I wanted to know if I can use Migration Assistant or any other tool to get all data from my old hard drive to the new one.\nThe problem is: My old MacBook doesn't work anymore and its not worth repairing it or something like that.\nI took the HDD out of the notebook, and I can access it on my PC.  \nThe OS version it contains is Lion (probably 10.7.2).\n\nA: You should be able to access your hard drive like any external hard drive with a kit that can turn it into an external. Like $30 at best buy. After accessing said drive take the information that you need off of it and then you can either keep it as a back up for those files or reformat it and use it as an external hard drive.\n\nA: To use Migration Assistant, make sure your PC and Mac are on the same Wi-Fi network or, for faster transfers, connect them with an Ethernet cable. \nThen, on the PC, download and install the Windows Migration Assistant. \nRun that app on your PC and Migration Assistant on your Mac. \nFollow the prompts on both computers to transfer your data; for complete details and step-by-step instructions, see About Windows Migration Assistant on Apple’s website. \n", "Q: Returning to First Screen from last Screen in Mission Control I use Mission Control (on a Mavericks running MacBook Air) a lot, and I was looking for a solution to the following scenario:\nI have three (or more spaces open), and I am on the space furthest to the right (the last) in my lineup of spaces.  I want to get to my first space (the one furthest on the left).  Currently, if I try to go right from this last space, nothing happens. Is there a way that if I swipe right from the \"last space\", I can go directly to the \"first space\", and vice-versa?\n\nA: The only way I know to do this is to 3- or 4-finger swipe up for Mission Control (depending on your settings) or use the keyboard shortcut (on my MBP it shares a key with F3), and then select the space that you want.\n\nA: Have you tried enabling keyboard shortcuts for directly accessing spaces by their number?\n\nNo, this won't enable the wrap-around functionality that you specifically asked about, but it will allow you to type ⌃+1 (control+1) to jump from space 3 to space 1. \nYou will need to press fn+⌃+1 if your Mac is set to use the function keys the default way.\n\nA: You can also use ctrl + ⬅︎ or ctrl + ➜ to navigate between screens.  And if you've got a trackpad or Magic Mouse, you can enable \"swipe between full screen apps\" in SysPref to do the same at that @aglasser suggested\n", "Q: Save HTML as PDF without metadata (e.g. date/time, URL) In Safari or Firefox, saving a web page as PDF (⌘P > PDF > Save as PDF...) includes the page's title, URL, page number, and date/time in the resulting PDF.\nIs there a way to generate a PDF without this metadata?\n\nA: Yes.\nBefore you save the PDF select \"Show Details\" and select Safari (or whatever) from the drop down, then uncheck \"Print headers and footers\".\nThen save as PDF.\n\n", "Q: Bootcamp \"No Bootable device\" but windows already installed I had an issue in OSX which meant that I had to erase the OSX partition, and after reinstalling OSX, my bootcamp partition won't load. It's not in the option menu on start up, but is still recognised in start up disk and disk utility. I selected it in startup disk but I got there error mentioned in the title. I can see all my files in finder, but just can't boot into windows. Anyone know what's going on?\nThanks,\nMike\n\nA: Turns out the partition MBR was wiped on the erase and the entire disk became a single GPT with a single hybrid MBR. I had for recreate the Hybrid MBR using FDISK.\n", "Q: Make iMac file structure more like windows I am a web developer that works for a company and I am looking to make my Mac feel more like windows. I am having trouble navigating the file system, I am colorblind and the files are all blue and small (I am most sensitive to blue when it comes to not seeing right).\nHow can I customize my Mac for increased visibility and increased font sizes?\n\nA: If you are referring to the color of the folders in OSX, unfortunately Apple thinks they should be blue. You can use different views to make them nearly any size you like, especially if you choose the icon view. \nHowever, if you want to change the color of the folders, I recommend an app called Folder Magic, that allows you to change the folders to any color you wish:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/folder-magic/id647731944?mt=12\n\nA: To change the size of icons in Finder hit command-J (or navigate to View->Show View Options).  There will be a slider bar with icon size there, make them as big as you want.\nTo change the default folder icons, you can use a program like CandyBar http://www.panic.com/blog/candybar-mountain-lion-and-beyond/ to change the default folder icon for all folders.\n\nA: In a Finder window, choose Show View Options from the View menu. Here you can change the icon and text size of items. Click \"Use as Defaults\" when you're happy with it.\nOpen System Preferences from the Apple menu and then click General. You can set the highlight color to another color besides blue. Check out the other options here as well.\nFinally, still in System Preferences, click Show All and then click Accessibility. Try upping the contrast and exploring the other options here.\n", "Q: Restricting/Disabling imessage capability on my teen's iphone I would like to protect my teen daughter by eliminating the use of imessage on her iphone. We have placed proper limits on her texting and monitor her use through our carrier. Like any resourceful teen, she now uses imessage to reach beyond the boundaries. We wish her to have opportunities to interact with friends via her phone, but we don't want it to go beyond the limits that have been set due to some past inappropriateness. \n\nA: You can disable iMessages by having your teen go to settings and making all the changes she wants to the following items:\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud\n\n*Mail, Contacts, Calendars\n\n*Messages\n\n*Facetime\n\n*Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and Vimeo\n\n\nThen you will want to observe that she turns off iMessages on the device and then lets you turn on restrictions with a PIN that you keep confidential from the teen.\nIn restrictions, under general in the settings app, you will want to prevent changes to Accounts about 2/3 of the way down the screen under ALLOW CHANGES text. Select \"Don't Allow Changes\" and then check that iMessages is now dimmed out in the settings app.\nNow, that will restrict that one app - however there are hundreds of app store apps that allow chatting and you might have to consider also preventing app store installs entirely to mitigate that risk. However, with phones and iPods getting cheaper and cheaper, if a teen wants to communicate, it's going to be hard to prevent that with policies and technological efforts that are more geared for toddlers and pre-teens.\nGood luck reaching some balance of control and trust going forward.\n\nA: To disable iMessage on an iPhone. Within Settings...\n\n\n*\n\n*Go into Messages and turn iMessage off.\n\n*Go into General and Restrictions. Enable Restrictions and enter a passcode, then near the bottom under \"ALLOW CHANGES\" go into Accounts and select \"Don't allow changes\".\n\n\nThe second step is the important one. The first step is easy to reverse, but the second one will prevent anyone from reversing it without knowing the passcode.\n", "Q: Can't see install disc for Linux Mint in VirtualBox Trying to install Mint 17 Cinnamon via VirtualBox on my MBP OSX10.9.4, with  3 different discs (various makes) made on several machines (Win and Linux). I was able to deploy vm with CentOS 6.4 with a similarly made disc without problems. Mint discs get rejected with error \"The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer.\" Any ideas?\n\nA: From your question it sounds like you are downloading the ISO file and burning it to a CD or DVD. This isn't necessary.\nDownload the ISO file from the Mint website.\nThen within VirtualBox create a new VM entering the various properties like memory size,  hard drive, etc.\nOnce the VM is created, open up the Settings for the VM, go to the Storage tab and select the Empty CD drive. Click the light CD image on the right hand side and select \"Choose a virtual CD/DVD disk file...\". Then locate and select the ISO image you downloaded from the Mint website.\n\nClose the Settings dialog and Start the VM. The installer should load and run to start your install.\n", "Q: Macbook Air - Deleting large files but not getting back the space I'm running 10.6.8 on my Macbook Air. I have been archiving lots of large files to an external drive, but after doing so, my computer doesn't recognize that the files/data are gone. Even after a restart.\nI've tried to use iBoost-up to clean things up, and restarted again but my computer acts like I haven't cleared up any space when in fact I have removed close to a dozen gigabytes. I never used Time Machine, the files are archived off my drive. I want the space I freed up to display, but it doesn't!\nDoes anyone know why?\n\nA: Deleting file from Finder moves them to the Trash for recovery.  They're still on your disks taking up space. So you can either empty the Trash in Finder or use rm from terminal to immediately and permanently delete the files.\n\nA: Since the local snapshots for Time Machine were introduced in Lion, that isn't the cause (which is the cause of this for I'd say 3/4 of the Lion or later people with this issue).\nIf you delete the file from unix with rm or by emptying the trash in Finder and you don't recover the space, the disk directory is likely corrupt. You should back up any critical files to another drive or USB or cloud service and then boot from the installation DVD or another 10.6 boot drive and run Disk Utility to repair the drive. Based on what happens during the repair we can add steps if needed but that should show any directory damage and potentially offer to repair it.\n\nA: Once putting the large files in the trash, use the function 'secure empty trash'. This completely erases the files from your hard drive and there is not way of getting it back. Alternatively, you could get this app form the mac app store called Disk diag. Although it is paid, you can completely erase your items from your hard disk. This will also clean your unused files, like catches and trash completely, and scan your hard disk's space.\n", "Q: Secure erase OS X disk via terminal If there's an encrypted (filevault) volume, both of these methods in terminal will erase the given drive. However, what differences exist between the two? Which is more secure?\nOption 1:\ndiskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ Macintosh\\ HD disk22\n\nOption 2:\ndiskutil cs list\n// find logical volume group UUID\ndiskutil delete *UUID*\n\n\nA: I think the most secure way is to use diskutil zerodisk and then follow up with either command. Both of those commands remove the reference to logical structure on the disk but a good file recovery tool would still be able to recover most material on the unstructured volume by matching file templates to successive sets of bits. You want to write over everything with 0s or garbage before you dereference the volume.\nUPDATE: It was negligent of me not to mention that diskutil secureErase also exists and it combines the two commands with options for multiple passes of zeroing the disk.\n", "Q: App Store constantly tries to charge me for nothing I have a virtual-credit card provided by my Bank, it is only chargable when i allow it (for a limited time.). \nRight now, i am not purchasing anything, and i don't have any subscriptions to any app. I am just trying to download and install Flickr mobile app, but app store keeps asking for my credit card details (which are current but not-chargable because i didn't allow it) and saying the card has insufficient funds. \nThe card is clearly being tried to pay for something but thanks to virtual-card I'm not paying, this is something apple should fix.\nBut the problem is, since i am not paying for whatever it is, i can't download any app from the store, every app is trying to charge me, right now. how do i fix this? And how do i fix being constantly charged? \nPS:\nThis has happened to me before, that time i transferred a little amount of fund and the card is actually charged for like 2$ (afaik). \n\nA: The reason why you are getting these messages when your card is empty is that they are trying to make an authorisation hold to confirm your account details. It's standard practice. If you do see these small amounts appear on your card statements, you should see a similar transaction reversing the hold a short time later.\nFrom Apple's support website:\n\nIf you update your billing information, the iTunes Store or Mac App Store will place an authorization hold on your payment card account, usually in the amount of 1 USD or the local currency equivalent, to verify your account information.\nYou might see authorization requests on your online statement. These requests aren't actual charges; they are tests to confirm that your payment card account is active and has available funds to accommodate transactions. Authorization holds are removed by your financial institution shortly after your purchase clears. The time it takes to remove authorization requests varies by financial institution.\n\n", "Q: Macbook pro - does time machine restore to original state or just add removed files? Macbook pro OS X 10.9\nIf I backup using time machine and 3 months later decide to restore it back because I have a virus, would it be able to eliminate the virus? Also does time machine delete all the new files i've added since then?\n\nA: If you believe your Mac has a virus or any kind of malware you should clean your Mac using a piece of software designed to remove malware. Time Machine isn't intended to be used to remove malware. There is nothing to stop a piece of malware from infecting your Time Machine backups.\n", "Q: \"Command not found\" when attempting to cd in Terminal I am getting errors trying to set up web starter kit via Terminal.

It represents the unix prompt.\nSo, instead of\n$ cd web-starter-kit/app\n\nyou should use\ncd web-starter-kit/app\n\n\nA: It looks like you are appending '$' to the start of all the commands you are running. That is why bash is saying it can't find the $ command.\nFor example, try just cd web-starter-kit/app instead of $ cd web-starter-kit/app.\n\nA: Already answered above but just give a little more context - the error message tells you what is wrong:\n-bash: $: command not found\n\nfor instance:\nPROMPT> foo\n-bash: foo: command not found\n\nOften README files or tutorials will prefix commands with a '$' to indicate whatever you have as your UNIX prompt. You're not meant to type them.\n", "Q: What is the complete, authoritative way in which Mac OSX 10.9 and later builds its PATH? I have read just about every article on this subject.  To wit, I know about:\n\n\n*\n\n*launchctl setenv\n\n*/etc/launchd.conf\n\n*/etc/paths\n\n*/etc/paths.d/*\n\n*/etc/profile\n\n*/etc/bashrc\n\n*~/.profile\n\n*~/.bashrc\n\n*~/.MacOSX/environment.plist\n\n*~/Library/Preferences/.MacOSX/environment.plist\nLet's start whittling all this craziness down:\n\n\n*\n\n*From other reading, I know that on Mavericks anything that relies on an environment.plist is no longer supported or read.\n\n*I know that /etc/profile erases any PATH previously set by launchctl setenv or present in /etc/launchd.conf, and uses a default set of paths appended with anything found in /etc/paths.d/* and /etc/paths.\n\n*I also know that applications launched via Spotlight or the Dock obviously don't read your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc.\n\n\nThat leaves launchctl setenv and /etc/launchd.conf (same thing, really).\nAt any rate, in my case I find that in a Terminal window—I should stress I have none of the following files: ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc, ./bash_profile—I find that the output of env | grep PATH has /opt/subversion/bin appended to the end of it.  This string does not show up in any of the sources listed above, so it must be coming from somewhere else.  I was not aware of there being anywhere else for it to come from.\nSo then: how does Mac OS X Mavericks build its PATH variable?\n\nA: You're trying to understand the theory and that's great.  I'll just say that from practical experience, you can modify .bashrc, .profile and/or .bash_profile and the path setting will stick.  I prefer ~/.profile simply out of habit.  My teammates all use .bash_profile.  Either way it works as long as you pay attention to the order of processing precedence.\nHere are a few other thoughts on the matter:\n\n\n*\n\n*Homebrew wants me to amend my PATH (stackoverflow)\n\n*How to correctly add a path to PATH (stackexchange)\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: How to sort remixes under remix artist name in iTunes Is there some way to sort remixed versions of songs in iTunes under the remix artist's name?\nAs an example, Adventure Club has made a lot of songs that are remixes. For now, all these songs appear under the original artist's name with \"(Adventure Club remix)\" after the song name. However, I would like for all the songs by Adventure Club (remix or not) to appear under the artist, Adventure Club.\nI do know of one way to make this work:\nI can put the remix artist as the \"Album Artist\". This way the original artist's name is preserved, but the remix will sort under the remix artist's name. However, (and maybe I'm just being way too picky here) there are some cases where either (1) the song actually appears on an album by the original artist or (2) the song does not actually appear on an album at all. In these cases, putting the remix artist as \"Album Artist\" is inaccurate.\nThus, is there any other way to sort remixed versions of songs in iTunes under the remix artist's name?\n\nA: How about creating a Smart Playlist (File->New->Smart Playlist...)?  \nYou might set it up to Match Any, with a couple of rules: 1) Artist/contains/\"Adventure Club\" and 2) Album Artist/contains/\"Adventure Club\".  (Without the quotes.)\n\nA: It seems that there is currently no other way to make this work, other than the workaround solution posted in the question above.\nTo restate the solution:\n'' I can put the remix artist as the \"Album Artist\".

In these cases, putting the remix artist as \"Album Artist\" is inaccurate. ''\nIt seems as though I will have to deal with the small inaccuracies that this solution causes. At least the sorting of songs by artist will make more sense.\n\nA: A simple (but rudimentary) workaround that I use is to set the remix artist as the artist and set the original artist as the composer.\nI also parenthetically note the original artist in the track title for easy visualization.\nSo Get Info window in iTunes looks like:\n\n\n*\n\n*song name: some track title (somebody 1)\n\n*artist: somebody 2\n\n*composer: somebody 1\n\n*year...\n\n\nDunno if that works for anyone else, but it has served me well.\n", "Q: How do I make a contact in Google Contacts show up on my phone? I have my Google Contacts synched with my phone. I see all my contacts except the one that I need. I can go to https://www.google.com/contacts/#contact/18f963d78b764fd6 and see the contact in my account, but it is not showing up in my phone! I killed the phone app, turned off Google Accounts then back on, changed from Fetch to Manual then back, searched by name (both first and last), but no luck.\n\nA: I've needed to goto my Google Contacts and add the person to the built-in \"My Contacts\" group. I haven't found the \"My Contacts\" option in the preview of Google's updated (for 2015) Contacts preview.\nGoogle Support: Sync contacts with your phone\n\nA: Well, I am not entirely sure why a specific Google contacts will not show up on your iPhone, however, here's a workaround so you can make the son of a gun appear on the iPhone and in your Google account at the same time (the end result is the same as to what you want to achieve). \n\n\n*\n\n*On your iPhone go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars and under Contacts, make sure that the default account is set to Gootle\n\n*Now create a new contact and manually add the same data as the one appearing for the Google contact in question > Save that contacts on the iPhone\n\n*Delete the already-existing contacts from your Google account and let the newly-created duplicate stay\nAt the end, you have the contact appear under both your iPhone and Google account and be synced.\n", "Q: How to upgrade my Mac Pro to an OS newer than 10.6.8? I have a Mac Pro running Snow Leopard. I tried upgrading to Mavericks, but the App Store won't let me download it. It directed me to this page. At first I thought it was because I was out of space (8GB required) so I deleted some things. Now I have 8.17GB available with 5GB of RAM (2GB minimum). The only thing I can think of is that my Mac Pro is arbitrarily too old. However, I don't know how to confirm that. I'm not even sure if there are any upgrade options available. What do I need to do?\n\nA: It sounds like your Mac Pro is not supported (too old?) by a newer OS than 10.6.8.\nCheck by looking in the System Information app, to see what version of Mac Pro it is. Supported versions are \"MacPro3,1\" or greater. Unsupported versions are MacPro1,1 or MacPro2,1.\nThe reason why the older models are not supported is not arbitrary - it's because the first models had a 32-bit EFI, and the later ones have a 64-bit EFI. The later operating systems require a 64-bit EFI.\n\nA: I have an old Mac Pro myself. It's an Early 2008 (aka a MacPro3,1). Please verify that your Mac meets this criteria or is newer than that.\nYou can check what model you have click on the Apple icon in the menubar (top-left on you screen) and click \"About This Mac\" > \"More Info\".\nThere select the Hardware tab (I think it's preselect) and check your Model Identifier.  Also see this video tutorial.\nYou can use MacTracker to search for it and get the new name scheme with 'Model Name (Year)' out of it and compare it with the list of compatible model you linked to.\nAnd, … if your Mac meets the minimum criteria, you could try freeing up some more space (maybe around 500 MB) to be on the save side. Then try again.\nBasically if you got a MacPro1,1 (~August 2006) or MacPro2,1 (~April 2007) you're not officially supported and I would advice against trying to upgrade your Mac forcefully since compatibility issues would arise regularly. Anyway, if you still want to check out one of the tutorials you'll find when searching for \"upgrade old mac to mavericks\".\n", "Q: Siri: play all songs NOT shuffled Does anyone know a way to ask Siri on iPhone or iPad to play an artist, but have the songs go in album order instead of shuffled?\nI have tried asking \"don't shuffle\" and \"play X in order\" and also \"play albums by X\"...\n\nA: By default it will shuffle it, you may have better luck asking Siri to play a playlist instead.\n", "Q: How do I mount Ext4 using OS X Fuse I installed OS X Fuse on OS X 10.9.4  as outlined in http://osxdaily.com/2014/03/20/mount-ext-linux-file-system-mac/\nUnfortunately it does not mount any of my Linux filesystems (on external HD or SD card), either directly or with Disk Utility\nHas anyone had any success with this? I note a few others seem to have similar problems.\nIs any other package required?\nNOTE I can read the data on a Linux machine, so do NOT want other suggestions, but it would be convenient to read on my Mac.\n\nA: Download and install FUSE-Ext2 as described here and then run something like\nmkdir /Volumes/Linux\nsudo mount -t fuse-ext2 /dev/disk2s6 /Volumes/Linux\n\nYou can figure out the device from looking at the output of diskutil list.\n\nA: If you only want read support then ext4fuse can do this job. If you already have homebrew then you can install it with:\nbrew install Caskroom/cask/osxfuse\nbrew install ext4fuse\n\nafter installation, simply run:\nmkdir /Volumes/Linux\next4fuse /dev/diskXsY /Volumes/Linux\n\nwhere diskXsY can be found by entering the command diskutil list.\nThere is currently no write support in ext4fuse.\n\n⚠️ NOTE: by default you'll only be able to mount and see your files with sudo.

I'm running iOS 6.* on an IPhone 3Gs.\nI noticed that Facebook was talking about redacting support for messaging inside the Facebook app... \nThis slightly bothered me, considering I am Quite happy using SMS for instant messaging, and Facebook for less frequent chat.\nRegardless of how I feel, I now see that they are \"Forcing\" users over to their secondary Messenger application... which seems to be quite the ignorant move on their part-\nWhen I went to the appstore to download the new messenger application... I found out that it was only supported in iOS7...\nWill we really no longer be able to send and receive messages using Facebook on anything but the latest model phones? \nSeeing as how they are doing the same on Android, and Seeing as how I wasn't offered to use a version of Facebook Messenger that was supported by iOS 6.*...\nThey can't really be considering dropping all support for any \"older\" model phone, can they? that is more than just stupid, it's plain cynical. \nThe tech enthusiast in me wants to believe their is a work around for this, or something I have simply over looked. but the conspiracy theorist in me wants to scream out about how this feels like they are trying to coerce mobile device owners to upgrade their phones.\nIt just doesn't feel fair, or even logical, that iOS 6.* should not support a basic messaging application.. especially one from a Company such as Facebook. they certainly have the wherewithal to support development of multiple versions of an applications.\nare they really so out of touch that they could not possibly fork their app in the development repository, and build a release supporting the ios 6.* API/SDK?\nin short (and minus the rant), does anybody else have this concern? does anybody know how to work around this issue? does anybody actually know how to contact Facebook in order to complain?\n\nA: The mobile site will still allow you to send/receive messages in Safari and other browsers. It may also be that the version of the app you are using is so old that they cannot prevent the messenging functionality from working; you'll have to wait to see about that or dig up user comments on the topic from Europe, which was pushed into this model in the spring. \nConsidering that the public's response to this news has been almost uniformly negative, I think it's reasonable to suspect that this policy change may be reversed after the numbers are crunched and usage declines become obvious. The primary point of splitting the apps is to increase revenue by doubling the ads the users are forced to see; if people stop using the original app and refuse to download the messenger app, this plan backfires.\n", "Q: TIme Machine IP Change Loses Backup History I have a time machine setup where the backup location is on a Synology NAS drive; having recently moved house, and ended up with a different router, I setup the NAS drive again, and it has a different IP address (formerly in the 10.* range, now in the 192.* range).\nI couldn't - no matter what I tried - get Time Machine on the iMac to recognise the drive as the existing TM location; despite it showing up as an available disk in TM preferences. In the end, I deleted the old backups (nothing required from them yet, so it won't hurt to start again, I suppose). What I'd like to know, for future reference, is if/how I can get TM to recognise the NAS as the backup location if the IP address changes again. None of the hardware changed, so I can't see why this was an issue.\n\nA: The new router (the hardware did change) is obviously using one of the default 192.* ranges instead of the 10.* range the old router was using. Your iMac and NAS picked up an address in the new IP range, (that's why the iMac could 'see' the NAS,) but because the IP in the NAT changed, Time Machine failed.\nWhen you change routers in the future, you should make sure the iMac and NAS pick up an IP in the same range as the old router so there is no mismatch.\n", "Q: Prevent iPhone charger from capturing audio My car has an USB connection which I use to connect to my iPhone 4s (with iOS 7.1) as a charger. But the connection also captures audio, so no sound is emitted from the iphone when the usb wire is connected.\nIs there any way to control what's the Iphone behaviour when an external device is switched on, just to avoid the audio to be captured?\n\nA: For a solution that doesn't require jailbreaking and modifying your phone's OS, I would suggest a USB charge-only dongle, like this one or this.\nInsert that on the USB end of your cable, and it will only connect the charging pins, not the data pins, preventing any audio or other data from transferring.\n\nA: Have you checked the Control Center for Airplay devices? Normally all Audio capturing devices are listed there. You can check by opening Control Center (swipe up from the bottom) while connected. Now there should be an Airplay Icon and some text \"AirPlay\". I'm not really sure where exactly it is on an iPhone 4S, I believe somewhere at the bottom. Tap on the icon and you'll get all AirPlay devices connected to the iPhone listed. There select \"iPhone\" to select the iPhone as the output. I hope I could help,\nGeF\n\nA: After googling a while finally I came up with the solution.\nThe file /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.iapd.plist seems to track external devices connected to the iphone. If this file is removed, these devices cannot be selected by Airplay.\nI'm not sure which are the implication of removing that file and if I restore it, the Airplay functionality would be restored as well, but the fact is it works.\nI don't also understand why Apple has not foreseen the possibility of select iphone speakers instead of remote audio even though a dock connector is plugged. Some reason must exist, but it's difficult to understand.\nObviously you need to jailbreak the iphone to remove that file. I simply use a ssh client to do it.\n\nA: I had the same problem. Docking or cancel, no other options. Like most issues with my iPhone, shutting down fixed it.\n", "Q: Acknowledging an Exchange calendar response triggers a new invitation I have Calendar connected to an Exchange 2010 server. I created an event with several (~40) persons. When someone answers I sometimes (not always) have a notification in Calendar with an \"OK\" button.\nIf I click \"OK\" the invitation is sent again to everybody.\nI also noticed that sometimes when I snooze an alarm the other invited persons receive a notification per email.\nEdit 1\nThis happens with each and every event that I create on Exchange, not only the example above.\nEdit 2\nIs there a way to solve the problem?\nOr is there a way to gather more information (for example logs)?\nEdit 3\nI just noticed that when clicking on \"OK\"\n\nCalendar sends an email to the attendees (I found it in the \"Sent\" folder) with the invitation attached (which makes no sense).\nBEGIN:VCALENDAR\nMETHOD:REQUEST\nPRODID:Microsoft Exchange Server 2010\nVERSION:2.0\nBEGIN:VTIMEZONE\nTZID:W.

I have had same issue a while ago, and decided not to change stuff via an Apple device.\nI know it's not the answer you were hoping for, but's the reality at this moment.\n\nA: Heres a long shot in the Calendar.app prefs at the bottom of the Advanced pane, do you have checked:\nAsk before sending changes to events\n\nFrom what I understand this prevents messages being sent  other people when you make changes. It may include invitations\n\nA: I have this exact problem too. Apple Calendar + Office 365 Exchange = spam all your invitees when you are the organizer of an event and you confirm/snooze a notification of an event.\nI've stopped using it and rely only on Outlook for Mac instead.\n\nA: It seems that it was a bug and that it will be fixed with OS X 10.11.0 and iOS 9.\nSince the first public beta (on both iOS and OS X) the problem disappeared (without any change on my side).\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Audio Jack Delay I have the MacBook Pro & Retina(2012s) running on Mavericks, both seem to be exhibiting a delay when headphone/speaker is connected to the Audio Jack. I've read the thread on the apple forums and it seems this is a normal event, but I find it very intruding especially when I switch sources from headphones to speakers at outdoors.\nBut, while using bootcamp this delay doesn't seem to occur and I guess all these are managed at kernel/OS level.\nThe reason stated at the forums was quite inadequate, because the smartphones today have similar jacks (Audio In/Out) and the switching happens quite fast.\nWould like to know if it was possible to tweak this event.\n\nA: I have a very similar issue on my 2012 retina display MacBook Pro.  Since the latest update 10.9.4 there has been a delay in the volume adjustments for both the speakers and headphone jack when using the volume buttons on the keyboard. The delay is of 3 or 4 seconds. I can bypass this delay using the volume adjustment on my menu bar at the top right of my screen.\n", "Q: Solving: Unable to add server. The plugin encountered an error processing request. (10001) How do I join an Active Directory domain when I get the 10001 error? What is the real cause of the failure?\nThis question is about the famous failure to join an Active Directory from OS X which seems to appeared somewhere around 10.7 or so, but which seems to still be consistent, even with 10.9 or 10.10 (beta).\nAssumptions:\n\n\n*\n\n*ABC hostname of the OS X machine\n\n*EXAMPLE.COM is the domain to be joined (not a .local domain) \n\n\nChecklist (collected from various sources)\n\n\n*\n\n*Current OS X username does is admin and does not overlap with an AD username.\n\n*OS X hostname resolves with the DNS of the domain to be joined to (ABC.EXAMPLE.COM). Test that it works from other machines too. This is a documented reason for failure to join on Linux machines, tested it myself and solving this solved the problem on Linux.\n\n*Machine is on LAN during the Join (better to disable Wireless while doing this)\n\n*AD user is allowed to add machines to the domain. In some cases this does not require the user to be an Admin (that's my case)\n\n\nIn progress (bring more info and a full join script with debug logging)\n\n    8544.14278, Node: /Active Directory, Module: ActiveDirectory - Authenticate to LDAP using Kerberos credential - 0\n    8544.14278, Node: /Active Directory, Module: ActiveDirectory - verified connectivity to '10.80.0.150' with socket 13\n    8544.14278, Node: /Active Directory, Module: ActiveDirectory - Computer account either already exists or DC is already Read/Write\n    8544.14278, Node: /Active Directory, Module: ActiveDirectory - Adding record 'cn=nibbler,OU=MAC Machines,OU=EMEA,DC=example,DC=com' in 'example.com'\n    8544.14278, Node: /Active Directory, Module: ActiveDirectory - ODNodeCustomCall failed with error 'Plugin error' (10001)\n\n\nResources:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/message/17793818\n\nA: in my case, I got this error when tried to Bind MacBook Pro to Windows Domain. I had to shorten Mac Computer name by few characters to make it work. I guess there is a limitation in Windows AD on computer names.\n\nA: In my case, I found the issue to be with how long the username I was trying to use was.  Once I shortened it by one character, it worked. \n\nA: I got this problem this afternoon and was able to resolve it after some googling and poking around local setup.  Here is what I found.\nThere is very informative discussion here,  unfortunately I did not have enough patience to try every single thing suggested there, and found that solution to my problem was listed there towards the end of discussion.\nWhat really helps to understand what's going on is to enable debug logging of directory issues using this command\nodutil set log debug\nthen run this command in a terminal window to see logs:\ntail -f /var/log/opendirectoryd.log\nremember to turn it off after you done using this command:\nodutil set log default\nOnce you have logging turned on,  use dsconfigad to join your Mac to the domain.  Command line tool is more flexible than GUI, it provides a lot of options that control tons of minute details of domain joining process.  More information about the tool is here.  \nUsing both of these tools I saw that my problem of joining the Mac to the domain was caused by the tool not being able to create computer account in the Active Directory.  Once I created the account by hand and tried to join domain again the tool informed me that the computer account already exists, and asked whether I wanted to re-use it.  After answering yes the tool proceeded and successfully joined the domain. \n\nA: I'm having exactly the same issue and we're using Windows Server 2008. Not R2. We have plans to upgrade to 2012 soon. Interestingly, we've added Macs to the domain before without problems. I had the same error yesterday and, after removing the Client Computer Name from the DNS records and waiting overnight, I was able to successfully join another Mac.\n\nA: We cant add mac machine on domain controller installed on OS windowserver 2003 and less..update os to 2008 or more\nHope this may help\n\nA: firs step Check the date and time of the AD and your compiuter\n", "Q: Safari 7.0.5 on 10.9.4 fails to check code-signing I noticed that the Little Snitch's Research Assistant told me that the signature for Safari was invalid so i ran codesign to check and in fact i got this:\ncodesign -vvvv /Applications/Safari.app/\n--validated:/Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/SafariForWebKitDevelopment\n/Applications/Safari.app/: a sealed resource is missing or invalid\nfile modified: /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/InfoPlist.strings\nfile modified: /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/ServicesMenu.strings\n\nIs this dangerous? I found out that this issue could be related to 1Password: https://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/14419/safari-plugin-unverified\nI have 1Password installed but the plugin works, so can someone explain this? Should i worry about?\nEDIT: find another one: Safari seems to be modified\n\nA: I don't think this is dangerous. I don't think you need to worry about it.\nThe affected files are just pairs of strings and the translated version for a particular language. The InfoPlist.strings file contains the file descriptions that appear in the Finder (and other places I assume) for the Document Types that Safari supports, for example \"HTML document\" and \"CSS style sheet\". The ServicesMenu.strings contains a similar short list of the Services provided by Safari, for example \"Add to Reading List\". The two files that are being flagged as modified are a bit boring as they are providing English translations for strings that are already in English. If you check the same files in another language folder within the Safari bundle, like for example French the concept is clearer.\n<key>Web internet location</key>\n<string>Adresse Internet du Web</string>\n<key>Web site URL</key>\n<string>Adresse URL du site web</string>\n<key>Web site location</key>\n<string>Adresse du site web</string>\n<key>Windows icon image</key>\n<string>Fenêtres icône image</string>\n\nWithin the thread discussing 1Password it doesn't appear that the modification was caused by 1Password. In fact it was initially suspected to be the reverse, the discussion in that thread was about whether the modifications were causing a problem with 1Password because someone was having trouble running it. In the end it turned out that the problem with 1Password was caused by Sophos. The modified Safari files had nothing to do with it.\nFor what it's worth I get the same errors when I run codesign against Safari on both my Macs. I tried reinstalling the latest OS X update (which includes Safari 7.0.5) but that made no difference. Even tried repairing permissions (which funnily enough did make one correction to a file in the Safari bundle) but unfortunately didn't resolve this issue.\nUnless you have a problem running Safari or running extensions within Safari, I wouldn't worry about this.\n", "Q: I have a mid-2012 MacBook Air, and the Service Battery alert is showing My 13\" Macbook Air recently started showing the \"service battery\" alert. It's the mid-2012 model, and is still under Apple Care. The alert seems to appear mainly when I'm running off the battery. Is this a battery issue or a bug in the system?\n\nA: If it is still under Applecare I would absolutely get it checked out.  In the very least if there is an issue, you will get the battery replaced under warranty and be able to enjoy a few more years with it.\n\nA: This the battery failing, get it checked out and replaced for free. \n\nA: You don't say what version of OS X you're running, but if it's 10.9, note that other users have reported a change in battery alerts after upgrading to that version.  http://www.zdnet.com/macbook-users-seeing-service-battery-message-after-mavericks-upgrade-7000022588/\nOpen Utilities > System Information, click on \"Power\" in the left column and see what stats show up for your battery.

If the descrete GPU is dead, the these kinds of symptoms appear. If you try to connect an external monitor or use GPU dependent applications, the system will freeze and/or the screen will go black. You have to force shutdown it.\n\nA: Actually you have Kernel Problems, which is bit more serious.\nYou can try repairing the Kernel (Operating system) , or reinstall it.\nOn top of already recommended Graphics fix (off) try following:\nReset your NVRAM/PRAM.\nAlso disable some of your special set ups (if you can live without them) ie. \"X86PlatformShim\"- or fix it. If you use Clover take care of it.\n\nA: After getting many useful suggestions and none of them solving my problem, I went for a logic board exchange. After that I haven't had another blackout, 1.5 weeks and counting.\nSo, in conclusion what looked like a software problem was probably a faulty GPU on the logic board or something on the board that caused the GPU to fail.\nBig thanks to Pratika and esp. Buscar who shared their expertise and helped me move towards the hardware solution. I appreciate it very much.\n", "Q: Remote access with laptop cover down Can someone log on to my laptop if the cover is down?\nI thought by closing the cover it disconnected the internet.\n\nA: There are programs that will allow the system to run with the lid closed, but in general putting the lid down will put the system into a sleep state (allowing some internet access for Power Nap if you have that enabled)\n\nA: If it is disconnected from Internet, than no one can connect to it remotely. There is a setting to wake on Internet access that you can enable or disable.\nIn your system Preferences Energy you will find the setting for Wake for WiFi access.\nTo prevent any unauthorized access make sure all Sharing is disabled in your sys pref sharing.\nClosing the Lid does not shut down the computer. It goes in Sleep/Hibernate modes. It will perform some maintenance and access Internet if it has to, but that is only from your site, not from outside.\n", "Q: How to combine multiple mailboxes in Mail.app? My OS is Mavericks.  The mailboxes shown are grouped under headings MAILBOXES, SMART MAILBOXES, ON MY MAC, and MY EMAIL ADDRESS.  I have Sent and Trash under each.  Their contents are not entirely duplicative.  When I go to mailbox/use this mailbox as, the options are grayed out.  In Preferences/Accounts/Mailbox Behaviors all options are checked to 'store messages on server'.  How do I combine these mailboxes?\nThanks,\nRick\n\nA: In the Menu Bar, go to Mailbox after selecting the sub-mailbox, one of your Sent folders, for instance, and then choose \"Use This Mailbox For…\". You can lump the redundancies together this way, but it's true that you will not be able to completely customize all the boxes. \n\nA: The Mailboxes that are created by Mail app can not be modfied.\nOnly Mailboxes that you created can be modified.\nThus: Inbox, Draft, Sent, Junk, Trash, Archive and \"on My Mac mailboxes\" can not be modified.\n", "Q: How do I recover Game Center password if it's different then my Apple ID password? How do I recover Game Center password if its different then my Apple ID password. This for my sons iPod, he created this account for his games but cant remember the password. I tried the forgot password option thinking it would reset it for him but it didnt since he has his own password for it. How do we find the password he created?\n\nA: This is a common confusion point.\nAll apple accounts are AppleID and you can/should first go try to reset or recover the password for each account at https://iforgot.apple.com\nAny use of Apple accounts on iOS (messages, FaceTime, game center, app store, iCloud) are necessarily first AppleID accounts - so mixing several of these on one device can cause a little confusion on which password belongs to which.\nThere is no Game Center account or password retrieval (nor any other account) other than the main iforgot page. You can go in and check your AppleID and learn more at https://appleid.apple.com\n", "Q: Is deleting the yosemite install partition safe? I got Yosemite via the Apple Beta Program. I installed Yosemite on a separate partition which I had created for the purpose specifically. Now I want to reclaim my 50 GB by deleting the partition. I have already set my startup disk to my original Mavericks partition. \nSo, if I launch Disk utility in Mavericks and delete the Yosemite partition, will my Mac still boot? \nPS: I am not looking to uninstall just yet, but I'm running low on space and might need to get some space back soon enough (before Yosemite gets stable and I get the upgrade). \n\nA: There is no uninstall per-se for any OS X installation. \nYou can just boot into your other OS to test that it boots before deleting your current OS partition. I can't speak to any changes that Yosemite has made to your Mac or the recovery partition, but I'd start with powering it off and then booting while holding the option key. From that boot manager, you can test that your Mavericks partition is working and then decide to delete the other partition(s) or if you need to fix things before getting to a point where you have no bootable volumes. In fact, you can't self delete a running partition so you'll likely have to boot to Mavericks (or Recovery HD) to delete a new install as you have done.\n", "Q: Waking closed lid macbooks using wireless We have carts of MacBooks and MacBook Pros that students use and close the lid and put them back in cart when they are done.  They use wireless networking and don't have USB or displays connected.  I am wondering if there is any way we can wake the MacBook remotely using wireless (WoWLAN?).  We don't want to have the setting where MacBook doesn't sleep when lid is closed.  Is there any way we can wake them on and have them connect to our wireless when their lid is closed?  The remote management software we use couldn't work when they are in the cart overnight.\n\nA: Apple now says yes: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204032\n\nIf your Mac supports Power Nap, these activities can occur while your Mac is asleep:\n  [...]\nMobile Device Management can remotely lock and wipe your Mac. \nAnd these activities can occur while your Mac is asleep and plugged in to an AC power outlet:\nSoftware updates download.\nMac App Store items (including software updates), download in the background.\nTime Machine performs backups.\nSpotlight performs indexing.\nHelp Center content updates.\nWireless base stations can wake your Mac using Wake on Wireless.\n\n\nAssuming Power Nap is on AND the laptop cart is a powered one AND is actually plugged into the wall (yes, that one's from experience), you should be able to reach them remotely. Apple Remote Desktop does with 10.11 and 10.12.\n\nA: No - the only way to wake a Mac when the lid is shut is to connect a USB keyboard and display as described in closed clamshell mode for the specific models of MacBook you have.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3131 - Learn how to use an external display with your Mac notebook while the notebook display is closed\n\n\nUnless your MDM provider somehow modifies the OS to get it to connect during power nap (highly unlikely), then you will need to perform management before they are put in the cart or after they are taken out of the cart.\n", "Q: External display randomly acquires and loses signal under Mavericks 10.9.4 I am trying to use a Planar PXL2790MW external display with my iMac 11,3 (2.93 GHz 27inch) connected by a Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable. \nThe display works intermittently: at random times, it will acquire signal from the computer and then drop it again after anywhere from ten minutes to half an hour. It will report no signal for various lengths of time before briefly coming back on again. Restarting the computer and turning the monitor on and off (in any order) seems to make no difference to whether or not the signal is sent. It seems quite random.\nThe same thing happens both under BootCamp (Win7) and OSX (10.9.4) When the display does have signal, it performs perfectly. During one of the intervals when it was working, I tried to move the cable about vigorously including at the ports, to see if that's the problem; it didn't seem to make a difference.\nI have tried zapping the PRAM and resetting the SMC, to no effect. I have tried detecting the display in Windows when it goes off, also to no effect. \nEdit: I append the Console log for one of these events (a particularly brief one, the monitor is usually lucid for many minutes). The external display, as we can see, is 0x3f003d. It comes on, then eventually state-changes to offline - for no reason that I can discern.\n\n31-07-14 1:03:27.025 PM WindowServer[353]: Received display connect changed for display 0x3f003d\n31-07-14 1:03:27.027 PM WindowServer[353]: Found 111 modes for display 0x003f003d [111, 0]\n31-07-14 1:03:27.028 PM WindowServer[353]: Display 0x003f003d changed state to online\n31-07-14 1:03:27.067 PM WindowServer[353]: MPServiceForDisplayDevice: Invalid device alias (0)\n31-07-14 1:03:27.067 PM WindowServer[353]: Display 0x042735c0: GL mask 0x1;

But I'm pretty sure the solution will still work just as well for Thunderbolt. :)\n\nA: When I was searching for a similar thing myself before, I heard about a bit of a messy solution that will run your code anytime a device is \"Ejected.\"\nWhat they did was find the OSX program that normally performs an USB Eject operation, and renamed it to something like Eject_old. Then they wrote their own program, which first runs the code they want and then calls the Eject_old program.\nThey named this new program whatever the other one was called, so now every time they eject a device it runs their program first. Of course this probably won't help if your dock is disconnected without being ejected first.\nIf you think this might be able to help with what you'd like to do, let me know and I can look into it some more.\n:)\nPS.

You'll probably find that all files within your volume are set with identical \"-rw-rw-rw-\" permissions and all folders are set with identical \"drwxrwxrwx\" permissions.\nSome software for mounting NTFS volumes will allow you to change the these volume wide permissions with arguments to the mount command. For example, with OSXFUSE you can set umask, fmask and dmask arguments when you mount an NTFS volume that will allow you to specify the permissions you want to see. However if there is documentation on how to do this with Parallels Mounter I'm unable to find it.\n", "Q: Time Machine to NAS, over internet I have a Synology DiskStation NAS that I use for Time Machine backups on my LAN. I want to be able to back up when I'm away from home. I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connecting via L2TP VPN running on Synology\n\n*Connecting directly to Synology via AFP\n\n\nThrough both of these methods I can mount the Time Machine share in the Finder, and I've confirmed read/write access to the share when connected over the internet.\nHowever, when I've mounted the share over the internet, and try to \"Back Up Now,\" I get a message that it couldn't find the disk. Even though the disk is mounted.\n\nA: Synology does have this walk-through for doing what you want to do.\nI will mention that (quite some time ago) I used a Synology NAS as a time-machine target disk, and I did get it to work, but found it to be highly error-prone. Not what you want in a backup. Also slow. I'm using a drive with a direct USB3 connection now and am much, much happier with that.\n\nA: This is not a substantial answer, maybe treat it as complementary to the first answer. \nI should expect Time Machine over AFP to be relatively reliable with a LAN, relatively unreliable or impossible when limited to a WAN (wide area network). \nIn the Time Machine Network Interface Specification (TMNIS): Time Machine Server Requirements. I guess that whilst a server may meet those requirements, an aspect of the WAN will defeat a requirement. \nThe size of bands, within a sparse bundle disk image, may be ill-suited to AFP over a WAN. And so on. \n\nA: I wrote a guide to configuring Time Machine to back up to a cloud server which is almost relevant.  And it looks like the DiskStation supports the same IPSec server setup that I'm recommending, so you might be able to crib some parts from my guide to make it work.\nTime Machine over the internet works for me, even over a 1Mbps connection connection.  Though you have to leave your Mac running for a bit longer to make sure each backup completes, so number of completed backups is going to be proportional to that bandwidth.\n", "Q: iCal Sync with Google Apps Other Calendar Our companies email/calendering is run through Google Apps and we all share everyone elses under \"Other calendars\" within the web interface of Google Cal.

I had settled into a nice workflow scanning a few images at a time and using iPhoto to add descriptions and change the dates, thinking that checking the \"modify original files\" box as I did so would in fact modify the original files. Not so.\nI uploaded my first album to Flickr (using the iPhoto share feature, too) and was disappointed that the hundreds of photos from the 90s all have a date of July 30, 2014. Checking the files, there's no EXIF information at all, and the date created/modified are of course still July 30, 2014.\nSo I have three questions and I suppose I'd be satisfied with an answer to any of them:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any way to copy iPhoto date information down to the original file? I don't really want to put tens of hours of work into something not usable outside of iPhoto. I'd prefer this because I'm used to iPhoto now and use it for my modern pictures too\n\n*Is there a way to at least preserve the iPhoto date when sharing to flickr? I was surprised that the built-in share function didn't do so\n\n*Has anyone had any success doing a similar project with software other than iPhoto?\nThank you!\n\n\nA: ExifTool is a perl script that will give you great power in altering Exif data in images: http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/\nIt's also available through homebrew (http://brew.sh):\n$ brew install exiftool\nIf you are at all okay with working in the terminal it is fairly easy to use (and very powerful if you are dealing with lots of images).

I already use DxO Optics Pro for Raw to Jpeg developpment therefore LR would be redundant. So I tried Photo Supreme : not very friendly on the first approach (need to read the whole online help), but once you master it, believe me, your photographer life is changing! It wites all the keywords in the file, does not import the photos (you keep the control) and is very stable...

I select a message -- even a single message not in a larger thread -- and click Message > Remove attachments.  Zing!  The whole message disappears from the inbox.  Then if I search for it, I find it in \"All Messages\", not th e inbox, and it still has the attachments!  Same thing if the message started in SENT -- it gets moved to \"All Messages\".

I have read that you can change all of the three \"computer names\" associated with a Mac using the scutil utility.\nThe three names in question are ComputerName (the \"friendly\" name), LocalHostName (used only by Bonjour) and HostName (which is subsequently returned by /bin/hostname).\nI understand that there are very few side effects from setting the first two.  Obviously if Bonjour clients are out there looking for the old LocalHostName then changing it will be a drag from their perspective, but otherwise this seems pretty side effect free.\nI am no networking guru so the idea of changing what is reported by /bin/hostname is a bit spooky to me.  Should I be concerned?\nFor more background, what is reported by /bin/hostname changes, it seems, currently, with the weather.\nSuppose, for example, my ComputerName is Chuggid (don't ask).  Suppose my LocalHostName is also Chuggid.\nI've found that when I connect to some wifi hotspots, hostname returns chuggid.linksys.  When I am connected to my workplace's VPN, hostname returns things like xyz-abc.vpnpool.yoyodyne.com.\nSo my worry stems from the fact that I'm concerned that since I didn't come up with either of these names, when I arbitrarily decide to set my HostName to chuggid that this will cause all sorts of problems.\nIs it \"safe\" to change all three Mac \"computer names\" to whatever I want?\n\nA: If you haven't already set the HostName yourself using scutil, /bin/hostname is probably reporting the result of a reverse DNS lookup on your computer's IP address. Both the IP address and the result of the reverse DNS lookup will likely differ based on the network you're connected to, and can easily change over time on the same network, too.\nscutil --set HostName foo is a persistent setting, and unlike LocalHostName and ComputerName, HostName cannot be set in the GUI. For that reason, some advise against setting HostName. In my opinion, as long as you don't get confused if you try to make changes through the GUI later, setting your HostName is unlikely to cause any negative side effects for you. However, if you do run into issues, it's easy to undo with scutil --set HostName ''.\n", "Q: Folders with Icons on iOS Recently, I organized all of the apps on my iPad, and came to a realization: it would be great if I could make the folders have their own icons. What I mean is this (right), as supposed to this (left):\n\nI have already looked for some ways to do this, but the only thing I've found is something called is a Cydia tweak called TinyGrid, which does let you customize the icons of the folders, but not change the image for them (you can change the size, etc.). Currently, my iPad is not jailbroken, but if the solution is jailbreak-only, I may be willing to jailbreak it. Thanks in advance for your help.\n\nA: First of all, let me just put this out there: any tweak that tweaks the appearance like this is going to require that you jailbreak ;)\nWhile not exactly what you're looking, A3Tweaks has achieved a somewhat similar alternative to what you're describing! It's called \"Apex 2 (iOS 7)\". It is a paid app, but at $2.99 it's not entirely unreasonable. However, it is slightly different that being just a folder with one icon. Rather than wasting your or my time writing out exactly what it does, what it looks like, or how it functions, you can check out an excellent write-up at iDownloadBlog.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Programming Swift without OS X A friend of mine suggested that I learn Swift, as it would help me get a job that I had applied for, and I thought this was a good idea. The only problem: I don't own a Mac computer, or anything with OS X. Is there any way I can try programming on Swift in a non-OS X environment, like Windows or iOS? Any help would be appreciated. I don't want to have to buy another computer just to learn a language.\n\nA: You can code in Swift language on any platform using a Swift environment hosted on a web site like http://swiftstub.com or http://runswiftlang.com\n\nA: Swift has now been open sourced. From swift.org\n\nOn December 3, 2015, the Swift language, supporting libraries, debugger, and package manager were published under the Apache 2.0 license with a Runtime Library Exception, and Swift.org was created to host the project. The source code is hosted on GitHub\n\nSwift has been ported to OSX and Linux. The Ubuntu compiled version is here.\n\nA: Currently Swift is not available except through Apple's Developer program as part of the Xcode 6 Beta. Rumors seem to suggest that Swift will not be available elsewhere until the beta is finished.\nIf you want to use Swift now, your only option is to emulate/virtualize OS X and run Xcode 6. I do not know the legalities of doing this.\nHowever, when Swift is formally released, I would assume/hope that it will be simply a part of LLVM. If this does happen, then you will be able to use Swift on any platform via LLVM.\nThe Swift API, however, will still exist exclusively on OS X for a while afterwards until someone re-implements it for other platforms.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro cannot automatically detect external monitor automatically after I unplug external monitor when it is sleeping My late-2013 13'' (Retina & OS X 10.9.4 (13E28)) Macbook Pro can not automatically detect external displays after wakes up, if I pull the display‘s plug out during sleep.\n1) connect Macbook to my dell display \n2) put Macbook into sleep state via apple menu\n3) pull the display's plug out while Macbook is sleeping\n4) wake up Macbook\nAfter these procedures above, My Macbook cannot automatically detect the remove of external monitor.

Also, I can manually click Detect Displays to fix this problem.\nI have tried to reset SMC and PRAM but doesn't work.\nBy the way, if I check Mirror Displays checkbox in Display Preferences after I weak up my Macbook from sleep, the system will halt and automatically reboot. I think the reason which causes reboot is the conflict between the system tries to mirror display and there is no one external display.\nDoes anyone experiences the same issue?\nI apologise for my poor English..... \n\nA: I have the same behaviour with exception of the Automatic reboot (it does not do that).\nI explain it this way.\nWhen going to sleep mode Mac will create a Sleep image of the system status/configuration.\nIt is not monitoring the external devices during the sleep.\nIf you disconnect the monitor during the sleep it will not know that.\nWhen it wakes up it will load the sleep image containing the system profile and is looking for the monitor and can not find it.\nSo far everything is normal.\nI do not know why does it reboot on Mirror Display?

I've also tried resetting NVRAM/PRAM.\n\nA: Try using the mini Display Port to the Dell's Display Port.\nThat's how I connect to 2 2560*1440 Dell screens.  \nI've found, in order of reliability  \n\n\n*\n\n*Display Port - works every time  \n\n*DVI - works most of the time, can be fussy on some screens  \n\n*HDMI - haven't used  \n\n*anything  > VGA [barely works at all on anything over 1920*1200]\n\n\nA: Despite several sources & specifications stating it is impossible, I have an HDMI output connected to a Dell U2711 DVI input at 2560 x 1440 via a simple HDMI to single link DVI-D cable, because the Dell U2711 accepts single link ~340MHz HDMI on the DVI-D inputs.\nUnfortunately, manufacturers don't seem to actually tell anyone if a display has this capability - looks like the Dell U3011 and Philips 288p6 do as well.  Good luck confirming this on other monitors.\nHere are the lines you have to read between to figure out what is going on: \nWith some limitations, HDMI and DVI are the same signal. DVI uses dual link (more TMDS pairs) to get higher resolutions, while HDMI ups the per channel throughput with higher cable specs.\nAn Apple HDMI support article tells us that \"MacBook Pro (Retina, Late 2013 and later)\" support 4k (3840 x 2160 x 30Hz, 4096 x 2160 x 24Hz) on HDMI.  This means 2560x1600x60Hz can work and probably will.\nBut HDMI only has pins for a single DVI link (4 TMDS pairs), so even if the DVI end of a cable or adapter shows the extra pins, it's still single link, and as everyone knows, single link DVI only goes up to 1920x1200x60Hz.  Right?  Except...\n\"... many devices output HDMI over a DVI connector [..] and some multimedia displays may accept HDMI (including audio) over a DVI input.\" (Wikipedia HDMI article)\nA hint!  I found confirmation on a random product page on amazon:\n\"Note 1: Resolutions above 1920x1200 60z require monitors to support DVI-D single link speed of 340MHZ, such as Dell U2711 & U3011 and Philips 288p6.\"\n(\"active\" Mini Displayport to DVI adaptor)\nDisplayPort (vs HDMI) still applies here: the adaptor will only work with our \"special\" monitors, because the DisplayPort++ dual-mode (as in LVDS or TMDS, not dual-link!) version 1.1 transmits a single-link HDMI/DVI signal well above DVI single link specs, just like the HDMI output on my MBP.\nBy implication, DisplayPort to HDMI at high res should work, but clearly doesn't a lot of the time - searching Amazon for \"DisplayPort to HDMI 4K\" shows cheap cables and positive anecdotes.  And DisplayPort to DVI-D single-link might work at higher resolutions if you have a monitor with this well-hidden beyond-spec feature, instead of having to buy the expensive converter to split it into 2 <165MHz dual link DVI channels.\nThank goodness for standards!\n\nA: The new retina MacBook Pro have the following support over HDMI : \n\n\n*\n\n*Support for 1080p resolution at up to 60Hz\n\n*Support for 3840-by-2160 resolution at 30Hz\n\n*Support for 4096-by-2160 resolution at 24Hz\n\n\nSpecs at Apple.com.\n\nA: I just bought the mini displayport to DVI adapter(30 euro) but have not got a DVI cable yet. In the apple store they said this would get me the 2.5k resolution.\n\nA: I know it's anecdotal but I thought I'd share my similar situation.\nI have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013) and I receive the following outputs using these cables:\n\n\n*\n\n*hdmi -> hdmi only gives me 1080p\n\n*hdmi -> dvi (adapter) only gives me 1600x900\n\n*dvi -> hdmi (adapter) gives me 2560x1440\nIt's pretty backwards (literally), I know. But it's what's worked for my setup.\n\nA: I'm not sure if Apple changed anything with El Capitan, but I'm able to get 2560x1440 60hz with HDMI. I'm on a rMBP 13'' 2014. I'm connecting to Acer G257HU monitor. I can confirm using the monitor's overlay that it is indeed 1440p 60hz. Just using a standard Amazon HDMI cable. \n\nA: For additional and helpful information see this\nhttp://www.michaellabbe.com/DellU3011MacbookPro.html\n(bottom line!)\n\nA: I was able to get the Dell 3011 working at 2560x1600 resolution (30 Hz) when I run Windows 10 on a Macbook Retina and use the HDMI adapter. This means the hardware in the Macbook Retina will support 2560x1600 through the HDMI adapter. I set a custom resolution using the Intel HD Graphics Control Panel functionality. Don't know why this won't work when running macOS, but this would appear to mean that there is a software issue or potential software fix.\n", "Q: How do I disable Safari's Show All Tabs gesture? Safari's Show All Tabs view is pretty useless, it only shows one tab at a time and is fairly easy to trigger with an accidental pinch gesture. How do I turn it off (as least for the pinch gesture)?\n\nA: You can easily disable this by installing BetterTouchTool, and then for Safari adding a new Touchpad gesture for Pinch Out with no action.\nHere's a screenshot:\n\n\nA: This is currently not possible. Apple does not provide a way to turn off this gesture.\nNote that if you pinch out whilst still zoomed in slightly, the tab switcher is not invoked.\n\n\nA: Yes, you can disable it by going to System Settings → Trackpad → Scroll & Zoom and then uncheck the Zoom in or out box. Of course, by doing this, you also won't be able to pinch to zoom in and out on webpages and in other apps.\n", "Q: Using the builtin dialog under OSX to unlock an SSH key OSX has a builtin passphrase dialog for ssh-agent, so that on the first use of a key, it'll get cached.\nThe problem is -- I can't find a way to spawn that dialog by just adding ssh-add. ssh-add will only prompt for a passphrase on the terminal.\nSomehow, the agent checks the existence of matching .pub and private key files and uses that to know which to ask for and spawn what I assume is a builtin dialog box.\nI can work around this, hilarously, by also trusting that key for logging into \"localhost\", and putting \"ssh localhost echo -n \"\"\" into my .bashrc, but this is dumb.  If I can ssh-add and put the passphrase in on the terminal, I should also be able to use the builtin GUI.\n(Why would I want to arbitarily unlock the ssh key before I log into anything, you may ask? Well, because bash-completion's ability to autocomplete things like the other side of an scp or rsync command requires an available auth mechanism -- either Kerberos or an agented/unpassworded key.)\nI'm annoyed that I can't find a reference for this anywhere else.\n\nA: I think the dialog is because it is adding the ssh key to the keychain (as well as|instead of) to the .ssh/ files.\nYou should be able to invoke ssh-add -K and get the same results.\n", "Q: How many resources does an empty OSX desktop take? By desktop, I mean creating extra desktops that you can flip to for extra screen real estate, not separate monitors.

Wondering what the penalty is for having empty ones running.\n\nA: Quick unscientific testing says: not enough to be significant.\nI increased the number of desktops from 1 to 16 (which is apparently the maximum), and kept an eye on the memory usage of WindowServer – it went up a few MB.

I lost my bash aliases a while back and have forgotten the command to reload the UI of OS X.\nI'm looking for a way to tell the OS to clear any frameworks it might have cached somewhere and load them fresh from disk. The ultimate goal in doing this would be to force any changes you made to your .framework packages to get reflected in the OS.\nShutting down and logging off don't seem to do the trick.

I received a potentially compromising picture in a WhatsApp chat on my iPhone, I want to get rid of it entirely in everything Apple. \nI've deleted it from the chat (within minutes), but where else could it end up being stored? Photostream? Camera Roll? Somewhere in my Macbook? Would it be backed up to the iCloud automatically? Please tell me all the places I need to check to be sure. Sorry for the newbie questions.\n\nA: \nI received a potentially compromising picture in a WhatsApp chat\n\nSo someone else sent it to you. \nIf you delete the image from within the application, emptied the trash, checked your photo stream / iPhoto folders, deleted the contents of Library/Caches on any computers linked to the same service account, and checked Time Machine in the same locations it is highly unlikely that it still exists on your computer.\nBut someone else still has the original.\nAs many public figures have discovered, it's more-or-less impossible to permanently delete an image once someone else has it.\n\nA: I don't know whether WhatsApp stores its data in a cloud, but I know that you can have Apple's iCloud backing up your \"chat history\". Go to WhatsApp Settings > Chat Settings > Chat backup, to turn it off, or configure it for daily/weekly/monthly. If you turn it off, and then clear offending data from the WhatsApp app, then that should remove* it from iCloud. Make sure you do this on all iOS devices that use the same iCloud account.\n*well, as nearly as anything is every removed from vendor servers.

Note that I am dual-booting Mac OS and Ubuntu -- I assume the reason the FilesystemName is nil is the same reason that the ext4 Ubuntu partition shows up as disk0s4.\n\nNote: This is on 10.9.4 (Mavericks).\n\nA: Yeah I do encounter this problem sometimes also, but I don't know why is it happening. For some verifying and repairing solves the problem, but for those that doesn't get solved, the command line tool diskutil often does the job.\nYou can just use\ndiskutil resizeVolume $1 $2\n\nwhere\n\n\n*\n\n*$1 is the Mount Point or Disk Identifier or Device Node of the disk you are trying to resize (obtained with diskutil list).\n\n*$2 is the size in decimal with suffix of B, S(512 byte blocks), K, M, G, T, P, or percentage of the current size(%).\n\n\ne.g. diskutil resizeVolume disk0s6 100G will resize the volume disk0s6 to 100 GB.\n\nA: If your end goal is to repartition, given that you can't in OSX, I'd try a linux livecd using gparted.\nSomething like this: gparted tutorial\nYou can boot your mac with a linux live USB key and use gparted to repartition, then boot back into OSX.\n\nA: Not sure if this fix will universally fix the error I ran into, but thought I should share what worked for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to \"Verify\" the partition I was going to resize. If your issue is the same as mine, this will fail and ask you to \"Repair\" the partition.\n\n*Repairing the partition will not work until you boot from your recovery partition, so reboot and hit the \"Option\" (or \"Command-R\" in more recent versions of OS X) key as the computer starts back up so you can choose the recovery partition.\n\n*Click \"Disk Utility\" and then do the \"Verify\" / \"Repair\" from here instead. It should succeed.\n\n*Now it will let you shrink your boot partition, so do that.\n\n*Reboot again using your normal boot partition. Its size should be smaller now.\n\n*(optional) If you were dual-booting into a Linux system you were probably using GRUB as your primary bootloader, but the previous process may have set the Mac OS X bootloader to come first. To fix this I used the same process as I originally used to set GRUB to run first (I ran that from a Linux USB drive).\n\n\nA: I had the exact same problem and searched the web until I found this easy little fix, so I thought I should share it.\nFirst I made a backup of my primary drive with Carbon Copy Clone on an external drive.\nThen I restarted the computer, as it starts hold CommandS for just a moment until it starts to boot. At the prompt enter fsck -fy.\nThen let it do its thing for about 3-5 minutes and eventually it will be done. \nAt that point type reboot and plug in your external drive. You have to now boot from your external drive to make any permanent changes to your internal drive. \nI was now able to go into disk utility and use all of the functions to change sizes or repartition the drive.\nI hope this works for you, I tried many things before I was able to get this to work.\n\nA: Partition Mac HD again as small as u can. Once that is complete hit the revert key then the unerasable portion will be able to b deleted by clicking the minus button underneath. Wait for that process to be complete.

I'm part of a race team and was wondering if there was any way to get the stopwatch on the lock screen. Time is critical in the races we run and it'd be great if I could just glance down and see the time.\nI'm running IOS 7.\n\nA: Unfortunately this is not possible without jailbreaking your phone. Apple doesn't allow stopwatch apps to present their data on the lock screen. If you are running a jailbroken phone you can look in to something like Stoppur:\n\n\nAs part of the setup process, users can manually specify an x and y co-ordinate position on the device for the panel to be overlaid, meaning that additional power of how it looks is granted to the user. Other than that, the tweak does exactly as it says on the tin. It’s a stopwatch, it’s on the lock screen and it’s available to download now.\nStoppur is available as a download from the BigBoss repository and requires a jailbroken device running iOS 6.0 or above.\n\nI'll be honest though: that doesn't look very feature-rich. For running, just being able to see the time doesn't see overly useful. You'll probably want at least start/stop/reset controls and possibly lap controls too, right?\nThere are some apps that attempt to prevent the lock screen from engaging but also offer a pseudo-lock screen. Kinetic is one such app that I use and like and have recommended here for similar situations. It has a \"module\" approach to setting up the screen for activities.

Is there a way to do it?\n\nA: That is possible if:\nYou have a DVD drive with WiFi capability.\nYou could connect the DVD drive to your router and access it from your iPad.\n\nA: You can use VLC to create a network stream, then open this network stream in the VLC app on your iPad.\nFor more information, see:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.videolan.org/doc/streaming-howto/en/ch02.html\nBesides VLC you can use for example AirVideo, Plex or Infuse.\n", "Q: Stop iOS 7 update installation I made a mistake and accidentally started downloading iOS 7 on my device.\nI didn't notice it until it finished downloading but now it says it needs minimum of 50% charge to start installation.\nI do not want to install and and I am concerned of charging my phone as the download might start automatically \nWill it install automatically?\n\nA: It should not install until and unless you click on install.\n", "Q: Is there a way to auto mount SMB storage without nobrowse option?

Wake the display by pressing any key.\n", "Q: How can I find out which iOS apps I've purchased were free? I know that I can see all my purchased apps in the App Store on my iPad but it doesn't give any indication of whether these are free apps or whether I paid for them.\nI am in South Africa and have accounts in both the ZA and US stores. Before the ZA store had access to most apps I would buy them from the US store that I had loaded with vouchers. Unfortunately I left my iPad's store connected to the US store and \"bought\" many free apps there too. Now I keep the ZA store connected and apps purchased from the US store don't update unless I switch stores first.\nSo I want to uninstall all the free apps I purchased from the US store and re-purchase them from the ZA store, leaving only paid apps purchased from the US store installed. The problem is that once an app has been purchased the app info pages in the store no longer show the cost of the app; so how do I tell free and paid for apps apart? Not having bought the apps by credit card I have no email record of the purchases to refer to.\nI rarely use the App Store functionality in iTunes (on Windows) so perhaps that holds some key to this and I will check, but in the meantime I'm hoping someone already has the answer to this.\n\nA: Not something I've actually tried, but how about sign out on iTunes [store menu], then use the store as an anonymous customer? That might let you see the pricing.\n\nA: A fantastic resource is AppShopper (http://appshopper.com).  It won't give you the cost of the whole list of apps you own all at once, which would be ideal for your situation.  But, if you look up apps in AppShopper, it will give you the complete history of that app's price.  So it will tell you not just whether it is free today, but whether it is sometimes free.  Quite a few apps change their prices frequently, sometimes drastically.  I think they do this partly to capture on the \"deal mentality\" that makes some people excitedly grab an app if they get a notice that it dropped from $6.99 to free (for instance), and perhaps partly to combine the benefits of increasing their user base (when it's free/cheap) and bringing in revenue (when it's cheap/expensive).  If you notice that some of the apps that you want to keep aren't free today, but have been free several times in the past, they probably will be again!\n\nA: In iTunes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select \"iTunes Store\" on the left pane\n\n*Select \"Account\" under \"Quick Links\" on the right side\n\n*Find \"Purchase History\" section\n\n*Select \"See All\" - free apps will be listed there, as well as paid.\n\n", "Q: FaceTime audio when blocked? If you're blocked as a contact on a iPhone can you still contact them by FaceTime audio? \n\nA: No. Blocking a number will block it for normal calls, FaceTime and FaceTime audio.\nYou might have to pay attention to the details though to fully block someone. Anyone using FaceTime has an AppleID so you'd want to block the Apple ID (usually it's an email) and possibly also block the associated cellular number(s) since you can attach several phone numbers to one Apple ID.\n\nA: If the blocking person has done following then NO, you can not contact them:\nBlock phone numbers and contacts on your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch\n\nYou will not receive phone calls, messages, or FaceTime calls from people on your block list. There are many ways to add people to your block list; choose any one of the following:\nIn the FaceTime or Phone app, you can go to Favorites or Recents:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Tap the Info button next to the name or number you wish to block.\n  \n*Scroll to the bottom of the card and tap Block this Caller.\n  \n*Tap Block Contact.\n  \n  \n  In the FaceTime or Phone app, you can also tap the Contacts button:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Tap the contact you wish to block.\n  \n*Scroll to the bottom of the card and tap Block this Caller.\n  \n*Tap Block Contact.\n  \n  \n  In the Messages app:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Tap the message from the individual you wish to block.\n  \n*Tap Contact in the upper right.\n  \n*Tap the Info button, directly under the Done button.  If it is a group  message, select the appropriate button for the individual you wish to block.\n  \n*Scroll to the bottom of the card and tap Block this Caller.\n  \n*Tap Block Contact.\n  \n\n\nA: Yes you can still receive facetime audio from blocked callers. I have a contact blocked on my daughter's phone and it still rang through in facetime and facetime audio.\n\nA: Yes they can bc the kid that blocked me called me \n", "Q: iPhone 4 iOS 7 seems to register more data used I have checked the breakdown of data used. Under Settings > General > Usage, the Storage Breakdown for apps is:\nPhotos & Camera - 387MB\nWhatsapp - 378MB\nVoice Memos - 334 MB\netc. (in descending order)\nIn addition I have cleared most of pics and videos under Camera as part of my weekly routine. But I am still left with only 1GB (both registered on iTunes, Settings > General > Usage, and iExplorer (3rd party iPhone explorer). \nWhat would be the reason why this is so? and how do I regain more space?\nI do not download many apps. But my phone is jailbroken. Maybe it is because some Cydia apps are merely \"uninstalled\"? is that how it works?\n\nA: Try iCleaner. This removes a variety of leftovers and other jailbreak files that can consume a lot of space. These files don't show in Usage as they are regarded by iOS as part of the system, but can be safely removed.\n\nCydia: it cleans up Cydia caches and temporary files, Cydia applications unnecessary files, partially downloaded Cydia packages and repo files.\n[…]\nLog files: it deletes log files and crash reports from known locations. These files are generally irrelevant to the user and can be safely deleted.\nCache files: it scans and deletes system cache files and databases. Some of them are rebuilt upon respring. This helps removing obsolete cache data.\nTemporary files: it deletes temporary files from your device. These files are meant to be removed automatically, but they often happen not to. iCleaner takes care of that.\n\n", "Q: Terminal/iTerm Autocomplete \"greyed\" functionality? Not too sure how to describe this... but I saw this on a person's computer a cafe today and didn't get a chance to ask him what plugin/application he was using --\nI think it best to illustrate with an example:\nSay there's a directory with three folders, 'kitty', 'doggie', and 'frog'.\nTyping cd f would make the letters rog appear after the 'f', but rog would be in a lighter color of text (a greyed color) -- it was a sort of \"visible autocomplete\", not sure what else to call it. Anyone know how to achieve this? Thanks.\n\nA: This is a feature of the fish shell (Friendly Interactive Shell).\n\nfish's scripting syntax is also quite a bit different from bash and zsh's. If you use zsh, you can also try the zsh-autosuggestions plugin on Github.\n\nA: There is also a plugin for oh-my-zsh:\nhttps://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions. It explicitly aims at Fish-like functionality.\n\nA: Sounds like like iTerm2 feature.\nSee this for complete list of Features including the Autocomplete and Highlighting.\n", "Q: Does mdfind allow wildcard searches on filename? I'm trying to figure out how to perform wildcard searches for filenames with mdfind on OsX? I tried: mdfind -name \"*.pdf\" but it didn't work.\nEDIT: I want to be able to find names like \"test*.pdf\"\n\nA: macOS ships with the regular find command, and mdfind is not a replacement for find.\nIf you really just want to search the current directory for all pdf files, you should probably just do find . -name '*.pdf'\nBy default mdfind searches by file content and metadata, and it searches your entire hard drive instead of just a single directory — on my system mdfind pdf finds tens of thousands of results.\nIf you must use mdfind, because it's faster, you have a few options to limit the results, for example:\nmdfind pdf -onlyin .\nmdfind 'kMDItemFSName = *.pdf' -onlyin .\nmdfind 'kMDItemContentTypeTree = *.pdf' -onlyin .\n\nUse mdls to learn what metadata is available for a file, and the syntax for pattern matching is very minimalist since it needs to match the database index of your filesystem.\nAlternatively you can mdfind with grep, giving the speed of mdfind and full regex matching on the file path. For example:\nmdfind pdf -onlyin . | grep 'pdf$'\n\nOne final caveat is mdfind does not search your actual file system, it only searches the spotlight database which may be missing parts of the filesystem or inaccurate. Use find if you require reliable results. Use mdfind when you require speed over accuracy and when you need complicated search terms (eg find all pdf files that were created within a specific date range and contain a phrase of text).\n\nA: When explicitly searching for filenames, my experience is that the kMDItemFSName attribute provides more concise results. Another suggestion: add the d comparison modifier (insensitive to diacritical marks) to e.g. match a file called \"Entrée Menu.pdf\" when searching for \"entree\":\nmdfind 'kMDItemFSName == \"*entree*\"cd'\nAlso, since @tcmb's link to the attributes reference is dead, here are two working ones: Spotlight Metadata Attributes and iCloud Metadata Attributes.\n\nA: This should work:\nmdfind \"kMDItemDisplayName == test*.pdf\"\n\nEnclose the pattern in single quotes and add 'c' to match case-insensitively:\nmdfind \"kMDItemDisplayName == 'test*.pdf'c\"\n\nHere is a list of available attributes. You can combine multiple attribute/value pairs with &&.\n\nA: If you find yourself frequently wanting to use Spotlight to search for filenames by glob patterns, it might be worth it to wrap it into a script by saving this code into a mdfindfile on your path:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n# case-insensitive search for $1, maybe in dir $2\ncase \"$#\" in\n    0) echo \"usage: $(basename $0) PATTERN [DIR]\"\n       echo \"\"\n       echo \"  Lists paths of files matching PATTERN in DIR or below\"\n       ;;\n    1) exec mdfind \"kMDItemDisplayName == '$1'c\"\n       ;;\n    *) exec mdfind \"kMDItemDisplayName == '$1'c\" -onlyin \"$2\"\n       ;;\nesac\n\nThen you can just do mdfindfile \"*.pdf\" to search your machine or mdfindfile \"*.pdf\" ~/Documents to search below your Documents, or whatever.\n", "Q: Username.conf rules to fix 403 error I am setting up a webserver but I am currently receiving a 403 error when browsing to Localhost.

I would like to set Atom as my default editor for open.\nIn order to do this, I set in my .bashrc:\nexport EDITOR=\"atom -nw\"\n\nand reload the file with source .bashrc. Anyway, when I try to open a text file through open filename, it always opens it with TextEdit.\nI also tried variations of the above, such as export EDITOR=atom, or exporting VISUAL.\nI am sure that .bashrc gets loaded on login.\nWhat am I missing/doing wrong?\n\nA: thee's answer doesn't work for Yosemite and El Capitan - use this one instead:\ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure LSHandlers -array-add '{LSHandlerContentType=public.plain-text;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.github.atom;}'\n\n\nA: The actual answer is:\nexport EDITOR=\"/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/MacOS/Atom -nw\"\n\nA: Just right (or control) click a file of the type you want to change and:\n\"Get Info\" -> \"Open with:\" -> (Select your program of choice) -> \"Change All\"\nYou'll have to do this once for each extension (.txt, .rtf, etc.) you wish to update.\n\nA: The open command is part of OS X and uses Finder's default “Open With…” application to open the file, just like double-clicking it in Finder. $EDITOR is used for things like fc where it is used as the default command-line editor (a replacement for vim or emacs).\nTo use Atom with the open command, you can select a file of the type you want in Finder, press ⌘ command+I for “Get Info”, and then change “Open With:” to Atom, and click “Change All…”.\nAlternatively you can define an alias like\nalias e=\"atom -nw\"\n\nin your .bashrc and then run e file-to-edit.txt whenever you want to edit a file in Atom.\n\nA: Following this answer on Stackoverflow, the following command should work:\ndefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSHandlers -array-add '{LSHandlerContentType=public.plain-text;LSHandlerRoleAll=com.github.atom;}'\n\nI am not sure how fare this works through.

I just bought a new mac. I've been using it a couple of days, and today I find that under \"Apps using significant energy\" there is a listing com.apple.preferences.users.remoteservice.\nWhat is it ? Why is it using significant energy ? Should I kill it ?\n\nA: Some System Preference panes in Mavericks are built in a way to separate certain tasks into XPC processes. \n\nThe idea is to break up a complex application into individual processes, each of which requires only the few entitlements necessary to perform a specific subset of the application's total capabilities.\n\ncom.apple.preferences.users.remoteservice is one of these XPC processes. If you locate the process in Activity Monitor you should be able to tell which preference pane launched the process by the icon. In the screenshot below the process has the Users & Groups icon indicating that it belongs to the Users & Groups preference pane.\nI'd check first to figure out which set of preferences it belongs to and make a judgement call on whether it makes sense that it is still running, but if one of these processes is using a significant amount of energy (and is still running once System Preferences is closed) I'd assume something has gone wrong and kill it. \nSomething you could do to attempt to understand what this process is doing is to open the Console application on your Mac and enter \"remoteservice\" in the filter box in the top-right corner. I'm assuming if the process is using a significant amount of energy then it is struggling to do something and will have written quite a few errors to the system log about what it is trying to do.\n\n\nA: I don't know if it would be this straightforward for every situation, but I was having the same issue with this process using up too much memory.\nWhat worked was switching the Systems Preferences from Network (the window open at the time) back to the main \"Show All\" window.  Instantly, the process went away!  Worked for me, anyway.\n\nA: its working !

Its going around now that Facebook is attempting to shift its Messaging users from using the main Facebook app to the Facebook Messenger app. Many sites have posted stories (though admittedly dated) about the app's Terms of Service and its alleged capabilities.\nMany of the permissions the app asks for strike me as technically impossible given iOS's sandboxing, but I'm not an iOS developer and can't speak to that with certainty.\nHere's what the HuffingtonPost lists:\n\nAllows the app to change the state of network connectivity\nAllows the app to call phone numbers without your intervention. This\n  may result in unexpected charges or calls. Malicious apps may cost you\n  money by making calls without your confirmation.\nAllows the app to send SMS messages. This may result in unexpected\n  charges. Malicious apps may cost you money by sending messages without\n  your confirmation.\nAllows the app to record audio with microphone. This permission allows\n  the app to record audio at any time without your confirmation.\nAllows the app to take pictures and videos with the camera. This\n  permission allows the app to use the camera at any time without your\n  confirmation.\nAllows the app to read you phone's call log, including data about\n  incoming and outgoing calls. This permission allows apps to save your\n  call log data, and malicious apps may share call log data without your\n  knowledge.\nAllows the app to read data about your contacts stored on your phone,\n  including the frequency with which you've called, emailed, or\n  communicated in other ways with specific individuals.\nAllows the app to read personal profile information stored on your\n  device, such as your name and contact information. This means the app\n  can identify you and may send your profile information to others.\nAllows the app to access the phone features of the device. This\n  permission allows the app to determine the phone number and device\n  IDs, whether a call is active, and the remote number connected by a\n  call.\nAllows the app to get a list of accounts known by the phone. This may\n  include any accounts created by applications you have installed.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*\"The Insidiousness of Facebook Messenger's Mobile App Terms of Service\" - http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-fiorella/the-insidiousness-of-face_b_4365645.html#\nIt seems to me that there wouldn't even be APIs available for most of these actions.\nIs it possible for Facebook Messenger to spy on me to this degree?\n\nA: The article is talking about the Android version of the app.\nA number of these permissions are not available on iOS. And where they are available they require user intervention.\nThat said, the article is to a certain extent link bait.\n\nA: This answer is from a public API point of view. Jailbreaking will obviously change this. The permissions are clearly from Android where apps have much more 'free' access to the device—this is what the permissions translate to from an iOS point of view for this site.\n\n\nAllows the app to change the state of network connectivity\n\nNot going to happen. Apps can only read certain information such as Wi-Fi info (including but not limited to SSID, BSSID, vendor, IP, subnet mask and received/sent total since boot) and cellular info (including but not limited to carrier, country, network type, IP, MCC, MNC and received/sent total cellular data since boot). Apps can not change any kind of network information; they can't even change the Wi-Fi network.\n\nAllows the app to call phone numbers without your intervention. This may result in unexpected charges or calls. Malicious apps may cost you money by making calls without your confirmation.\n\nNope, making a call using tel:// (or telprompt://) throws a huge dialog box on the screen at the OS level requiring the user to press Call or Cancel. As the dialog is at OS level, the app can't simply bypass it. The connection can't take place unless Call is pressed. Also, as this requires confirmation for each call, the call can't take place in the background without user interaction.\n\nAllows the app to send SMS messages. This may result in unexpected charges. Malicious apps may cost you money by sending messages without your confirmation.\n\nThis is the same as calling. Using MFMessageCompose requires user confirmation at an OS level and can't happen in the background as discussed above.\n\nAllows the app to record audio with microphone. This permission allows the app to record audio at any time without your confirmation.\n\nAttempting to access the microphone throws an OS level alert at the time the access is first requested by the app. Subsequent attempts at accessing the microphone will not require confirmation, but only when the app is in the foreground. Using the microphone in the background shows a double-height red status bar to inform the user of the case and using the microphone in the background must be initiated by an app that was in the foreground when the access was requested. Access can be removed from the app at any time in Settings → Privacy → Microphone.\n\nAllows the app to take pictures and videos with the camera. This permission allows the app to use the camera at any time without your confirmation.\n\nPictures do not require any special permission until iOS 8 and will then throw an alert like the microphone. Video requires the microphone permission, which throws an alert.\n\nAllows the app to read you phone's call log, including data about incoming and outgoing calls. This permission allows apps to save your call log data, and malicious apps may share call log data without your knowledge.\n\nNope, apps have no access to your recent calls list. The data is not accessible through APIs and is stored outside of any app's sandbox.\n\nAllows the app to read data about your contacts stored on your phone, including the frequency with which you've called, emailed, or communicated in other ways with specific individuals.\n\nContacts access is granted through an OS level alert. This grants read/write access to the contacts themselves, but no further information. Communication frequency, etc, is not able to be obtained as discussed for the previous permission.\n\nAllows the app to read personal profile information stored on your device, such as your name and contact information. This means the app can identify you and may send your profile information to others.\n\nThis can only be obtained through the access of the 'me' card in your contacts, which requires the user grant specific permission at an OS level as discussed above.\n\nAllows the app to access the phone features of the device. This permission allows the app to determine the phone number and device IDs, whether a call is active, and the remote number connected by a call.\n\nAn app can access the phone number that the device was activated with using NSUserDefaults. Note that this is the phone number the device was activate with and is not read from the SIM card. The UDID (Unique Device Identifier) was depreciated and Apple no longer accepts apps which access it. I'm not aware of any way to determine whether a call is active using public APIs and definitely not what phone number the call is with.\n\nAllows the app to get a list of accounts known by the phone. This may include any accounts created by applications you have installed.\n\nAccounts such as Twitter and Facebook require OS level permission to be granted to the app. Other accounts such as mail accounts can not be accessed by other apps. Apps that create accounts such as mail clients store accounts themselves as opposed to using the system's storage and therefore such accounts are not able to be accessed unless that app specifically shares such information in that way (for example, logging in to your Google account in the YouTube app also makes your account available in Google Chrome and visa versa).\n", "Q: Does AirPlaying content from VPN protected laptop expose content beyond local network? If I AirPlay something from my laptop, which connects to the internet via VPN, to my Apple TV which connects to my wifi router which is NOT VPN protected, is the content I'm AirPlaying exposed beyond my local network?\n\nA: No, the airplayed content won't leave your local network. \nYour VPN only protects traffic that goes through your internet gateway which is usually your modem/router. (In the less common case that it is a split tunneling VPN, even only the traffic to the remote LAN is affected by the VPN.) However, Airplay connects your laptop with your AppleTV within the local network, so it is neither affected by the VPN, nor does it leave your local network.\n", "Q: How do I fix the SSL warning I get when visiting github.com?

Example: Shift, Control, Command, or Option\n  keystrokes programmed into the footswitch cannot modify the input of a\n  separate USB keyboard or mouse. However, a key sequence like ‘Cmd-W’\n  or ‘Cmd-Shift-left arrow’ will work on a Macintosh if the entire\n  sequence of keystrokes has been pre-programmed into the footswitch.\n  (Footswitch can only be programmed on a Windows PC).\n\nThis explains what I am experiencing.  I tested it by trying the same thing with an external usb keyboard.  I would press the left control on the external usb keyboard and the \"left\" arrow on the built in keyboard and it would not register.  BUt when hitting the \"left\" arrow and the control key on the usb keyboard it registered as expected.\nDoes anyone know how to fix this issue? \n\nA: You can install Karabiner, which should be enough to aggregate USB inputs.\n\nA: I ended up creating my own \"keyboard combiner\". It lets me use the Kinesis Savant Elite Triple Foot Pedals for shift, alt, and command modifiers on a Mac.\nhttps://github.com/davidbkemp/KeyboardCombinerArduinoSketch/wiki\nIt is quite easy to assemble, but I cannot guarantee that it will work for you. It certainly does not work with some pedals and some keyboards. For the Kinesis pedals, you will initially need to configure them to act as shift, alt, and command keys, and that means using a PC to do the initial configuration.\n", "Q: What does \"Vector 0xdd(TMR)\" do and how can I fix a problem that I'm having with it? I am currently having problems with kernal_task using ~2GB of RAM and looking at what advice exists I ran sysdiagnose and in powermeterics.txt I found that Vector 0xdd(TMR) was doing ~20,000 interrupts/sec. However, this vector was different than the one the advice that I was looking at suggested would be the problem.\nHowever, clearly this happening is also a problem.\nHowever, when I'm trying to look for what Vector 0xdd(TMR) does, all that I find are the results relating what the advice suggest that the other problem because it is more common and that all the Vectors are often copied together when asking what is going wrong.\nSo what does this Vector do and now I would go about fixing the fact that it is doing ~20,000 interrupts/sec?\nEDIT: While I currently still don't know what is caused this issue, it was resolved by Vladimir's answer below.\n\nA: I have two other suggesting that also helped me fix issues that I was having. Both of them are pretty easy too (no need to mess with any system files or change plist or anything else like that).\n1) Go to the Disk Utility app on your computer and press the buttons in following picture in the order that they are numbered. This will make OSX scan your hard disk and attempt to fix any potential file permission problems you may have. If this doesn't fix the memory issue, it should a least make your computer run a little smoother. I find that doing this one in a while really helps performance on my computer (which is fairly new by the way, so this helps even on relatively resent systems).\n(PS. 1(b) is optional, most likely it will be grayed out anyway unless you run the Disk Utility app from Network Recovery Mode or while running off a separate hard drive.)\n\n2) If you have antivirus installed on your Mac and you turned on the Scan Archives option, turn it off. The reason this feature is not on by default is that it affects the computer's performance a lot any time you run a local java program. It sounds like a really cool thing to have on, but it comes with a serious performance draw.\nI'm not sure if this will help free up your RAM, but if nothing else helps, this is a quick and easy way to speed up your computer. :)\n\nA: I'm not familiar with the vector that you mentioned, but I think I know how to fix the problem with your kernel using a lot of memory.\nI found that my pc uses way too much RAM too whenever I have a lot of icons on my desktop. This also happened when I have few files, but they are large in size.\nAs far as I understand, this happens because OSX pre-catches a lot of file into RAM so they load faster when you use them.\nI found that the easiest way to fix this is to put all of the file I have on my desktop into another folder. As far as I can tell, the OS doesn't catch folders or their contents until you open them.\nHope this helps! :)\n\nA: The app in this post is similar to the old OSX 10.8 RAM-pie-chart that used to show how your RAM was being used. If nothing else worked, run this program and see what colors it's showing.\nLots of blue = a lot of files and apps are being cached into ram.\nLots of yellow/red = some programs are being memory hogs.\nIn either case, I have some more suggestions that might be able to help. But I'll save those for later if we need them. :)\n", "Q: Administrator priviliges request dialog does not accept my password I have recently installed OS X version 10.9 on my MacBook Pro. When I start it, it doesn't require any password but when I try to install Adobe Flash Player or other plugins I am asked to approve the installation by entering the password of the user who is now \"Us\" (different name). When I enter the old password I had before formatting and installing new OS X, it kept saying wrong password. Is there any standard password to use? \n\nA: You need to open the Users & Groups section of the system preferences and check what users are available. Is there one with admin privileges? Use that for the installation dialog. The inconvenience will be that in those dialogs you will need to enter the admin user name in addition to the password.\nIf there is no admin user, you could try to enable a root account. However, this needs admin privileges to be set up. Check if the padlock icon in the lower left corner of the Users & Groups section is closed (needs password, click on icon to open the password dialog), or open (you are free to add accounts). If the padlock icon is closed and you do not have any working admin user - password combination, I recommend to re-install OS 10.9 and to add the admin user at the appropriate prompt in the installation process. I hope this won't be needed - this should really be your last resort.\nFor Apple's explanation of the root account setup, see this article.\n", "Q: iPhone Field Test mode permanently in iOS 7 I have seen 2 different methods of putting your iPhone in Field Test mode permanently in iOS 7, a short one and a long one. \nThe short way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your phone app and dial *3001#12345#* (I recommend putting this in your Notepad so can copy and paste it.

I decided to create an Arch linux partition, and thus began my adventure... While installing rEFInd (the maintained fork of rEFIt), I ended up doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mounted the EFI partition in /Volumes\n\n*Moved the necessary binaries into /Volumes/.../refind/\n\n*Messed up\n\n*Decided to quickly start over by removing refind\n\n*Hastily decided to rm -rf *, but did not realize I was not in /refind\n\n*Ended up deleting everything in /Volumes/EFI/*\n\n*...which included APPLE/EXTENSIONS/firmware.scap\n\n*Freaked out\n\n*Freaked out some more because I wasn't exactly sure what I just did...\n\n*Shutdown and rebooted, praying I wouldn't hit a brick wall\n\n*...and then...\n\n*...Everything worked find.\n\n\nBut I still do not have a EFI/APPLE/EXTENSIONS/firmware.scap, so my questions are:\nWhat is the firmware.scap? Why isn't my computer freaking out?\nI've skimmed some literature on the internet, but there doesn't seem to be that much definitive information, just people giving rote directions to flash EFI firmware for those of us who have deleted it. If someone could just point me in the right direction (to learn more precisely about firmware.scap), I would be very grateful.\n\nA: This file is always at this location: /usr/standalone/i386/Firmware.scap\n\nA: Your system may not need the firmware extension. See also here.\nThe Firmware.scap file is a boot loader that shipped with an installed operating system. It allows older Macs to boot newer versions of macOS that would not be capable of doing so because important parts are missing in their EFI Firmware in EEPROM and these parts cannot be added there as the EEPROM size is very limited. In that case the EEPROM only requires just enough boot code to bring up the whatever is required to read the EFI partition on your drive and then it can load that extension firmware from there which takes over control and performs the actual boot. It also depends on the kind of hardware built into your system.\nThe older the system, the newer the version of macOS you want to boot, and the more exotic your hardware, you more likely you will need that file but in many cases the system can boot fine without it (though booting from USB or booting recovery mode may not work without that file, even if you can boot from the internal drive).\n", "Q: Driver for TP-LINK TL-WN721N Wi-Fi Adapter I used to plug in my TP-LINK TL-WN721N Wi-Fi adapter in a port in my old computer that used to run Windows. That's how I connected to the internet, but now I bought an iMac which I couldn't connect to the internet.\nIs there a kext to use or a hack to try to get it working on my iMac? I also learned that similar chipsets used in Wi-Fi adapters can lead to similar experience using different adapters, so I searched WikiDevi to find similar products with supported OS X drivers. I am running OS X 10.9 Mavericks.\nNote: AirPort is malfunctioning, that's why I need the adapter to connect ..\n\nA: According to the TP-Link company website, TL-WN721N is only supported under Windows.\n\nA: The TP-Link website does state that the TL-WN721N wifi adapter is only supported by windows. However, you may be able to install drivers for the chipset of your adapter, possibly allowing it to work. Once you have determined the chipset of your adapter, you may be able to download unix drivers for it from the chipset manufacturers' website, or, from another company who is licensed to use the chipset. (sidenote as an example- I use a USB-HDMI adapter, and while there were no OSX drivers provided by the company who sold the product, I was able to acquire drivers through the chipset manufacturer's website) Alternatively, you may reinstall OSX to regain functionality of Airport Utility.\n\nA: Why can't you use the built-in Airport in the Mac?

My friend and I both have 13-inch Mid 2010 MacBook Pro's. Same processor and specs since they were purchased at the same time, but originally had 250 GB hard drives. His hard drive failed and needed a new one. Put a 500 GB Seagate Momentus 5400.6 in his computer, and tried using a flash drive with \"Install OS X Mavericks\" on it to install Mavericks on his new hard drive. No matter what, it wouldn't install. I finally was able to install OS X 10.9.4 on it by connecting the new hard drive to my computer with a USB hard drive enclosure. I put the hard drive back inside his computer and it wouldn't boot (stuck on the gray screen with apple logo and a spinning wheel). I then attached to the hard drive to his computer externally with the USB enclosure, and then it booted and worked perfectly.\nSo, it seemed like the problem was with something inside his computer, but then I switched our drives, and that doesn't seem to be the case anymore. I put my original hard drive into his computer, and his new hard drive into my computer, and they both booted and worked perfectly, so I have no idea why his computer will not boot with the new hard drive internally.\nTo summarize, his computer boots with: 1) new hard drive connected externally (won't work if it's internal), and 2) my hard drive internally\nbut my computer boots with: 1) new hard drive connected externally AND internally, and 2) my hard drive internally.\nBoth hard drives have OS X 10.9.4 installed\nIf anyone has any idea what's causing this and how to make his computer work with the new hard drive internally that would be greatly appreciated.\nEdit: Update\nI was able to test the computers with some other hard drives. I have his original hard drive (which apparently needed to be replaced), which I was able to read with my computer and install Mavericks on. I also installed Mavericks on a 1 TB Toshiba hard drive. Here's the results with all 4 hard drives installed internally on either computer:\nHis computer:\n1) Works perfectly with the original hard drive from my computer (recall they are the same model MacBook Pro)\n2) Stuck on gray screen with apple logo and spinning wheel when booting with 500 GB Seagate and 1 TB Toshiba hard drives\n3) Folder with question mark when booting with his original hard drive (which is why he said/was told it needed to be replaced originally)\nMy Computer:\n1) Works with all 4 hard drives, including the one that causes his computer to show a folder with a question mark.\n\nA: Could you swap hdd cable and see If that help ? Also take a look here, where the general consensus seems to be that the issue is the hard drive cable: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2648100?tstart=0\n\nA: I had a similar issue, it was an OCZ drive with a \"known\" (not to ME) incompatibility.\n\nA: Hey I’m so sorry to hear about your troubles, but you swapped a lot of drives around which is decent troubleshooting. \nI would DEFINITELY check all of your cables. I have a mid 2012 and my stock hard drive is still doing awesome, but since Mojave... things haven’t been too great. I ran so many HDD diagnostics and they all say it’s good.. I mention this b/c if it was taken care of it could last a while, haha even tho they’ll be extinct soon enough.\nBut looking at this as a tech, I would check your cables, and if you can swap them out. Anything you can physical see is important. \nAlso, roughly 90% of my repairs: PC, Mac, mobile devices, diagnostic ultrasound systems... Sometimes issues can be resolved by an older backup. \nSo if the cables end up being okay and don’t seem to be your issue, and definitely verify that. I’d check the last time you replaced your battery, and if you can run any power diagnostics. Use software, but if you’re trained crack that sucker open and make sure your drives even getting the energy it needs... \nIf not the battery it could be an issue with the board, but cross that bridge when you come to it, and if it does PHYSICAL INSOECTIONS are key.. I’ve actuslly found bad caps, haha a bad timing chip for an u/s system, and just SMD components that may deserved a magnified view and testing. \nIf I’m wrong I’m sorry that with Mac laptops I’ve only been studying for the past two years + what I learned in a NetOps course.

The technician had to remove the battery because it wasn't charging. Without battery, the computer runs fine. \nI'm thinking of purchasing another battery, however, I want to ensure that the problem is effectively the battery and not something else. \nHow can I test the battery and determine whether that's the cause of the problem, so I can decide whether to purchase another one or not?\nHopefully, without another Macbook Air. I can't insert my battery into a working Macbook Air because I don't own another one and I don't know anyone who does.\n\nA: There are some apps on the app store that do similar things. Here's a free one I found: Battery Health, but it might not be the best (it was just at the top of the list and looked good).\nBut guessing from things I heard before, it was probably a part of computer circuitry that was damaged, and most likely the apps won't be able to tell if the problem is really the battery or the computer.\nThree other suggestions that might help:\n1) Carefully use a volt meter to check the battery (this probably won't work though, because computer batteries are really complicated with lots of different electric pins, and you may end up braking the battery even more).\n2) Go to an Apple store and ask them if you can put the battery into one of their computers, or try one of their batteries in your's. If (like me) you don't live near on of those kind of stores, you can try asking around in your local computer repair stores.\n3) Gently clean the electronic connections of the battery with a q-tip and 100% isopropyl alcohol. 100% is best, but it's really had to find. So some slightly lower percentages might be alright too. If possible, make sure the battery is completely drained before trying this as it can cause a short circuit if there's power to it. You can also clean your computer's connections with it just to be sure that there is no dried-on gunk preventing contact between the battery and the computer.\nHope this helps :)\n", "Q: Fill in suggestion in search without triggering search On my iPhone I find that the google suggestion list has a large portion of my search term already and I'd like to use a suggestion without having to type it.

This is not the only problem I encountered (there are other extensions that give problems), but I was wondering if this could be solved? I have a naming preference of using dots in the folders - seems this is not a good idea on OSX?\n\nA: You can remove the bundle document type for the .download extension.\nYou'll have to edit /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Info.plist and remove the entry for the download extension under Document Types. The only disadvantage to this is that, whenever Safari updates, you'll have to do this again as your changes will be overridden.\nI'd also make sure you make a backup of the Info.plist file first, before you make changes, incase you move the wrong line(s) or Safari gives you any issues after making the changes.\n\nA: Or you could use a dash instead of a period.\nxxxyyzz-download\n", "Q: How can I get the music I've put onto my iPhone from CDs onto my new MacBook if theres no CD drive?

Like reset Apples DB of where my Wifi is?\n\nA: There's not really a way of doing this. Apple does use croud-sourced data obtained from iPhones though: get an iPhone and let it get its location. Using GPS the iPhone will obtain an actual location, and as it can scan for Wi-Fi the data can be combined.\n\nA: Not sure if they'll fix this sort of problem, but you could try reporting it through the \"Report a Problem...\" feature under the Apple Maps application menu.

Unfortunately Apple don't seem to publish a list of video codec that they support. Even Apple's listing of image file formats is vague.\nThe video could be using a recognised format but the file could be corrupt.\nI would try opening the file in something that supports a wide range of video formats, like VLC. If the file doesn't open at all, there is a good chance it is corrupt. If it does open, you can check the file format with CMD + I.\n\nA: There is no clear and definitive answer for iPhoto supported video formats. iPhoto will import most .mov or other QuickTime files. It also supports some versions of AVCHD.But there is no clue Apple device can accept avi as import video type.

Its like if I am listening to music, I can up the pitch (like in garage band) and make it sound like a chipmunk singing. Is there any free apps to do that?\n\nA: I am not aware of anything that will do this task in real time as it requires some math to do the pitch shift. It is possible to take the alert sounds and process them to a different pitch like you said using an audio editor and then assign custom sounds, but an ongoing pitch shift would take some processing and I do not believe that there is a solution for that currently.\nI have experimented with changing sample rates and the system adjusts for that and plays the proper pitch so it is not a simple task.\n\nA: This is possible with the free app Audacity. That is, it will work if you are editing sound and wish to change the pitch of a recorded sound. I am not aware of any free program that will do this with live sound, on the fly.\n\nA: Audio Hijack Pro can change the pitch live and in real-time. It takes a bit of fiddling around though, but it works well\n\nA: So, Garage Band is a free app, and you already mentioned you can do this from Garage Band... so... maybe you need to specify exactly what you are trying to do.\nYou should try to look into what are called \"audio routing\" apps, you can find several (some free).

It's fine if she blesses that one for downloads and loses it.\nThe biggest threat is lost media, but without Wifi its hard to use cloud services to get these off.\n\nA: You can use any computer that has iTunes installed on it. All you need to do is back it up to that computer first. You don't have to sync it with the computer.\nOnce the iPhone is backed up, you can download and install the update knowing you have a backup of it on the computer.\nOnce the iOS update is complete, you can go into Preferences -> Devices and then select the backup and delete it from your computer if you don't want it on your computer.\n\nA: For extra peace of mind, you can use Image Capture (in your Applications folder) to securely download the photos to the computer's hard drive first. The procedure above should protect your photos, but seeing the photos safe and sound can help to put the new mother's mind at ease.\n", "Q: Where can I find the log of all mounted volumes?

PCIe vs external thunderbolt SSD I have a new 2014 MacBook Pro with 1TB internal PCIe SSD.\nBlackmagic Disk Speed Test is reporting read/write speeds of over 900MB/s.\nI am debating whether to swap this machine for a 512GB one (saving $500) and using an external Thunderbolt SSD drive, which would be cheaper and more practical.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is that 900MB speed realistic? Seems incredibly fast.\n\n*Could an external Thunderbolt SSD be that fast? Theoretically Tb can do 10Gb/s ~ 1200 MB/s...\n\n\nA: *\n\n*The 900MB speed is realistic, this is achieved on a few of apple's new mac offerings. \n\n*An external Thunderbolt SSD would not be as fast, the only way to make it the same speed (or possibly faster) is if you have a multidrive thunderbolt enclosure running in something like Raid-0 with SSDs in all slots. \n\n\nThe prior enclosure would be rather expensive though. It is probably best to have as much of that internal storage as possible as that is not easily upgradable. I would stay with the 1TB model more internal storage is always better.\n", "Q: Applescripts not working in Finder since Mavericks I have a bunch of Applescripts that do things like change sort column in Finder windows, but they've stopped working since Mavericks.\nIf I close and reopen the window, then the change takes effect, but this is annoying.\nIs this a bug?

It's likely that a tweak you installed caused it to enter what is often called a \"boot-loop\" when you restarted it.\nTo exit this, try holding the power and home button for ten seconds like you saw in those guides, but this time as it restarts, hold the volume-up button. This enters the Mobile Substrate's safe-mode (thank you Saurik for your foresight!) and should allow you to access Cydia to remove the troublesome tweak. If your volume-up button doesn't work, use your Apple earbuds and use the volume-up on the headset remote.\nEDIT:\nAfter digging through the problem more and trying my suggestion, the asker could not boot into safe-mode. Booting into DFU-mode and restoring via iTunes was the only viable course of action to solve their problem.\n\nA: Based on what i can understand, I think it might be a hardware problem.

How do I determine if my OS X 10.9.4 is a 32 bit or 64 bit operating system?\nI've looked at \"About This Mac\" but don't understand what the processor information (i.e. 3.5 GHz Intel Core i7) translates into as refers to \"bits.\n\nA: Easy - it's 64-bit.\nMavericks is 64-bit only :)\n\nA: OS X doesn't really have a single overall mode -- it can easily run different components (different processes, the kernel, etc) in different modes. It also has a multi-architecture binary format, so a single program can include both 32- and 64-bit code, and the OS will simply run it in whatever seems to be the most appropriate mode at the moment.\nOver the history of OS X, it's gradually morphed from 32-bit only (through 10.2 I think), to fully 32+64-bit capable (10.6), to mostly-64-bit-only (10.8-10.9). Starting in 10.8, Apple removed the 32-bit versions of the kernel and most built-in apps, meaning that it'll only run on 64-bit CPUs. But it's still fully capable of running old 32-bit programs, and there are even a number of system programs that can run in either mode (again, to provide compatibility with old 32-bit software). The most visible example of this is the System Preferences, which normally runs in 64-bit mode, but can quit & relaunch itself in 32-bit mode to run old 32-bit-only preference panes (if you can still find one).\nNote that there've never been separate 32- and 64-but versions of OS X. 10.6, for example, would install exactly the same on a 32- or 64-bit computer, and then decide at runtime which mode each program should run in.\nSummary: it's not an entirely a meaningful question, but to the extent that it's meaningful Mavericks is a 64-bit OS.\n\nA: I do not believe that Mavericks shipped with a 32-bit version. You are probably running 64-bit OS X.\nAll of the Core i3, i5, and i7 Mac computers have 64-bit processors.\nApple Support document\nTo determine if you are running a 32-bit or 64-bit version of OS X, open a Terminal and type:\nuname -a\nOn a 64-bit OS, the output will end with RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64. On a 32-bit OS, the output will end with RELEASE_I386 i386.\nOSXDaily article\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Retina (early 2013) Trackpad Dead So I was watching some great BBC documentaries on YouTube last night, and before I fell asleep, I plugged in my Macbook (early 2013, 13\") and set it on my nightstand.\nWhen I got up today, I was unable to use the trackpad at all. Keyboard works just fine, but the trackpad does absolutely nothing. No clicks, no movement, no response.\nI restarted, checked for updates, and did plenty of Google searching, but couldn't find anyone with a similar problem. I've tried safemode and my copy of Windows 8, and the trackpad worked with none.\nMy first instinct is hardware failure, it just seems odd for it to happen overnight while charging. I haven't unscrewed anything, but there's no indication of battery expansion or any external damage.\nI bought it literally a year ago last week, so the warranty just expired. I can use an external mouse just fine, so it's not totally unusable (and I've made sure it wasn't the mouse causing problems, because I've fell victim to that before).\nSo, for clarification, this isn't the late-2013 model where there were known issues with the trackpad. It is early 2013, and it claims it has the latest the software update (however it's been bugging me for a couple weeks to update, which I haven't, and now it says there are no new updates, so this may or may not be relevant).\nAs far as I can tell, OS X isn't reporting issues with the trackpad, and Windows' Device Manager claims things are working fine. But absolutely no trackpad input works, and from my few hours of searching, nobody else with my model is reporting the same issue. \nAnyways, any troubleshooting tips are greatly appreciated -- as well as potential advice for a possible part replacement.\nThanks a lot in advance.\n\nA: Before you do anything hastily, try resetting your NVRAM: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063\nThis will clear several hardware-related settings and may resolve your situation.\nIf not, try creating a bootable installer (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372), boot from it and check if your trackpad works there. If it does, backup and reinstall your OS.\nThe alternative would be to open up the device and check if the trackpad connection is properly attached. Sometimes (although very rarely) the plug can become loose, likely due to radical temperature changes. You should only attempt this if you're comfortable with electronics repair and following a guide on a site like iFixIt. They also have parts for self-repair.\nIf the latter doesn't help, sometimes disconnecting the battery and reconnecting it works, as this will clear any battery-buffered settings remaining.\nIn case all else fails, I suggest purchasing a replacement part through iFixIt and following a guide to exchange the trackpad – if you're at all open to self-repair. Having it exchanged by a shop is always going by to be vastly more expensive. The upside being that they're usually required to provide a certain warranty period for repairs. This is not a complicated repair, so you may want to try it yourself. \n", "Q: Why do text messages not appear when off of wi-fi? I have an iPhone 4 (iOS 7) with cell plan but no data. When texting with non-iPhone users, I get the texts to and from no problem. When texting with iPhone users, though, the messages will only appear when I'm on Wi-Fi. It appears that when iPhone users (like my wife) try to send me a text message, it defaults on their end to iMessage, and those messages won't appear until I reconnect with Internet.\nI can send text messages to everyone at any time no problem. Shouldn't messages that can't go through as iMessage be delivered as text? Do I need to delete my Apple ID from Messages to ensure that it only attempts text messages (but then I won't be able to share pictures/etc. via Messages when I AM on Wi-Fi)?\n\nA: iMessage is designed to prefer sending a message over Apple's servers vs sending via the carrier's SMS system.\nWhen you send a message, iMessage checks to see if the recipient is registered with Apple's Messages server. If the target you are messaging is not registered with Apple's Messages server (ie they use an Android phone), your iPhone will send the message via SMS.This uses the carrier's Voice protocols, not Data protocols. This is why you can send a text even without a data plan or with a 'dumb' phone.\nWhen sending to a Registered Messages user, iMessages will send a message via Apple's Messages server. This requires a DATA connection. Apple assumes every iPhone has a Data connection, and since iMessages is designed to NOT use SMS (saving the user money), it will wait until it gets a data connection before sending the message. A Data connection is either EDGE/3G/4G from the carrier, or Wifi.\nThis is why you can send to a non-iPhone user right away, but an iPhone user does not get the message promptly.\nNow, Apple didn't assume everyone pays for text messages, so in case they actually have a texting plan, and PREFER to send via SMS, there is a setting in iMessages that will send a message via SMS, if it fails to send via the preferred Data connection. While by default iMessages will not send Registered users via SMS, its easy to tell it to do so. Simply go into iMessages settings, and enable the 'Send via SMS\" setting, and you will be able to send to other iPhone users.\n\nVery long additional info:\nMessages is really a combination of SMS + Instant Messaging services. For users of iDevices, it really is a great experience and how a message is delivered is seamless. However, if you use other devices, or if your device is not 'standard' in some way, Messages can be difficult to manage and understand.\nSince Messages combines both SMS and IM, it allows Messages to be delivered via both methods. \"IM\" style messages are delivered via the Apple Message Server, while SMS messages are sent via the carrier service. Where it gets confusing is that even iDevices that have no carrier service at all, such as iPod Touch and some iPads, can send Messages.\nThe Confusion\nIf all devices had carrier services, this would be simple: if data service was available, Apple Messages service would send via data, and use SMS all other times. But since all devices do not have carrier services, it gets tricky: An iPhone can send a SMS to another device, and data-based Messages to any iDevice. Of course, it can't send a SMS to an iDevice that does not have carrier service.  Likewise, an iDevice without carrier service can not send a SMS to an iDevice, nor any other device, but they can send a data-based Message to any iDevice. Here is a summary:\n\niPhone > iDevice:   Messages (data) only\niPhone > iPhone:    Messages and SMS\nAndroid > iPhone:   SMS only\niDevice > iPhone:   Messages only\niPhone > Android:   SMS only\niDevice > Android:  not possible with Messages\nAndroid > iDevice:  not possible with Messages.\n\nWhere things get really confusing is when you have registered BOTH a telephone number on your iPhone, and an email address with the Apple Messages Server. If you have an iPhone, it will default to registering your phone number, allowing you to add an email address. an iDevice will allow only an email address, since it does not have a phone number.\nFor iDevice and iPhone uses, they do not notice or care which contact form was used to send the message: either will do. But in order to send to a non-iDevice, a user of an iPhone MUST send to a phone number (since it goes via SMS). But an iDevice can not send to a non-registered non-iDevice, such as an Android phone at all, since it does not have SMS capability. Nor can an Android phone send to an iDevice over SMS for the same reason.\nTherefore, when there is a mix of iDevices, iPhones and Android phones, the user must carefully choose what contact form to use. For example, I have an Android phone, an iPad, and a Mac. I can send Messages to my wife's iPhone from my iPad, to either her phone number or email address, both of which are registered. But to send her a message from my Android, I can only use her phone number. When she contacts me however, she must think first: if she messages me at my email address, it will go to my iPad and Mac, but in order to reach my Android phone, she must choose my phone number. Since most people simply open existing conversations, this gets really confusing it they were conversing using a different contact form.\nYour device problems:\nI believe your issue is that your iPhone is 'non-standard' in that you do not have a carrier data plan. Therefore, it behaves much like an iDevice like an iPod Touch. Only if an iPod Touch has wifi will Messages work. But since you have SMS, you are able to send an SMS, and likely receive an SMS from non-iDevices. But if another iDevice sends to your registered email, it will fail, until you are on Wifi. I suspect this is true if you send to a registered iphone phone number too: Messages is going to try long and hard to send via data, so will wait until connected. You can force it to use SMS as discussed above.\nSo, carefully look to see what contact form your wife and you are using when you use Messages. If your wife is sending you Messages using your registered email address, they will not arrive on your phone till you get Wifi, whereas if she is sending to your phone number, you will likely get it right away. An Android will be able to text you immediately, since it is sending via SMS.  I suggest that you both use the phone number only (and set her phone to send via SMS). You can register to receive Messages sent to a registered phone number via your Mac Messages as well, so that you can receive Messages sent to the iPhone via both iPhone and Mac.\n\nA: As your device is registered with iMessage, their devices will attempt to send iMessage first.\nThey need to change their setting to send as SMS if iMessage fails (Settings → iMessage).\n", "Q: What is the difference between a 32 and a 64 bit installation on a 64 bit machine? I'm about to install Eclipse on my McBook Pro (2.4GHz Core 2 Duo - so 64 bits if I'm not mistaken). What are the consequences of installing a 64 vs a 32 bit package?\n\nA: The main difference between 32-bit processors and 64-bit processors is the speed they operate. 64-bit processors can come in dual core, quad core, and six core versions for home computing (with eight core versions coming soon). Multiple cores allow for increase processing power and faster computer operation. Thus, software programs that require many calculations to function operate faster on the multi-core 64-bit processors.\nAnother big difference between 32-bit processors and 64-bit processors is the maximum amount of memory (RAM) that is supported. 32-bit computers support a maximum of 3-4GB of memory, whereas a 64-bit computer can support memory amounts over 4 GB.\n\n\n*\n\n*More bits means that data can be processed more accurately and in larger chunks.\n\n*More bits means our system can point to or address a larger number of locations in physical memory.\n\n\n\nSources / more info: here and here.\n", "Q: Graphics card confusion and pro apps I'm doing a report and researching various Mac graphics cards and how they would work or not work with pro apps. I'm very confused by all of the terminology and specifications, so I hope I can formulate this question clearly.\nI'm looking specifically at Final Cut Pro. The graphics card requirements (as described in http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4664), are as follows:\n- OpenCL-capable graphics card or Intel HD Graphics 3000 or later\n- 256MB of VRAM  (1GB recommended for 4K)\n\nThe top item isn't the issue. The 256MB of VRAM is tripping me up.\nOn this page (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3246), Apple describes dynamic allocation for memory. For example, a MacBook Pro with Intel Iris Pro graphics \"dynamically allocates up to 1.5 GB of system memory.\" I understand that the 1.5GB comes from regular system RAM. Does that memory act as the \"VRAM\" that Final Cut Pro needs? I'm confused because I read that the Iris Pro also has 128MB of its own memory.\nFor the discrete graphics cards (NVIDIA GeForce 320M for example), it says that a base of 256MB is allocated. Does this mean that the discrete graphics card has 256MB on its own, but can also receive more from the system memory, a la the integrated cards?\nLastly, how different would the performance be for Final Cut Pro (or similar apps) between the Iris Pro graphics and the discrete card? If someone wants to use Final Cut Pro, is the discrete card a necessity?\n\nA: \nDoes that memory act as the \"VRAM\" that Final Cut Pro needs?\n\nThe integrated Intel Iris graphics chips contain onboard memory that act as L4 cache this helps speed up access to the shared system RAM, but doesn't replace it as the backing store for graphics data.\n\nDoes this mean that the discrete graphics card has 256MB on its own, but can also receive more from the system memory, a la the integrated cards?\n\nThe discrete card has its own RAM, placed near to the GPU and connected to the GPU with a private buss. Additional RAM from the system memory cannot be used with discrete cards. Really, you wouldn't want to -- it would slow down its processing capabilities.\n\nLastly, how different would the performance be for Final Cut Pro (or similar apps) between the Iris Pro graphics and the discrete card? If someone wants to use Final Cut Pro, is the discrete card a necessity?\n\nThis is hard to answer definitely. It depends on what a user is trying to do in Final Cut Pro. Certainly the discrete should out perform the integrated graphics setup when the workload starts to turn more demanding but OpenCL performance is proving to be almost on par for the integrated cards with the discrete cards in the latest Retina MacBook Pros.\nHere is an article that has some discrete vs. integrated FCP benchmarking information in it. It points to this other article that has a choice quote in it:\n\nIn the past we sneered at the integrated GPUs and their puny performance. Not any more. The Intel Iris and Iris Pro are every bit the match or master of discrete NVIDIA Mobile GPUs -- at least when it comes to OpenCL acceleration.\n\nWhere the discrete cards win is in OpenGL-based workloads.\nIdeally you'd run your own benchmarks on the hardware with representative workloads. If this isn't feasible, you're stuck relying on the benchmarks done by others like those two sites above to make your decisions.\n", "Q: Can I retrieve deleted photos (beyond 1,000) from Photo Stream?

I followed a tutorial for installing and currently my issues are these:\n\n\n*\n\n*I am not sure whether Hadoop is actually \"correctly\" installed. Typing hadoop version shows 2.4.1 but running start-all.sh shows a long list of warnings.\n\n*I thought about checking whether Hadoop is correctly installed by running a sample program(WordCount.java) as is provided everywhere on the net. Now I have Eclipse Luna installed but the guide I followed for illustrating \"How to integrate Eclipse with Hadoop\" tells me to import all the jars from '../libexec' but for Hadoop 2.4.1 there are no jars, at least none that i could find.\n\n*Currently in my /usr/local/ there are 3 directories named hadoop-2.4.1, hadoop(a symlink to this i suppose) and a directory named Cellar. Now all three directories have some subdirectory by name Hadoop and many other subdirectories like lib, lib exec. Now how do I know which ones for which purpose. Every other tutorial refers to a different directory to use, the one that got me Hadoop installed never mentions a bit about how to test a sample Hadoop map reduce application.\n\n\nI have even tried the HortonWorks Sandbox for Apache Hadoop. But my machines 4GB RAM seems tiny for that mammoth application to run and my system hanged!! I have to get this working for my project related stuff, looking forward for sincere help.\n\nA: *\n\n*In my case start-all.sh tells it is depraciated and i should use start-dfs.sh and start-yarn.sh. Both give no errors nor warnings on output (for both local and local cluster hdfs).\n\n*In Hadoop 2.4.1 jars with shared libraries are located under /libexec/share/hadoop/ and following subdirectories. To run simple MapReduce apps it is enough to add mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core-2.4.1.jar and common/hadoop-common-2.4.1.jar.\n\n*I use the brew version, so mine is located under /usr/local/Cellar/hadoop/2.4.1/. To make it easier, I use env variable to point to the directory.\nI'm not sure, but 4 GiB of ram should be enough to test the environment with some apps. It should not hang.\n", "Q: Live dashboard for presentations I run my school's theatre, and I'm looking for some kind of software that we can put on the projector screen before our school assembly. I want to have some elements update themselves automatically (for example; local weather forecast, time/date, news ticker), and some elements that I can edit myself (to insert school announcements, sports games results, etc).\nPowerpoint/Keynote would be perfect because of their customizability, except neither of them allow you to insert live data (weather, news, etc) (Powerpoint Windows does, but not for mac).\nDoes anyone know of some (mac compatible) software or a website that has this functionality?\n\nA: I use Dashing for this.

The problem is: in iTunes, in the photo tab, I have only one option in the \"Sync photos from\" dropdown, iPhoto, BUT when I select it, it's the Aperture library that shows up.\nIt seems to me that there was a time when I had both options, iPhoto and Aperture, in the dropdown. It must have come from an update…\nAny ideas on how to sort thing up?\n\nA: Ok, found it. \nYou just have to create a new library (open iPhoto with the alt key pressed), quit iPhoto, and open it again with alt pressed and select the original library file. Open iTunes, et voilà!\n", "Q: Remove silence from end of GarageBand track I have just edited a song in GarageBand on OS X. At the end of the music I discovered that I have almost 5 minutes of silence at the end of the track after the music stops.\nI know how that track initially got extended: I brought in other tracks that initially were long but extracted just short clips to insert into my project.  Now I have extra silence on the end of the track—i.e when the music ends the CD doesn't stop until it gets through that extra 5 minutes of silence.  In my situation I need to burn the CD directly from GarageBand and not iTunes.\nCan anyone tell me how to delete the 5 minutes of extra silence on the end after my music track ends?\n\nA: Define a loop region at the top of the timeline in the yellow bar. When exporting from GarageBand, preference will go to this region for the bounds of the track.\n", "Q: How to fix rabbitmq installation?

Replace the HOSTS list with the list of hosts you want to report on.\n\nA: To ping multiple hosts with the red/green feedback image you need to run multiple instances of the ping geeklet.

I am very confused with this problem. So I just recently purchased a 8 core 3.0ghz Mac Pro 2,1 and I upgraded the memory with 16gbs of hynix ram, and everything worked great the computer was reading all 16gbs of memory and I thought all was well but when I tried to restart the computer it just shuts off and the screen goes black and there are no start up chimes or anything. So I have to hold the power button and shut it off all the way and then reboot it and everything works fine again until I try to restart it again? Any help would be appreciated. I am running OSX Lion! P.S there are no led lights that are illuminated on the memory boards!\n\nA: -What happens if you take the memory out and replace it with the original RAM?  Does it work?  \n-Have you tried re-seating the RAM? (e.g. take it out and put it in again, making sure it's fitting in the slots properly, and also making sure there's no dust on the RAM or in the slots...)\n-Is the RAM PC5300 DDR2 ECC?\n-Have you tried resetting the SMU?  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\nGive those things a go and see what happens.\n", "Q: how to annotate scanned PDF on MAC I've a scanned PDF and i can't seem to highlight the text of course using the preview on my OS X, is there a software that do that like in windows?\nThanks\n\nA: Highlighting text in a PDF assumes that there is text in the PDF to begin with.\nWhen you scan a document to PDF, it is simply an image. You should still be able to use the annotation tools available in preview to draw on it and add notes, but you will not be able to highlight or copy text from it because there literally is no text in the document.\nThere is, however, a type of software called OCR, for Optical Character Recognition, that can be used to programmatically \"read\" the letters in the image of your document and write out accurate text to the PDF. Some of this software is pretty good, but it is rarely free. Some scanners come with OCR software, and the you may be able to find some software online that will let you try it out for free.\nRunning an image PDF through OCR software will provide it with text data that you can then highlight using the annotation tools in preview.\n\nA: You can use ABBYY FineReader to recognise the text in the scanned PDF:\n\nCreate searchable PDFs ready for archiving\nWith a few mouse clicks you can turn paper documents into truly searchable compressed PDF files for archiving. Information in such archives can be easily retrieved at any time you need it by using keyword search, while document compression reduces the amount of disk space used.

According to this I need an external HD.  I have imac 10.6.8.  Various directions seem to say I can find a disc on my computer except I get no prompt for that.  By the date, Airport, and Time Machine etc,I clicked on \"Browse other Time Machine disc, and underneath \"Open Time Machine preferences\". \nThis contains Time Machine backup disk but it is empty.\n\nA: Your iMac has only a single disk in it, and that is the one you will be backing up. You cannot use the same disk to back up to. You need to get an external device to hold the backup data: either an external disk (that connects to your iMac via USB, FireWire, or Thunderbolt), or an Apple Time Capsule appliance (which also acts as a wireless network router).

There is this feature in iOS 7 called 'save to home screen', I'm looking for something similar on OS X.\n\nA: The only way I've ever seen this done on OS X is via the Fluid app. Fluid is just a WebKit wrapper around a specific URL and without the browser navigation tidbits in the windowing. It presents the website as an \"app\" but it's still running in a browser window, albeit one with fewer decorations.\n\nFluid lets you create a Real Mac App (or \"Fluid App\") out of any website or web application, effectively turning your favorite web apps into OS X desktop apps.\n\nIt's free to use but for $4.99 you can get some features that make it a little cooler. Most importantly you can get per-instance cookie stores so you don't cross-pollute your apps.\nI used to use it for Fogbugz and it was alright. Not great, but decent. And I used to get all kinds of questions about the Fogbugz icon in my dock from my colleagues. It's still possible to click away from the main app in the Fluid-ized version of it, leaving you on an unintended web page with not a lot of nav options to get back to the main app. That was probably my biggest gripe with it.\n\nA: Not clear if op is asking about iOS or OS X. Ian C answered for OS X. In iOS, AFIK all that's possible is to place an icon on the home screen, which is simply a shortcut to open the web page in Safari.\n", "Q: Flipboard-like iOS app for \"reading\" the whole web I like reading stuff online, and I like flipping through \"pages\". There's some apps with great UIs like Flipboard, but they only work on pre-curated content.\nIs there any app like Flipboard that will let me search Google and open any URL I find?\n\nA: You could make a Fluid app of Feedly and subscribe to completely random feeds so you're surprised by what turns up and/or even subscribe to the Pocket, Readability, etc. feeds of completely random people and/or the front page of Reddit. If you set Fluid to use Safari you can \"flip\" through the pages using the regular OS gestures. And Feedly allows you to choose from a variety of presentation modes. You could, also, do this with any desktop feed reader like Reeder 2, NetNewsWire, etc., but as far as I know creating a Feedly app with Fluid with Safari set as the browser may be the only way to \"flip through pages\" of completely random content.\n", "Q: How to modify app expose to show only open windows of current application on current desktop?

Sometimes it's as easy as the cable not sitting well in the connector, and that could mean it connects the necessary pins for detection/sync but not for actual display. \nOne other thing I could think of is if the monitor has a source selector, i e if it has multiple inputs for VGA/DVI etc, and the right one isn't chosen.

Any thoughts?\nWhat I am trying to do in the end is paste rich formatted text into Evernote.\n\nA: As aglasser commented, you can use textutil like so:\ncreate-codeblock | textutil -stdin -format html -convert rtf -stdout | pbcopy\n\n", "Q: “Sign in to download from the App Store” dialog does not allow paste OSX 10.8.5\nI am using lastPass and have the appleID in there so I can copy and paste whenever needed.\nSometimes when I am told I have an upgrade I am asked to sign in to the app store.\nAnnoying but ok. So I have generated a quite safe password - why am I not able to paste that into the password field? Any setting I can change?\n(I obscured the appleID in the picture below)\n\n\nA: You can use Keyboard Maestro with a macro such as this which takes the current clipboard and inserts its contents by typing it rather than pasting, allowing the clipboard to be entered into fields where pasting is forbidden.\n        \nAlso, for what it's worth, OS X 10.10 Yosemite does let you paste into the aforementioned field and I believe so does 10.9 Mavericks.\n\nA: AppleScript\nSo, as I wrote in the comments, you can do this with AppleScript. Here I show how to create a service that types your clipboard using 'keystrokes'.\nFirst create an automator 'Service' project and add a 'Run AppleScript' module. Enter the following script.\nset clipboardText to (the clipboard as text)\nset theCharacters to characters of clipboardText\nrepeat with char in theCharacters\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        keystroke char\n    end tell\nend repeat\n\nreturn input\n\n\nNow you can find this 'Service' in your 'Service' menu.\n\nYou can also create a keyboard shortcut (for example ctrlshiftv) in your System Preferences [Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Services]. Now you can 'type' your clipboard anywhere when pressing ctrlshift.\n\n\nA: One possibility - right click & select Paste from the drop menu.\nWorks for several 'awkward to paste to' destinations.\n\nA: Yosemite (possibly even Mavericks) solved the issue\n", "Q: Switch input language depending on physical keyboard attached I use a swedish keyboard at home, and an english at work.

Every day I have to switch the input language manually back and forth, and for every app I'm using it seems.\nIs there any way to just have the input language match whatever keyboard I'm using, automagically?\n\nA: This type of functionality is sometimes called location management. Basically, the machine determines its location using hints from network connections. In the Mac OS 9 days, Location Manager was built in to the OS.

Is it factory locked, country locked or something else? How can I fix it?\n\nA: Depending on which model you bought in the US, you may or may not have a sim in the phone.\nSounds as though you have a sim, you will need to remove the US sim, buy a sim from a provider in the country where you are going to use it (or enable roaming - although it does not sound as if you are having a roaming issue).\n\nYou noted in your comments that you used other sims, if so then:\nYES, your phone is most probably locked to a US carrier.\nTo answer your question how to fix it.

Your model was subject to a replacement program for the logicboard due to a defective GPU, though it no longer is active. Apple may or may not still replace your logicboard. It is ultimately at the discretion of the store manager. If you don't qualify, your other option would be a flat rate repair, for ~$300, which Apple will repair anything wrong with the machine for this fee.

The error message is: \n\nProfile Installation Failed\n  The request timed out\n\nDoes anyone know what the device is trying to do at this point? I am thinking the iPad is trying to communicate with Apple, but I am not sure.\n\n\n\nA: The profile information states that the profile contains a 'device enrollment challenge'. A device enrollment challenge requires connection to a device enrollment server—not Apple's servers, but another server that the payload is informed of.\nWhen you press Install and enter your passcode if appropriate, all the payloads that are contained within a mobile configuration profile are activated. The device enrollment challenge payload attempts to connect to the aforementioned server at this point. It is at this stage that the error shows: \"The request timed out\". This is to inform you that the server that the payload is attempting to contact is unavailable and the request has timed out.\nTo fix this, you'll need to allow whatever is preventing the connection to succeed. The problem may not be the device though—the server itself may be unavailable. Unfortunately, a 'request timed out' error is very broad and could be caused by many different reasons, but the basis is that the server (again, not Apple's) is unavailable to the device requesting the connection.\n\nA: I have experianced this same issue myself and found that if you connect to the wi-fi of the building that you want to connect to the server of it will connect every time....i hope this helps\n", "Q: How to install .dict.dz/.index files to OSX dictionary.app I have a dictionary that consists of a dictionary.dict.dz and dictionary.index files.

Where can I get a copy of the S/W Lion?\nI want to \"clean install OS X Lion\" on my MBA 13\" 2012, like it originally came.\nAirRay\n\nA: If your Mac originally came with OS X Lion, is capable of doing internet recovery, and you have a WPA/WPA2 network, then booting using Internet Recovery will enable you to install OS X Lion. To boot into Internet Recovery, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown your Mac\n\n*Press the power button\n\n*Quickly release it and hold down Command-Option-R\n\n*Keep on holding it until a globe shows up, or a list of WiFi networks.\nFor more assistance, visit https://www.apple.com/osx/recovery/\nIf that is not an option, you can purchase the OS X Lion download code from here. Upon recieving it, go to the Mac App Store and redeem the code. It will download like any other app. If you are installing it on a Mac running OS X 10.8 or later, you will need to create a bootable USB and wipe all your data, as the installer will not allow you to install 10.7 on a newer OS release.

This seems like an awful lot to me and occasionally my computer is slow.  Is there any recommended maximum number of files to have?  Even though a lot of the files are little would they cause the file system index to get really large and unwieldy?\n\nA: As pointed out in a comment, you're using a command that is locating files within directories below the directory in question.    While you may only be able to count to about 20 (fingers and toes) OS's are much much better at dealing with large numbers of files, and this is really an issue you shouldn't worry about. \nNow if your computer is slow, you might want to look into what is using memory.\n\nA: If a directory grows larger than the directory cache, access to it would indeed be slowed down significantly. A users home directory is one of the directories that gets traversed often, especially since many programs started by and for the user start with it as their working directory. \nThis definitely is a reason to keep the home directory itself organized, and shift clutter into subdirectories.\nAs Ian pointed out in his comment, your home directory may be perfectly organized though - all you have been looking at is the collated number of files and directories contained within the structure of your home directory, no matter how deep.\nTo find out how many entries your home directory is containing directly, you can use find restricted by depth:\nfind $HOME -depth 1 |wc -l\nTo anyone wanting to circumvent the snags of a less-than-optimal directory structure, the 2015 article by Tsai et al., How to get more value from your file system directory cache would probably be one of the easier introductions to the subject.\n", "Q: Completely restore root and home folder after many problems with Macports and Homebrew I had a long day battling with installing a LAMP environment with Macports. I installed several things, had many problems, tried uninstalling them (not sure if I did), and on and on. Then, I tried doing the same thing in Homebrew. Same story. I then completely reinstalled Mavericks and did it all over again. \nThe problem is that I don't know what files should be there and which shouldn't. (I'm pretty much a beginner with this). If I knew, I guess I wouldn't have to reinstall the OS again. How can I completely restore it to what it was before I even opened the Terminal?\nHere is what I have in the root directory:\n\nAnd in my user directory:\n\n(I can upload more images or ls outputs if needed)\n\nA: All those files look normal to me, including the hidden ones.  Unless you had/have an active backup from a date before your changes, there is no way to \"restore\" it back to an exact state before \"opening Terminal\". (That made me chuckle)  That being said...\nShould be possible to back up user data (your home folder entirely), erase your hard drive (from the Recovery partition if necessary), reinstall OS X, and move your user data back.  The sacrifice there is any system-level applications/preferences that you've set.  However, it's likely the Homebrew/MacPorts settings on the system-level that are causing your issues.\nIt really boils down to how much time you want to spend digging through documentation, trying different things, changing different settings to get your system back to the way you want it.  If you have the time and patience, it will be much more rewarding and (possibly) less impactful to your OS X environment.\nOn the flip side, it's sometimes easier (and more time-effective) to just \"nuke and pave\" as we call it. :)\n", "Q: Dragon Dictation mouse clicks I use a speak recognition program Called Dragon Dictation. When I work I use the program for mouse clicks but I have to say \"mouse click\" which doesn't seem like a big deal but when you're saying it 100 times a day it would be so much easier to just say \"click\". Most of the commands I can see in AppleScript code and I can copy and paste it to make my own commands. However, the mouse clicks are not shown for some reason.\nUpdate:\nDragon dictation is no longer supported on Mac computers. Here is an alternative for mouse clicks: https://github.com/bobbymay/Dictation-for-macOS\n\nA: You can just install a command-line utility for clicking and then call it via a Dragon dictate command. the utility can be found here: \nhttps://github.com/BlueM/cliclick\nthen just make a Dragon shell command like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*name: \"click\"\n\n*Shell script: /usr/local/bin/cliclick c:+0,+0\n\n\nyou can do the same for double-click, but for right-click, and option-click you need to use some AppleScript.

In both cases the podcast app still lists the podcasts I subscribe to, and some episodes under those folders. The episodes listed include cloud as well as downloaded episodes. The episodes are playable. An example of such a podcast is Freakonomics Radio, but all my subscriptions are listed.\n\nA: Turning off the sync options will stop your phone syncing new episodes, but it won't remove the episodes that have already synced.\nIf there are episodes on your iPhone that you want to remove just drag the entry for the episode to the right to reveal a Delete button.

I have a gmail count, and it's configured properly. I can get the incoming messages all the time, but I can not send any. Also the connection doctor says the server is available.\nDoes anyone have an answer to that?\nMy mail version is Version 7.3 (1878.6).\nmy osx version is 10.9.4.\n\nA: There appears to be a problem on Gmail's side with their SMTP servers. This seems to have afflicted all non-browser based email clients that rely on SMTP and is apparently affecting a large number of users.\nBy the looks of this thread, it appears that they are actively working on a solution.\nI think for now, all we can do is wait on google to hopefully fix the problem on their end.\nUpdate: the issue has now been resolved and outgoing gmail should work through Apple mail.\n\nA: I had the same exact issue. I started using the application specific password generated by Google before I had the issues. When you set up your account in Apple mail, you are asked to enter the application specific password. I had no issues receiving gmail after that, but also could not send gmail through Apple mail. I had to go into the advanced settings and change the password for outgoing mail (i.e. there are 2 places you must change your password) and since then I've been able to both receive and send. Here's the second place to change your password:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Mail and choose Preferences from the Mail menu.\n\n*Click Accounts in the Preferences window.\n\n*Select (highlight) your account on the left side of the window\n\n*Click the Account Information pane.\n\n*From the \"Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP)\" pop-up menu, choose Edit SMTP Server list.\n\n*Click on Advanced tab.\n\n*Change the password to your Application Specific Password (same one you entered on the account information page)\n\n\nThis worked for me.\n\nA: Go to Mail -> Preferences (shortcut Cmd + ,), then Accounts tab and Disable - Enable your GMail account.\n", "Q: How do I capture a screenshot of an iPad app that has a lot of HORIZONTAL scroll?

Is it possible to automatically connect to a VPN when one is connected to a WIFI access point?\nTo manually connect to a VPN after connecting to a WIFI access point works, but it is so easy to forget.\nI am using Mavericks on a Macbook Pro Retina.\n\nA: ControlPlane\nYou want to have an automated action after you connect to a certain WiFi point. An easy way to do this, is using ControlPlane (formally known as MarcoPolo). This software makes your computer context aware and can execute scripts and programs when your location changes. Some examples that ControlPlane is aware of:\n\n*\n\n*Current Audio Output device (headphones/internal speakers)\n\n*Discoverable Bluetooth devices\n\n*Advertised Bonjour (Zeroconf) services\n\n*Attached FireWire devices\n\n*Assigned IP addresses\n\n*Ambient Light level\n\n*Attached Monitors\n\n*Active Network Links\n\n*Power source (power adapter/battery)\n\n*Running Applications\n\n*Current Time Of Day\n\n*Attached USB devices\n\n*Visible WiFi networks\n\nedit (21 aug 2014, thanks to @Rainer):\nMarcopolo is now ControlPlane.\nControlPlane was created using code from version 2.5.1 of the MarcoPolo project still available at http://www.symonds.id.au/marcopolo/.  ControlPlane is a direct port of MarcoPolo and in fact, much of the configuration from MarcoPolo still works with ControlPlane, just better!\nControlPlane supports 32 and 64bit Intel based Macs running Snow Leopard through Lion.\n", "Q: Unable to send emails from gmail account on iOS 7.1 Everything worked fine for a long time, until today. Suddenly I am unable to send any emails using my gmail account from both my iOS 7.1 devices. I am getting this message:\n\nUnable to send email\nA copy has been placed in your Outbox. The\n  recipient \"[MY email address]\" was rejected by the server because it\n  does not allow relaying.\n\nOne curious thing about it: it shows my email address. No matter what recipient I am entering.\nAll suggestions I've been able to unearth in the last hour of searching say that outgoing mail settings are incorrect. But both my devices do not allow me to edit or disable primary Gmail server. Everything is grayed out, and I'm not able to save changes when I switch \"Enabled\" flag to off.\nI also tried deleting the account completely, and adding it anew. Still no luck.\nPS: Incoming email works just fine. Only outgoing is having issues.\n\nA: This appears to be a problem with Google's SMTP servers, affecting all clients on all platforms (excluding web) and preventing the sending of email.\nThis has now been fixed:\n\nThis issue is now resolved.

Now my home screen does not show anything. I want my home screen icons and apps back. How can I do that, or how can I reinstall them? I want this screen, kindly help me out.\n\n\nA: If you have not powered off the phone recently, try that. A reboot often works wonders. Also what happens if you swipe right to left, do you get other apps? Are there 2 or more dots centered just above the dock? What I am getting at is it may be that you just have a blank home screen and all your apps have somehow moved to other screens. Swiping might reveal them and allow you to move them back.\nWiping just the network setting should affect nothing else. I've done it many times and never an app out of place.\nHopefully you have backed up your phone recently, you may have to restore from backup.\n\nA: As mentioned above, powering the phone off and turning it back on is one option. \nAnother option is to reset it which involves pressing and holding both the power button (top right) and the home button (bottom front center).\nThe reset process should not affect user data, but should reset some settings that may cause the screen to display correctly.\nThere is also a software reset (inside iOS 7) through General -> Reset -> Reset Home Screen Layout. I have not personally tried this but it may correct your situation.\nThe Reset page also includes reset options that erase all data and settings. You may want to try one of those.\nHave you backed up your phone to your computer lately?\nIf none of these options work, and the phone is new, I suggest taking it back to the store where you made the purchase.\nHTH.\n", "Q: Same user multiple times - Sharing & Permissions My account at work (rtonneyck), is a Windows domain account.

This came back to haunt me though when I installed a Windows VM in Parallels, and it broke the Ctrl+Alt+Del key combo to login to Windows in the VM (since the Ctrl key is mapped to Command).  I would like to create a shortcut mapping Command+Option+Del to the Parallels menu item Devices -> Keyboard -> Ctrl+Alt+Delete, but the shortcuts section of System Preferences -> Keyboard does not allow me to use the Del key.\nI tried following the instructions in this answer, adding this:\n<key>Ctrl+Alt+Delete</key>\n<string>@~&#x7f;</string>\n\nto each of\n~/Library/Preferences/com.parallels.Parallels.plist\n~/Library/Preferences/com.parallels.Parallels Desktop.plist\n~/Library/Preferences/com.parallels.desktop.console.plist\n\nbut the key combo is not activating the menu item to send Ctrl+Alt+Del when adding the XML to any of those.\nWhat am I doing wrong here?  Do I need something special to activate the options in the \"keyboard\" submenu of \"Device\"?  Do I have the wrong code for the Del key?  Am I putting the XML in the wrong plist file(s)?\n[Edit]\nThe problem is worse than I thought, because the keys stay switched in Windows.  Is there a way to set the modifier key behavior on a per-application basis?  It would be great if I could swap the Command and Ctrl keys generally, and swap them back in Parallels.\n\nA: I did not find an answer to the base question, but I did locate a sufficiently good workaround.  Karabiner offers finer-grained control of keys than OSX's keyboard settings, including the ability to add exceptions to key switching.  I used these settings:\nKarabiner -> Change Key\n    Change Command_L Key -> Command_L to Control_L (except Virtual Machine, RDC)\n    Change Control_L Key -> Control_L to Command_L (except Virtual Machine, RDC)\n\nNow all of the Ctrl keyboard shortcuts I am accustomed to work in both OSX and my VMs.\n\nA: I have always been able to perform the Ctrl+Alt+Del key combo functionality in Parallels using Command+Ctrl+Option+Del. As far as I know this is default functionality (based on the fact that I did not play around with the key mappings in Parallels, and this key combo has always worked for me).\nHowever, I don't know if remapping the keys or playing around with Parallels' settings has broken that functionality for you...\nCurrently, I am using Mac OSX Mavericks with Parallels Desktop 8 (haven't bothered upgrading to 9 yet, though I doubt they would have changed this functionality).\n[Edit]\nTo address your edit: The Command key seems to have a double functionality of both being the Ctrl and ⊞ Win keys in Parallels (or at least on my Mac it does... This may be an option I turned on in Parallels' options). However, it has a preference for being the ⊞ Win key.\nTherefore, in Parallels using Command+C and Ctrl+C will both copy, and Command+V and Ctrl+V will both paste.\nAlternatively, using Command+D will show the desktop in Parallels, the way that pressing ⊞ Win+D does on a regular Windows PC.\nHowever, keep in mind that, as mentioned above, Command has a preference for being the ⊞ Win key.\nHere is an example of where that may come into play:\nOn a regular Windows PC, Ctrl+F can be used to search in a program, while ⊞ Win+F is the shortcut key to find in files.\nTherefore, in Parallels, Ctrl+F can be used to search in a program, and Command+F is the shortcut key to find in files.\n\nA: Actually with the new Karabiner Elements version (Sierra upwards) it would be easiest to temporarily \"Quit K E\" via its menu bar icon or to create a second \"Profile\" (K-E tab) which contains only rules/modifications you need in Parallels.\nCan be toggled in menu bar.\nNo tweaking, twitching or honky-tonky … ;-)\n", "Q: Make Macports use HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to fetch packages By default, Macports uses HTTP to fetch packages. For example:\n--->  Attempting to fetch port_cutleaves-0.1.4_0.darwin_10.noarch.tbz2 from http://lil.fr.packages.macports.org/port_cutleaves\n\nHow should a user configure Macports to use HTTPS (SSL/TLS) instead?\n\nA: The obvious solution would be to modify the source URLs for the packages. The source URLs for a lot of packages appears to be /opt/local/var/macports/sources/rsync.macports.org/release/tarballs/ports/_resources/port1.0/fetch/mirror_sites.tcl.\nHaving said that, I'm not sure whether it is a good idea to modify that file.\nIf you do a selfupdate your modified file will be replaced.\nAlso not all the mirrors are set up correctly to work with HTTPS. For example, the mirror in your example above http://lil.fr.packages.macports.org/ presents an error if you try to access it at https://lil.fr.packages.macports.org/ because the host name of the certificate doesn't match.\n\nA: Why would you want to? If you're worried about the integrity of the downloads, you should know that MacPorts will also download and verify a detached RSA signature for each binary archive it downloads – the public key used for verification comes to your local machine using a tamper-resistant path (either an installer .pkg signed with a DeveloperID certificate, or – in case of key updates – signed with the old key).\nFor distfiles (i.e. source tarballs of software MacPorts wants to build), multiple checksums stored in the Portfile need to match for MacPorts to accept the download as authentic. The Portfiles also come to your machine using a tamper-resistant path.\nReplying to your original question: You don't, the mirror infrastructure doesn't support it.\n", "Q: Is it possible to update Java7 without first uninstalling Java8? On my MacBook I've got Java 6 through 8 installed and I happen to need and use them all on a daily basis.

I homeschool my daughter and she takes several complex online classes.  The teachers want me to be able to listen in and also be able to talk from time to time.  I tried going without a mic, but there is way too much background noise for the listener.  Recently, I purchased two Turtle Beach Ear Force PLa Gaming Headsets.\nWhile they each work great individually we can't use them at the same time because, the Macbook makes you select a specific USB port. Is there some sort of USB splitter out there that would allow us to both plug into one USB port?  When we just had to worry about headphones and not a microphone, we used a Belkin F8V234AMOB 6-Inch Audio Y Cable. My hope is to find something similar for USB ports, but I'm open to other suggestions.\nThanks in advance for any and all advice!\n\nA: You don't need special hardware for this. Plug in both headphones, then open Audio Midi setup from /Applications/Utilities. Click the plus in the lower left corner and choose \"Create Multi-Output Device.\" Check the checkboxes beside both headphones in the new panel on the right. If you want to rename it, you can double click the new entry in the list on the left and give it a name like \"Both headphones.\"\nNow you can choose the Multi-Output Device as the audio output in System Preferences → Sound. (You can also easily change the output by holding the Option key and clicking the volume menu.)\n\nA: If you have two headsets of the same name (shows up as same name under audio settings), then it won't show you two devices under Audio Midi Setup as shown above...\n\"One big problem with multiple USB headsets on OSX. If you are using identical USB headsets with the same name, only one will show up in the sound panel. I believe this is a bug, because past OSX versions allowed me to see multiple USB headsets with the same name. However in 10.5.8 and in Snow Leopard, multiple headsets with the same device name no longer appear. It's a real pain for me, because I can only use one of my favorite headset on my Mac.\"\n\nA: The easiest way to ensure two devices appear in the macs audio system, is to use two different models of headset. \nI believe that a USB device can have some sort of ID number to allow the Mac to tell them apart, but many devices don’t set this up. This is true of the Yeti microphone. The manufacturer can reprogram that mic to have a different ID number on request, which solves the problem.\n", "Q: Why would my Mac be slow after inactivity and then get to full speed after 20-30 minutes of use? My Macbook appears to get slow after a period of inactivity and then get itself back to full speed after 20-30 minutes.\nWhile I have some ideas I'm wondering if anybody else has seen such behaviour or can offer some tips on how to investigate it further.\nI have 16GB of RAM and I tend to run a reasonable workload. I have VMWare Fusion with a Windows and an Ubuntu guest running as well as Eclipse and Chrome (and probably Mail and iTunes).\nOnce I'm done for a while I'll either shut the lid or just leave the machine on and open. What I notice is that when I come back to it it can be dreadfully slow. Eclipse or the Windows guest can sit there for a 10-30 minutes with a spinning icon or not doing much.\nAfter 20-30 minutes everything seems to come to full speed.\nMy guess is that MacOS is paging out everything in memory and then being forced to page it back in. However, I don't know enough about MacOS to provide evidence for this - nor to look for another explanation.\n\nA: The clearest way I can see to see whether data is being paged in or out of RAM is the command line program top. Open a Terminal and run top.\nWithin the first few lines of output look for  \"swapins\" and \"swapouts\". The values at the end tell you how many pages have been swapped in and out of memory. The values in the brackets are the delta for that update (top updates once a second by default).\nIf your Macbook is swapping Eclipse or your VMs back into RAM when you wake it or come back to it after leaving it for a while, then the swains number should be changing significantly each second.\n\n", "Q: Change the order of servers in \"Connect to Server\" window? Running Mavericks (OS X 10.9.4) is it possible to change the order that the \"favorite servers\" are displayed in?\nAllow me to explain a little more the use case. In Finder if one presses Command-K or uses the \"Go\" menu to \"Connect to Server...\" a dialog box appears. In the top portion of the dialog is the current server you are about to connect to and below it the servers you have indicated are your favorites. These favorites are set by clicking the + button to the right of server line at the top. After clicking the plus button, servers are added to the top of the favorite. This results in the most recent addition being at the top.\nThe server I want at the top of my favorites list is the one I am accessing most often, not the one that was just added. Ideally I would like to be able to place them in order as things change.\nTo illustrate further, right now my list looks like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Server 3\n\n*Server 7\n\n*Server 5\n\n*Server 1\n\n*Server 2\n\n*Server 4\n\n*Server 6\n\n\nI would like to make it look like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Server 1\n\n*Server 2\n\n*Server 3\n\n*Server 4\n\n*Server 5\n\n*Server 6\n\n*Server 7\n\n\nIs there a way to accomplish this task? \n\nA: This worked for me:\nOpen this file in XCode: ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist\nLook inside the favoriteservers container.  Drag the servers into your desired order.\n\nSave the file.\nLog out.\nLog in.\nDone.\nAlso!  It sure looks like you have a separate value for Name and URL there!  I haven't tried it but it certainly would be handy to have the list display human-readable values instead of stuff like afp://10.8.8.67\n\nA: The list is stored as an array in a dictionary named favoriteservers inside the ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist file.  You should be able to modify the array with a plist editor, so that they display in your preferred order.\n\nA: Unfortunately, as of MacOS 10.13 High Sierra, there is no favoriteservers in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist anymore.\nUnder current MacOS, it is stored as ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.sharedfilelist/com.apple.LSSharedFileList.FavoriteServers.sfl\nNow we only need to fighe out how to modify that sfl beast.\nSee also:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Where are the “Connect to Server” settings stored in Mac OS X?  \n\n*List Server Favorites in OS X 10.11 El Capitan\n\nA: In High Sierra you find the file in the path indicated by maosmurf.\nI've edited this file with Xmplify app (payment application but cheaper one). A simple xml editor.\nMaybe you can move all lines of every server and reorder this list. But I'm afraid to modify this files in my work machine and I don't know if it can be dangerous.\nMake backup and try if you want.\n\n\nA: After upgrading to High Sierra, my favorite servers list somehow got rearranged.  But I found an easy way to move any one server from the list to the top:  After opening the \"Connect to Server...\" dialog box, select the entry you want on the top.  It gets copied into the top \"Server Address\" field.  Instead of clicking on \"Connect\", click on the \"+\" as if to add it to the favorites list.  This moves the entry to the top.  Repeat until the list is in the desired order.  That's it.\nI realize the original question is pretty old, but maybe someone else is still searching for an answer.\n\nA: In MacOS Mojave, I have had inconsistent success with simply clicking on some of the entries in the list and dragging them. I'm not sure the rhyme or reason why some of them are draggable and others are not.\n", "Q: Time entries in calendar automatically display month/day/year When in month view, Calendar in Mavericks (os x 10.9.4) normally displays an event followed by the time.

I was using Mail.app v4.6 on my iMac and was happy with it until I upgraded to OS X 10.6.8. Now Mail.app crashes my computer whenever I open the application, which is often as it is the default mail application.\nCan I install a newer version of Mail.app without losing all of my saved emails, contacts, etc.? If so, how?\nShould I delete the whole thing and install a fresh version of Mail.app that I can run in OS X 10.6.8?\nMy iMac has a 2.16 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor and 3 GB of memory. Late 2006 model.\n\nA: The version of Mail.app available to you to is pinned to the version of OS X you're running as it is considered a core application that is bundled, shipped and installed with the operating system.\nIf you want a new version of Mail.app you'll need update OS X. Your iMac, assuming it's the Late 2006 model I think it is based on what you wrote, should be able to run OS X 10.7.x Lion. Upgrading to Lion is a fairly painless activity though you should be certain to follow best-practices and make a backup of your system before you do the upgrade. The upgrade tools will maintain all your Mail.app settings and you won't lose email, contacts or any other such thing like that.\nAlternatively you can look for a third party mail application that's compatible with OS X 10.6.8 and try running one of those. Honestly, I can't recall any that were 10.6.8 compatible off the top of my head though.\nA third option is to try and figure out what's keeping Mail.app from running on your machine. The best place to start is by looking in Console.app -- run Console.app and then start Mail.app and look at the error messages that are printed in the Console. They might shed some light on what's going wrong. Or they might form the basis of a new question here on Ask Different to figure out what's going wrong!\n", "Q: Grab the \"Active\" Window in Applescript I have a script which perform the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Load a file into a program (Subler — done separately, not in this script)\n\n*Confirm the loading of the file (this is where the script begins)\n\n*Saves the file\n\n*In the save location window it selects a specific directory to save the file in\n\n*Presses \"return\"\n\n\nI would like to know how to perform step 4 with the active (or last used) window instead of a specific window title.\nThis is the relevant code:\nget every action of list 1 of scroll area 1 of scroll area 1 of browser 1 of splitter group 1 of group 2 of sheet 1 of window \"untitled\"\n\nThis is the entire code:\non run \n\n    tell application \"Subler\" to activate\n    delay 1\n\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        delay 0.5\n        keystroke return\n        delay 1\n        keystroke \"s\" using command down\n    end tell\n\n    activate application \"Subler\"\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        tell process \"Subler\"\n            get every action of list 1 of scroll area 1 of scroll area 1 of browser 1 of splitter group 1 of group 2 of sheet 1 of window \"untitled\"\n        end tell\n\n    end tell\n\n    tell application \"Subler\" to activate\n    delay 1\n\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n    end tell\n\n    return input\nend run\n\n\nA: It's been a while since I played with Applescript, but I think it's just 'window 1' [without quotes] for the frontmost window.\n", "Q: eMac stuck - won't boot, won't eject disc I was upgrading from Jaguar 10.2.4 to Tiger 10.4.8 on my creaky old eMac. \nInserted the Install disk.

Now back to square one (operating in Panther). Guess my question was why the install aborted or whether I need to do something differently to upgrade, like a system restore of Panther b/4 installing Tiger.\n", "Q: How do I change the answers to the export compliance questions in iTunes Connect? How do i change the answers to the export compliance questions on iTunes Connect once I've entered them?\nI don't know how to get back to that page. How do I get back to that page?\n(I'm trying to publish an app)\n\nA: Either uploading a new binary update or rejecting the App's actual binary and then pressing on Ready to Upload Binary should do the trick.\nAs written under Apple's iTunes Connect Guide:\n\nCryptography and U.S. Export Compliance\nU.S. export laws require that products containing encryption be properly authorized for export. When you’re ready to upload your first binary for your app or upload a binary update, iTunes Connect presents a series of questions regarding software encryption.

How to voice activate an iPhone without touching it? Illinois' law states cell phone use must be hands free. I realize they intend for you to use a hands-free kit. How come when, at least when it rings, I can't tell Siri to answer it onto speaker phone? Why isn't she listening for commands like the star ship Enterprise?\n\nA: At the moment is not possible, but this is one of the features of the upcoming iOS 8:\n\nWith iOS 8, users won't have to have their iPhone or iPad in their hands to invoke Siri. Instead, the device will listen for the voice prompt \"Hey Siri\" to initiate.\n\n\nA: Get an iPhone case that provides backup power.\nYou can maneuver iPhone completely hands-free by saying \"Hey Siri\" if you are willing to keep your phone plugged in to a portable USB battery while you walk around.  \niOS 8 has \"Hey Siri\" built-in:  \n\n\nSettings > General > Siri > \"Hey Siri\" > Enabled\n\n\nThe rub: \"Hey Siri\" only listens when phone is plugged in to power. \nThe fix: Bring a portable USB backup battery and keep your phone plugged in!\nSome protective iPhone cases also have built-in batteries you can use to charge your iPhone when the time comes. I imagine this would be the most convenient way to accomplish what you would like to do without having to carry extra items.\nI asked around the Genius Bar at an Apple Store in Chicago why they suppose such a feature would have such a restriction, and the general consensus suggested was that people in close proximity would likely set off each other's phones. My personal suspicion is that constantly polling in the background might be costly in terms both of battery life as well as network traffic, and most people plug in where WiFi is much more likely to be available.\nI figured Siri would recognize our voices by now! =)\n\nA: iOS 8, out this fall, will have this feature integrated. For now, get an Android and say OK Google to activate Google Now.\nCar companies will roll out the Apple CarPlay technology soon on their entertainment systems, which has built-in Siri integration for hands-free commands.\n", "Q: Get notified on new App Reviews?

Sleep mode works, luckily, but sometimes I need to reboot.\nIn April my HDD started to fail. I have noticed general slowness and the drive finally failed,  I decided to install a SSD, and I choose a Samsung 840 EVO 500GB, which seemed to have good reviews.\nThe installation went fine and the drive worked perfectly, but since then, from time to time, but lately almost every time, I cannot reboot the machine. It stays stuck in the Apple logo with the spinner under it.\nAt this point I can access the recovery partition, the Apple Hardware Test, the single user command line mode. I tried once to boot from the Time Machine drive, but either it was very slow (and I was very impatient) or it didn’t work.\nFollowing this http://support.apple.com/kb/ts2570 the Safe Mode (Shift) doesn’t work (it does the progress bar until one third, then the spinning wheel forever). Verbose Safe Mode (Shift+Cmd+V) shows the output until just mounting the hard drive (or just before mounting). Single user mode (Cmd+S) gives me a prompt, I can do fsck (no problems), I can mount the drive, I can modify files, but as soon as I type exit it just get stuck again.\nThe first time this happen I think I remember being able to reboot by doing a NVRAM reset, but that doesn’t work anymore. Another time it happened, I opened the laptop again and removed and re-attached the SDD, which seemed to work, but again, that doesn’t work anymore. The only thing that works is reinstalling from the Recovery partition (which is 30 minutes of downloading and 40 minutes of reinstalling).\nI found this thread on Apple forums https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5413626 which describes a similar situation to mine. It seems that even if the controller claims SATA 6Gbps, the cable might not be fully prepared for it. It also seems that there was a EFI update to fix some problems with SATA drives (http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1450), which I must have installed back then.\nObviously changing the cable seems like an option, but I would like to know if someone knows a way to force the driver/EFI/whatever to force a slower link speed negotiation. Currently I have 6Gbps, but I will like to see if I can boot with a capped 3Gbps.\nFrom other posts I have found people wanting to increase the speed, but I want just the opposite. Maybe it will fix my problem, and I can live with a lower speed.\nMore information from the System Profile:\nModel name: MacBook Pro\nModel identifier:   MacBookPro8,2\nBoot ROM version:   MBP81.0047.B27\nSMC version:    1.69f4\n\nIntel 6 Series Chipset:\n  Manufacturer: Intel\n  Product:  6 Series Chipset\n  Link speed:   6 gigabits\n  Negotiated link speed:    6 gigabits\n  Physical connection:  SATA\n  Description:  AHCI Version 1.30 Supported\n\n\nA: Have you tried to change the SATA cable?\nAlso have a look to the kernel logs inside the /var/log/system.log with the command:\ngrep kern /var/log/system.log -a2\n\n", "Q: DiskAid is not recognising my IPOD I installed DiskAid and its not recognising my iPod Shuffle (it's showing message \"Please connect your device\" when I have already plugged in my iPod).

I've tried with both external hard drives for data and using the internal drives. The drives pass all tests I have including S.M.A.R.T monitoring.\nTo be clear, if local home folders are used, the problem does not occur. If the networked user is logged in on the server, the problem does not occur. The problem only seems to occur when the user's home directory is served over either SMB of AFP. If I use a local (or Guest) user on the workstation to view a vCard on a networked drive, it seems to work fine.\nBecause of this, I'm leaning towards something with binding, kerberos or OD. Something where the default configurations are not satisfactory.\nI'm at a loss of what to try next. I've Googled extensively and have not been able to find a solution, or even evidence that other people are experiencing this issue. I find this odd.\nHas anyone seen this issue and have you resolved it?\nThanks.\n\nA: I broke down and called Apple Care tonight and got quickly directed over to the Server team. Shocking to me, but the tech was able to reproduce my issue! This surprised me because no one in the Apple Discussion groups (or really elsewhere) has mentioned the problem. So the tech is elevating the issue and hopefully we'll see a bug fix soon. I haven't tested Yosemite, but may try to do that next week.\nFor those who are concerned they could see this problem with their network, there is a way to bypass quicklook's processing of vCards on the workstation. I found an obscure mention of similar and perhaps related issue (https://www.biostars.org/p/67388/) which includes a workaround that disables quicklook generator for contacts and the importer. \nAs root:\ncd /System/Library/QuickLook/ ; mv Contact.qlgenerator Contact.qlgenerator.BAD\ncd /System/Library/Spotlight/ ; mv vCard.mdimporter vCard.mdimporter.BAD\n\nHTH someone in the future.\nEdit: The same behavior exists in Yosemite. I have not tested the workaround as I opted to move home directories to individual workstations. I was experiencing too many problems. However, as Contact.qlgenerator and vCard.mdimporter are present in Yosemite, I suspect the workaround still works.\n\nA: I would like to thank iLikeStrongJava for posting this issue and suggested solution. We too have been having this problem with both Mavericks and Yosemite. With regards to not seeing this issue posted in the Apple Discussion forums I think the reason for that is that there are so many overlapping network home directory problems that it is often hard to narrow down an issue like this to a specific version.\nWe have started testing this workaround under Yosemite and so far it does still seem both needed and to still work.\nI believe there are the following network home directory problems -\n\n\n*\n\n*A fresh network home directory login can result in the users entire network home directory being Spotlight re-indexed from scratch, if the user has lots of emails, this can take several hours to complete and during the process searches either will be impossible or at best produce incomplete results not to mention slow down the entire client, this seems partially improved in Yosemite compared to Mavericks.\n\n*The infamous and still unfixed Keychain issues, sometimes resolvable by rebooting\n\n*The corruption of various databases e.g. Contacts, and users Keychain (see 2. above)\n\n*When a user logs out of a network home directory account numerous processes remain running under that account, this again can cause problems when the user next logs in\n\n*When a user logs out the users network home directory can remain mounted, this again can cause problems when the user next logs in, or even a different user on the same client Mac\n\n\nSome of these (other) issues can be mitigated by using a logout-hook see https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7297337#29176911\nWith regards to the suggested fix by iLikeStrongJava and El Capitan. I suspect that SIP in El Capitan may prevent this being done. This presumes the issue still occurs in El Capitan but based on Apple's failure previously to fix these issues this may well still affect El Capitan.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro Retina 2014 - Quick return from Sleep - Black screen with cursor before login window I just got a MBPr. When the display switches off, like its going to sleep and I quickly hit a key to wake it back up. It shows a black screen with a cursor for about 15-20 seconds before the login screen appears. Its only if I do it instantly after the screen switches off. If I leave it off for sometime it comes back instantly... \nIts not a problem when I don't log back in and let the screen go black from the login prompt. \nI also tried to totally disable the show login screen after screensaver/sleep option and it still take a while to go from black to my desktop. \nThis is a problem if I have an external display plugged in or no displays attached. Its really annoying because I want to stop it from sleeping because I'm reading or something. \nIs this normal? How can I troubleshoot? \n\nA: It turns out in this case the cause is Spotify. It seems to be a bug with the Spotify app. Yet no bug fix has been released. If you have spotify running, kill it and see if you get this issue still. \nIf you dont use Spotify go through a process of elimination. Start by killing everything running (processes/background/tray tasks) then make the laptop it sleeps and comes back.\nThen start processes/background/tray tasks up one by one and let the computer sleep (change it to 1 minute or something to test) then see if it comes back ok. Keep going until it doesn't thats the process at fault. \n", "Q: Something's eating my disc space - Mac OS X So something's swallowing about 800gb of disk space on my mac. \nI've ran Disk Inventory X and Omni Sweeper, and both show that my main OS drive only houses 30 GB worth of data. 10GB of that is Home folders from the network share, and the rest I'm guessing is OS based guff.\nBut where the hell is the other 200 or so?! \nAny ideas?\nThanks.\n\nA: The biggest issue here is that you need to run your analysis tools as root. If you don't do this, you'll only see the files that your account has access to, and so you won't see everything that is taking up space.\nI like GrandPerspective personally. If it's in your Applications folder, the command to run it as root looks like this:\nsudo /Applications/GrandPerspective.app/Contents/MacOS/GrandPerspective\n\n\nA: I'd suggest an application called DaisyDisk, it lets you drill down to each folder level to determine which directory is taking up all of the space.  A lot of times, it's either ./MobileBackups or /private/var/vm.  The former is where Time Machine stores local, offline cached backups, and /private/var/vm is where sleepimage files are kept.  Those typically size up to 1.5x the amount of installed system RAM.  The purpose of sleepimage files is to store all of your open data to disk when you put your computer to sleep.\nThere are a variety of methods to disable both.\nDisable /.MobileBackups:\nsudo tmutil disablelocal Disable /.MobileBackups  \ntouch /.MobileBackups   \nsudo chflags uchg /.MobileBackups \n\nDisable sleepimage files: \nsudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0  \nrm -rf /private/var/vm/*  \nsudo chflags uchg /private/var/vm\n\nLink to DaisyDisk (be sure to run your scan as an administrator)\n\nA: That is hard to answer without taking the time to do more analysis.\nSome things to try:\n1) Reboot the computer and see if some of the used space is cleared up. This may occur if the /tmp folder is large.\n2) From an administrator account, open Terminal.app and use the du command (display disk usage information). I find du gives me more control than graphical disk analyzing tools, which are often limited by the authorities granted to the user running the application. I start by issuing:\nsudo du -sh /Users\n\nThis will summarize the space used for user files.\nThen move to different directories on the drive. \nCheck out the man du page for more options. \n", "Q: Time Machine and storage questions In researching Time Machine usage issues, I have come across other questions that might change the way I have always arranged my drives.\nBack in the 'olden days' when internal drives were smaller--say 10 GB--I would attach an external drive for most of my storage. (Keep in mind that my Mac use goes back to my treasured 128K Mac with no hard drive and has evolved since then.) My current iMac had a 750 GB internal drive which died and is being replaced with a 1 TB drive. I also have a 1 TB external drive.\nBeing a creature of habit I have retained my time honored practice of using my internal drive for the OS (currently 10.9) and it's associated files, my applications and whatever files the Mac wants to store there. ALL of my stored files are on the external drive. I am a fairly light user so the above arrangement results in about a 5% or less usage of each drive.\nDue to the recent 'death' of my internal drive I am now planning on using TM to back up my data and have been told to use a dedicated drive for that purpose. My plan was to get another external drive for that purpose. But, I am seeking opinions to see if I should re-think my disk usage in light of current disk capacities. Given the vast amount of empty space on both my current drives (as I said probably 90% or more) should I consolidate my internal and external drives on the internal drive and format the external drive for TM? It seems to me that I have an insane amount of free disk space so that buying a second external drive to be a waste of money-at least at this time. Of course I can always purchase another drive later if my needs point in that direction.\n\nA: Putting everything on the internal drive and using the external drive for Tim Machine will provide you with two copies of all of your data.  That way if either drive dies, you will not lose much data. \nAlso, a best practice for Time Machine is to keep the drive connected and mounted at all times. This way a backup will be done every hour and will always be current.\nMy recommendation would be to consolidate everything on the internal drive and use an external drive for a time machine backup. You will probably be OK for quite a while, unless you start acquiring lots of music, movies, or TV shows. I believe that Apple recommends that the Time Machine drive be at least 1.5-2 times the size of the drives it is backing up. This may not be necessary in your case, your external 1TB drive should work fine. The OS will alert you when it has to start deleting older backups because the disk is getting too full.\n\nA: Short answer: Yes, you should. If your disk space needs are so small, it makes no sense to split them between two disks. By using the same disks, you will be able to store everything twice, so if any drive dies, all your data is on the second drive.\nI found it helpful to also backup applications, since sometimes updates remove functionality, and then it is helpful to reverse the update. If you have the space, update all files, including applications.\nIf you keep your current arrangement and add a dedicated TM drive, you get the same level of redundancy for 50% more cost. If you have the disk space already, it would make more sense to use the third disk for another level of redundancy.\nIf you are really concerned about data loss, you can write your TM archive to a device with two internal hard disks which both hold all of your data. This arrangement is called a RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks), and the possible level of redundancy is limited by your budget.\n", "Q: Is there the way to resolve RAM problems? I have Macbook Pro 13\" Late 2011. It has 4GB RAM, i bought 2x8GB Corsair, CMSO8GX3M1A1333C9. It works cool in 98% of time, but when i play games or use very heavy apps like Photoshop, i always get crashes and reboots. I try to use only one slot with 8GB in there – the same problem. On 4GB (2x2GB) no crashes or reboots but it's mush more slower... \nThe questions are:\n– how to resolve that problems?\n– may it be that my Mac can't use more than 4GB in one slot?\n– what memory will make work with my Mac stable? \nBest regards,\nSergey\n\nA: Did you buy the RAM from a provider that guarantees it for Macintosh systems? I've gotten RAM from a big box store that has met the exact specifications, but wouldn't work in my Mac Book Pro without crashing all of the time. I ended up returning that RAM and getting it for about the same price from a vendor that guarantees it will work in my specific system.\nApple specs say that this machine is capable of a maximum of 8GB of ram, but third parties have found, that with the right modules, 16GB works fine.\nI'd recommend returning your current RAM modules and getting new ones from a Mac specialist. I don't think that the modules you have will ever work with your hardware.\n\nA: I would test the RAM to make sure it isn't faulty. There are various applications to let you test your RAM. Memtest is a free one you can download here.\nJust run the installer, then open a Terminal and type \"memtest all\" to run the test. It will run the test multiple times and might take an hour or two to run completely, but it will tell you if it finds any errors.\nMore information here: http://www.command-tab.com/2008/01/11/how-to-test-ram-under-mac-os-x/\n", "Q: License Keys not Transferred in Time Machine Restore I have just restored a Time Machine backup to a new disk, and I am finding that I need to re-enter scores of licenses for specific applications (while others seem to be retained without issue). Specifically, I am using RapidWeaver, and most of the Stacks require license keys. They must be stored somewhere, but I have yet to be able to determine the location. I would like to restore that directory from a backup to avoid countless hours of data re-entry. \nCan someone point out where this information is stored? It doesn't have to be specific to RapidWeaver, even though that would be helpful. I just want to know where to look to be able to restore my previous keys, in order to save a bit of time.\n\nA: It looks like the files I want are stored in \\~Library\\Preferences under each stack's specific plist file. I don't quite understand why none of them transferred over from the original backup, but I am hopeful they will copy over when I visit the Time Machine backup.\n\nA: There's a built-in list of exclusions stored in /System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/StdExclusions.plist.\nAlso, apps can use a file's metadata to exclude it from backups. You can view this list of files by running the command:\nsudo mdfind \"com_apple_backup_excludeItem = 'com.apple.backupd'\"\nThis works by changing the extended attribute com.apple.metadata:com_apple_backup_excludeItem.\nSource: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/25833/320223\n", "Q: Is there a way to avoid the Featured tab in IOS App Store?

Is there any way to avoid this annoying behavior?\niPhone 5 \"classic\", IOS 7.1.2.\n\nA: This is not possible (at least not currently). When the iOS App Store is opened, it will either open up the default page, which is the Featured tab, or the last viewed page, if it was previously recently opened.\nPerhaps you can suggest that the Updates tab should become the default tab if there are any pending updates, on Apple's iPhone feedback page. However, I know that people sometimes choose not to update apps for whatever reason, so constantly being brought to the updates page might offend them...\n", "Q: Being asked for credit card information for updates on apps already purchased I have purchsed the apps & most I have are free but I'm being asked for credit card information for apps that are being updated.

If there is missing address information you will be prompted for it. If you haven't agreed to the latest Terms and Conditions you will be prompted to agree. If you have credit card information on your account Apple will try to validate it.

Either of the 4GB sticks works with either of the stock 2GB sticks but both the 4GB sticks do not work. It causes kernel panics. Firmware is already at the latest version (MBP81.0047.B27). I am well aware of fitment process. Officially it can support 8 gb max.\n\nA: Macs are quite a bit more tolerant of what RAM they can take and handle well. If RAM can be upgraded at all. A 2011 MBP has a wide range of options. Using Apple approved RAM modules (at a small premium)  with the same specs as a non-approved module of the same brand usually only gets you small advantages: they pass the hardware test at the Genius bar without issues and are practically guaranteed to work in a Mac. But that doesn't mean the non-approved modules do not work.\nIt is true that the module has to meet certain specs. But as long as it is DDR3 SO-DIMM with the correct voltage and not too slow the MBP 8,2 from 2011 should be able to handle it.\nThat means two  DDR3-1600 sticks each at 8GB is way out of Apple's official spec. Yet the machine works fine with them. The 1333 option is playing it safe and slower. Apple's advice: is doing just that. It doesn't even matter whther they are DDR3 or DDR-3L since the L variant is rated at 1,35V but required by spec to also run at 1,5V like the MBP 2011 wants it to. But choosing the L variant doesn't give you any energy savings in this case. To summarise: the machine in question can run at least up to 16GB RAM with 1,5V at at least up to 16000MHz just fine.\nAnd the OP already confirmed that the sticks are working in some configurations but not in others.\nConcerning the OP question there seems to be a hardware fault: It might be the logic board (more specific the ram slots being even pickier). Or it might be that the two 4GB sticks have issues. \"Mismatched\" modules it says in the title. Absent the knowledge of how this old problem went forth the advice had to be: \nMost likely at least one of the 4GB modules is somehow flawed. To hunt it down and exclude other possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*reseat the modules: test one module at a time; then both, swapping modules from slot to slot (this not only should pin down any problems with the individual modules but also might clean the slots a bit. Cleaning the slots per se might be an option as well.)\n\n*stress test the modules separately at first, then together in the combinations noted above\n\n*get the logic board tested, RAM slot failure is not that uncommon\n\n*buy modules of the the capacity, same specs both at the same time together (this is belt+suspenders advice; mixing modules should work – and did as the OP demonstrated)\n\n\nA: Macs are notoriously picky about memory. The specs of your memory must match exactly what the Mac is expecting.\nYour Mac is expecting:\nDDR3 PC3-10600 • CL=9 • Unbuffered • NON-ECC • DDR3-1333 • 1.35V\nIf yours is not exactly this, you will have problems. \nI believe your Macbook can take up to 16GB, so 8GB should be fine. \n", "Q: What's the best OSX for my 2007 3.1 MacBook 2.2Ghz Intel Core 2 Dual, 1GB RAM, currently using OS X 10.5.8? My ol' clunker is doing very well considering its age, but I would like to upgrade its OSX to see if it runs a bit faster, and also because I can't run the latest versions of some applications on OS X 10.5.8..\nI'm just hesitant because I'm afraid to make the computer even slower with a newer version of OSX, even if Apple says that I can run newer OSX... Does anyone have any advice? Much appreciated!\n\nA: According to EveryMac the latest OS that your Macbook can run is 10.7.5 (Lion).\nA big focus on the preceding release 10.6 (Snow Leopard) was performance. It was the OS update that Apple advertised as having \"no new features\" as the work was focused on refining and improved the existing ones. Reducing the memory footprint, removing legacy code, the Finder was rewritten in Cocoa, a new Cocoa version of Quicktime was created, etc. In John Siracusa's review of Snow Leopard for Ars Technica he said \"Should you buy Mac OS X Snow Leopard? If you're already running Leopard, then the answer is a resounding 'yes.'\"\nSo I'd definitely recommend upgrading to Snow Leopard at least.\n\nA: 2GB of memory cannot handle system osx after snow leopard without slowing down the computer to a crawl whatever task is supposed to happen.\nThat is based on personal experience.\nIf you think about it if 2GB of memory are supposed to manage 256 GB of applications and data, process and multitask something will have to give.\n\nA: There are great answers with many takes on experience, but I would say, the correct answer is you can do the upgrade in a non-destructive way. I blogged a bit of this on the site blog:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://apple.blogoverflow.com/2015/09/back-up-then-step-up-to-el-capitan/\nI would recommend getting an external drive that's as fast an interface as you can (perhaps a FireWire 800 desktop drive) and installing the system there. You could then know that you can always shut down and go back to the OS on the internal drive if the external drive runs slower than you had hoped. An external drive will always be a \"little\" slower than the internal, so you might not get a full experience of the speed you would get by upgrading the internal drive, but this lets you spend a little time making sure your apps run well - no matter the speed and then you can make some \"speed\" measurements to decide if you are making a step up, a step down or just a sideways step, but newer options and more recent security fixes.\n\nA: I think the best OSX for your Mac is the 10.5.8.\n", "Q: Apple 4s Using Tracfone BYOP I am looking into buying a used Apple 4s to use as a Tracfone through Tracfone BYOP. I want to be sure that I know my facts before investing money into this venture. Please let me know if I'm missing something or have the wrong info.\nTracfone BYOP Requirements:\nUsed Apple iPhone 4 or 4s/\nVerizon Carrier/\nClean ESN/\nUNLOCKED/\nMust Have Verizon SIM Card/\nMust be CDMA\nQuestion ~~ Does the iPhone HAVE To Have A SIM Card?\nANY Help Will Certainly Be Appreciated! Thank-You!\n\nA: I have just activated (Nov 20, 2014) an iPhone 4s that had been on the Verizon System.  It had to be unlocked for international use.  It had to be active on the Verizon System to do the unlocking.  The previous owner of the phone kept the sim card so it does NOT have a sim card installed.  It functions 100% as a Tracfone.\n\nA: That's right, Verizon phones don't use SIM cards. The iPhone 4s (and I think the 4) does have a SIM slot because it can be used on either CDMA or GSM, but you don't use that for Tracfone's BYOP. The phone does need to have been previously on Verizon, and be unlocked. \nI've done this twice with a used 4s each time, buying one from eBay & one from Amazon. It costs $10 to register each phone with Tracfone. On eBay I get 200 minute cards for $32 that triple to 600 voice minutes, 600 texts, and 600 MB of data for 90 days. It's great for moderate use, especially if you're on wi-fi a lot and you use Apple's iMessage feature for some of your texting. I also use YouMail for voice mail, which avoids Tracfone's clumsy voice mail that charges you for both your calls to listen AND your callers' time leaving messages.\nThere's a lot of useful information in the comments here, including links to even cheaper airtime:\nhttp://www.prepaidphoneguy.com/tracfone-iphone-arrives\nI think it's wise to the extra $$ to get the iPhone 4s over the 4, for its extra speed and capabilities. Ours run iOS 7 pretty well (although I haven't spoiled myself by trying a 5s).\n", "Q: NetRestore image fails to install, no reason given I've got a Mac Mini running the latest version of OS X Server, and two iMacs. Both iMacs are the same model (Mid 2007 20-inch, 2 Ghz Core 2 Duo). On one of the Macs I have installed 10.9.4 and installed all of our software, and I used it to make the NetRestore image on the server. I've tried the image on other (newer) Macs around and it seems to work fine, but when I try to run it on this second iMac (which is identical to the original iMac that I made the image from), it fails. Does anyone have any ideas about what might be going on or how to go about fixing it?\n\n\nA: I ran into the same issue, and finally figured out the trouble is related to the CoreStorage partition type that is shipping with Yosemite.\nTo solve the NetRestore issue, first boot into a recovery mode (either the built-in recovery drive, an external USB drive, or net recovery).\nOpen up Terminal, and run these two commands:\ndiskutil cs list\ndiskutil cs revert A-Long-string-of-hex-values\n\nThe first command will print a tree view of the CoreStorage drive.  Of note, you should see a few long UUID strings.  Likely there would be one for \"Physical Volume\", \"Logical Volume Family\", and \"Logical Volume\".  It is the string after the last one (\"Logical Volume\" which you should copy and paste as A-Long-string-of-hex-values in the second command.\nSee http://awesometoast.com/yosemite-core-storage-and-partition-woes/ and The OS X Man Page for diskutil for a bit more info.  (Note that some sources may use \"coreStorage\" in place of \"cs\" in the above commands.  According to the man page, the two are equivalent)\n\nA: George,\nWe had a similar issue while building images for our various Elementary Schools that cropped up this year. Some images would work and some wouldn't. We first thought it had something to do with the various model computers we were using to create the images, i.e. building the image on a MBA 2013 and trying to apply to a 2012 MBA model, but that ended up being a dead end.\nJust yesterday I made a discovery and I'm not sure if it will work in your situation but maybe it is worth looking into. We noticed that when we took a computer that had a 120GB SSD and created a 10.9.4 image and then tried applying that image to a similar model MBA computer which the only difference was a 60GB SSD vs. the 120GB SSD the NetRestore would fail w/o any log errors. Once we moved that original image over to 60GB SSD drive using Carbon Copy Cloner and then setup a new saved NetRestore from that computer and tried the same process over the image was successful.\nI know you mentioned in your post that they were similar models, but I'm hoping just maybe this fix will work for you. Good luck! -Ken\n\nA: You need to set the system time  This article should help...\nWhen you’re booting your Mac from the recovery partition and are planning to reinstall OS X, you might be met by the following message:\nAn error occurred while preparing the installation. Try running again\nNow, if you haven’t used your Mac for a while, the error might be caused by an incorrect system date setting. You can check this by going to utilities and opening the terminal. Once in the terminal enter the following command and hit return/enter:\ndate\nThe result of this command will be the date that the system currently has been set to. For some reason, it might have been reset to 2001, in which case we need to set it to the right date. To do this, we enter a new command. This command will be entered as follows:\ndate {month}{day}{hour}{minute}{year}\nEvery bracket should be replaced with a two-digit number. For example, March 18th 2013 12:50 would become the following command:\ndate 0318125013\nEnter the command and hit return. You can then check if it was set correctly by running the first command again. If the date was wrong, it was likely that which caused the error, and after you quit the terminal it should be able to install OS X just fine.\n", "Q: 2008 MacBook Air connected to a 2011 iMac from DVI to Thunderbolt? I have an original 13\" MacBook Air from early 2008 with a micro-DVI interface and a 2011 27\" iMac that I would like to use as a monitor for the MacBook Air.\nA cable that converts the micro-DVI to a DVI connection came with the MacBook but of course there is only a Thunderbolt display on the iMac and I would like to know if there is (officially or un-officially) a cable that will go from DVI to Thunderbolt so I can work on my MacBook Air and see what I am doing on my iMac please?\n\nA: You should search for a DVI to Mini-Display port, as Mini-Display cables are compatible with Thunderbolt ports. A quick google search turned up this  from the apple store. Be aware that this is a DVI-D adapter, which means it only outputs digital signals. \n", "Q: Sort selected columns by row In Numbers, how is it possible to sort selected columns by a row?\nIn the following example I want to sort the columns B, C and D by using the values in row 1.\n\nSo far, I have only found the reverse action (which does what it is supposed to) \"sort selected rows by column\".\n\nA: Transpose the sheet (Table->Transpose rows and columns), sort, and then transpose back. However you may lose some of the formatting, like column widths and row heights.\n", "Q: Whats the best way to automatically start an app if its not running? I want to automatically start an application if its not running.   My use is case that if I quit a particular application I want to automatically restart.  Specifically in my case its the Messages app.\nI always want to keep the Messages app running so if I quit Messages I want it to restart. \nWhat's the best way to handle this? \n\nA: What you are looking for is launchd. \nIt will allow you to run an app continuously (auto-start at boot, relaunch when it quits/crash)\nTo use it add a plist file in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n        <key>RunAtLoad</key>  \n        <true/>\n        <key>KeepAlive</key>\n        <true/>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>SomeApp.restart</string>\n        <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n        <array>\n                <string>/path/to/SomeApp.app/Contents/MacOS/SomeApp</string>\n        </array>\n        <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>\n        <dict>\n            <key>Hour</key>\n            <integer>5</integer>\n            <key>Minute</key>\n            <integer>10</integer>\n       </dict>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThen load it once with  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/SomeApp.restart.plist\n\n\n*\n\n*The RunAtLoad option will launch the application the first time launchctl runs this.\n\n*The KeepAlive option will re-launch the application if it crashes.\n\n*The StartCalendarInterval will run it at a certain time. Presumably this is mutually exclusive with the previous two, but is included to show what can be done with launchd\nLaunchctl will run this after reboots.\n\n\nA: As mentioned, launchctl is the command you want. I find that the syntax for launchctl to be rather difficult compared to crontab. Of course, launchctl does much more than cron. Thus, I use Lingon to provide a GUI to manage launchctl.\n", "Q: In Applescript, how do I launch Safari \"Silently\" open url then close the unseen Safari window I am new to Applescript and MACs although my first computer was an Apple II Plus and I programed in Apple Basic and Assembly.\nI am using it to create a \"Silent\" alarm button.\nWe have a system in place that via a URL call will send a message to a select group of computers, in this case the ones used by our security officers.\nI wrote a similar one for PCs using the AutoIT scripting language. When some one clicks on this program, as far as anyone watching the screen is concerned, nothing happens. It is 100% silent. But unseen by anyone looking at the PC screen, IE was launched minimized and hidden, a custom URL string, with an embedded message, is opened and then IE is closed. The security officers computers get a message from the message system, Informacast, and  security responds accordingly. At no time is anyone watching the PC screen aware that anything has happened. It is all \"Silent\". Just like a silent alarm in a bank.\nMy MAC version, written in Applescript is working well except that the call to Safari can be seen on the screen when it takes place. It is only there for a few seconds as the URL is loaded, and then the Safari window is closed, but that few seconds is a few seconds to much and anyone watching the screen will know something happened when the alarm was pressed. I need to prevent anything from showing when Safari is launched. I need to make it \"Silent\".\nThe part of the script that opens Safari and loads the URL is shown below...\ntell application \"Safari\"\nlaunch\nopen location AlertURLString (This is the variable that has the URL and embedded message in it)\ndelay 1\nclose window 1\nend tell\n\nI have tried placing the following line in \"Tell\" routine in various places, before \"launch\" after \"launch\" before \"open location\" and after etc., but I still see a blip of the Safari window as it loads the URL string.\nset miniaturized of window 1 to true\n\nI also played around with variations of the following line but got an Applescript error every time.\ntell application \"System Events\" to set process \"Safari\" to false\n\nOne more thing, it is possible that Safari or some other program could be open, maybe not full screen etc when this script is run and it is important that it not be closed or changed in any way that would clue some one in to the fact that something was happening on the system after the \"Alert Button\" is pressed. The \"set miniaturized\" line depending on how it was used would minimize the window which of course we don't want.\nAgain what I need is to be able to launch the URL 10000% silently.\nThanks in advance to all who are able to try and help,\nRalph\n\nA: You won't be able to do it in AppleScript : Safari only does something on open windows. \nYou should definitely look at Command line scripts like curl. \nThe AppleScript to call a shell command takes the form:\nset variableName to do shell script \"command\"\n\nSo using your AlertURLString you'd want something like:\nset curlOutput to do shell script \"curl '\" & AlertURLString & \"'\"\n\nSee the curl man page for more details on how to use curl to do things like POST and PUT calls or attach payloads to the calls and what not. It is incredibly powerful.\n\nA: if you look at the curl manpage (man curl) it doesn't seem to have a limit on url size.

I was using Terminal just now and realized that I was seeing something different on the screen than I have in the past.

It's presented to you when you open a shell in a Terminal window and it can be customized. Some people like their prompts to show lots of information like the hostname their currently logged in to, the user they're running as, the current directory they're, etc. For example, I like:\n/Users/ian/code/packer-config |ruby-2.1.1@vanilla| [git::master]\n>\n\nThat's a two-line prompt that shows me the directory, the version of Ruby loaded by RVM and the gem bundle as well as the git branch I'm working on and the clean/dirty state of the local repository.\nThe prompt is completely customizable via PS1 environment variable in bash (the default shell in OS X). Out of the box, OS X has PS1 set to:\nPS1=\"\\h:\\W \\u\\$\"\n\nThis says: \"display the host name, followed by a colon, then the current working directory followed by a space and then the name of the user and the default prompt character.\"\nFor a standard user this evaluates to something like:\n> bash\nbash-3.2$ PS1=\"\\h:\\W \\u\\$\"\nianchesalsimac:~ ian$\n\nAs you can see, my prompt looks an awful lot like your prompt when I use bash (I use zsh by default in my environment so I had to switch to bash to show this to you).\nThat is to say, in a very long winded way: your prompt looks exactly like the default OS X bash prompt. Nothing odd about it all.\nThe integrativeasheville part is your machine's host name. the : is just a separator. And the ~ means you're in your home directory -- ~ is shorthand for \"my home directory\" in shell path language.\n", "Q: How to restore a hidden file in Time Machine?

When I enter Time Machine I can see my home directory, but all the dot-files in the directory are hidden in the Finder window displayed by Time Machine.\nHow can I restore a hidden file like ~/.zshrc using Time Machine?\n\nA: Rest assured that Time Machine is backing up your dot-files! You just can't see them by default in Finder. In order to restore a hidden file like .zshrc you first need to turn off file hiding in finder.

My mom has an iPad Air with a T-Mobile data plan.  The iPad Air is configured to use the Wi-Fi in her home.\nShe recently noticed some pop-up messages on the iPad Air saying that there's no data left on the cellular plan.  She gets 200 MB of data every month from T-Mobile, so I guess she used up all 200 MB this month.  But she never takes the iPad outside the house, so she doesn't know how she ran out of cellular data.  The only thing I can think of is that maybe the Wi-Fi was down and the iPad Air automatically switched to the T-Mobile cellular signal.  She watches movies a lot, so that would certainly use up 200 MB of data pretty quickly.\nSo does the iPad Air automatically switch to the cellular plan if the Wi-Fi is down?  What if the Wi-Fi router is up but the Comcast internet is down?\n\nA: It works the other way around but the result is the same. \nBy default it uses the cellular network unless there is a Wifi network. If there is a Wifi  network I will use it to send and receive data. \n\nA: If you want the iPad to use cellular data only on specific occasions, not automatically, you can turn off cellular data in Settings -> Cellular -> Cellular data and switch it on only when needed. This way if the WiFi is down, the iPad will be cut off from the internet and you'll have to manually allow it to use the cellular plan.\n(I'm not 100% certain about the settings screen, I don't have my iPad with me but that's where it is on my iPhone.)\n", "Q: Mount smb share as local directory I want to use GIT and directory should be on a network drive (mounted with smb://). Because the software I'm using only supports the file:// protocol I need some kind of mapping the network share as a local drive on Mac OS X 10.9. How can that be managed?\n\nA: You need to understand how mounting works. In short what you want is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount your smb:// drive on a certain location.\n\n*Use your file:// command as you always do.\n\n\nWhen you use 'Connect to Server' - ⌘K, your drive should be mounted somewhere in /Volumes/. So now you can use file://Volumes/drive-name.\nFor normal use, like this, a mounted network filesystems can be treated just like a 'local' file system.

Is it DNS-server? \nI fI try to change address of DNS-server, than it gets cut to 192.168.1.15.\nHow do I need to set up my Mac to allow the router to fetch the new firmware via tftp?\n\nA: 192.168.1.15/24 is a so-called slash notation, which specifies both the IP address and the network mask at the same time. It's an alternative but shorter notation, which says: your Mac's IP address should be set to 192.168.1.15 and the network mask to 255.255.255.0. \nIn addition to that, you will need to enable the tftp server on your Mac. To do that, look for /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/tftp.plist file. If you find it, you need to edit it, to enable launching the tftp server. Edit the file with your favourite editor (sudo vi or sudo nano should do - this is all best done in the Terminal.app). Inside the file, you'll find the following lines: \n<dict>\n    <key>Disabled</key>\n    <true/>\n\nchange these to be: \n<dict>\n    <key>Disabled</key>\n    <false/>\n\nAfter you make that change, you'll need to run the following command in Terminal.app, to start the tftp service: \nsudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/tftp.plist\nYou will then need to put your firmware file into /private/tftpboot, make sure it's world readable (in Terminal.app run chmod 644 /private/tftpboot/filename where filename is the name of the file containing your firmware) and finally point your router to the location of the file, according to your router's instructions. \n\nA: In order to do this you need your Mac to be connected, by an Ethernet cable, to the router.\nIn the Network control panel of System Preferences, set the following parameters for your Ethernet connection:\nConfigure Ipv4: Manually\nIP Address: 192.168.1.15\nSubnet Mask: 255.255.255.0\nRouter: 192.168.1.1\nPress the \"Apply\" button in the control panel.\nNow you can run tftp from the OS X Terminal app and follow the instructions on the page you referenced.\n", "Q: iOS device battery life when developing I have an iPhone and an iPad that are constantly connected through USB to my MacBook Pro 8 hours a day.\nThe battery of both device is always at 100%. Will this hurt my devices battery life?\nI've researched into alternatives to build and debug from XCode via WIFI or Bluetooth but I find out that those features were dropped by Apple due to stability issues.\nAre there other alternatives?\n\nA: I don't think it will hurt your iPhone. The charger is smart enough to stop charging when necessary. It is the number of charge/use cycles that degrade battery life and if you are attached most of the time its doing neither.\nI have had mine attached to a cable most of the time for over a year and not seen any degradation.\n\nA: But it will affect your battey during long run. I suggest to use your phone as you reach home and let it discharge till 40 %. And then charge again. This will manager maintain battery cycles and its health will be fine this way.\n", "Q: Mavericks Finder No Coverflow I just upgraded to Mavericks (late I know), and I'm not much liking the new Finder sorting system. I had it arranged by modified, for workflow reasons, but I liked the grid too, not the coverflow rows that happen now.\nIs there a way to have the grid and 'arranged by modified'?\nEDIT\nBy grid I mean the old icon layout, which now only happens with 'arrange by name.'\n\nA: Cannot see why this cannot be done.\nSelect grid :-\n\nthen choose:\n\nAnd you should get something like this:\n\nI you want to get rid of the grouping right click in the finder window \n\nand show View Options\n\nSet arrange to: By name\nSet Sort by to : Date Modified \nWhat you get is this:\n\n", "Q: Why will my Mac only load Google and Facebook? I'm running into this really strange problem on my 2013 iMac at home (running Mavericks): the internet will work for a while, then at some point it will stop being able to load any websites except for Facebook and Google (and Google-owned sites, like Gmail and YouTube). These sites work fine, but attempting to access any other site will get stuck on \"Connecting...\" and eventually time out.\nThis applies to all browsers. It also applies whether I'm connected via ethernet or WiFi.\nAttempting to ping other sites like amazon.com, bing.com, etc. via ping just shows a string of timeouts. nslookup does seem to give back IP addresses, but even plugging these directly into a browser's address bar, I still get nothing.\nSo I guess that means it's not a DNS issue? All the same, I've tried my ISP's default DNS, Google DNS, and OpenDNS -- no difference.\nI can confirm the problem is just with my iMac. Other devices on the same network can connect to any website just fine. Furthermore, if I actually start up a Windows VM on the iMac, the VM can also connect to any website!\nRebooting the computer fixes things for a while. But eventually the problem comes back.\nDoes anyone know what the issue might be? I've Googled around a bit, and it does seem that some people have encountered similar issues; but I wasn't able to find any solutions that worked for me.\nEDIT: Maybe this is the same issue as in this question. However, bouncing mDNSResponder as prescribed in the top answer to that question didn't solve the problem for me.\n\nA: In my case the problem was IPv6. Websites like Facebook, Google.com and Youtube use IPv6 and work fine while other's don't support it yet. \nI couldn't figure out the issue exactly (and the right configuration for IPv6) but I disabled IPv6 and the issue was resolved. This is all I care at this point. \nThe commands for El Capitan:\nTurning off IPv6 support for ethernet:\nnetworksetup -setv6off Ethernet\n\nDisabling IPv6 for wireless:\nnetworksetup -setv6off Wi-Fi\n\nIf you ever need to re-enable:\nnetworksetup -setv6automatic Wi-Fi\nnetworksetup -setv6automatic Ethernet\n\nI will edit this if I ever find the correct setting for IPv6 instead of a full disable. \n\nA: This may unique to my case, but I had exactly this problem today. My Macbook Pro (OSX 10.9.4) started to not connect to anything except google and facebook.  No other websites worked.  This happened at home and it happened with both wireless and ethernet connections.  I took the computer into my office thinking it might be my home ISP, but same problem at the office. Then I remembered that yesterday I reinstalled a Cisco VPN client.  As soon as I uninstalled it, everything started to work again - both in my home and office, wifi and ethernet. \n\nA: I've tried all of the above with limited success (sometimes works, sometimes does not).\nThe reason why you are able to load Google and Google-owned sites and bigger players like Facebook is because they use IPv6 and not only IPv4.\nThe issue seems to occur almost every time I wake my Macbook from sleep.\nThe only solution I've found to work instantly and every time is going into Preferences > Networks > Click the lock icon & enter your password > Advanced > TCP/IP > Click \"Renew DHCP lease\". \n\nA: For me, changing the DNS to Google DNS solved the problem. Google DNS is 8.8.8.8 - this worked for me too!\n\nA: To those still having problems similar to this, here are my findings.  Thought I'd post it up as I didn't find a single answer to this problem that worked for me.  \nI'm on a Macbook Air and one specific wifi network I connect to seems to have connection issues to any site other than Google or Facebook.  It would seem that the firewall was the fault with my config.  Blocking Inbound ICMP requests (Stealth Mode in the OS X Firewall settings) seemed to be causing a problem with the automatic Path MTU Discovery.  I thought Auto PMTUD only needed outbound ICMP, but disabling the Inbound filter fixed the issue.  \nYou can also cross verify the problem with PMTUD by manually setting the MTU in your advanced network settings to something lower than the default 1500.  If dropping it down to 1400 or 1300 resolves the problem, you may have something in your network path blocking ICMP requests which PMTUD relies on.  Remove all ICMP blocking on your system firewall and router firewalls to see if that resolves the issue.  Disabling Stealth mode in OS X Sierra worked for me.  Again, I thought PMTUD only needed outbound ICMP, but apparently that's not the case. \n\nA: I tried many things suggested by google using phone data (and spent too much time). Nothing worked. Then unplugged router, let sit, plugged back in. Success! Should always start with turning it off and on again... I have a mac with El Capitan.\n\nA: Go to setting --> network --> revert and it worked !\n", "Q: What is the significance of 1946-02-14 08:34:56? When Finder is operating on a file or folder on the system, the file/folder is greyed out and unable to be opened, as well as unable to be trashed. This is most notable when copying or moving a file or folder using Finder; whilst the operation is in progress the destination file/folder is shown in grey. Finder is aware that the destination file/folder is currently in an operation by setting the creation date of the file or folder to the kMagicBusyCreationDate, which is 08:34:56 on 1946-02-14 (+0000).\nWhat is the significance of this date and time? When I discovered that a date is used for the aforementioned purpose by Finder, I expected it to be something relating to the Unix timestamp/epoch, etc. but nothing seems to be standing out to me as a reason for this date/time being chosen, being far back beyond 1970.\nI have found in Finder.h, the following comment is provided, yet this does not provide the significance of the specific date/time that was selected either:\n\nUse this date as a file's or folder's creation date to indicate that it is temporarily busy (while it is being downloaded or installed, for example). This prevents Finder from trying to change the item's attributes before it is fully created (Finder 8.5 and 8.6 check file creation dates; later Finders may check folder creation dates as well). \n\n\nA: I heard that it was the day ENIAC was revealed to the world:\n\nThe completed machine was announced to the public the evening of February 14, 1946 and formally dedicated the next day at the University of Pennsylvania\n\nThe theory being that there were no \"files\" in existence prior to that date.\nWith regard to the time, 0x4F3AFDB0 (from Finder.h above) mod 86400 (seconds in a day) is 2096. 2096 seconds after midnight is 12:34:56 AM. This is almost certainly the intent: that it reads \"123456\" on the specified day when time zone adjusted.\n", "Q: Stop Image Capture from opening when a new device is connected Ok I get how to disable Image Capture from opening for a specific device, but I'm an iOS developer and I work with a lot of devices. Is there a way to stop this ruddy app from launching the first time I connect any new device? It's a serious invasion of privacy when I connect someone's phone and immediately see their photos plastered on my screen for the world to see!\n\nA: One solution might be to use Cameras from Flexibits.\nInstall this preference pane and set \"When you connect new cameras:\" to \"Do nothing\" and it should stop your Mac from automatically opening Image Capture when you connect a new device.\nNote that Flexibits don't update it anymore, and don't even offer it on their website but in the limited testing I was able to do it does still seem to work. Also since it isn't updated any longer it's a 32-bit preference pane so you'll get that \"To use ... preference pane, System Preferences must quite and reopen.\" when you open it. However you only need to open it once to set the \"When you connect new cameras:\" option.\n\nA: Actually, the best way is:\nOnce Image Capture is open, click the device in the list, then:\nBottom left corner of the application, small triangle. There: switch it to \"no application\".\nDone\n\nA: You have to open iPhoto, go into iPhoto Preferences and next to Connecting camera opens: select No Application.\n\n\n\nA: You can also change the permission and remove any access rights on the application package/folder. I used this on iTunes as well to prevent it from starting when pressing play and not having Spotify open. \nIts as easy as using chmod from Terminal\nsudo chmod 000 /Applications/Image\\ Capture.app\n\nor rightclicking the app, opening the info window, scrolling to the bottom of the view and changing them there.\nMore info on chmod: http://www.chriswrites.com/how-to-change-file-permissions-using-the-terminal/\n\nA: This seems to work in OS X 10.9.5:\ndefaults -currentHost write com.apple.ImageCapture2 HotPlugActionPath ''\n\nNot sure if -currentHost is really needed, or if it would also work without it.\nWhat I had also tried, which seems to work for some but didn't for me:\ndefaults -currentHost write com.apple.ImageCapture disableHotPlug -bool YES\n\nMaybe it depends on the OS version.\n\nA: Yes, deleting the app indeed does work. So it's got that going for it which is nice.\nHowever, I renamed the offending application to \"Image Capture.disabled\" to fix the problem. \n\nA: You could delete Image Capture entirely through the Terminal command\nsudo rm -rf /Applications/Image\\ Capture.app/\n\n", "Q: Removing account from iCal to which I have lost access I have been syncing my iCal with a company email to which I have lost access.

So far it's been 20 mins and it's working. \nNot the most time efficient or technical solution, but I finally have relief! \n\nA: There may have been a better way to do this, but I was able to do it by quickly clicking \"Accounts\" in the Calendar menu in between the moments when the error would pop up.\n", "Q: Mousing over to external display When I have my external monitor hooked up, I access it by mousing off the left hand side of my Macbook display. Can I switch this so that I can access the external by mousing off to the right of My Macbook display? \nThe reason I ask, is my monitor is on the right side of my macbook, and it's unintuitive to mouse left to get to a screen on the right. \n\nA: You can drag the screens into the arrangement you wish in the Displays Control Panel, just click, hold, drag. The screen you are moving will show a red surround on both the panel & the display itself, so you know which is which.\nThe secondary display must, of course, be connected at this time.

So I saw around on the internet that people have changed their HDD to an SSD  on their MacBook Pro which people say helps in speed.\nThis might seem silly to ask here for some of you but I like to get direct answers from someone with better Mac knowledge than me.\nBut if I were to do so, is there a certain type SSD I need and what would be the price? Depending on space. And is it easy?\nI have an Retina MacBook Pro 13\" 8GB RAM, 2,6GHZ, 128HDD (Mid - 2014)\n\nA: Unfortunately I cannot comment on the other answer.  Ian is correct in that the drive inside the new rMBP's are solid-state drives, however, you can upgrade the drive to a larger drive yourself, but in doing so you may void the warranty so make sure that you verify that first, otherwise, you can take it into an Apple Store and they likely will upgrade it for you.  Either way, this will only give you more space and chances are will not increase your read/write speeds.\nHere's the link to the instructions on replacing the SSD.\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Retina+Display+Mid+2014+SSD+Replacement/27849\nYour only obstacle might be finding one.  Currently, the SSD's that Apple uses are made by Samsung and use a PCIe connection.  They are very difficult to find as they are not yet on the mainstream market.\n\nA: The mid-2014 Retina MacBook Pro is not customer serviceable as sold by Apple. The 128 GB drive in the unit is a solid-state, flash-based memory module, as opposed to conventional spinning drives.\n", "Q: Issues with Unicode symbols in some applications running in Terminal.app and iTerm2 Darwin DeoGloria 13.3.0 Darwin Kernel Version 13.3.0: Tue Jun  3 21:27:35 PDT 2014; root:xnu-2422.110.17~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64\n\nFresh user account.

I'm changing iPads soon for school from a old ipad to a new ipad air. I was wondering if I used the same Apple ID, could have save the progress from the games or apps I have in the old ipad and keep them in the new one. I know it saves the game so that you don't have to pay for it again just in care it isn't free. But, let's say I wanna save my Flappy Bird high score. If I get the app on my new ipad air, is there a way I could open the app up without having to start from 0 again. Also, documents in the notability app, is their an easier way to transport them to the new ipad. And music as well? Thank you very much!  \n\nA: Yes. You can transfer all data from your old iPad to your new one with a backup, either with iCloud or iTunes on your computer. There is probably not enough space to backup to iCloud, but if you back up to a computer with iTunes, and then plug your iPad Air into that computer, it will ask if you want to set it up from the backup of your old iPad.\n", "Q: Messages Crashes on Mac Upon Startup Opened messages and the crash reporter immediately opened stating that the program crashed.  In the reporter it stated:\n\nSandbox Creation Failed: You do not have permission to save the file \"Application Support\" to the folder \"Library\".\n\nAfter some research the only possible solution I found involved creating a temporary account to see if its the system or user library and possibly having to delete your current account and creating a new, slightly different account and move your files to that new account.\nMy question was, is there an easier way to fix this without having to go through so much trouble?\n(Hint: There is, or at least it worked for me.  Read on to the answer.)\n\nA: Usually I activate the Guest account and use that to test issues like you're describing.\nIf you try with the Guest account and you're successful, it is an indicator that you've got permission problems with your files.\nUnfortunately, Apple's Disk Utility doesn't fix users' files. I've generally found it is quickest to go into the terminal.app and look for permissions that seem out of the ordinary. For example, Application Support folder on my MBP is rwx------\nYou can view yours by opening Terminal, using cd Library to get into the right folder, then ls -lh to view the folders including Application Support.\nIf those permissions are different, we can show you how to change them.\n\nA: Ok, so this is the solution that worked for me.  No guarantees it'll work for you, but it's worth a shot compared to having to recreate your account.\nFirst off, open Terminal.  You can do this by either typing Terminal in the Spotlight, or going to Applications > Utilities > Terminal.app.  From there a window will open and you will type sudo chmod 755 ~/Library/Application Support (you will have to enter your password), or if you want to make sure you have permissions to everything in your library folder you can type sudo chmod 755 ~Library/* and this will change the permissions of everything in your library folder to rwxr-xr-x (viewed by typing ls -la or -le in the terminal.  If you have other users on your computer, you can substitute 700 in place of 755 and your permissions will be rwx------.\nAs I said, it was an instant fix for me so feel free to give it a try.  It might save you some trouble. \nAdditionally, if this doesn't completely fix the problem, you can also remove the plist file that is associate with the program.  This can be done by going to Library > Preferences and in this case searching for com.apple.iChat.plist and deleting the file or, if you're still in the terminal, type sudo rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iChat.plist\n\nA: I found two different solutions to the crashing Apple Messages problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that McAfee Endpoint Solutions specifies that Messages is allowed under Application Protection.  This worked for me.\n\n*For those not using McAfee: I am not sure of its validity because the McAfee solution worked in my case.  Solution two is to run the FontBook app, and ensure that AppleGothic font is enabled, not duplicated, and validated (you validate it from the \"File\" menu).\n\n", "Q: Use only one function key as standard function key I'd like F2 to used as a standard function key.

If your admin has emailed you these settings trust that they will be complete. The settings you have in the screenshot above would be meant for an office computer residing inside the company office.\nThe problem why you cannot connect to the email server would be because the IP addresses are internal (10.0.0.x). This means that you need to be connected to the company network to access the email server with these details. This leaves you with a few different solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*On an iPad this would mean that you would need to be connected to the company wifi whilst attempting to fetch your email. You would need to sit inside your office and connect.\n\n*Ask your admin for VPN access, and through your iPad iOS settings enable the VPN access. This creates a virtual tunnel over the internet wherever you are directly to the company internal network, making the iPad believe that it is accessing the company network directly. You can then use the email settings as per your screenshot to connect.\n\n*Ask your admin for the public IP addresses to the email server and use them for your email seetings instead. (example: 212.120.243.xxx)\n\n\nHope you find the solution you need. Good luck!\n", "Q: Download ios 7 apps how?

My most recent backup does appear in iTunes under Preferences.\nHow can I access that one, as the other is actually 8 months old? My iPhone has been stolen I am keen to recover my most recent data.\n\nA: You can only restore a backup onto an iPhone, iPad, iPod or WATCH that is running the same, or a more recent version of its operating system.\nIf your latest backup isn’t showing up as an option when attempting to restore your iPhone, first set it up as new, and update to the latest version of iOS. Then try another Restore.

Whilst it would have free upgrades within its cycle e.g. 8.1, .2, .3 effectively this does not mean you get a free upgrade to a significantly new version 3 years later e.g. iWork 09. \nIn your case, its likely there was a temporary offer for a free upgrade initially to encourage customers to port to the Apple Store (for software download) rather than traditional disc installation. After a period Apple withdraw software these upgrades.\nIn terms of your re-install, have you signed in with the same Apple Store account used previously? If you haven't, it wont recognise your previous status and upgrades may be un-available. This is true of the 10.8 OS update - if it is on your Apple Store account as installed previously, you can download it again, if you come into the Store clean, you wont even see it as a download. \n\nA: You can/haveto download Pages/Numbers/Keynote (now separate apps, no longer available as a set called iWork) from the App Store.\nWether you have to pay for them or they're free isn't depending on your operating system but on the age of your mac. \n", "Q: Iphone reminder is different I have IOS 7, and I use the default reminders app.\nOne of my reminders is different than the others in a good way.

If I want to use something from the menu I have to push the mouse 3 or 4 times with the track pad to get up to the menu (e.g. for a convert function) then 3 or 4 times to get back down.\nIs it possible to make the menus appear in the applications?\n\nA: Yes!  You can do this, sort of, but if you are willing to adapt to the Mac way of doing things, I think you'll eventually prefer it.\nFirst, how to (sort of) achieve what you want.  Download & install BetterTouchTool, a utility for all kinds of customization and automation.  It's very powerful (but the UI is a little bit wonky).\nOpen BetterTouchTool, and go to the section called \"Automations & Named & Other Triggers\".  Be sure that on the left side of the screen \"All Apps\" is selected (unless you want this behavior in only a specific app).\n\nIn the pane with the title \"Groups & Top-Level Triggers\", click the \"+\" icon at the bottom, and then click \"Select Trigger\" in the pane on the far right, and search for \"Doubleclick Window Titlebar\" and select it.\n\nThen click the \"+\" icon in the pane entitled \"Actions Assigned to Selected Trigger\", and click the button on the right and choose \"Show Menu in Context Menu\".\n\nNow you can open Calculator and have a menu (in a context menu format) available by double-clicking the window title bar:\n\nThis is as close to what you described as I think is possible.\n\nA: No is the simple answer.\nThe Mac UI is based on the premise of the application menu always being at the top. The reasoning was that you just have to move the mouse to the top of the screen to ensure you were at the menu, no hunting to find the menu bar on a window that could be anywhere on the screen.\nThis has been the case since the beginning of Mac OS in the early 1980s\nThis can get some getting used to if you are coming from Windows.\n\nA: Short answer: No, it is not possible to modify the Mac UI in that way, any more than it is possible to modify the Windows UI the other way.\nLong answer: You could code your own programs to put menus on the window. Mac users will complain bitterly about it. Every time I open Inkscape (which does put it's own menus on the window) I end up using another application's 'Save' on the main window.\nYou have obviously recently switched from Windows or Linux. Neither method is \"better\", it's a design choice. Like most other switchers (in both directions) you try to remake the new UI in the image of the old. \n", "Q: unallocated space on disk0 under Mavericks I have the same kind of issue than here : \nCreate new partition in unallocated space with diskutil\nbut on disk0 !

The usual way of moving the dock --moving the pointer to the edge of the display, as detailed in the Apple support documentation does not work.\nIs this possible when the displays are arranged in this way?\n\nA: Best workaround I have found so far:\nWhen the spaces are arranged vertically, you can move the dock by switching which display is the primary display.\nIn Settings > Displays > Arrangement, drag the thin grey bar (representing the menu bar) from the box representing the current display with the dock to the box to the other display's box.\nBar in bottom display:\n\nDrag it to the top display:\n\nThis will move the dock to the other display.

I recently had to replace the hard drive in my 2012 MacBook Pro; it wasn't dead yet, but had a bad block. I use the laptop for work, so I bought a new one. Anyway, I decided to try and install the old, bad block drive in the old MacBook 2010.\nI got the folder/flashing question mark, so tried option key at startup. That gives me the Recovery partition, which I can select. However, once I do so, I'm back to the folder/question mark. Wondering if because the drive in question had OS X Mavericks on it, it's not playing nice with the 2010 MacBook Pro's architecture/motherboard/etc?\nAnybody have any ideas as to what I can do here? Would like to give the laptop to my daughter if I can get it working.\n\nA: The differing architecture shouldn't be a problem. If you installed Mavericks on a 2012 MacBook that drive should boot okay on a 2010 MacBook. If you are unable to boot into OS X and unable to boot into the Recovery then it suggests both are corrupted in some way.\nInternet Recovery might be an option, but unfortunately for Internet Recovery to work on a 2010 MacBook it would have needed to have this early 2012 EFI Firmware ROM update installed. If your MacBook isn't offering that option then I assume that means it didn't receive this update.\nTwo options are, to create a USB installer for Mavericks and try reinstalling Mavericks on that same hard drive, or to buy another hard drive and install Mavericks using those instructions. I'd lean towards the latter, as if the drive failed a Hardware Test that isn't a good sign. Modern hard drive are designed to cope with a certain amount of bad blocks. If the drive has enough bad blocks that it failed a Hardware Test I just wouldn't trust it.\nBTW There is also this free tool to simplify the process of creating a USB installer for Mavericks called DiskMaker X.\n", "Q: My mac would not boot so I formatted the drive and now it has no OS So there is a whole other backstory as to why my computer would not boot and why I needed to format the drive. The only thing I need to know is how can I install an OS to my computer. I tried CMD-R, but it only gives me the option to upgrade to Lion and when I click to do that it tells me that Lion is no longer available. I do not have access to other macs so I don't know how I can install an operating system on my own. Oh and my computer is one of the 2010 Macbook Pros.\n\nA: When you formatted your drive, you must have been \"standing\" on some other boot drive ... backup (??). That said, clone its OS to your newly formatted drive. Use Carbon Copy Cloner ... the best. If you don't already have CCC, get it and install it on the drive where you \"stood\" to do your original formatting.\n", "Q: Can I run top as screensaver? My employer has recently issued me a MacBook Pro to play with. I have a lot of Linux experience, but I was struck by how nice the terminal looks on the Mac in full screen mode, especially when running \"top\". I think it'd look impressively \"hackerish\" as a screensaver.\nHas anyone figured out a way to make this work? Of course, I'd have to disable the usual power saving mode where the display is turned off. \nThere's one project out there, but based on it's website it's very rough if it even works.\n\nA: If you're looking for hackerish screensavers, the old Xscreensaver bundle was converted to OSX a while ago.\nNicely hacker type examples would be Sonar, AppleII, and Phosphor. Possible GLMatrix too.\nHowever, to answer your question: https://superuser.com/questions/420546/osx-run-bash-or-app-as-the-screensaver\nWrite an applescript to run Terminal, run Top, and fullscreen itself. Then put that script into the app.\n\nA: If you install the OS X version of XScreenSaver, the phosphor saver simulates an old phosphorous terminal display. It can be configured to run any command in the terminal display, including top:\n\nI find the settings -scale 2 -delay 40 -program top work quite well, and look quite \"hackerish\".\n\nA: The LookThrough screensaver does nearly what you are looking for on Mavericks and Yosemite.\nIt permits to maintain your Mac correctly secured when at the same time you maintain on screen the actual output of a top command.\nThe output on screen won't be exactly a synchronous copy of what would be on screen without the screen saver. This output will be an asynchronous copy, but the delay is so small that it is perfect to avoid completly eating the CPU of your Mac and to avoid to give you the feeling to be on slow motion.\nIt does also let you maintain on screen whatever you want.\nI use it to keep on screen graphs of cacti output of network equipment\nperformance.\nIf you are looking for a solution on Lion or Mountain Lion,\nplease look at this old question Transparent locked screen.\n\nA: You can use ScriptSaver, since, if you have Require password after sleep or screen saver begins enabled after IIRC OS X 10.7 you'll otherwise not see through and get a black screen (I'm on 10.8.5). Here's an example of using it to launch iTerm with top.\n\nActivation Script\ntell application \"iTerm\" to create window with profile \"Hotkey Window\" command \"top\"\nScreen Saver\nLookThrough. Alternatively, JohnnyNash, Transparent.\nDeactivation Script\ntell application \"iTerm\"\nclose front window\nquit\nend tell\n\n\nA: If you want to save some computer memory and maybe cpu usage, here's a way to record the \"hackerish\" output from your Top command and use it as your screensaver.\nThe downside of this approach is that the sreensaver will notbe able to show any live Top data. If a live output is important, than Alex's answer is probably the best solution (excluding of course writing a program).\nIf however, you just want to do this for it's cool looks, the video approach will probably be a lot lighter on the system resources and can be done using official Apple programs. Plus, you won't need to run a full screen app in the background (though actually that is a pretty cool concept @Alex, and I might look into ot later for my own uses).\nAnyway, here's the little walkthrough for making a screen capture screensaver:\n\n\n*\n\n*This short video shows how to make a screensaver with Apple's Quartz Composer. Unfortunately, this program no longer comes with Xcode by default.\n\n*To get the Quartz Composer go to developer.apple.com/downloads and search for it on the home page. A list of Graphics Tools for Xcode program should come up, I installed the latest one and it works just fine on OSX 10.9.4 (I say this because the maker of the above video said that one of the older versions didn't work with his OS.)\n\n*You can use the  QuickTime Player to record your program by going to File > New Screen Recording.\n\n*Record a few minutes of video, and cut/trim the video as needed to make it look good while looping by going to Edit > Split Clip and Edit > Trim. I think you can also copy-and-past your split segments as needed.\n\n*Export the clip in a resolution of your choosing, but if you're just recording the Terminal, you probably don't need a very high resolution.\nIf you do record a very long video or you want to use high resolution, your file may come out pretty large and resource-inefficient, but luckily there is a work around. In this case, I would actually recommend using a non-Apple program for the video compression. This program has been around for quite a while, and in my opinion seems to be pretty reputable. It's called HandBrake. I personally use it very often when compressing my screen captures and class lectures. If you use the right settings, it does a really great job.\nIf you do decide to compress your vide with HandBreak, post a comment here, and I can suggest some settings that I use for my recordings.\nHope this helps! :)\n", "Q: Mystery application?

If I just manually click into the list and write Tahoma, it works and I am able to use the Tahoma font.\nOther applications, like TextEdit, show Tahoma and I am able to use it just from picking it from the font list.\nI found lots of guides here one AskDifferent, as well as on the apple support forums and some other forums. Things I checked and tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*The folder /Library/Fonts contains \"Tahoma Bold.ttf\" and \"Tahoma.ttf\"\n\n*The folder /Library/Fonts/Microsoft doesn't contain any Tahoma fonts\n\n*I tried to copy the two fonts also to /Library/Fonts/Microsoft - this didn't work\n\n*I used font book to check the fonts and search for duplicates, everything was alright\n\n*I booted Mac Os using safe mode (holding shift) to reset the font cache, this didn't help either\n\n*Microsoft Office is up to date, no new updates are available\n\n\nThe strange thing is, that the font was showing before. Probably it was removed from the list during some previous updates.\nDo you have some ideas, what else I could try? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Microsoft's applications use their own font cache. You could try deleting the cache and launch one of the applications again. It should just generate a new cache file.\nYou will find the cache file named \"Office Font Cache\" in \"~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/Preferences/Office 2011\".\n\nA: I placed a copy of tahoma.ttf from HD/Library/Fonts into HD/Library/Fonts/Microsoft and restarted Word. So it's a duplicate but it now shows in Word.\n", "Q: Is there any way to broadcast a part of your screen as webcam on OSX (for twitch, omegle etc)? Title: can you get a section of your screen recognised as if it was a webcam, so sites like twitch and omegle will read from it?\n\nA: You can use OBS, also known as Open Broadcaster Software.\nHere's the official site's description of OBS:\n\nOpen Broadcaster Software is free and open source software for video recording and live streaming.

While checking out my bugs in Radar on my iPhone, I discovered a \"hide\" toggle that appears when you hit the arrow at the bottom right if the screen. It is set to hide by default - what is it? How should it be set?\n\nA: This is just a guess but perhaps it is to allow you to start documenting a bug but only make it visible when you have completed documenting it.\nAll Apple seemed to say about it is: \"Hidden: these reports are hidden from view\".\nhttps://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/using-bug-reporter/\n", "Q: Can't run an ova file I download virtual box from http://www.modern.ie/en-US/virtualization-tools#downloads and extracted it.

You can speed this up and hold the option key down and this will keep the (x) to close the Desktops shown so you don't have to hover over the selected Desktop and wait for it to show itself.\nThe only way that I would think you might be able close them all at once without performing the above process is probably with an Automator script or AppleScript.\n", "Q: Identify iPad generation by box pictures I found an auction, where someone put a new unpacked device in iPad 1st generation section for corresponding price of iPad 1, while its clear that it is not iPad 1 just by looking at 1st photo included.\nThe person selling the device didn't write any other informations beside that it has 16GB HDD and is brand new.\nI have tried to contact the seller to confirm if this is 4th generation iPad or not, but did't receive any answer from him/her so far.\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately seller didn't include photo of box back.(2nd photo shows \"layout\" of labels on it, but text itself cannot be read)\nNow lets become Sherlock Holmes :)\n\n*\n\n*1st photo shows front of the box, which may belong to any Apple\ntablets, besides 1st generation which were packed in different boxes\nwith Ipad picture on top, in almost 1:1 scale\n\n\n\n*2nd photo shows us, that this is Ipad, not Ipad Air or Ipad mini.\n\n\n*On 4th photo we can see Apple logo. 3rd generation has ICloud logo\ninstead.

Shift + Alt + I does the same for moving to the beginning of the line.\nBut in macvim, Shift + Alt + A produces this character: Å, and Shift + Alt + I produces a carat ^.\nI would very much like to keep the vim key mapping behavior consistent between my Mac, and my Ubuntu machine at work, but I can't figure out how to do so.\nIs there a way I can make vim clobber any of Mac's keybindings so that they remain purely vim keybindings? Note that the above key combination does the same thing even in this input field, so it seems this is a global thing in Mac that I would like to disable if possible.\n\nA: I am an idiot...\nI can just map the special characters...\nimap Å <ESC><S-a>\nimap ˆ <ESC><S-i>\n\nProblem solved.\nThat said, apparently if you have macvim gui, you can use set macmeta in your vimrc and then do things like imap <S-M-a> <ESC><S-a> which will work in theory, but I prefer to work in terminal and unfortunately macmeta is not available in terminal macvim\n", "Q: Automator Service that works with and without selection I have an AppleScript that I want to run with a keyboard shortcut. The script uses the current selection of text if it is available, but will also work without it. I have created an Automator Service for this. \nIf I select \"Service receives selected text\", it works if I have text selected, but will not run if I don't have text selected. I can change to \"Service receives no input\", but then I won't get the selection even if I have something selected before.\nWhat I am looking for is some way to launch the script and pass in the selection is available, and launch the script with no (or empty) input if nothing is selected. But it should work with the same keyboard shortcut in both cases. Is this possible?  Thanks!\n\nA: I don't have an exact answer to your problem but you could perhaps consider a normal applescript that sends the COPY command and checks the contents of the clipboard before and after.

I know how to send a message to X@txt.att.net and have it show up as a text message. I am wondering if there is a way to e-mail a message and have it go through iiMessage instead of SMS. \n\nA: There is no way. iMessage is a proprietary service, and the sender needs access to the receiver's public key to send a message. Techcrunch explains the whitepaper Apple released on iMessage's implementation in this way:\n\nWhen someone starts an iMessage conversation with you, they fetch your public key(s) from Apple’s servers. Before that message leaves the sender’s device, it’s encrypted into something that only your device knows how to decrypt.\n\nAs email doesn't have that handshake component, there's no way for you to encrypt the message client-side.\n", "Q: What does an icon that looks like a pair of connected chain links next to a wireless network name mean? When I click on the WiFi symbol in the menu bar on my Mac I get a list of wireless networks, most of them with little lock icons next to them. But some of them show what looks like a pair of chain links instead (see image below). What does this mean? That these networks are personal hotspots?\n\n\nA: It's a personal hotspot created by an iOS device to share the cellular data connection that the phone has over Wi-Fi.\n", "Q: Unable to download Apps on iPad after streaming for an hour For the past 3 days, I have been unable to download any apps on my iPad. The Apple ID button in Settings is greyed out, and does nothing when clicked.\nBut, I can still download on my iPhone as before\n\nA: Frequently, odd behavior of an iOS devices is addressed simply by turning the device off, then on again. \nOr if that does not work, a soft reset may be required. A soft reset involves pressing and holding both the power button (upper right edge) and the home button (bottom center front) simultaneously. Hold those buttons for a period long enough that you see the Apple logo appear on the screen. A soft reset does not typically result in data loss.\n", "Q: What is the quality of the music sold in the iTunes store? What is the quality of the music sold in the iTunes store? Is this quality comparable to that of a lossless file or CD?\n\nA: I wouldn't say night and day. The difference may be between afternoon and dinner time. I think that I have a pretty good audio system. I use Revel Ultima Salon 2 speakers backed up by an Ayre V-5xe amp, Ayre preamp, Acoustic Research DAC8 and an Aurender N100H as a source. Other sources are a recently significantly upgraded CJ  Walker turntable and an Oppo BDP  95 disc player. When I play the same piece if music at 256 and in lossless, I often find that there is a slight but palpable loss of what I think of as a sort of sheen to the music. That sheen is not filled with 'hitherto unheard notes'. It is however filled with micro nuances to existing notes. It's the realism to cymbals and drums. However, on many recordings, I'm very hard pressed to hear any difference all. If the stuff wasn't there in the first place, it's hard to hear it on playback no matter the file (at 256 and above). \nThe Apple product is very good. If I want to listen to something critically, I'll hunt down a hi res flac or alac file, use a good quality cd or SACD or I'll use my turntable. On the other hand, for good quality, relatively inexpensive, every day listening, Apple's product is very good. I think that despite the numbers (256), Apple does some magical things within the ACC encoding.\nI concur with the view that 256 is an average. Indeed, I think that it's floor. As I said above, I use an Aurender N100H digital streamer. The Aurender app on my iPad reveals the bitrate of all songs that are playing. Frankly, a very large number of Apple's ACC files report bitrates in the high 300s.\n\nA: From this article:\n\nMusic encoded as 256kbps AAC files first came to the iTunes Store in 2007 with the launch of Apple's iTunes Plus. That marked the debut of DRM-free music tracks encoded at a higher quality bitrate that Apple claims is virtually indistinguishable from the original recordings.\n\nAs of 2007 the audio files sold in the iTunes store have been encoded using the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) codec and distributed with .m4a extensions from the iTunes store. The 256 kbps setting is an average bit rate encoding scheme, not a fixed bit rate encoding scheme. The actual sample rate is varied dynamically based on the content and time.\n\nIs this quality comparable to that of a lossless file or CD?\n\nThis is somewhat subjective. The encoding is a lossy encoding so from a purely bit-wise perspective the content sold in the iTunes store is not 100% identical to content from a CD -- when expanded back to a .wav format to match the bits on a CD, the expanded bits from the AAC file would not match perfectly with the bits on the CD because of of the lossy encoding. However, it is said, bitrate of the encoding used on iTunes files imparts no human-perceptible loss in the audio when compared to the source CD material. This sort of stuff is harder to verify, requiring double blind tests and the opinions of hopelessly fallible human beings.\n\nA: The difference in sound quality between iTunes resolution and CD resolution is night and day on a decent stereo system.\nWith iPod and stock earbuds less noticeable.\n\nA: There is a real difference that may be expressed depending the audio system you use:\nFor normal, cheap and mainstream audio products like iPods, boombox, \"stereos\" and \"beginners hi-fi systems\" there will be no difference.\nWhile listening on expensive well-configured audio systems ... you will clearly notice the difference from sharp, precise, involving, immersive music and environment of \"genuine\" audio sources from the ones that are compressed, which will lack this \"natural and warm\" feeling.\nThis immersive and warm \"experience\" really exists, the high end equipment are purchased by people who wants to experience that feelings, mostly alone and not as a show-off articles. And it is not cheap.\n\nA: Listening to my cousins studio monitors via a pro/am-mixer I allways gets tired, but changing to the cd on the same setup, livens me up. I must admit that I am a psyciatric patient, so my brains are preoccupied with the \"rightness\" of the music, and it evades me in .m4a. Presently my ISP supplies me with music in a Dolby-compression. This works very fine. Uptill that we streamed it in a .mpg-format which I could not listen to on my NAD/Bowers-Wilkins setup. I have no explanation to these fenomenae and I have not listened to .m4a on the hi-fi, but I could do so if anyone is interested.\n\nA: I think there is a difference. I have been auditioning entry level high end speakers (~1300 magnepans) at a dealer and notice my phone music played through their system doesn't sound as good as their cd player. The difference is much as described by the commenter above: the iTunes file doesn't sound alive. \n\nA: Yes, an uncompressed file will always sound better than a compressed file from the same master, but Apple claims to encode their itunes files from the 192K/24bit masters. That changes everything.\n", "Q: Can one mount a FileVault 2 encrypted drive from Windows? I encrypted an external drive with FileVault 2. Now it would be great if I could access it from a Windows PC. Is this outright impossible? I found no definitive answer either way.\n\nA: As of writing there is no software that natively supports working with FileVault 2 encrypted drives within Windows.\nThere are ways to access the content of a FileVault 2 encrypted volume on other platforms including Windows (for example libfvde), assuming you have the passkey and sufficient patience, but none that allow an encrypted volume to be used as a regular drive on Windows.\nAt the moment, to the best of my knowledge, there isn't even any software that allows Windows to natively understand drives that use unencrypted CoreStorage volumes.\n", "Q: iPhone 5s storage space iTunes tells me that I have no storage space on my phone.  It is the music that is taking up space.  But I only have 145 songs on the phone that I have selected (3 playlists).  The phone says that there are 600 songs.  How do I get only the extra space back from the music I don't want on the phone.\n\nA: On your iPhone, navigate to Settings > General > Usage.\nAt the top of this page there will be a list of apps in order of how much space they use. You can use this to decide what to delete to make more room for your music.\nYou can delete apps on the home screen by holding down on them until they start to wiggle.

It says it is verified, but not activated yet. How do I activate it?\nWhen I want to download something from the App Store, it tells me:\n\nThis Apple ID has not yet been used with the App Store. Please review your account information.\n\nWhen I click \"review\" it sends me through this process in which I have to agree to the \"Terms and Conditions of the Apple Privacy Policy\".\nWhen I click the little box to agree to the terms and conditions, there is nothing left to do. It just sits on the screen and does not allow me to proceed or does not have an option to proceed. What am I supposed to do?\nHow can I activate my new Apple ID account in order to be able to download from the App Store?\n\nA: Did you receive a verification email at the email address you set up as your AppleID?  If not, log into https://appleid.apple.com using the email and the password you created. In there, you should have options on the screen to verify the email address if it is not already verified.\n\nA: The resolution for me was to launch iTunes on my Mac (Music app on Big Sur and later), and sign in from the account menu there.\nHave some patience and keep trying if it at first does nothing; I had to log in twice as clicking on the \"Review\" button on the first attempt did nothing.\nI had to accept the terms of service and reenter my payment details, even though I had already done both these things from signing in to the Apple ID website.\nIn the final step of the log in wizard, I received an error message, but it appeared that nevertheless iTunes was logged in. I could then exit iTunes and launch the App Store, and I was prompted three times to log in, but I no longer received the error message instructing me to review my account information.\nIt seems that the third time was a charm, because it then displayed a welcome message.

I then have my firewall (pfSense) named as example.com. From within my network, I can access every machine by it's fully resolved hostname (webserver.example.com, jenkins.example.com, nas.example.com, etc). This works great on all my machines.\nThe issue comes into play when I try to add external access, specifically to my gitlab server. I own a domain and use dynamic DNS to update it to always point to my residential IP address. I've then opened port 443 to point to my internal gitlab IP and added a CNAME entry for gitlab.example.com to point to example.com. This works as expected, I can now access gitlab.example.com from both inside and outside my network.\nThe issue is that OS X now has a problem resolving the proper IP address. gitlab now resolves to both 192.168.1.XXX and whatever my external IP address is. OS X inconsistently chooses the wrong IP to access. When I ping gitlab.example.com, sometimes I'll see my internal IP, sometimes my external. nslookup always seems to show the internal IP, while Network Utility's lookup function seems to show either both IPs (76.xx.xxx.xxx, 192.168.1.xxx) or just the external IP. This only seems to be a problem when accessing my server from the command line via git. The connection times out because it can't seem to find the server.\nUsing Chrome, I seem to always be able to access the web client, regardless of which IP get's resolved. Safari can only access the server if the internal IP is resolved. When the external IP is used, Safari notifies me that it can't open the page \"because the server where this page is located isn't responding.\" I can \"force\" the OS to forget the external IP by flushing the DNS cache (sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder), which works for a few minutes, but then it goes right back to the external IP.\nI'm confused about why this issue is happening. Ideally, I'd like OS X to always use the internal IP if it has the option. But even if it's using the external IP, why wouldn't it be able to access the server? Is my ISP blocking loopback traffic from my IP back to my IP?\nThe reason I'm posting this question here, is because only OS X seems to have this problem, and I can reproduce it reliably with multiple Macs. Neither Linux or Windows seem to have this problem. Each of those always resolve the internal IP when inside the network, and the external IP outside the network. This is on multiple machines too. I'm not exactly a networking or DNS expert, so any help would be appreciated. It's quite likely that I just have a setting wrong somewhere, but I have no idea where to begin looking.\n\nA: It sounds like what you're trying to do is called Split Horizon DNS, and it can be quite tricky. That said, it sounds like you have quite a bit of it already set up but that the internal DNS is not authoritative for your domain.\nIf you have not already done so, you need to modify your internal DNS to create a primary zone for example.com. Then, when you query for your domain, the DNS should not look outside for an address.\n", "Q: Finding Apps that do not appear in Macbook dock I recently got a macbook pro. Shouldn't programs like iMovie and GarageBand appear in the dock? When I search for them, I cannot find them. When I go to the App Store to download them, it tell me that they are already downloaded. Where can I open these applications?\n\nA: Another option is to click the magnifying glass in the upper right corner (Spotlight), and type the name of the application you're looking for.  Once the application is running, you can add it to the dock permanently by pressing control and clicking the trackpad over the application's icon, then selecting the Options and finally, the Keep in Dock option.\n\nA: Apps reside in /Applications, available from the Finder sidebar. The Dock only shows applications which are default apps, installed by an installer that places the shortcut there (e.g. iWork '09) or that you place there yourself.\n\nA: You can also find your Applications in Launchpad. The default gesture to get to Launchpad is to draw all 5 fingers from splayed to together on the trackpad.\n\nA: Applications are not added to the dock as standard. If you want to find your apps, loca the launchpad icon in the dock.\n\nAnd this will display your apps in an iPad style layout which you can page back and forth within.\n\nYou can drag the app from here to the dock if it as an app you use a lot.\nYou can always search via spotlight. Click the magnifying glass in the main menu at the top of your desktop and type the name of the app you are looking for.\n", "Q: When playing a TV in iTunes via AirPlay to Apple TV, it doesn't play the next episode I have some TV shows in iTunes that I am AirPlaying to my Apple TV, at the end of each episode AirPlay disconnects and iTunes doesn't play the next episode. Is this default behaviour or do I need to make sure that the names/meta data of the TV shows themselves 'flow'?\n\nA: This is the default (and only) behavior.  Whether you play the TV show from the special TV Show section of iTunes or create a playlist, iTunes will only play on TV show and then stop.  Try the playlist approach - iTunes won't even play the playlist, but forces you to select one show and then start playing.\n", "Q: What's a good key binding for tmux on OS X? The default tmux binding is ctrl+b, which is pretty awkward to hit on a Mac keyboard, because there's no right control.  C-a was the default in screen, but that's the default in OS X for going to the beginning of a line (my shell uses vim mode, but it's inconvenient when ssh'd to other machines).  You can't use alt as a meta key, and cmd+a is already used to select all text.\nSo - what are others using that doesn't override default OS X behavior that works well?\n\nA: I've been using Ctrl+s for some time. It does not shadow any shell command I know of, and is quite convenient to hit if you also have CapsLock mapped to Ctrl (this can be done from within System Preferences->Keyboard->Modified Keys).\n", "Q: iTerm2 where is [ ] keybindings? Is there a reason why ALT+8 / ALT+9 does not produce [ and ] in iTerm2 ?\nI'm running with defaults and a .bashrc/.bash_profile that produces the correct result in Terminal.app. \n\nA: iTerm2's defaults for the Option keys are called “Esc+”, which basically means it will type an escape character (\\033) before any character you type while holding down Option. To get the same behavior you see in Terminal, go to Preferences > Profiles > (your profile) > Keys and select Meta under both \"right option key\" and \"left option key\".\n", "Q: Outlook 2011 - Cannot cancel large synch operation, cannot remove and start anew I have installed the native Microsoft Outlook for Mac 2011 client on my MBP and it's been running fine for 6 months.\nTwo weeks ago, I moved all emails to a subfolder I created with the name \"archive.\"\nSince then, Microsoft Outlook is stuck in a perpetual synch state. (Synching with Exchange Server)\nI want to undo this but cannot.\nI tried removing the app and the data directories, but upon reinstalling the old data was still intact.\nIf there is no way to cancel, I would like to at least (a) fully uninstall following the steps outlined on the Microsoft support site, and (b) put up with the large first time download (synchronization) of messages.\nAny guidance would be appreciated.\n\nA: Have you tried to rebuild the database and/or setup a new identity to 'try again'?\nThe first, rebuilding the database, is quite easy:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure Outlook is not running\n\n*Hold the option (alt) key\n\n*Open Outlook 2011\n\n*Select your default profile, presumably Main Identity and select the [Rebuild] option\n\n*Wait... This could take a while.\n\n\nThe second option, creating a new identity is done in nearly the same way as the previous steps. Instead of selecting [Rebuild], select the plus sign [+]. This will allow you to create a new, second identity. Once configured, it'll get the state as known and persisted by the Exchange server itself. \nAs a second note: Normally, even with very large quantities of 'changes' in an Exchange account the sync should still be pretty reliable.

So I need to do a recursive search of files.\nIs there really no native way to do this in Mac?\n\nA: From the Library folder, a simple search (CMD+F) for Name starting with com.microsoft will recursively find all files and folders in every Library subfolder. \n\nA: The folder which you are performing the search mustn't be on Spotlight' exception list in order for its items and subitems (files and folders) to be found, even on Finder's search box. You can check this on System Preferences -> Spotlight -> Privacy.\n", "Q: How's battery life of the Oct 2013 Macbook Pro 15\" Retina? I am using a Mid-2013 MacBook Air 13\" and the battery life is great!\nNow I am considering upgrade to a bigger screen and is checking a refurbished Oct 2013 MacBook Pro 15\" retina.\nEverything seems perfect except I am not sure whether it is energy efficient as the Haswell CPU in the MacBook Air. Any experience to share?\n\nA: No, it's not as energy efficient as the MacBook Air. How could it be? Apple lists the expected (high end) battery life for each of their battery powered devices on their site. If battery life and a large screen are your primary interests, it sounds as though you'd be better off getting an iMac or a Mac Pro, assuming you need the dedicated graphics card. If you don't need the dedicated graphics card, there's always the Mac Mini. These all either come with large screens or can be easily attached to large monitors and their power lasts for as long as you pay your electricity bill. And you won't have to worry about becoming a hunchback from using the least ergonomically designed piece of modern tech, the laptop. \n", "Q: User account creation date time? I am using a shared mac in which a new user account was created by another user.  I want to know the dateTime of the account creation.  Is there a way to find it out without asking the peer?\n\nA: A quick way to do it would be to go to the directory\n/Users\n\nAnd add the Date Created option via the View Options\n\nThis assumes that the home directory was created at the same time of account itself\n\nA: Try also this in a Terminal:\nls -l ~/*/.localized\n\nThese files are usually created when the account is created.\n", "Q: I want my Mac Mini power button to shut down the computer I’ve recently started using my Mac Mini as a media server. I really don’t want it to be powered on all the time though. I’ve removed the password prompt and have told Plex to automatically open on startup which works great, but I now need a way to shut down the computer when I’m done using it.\nThe box sits on a shelf in my room and isn’t connected to a monitor, keyboard and mouse and I’d like it to stay this way. From what I can tell the only actions the power button can take are putting the Mac to sleep, displaying the shutdown dialog, and forcing power off.\nIs there any way to change my settings such that a simple press of the power button initiates a full system shutdown?\n\nA: I'm not aware of a way to make the power button tell your Mac mini to perform a normal shutdown, however one solution that comes to mind (assuming you have an iOS device) is to shut your Mac mini down from your iPhone or iPad using an app like iShutdown.\nThere is a small application that you install on your Mac.\nAnd then you have the app on your phone that has a list of computers you can shutdown and a big virtual power button for each.\n", "Q: MacBook shows circle with line through on boot even on Safe Mode and kernel panics I was rebooting my early 2011 MacBook to run a hardware test on system boot using the shift key.

This includes everything in /System, but will not modify your personal files in any of the /Users folders. /Applications that are part of OS X will be replaced, so if you have made any modifications to the system applications they will be overwritten, but your own apps that you've placed in /Applications will remain.\n", "Q: Can't find SUMIF in my Numbers functions. Could someone tell me where to find it? For the first time I am working with Numbers rather than Mac Exel, which I was running on my old G4. I now have a 2012 MacBook Pro with Mavericks, and the one function I use more than any other is SUMIF. However, this does not appear in my menu of choices.

However, it might not be available anymore in 10.13 High Sierra. \n\nA: Google brought me to this answer, so thought I would update with my findings. I use ftp-srv on node which is very quick to set up and run on the command line ftp-srv [url] [options] and can serve from a directory of your choice.\n\nA: As of writing, brew search ftp returns the following FTP servers:\n\n\n*\n\n*pure-ftpd\n\n*vsftpd\n\n*proftpd\n\n\nBased on their websites, pure-ftpd appears to be your best choice for easy installation.\npure-ftpd\n\nBeginners can install a Pure-FTPd server in 5 minutes.

I wonder if before I did that the thief have reset factory setting first. Is it possible?\nIt seems that the mere act of setting my iPhone on password should make the iPhone unusable even without find my iPhone feature. Am I correct here?\n\nA: If you haven't enabled Find My iPhone, then you haven't enabled Activation Lock, which means the device can be reset simply by placing it in Recovery Mode and clicking Restore in iTunes. Setting a passcode protects the information on the device but won't prevent against restoring the OS.\n", "Q: How to always allow \"[program] wants to make changes. Type your password to allow this.\" I use a program which prompts me often to \"make changes\" (make a system-level/root-level change). I trust this program and want to always allow it to do so. How is this done? I would expect an \"always allow\" button, but there isn't one.\nI know the system directory which the program wants to modify and that I could lower the permissions of that folder; however, that may have an impact on other applications which expect certain permissions on that folder, so I don't want to do that.\nHere is an example of the dialog.

Problem is, through searching I've found people who say it is easy and others who say it will just fall apart.  But...  Nothing concrete about how to properly go about making sure it works the way it is supposed to...\nAnyone know of any good articles or documentation about adding in a AD server?  Eventually we need to promote it to the master and still have the mac servers as replicas (or at least still part of the system, so we can update them as needed).  \nAny thoughts?\n\nA: You can integrate Active Directory with Open Directory in Mavericks, but it's a much different process then before. You have to give the AD user access to the services you want them to use before adding them to a group. (For instance FileSharing) If you don't you will get some weird errors, especially with Window's users. Once you give them access, then you can add them to groups. Apple wants you to use Profile Manager for all Management purposes, and not use groups at all. I find Groups are nice for server access, and auto mounts, but that's it. Everything else should be done in Profile Manager or a product like Casper.\n\nA: Received this from a community member on SpiceWorks forums...\n\nDavid_CSG  wrote:\nIt won't work in the direction you're trying to go, never has and isn't even supported. Joining Windows AD to Apple's Open Directory has never been an option from Microsoft, and I would recommend strenuously (even vehemently) against trying at all (via any 3rd-party software) where a Domain Controller is involved. Just don't.\nYour best & only option is in the other direction, and is built-in and supported by the Mac OS: Binding FROM the Mac (server or client) to Active Directly.\nThe best you could do is authenticate your Windows client (only !) machines to Apple's Open Directory via pGina, see http://pgina.org/\nThat will not provide any AD domain administration features at all as the Apple OD server doesn't even offer them = Group Policy, and more.\n\n", "Q: What are the networking requirements for a successful AirPlay connection? We are using devices we know are capable of AirPlay (iphone 5 on ios7, apple tv3). Sometimes the phone can see the apple tv, sometimes it cannot. When it cannot, we check, and the apple tv IS still on. What must be true for the phone to see the apple tv?\nOf course they must be on the same wireless network. this is true. However our network is large (we are not in a home), and so there must be some other issues. We even checked and both the phone and apple tv are on the same subnet.

I was watching this video when the instructor was able to position a window by using the maximize button and clicking on one of four positioning options, as seen in the image below. \n\nThis was also not specific to the program, as it was done in different windows for different applications.\nIs this a native OS X feature? If so, which settings were enabled? If not, are there known applications allowing for this feature?\n\nA: This looks like Moom which Is available from the App Store \nhttp://manytricks.com/moom/\n", "Q: Different enterprise signed apps on same iOS device Company A has an Apple Enterprise Developer account and distributes \"in-house\" iOS applications signed with its account key. Likewise, Company B does the same with its own in-house apps.\nIs it possible to install a Company A enterprise-signed app and a Company B enterprise-signed app on the same iOS device? Or are iOS devices restricted to apps from at most one Enterprise Developer? Can someone point to Apple documentation that addresses this question?\n\nA: Yes, it's possible. Apps can be installed from multiple enterprise locations on the same device. Whilst I haven't been able to find a citable source, I have personal experience as I have apps from an enterprise organisation installed on my device as well as the SE iOS beta app which is distributed through enterprise.\n", "Q: Why My Apple iPhone 5s Rebooted automatically?

If it only occurred once, I'm more inclined to say that there's nothing wrong, but regular reboots can indicate either a software or hardware fault. If the device reboots repeatedly, try restoring the device's OS in iTunes. If the problem persists then that may indicate hardware failure.\n", "Q: Why are my songs on my iPhone, but they aren't downloaded? I'm trying to download some songs onto my iPhone (5S, iOS 7), but they are just grey with this little broken circle next to them. Can anyone explain what's going on? I have space on my phone, and when I don't, my computer tells me, but here the songs are just kind of there.\n\n\nA: The circle means the song exists on the device but does not exist in your current iTunes library.

However, there are finger alternatives that can do this. Try Pathfinder by CocoaTech. I believe it has the option to make Finder windows transparent.\n\nA: I believe if you open a new finder window and go into the preferences you can edit the color of the window background. From that you can then modify the alpha channel to add transparency :)\n\nA: NOT AN ANSWER \nTry reverse engineering this\nhttps://www.howtogeek.com/199201/how-to-disable-window-transparency-in-os-x-yosemite/\n", "Q: Default program dropdown in preferences – where is this list retrieved from?

So with a little research I found that control+shift+fn+power replaces the old control+shift+eject on keyboards without eject keys. However I find I have to hold the keys longer for it to work, probably due to the power button having a delay to prevent accidental sleeping/shutdown.\nWhat I'm looking to do is throw caution to the wind and remove that delay so I can simply hit the key combo not hold it, as I'm more likely to lock my station if it's quick than if I have to do it with purpose.\nFor reasons related to what system hooks get fired I need to use this method of locking the screen, so other methods aren't what I'm looking for.\nIt looks like I'll be forking on the NoEjectDelay source to make a NoPowerDelay variation if nothing better comes along.\n\nA: I use LaunchBar which comes with two actions that are instant: Lock Screen and Start Screen Saver (I have a password lock on resume from screen saver so they're more or less equivalent). Both take effect immediately and because LaunchBar is awesome the commands to remember them aren't some four-key, esoteric, multi-key combination I need to burn in to my memory.\nI hit Cmd-Space to bring up LaunchBar. I type loc and I'm on the Lock Screen action. Similarly I can type sta to get to the Start Screen Saver action. I could, if I wanted, make these actions be the top actions for the single letter l and s if I wanted to mess with LaunchBar training, but this suffices.\nThey kick in instantly.\nIf you don't want to shell out for LaunchBar (but I tell you it's worth every penny to barely have to touch your mouse in the course of a work day) you can get similar pop-up and actions from Alfred -- it has a lock shortcut you can type to lock your Mac.\n\nA: I use a simple app called \"Salute\".

In windows, I am running a site using IIS Express on a specific port. On the windows vm, I can write localhost:XXXXX as my address and get the page.\nHowever, the localhost is different on my Mac than it is on Windows, and thus I can't simply write localhost:XXXXX on the mac. I currently have the network to \"Share with my Mac\" on the virtual machine settings.\nWhat do I need to do to access the windows server from the mac? \n\nUpdate\nFor those finding this page using Visual Studio 2015 and Windows 10, there appears to be a difference in how IIS Express works, and this solution no longer appears to solve the issue.  \nUpdate 2\nI have this working now with Visual Studio 2015. The config files for the web application are now stored with the project/solution itself instead of old location in your documents folder. In the solution folder, there is a folder called .vs, and inside that, you need to navigate to the config folder. That's where the applicationhost.config is.\nAfter that, I had to update my firewall to let IIS through (something changed where the old permission no longer worked, not sure if it's a quirk on my machine or not). Then, every thing else is as it has been described in the answer below.\n\nA: There is a major difference in using IIS Express and the 'regular' IIS. The latter as installed by default in Windows.\nIn short, IIS Express runs sandboxed on its host environment. This means by default it cannot be accessed outside. Luckily, you're not the only one asking this as it has been adressed on StackOverflow several times. In my opinion, with this post having one of the better answers.\nFor future reference, this means:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the applicationhost.config file (which holds info and bindings to all your IIS Express projects ever ran locally)\n\n*Execute the netsh http add urlacl url=http://*:8080/ command (possibly some other)\n\n*Open up the Windows Firewall to allow IIS Express and the desired ports to be accessed 'externally' (yes, your Mac = external, as far as Windows is concerned)\n\n\nAs a final tip I'd like to suggest to also add your Windows' system name to the Mac host file. This can easily be done running the following command in the OSX Terminal: \n\nsudo nano /etc/hosts\n\nBy adding the Windows system name you can now use it to navigate to http://your-win-name instead of having to point to an IP Address.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Writing Windows .bat files in Mac Can anyone suggest any decent software for writing .bat scripts in Mac that transfer over to Windows properly? I've tried using BBEdit and Sublime Text to write my .bat scripts but when I bring them over they don't work properly.\nSublime Text doesn't carry do newlines properly (even though it's set for Windows) so the scripts don't run.\nBBEdit doesn't do certain things properly (like echo) even though I set the newline for Windows and the encoding to Western Latin 1. \n\nA: I do use BBEdit successfully for my .bat files. As you say, you need to keep in mind that the newlines are set correctly. The concepts of line feed (LF) and carriage return (CR) are closely associated but used differently on Windows and *nix.\nFor the visitors, TextWrangler is the free (stripped down) version of BBEdit. Both are text editors for OS X, and they do not suck.\nThe screenshot below is the bottom of my .bat file created in BBEdit. I have build this file from scratch and it works just as you would expect. Make sure you have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Text-encoding set to 'Unicode (UTF-8)'\n\n*Line breaks to 'Windows(CRLF)'\n\n\n\nThat should be enough.\nIf you keep having problems with these akward settings, copy a working .bat from windows to your mac and save it as a template for your new scripts.

The update is 28.8 MB and I have 1.1 GB free. But the update apparently requires 1.5 GB free to install, which is absolutely ridiculous. I realize that the update itself will not use the 1.5 GB afterwards, but this just reeks of bad design. This means that on my 16 GB iPad (where I already have to economize the space) I have to waste 10% of the disk in order to be able to install updates.\nSo, is there a way around this issue other than deleting additional apps or data? I have already deleted more than I cared for.\n\nA: Updating through iTunes rather than OTA has a smaller storage space requirement on the device. I believe it's much closer to 1 GB, but I don't have an actual number to provide.\nTo update through iTunes, connect your device over USB, select it and click Update.\n\nA: This huge hunger for disk space can also be rooted in security copies that have to be made in advance. On Windows, they are stored in the %APPDATA% “Apple Computer” directory under “MobileSync>Backup” and “iTunes>iPhone Software Updates”. Create symbolic links to save the needed directories on another disk drive instead.

Can I keep my old foreign number? If so how do I do that?\n\nA: This is not actually a question about Apple.\nThe number is not associated with the phone, but with the subscription (your carrier's HLR maintains a relationship between SIM and phone number). Depending on your foreign carrier they may let you retain the number while not in use, or even forward calls to the US phone (at a cost).\n\nA: If you keep the SIM card, you can switch between both whenever you want\n", "Q: How can I simply and quickly upload just 1 photo from my iPhone to a PC or Mac? This is really frustrating. Occasionally, my work requires me to upload a photo from my iPhone (ios7) to a clients PC or Mac. I used to simply email it to my Gmail account and download it from the web but for whatever reason I can no longer do this (seems I can no longer email something to my self via Mac mail).\nI've got Photostream set up but I cant access it via iCloud - theres just no photo option.\nObviously my clients PCs dont always have iPhoto (which is a huge pain to use anyway).\nWhy isnt there a simple way to transfer a photo from my phone to a computer via Bluetooth or USB?\nIs there just a simple, non-proprietry software solution for transferring just 1 photo between devices?\n\nA: You can email it as an attachment to another email address. For emailing single photos, I got around this problem by setting up a secondary email account and emailing it to myself there. Then I checked the email account from my laptop. For multiple pictures, I had to use a windows machine (Windows 7). I just plugged the iphone into the PC's USB and it worked, reading it as a data drive.\nIt may also work to save it as an attachment in a draft message. Then synch accounts and look in the drafts folder of your computer.\n\nA: I would recommend Pushbullet. You can send just about any message or file between a phone and a computer extremely simply. The catch is that the receiver of the pushbullet must have the Pushbullet chrome extension installed.\n\nA: The most efficient way would be to use Box or Dropbox. If you're looking for a \"just works\" solution, iCloud drive in iOS 8 and OS X 10.10 Yosemite would also work.\n", "Q: Stop Console.app from auto-scrolling while I'm reading a log When using Apple’s Console.app to read logs, the window automatically scrolls to the bottom when a new entry is posted to the log.

It should stop the log from scrolling with new updates.\n\n", "Q: What in the world does this iTunes Terms & Conditions about Virginia & California mean? \nNeither Issuer nor Apple is responsible for lost or stolen Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards, Content Codes, or Allowances. Risk of loss and title for Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards, and Allowances transmitted electronically pass to the purchaser in Virginia upon electronic transmission to the recipient. Risk of loss and title for Content Codes transmitted electronically pass in California upon electronic transmission from Apple; for avoidance of doubt, such recipient may not always be you.\n\nAre they just fooling with us?  Does anybody know what the sentences about Virginia and California actually mean, and the \"for avoidance of doubt\"?\n\nA: \"For avoidance of doubt\" is legal speak for \"let me summarize this in a way that handles any and all cases I might not have explicitly called out in any clause in the contract\". It's a catch-all term used to say \"this is it\". It can cap damages or dues or liability. Here's a good example and explanation:\n\nContract clauses beginning with the phrase, “For the avoidance of\n  doubt” are a common feature of business contracts.\nFor example, Company A is negotiating a three-year contract with\n  Company B to purchase twenty different products from Company B. The\n  contract includes ten pages outlining minimum purchases, pricing and\n  quantity discounts, price adjustments for changes in raw materials\n  costs, methods of calculating credits for returns, etc., with\n  variations for each product.\nCompany A carefully analyzes all the different combinations of prices,\n  refunds, etc., but wants to make certain it doesn’t receive a big bill\n  as a result of unanticipated future permutations.\nCompany A might insert a clause in the contract that says, “For the\n  avoidance of doubt, Company A will never be required to pay Company B\n  more than $2 million during any calendar month.” (PG has somewhat\n  simplified the likely language.)\nWith this clause in place, as Company A’s CFO manages cash flow, she\n  knows she will never have to write a monthly check for more than $2\n  million to Company B.\n\nIn the case of the iTunes contract it says first that any of \"Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards, and Allowances\" are handled in the state of Virginia -- presumably they use this state for these transactions as it offers something ammenable to Apple when it comes to handling these things. You can see what Virginia has for state laws around gift cards here. They're rated \"red\" by that site meaning they're fairly anti-consumer, pro-seller there. From their summary chart:\n\nGood\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Only cards with an expiration date escheat to the State of Virginia after 5 years\n  \n*Virginia has legally defined the notion of a gift card\n  \n*Virginia has legally specified whether or not gift cards escheat to the state\n  \n  \n  Bad\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*No limits on expiration dates\n  \n*No maximum post-sale fee or minimum time frame before charging monthly fees\n  \n*Merchants are not required to give cash back\n  \n*Virginia does not maintain a consumer-centric web page dedicated to gift card laws\n  \n\nThose bad things would look good to me if I was Apple.\nAs for \"Content Codes\" passing to you via California, again it likely goes back to some legal goodness the state of California affords a company sending out content codes that other states do not. So Apple says \"we're doing this type of business, with you, via California and you agree to that\".\nCaveat lector: I am not a lawyer; I just play one on the Stack Exchange network...\n", "Q: Is it possible to hide the name of the desktop icons? I know it is possible to hide the name by renaming the file/folder to something else. The problem comes with my cloud showing in the desktop. I want it to show and I don't want to change the names of my folders.\nI made a cool icon set for the few things I've got in my desktop and the names there just don't fit.\n\nA: If you want to just hide one filename or folder, the answer is kludgey but it works:\nInsert 58 spaces in the beginning of the filename: the filename \"disappears\" from the desktop.  It still exists (you can Cmd-I or Finder to see it/change it), but it's no longer visible on the Desktop.  In actuality, it's probably showing the first 58 characters of the filename (the invisible spaces) and cutting off the rest, so technically it's not hiding the name, just truncating it, but anyway...  (The 58 may not be an exact number, but that's how many it took to hide \"foo.app\" on my 10.11.6 Mac.)\n\nA: Using just Finder to hide filenames on the Desktop is (to my knowledge) not possible, but I would be happy to be proven wrong about that.\nI realise you don't want to rename files and folders, but the only workaround I know of to \"hide\" the filenames is to rename them to a space \" \".\n\nA: To Hide Desktop Icons, run the following commands in Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool false\nkillall Finder\n\nTo show them again, run:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool true\nkillall Finder\n\nSource: Hide All Desktop Icons in Mac OS X.\n\nA: You can use HiddenMe app to hide Desktop icons on demand with a single click.

But have not got a computer. How do I activate my phone?\n\nA: If it's just for activation, using any computer with iTunes installed will do.\n\nA: I don't think it's possible. My advice is that you either buy a computer or build it yourself (this way is cheaper).\n", "Q: Can I force the Finder's Go Menu to open a new window? The Finder's Go menu offers a bunch of shortcuts to commonly used folders, like Applications, Utilities, Downloads, etc.\nHowever, when I try to jump to one of these folders while I already have a Finder window open, Finder takes over my current window to open the special folder.  This happens whether I use the menu or the keyboard shortcut.\nMost of the time, I'm trying to open a new window so I can quickly pull up something (like a utility) or to move/copy files between one of the special folders and another location.\nIs there a way to have folders from the Go menu open in a new window or a new tab under Mavericks?  I think old versions of OS X had this as a default behavior.\n\nA: Not sure you can open one directly, but Cmd/n  Cmd/shift/[letter] is pretty quick & will achieve the same result.\n", "Q: Sudden proliferation of 'Too many open files in system' errors. Can't do backup My computer is showing signs of impending hard drive disaster. Time Machine recently killed all my backups and has not cooperated since. I tried backing up with Super Duper, but it quit after about a minute. The Super Duper log reported 'Too many open files'. I attempted a backup with Rsync and it hummed along fine for about an hour until it too started spitting out 'too many open files' errors and not copying anything. Carbon Copy Cloner worked longer but skipped a bunch of files. \nBased on other posts here, I have maxed the open file limit and am running rsync again.  Though this process has not completed yet, I am posting here because I do not feel optimistic. I am seeing this 'Too many open files' error all over the place suddenly, so I fear that maxing the file limit is a workaround at best. (assuming it even works)\nThe first time I saw the 'Too many open files' error, I was running a shell script that involved uploading an archive to a remote server and unzipping it. I had done this numerous times before without incident. The number of files hadn't changed. I got this error again while running a Python script to build files using Jinja2. This was also a script I had run previously without any problems. \nThe sudden proliferation of errors of this kind coincides with a general degradation in the performance of my computer, which most frequently takes the form of app and system freezes that can only be resolved with forced restarts. At the very same time rsync choked this evening, Safari was hanging also. As ever, Force Quit was not available and so I had to force a shutdown. There are also more crashes than usual. A recent Apple update that crashed my computer on restart seems to have made everything much worse.  \nCarbon Copy Clone's Disk Center said my Hard Drive seemed to have Read/Write errors, though the Apple Hardware Test and Disk Utility have reported nothing out of the ordinary. Activity Monitor also does not show anything unusual, though I am not an expert in interpreting its output. I think there may be more disk activity than usual. CPU and Memory stats all seem fine.\nAny ideas on what's going wrong here? Is it appropriate to assume the hard drive is the problem? It came with the computer, which is now four years old. Any other possibilities? Any recommendations on how to get everything backed up before the drive -- or whatever -- dies altogether?\nI am running Snow Leopard on a mid 2010 15\" MacBook Pro. I am attempting to back up to a brand new portable USB-connected portable drive which seems to work fine. \n\nA: I have several suggestions that I'll put into two different posts.\nHere's the  first one:\nThis seems to help with practically everything, so why not try it.\nOpen your Disk Utility app, and after selecting your main hard drive (or partition), follow the steps in the picture below. This operation will attempt to find and repair any disk and disk-permission errors.\nPlease note that step 1(b) probably will not work unless you are booted into the Network Recovery Mode, or running off a different hard drive (not the one you are trying to fix). If running step 1 reveals a lot of errors then doing 1(b) would definitely be recommended.\nThe easiest way to do this is to borrow someone else's Mac and connect your computer to it in Target Disk Mode. This will allow you to run Disk Utility on their computer thus letting you perform step 1(b) to your hard drive.\nIf you don't have another computer to borrow, your will need to put you computer into Network Recovery Mode (aka. OS X Internet Recovery). Please see the OS X Internet Recovery section in this hyperlink before proceeding with this fix. Also note that Network Recovery Mode is different from Recovery Mode; the regular recovery mode will not help in this case. To start your Mac in the Network Recovery Mode, please see this link.\nIf none of the above are available on your computer, or Network Recovery simply takes too long on your internet connection, there is a third option. You can make a Bootable OSX Recovery Drive from a USB stick as described at the bottom of this page from Apple.\nHope this helps! :)\n\n\nA: If none of the other backup options work, I would recommend trying the dd command as described here. The benefit of this command is that it brute force clones your hard drive and continues running even if it encounters corrupt sections on your disk (depending on the settings you use, as described in the link and in the comments there).\nI think you might be able to run this directly from your computer, but I would actually recommend running it from an external hard drive or the Network Recovery Mode like I described in my previous post.\nPlease note that this operation can take up to several days to complete, and you should not use your computer during this time, because otherwise some files may get changed while the dd command is trying to save them. \nHere are some other less-brute-force recovery tools to try:\nData Rescue for Mac (It's not free, but this is what our local Mac repair guy uses.)\nData Rescue 3 also has a free demo version if you'd like to try it.\nHere are some freeware recovery tools that are actually quite good:\nPhotoRec recovers most standard file types (not just photos) and is pretty easy to use.\nTestDisk is made by the same people who made PhotoRec, but it's way more advanced (and therefore more involved to run). I would recommend reading the guide on their site if you want to use it.\nBest :)\n", "Q: Which apps are shown in launchpad? (how to flag them?) - Mavericks Since Mavericks I think, launchpad decides on it's own which apps should be shown in.

One of these files is created for each computer you back up.\nIf the whole drive was encrypted, then all backups would have to be made with the same key, which would not be very secure.\n", "Q: How to free space on Time Machine on a Netgear NAS?

What should I do? For the first time, I left my iPhone 5c charging all night for about 4 hours. In the morning when I unplugged it, it had turned off when it was on when I left it for charging. I tried to turn it on, but the screen won't hitch. At first I thought it got stuck, but it seemed like the battery had been damaged because it won't buzz at all. What should I do?\n\nA: Theoretically overcharging a device is not possible, as once it reaches the 100% of the battery capacity, it will just stop charging. \nAre you sure the device was being charged when you left it? Perhaps you connected the iPhone to the charger but not the charger to the AC? \nThis will explain why it won't turn on as it would be battery drained.\nIf this is not the case, going to an Apple Store would be the best option.\nIt's far more likely you just had a failure, unrelated to charging and need service. If it was overcharging, getting a technician to look at it would be even more important that a simple failure, so have it checked out.\n", "Q: How to get a fall-through behavior in case statements in bash v3?

I use Mavericks and want to change the default behaviour in Calendar when a new Event is created. In the preferences it is possible to change some of the settings. But I would like to get two default alerts and no \"basso\" sound (Only \"Message\" not \"Message with sound\"). I Already found that in ~/Library/Calendar/ are folders for each calendar and every calendar seems to have its own settings in its LocalDefaultAlarms folder: \"EventAllDayAlarms.icsalarm\" and \"EventTimedAlarms.icsalarm\".\nBut I'm not able to change these files. Or to say it more clearly, I can change them, but each time Calendar is restarted, they change back to the state before. Besides that, it is the same with the Info.plist file.\nSo, is it possible to prevent Calendar to update these files? Or is there a better method to change these settings?\n\nA: As far as I know, these are the only two ways to change Calendar alert sounds. In both cases, unfortunately, they are universal changes—there is no way to override them for individual events.\nDisable all Calendar alert sounds\nGo to System Preferences > Notifications > Calendar and disable \"Play sound for notifications.\"\n\nChange all Calendar alert sounds (pre-El Capitan)\nWe'll be digging around in System a bit, so be prepared to enter your password a couple times. I'm on El Cap now (my only Mac), and this isn't working for me, but I know it worked in the past. My guess is System Integrity Protection.

My grandfather has been writing a book as a Pages document, but he told me the other day that he suddenly wasn't able to edit the document. He thinks that this happened around the same time that he upgraded to the latest version of Pages.\nWhen I went to take a look at the document, I saw something strange: the Pages document consisted of a series of embedded PDF documents containing the original text of the document. So the first page is a page-size embedded PDF with the file name \"preview1.pdf\", the second is \"preview2.pdf\" and each PDF has a page worth of text.\nIt's a very strange problem. He said this had happened to several of his documents and I opened a few to confirm it. Obviously, I could fix this for one document by copying the text in each PDF page and pasting them into a new Pages document.\nBut the bigger questions are: (1) how did this happen? and (2) is there a systematic way to fix this that doesn't require going through each document and copying each page's text manually?\n\nA: The state of the file you see might be the result of the use of a new function introduced with version 5.2 of Pages: the view only mode.\nSee the official documentation here:\nShare and edit a document with others.\nThe original file on the Mac of your grandfather is still fully editable. The view-only mode does only restrict modification upon the shared version on iCloud.

The OS now sees three ghost monitors that do not exist:\n\nWhen I'm cordless, I can work around by mirroring the monitors, but I typically work with multiple monitors where mirroring is pointless.\nI found a few references to this problem online (particularly here). I followed the directions from the first link (reset PRAM, detect displays, no joy). \nAdditional information\n\n\n*\n\n*The other monitors are all called \"built-in display\". \n\n*Under the hardware system report (About This Mac-> More Info-> System Report -> Graphics Displays), I find only the LCD monitor attached to the Mac.\n\n*'Detect displays' still detects the same phantom displays.\n\n*An external monitor works, but I still see the three phantom monitors.\n\n\nQuestions\nAre there any available solutions or workarounds? For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I use software to disable the extra monitors? \n\n*The poster in the second link above got joy with graphicsenabler = YES options in Chameleon. Can I replicate that setting that in my situation?\n\n\nA: I came up with a workaround when I was finalizing the question: mirror only the phantom displays. To do this, go to System Preferences-> Displays and click Arrange (click gather windows if you don't see an option to mirror displays). \nWhile holding the Option key, drag the windows that you wish to mirror on top of one another.  (In my case, I mirrored all of the phantom monitors on top of one another.) Release the option key and arrange the other monitors as you like.\n\nA: I had the same problem with my Mac Pro 2008 running El Capitan. Mike McCoy's workaround didn't work for me, but it inspired a solution. I positioned my phantom display diagonally adjacent to my real display. My mouse can still escape to the phantom desktop, but only through the bottom right corner \"portal.\" As long as all of my apps keep appearing on my real screen, I'll be OK.\nYes, this is a cr@ppy workaround, but after three hours of web research and trying a dozen suggestions, this is the best that I can do.\n", "Q: Does find my iPhone store history I know the location of my iPhone. However, I want to know the history of where the iPhone has been.\nMy iPhone is stolen. I turned off the sim card. Which was a big mistake. Now I can no longer track the phone.\nI wish I knew where the phone had been?\nThe only time the phone will show that it's lost is if it connects to internet. The thing is there is no free wifi in Indonesia and the simcard there is disabled. So the only time it'll connect to internet is when some possibly not so innocent buyer connect it.\n\nA: No, if you did not enable lost mode, the device's location history is not recorded.\n", "Q: Sound not working on MacBook Air mute box is checked and greyed out My audio on my MacBook Air is not working. When I go into System Preferences and go to Sound, the mute box is checked and greyed out. My Mac can't play anything including iTunes and YouTube, even system sounds such as the sound when you send an email.\nI have reset the NVRAM and repaired the disk using Disk Utility. I also went into Terminal and ran sudo killall coreaudiod but that didn't work either.\nWhen I turn on the laptop it doesn't make a startup chime like it normally would. My headphone jack does not have a red light in it and it shows I have no audio output or input.\n\nA: Devon, I did some investigating on the apple support site and found this. \n\n1) Delete both files in YourHardDrive->Library->Preferences->Audio -> (both .plist files in this folder)\ncom.apple.audio.DeviceSettings.plist \ncom.apple.audio.SystemSettings.plist \n\n2) Make sure to empty your trash. \n\n3) Reboot \n\nLet us know if this works! \n\nApple Support Reference: https://discussions.apple.com/message/23538716#23538716\n\nA: I had precisely this problem with a MacBook Air. The Air was propped on its side and dropped onto the floor. Afterwards the sounds controls were greyed out.\nThe problem is that the cable between the sound card and the motherboard had loosened. I opened up the laptop, removed the cable and re-attached it. The problem went away.\n", "Q: Gap at the bottom of maximized windows How can i get rid of the gap at the bottom of the screen when i maximized a window? The gap is almost imperceptible but at the bottom of a maximized window a few pixel are not filled, there one can see the desktop. If i go into full screen mode with a window, the 5 - 10 pixels get filled.\nMy os version is OS X 10.9 Mavericks\n\nTo better see the issue I enlarged the part at the bottom:\n\n\nA: Those 5 pixels are tied to the Dock. You can position the dock on either the left of right side instead, but the gap stays on the side of the Dock. I think this is something fairly low level with the Dock, as window managers (like Spectacle) will maximize windows and not use the gap.\nMy $0.02: If you have a lot of screen real estate, as it looks like you do, I say shrink some of your windows to a more appropriate size and/or fullscreen windows instead of maximizing them.\n\nA: Drag the entire window down until it covers up the gap. Then resize the window at the top to cover the gap left at the top of the screen. Then you have no gaps.\n\nA: I've come across a few ways to work around or completely fix this:\n1) Minimize the effects with the following settings under System Preferences > Dock:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automatically hide and show the Dock\n\n*Position on screen: Right (or left)\n\n\nIf you want to achieve that with a script instead, it'd be:\n\n\n*\n\n*defaults write com.apple.dock autohide -bool true\n\n*defaults write com.apple.Dock orientation -string right\nThis makes the windows on my primary monitor truly maximized when I alt+shift+click the green window button. The windows on my secondary monitor still have the gap, but it's much less noticeable on the side of the window than the bottom, and I don't look at that monitor as often as my primary one anyway.\n2) Override the Dock's gap completely with BetterTouchTool or BetterSnapTool. I haven't tried this personally, but I've read several sites saying that they fix this problem (for example).\n\nA: Either change your desktop wallpaper to black, so you don't notice it; or add a black 5px line to the bottom of your preferred wallpaper.\n\nA: I actually hacked the system... based on some of the other answers.\nYou can temporarily move the docker on the left, expand your window, and then move the docker back to the bottom. The window stays then. \nAlso note that Chrome is not affected at all by this nasty \"bug\". In my case, only Emacs is.\nEDIT: For crying out loud; when you ALT-TAB the effect is gone.\n\nA: You may use a program like GeekTool or Übersicht to add a black bar to the bottom of the screen. In this way you can essentially make the gap less visible, especially if your wallpaper stands out.\n\nA: I made an AppleScript to achieve this. Unfortunately, after invoking the AppleScript, you'll notice that there is a gap between the menu bar and the window – you need to manually resize the window upwards to remove it (do not double click it, or else the dock gap will come back). However, after these two steps, there will be no dock gap – just as you had wanted.\non run\n\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        set FrontMostApp to name of first item of (processes whose frontmost is true)\n    end tell\n\n    tell application FrontMostApp\n        activate\n        set bounds of front window to {0, 26, 1280, 800}\n    end tell\n\nend run\n\nOne other thing – this is made for 13\" MacBooks with a base screen resolution of 1280x800. You may need to change those bounds according to the model of your Mac. \nImportant: please use your own resolution if your resolution isn't an integer multiple of 1280x800.\n", "Q: Lyrics for any iOS music? There are loads of iOS apps for song lyrics, but it seems that they all make me play music in THAT app if I want to see the lyrics.\nBut almost any iOS music app lets me see the artist and song title in Control Center/Lock Screen.  So why can't there be an app that just looks at that info and automatically searches the web for the lyrics using the given artist and title? There are of course several open lyrics search engines on the web usable via API.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there an app that does this?\n\n*If not, is it technically possible in iOS for an app to read the currently playing artist and title?\n\n\nA: Any app that plays songs from the device library can read song title, artist, album and a lot more, this is included in the Apple Framework.\nLyrics can be read as well, so long as they are included in the meta data of the song file. Most songs don't include this information, so the lyrics meta data is empty.\nIf you subscribe to Apple Music, it will load lyrics for songs you have purchased.  An app called Get Lyrical can also look up and install lyrics.  Finally, you can type or paste them yourself in the Get Info window.\nThe only other way to get the lyrics is to load a separate file such as an .lrc  This is why apps that show lyrics require you to play the song in them, because they have written some code to display .lrc file contents, or the meta data if available. .lrc files can also contain time data so can sync the playback to the lyrics, meta data does not normally do this.\n", "Q: AppleWorks to FileMaker I have been using AppleWorks -- and think very highly of it.  However, I also know that I need to move on.  Is FileMaker the most similar piece of software?  Can I transfer files from AppleWorks to FileMaker -- or do I need to start from scratch?\n\nA: Filemaker is only a database app, and a pretty hefty one at that. So it will only take the place of one of AppleWorks' modules.\nDo you use the drawing and writing component too? There are a number of apps that will open these files but it will depend on your needs. A search on MacInTouch.com for appleworks should turn up a whole bunch of helpful information on converting your files and replacement programs. It is not strictly a forum like Stack Exchange but you can ask relevant questions, but they are heavily moderated.\n", "Q: External Storage Options for MBP non-retina My system specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*late 2011 13 non-retina\n\n*thunderbolt (1?)\n\n*optical drive\n\n*usb 2\n\n*sdxc @ 2.5 gt/s\n\n*firewire 800\n\n*128gb ssd\n\n\nI am wrestling with a few options since I don't have USB3.0:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB 3 drive running at usb 2 speed\n\n*Firewire 800 drive\n\n*A few SDXC cards\n\n\nI am also considering for the long term:\n\n\n*\n\n*Thunderbolt to USB3 adapter to usb 3 drive (not ideal since I can't\nuse my TB to dvi anymore)\n\n*Thunderbolt dock (would consider this heavily if it allows me to run\n2 external monitors, but I am still not sure if this is possible)\n\n*Thunderbolt drive (expensive)\n\n*Replace optical drive with SSD or HDD (expensive)\n\n\nI am looking for a solution with less wires and as quick as possible. I am not sure how the transfer rate of the SDXC stacks up to firewire800 and usb 2, but I appreciate the lack of wires. I can get a firewire drive or usb 3 drive pretty cheap locally (obv the usb3 drive would run at usb2 speed but would be more compatible in the future). I am planning to use this for movies, music, dev project backups.\nThe Thunderbolt dock is interesting to me since it claims you can run an external TB display from it, 3 usb3 slots, AND an external hdmi monitor but it states \"Yes, the Thunderbolt Station can support two monitors if one of them is an Apple Thunderbolt Display\". If it can support a non-apple thunderbolt display then I would be more interested since were talking about a lot of cash for this setup, still waiting for them to get back to me.\nThe TB drive isn't really an option if it can't support the daisy chain either, so also looking at a very pricey setup that way.\nIt seems like replacing the optical drive with a non-ssd is also bad practice since it will increase battery load? And it doesn't really seem worth it to spend so much to add another low capacity ssd?\nI am thinking the best options are either the firewire drive (the one I'm considering requires external power), or just picking up some SDXC cards.\nAnyways, I apologize for the novel, would really like hear any opinions or experiences with this. Thankee-sai!\n\nA: Replacing your optical drive would seem a logic choice to me. No wires, fast transfer speeds and you have your disk always with you. If storage is your main concert, just go for an HD (And replace your SSD with a bigger one while you are at it...)\nIt is not expensive at all. You need a philips screwdriver, a hard drive enclosure kit specially made to fit the Unibody MacBook Pro, and a new hard drive. This enclosure holds the drive that fits into the MacBook Pro’s optical drive slot and costs about $40. \nBuy it here: iFixit, MaxUpgrades, MacSales or OptiBay\n", "Q: How can I configure iCloud mail in Mozilla Thunderbird? i just downloaded Thunderbird from Mozilla because it's the only program I can use to access my hosting email addresses in a easy way, but when I try to add my iCloud account, I get an error.\nHere's how I'm trying to configure it (sorry for the Spanish).\n\n\nA: These settings work for me, see also https://support.apple.com/HT202304.\nIncoming\n\n*\n\n*Protocol: IMAP\n\n*Server: imap.mail.me.com\n\n*Port: 993\n\n*SSL: SSL/TLS\n\n*Authentication: Normal password\n\nOutgoing\n\n*\n\n*Protocol: SMTP\n\n*Server: smtp.mail.me.com\n\n*Port: 587\n\n*SSL: STARTTLS\n\n*Authentication: Normal password\n\nUsername for both should just be your actual username \"karlo_lopez\", not your whole email address.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE:\nIf your Apple ID is protected with two-factor authentication, then you need to setup an app-specific password within your Apple ID account.

Is 10.8 currently (as of 2014 Aug) fully supported, especially security-wise, or using it might be a security risk?\n\nA: Not particularly at any grave security risk since Apple is supporting and releasing security updates to OS X for n-3 generations of the OS as of August 2014:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mavericks (10.9)\n\n*Mountain Lion (10.8)\n\n*Lion (10.7)\n\n*Snow Leopard (10.6)\n\n\nThis is documented on the main support page at http://www.apple.com/support/osx/\nI haven't seen any time when n-2 were not supported on OS X so unless you depend on enhancements to Gatekeeper or the more advanced security features that are new on 10.9 such ad Application Layer VPN, Sandboxed Plug-ins, Additional sandboxed Apple Apps, OTA certificate revocation to make up your definition of risky to stay on 10.8 then you should be equivalently secured on 10.8 for the foreseeable near future.\n", "Q: Will Time Machine backup of an encrypted HDD be encrypted? My MacBook is running Mac OS X Mavericks with FileVault HDD encryption. I use Time Machine to backup this drive to an unencrypted USB HDD.\nWill this backup be encrypted? Or does Time Machine decrypt files from my internal HDD and save them in an unencrypted form on the USB HDD?\n\nA: No - Time Machine will not preserve the encryption of the source disk since it reads the files in an unencrypted manner just like any other process once you log in to the Mac.\nYou would need to ensure that all Time Machine destinations are also encrypted to properly secure your data both on the main computer as well as have it encrypted on the Time Machine volumes. This is as easy as ticking a checkbox on the Time Machine preference pane in system preferences.\nOn macOS 10.12 Time Machine will throw a helpful notification if you do in fact select an unencrypted destination for encrypted OS. \n\nA: Mavericks does encrypt backups. From Apple:\n\nThe best way to keep your backups secure is to encrypt your backup\n  disk. Encryption is available for Time Capsule, disks attached to\n  another Mac on your network, and disks partitioned with the GPT\n  partition scheme and attached directly to your Mac.\nIf you want to change from unencrypted to encypted backups, you must\n  remove your backup disk and then set it up again.\n\nSo, if you have an existing backup, you'll need to remove them from the backup disk you'd like to be encrypted. You should be able to see the encryption status of your backup on a per-volume basis in the Time Machine pref pane. \n", "Q: Can't bind cmd+\\ to \"Move focus to next window\", but I can bind it to other actions... why? I just reinstalled OSX 10.8, and I've encountered an incredibly odd behaviour: binding cmd+\\ to \"Move focus to next window\" doesn't work (if I hit it, I get the \"pop\" error sound). However, binding it to other actions works, and binding other combinations to that action also works.\nThis makes no sense to me.\nI would rather keep using this shortcut, as I'm quite used to it and I hit it often.\nDoes someone have any clue?\nP.S. in case it might help: this did work in my previous 10.8 install.\nUpdate: doesn't work in 10.10 either: I don't get the \"pop\" error sound anymore, but it just does nothing.\n\nA: For what it is worth, I am able to bind ⌘+\\ to Move Focus to Active or Next Window in Mavericks, and it works fine for switching between Finder windows. \n\n(It doesn't help your situation except to indicate that this might be a bug...)\nIf you are trying to use it in another application besides the Finder, does the standard ⌘+` work?\nI have the Full Keyboard Access option below that set to text boxes only:\n\nEDIT: Reassigning ⌘+\\ to \"Move focus to next window\" also works fine for me.\nYou are probably onto something with the backslash causing the problem, since defaults write -globalDomain NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add \"Move focus to next window\" '@\\' gives an error Could not parse: \"@\\\".

So I'm no expert when it comes to advanced internet knowledge and I need to update my Wi-Fi router. We have 14 megabits (I think, no pro at this) or something and I have my room in the floor right underneath it and with our current router it's very slow and I called my internet service and they said I should upgrade my router since it's 5 years old.\nI figured I wanted to check out Apple's AirPort's but they have two versions but I don't know enough about internet and connection speed and so on to know which one I need. Some people say the Express is good to extend the connection strength. While others says it works great as a main router.\nShould I go for the Extreme or Express? There are 2 people connected on the internet every day. Me and my brother.\n\nA: It's an issue of what device you'll be using, how many of them will be connected simultaneously, if you need to stream music, etc. But based on what you said, here are a few suggestions:\nIn general, if you have a new Mac (mid-2013 or later, for most models), it probably takes advantage of 802.11ac, a spec which only the Extreme supports. However, if you want to stream music via AirPlay to speakers connected to your router (especially if your router is in a room you use a lot), and you're willing to give up some power, the Express might be a better choice. Another thing to note is that the Extreme allows for  both the connection of printers and external hard drives, should you wish to perform wireless file transfer/backup, while the Express only supports printers. If you plan on attaching Ethernet cables to your router, you may want the Extreme as it features four Gigabit Ethernet ports, whereas the Express has only two older-spec 10/100BASE-T ports. If you have a bigger house that needs better coverage, perhaps consider the Extreme.\nFor further reference, and a very useful comparison table, see Apple's \"Compare WiFi Models\" Page.\n", "Q: Automount SMB share at specific location Here's my problem, I want to automatically mount a network share at a specific location without the requirement of the user entering any details. The share must be mounted in a user specific folder. Why? I have a QNAP NAS which has a share called home and that share points to a different location depending on the credentials used to access it which means that I get issues if it mounts under /Volumes as every user is mounting a home share. First in best dressed in that case as subsequent user attempts will not mount.\nThe drag drive to login items with credentials in keychain is nice but doesn't allow me to choose the mount location. If I use mount_smbfs from the command line to set it up as desired and then drag the share into the login items it does nothing on login.\nUsing the mount volume applescript command seems of little use as it doesn't allow me to specify the mount point.\nThe only option I could see is to use the auto_smb file examples found on the internet but this involves hardcoding passwords which I am not keen on. In a non-LDAP/AD world is this the best I can hope for to solve this issue?\nA non-boot alternative is to put the mount_smbfs command in a script and execute from the login items.\nIdeas anyone?\n\nA: I've had to do this as well, and I have an Applescript I wrote and cobbled together from working sources to request the user's password and then use mount_smbfs to mount to a specific location (with folders already set up).\nThis prevents stale passwords from quickly locking out the account, and also prevents passwords in the script body.

Now the craziness is that few minutes after usage the mac freezes (screen turns blue, or other colors) and have to off it the hard way. when i turn it back on nothing would show on the screen as in totally black and it makes a continuous beeping sound (actually more than 5). i have to leave the mac for like hours before it would on properly again. and the same scenario restarts.what can be the problem? NEED YOUR HELP PLEASE :( \nPS: i use a macbook pro 2.4GHz intel Core 2 Duo / 4GGb memory. OS Maverick   \n\nA: It is unclear to me but did you replace the keyboard with the defective \"w\" or does the replacement keyboard have the \"w\" issue?\nThe reason being, holding down a key, any key, will cause strange things to happen. An electronic issue with a Mac's (or really any computer's) keyboard can cause all sorts of strange problems.\nCan you disconnect the keyboard and attach an external one (and will that even work?)?\nA Bad battery can cause issues as well. try removing the battery (if possible) and running it on power without the battery in the Mac. That works on a number of older MacBooks/Powerbooks, hopefully it will work on yours.\nAnd once the battery is out reset the SMC as per this Apple KB article http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964\n", "Q: Do ZIP files preserve all HFS+ features, when created using Finder's Compress command? Is it a good idea to backup a directory on a HFS+ filesystem by using the Finder's Compress function, and then copying the ZIP file to a FAT32 hard disc, or to Dropbox, etc? Or might that cause data corruption or data loss?\nFor example, if I compress my iTunes library, and symlinks are replaced by another copy of the file, that's a change in the semantics. If my hard disc crashes, and I restore a copy of the iTunes library from backup, iTunes may not work properly because of this. For example, changing the contents of one file won't affect the other. Deleting the file being pointed to means that you can no longer read the contents of that file via the symlink, which again is different if the symlink is replaced by a copy of that file. iTunes may crash given a corrupt library, or further corrupt the library, which means that the backup failed to serve its purpose.\nIs it guaranteed that all valid directories compress to ZIP without errors, and expand to an identical copy of the original directory, without any loss of information or semantic changes? More specifically, do ZIP files support all HFS+ features?\n\n\n*\n\n*Symlinks\n\n*Hard links (including to directories, which are supported on HFS+)\n\n*Aliases\n\n*Extended attributes\n\n*Resource forks\n\n*ACLs\n\n*Unix permissions\n\n*All valid path names in HFS+. In other words, does ZIP support all characters that are valid to use in a path name? Does ZIP support the longest path name you can create in HFS+, or is there a lower path length limit in the ZIP format?\n\n*Is there a 4GB file size limit?\n\n\n... and so on.\nI'm concerned about the potential for silent changes, which cause silent data loss or corruption without me being aware of it until it's too late.\nThis is a question about the ZIP format, and also about the Finder's Compress command. Because even if the ZIP format supports something, if the Finder's implementation doesn't, it doesn't help.\n\nA: No credit for me. I have literally taken this from user NSGod: https://superuser.com/a/222590\nMy own addition, a bit obvious:\n\n\n*\n\n*the target filesystem should support symlinks, hardlinks, etc, else it will not work\n\n*you can use the zip command in the command line and preserve these filetypes manually with zip --symlinks -r foo.zip foo/\n\nHow are you creating the .zip archive in OS X? (Using a command-line tool, and if so, which one, or by using Archive Utility, etc.)\nWhat operating system is the target computer (where the archive will be unzipped) running, and what method are you using to unzip the file there?\nFirst of all, in OS X, symbolic links are basically plain text files with some extra \"Mac\" information that lets OS X know that it should treat the file as a symbolic link. This extra Mac information is a special file type, creator code, and Finder flag information, which is stored not in the file itself, but in the HFS+ disk directory.\nIn OS X, when you create a .zip file, there is no room in the zip stream for this extra Mac information, so, in a sense, the symbolic link is stored within the zip file as a plain file. Whether someone on another Mac can unzip the archive and have it properly represent the original structure appears to depend on who or what you use to unzip it. \nFor example, a month or so ago a company released a game over Steam, Valve's game distribution software. The game application bundle included NVIDIA's Cg library in the form of a framework, which internally use symbolic links. There was originally a problem with Steam not properly restoring the necessary Mac information on Trine.app as mentioned in this thread:\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1556083\nThe image below shows 2 different copies of the Cg.framework, one I had installed separately from NVIDIA's website (upper image), and the lower image shows what was received with the game:\n\nNotice that all the items match up, but what should be symbolic links are plain data files.\nAfter taking a closer look at the FSCatalogInfo record for both the items, it was clear to me what the issue was:\n\nYou'll notice in the upper image that the beginning of the finderInfo struct has the following values:\n0x736C6E6B = 'slnk'\n0x72686170 = 'rhap'\n\nThese values are defined in /usr/include/hfs/hfs_format.h:\n/*\n *  File type and creator for symbolic links\n*/\nenum {\n    kSymLinkFileType  = 0x736C6E6B, /* 'slnk' */\n    kSymLinkCreator   = 0x72686170  /* 'rhap' */\n};\n\nThe 9th byte value, 0x80, corresponds to the kIsAlias flag of the finderInfo.finderFlags. That value is defined in /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/.../CarbonCore.framework/.../Headers/Finder.h:\nenum {\n    kIsAlias                      = 0x8000 /* Files only */\n};\n\nIt appears that unzip feature built-in to OS X (Archive Utility) is hard-coded to look for possible files in the archive that's being unzipped that represent symbolic links, and to set the information appropriately. I believe that /usr/bin/ditto (when used for its ability to archive files) also takes care of this for you. I'm not sure whether zip or unzip do.\n", "Q: Detecting malware in panic reports Is there a way to identify kernel modules that shouldn't be there out of a panic report? For example, looking at this discussion https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2778885, there it was pretty obvious as \"elmedia\" was easily identifiable. \nHowever, when looking at mine, there are some things which seem fairly common but I don't seem to be able to find any information about them in internet. For example, in my report I have a couple of (suspicious?) national instrument drivers called ni488k. \nI think these logs give a good insight to detecting possible malware. The question is, how can I know which kernel modules should be there and which ones shouldn't? \n\nA: A panic report isn't the right tool to investigate malware.\n\n\n*\n\n*Many crashes are coming from commercial and not evil conceived pieces of software. Some of them are coming from MacOS X directly.\nCrash doesn't mean malware.\n\n*Most of the time you can't reproduce these crashes at will.\n\n*To hide their tracks, most crapware will change their name as soon as activated.\n\n*If the crapware wasn't active at the time of crash, their won't be any usefull information in a crash report.\n\nThe right tools to investigate for malware are :\n\n\n*\n\n*Tools to detect any system abnormal activity:\nActivity Monitor\ntop\nnetstat\nLittle Snitch\nThis command will show any program which might attempt to penetrate your firewall:\ntail -f /var/log/appfirewall.log\n...\n\n*Tools to detect abnormal components of the system:\nkextstat\nthis command searches for all recent setuid bit files:\nfind / -mtime -7 -perm +04000 -ls\ntripwire\nclamav, ClamXav\nchkrootkit\n...\n\nIf finally you think something is suspicious within a panic report,\ntry to investigate it with the above methods on the system alive.\nTo check which modules should be there use kextstat. Save a copy of its output, check another day, check when you install a software asking you for your admin password, check when you notice an abnormal slow down.\n\nA: Short answer is no — you have no guarantee that the malware hasn't removed a seldom-used genuine Apple kernel module and given itself the same name.\nMalware is very good at hiding — often compromised Unix systems (such as OS X) get custom versions of system utilities that won't show the malware (see slides 39-41 here).\n", "Q: Script to delete all User files automatically I'm searching a tool that deletes all personal files of an user account automatically. \nWe have a small network of new Imacs for students and they save all kind of stuff on the harddrive. \nSo we want to delete all that crap on a reboot. \nWe could maybe even delete the student account and create a new one automatically.\nIs there a tool or script to do that for OSX 10.9.4?\n\nA: Deep Freeze sounds like what you might need, restore the machine to any given state at reboot - http://www.faronics.com/products/deep-freeze/\n\nA: You could make a LaunchDaemon that runs each time the system is booted.\nExample script (from another question):\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor user in $( ls /Users ); do\n if [[ \"$user\" != \"<someadmin>\" || \"$user\" != \"<someotheradmin>\" ]]; then \n  rm -rf \"/Users/$user\"\n fi\ndone\n\nIf you merely use the example script above and call it from a LaunchDaemon, it will erase the users' data (except for \"someadmin\" and \"someotheradmin\") each time OS X starts up, but their account will still be on the system.  This means that the students could still log in, but their home folder would be recreated each time they logged in.\nTo remove users from OS X's directory (either local accounts or mobile accounts from a networked directory), use dscl:  dscl . -delete \"/Users/$user\".  Add that line right after the rm -rf.  Depending on your directory, more investigation might be necessary. :)\n", "Q: Why does pmset -g return sleep 1 When running pmset -g, the sleep value (putting the system to sleep) is set to 1 (sleep prevented by coreaudiod)\n\n\n*\n\n*I have set my screen saver to show after 10 minutes of inactivity.\n\n*I then set my display to shutoff after 20 minutes.\n\n*I then modified the disksleep value to 20 minutes as well.\n\n\nAt this point, I noticed that I get this \"warning\":\n\nWarning: Idle sleep timings for \"AC Power\" may not behave as expected.\n  - Display sleep should have a lower timeout than system sleep.\n\nThis is because my displaysleep is 20 and my sleep is 1. Can this be explained, why is system sleep set to 1, what does this really mean?\n\nA: Per the pmset man page:\n\nsleep - system sleep timer (value in minutes, or 0 to disable)\n\nSo, your computer (Mac Pro, I'm assuming by the question tag) is set to sleep the system after one minute, but other sleep functions that depend on the system (putting the display to sleep, putting the disk to sleep, etc.) are set to run after the system is supposed to sleep.  How can the screensaver start after 10 minutes if the entire system is already sleeping after 1 minute??? :D\nTo change this, you can run sudo pmset sleep <number of minutes>.  So, to set the system sleep value to zero minutes (turning off sleep) on my own system, I run sudo pmset sleep 0.  If you want to do it through the GUI, you go to System Preferences > Energy Saver, and toggle the \"Computer Sleep\" value.\n\nA: I had a similar question on my MBA 10.11.6. System sleep = 1 min for batt and AC although display sleep set at 2 min, 15 min, respectively. Didn't understand how system sleep could be < display sleep time. I found an explanation here.\nA quote:\n\nThe System Information app shows that the Air’s system sleep time has been pre-set to just one minute. This doesn’t mean your machine will go into hibernation after that period, rather that’s when it tells Haswell to doze off...\n...Looking at the machine, with its display still active, you’d never know; start clicking on anything and the CPU wakes up. If there’s any lag while it does so, it’s not detectable by a human being: your typing, say, is there as soon as you hit the keys. Pause to reflect on what you’ve just written, however, and after a minute, back to sleep goes Haswell...\n\nThis was written about 2013 MBA but seems to apply here. I got rid of system sleep=1 by changing Energy Saver pane settings and setting them back again (unchecked then re-checked Prevent computer from sleeping when display is off for AC power). Of course there is also pmset.\n", "Q: Is Windows 8.1 compatible with Apple MacBook Air MD711HN/A? I'm planning to buy Apple MacBook Air MD711HN/A.

But I tried all possible ways, free space always merged to same partition, not to Macintosh HD.\n\n\nA: This requires the three partitions between the selected one and the intended one to be moved. Disk Utility can't do this without destructively destroying and recreating the partitions in the intended location, removing all data from the partitions. You will need third-party software such as iPartition. For more information, see Partitioning Software.\n\nA: Thanks for the suggestions and answers. As you all suggested there is no way to do this using disk utility, Seems need to have some 3rd party software.\nOnly way to achieve something similar to above using Disk Utility is: \nAccording to image attached above, I had to move all data from \"Software\" partition to somewhere else and delete \"Software\" partition and merge free space to \"Macintosh HD\"\n", "Q: Suppress Java warnings I'm using a website with a Java plugin (applet I think) that prompts me everytime I use it to access the local file system.\nThese are the two pop ups: \n\nand: \n\nI already have the site in question set up as a security exception in my Java settings\nThis is on Mac OSX 10.9.4 with Firefox 31.\nIs there any way to suppress these popups permanently?

A date and time is incomplete without a location. How do I tell the iOS Calendar app where my event occurs, especially if the event does not have a street address that is resolvable by Apple Maps?\nMore detail: Right now I am physically located in Amsterdam, but I want to add some Burning Man events to my calendar. There are two levels of location at play here: the \"street address\" of the event within Black Rock City (say, \"Yurtopia, 9:30 & E\") and the location (hence timezone) of Black Rock City itself (somewhere in the northern Nevada desert.)\nWhat combination of Calendar settings, location field entry and anything else can I make while in Amsterdam that will remind me at half-past midday on Wednesday the 27th of August 2014, for the entry \"Hexayurt Happy Hour, 1-4pm, Yurtopia, 9:30 & E, Black Rock City, Nevada\", when I'm actually in Black Rock City?\n\nA: I think this is how to do it.\nFirst thing to do is enable time zone support within Calendar. Open Settings, select \"Mail, Contacts and Calendars\". Find \"Time Zone Support\" under Calendars and turn it on. It should automatically set the timezone to your current location, that's fine.\nThen create your event in Calendar. The only important fields for scheduling the event correctly are the time and the timezone. Location for example doesn't affect it. Just enter the correct time (13:00 - 16:00) and set the timezone to a nearby city iOS will recognise like Las Vegas. Once you click Done you should see the event in your calendar with the time automatically converted to the time in your current time zone.\nThen once you are in the US you need to remember to manually set the Calendar timezone under \"Mail, Contacts and Calendars\" to Las Vegas or another city in the Pacific Standard Time timezone.\nThen your events should appear with the correct time.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro (Early 2011) to 2560x1440 monitor?

I'm asking because he had said he was able to read my messages if he wanted to but I would be notified \n\nA: There is no feature to allow someone to sign in to a second Apple ID, so unless he guessed your new Apple ID and new password, he's not receiving your messages.\nYou could enable two factor authentication to ensure no one easily signs in as you. There are forensic and legal ways to read people's messages - but they are generally complicated or costly.\nMost of this is explained at https://appleid.apple.com and if there is something specific you don't get - you can ask a new question more narrowly focusing on one aspect of privacy since the site works best with one question per question.\nIn summary, unless your husband (or ex) has installed key logging software on a computer, you should be able to prevent them from receiving any messages for you by changing your Apple ID password and making sure the phone company has a separate account for your devices.\n\nA: Yes, if he had your AppleID and password, and tried to log into iMessage with it, your phone will pop up with a notification that says that a new device has connected to your imessage.

You can provide feedback to Apple at apple.com/feedback.\n\nA: If you use backup software such as Time Machine, you may be able to access your Notes.app history/older versions of your notes by restoring the 3 .sqlite files in:\n~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.notes/\n\nRestore Process\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit Notes.app\n\n*Restore those 3 files to the date of the version of the notes you're trying to get\n\n*If you use iCloud, make sure you disconnect from your internet so the notes aren't synced from iCloud when you re-open Notes.app\n\n*Re-open Notes.app\n\n\nSource for notes database location\nRecover Notes from TimeMachine\n\nA: I accidentally deleted content from a note and Undo was unavailable.\nTo resolve, I put a different Apple device in Airplane Mode as quickly as possible, then opened the note from there - which didn't have time to update and therefore was still showing the version I wanted.\nGood luck!\n\nA: My notes was not syncing with Exchange, and I unchecked 'Notes' in Internet Accounts and then check it back. When I did that, Notes resynchronised from the last synchronised version and so I lost a whole lot of Notes. My Time Machine was not turned on, but I managed to find another way:\n\n\n*\n\n*/Users//Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library\n\n*Make a copy of NotesV7.storedata-wal with .html extension, like NotesV7.storedata-wal copy.html\n\n*Open in any web browser and you will see past notes - this is limited to the last saved version of NotesV7.storedata-wal, so make sure you get to here fast (as soon as you discover your Notes' been overwritten.\n\n\nA: If you have a Time Machine Backup, this worked for me - based on the answer from @rsheyd here.\nFind this folder:\n~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.notes\n\nThen\n\n*\n\n*Quit Notes\n\n*Turn off WiFi (any network, so syncing is off)\n\n*Rename folder example to ~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.notes_disabled\n\n*Replace folder with time machine backup of folder\n\n*Open Notes - now you can see the old notes - get the one you need, copy it somewhere safe\n\n*Quit Notes\n\n*Delete the old folder, rename the original back to what it was\n\nDone.\n\nA: See history for shared notes with Show Note Activity\nSome time between the accepted 2014 answer and now, Apple introduced View → Show Note Activity as part of their collaboration features. When you select a history item in Note Activity, it highlights changes associated with that edit.\n\nWhile you can't restore a version with a single click, this feature gives what you need to identity and manually redress small, unwanted changes. This isn't a full solution, but it's much better than nothing in some situations.\n", "Q: Microsoft Remote Desktop Client Configuration If this should be posted in networking stack overflow please let me know, and sorry if this is not the correct place. I'll delete the question if it's inappropriate.\nI have a desktop (windows/linux) that I need to be able to access from my macbook. It is directly connected to my router via ethernet. What information do I need to connect from outside the network? From within my own network I can connect using 10.0.1.9 as the IP address. How do I specify which device on my network I should be connecting to- as using just the public IP address is not enough. Is it a port or is there a gateway I have to configure?\n\nA: Basically you have to enable port forwarding. Most routers do that, even ones provided by the cable companies.\nBriefly the computer you want to get to needs a static IP address (or a DHCP one that doesn't change) within your network. If it stays at 10.0.1.9 that is fine. Then on your router forward any RDP (Windows) requests on port 3389 to the IP address of your computer (10.0.1.9).\nWhile you are in the router doing all the port-forwarding, get the WAN IP address of the router. That is what you will plug into your RDP or VNC clicent when connecting remotely. Note that that WAN IP address is DHCP and depending on your ISP may change at a moments notice. In practice my external IP almost never changed (TWC, Comcast, U-Verse)... YMMV\nWith Linux you will need to install and configure VNC and forward the VNC port numbers (5800 and 5900) to that computer. Apple's remote desktop is actually VNC but you might have better results with a dedicated VNC client.\nMicrosoft has an article about just this here\n", "Q: Apt-get install tomcat7 I am currently running Mavericks. I have a Drupal7 Virtual Machine running (on VirtualBox). I am trying to install a tomcat7 server onto the VM. I have used the Terminal to SSH and login to my Drupal7 VM but cannot seem to install tomcat7. I am aware that on Windows you use the command: apt-get install tomcat7, however this doesn't work on Mac. \nI have tried to use Homebrew, but it doesn't seem to install on the VM through the terminal command.\nDoes anyone have any advice?\nThanks!\n\nA: To install Apache Tomcat on Debian, follow the instructions provided by Digital Ocean: How To Install and Configure Apache Tomcat on a Debian Server.\nThe two steps are:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install tomcat7\n\nInstalling Tomcat on your virtual machine does not require Mac OS X specific commands. Your installation is taking place within the virtual machine and all the commands should be Debian specific.\n", "Q: How can I keep notification center enabled, even when I'm in a full-screen app? I'm running 10.9.4 on a MacBook Air, and when I enter composition mode in Scrivener (which is a full-screen mode) I find that the Mac Notification Center is completely disabled. Any alerts I receive will make no sound and I can't see the little windows. If I switch away from Scrivener to another app, then the alerts are visible, but any banners have already come and gone, so I never see them.\nIs there any way to change this behavior? I would like Notification Center to stay active even when I'm in this full-screen app.\nThanks!\n\nA: I found an imperfect solution: apparently applications that use their own full-screen mode (an older API maybe?) and not the OSX full-screen mode, disable the Notification Center while they're in full-screen. Scrivener's composition mode does this, as does Word 2011.\nA solution that worked for me in Scrivener was to go into regular full-screen mode (View->Enter Full Screen), which uses the OSX full-screen API, creating its own Space for Scrivener, putting the blue full-screen icon on the right-hand side of the menubar, and leaving Notification Center intact.\nIf I then go into composition mode (View->Enter Composition Mode), all is well and Notification Center works.\nNote, this doesn't work in Word, because in its infinite wisdom, it kicks itself out of OSX fullscreen mode, ditching its Space, before it enters composition mode. So I still don't know how to receive notifications while composing in Word, but maybe that's just another reason not to use Word.\nThanks to njboot for the screenshot showing it was possible to get notifications in Scrivener composition mode!\n", "Q: Devices with different Apple IDs responding to the same FaceTime calls This is really weird. Whenever my sister-in-law calls my wife via FaceTime, my phone and Mac also ring at the same time. When my wife answers the call, then both of my devices stop ringing.\nIt's exactly as if all three devices were using the same Apple ID for FaceTime, but they're not, and they never have. My wife's phone is signed into her iCloud account and uses her phone number and email address for FaceTime; likewise, my phone and Mac are signed into my iCloud account and use my phone number and email address.\nFurthermore, this only happens when my sister-in-law calls, not anyone else.\nWhy does this happen, and how can I prevent it? The only thing I can think of is that maybe my sister-in-law has both my wife's phone number and my phone number in the same contact card, so when she starts a FaceTime call, it goes out to both our numbers (and my Mac by extension)?\n\nA: Yes - this technology seems to be driven by your contact card info stored by calling party. If calling party has info for you and someone else in same contact card, then both phones will ring for FaceTime even if not same Apple ID. \nIn our case, we had friend who had stored my number and husband's number (not email) under my contact card. Both our phones would ring when friend tried to FaceTime me, even though husband and I have separate Apple IDs and caller never selected the other number. \nSolved it by having calling friend remove the additional phone number from my contact card on his machine. \n\nA: She has more than one email associated with your contact info.\nGet her to remove the one that is not commonly used. \n\nA: based on the information that I've read from the Apple forums, go into settings>facetime> and turn your iphone cellular calls off. Do this on both devices,  this should stop the calls from going to both devices.\n", "Q: Problem running rst2html from command line all. Long-time lurker, etc.\nI use MacPorts to manage my Python installation, and it has worked flawlessly until ... until this moment. And I am completely flummoxed. \nI am trying to teach myself ReStructured Text, and so, trusting in the power of MacPorts, I did the usual:\nsudo port install py27-docutils\n\nIf I use locate to make sure rst2html.py is there, it is:\n/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/rst2html.py\n\nI cannot, as the documentation suggests, use rst2html.py at the command line:\n% rst2html.py --version\n-bash: rst2html.py: command not found\n\nI have my .bash_profile set as per MacPorts' instructions:\n# MacPorts \nexport PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH\n\n# Python\nexport PYTHONPATH=/opt/local/bin/python2.7\n\nAnd I have also used python_select, so that when you run which python you get:\n/opt/local/bin/python\n\nHere's what my path environment looks like:\n% more /etc/paths\n/usr/bin\n/bin\n/usr/sbin\n/sbin\n/usr/local/bin\n/opt/local/Library\n\nAll I want to be able to do is to be able to type rst2html.py, or one of the allied standalone commands (e.g., rst2pdf.py) at the command line, wherever I am and have it run. I'm having the same command with sphinx -- e.g., sphinx-quickstart is not working for me -- and I'm hopeful that the solution to this problem will be the solution to others.\n\nA: Try port contents py27-docutils | grep rst2html. It will tell you there's a /opt/local/bin/rst2html-2.7.py file, i.e. you can run rst2html-2.7.py on your command line.\nThe additional -2.7 in this filename is necessary to avoid conflicts between the different py*-docutils packages for different versions of python, e.g. if you want both the 2.7 and the 3.4 version installed. Of course you can create a symlink so you can use rst2html.py as usual:\nsudo ln -s rst2html-2.7.py /opt/local/bin/rst2html.py\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to get Mavericks to mount AFP URLs the old way, by mounting the share point, and not the enclosing folder? Before Mavericks, if I clicked this URL or pasted it into the Finder's Connect to Server dialog:\nafp://server.example.com/Share/Path/To/Folder/File.txt\nThe server's \"Share\" share point would mount as a volume, and the Finder would open a window navigated to \"Folder\", with \"File.txt\" selected. We used this methodology to share file server URLs around the office all of the time.\nAfter we installed Mavericks on the clients (keeping 10.8.x on the OS X Server), whenever a client uses such a URL to locate file, a new volume mounts, named after the enclosing folder, meaning a mount point names \"Folder\" mounts.\nUnfortunately, this means for every URL referencing a different directory, new mount points and server connections are made.\nSome have reported the issue and it's been declared as working as designed, but Apple hinted that there is now an option being set that changes this, but unfortunately not supplying how to change that option.\nHas anyone by chance figured out a way?\n\nA: I haven't found a way to configure Finder to behave the old way, so I wrote an Apple Script to mimic the old behavior. The script handles AFP URLs (as well as FTP and CIFS/SMB if you like), mounts the server under the share name and opens a Finder window at the indicated location.\nYou can set your browser and maybe other programs to open AFP URLs with this script. I don't know if you can convince the Finder though.\nBasically the script decomposes the URL into protocol, server name, share name, path and target. It does some basic checks on the URL, mounts the resource under the share name and shows it in Finder.\nI bundled it as an application, called URL Handler. You can download and try it out, whether it works for you. The source is included in the disk image, if you want to have a closer look.\n", "Q: Create a PDF with a custom page size? (Mavericks) I'm trying to create a PDF with a custom page size.  Basically, I'm converting a set of JPEGs which are exactly 5:4 dimensions into a single PDF, so I wanted to set the paper size to 8x10, so as not to have \"letterbox-type\" borders on the top and bottom of the PDF pages. The purpose is for viewing on-screen, not for printing, and these are personal documents which I am not sharing, so there is no need to worry about printability.\nI'm using a consumer-grade HP LaserJet printer (P1102W), whose driver apparently \"does not support\" custom paper sizes. This is evidenced by the fact that I am unable to choose the option to \"manage custom sizes\" in the paper size list - it is grayed out.\nResearching around the Internet seems to reveal that only certain drivers actually will let you configure a custom page size. To experiment, in TextEdit (which does have the Page Setup option), I was able to configure a custom page size. However, Preview does not have a Page Setup option. I've also seen screenshots where certain HP drivers do enable this option, but I obviously don't know which ones, nor do I have the corresponding printer or driver on my system.\nI tried installing a generic PostScript printer driver by entering a nonexistent IP into the network printer settings, but even then I was unable to set the custom page size.\nIs there any solution I can use to accomplish this? Remember, the goal is to produce a PDF file with a custom page size to eliminate borders, and that PDF will never need to be printed. It seems silly to be limited by the printer driver when the goal is to produce a generic PDF...\nThanks!\nEDIT: Ghostscript may be able to do this, but there's something wrong with either my installation or with the Ghostscript that Homebrew installed.\nI created a PDF with Preview that had borders, and am now trying to use GS to change the page size. Here's the result:\nMac-mini:~ fmillion$ gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dDEVICEWIDTHPOINTS=612 -dDEVICEHEIGHTPOINTS=720 -dFIXEDMEDIA -c \"<</PageOffset [0 36]>> setpagedevice\" -o test1.pdf test.pdf \nGPL Ghostscript 9.14 (2014-03-26)\nCopyright (C) 2014 Artifex Software, Inc.  All rights reserved.\nThis software comes with NO WARRANTY: see the file PUBLIC for details.\n**** Unable to open the initial device, quitting.\n\nIf I do not include the \"-c\" option along with its parameter, the operation succeeds, but I end up with a page with a half inch at the bottom and the top half inch of the page cut off. The idea of the PageOffset command was to shift the entire page down by 36 points, thus eliminating the bottom border.\nI'm using the Ghostscript provided by Homebrew, simply installed with \"brew install ghostscript\".\n\nA: It is possible to convert images to PDFs without 'placing them on a default page', so that each page will be whatever size the image is.\nThere is a collection of python scripts and Automator Actions here, which include one to batch convert images to PDF in that way.\nhttps://github.com/benwiggy/PDFsuite\n\nA: One possibility would not care about the borders, and then crop the pages accordingly (for example in Acrobat; I am not sure whether Preview.app can crop, but worth a try).\n\nA: I had no problem at all setting a custom page size in preview using the Paper Size command in the print dialog. Just set the size and then use the pull down menu on the bottom left to open the PDF in Preview at the custom size.\n\nA: Though this question is quite old, I still had this same problem on High Sierra and found a solution that worked for me.\nSince the custom size availability is apparently controlled by the printer drivers, and buying a new printer was out of the question for me, I simply downloaded \"Additional Tools for Xcode 10\" from Apple's developer site. \n*Please note that you will need a developer id (which uses your apple id) to download these tools. You can get one for free at their site.\nThis toolkit contains an app called \"Printer Simulator\", Launch it and you will now see new printers available in Preview:\n\nSelect one and then you will have custom sizes available again.\n", "Q: How to upgrade Macbook Air 2014 SSD? I have a Macbook Air 2014 - 128 GB, and I am running out of space.  Is it possible to upgrade the SSD to one of bigger capacity?  \n\nA: In some Macbook Airs the SSD is actually replaceable. Please refer to iFixit.com and the other answers for details. \nHowever, a very interesting option is to make use of the SD card slot. There are a number of products out there that will fit seamlessly into your SD card reader slot. You can then mount it as an additional drive and put e.g. your music library onto it. Some examples (feel free to update):\n\n\n*\n\n*Transcend Jetdrive Lite\n\n*PNY StorEDGE\n\n*Nifty MiniDrive\n\n*Sandisk miniDrive\nUsing one of these solutions you could add up to 256 GB (2015) of storage to your Mac.\n\nA: It is 'possible'. However, you will have more trouble in finding a compatible and legitimate after-market PCI-e based SSD than you will actually replacing the current one. The only ones iFixit sells are used-genuine Apple OEM refurbished. \nAccording to EveryMac:\n\nAs first reported by AnandTech, the \"Mid-2013\" MacBook Air models all use a PCIe-based SSD rather than a SATA-connected one like earlier SSD-equipped MacBook Air models. The \"Early 2014\" MacBook Air models are practically identical to their predecessors and use the exact same internal storage. \nMore specifically, AnandTech shared that the SSD in these lines use a\n  custom Apple design with a \"PCIe 2.0 x2 interface, capable of a\n  theoretical maximum of 1 GB/s in each direction. At the moment,\n  compatible SSDs are few and far between, so installation instructions\n  effectively are theoretical.\"\n\nThe last sentence is the crux of the matter.\nEssentially, not currently, but quite feasible in the future. The guides are all provided, it's just a matter of the hardware hitting the market. \n\nA: There are no compatible third party upgrade solutions in the market as of the date of today, 16 August 2015. The only way is to buy from Apple or from companies like https://ifixit.com who sell refurbished Apple SSD storage. \n\nA: The SSD drive in a MacBook Air is a custom PCI Express drive. A new 256GB drive will cost about $450,-.\nYou can order a drive and find installation instructions on iFixit\nAs Buscar says, warranty is gone when you open your machine.

I quickly activated lost mode in find my iPhone. I worried that the thief managed to restore factory setting before I do that. The thing is before I put lost mode, I disable the 3G dataplan following a stupid advice from my families.\nThat means my iPhone will never know that it should turn on its kill switch because it will never connect to the internet. What about if the thief restore to factory setting before connecting to the internet?\nfind my iphone is ALWAYS ON. I never turned that off. I am concerned that the thief just turn of the iPhone, never access internet and then restore factory setting before I turn on lost mode.\nMy wish is for the phone to be returned and the thief to get the thief to jail. I am willing to pay the price of the iPhone for that to happen.\n\nA: To restore a device using iTunes, iTunes itself requires an internet connection. Furthermore, the status of Find My iPhone is obtained from the device as well as Apple's servers—iTunes knows if the device you're attempting to restore has Find My iPhone enabled and will prevent the device from being restored. The only way to restore a device with Find My iPhone is to put it in Recovery/DFU mode, but then when the device is finished restoring, Activation Lock will be enabled when the device connects to Apple's servers which is required when setting up the phone.\n\nA: If the thief wants to restore your device on his computer through iTunes, he will plug it in and it will ask him for a password (if you already have a password on the phone). Otherwise, it will require your iCloud password. \n", "Q: \"The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer.\" How do I access info on USB flashdrive? Same message with other computers. Worried that I may have ejected incorrectly. Is there a way to retrieve the information on my USB flashdrive?\n\nA: Since my HD was initialized with a Mac, I was able to use Disk Utility's First Aid functions to first verify and then repair the volume.\n\nA: If you formatted the drive on a Windows computer, there is the possibility that the format is NTFS which is not natively supported on OS X. If this is the case, you can add the read and write functionality to NTFS volumes using this video.\nIf you know that the drive is not NTFS, and were able to previously access it using your Apple computer, I would then recommend seeing if the machine even recognizes it. This can be achieved by using the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Apple icon in the upper left-hand corner of your screen\n\n*Select the \"About This Mac\" option from the menu\n\n*In the box which appears on the screen, select the \"System Report\" button in the \"Overview\" tab. (This will open another window which you can use to find out more in-depth details about your Apple device)\n\n*In the new window which opened (System Information), select USB from the left-hand column under the Hardware category.\n\n*From this point, you can see the USB bus, and all things connected to it, you may need to expand any \"hub\" section here, as it varies per model.

If so, I would suggest trying steps such as these:\n1) Settings --> Messages --> iMessage (cycle it off and then back on)\n2) Log out and back in with your AppleID\n3) Turn the phone off and back on.\nIf the problem is on the MBP, then I would similarly start with Messages-->Preferences and then sign out and back into the iMessage service.\nIf those steps don't help, please characterize the symptoms in more detail.\n", "Q: Apple Magic mouse often loses connection I have mac mini late 2011, up to date mac OS X and fully charged batteries. It still loses connection about 10 times per hour. It's really annoying\nI've tried to remove Bluetooth.plist file, but it didn't help.\nIs it solvable issue?\nI use Wi Fi, and bluetooth apple keyboard.\n\nA: More people have this annoyance. For me the solution was to use slightly fatter/bigger batteries (Duracell for example), or a piece of paper. When I very gently slammed my mouse on the table from a small height, the connection would drop. Probably due to a short disconnection/movement of the batteries.\n\nA: The thing is, you can fix your mouse with just your fingers. Simply remove the back cover and bend it so that ends curve up on the Apple logo side. Then, replace the cover. This is why buying a new mouse can fix the issue: Over time, the back cover starts to bend so that there is more room between it and the batteries.\n\nA: The paper shim trick didn't work for me - it made the cover bulge enough to rub on the table top.  The cover bending suggestion sound risky.  So I combined the two as follows: Start with an 8 cm square of paper.  Fold it in half three times, giving a 4 cm by 2 cm pad with 8 thicknesses of paper.  Remove the cover and position it on top of the paper pad, centered, so it overhangs the pad by 2 cm on each end.  Push down on the two ends until they touch the table.  Replace the cover (without any paper shim) and test.  If necessary, repeat with a pad that has 10 or 12 layers of paper.\n", "Q: How do I make my iPhone ring for phone calls but be silent for email? As a newbie on an iPhone 5, please how do I set up my phone to give an audible ringtone when I get a phone call, but remain silent when I get an email?\n\nA: Open up Settings > Notification Center > Mail, then change the Alert Sound to None.

When adding a printer in OS X, and assuming the printer is AirPrint enabled, which driver should I use: 1. the AirPrint driver or 2. the CUPS driver for that specific printer?\n\nMy assumption is that while AirPrint is easy to use, it also must be generic enough to support a wide range of printers and a limited number of functions. Thus, while I can easily print with the AirPrint driver, I won't have access to all of the printer's functions and would be better off using the CUPS driver for that specific printer if I intend to print from that printer often or need more control over the printing process.\nAnyone have documentation to support/refute my assumptions?\n\nA: Doesn't matter.

I've asked this question to Google enough times. Now I think I'm qualified to ask it to myself.\nIf you've set up Gmail as your default Mail app account and you use two-step verification, then Mail won't work if you haven't properly set up your device (and you might not even know it's not working if you're using the Gmail app as your main mail app until you try to share via email something in another app and realize it never gets sent).\nThere doesn't seem to be a simple user-friendly answer to this problem out there, so after running into this issue and solving it yet again, I figured I'd write out instructions for others to follow.\n\nA: So you've already set up two-step verification in Gmail... \n(If not, now is probably a good time to do so.) \nBut now that you have 2-step enabled, you can't use your old gmail password to sync your iOS Mail app to Gmail. You will have to sign into Gmail on your phone using a special app password which you can find by signing into Google at your two-step settings page:\nhttps://accounts.google.com/SmsAuthConfig\nThen click the \"App-specific passwords\" tab, and then the \"Manage application specific passwords\" button.\nAt this point you may see that you've already set up an app password for your device, but if you've recently reconfigured your two-step settings or activated a new phone, then you'll need to \"Revoke\" access and set up a new app password.\nSet up a new app password for Mail by selecting \"Mail\" on my \"iPhone\" (or other iOS device) in the dropdowns and click \"Generate\".\nNext, follow the directions provided by Google:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Open “Settings” on your iPhone.\n  \n*Select “Mail, Contacts, Calendars”.\n  \n*Select your Google Account from the list of available accounts.\n  \n*Edit your account information and replace your password with the 16-character password shown below.\n  \n\nIt's as easy as that.\n\nA: This helped me alot thanks.

Thanks\n\nA: Mavericks just introduced support for SMB2.\nhttp://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#core\nSMB3 is a planned feature of the next version of OS X, Yosemite.\n\nA: To further this: The SMB2 support in OS X 10.9 is rather buggy. It occasionally completely locks up requiring restart. At work, we've enforced SMB1 only, which can be done either by connecting with the cifs:// protocol, but since this can be hard to enforce for non-technical users, you can also write a preference file to either ~/Library/Preferences/nsmb.conf for a user preference or /etc/nsmb.conf for a system wide preference.\nPut in either of those files the content:\n[default]\nsmb_neg=smb1_only\n\nAnd reboot.

I want to use my son's email for his new iPad mini, but previously his email was associated with my Apple ID on my iPhone 5c as an alternate email address. I have deleted his email from my Apple ID, but I still can't set up his iPad using his own email address.\nI am attempting to create a new Apple ID for him with his email so all my contacts won't come up on his iPad mini. When we try it, it says that the email is already associated with an Apple ID.\n\nA: Yes, you should be able to. Having an email address as a secondary email address on another Apple ID does not mean that the email address does not have an Apple ID already associated with it. Try to regain access to the existing Apple ID associated with the email address at iforgot.apple.com.\n\nA: The email you use for the Apple ID does not have to be the same as the one you actually use for email.\nYou don't need to use your son's existing email as an Apple ID either. You can create a different ID for Apple ID, then initially set his real email as the secondary. This would avoid the issue you are facing. The flow is like this: New disposable email> Register as Apple ID>Real email as secondary> get confirm email from Apple>change real email to primary email.\nYou need to have email access for the email you associate with your Apple ID in the initial on-boarding steps (you have to confirm that you have access to the email account), but there is no requirement that you use that email address after on-boarding.  In the Apple ID configuration panel, you can add additional email addresses, and use those other email addresses as the primary email for contact emails as well as the email you wish to use for things like Messages. This way all emails come to the 'real' email and nothing goes to the 'temporary' email.\nFor example, I have an old hotmail.com email address that I still have access to, but have abandoned due to excessive spam. I use a gmail.com address instead for daily use and as my 'public' facing email. However, my Apple ID is the hotmail.com address, while Messages, and contact emails and notices from Apple are all sent to the gmail.com address as the 'public' address. I simply 'unchecked' the hotmail.com email as one where I want Messages, etc sent. The only time I ever even have to remember this email address is when I type it as my Apple ID.\nA suggestion is to create a secondary email account for your son to use for the on-boarding process, then add his 'real' email to the Apple ID preferences. I would suggest he keep this secondary email but there is no reason to use it. If he has a school email address, this might be a good one to use for the Apple ID, but then his personal email becomes the one that is 'public'.\n", "Q: Safari will not \"Remember Me\" on Facebook My question is very similar to this question:\nSafari 7.0.4 doesn't remember my login status. \"Remember me\" not working (OS X 10.9.3)\nExcept it differs in 3 key ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*The solution did not work for me This occurs ONLY on Facebook.com;\nreddit, twitter, netflix, etc.'s \"remember me\" function works fine.\n\n*The erasure of the cookies does not occur during restart of the\nbrowser.

I know very little about bash scripting or Terminal commands, this is all very new to me so please bear with me.\n\nOriginal script\nI would like to use a script I found on littlefield.info as an automator service. This is the original script:\nfor file in *.flv *.mov *.mp4\n  do mediainfo \"--Inform=Video;%Duration%\" $file\ndone | awk '{total+=$0}END{total=total/1000}END{print strftime(\"%H:%M:%S\",total,1)}'\n\nExplained by the creator:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Cycle through every video file in a folder,\n  \n*Passing it to the mediainfo program to extract the duration in milliseconds,\n  \n*Passing that result to the awk program to add up all the numbers to give us a total,\n  \n*Passing that to awk again to divide that number by 1000 to give the number of seconds,\n  \n*Passing that that to the strftime function to display the result in Hours:Minutes:Seconds format.\n  \n\nModified script\nI installed the mediainfo CLI and started experimenting. Apparently strftime is not available on mac, so I had to look up another way on how to convert the seconds to readable output. I cobbled together the following script (probably horribly inefficient, but hey.. it works):\n# the cd is needed for automator\ncd \"$1\"\n\ni=$(for file in *.flv *.mov *.mp4\n        do mediainfo \"--Inform=Video;%Duration%\" $file\n    done | awk '{total+=$0}END{print total}')\n\n((i/=1000, sec=i%60, i/=60, min=i%60, hrs=i/60))\ntimestamp=$(printf \"%dh%02dm%02ds\" $hrs $min $sec)\necho -e \"Total duration of video files in this folder:\\n\\n$timestamp\" > _total_duration.txt\n\nIt works perfectly fine in Terminal. But running it as a service from Finder gives the following output:\n\nTotal duration of video files in this folder:\n0h00m00s\n\nawk variable problem\nThe duration shouldn't be 0. I started troubleshooting, and reduced the script to the following:\nfor file in *.flv *.mov *.mp4\n    do mediainfo \"--Inform=Video;%Duration%\" $file\ndone | awk '{total+=$0}END{print total}'  > \"test_file_awk.txt\"\n\nThere seems to be a problem with the variable total in AWK. It doesn't output anything when run from Finder but works correctly from Terminal.\nDo you guys have any idea what I'm doing wrong? \n\nA: Let's start with a small example.\nFire up Automator and create a service with a single \"Run Shell Script\" step.\nSet it to take Folders as input from Finder\nPass input as arguments. Shell is /bin/bash\nBash code:\ncd \"$@\"\n\nfor file in *.mov *.flk *.mp4\n    do\n    ls -1 \"$file\" >> ~/Desktop/test_file_awk.txt\ndone\n\nWhat this does it takes the directory you pass in as \"$@\" and goes into it then runs the command on all the files in that directory.\n\"$@\" is in quotes to protect against spaces, as is \"$file\"\nSo, you can replicate this to your setup:\ncd \"$@\"\ni=$(for file in {*.flv,*.mov,*.mp4,*.m4v}\n    do \n    /usr/local/bin/mediainfo \"--Inform=Video;%Duration%\" \"$file\"\ndone | awk '{total+=$0}END{print total}')\n\n((i/=1000, sec=i%60, i/=60, min=i%60, hrs=i/60))\ntimestamp=$(printf \"%dh%02dm%02ds\" $hrs $min $sec)\necho -e \"Total duration of video files in this folder:\\n\\n$timestamp\" > _total_duration.txt\n\nPersonally, I would change the output to something like:\n> ~/Desktop/\"$@\"_total_duration.txt\n\nSo that the data ends up on  your desktop in a file named for the folder, but I have a lot of media directories and I don't want txt files in them.\n", "Q: What could cause Command-Tab task switching to get \"stuck\"? When I Command-Tab to task switch (in both Mavericks and Yosemite), occasionally (maybe 60% of the time) the task switcher will behave as if the Tab button was held down. That is, the task-switcher selection will fly over to the right-most icon.

If your iPhone is locked to a specific provider (if it was bought on a contract, then it almost certainly is locked to that provider), then the easiest thing to do is to get a contract with the same provider.\nIt is sometimes possible to unlock a phone after the initial contract has run out, but you would need to talk to the mobile provider that locked the phone to its network, in order to do that. Unlocking the phone from that network would allow you to use the phone with any compatible network.\n\nA: Your Phone still has the 3G Function/Capability. \nWhen it is disconnected/deactivated means you do not get access to any 3G service providers.\nYou wont be able to receive any 3G services without having a provider.\nThat means the 3G is all around you but your phone can not receive any since it is not recognized on the network, not because it is not capable.\nYour 3G is still ON.\n", "Q: Can I restrict the times during which iTunes downloads podcast content?

I have an external USB disk which is backing up my Mac using Time Machine. I need to reformat the external disk for an unrelated reason.\nIf I:\n\n\n*\n\n*temporarily move the Time Machine files off the external disk\n\n*reformat the external disk, then\n\n*put the TM files back onto the external disk\n\n\nwill Time Machine continue to work? Or will I lose my existing Time Machine archive?\n\nA: You can make an efficient copy of the Time Machine volume by using Disk Utility and making a disk image of the original volume. Store that image on the temporary storage / other drive as a single file. Once you've erased the original drive and partitioned it as you wish, then use Disk Utility to reverse the operation and restore the image to the new partition. That will erase anything on the new partition so do the restore first then add extra files as needed.\nTime Machine will pick up and use the new destination and carry on with backups and cleanup operations assuming no corruption happens during the two copy events.\n\nI would just get a cheap drive and do the first step. Once I've verified that the backup img file mounts and I can restore a sample file to my desktop from Time Machine, I'd just erase the intended drive and start over with backups.\nMuch easier that way and why spend the second half of the work - just archive that Time Machine data offline in case you need it down the road.\n\nA: That should be no problem - see http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5096\nEdit - copy the entire Backups.backupdb folder, reformat the drive as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) with a GUID partition, copy it back.\n", "Q: There is a file named %FF at the root.

I wish I could offer advice but haven't seen or heard of it, but it could be harmless or a problem with some software so checking that it doesn't re-appear might be good in a week.

Putting in a genuine new and aa genuine used battery does the same thing. The screen goes dark, you can still see the screen for a second and then it's asleep.\nTaking the battery out doesn't work after that. To reboot, the battery must come out. ONCE using the old battery that came with it (not the two I've been talking about), it booted up to a gray window with a thermometer bar as if it was waking from sleep. Then it died.\nThis is a fresh install of ML, so it's not software related. I tested both batteries in another macbook and they both are charged up.\n\nA: Had similar problem, so took it to Genius Bar for investigation. Turned out to be the battery charger sensor module, which is built into the battery level indicator on the side of the Macbook (the 5 green light thing). It was malfunctioning, basically telling the Macbook that any battery was dead, even if the battery was good. YMMV.\n", "Q: iPhone blocked on network I got an iPhone as a present from a family member. It was working.\nNow I get \"No service\". I found out it was blocked by Vodafone. They won't unblock it.\nIs there any way I can get it unblocked myself?\n\nA: Phones are only blocked on this level for two causes that I'm aware of:\n\n\n*\n\n*The phone was stolen and the owner reported it stolen\n\n*The phone was subsidized, and the owner stopped paying for it\n\n\nA stolen phone block will generally never be released, though it depends on the carrier. Some carriers may when presented with a police report or other similar paperwork indicating that the property was recovered, or a payment of the outstanding balance on the device.\nThere is no way to unblock it yourself. Blocking basically means that the cellphone network looks for the IMEI of your phone, and if it sees it, refuses to service it. Since IMEIs are generally burned into the phone at a very low level, they are usually not changeable.\nI'd inquire with Vodafone and get more information as to why they blocked the device. If it's stolen, you want to get rid of it, preferably back to its original owner.\nIf its a billing issue, you may be able to pay the amount due to get service restored.\n", "Q: Extract passwords from local items keychain files I know that one can easily migrate any *.keychain from one Mac to another, however, the \"local items\" keychain introduced in Mavericks is not stored as a *.keychain file but as a list of *.kb and *.db files.\nI don't use iCloud Keychain and don't plan on using it. I also don't have access to the same device that was used to create the local items in the first place. The logic board has been changed.\nAs using a backup from time machine only partially restored the local items keychain (a number of entries are definitely missing) I am wondering whether I can in any way or shape extract the previously created items in the local items list and/or import them into a new \"real\" keychain.\n\nA: Backup of Local Items keychain\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new keychain in Keychain Access via File > New Keychain...\n\n*Copy all the entries from Local Items over to this newly created keychain\n\n*Backup the keychain by navigating to ~/Library/Keychains/ and copying the newly created keychain to a safe place\n\n*You can now delete the newly created keychain in Keychain Access via right-click Delete Keychain (Delete References & Files)\n\n\nRestore of Local Items keychain\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the backed up keychain in Keychain Access via File > Add Keychain... and navigating to its location\n\n*Copy all the entries from this keychain over to Local Items\n\n*You can delete the previously added keychain since all of the entries now reside in Local Items\n\nA: If the Local Items keychain backup & restore answer does not work, there's now an alternative method available which uses Safari:\n\n*\n\n*Open Safari Preferences\n\n*Select the 'Passwords' tab\n\n*Unlock content via entry of Masterpassword or Touch ID\n\n*Select a single password entry you need on your new Mac and hit the Share button.\n\nThis allows you to send the selected password entry via Airdrop to the new Mac. Unfortunately, you can't select multiple entries and you have to accept the sharing on the new Mac, and then you have to close the Airdrop window on the old Mac.\nSo it's quite tedious, but still better than nothing.\nAlternative solution update:\nMy next task was to import/export Safari bookmarks, which is done via File –> Export, and there I saw that there is also an Export option for Passwords! So it seems like you can export all passwords without encryption to a CSV file and then import it on another Mac via File –> Import From –> Passwords CSV File! I haven't tried this, but it sounds to be much faster than the tedious solution above.\nHowever, if you do this, make sure that you delete all copies of the password file afterwards and transfer it from Mac to Mac in a safe way!\nSee also https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/ibrw1015/mac\n", "Q: Going in for an apple repair, do I need to remove my second hard drive for the superdrive? The right fan on my mac stopped working, I have scheduled an appointment at the mac store genius bar (its still in warranty).\nI have installed a second hard drive in place of the super drive, and also upgraded the hard drive (to SSD) and the ram (to 16GB).\nDo I need to restore everything before taking it into the mac store for repair? (ie put back in the superdrive and hdd)?\n\nA: Did you install the second hard drive yourself?  If so then your best bet is to swap your SuperDrive back in before taking it in for service.\nI cover this scenario in more depth with this answer:\n\nApple's warranty (AppleCare) is specific about what components are\n  user replaceable/serviceable. The hard drive on an older MacBook for\n  instance is user replaceable, AppleCare used to have the option to\n  send you a replacement hard drive along with a disposable ESD\n  wriststrap for you to install it yourself.\nThe difference though is the hard drive in the MacBook was almost as\n  easy to access as the RAM in the Mac mini. The Mac mini's hard drive\n  is a different story. In order to access it you have to expose the\n  logic board which increases the chance of damage from ESD if proper\n  precautions aren't taken. Because of this the only user replaceable\n  part in the new minis is the RAM, since the logic board is still\n  pretty well protected when only removing the RAM.\nThe Magnusson Moss act essentially says they can't deny warranty\n  unless they can prove damage. It wouldn't be hard for Apple to say\n  \"The upgrade situation you described to us implies that there was a high risk for ESD damage, which has likely caused such and such\n  issue\".\nThe flip side though is that if an Apple Authorized Service Provider\n  (AASP) installs a third party hard drive your AppleCare will remain\n  intact because the AASP has proved to Apple that its technicians\n  follow all safety rules and procedures when working on Macs,\n  essentially the same reason Apple allows them to perform warranty\n  work. Apple would then not be involved in the hard drive's warranty\n  (though most HDDs have 3-5 year warranties of their own) but the\n  remaining components would still be recognized as \"in warranty\" by\n  Apple. The most you would need to do is provide a receipt for the\n  service you had done at an AASP.\nsource: I was \"that guy\" at the Genius Bar for several years who had\n  to turn people away from warranty coverage for unauthorized upgrades &\n  repairs.  As soon as your Mac goes out of warranty I definitely\n  encourage a DIY attitude, however I would try to heed the above advice\n  while it's under AppleCare.\n\nBasically if it was a user replaceable part (it's not) you wouldn't run much risk of them blaming a failure on your upgrade.  The problem though is that with the optical drive not being considered a user replaceable component, and the replacement being a somewhat major (in their eyes) modification, they have every right to deny coverage since they have no way of knowing if proper ESD precautions and whatnot were followed.\nIf I were you I'd play it safe.  The Superdrive installation isn't terribly difficult and could save you a lot of arguing if you don't get a Genius who just looks the other way.\n", "Q: Shortcut to accept top spelling suggestion of the last word Say I'm typing into a document and I make a typo.

When I go the Music app on my iPhone it shows the 'No Content' screen (see screenshot below). This is because I purposely deleted all music from the device (through Settings > General > Usage > Music > Edit > All Music > Delete).\n\nI also deleted all songs (about 250) from my iTunes library on my Mac (moved to trash). I can re-download them because all songs have been purchased from the iTunes store.\nWhen I connect the device to my Mac and select the device's Music list, it shows 7 songs, with a grayed out text color, and with a circle icon with dashed outline next to each song.\nThe device itself does not show these songs.\nWhen I set the device to 'Manually manage music and videos' I can delete the 'ghost' songs from the device's Music list. But after I reconnect the device the ghost songs are again visible in its Music list in iTunes...\nHow can I permanently get rid of these 'ghost' songs listed on my device only in iTunes?\n\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Toggled the 'Show iTunes in the Cloud purchases' option in iTunes. On or off doesn't seem to affect the Music list for a connected device.\n\n*Turned off the 'Show All Music' option in the Music app's settings.\n\n*Reset all content and settings on the iPhone, then restoring from the device's iCloud back-up. \nThis did not lead to any visible change.\n\n\n*\n\n*Re-downloading said songs from the iTunes Store to the iTunes Library on my Mac, then synchronizing with the device. \n\n\nThe result was that 3 out of 7 songs were no longer grayed out, i.e. 'replaced' by their actual downloads, and playable on the device. The other 4 songs were now listed twice, one grayed out and the other the actual downloaded song, present and playable on the device.\n\n\n*\n\n*Deleting all 7 songs from the iTunes library (moved to trash). \n\n\nI was hoping that would get rid of the 3 songs that seemed 'fixed' in step 2 above, but in fact it reverted back to the old situation, with 7 songs listed in a grayed out font.\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloaded the songs directly to the device using the iTunes Store app (via More > Purchased > Music). \n\n\nThis resulted in duplicate entries for all songs (not just the 4 songs like in step 2 above) in the device's Music list in iTunes. Synchronizing the device did not transfer the downloaded songs to the iTunes library.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset Sync Service on my Mac (defaults delete com.apple.SyncServer SyncServicesResetWorldRunOnce, followed by a reboot)\n\n*Deleted iTunes Library Extras.itdb, iTunes Library Genius.itdb, all 'Previous iTunes Libraries' and all 'Album Artwork' from ~/Library/Application Support/iTunes.\n\n*Removed *.localstorage and StorageTracker.db from ~/Library/iTunes.\n\n*Ran the List MIAs v3.3 and Super Remove Dead Tracks v4.0 applications with iTunes open and the device connected (no missing files or dead tracks reported)\n\n*Signed out of the iTunes & App Store on the device (and signed back in).\n\nI use iTunes 11.3.1 (2) on OS X Mavericks 10.9.4, in combination with an iPhone 5S running iOS 7.1.2. All software is up to date.\n\nThere is a cottage industry of apps to help people deal with iTunes' incoherent and inconsistent behavior. I have not tried any of those apps, and they pollute the Google results, making it hard to find an actual solution. I suspect my problem can be fixed with Apple Script, but have no idea where to start.\n\nA: I had exactly the same issue, it's commonly called \"ghost songs\" and it still exists in iOS 10.x There was no way to remove these songs using iTunes (I could deleted them there but on next sync they were just back) or any delete function on the phone itself (I deleted all music on the phone, but iTunes kept showing the ghost songs while the phone said there are no songs on the phone).\nHere is how I was able to fix it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Be sure to have a restorable backup of your iPhone content!\n\n*Download iFunbox\n\n*Kill the Music App on your iPhone\n\n*Connect your iPhone to your computer\n\n*Make sure iTunes is not running\n\n*Start iFunbox\n\n*Choose Raw File System\n\n*Delete the following files and folders:\n\n\n*\n\n*Downloads\n\n*iTunes Control > Sync > Media\n\n*iTunes Control > Music\n\n*iTunes Control > iTunes > MediaLibrary.sqlitedb\n\n*iTunes Control > iTunes > MediaLibrary.sqlitedb-shm\n\n*iTunes Control > iTunes > MediaLibrary.sqlitedb-wal\n\n\n*Unplug your iPhone\n\n*Reboot it the hard way: Press&hold Home+Start button > 5 sec\n (do not power it off the normal way, which is pressing just Start button > 5 sec and then using the slider to power it off.

To exit safe mode, tap Restart on the dialog which is shown when unlocking the device. If safe mode is activated next time the device resprings, then the problem is caused by a tweak which needs to be uninstalled.

In particular, when on Wifi, it would be nice to fetch mail as often as possible, or to use push.  When on cellular data, I would prefer to stick to manual fetch only, to minimize use of cellular data.\nIs there a way to do this?  I can't see a way to do this from within Settings >> Mail, Contacts, Calendars >> Fetch New Data.  Am I missing something, or is this simply not possible with the default Mail app?

Is there something else I can look at to confirm this?\nThanks!\n\nA: I believe you are unlocked.\nI just conducted an experiment for you.  I took my T-Mobile SIM card out of my iPad and put it in my locked AT&T iPhone 6.  It immediately told me \"SIM Not Valid. The SIM card that you currently have installed in this iPhone is from a carrier that is not supported under the activation policy that is currently assigned by the activation server.\"\nThat is what you'd get if you were locked. Congrats: It seems they did indeed unlock your iPhone.\n\nA: The backup / restore routine was required by older iPhones but I don't believe it is required with newer phones. I was able to to move a 5C and 5s on T-Mobile to AT&T simply by swapping SIMs after T-Mobile unlocked the phones.

My MBA 2012 with OS X 10.9.4 Mavericks won't boot anymore - it simply freezes after the initial jingle. I already tried resetting NVRAM and SMC, but to no avail. I don't have any time machine backups.\nHowever, I still have a disc image of Mavericks sitting on an external hard drive, a USB stick and access to a notebook with Windows 7. \nI haven't yet found any tutorial on how to create a bootable USB drive on Windows in order to reinstall OS X on my beloved Macbook Air.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: I know this question is old but it is still valid. I was never able to write a Mac installer image to my Flash Drive and have it bootable, unless I did it on a Mac. Using Michael D. M. Dryden's Link, I was able to use the Diskpart command to clean and prep a GPT partition on a flash drive for an OSX Mavericks install image.\nI used TransMac on Windows 7 to restore the image file I had to the Flash Drive, it created a bootable Mac image on my flash drive. Someone had reported that the method for using DISKPART did not work, but I have done this twice and it works remarkably well, and it's the only method I could find to create a Mac-Bootable Flash. I've been trying to post this to confirm that it works for some time, I just hope it helps someone else, because it is a very easy solution.\nHere are the Diskpart commands used to prep the Flash Drive, just to have them here in case my Link does not work:\ndiskpart\nDISKPART> list disk\n\n(Find the disk number)\nDISKPART> select disk x (from result of List Disk)\n\nDisk x is now the selected disk.\nDISKPART> clean\n\nDiskPart succeeded in cleaning the disk.\nDISKPART> convert gpt\n\nDiskPart successfully converted the selected disk to GPT format.\nDISKPART> create partition primary\n\nNote: I use \"Rufus\" for all other USB writing and formatting for Windows systems, it's a great app, but I had previously tried to format the drive as GPT using that, as a Fat32 partition. When I tried to inject the image, Transmac told me that the drive was \"write protected\". So basically, the USB drive cannot have any high level formatting, the Windows system should detect the drive as \"not formatted\" for this to work, which it will if prepped right with Diskpart.\n\nA: According to the first answer here, https://superuser.com/questions/383235/create-a-bootable-usb-drive-from-a-dmg-file-on-windows, there's a tool with a free trial called TransMac that can do it. Just make sure the USB drive is formatted with GPT and not MBR.\nWhat might be easier, however, is that that model has support for Internet Recovery. If you boot holding Command-R and you have a WiFi connection, it can actually boot into recovery mode without a recovery partition on a drive (or even without a working drive). \nHaving said that, your description of a crash right after the boot chime could signify a more serious hardware problem and you may not be able to boot anything. If you boot holding the option key down, the startup disk selection screen should appear. If it crashes anyways, you may be looking at a hardware problem.\n\nA: In fact, there are very few ways that can be used to write DMG image file to a USB drive and have it to be bootable on a Windows computer. As far as i konw, some third party tools like Transmac, poweriso, etcher or sysgeeker's WonderISO.but none of them are free, I suggest you download the trail version and use it for 3 times without paying.\n\nA: You can make a bootable USB flash drive OS X Mavericks installer from your Windows 7 installation.\nFirst, note the following:\n\n*\n\n*Since El Capitan has the same system requirements as Mavericks, you may instead wish to install El Capitan.\n\n\n*When testing using a clean install of Windows 7 SP1, Paragon Partition Manager Community Edition 64bit would not install unless the \"Convenience rollup update for x64 Windows 7 SP1\" was first installed. This required downloading and installing hotfix KB3020369, followed by hotfix KB3125574. Both hoxfixes can be downloaded from the Microsoft Update Catalog.\n\n\n*This answer was also tested using a clean install of Windows 10 (version 21H2).\nBelow are the steps for making a bootable USB flash drive OS X Mavericks installer.\n\n*\n\n*Use Microsoft Edge (or some other web browser) to download the following installers to your Downloads folder.

If you wish, the installed downloads can be uninstalled from the Windows Control Panel after use. Copy the command sgdisk64.exe from the downloaded GPT fdisk zip file to your Downloads folder.\n\n\n*Copy the InstallESD.dmg Mac disk image file to your Downloads folder. This file can be found in the Contents/SharedSupport folder of the \"Install OS X Mavericks\" application. If the volume containing this file is HFS+ formatted, then use TransMac to copy the file, otherwise use Windows Explorer. If you need to use TransMac, then open the TransMac application with Administrator privileges. (In other words, right click on the TransMac icon, then choose \"Run as administrator\" or \"More\" > \"Run as administrator\".)\n\n\n*Use a 7-Zip File Manager application window to extract the Packages folder, 3.hfs file and the InstallAssistant.icns file from the InstallESD.dmg Mac disk image file to your Downloads folder.

Then try to install the system, if this does not work again, you can start the installation without verifying the image, but you should really trust the image you're using from being corrupted or modified (just to make sure the download went right, use the SHA-1 code to make the file has been downloaded right).\n\nSo, to proceed without verifying the image, from terminal, type in this command: sudo defaults write com.apple.frameworks.diskimages skip-verify truethen, start the installation. (Is possible that you won't need the sudo at the begin, in that case just remove it from the command and start from \"defaults\")Now you should be able to install macOS from a USB drive...Just a little thing, make sure to have formatted the disk before proceeding, I would recommend to make a partition that takes the whole disk in mac Journaled format, then if you want you will be able to encrypt the disk (the installer will ask you to do that later), instead, if the disk was encrypted before, you will have to insert the encryption key of the disk to continue the installation process.Really hope this help, I spent a lot of hours to do this on a really old iMac from 2008... and now it works!Good luck!\n\nA: For those who failed to create bootable USB with TransMac, take a look at UUByte DMG Editor.

I'm currently trying to backup various iterations of OS X (Snow Leopard through Mavericks) on client machines to a central Mac Mini running regular (non-server) Mavericks over a wireless network. I'm able to get the initial backups established, but I'm having difficulty getting subsequent incremental backups to connect consistently–some work and some don't. Will installing OS X server on the Mini (and enabling the Time Machine server) improve the ability of client machines to successfully connect and complete incremental backups?\n\nA: Yes. OS X Server specifically includes the Time Machine Server software that makes it easier for Time Machine backups from machines on your network to reach, wakeup and perform their Time Machine backups to the server using native Time Machine data transfer protocols.\n\nOS X Server can act as a designated Time Machine backup location for all the Mac computers on your network. Centralizing your backup storage helps protect valuable data and free up disk space on individual drives. And it eliminates the need for separate backup drives altogether. OS X Server also takes advantage of Time Machine to back up your server data — including shared files, calendars, mail, wikis, and more — to another hard drive, so you can easily restore to an earlier configuration. And you can view the backup status for each Mac on your network, as well as which computers and users are backing up to your server, when they last backed up, and the total size of each backup.\n\nIt is the only officially supported way for performing Mac-to-Mac Time Machine backups by Apple.\n", "Q: How to disable Mac OS X's autocorrect but still show spelling suggestions?

I'm currently setting up an OSX Server (Mavericks) in a small company (10.9 on the clients as well), and I'm trying to decide what the best approach is to manage accounts.\nThe accounts will not be used for roaming; everyone has their own workstation, and never has any desire to log into other machines. This appears to eliminate the need for home directories on the server.\nNow I'm wondering whether I should create Local Network Users or Local Users (in both cases without a home directory on the server). What is the advantage of using Open Directory to manage Network Users rather than creating Local Users and leaving Open Directory switched off?\nThere are no other servers or off-site networks involved that we need to 'hook into', so that is not something that seems to lead to a requirement for an Open Directory server.\nIs there any reason why I should not just create Local Users instead? What can they not do that Local Network Users can do?\nEDIT: While I'm still interested in the answer to this, I've since elected to set up accounts using Open Directory. I could not find a reason not to, and I figured that there might be services that require it of which I'm unaware at this moment. This will hopefully ease future migration.\n\nA: For a small company, it's not even clear you would set up network users to start with. The costs associated with setting up and running that might be more than it would cost to support a handful of Macs.\nWithout knowing a few items such as exactly how many accounts, how many Macs, how different the Mac users are (are you setting up a lab with 15 identical machines or is each belonging to a user that has software needs different than all the rest.) Also, your decisions on how much users should support themselves (or can even support themselves) would go into the decision on how best to manage IT time and dollars to support the users.\nThere often is no best answer other than starting with something that has a chance of working and then iterating as you learn what is really needed in your specific shop.\nThat being said, if you make Local Network Users they can log into client machines and use the services (file sharing, backup, etc..) from the server but not log directly into the server. Local Users get all the benefits of network users and also get a home directory stored on the server and can log in there as well.\nI'd start with two resources for planning your deployment:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take Control of OS X Server by Charles Edge (to be published by Tidbits - currently available as pre-release chapters online)\n\n*Apple Pro Training on OS X Server Essentials by Arek Dreyer and Ben Greisler\nThe former is easier to get started and organized more in terms of functional tasks and the latter is an exhaustive reference and covers about all the mechanics of how the software operates and is configured.\n\nA: Local Network Users can also login to the local server, if you bind the server to itself in the Users & Groups preference, under Login Options, Network Account Server.\nOfficially, the only thing you lose by shutting off Open Directory is the ability to manage devices using Profile Manager and have \"roaming\" logins with centralized home directories. Un-officially, you also lose the massive administrative headache of Open Directory, which has been (and continues to be) the cause of untold frustration for sysadmins worldwide. I'm in the process of migrating my network users back to local users, because Open Directory is just too easy to break. Quite often, it breaks all by itself.\nSo, the answer to the original question is: Not unless you absolutely must.\nhttp://help.apple.com/advancedserveradmin/mac/4.0/#/apdD1F7D8CA-CF07-40CE-B2D4-8E3ACF4BCA40\n", "Q: How to solve the flashlight and camera bug in iOS7? I recently ran into a very persistent bug on my iPhone 5 on iOS 7.1.2. All of the sudden the flashlight button in the control center is greyed out and the rear camera wont work, i.e. showing a black screen and crashing. According to the Apple forums I am not alone with this issue. For some people playing around with the camera worked. Most end up bringing the phone to the store. I am pretty convinced it is a software bug.\nI tried so far (list will be updated):\n\n\n*\n\n*Play around with camera settings (flash, HDR, ...)\n\n*Turn flashlight on/off with third-party app - app crashes\n\n*Regular iPhone restore from iTunes\n\n*Recovery mode firmware restore\n\n\nNo success. I have no more warranty and so I can't bring it to the store.\nDoes anyone have further ideas or even the solution?\n\nA: If you have done a Recovery Mode firmware restore and you still can't use the flashlight or camera, you likely have a hardware problem. Make an appointment at the Genius Bar and see if they can identify the specific failure (no charge for a diagnostic at least in the U.S.).\n\nA: Any possibility you've gotten some moisture into the phone? These are the same symptoms exhibited by my iPhone 5 after a brief dunk and recovery via desiccator. The rear cam and flash unit never worked again, stalling on initialization, and sometimes crashing the camera app. When I brought it to the Apple Store, the genius said the contacts for the camera were somewhat corroded. I elected to get a new phone rather than pay the price for repair. Hope you have better luck. \n\nA: I checked all the external sensors, and they all appeared red meaning water damage, so I'm assuming that may be the problem. Even though you haven't had your phone in water or anything, it possibly drew water damage, the best thing to do is to take it to a professional and have it looked at.\n\nA: My flashlight button greyed out but I didn't check the camera's function. I just powered off my iPhone and when I powered it on again, the flashlight button was functional again.\n\nA: My torch icon was grey and not working but flash on camera fine.

I recently purchased a MacBook. It's a model that supports Apple's latest OS (at this time 10.9), meaning that it also supports Find My Mac and such.\nI'd like to know what I would need to do to ensure the person I bought the system from can't suddenly lock it with a pin/code. (I've seen a few instances of this happening where sellers try ransoming the buyer for more money.)\nHere's what I know about Find my Mac and my own guess at a solution—any feedback/advice is appreciated. I don't want to become a victim of having the system I bought locked because the seller wants to try make more money or anything like that. I dont care too much for FMM anyway, and so just want to have it, and its functions off at all times.\nFind my Mac does as it says on the tin, it finds your Mac! It also provides options to lock and remote wipe the system—that's all I know of it. \nHere is my best-guess solution at having FMM disabled and preventing the person I purchased from being able to track or lock the system:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wipe the disk entirely in another system, no recovery HD, nothing. Total wipe.\nIn my opinion this would erase any and all iCloud data from previous users and prevent any tracking/locking of the system when the OS is reinstalled and my own iCloud details used. A PRAM zap may also be done as a precaution (Only seen it mentioned once that previous user data is stored there also).\n\n*After OS reinstalled, opt against enabling location services and Find My Mac functions. and/or delete Recovery HD. Apparently this is required for FMM to function anyway, and I can deal with having an external USB installer to recover with.\nWould that be enough to stop the seller being able to track and lock the system?\n\nA: I would do a full wipe on any new computer I bought anyway, regardless of iCloud.\nRegardless of that - \nBefore buying it, I would want to see it turned on and working. Then have the seller go into iCloud preferences and turn off everything, then log out of iCloud on the machine.\nBasically, have them follow this: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT201065?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\nBear in mind that this works both ways - if it's still on iCloud you could potentially get their messages, emails, photos etc, so it's in their interest to take iCloud off it fully.\n\nA: I can confirm (from second-hand bad experience & first-hand testing) that a complete disk erase & clean reinstall does not disable Find My Mac. You need to also either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset the Mac's PRAM (aka NVRAM aka firmware settings). You can do this by holding Command-Option-P-R at startup, and holding them down until the computer has restarted & chimed three times (actually, it's reset by the second chime, but three is traditional).\n\n*Set up FMM with your iCloud account.

However, attempting to open the .app on OSX results in the message:\n\nYou cannot open the application...the Classic Environment is no longer supported`\n\nWhat does this error mean?\n\nA: The Classic Environment is Apple's software that supports running Mac OS 9 apps on Mac OS X. (\"Mac OS Classic\" refers to Mac OS versions before Mac OS X.) Both Mac OS 9 and Classic are really old: Mac OS 9 was discontinued in 2001, and the last version of OS X to support Classic is 10.4 (Tiger), which was released in 2005.\nWhat's the difference between Classic and OS X apps? Their code is completely different, as different as the difference between Windows and Mac apps. This is because Classic and OS X are very different architecturally.\nWhy did Mac OS X think your app was a Classic app? Most likely:\n\n\n*\n\n*On UNIX systems, which includes Linux and Mac OS, launchable program files (executables) must have a executable property set to true.\n\n*Windows and Mac OS Classic are not UNIX and their filesystems don't have the concept of a executable property.\n\n*Most Mac OS apps are folders that appear as files in Mac OS. You know this if you've looked at the app in Windows. The executable part of the app is one of the files in TheApp.app/Contents/MacOS.\n\n*When you moved the file to Windows, the executable file property was lost, so when you moved it back to your Mac, the executable property became set to false.*\n\n*When you opened the app, Mac OS tried to launch the app, noticed that the app wasn't marked as executable, and figured it must be a Classic app.\n\n\n* Usually files that come from non-UNIX systems will have the executable property set to true by default, e.g., if you move files using a flash drive or if you use zip instead of rar. The program you use to unrar files on your Mac would be the one to blame.\nWhy was your rar 177 bytes? Perhaps because there were entire files that were unsupported and so didn't get rar'd.\n\nA: The error means that the app that you are attempting to open is attempting to launch the Classic environment.

I have two MacBook Airs (Running the latest version of OS X 10.9). On one of the MacBooks I decided to get rid of some of the apps that I know I am not going to use. One of the apps that I got rid of was iTunes. But, the App Store forces me to reinstall iTunes... again and again.\nSo, now I am wondering are the App Store and the iTunes apps one and the same? Is that why the App Store forces me to reinstall iTunes again and again?\n\nA: App Store is for acquiring OS X software and alike, while iTunes is for acquiring iOS apps and everything media-related (music, movies, podcasts, etc.). Although they are separate applications, the App Store application must be relying on the iTunes \"engine\" for some functionalities.\n\nA: You can delete iTunes on OS X, but it is not advised, because it is \"integral to supporting other Apple features\" like the Mac App Store. They are not the same app (that's why they have different names and different icons) but one is dependent on the other. For example on Windows, if you deleted Internet Explorer, other applications will stop working. They are not the same but they depend on one another.\nCitation for dependency of Mac App Store on iTunes: http://osxdaily.com/2012/02/06/delete-itunes-mac-os-x/\n\nA: At this point in time I can guarantee everyone that you CANNOT delete iTunes from your Mac. This is true at least for OS X 10.9.\nHere is what I have tried 3 times: purge iTunes; then go to the App Store and check for Updates. The app store would immediately suggest that I need to get the iTunes update.\nThankfully, I had the tgz of the /Applications/iTunes.app from my other MBA, so I could install it without downloading it all over again.\nBottom line: you CANNOT delete iTunes.\n", "Q: lost photos on iphone5 Had a problem with iphone 5 so took phone to Apple rep proceeded to put my phone in restore thinking my photos were all in icloud....well no majority were in camera roll and didnot make it upon the restore.\nSo can I get these photos back or are they gone for ever?\n\nA: If you had Photo Stream enabled, as many as the most recent thousand will be available on there.

I had my iphone repaired by someone advertising on eBay.  I opened the package containing my iPhone 4s and when I turned it on, an email appeared in my gmail account that I sent to myself, which I didn't, that contained information I had in my iPhone notes.  Is it possible that the person who repaired my phone did this?  Now, I cannot find the note that was sent in my \"notes.\"\n\nA: No, the phone can't email itself. He probably went into your accounts, checked your email address, and made a backup of your notes by emailing the stuff to your email address. That's what people do sometimes to remind themselves about stuff the next day or later when you read your emails. \nIf he sent it to your email address, and then read his own email, it is flagged as read/seen, and won't appear as a new/unseen email on any other email client. So this means you could have missed the notification, but he sure did email it to your email address from your email from your phone. \nHope this explains it. :)\n", "Q: My network is not showing up on my list of networks I have a Mac OSX.  My network is not showing up on my list of networks. I am able to get online on this computer but not on the other computers in the house connected wirelessly.  This has been the case today but was not this way before. \n\nA: You will need to figure out if it is a logical or physical issue. Protocol incompatibility is a common cause of these failures, maybe the router reset and configured itself into an incompatible protocol (\"802.11 n Only\" for example). Sometimes the network connections utility itself is the problem, to discard this you can type airport -s in the \"Terminal\" app and see if there your network appears. If not, you can run a Wireless diagnostic with the OS tool, you can open it by holding the alt key while clicking the network icon at the top bar. \nThe utility will guide you trough the steps and give the information that it can get about the problem. \nIf with the previous steps things still don't work or show the cause of the problem, maybe it is at the router side. You will have to verify protocols and configurations according to your router/Acces point model, as every manufacturer has their own configuration. \nApple has an article referring to this, you should check it out if haven't: Wi-Fi: How to troubleshoot Wi-Fi connectivity\n", "Q: Piping into printf In Terminal, I'm trying to replace MY_SUBJECT and BODY_OF_EMAIL from the command below:\nprintf \"From: Sender Name <sender@domain.com>\\nTo: recipient@domain.com\\nSubject: MY_SUBJECT\\n\\nBODY_OF_EMAIL\\n\" | /usr/sbin/sendmail -F \"Sender Name\" -f \"sender@domain.com\" \"recipient@domain.com\"\n\nwith the piping of\nls *\n\nI just can't figure out how to do it, any kind soul to help me with this please?\n\nA: Figured it out.\nIt was as simple as replacing both words with $(ls *)\nSo final command is:\nprintf \"From: Sender Name <sender@domain.com>\\nTo: recipient@domain.com\\nSubject: $(ls *)\\n\\n$(ls *)\\n\" | /usr/sbin/sendmail -F \"Sender Name\" -f \"sender@domain.com\" \"recipient@domain.com\"\n\n", "Q: How to tell whether a purchase used an iTunes gift card or my credit card?

Does this mean it was charged to the credit card or the gift card?\n\nA: If you have a credit card assigned to your account as well as a gift card, purchases will use the gift card first as a rule. Only when the gift card is consumed or can not cover the entire cost of the purchase will money be deducted from your credit card.\n", "Q: OS X Video Driver corruption I have a mid-2010 Macbook Pro with 10.9.4.  I've been using it with a Seiki 39\" 4K TV as a monitor for about a month now with no problems.  (This is using an UltraAV MDP to HDMI Active Adapter cable.) For the first time yesterday I selected \"1080p\" as the resolution in Display Preferences to see what it looked like.  Immediately after going to 1080p resolution, the list of resolutions went blank.  I could click (or option-click) on the scaled circle, and there would be a delay of a few seconds, then I'd see a list of resolutions flash up, and then go away.  Based on what I later figured out, I think if I had tried to click one of those selections when they flashed up, I would have gotten out of 1080p mode.  But I did something else, trying to reset the display preferences to a normal state. (I don't remember what exactly)\nFrom then on, the Mac seems to think it's talking to a dumb TV.  It only lets me select 1080p, 720p, and two other resolutions.  Additionally I get a slider for \"Underscan\" which tells me it thinks it's talking to a TV in some sort of \"TV-mode\".  I don't see the full set of resolutions going up to 4k that I was seeing before.  Here is what I've tried with no joy:\n\n\n*\n\n*reinstall jumbo update for 10.9.4 (no help)\n\n*updating firmware on the TV\n\n*reseting TV to factory standard\n\n*logging in as another user (still see 1080p)\n\n*Resetting the PRAM\n\n*logging in in Safe Mode (this works!)\n\n\nI'd like to remove/reset/review all the non-user files that are different or new since the base OS was installed (counting updates).\nThe only other thing I can think of is to reinstall the whole machine.\nAny ideas short of that?\nUpdate:\nOption-clicking the \"Scaled\" choice enabled about 10 additional choices, which are all smaller than 1080p.  But still no 4k choices, and I still get a slider for Underscan, so it's still in 1080p mode.\nI tried the SwitchResX app, and it might have had a way to help, but I wasn't able to figure out how to do what I wanted.  The normal default operations didn't seem to allow the resolution I wanted.\n\nA: Try clicking on \"Scaled\" while holding the ⌥  key.\nRegular click:\n\n⌥ + click:\n\n\nA: Here is what I did to get my screen working.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist\n\n*Remove /Users/yourusername/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.windowserver.*\n\n*Reset PRAM\n\n\nThis didn't immediately fix the problem, but I tried rebooting into safe mode to make sure that still worked.  I switched resolutions around in safe mode.  I rebooted into regular mode.\nEventually I saw a resolution option I hadn't seen before.  It was something like \"740 x 1200 (HiDPI mode).\"  I selected that, and then the mode flipped away from \"dumb 1080p\" and it gave me a the range of high resolutions I had before.\nIt seems that HiDPI is Apple's name for a \"retina display\" driver.\nSo now I think the OS must have some sort of binary flag to puts you in HiDPI mode.  My problem was that the flag got turned off, and I didn't have an easy way to turn it back on again.  If I'd known that earlier I would have tried setting a properties flag like:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist DisplayResolutionEnabled -bool true\nI found that described here:\nhttp://cocoamanifest.net/articles/2013/01/turn-on-hidpi-retina-mode-on-an-ordinary-mac.html\nI got my display working again, but if I needed to dig deeper into it, I would learn more about HiDPI mode.\n\nA: I was having problems with a MBA11 macOS Sierra(10.12) and DELL U2715H. It was using the 2560x1440 resolution but it was always applying underscan (image was not using the whole panel).\nI installed SwitchResX 4.6.0 and then finally, after digging for a few minutes through all those options, I found what I wanted: \nSwitchResX Preferences > Menus > Menu Extra - Display overscan/underscan (checkbox)\nNow when I click the icon I can see the slider to adjust image size!\nThe app has many other funcionalities and, at this moment, costs 14€.\n", "Q: iPhone calendar reminder + My iPhone's calendar + icon has suddenly gone gray and will not allow me to add a reminder.

The problem is DiskWarrior wasn't updated for quite some time and, though the application version works just fine in Mavericks, the bootable version is old and is based on OSX 10.6.7. \nMy usb disk is detected correctly as a startup disk inside Mavericks, and I can even see it as an option when I press ALT during startup. The problem is selecting this disk just show the Apple logo and the actual boot from the usb never takes place. I recall reading someday about how OSX would prevent you from booting from older version of the system. Is this what's happening here? Is there anyway around this? Do I absolutely have to find an older mac that would allow me to boot from OSX 10.6.7? \n\nA: You can't boot a version of OS X older than the version of OS X that shipped with the machine. This is because older versions of OS X do not contain the drivers required to support the newer hardware that it had no knowledge of at the time of development. The boot sequence will freeze on the Apple logo or blue screen and you will not be able to boot.\n\nA: Just to keep this answer up to date…\nDiskWarrior 5 is now available, as a paid upgrade.  \n\nDiskWarrior 5 supports any locally connected Mac OS Standard (HFS) or Mac OS Extended (HFS Plus) disk including Fusion Drives, RAID volumes, journaled disks, case-sensitive disks, FileVaults and Time Machine backups. DiskWarrior 5 supports both PowerPC and Intel Macs started in OS X 10.5.8 through 10.10. \nStartup Disk Repair Requirements\n  DiskWarrior now ships on a bootable flash drive instead of DVD. If you plan to rebuild the directory of your startup (built-in) disk, you need to start up from another disk capable of starting up in OS X 10.5.8 through 10.10, such as the DiskWarrior Recovery flash drive or your Mac's OS X Recovery (the Recovery HD). OS X Recovery is available in OS X 10.7 (Lion) and later. \nThe DiskWarrior Recovery flash drive ships with the ability to start up any Intel Mac that originally came with OS X 10.4, 10.5 or 10.6 installed. If you have a newer Intel Mac, you can use the included DiskWarrior Recovery Maker to update the DiskWarrior Recovery flash drive to start up your newer Mac.\n\n\nA: Which version of DiskWarrior are you using? On the support page of the website it mentions the following: \n\n10/22/2013 - DiskWarrior 4 version 4.4 Compatible with OS X 10.9 Mavericks\n  The previously released DiskWarrior 4 version 4.4 is required to run an installed copy of DiskWarrior while started from 10.9 Mavericks. If you haven't already done so, you can use the free updater for existing owners of DiskWarrior 4 versions 4.0-4.3.\n\n", "Q: click select IPv6 address in terminal When clicked on IPv4 address in terminal window, it gets selected as a whole, not a single octet.

I could not figure it out, though.\nCan I make click selection for IPv6 to work?\n\nA: This isn't just a Terminal thing, this is an OS X selection thing.

As far as I am aware, there is no way to customize this as it is part of the OS.\n", "Q: Using a MacBook as an iOS “External Accessory\"? Does Apple allow me to make an iOS app that uses a desktop/laptop computer as an external accessory? For example, using a computer to do external computation and/or send input events to the phone over the lightning connector cable. Technically I am not the manufacturer of these products but I was wondering whether Apple would allow such an app in the app store.\n\nA: The old (pre-Lightling) connection \"unofficially\" supported a USB keyboard by plugging it into the Camera Connection Kit USB port. I not sure if this is still possible with the new Lightning port, although, some companies do make a Lightning-to-usb adapter.\nConnecting the Keyboard this way lets you use it in any app that supports Bluetooth keyboards (which I think is pretty much any writing app). It does, however, show you a warning on screen when you connect the keyboard, but you can just dismiss it.\nIf you'd like to read more about what you could do with the Camera Connetion Kit USB port, check out the Using the CCK for more than just photography section of this article.\n\nOn a side note, you can also use you keyboard to fully control your iOS device by turning on some accessibility settings. I don't remember exactly what I used when I tried this, but it was either:\nSettings > General > Accessibility > Switch Control\n\nor:\nSettings > General > Accessibility > VoiceOver   (just turn the sound off when you use it)\n\n\nSo in short, yes, you will be able to use you computer to control an app through the thunder connection, but depending on what you'd like to do, you may need to be a little clever about exactly how you implement this so you take advantage of some unofficial iOS features.\nAnd, if this doesn't work for what you want, I know a lot of apps (like this one) connect to the PC via WiFi. These apps send commands to the PC, but I'm fairly sure you can make the connection go both ways as long as you don't need to control anything outside your own app.\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: How to prevent my iPhone from downloading music when using cellular data?

I'm wondering if there's any way to make Safari be more \"obvious\" when it starts a download.\nEver click on a link on a website which turns out to be a download of, say, a Word document? And you keep clicking, and clicking, and clicking wondering why the browser won't move forward? And then you notice (sometimes, for me, after writing to the webmaster telling them their link is bad!!!) that you downloaded 10 copies of the Word document?\nNot all sites will make a download obviously a download. It's very common for me to find a site where a link may simply say \"click for more information\" and turns out to be a link to a PDF or Word doc or similar. \nThe little quick animation of a Safari icon flying up to the Download icon is very easy to miss if you're not visually focused on the download icon, or if (like me) you have some vision loss. This is a consistently frustrating experience. \nIdeally I'd like to see Safari work more like Firefox or IE, where a dialog pops up or a large flashing bar appears asking if you're sure you'd like to download the file you just clicked on. This would not only make it extremely obvious that a file is about to be downloaded, but also give you the chance not to download it if you accidentally clicked or change your mind.\nApple may try hard to make their software intuitive, but certain things like this just make it frustrating.

The very first one I did showed up in Security & Privacy > Accessibility as 04F05B1B-23E7...6027D697DF.app (not the name of the app). So I copied it's contents, deleted the app, and made a new one with the same name. That worked (it showed up in Security & Privacy > Accessibility as the correct name), but the other name was still there, even though the app was gone. AND if I tried to check the box to allow it to control my computer, it would instantly uncheck itself. So not only should it not be there, but it performs weird as well. Now that was my only problem until today, when I noticed that every single one of the apps I had made had its name transformed into some string of numbers, capitol letters, and hyphens. So I copied the folder the apps were in to some other spot and deleted the originals, that didn't make them go away. Then I zipped up the copy folder and deleted the unzipped one, that didn't work either (yes I have restarted my computer). I have no idea how to fix this and I didn't have any success trying to google it, so here I am. Here's four of the five that exist.\n\nEDIT: Also, could anyone tell me if files related to those applications left on my computer is the reason the apps won't leave.\n\nA: Within Terminal you can run the following command to see the current entries in your system.\nsudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/Tcc.db 'select * from access'\n\nAnd then this command to remove an entry you don't want any longer.\nsudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/Tcc.db 'delete from access where client like \"%YOURAPPNAMEHERE%\"'\n\nSo, for example, I ran the following command which removed Automator from the list.\nsudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.TCC/Tcc.db 'delete from access where client like \"%Automator%\"'\n\nAnd just to give credit where credit is due, I found the solution on Apple's discussion forums here.\nAnother option to find a list of applications which have requested Accessibility access is the following command.

Can anyone interpret what this graph is telling me ? It was created using iStumbler. My wifi connection is really bad and it keeps dropping (still connected to wifi but no connection to the internet). Resetting my wifi solves the problem for a few seconds until it starts dropping again. Any help is appreciated.\n\n\nA: From the graph displayed either your router or your MacBook (?) is having problems maintaining a connection. I assume this happens even when the computer is in the same room as the router? This is important as wifi signals are often attenuated by some kinds of building materials (wiring, metal studs, brick/stone walls, longer distances) so being near the router while testing is a good first step.\nthe fact that thing are OK for a minute or so after resetting your WiFi (power cycling the  router?) may indicate a problem with the router. the trick is what the problem really is.\nThe second thing I would do is make sure you have the latest firmware on the router. Often times firmware updates will fix connection issues and stability issues with the routers. If it an Apple Airport then the Apple Airport Utility has a button to check for updates.\nIf it is a non-Apple WiFi router log onto the admin page and record the firmware version. The go to the manufacturers website and see if there is an update and apply it. Even if there is not an update re-applying the current firmware might help. Also you could try resetting to factory defaults.\nFailing that you could try a 3rd party firmware like DD-WRT, Tomato or the like, and if those do not work then it may be time to get a new router. A decent router is not expensive, but depending on the construction and layout of your home you might just need more than a base model unit. Just remember that more $$ means generally faster access and better coverage.\n\nA: The top line in the graph is the signal, where it is solid the connection is assumed to be available between scans, where it is dashed there was no sample taken.\nThe bottom line the graph is the noise, note that where the noise spikes up, there is a corresponding dip down in signal.\nBesides the above notes about signal strength I'd add that there seems to be something interfering with the Wi-Fi network and generating the noise spikes.\n", "Q: I can pair my PlayStation DualShock 3 Controller, but why are the buttons mixed up? I was able to follow the steps here to connect my DualShock 3 controller to my MacBook running OS X 10.9.4, however now the direction pad, trigger, and shape buttons are all mismatched when I try using them in games or my web browser.\nI've tried in Chrome, Firefox, and Portal 2. They all detect the controller but identify the wrong buttons when I press them.\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: Unfortunately there are few Mac games that come with PS3 controller support.

Maybe via USB that when you plug it send a turn on command?\nAnother way that I have thought is that Macbook turn itself on when plugged in.\nI tried sudo pmset -a acwake 1 but it doesn't work.\nAny idea?\n\nA: Did you already do the SMC reset?\nIf not do it even twice or thrice (firmware can be suprisingly stubborn).\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n", "Q: Unlocked 5s won't connect to new carrier (docomo) data network I recently moved to Japan and got a new SIM card, with a contract, from docomo (one of the major carriers here). I had my iPhone 5s unlocked by a third party, and inserted the new SIM card into this phone. While my new phone number works fine for phone calls and texts (sent to the number), I cannot connect to the mobile internet network.\nNow, 3G appears in the top bar next to \"docomo,\" but no apps that use the internet will load unless I'm connected to WiFi. Usually the error simply states \"unable to connect to the internet,\" but occasionally it will appear as a PDP Authentication error. I have tried all the simple fixes (restoring the phone, resetting network settings, toggling airplane mode on and off), but none of them have any effect. I have also been to the docomo store, but the clerk there was only able to tell me that instead of 3G appearing LTE should appear, and that it was a problem with the phone-->I should talk to Apple. Again, Apple support over the phone was only able to direct me towards the simple fixes, and asked me to go to my nearest Apple store, which is pretty far from where I currently live.\nI think the problem has to do with my not having the correct docomo APN settings, but don't know what might work for changing this. Again, the clerk at docomo was not helpful on this front. Any direction would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: It sounds as though the issue resides in the LTE bands supported by the device. If the iPhone is model A1533 it will not support LTE bands: 6 and 9. A1533 is the model of most American unlocked devices. On Apple's LTE site it gives a list of each unlocked device, and the supported bands that has been organized geographically. iPhone 5S model A1453 is the correct model. \n\nA: A Sim lock can only be unlocked by the provider it is locked to !\nIf you had it unlocked in another way the iPhone is hacked, or even jailbroken.\nYou cannot update or upgrade it anymore.\nRestore it as new (iTunes) and hope for the best.\n", "Q: Getting my old Terminal back after uninstalling fish Recently I got tired of the smaller kinks that the Fish Shell presented me with (undiscoverable commands etc.) so I decided I wanted to change the shell back to normal and uninstall fish.\nHowever in the process of doing so I have done something terribly wrong.\nI have set it to the normal: /bin/bash\nHowever Im represented with a series of prompts (in regards to Vagrant) and have to exit this with the CTRL+C command (cancel)\nI want to get my old terminal back (with my current folder prepended etc.) but I have no clue in how to accomplish this.\nI've attached two screenshots. One is the current terminal (the one with the bash -bash-3.2$in front.\nThe second is the terminal i want (the default with username appended) [source of image is found on the internet, for reference]\nThis is the terminal I have\n\nThis is the terminal I want\n\nI've found two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*My bash profile is deleted hence i cannot see my computer name etc. I've tried to recreate it but:\n\n*I need a sample .bash_profile\n\n*...and i need it to be persistent such that when i exit my terminal I do not fire the VVV script (that it apparently fires off when it first enters the terminal)\n\n\nA: The simplest way to get back your default .bash_profile might be to just create a new user on your Mac. Log in and copy the desired files to that user's shared/public folder. Then log in as you and copy them to the root of your profile folder.\nThe added bonus of this is that you now have a virgin, virtually untouched, user that you can use when troubleshooting your Mac. Unless you are short of disk space a new user profile is not that big and can be valuable in troubleshooting.\n\nA: First, rm ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile ~/.profile These are not needed and don't exist by default.\nSecond, check to see /etc/profile is there, should be:\n# System-wide .profile for sh(1)\nif [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then\n    eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`\nfi\nif [ \"${BASH-no}\" != \"no\" ]; then\n    [ -r /etc/bashrc ] && . /etc/bashrc\nfi\n\nThird, check /etc/bashrc (this is where your prompt is defined). Should be:\n# System-wide .bashrc file for interactive bash(1) shells.\nif [ -z \"$PS1\" ]; then\n   return\nfi\nPS1='\\h:\\W \\u\\$ '\n# Make bash check its window size after a process completes\nshopt -s checkwinsize\n# Tell the terminal about the working directory at each prompt.\nif [ \"$TERM_PROGRAM\" == \"Apple_Terminal\" ] && [ -z \"$INSIDE_EMACS\" ]; then\n    update_terminal_cwd() {\n        # Identify the directory using a \"file:\" scheme URL,\n        # including the host name to disambiguate local vs.\n        # remote connections.

If you don't login with bash, it will bypass the configs in /etc/\n\nA: Clarification: There are two default shell settings.\n\n\n*\n\n*One is the Unix setting and can be changed with chsh -s.\n\n*The other is the Terminal.app-specific setting, and can be changed in Terminal preferences.\n\n\n\nYou can set your Terminal default shell command to /bin/bash -l in the Terminal app.\n\n-l tells Bash to read startup files. Even if you don't have any user-specific startup files, there are system-wide startup files that will, among other things, set the prompt to the one you're familiar with.\nIf you've properly set your Unix default shell, you should be able to select Default login shell in Terminal preferences and this will happen automatically.\n\nA: This is the last chapter in the Fish Shell Documentation:\n\nShould you wish to uninstall fish, first ensure fish is not set as your shell. Run\nchsh -s /bin/bash\n\nif you are not sure.\nNext, do the following (assuming fish was installed to /usr/local):\nsudo rm -Rf /usr/local/etc/fish /usr/local/share/fish ~/.config/fish\nsudo rm /usr/local/share/man/man1/fish*.1\ncd /usr/local/bin\nsudo rm -f fish mimedb fish_pager fishd fish_indent\n\n\n", "Q: How to Undo Deny Access on Keychain When accessing a secure note on my login keychain (Using the Keychain Access app) I accidentally selected \"Deny\" on the prompt. \nNow I have no access to this keychain anymore.

Let's open it:\n\nNope, just a 635x635 PNG of random noise. Anyone have any idea what's going on here?\n\nA: I'm not sure why it's included in the export, but this is one of the default \"Image Fills\": \n\nA: tl;dr: it's the default shape fill, strictly unnecessary if there are no shapes.\nXLSX, DOCX and other formats use OPC (the open packaging conventions), which mandates the zip container and describes how files should be laid out.  If there is a file that you do not recognize, look in the various relationship files (they end in .rels).\nIn this case, the relevant line can be found in the themes relationship file xl/theme/_rels/theme1.xml.rels:\n  <Relationship Id=\"rId1\" Type=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/image\" Target=\"../media/image1.png\"/>\n\nThe file will be referenced in xl/theme/theme1.xml as rId1.  Using ECMA-376 as a guide, you will find it referenced as the default shape fill:\n<a:objectDefaults>                    <-- shape/line/text defaults\n  <a:spDef>                           <-- shape defaults\n    <a:spPr>                          <-- shape properties\n      <a:blipFill rotWithShape=\"1\">   <-- picture fill\n        <a:blip r:embed=\"rId1\"/>      <-- references the picture\n\nThe writer must not be omitting the image if there is no shape.\n\nA: Keynote files exported to PowerPoint do things like this too. That PNG is a background fill from Keynote, and is made available to PowerPoint to be used as the default shape fill for shapes created in the exported document. Keynote not only exports your document, but also the template style elements it was created with - even if some of those style elements (i.e. the background image) haven't been used yet.\n", "Q: How to share ethernet between MBP and iPad? I have an MBP that is connected to the internet through ethernet. I've enabled internet sharing through wi-fi, my plan being to allow my iPad to connect to the internet through wi-fi.\nI've created a wi-fi network and told my iPad to connect to it. When I do so I get a warning that the wi-fi network does not have an internet connection and if I force the connection my iPad cannot connect to the internet (duh).\nHow can I share the ethernet connection between my laptop and my iPad?\nUpdate: Screenshot\n\n\nA: This is what you do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the ethernet cable is plugged in, and that the MBP is using ethernet to connect to the internet\n\n*Open System Preferences and click on Sharing\n\n*Tick the checkbox that says \"Internet Sharing\"\n\n*From the drop down list, select Ethernet. Tick the WiFi (thanks Mateusz Szlosek) checkbox. It should look something like this: \n\n*Click on Wifi Options, and configure your Internet Sharing network.\n\n*On your iPad, connect to the network you created.\n\n\nBe sure to verify that internet sharing is actually enabled by making sure the checkbox is ticked! \nInstructions are taken from these 2 websites, so if I'm not clear, please visit here and here.\n\nA: I'm also having the \"not working\" issue. I've had Internet Sharing work in the past but there has been a few times, like today, where I go in to the settings to start Internet Sharing (I use a modem dongle, so my Internet is not always up and running), the Wifi icon in the bar gets replaced by the Sharing icon for a half second, then it goes back to just being Wifi and starts scanning for Wifi connections. It's pretty frustrating, the data signal out here is weak on my phone so I'd like to be able for my phone to use the dongle via Wifi. It worked before. \nI was unable figure out what changed from yesterday to today, other than my MBP going to sleep over night. The good news is a reboot fixed my issue so perhaps this is something that can get wedged and needs a reboot to recover from the failure. \n", "Q: Create 128 Barcodes within Excel Is there a way to create Barcodes (128 standard) on a Mac, preferably via an add-in?\nI need it to create barcodes in Excel sheets (or moreso a friend of mine needs it). \nI have tried all VBA macros and fonts I found on Google, but none give me a scannable result (usually there are weird characters like ó's mixed in).

You will NOT be able to boot in to Lion because you cannot boot a 64 bit kernel. However, it is possible to use a separate disk to boot into a custom boot loader and then load Lion from there (much like trying to get a MacPro1,1 to boot Lion). This is a definite hack, and not something I would recommend to anyone, especially for a super-low-end machine like this mini.

You should use the latest available version of XQuartz. \n\nSource: About X11 for Mac - Apple Support\nX11 is a very old windowing system for Unix that is not required for almost anything that you'll do on your Mac. The only widespread use of X11 that I use it for is Wine which allows you to run Windows software on your Mac.\nXQuartz is very similar to X11, but is a 'community effort to further develop' X11:\n\nApple created the XQuartz project as a community effort to further develop and support X11 on OS X. The XQuartz project was originally based on the version of X11 included in Mac OS X v10.5. There have been multiple releases of XQuartz with fixes, support for new OS X features, and additional refinements to the X11 experience. Apple is a contributor to the XQuartz project and has worked to ensure that X11 works as expected in OS X with the latest available versions of XQuartz.\n\nXQuartz doesn't 'mess up' the Retina display. It doesn't replace any of OS X's window management. $DISPLAY is only used with and for XQuartz as far as I am aware.\n\nA: I use XQuartz to show terminal windows from my raspberry pi on my mac. I don't think I have a thorough understanding of what it is either and reading other ways it is described makes me feel a bit more confused about my own understanding. I just do a lot of remote work on my pi and when I ssh in I am forced to use terminal editors like nano and when I am making an entire backend api on the pi this is annoying so I use xquartz to display the editor windows in that way.

No need to hit the record button, but you can use the monitor function to hear yourself speak.  And since it presumably knows what to do with both mics, you might both be able to speak.\nYou may also use LineIn to be able to hear yourself speak.

How do I stop the From field from vanishing?\n\n\nA: Open your preferences and go to \"composing\" amd change the setting for \"Send new messages from:\", close the preferences, quit mail, and then reset your preference to what you want.\nIf this doesn't work, make sure you don't have any Mail plugins installed.\nCheck the folder(s) if they exist:\n$HOME/Library/Mail/V2/Bundles/\n $HOME/Library/Mail/Bundles/\n\nA: I have not seen that exact behavior before, but have seen some strangeness in the message fields when the outgoing mail servers are not configured cleanly (or have some how gotten bungled). \nIf the ideas previously presented don't work try going into Preferences --> Accounts --> Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP) --> Edit SMTP List. In there, check to make sure you only have entries for each account (assuming you use different outgoing mail servers for each. Check settings for each to make sure each is unique and not in conflict. I also find it easier to have \"Use only this server checked\" on the account configuration screen.\n\nA: Here's how I solved this: I went to Mail Accounts and selected one of the accounts and under \"outgoing mail server\" I unchecked the box that said \"use only this server\". Fixed! (I had 2 accounts, if you have more than 2 maybe you have to uncheck this in more than one account)\n", "Q: Brother HL-1440 Disappears From Mavericks I'm using OS X 10.9.4 and I have a Brother HL-1440 that I've been using for years, even before I was using an iMac.  It's been a real workhorse and doesn't show signs of failure mechanically (it's still on just the 1st toner cartridge after the one included when I bought it).  I've never had an issue with this printer working with OS X until about two weeks ago.\nIt looked like it was online and I ran a program on the Terminal that sent output to it.  Nothing happened.  It kept showing up as \"Offline,\" but I couldn't find anything to tell me why.  I finally looked around, found the Brother driver (probably the same as the one I had been using), downloaded and installed it, removed, power-cycled, then added the printer and it showed up again and I was able to use it.\nA week later I was using it from the command line again and, again, it showed as \"offline.\"  I tried re-installing the driver, power-cycling, and the rest of that line of thinking, but now it doesn't show up at all.\nI grabbed a different USB printer cable, hooked it up, connecting it to a different hub, and the printer just does not appear now.  I can use either printer cable, but it's not there.  I've tried using CUPS directly, through localhost:631, but it doesn't see it either.\nI know it's been around a while, but it would surprise me if the electronics (which don't move) would give out before the mechanical parts show any sign of failing.\nWhat can make a printer disappear that I might be able to fix?  It seems like there's something flaky going on (and the USB info shows everything else shows up well, so it's not the port on the iMac).  If I have to junk it and replace it, I can do that, but if I can get it to behave again, that'd be great.\nWhat can I look at and check to see why it isn't communicating?\n\nA: I fixed my printer by installing a new driver after deleting the Old printer in System Preferences.(just hit the \"-\" button.)\nThen Download and install this: \nhttp://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadhowto.aspx?c=us&lang=en&prod=hl1440_all&os=132&dlid=dlf006958_000&flang=4&type3=79\nAfter that, go to System Preferences and add (\"+\" button) the printer. If it doesn't show up, check that it is plugged in and turned on, switch it off & on or take out the USB cable & put it back. Then it will appear. Remember to set it as the Default printer.\n", "Q: Turning Caps-Lock into Control is not permanent on MacBook Pro Retina I want to act my caps-lock key as control-key. \nI'm going to preferences ⇒ keyboard ⇒ modifier keys... and say that caps lock should be acting as control.\nThis is working fine until I put the MacBookPro to sleep for longer time. When I open the lid again, the caps-lock is again working as caps lock.\nNot believing that Apple is fixing this quick I'm posting this here in hope that someone knows how to work around this problem.\n\nA: One workaround is to get Seil, which is mainly used for remapping the Caps Lock key.\nCheck the first box, Change Caps Lock, and change the \"keycode\" on the right to 59 (the code for left control).\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to remove the \"Shared\" folder under Users? Under \"Sharing\" in System Preferences, I do not have anything shared. However, I have a \"Shared\" folder under \"Users\". Is there a way to remove this folder? \n\n\nA: Yes, it's possible, but that doesn't mean you should do it.\nFinder/etc doesn't stop you deleting it, and it's not a 'system' directory (despite being created by the system), but is it causing a problem, enough that you want to delete it? Apps can depend on that directory and deleting it could cause problems, now or in the future. I don't have any examples of such applications, but that's not to say they don't exist or may exist in the future.\n\nA: You should follow what George said, it's not going to cause any problems by just being there.\nHowever, if it's bothering you simply being there then hide the folder using chflags hidden /Users/Shared in the terminal.\nIt will still exist, applications can still use it, and you won't see it anymore.\n", "Q: How do I know what version the Mini DisplayPort port is on my 2010 MacBook Pro? I want to connect 2 monitors to my MacBook Pro (mid-2010). The problem is that I don't if the Mini DisplayPort is version 1.2, which would support daisy chaining.  How can I figure out what version firmware my Mini DisplayPort uses and whether or not it would support daisy chaining?\n\nA: The 2011 MBP (MacBookPro8,1) has thunderbolt, so either your machine is not a 2011, or it has thunderbolt. the 2010 MacBook Pros have MDP that supports audio as well as video (I have a 2009 which only does video).\nKeep in mind that MDP and Thunderbolt look identical.\n\nA: Open System Information, then under Hardware select Mini DisplayPort. This will tell you about the firmware of the port controller and more.\n\nA: This FAQ from Apple: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3382#5\nKey part:\n\n6 Can other video adapters be connected or \"daisy-chained\" to Apple Mini DisplayPort adapters?\nNo, you should not connect Apple Mini DisplayPort adapters to any\n  other video adapters. Connect your computer directly to an external\n  display via one Mini DisplayPort adapter.\n\nSo, regardless of the version, I'd be cautious.\n\nA: Thanks so much for your post above - it really places a relatively simple way for all of us to trace our CPU, then GPU and from there the manufacturer stated max resolutions.\nThanks to your clear post, I cld trace my MacBook Pro 13\" 2017's Intel i5 to it's Intel Iris Plus roots...and there it's stated (what no one else has told me):\nThe manufacturer of the Iris 640 says it will only support:\n\n*\n\n*HDMI up to an upper limit of 4K 30Hz.\n\n*Native DisplayPort can support up to 4K 60Hz and\n\n*eDP (for internal display) will also do 4K60Hz.\n\nHuge puzzle solved...explains why so many hv failed by the HDMI wayside. And the few who hv succeeded used a direct wire i.e. thunderbolt3/USB-C to DisplayPort cable thereby gaining native DisplayPort and then the hallowed 4K60Hz!\nThanks for yr time in the pre-dawn hours! You've saved me time in the darkest ones!!\nCheers\n\nA: So I looked up this question, it's 4 in the morning here in California, 2 years later...\nI hope this answer finds you or anyone else interested because I think I backtracked a solid answer for both of us.\nI have lately been getting into doing some specific display work and came across this question, how far can I really push my Macbook Pro 13 with 512mb GPU. It's all based on the video card, as I connected the dots to my experience with audio and sound.\nHere's what I've found...\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_DisplayPort\nWhich like you, led me to the same place, my Mac's about info/system report/graphics and displays and then... nothing. There were some clues though...\nThe intel 3000 graphics chipset\nhttp://intel.ly/2enZo7q\nI did some more research via Apple on my chipset and found this, it dates my computer very very well, check this out...\nhttp://apple.co/2ePaukk\nSo for me I was a 3000 ok? something like 2011... then do this... it's like a complex math problem right? If you know the date of your computer, what connection you have (definitely, mini display port(WHICH ONLY SUPPORT SOME FORM OF HDMI)) but just need to know what kind of HDMI...drum roll please... then all you need to know is the date of your HDMI technology...\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#Version_1.4\nThe new technology including '4k' (1.4) was out 2009 \nAt that point my only option is to assume that my late 2011 macbook includes the previous HDMI 1.4 technology.\nI've compared the numbers between Mini DisplayPort 1.2 and HDMI 1.4 and they are aligned.

I have a pending purchase and i just want to cancel it. Its seems that thou may not have an option for this issue.\n\nA: My experience is that the transaction doesn't take place at the moment you authenticate it. \nThe download of an app commences, sure, but they don't necessarily take any money out of your account. I saw a week pass until I was invoiced and I'm wondering the same thing the person asking the question is, as I \"bought\" multiple apps when I had money in my account, then went out the next day and spent what I thought I had left. \nI am now constantly being asked to verify my payment information a week later as they never took the money out in the first place, and have restricted my use of the App Store to merely browsing the apps, I can't download or update any of them and they won't allow me to cancel it, it's ridiculous and their customer service is appalling.\n", "Q: R2D2 Mac Pro making sound when CPU usage is high (not fan noise) We have a 12-core R2D2 style Mac Pro at the office.  It is very quiet.  If I put my ear very close to it, I can hear the fan humming smoothly, but from a distance it's quiet.\nWhen I run a program that uses all 12 cores at 100%, the computer will emit a strange zzzzz sound comparable to a creaky wheel.  The sound is very quiet, but still audible in an otherwise quiet room.  It's slightly louder than the humming of the fan, and it is not smooth like the fan.\nIt doens't sound like this is the fan spinning up: the sound comes on isntantaneously as the CPU usage goes to 100%, and it stops instantaneously when I stop the program.  I can still hear the steady hum of the fan in the background.\nQuestion 1: Since this computer doesn't have any other mechanical parts than the fan, what is making the sound?  Is it an electronic sound?\nQuestion 2: Does the sound indicate a problem?\n\nA: It's normal. Many computer components can generate high frequency noise under high load, mostly from power circuits, but fans are usually loud enough to cover them up. The GTX 780 in my desktop does this but I didn't notice it until I installed a liquid cooling system. If you're interested, this has some details of the components that can cause this kind of noise. (one example is piezoelectric flexing of ceramic capacitors causing vibration of the PCB)\n\nA: I had annoying 'access' chirps, and thought it was excessive CPU usage. Which it seemed to react towards... fired up disk utility (SSD disk) and ran all the checks, and fixed permissions. Chirp gone...\n", "Q: Automatically opening multiple Apps / TABs for certain projects I'm trying to improve my workflow when working on certain projects. Depending on what kind of work I'm doing, I'll want certain apps open with certain configurations.\nExample:\nFor a web development project, I'll want to open iTerm 2, have 2 horizontal panes. The upper pane will go into the frontend folder, the other one will go into the backend folder. Then, I want to have both folders also open up in Sublime Text.\nIdeally, I'd like to have an app or a file or a script or something, that does this for me so that I don't have to do this every time I want to work on whatever project:\n- Launch iTerm\n- Hit CMD-ENTER for fullscreen\n- Hit CMD-SHIFT-D for two horizontal panes\n- Run \"cd to/project/backend\"\n- Run \"subl src\" to open \"src\" folder in Sublime Text\n- Run \"vagrant up\"\n- Close Sublime windows I had open last time I quit it\n- Hit CMD-ALT-UP to go to upper pane\n- Run \"cd to/project/frontend\"\n- Run \"subl .\" to open new Sublime window here\n- Launch Chrome and open up my frontend in a new tab\n\nThat's just one example. When I'm working on something else, I might want Sketch and Keynote open with certain files (no terminal at all).\nI'm looking for a way to automate these processes. Grateful for any suggestions. Thank you! :)\n\nA: I would recommend using a 'boot' shell script to do most of what you're describing and bind it to an iTerm2 profile. You can configure a profile to have a specific window arrangement (it is a feature of iTerm2), see iTerm2 > Preferences > Arrangements to save your current arrangement as a preset.\nThen, make a new profile that executes a startup script and applies the aforementioned window arrangement as its default arrangement (iTerm2 > Profiles > Open Profiles > Edit Profiles). Ideally, you would bind launching this profile to a shortcut, like Command + Control + D for one-keystroke access.\nIn said profile, under the General Tab > Command section, the startup command should be a shell script akin to below:\nI don't know why it's necessary for you to open up the sublimetext frontend and backend in different terminal windows. Whenever you run subl, it opens the app as a daemon, as subl is just a python wrapper that launches the OS X app.\nSample rough startup.sh script I scaffolded up for ya:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\ncd ~/to/project/backend\nopen . # open Finder window of backend folder\nsubl . # open SublimeText instance of backend folder\n\ncd ~/to/project/frontend\nopen . # open Finder window of frontend folder\nsubl . # open SublimeText instance of frontend folder\n\n# Launch chrome and navigate to http://localhost:8000/ or wherever your dev location is\nopen -a \"/Applications/Google Chrome.app\" 'http://localhost:8000/' \n\necho 'COME AT ME BRO'\n\nYou should change the settings on SublimeText to not remember your window/tab arrangements from previous launch instead of attempting to script it to close all of your windows from before.\nAlternatively, you could have subl open a native, .sublimetext-workspace or .sublimetext-project file and achieve more precise results than with subl .\n", "Q: External monitor randomly lowers resolution adds black borders Okay this has been driving me crazy long enough.\nI have an external monitor who's resolution is 1920x1080 60Hz. My MacbookPro Late/Mid 2010 has been able to work with the monitor and resolution since I've owned it. However, this past month or two the monitor's resolution would seem to reset itself to 800x600. \nThe reset seems to happen sporadically, usually when coming out of sleep. I also experience the monitor going in and out. I've already replaced the Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter.\nHere's a screenshot when the monitor acts up. I can't get rid of the black vertical borders that magically appear nor can I select 1920x1080 as an option:\n\nSometimes after several restarts or plugging/unplugging the adapter, the monitor will fix itself. I have no idea what is going on, it is very frustrating.\n\nA: I forgot about this question, but I eventually did find an answer.\nIt was a bad cable. The VGA cable was faulty (the Mini DisplayPort adapter was fine actually) - once that was replaced, everything worked fine.\n\nA: I'm not sure what's the root cause of the issue. However, have you tried adjusting the 'Underscan:' toggle in 'System Preferences' > 'Displays'? This should allow you to zoom in and out of your display. To get rid of the black bars, you want less underscan, so zoom out (move the handle to the left). \n", "Q: How to auto switch input method by app My mac has several input methods (English, Chinese)\nWhen I open terminal / iterm2 , I want the input method to switch to English  automatically.\nWhen I open skype or chat messenger , I want the input method to switch to Chinese automatically.\n\nA: I have the same problem and solve it by the following approach.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*choose System Preferences\n  \n*select the Keyboard option\n  \n*Select the Input Sources tab, and then check the box next to Automatically switch to a document’s input source option\n  \n\nSource: https://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/53194/os-x-switch-language-input-sources-automatically/\n\nA: \nYou can try going to system prefs/language & text/input sources and checking the box for \"allow a different one for each document,\" but this may not do what you want.\n\nSource: \"Automatic Language Input Change\" on the Apple Support community\n\nA: Try this: GhostSKB\nYou guys really need to try it yourself, then come back to vote or de-vote this answer\n", "Q: OSX Mavericks - Enabling Custom DHCP Options I am using a new MAC running OSX Mavericks with a solaris ISC DHCPD server.\nI have setup some additional options on the DHCPD server but it is my understanding that most DHCP clients don't request all DHCP Options.\nI'm trying to ascertain how I configure OSX to send a DHCP request that includes these additional options.\nMy overall goal here is to issue option 26 which stipulates an MTU size.\n\nA: As per: https://discussions.apple.com/message/26472927#26472927\nThis was the exact answer.\nThe file has moved to:\n/System/Library/SystemConfiguration/IPConfiguration.bundle/Contents/Info.plist\n\nA: now that SIP is in play, is there a way to add additional options to DHCP discover requests?\n", "Q: Is there a drag-n-drop SVG to PDF converter? I use Inkscape quite a bit to produce presentations. Since Inkscape doesn't handle multiple pages, I end up with a lot of individual .svg files. I then have to open each one and 'save as' a PDF to then import them all into preview. Which is kind of a pain.\nIdeally preview would support SVG, but until then, I was wondering if there was a native OSX app I could use to just drop SVG files onto and have it spit out PDF versions. Anyone know if it exists?\n\nA: If you have inkscape installed you can use its command line interface to convert svg to pdf. \n/Applications/Inkscape.app/Contents/Resources/bin/inkscape test.svg --export-pdf test.pdf\n\nUsing Automator you'll be able to make a simple app that accept drag'n'drop. \nLook for run shell script.\n\nA: I used Automator to create an app that converts multiple JPGs into a single PDF. And, frankly, I don't know how to use Automator or AppleScript barely at all so if I could manage it, you probably can, too. Do a Google search for applescript + convert image OR pdf and you'll likely run across the same bits of script I did.\n", "Q: Files missing after doing disk repair I have an NTFS external disk,\nAnd I followed a stupid tutorial, it told me to repair my disk then I can delete the 'un-deletable' files in the NTFS external disk.\nHowever, When I done the repair-disk, the files on the disk were missing.\nBut it seems all the files are still existing on the disk,\nBut couldn't be seen on OSX and Windows 7 (I used the parallel to inspect the disk)\nHow could I recovery the data on the disk, thanks T_T\n\n\n\nA: I experienced this exact problem yesterday.

Whenever I run the Disk Utility App, I can't seem to find a way to reformat the external drive back to FAT32.\n\nA: This process involves a few steps within the built-in Disk Utility program, particularly when your partition is encrypted. \nBefore we begin, note that you should see hierarchy of disks/volumes in Disk Utility. At the highest level, you should see a logical volume group representing your external drive, with at least one Time Machine partition nested underneath it. These two items could both have identical names, e.g., \"Time Machine,\" but they represent different things.\nAlso, beware that following these steps will delete everything on your external drive.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*In Disk Utility, \"unmount\" (don't \"eject\") the Time Machine partition.\n\n\n\n*Erase the Time Machine partition.\n\n\n*Erase the logical volume group, i.e., the higher-level item that contains the partition.\n\n\nA: Go to Disk Utility, select the disk on the left, go to the Erase tab, specify the format as ‘MS-DOS (FAT)’ which is FAT32, enter a name and click Erase.\n\nA: Click on the \"Time Machine\" drive that is indented (the one underneath the one you selected on your screen). Then the \"Erase\" tab should appear. Also, if your Time Machine is encrypted, my experience was that I needed to erase it and choose an unencrypted format in order to really regain full control of the disk.\n\nA: There is no erase tab when using a disk that was a Time Machine.\n", "Q: Searching for \"-<>\" in the contents of files There is a coding library Swiss Arrows that uses the operator -<> for a particular operation. \nI don't seem to be able to search for this in the contents of files on a mac. \nIs there a particular trick I need to do to enable this?\n\nA: I just tried to use Spotlight on Mavericks (10.9.2) to search for a test text file containing the -<> pattern and it worked. \nI used \"-<>\" as my search pattern (including the double quotes) and it found the test file. \n\nA: EasyFind might do it [untested for that particular string] - Freeware from the App Store.\n", "Q: Turn off NVIDIA on Windows 8.1 Bootcamp Has there be a successful attempt to turn off the NVIDIA graphic card and use the Intel one?\nI know that in Linux, it is possible to turn off one graphic card and use the other (using vgaswitcheroo).\nI am running Windows 8.1 Bootcamp on MB Pro 10.1 and experience overheating due to this issue.\n\nA: If you are trying to disable the nVidia graphics card, you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot into safe mode. If you don't know how to, refer to here for more information. Make sure that the Mac is configured to boot from Windows in the Boot Camp Control Panel.\n\n*After booting into safe mode, open Device Manager by pressing Win+R, and then typing devmgmt.msc.\n\n*Expand Display Adapters\n\n*Right click on the nVidia driver and select Disable.

I have plugged an external disk to my Mac. Now, I want to eject it. But my Mac stubbornly refuses and says that an application may be using the disk.\nI have not launched any app neither opened any file from the disk.\nI have downloaded and installed the app What's Keeping Me? This app is quite nice. She tells me that the process mds is using my disk.\nI have killed the process mds and several processes mdworker. These are for Spotlight. But such processes get spawned again.\nHow can I eject my disk from my Mac ?\nI have Mac OS X 10.6.8.\n\nA: Often I find it is mds that is preventing me from unmounting a volume. \nsudo killall mds\n\nAnd then (quickly) try ejecting the volume again. \nIn my case, I am mounting another Mac's main volume on my current Mac. I don't  want to disable Spotlight as I want indexing to resume when the external volume is returned to the other Mac (as its boot up volume). \n\nA: You can try to force-quit Finder, this worked for me. Finder was hanging onto the USB drive, so force-quiting and re-launching released whatever the hang was.\n\nA: You may try to unmount it from the command line:\ndiskutil unmount /Volumes/MountPoint\n\nor with force:\ndiskutil unmount force /Volumes/MountPoint\n\nIf it's still failing, check what's using your disk:\nsudo fs_usage -w -f filesys | grep Volumes\n\nOr using lsof:\nsudo lsof | grep Volumes\n\n(Some processes only turn up when lsof is run as administrator.)\n\nTo disable temporary Spotlight, run:\nsudo mdutil -a -i off\n\nThen sudo mdutil -a -i on to re-enable.\n\nOther apps which can be helpful: Whats Keeping Me.\n\nA: Simply turn indexing off for the drive and erase the contents of the journal on the volume. To do so, open Terminal and enter the following command:\nsudo mdutil -Ei off \"/Volumes/Name_of_Drive\"\n\nYou must run this procedure as an admin. Enter your password when prompted.

The caveat is that the drive will start indexing when connected again, however. \n\nA: To prevent Spotlight from indexing the drive, create a plaintext file in TextEdit with no content, just the title of .metadata_never_index and save to the external. Uncheck use extension \"txt\" ... and tell TextEdit that yes, you do want to save it with a dot at the front (which will make it invisible.)\nI'm not sure whether that will stop it right now, but it will prevent it in future.\nAlternatively, make this Applescript into an app, to force eject [with the usual caveats on force-ejecting...]... credit to The MacTipper Blog\n    property show_credits : true\n\nset the_volumes to do shell script \"ls /Volumes/\"\ntell application \"Finder\" to set the_HD to path to home folder as string\n\nset ejectable_volumes to {}\nrepeat with i in (every paragraph of the_volumes)\n    if the_HD does not start with i then\n        set end of ejectable_volumes to (i as string)\n    end if\nend repeat\nif (count of items of ejectable_volumes) is 0 then\n    tell me to activate\n    display dialog \"Sorry, but there are no ejectable volumes.\"\nelse if (count of items of ejectable_volumes) is 1 then\n    tell me to activate\n    set the_result to item 1 of ejectable_volumes as string\n    display dialog (\"Eject \\\"\" & the_result & \"\\\"?\") buttons {\"No\", \"Yes\"} default button 2 cancel button \"No\"\n    set the_path to quoted form of (\"/Volumes/\" & the_result as string)\n    do shell script \"hdiutil eject -force \" & the_path\nelse\n    tell me to activate\n    set the_result to choose from list ejectable_volumes with prompt \"Please choose a volume to eject (You can select multiple items):\" with multiple selections allowed\n    if the_result is not false then\n        repeat with j in the_result\n            set the_path to quoted form of (\"/Volumes/\" & j as string)\n            do shell script \"hdiutil eject -force \" & the_path\n        end repeat\n    end if\nend if\n\nif show_credits is true then\n    tell me to activate\n    set the_credits to button returned of (display dialog \"This applescript brought to you by The MacTipper Blog.\\n\\nhttp://mactipper.com\" buttons {\"Don't Show Again\", \"Visit TMB\", \"OK\"} default button 3) as string\n    if the_credits is \"Don't Show Again\" then\n        set show_credits to false\n    else if the_credits is \"Visit TMB\" then\n        open location \"http://mactipper.com\"\n    end if\nend if\n\n\nA: If you can’t disconnect a drive for any reason, you can simply Shutdown the computer. When the computer is off, you can safely disconnect the drive. Then start the computer. This will not only enable you to safely unplug the drive, but it will ensure that the mds process restarts in case it is actually hung.\nIf you have decided that you don’t want to use Spotlight with that drive, all you have to do to stop it from being indexed is add the drive to the Privacy tab of the Spotlight pane of System Preferences. Spotlight will ignore the drive.\nAlternatively, if you do want to use Spotlight on that drive, then building an index the first time the computer sees the drive is a necessary evil. Once the index is built, it is updated with every change to every file, so it won’t make you wait again. But if you don’t see a progress bar in the Spotlight menu, then it is likely that mds is hung. Again, just Shutdown the computer in that case, and disconnect your drive.\n\nA: This problem has resurfaced on Catalina and none of these worked. For now I'll force eject and pull the drive anyway if it balks about it.\nIt’s an awful solution but I don’t see how it lowers risk or saves time versus killing the process that is stuck and possibly reading or writing data. \n\nA: Another simple option is to eject it through Disk Utilities.\n\nA: I was cleaning up the thousands of CDs and DVDs that have accumulated over the decades and one got stuck in the external Mac Apple \"Superdrive.\" I tried all the tricks to eject it, including rebooting. Then the OS wouldn't even show that the external drive existed. There were lots of suggestions online of how to eject the DVD and I tried most of them -- saving the most extreme for last, which involved prying open the housing with a flathead screwdriver.\nMy solution was to unplug the drive's USB from the Mac and plug it in to a Windows 7 laptop. The laptop found the correct driver and automatically ejected the disc. I posted this solution to the Mac support forum, but they took it down, because \"the post was not a technical question.\"\nI think the irony of Windows 7 fixing a \"Superdrive\" was too much for them.\n\nA: You can tell Spotlight that it should never index that drive and then you won't have to worry about it.\nIn the 10.11 System Preferences there's an entry for 'Spotlight', which has a tab named 'Privacy'.  Click '+', select your drive, and you're done.  Just close System Preferences, wait a few seconds for the system to notice the update, and you should be able to eject.  Now it won't start indexing the disk the next time you connect, so you won't have the problem again in the future.  \n", "Q: Terminal won't ask for passphrase and not stored in keychain I recently rent a VPS and generated a public/private key pair and transferred it to my server (added it there to the authorized_keys file) ...\nSo far on my first login via terminal on OSX I got asked for my passphrase and declined to save it to my keychain.\nHowever my terminal won't prompt for the passphrase anymore, instead I can connect instantly via \"ssh myserver.com\" ...\nI can't find the key in my keychain (why should I) and can't figure out why it's not asking for my passphrase!\nEDIT: Ok, after a restart of my macbook I get the prompt again. One time. It seems it saves it temporarily ... I do not want that\n\nA: Your passphrase isn't being stored anywhere, but your decrypted private key is stored (in memory) by a process called ssh-agent (man page). This process, which OS X starts when it boots up, stores and manages private keys so they never have to be exposed to other processes that use SSH connections.\nWhen you enter in your password, your computer decrypts your private key and ssh-agent gets a copy to hold on to until it is killed (e.g. on shutdown) or the key is manually removed using ssh-add (man page):\n\n\n*\n\n*ssh-add -l lists all currently held keys\n\n*ssh-add -D forces ssh-agent to forget all currently held keys\n\n*ssh-add ~/.ssh/newkey_rsa adds the private key ~/.ssh/newkey_rsa to ssh-agent. \n\n*ssh-add -t 3600 ~/.ssh/newkey_rsa adds a new private key with an expiry time, so ssh-agent will only remember newkey_rsa for (say) 3600 seconds.\n\n\nIt may satisfy your concerns to know that your passphrase isn't stored anywhere. But if you really want your computer to prompt you for your passphrase every time, you could use ssh-add to make ssh-agent forget your key and then re-add it with a short expiry time.\nKeep in mind that other solutions — like requiring a password to unlock your workstation when you're away from your desk — may also address your underlying security needs.\n", "Q: How to launch Gnumeric after installing using Homebrew I've installed Gnumeric using Homebrew.

A 1GB file might take a few minutes, whereas over Ethernet, it's done in a fraction of that time.\nI know I can't make my Ethernet connect to my Internet faster because of the hardware limitations of my house. But I guess I could try and work out why my Wifi file transfer is so slow.\nBut for sake of Stack Exchange, my only questions is as stated in the first sentence.\n\nA: There are tools like Marco Polo that can change such settings based on location, but you will need to actually change your location, or have some other automated way to trigger this change. While there are some sophisticated servers and network hardware that can access multiple TCP/IP connections, and route different classes of network traffic to different ports, your Mac isn't one of them. So, I really don't think there is anything in the software you can configure to have your Mac send some traffic over Ethernet and others over Wifi: its all or nothing.\nI too prefer to use Ethernet for file transfers, whereas Wifi is fine for nearly all other uses. The easiest way to achieve what you want is to simply plug in the Ethernet cable when you want Ethernet, unplug when you do not.\nFor this to work properly, you simply need to inform your Mac to prefer Ethernet over Wifi. You do this by System Preferences> Network. Click the 'gear' icon at the bottom of the Network list, then choose \"Set Service Order\". You want to drag the Ethernet service to the TOP of the list, with Wifi below it. This way, the Mac will connect to Ethernet when it is available, even over an active Wifi connection.  \n\n\n\nA: Split the traffic with different subnets on your router. If your lan is giving addressing in the 10.10.10.0/24 range and your wifi is giving them in the 192.168.0.0/24 range everything you connect to on the 10.10.10.0/24 network with only use ethernet.\n\nA: I have a similar issue; it happens from time to another that we lose the internet connection in my office.  We are still connected to the server by ethernet so what I do is to share my mobile data connection.  I need the connection to the server for file access so I only need to set the wifi to be on top of the list, no need to unplug the ethernet cable.  This way i get both the external connection to the internet and the local ethernet.  Work can continue as nothing has happened, but of course this can result in a juicy bill from your cell provider if you forget to break the connection to your cell when internet is back on the server/ethernet.\n\nA: Here's what I did - \n\n\n*\n\n*Connected my macs via thunderbolt/ethernet with file sharing on\n\n*Assigned TX mac to receive internet signal through wifi \n\n*Turned off wifi in the RX mac\n\n*Turned on Internet sharing via thunderbolt/ethernet on TX mac\n\n\nHence, everything coming into the RX mac is via thunderbolt/ethernet, including internet.\n", "Q: How to close a window without the application quitting? The OS X menu allows exit, minimize and maximize:\n I know the following shortcuts:\nExit:      command+Q\nMinimize:  command + M\nMaximize:  ?\nWhen I use command+Q to exit the behavior differs from clicking the red button.  I want the UI to close and the application to remain running.  Instead, the application exits entirely.\nHow can I accomplish this with a keyboard shortcut?\n\nA: You always have the option to hide the active program. When the application in question is active (in front of all others) there are 2 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*option ⌥+click on the Desktop\n\n*command ⌘+h\n\n\nThe first option always works or at least I can't think of any exceptions this minute. The second is supported by most applications.\nIn either case:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your session will be preserved.\n\n*Neither will cause these windows to be displayed in the Dock where the minimized programs are located.\n\n*You'll need both hands. \n\n\nSo, if you're scanning eBay at work, you'll likely only look suspicious. But, if you lean into it and use ⌘+⇥ (command+tab) PLUS ⌘+h in succession, you might actually look like you're doing work.\nBut, in the event you're asked to bring your browser back to the forefront you'll be busted. It will display exactly what you were looking at when you hid it.\nYou can imagine how I know this :-)\n\nA: command ⌘+W will close the application's window, leaving the application running in the background.\nThere are a few exceptions to this (iPhoto, etc) but the majority of applications will have this behavior.\n\nA: You can use command ⌘+H to hide one entire application. Only the dock item will be visible. However, it's better to have an app, that uses a menubar item (\"Menubar App\") and allows you to completely hide the dock item while running.\n\nA: 'Alt F4' on Mac\nI recently started working with Mac and this was the first thing i researched. Its surprising that no one knows of this command even tho its in the official 'docs'.\n\n\n*\n\n*cmd + shift + w --> closes window with its tabs\n\n\napple shortcut page\n\nA: Typically, an application will offer a way to both close the UI and quit the application. These are usually standardized to command ⌘+W to close the UI/window and command ⌘+Q to quit the application.\nSome applications will still quit entirely when you use command ⌘+W, such as Preview. You can usually rely on this shortcut to close the window without quitting, however.\nI should also point out that the red button in the top left does not \"quit\" the application as you mentioned in the question body. It will close the window (just like command ⌘+W). \n\nA: It depends on the type of application \nIf the application is multi-document (.g Safari, Preview)  i.e. can have several different documents open in several windows then command ⌘+W will close the current window and leave the application running (until possible it is shut down if the OS needs more resources)\nIf the application has just one window e.g. App Store, System preferences then closing the window will also close the app. Thus command ⌘+W and command ⌘+Q do the same\n\nA: I've found it annoying that none of the keyboard shortcuts seem to be quite the same as window close.  I ending up binding hyper+w to hs.window.focusedWindow():close() in Hammerspoon and that works\n", "Q: Bootcamp stuck in Windows I have a Bootcamp partition with Windows 8.1 that I rarely use.

If that doesn't work then it's likely that the OS X volume has issues and the system is failing to boot there and falling back to the second viable OS - Windows.\nYou might be able to see that in the console if you boot verbose or single user mode.\nThe official fix at that point would be to boot into Recovery and then see about repairing or reinstalling OS X.\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X: About OS X Recovery - http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718\n\nA: If this helps anyone else:\nThe SMC, PRAM, VRAM, etc. combinations didnt work for me (Opt key still wouldnt work), however worked for me today was recovery mode: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314\nI ran First Aid and then selected the desired startup disk and that seemed to boot my Mac back up.\nI would also avoid using external/bluetooth keyboards, etc. in this situation.\n\nA: I was not able to get my Mac (2018 Mac Mini) to boot to anything other than Windows using any of the keyboard options listed here. In my case it's extremely likely because I'm using a third party keyboard that isn't activated until past when the boot override input is needed. I also didn't have a Mac keyboard or really any other keyboard immediately handy. However, what did work for me was the following:\nIf you have BootCamp drivers successfully installed you can access through the system tray in Windows a boot menu which allows you to force restart into MacOS. In my case the drivers hadn't installed correctly such that the boot camp menu did not appear in the system tray, but instead I was able to extract the contents of the Bootcamp.msi download into C:/Program Files/Bootcamp and then run the boot manager exe directly from Windows Explorer. After running the boot manager I was able to select MacOS as the startup disk from Windows and subsequently successfully booted into MacOS.\n", "Q: How can I make Time Machine do a full backup? Recently, my Time Machine disk exhibited some filesystem errors.  Disk Utility was able to correct them, but I don't trust the existing backup content much, and by extension, don't trust incremental backups made against that content.\nI would like to force Time Machine to create a new, full backup (or, at the very least, an incremental backup while actually comparing all files and their content) without destroying the old backup content.  I know I can destroy the existing backups and go again, but I'd rather preserve the history, imperfect as it may be.\nHow can (or, even, can) I do this?\n\nA: The mechanism to force a full backup isn't well documented, but it does get logged to the console logs as Forcing deep traversal on source: \"Macintosh HD\" ... but even if this happens, the system will base the storage of new copies of files on what exists on the backup volume previously.\nI would add a new drive and back up to it once if you are concerned that your backup is no longer reliable.\nFrom the command line, you can then check on things with tmutil compare or by using a tool such as BackupLoupe to convince yourself that specific (or ongoing) backups are correctly being made.\nYou can hint that a full scan is needed by excluding all the files you care about in options. Then run a backup, then remove the folders / files from the exclusion and then tigger or wait for the next backup. \n\nA: If you press alt/option key and then click on TimeMachine icon at the top (you can turn the icon on in TimeMachine settings), it will give you an option to verify the existing backup. If that verification fails, TimeMachine will offer you to recreate the backup (you'll loose the history).\n", "Q: Switching \"TrackpadMomentumScroll\" on and of using a script I'd like to switch the accessibility preference \"Scroll with inertia\" on and off for a Magic trackpad.

What you see are dots hiding the password. There is no way to get the iPhone to show you the password, which is a very valuable security feature.\nFortunately, the wifi password is not something the iPhone controls. That is controlled by the Wifi router.

However, when I run \"php -m\" on the terminal, I can't find mcrypt between the php modules.\nAny advice??\n\nA: I don't think MAMP relies on the php package installed in Terminal (or in OS X for that matter). MAMP uses it's own php version located at /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.5.3\nThe modules are in the folder I noted above in a subfolder called /modules.

Example: If I post a Red color coded event the lettering for my description is black.  I want the description I type for my Red event to be Red, not Black.  It would stand out as what color code the event is. Currently if I post a new Calendar event and choose a color for it just a small dot appears next to black font description of my event.

I often have to work with large scanned pdf documents (law reports, not that it matters).\nIt's quite handy to be able to highlight key passages, but for the most part these documents have not been run through OCR, and so each page is just an image.  (I'm not interested in OCR-ing them myself, either.)\nAs a result, Preview's highlight tool doesn't work, as it expects to be highlighting text.\nWhen I'm working on Windows, I use Foxit Reader's 'area highlight' function to work around this.  Basically, that just creates a transparent yellow rectangle when you click and drag.\nIn Preview, I can do the same thing by creating the rectangle manually, but that is quite fiddly takes far too long.\nIs it possible to configure the highlight tool to just highlight the region you click and drag over, rather than the text in that region?\n\nA: I could not find a way to do this using Preview.  I tried to cheat by using the line drawing tool, and setting the color to a transparent yellow.  Unfortunately, Preview doesn't seem to allow transparency with its shape tools. (To see what I mean, draw a line, then bring up the color picker window and move the Opacity slider around -- it's either all or nothing.)\nAs an alternative, I suggest Adobe Reader (I receive no commission).  Its text highlighter has the same limitation as Preview's, but its line drawing tool supports transparency. Open up the Comment pane on the right, then the Drawing Markups section. Right click on the line tool and select Tool Default Properties to change the lines' color, opacity, and thickness. You also might want to enable Keep Tool Selected so you can quickly highlight multiple areas. \n\n\nInstead of the line tool, you might prefer the rectangle tool.  Follow the same steps as before, but additionally set the Fill Color to be the same as the Color (and make sure the Transparent checkbox is NOT selected for the Fill Color).\n\nA: Dagremu's suggestion is a great one. While his trick might not work when he was writing, I am able to use line tool to highlight a line as shown in the screen capture below. This is an important improvement for Preview!\n\n\nA: By selecting the draw tool (the pencil drawing a backwards \"s\") you can then choose the thickest line. In the same menu (click on the option already selected if either the dotted or 'crayon draw line' are selected) in order to get a full solid line. Then, simple choose a colour and click on 'show colours' to change the opacity to ~50% for highlights. This way, you can draw over anything you want, including text and regions. For larger regions, follow the same steps but use a rectangle and chose the solid rectangle option. \n\nA: Unfortunately I cannot mark up on @Carl PCH answer. But that method worked for me but below are more exact details to follow in order to achieve highlighting a area in preview.\n\n\n*\n\n*Annotate > Line\n\n*Increase the size of the line by clicking on Shape Style dropdown.\n\n*Now click on Border Color (this will display all colors), click on show colors on the Border color drop down.\n\n*Now change the Opacity of the selected color.\n\n\nWhola!! you just highlighted a area (NOT TEXT) in preview.\nWorks in a great way. Try it out and let me know if still have any issues.\n\nA: I used unfilled Boxes to mark or the Line Draw Tool to underline things on my Pic-PDFs maybe thats also good enougth for you.\nSometimes when i needed larger Parts of it i cut them out and put all those clipings together in a Pages Document.\nAn other possibility would be to convert PDF Pages into single Images and use Paint Tool like Gimp to Mark things and then just Reprint/Export them into PDF.\n", "Q: iPad problem with overweight GarageBand GarageBand occupies 13 gigs, but the app itself is only a couple hundred megs.

Unfortunately, this plague has begun to spread to the Mac as well. There are a number of different programs out there that serve no useful purpose except to shove ads in your face, all just to make money for the developer of the adware. Because it lives in the borderline between malware and legit software, though, detection by anti-virus software can be very hit-or-miss. This can make removal difficult.\nWhere does it come from?\nAdware often comes packaged in installers for other software. Most often, this is because something was downloaded illegally from a torrent or piracy site. Sometimes it is because it has been added to a legit piece of software by an unscrupulous download site. (Even well-known download sites, such as Download.com and Softonic, have resorted to this kind of unethical behavior, and should never be used.) Other times it is because a developer has opted to use an adware-riddled installer, provided with incentives from the adware creator, to distribute their software. It could even be installed through deceit, by pretending to be something that it is not in order to trick the user into installing it. (This last type is usually the only type that is detected as malware by anti-virus software.)\nWhat are the symptoms?\nThe most typical symptom of such adware is the display of advertisements on your Mac where none should exist. Adware also will often change your browser’s home page and search engine settings, and may even cause redirects from legit sites to sites constructed for the financial benefit of the adware developer. It can also cause secondary problems, such as web pages displaying incorrectly (due to insertion of foreign HTML code) or browser crashes.\nHowever, problems with unwanted ads in the web browser are not necessarily caused by adware on your computer. They could also be caused by a compromised network or a problem with the site itself.\nStep 1: Run the Adware Removal Tool\nDownload and run The Safe Mac’s Adware Removal Tool. It will scan your system and remove any known adware automatically. Be sure to pay attention to all prompts, as you may need to decide whether or not to delete certain preference files, or may need to restart the computer and then run the script again. Read the prompts carefully, and be sure you understand and follow all instructions.\nIf you feel uncomfortable running a script downloaded from a website that you may not have ever heard of before today – which is perfectly reasonable – then you can try the manual removal instructions instead. If you opt for manual removal, be sure to follow the directions very carefully! Be aware that, for some adware, there is some risk involved with manual removal if you accidentally delete the wrong thing or don’t follow the instructions carefully. Some adware can cause your system to crash and be unable to start back up if the instructions aren’t followed carefully!\nStep 2: Check for other causes\nIf you don’t find any signs of adware, your problems may not actually be caused by adware at all. You may be on a compromised network, or an ad-supported wifi network. You may also be looking at a site that has been hacked, or even just an ordinary bad site. For help figuring out where the problem might be, see the Other Causes page in this guide.\nStep 3: Report new adware\nIf you have followed the instructions in the first two steps carefully, but you found no adware in step 1 and the tests in step 2 indicate that the problem is due to adware, you can download the TSM System Reporter and use it to scan your system and send me a report. This is important for detecting new adware.\nDon’t be shy about sending reports if you think you may have something new. However, please do not send me reports if you have not completed both steps 1 and 2! I get a lot of reports from people who have not done so, and those reports often show adware that would have been removed by the Adware Removal Tool. You will save yourself (and me) a lot of time by following the directions the first time, rather than waiting for a response from me telling you to go back and follow the directions!\nNote that this page is a work-in-progress, and probably always will be. If you find adware not described on these pages, or find that known adware is behaving in ways other than as described here, please contact me!\n\nor maybe... \n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.bitdefender.co.uk/solutions/adware-removal-tool.html freeware, but only seems to look for one thing\n\n*http://macscan.securemac.com $39\n\n*http://www.iobit.net/macbooster.php? trialware/nagware; suspect it may 'find' more than it needs to & won't fix til you pay. I'd call this a last resort, as I don't like their tactic.\n\n\nI'd check out all the free & manual options first, before putting your hand in your pocket for MacScan - though I use it myself & have been happy with it [no affiliation]\n\nA: Proceed the same as you would for a compromised server - read this post on ServerFault.\nThe reason for this is you don't know what that adware does exactly, it may just be a dumb program that displays ads but if I was to make such a software I'd also add some remote access capabilities to it for stealing personal data and bank credentials (much more profitable than ads), so you should assume that the adware's author did the same and not take any unnecessary risks.

Only Numbers files are allowed a \"quick look\" and nothing else. This whole thing seems like a waste of time. \n\nA: \nWhen we go to a program we go there to create a new file or\n  resume work in one.\n\nOr, we may want to open a file that was created with another app. For example, we may have created a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file with another app and want to open it in Numbers to format it as a spreadsheet.\n\nWhen one clicks the Numbers Application icon Why does\n  Numbers in Mavericks list files with different extensions\n  and not just Numbers files? \n\nNumbers shows you all of your files, because hiding some files is disorienting and prevents you from finding your way around the file system.\nHowever, notice that some files are grayed-out within the Numbers Open dialog box. Those are the files you cannot open with Numbers. If a file is not grayed-out, then you can open it (or Quick Look it) with Numbers. This includes many files that are not Numbers documents, or were not created by Numbers, such as Excel spreadsheets, or text files of all kinds.\n\nOnly Numbers files are allowed a \"quick look\" and nothing else.\n\nThat is incorrect. If a file is not grayed-out because Numbers can’t open it, and you can Quick Look it in Finder, then you can Quick Look it in the Numbers Open dialog box. Try Quick Looking an Excel spreadsheet or any kind of text file.\n\nThis whole thing seems like a waste of time.\n\nIf that is so, then toggle the Numbers Open dialog box from “On my Mac” to “iCloud,” where you can Save your Numbers documents in one flat hierarchy of Numbers-Saved documents. That way, when you activate Numbers, you can choose only from the documents you previously Saved with Numbers.\nNumbers is giving you a choice of 2 ways to work: iCloud’s straightforward “Numbers owns these Numbers documents and that’s all I want to see,” and the “On my Mac” method of incorporating files into Numbers that were not created by Numbers, and which may be Saved in arbitrary places in a larger filesystem.

I don't see any stats for 2560x1600 and 2880x1800. Does this mean that these Retina screens are reported as 1280x800 and 1440x900 respectively?\n\nA: 1440x900 is the native resolution for 15'' non Macbook Pros, and the given  (best/default) resolution for 15'' rMBP with the pixel doubling effect taken into account, as it is.

As soon as you put the file in a write-protected image/device or lock the file, iPhoto will display an error that it can't open the library.\nTherefor it seems your only option is to keep one writeable, and if you're paranoid of accidental changes put a none-writeable copy somewhere else (be it any physical media or a locked file).\n", "Q: Mac server keeps \"disappearing\" and \"reappearing\" on local network I'm hoping someone can help me figure out a really perplexing issue we've seen with a Mac server on our local ethernet network. What we're seeing lately is that the server (which we use for Time Machine backups) will seem to \"disappear\" and \"reappear\" to our Macs, with a different \"identity\" each time.

You can replace the _afpovertcp with _smb to browse for windows fileshares.

Once the view reaches the top of the photo, I'd like it to hold for about four seconds.  I can't seem to make that happen, even if I'm using the inspector.  Any step by step tips folks can offer up would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!\nLeah\n\nA: *\n\n*Click the clip after the clip that you wish to pause\n\n*Press ⇧← to go back to the end of the clip that you wish\n\n*Press ⌥F to add a freeze-frame\n\n*Delete the third clip\n\n*Set the second clip to Fit or Crop to Fill\n\n", "Q: Terminal window title rapidly changes when first opening When I open a fresh terminal window, the title at the top has this format:\n[house icon][username]-[command]-[terminal size]\nThe command portion of the title initially says login, then it very quickly rotates through other commands like ps, awk, grep, cat, sed, dirname, then eventually resolves to bash. The title switching happens so fast that I can barely read the words. I'm on OSX 10.9.4 but I believe this used to happen on slightly older versions.\nI checked out the history to see if it might be that, but it's not. It doesn't seem to affect anything besides possibly starting the terminal a second or two slower. Why does this happen and is there a way to fix it?\n\nA: The commands shown in the title indicate that something is being run. This is likely to be in a sourced file such as…\n\n\n*\n\n*~/.bash_profile\n\n*~/.profile\n\n*/etc/profile\n\n*~/.bash_login\n\n*~/.bashrc (although this is not sourced automatically)\n\n\nCheck the files that your shell is sourcing for the commands that are being run and comment them out or remove them if necessary.\n\nA: I am surprised you are seeing sed and dirname unless you have a heavily modified suite of login profiles, but this is relatively harmless behavior in which the terminal title changes to reflect the currently running program. \nTo see this in action, type sleep 5 in a Terminal window and for 5 seconds your title bar should say sleep in the middle instead of bash\n", "Q: Striving to become power user on OS X (coming from Windows) I'm a long time Windows developer guy & did lots of lower-level stuff (hesitate to say power user). I'm very proficient on the command line and using PowerShell... but now that I've moved over to OS X I feel lost at times. I'm not talking about learning the stuff on https://www.apple.com/support/macbasics/pctomac/ rather, to start I'd like to get a better understanding of the organization of the file system & working in the terminal.\nI see /usr and folders in there but my lack of understanding in what I'm typing when I go to install some developer utilities / tools (think stuff that involves Homebrew) feels like I've missed a lot of steps.\nAny suggestions on where to crash course?\n\nA: I know almost nothing about Windows, but I think the equivalent of PowerShell on the Mac is AppleScript, not bash. The equivalent of bash would be MS-DOS Prompt, right? With PowerShell, you’re scripting the Windows GUI and apps, right? That is AppleScript on the Mac. So you might get more practical — and immediate — results from using the AppleScript Editor app rather than the Terminal app. Terminal enables you to script Unix command-line apps and become a Unix power user, but AppleScript Editor enables you to script both Mac GUI apps and Unix command-line apps, and become a Mac OS X power user.\nTo give you an idea of what I’m talking about, you can Copy/Paste this AppleScript into your AppleScript Editor and tap the Run button at the top of the window. The HTML source of the current Web page that is showing in Safari will appear in a new document in TextEdit.\ntell application \"Safari\"\n    activate\n    if document 1 exists then\n        set theHTMLSource to the source of document 1\n        tell application \"TextEdit\"\n            activate\n            make new document with properties {text:theHTMLSource}\n        end tell\n    end if\nend tell\n\nThis is a very basic example, but most AppleScripts are just expansions of this core idea of multiple Mac apps working together like a player piano. In-between Safari getting the HTML source and TextEdit rendering it, you could use the “do shell script” command to apply a PHP function to the source. After it is showing in TextEdit, you could use the “save” command to save the source as an HTML document to a particular file folder.\nA key thing is that right away, you’re automating the apps you use every day. Anything that can be described as “grunt work” can be automated into a single step with AppleScript, so that you save a lot of time and trouble as you work. And right away, you’re not just using Mac apps, you’re also making Mac apps, because any AppleScript can be Saved as a standalone Mac app.\nUltimately, you do end up learning the Unix shell, but only the parts that you find interesting and useful to your work. For example, if you’re writing an AppleScript and you want it to download a file from a URL, you can have the AppleScript run the Unix “curl” command, but after that the AppleScript might open that downloaded file in Photoshop and add borders to it and reduce it to a certain size and export a Web-ready JPEG, and finally your AppleScript could use an FTP app to upload that JPEG to a particular Web server.\nThe whole Mac is fair game in one way or another with AppleScript.\n", "Q: Reinstall assembler, /usr/bin/as I've lost /usr/bin/as. How does one reinstall it?\nThere's no as in the /usr/bin of my recovery partition. Reinstalling XCode and command line tools didn't help.

It seems to start at the darnedest times with no apparent provocation.  I've poured through everything from many and varied dtrace scripts to other dark arts incantations to no avail.\nI was working away when I popped up to iStat Menus for a peak at what might be consuming my processors during a particularly grueling moment and noticed that my GPU was not only peaked out, but that it has been consistently peaked out for a VERY long time:\n\nNot only is this interesting, but performance problems also coincide with these periods of time.  I now have a fair amount of certainty that there is some culprit chewing on my GPU for obscene amounts of time and this would explain a lot of various problems that occur with screen redraw, input, etc. ad infinitum.\nAny ideas on any tools or methods to track down such problems on an ATI card?\n\nA: Activity Monitor may be able to help you out. It has 2 columns, called %GPU and GPU Time, which both can be used to track down the process causing problems.\nIf you don't see the columns, just simply go on View, in the menu bar, then Columns and selected the aforementioned columns to show them. \n", "Q: How do you compare the system resources used by two programs?

This lets you compare the statistics in real-time.\nFor a more averaged comparison, you can check the Average Energy Impact of an app in the Energy tab of the aforementioned app (requires ≥10.9).\n\nA: In addition to the Activity Monitor application, you can also use the top -u command in a terminal window to see the most processor-hungry applications.\n", "Q: Transfer Bootcamp over from a separate hard drive to a partition of a hard drive I have a Macbook Pro with dual hard drives (1tb HD, and a 250gb SSD that I replaced the disk drive with). I have been using the regular HD for my mac and the SSD for my bootcamp. Recently, I found this article explaining how to use the SSD to boost the speed for my mac, as well as my bootcamp. So I want to move everything from the SSD over to a new partition on the HD.\nI have successfully made a bootcamp partition on the HD and the computer reads the partition in the Boot Camp Assistant and Disk Utility, but I am unable to boot up that partition. I simply cannot locate it when going though System Preferences or pressing the option key on startup. The old partition (the one on the SSD and that I want to transfer everything from) is found, but the one I just created on the HD is not found anywhere. I have no idea what the problem could be and I would appreciate any help possible.\nMORE INFO:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I first created the partition (and I tried that twice), the computer rebooted and tried to boot into the new Windows partition, but it got stuck on the blinking cursor and required a force reboot.\n\n*The partition is found on the sidebar of Windows Explorer as well as E: and I can transfer files to E: using Windows Explorer.\n\n*I used to have the single HD with a partition for Windows on it that worked just fine before I got the SSD. I had no problems transferring everything over to the SSD and it has not shown any problems at all.\n\n*The SSD is a Samsung 840 Evo 250gb and the HD is the built-in 1tb 5400-rpm drive that is offered with the Macbook Pro (13\").\n\n\nA: If I read correctly you merely created a partition using bootcamp assistant, which essentially doesn't do anything but create an FAT formatted partition.\nOS X will only show you bootable partitions (meaning partitions it finds a system on). You will first need to copy over your data, either including the system or reinstalling and moving over only certain data you want on the SSD.\nIf you want to do it 1:1 there's also tools like Winclone\n", "Q: characters stick at the beginning of CLI When I press arrow up to search through the command history, some characters always remain at the beginning of the command line.

I'm planning on buying a second-hand iPhone 5 from eBay and then using it as an iPod Touch (when the time comes, I'd like to activate it and use it as an iPhone). I'm not sure how activation works, however, and a few hours of internet searching have yielded several different answers. So far, I've heard that I'd need to get a SIM card matching the carrier of the iPhone, but I've heard some people say that it has to have been used with an iPhone before that?\nSorry for the possible triviality; I'm not too well-versed in Apple products and things. Thanks a ton in advance :)\n\nA: The phone will need to be activated using a valid SIM card. If the device is carrier-locked it will need to be a SIM of that carrier. However you can just take out the SIM after activation and the phone will work fine until you reset it (then it would need to be activated again). \n\nA: You most certainly can use any iPhone without needing an active data connection. You can turn off the Cellular Data to help save some battery life, but the hardware will still use some energy no matter the settings you choose.\nAs to knowing the product, you will need to either risk losing the money, buy it though escrow service, clear things with the buyer and make sure you know who the seller is before paying.\nInsist that the listing clarify two things before bidding is the best practice:\n\n\n*\n\n*That the device is not Activation Locked to an Apple ID.\n\n*Whether the carrier lock is enabled or disabled.\n\n\nHere are some threads to help:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will an iPhone only activate using the SIM card that it was originally activated with?\n\n*Using iPhone as iPod touch\n\n*Is it possible to use an iPhone without a SIM card as an iPod touch?\n\n*How can I bypass Activation Lock?\n\n*How secure is Activation Lock on iOS 7 (and later)?\nLastly, Apple has this advice for people buying a second hand iOS device:\n\n\n*\n\n*Carrier Unlocking - http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5014\n\n*Activation Lock and used devices - http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4515 and http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5661\n", "Q: Can I jailbreak my way out of a passcode request? My father owns an iPad 1. He forgot his numerical access code and tried enough times that the device now reads \"Connect with iTunes.\"\nApple assumes you sync your device frequently with a computer  but the only time I recall him doing that is when he upgraded to iOS 5. iTunes on that computer, however, says \"no can do, put in the code first.\"\nApparently the only way out is to boot in recovery mode and flash the device clean, which means losing permanently access to all apps ever, backwards and forwards in time. (We have been unable to install any new app at all for a year or so.) This means being stuck with a version of Safari that, as you well know, runs out of memory and crashes and burns on most websites.\nHooray.\n\nCan I jailbreak the device now? Would that help me get out of this situation?\n\nA: No.\nYou will need to restore using iTunes. The iPad will completely be factory reset (meaning like it's fresh out of the box). Your personal data on the device will be lost but you can redownload all apps for free using the same Apple ID you bought them with. \nHowever you might run into some issues since the iPad 1 only runs iOS 5 and most apps require iOS 6 nowadays. Some might still be downloadable since Apple added a feature to support old iOS versions parallel (see http://9to5mac.com/2013/09/17/ios-app-store-now-allows-legacy-app-downloads-to-support-older-hardware-and-software/). However this will depend on the App Developer, so you might run into trouble getting some (probably a lot) of Apps back if they are not backed up to your computer.\nSafari isn't an App that can be updated by itself, it comes with iOS, and the version depends on the iOS version.\n\nA: If there is no important data on the iPad itself, perhaps an upgrade to a newer iPad is in order if you and/or your father can afford it. The iPad 1 is rapidly becoming an orphan, and will in time become an important historical icon, just like the Apple ][ and the rainbow Apple logo.\nAs is explained elsewhere on this page, updates to any apps previously purchased will be available in the App Store, where you must provide the original AppleID for proof of purchase.\nYou can trade in the iPad 1 for a $45 Apple Store gift card through Apple's Reuse & Recycling Program. Apple Store US has some decent deals on refurbished iPads  of all kinds and colours, too. If you prefer new items, the least-expensive iPad Mini is $299 retail.\n", "Q: How can I import OS X Mavericks server accounts from a CSV file? I'm trying to create new users on my OSX server by importing short & long names from a CSV file. When I attempt to import the CSV I get the following error:\n\nThe file couldn't be imported because it isn't in the correct format.\n  Import files must be in delimited format and include a header line.\n\nI've taken the spreadsheet file with the list of short & long names and exported it to a csv file. The top row has header fields with \"RealName\" and \"RecordName\". when I open the csv file in another program I can verify that it is comma delimited. What's going on here?\n\nA: Three sources I've poured over when developing my own processes for importing users include: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH15663 and the man pages for dsimport and dsexport.\nFor OD, it appears you have to define the format of the file you're using to import records. While the help page above indicates there are a handful of required attributes, I found I could import just the two fields you described above and the system automatically assigned UID information. \nThe top line of the file being used to import the records defines the format. It includes four hex codes, the record type, the number attributes, and a list of the attributes.\nThe default hex codes work nicely for me:\n0x0A       End of record is indicated by a new line\n0x5C       The escape character is defined as \\\n0x3A       The field separator is a : (not a comma)\n0x2C       Each value in the field is separated by a comma\n\nFor your purpose, the record types are standard users, dsRecTypeStandard:Users.\nYour number of desired attributes is 2, and their values are: RealName and RecordName.\nSo, the file that should work for you is:\n0x0A 0x5C 0x3A 0x2C dsRecTypeStandard:Users 2 RealName RecordName\nUser One:user1\nUser Two:user2\n...\nUser XXX:userX\n\nPlease be aware though that Server.app can fill in some but not all of the missing data. I recommend building an import file that includes all the required attributes.\nAlso, dsimport provides the --template option that obviates the need for field descriptions if your file has all seven standard fields. \nI realize the question is a few months old, but hopefully this will help someone in the future.\n", "Q: How to upload large mobi file to iPad/iPhone I have a 63mb mobi format book.\nNormally I get mobi books to my iPad/iPhone via the email share setting in Calibre.

I can hear the feedback sounds as I navigate around with the remote, so it seems clear that something is happening—I just can't see it. The same is true when using the iOS Remote app. Also, when using the Remote app, I can't \"pull\" media from my computers' iTunes library, I can only \"push\" it from iTunes to the Apple TV.\nThe scrolling-photos screensaver, however, does kick in correctly. That seems like the one internal feature that will show up on my TV.\nI would like to get everything else to work consistently. It has occurred to me that the Apple TV might not like being routed through the AV receiver, although I haven't tested whether changing it would make a difference; I'd prefer to keep it set up this way if possible.\n\nA: As mentioned by cloneman it sounds like there is a Communication Problem between Apple-TV and the Reciver or the Reciver and the TV.\nMaybe its like on my Setup (i have an older TV which doesn't Support a Resolution as high as the AV-Reciver)\nSo if i turn on The TV first than the Reciver than Apple-TV it works as it should. (cause the Reciver starts after TV it knows what Resolution the TV supports - he can ask if not)\nIf i turn on the Reciver first than the TV it doesn't show but audio works (cause the Reciver directly plays the Audio also it gets the Video and passes it out but in a to high Resolution so the TV can't show it)\nMaybe you can try out different sequences of turning on (and find a way that works for you)\nIf not try this (most of todays TV's have more than one Input and also most of the AV-Recivers have at least one SPDIF Input) assuming yours also. Connect Apple-TV via SPDIF to the AV-Reciver and via HDMI to one of the HDMI Inputs of the TV direct.\nSo you give the Apple-TV and the TV the possibility to directly communicate and they should be able to handle out a resolution that works for both.\n", "Q: Create an automator/applescript service that opens a file in an external program Just wondering about some automator/applescript help.\nBasically: I download a MP3 file from an artist (for example)\nIt is saved to my Downloads folder.\nFrom there, I want to open it automatically in an external MP3 tag editor such as this one.\nThen, I will edit the tags and save the file.\nWhen the file is saved, I want to have the newly edited MP3 moved to a folder (my iTunes \"Add Automatically\" folder, Macintosh HD ▸ Users ▸ Steve ▸ Music ▸ iTunes ▸ iTunes Media ▸ Add Automatically to iTunes.\nCurrently I have an Automator workflow that Filter Finder Items and Move Finder Items the mp3 into the iTunes folder, but I want to be able to edit the tags first.

I think that even a macro program (e.g. keyboard maestro ) probably won't trigger on just a mod key. I know that Alfred won't trigger a workflow on a mod key.\nThere is a program called Ukulele that lets you edit your keyboard layout, and that would make it possible to remap your keyboard's behavior to your heart's content, but either you'd need to live with those keys being remapped all the time, or you'd need to select the alternate keyboard you created when you're in Safari.\nLong story short, I think it's possible but will take some work and be annoying.\n", "Q: Itunes Keeps deleting my podcasts I like to download podcasts to my ipod to listen to them at work or at the gym.

Back when people were using mainframe computers, this made sure that the NFS software on the client side was part of the OS/approved by the administrator, since a program can only use a privileged port if it's run by the root user. Today, this makes no sense because anyone can own a computer and have root access, so this doesn't mean anything in terms of security.\nBy default, many NFS servers don't allow non-privileged source ports. Some NFS clients (such as Ubuntu's), default to using a privileged source port unless otherwise specified, which is why your Linux client works without issue. Clearly, the OS X client doesn't do this. I don't know if that was an Apple design choice or something inherited from BSD. I know that Solaris also defaults to a non-privileged port.\nThe two ways of avoiding this problem are, telling the OS X client to use a privileged port, as you discovered, or configuring your NFS server to allow non-privileged ports (look it up in your server's documentation).\nHow do you get OS X to use a privileged port using a GUI? As far as I know, you can't on versions > 10.6. One used to be able to mount NFS shares in Disk Utility and type in extra options, but that was removed. (details) It was never a simple button or anything. NFS is hardly something most of the \"non-techy\" crowd need, so I guess it wasn't a priority and there are reasons routinely using privileged ports isn't a great idea.\nI haven't tried it, but http://www.bresink.com/osx/NFSManager.html seems to allow configuration of OS X's NFS features without the command line.\n", "Q: How to send several pings per second? (ping more quickly) I was looking into pinging a host 5 times per second. I've read the man page for 'ping' for Mac OSX, but I can't find anything that would allow me to do this.

First of all, the Application Level Firewall which can be configured using the system settings. But there is also ipfw, a packet filtering firewall like netfilter/iptables on GNU/Linux and pf (FreeBSD/OpenBSD).\nYou can either configure ipfw using the command line, or using a graphical front-end like the free/libre WaterRoof.\nYou could start with an ipfw command like:\nsudo ipfw add 31010 allow tcp from any to any dst-port 8080\n\n\nA: ipfw is deprecated by Apple. Mountain Lion and later use pfctl. \nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht5413\n\nA: I had the same issue under OS X Yosemite (10.10.3).  Found this blog post that provides clear instructions.  We can't use ipfw any more, as it's deprecated.  Instead, use pfctl, which unfortunately lacks a nice command line way to tell it to open a port.  Instead, you need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open /etc/pf.conf in a text editor.\n\n*Add a line like this: \n\n\n\n# Open port 8080 for TCP on all interfaces\npass in proto tcp from any to any port 8080\n\n\n\n*Save the file.\n\n*Load the changes with:\n\n\n\nsudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf\n\nIf you need to open a udp port, change tcp to udp, if you need both, add a second line.  Additional detail can be found in man pf.conf.\nAlso make sure your server is listening on the actual interface you want it accessible over (or all interfaces, using 0.0.0.0 or ::0), not localhost (127.0.0.1 or ::1).\n\nA: Here's a one liner rather than requiring the user to mess around with Vim. Useful for automation.\nsed -i '' -e '$a\\pass in proto tcp from any to any port 8080' /etc/pf.conf; pfctl -vnf /etc/pf.conf\n\nOr an alternative for Linux users\nsed -i -e '$a\\pass in proto tcp from any to any port 8080' /etc/pf.conf; pfctl -vnf /etc/pf.conf\n\nJust make sure you change 8080 in the example to whatever you have in mind. Swap tcp with udp if you like.\n", "Q: Cannot connect to Linked In on Chrome or Safari on OS-X SSL Issue I tried fixing the issue of not being able to access LinkedLn by installing lots of certs from DigiCert in my Keychain and while that fixed LinkedIn, I then couldn't go to Github.com.

That just sounds like a bad idea. Without the chain of trust to confirm the provenance of the certificates it just seems like too much of a risk.\nOne option is to visit DigiCert's site and download the specific DigiCert certificates that are missing and install them. You appear to still have the High Assurance EV Root CA certificate installed that the site uses, so you can be confident that you are downloading them from the proper source. Just download the file and open them, Keychain should launch and accept them.\nhttps://www.digicert.com/digicert-root-certificates.htm\nI'd also recommend running Keychain First Aid. You can find it on Keychain's application menu.\n\nA: I ran into a similar issue just the other day, only in Safari.\nAn HTTPS site kept popping up a list of certificates to click on and then continue or cancel, it never went through. What I found is that the certificate in the keychain was damaged, deleting those certs in the keychain utility fixed the issue.\nBEFORE YOU DO THAT Backup your keychain, just in case.\n", "Q: Using Yosemite for web development I am eager to try out the new Yosemite beta, but the confidentiality agreement somewhat startles me.\nI know I cannot disclose any confidential information about the OS or post screenshots of it anywhere, but what else does that imply? I am a web developer and I use my Macbook for surfing the web, listening to music, programming and web development in general. Can I still do all these things (and the rest of everyday stuff) if I update to the Yosemite beta? What are the legal limitations of using Yosemite?\nWhat I'm asking is can I still produce websites, web software and etc. at work using Yosemite Beta as a development environment?\n\nA: From my personal experience, Yosemite isn't really too bad in terms of bugginess. It's quite unlikely that you will suffer data loss, but take backups as always. I have had no more problems running on Yosemite than Mavericks (aside from some cosmetic issues related to Dark Mode and reducing transparency).\nThat said, it really depends on what you use for web development. TextMate, iTerm, and Xcode work really well, but if you've got another IDE running you might want to  wait until you know it works well with Yosemite. I'm also a big fan of Alfred and Karabiner, both of which have official support for it.\nAlso, what reason do you have to run Yosemite? Even if it is low risk, it isn't worth the trouble to just be able to use the flashy new GUI.\nThe legal limitations are pretty severe, however:\n\n[…] don’t blog, post screen shots, tweet or publicly post information about the pre-release Apple software, and don't discuss the pre-release Apple software with or demonstrate it to others who are not in the OS X Beta Program.\n\nIn a work environment it's going to be difficult to avoid discussing or demonstrating it to people not in the program.\nSo in this instance, it's probably a good idea to wait until 10.10 is publicly released, as Apple also warns against using it on production machines or business-critical ones.\n\nA: There is nothing in the beta program terms and conditions that preclude you from using the OS fully - connecting to the internet at large and with whatever programs you care to install and run on Yosemite.\nThe only prohibition I see is that you not blog opinions, details and/or post screenshots of the product while it is in a beta status (and presumably you would be bound to not share the beta versions anywhere - but I don't see that addressed explicitly). If you can keep quiet about the software, you should have no problem honoring your end of the bargain as Apple describes it publicly. Be sure you read any terms carefully in case my impression (or the publicly available terms) isn't the only thing you agree to when you enroll in the program.\n", "Q: Bonjour (Printing service) run on Sleep I currently use Bonjour for my home wireless printing. It works flawlessly, but I have one gripe with software. If my iMac (pc connected to the printer) goes to sleep, the wireless print stops. Is there anyway if the printing can work while the mac sleeps. I understand why Apple did this to conserve power, but my iMac is always connected to power, and running things on the background. Any help, greatly appreciated. :)\n\nA: To keep wireless printing available, you need to stop your Mac from sleeping.\nTo disable sleep on Mac OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch System Preferences.app from the Applications folder.\n\n*Select Energy Saver\n\n*Move the Computer sleep: slider to Never.\n\n\n\n", "Q: Run an AppleScript that requires keystrokes while the screen is locked?

This means that when my script tells TextEdit to activate, the computer pops up its login window and thinks I'm typing \"Hello World!\" as a password. Not ideal. \nI tried making the screen saver require a password after 5 seconds, instead of immediately, but that was no good: the process of activating TextEdit just wakes up the screen again.\nIs there a way to activate TextEdit and type words into it in the background, without making my computer think I'm trying to unlock the screen? \n\nA: No i'don't think you can do this the way you want.\n\n\n*\n\n*Every Human interaction on a PC during Screensaver tries to deactivate it. (Like moving the Mouse, pressing a Key e.g.) \n\n*Applescript most time is used to Script some GUI (like in your case --> tell application TextEdit -> does nothing other than opening Textedit like you would do it by double clicking)\nSo to bring you a way which should work:\ndo a applescript which writes the text to a file directly and then open the file with the text in it if needed.\nsomething like this:\ntell application System Events\n    do shell script \"echo 'your text that you wanna type' > /path/to/the/file/where/the/text/stands/in\"\nend tell\n\ntell application TextEdit\n    open /path/to/the/file/where/the/text/stands/in\nend tell\n\n\nA: Have you tried (I don't know if it'll work):\nactivate application \"TextEdit\"\ndelay 0.2\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"TextEdit\" to keystroke \"Hello World!\"\n\n", "Q: Setup Exchange account on Mail.app on only one mac I want to configure an exchange account on a Macbook.

You could reboot if you want to be sure things are reset.\n", "Q: What are the trusted Certificate Authorities in iOS? I'm wondering if StartCom is a trusted CA on iOS.\nI'd like to setup a mail server for a TLD, and use their free certificate. It's only about $10/year cheaper than more well known authorities, so the deciding factor is if it's trusted on my iPhone.\nI know it is on OS X, Windows and many linux distributions, but would like to be certain.\n\nA: I think this Apple support article has the list you're looking for.

The problem is that the bicycle path does not exist on Apple's maps so the IPhone moves the gps position to the closest road.\n\n(I ride along the blue path)\nThis is not a single incident. It looks the same every time except if I turn off mobile data. However, turning off mobile data only work occationally.

So if you forget to set Safari Developer Program to \"No access\" for instance, the button \"Send Invitation\" stays disabled. \n\nA: Select No Access on Safari Developer Program. You must select an option for Safari Developer Program even if it doesn't matter to you.\n\nA: The solution I took was to use another e-mail address. One of the reason could be that I already had an account associated with that e-mail address. Or the name of the e-mail address was too long so that the regex failed.

This isn't very apparent with simple spreadsheets but formulas that reference other tables use the table name to find the cell. The table name can't be removed as its required for these cross-table formulas.\nI recommend naming all your tables, even if you then hide the table name, so that you don't end up with a bunch of formulas referencing table 7 from table 4 and table 6 from table 2.\n", "Q: How to create a recovery key for an encrypted disk image? FileVault 2 is computing a recovery key when I decide to activate this security mode. This recovery key is a mandatory safety belt when someone wants to use serious cryptography.\nIs it possible to create a recovery key in the same way for a crypted disk image created with Disk Utility or hdiutil?\nI'm searching a solution around hdiutil for Lion, Mountain Lion, Mavericks and which could stand on future versions of MacOS X.\n\nA: It is possible to do this using hdiutil and openssl.  The essence of the solution is to use the -certificate option of hdiutil.  This field expects a DER formatted certificate that will be used during the encryption.  The certificate can be used later to decrypt the volume via the -recover option of hdutil. \n10 year duration is used on the certificates below, you could use longer terms if desired.  I haven't tested the effect of an expired certificate on the ability to decrypt the volume.\nFully test that you can decrypt using the recovery certificate before entrusting the encrypted volume with your data!\nThe steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Certificate Authority (CA) that will be used to sign your recovery certificate.  You will be asked for a password.  This should be unique for this signing key.  The CA created can be used to sign many certificates.\n% openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 4096\n% openssl req -new x509 -days 3650 -key ca.key -out ca.crt\n\n\n*Create a password protected certificate signing request (csr).  The password requested in this step is your \"recovery key\".\n% openssl genrsa -des3 -out recovery.key 4096\n% openssl req -new -key recovery.key -out recovery.csr\n\n\n*Create the signed certificate in PEM format.\n% openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in recovery.csr \\\n-CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out recovery.crt\n\n\n*Convert the signed certificate to DER format\n% openssl x509 -in recovery.crt -inform pem \\\n-out recovery.der -outform der\n\n\n*Bundle the PEM certificate and private key into a PKCS#12 package. This package can be later imported into the keychain on a mac where a volume needs to be recovered. Protect this package as it can be used to access any volume encrypted using the contained certificate. For example, put it onto a thumb drive that is kept in a secure location.\n% openssl pkcs12 -export -in recovery.crt -inkey recovery.key -out recovery.p12\n\n\n*Use hdiutil with both the -agentpass and -certificate options to create the encrypted volume.\n% hdiutil create -type SPARSE -encryption aes-256 \\\n-certificate ~/recovery.der -agentpass -fs HFS+J \\\n-volname \"Secure Docs\" -size 20g ~/Secure\n\nMore discussion on this topic can be found at: http://thelowedown.wordpress.com/2008/11/27/data-encryption-for-mac-osx-sparse-images-with-enterprise-recovery/\nThe directions above are a combination of my own notes on creating certificates for websites plus instructions at the site above.\n", "Q: Creating a URL that always opens in Chrome If I want to ensure a URL, if clicked, will always open in Chrome (instead of the default browser) can I do that by modifying the header?\nFor example, I can get URLs that always open in Evernote, they start with evernote:/// \nIs this possible, for example to have something like chrome:///www.url.com\n\nA: On iOS:\ngooglechrome://www.example.com\n\n\nA: Google has official documentation on the Chrome iOS app’s URI scheme on its developer website.\nSimply replace http with googlechrome and https with googlechromes. This means:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.google.com/ becomes googlechrome://www.google.com/\n\n*https://apple.stackexchange.com/ becomes googlechromes://apple.stackexchange.com/\nPreviously, it supported an x-callback-url of googlechrome-x-callback://. This allowed the calling app to indicate its name and URI scheme to Chrome, which would show a back button in the address bar that closes the tab and invokes the specified URI. This feature was removed a few years ago when iOS 9 added the “Back to …” button in the status bar (but the URI scheme still works).\n", "Q: Where is a good place to share automator files I've had a request to share an Automator workflow I made.

I may need a separate question for that.\nMore Info for Anyone Else with This Problem\nThe root cause of this issue appears to be Apple's application sandbox. Apparently attempting to script it in this way doesn't work with the sandbox, but \"open\" goes through the proper channels to satisfy whatever requirements the sandbox has.\n\nA: I have tested this a bit in my free time today, and it seems that subprocess.call(['open','-a','Preview',path]) is your best option for opening PDFs in Preview from Python. \nI'm still not sure why using the absolute path to Preview doesn't work, though.\nI am trying to find a way to get a process PID based on its window title in AppleScript. For example, if you were to open a document named \"Test.png\" in Preview with that command, it would spawn a Preview window with the window title \"Test\". I am hoping there is a way to get the PID of this process using the window title, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nA: It seems Preview sometimes gets confused with pemissions.

When I go into Finder and change its name to config.yml.old, it appears to have changed the extension. However, opening the file in TextWrangler reveals that Mac has just appended a \"hidden\" .yml at the end, causing the filename to be config.yml.old.yml.\nRight now, the only way I can append an extension is by going to Terminal and running mv path/to/config.yml path/to/config.yml.old. Is there actually a way to use the GUI to do this?\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to Finder\n\n*open Finder Preferences\n\n*Uncheck \"Show warning before changing an extension\"\n\n\nOptionally, check \"Show all filename extensions\" to verify that Mac did not automatically append extensions when you add your own.\n", "Q: Moving terminal version of python to homebrew version python -V shows that I am on 2.7.7 but brew upgrade python shows I have 2.7.8 so clearly my terminal isn't looking at the Homebrew version. How do I fix this?\n\nA: Check if /usr/local/bin is in your PATH and that it's before /usr/bin. In the terminal:\necho $PATH\n\nI believe brew doctor will warn you about this if it's not. Basically, if it's not, the system will look in /usr/bin first instead of /usr/local/bin, which is where homebrew links everything.\nFor bash, you just need to add:\nexport PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH\n\nto your ~/.bash_profile file.\n", "Q: Audio jack converter for iPhones I purchased a set of studio headphones from Audio Technica. Turns out, the pin is 3.5 mm and is too big for my iPhone 5. Is there some sort of adapter that I can buy that will convert the pin to the one for an iPhone? (Links to the suitable product at RadioShack would be appreciated :)) \n\nA: The iPhone jack is 3.5mm.\nYou probably have the 1/4 inch (6.3mm) and that is why it does not fit.\nWhen looking for a adapter make sure it has 3 black rings and not 2. That is the iPhone required plug.\n", "Q: Is there a way to specify that a certain app always stay in memory? I notice sometimes when I open the Reminders app (after not having opened it for a while), it takes a second to load. This is presumably because it is no longer in memory and loading from SSD. Is there a way I can tell OS X to never remove Reminders from memory?\nP.S. I minimize Reminders, not close it. Which is why it sometimes stays in memory.\n\nA: You can not set the application priority (to remain in the RAM). \nYour system automatically manages the resources based on current usage.\nHowever, depending on your Reminders settings, and what external (Internet) accounts you use, it might take a moment for it to check those accounts.\n", "Q: Some applications have grey menu bar When running (for example) a java application (Minecraft) in it's own space (in Mavericks) the menu bar disappears, but then a grey bar appears on top of the space.\nIs there anyway to fix this? It happens in Eclipse as well. Immediately after giving it its own space it's fine, but after the screen saver or sleep mode (I am unsure what set of events causes the problem in Eclipse) it shows up.\n\nA: Not entirely sure but Mavericks introduced a menu bar on all screens. It may be that these programs are not aware of this feature. EG they need an update for this to be fixed. Check the forums for this manufacturer.\n", "Q: Macbook power adapter issue: PPP003 I'm using Macbook Pro 15\" Retina Late 2013. OS is Yosemite Public beta. Once in month I usually do diagnostics (Apple's boot time diagnostics, the when you press \"D\" ). The last the when I did it, I got PPP003 error code which was something like that: \"Battery may not be charged. Try to disconnect MagSafe 2 power adapter ...\"\nThing is, it charges well my laptop but both adapter and it's ending are heating. Adapter heating really bad but ending a bit less. \nMy question is if I use it like that, can it damage my laptop? Is it important to change adapter immediately or not to change at all? \n\nA: I have the exact same model and had the same issue. \nOriginally, I took the generic troubleshooting steps (reset SMC, unplug let sit, etc.). Didn't work. I then used isopropyl alcohol to clean both the magsafe adapter pins and the magsafe input on the machine. Ran the test again (multiple times) and no error occurred. This was a temporary solution. \nA few weeks later, it occurred again so I opened a case # with Apple and took it into the Apple Store Genius Bar. The machine passed Apple's in-house diagnostics. They swapped out the Magsafe charger with a new one and the issue is yet to re-occur (been ~3 weeks). \nI asked them the same question about the battery and they did not give me an answer (they don't \"speculate\"). I assume, however, that if it's incorrectly charging the battery for many cycles, the battery would be affected. \nIn short, temporary fix = isopropyl alcohol to clean the pins on adapter itself and in MBP. Actual fix = defective charger/hub, both of which covered under Warranty. Go to Apple for definitive diagnosis and receive either new charger or get machine serviced.\nAlso: it's completely normal for the adapter to get very hot when connected to the machine and charging. \n\nA: This is a bug in apple diagnostics. \nYour battery has to be fully charged (green magsafe led) when running the test to prevent that error. The error appears only in the ONLINE version 1.0.10r2. \nThe original OFFLINE version 1.0 that came with your MBP is working correctly.\nDon't worry about the adapter it's normal that it heats up, nothing is wrong with it.\n", "Q: Lost game progress after reinstalling app despite app having Game Center integration I used to play The Sims Freeplay on my iPad, but after playing the game for a week I deleted it, but I did not remove it from Game Center. I re-installed the game, but I couldn't continue my progress. Game Center is still showing the progress of my old account, but I couldn't continue it. Does Game Center save my The Sims Freeplay progress?\nIf it doesn't, why did it save for my Clash of Clans account? I re-installed the game and I still can continue my progress.\n\nA: Game Center only saves games achievements; it never saves game progress. Game developers use different methods to store your progress:\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud Storage: Your data are stored locally on your iCloud account. Usually you just have to reinstall the game and you'll be able to continue the game without problems. E.g. Pocket Planes\n\n*Facebook Connect: The developers will connect your Facebook account and associate the game progress with your Facebook account. As long you don't delete your Facebook account, the progress is always be available once you connect the game with your Facebook account. E.g. The Sims Freeplay\n\n*Games Account: Companies like Gameloft let you save progress to your Gameloft account. You'll need to create a separate account for these type of games. EA Games and Gameloft are the common type of company that use this approach to let customers manage their games across devices.\n", "Q: Photo printing from mac What is the best way to print photos from Mac and pick them up manually in a local shop?

The monitor works just fine and has no problems with other computers, it's just that the macbook is apparently slightly crazy.\nThe wireless connection appears to be working just fine, but the connection has over 80% packet loss and/or have a latency of multiple seconds when the monitor is connected. The access point is a 2013 time capsule which has no problems as far as I know.\nSpecs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Monitor: Dell 2007FP connected through DVI with the converter shown below\n\n*Laptop: Macbook Pro Retina 15\" 2012\n\n*Thunderbolt to DVI/HDMI/Displayport converter (http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mini-Displayport-Adapter-Cable-Thunderbolt/dp/B0093UCXEO)\n\n\n\n\nA: I had the same problem with a secondary dell monitor. Changing the frequency of the dell display from 60Hz to 50Hz solved the seems to have solved the issue. My guess is that wifi on the recent MacBooks have wifi antenna built into the display module and connecting HDMI with my dell display somehow causes EMC interference which hampers wifi performance. Lowering the frequency seems to fix that problem.\n\nA: It took a while for a new mini-displayport to DVI adapter to ship, but I have a new one now and no more problems. Apparently these type of converters can cause problems with Macbooks (the entire machine was hanging at times).\nSo if anyone has problems when connecting something through mini-displayport, know that it might just be low quality stuff and your apple might not like it ;)\nUPDATE\nTurns out that the new adapter didn't solve everything yet and it was also a hardware defect. Apple replaced pretty much all of the parts in the laptop (only component that wasn't replaced was the ssd) and after that it has been working with a lot less problems. The current wifi issues that I have are probably just related to Yosemite which appears unable to keep a stable connection for more than a few hours. \n\nA: Had similar issue, MacBook Pro would lose internet (wifi) connection once I plugged into Dell monitor via HDMI connection.  After some trial and error, found that changing the Thunderbolt Display (2) setting Resolution to \"default for display\" solved the issue.\n\nA: The problem is due to interference as pointed by some answers above between ShitBook's wifi and dongle/adapter/monitor/cable. I resolved it by using my cappo as a ferrite core (needs to be metallic though).\n\n\nA: I was having the same issue with a Mini-Displayport to DVI adapter.  Based on some odd advice on the apple forums I tried this:  Switched DVI display from native resolution to next step lower.  Boom, internet turns back on.  Weird stuff, but posting here in case anyone else has this issue.\n\nA: Try changing the wifi channel. Worked for me. \nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/4155096?start=60&tstart=0\n\nMine was also fixed by changing to channel 1 (D-Link router was set to\n  auto-select and was using channel 5).  I'm NOT using thunderbolt. My\n  old configuration:\n-MacBook 3,1 (that's right 2007!)\n-Mini-DVI to DVI to Dell2001FP (lid not closed--spanned, not mirrored)\nWifi immediately stops working with external monitor connected with\n  native 1600x1200 60Hz.

But after trying everything everyone has said I plug into the internet through ethernet cable and it fixed it.\n\nA: After many days of tryna fix it, I tried the \"wrapping the wire with a foil\" method but it didn't work. What worked though is instead of plugging the usb c hub on the left side of my Macbook Pro '15 2017, I plugged it on the right side and it all worked. The wifi was working again and internet was fast. I'm charging it on the left side though.\nIt's just weird cause literally back when I was plugging it on the left side, the wifi/ internet would stop working automatically and once I unplug my macbook pro to my monitor, wifi would come back... I wonder if it's like a factory defect on macbooks or just the usb hub itseld idk lol. Anyway, glad I fixed it and hopefully this helps!\n\nA: I faced the same issue with third party adapters. The issue got resolved with original Apple HDMI to Thunderbolt adapter.\nLink: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7872207\n\nA: In my case I was hanging the HDMI adapter to the side of the table. When I put it on a flat surface with wire parallel to my mac, it started working.\n\nA: I had the same issue with Dell monitor with DVI output port. I was using an DVI-HDMI cable and a HDMI-USB-C adapter as I have the 2018 MacBookPro. I discovered that was because of the adapter HDMI-USB-C I was using which was not from Apple but from 'NetworkX'. I bought the apple adaptor HDMI to USB-C and use same cheap cable DVI-HDMI and worked. I think that that Apple has also DVI-HDMI cable but didn't try yet. It might be worth trying also with a cheaper adapter from ICY for instances, given that my MacBook Pro is working well with such an adaptor on the HP monitor but with an HDMI output port. \n\nA: I had the exact same problem - 2017 i7 MacBook Pro as soon as I upgraded to a 4k display and WiFi stopped working.  It was the dongle - I didn't even change the brand - I switched from the dedicated StarTech Thunderbolt 3 to DP that I had \"borrowed\" from my old HD display (which obviously caused problems) to the newer one I carry around with me (an all-in-one StarTech version that has all different types of outputs).  I used it as a Thunderbolt 3 to mini DP dongle and it worked fine.  The newer StarTech dongle is a rather bulky one with 4 outputs and because of its size, it probably has more shielding and therefore works well.\n\nA: I would suggest looking at the Service Order in System Preferences > Network.\nIt's possible that MacOS sees these Thunderbolt adaptors as a Thunderbolt Bridge network connection, and that this takes priority over WiFi, even if not a viable connection.\n\nThat's the only way I can think of that a video connector could affect the network.\n\nA: I came across this same issue on my 2016 MBP. I have had a two monitor plus laptop setup for years with no connectivity issues, then updated to MacOS Monterey 12.6 and suddenly could not get any wifi signal with either monitor plugged in. Tried all of the above suggestions (tin foil, ferrous core, changing sides and adapters, adjusting resolution/frequency of monitors, changing router channel) to no avail.\nHowever, I tried a NVRAM (non-volatile RAM) reset by holding Command+Option+P+R on restart and this did the trick. Glad to have finally got my internet back and hope this helps someone else!\n\nA: I just upgraded from a MacBook Pro 15\" 2014 to a MacBook Pro 16\" 2023 with M2 Pro and I am having this issue lol.\nGoing to try another cable as the HDMI cord I am using now is some knock-off 3-foot cable.\n\nA: One fine moment as soon as i unplugged the external display connected via an vga to type c adapter the internet started working. I don't know the theory behind this but its a truth that the adapter can cause the issue.\n", "Q: Trouble with my partitions I have some trouble with my partitions on my Macbook Pro.\nI created 2 partitions. One named \"Yo\" where I have installed Yosemite release. Another one named \"Save\" where I put all the stuffs I need to keep secure for work.\nI want to create a 3rd one to re-install Mavericks just because one of my app is not working on Yosemite.\nThe trouble is that I can't do it through the Disk Utility GUI because everything is disabled.

You can manipulate them from the command line, but the easiest thing to do is just revert it to a normal partition (in the terminal):\ndiskutil coreStorage revert /dev/disk1\n\nThis shouldn't cause data loss, but as always when working with partitions, back up anything you can't afford to lose. Once it's a normal partition, you should be able to manipulate it in Disk Utility again.\nSee man diskutil for more information.\n", "Q: App Exposé Window Ordering? When App Exposé shows my browser windows (i.e., 4-finger swipe down or Control-↓), the order of the windows changes from one time to the next, and I cannot find the window I'm looking for easily. (What I'm really after is an efficient way to flip back and forth between the two or three most recently used windows in an application, but that's another story.) Can anyone tell me if there is any logic to the ordering of the application windows in App Exposé, or if it is just random?\n\nA: I myself was looking for the answer to this this afternoon, but unfortunately it wasn't answered here, so I tried to figure it out myself with some experimentation, and this answer is what I came up with.  FYI, I was doing this with OS 10.9 with somewhere between 2-9 windows open.\nThe application windows, in what I'll call \"view mode\", are presented, more or less, in a rectangular grid.  If I have 8 windows open, view mode is a 2x4 grid.  The main preference for the algorithm seems to be to try to approximate the relative positions of the windows on the screen.  If the windows are cleanly ordered on the screen, then the position of the windows in view mode will be completely determined by their order on screen (e.g., the top left window will be the top left window), regardless of how they are layered (e.g., which is currently on top (in front)).\nHowever, it often happens, particularly if you have a lot of overlapping windows open, that their positions cannot be cleanly put in a rectangular grid.  (Think about the case where you have 2 windows open, one small and one big, where the small window is positions completely in the center of the big window.)  In this case, the layering comes into play.  I tried with just 2 windows of the same size open, occupying the exact same position on screen.  In this case the one in front (on top) appeared on the left.  (If they were not in the same position, which one is currently in front does not affect this.)  \nNow if you have many windows open, and there is a lot of overlapping with ill-defined relative positioning, then these rules combine in a way such that changing which windows are in front may not change the order in the \"view mode\" at all, or it can mix things up quite a bit, so that the order changes in an apparently random way.  My guess is that the order in view mode is completely determined by the \"3-d positions\" of the windows (2-d positions on screen + positions in layers), but it becomes complicated to understand completely when you have more than a few windows open.\n", "Q: Find, compare, delete duplicate music files with Terminal I am trying to clean up my iTunes.

I have several linux/bsd hosts already connected to the domain via ldap and mapping the uid/gid/secondary groups properly.\nI'm running a few mac's on 10.9 and 10.10 beta, I'm trying to figure out if its possible to map secondary Group IDs to the AD UnixGID and not the GID that AD creates..\nfor example, if i run id mikedevita on a linux box it gives me this:\n% id mikedevita                                                                                                                                                         \nuid=40001(mikedevita) gid=30000(Domain Users) groups=30001(Domain   Admins),30002(VMWareAdmins)\n,30003(VPNUsers),30004(LinuxUsers),30005(media),30006(LinuxAdmins),30000(Domain Users)\n\nif i run the same command, id mikedevita on my mac it gives this: \nbase% id mikedevita\nuid=40001(mikedevita) gid=30000 groups=30000,701(com.apple.sharepoint.group.2),519395259(DEVITA\\media),693256891(DEVITA\\MacAdmins),703(com.apple.sharepoint.group.4),501(access_bpf),599473300(DEVITA\\VPNUsers),613468898(DEVITA\\VMWareAdmins),12(everyone),62(netaccounts),79(_appserverusr),80(admin),81(_appserveradm),1446817776(DEVITA\\Domain Admins),401(com.apple.sharepoint.group.1),1873589173(DEVITA\\RouterAdmins),416683223(DEVITA\\Denied RODC Password Replication Group),206(com.apple.access_loginwindow),702(com.apple.sharepoint.group.3),33(_appstore),98(_lpadmin),100(_lpoperator),204(_developer),398(com.apple.access_screensharing),399(com.apple.access_ssh)\n\nas you can see, the uid, and gid fields are mapped properly (40001, 30000) but all of the domain level groups which the user belongs to as secondary groups don't use the right group ID.\nIs there a way to remap this?\n\nA: It sounds like you have the user records' gid attribute mapped, but not the group records' gid. You can check this from the command line with dsconfigad:\n$ sudo dsconfigad -show\n[...]\nAdvanced Options - Mappings\n  Mapping UID to attribute       = uidNumber\n  Mapping user GID to attribute  = gidNumber\n  Mapping group GID to attribute = gidNumber\n  Generate Kerberos authority    = Enabled\n[...]\n\nNote the \"Mapping group GID to attribute = gidNumber\" -- that's what I think you're missing. You can set it from the command line with sudo dsconfigad -ggid gidNumber, on with the GUI program /System/Library/CoreServices/Directory Utility.app (click the padlock to authenticate as admin, double-click the Active Directory connector, click the triangle to \"Show Advanced Options\", click the Mappings tab, then enable \"Map group HID to attribute\" and set it to \"gidNumber\").\n\nA: It seems to me that when you don’t explicitly map the gidNumber attribute, it maps the PrimaryGroupID to gid. That’s why you are getting different numbers. \n", "Q: How do I migrate my Keychain's \"Local Items\" to a new Mac? After preforming a Mavericks-Mavericks migration using Migration Assistant, I have a \"Local Items\" Keychain on my new machine in which many (perhaps most) items are out of date (using old passwords), and some are missing altogether.

Online resources suggest this should not be the case. Adding a delay between keystrokes didn't help.\nWhat might be causing this or how can I determine what might be causing this?\nSmall side question: in AppleScript terminology, what is keystroke? A function, command, something else?\n\nA: Have a look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18136567/applescript-keystroke-not-behaving-as-expected  & the list of ANSI codes at \nHow do I automate a key press in AppleScript?\nIt appears you're not the only one with the issue. One solution on there was to use the key code instead...\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    key code {18} using {command down}\n\nIt may depend on what app you're trying to send the keystrokes to - I just tested with an already-open blank document in Text Edit using \ntell application \"TextEdit\" to activate\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke \"abc 123\"\nend tell\n\n& it worked as expected.\nA keystroke is the scripted equivalent of actually pressing that/those keys[s]\nHow about...\ntell application \"TextEdit\" to activate\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke \"abc\"\n    keystroke space\n    keystroke \"123\"\nend tell\n\n\nA: Some more info about this issue that I've discovered is that when using keystroke with numbers, the System Events always sends them as ANSI_Keypad# characters (code 82-92) instead of what you might expect as ANSI_# characters (code 18-29).\nFor most Mac applications, this does not matter as OS X itself does not care about (use, support, etc) the NUMLOCK function on a Keypad, therefore the Keypad numbers are seen the same as keyboard numbers.  However, it will pass the NUMLOCK keypress to the application if you have a keyboard/keypad that has this key.\nThere are a few applications that do monitor the NUMLOCK key (for example, VMware Fusion application when running a Windows VM) and will change the behavior based on the NUMLOCK state.\nSo for example, if the AppleScript sends keystroke \"456\" to a NUMLOCK aware application.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the NUMLOCK state is ON, the numbers \"456\" will appear.\n\n*If the NUMLOCK state is OFF, the equivalent keys received are Left Arrow 5 Right Arrow\nIn the original question, the AppleScript sent abc 123 but most likely his application (which was not mentioned) was aware of the NUMLOCK state, which was currently OFF, and therefore executed the keys as abc [space] End Down Arrow Page Down\nI put together a little AppleScript function that loops through the given string sending key code commands for any numbers and keystroke commands for any other characters.\non numberAsKeycode(theString)\n  tell application \"System Events\"\n    repeat with currentChar in (every character of theString)\n      set cID to id of currentChar\n      if ((cID ≥ 48) and (cID ≤ 57)) then\n        key code {item (cID - 47) of {29, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 22, 26, 28, 25}}\n      else\n        keystroke currentChar\n      end if\n    end repeat\n  end tell\nend numberAsKeycode\n\nset myString to \"abc 123\"\nnumberAsKeycode(myString)\n\nWhich executes the following\ntell application \"System Events\"\n  keystroke \"a\"\n  keystroke \"b\"\n  keystroke \"c\"\n  keystroke \" \"\n  key code {18}\n  key code {19}\n  key code {20}\nend tell\n\nHope this helps :)\n\nA: As @user271866, I was having this problem and discovered that it was \"Enable Mouse Keys\" being checked in System Preferences that was affecting the behavior of keystroke.\nI had an automator service I had been using to enter search terms into spotlight and copy & paste the result.  When I got a new computer, I installed the service.  I remembered also turning on mouse keys during the setup and as luck would have it, before I first ran the service today on this new computer, my Magic Mouse 2 battery died and I used mouse keys to to connect my old Magic Mouse.  I then encountered erratic behavior from the service when I tried it.  On a hunch, I tried disabling mouse keys and running the service and it worked!  It pasted the numbers along with the rest of the string.\nOne thing to note is, it's not just numbers.  Other characters on the numeric keypad (but not all) also will not get \"typed out\" by keystroke.  . and / also will not work in a string supplied to keystroke.  I thus modified @Insomniac_Software's code to create a working replacement/wrapper for the keystroke function:\n--This is a replacement for the keystroke function, which fails when \"Enable Mouse Keys\" is checked in System Preferences -> Accessibility -> Mouse & Trackpad.

I currently have MiniKeePass on my iPhone and although it does the basic job of storing passwords, I don't have the ability to create random passwords from the app itself and sync the changes to Dropbox. \nI'm looking for a subscription-free iOS app that had a clean, modern and beautifully designed UI. \nAny suggestions?\n\nA: KeePass is a free, open source, and cross platform password manager, which has the benefit that your password file can be used on multiple devices (Linux, Windows, OSX, iOS and Android). I usually use DropBox to sync the password database between my devices.\nUnfortunately the official binary on OSX required an X Server, which made it awkward to use compared to it's competitors.\nFortunately there is MacPass, which is a native port of KeePass for OSX. While it's not as well known as 1Password, it is however free and open source, meaning that you can (potentially) check it's source code, if you don't believe it's secure enough, or contains hidden backdoors. \nAlso since it's a KeePass port, it can open and edit your MiniKeePass files as well.\n\nA: I use 1Password which is available for macOS (AppStore or directly from AgileBits), iOS, Windows and Android and offers both requirements you've listed (random passwords and Dropbox syncing).\n\nA: OS X and iOS come with Keychain built-in. The passwords are automatically synced between your Mac and iOS device. You can access the passwords on both. \nI've used a number of the password managers mentioned in the comments, even the insanely overpriced 1Password, and, though some may have slightly slicker UIs than Keychain, nothing compares on iOS with Keychain's auto-fill. The closest match on iOS would be iCab browser's password fill and services option, but to get full functionality you'd have to also be using iCab browser on OS X and the desktop version simply isn't up to snuff. \n\nA: Locko by BinaryNights\n\n*\n\n*Mac app is on sale for $0.99\n\n*iOS app is expected to be released soon\n\n*Clean, OS X Yosemite influenced design\n\n*Dropbox sync\n\nDescription from the Mac App Store:\n\nLocko is a beautiful and easy-to-use password manager and file vault. You can store confidential information such as web logins, credit card data, computer accounts, software licenses, private pictures and documents, and much more. Locko supports iCloud and Dropbox so you can keep your data synchronized across multiple computers while maintaining absolute security.\n• Secure AES-256 encryption\n• Configurable password generator\n• Web Logins, Credit Cards, Bank Accounts, Software Licenses, and so much more…\n• File vault\n• Photo album\n• Secure Notes\n• Custom fields (text, password, date, secure text)\n• Search in all fields\n• Unlimited item groups\n• Browser extensions for Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera\n• 1 click login for websites\n• QuickLook encrypted documents\n• iCloud and Dropbox synchronisation\n• Import from 1Password\n• Export database in JSON format\n\n\nA: Use KeePass. Does the job for me.\n\nKeePass is a free open source password manager, which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key file. So you only have to remember one single master password or select the key file to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known (AES and Twofish).\n\n\nA: You can also use text/edit app tool(you can find Text/Edit app in launch pad under other section) and type in for example \"Stack Exchange Account Information:\", then hit enter, and below that you can type \"email address:\", then type name of it, hit enter then type \"Password:\", then go to your web browser and you can go to https://randompasswordgen.com , then be sure to include symbols in your password and be sure your password is strong. strong passwords are long up to 128 by example, a password containing 2048 characters long is what can be called unbelievable passwords, but that can be saved in text edit document, but you may wanna create new folder to put you document into. and you may want a usb flash drive to store the folder container containing the account information which would include your password. so what you can do is, in https://randompasswordgen.com, in my opinion and recommendation go for 50 characters long, check mark symbols, hit the generate password button, then highlight the generated long password, right click, hit copy, then paste the generated password into your textedit document below \" Password:\" text then give name title of document and you can call it \"Stack Exchange Ask Different Account Information\", y default you'll probably see rtf at end of your title name of document. after that be sure to go down pointed arrow to select location to save the document into, you can if you like select downloads then you can go to file and hit save, then go to downloads tab and you'll find the document you saved. you can drag and drop the document into the new folder on your desktop then drag the folder into usb storage. I named my external usb storage \"VAULT\" but you can name yours whatever you like.

But I noticed small icons in Finder window with small text. That I adjusted with Finder view options globally. But I could not solve the problem of small fonts appearing in system dialogue windows such as in “Get info” window and System Menu bar etc. It is hard to read text there and icons looks smaller. \n\n\n\nIn specific applications I can adjust zooming in contents area, like in Safari or Google Chrome but there also system wide objects like labels on tabs appear too small.\nScreen zooming under system preferences is not a solution I want. I don’t want to trade off monitor resolution either.\nIs there a way to get slightly zoomed everything system wide, which affects all applications and objects appearances?\n\nA: Managed to try Quartz debug in my Mavericks. After enabling HiDPI display mode, I got this in display preferences.\nNoticed only 960 X 540 (HiDPI) is available. which doubles everything that appears on screen. \nvery nice and crisp looking font and icons are smooth but it is too big for the need. Just double.\nIs there a way to get a resolution option with HiDPI for slightly smaller view size without compromising Graphics engine resolution. My monitor is Samsung 24' LED.\n\nA: Currently there is no good way to do this and no way to only increase the resolution slightly. If you download Quartz Composer from https://developer.apple.com/downloads/, you can use a HiDPI resolution, which completely doubles the size of everything on your display and uses higher-quality graphics, like the way a Retina MacBook Pro would work. With a 1080p display that would be like having a 960x540 display. If you click on the image below you can see how huge the text is.\n\n", "Q: Changing OS X's Apache settings to replicate Ubuntu's Apache environment \nI've been using an Ubuntu distro for a few years now and I greatly prefer the default Apache2 settings on Ubuntu compared to OS X. This post aims to provide instructions on how to convert the few settings I want from 'mac-style' to 'ubuntu-style'.\n\nI'm trying to change the default behaviour of Apache on OS X to be similar to Ubuntu, including both the apache user / group and work directory. The information I have found so far on this points to the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apache on Ubuntu runs under www-data, on Mac under _www\n\n*Apache on Ubuntu uses /var/www, on Mac /Library/Webserver/Documents\nI got this information on Mac from /etc/apache2/httpd.conf.\nMy questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do I need to delete the _www user / group, before making the new www-data user and group, or can I simply change the former? How do I do the correct one without breaking everything?\n\n*I believe I can simply change the line in httpd.conf to change the root directory for files, and create the /var/www/ folder also. But in order to do this in the right way, I'll need the right permissions, so (1) needs to be done first.\nThe end goal:\nTo have a www-data user running Apache (like Ubuntu has) rather than _www, and also have my root directory under /var/www (like Ubuntu has) rather than /Library/Webserver/Documents, and for any PHP extensions via PECL or otherwise not to be affected by this change.\nHow can I set this up correctly so that \"it just works\", and won't interfere with anything like extensions / other modifications in the future?\nI'm running OS X 10.9.4, Apache/2.2.26.\n\nA: You can always do a clean install, from source, of Apache HTTPD, with whatever settings appeal to you. If you want it to walk, talk, and quack like Ubuntu, choose pathnames, user-ids, and everything else to match as part of the 'configure' process. All you need to do to your stock Apple deployment is turn it off to avoid avoid port conflicts.\nYou could try to reconfigure the Apple default install to be more Ubuntu-ish, but you risk getting tripped up by some obscure decision made by Apple, up to and including source mods. So I suggest that your best best is to use the source, as its authors intend.\n", "Q: Using Time Capsule to extend a BT HomeHub I currently have a Time Capsule (5th generation mid-2013 tall one) and use it as my only WiFi and back up to it.\nI am moving house and will be getting BT Infinity (Fibre), so I will get a BT HomeHub 5.  I will need to extend the range of the WiFi so it can reach all areas of the new house.\nCan I change the config of the Time Capsule to be an extension of the HomeHub WiFi? I've read contradictory info as to whether the two are compatible.\nIf this is possible and I reconfigure my Time Capsule, will I have to restart my Time Machine backups from scratch again?  Currently I connect to the disk \"Mark's Airport Time Capsule\" which I assume will stay the same even if I reconfigure the WiFi connectivity?\nEDIT: OR... would it be easier (and give better throughput) to use Powerline extenders to connect to the outlying room and then set up the Time Capsule & HomeHub in a \"roaming\" network (i.e. both using the same SSID & security) credentials)?\n\nA: Answer to: \n\nIf this is possible and I reconfigure my Time Capsule, will I have to\n  restart my Time Machine backups from scratch again?\n\nTime Capsule settings and user stored data are separate things.

On my Mavericks 10.9.4 instance of mdflagwriter eats up 2.18G of RAM. I know that it's somehow related to Spotlight, but what is it exactly and why is it so RAM-hungry?\n\nA: /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/Metadata.framework/Versions/A/Support/mdflagwriter is part of Spotlight's indexing.

But would it be possible to move it to, say, /Users/[username]/Google Drive without messing up the Google Drive app which syncs files between the computer and the cloud?\n\nA: Yes. OS X sees the Google Drive folder as any other folder, so there is no problem putting your home folder there, providing you don't asynchronously write to core Library files, using Drive is fine.\n", "Q: What security settings should one use with Keychain? I'm a new to Mac and found that Keychain has gathered quite a lot of passwords so far. I'm concerned about the security of these data, and I would like what security settings would you recommend so that my keychain data is secure?\n\nA: Maximum security if you’re that worried. Otherwise, just enable Lock when sleeping.\nI’m not that worried because to view the password in Keychain Items requires your account password.\n\n\nA: The security of your keychain depends upon two things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Who has access to your Mac both physically and to log in.\n\n*How secure your password is.\n\n\nThe first is quite easy to control. Don't let anyone you don't trust have an admin account on your Mac or have access to the backups and room where the Mac sits. If someone never gets a hold of your keychain file(s) then they can't use them or try to crack into them. Even guest users (or non-admin users) could potentially find a loophole and escalate their privileges to root/admin and then get a copy of your files, but this is a rare unlikely situation for most people that don't work in tech security fields. Governmental agencies, etc... of course probably can readily snatch that file if they should be interested in you or your Mac.\nThe security of your password is what secures the keychain even if someone has possession of the file. If you use a unique password there (one that isn't used on other services such as email, Facebook, online banking, etc...) is far more secure than a common password. Also, a longer password is far, far harder for someone to crack using brute force computations or a rainbow table should one be identified for the keychain (I haven't heard of one since I believe OS X salts that password sufficiently - but it's certainly possible someone could figure out that or Apple could have made an error in the coding of that password handling.)\nIn short - to most people - the keychain is highly secure - far more so than most any other storage of passwords they might use. A large majority of people make keychain insecure with simple, short, well-used passwords. If you are quite concerned, you could also store unimportant items in the login keychain and make other keychains with separate passwords for the secure items. You could also look into a dedicated product such as 1Password that have devoted significant amounts of funding to work to secure passwords. I'm certain Apple has spent a lot of money on the keychain - but like any physical security, the more secure it is, the less convenient it also is. There is a trade off between maximum security and maximum utility so you'll want to educate yourself until you are comfortable that you understand things and then make a good choice for your needs.\n", "Q: Is it a good idea to reinstall OS X to attempt to fix some minor issues? I am having a couple of problems with my Mac (wifi doesn't connect automatically, and audio jack doesn't work unless I restart).\nHaving failed at fixing them for a while, I am wondering if reinstalling the OS (Mavericks) might help in such a scenario and should be given a try? (Obviously, I want to reinstall while keeping all my data, settings, apps etc intact.)\n\nA: Yes, a variety of strange software problems can be fixed by reinstalling OS X. Providing the installer detects an existing install (which will only not happen if the disk can't boot) your files and settings will be preserved. If you've made any changes to the system such as modifying a keyboard layout or changing the boot logo, you will need to back these up as they will be wiped.\n", "Q: Getting home.dev to resolve to 127.0.0.1 In my hosts file I have:\n##\n# Host Database\n#\n# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface\n# when the system is booting.

How do I get it to actually go to the index page  that says \"It works!\" (I have index.php in the root directory of /Library/WebServer/Documents with just that). \nIn System Preferences for Networks, DNS, I have \"192.168.1.1\" and \"home\" which are greyed out.  If I try to use \"+\" to add 127.0.0.1, the previous entry gets wiped out.\n \nHow do I get this working properly?  I've tried different solutions over the years but never got this to work properly.  I'm using 10.8 but will be upgrading to Yosemite after it comes out.\n\nA: You could try to connect to http://home.dev./ (note the single dot at the end of the URL; also, when typing the URL, make sure to type the http:// part into your browser address field too). The reason you're not getting luck is with the somewhat irritating web browser behaviour, which is to try to add some common words to the server address part of the URL if it doesn't look \"normal\" (i.e. you'll notice quite often the browser try to be smart and add www or .com to the beginning or the end of the server address in your URL). \nThe DNS settings window, screenshot of which you attached, is used to configure DNS servers rather than static host to IP mappings like you do in /etc/hosts. When you add 127.0.0.1 entry, all you're doing is telling the system to ignore the DNS settings and the search domain it acquired via DHCP and instead use 127.0.0.1 as the DNS server - i.e. the system will try to send DNS queries to 127.0.0.1 expecting a DNS service to run there and respond to those. The default entries are greyed out to indicate they were put there automatically for you by the DHCP client. \nOne way to see what the system resolver is trying to do, bypassing the nonsense of the browser trying to be too smart behaviour, is to open the Terminal.app and type ping home.dev in there and see if you get any responses, and which IP address they come back from. If that works, it means that the resolver is working fine and that the issue is with your browser. \n", "Q: Applications and preferences on USB drive Is it possible to have applications, plugins and preferences installed on portable media such as USB drive?\nI have two identical computers, one at work and one at home, and I'd like to have the exact same setup on both.

What are the differences between using Target Mode and Migration Assistant on the source machine during a migration? Are different files transferred; is speed (all else being equal) different?\n\nAssume for simplicity a Mavericks-Mavericks migration.\n\nA: If by Target Mode you mean loading the HD of the old computer onto the new computer and drag-dropping files, then the difference is that Migration Assistant knows what it is doing.\nYou could have done this in the old Mac OS Classic days, but now there are tons of hidden files and locations that you would never remember to transfer over.\nYou should really use the migration assistant unless you have a good reason not to.\n", "Q: Improptu restarting of Macbook Pro while in Sleep Mode A week ago I bought a Macbook Pro Retina (mid 2014) version - and in the first few days of running it I have noticed about 4-5 times that the Macbook occasionally restarts itself - so far always in sleep mode. \nEven if the lid is closed, I can hear the opening chime when you restart a Mac.\nI'm concerned that this is a hardware issue and one I'll have to go to Apple with, but I wanted to know if anyone else had this issue that they have already resolved, in case this is something that's due to software rather than hardware.\nI don't believe there's a heat issue (I don't feel it running hot), and I don't believe there's a setting in 'System preferences' or similar that's causing this. Also, I haven't seen any note on the Macbook about a kernel panic.\n\nA: This is almost always hardware. Each time this happens, when you notice it, run sudo sysdiagnose from terminal.app and keep track of the times. You might find some clues looking at the system.log in each case to narrow down what was happening before the failure.\nAlso, you can start the Apple service online - sometimes they offer to run a diagnostic remotely, but usually that's for iOS and not Mac, but it might not hurt to request info on what a hardware repair might look like and/or cost from Apple.

(And one time it got stuck the other way round: It continued to show Headphones irrespective of whether the headphones were plugged in or not; and sound would only come from the headphones when they were plugged in, otherwise nothing).\nIt's not a hardware issue though. Because everything works fine after the Mac is restarted (That is, inserting and removing headphones has the expected effect, which is also reflected by the first item in the Sound -> Output tab changing from Headphones to Internal Speakers and vice versa.) However, the problem reappears after a while or after the Mac sleeps and wakes.\nEDIT:\nI just booted into the Windows partition on my Mac (bootcamp) and found that Windows actually allows the user to manually select if Sound is routed through Headphones or Internal Speakers.

From what I know, the moment you plug in headphones, OSX automatically disables the internal speakers and you can't choose  between them(via software). But you can use an external usb sound card to get this functionality, then you'll be able to switch between the USB device and the internal speakers.\n", "Q: Rubber band scrolling on Snow Leopard?

Is there a way I can put music onto her iPad without erasing data?\n\nA: You can transfer files to her computer via an external hard drive, from there she can import them into her iTunes, then onto her iPad. She should really back it up though. \n\nA: There's a lot of music in the public domain, and some people create their own music, and while nobody is more scrupulous than I am about paying artists for their work, if something is long out of print and can't be had any other way, the best one can do is try to track down the artist and get some money to him.  \nDon't copy music otherwise, it's wrong.  \nSecond answer is the only correct way to do it.  Add the tracks to the recipient user's iTunes library.  This won't work for purchased items since they're encrypted to a different key.  You can only synch each content type  ̣ ̣(apps, music, photos, etc.) to one computer at a time.\n\nA: Upon plugging in your device, you may receive a screen that asks whether you want to Setup as New iPhone or Restore from a backup. If the device has already been through the iOS Setup Assistant, Setup as New iPhone only creates the device record on the computer you are plugging it into. This does not remove any content that is already on the device.\nAfter setting it up as a new device on the computer, you will have a selection below Options to Manually Manage Music and Videos. This will allow you to manually select the content you wish to sync to her device. If they are iTunes Store purchases they will be tied to the Apple ID which purchased them.\n", "Q: How to switch Karabiner profile via shortcut?

It seems strange that it would occur on a fresh OSX build with only one application installed (VLC).\n\nA: The hard drive I installed the fresh copy of OS X 10.9.4 completely died last week. I suspect that this hard drive failure was unrelated to the issues, but when I re-installed OS X again and went to add the share drives, everything worked as normal.\nI suspect that this is an obscure bug, but if you come across this issue, a reinstall may fix it, as this worked for me.\n", "Q: Should I reformat a disk if Disk Utility asks me to? I have a FAT32 external disc that was suddenly unmounted as I was using it. When I reconnected it and tried to Repair it in Disk Utility, I got the following messages:\nVerify and Repair volume “COMMON”\nChecking file system** /dev/disk3s1\nCan't open (Resource busy)\nVolume repair complete.\nUpdating boot support partitions for the volume as required.\nError: Disk Utility can’t repair this disk.

Or is the verification not exhaustive, which means that it's safer to reformat the disk?\n\nA: Since the error that showed up the first time was just Can't open (Resource busy), I wouldn't worry about it. It didn't actually do anything the first time. I'm guessing you had a file open or something and it couldn't unmount the volume to repair. I think the reformat message shows up if a repair fails, for any reason, even if it has nothing to do with the filesystem.\n", "Q: Visualizer on multiple monitors I have a windows 7 PC with multiple monitors.\nIt is possible to display the ITunes visualizer across multiple monitors?  \nIt currently only uses the one that I am on.\n\nA: Currently, the only way to have the iTunes visualizer display across multiple monitors is to configure your other monitors to duplicate the display of the monitor where the visualizer is currently being displayed.\nHere's a sample screenshot of where that option might be located in your Control Panel:\n\n", "Q: Applescript automate double keystroke I need to emulate a keystroke using applescript for double time shift press.\nAdding Part of snippet..\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke shift\n    keystroke shift\nend tell\n\nEven tried \nkeystroke shift\ndelay 0.1\nkeystroke shift\n\nstill doesn't work.

At times, the alarm in my iPhone 4S sometimes doesn't go off as set. Or actually, it goes off and I see the corresponding UI on the screen but there is NO sound.\nThis happens very randomly, may be once in ten times but is obviously not acceptable in an alarm application.\nThis mostly happens when the phone is in silent mode (which is still NOT expected behavior I am sure) but has also happened a couple times when the phone was non-silent.\nHow do I fix this?\n\nA: This could have to do with a software issue on the phone. Try backing up your phone via iCloud or computer, then wipe and restore it as new. If it doesn’t fix the problem, take your device to Apple as it could be an internal hardware issue.\n\nA: Try setting 3 alarms all roughly the same time eg: you want to get up at 08:00am set one for 07:59am one for 08:00am and one for 08:01am and it should work.

Convinient way although not so fancy, but at least: it works!\n\nA: I had the same problem and in my case I was able to get past it by disabling Balloons - \"Use balloons to display changes\" in the Track Changes preferences.\nIf you don't show the gallery on startup and you can't open Word without it first wanting to reload the crashing file, then you may need to first remove the folder:\n~/Library/Saved Application State/com.microsoft.Word.savedState\n\nA: try deleting the preference files....\nI use track changes all the time on MS Word on my Mac and it normally works fine. Also you say this is reproducible behaviour on different files so it is clearly something to do with your specific installation. I suspect it might be due to a corrupt preferences file. Anyway it would be worth testing this by removing the word preference files - try both the \n~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft... files\n~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft files. \nIf you have more than one user account set up on your machine you could start off by seeing if the problem occurs on all user accounts. \n\nA: Deleting the preferences and everything in Library/Application Support/Microsoft both in my account and globally did not bring any change.\nI then re-installed Office, re-updated it and everything went back to normal.\n\nA: I downloaded the Microsoft Word 2011 for Mac 14.4.8 update.

(iOS) I would like to be able to easily turn on and off notifications for a particular app. I have my reasons for this, and if you'd like to know them you can check the edit history, but please keep responses to the topic of how I can do this, not whether I should want to.\nThere seem to be a couple of options for this, but neither is ideal.\nFirstly, I could turn on \"do not disturb\" mode for the periods when I'd like the notifications turned off. This will block notifications from other apps, so it's not what I want.\nSecondly, I could go to Settings -> Notification Centre -> [my app] and toggle \"Show on Lock Screen\". This doesn't seem to be something Siri can do for me, and it's something I want to do very often, so going this deep in the menu hierarchy is inconvenient.\nIs there a more convenient way to toggle notifications for a particular app?\n\nA: As for the current version of iOS (7).\nNo, there is not. Apple only offers the Do Not Disturb feature and the settings for notification center which are currently not controllable by Siri.\n", "Q: Finder treating symbolic links differently than terminal MacBook Pro Retina OS X 10.9.4 I created symbolic link jboss7 for hard link jboss-as-7.1.1.Final-downloaded and it worked fine in Finder. Then I made backup before modifying JBoss...\nln -s jboss-as-7.1.1.Final-downloaded jboss7\ncp jboss-as-7.1.1.Final-downloaded jboss-as-7.1.1.Final-downloaded-orig\n\nLater, I renamed the hard link to jboss-as-7.1.1.Final-downloaded-modified and replaced it with backup.\nmv jboss-as-7.1.1.Final-downloaded jboss-as-7.1.1.Final-downloaded-modified\nmv jboss-as-7.1.1.Final-downloaded-orig jboss-as-7.1.1.Final-downloaded\n\nThe symbolic link properly points to the backup with the same filename (ending with -downloaded), but Finder shows and treats the symbolic link incorrectly, saying it is alias for folder ending with (-downloaded-modified).\nIs Finder supposed to treat symbolic links in this manner? How do I update Finder to recognize the symbolic link as point to the current hard link?\nSide point: commands I wrote using tcsh terminal or Finder (don't remember, and terminal history does not go far enough back to answer this).\nRelated: OS X won't create any symbolic links, creates aliases instead\n\nA: I was able to reproduce this as well (on OS X 10.9.4). A simpler case is as follows:\ntouch file.txt\nln -s file.txt link.txt\nmv file.txt moved.txt\ntouch file.txt\n\nIf the Finder was open to the working directory while mv was executed, then it will (incorrectly) follow link.txt to moved.txt until it is restarted. Interestingly, you don't even need the Terminal to reproduce this bug, since it also applies to aliases:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create file.txt.\n\n*Make an alias of file.txt.\n\n*Rename file.txt to moved.txt.\n\n*Create a new file also called file.txt.\n\n\nThe desired behaviour for aliases is to point to the moved file (moved.txt) unless a new file has been created in the original location (file.txt, created in Step 4). But the actual behaviour is just like in your example: Finder continues to follow the alias to the moved location until it is restarted.\nThis is a bug in the Finder. The workaround is to relaunch the Finder if an open window shows a symlink/alias while you move or rename the target file.\n\nA: It's odd. I can reproduce it, but only if I actually check the symlink in the Get Info window in the Finder before I move the backup in. If you do all the steps without opening that window and checking, it doesn't seem to do it, but moving the original file in the Finder will make the link follow the file, but only in the Finder. Also, after relaunching the Finder, it shows the correct path, so long as the original file is still there. During all of this, the symlink doesn't change—it always points to the same place. It must be some bug with how the Finder resolves symlinks. It seems to treat them as aliases, but doesn't actually update them if you move the original file so it resets if you relaunch the Finder.\nI'm not sure what the implications are, exactly. If you need to replace the original file, it's hardly practical to relaunch the Finder every time, but I guess it should only impact cases where you're opening the symlink in the Finder or perhaps programs that use the OS file chooser widget. (I didn't test if they're treated the same as the Finder)\n", "Q: What is \"com.JWVD.cbcache.plist\"?

The various iOS sync programs (SugarSync, BitTorrent Sync, etc.) claim to be able to read files anywhere on the phone. I don't see how data from my application -- in my app's sandbox -- can be accessed. How is it that these programs are able to read/write outside their sandbox and get my app's data?\n\nA: They can't as all 3rd-party apps on a non-jailbroken iOS device are limited by the sandbox, both installed from the App Store and from ad-hoc/enterprise distribution.\nEither they are using public APIs to access data 'the iOS way' (structured and anticipated) such as accessing the Camera Roll to import/save photos, or are integrated with an app to share data in a way that the developers of both apps have worked together to make it happen (this doesn't necessarily mean they actually know each other as they could have used a framework, such as the Dropbox framework).\n", "Q: Control Spotify with Media Keys How can I use the media keys (previous track, play/pause, next track) for Spotify instead of iTunes?\nOS X 10.9.4\n\nA: I've found this helper application : Magic Keys ; Graciously written in a generic way by the creator of the Gear music player.\niTunes still sometimes pops us when using a Bluetooth control however, but it's minimal and non-intrusive and works well otherwise.\n\nA: You can go into System Preference - Users&Groups - Login Items, then disable iTune and Spotify at startup, restart, then start Spotify which triggers Spotify helper to take priority control of the media keys ... Good luck !!!\n\nA: If you use the Spotify desktop app, the media keys on OS X work by default (sometimes iTunes randomly \"retains\" the keys: just reboot). For the best results, don't keep iTunes and Spotify open at the same time.\nIf you use the Spotify Web Player, you can enable the media keys using BeardedSpice, a free application which enables you to control web-based media players using you keyboard media keys. It also works for YouTube, for example.\n\nA: You can download Bowtie. Although the developers have stopped developing this app, you can still use it to control Spotify, Rdio, and iTunes with media keys.\n\nA: If nothing helps to make Spotify take over the keys, check if you have Google Music installed in Chrome apps, because it always takes over these keys. Removing the Chrome app immediately makes media keys to work in Spotify.\n\nA: The keys didn't work for me on OSX10.10, while they normally do. I launched and quit iTunes. After that, Spotify responded to the media keys again. Even play/pause without launching iTunes. This may be because I tweaked OS X to stop launching iTunes when pressing play/pause (I can't remember for sure.)\nPressing play/pause on a headset does still launch iTunes.\n\nA: My solution to the Spotify problem was to go to keyboard shortcuts in account preferences, and assign the > and < keys to perform the \"Seek Forward\" and \"Seek Backward\" functions.  My media keys have always worked to start and pause playback, and skip or go back a track, but they would not perform the seek function.\n\nA: There is a small, free and OS tool called MacOS High Sierra Media Key Enabler for iTunes and Spotify.\nIt proxies media key events to iTunes or Spotify. You can prioritize which app you would like to control or you can go with the default behaviour which controls the running app. The app runs in the menu bar in the form of a subtle and beautiful black dot.\nThis workaround is needed as Apple in High Sierra changed the behaviour of the media controller keys: they no longer control iTunes, they control the video playback in Safari.\n\nA: If iTunes is not running, the media keys will work. I just tried it and it works on my Mac.\n\nA: I've found that having Chrome open prevents the key from working.\nClosing Chrome makes the keys work again. \n\nA: I've found a really nice chrome addon: \nIt gives me notifications and uses my mac media keys to control the Spotify web player. \nEverything I wanted + it's well maintained by the dev and open source hosted on github.\nMy main reason atm for using the webplayer is not having any ads.\nBlocked them with ublock and these filters:\n/mp3-ad/*$domain=open.spotify.com|play.spotify.com\naudio-fa.scdn.co/audio/$media,domain=open.spotify.com\n\n\nA: There is a nice little app called \"Spotify Menubar\" - you can set keyboard shortcuts via it's preferences. Works perfectly for me with Mojave.\n\nA: Just go to Users & Groups > Login Items > Delete iTunes Helper from the list.\n", "Q: How to remove removed apps OS X URL schemes from system? Some OS X apps register URL schemes and let users open the app directly through browser such as macappstore://itunes.apple.com/us/app/unibox/id702816521?mt=12 to open the URL in Mac App Store.\nRecently I downloaded RCDefault and discovered some of the URL schemes from apps I’ve removed — Steam for Mac and Monosnap — are still available.\nIs there any way to remove those apps from the list? I’ve tried to use this command below to disassociate all the URL schemes relic, but the mentioned URL schemes are still visible.\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\nHere’s the screenshot from RCDefault.\n\n\nA: How long did you wait until checking the URL list?  Did you reboot?\nAfter you reset the Launch Services database with that command, it will take a few minutes to rescan your system and rebuild the database.  During that time, the existing database will still be used.\nI wrote a blog post about using this command to clean up the Open With contextual menu as it would often become corrupted and list applications multiple times.  When I would reset the database, I've seen it take over 30 minutes until the menu is correct again.\nIf you still have the app installed, or you can reinstall it, you can use the lsregister -u PATH command to unregister an application, which removes the associated URL Schemes.  For example, I still have TurboTax from 2011 installed and in the URL Schemes list, it had a com.intuit.turbotax.2011 scheme listed.  Using the /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -u /Applications/TurboTax\\ Deluxe\\ 2011.app command, it removed ONLY that registered application from the Launch Services database so it didn't need to rebuild the entire database.

I have a late 2012 MacBook Pro running OS X 10.9 Mavericks, and it uses a network login system with my school. \nThis normally wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that I can't connect to a wifi network from the login screen. \nIs there a way I can accomplish this so that I can log in and get this thing going?\nI can't use an Ethernet cable, because the MacBook doesn't have a full Ethernet port, but it requires a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter, which I do not possess, and neither does my school.\n\nA: Use a local account on your mac to connect to the WiFi, then logout again, you won't loose connection, and you'll only have to do this once since your Mac will remember the network.\n\nA: Reboot and hold down the OPTION button.\nThat should give you the option to select a wifi network.\nThen select your drive and hit the arrow on the screen.\n\nA: I have just encountered this issue myself with a 2017 MacBook Pro. It too doesn't have any Ethernet out of the box. \nIt's a little bit of a catch 22 but the way to resolve this is by creating a mobile user account that will cache credentials in your user home folder. In which case you have two options. \n\n\n*\n\n*The first requires you to get an Ethernet adaptor for your MacBook (Yes, I realise you don't have one of these but for completeness, I am including this as a solution because it might suit other readers) and make sure your network admin has setup a mobile user account for you. \n\n*Once connected via Ethernet, login that way using your network account first. (Don't worry, we only need to this for the first logon.)\n\n*Once you are logged on, make your user account a mobile account by going to System Preferences > Users & Groups. Click the lock icon to unlock it and enter an admin username and password. Then click the Create button next to “Mobile account,” choose the disk where you want the local copy of your network home folder, then click Create.\n\n*Next, you want to connect to your WiFi network. Once you're logged onto the WiFi successfully for the first time, that should be enough to get you logged into your WiFi at the login screen, without the need for an Ethernet connection every time.\n\n\nYour other option is to create a .mobileconfig configuration profile for your MacBook which allows you to configure a WiFi network for your MacBook to use at the login screen. Hopefully your network admin can help you with this too if you don't have macOS server you can use. For example, using macOS Server's Profile Manager, configure a Network payload for your MAcBook for your schools WiFi network. (The SSID is case sensitive so make sure its typed correctly.) See this link for more detail on creating and editing configuration profiles.\nYou will may need the help of your network admin to help you correctly configure your network authentication settings if you are using Enterprise Authentication.

From inside the LAN, the iCal service works fine when I add an 'OS X Server Account' via 'Internet Accounts' in System Preferences.\nWhen I attempt to connect from the outside, it tells me it is Unable to verify user credentials. The server is behind a firewall, so I've forwarded numerous ports in an attempt to get it to work. Initially I only added 8008 and 8443, as they are used for the iCal services, but as that did not work I attempted to forward other ports that might be relevant (based on their description in this list). This has not let me to any success, however.\nWhat ports do I need to forward for the OS X Server Accounts to be available? The server is running Open Directory, so I'm assuming that the services rely on Kerberos for authentication? Is Bonjour relevant for this scenario, since I already know the IP I'll be connecting to?\nNote: I'm not talking about Network Accounts, and have no intentions of logging in to network accounts remotely.\n\n\nA: This is a partial answer, but it perhaps contains valuable information to whoever is reading this.\nAs I was able to add an 'Internet account' from inside the LAN, I decided to set Wireshark to work and try to figure out the port that way. I found out that the initial authentication and selection of services is done via port 443.\nAfter forwarding port 443, I was able to add the internet account from outside the network. This pretty much answers the question, but does not resolve the issue for the full 100% yet, so I figured I'd still keep this open for a bit.\nAt this point I'm stuck at creating an agenda in the iCal account, however, running into a rather generic error message:\n\nThis is a work in progress, and any pointers on that error are appreciated.\nEDIT: Further network sniffing let to no more information. Once logged in, the rest of the traffic is conducted over port 8443, which is duly forwarded. However, it still won't work outside the network. The fact that it does not work via VPN as well strikes me as odd, and makes me suspect a different issue than the TCP layer.\n", "Q: How to restore a removed /bin/sh file?

When I follow Apple's instructions for preforming a complete erase and reinstall on a FileVault 2 encrypted SSD machine, and choose a high level of security for the erase, I get an error, and the process (apparently) completes instantly.\nDid this securely erase my FileVault machine? If not, what should I have done; and what (if anything) can I do now (that I've \"erased\" my machine)?\n\nThe scenario: I wanted to securely erase a FV-encrypted SSD (to hand of the machine to another user; I will be using the same FV password on a new machine, I have no recovery key), but my attempt seemed to have failed quickly with an error (though the option for secure erase was enabled). Even so, the drive seemed to have been \"erased\" in some form anyway (there was no OS to boot into; though wifi was still working after the \"erasure\", so something was left) and I proceeded to reinstall OSX. \nI don't know where I am now though. Is this the correct procedure? Have I performed the \"official\" (secure-as-it-gets) erase procedure for a FV-encrypted SSD after all (error message and nearly instant completion notwithstanding)?\n\nA: No - nothing really happened when you asked for the erase and yes - you are basically done when you delete a partition instead of decrypting all of the contents. Even if you used a third-party tool instead of the supplied disk utility to securely overwrite an SSD, it doesn't cover 100 % of the storage space due to how flash memory is over provisioned and the drive controller actually intercepts the read/write commands and decides how to store data amongst the normal and space memory addresses that make up the \"drive\".\n\nApple documents the hasty refusal of Disk Utility to actually perform secure wipes of SSD - this is the designed behavior of the tool:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3680 - OS X: About Disk Utility's erase free space feature\n\n\nNote: With an SSD drive, Secure Erase and Erasing Free Space are not available in Disk Utility. These options are not needed for an SSD drive because a standard erase makes it difficult to recover data from an SSD. For more security, consider turning on FileVault encryption when you start using your SSD drive.\n\nIf you didn't turn on FileVault before introducing sensitive information to the SSD, it's possible that the controller could have marked some of that data as offline / damaged and it theoretically could be recovered - although highly costly and perhaps requiring someone to modify the drive itself / change the firmware to get it to dump all the data and not the data that is making up the \"drive\" currently.\nIn reality, writing new data will gradually / eventually over-write any old data. I would either just destroy the FileVault key securely or set up a new FileVault encryption on the drive and never write down / record the passphrase and then repartition the drive. From your words, you might not even need to do anything if the previous FileVault encryption was secure in terms of passphrase and no copies of the recovery key being obtainable.\nThat encryption is much stronger than most people care to or could decrypt - so once the new encryption pass is complete - you can be quite confident that absent the passcode/recovery key - no one will discover what was on the drive.\n", "Q: Macbook pro sometimes left clicks are not registered Hi I have a macbook pro 15\", primo 2011.\nIt runs perfect with Mavericks. However recently it has started to get a strange bug from time to time. Some times left clicks on the pad is not working. It happens randomly while I work. It's often happening when I e.g. want to close a window in finder or change/close a tab in safari. \nThe issue shows like this: When I for an example hover over the \"X\" and clicks to close the window, nothing happens. I can try 10 times but nothing works. Right clicking though always seems to work. I have noticed that if I move the pointer a little around (maybe clicking elsewhere) and then back on the \"X\" again, then it always works fine again.\nThe issue comes and goes, and I cannot find any pattern, except that it's happening for every 20. left click I'm doing, that the computer seems to not register it.\n\nA: This happened to me as well, and I just realized that the problem might be because I swapped the hdd drive with other macbook and the when I installed osx the hdd it was in a different macbook, so probably after a reinstall would work.\n\nA: Try using an external usb mouse and if the left click works then you know that it is the Macbook Pro's trackpad that is the issue , if the Trackpad is the issue then I would recommend talking to Apple about a repair. \n\nA: I had the same issue from day one(!) in my retina macbook pro (mid 2012). I call few times apple but I didn't get any solution. I tried everything. As you say it's difficult to find a pattern.

On seemingly random occasions, streaming media from iTunes on a Mac mini to my Apple TV (3rd gen, latest software) will result in slow buffering of movies. The catch? There's no consistency to when it happens, and I don't know how to diagnose it when it does.\nI've tried restarting the Mac, wireless box and Apple TV at that point, and it almost never makes any difference (as in, it stays pretty slow). When it's working fine, movies start playing inside of twenty seconds and don't pause to buffer at any point. Since I know the Apple TV is capable of streaming and playing back these sorts of files without issue, so I suspect a network issue, but I have no way to verify that.\nMy main suspicion, due to the seemingly random nature of the problem, would be slow wifi speeds. Here's where I get annoyed. Older versions of the airport utility had a panel where you could see the speed at which devices were talking to the base station. In 6.0 up, it's not there any more. In any case, I've tried playing with wireless channels, but it doesn't make any discernible difference. The settings screen of the Apple TV indicates 4-5 signal bars whenever I check, but I have no idea how reliable that is or what it actually means. Is there any way to see this info?\nI'd happily get some powerline ethernet adaptors, but I don't want to waste my time if the wireless speeds I'm getting are fine and the problem is elsewhere! Any pointers would be much appreciated.\nExtra (but possibly irrelevant) details:\nThe files in question are almost always 10GB+ 1080p files, all ripped and remuxed the same way. They're stored on a 4-drive RAID enclosure connected by FireWire 800.\nThe network is an 802.11ac AirPort Extreme that's in charge of everything — DHCP, etc etc. The Mac mini is connected to the Extreme via Ethernet directly (no switches), and the Apple TV is connected via wi-fi.\n\nA: It could be\n\n\n*\n\n*other wireless devices on your network using wireless bandwidth\n\n*a wireless device connecting at a speed that is forcing other connections to a lower-speed protocol\n\n*wireless devices not on your network but using an interfering channel\n\n*another process on the Mac Mini using network bandwidth\n\n\nSignal strength and signal quality do not always go hand in hand.

Program updates are also pushed out automatically.\nThe machine runs Mac OS X, I have admin privileges and can install any software I want.\n(Note that this is a technical question, not a policy one. Also note that I understand any computer can be hacked. This question is more pointed towards assessing typical threats from my friendly sysadmins and their equally benevolent bosses.)\nI would like to find out whether my employer is snooping or can snoop on my files or activity on my computer. Can I find that out? How would I go about?\n\nA: Typical software (Apple Remote Desktop, Casper, Absolute, VNC, etc) that allows remote monitoring of Macs will be reliant on a few things that the end user controls, assuming they have administrative privileges.\nIn System Preferences > Sharing a lot of this control is determined using these two preferences.\n\n\n*\n\n*Remote Management is centered around the Apple Remote Desktop capabilities, which are shared with most management suites.  Screen sharing (or observing), file copying, reports, restart, shutdown, etc.\n\n*Remote Login allows others to login remotely via the command line, using SSH.\nThese are the two options that I set on all of our owned Macs.  With them I can remotely control, gather reports, copy files to/from, push updates, etc.\nAnother thing to look for is System Preferences > Profiles and/or other third party preference panes such as the Absolute Manage pane.  Both of these are only present if they've been installed.\nProfiles will show any installed management profiles.  These could offer a wide range of control or settings.  Clicking on a profile will show you the options it sets though.\nThird party panes (or plugins) may not be as transparent as profiles but will still give you a clue as to what management is in place.\nHope that helps!\n", "Q: Cloud storage options for iPhoto's primary storage (not for backups) My wife and I both have Macbook Airs with relatively limited internal hard disks. If we could just offload our iPhoto libraries, we'd be fine.\nWhat are some of the cloud storage options for iPhoto? Meaning, when I open iPhoto, everything feels local, but is really stored in the cloud.\nNote:\n\n\n*\n\n*This thread talks about wireless NAS as an option, which might\nbe a better way to go.\n\n*I'm talking about using the cloud as primary storage, not as a\nbackup.\n\nA: Your best bet is to wait for the release of Photos for OS X Yosemite, which is going to replace iPhoto early next year and will do exactly what you're asking for.\nYou'll be able to store all of your photos in iCloud, and the Photos app will dynamically cache only the most recent and/or frequently accessed photos locally, freeing up lots of disk space.\nPricing will be 99¢/month for 20 GB or $3.99/month for 200 GB (or 5 GB for free, but that's really not much). There's also going to be a 1 TB option, but Apple hasn't announced pricing yet. \nOS X Yosemite and the new Photos app will both be free updates, and will run on any MacBook Air released in late 2008 or later (which is every model other than the very first one).\n", "Q: Troubleshooting DNS I'm having a weird problem where the system-wide DNS resolution doesn't work, but I don't know how I could fix that, or even find a log (coming from Linux).\nI manually configured 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4 as DNS servers in the GUI, which seems to have taken:\n$ scutil --dns\nDNS configuration\n\nresolver #1\n  search domain[0] : Home\n  nameserver[0] : 8.8.8.8\n  nameserver[1] : 8.8.4.4\n  flags    : Request A records\n  reach    : Reachable\n\nDNS configuration (for scoped queries)\n\nresolver #1\n  search domain[0] : Home\n  nameserver[0] : 8.8.8.8\n  nameserver[1] : 8.8.4.4\n  if_index : 4 (en0)\n  flags    : Scoped, Request A records\n  reach    : Reachable\n\nHowever when the system tries to resolve a name it fails with a timeout, only some software i.e. Chrome which doesn't use the system resolver is not affected:\n$ ping google.com\nping: cannot resolve google.com: Unknown host\n\n$ scutil -r google.com\nNot Reachable\n\nThey can be queried manually:\n$ nslookup google.com\nServer:     8.8.8.8\nAddress:    8.8.8.8#53\n\nNon-authoritative answer:\nName:   google.com\nAddress: 2.127.237.183\n...\n\n$ dig google.com\ngoogle.com.     50  IN  A   2.127.237.183\n;; Query time: 226 msec\n;; SERVER: 8.8.8.8#53(8.8.8.8)\n\nAnd the results are valid:\n$ ping 2.127.237.183\n64 bytes from 2.127.237.183: icmp_seq=0 ttl=60 time=37.086 ms\n\n$ scutil -r 2.127.237.183\nReachable\n\nMy hosts file doesn't contain anything surprising:\n$ cat /etc/hosts\n##\n# Host Database\n#\n# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface\n# when the system is booting.

Is there a tool that uses the system resolver and has some options to tell me what's wrong?\n\nA: I don't know what might cause a problem like this, but I can give you some troubleshooting pointers.\n\n*\n\n*First, try doing a manual query to 8.8.4.4 (dig google.com @8.8.4.4) -- dig, nslookup, and host all seem to use the first listed server, but the system resolver uses a weird round-robin-ish system that'll fail intermittently if some of the configured DNS servers don't work right. Similarly, you might try configuring the OS to use just 8.8.8.8 and see if that changes anything.\n\n\n*Speaking of the system resolver, it's possible it's gotten into some weird state, so restarting it may clear the problem. Actually, I'd reset both opendirectoryd (which dispatches all kinds of lookups) and mDNSResponder (which actually does the DNS part), just in case. sudo killall opendirectoryd mDNSResponder should do the trick. Note that both daemons will be restarted automatically.\n\n\n*You can get more info out of mDNSResponder by sending it signals. Probably the most useful is the packet logging feature, which makes it log each DNS packet sent & received to /var/log/system.log. You can toggle it on & off with sudo killall -USR2 mDNSResponder. The log entries should look something like this (for a successful lookup, that is):\n -- Sent UDP DNS Query (flags 0100) RCODE: NoErr (0) RD ID: 28215 25 bytes from port 61186 to 172.20.0.1:53 --\n  1 Questions\n  0 scanme.insecure.net.

Many times I can't complete the research in one sitting and have to try to remember what apps and more importantly what search rabbit trail I had gone down. It would be so much easier if I could take a \"snapshot\" of what is open, where it is at, save it as a profile / task group / desktop config (saving their size and location on screen) - call it what you want, then reopen it later.\n\nA: Safari can save all open tabs from a single window & reopen them with one click.

Found this fix, posted on LifeHacker:\nhttp://lifehacker.com/225873/mac-switchers-tip--remap-the-home-and-end-keys\nThe issue is that this fix only works on native/Cocoa apps and doesn't work on many of the other apps like ThunderBird and Eclipse. Will be thankful for any help, regarding this.\nPS: I frequently switch between the beginning and end of the line and this has been so annoying lately that I switch to a vim window to edit code and use Eclipse only for debugging it.\n\nA: You can do this with Karabiner's 'Use PC Style Home/End #2'.\nThis remaps Home and End to ⌘← and ⌘→ respectively.\n\n\nA: Karabina is now Karabina-Elements.

All I have to do is hit the down arrow and it takes me to the end of the line I that my cursor is on.  It works exactly like the \"end\" key on my old windows computers.\n\nA: Before, I had this working well using Karabiner (if I remember correctly). But after a reinstall of macOS, I couldn't get this working anymore. Even restoring the Karabiner configuration (in ~/.config/karabiner) from a backup didn't work. Too much time spent in trying to configure Karabiner Elements, trying several of the \"complex modifications\" offered on the site, didn't result in something that worked for most applications.\nI finally stumbled upon an alternative key mapping tool in a Karabiner-Elements issue comment. While ⌘英かな is a Japanese application, it is simple enough to set up the required key mappings. Mapping Home/End to Ctrl+Q/E (A/E on my Belgian Azerty keyboard), Home/End key behavior can be fixed for most apps.\n\nFor some applications, the key mapping doesn't fix things.

Unfortunately, I am not in the US and cannot avail the free repair since the warranty isn't international (although by the serial number alone, it qualifies for a free repair). \nI was wondering, can I simply replace the sleep/wake button myself given I find the required parts online? Any other remedy for this issue?\nPS: Mailing to someone in the US isn't an option for me. I'm ok voiding the warranty. \n\nA: Apple's warranties are world wide however you may give up walk-in service by some authorized repair centers if they don't want to take that repair. You can arrange service in the US (since your original purchase was from the US) over the web or by phone. The mail in procedure is clearly explained at https://ssl.apple.com/support/iphone5-sleepwakebutton/\nI've never heard of actual Apple stores not offering to help facilitate a US repair - even if it's helping you arrange a mail in service, but perhaps something new is up or it's a temporary delay due to parts shortage.\nThat being said, there's nothing preventing you from opening up the device and putting in a new sleep/wake button. For some, that \"surgery\" is way too hard for their skill level with tools and for others, it's a \"piece of cake\" since they are either trained or have the natural aptitude for repair of delicate electronics. If your device has the covered issue, it is caused by a mechanical failure and/or electrical failure of the switch itself.\n\nA: Have you actually tried the ever-hopeful trick of just playing dumb & taking it along to an Apple Store?

Using hardware acceleration instead of software decoding will save you some battery time. \n", "Q: What is the difference between 'Capacity' and '%iused' when running the 'df' command in the terminal When I run the df command I'm getting different values for capacity and %iused. What is the difference between them?\n\n\nA: The first Used/Available/Capacity is the obvious \"How much of my 1 TB drive is full?\" measure. The second tracks internal storage structure called an inode or index node.\nOn traditional UNIX filesystems, there were a fixed number of inodes which are used to track files and directory entries (metadata and filesystem implementation data). When you ran out of inodes, you couldn't use the filesystem whether it was full or not. The df tool needed to report both resources that could fill so you could plan and maintain the filesystems.\nOS X uses HFS+ which will make more inodes from any free space and can't run out of them, but they are still reported since as inode use grows, the storage is slightly less efficient and can be slower than if the filesystem were still in the original allocation of inodes.\nBasically, you can just focus on Capacity/Used/Available and ignore inodes unless you are deep in filesystem implementation details.\n", "Q: Use media keys on Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 for Spotify Recently I installed the Microsoft Intellitype drivers for OSX so that I could use my keyboard more naturally (e.g., media keys, etc.).  However, this seems to have broken some functionality.\nPrior to installing these drivers, I could at least use the play/pause button to control Spotify (the goal was to also gain access to the forward/back keys to skip tracks).  Now, however, any media key will automatically attempt to open up iTunes, regardless if Spotify is active or not.\nIs there a fix or remedy for this, or should I uninstall the Intellitype drivers?\nEdit: I suppose this is fairly similar to this unanswered question.\n\nA: You can create AppleScript's that do things such as play/pause, next track, previous track and then using the Microsoft keyboard pref panel set the key settings for the media keys to use command \"Open Item\" and then choose the apple script that corresponds with the media key you wish to use.\nHere is a link to what the apple scripts should look like.\nhttp://www.jack.sh/2011/07/21/spotify-applescripts-0-5-2/\nHonestly, I simply opened Automator, create new application, added action \"run appleScript\" and for the area where the script goes, added:\ntell application \"Spotify\" to playpause\n\nNext, I assigned that application to the play/pause media key.\nFor next track and previous track the script should just be\ntell application \"Spotify\" to next track\n\nor\ntell application \"Spotify\" to previous track\n\n", "Q: Can I use a Verizon iPhone 5 on T-Mobile’s LTE network?

When I insert my 64GB SanDisk Micro SDXC Card into my 2012 MacBook Pro (in a MicroSD/SDHC/SDXC Adapter that works with other Micro SD cards), a popup dialog informs me that \"The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer.\"  The card works properly in my phone; it was formatted by a Galaxy S3.\n$ sudo fdisk /dev/disk4 indicates that the computer can, in fact, read the \"disk\"; it contains a single partition formatted to Win95 FAT32L.  Presumably the \"L\" indicates the LBA version of FAT32.\nIs OSX not able to read large FAT32 volumes?  Is there a way to remedy this?  Or is the problem that OSX cannot properly deal with SDXC cards?\nUpdate: The volume appears to be exFAT.  See my answer for more info.\n\nA: Most Android phones format exFAT SDcards incorrectly, the BlackBerry Priv being the only one I know that does it correctly. All other Android devices create a partition of type 12 (sometimes referred as hexadecimal \"c\") instead of 7. The android device actually ignores the partition type, so if you set it to 7 then the sdcard will work fine everywhere.\nThere are many options:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can format the sd card on your MAC, then use it on any other\ndevice. Don't forget to copy your data somewhere else first, since\nreformatting will erase the contents of the sd card.\n\n*Use the program fdisk on PC or Linux system. Use the command \"mount\" on the\nlinux system to see the name of the device corresponding to your sd\ncard (it looks like /dev/sdc1 ) then call fdisk on that device,\nomitting the last digit (ex: fdisk /dev/sdc). Then use option \"t\" to\nchange the partition type to 7\n\n*I think there is a similar program on Windows.\n\n\nA: My workaround was to access the disk via a Linux VM under VirtualBox.  I would still quite like to know how to do this natively under OSX.\nThis is not a trivial task.  This answer was instrumental in getting it set up.  I did end up chowning /dev/disk4.\nEven after getting SD Card access set up, Linux was unable to mount the partition until I installed exfat-utils; presumably this is, in fact, an exFAT partition.  When I mounted it, something like FUSE exFAT was output to the console.  This is confusing, since both OSX and Linux's fdisk show the partition ID as 0C, indicating FAT32 LBA (exFAT is supposed to use 07).\nEDIT there were problems with this approach: large copies accessing the vm-mounted sdcard would hang after copying only a relatively small amount of data (say, 1-2G out of 64).  It was a while ago, but I think I ended up archiving the stuff to copy over into split tarballs and sending the files to the phone using adb.  I'll probably be posting another answer here soon, since I'm about to upgrade my SD card yet again.  It's looking like rebooting to Ubuntu using a USB drive is going to be the way to go.\n", "Q: Something like GeForce Experience for OS X I'm looking for an application like GeForce Experience but for OS X : a software that configures my games depending on the configuration of my Mac.\nI think there is nothing like that for OS X, so do you know a web site who lists the recommended settings for games on Mac ?\n\nA: I dont believe there is such an application, the only thing i can think of is if you're using a macbook pro with an nvidia card, you can install an application called gfxCardStatus (https://gfx.io/) which shows you if its using the integrated graphics card or the nvidia one, it also allows manual override of the setting.\n", "Q: Can someone be reading my iMessages? Someone has told me they can read my messages I send through iMessage. Is what they are saying true? Can someone do this?\n\nA: They can only view this information if they are logged into your account on their iDevice.  For example, an iPhone, iPad and MacBook all on the same account will receive all messages sent or received from the other machines (barring a lack of network connectivity).\nMy suggestion to you is to change your password. They will be prompted for the new password and will no longer be able to view new messages that you send or receive through iMessage. I would also change the password associated with your email account if you use similar or identical passwords for these accounts.\nExisting messages that they have captured will not be removed from their device, so be wary — anything incriminating that has already been gathered is in their hands.\n", "Q: Can I swap an LCD between different laptop generations?

I'm using preview for my iOS development to calculate pixel distance from elements. But now, I don't even remember since when it started antialiasing the lines, even 1 pixel line becomes a blurry mess and you can't find out where it actually begins.\nHow do I return crisp look to my images when zoomed in Preview?\n\nA: I have a different experience from what CousinCocaine reports in their answer. Using Preview Version 7.0 (826.4) on a PNG bitmap, it seems to depend on the zoomed image size rather than on whether the zoom level is a nice number.\nSpecifically, it anti-aliases the zoomed image if the zoomed image would occupy more than 64 megabytes (2^26 bytes), using 3 bytes (24 bit color) per pixel.  To add to the confusion, if the image has one small and one large dimension, the small dimension is increased to be 1/3 of the large dimension before doing this calculation.\nFor example, with a 720x720 image at a zoom level of 656%, the calculation is 720*720*6.56*6.56*3 < 2^26, so it doesn't anti-alias.  But at a zoom level of 657%, it does.\n\n\nAs you can see in the first screen shot, absolutely no anti-aliasing is performed. Each pixel has been zoomed to a 6x6, 7x7, or 6x7 rectangle, with no smoothing of pixels.\nTo see the pixels in those images clearly enough to count them, you don't need Preview -- just go to System Preferences, Accessibility, Zoom, and uncheck the box \"Smooth images\" (and also make sure at least one of the methods for zooming is enabled).  Then you can zoom in on pixels anywhere on your screen (and you can use the pixels in the mouse pointer to help with visually counting pixels).  But taking a screenshot while zoomed like this is buggy for me.\n\nFor PDFs, which probably doesn't apply to you, you could also try one of the following undocumented settings, which apparently also require restarting Preview:\ndefaults write com.apple.Preview PVPDFAntiAliasOption 0\ndefaults write com.apple.Preview PVPDFAntiAliasOption 1\n\n\nA: In preview, you can look at your image on a 100% (1 image pixel = 1 screen pixel). To do this, make shure you have the right settings.\nGo to Preferences, Images, Define 100% as: '1 image pixel equals 1 screen pixel'\n\nNow when you open your image at 100%, you will see the original image. Here is an example of on iOS maps screenshot at 100%.\n\nOK, but now the tricky part. Let's say that your image is 100 pixels wide, and we will zoom it 2x: The resulting image is 200 pixels wide. You computer will double each pixel and the image will be sharp. This will be true for every 'whole number' zoom (3x, 6x, 32x, etc).\nSo, zooming in whole numbers is easy. But what about zooming in non-whole numbers, like 133%? The 100 pixels in the example must be devided in 133 pixels, but which pixel is doubled and which is not, we can not splice screen pixels in halve, can we? In these circumstances  the computer will calculate an estimated guess for the value of these 133 pixels and will result in your 'blur'.\nYou will find that some zoom levels are sharp (whole number zoom levels) and other zoom levels are blurry (uneven zoom levels). For this reason I have the extra '1' in my Toolbar, so I know when I am looking at '1 image pixel equals 1 screen pixel'.\nBelow an 'even' zoom level:\n\nBelow an 'uneven' zoom level:\n\n\nA: Preview on OS X Mavericks has antialiasing disabled for images, but enabled for PDF files. As far as I know, this setting cannot be modified in preferences.\nThis is Preview zoomed in on Dilbert's eyes:\n\n", "Q: Can I use a whiteboard marker to write on my thunderbolt monitor? I was wondering, since it´s glass, it shouldn´t be a problem, right?\n\nA: Dry erase markers have organic solvents in them which may cause damage to the optical coatings on the display's glass face. Also, depending on the coatings, it may actually be difficult to leave visible lines with a marker. Without details on the display construction, it's hard to know without trying. Given how bloody expensive the things are, I wouldn't risk it, but I won't say it's impossible.\n", "Q: List extensions that are opened with a specific application Is there an easy way to find all the extensions that are opened with a given application?\nI'm asking because I have two versions of a software installed (Sublime 2 and 3), and some extensions still open with Sublime 2 because by the time I specified that Sublime 3 was not available. I then have to quit Sublime, change the program that shall be opened by default for this extension and relaunch.\nI would like to end this once and for all and change it for every remaining extension. Does anyone know of an easy way to do this? Thank you!\n\nA: If you want all files with a certain extension (not the 1 specific file) to be opened by a certain app, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click the file and click Get Info (or highlight file and hit cmd ⌘ + i )\n\n*Change Open with: to preferred app\n\n*Click Change All...\n\n*Click Continue in the confirmation box\n\n\nIs this what you meant to do? This is different from right clicking a file and choosing the 'Always open with' option. That seems to only apply to the specific file, not all files globally.\nYou will have to repeat this for each extension.\n\n\n\nA: Open the file ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure.‌​plist in Xcode. The file contains all the bindings for extensions to applications.\nFind/replacing the values did not work for me, since the file was overwritten every time.

Option + d deleted a word.  \nStill works fine in the terminal.\nFor Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/162896/emacs-on-mac-os-x-leopard-key-bindings\n\nA: Option-B has always been mapped to ∫ in OS X, and option-B has never been mapped to jumping back a word in emacs. What you're thinking of is the meta-B shortcut, which is only sometimes mapped to the option key depending on the app. In the Terminal you can enable it by going to Preferences > Settings > Keyboard and checking \"Use option as meta key\".\nYou're also probably confusing it with the Ctrl-B keyboard shortcut to jump back one character. That's the emacs shortcut that is available in all OS X apps. You can jump back one word using option-Ctrl-B, delete one word using option-Ctrl-D, etc.\nIf you want to use option-B and the other emacs shortcuts across all apps, you'll need to install some additional software for triggering the emacs behaviors when pressing the OS X keyboard combinations, as seen in this thread:\nEmacsify OSX throughout: word-forward (⌥ + F) and word-backward (⌥ + B) instead of 'special characters'?\n", "Q: How to remove blank space on the menu bar?

But I am getting the below error \n\nThe item “.VolumeIcon.icns” can’t be replaced because it’s invisible.\n\nWhen I get into the Applications, I'm able to see .VolumeIcon.icns as a hidden item.  I also tried deleting it, however it is again created by the app(by default it is hidden).  Can you guide me how to resolve this error?\n\nA: I have gotten this error when trying to delete or affect an invisible file before. Temporarily turning the file visible usually, in my experience, changes the error to a dialog that asks if you are sure you would like to change the file.\nI figure you have probably already come across this command, but for completeness, here is the explanation:\nTo make invisible files visible, enter this code in terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE && killall Finder\n\nand to make invisible files invisible again:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE && killall Finder\n\nNote that this does close finder, so make sure you don't have any important folders open. I believe that it opens previously opened windows, but the back button doesn't work in my experience.\nWhat's happening\ndefaults\n\nThis is OSX's command to change defaults, apple's low-level preference system.\nwrite\n\nThis tells defaults you want to change a preference, or write it\ncom.apple.finder\n\nThis tells defaults that the application's preferences you want to change is Finder, specified by the application's bundle identifier.\nAppleShowAllFiles\n\nThis specifies which preference you want to change within the application.\nTRUE or FALSE\nThis is the value you want to set the preference to. In this case, it is a boolean, so the values must be TRUE or FALSE. I think you might be able to use YES or NO, but I'm not sure.\n&&\n\nThis is a terminal operator to run whatever's after this if the previous command is successful\nkillall\n\nI don't know much about this, but it kills processes or closes applications\nFinder\n\nSpecifies which process or application to close.\n\nA: When modifications are made to the running-process known as the Finder, it is necessary to terminate and restart the Finder for those changes to take effect.\nIf you were to select \"Finder\" in the \"Force Quit Applications\" pop-up from under the Apple menu you would see the button says \"Relaunch\" as opposed to \"Force Quit.\"\n\"Killall\" is a command line utility which allows one to send \"kill signals\" to a running process by name, instead of requiring the PID. (man killall)\n\"Killall Finder\" is the equivalent restart action for the Finder at the Command line.\n", "Q: Is there any Geogebra application for OSX? I just can find geogebra app for iPad.

I have a 17\" mid 2010 MBP with 8GB ram.\nAfter reading up on some of the latest vulnerabilities, I did a port scan and found port 21 OPEN vs stealth for all other ports. I cannot figure out what is using port 21, but Activity Monitor shows ports 21 and 24 being used by mdflagwriter (see attached screen shot)\nWhy would a Spotlight indexing system be using these ports, and how do I close port 21?  The other two show as stealth, but 21 seems to be open.  Is it safe to just kill these pids?\nStealth mode is enabled in System Preferences->Security & Privacy.\nThanks for any answers.\n\n\nA: The word \"Ports\" here does not mean what you think it means. It is not the number of a single TCP or UDP port the process has open. It is not even the count of such ports.\n'The \"ports\" column shows how many \"Mach ports\", or \"kernel queues\" the process has open, which basically describes how communicative the process can be with others (eg: reserving memory usage from the system). This information will only be useful to system administrators and programmers.'\n", "Q: Embedding files in Keynote Is there any way to embed files in Keynote presentation? So, that others can click on it and download/open it in their machines.\n\nA: Besides images or other media that can natively be placed into Keynote, for a document or binary file of arbitrary format, you would almost certainly have to post it elsewhere (Dropbox/Google/web page) and embed a URL to the sharing link in your presentation. \nUnfortunately, it seems you can't make the URL have the format of file:// instead of http:// You can, however use ftp:// or sftp:// or smb:// !\n", "Q: How can i recreate my Partition Table What happened:\nWhile i was tinkering around with my bootcamp partition something went terribly wrong. end of story is, i have no partitions left in my partition table\nThe current situation:\ni can boot my mac into internet recovery but diskutil shows only one partition on my 500gb harddrive.\nthe previous partitions were:\n1: mac partition - filevault (SHOULD BE RECOVERED):\nwas ~320 GB in size and the standard mac partition at the beginning, which got shrinked at the end to fit the bootcamp win partition (2). the mac partition uses filevault and runs as mentioned the yosemite public beta.\n2: windows 8.1 bootcamp partition (CAN BE DELETED) \nthe question: \ncan i somehow recreate my partition table and make my mac partition bootable again?\nif the windows partition is lost, so be it, as long the mac one is saved.\nTestDisk looks promising as i assume i have to somehow scan my harddrive for partitions and recreate the partition table manually.\nHow should i continue? if you need any additional information just ask!\nthanks in advance for any help!\nUPDATE:\nthis is what test disk says, which is exactly my partition scheme from before the mess-up.

Other devices (my iPhone and iPad) have great speed all the time, even when my iMac is slow, so my computer must be misconfigured somehow.\nAlso, it's not necessarily the screensaver itself: if I activate the screensaver manually, my internet speed seems unaffected. It's only when I come back to my computer after an extended period of time away.

What's that?\nPS Everything is the default. For example, the location is \"Automatic.\" Wi-Fi is green and connected in Network System Preferences (ethernet is red, obviously), when opening up Airport Utility everything is also green (the router and internet), the light on the AirPort Extreme itself is also green, the cable modem is flashing green, and as I mentioned OTHER devices have no problem getting on the internet. Pinging the router works fine, ping 10.0.1.1. As I mentioned, it's not like the internet is down, just REALLY slow.\nPS I realize this is incredibly difficult to diagnose, so thanks everyone for trying. Can you think of anything that MIGHT cause this, I've checked the obvious stuff.

This interference problem might have appeared after a move of only a few centimeters. The day before you were protected from your neighbour interference with a glass, this day when moving out of the shadow of this glass you are under the full light from the AP (or iPhone) of your neighbour.\nIf you want to investigate this problem and really choose the best wireless channel in the exact position you are using your iMac at the period of the day you are using it there is one uniq tool to know and use:\niStumbler\nPlease note: the 802.11b channels [1 ; 13] are a field of interferences for Bluetooth equipments and leaking microwave owens (they are both on the\nISM band of radio frequencies).\n\nA: First, thanks everyone for helping me. I think I've figured it out. Although I don't know why it works. I've added a \"5 GHz\" network and joined that explicitly. Apparently, it's normally 2.4 GHz.\n\n\nAnyway, my WiFi hasn't slowed down in over 24 hours, so I've got my fingers crossed that it's fixed forever.\nWhy did this fix it? I have no idea. Perhaps my antenna is faulty and doesn't transmit 2.4 GHz properly? Perhaps the 2.4 GHz spectrum is \"crowded\" where I live? Not really sure why.\nI guess my recommendation to anyone else experiencing slow WiFi would be to try different spectrums (the AirPort Extreme also allows me to pick individual channels, 1 through 11 I think, I didn't try that, switching to 5 GHz seems to have worked).\n", "Q: Does apple automatically sign out all connected devices when you change the apple id password? Yesterday, I got a bunch of emails from Apple, sent to one of my unused gmail addresses (which still has forwarding to my regular one). I do NOT have an appled ID associated with that address, but it seems like someone was trying to create one.\nThey were (all in English unless otherwise noted):\n\n\n*\n\n*10-12 identical \"Verify your Apple ID.\" emails from appleid@id.apple.com, some in English, some in Greek (I'm Greek and in Greece, so this makes some sense).\n\n*\"Your apple ID has been used to sign in to iCloud from an iPhone 4s.\" email from noreply@insideicloud.icloud.com (not sure about wording, because this one was sent in Greek: Το Apple ID σας χρησιμοποιήθηκε για σύνδεση στο iCloud από iPhone 4s.)\n\n*\"Your apple ID information has been updated\" from appleid@id.apple.com \n\n*\"Welcome to iCloud\" from noreply@icloud.com\nI was alarmed by this. I'm 99% certain I did NOT ever create this apple ID, and 100% certain I didn't use it yesterday, from an iPhone or elsewhere. I went to the apple site, clicked on \"reset my password\", got a password reset email right away, and changed the password.\nI checked ALL my gmail accounts (the one used for the ID, the regular one & a secondary one I have) and there has been no sign of breaching - no connected devices or recent sign-ins I don't recognize, no auto-forwarding or suspicious labels created.\nToday, I received another email from apple\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Your recent download with your Apple ID.\" from do_not_reply@apple.com\nI therefore realize that the device has somehow not been disconnected, although I believed that, as with other services eg. Google, whenever you change your password, each device asks you for the new password when automatically signing in. Is this not the case with Apple?\nTo rephrase, does Apple automatically sign out all connected devices when changing your password?\nI also had to install iTunes, so that I could deauthorize the devices already connected, but the option does not show up on the list, which seems to mean there are no devices associated. The only method I found for doing that without using iTunes did not work properly. \nThe details which the person has entered to the account associated with my email seem legitimate (as in, non-spam/scammy) but it looks like they're not tech-savvy enough to even realize they're using the wrong email, so I don't think contacting them (they've even listed their phone number) would have any benefit. \nIs it really possible for someone to register for an Apple ID and continue using that ID without verifying the email? Because this is what seems to be happening. I never clicked on those \"verify\" links, they even look unread in my inbox, but it seems like this person is still using that ID.\nMy goals here are\n\n\n*\n\n*To make sure my email account is safe \n\n*To stop receiving annoying emails every time this person does anything related to their apple id.\n\n*To ideally stop this person from signing up for apple IDs or other accounts using an email that doesn't belong to them (and can possibly be a typo, judging by their name).\n\n\nAny help/feedback at all will be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: \ndoes Apple automatically sign out all connected devices when changing\n  your password?\n\nIf they are still signed in (at the time you change the password) it will not sign them out, but next time they will have to use the new password to sign in.\nYour problem is clearly with someone who cracked your old gmail account.\nNow they have created NEW apple id and can verify it since they have access to email.\n\n\n*\n\n*go to that gmail and change the password to a strong one.\n\n\nYou only got a copy of that email since you have the forwarding turned on.\nYou must have created a apple id once upon a time since it is needed for basic service like system software updates.\nYour original apple id might be still OK and not compromised (but change the password on it anyway).\n\nA: I called the (local) number this person had listed in the apple ID and talked to them. Apparently, it was just someone that thought they were registering FOR that apple ID/username, not realizing they were stating that this was their email instead. The emails received (there was an additional one from a university), their age, as well as their attitude on the phone made me pretty certain they were truthful. They just thought they owned that email account, without ever managing to log in to it. \nSo it wasn't a phishing scam, or any account breech. \n", "Q: How to remove the loading wheel from iPad home screen? The loading wheel have been showing up for no reason on the home screen of my iPad Air running 7.1.2 that is not jailbroken. It use to only show up when I am downloading apps. Now it is stuck on the top left corner of the iPad home screen, beside the wifi connection strength sign. The only way I know how to remove it is by restarting the iPad, but it showed up again after a while. I also tried the hard restart ( pressing the sleep/wake and home button together and letting go when I see the apple logo) but it only removed it for a while and then it showed up again. Any idea how to fix this?\n\nA: Possibility 1: Bug in a third-party app\nThird-party developers have the ability to turn this icon on and off in their applications. This is a problem when the app does not disable the icon appropriately when it is finished with network operations. \nThe spinning wheel is set based on the networkActivityIndicatorVisible property and is set like so:\n[[UIApplication sharedApplication] setNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible:YES];\nRestarting the device fixes this until the offending app enables the icon and, once again, does not disable it. Apple apps will handle the icon properly, but iOS leaves it up to the third-party developers to handle it on their own. Sloppy developers can definitely cause the issue you are seeing.\nThe explanation from Apple's developer page on this topic:\n\nSpecify YES if the app should show network activity and NO if it\n  should not. The default value is NO. A spinning indicator in the\n  status bar shows network activity. The app may explicitly hide or show\n  this indicator.\n\nBecause this is explicit, bugs in code may cause this to remain visible long after a network operation finishes. My suggestion to you is to track down the offending app and submit a bug report to the developers.\n\nPossibility 2: Actual networking is happening in the background\nThe accepted answer from this Apple.SE question suggests that it may be actual network activity causing the spinning wheel to remain visible. \n\n  \n*\n  \n*The network you've connected to needs some more configuration, and it's taking some time to get the configuration information set\n  properly from the router (or, more likely, DNS server)\n  \n*Your phone is polling for a lot of data to transfer - maybe there are a lot of apps to update, or you have a lot of email to sync, or\n  you have a lot of cloud data to download\n  \n*Your phone is trying to hit an important server, and is having trouble connecting to it (say, it's trying to poll apple servers to\n  check for software updates and the servers in questions are down). The\n  spinner is going to stay up for a while, until your phone gives up or\n  gets an actual connection.\n  \n\nThis is certainly possible. It may not be a bug in anyone's code and reflect actual networking that your phone is doing in the background.\n\nA: Complete restart the device by pressing the home and power buttons until the screen goes dark. That should fix it.

I can see my external drives on all the spaces on my MacBook Pro's display, but I cannot see those drives on my external display. Is there a way to make them show up?\n\nA: The external display is not set as a mirror of the main display but rather as an extension of it.  So you can drag the external drive icon (or any file/folder/window) from one display onto the other.\nHowever, this will not 'stick' as when you disconnect the drive and reconnect it, the system will mount the drive icon back onto the primary display (the one with the Dock).\nAlso, when you disconnect the external display, the system will move any files/folders/icons that were showing on the external display onto the main display.\n\nA: *\n\n*Right-click on the drives on the main display\n\n*create an alias\n\n*move alias icon to second screen\n\n\nAs I've only one screen, I can't verify whether this works in all situations.\n", "Q: Why does my MacBook Air produce so much noise My MacBook Air's fan is spinning rapidly even though there are hardly any programs running.

I have an external disk with two partitions on it that I keep plugged into my MacBook Pro when I'm at my desk. (One is for Time Machine, the other just for extra storage.) Sometimes I need to grab my laptop quickly and take it somewhere, but I have to change to a space where I can see the partitions on the desktop, lasso them, two-finger click, and select Eject. Is there a faster way under Mavericks, or do I have to set up an AppleScript like this one with a keyboard shortcut?\nNote: I'm not looking to eject these only when I put my Mac to sleep (as explored here). Sometimes I'm on a screen-sharing telecon and I have to take my Mac away from my desk for a minute, if you know what I mean :-).\n\nA: I'd recommend Alfred.\nIt's a quick launching app that includes the feature of ejecting volumes.\nYou can select what kind of targets qualify for the command (network drive, local, etc.).\n\nWhen you trigger the shortut, you can select a specific volume to unmount. Or you can type ejectall (this shortcut name is customizable). \n\nA: On OS-X Mountain-Lion, I can option-click one of the \"Eject\" icons (hold down option, then click the eject icon), and all external partitions will eject.\n(Update) This has been verified to also work on OS X Mavericks and even on macOS Sierra, as I suspected it would.  It can probably be assumed to work on at least all versions in between (try it out!).\n\nA: I use launchbar to automate this task. It has a command shortcut to Eject All Ejectable Volumes. It's incredibly fast and if you turn off most of the indexing rules, the memory footprint and CPU usage can be tiny.\nIt's much more powerful than this one trick, but it does do that trick very well and you'd probably be fine using the free version for that purpose since you'd only be using that one shortcut.\n\nA: The only caveat to \"quickly ejecting\" disks with any reliability is that they will not eject if there are files in use which reside on them. That said, you can force eject disks, but that would not be ideal if files are, in fact, in use.\nEasiest way to instantly eject all disks is by invoking an Applescript (could also create a shell script, but Applescript is more easily turned into a one-click application solution). \nSo go to your Applescript Editor, paste in the following:\ntell application \"Finder\" to eject (every disk whose ejectable is true and local volume is true and free space is not equal to 0)\n\n\nand save the script as an application wherever you choose (do NOT use the /tmp folder as illustrated). Add the resulting application to your Dock, and you have a one-click Quick Eject.\n\nNote: the and free space is not equal to 0 portion is so that the script doesn't eject the contents of your CD/DVD drive. Remove that if you would like any inserted disks ejected as well.\n\nA: if you happen to have the same setup everytime you want to eject several external disks at once, you could use AppleScript / Automater and make your own keyboard shortcut. There is a detailled description how to do this over here:\nhttps://superuser.com/questions/405330/global-keyboard-shortcut-to-eject-external-hard-drive-on-mac-osx-lion\n\nA: You can use the menu bar app Ejector http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/12216/ejector to eject all ejectable volumes. The only regrettable part for me is that I can't eject them without logging in.\n\nA: Personally, I'm using Alfred as suggested in another answer. But here's the Applescript answer, wrapped up in a Ruby script. \n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\n#eject-all shell script\n\n# Dan Rosenstark 2015-11-12 15:28\n# http://porkrind.org/missives/calling-applescript-from-ruby/\ndef osascript(script)\n  system 'osascript', *script.split(/\\n/).map { |line| ['-e', line] }.flatten\nend\n\nif __FILE__ == $0\n  appleScript = \"tell application \\\"Finder\\\" to eject (every disk whose ejectable is true and local volume is true and free space is not equal to 0)\";\n  osascript appleScript\n  puts \"I probably ejected all the disks.\"\nend\n\nyou'll have to put it in your path and make it executable.\n\nA: The AppleScripts above eject all ejectable disks, sadly this also includes cloud disks such as Box.com/Google Drive etc.\nIn order to eject only non-cloud disks I tweaked the script slightly to:\ntell application \"Finder\" to eject (every disk whose ejectable is true and local volume is true and format is not unknown format) \n\nHope this helps anyone who comes here looking for this.\n\nA: This can be done elegantly with an automator application and using the Display Notification feature for output. Simply save the following as an application and launch it however you prefer.\n\n\nA: I use a combination of AppleScript and an application called Spark. Spark is on Github for Homebrew Casks.\nbrew install Caskroom/cask/spark\n\nThen I just use an AppleScript to eject the drives and bind it to the shortcut ⌘ E.\n\n\nA: For disks with partitions, I've found the following Applescript works best.\ntell application \"System Events\"\n  key down option\n  tell application \"Finder\"\n    with timeout of 15 seconds -- make sure we stop\n      eject (every disk whose ejectable is true)\n    end timeout\n  end tell\n  key up option\nend tell\n\n\nA: Improving on Ady's answer I noticed his version would include my Time Machine disks.\nExample: disk \"2022-09-07-113224.backup\" of application \"Finder\"\nI don't want to eject these. Adding that owner is not \"system\" filtered out those disks for me. So I use this to eject instead.\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    eject (every disk whose ejectable is true and local volume is true and format is not unknown format and owner is not \"system\")\nend tell\n\nYou can test which disks will be ejected in Script Editor by running\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    every disk whose ejectable is true and local volume is true and format is not unknown format and owner is not \"system\"\nend tell\n\nThere's a longer script answer here that might be more reliable. They filter out TimeMachine disks by inspecting the name.\nShortcut to eject all external hard drives but not MobileBackups\n\nA: On macOS Mojave, you can just simply select both of the drives you want eject and click \"CMD+E\". This will eject both of your disks without any prompts.\n", "Q: My Macbook can connect to ethernet over Ubuntu but not OS X I'm currently dual booting Ubuntu 14.04 and OS X Mavericks (10.9.4) on my 2014 Macbook Pro. When running Ubuntu, I can plug in the Ethernet cable and instantly be connected. But when running OS X, there's no Ethernet connection detected.\nSince I was able to connect on Ubuntu instantly, I shouldn't have the issue of having to set up additional configurations, such as a PPoE connection. Since I'm dual booting I'm obviously also using the same laptop, the same Ethernet cable, and the same Ethernet port so it doesn't seem like there should be a hardware issue either.\nWhat could be the issue here?\n\nWhen I run \"ifconfig\" in my terminal while booting OS X, this is what I get:\nlo0: flags=8049<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 16384\n    options=3<RXCSUM,TXCSUM>\n    inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128 \n    inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000 \n    inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x1 \n    nd6 options=1<PERFORMNUD>\ngif0: flags=8010<POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST> mtu 1280\nstf0: flags=0<> mtu 1280\nen0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    ether 80:e6:50:16:b0:c0 \n    inet6 fe80::82e6:50ff:fe16:b0c0%en0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x4 \n    inet 192.168.70.245 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.70.255\n    nd6 options=1<PERFORMNUD>\n    media: autoselect\n    status: active\nen1: flags=8963<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    options=60<TSO4,TSO6>\n    ether 72:00:05:04:94:20 \n    media: autoselect <full-duplex>\n    status: inactive\nen2: flags=8963<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    options=60<TSO4,TSO6>\n    ether 72:00:05:04:94:21 \n    media: autoselect <full-duplex>\n    status: inactive\nbridge0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500\n    options=63<RXCSUM,TXCSUM,TSO4,TSO6>\n    ether 82:e6:50:61:cb:00 \n    Configuration:\n        id 0:0:0:0:0:0 priority 0 hellotime 0 fwddelay 0\n        maxage 0 holdcnt 0 proto stp maxaddr 100 timeout 1200\n        root id 0:0:0:0:0:0 priority 0 ifcost 0 port 0\n        ipfilter disabled flags 0x2\n    member: en1 flags=3<LEARNING,DISCOVER>\n            ifmaxaddr 0 port 5 priority 0 path cost 0\n    member: en2 flags=3<LEARNING,DISCOVER>\n            ifmaxaddr 0 port 6 priority 0 path cost 0\n    nd6 options=1<PERFORMNUD>\n    media: <unknown type>\n    status: inactive\np2p0: flags=8843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 2304\n    ether 02:e6:50:16:b0:c0 \n    media: autoselect\n    status: inactive\n\nAfter reinstalling OS X I can no longer see the rEFInd screen and thus cannot boot Ubuntu. However, I remember when I ran \"ifconfig\" earlier I saw an item that started with \"eth0\"\n\nA: If you can see the interface in /Utilities/System Configration > \"Ethernet Cards\", try creating a new network location.\nIf the issue persists in a new location, you can reset OS X's detected network interfaces by (re)moving /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist.  If you want to play it absolutely safe, you could (re)move the entire SystemConfiguration folder, but this will affect other settings (like custom network authentication, power management settings, etc.). NOTE: this step supersedes testing it in a new user since it removes global preferences (which affect every user).\nIf you're still not seeing it, try booting to your Recovery Partition, launching Terminal, and running ifconfig to see if the Recovery partition can see the network interface.  If the Recovery Partition sees it, a reinstall of OS X might be needed.  If it doesn't, well then you did something that I've never seen... :)\n\nA: You deleted your Ethernet connection.  From System Preferences -> Network, hit the '+' and add a new one (it may be Thunderbolt or Thunderbolt Bridge).\n\nA: It looks like the issue was with my Ethernet adapter, which is incompatible with OS X Mavericks.

Where is the Advanced Bluetooth option? My problem :\nRecently I started to use a Magic Trackpad for my MacBook Air (Mid 12), and discovered some annoyance :\nI regularly see some devices connected to my Mac by Bluetooth, the one that I never paired...\nOne of this devices is my FitBit One, which is not paired to my Mac, but still can connect and use it's (fitbit) battery...\nSome others devices appear from time to time with different names, that I do not recognise... Sometimes I know when another device, that my Trackpad, is connected because the trackpad starts to freeze.\nI tried to \"remove\" an unwanted device, but it keeps reappearing...\nI can't even imagine what I can do, since the bluetooth options are really limited...\nQuestion :\nIs there some way to have an advanced bluetooth options? So I could \"force\" all devices to ask a permission before even trying to connect to my Mac?\nI found some screenshots of advanced view here :  Securing Bluetooth\nBut this is an old one and I am afraid that in Mavericks the only \"advanced option\" is limited to \"alt + bluetooth\" which gives nothing useful to me.\nIf anyone have an idea how to fix this problem (but still keep using my trackpad :) ), it would be great to share with me :)\nThank you in advance!\nEDIT (29/08/14)\nSome precisions : I detected this problem by seeing my FitBit One battery life going from one week to 48 hours, exactly from the moment I started to use BT on my Mac. \nI use my Magic Trackpad only at work, and I already checked, if I leave my Mac working all night my FitBit will loose somme battery life in one night, and my Mac is the only device with BT enabled...\nHere the link where you can see my One listed as Connected, but I never paired it or was asked to. Link\n\nA: When you say that you see devices connected to your Mac, are you in the Bluetooth Preference Panel or are they appearing in a different app?\nNormally your BT is not in discoverable mode, meaning other devices can't see/pair with it unless it has already been paired.  When you open up the BT Pref Pane, the discoverable mode is automatically switched on.  When this happens, it will list all of the available BT devices it can find (like your FitBit) so that you may pair with it.\nIf it isn't already on, in the BT Pref Pane, enable the \"Show BlueTooth in menu bar\" checkbox.  This will add the BT menu in the right side of the menu bar.  Clicking on this will show you the currently paired devices and other basic functions.  However, if you hold down the Option key then click on the menu, you are shown an advanced menu. This will show you if your BT is in discoverable mode or not, which it should only be on if the BT Pref Pane is open.\nIf there are any devices listed in the menu that you don't want paired, choose that device's submenu and select Remove.\n", "Q: just got new imac with fresh Mavericks install, old data still remaining, how to find and delete? I just bought a 24' used iMac. \nThe previous owner reinstalled Mavericks and sent it to me.\nI looked at the disk usage info and it appears as if all the old data, movies, music, and everything else, is still there. Only 100gigs are free on a 500gig drive.\nIs there a way to find this old data and reclaim my hard drive space?\nI don't have a disk.\n\nA: You do not need a disk to reinstall Mavericks, since it has a recovery partition that will download Mavericks and do a fresh install, if you prefer to do that.\nErase and reinstall Mavericks: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14243\nOtherwise, you can probably just delete the user account, which will offer to delete all the user's info, freeing up considerable space.\n\nA: I would start with this plan. Get a backup disk or connect a USB drive that you can dedicate to backing up your iMac. Get a full Time Machine backup so you can experiment and delete things.\nLion and later (10.7) need no disk to run maintenance and reinstall the OS. You can boot to recovery to wipe the drive and reinstall the core OS. Do keep in mind, you might lose some apps like iLife or iWork if they were installed - which is why it's nice to have a backup before you wipe anything.\nAlso - you could look in the Apple Menu - open the About this Mac and then click more info. Then click on storage to see what sorts of files are taking up space on the Mac.\n\nA: You could download 'DaisyDisk' and let it analyze your Disk. You get a very good overview what Files are using up your Space.\n", "Q: iphone 4s - communications My phone Verizon (iphone 4s) is off contract/unlocked and I \ndo not need voice.\nHowever, I would like to use it to communicate over WiFi.\nIs this possible (options) without a monthly phone bill..?\nJohn\n\nA: you can use certain apps to do this, things like google voice will provide you a virtual phone number which can do voice and sms.  as long as you have wifi, they do a decent job.\nthere's also a log of voip or messenger programs that do voice, but that's not so transparently behaving like phone number.\n", "Q: Messages from my phone show up on my macbook air My Macbook air keeps getting my phone messages but since the computer is a school computer it doesn't allow me to go into iMessage. \nWhat should I do?\n\nA: it is something you put in since you had that machine -- this is keying it to your account (without even the need for the application).\nopen system preferences/INTERNET ACCOUNTS, look through each you have set up and delete what you can -- or what is related to your messages account\nthis is the central directory for accounts like messages (could also be controlled or synced through icloud).\n", "Q: Is there a way to use automator/write an apple script to change the font in several powerpoint documents? A recurring issue at work: \nA powerpoint file needs to be moved in to illustrator and saved as an .eps file. The files are almost always submitted with the font set to Calibri which Illustrator doesn't like for whatever reason. I select all the type and change it to Univers which usually enters Illustrator quite well. I'm looking for a way to speed up this process. I'd like to be able to put all my .ppt files in a folder, select that folder, have all the documents open, the type selected and changed to univers (Univers LT Std 55), then have the file save and close. Any advice?\nThanks! \n\nA: Short answer:\nYes, it's possible. You just need to use the Record button in Automator to record your own mouse movements as you change the font in one PowerPoint file. Then save this recording as a Folder Action. Now every time you drop a some files into a folder with this action, it will automatically run at your mouse movements on those files.\nI'm including a screenshot of a proof-of-concept Folder Action that I made just now, but in all honesty, this will probably take a lot of tinkering around and may not be a very clean way to do it.\n\nBetter answer:\nThere is a better way to do this but it will only work on the new .pptx format presentations, not on any of the old .ppt files.\nBasically, all you have to do is rename your powerpoint as .zip and then unzip it like a folder.\nOnce you open the folder, navigate to:\nppt > slides > slide#.xml\n\nWhere the \"#\" is slide number you want to edit. In my case, I only have slide1.xml but you will probably have others too.\nOnce you open the xml it should be pretty straightforward to search the xml text for the word Calibri and replace it with the words Univers LT.\nThat's it :)\nAll you have to do now is save the xml, zip the folder again, and rename the zipped file back to .pptx.\n\nThis may sound tedious to do, but I'm sure it's possible to write a simple 5-10 line bash script that will do exactly this. Unfortunately, I can't do it tonight so perhaps one of the mods can help out and post a script for me.\nIf I have some time tomorrow, I'll try to write one for you and test it on my computer. :)\n\n\nScreenshots:\n\n", "Q: Wireshark keyboard layout is incorrect I just installed Wireshark Version 1.12.0 (v1.12.0-0-g4fab41a from master-1.12) on OSX 10.9.4 with XQuartz 2.7.7. \nWireshark is doing something zany with my keyboard layout, but other X11 applications are not affected.

It would be great to be able to x tunnel over ssh; why does one have to use XQuartz (etc) instead?  \n\nA: The simple answer is: Terminal is a terminal emulator -- it's not an X11 server. It exists to provide a text-based communication end point between your Mac and other machines.\nTerminal is no more an X11 server than gnome-terminal on Linux is or cmd on Windows is. Which is to say: it isn't an X11 server at all. You need to be running an X11 server on your local machine to be able to have tunneled, graphical, X11 applications draw their UIs on your Mac. This isn't actually different for Mac from something like Linux, it's just that Linux, by default, is always running an X11 server for drawing your desktop so it's handled a little more gracefully than it is on the Mac. You just have to open up your X11 server's permissions and ssh tunneling and X11 forwarding on a Linux desktop seem to work.\nThe XQuartz server you run on OS X simply gets you the missing X11 server you need on your OS X session to enable drawing the forwarded UI commands on your OS X desktop. This isn't something an Terminal application ever would, or ever should really, implement. It's not part of being a Terminal. It's a wholly separate thing.\nI also want to address something you said in your question:\n\nIt would be great to be able to x tunnel over ssh\n\nI'm assuming you mean \"it would be great to do X11 forwarding from an ssh session started in Terminal.app to my running XQuartz server\". You can do this!\nWhen you use ssh in Terminal.app simply include the -X option to enable X forwarding and your Mac will start XQuartz automatically. No need to use the terminal app in XQuartz, which pretty much sucks.\nYou can also edit ~/.ssh/config and add:\nForwardX11 yes\n\nto that file to enable X forwarding by default for all ssh sessions. You can even launch X programs on the remote machine in to the background like so:\nssh username@remoteserver -f -X xeyes\n\nThat works from Terminal.\n", "Q: How can I use Siri to send a pre-made SMS? So I recently discovered that most bus stops have a code.  If you text that code to a specific phone number, you'll get a response telling you the ETA of the next bus to that stop.  I saved the phone number in a contact card and I saved all my frequent bus stop codes stored as a note in that card.\nIt's a little cumbersome to go into the card, copy the code, open a new text, paste the code, and hit send.  If I remember the code, I can just use Siri and say something like \"Tell the bus company 123456\".  It's a lot easier to just remember the cross-street names.\nIs there a way to either have Siri make a substitution, say for example \"Grant Street\" with \"123456\", or else is there a way I could have a canned text all ready to go?  One thought I had would be to create a home screen icon called \"Grant Street\" that when launched, sends \"123456\" to the bus company's phone number.  Then I could just say \"Launch Grant Street\" or something and I'd get back the text saying when the next bus is.\nAny ideas?\n\nA: There are apps that do this, see Canned.\nReally what you need (and I use) is a transit app of some kind. I like Transit.\nI can't think of a way to get Siri to do this. One workaround is to make keyboard shortcuts so that you type \"LGS\" and iOS will autocorrect it to \"123456\".\n", "Q: OS X 10.9.4 - How can I limit the number of failed login attempts?

This answer may not be valid any more, but you can find updated information about the \"Up-To-Date Program\" here.\nUpdated link text:\n\nStarting in October 2014, Apple announced that Pages, Numbers, and\n  Keynote are available free with every qualifying new Mac. If you\n  purchased a qualifying Mac that did not include Pages, Numbers, and\n  Keynote, you can apply for these apps through the Up-To-Date Program\n  by following the steps below.\n\n\nOriginal answer:\niMovie costs $14.99 on the Mac App Store. New Mac computers include iMovie (and other creativity/productivity apps) for free. However, the free pricing is not offered for older Macs, as is outlined in the small print/asterisk note on this page.\n\n* Pages, Numbers, and Keynote are free on the Mac App Store for\n  qualifying Mac computers purchased on or after October 1, 2013.

Unfortunately, this means that your 2008 iMac is not eligible for a free copy of the new iMovie — you will have to pay the $14.99 if you want to update. \nUpdates like bug fixes for the 2008 version of iMovie are free, so you can also choose to keep using the version of iMovie that shipped with your Mac. Just install from the media that came with the Mac or contact AppleCare to have a replacement DVD shipped to you.\n\nAnother option is to activate a new Mac with your Apple ID and simply associate the free versions of the software with your account. If you have a friend who purchased a new Mac but is already eligible to download those apps, ask if you can sign in first with your account to get those free apps. \n", "Q: How can I run iTunes without installing Bonjour in Windows 7?

I recently purchased a 27\" Acer K272HULbmiidp 1440p (2560x1440) monitor that just arrived today. I connected it via a mini displayport to HDMI cable, and was immediately greeted with awful graphics that didn't fit. Turns out its a common issue with external displays on macs, which assume settings for a TV not a monitor. Basically, I fixed it by using a Ruby script to force RGB mode onto the monitor. So that's all good now. \nThe issue is I can't seem to get the 2560x1440 option on the external display, it will only show 1920x1080. I have heard the mini displayport to display port cable will allow my computer to run an external monitor in 1440p. Is this true? Please suggest what I can do to get the external display running in 1440p. Thank you so much guys. \n\nA: Did you check if you have a Display Port on the monitor apart the HDMI? \nI had the same issue with my late 2012 mac mini, and I had to buy a mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort to use the 1440p resolution\n\nA: We are using an inexpensive Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable between newer (2013) MacBook Pros and the Dell U2713HM monitor, and getting the full 2560 x 1440 at 60 Hz.  Our older MBPs need the more expensive Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter from Apple. \n\nA: Yes, it's true, and it's not related or limited to Macs, but more of a hardware limitation.\nIt is my understanding that similar to how normal 29,99 DVI adapters only support 1920x1200 max, and you have to go to 99,99 dual-link DVI if you want higher resolution, the HDMI through these cheaper adapters is likewise limited to a single link, and thus you can't do full 1440p.\nAlso, see why login screen has a 2-second delay with external monitor? in order to select a proper mDP to DP cable.\n", "Q: Can I control window size and position when opening files via script?

If not, how else could I accomplish this? \nUpdate: I'm now using AppleScript instead of a shell script, but the purpose is the same. \n\nA: Having a look at the man page for open, it doesn't seem to allow it, but you can use applescript to resize and position windows:\ntell application \"Finder\" to set the bounds of window 1 to {325, 465, 1095, 926}\n\nThe numbers are the coordinates in pixels of the top left and bottom right of the the window:\n\n\n*\n\n*top left corner x\n\n*top left corner y\n\n*bottom right corner x\n\n*bottom right corner y\n\n\nIf you set the windows as you like them, you can use applescript to tell you the current bounds:\ntell application \"Finder\" to get the bounds of window 1\n\nThe window numbers are assigned going from front to back, starting at 1.\nIf you prefer, you can also refer to windows by name instead of id, though this won't work if the name of the window is different every time:\ntell application \"Finder\" to get the name of window 1\ntell application \"Finder\" to set the bounds of window \"name\" to {325, 465, 1095, 926}\n\nUpdate: Coordinates for multiple monitors behave as though a single large display were present.\n", "Q: Dock randomly switches between screens.

Less power consumption, prolongs the battery life.\nOn the math side:\n $2300 vs $2650 is 8.6% or $350.\nWhat can you do with $350?\nBuy some software (Games) you always wanted.\nBuy USB stick, or External Drive for back ups.\nKeep it for rainy days :)\nOn the other side: \nThe $350 is not for the GeForce GT650M alone. Check the system specs in more details to find the differences you care about.\nMy vote would be for the iGPU since it comes with newer model that brings other engineering improvements with it.\n\nA: The other thing to think about is that you can't tell OSX not to switch to the discrete graphics when a program that would use it is started, and this can also have a hit on the amount of time you get on a battery charge.\nIs that also worth a few percentage points of graphics performance?\nIf you regularly play graphics-intensive games while plugged into the wall then it probably is. Otherwise it may well not be.\n\nA: Definitely go integrated only. Not to save money but to reduce fan noise. Instapaper founder Marco Arment bought a MacBook Pro with discrete GPU back in 2011. He ended up returning it for a model with a much less capable GPU and considerably lower noise.\n\nThe 2.0 GHz, 6490M-equipped replacement model does indeed run much cooler than the 2.3 GHz with the 6750M that I returned. The 2.0 has far less fan noise under normal usage, with the fans only spinning up audibly when the CPUs are under a sustained moderate to heavy load.\n\nThe Retina MBP with discrete GPU has similar heat and noise issues.\nLess famous Alec Kinnear bought the same MBP in 2011. Someone had brought the MBP to me overseas so I couldn't exchange mine as easily and kept it. Years later I'm still not able to use this computer with the discrete GPU turned on (it's too hot and loud) or with external monitor. I can only use it as a carry around thanks to Cory Krieger's donation-ware gfxCardStatus which enables me to run integrated GPU only.\nMy girlfriend's 2013 Retina MBP 13\" with integrated GPU only on the other hand is quiet. I recommend you save your money and your nerves and keep the hot discrete GPU out of your next MBP.\n", "Q: How can I create a default dock for all users (Mavericks)? I am new to managing Macs. We currently have a lab, and probably plan to create more labs in an enterprise style solution. In the lab, we would like to have a \"default profile\" created for users who log in.\nThe users are AD users, and the Macs are bound (binded?) to AD; users can log in fine.\nI would now like to modify the dock to display specific installed applications. I then want this dock to be the default dock for any users that log in.\nIdeally, I would also like to use this default dock on other machines in the lab, so if there are some files I can transfer to the other machines and a command to run to apply the settings, that would be perfect. Ideally I will be Apple or Bash scripting the entire process (currently Bash scripting the AD bind, default background, apple ID sign-in removal, etc).\nWe have no management servers. We will be using Deep Freeze for the time being, so there is no problem with users modifying their dock; users will have permissions to mess around.\nI have found answers for pre-Mavericks, where it seems to be a case of copying a couple of files which would have been perfect, but it seems Mavericks does it a little differently and I can't find a straightforward answer.\n\nA: Your Question should be answered here :\nOSX 10.8 - How to keep a custom dock for all users that login\nBasically, you create your dock in your account, copy the .plist from ~/Library to the System Template Lib and your're done.\n", "Q: Change *.txt to *.csv How can I rename all *.txt in a directory to *.csv files in the terminal (Mavericks).

Open System Preferences, then go to Sharing and select Internet Sharing. Change \"Share your connection from:\" to Wi-Fi, and then in the box below it select Ethernet.\n\n", "Q: How Do I Get Out of Boot Loop on iPhone 4? I dropped my iPhone (jailbroken, running on IOS 7.0.6), and it went blank - it has this habit of being switched off own its on when it's dropped. I tried holding the sleep/power button, but it's not showing me the Apple logo (usually, it will show me the logo when I pressed the button). I can't do the DFU or Recovery Mode as my home button is kind of not working, unless I press it with the right amount of force.\nI tried plugging in to my computer, and nothing is detected (the cable is working just fine). However, my phone will go into the endless boot loop when I plugged into the socket/charger. While it's booting, I tried holding the volume (+), but it never worked.\nSo, how do I get out of this boot loop with 'kind of not working' home button? I'm avoiding the idea of buying a new phone, but if it's my last resort, I guess I have no choice.\n\nA: My advice would be to fix your home button (here's an excellent guide from ifixit if you want to fix it yourself: https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPhone+4+Home+Button+Replacement/3144) and then put it into DFU mode. If your home button is dodgy, fixing it will greatly enhance your chances of getting into DFU mode in order to restore it within iTunes.\nThere are tools that exist to get your device into DFU mode with a broken home button however these are unlikely to succeed if iTunes isn't detecting anything and your device is bootlooping.\n", "Q: Removal of proposed updates I don't want to update my epson printer driver since I'm informed that it's likely Epson's method of preventing the use of non-Epson cartridges. Is there a way to stop the proposed update from popping up every morning when I start iTunes ?\n\nA: There are two places the pop up can come from.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple store web site\n\n*Epson software that you installed on your computer.\nIf it is Apple-- If you right-click on the Update button you get the option to hide the update. \nIf it is the Epson Connect Printer Setup Utility v1.30 on your computer find it and select NO-auto updates.\n", "Q: Switching between two monitors stacked vertically So I have monitors stacked vertically.

Usually, a signed message shows a checkmark icon. Clicking on this icon displays the certificate that was used to sign the message:\n\nNot so when a message lies in an exchange mailbox, and is displayed with \"Mail\" on MacOS (tested up to 10.10):\n\nThe iPad, on the other hand, handles the exact same message just fine. It is also connected via Exchange protocol to the server:\n\nSo: How can I enable this also on \"Mail\" on OS X? Or is this a bug, or even a permanent restriction?\n\nA: It was most likely a bug. I had the same behaviour and after the latest update (10.10.2) Mail is showing the information again.\n\nEdit\nAs commented by user2216335 the Security information is not always shown.\nApple Mail was able to recognise the signature from my example:\nContent-Type: application/pkcs7-signature; name=smime.p7s;\nsmime-type=signed-data Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"smime.p7s\"\nContent-Description: S/MIME Cryptographic Signature\n\nbut not from a message sent by Apple Mail\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"smime.p7s\"\nContent-Type: application/pkcs7-signature; name=\"smime.p7s\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64\n\n\nA: Does the RFC 822 Name in your certificate match the email address that you have listed in Apple Mail on your Mac? If you're not sure, double click on your certificate in Keychain Access to bring up the details and scroll down to the RFC 822 Name field. This email address must precisely match (including case sensitivity) the email address listed in your account's settings in Mail.\n\nFor example, if your RFC 822 Name is listed like this:\nusername@email.com\nCheck your email address to see what how closely it matches:\nusername@email.com - Exact match, certificate should appear\nUsername@email.com - Not exact match, certificate won't appear\nusername@EMAIL.COM - Not exact match, certificate won't appear\nUserName@email.com - Not exact match, certificate won't appear\n", "Q: eclipse running on mac 32bit i am currently using mac 32 bit.I am unable to open eclipse an error pop up saying that i need to update my JVM from 1.6 to 1.7 and from the java website there are no ver 1.7 for mac 32bit. what am i suppose to do? \n\nA: Mavericks is a 64-bit OS; it has no 32-bit option...

Is it possible for me to keep my iTunes libraries in sync with each other on OS X and Windows if so how? My iTunes library is stored on a network share made available via AFP and SMB. Is it possible for me to make it so that any changes made on iTunes on Windows are also shown in OS X and vice-versa or will I have to maintain separate iTunes Libraries resulting in a clunky mess (especially when iTunes Match starts uploading playlists twice and other things)?\n\nA: Later edit\nSee iTunes: Moving iTunes Files (Self Managed) for a better explanation of how to achieve dual, almost-in-sync libraries across different machines \n\n[This is not a hugely technical explanation, more one of the frustration I've had doing the same thing... if you want more details, ask...]\nYou can share the file location, but both machines will 'see' it differently. iTunes uses absolute references [truly irritatingly] so the only way to keep the Library in sync is to either add the same files to both [not good if it's supposed to be self-organising] or to manually copy the iTunes Library.xml file & use BBEdit to change the path structure for every entry - which can be done but then may take the Windows version of iTunes up to 10 hours to process it.\n", "Q: How to move \"section\"/change \"section\" margin in Pages I've been a full-time Mac user for 5 or so years now, but sometimes the Apple way still confuses my Microsoft-conditioned mind.

I also have Time Machine installed on two laptops and they backup to the Time Capsule. I have noticed that whenever a backup is running the wireless connection speed drops from 30Mbps to around 8Mbps or less. Is this normal and is there a way to minimise such drops?\n\nA: Any WiFi has a bandwidth. \nThat is the maximum amount of data it can handle.\nFor example the 5 GHz WiFi can handle up to 8x more data then the 2.5 GHz.\nSetting (limiting) a bandwidth usage for a specific application is not easy and Mac does not offer a build in solution, but there might be some external applications for that.\nHere are some suggestions how to do that.\nHowever, one can also use the AirPort Utility (in your utility folder) to set the Date/Times for Time Capsule. Set it to Times when you are not using the computer to prevent overcrowding your WiFi network.\n\nA: I had the same problem (and even disappearing network). I found reports that the Airport Extreme and Time Capsule devices don't handle mixed IPv4/6 environments very well. Switching off one (in my case, the latter), was said to address the problem.\nAfter I switched it off, sadly and oddly, my problems disappeared. \n", "Q: Active Directory Home Folder on Startup We've recently integrated all of our Macs to our Active Directory environment, and some of our users have MacBooks. When \"binding\" their laptops to the domain, I enabled \"Create mobile account at login\" so that they wouldn't have to be connected to our network in order to login to their account. Doing this set up a user's home folder on our server, which automatically connects on startup. Here's the thing: If they aren't connected to the network, the home folder on the server can't be found. It takes about forty-five seconds to a minute before getting the error (see below) saying it couldn't connect to the server, and as you might expect, it's frustrating a few of our users (myself included).\nIs there any way to prevent this home folder from trying to connect on startup? I checked the Login Items, and nothing was in there.\nThanks!\n\n\nA: Do you have \"Force local home directory on startup disk\" checked?\n\n", "Q: retina macbook pro keyboard cleaning solution I'm curious what solution people use for cleaning off laptop keyboard keys.\nI've been told that you shouldn't use isopropyl alcohol, because it can wear away at the plastic (I've seen evidence of this, although I'm not sure that it was due to alcohol).\nCan anyone steer me in the right direction?\nI know there are other threads for this, but none of them quite match the exact model of my computer, and I know that the keys have been composed of various materials throughout the years...\n\nA: I have a rMBP.

It turns out that when I start Finder it is trying to live scan my entire disk, which is taking a really long since I had scan \"inside archives and compressed files\" checked. By unchecking this option, Finder loads much quicker and InterCheck spikes CPU usage briefly on start up and then goes back down to a reasonable level (which according to Sophos forums, is the normal behavior).\n", "Q: Back to My Mac - Can people see it?

I am a huge fan of the terminal-based music player cmus. It does everything I want from a music player and nothing I don't. I want to use it instead of iTunes on my Macbook. I installed it via homebrew and it's working great, except for one thing...\nI'm trying to set up a system hotkey to play/pause cmus even if it's not focused. cmus provides a command-line program to help you do this.\ncmus-remote --pause\n\nRunning that from anywhere will connect to the running cmus instance via a socket and issue the play/pause command.\nSo I'm trying to set up a system hotkey to run that command and play/pause cmus.

See this question \nOpen your Console and watch the logs when you run the service. In my case, it crashes when I try to run a shell script. \nI tried adding Automator to the Security and Privacy preferences, but it did not solve the issue. \nAs a work around, you may have to use applescript to create and app, tie that to a service, and add the app to the Privacy tab of your Security and Privacy preference pane.\n", "Q: AppleScript prints out keypresses, doesn't execute them I expect this script to switch applications (command tab):\n$ cat hello.applescript\ntell application \"System Events\"\n key code 48 using command down\nend tell\n\nBut it just prints out a tab:\n$ osascript hello.applescript\n⏎   \n\nI'm on OS X 10.9.4\n\nA: I've not used it inside a shellscript, only in 'pure' Applescript, but why not just \ntell application \"myApp\" to activate\n\n..it would prevent the randomness of which particular app was next in line.\n\nA: According to this you need to tell Finder as well:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n  tell process \"finder\"\n    activate\n    keystroke tab using {command down}\n  end tell\nend tell\n\nBut I also like the suggestion to specify the app by name...\n", "Q: How do I prevent my MacBook from sleeping when downloading apps from the App Store When I try to download large apps from the App Store whether on battery or AC power the displays turns off after time set and downloading also stops. \nThe Energy Saver preferences are set to defaults. \nWhat should I do to continue download even when display is off? \nI am using OS X 10.9.4 \n\nA: If you don't want to install any software or change settings, you can use the Terminal utility caffeinate. Open Terminal (located in /Applications/Utilities/), type in caffeinate, and press return ↩︎.\nIf you want to set a timeout so it will go to sleep after some amount of time, use this:\ncaffeinate -t 3600\n\nThat will make it stay awake for an hour. (3600 is the number of seconds you want it to stay awake.)\nTo stop or cancel the caffeinate command, press ^ ControlC.\n\nA: you can use caffeinate -w <the Process ID of the download> for this. \n\n\n*\n\n*caffeinate command makes your computer unable to fall asleep (although your display may), \n\n*the -w option makes it wait for a process to finish and before then your computer cannot fall sleep, which is exactly what you wanted to do.\nto do so you can first find the Process ID(PID) for your download with Activity Monitor, then open up Terminal(bash) and type in for example caffeinate -w 4708, replace the number with the PID you found.\n\n\n*\n\n*be careful with a low PID number as it may be a system process, in which case your computer may run on until the battery dies. \n\n*also if you plan on using this command often on certain processes, you may want to use caffeinate -w $(pidof <name of process>) instead, this will find the ID of the process you name each time (as PID is assigned by the system and will change each time you run it)\nthe advantage this has over \n\n\n*\n\n*changing system preferences: it doesn't require you to change the preference back once you're finished\n\n*caffeinate -t <number of seconds>: your download may not finish in a certain amount of time, in that case the goal is not achieved; or it may finish really quickly, in that case you would be wasting energy.\n\nA: You could try Caffeine from the Mac App Store:\n\nCaffeine is a tiny program that puts an icon in the right side of your menu bar.

If I hit the Menu button on the Apple TV remote, the Apple TV responds instantly, so it's not that the Apple TV has frozen. \nIf I instead start the movie from iTunes on the MacBook Pro, then display it on the Apple TV via AirPlay from the MacBook Pro's Display settings, the movie starts instantly and is shown on the Apple TV.\nWhy can I \"push\" the movie from the MacBook Pro to the Apple TV via AirPlay, but not \"pull\" the movie from the Apple TV's interface?\n\nA: I had the exact same problem as this before. Any number restarts and reboots in any order did not solve the problem.\nAt the same time I had a DNS issue with the default router setup from my ISP. When I changed my routers DNS to use the Google DNS it also solved my iTunes sharing problems. \nI don't know if this is actually what caused it or if it was just a big coincidence but it's been working fine ever since. \n\nA: Beamer.app does want you are asking.

I realize I can sync my Google calendar to my devices.  However, can someone explain to me in simple steps how to get my iPad, iPad mini, and iPhone 5S to return the calendar information to my Google calendar.  I would REALLY appreciate it:)  I have red various preposts similar but most of those questions and answers are about syncing from Google to Apple devices like mine.  Be gentle.  I am a newbie at this site.:)\n\nA: If you add your Google account in the \"Settings\" app under \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars\" the sync works in both directions: Events entered on http://calendar.google.com appear in the iOS calendar app and events saved into the Google calendars on your iPhone/iPad will appear on the Google Calendar website.\nHowever this works only for new events. If you have existing events that you would like to copy into Google Calendar you can use my free app SyncCal (iTunes Link).\n", "Q: Google has changed appearance using Safari 5.1.1 The way google is presenting as of today is totally different and I can no longer get the image pages so you can scroll the images before selecting one you want to see. Now there are individual boxes that click through. The entire appearance makes it no longer usuable.. Is there I can do to revert back to the way it was previously?  It shows perfectly on Firefox and nothing has changed there.\n\nA: I suspect it's an example of a new policy from Google, where they're deliberately showing old versions of their search pages if you use an out of date browser. You can find information about this from, for example, this BBC news report. \nIt's probably a good idea to update Safari, for security reasons. This is what Google are trying to get you to do. But if you have a good reason to keep using 5.1.1, you can see an up-to-date Google homepage by changing the user agent string. There are instructions for doing this available online, e.g. here.\n\nA: First I recommend you should update your Safari app.\nI just made a comparison using the same web site for Images.\nMy Safari (7.0.6) + Chrome + Firefox show exactly the same.\nThe top row shows the categories you can select (also as images).\nYou can scroll down true the images or select a category.\n", "Q: How would I find out if an application installed the wavtap.kext as part of its package? I'm experiencing many audiocore errors and am trying to narrow down the cause. \nA Google search has revealed that WavTap could potentially be the cause of these errors. \nWavTap is listed in my Audio Midi Setup despite my not having that application installed. \nI would like to know if it was installed by some other audio application I have as a tool that this secondary application relies upon to function completely/properly or whether I simply installed WavTap, myself, at some point in the past and missed the .kext when uninstalling. So, how might I go about finding out whether or not another application I have installed has a dependency upon WavTap.kext? \nthanks\n\nA: So, it turns out that WavTap.kext was installed as a part of the Spotydl package, an application that I had uninstalled nearly immediately and erased most traces of. Removing the WavTap.kext and the Spotydl .plist and .bom appears to have resolved some of the coreaudio errors, though, a reboot will be required to see if the component errors are still present and it seems unlikely that this issue was the cause of those. \nIf anyone is aware of a simple uninstaller which parses the InstallHistory.plist, please, let me know about it.

I figured a reboot would clear it out but it did not. The only place I can find that it works right now, strangely enough, is a textbox on a website in Chrome. So I can use it this dialog I'm typing in right now, but not the URL field of the browser.\nAny idea how to fix and/or reset this behavior? I'm lost without it.\n\nA: I found the answer. \nEven though it wasn't selected, I did have installed \"Unicode Hex Input\" as an Input Soure (along side U.S) in the Keyboard->Input Sources preference pane. I removed the Unicode option altogether, and the opt-arrow shortcut started working again instantly.\n\nA: This helped me find the solution for OS X 10.6/Snow Leopard, which is a little different. The Input Sources tab is under System Preferences->Language & Text, instead of Keyboard. I had Unicode Hex Input installed and enabled; unchecking it fixed the Option-Arrow problem, and re-checking it again doesn't seem to bring the problem back! Very strange. I'll probably leave it unchecked just in case.\nEdit: More details. It looks like the actual problem has to do with the Keyboard & Character Viewer item in the menu bar. (This appears as a national flag when nation-specific input is selected, or a yellow-on-purple \"U+\" when Unicode Hex Input is selected.) When Unicode Hex Input is selected in the Keyboard & Character Viewer, the Option-Arrow keys don't work in some apps. You can leave Unicode installed and enabled in Language & Text->Input Sources, but it can't be selected in the Keyboard & Character Viewer.\n", "Q: How to identify application of hung menu bar icon My Mac sometimes ends in a state with high CPU usage for SystemUIServer. This causes poor performance and decreased battery life.\nI can resolve the problem by rebooting the machine but the problem inevitably reappears after some time.\nI have found out that this seems to be caused by an application that has an icon in the menu bar. I tried closing all such applications by right-clicking them and selecting their Quit menu item. Now, I notice a gap in the menu line and when I hover the mouse cursor over the gap then I see the infamous spinning beach ball of death.\n\nHow do I identify the misbehaving the underlying application – i.e. its name and/or filesystem path?\nI am running Mac OS X Lion version 10.7.5\n\nA: You can look in Activity Monitor's list of processes for any which are not responding. Such processes are shown in red, as below, and can be force quit or killed.\n\n\nA: Use the Accessibility Inspector, accessible from Xcode → Open Developer Tool → Accessibility Inspector.\nClick \"Show\" on the \"Hierarchy\" sub-section (which will show you the Application Name).\nClick on the \"Target Icon\" at the top of the Inspector (Labeled: Start inspection follows point).\nHover over the item and the pane may show you enough information for you to determine what it is. For example, hovering the Dropbox menu bar item shows \"Dropbox <version>\" under AXHelp, and hovering Little Snitch shows \"Little Snitch Agent\" under AXTitle.\n\nA: Try opening a terminal window and entering killall SystemUIServer and press enter, this should reload your menu bar.\nYou can also try copyingcom.apple.systemuiserver.plist from ~/Library/Preferences to your desktop, then deleting it from the Preferences folder. This will force a new .plist to be created. \nYou may just want to run this handy command from terminal:\n cp ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systemuiserver.plist ~/Desktop/com.apple.systemuiserver.plist ; rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.systemuiserver.plist ; echo 'All done here.

I have a new AirPort Extreme and a mid-2014 MacBook Pro. Both devices are 802.11ac but (according to iStumbler) my ac signal is weaker than my b/g/n signal (no matter where I move my antenna).\n\nWhy is my ac signal is weaker than my b/g/n signal? Does that mean that my (brand new) MBP is performing worse than a b/g/n machine would?\n\nA: The ac is 5GHz signal. \nThe way the radio waves work is the higher the frequency the lover the range. \nHowever, the signal strength is only one factor. \nWith your signal strength on 5GHz network you will still get much higher data throughput, then on the b, g, n (which is on 2.5 GHz WiFi).\nUnfortunately the 5GHz is also more sensitive to the interferences (like for the microwave ect..)\nSignal strength:\nSince the Radio waves jungle are controlled by our Government, you can not exceed the given power output to boost the signal (otherwise you might have Jumbo-jet landing in your backyard). Engineering the multiple antennas (arrays) can help directing the beam from the broadcasting station to the receiver, to help with the distribution of the 5GHz signal. Standard antennas are ommi-directional (broadcast equally in all directions). Using a directional antenna is the solution here, where the beam goes focused in one direction.\n", "Q: Services menu shows the incorrect name I made a Service in Automator, but when I was saving mistyped the name. I used Automator to rename the Service, but the incorrect name shows up in my Services menu.\nI checked the ~/Library/Services directory and the name is correct and the file metadata shows the correct name.\nWhy does the Services menu show the old name and how do I fix it?\n\nA: Try rebuilding the Launch Services database.\nOpen the Terminal and run the following command:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user\n\n\nA: Or, you can open up the service in AppleScript Editor and correct the name/spelling just by deleting and retyping. \n", "Q: Change default Preview window size? I'm working with LaTex and I'm using a text editor that, when I compile LaTeX files, runs a script to open the compiled pdf in Preview. The trouble is that Preview opens in the same default dimensions every time, which covers up other applications I have open.\nIt's not a huge deal, but it would be nice to have Preview open flushed right and as half the width of the screen every time. Since I'm opening and closing it so often, moving it and resizing it every time gets really annoying.\nI realize this isn't a built-in option for Preview, but is there any way of doing it using Terminal or otherwise? I've googled around and haven't found any satisfactory answers yet.\n\nA: You might want to check out this question: What window management options exist for OS X?\nMy recommendation, if you want it to be fully automatic, is to use Slate.\nSlate is no longer in active development, but it still works and is highly customizable. Put this code in a .slate.js file in your home directory:\nvar rightHalf = slate.operation(\"move\", {\n   \"x\" : \"screenSizeX/2+screenOriginX\",\n   \"y\" : \"screenOriginY\",\n   \"width\" : \"screenSizeX/2\",\n   \"height\" : \"screenSizeY\"\n});\nslate.on(\"windowOpened\", function(event, win) {\n    if (win.app().name() === \"Preview\") {\n        win.doOperation(rightHalf);\n    }\n});\n\n\nA: You might also look into iSnap and Moom.\nThey're window manager applications. You can set preferences to snap windows to a particular location and or size & shape. Better Touch Tool also has a version of this functionality. These apps provide shortcuts essentially to having windows go where and how you want them to be displayed.\n", "Q: MBP Connected to WiFi but won't connect to Web I'm connected to WiFi but won't connect to the Web.

I've run diagnostics and it says it's working fine. Can anyone help?\n\nA: I've asked some questions to help debug as a comment, but this is what I would try:\n1) Turn off all extensions in Safari (Safari menu -> Preferences -> Extensions)\n2) Rule out DNS issues - try to ping a site. Open Terminal (in Applications -> Utilities).

It usually appears for some apps that I've uninstalled before and I want to install again.\nNb. I have forgotten my iCloud password, but i can use the iPhone that do not use iCloud normally.\n\nA: The cloud symbol means that the app is associated with your account and has been previously installed using your Apple ID (on any of your devices).

I am using a 13-inch Mid 2012 MacBook Pro that I got about an year ago. I am a writer and work primarily on Word, Safari & Preview. And I work on the machine for an average of about 16-18 hours a day.\nIt's become slow several times and I have already re-installed the OS twice. I installed Mac OS X 10.9.4 Mavericks after it was released and I upgraded my RAM so that it has 10 GB of RAM instead of the standard 4 GB RAM.\nStill the MacBook Pro has become slow again and—more problematically—it has started shutting down without any warning or any notice after re-start.\nI cleaned the Mac, reset SMC and increased the free space on it. Still the crashing problem continues. \n\nA: Sudden shut-downs I would always attribute to heat - dust/fluff collecting in the fans & heat sink fins. It takes more than a quick run-round with a duster or a can of air to properly clean out the fins; it needs splitting open & getting in properly - even so far as replacing the heat sink paste.\nIt's not a job for a beginner, especially on a laptop, but the guys at the Genius bar ought to be able to steer you in the right direction.\n\nA: Word, Safari and Preview won't overload any machine with 10Gb of RAM. I'm going with heat too.\nMost laptops have cooling issues, esp. in extended use. Try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Always use it on a hard surface. No fabric at all. A metal surface is even better.\n\n*Keep the room temperature below 26 degrees\n\n*No direct sunlight\n\n*Put a small fan behind the screen, blowing toward the vents in the hinge. A cheap 10cm USB fan is fine, we just want some air movement. (but don't plug it into the laptop)\n2 years old shouldn't have severe dust problems unless the environment has severe dust problems (like a cat). However, heat damage is cumulative. If the hardware is already shutting down because it has been overheated in the past then it's not possible to repair it.\n\nA: You, also, might try a laptop stand that elevates the machine and/or has fans or some other kind of cooling component built-in. \nThat duration of daily work would really be more appropriate for a desktop computer. For that matter, desktop computers are the more logical choice for any work which does not require bringing a specific computer into the field and/or around to various locations throughout the workday. Not only are you putting excessive wear on the machine, you're putting excessive wear on your body. Ergonomically, you want a screen to be eye-level when your head is facing straight ahead and a keyboard to meet your hands where your shoulders and elbows are at their natural positions of bent rest. This is impossible with a laptop and results in notable damage to the neck and wrists, initially, with other spinal and hip problems to follow. For the sake of your body, which cannot be replaced at the Apple Store when it goes bad, please, look into getting an iMac or Mac Mini. \n", "Q: How can I play a MIDI file on my MIDI keyboard? I have a MIDI file example.mid on my Mac OS X 10.6 laptop. \nThe laptop is connected to a MIDI keyboard (old Yamaha Clavinova, if it matters) via a Roland UM-One mk2 USB-MIDI interface. Using Apple's Audio MIDI Setup utility, I have configured the interface. Audio MIDI Setup's \"Test Setup\" feature will make my keyboard play notes. I can play notes on the keyboard, and have them appear in the MuseScore notation app. Thus, I think I have the laptop connected to the Clavinova correctly.\nHow can I make the notes in my MIDI file example.mid play on the MIDI keyboard, via the Mac OS X 10.6 laptop?  I don't want the Mac OS software to make sounds, I want the Clavinova to make the sounds. Quicktime Player and VLC generate sound themselves, so they don't seem to do what I want.  I suspect I want a different kind of utility, which relays the contents of the MIDI file to the MIDI interface, for the keyboard to receive and play.\nI think part of the answer will be to explain what that MIDI-relay utility is called. I see references to \"sequencers\" and \"DAWs\" in articles like Wikipedia's List of MIDI editors and sequencers, but the article doesn't really explain whether a \"sequencer\" or \"DAW\" is supposed to do what I am looking for.\n\nA: It seems like the wording I'm looking for is \"plays MIDI files on an external device\". \nMost software I found which claimed to \"play MIDI files\" did so using QuickTime or their own code to make sounds. \nI'll quote Tetsujin's helpful definition for 'sequencer' and 'digital audio workstation':\n\nA \"sequencer\" is the descriptive name of a piece of software originally designed specifically for the recording/playback of MIDI data [usually through an external device, such as your Clavinova] These days, you would expect that one could also deal with audio recordings, software instrument plugins [soft-synths] etc. \nA DAW is a 'digital audio workstation'... fancy name for a 'sequencer' ;-) \n\nThe specific software I found to play MIDI files on my external device was Aria Maestosa. This is a MIDI editor/sequencer which is GPL licensed. Starting with version 1.4, it  \"Support[s] sending midi output to external devices\".  The current newest version of Aria Maestosa, 1.4.10, requires Mac OS X 10.7 or above. I fell back to Aria Maestosa 1.4.9 for Mac OS X 10.6, dated 2013-10-27.\nI ran Aria Maestosa, selected my MIDI interface via the \"Output\" menu, imported a MIDI file, then pressed the \"play\" buttons. The music came from my Clavinova, not from the computer.

My eye was drawn to 'Mighty Midi', on the second page - http://www.440audio.com/en/software/v705-Fenix-Wox-Mighty-MIDI/ though I haven't tried it myself.\nThe Clavinova, depending on its age, would be expected to be able to handle GM [General Midi] or XG [Expanded spec GM] files - though if the files were made for Roland they may not sound great on Yamaha & vice versa, as the voicings & sonic spec were very different.\nIf you want to dig deeper into the workings of the files, then perhaps Yamaha's XG Edit software would be a good place to look [though it's many years old now & the chap who wrote it has long since left Yamaha, it still should work] http://www.yamahamusicsoft.com/en/category/Computer+Software/product/1017294/XG+Edit/?currency=USD \nIf you need more info, let me know. \nEdit - Sorry, I just realised XGEdit is OS9 or Windows only, apologies.\n", "Q: Is there an iOS app that uploads files to websites? My iPad can only uploads pictures to any website in the browser. My iPad is not jailbroken and I am not planning to jailbroke it. Is their an app in the App Store that can enable me to upload any file I want (ex: PDF, docs) to any website I visit. Their is a app called Iuploader that cost 15 dollars that does what I want but is a bit expensive in my opinion, is their any other app that does the same thing but is cheaper.\n\nA: iCab Mobile claims to support uploads. \nhttps://appsto.re/gb/mKwxs.i\nYou will probably need to do an \"Open in ...\" to get it into iCab first. \n", "Q: Retrieve data after deleting from Trash in OS X I deleted some important data mistakenly from Trash but I need to retrieve it asap. Is there any way to retrieve it either in Terminal or manually?\n\nA: If you have used Time Machine this will be rather easy:\nGo to the Applications folder and open the Time Machine application. Browse to where the file used to live, go to previous backups until it appears, then choose \"Restore\" from the right-click menu.\nOtherwise, if you are still using the same computer, then you really are in trouble. The chances of recovery with tools like Data Rescue go down every minute the machine is in use.\n", "Q: Migrating from MBA 2013 to Mac Mini Mid 2011 using Carbon Copy Cloner I've been using my 2013 MBA for music production using Logic Pro X, and I've downloaded all the additional Apple content for it. Also, the MBA has a few other apps and docs I use. \nI've recently bought a mid 2011 Mac Mini, and installed Mavericks on there, then I went ahead and used Time Machine on the MBA to create a backup, and then I used that backup on the Mac Mini, so that I could have all the apps and content (esp. Logic's content) available on the Mac Mini, since I am starved for bandwidth here in South Africa.\nProblem is that it Migration Assistant didn't restore any of the 35-odd GB of Logic Pro content on the Mac Mini, although I can see the content on the backup drive's file system.\nWould I achieve my end result (full bootable 1:1 carbon copy of my MBA) on the Mac Mini if I use Carbon Copy Cloner?\nThanks!\n\nA: My experience with Carbon Copy Cloner, which I use for daily backups of my external drives and for monthly checksum backups, is that, yes, it will copy anything that you do not tell it to specifically exclude. \nI'm wondering, however, if there is not a more simple way to do this; did you, by any chance, download the 'extras' directly from Apple, as opposed to from the Mac App Store, as a .pkg that you might have retained and, so, could simply reinstall? Many people had problems downloading the extras in the traditional manner and Apple made all (?) (most, at any rate) of those 'pro packs' available as a direct download from their site. The link I have for that download is:\nhttp://audiocontentdownload.apple.com/lp10_ms3_content_2013/ProAudioCoreContent10.pkg\n\nA: 'Bootable' might be the issue... it will certainly clone accurately, but whether that OS will be happy on the Mini I couldn't say. You may end up reinstalling the OS again over it to get the right kexts etc in place.\nIf you make sure that CCC adds a recovery partition, that might be relatively simple, but it's not something I've done myself, so I can't say for certain.\n", "Q: How to export Pages document to .docx? This question is pretty similar to this one:\nHow can I save a Pages document to .docx?\nUnfortunatly, the answers provided to this old one don't work with:\nMountain Lion        10.8.5\nPages ’09            4.3\n\nI already found a transition path which is going through the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*From Pages export as a .doc,\n\n*Open the .doc file with LibreOffice and save it as a .docx file.\n\n\nUnfortunately, this conversion leads to files containing a lot of useless\nlist styles which are a real trouble to continue working on the converted file. See this related question on these useless styles:\nGet rid of WW8Num* list styles upon exporting from Pages?.\n\nHow to export a Pages document under .docx format?\n\nA: The current Pages beta on iCloud.com gave a very faithful export from Pages > Word .docx format (I shared the document with myself by email, but there may be a more appropriate way for you to do it). You can drag and drop a Pages file from your desktop into iCloud without fear of irreparably converting your original Pages '09 file.\n", "Q: Save program from iPad to Mac I bought some program for iPad and this program became crucial for my work - if the iPad will corrupt/+developer delete the program from AppStore I will be in great trouble. \nSo, my question is how can I save the program from iPad to MBP (from MBP to external HDD) to prevent any future corruptions of the program/store etc. Could I reinstall the program back to any new iPad from HDD only (if it will be unaccessible from Appstore). \n\nA: You can log into your iTunes Store account in iTunes on the Mac and download the app there. As long as you have a copy on your Mac you can always sync it to your iPad if required.\nThe .ipa file (the app) is stored in /Users/<youruser>/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications, the name may need some guessing. You can also right-click on the app icon directly in the App view in iTunes and select \"Show in Finder\"\n\n", "Q: Hard drive and power consumption of current Time Capsule What kind of hard drive is build into the current Time Capsule? Is it a SSD? Also, how energy efficient is the current Time Capsule, how much energy does it consume? I can't find this info on Apples product pages.\n\nA: Since it's a 2TB or 3TB storage you can be sure it's HDD, since the price is 'only' 299$ or 399$. There are for the moment no (commercial) 2TB SSD drives or maybe one or two which are really really expensive. On the product page is also stated that the Time capsule is ussing a Hard drive, otherwise there would be stated Soild State drive or similar.\nThe enviromental report, including energy usage can be found here: https://www.apple.com/environment/reports/docs/AirPortTimeCapsule_PER_feb2014.pdf\n\nA: When in use, apple states it uses 11watts at 115 volts. The power supply is 88 percent efficient according to apple. These figures refer to the now current (december 2014) version of time capsule and apply to both the 2gb and 3gb model\n", "Q: Using last column in Numbers I would like to subtract the last column of a specific row. Since the number of columns is always changing, I need to get it dynamically. I figured there is a function that gives you the number of columns of a row. But I am not able to tell Numbers to use it (because I don't know the syntax).\n\nA: I'm not 100% clear what you're asking to do since you haven't posted any of the contents of the sheet, but you can use the INDEX, ROWS and COLUMNS formulas to get what you want. INDEX() will return the contents of a cell within a certain range of cells, and you can use rows() to count the number of rows and columns() to count the number of columns, depending on exactly what you need. Without knowing how ranges are defined and things are labelled it's hard to be more specific, but I think that will get you started in the right direction.\nIf that doesn't help, maybe you could post what you've tried and give us some example data & formulas.\n\nA: If the value you want to reference is always in the last column of your sheet you can try:\nINDEX(2:2,1,COLUMNS(2:2,0),area-index)\nIf you have no empty cells between the starting and final value (zeros are fine here) and empty cells (no zeros) after the desired reference you can try:\nINDEX(2:2,1,COUNTA(2:2)+1,area-index)\nIf your table is made up of entered values you would need to fill the blank spaces for this to work. \nThis second one will return the final value of row 2 in a sheet with one header column. Because COUNTA() excludes header columns, replace “+1” with the number of header columns in your sheet. This is a potential bug source if this detail is forgotten and the header setting is changed. The following formula avoids this problem:\nINDEX(2:2,1,COLUMNS(2:2,0)−COUNTBLANK(2:2),area-index)\nIf your table has zero values beyond the desired reference (likely the case for formulas rather than entered values) you can try one that subtracts null values, but this is problematic if you have zeros in your data:\nINDEX(2:2,1,COLUMNS(2:2,0)−COUNTIF(2:2,\"=0\"),area-index)\nI hope this helped. \n", "Q: Are there hidden files taking up 10GB on my hard disk? I was cleaning up my hard drive this morning, 128GB ssd in a macbook pro, and there seems to be about 10GB of data that isn't appearing in the exposed file system.\nI'm using the GUI interface with cmd+click -> get info, here's the breakdown:\nHard Drive: 98.8GB on disk\nthen in the Hard Drive Directory:\nSystem: 6.5GB\nApplications: 23.7GB\nUser:47.5GB\nLibrary: 11GB\nopt:174MB\nUser Information: 4 KB\nthat adds up to ~89GB. Where are the missing 10GBs? I'm starting to regret not springing for the bigger hard drive, though I guess it would just postpone the issue.\nAre hidden files hidden from the file-by-file get info panel?\n\nA: There are easily 10Gb of files hidden from the Finder.\nGet Info on a disk and Get Info on a folder work differently. On a disk, it simply asks the disk resource for a count of the used blocks and thus gets an answer almost immediately. This value accurately reflects how much is stored on the drive in question.\nGet Info on a folder digs through that folder and adds up the size of each file that you are able to read. You cannot, for example, know how much another user has in their Mail folder by running Get Info on the User folder.\nAlso, there is a difference between the file size and the space-on-disk size. Storing a single character in a file will consume 4kb of disk space, the rest is wasted. One million one-byte files will therefore use 4Gb of space on disk.\nFiles hidden from the Finder include almost the entire Unix subsystem, many low-level config files, virtual memory, sleep images, and the system caches. Don't even think about deleting them - your computer will not boot, and the caches will simply get refilled.\nOn the plus side, the Mac OS takes care of itself quite well. You the user, have absolutely no need to concern yourself with the inner workings, nor do you need 3rd-party utilities to do any maintenance (most of them don't do anything effective except reduce your bank balance).\nA very easy way to reclaim a lot of space is get an external and move your iPhoto and iTunes libraries there.\n", "Q: Shortcut to display storage information Obsessed with how much space left in Macbook Air 128GB SSD,  I find myself frequently checking the storage information by going to \"About this mac\" ==> \"More info\" ==> \"storage\".\nIs there a shortcut to do that? keyboard shortcut or desktop shortcut for example.\n\nA: The bottom of any Finder window if you toggle Show Status Bar from the View Menu...\n\nWill then add this to the bottom of the window [It's selected on a per window basis, as far as I can tell]\n\n\nA: There were a few suggestions here - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17472800/how-can-using-applescript-show-about-this-mac\n", "Q: Using 2010 21\" iMac as second display I have a 15\" Macbook Pro, late 2010, and a 21\" iMac, late 2009. Can I link the iMac and use it with the Macbook Pro as a second display?\nA friend may give me his desktop to use as a display. Believe it's a Dell. Would I be able to link that to either/both?\nBoth computers are running Mavericks.\nThanks,\nShayna\n\nA: Yes, since OS X 10.9 Mavericks there is a function called Target Display Mode or short TDM. In short: this is a manner to use your iMac as screen for another Mac, not for PC's. You can connect your mac by miniDisplayport or Thunderbolt cables.\nUnfortunately you need an 27-inch iMac Late 2009 or Mid 2010 to use mini display port, or an iMac-21 inch mid 2011 or iMac 27-inch Mid 2011 to use Thunderbolt. \nAll the requirements can be found here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3924\nYou surely can use a Dell screen, if you've got a minidisplayport or thunderbolt port, then you can buy a minidisplayport to HDMI/VGA/DVI... Best way is to check out which connections you've got on your iMac and then search for an transformer. (You just can use an minidisplay cable in an thunderbolt port). A workaround could be an USB display adapter, but those don't have the best preformance...\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Migration from one Macbook to another I am going to buy new Macbook and want to transfer all my programs and data to it.  I have googled and as I see the Migration Assistant the best way to do it.

The new one will have 10.9 version.  Can I use Migration Assistant in this case or it will be better to upgrade the new Macbook to 10.10 firstly ?\n\n\nA: The Migration Assistant was made by Apple for one purpose only, so it is the best way to migrate from one device to another.\nAs for the 10.10 since it is still in beta phases, the Migration Assistant on the host computer might not work as it should, since beta phase testing is not completed yet.\nSince 10.10 has it own way of managing the files ect... the transfer to 10.9 might have problems with that.\n10.10 Release notes: \nOS X 10.10 Installation\nKnown Issues\nMigration Assistant may hang while transferring your information from a Time Machine backup.

But in the terminal, when I do:\n  javac -version\n\nIt still reports 1.6.0_65\nWhat am I doing wrong?\nI'm using Mavericks 10.9.4\n\nA: What does your .bash_profile say? There should be a line:\nexport JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.6`\n\nYou just have to change the Java version from 1.6 to 1.8 and then reload the system variables (. ~/.bash_profile). Tried this out changing between jdk7 and jdk6. So version 8 shouldn't be an exception.\n\nA: From http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/mac_jdk.html#A1096875\nDetermining the Default Version of the JDK\nIf you have not yet installed Apple's Java OS X 2012-006 update, then you are still using a version of Apple Java 6 that includes the plug-in and the Java Preferences app. See \"Note for Users of OS X that Include Apple Java 6 Plug-in\".\nThere can be multiple JDKs installed on a system, as many as you wish.\nWhen launching a Java application through the command line, the system uses the default JDK. It is possible for the version of the JRE to be different than the version of the JDK.\nYou can determine which version of the JDK is the default by typing java -version in a Terminal window. If the installed version is 8u6, you will see a string that includes the text 1.8.0_06. For example:\n% java -version\njava version \"1.8.0_06-ea\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_06-ea-b13)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.2-b04, mixed mode)\n\nTo run a different version of Java, either specify the full path, or use the java_home tool:\n% /usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8.0_06 --exec javac -version\n\nFor more information, see the java_home(1) man page.\n", "Q: Is my MacBook Air's trackpad broken? I have a 6 month old MacBook air. I use it for my online business at least a few hours a day and don't have a wireless mouse so I click the trackpad a lot. Lately it isn't always working when I light tap with my finger. If I use the pad a lot does it break easy?\n\nA: Is it possible something got stuck or is otherwise jamming the trackpad?  Best bet may be to have genius bar take a look.  \nOn older macbooks there was an physical adjustment you could make on the trackpack (open the case, remove some stuff, adjust screw).  And we had a problem with the battery swelling which caused the trackpad to stop working (essentially prevented the \"click\" action, as it was pushing the trackpad up).\n\nA: That much use shouldn't break it. If you can part with it for a couple days, you may want to have Apple service it (it should still be under the 1-yr warranty) just in case the trackpad breaks completely.\n", "Q: How can I mirror my OS X screen and functionality to an Android tablet? Trying to create a cheap cockpit type chart plotter/navigation setup for my friends yacht. Thought the most cost effective way would be with an osx laptop we have running inavx (or similar) and an Android tablet mirror. Is this possible?\n\nA: OS X has a built in VNC-compatible server (This is for 10.9, older versions have it but I'm not sure if some earlier ones have the controls somewhere else):\n\n\n*\n\n*Check System Preferences > Sharing > Screen Sharing\n\n*Click Computer settings… > VNC viewers may control screen with password: (set a password)\n\n*Setup an ad-hoc WiFi connection between the tablet and the laptop: Click Create Network… from the Airport menu and connect to it from the tablet.\n\n*Using a VNC client on the tablet, such as: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=android.androidVNC&hl=en, connect to the laptop using the Bonjour address and the password you set above—Back on the Screen Sharing page, it will say something like Other users can access your computer's screen at vnc://mdryden-mbp.local.\nWith any luck, the laptop's screen should appear on the tablet and you'll be able to control it. I haven't tried the app above, but many tablet VNC clients can be configured to both move the cursor and click upon tapping, or else have a virtual trackpad on screen.\n\nA: I was doing some research for a different but similar request as this and ran across AirDisplay from Avatron Software.  (I am not affiliated with them in any way)\nIt allows you to extend your desktop to an iOS or Android device.  What's really interesting is that it allows you to interact through that device.\nSo, you could have that particular navigation app running on the extended display (the tablet) and you could still interact with it.  I am testing their software to extend a Mac to a display running Windows and so far, it's working well.  They have free trials for tablets, too.  The price is reasonable at $20\n", "Q: Mavericks 'close the clam' woes I typically use my \"Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013\" MBP at work with the lid closed, connected to an external monitor, a bluetooth trackpad, and a USB keyboard. For the last few months, the results of disconnecting these items and opening the lid have been very frustrating: a black screen that cannot be woken. I end up power-cycling.\nI started to compensate by opening the lid before disconnection. For a while, that worked. Most recently, the result of this is that the monitor is alive, but the builtin keyboard and trackpad are ignored. The bluetooth trackpad (if in range) works just fine.

It certainly allows you to create a task to copy a given set of folders to any destination you can mount. It's not expensive ($40 US) and offers a trial version so you can check it out before ponying up the dollars.\nI'm assuming you have figured out how to mount your Windows Home Server via SMB.\n\nA: ChronoSync is an option for syncing Windows and Mac. You can request a trial license key through their website to test it out and see if it works for your situation:\nhttp://www.econtechnologies.com/support/trial-key.php\n", "Q: Old MacBook Pro 17\" freezes when WiFi gets turned off I recently updated from Mountain Lion to Mavericks 10.9.4 on my late 2007 MacBook Pro 17\". Now every time I turn off WiFi, the computer freezes within a few seconds to a few minutes. Upon reboot, the computer freezes again very quickly (sometimes at the login screen, sometimes right after getting to the desktop). I assume this happens as soon as the computer checks the WiFi state and sees that it's off.  It all happens too quickly for me to flip the WiFi back on.\nI thought I was stuck (save for wiping the computer and reinstalling the OS every time this accidentally happens), but someone found a partial solution, posted on the following thread:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/5603415?start=21\nThe user \"Ira Wolf 81\" identified 4 steps which I will copy below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into single user mode (command ⌘+S)\n\n*Make volume read-write (mount -uw /)\n\n*Edit /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist to change the PowerEnabled setting for the Airport Interface (usually en1) from false to true\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nThis worked for me, and I'm grateful to be able to use my computer again. But (1) it doesn't address the underlying issue of why turning off WiFi would freeze the computer, and (2) I have to manually follow these 4 steps anew every time this happens.\nSo I'm wondering if a script can automate Ira Wolf 81's solution.  One idea is to read and possibly edit that preferences.plist file every time the computer gets booted normally, and to do this before the OS can read that file.\nAnyone want to take a crack at this?\nAlternatively, if anyone knows how to fix the underlying issue, that would be cool too.\nEdit:\nIn the name of science, I just intentionally turned off WiFi and waited for my computer to freeze (which it did), all the while secretly logging its actions with the Console. Here are the logs from the moment I turned off WiFi at 5:31:42 PM right up until the freeze at about 5:33 PM:\n5:31:42.000 PM kernel: AirPort: Link Down on en1.

Basically I wrote a bash script to check the WiFi status and turn it on if it's off.  I then wrote two plist files for calling the script with launchd: one plist is a daemon and it calls the script right at boot, the other is an agent and it calls the script whenever the following file is modified: /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist.  That's the file that the OS stores the WiFi status in.\nI put all my code up on GitHub and made a simple installer:\nhttps://github.com/dmuenz/KeepWiFiOn\nI've only tested this on my own computer.\n\nA: Thanks for the Console log.

It's possible to enable spinning down of mechanical hard drives using the \"Put hard disks to sleep when possible\" option in Energy Saver, and it's possible to customize the timeout period with sudo pmset -a disksleep MIN.\nHowever, if I understand the man pages correctly, this applies to all hard drives connected to the system. Is it possible to only target one HDD (ideally, by UUID)? I have no objection to installing a 3rd party app to accomplish this functionality.\n\nA: The Terminal command diskutil eject <disk_identifier> is what you are looking for.\n<disk_identifier> can take the UUID of the drive as an argument.\nTo get the disk identifier of all mounted disks, execute the mount command.\nOn my Mac, the mount command gives this:\n/dev/disk3 on / (hfs, local, journaled)    \n/dev/disk4s2 on /Volumes/iTunes (hfs, local, nodev, nosuid, journaled, noowners)    \n/dev/disk5s2 on /Volumes/TM_Backup (hfs, local, nodev, nosuid, journaled) \n\nTo spin down /Volumes/iTunes, I'd execute either one of the commands\ndiskutil eject /dev/disk4\nor\ndiskutil eject /Volumes/iTunes.\nTo spin up /Volumes/iTunes, I need to execute the command:\ndiskutil mountDisk /dev/disk4. mountDisk only works with /dev/disk* disk identifiers.\nSee man diskutil for more information.\n", "Q: AirDrop iphone to MacBook At work I airdrop files with coworkers all the time but I often need to move photos from my iphone 5 to my laptop but I can't figure out how.\nIf I select the images and open the send page which lists options to send my text, email, Facebook, etc.  it lists airdrop above all the other options but it doesn't seem to be clickable.\nI have airdrop open on my mac.\n\n\nA: Quote from Apple page http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5887?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US\n\nYou can't use AirDrop on iOS to share with OS X users, and OS X users can't use AirDrop to share with iOS devices.\n\nAirdrop between iOS and OS X will be available from iOS8 and Yosemite.\n", "Q: Allowing MDM users to not only enroll devices (/mydevices) but also assign them to certain groups? So I would love to allow one of our users access to not only add their own devices (as they do now by going to server/mydevices), but also decide which group the device should belong to.\nThe user has 3 different types of devices all which should belong in separate groups. As of now we allow the user to add the device using Apple Configurator or by going to the mydevices interface and enrolling it directly from the device, but after that there's no way for them to specify that the device should end up in a certain device group.\nIs there any way to allow the user to select a group for the device to go into?

This is illustrated by the requirement that a compatible device, which will be limited to the iPhone 5 or later, fourth-generation iPad, iPad mini, and fifth-generation iPod touch, have both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi enabled.\nWhen AirDrop is activated, it uses Bluetooth to scan for nearby devices that are advertising discoverability.

I see that on retina screen, font is smooth, and in almost applications, I see font is always smooth, too but not in Unity. I'm currently using Unity 4.6 free edition and Mac OS X Maverick version.\nI have uploaded an image demo. As you see, font in taskbar, title bar is smooth, but font inside unity doesn't. I have watched some demos online using unity too and I see their font screen is smooth, not as I am.\nPlease explain for me why and how can I fix this.\nThanks :)\n\n\nA: Retina must be supported by the app for it to be displayed in Retina. If the app does not support Retina then the app will not be displayed in Retina.\nYou may be able to force Retina for an app with Retinizer:\n\n\nRetinizer is a small app I wrote that allows apps that aren’t retina ready and are displayed pixelated at 1x to display their UI widgets at 2x. That way, only their custom images will look bad and not the whole app.\n\nRelated: Some applications open in low resolution\n\nA: You can add key to the Info.plist file from this app. It's located inside app bundle, for example:\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Info.plist\nThe key which needs to be added is:\n<key>NSHighResolutionCapable</key> \n<string>True</string>\n\nNOTE: make a copy of Your app first, so that You won't break anything.\n\nA: You can add key to the Info.plist file from this app. It's located inside app bundle, for example:\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Info.plist\n\nThe key which needs to be added is:\n<key>NSHighResolutionCapable</key> \n<string>True</string>\n\n", "Q: Convert bdf file to ttf I'm trying to convert HelveticaCY.dfont to a ttf font. The MacOS softs that I used didn't work well so I tried Fondu which gave me this files :\nHelveticaCY-10.bdf\nHelveticaCY-12.bdf\nHelveticaCY.dfont\nHelveticaCYBold-10.bdf\nHelveticaCYBold-12.bdf\nHelveticaCYBold.ttf\nHelveticaCYBoldItalic-10.bdf\nHelveticaCYBoldItalic-12.bdf\nHelveticaCYBoldOblique.ttf\nHelveticaCYItalic-10.bdf\nHelveticaCYItalic-12.bdf\nHelveticaCYOblique.ttf\nHelveticaCYPlain.ttf\n\nUnfortunately, the *.ttf files doesn't contain the special chars (such as é, è ...). My guess is that this chars are in the *.bdf files but I have no idea of how convert it to a ttf file...\nEDIT\nAs suggested, I used the Helvetica.dfont file. Here's the result : on the left, when I open the ttf file, on the right, when I use quick preview...\n\nNo accent on both side...\n\nA: For converting file types (fonts) from Macs (.dfont) to TrueTypeFont (.ttf) that then can be used with Windows I recommend to use the DfontSplitter.\n\nConvert Macintosh .dfont files into TTF format\n\nHowever, converting file type will not add new characters, it will only convert the file type while the characters stay the same.\nFor Latin fonts the (special characters) and accents are keyboard feature and can be set in the keyboard system preferences.\nI you have for example US keyboard and want to use the French accents like èé ÈÉ, set your keyboard to French. \nBut if you want to continue to the US keyboard and still need those characters, then use the:\n1- Insert function from the (Characters viewer)\n2- create a special function \"Replace- With\" in keyboard menu, then use a word to be replaced with the accent character. (now you just type the word and it will be replaced)\n3- or another way is to use this method (while keeping your original keyboard layout:\n: To get accented vowels on a Mac, hold down the Option key, and while holding it down, type the letter e; to get (é É) then release those keys and type the letter that you want the accent to appear on:\nPress alt and e now release those keys and type the letter you want with accent.\n4- Finally if you just hold the key pressed there should be a pop up allowing you to select the right accent for that letter.\nSo the choice is your what method suits you best. \n\nA: To type French characters you normally don't need to worry about the font.  With the US keyboard layout, just hold down the key for the base character and choose the accented version from the popup menu that appears (10.7 and later) or use the standard option key shortcuts you can find at\nhttp://symbolcodes.tlt.psu.edu/accents/codemac.html \n", "Q: Data toll tripled from Android to IOS, no changes in usage habits. How to troubleshoot? Possibly redirect and sniff (tips on how)? So I've just bought my iPhone 5s with iOS 7.1.2, moving from Android. I've noticed that my data toll has more than tripled (from around 300MB to 1.1GB monthly) without significant changes in my usage habits.\nStrange things like Calendar using 30MB (I can't imagine calendar events as being BLOBs), Safari almost 500MB (no youtube or anything over 3G) and Facebook 250MB (auto-streaming disabled), while on android those three combined wouldn't have costed me more than 200MB. Again, I haven't changed my usage habits significantly. System services alone costed me more than 100MB (yes, I live in Argentina, 500MB is one of the typical allowances, and no, moving to SF is not an option right now)\nMy first question would be, do you know of a way to troubleshoot this issue?\nI'm a bit hackerly, so my first approach is trying to sniff on my traffic to determine what kind of data my iPhone is so eagerly exchanging. How would you go about driving all internet traffic through a proxy (not just HTTP)? All 3G traffic?\nIs it reasonable to assume that my iPhone has the same internet activity over WiFi and over 3G? \nIs there anything else you'd advise me about this? Anyone else with the same problem?\n\nA: You have multiple questions here, so one answer at the time:\nWhen your iPhone is connected to a Wi-Fi network, any app that needs data from the Internet will use the Wi-Fi network instead of the cellular data network. The data usage is therefore not counted against your monthly cellular data limit. However, when not connected to a Wi-Fi network, any time an app needs data, it uses the cellular data network and is counted towards your monthly limit.\nStopping apps from using Cellular Internet data:\nThat can be done in your iPhone settings. Select Cellular and it will open new window showing who and how much. There is a slider to turn that app off from Internet data.\nAt the bottom of the list, there is an item named System Services. Selecting it will show how much cellular data is being used for things like Messaging Services, Push Notifications, Documents & Sync, iTunes Accounts, Siri, Voicemail, Software Updates, Find My iPhone, Diagnostics and Apple ID Services.\nRemember those are cumulative data, so rest them once a month in date accordance to your plan.\nThere are few external apps for measuring and controlling internet data.\nFor Safari and FireFox, go to the individual settings and disable the FlashPlayer to prevent sites loading unwonted flash based advertisements. You will be asked to enable it if you do want to watch something.\n", "Q: When should I register (i.e. pay to be) an apple OS X developer? I'm a \"team of one\" and likely to remain so. I've been writing small programs for my own use for many years.\nFor the first time, I have an app which I think might really be useful to others. The prototype has a nice look, and some unique features (as far as I can tell) and I'm reworking the the program to clean up the code and make sure it follows the OS X Human Interface Guidelines.\nGiven that working alone part time it may take me a while to create the finished app, is there an advantage to going ahead and paying and going through the paper work now? (the $99 isn't a problem.)\nThis question occurred to me when I was thinking about putting out early beta copies to relatives, and I thought about sandboxing to protect them from any egregious mistakes I might make! I see that I need to register in order to sandbox.\nI have a bunch of other questions that may not be appropriate here, like\n\n\n*\n\n*Do I need a website? Where can I get one inexpensively?\n\n*What about a license that protects me? I'm open to permissive license, I'm not worried about trade secrets ... as far as I'm concerned it could be open source. Don't want to hire lawyers.\n\n\nWhere would it be appropriate to ask such questions?\nI've looked over the apple documentation on becoming a registered developer and generally understand the process.\n\nA: You don't need a website, but it's nice for your users to have a place where they can contact you and perhaps see some screenshots about the game/application you develop.\nI don't think you need any protection as they are all under Apple's terms and conditions. At our work we've got a developer account and nobody bat an eye.\nJust sign up and leak the name here, once your app is available (:\nOh yes, if your app costs money I'd like a coupon ;)\n", "Q: Cannot erase HD partition - Could not find partition to expand, first partition on the disk?

I have an old iphoto library (pre 7.0) on a time-machined backup external drive and wanted to access the photos on it. \nI tried to 'Switch' to it in IPhoto, and was asked to run the iPhoto library upgrader tool (http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1523) instead. \nI did that, and at some point the upgrader declared my library ready to be upgraded by the \"new\" version of iPhoto. I asked it to do so, and then iPhoto starts up, complaining again that the library needs to be upgraded using the iPhoto library upgrader. \nThis keeps happening. What's worse, the Option/Alt trick to switch to a new library at iPhoto doesn't work, so once I've told iPhoto once to switch to the new (non-working) library, I can no longer run iPhoto unless I dismount the external drive. \nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Sometimes my Macbook grinds to a halt due to the GPU's onboard memory getting full. (I know this because the CPU use, RAM use and disk use are all low, and because closing things like Chrome tabs and large pdfs tends to resolve the issue.) To avoid this, I'd like to be able to monitor the use of my system's graphics memory.\nThere doesn't seem to be an option in Activity Monitor, but is there some other way I can tell (a) how much graphics memory is currently free, and if possible (b) which apps are currently using the greatest amount of it?\nI'd much prefer a free solution over a paid one; a Terminal-based solution would be fine.\n\nA: I am not saying you are wrong, but the GPU memory is normally used for rendering the current laptop 2D display, and then for the calculations for 3D display (games), and GPU acceleration (modern browsers).  I've used, programmed various computers for many years, and yet to see an issue related to an application using to much GPU memory.  \nBut ISTRC MBP from 2010 onwards(?) have two GPU's the integrated (intel) and the discrete  (NVIDIA GeForce 320M in mine).  The MBP has good battery life due to when rendering text, images for the screen the low energy intel is used, but when game, videos are played and need more GPU processing is required the NVIDIA graphics chip is used.  Maybe you have an issue with the NVIDIA graphics?\nIt's maybe more likely that it could be a 'wait' caused by an issue with the filesystem, hard drive, or maybe elsewhere.  A failing hard drive will not report loads of activity when accessing a file that the hard drive controller takes extra long to read from. \nIt may help people to help you if you say how often it happens, whether the spinning beach ball appears, if it's a case of just taking a few moments to close windows, and then it wakes up again quickly or slowly? \nNext time it happens try closing one application set of windows, say Chrome, and then wait (5 minutes) to see if that fixes it, and then the next try the other.  As it's likely to be only one application that is the main issue, and you'll do best in trying to narrow it down. \nI've MacBook that getting a little slow occasionally but it's not gotten to the point where I need to correct it.\nGood Luck!\n\nA: I'm using iStat Menus, which shows a GPU Memory Usage figure.\nThe screenshot below is from my copy of iStat Menus 4.22.  There is a new version 5 release, which includes \"better per-app stats\".  I haven't tried this: I suspect it doesn't break down the GPU figures per-app, but it's worth a try -- there is a free trial.\n\n", "Q: Xcode cannot run using the selected device? I am developing my first ever iOS mobile app. I am using OS X Lion 10.7.5 with Xcode 4.6 for development. I completed my app and now want to test on a device. When I am trying to connect iPad Air with iOS 7.1 for testing, Xcode is giving an error:\n\nXcode cannot run using the selected device. No provisioned iOS devices are available with a compatible iOS version. Connect an iOS device with a recent enough version of iOS to run your application or choose an iOS simulator as the destination.\n\nI googled and came to decision that I need to use Xcode 5 if I want to test device with iOS 6.1 and above but I cannot install Xcode 5 as it requires OS X 10.8.4 and above. I decided to upgrade my OS from Lion to Mavericks.\nJust wanted to know if I do so will it create any problems in my already developed app? I don't have time to take a backup with Time Machine.\n\nA: This doesn't seem to be a problem with your version of Xcode/iOS/OS X, but rather that you have not provisioned your device. You need to add your provisioning profile to the device to allow you to test apps on it. Newer versions of Xcode will do this for you, but you can still do it with older versions yourself in the Member Center.\n\nA: I had the same problem on Xcode 6.3 after updating a phone to iOS 8.3. Downloading the provisioning files didn't fix the problem, but I stumbled onto a solution:\nConnect the phone to your mac and run iTunes. iTunes will ask if you want to trust the phone. Answer yes on the phone and then the Xcode error goes away. I tried it on a second phone, and it worked on it too.\n\nA: I had the same problem and, geez, I nearly freaked out, what I did was to recreate all provisioning profiles in Apple's Member Center (if it only brings you to the log-in page do so and re-klick on the link) and re-download them. Also make sure that you add your desired device when creating the PP. After downloading double-klick ALL PPs which should bring up the Keychain app, you can close it afterwards again.\nIf it does not show up then you should plug-in your device, go to Xcode -> Organizer (or Devices if you are on Xcode 5) and activate the iDevice for development. If it is still not working then in Organizer/Devices open your device's PP section, there it should show up, if not try to add it.\nOne more possibility: open the link again and add your device there manually.\nThen it should work again\n\nA: Try to restart the device.

For some reason the fans in my MacBook Pro (2007 model) seem to run at full speed for no apparent reason, I've been using the \"iStats\" gem to monitor my temps and fan speeds - what's strange is that the CPU temperature often sits around 40 - 45°C even when the fans are running around the 2000RPM mark - yet occasionally, for some odd reason it decides to boost them up to 5000RPM+. I'll just be happily browsing the web and all of a sudden it decides its time for takeoff...\n\nAnybody know a reason or possible fix for this? I've considered using some software to control the fan speed manually though I don't want to do anything that might potentially cause the system overheat.\nAny ideas are welcome!\n\nA: Trouble with fan speeds can almost always be solved by resetting the System Management Controller, or SMC.\n\nAfter performing normal troubleshooting, these symptoms may indicate that an SMC reset could be necessary.\nFans\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The computer's fans run at high speed although the computer is not experiencing heavy usage and is properly ventilated.\n  \n\nSource: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964\nThe procedure for laptops with removable batteries is as follows:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Shut down the computer.\n  \n*Disconnect the MagSafe power adapter from the computer, if it's connected.\n  \n*Remove the battery.\n  \n*Press and hold the power button for 5 seconds.\n  \n*Release the power button.\n  \n*Reconnect the battery and MagSafe power adapter.\n  \n*Press the power button to turn on the computer.\n  \n\nSource: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964\n", "Q: See all Apple Hidden Files I came from Windows 2 years ago and I knew there were hidden files in all OS's. As Windows has the simple option to show them to you, I supposed that if I contacted Apple support they would tell me how to show hidden files. But they simply told me they didn't exist at Mac OS. So I had to find the answer myself.\nBut today I was browsing some files with the terminal, I did ls -l -a to see all files (including those hidden) in a list and I saw kind of a different file that began with a dot and an underscore (._). I could see in the Finder all files except that one. \nSo my question is: Why can't I see that file (e.g. ._hello) in the Finder if I have already configured it to show me all files, including the hidden ones? Is that another kind of hidden file which I'm not aware of? \n\nA: There are 2 kinds of hidden files on OS X.\nFiles starting with . are normally hidden in Unix (including OS X) or Linux systems, but can easily be shown e.g. by ls -la.\nIn addition certain files (or directories) are hidden by OS X apps ( ~/Library is one example) and generally files inside bundles (such as .apps) are not normally visible.\nIt is easy to show hidden files in Finder (by changing settings defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE). This then applies to all files.\nFinder addons such as TotalFinder make changing this easier and Finder alternatives such as QuollEyeTree http://binnie.id.au/QuollEyeTree.html let you toggle this for individual directories and show both kinds of hidden files.\n", "Q: How to fix an iPad that froze on home screen? I have an iPad Air running iOS 7.1.2 and is not jailbroken, I opened an application yesterday and when I was finished with it I closed it by using the four finger gesture where you place your fingers around the edges of the screen and you then slide them all towards the middle of the screen.\nThis gesture is supposed to close my current opened application and then display the home screen with all my installed applications on the iPad. But what this gesture did was close the application and display my home screen picture and the iPad froze where I could not see or access any application on my iPad. I only had the display of my home screen with no application visible.\nIf I lock my iPad and then unlock it, the same home screen display would appear without showing me the lock screen, and I won't be able to access or see any application on my iPad. It's like I had a framed picture in my hand not an iPad. I could've even shutdown my iPad with only pressing the sleep/wake button, my iPad kept displaying the home screen display after pressing and holding the sleep/wake button for a several seconds.\nThe only way I could get my iPad functioning again is through the hard restart (press and hold the home button and the sleep/wake button for several seconds until the screen goes black and you see the apple logo) which I don't think is the best solution for this problem, becuase the problem could surely happen again. Any suggestions how to fix this?\n\nA: Yes, this is a known bug.

I don't want to have the dock bar auto-hiding/showing, so I have it always enabled.\nWhen I maximize a window, two things happen: \n\n\n*\n\n*either it goes fullscreen so it hides the dock\n\n*or I make it bigger (with any tool like snaptool etc) but it goes behind the dock , so I can't access some parts of windows (like in Chrome pages)\n\n\nis it possible (is there any app) that makes the dock behave more like a windows taskbar?\n\nA: If you try to make a window bigger than the size left by the Dock, by dragging the bottom of a window yourself, you will notice that you can't do it. This is because the Dock already behaves like a Windows Taskbar: you can move windows behind it but not resize windows beyond it.\nThe problem lies with the tool that you are using to resize the window-it is extending the window more than it should do. Try using a different tool to do the resizing or resize the windows yourself.\n", "Q: Run script as root whenever any user logs in What's the best way to run a script with root privileges whenever any user logs in?

How can I access the connected iPhone or iPad from within Terminal on OS X? I want to get all the photos (only photos) from the connected iDevice and save it to any directory in my OS X filesystem. I don't want to use the iTunes and instead just want to do it all within Terminal.\nI want to get the file path like /Volumes/my_iphone_name, but for some reasons I didn't find anything such in /Volumes subdirectory. Also, diskutil list didn't get me anything that seems related to the connected device.\nSo where is there my iPhone detected on the entire filesystem?\n\nA: This is probably not the answer you're looking for, but apparently this can't be done. Please see this question: iOS mount point in macOS\n\nA: There may not be a way to transfer the photos directly to your OS X filesystem from the iPhone/iPad using Terminal. However, if you have access to a Windows computer (at home, at your local library, etc.), you can plug the device into the Windows computer and access the photos in the device's DCIM folder via File Explorer. You can then transfer the desired photos (and videos, for that matter) to a flash drive. After that, all you have to do is connect the flash drive to your OS X device. Then you will be able to transfer the photos to wherever you would like on your OS X filesystem.\n", "Q: Why do I need to \"bypass\" 169.254/16? In my MacBook's networking proxy settings I have \"169.254/16\" among the list of domains for which to bypass proxy settings:\n\nWhat purpose does this serve and why do I need it? Can I get rid of it?\n\nA: It's on the exclude list because a 169.254/16 address is by definition not external to your network. A proxy server relays your requests to other networks. Proxy servers are much less common today than they used to be, but if you are using one, and you didn't have that exclusion, you could get some very strange results.\nIf you have the proxy enabled without exclusions, you run the risk of the proxy intercepting a request intended for a device on your network, and trying to relay it to the outside world. The possibility exists that the traffic would never reach its intended target on the local network. So the exclusion is telling the OS not to send traffic that should stay local to a proxy meant for external traffic.\nI don't know of any reason why it would compromise your own computer's security either way. You can get rid of it, but I don't any advantage of doing so.\n\nA: That address range is reserved for \"Self Assigned\" addresses.\nSo for example if your network settings on your device are configured to 'DHCP' but for whatever reason you are not able to get a DHCP address your device will assign itself an IP address in the \"169.254/16\" range.\nIt is probably in the exclude list because there would never be a valid result from the VPN.  And if there were for some strange reason a valid result from the VPN that would likely be bad data.  Best not to delete.\n\nA: I updated my Mac laptop pc to the latest operating system version - MacOS Mojave, and removed *Local, 169.254/16, and the problem solved.\n", "Q: kIOUSBEndpointCountExceeded error when plugging in USB device I keep a lot of USB devices plugged into my 15-inch Mid 2012 MacBook Pro for my job.\nThis MacBook Pro has 2 external USB ports.

Sadly, that file is rather aged, as Apple no longer releases that source. The source is for 10.8.4 and I'm on 10.9.4.\nThe error is defined in USB.h as #define kIOUSBEndpointCountExceeded // 0xe0004046  The endpoint was not created because the controller cannot support more endpoints but sadly that's just as little detail.\nThe name of the error suggests that it's an exceeded device limit (dur), so I unplugged a lot of devices and after plugging in just one it was detected and working fine.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Where is the limitation?\n\n*Is this documented?\n\n*Is there a workaround?\n\n\nA: Patching the kernel to work around the issue\nI do not recommend you do this. You're editing the binary of a very important file. If it gets messed up, well, ya. But this is the only solution.\nThis is likely 10.9.4 specific.\nLocation 0x00016942 of /System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBXHCI.kext/Contents/MacOS/AppleUSBXHCI should contain 66 B9 60 00. That translates to mov cx, 60h\nI edited it to 66 B9 *80* 00 and all of my devices come online now. I assume going even higher, or removing the \"errata\" check altogether, is also safe. If you run into trouble you can just unplug devices and reboot.\n\nResearch\nIt appears to be breaking inside of the function AppleUSBXHCI::TestConfiguredEpCount in AppleUSBXHCIUIM.cpp.\nWhich is using a max value, which is set from:\n// default max number of endpoints we allow to be configured\n_maxControllerEndpoints = kMaxXHCIControllerEndpoints;\n\n// this will switch the mux for panther point\nEnableXHCIPorts();\n\nif( (_errataBits & kXHCIErrataPPT) != 0)\n{   \n    // Panther Point - limit endpoints to 64 <rdar://problem/10385765>\n    // does this need a separate errata bit?\n    _maxControllerEndpoints = 64;\n}\n\nThe flags are being set by this code\nstatic ErrataListEntry  errataList[] = {\n\n    {0x1033, 0x0194, 0, 0xffff, kXHCIErrata_NEC},   // NEC XHCI, check firmware\n    {0x1b73, 0x1000, 0, 0xffff, kXHCIErrata_NoMSI}, // Fresco Logic XHCI\n    {0x8086, 0x1e31, 0, 0xffff, kXHCIErrataPPT | kXHCIErrataPPTMux | kXHCIErrata_EnableAutoCompliance | kErrataSWAssistXHCIIdle | kXHCIErrata_ParkRing},    // Intel Panther Point\n    {0x1b21, 0, 0, 0xffff,  kXHCIErrata_ASMedia},   // ASMedia XHCI\n    {0x1b73, 0, 0, 0xffff, kXHCIErrata_FrescoLogic},// Fresco Logic\n    {0x1b73, 0x1100, 0, 16, kXHCIErrata_FL1100_Ax}, // Fresco Logic FL1100-Ax\n    {0x1b6f, 0x7052, 1, 0xffff, kXHCIErrata_Etron7052}\n};\n\n0x1e31 is the Device ID of my MacBook Pro's built in USB controller!\nThe logging shows my max limit is set to 96 (it hits 97 and sets the err value causing it to revert). This source is old as Apple has closed the source to IOUSBFamily a while ago, so there's no real way to tell where the 96 is coming from, but the conclusion appears to be my hub is black listed by the OSX kernel for reasons unknown.\nApple increased the limit by 50% in 10.8, where it was 64, to 96 in 10.9. This shows that the number is arbitrary. The hardware did not change but there was a 50% increase allowed in the software, that's a significant change. But why not 128? Why not 95, or 96? The units of power of two are likely also meaningless here.\n\nWhy 96 end points is a very low limit\nEach one of my USB hubs has 3 USB controllers inside of it. Each one supports \"Full/Low Speed\" and \"SuperSpeed.\" Each one of those has an endpoint for input, and one for output. 3 hubs * 3 controllers each * 2 protocols each controller * 2 for IO = 36 end points... just on hubs!\nThe bluetooth built into the laptop uses 8, the HD FaceTime Camera uses 6, a Nexus 4 uses 6.\n96 is a very low amount of end points.\n", "Q: Safari - Display Favicons In Favorites Bar Is it possible to display favicons in Safari's Favorites Bar? For example, my Favorites Bar in Firefox looks like this:\n\nI've tried using glims, but can't get it to do this.\n\nA: I was looking for something similar as I use the Chrome bookmark bar in that way, but I couldn't find anything suitable. So I made an extension and have submitted it to Apple, Favicon Bar: \nhttps://github.com/RoryCombe/FaviconBar\n\n\nA: I don't believe that it can be done as of in Safari 8.\nIn Chrome, you can simply remove the name associated with the site bookmark and it will only show the favicon in the Bookmarks Bar.  Unfortunately, doing this in Safari results in a bar of \"NO_TITLE\" instead.\n\nA: There now is a solution to this: I have created Faviconographer, an app that will overlay Favicons for Safari tabs and favorites bar entries. It's still a workaround compared to a native Safari feature, but it works surprisingly well.\n\nA: A partial solution is to use Emoji & Symbols from the Edit menu. MacOS lets you add these pretty much anywhere. Some \"symbols\" are even English letters in different fonts. As an example, here are two bookmarks in my Favorites Bar, where Overleaf is a regular bookmark and \"Email This\" uses emojis and symbols.\n\n\nA: As of Safari 8, favicons no longer show up on the tab bar, to my disappointment.\nOne solution is to use SafariStand & EasySIMBL. Once installed (see instructions on the SafariStand site), open the SafariStand settings and check \"Show Icon on Tab Bar\". This will return favicons to the tabs.\n\nA: Seemed impossible to me when using Safari. No better for an Apple store assistant. But it's a cinch with Chrome, Firefox and MS Edge.\nChrome - right-click > Edit ... Delete the name.\nFirefox - right-click > Properties > Delete the name.\nEdge - right-click > Show Icon Only\nIt's such a simple idea - I'm sad I didn't think of it earlier !\n", "Q: Lacie petitekey write protected I have a Lacie petitekey, and when I use it with my mac configuration (10.9.4) it says that the key is in read only.\nI cannot format it as well, so I cannot really use it anymore regarding that it is impossible to put any data on it.\nHow can I be able to use it in write/read mode?\n\nA: Apparently it was a failure of the key, I asked Lacie and they sent me another one.\nSo if you come across the same issue contact Lacie.\n", "Q: Does hard disk continue to run while sleeping? The question is pretty simple. I just wanted to know for sure but couldn't find an answer on google. \nDoes the hard drive continue to \"run\" while the computer is asleep?\nI'd like to know if it does and if that's the case why does it need to?\n\nA: It will almost never run while the computer is sleeping. Sometimes when you put the computer to sleep, the disk will run for a short time while doing \"housekeeping\". There are also options in the Settings for waking from sleep (thus starting the hard drive) for network access.\nClosing the lid of a macbook will try to get it to sleep, but it may not always go there. If it does successfully sleep, then your drive should be inactive.\n\nA: Yes.\n\nApple-supplied hard disks spin down; third-party hard disks may spin\n  down\n\nbut it doesn't stop.

I was listing my launchd items the other day to track down a constantly-crashing gpg-agent, and I was perturbed to notice TeamViewer in there. So, I removed it, momentarily not thinking much about it; I downloaded their uninstaller and I uninstalled. I made the mistake of not taking notes of exactly what I saw. So, now I'm wondering if my system was, in fact, compromised. Is there any legitimate reason for TeamViewer to be on a Maverics system when, seemingly, 'uninvited'?\n\nA: That is not possible since the TeamViewer requires activation. \nTypically they would send you a email that you signed with containing the link to activate it.\nSo you might had the software from somewhere but it was not active.\n", "Q: Will the Genius Bar help me transfer my files between macs? I have a new macbook pro and would like to transfer the files from my old macbook pro. I need a firewire->thunderbolt cable to do this. I don't really want to pay $30 to buy a cable that I'm going to use once. Will the genius bar do this for me?\n\nA: As a former Genius, I can say that we were always willing to lend cables to customers for in-store use, but we would not overtly assist with data exercises. Then primary reason is the legality: if Apple gets involved with your data, they become liable for your intellectual property...which can be a legal mess. It's the same reason Apple doesn't offer a guaranteed backup/restore service during a repair. \nSo, my advice would be book a Genius Bar appointment, explain your situation to a technician, and go from there. The worst they can say is no. \nP.S. Unless Apple Retail Store policy has changed, you have a 14-day return policy. I had customers buy a cable, use it for a few days, then return it due to \"buyers remorse.\" ;)\n\nA: There are many ways how to achieve this - see Apples documentation for file transferring: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11466\nIf both MacBooks are at least on OS X Lion (OS X 10.7), I recommend the AirDrop solution.\nIf you any MacBook is on an older version than OS X 10.7, you may want to copy them over your LAN via ethernet or WIFI connection.\nHowever, if you'll be transferring a lot of data, you may want to use an external drive for exchange.\n", "Q: iTerm2: Saving Global Shortcut Keys In iTerm2, I can define \"Global Shortcut Keys\", which is great. I can also \"Load Presets\" within this view. But how can I save \"Global Shortcut Keys\"? \nI don't see an option to do this anywhere:\n.\n\nA: You can save different settings by going to the Profile Tab and creating a new Profile. It will have a tab at the right for setting key settings, and you can select/deselect that profile to enable your customized tabs.\n\nIf you want/need to edit the mappings en-masse, there is a file called PresetKeyMappings.plist inside the Resources folder in the app. (Right click on app, choose \"Show Package Contents\".)\nWithin the Profiles tab, there is also a pop-up menu at the bottom for bulk copying presets from a given profile.

(Directly, not as an image.)\nWhen I try to follow this tutorial: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14185 , as soon as I press Command R, I get thrown into an Internet Recovery, which takes about an hour to complete. I might be wrong, but, according to some research I've done, this should be the behavior when I don't have a dedicated recovery partition? If so - I don't see the point in creating the full system backup if I cannot readily make use of it. \nAfter said hour passes, I am presented with the options that should have readily been available to begin with, and I am able to do a system restore from the Time Machine.\nSaid restore, though, ends after a while in (what should have been?) a boot screen: I get the spinning wheel but the Apple logo is switched for a \"crossed O\" as in, the \"Access denined\" symbol. \nHow could I prevent the Internet Recovery to take place, go directly to perform a Time Machine recovery? Any suggestions about the second issue, might they be connected somehow?\n\nA: Your problem is almost certainly related to partitioning on a Windows machine.\nYou can verify this by using Disk Utility to look at the Drive, in particular the Partition Map Scheme. This needs to be GUID Partition Table but is probably MBR.\nYou would need to repartition on OS X, but this will need you to erase all data.\n", "Q: Graphs of mail messages over time I'd like to be able to track information relating to how I use email. I'm basically after a better way to visualise when my inbox is going out of control, and I'd historically like to know how much email I deal with.\nAt the moment I have a spreadsheet with daily tallies of ‘messages in inbox’, ‘total for today’, ‘trashed today’, etc., that I often forget to update since it's a manual process.\nI've attempted to AppleScript mail in the past but generally have found it's flaky trying to deal with smart mailboxes. (Haven't tried using accessibility scripting, though.) E.g., something like this (assuming I have a smart mailbox called \"Unread\"), doesn't work:\ntell application \"Mail\" to get every mailbox whose name is \"Unread\"\n\nIs anyone aware of software, or know a workable technique, for tracking mail behaviour over time? The more automated the better of course. TL;DR version: How can I get the number of messages in a smart mailbox?\n\nA: I am looking for this also. This answer claims: \"AppleScript doesn't offer any means of getting a list of replies to a message. My workaround is to get the message id of the message being replied to and search it in the sent messages.\"\nTimeToReply.com also provides a similar service, but they have locked out new users pending product updates (unfortunately, they are moving from a cloud service to client plugin model).\n", "Q: Applescript Invoke Specific User and Password I have a do shell script that I need to run in Applescript, but it needs to run as a different user. It is to be deployed into the student's network drive as a standalone application that the students can run when required.\nThe example code below is only for illustration.\nThis code works when I am logged in, because it's picking up my username (local admin account) on the computer and uses the password provided (not the actual password included).\ndo shell script \"rm -rf /$HOME/Downloads/*\" password \"Password01\" with administrator privileges\n\nI have tried to specify a username with user \"sdadmin\" to the code and it won't work, it throws an error.\nIs there a way to ask AppleScript to run a command with a specific user and password provided in the code like above?\n\nA: Updated answer:\nThere is an Apple doc which shows the correct way of doing it. You was close.\n(I have not tried it myself)\ndo shell script \"rm -rf /$HOME/Downloads/*\"  user name \"USERNAME\" password \"THEPASSWORD\" with administrator privileges\nFrom the doc:\n\nHow do I get administrator privileges for a command?\nUse the administrator privileges, user name and password parameters\n  like this:\ndo shell script \"command\" user name \"me\" password \"mypassword\" with\n  administrator privileges user name and password are optional; if you\n  omit the user name, do shell script assumes it to be the current user;\n  if you omit the password, it will ask for a password when it runs.\n  Once a script is correctly authenticated, it will not ask for\n  authentication again for five minutes. As of Mac OS X 10.4, this grace\n  period does not extend to any other scripts or to the rest of the\n  system; manually calling sudo -k is unnecessary.\nFor security reasons, you may not tell another application to do shell\n  script with administrator privileges. Put the command outside of any\n  tell block, or put it inside a tell me block.\nBear in mind that administrator privileges allow you to change any\n  file anywhere in the system. You can render your system unbootable or\n  even erase the entire disk with a few well-placed commands, so\n  exercise caution. Better yet, don’t use administrator privileges\n  unless you absolutely have to. Unless you are doing system-level\n  development, you should never need to change anything in /System —\n  changing /Library should suffice.\nNote: Using sudo(8) with with administrator privileges is generally\n  unnecessary and creates security holes; simply remove the \"sudo\".\n\n\nIMPORTANT UPDATE 2\n*You can save the app as \"run only\" (Save an editable copy for yourself first)\n( If you only save it as a Run Only even you will not be able to open it and edit it later on once you have closed the script window.)\nThen use the File->Export menu which will give you the option in the save dialogue to save as \"Run Only\"\n \nAttempt to open main.scpt file in application package:\n\nA Run only will stop someone from opening the script embedded in the Application by double clicking on it to open it in Script Editor and discover your password.

Don't worry. The best you can do is ask here or even elsewhere -because the problem is about the configuration, not Mac-. Download the iso / img from the official repository. Then create a new virtual machine. Configure the settings as you wish (RAM, disk size) and then when disk image requested, select the downloaded one. If it also asks you what OS are you trying to run, try (because Chrome OS may not be displayed) to select it.\nThis process is universal. The thing is that since the iso contains the boot and kernel, the virtual machine should at least know which files correspond to each function. It may be impossible to boot it if VMW doesnt recognize them. In that case, if you still wanna run VMW -which would be hardcore- I can just tell you to surf the net. \nThe easiest EVER is in that case using parallels. Download a cracked copy or buy it if you are a legal guy 😉. \nHope it helps\nEdit: And the link you provided is vanilla, not chrome OS. So thats kind of help to install it, which is fine, but in that case you should also take a look at the docs. Did you download the file for vmw? It should work\n", "Q: Sync keyboard shortcuts for ipad with iCloud I have some useful text expander shortcuts on my MacBook Pro and I would like to get them synced with the shortcuts on my ipad.

In Safari, I have a lot of pages saved in the reading list.\nHow can I backup the reading list to a computer and then access it ?\nOn a PC, I have a backup of my iPhone. I have explored the backup with iBackup Viewer, free version, on Windows. I have managed to access the open tabs of Safari. But I don't find the reading list.\n\nA: Assuming you have your backup under $backup_dir, the reading list is stored in the sqlite database file $backup_dir/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.db, under the table bookmarks.\nThis table also contains favourites, which can be distinguished from reading list bookmarks by the fact they have no value for the column extra_attributes. Therefore, we can use the following query:\nselect url,title\nfrom bookmarks\nwhere url not like '' and extra_attributes not like '';\n\nTo import these in browsers, we can transform the entries into Netscape Bookmark File Format. You can use, for example, the following AWK script:\n#!/usr/bin/awk -f\n\nBEGIN { print \\\n    \"<!DOCTYPE NETSCAPE-Bookmark-file-1>\\n\" \\\n    \"<!--This is an automatically generated file.\\n\" \\\n    \"It will be read and overwritten.\\n\" \\\n    \"Do Not Edit! -->\\n\" \\\n    \"<META HTTP-EQUIV=\\\"Content-Type\\\" CONTENT=\\\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\\\">\\n\" \\\n    \"<TITLE>Bookmarks</TITLE>\\n\" \\\n    \"<H1>Bookmarks</H1>\\n\" \\\n    \"<DL><p>\"\n}\n/^[[:space:]]*$/ { next }\n{\n    split($0, parts, \"|\")\n    url = parts[1]\n    title = separator = \"\"\n    for (i=2; i in parts; i++) {\n        title = title separator parts[i]\n        separator = \"|\"\n    }\n    print \"<DT><A HREF=\\\"\" url \"\\\">\" title \"</A>\"\n}\nEND { print \"</DL><p>\" }\n\nIn sum, you can do all this with the following bash \"one-liner\":\necho \"\nselect url,title\nfrom bookmarks\nwhere url not like '' and extra_attributes not like '';\n\" | \\\nsqlite \"$backup_dir\"/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.db | \\\n./\"$awk_script\" > bookmarks.html\n\n", "Q: How to access the internal hard disk with full permissions?

What software could I use?\n\nA: You can use builtin Time Machine application.\nFirst - make a backup on Your external drive using TimeMachine.\nThen on the new Mac use Migration Assistant.\nHere is the link with detailed info: http://www.macworld.com/article/2066996/how-to-transfer-backups-from-time-machine-to-a-new-mac.html \n\nOn the new iMac make sure that you have access to the drive where the Time Machine backup is stored and then launch Migration Assistant. It will notify you that it needs to quit all open applications. Allow it to do so.\n  The first Migration Assistant screen will offer three options regarding data transfer. Select the first one, which reads From a Mac, Time Machine backup, or startup disk and click Continue.\n  In the next screen choose the drive that holds your backup and then click Continue.\n\n\nA: The easiest (and fastest) method is to make an image of your harddrive. I recommend Carbon Copy Cloner, though SuperDuper is another fine choice. Best bet is to follow instructions to make a bootable copy of the drive.\nOnce you have made the copy, you simply plug the harddrive into the new laptop, and copy the data or use Migration Assistant. USB 3.0 used by the harddrive is much faster than Ethernet for copying from one computer to the other (assuming you do not have an expensive Thunderbolt cable).\nIn fact, this is a good best practice for owning a Mac: keep a fresh, bootable copy of your harddrive for emergency purposes. If your harddrive fails, you simply plug in your image external harddrive, and then reboot the Mac, selecting the external drive to boot from. Instantly, you are back in business.

Is there any way I can fix this?\n\nA: afc2add's successor, Apple File Conduit, provides the same (and more) functionality as it's predecessor, and supports iOS 7.1.x.\n", "Q: OS X works perfectly fine on external HD but extremely slow with HD on MBP Things get weird when I replaced my HDD with an SSD since my MacBook Pro  (Mid-2012) slowed down horribly. I get beachballs everything I did on my MBP and it was so painful.\nI thought it was because of malfunctioning HD, so replacing it with an SSD gonna both speed up my system and help me to get rid of old HDD. I installed OS X to my SSD with and external box, run my computer over that and boom! MBP speed-ed up and it seems to worked out. So, I open my MBP, replaced old HDD with my SSD, I rebooted my MBP and it was worse than before. How could this be possible?!\nSo I decided to do something else. I put my old HDD to USB converter box, connect it to my MBP, run OS over that. MBP works like charm.\nI was wrong, there is nothing wrong with my HDD. Does anyone have any idea regarding to this?\nAny input is appreciated. \n\nA: If both the HDD and the SSD are running significantly faster when installed in the external enclosure rather than the internal bay, your SATA cable is likely the culprit. Both should run faster when connected via the internal SATA bus vs external USB 3.0 bus. You can run the Apple Hardware Test (which doesn't test your drive, but does test the connection), but it's prone to false negatives. \nIf you are close to an Apple Store, my advice would be to take it in for a free diagnostic (AppleCare won't cover the cost of replacing the cable since you already swapped out the drive, however). At any rate, you can get a definitive diagnosis and then decide whether to go through Apple, use a third-party service, or a DIY solution as posted in the link above.

Thanks to @Vev for giving me the hint to discover how to do it.\n\n\n*\n\n*First: expand the size of the cell so there is some white space\naround the hyperlink. \n\n*Click once in the white space to select the\nCell. \n\n*Click once again in the white space, to enable the Text Cursor.\n\n*Right-Click on the hyperlink, which selects it and provides a context\nmenu. (If you don't have right-click enabled, use Ctrl-click on the\nMac) \n\n*Select \"Edit Link\" in the context menu. \n\n*Click the \"Remove\" button from the Edit Link dialog.\n\nA: If you can edit each item to touch them, \n\n\n*\n\n*go to Edit -> Substitutions and uncheck SmartLinks.  \n\n\nAll new entries will not change and by touching the old cells, your problem is solved.

Then use Format/Remove link.\n\nA: In older versions of Numbers, it is necessary to cut and repaste the hyperlinked line (with the AutoCorrect option mentioned already turned off.) Select the line, cut it, then paste it. It will then be pasted without hyperlinking.\nThis will be necessary even to edit the line. This is because clicking on the line to edit it will only perform the hyperlink action. This is a seriously amazing failure on someones part at Apple. The fact that this went unaddressed for years, unfortunately, is par-for-the-course for Apple.\n\nA: I have a spreadsheet where all the cells in one column contain the hyperlinks.  I select and copy that column and pasted it in a new Excel spreadsheet.  Went to Edit / Clear / Hyperlinks.   Then pasted it back into my Numbers document.  That may be cheating, but that works.  \n\nA: The solution is for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select cells or column you want to correct and apply Cut command (Command ⌘ + X)\n\n*With these cells still selected, go to Text Tab and Select predefined style for cells. This is important because if you don’t do that, each cell memorizes text style and treat it like hyperlink style cell. \n\n*Paste with same style (Option ⌥ + Shift ⇧ + Command ⌘ + v)\n\n\nA: If you have a long list of entries (some of my spreadsheets have 300+ entries and the emails are always hyperlinked!!) here's what I do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the column of emails into a text editing program such as bbedit.\n\n*replace instances of '@\" with at - or really any unique string\n\n*I also do the same thing with the dot - replace '.' with DOT\n\n*Then I paste the result back into the column (making sure they're in the correct rows.\n\n*If I want to use the list to send out a mass email, I just do the same thing in revers: Copy the column into bbedit and replace at with '@'.\nA pain but easier than doing each formatting by hand. \nIt's really stupid of Apple and it should be changed. \n\nA: In Numbers '09 (version 2.3) there is much easier way. Select all of the cells that you which to remove hyperlinks from, im my case Command+A to select everything. Then open your Inspector. In the second tab from the far right called \"hyperlink\", at the bottom there is a checkbox called \"Make all hyperlinks inactive\". That's it!\nI hope this is helpful as I'm so glad I found this!\n\nA: Cut column content with Command X, then paste without formatting by using CommandShiftV . \nThese are not dedicated Numbers but general Mac shortcuts.\n", "Q: Is it a way to offer subscription as In-App purchase but for service and not for content?

Is there any way to play a entire folder with only the right button?\nThanks in advance, best regards.\n\nA: It doesn't appear possible to do something like VLC folder/ folder2/ from the command line. Instead I've successfully created an Automator service that generates a playlist and launches the application passing the list to it.\nHere is the service...\n\nTo include subfolders enable the option Repeat for each subfolder found in the first action shown above.\nTo save you the typing, the shell script code is as follows,\n# Create playlist\nPLSFILE=/tmp/VLC_`date +%s`_$$.m3u\ncat > $PLSFILE\n\n# If file empty just exit\n[ -s $PLSFILE ] || exit 0\n\n# Remove following if you want to add to list instead of replacing it\nkillall VLC && sleep 1\n\n\n# Launch VLC with our new playlist\nopen -a /Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC $PLSFILE --args --playlist-autostart\n\nThe shell script will do nothing if Finder doesn't find any media files.

I have two accounts set up in the app.  Recently (within the past month, maybe two) when I open the app, I am met with the Welcome/set-up screen that lists the different account types that you can set up (iCloud, Exchange, Google, etc.) even though I already have my accounts set up and they were working that morning.  If I double-tap the home button and swipe up to close the app, and tap the app again to re-open it, it loads both accounts like normal.\nThis wouldn't really be too big of an issue because it has a quick fix, however because it doesn't recognize that a mail account is set up, it also does not alert me when I receive a new email.  So I have to manually check my emails every hour to make sure I don't miss anything.\nWhile the mail app is being weird and showing me the welcome screen, I can open up the mail settings and still see both accounts that I have, and notification settings are all as they should be.\nEither I don't know how to phrase the questions properly to get hits on Google, or no one else has ever had this issue.

I'd like behavior like vim has when in set nowrap mode - not even a flicker of a wrap.\nThis question is similar to Disable line wrapping for output in the Terminal, but that's asking about scrolling.\n\nA: I believe this is not possible without using fullscreen mode - vim is using fullscreen mode (python -c 'print \"\\x1b[?1049h\"') which disables vertical scrolling as well, which isn't what I want (though this wasn't clear in the question).\nAlso, it turns out this behavior isn't specific to terminal.app - it's how all the terminals I've tried work.\n", "Q: Macbook Air Aluminum Wearout As you can see in the pictures bellow, this is the palm rest wear I have on my Macbook Air after 1 year of (heavy) usage. I use my laptop professionally, almost on a daily basis for many hours a day. This is the result after cleaning the whole case with a cleaner I purchased from the Apple Store. As you can see it does not really help remove these stains, it does work wonderfully for all other stains... but I'm afraid this wear is actually removing part of the aluminum cases surface, if I'm right, I guess there's not much hope in restoring the finish. I would like to know if anyone else has experienced this and what you have done about it if you have been able to fix it. Thanks!\n\n\n\n\nA: Not that it will help, but that looks like a 2-coat process, as it's wearing away, the 'outline' is the border between the top coat & the substrate; the patch in the middle is where that base coat has also worn away.  \nIn short, I'd say not fixable, other than by completely stripping & re-coating... or not viable, rather than not fixable.\nmoved from comments\nAnodization changes the microscopic texture of the surface and changes the crystal structure of the metal near the surface. Thick coatings are normally porous, so a sealing process is often needed to achieve corrosion resistance. Anodized aluminium surfaces, for example, are harder than aluminium but have low to moderate wear resistance that can be improved with increasing thickness or by applying suitable sealing substances.\n\nA: I believe those are imprints of your palm rests.\nSince the sweat on your hand is a bit acid, it accelerate the aluminum oxidation. \nSo the more you'll use your mac, it'll get whiter and whiter on the sides of the touchpad (where you put you palms to type on the keyboard)...you may exchage it for a new one, it wont make a difference, you'll get white spots anyway over time. \nNo cleaning possible, and to prevent further escalation, recommend to use pads, or foil on those areas.\n", "Q: how to make Terminal (unix) use Microsoft Outlook instead of Apple Mail We use Microsoft Outlook at work so I need to be able to use Microsoft Outlook instead of Apple's Mail program when I invoke it in Bash.

Plugins are mostly available for Windows software only. Searching Macupdate returned nil as well. \nHow can I generate an APNG from a series of still PNGs (not from a video file) on OS X? (Although I understand the file structure, I’m hesitant to do it manually.)\n\nA: APNGb is a free APNG assembler with a Mac GUI. I just tested it on macOS Monterey and it worked well. Development is active (the last update was less than a week ago at the time of this writing). You simply drag-drop your still PNG frames, set the animation speed, and save. Quick and simple!\nThere are three compression types to choose from. I tested it with the default 7zip. The resulting .png file displayed fine in all three browsers I tested on (Firefox, Safari, Chrome). I can't speak to the differences between the compression types, but they should all work. caniuse does not mention any compatibility issues with one APNG compression type versus another.\nA few usability quirks to be aware of (as of v2.0.1):\n\n*\n\n*Frame rate is specified in 10ths of a second per frame, which is a bit unconventional. So if you want your animation to hold each frame for 2 seconds, you would input 20 / 10. For 100 milliseconds it would be 1 / 10. For 24 FPS: (1 sec / 24 frames) * 10 = 0.416666666666667, therefor 0.416666666666667 / 10\n\n*Instead of File > Save As or File > Export, you must select all of your frames, then click the mysterious black square in the upper-left part of the window to save your animated .png file so that it becomes a black triangle, and then click that triangle. Apparently this is a square = stop, triangle = play sort of logic.\n\n*The application window cannot be dragged if you click the wrong part of it at the top, because some areas are reserved for text messages. (Around where it usually says \"Idle...\" Solution: Click elsewhere until you find a draggable area.)\n\n*You can't specify the file name of your resulting APNG. You can only specify the folder to save it to. It will be named apngb-animated.png. Rename this file as soon as you create it, because any existing file of that name will be overwritten without prompting the next time you save an APNG.\n\nThere is also a modal for de-compiling an existing APNG into individual .png frames. It can be accessed by clicking the icon resembling a stack of paper on the left sidebar.\nAll in all, the app is easy to use. The present usability issues are not show-stoppers by any means. The files the app puts out seem to animate without any problems. And I'm optimistic that the app will only get better, as development is ongoing.\n\nA: I have only used APNG Assembler for Windows. It appears that the GUI version is only for Windows, but command line versions exist for both Linux and Mac OS X. Using the CLI version (or writing a UI wrapper for it, if you have any development experience) may be a possibility. \nAlternatively, you can use an online service such as this online APNG Assembler. I cannot vouch for the effectiveness of this solution, however.\n", "Q: Syncing Safari bookmarks across multiple Apple devices (iMac, Macbook pro and iPad) I was a Microsoft Windows (98 to 8.1) user up until now , and I have recently made the switch to Mac OSX completely. While I have managed to familiarize myself with quite a few things so far, there is a complicated issue which I haven't been able to deal with, yet.\nUp until the switch to Mac OSX, I have been using Google Chrome for all my online work. I frequently tend to bookmark web-sites and over the long period, I have accumulated many bookmarks which are neatly organized into folders on the Google Chrome bookmark bar. I feel a screenshot would make it absolutely clear in case of any confusion, so here's one:\n\nThe interesting point to note here is: the iMac is not my own, it is my work computer, and yet by logging into Google Chrome on this iMac (refer next screenshot), I can access all my bookmarks, saved passwords (and what not) in a matter of seconds.\n\nSo, my question is:\n\nHow do I get to perform the same sync in Safari, as is possible\n  through Google and Google Chrome?\n\nI do have an Apple iCloud account, but I don't see how I can replicate the syncing on Safari via iCloud, the way it can be done through my Google account and Google Chrome. I also have a personal Macbook Pro and an iPad, and I need to sync the iMac safari bookmarks with those on the Pro and the iPad. \nThe only thing which I can think of is: Exporting Google Chrome bookmarks into an HTML file and importing them back into Safari, each time both on the iMac and the Macbook. \nNot only is this tedious, but it's also extremely clumsy. If there is a way iCloud can be used to do the sync on Safari, I'm not yet aware of it. External sync apps (Evernote and the like) might not work because they have limited storage. \nI would also like for Keychain to be enabled across all my Apple devices via the sync, so I do not need to remember passwords.\nAny suggestions/help would be highly appreciated.\n\nA: iCloud syncs Safari bookmarks as well as Keychain passwords across your Macs and iOS device today. Simply sign into iCloud on your Macs, and configure both \"Safari\" and \"Keychain\" in iCloud settings in System Settings.  If you are having trouble getting this to work, check here: http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4001\nIn my experience, iCloud is not as quick, nor as persistent as is Google Sync. It can often take many minutes to get updates, and sometimes it seems to fail outright. This has been improving for sometime now, but IMHO, its not as good as Google.\nAlternatives include Xmarks and LastPass.  XMarks syncs bookmarks across everything, whether you use Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Mac or Windows. Highly recommended. The Safari support is a little odd, due to Safari not having a similar plugin capability. Lastpass manages passwords for websites, recommended as well.\nFor your use case, of syncing across Chrome and Safari, ipad, etc: XMarks doesn't work on iPad Safari. You can use Chrome on iPad, and get your bookmarks synced from Chrome, but this doesnt work for Safari. To get Safari to share the same bookmarks:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your Mac, Install XMarks for Chrome\n\n*Create XMarks account, and sync your\nbookmarks\n\n*Install XMarks for Safari on Mac\n\n*Sign into your account, and\nallow XMarks to overwrite your Safari bookmarks \n\n*Make sure iCloud is\nsyncing Safari Bookmarks \n\n*Ipad/iPhone Safari will now contain same\nbookmarks as Chrome.\n\n\nA: Alternatively, if you don't want to add more apps to your devices, you can use Pinterest for an easy bookmark storage location that you can access from any device, any browser. I save by pinning, you can make boards secret, and when working on a collaborative project, invite others to pin to it. No need to mess with your device or app or browser settings. And very handy.\n", "Q: Access to Time Capsule via Internet Can I access data on a current Time Capsule via the internet? If so, how does it work? Would I be able to make Time Machine Backups then as well? Does it appear as a disk in Finder?\n\nA: Yes, if you sign in to your iCloud account in the TC preferences. Fire up AirPort utility and make sure your iCloud account info is in the \"Back to my Mac\" section of the \"Base Station\" tab.\nYour TC disk will show up in the finder under \"Shared\" on any macs that are also signed into iCloud/BTMM. \nNot sure if you'll be able to select it as a backup disk though; Time Machine preferences don't have a standard file chooser UI, it seems to demand either a local disk or a Time Capsule on a local network. \n", "Q: Safari: Can I open all bookmarks in a bookmark folder in a new window? Is it possible to open all bookmarks in a bookmark folder in Safari in a new Safari window? \nI know that I can do this with a single bookmark, but can I do the same with a bookmark folder?\n\nA: Open the Bookmarks menu, top left, right click the folder of bookmarks, Open in Tabs...\n\nThough irritatingly, it re-uses the current window, so maybe start with a new one first.\n\nA: Option click folder in Favorites. \n\nA: use Bookmarks->Show BookMarks from the Safari menu. This will open all the list of bookmarks on your left side. There you can rearrange or edit the bookmarks.\n", "Q: Why does jailbreaking causes many errors in ios devices? I have an iPad Air running ios 7.1.2, the device is great it runs smoothly without any lags or errors, some apps crashes only a few times. But when I jailbroken the device, the cydia apps where crashing 80 percent of the time, sometimes they disappeared and would reappear after a device restart. The iPad would sometimes freeze when I open cydia store. With this in mind, although jailbreaking gives you a lot of advantages, after all these problems it doesn't seem worth jailbreaking my device. Can someone tell me why these problems happens and is their a way to solve them?\n\nA: If you know about jailbreaking you really should know what it does. It is literally changing how the OS operates, disables some functions and replaces them with others. \"Hacking\" in the classic sense of modifying someone else's design. None of this has been approved by Apple, nor tested by Apple, nor anyone who writes apps. When you jailbreak a device, even Android phone or any other electronic equipment (computer, cable box, old ham radio, electric toothbrush), you run the risk of it not working right (at least not how it came from the factory).\nThough the jailbreak community is extremely talented, they can never guarantee everything will work perfectly. They can't. Apple can change the OS so it disables jailbreaks, either by will or by accident.\nThe solution is to either: A- don't jailbreak or B- jailbreak and live with some issues like yours that crop up. This is my philosophical answer. If, as Kymer suggests, there is simply some app conflict, that still falls under solution \"B\" -living with it but trying to troubleshoot and deal with those kind of issues (that's my more pragmatic answer).\n", "Q: What to do if a distribution certificate is expiring for an app store app I have an app in the app store and the distribution profile is about to run out in about a week, but my developer membership doesn't actually  expire till next year.  Do I need to rebuild and re-submit my app with a new certificate?\n\nA: You can renew the certificate by selecting the certificate and clicking Renew.

I'm worried about camfecting (webcam hacking). The built-in camera light on my macbook (running OSX) is not on, but it isn't hard wired so that doesn't say a lot.\nCan I watch outbound traffic in activity monitor to detect data egress (live streaming seems most likely when camfecting is in progress)?\n\nA: Objective See has an application that continuously monitors webcam and microphone activity called OverSight. It throws up a notification if either become active and has worked well for me. \nNote: the developers rightly warn that this software may not catch all malicious use of the webcam or microphone.\nhttps://objective-see.com/products/oversight.html\n\nA: It is \"hard\"wired... the firmware of the webcam has this behavior built in. To hack this one would need to rewrite the camera firmware to disable it.\nThere is very little chance of this actually happening to you. Apple does not document on how to do this, and the actually firmware is probably encrypted.\nYou seem to be unable to find evidence of this, but got you started on your search in the first place? Lack of evidence would mean this did not take place, yet you are searching anyway?\nArticle on the subject:\nhttps://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/bitstream/handle/1774.2/36569/camera.pdf\n", "Q: New Airport Time capsule on dorm network This week I purchased an AirPort Time Capsule and attempted to set up my own network in my dorm apartment. The network at my school has two options, one requires me to login with my school ID and password every time I get on the internet and the other is password protected WPA2 which asks for the same information (ID and password) but logs me in without having to type my info in every time.\nI plugged my Time Capsule into the Ethernet port on the wall and set it up. When I did, the school had me register an IP address to it, I started using it and everything seemed to be fine, but then I got my older Mac and my new MacBook Pro Retina connected to my Time Capsule network and the new MacBook would disconnect every few minutes and sometimes it would reconnect, sometimes it would give me an \"!\" in the WiFi sign. Also I tried connecting my Apple TV to it, it said it was connected, with an IP address and everything but, it wouldn't let me use any content—no YouTube, it wouldn't sign into iTunes etc. I have no clue what to do.\n\nA: Since you only have 1 IP address from the school, you need to make sure that your airport is setup in NAT mode, and not in bridged mode.  You'll need to make sure it's giving out DHCP addresses as well, and you may want to make sure it's not in a range used elsewhere on campus so that you don't run afoul of weird routing issues.  \nI suggest the 172.16 range since it's rarely used by institutions in my experience, YMMV.\nLet me know if this is helpful! \n", "Q: Safari 7 Developer Tools Bug? Ran into some peculiar behavior in the midst of my developing antics. I have my developer tools set to appear in a separate window - I noticed if I right-click and inspect an element, close the developer tools window, then inspect another element, the first element remains targeted in the DOM inspector.\nI often inspect elements just for quick reference on a value or stylesheet location, and close the window out of habit because it crowds my limited screen space. At first this behavior was just a mild annoyance, but it's becoming maddening when I have to right-click twice on anything I want to inspect. I'm now doing this dozens of times a day - is this bug known/documented anywhere? Is there a fix for it?\nI'm deeply considering switching to Chrome, but Chrome has it's own deal-breakers that irk me slightly more than this bug. Any suggestions are welcome!\n\nA: I recommend using firebug. It is one of the most useful tools for me as a web developer. It works in safari. And I can't say enough about it. \nBy the way, I'm in no way affiliated with firebug. \n", "Q: Stop Chrome loading videos in background tabs? As I'm sure we're all aware, Chrome by default loads background tabs as soon as they're opened - youtube videos autoplay, ads load, it's a mess. To my knowledge (and following from this thread) there is no way to change this natively, and no plans to implement it in the future.\nI've tried searching around for apps/extensions that prevent background tabs from being loaded until they're navigated to, with very limited and mediocre results. The closest solutions seem to be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Muting tabs that are making sound\n\n*Suspending background tabs after minimum 5 minutes\nNeither of these prevent the video from loading the first place, and still leave me with a lot of bandwidth-sucking and restarting the video when I get around to the tab. First-world problems, I know, but after a few weeks of this it gets under your skin.\nI'm hoping my search-fu just isn't strong enough to find a solution - is there any way to give Chrome behavior similar to Safari or Firefox, where the tab just doesn't load until you navigate to it? I'll accept apps, extensions, terminal hacks, anything that works.\n\nA: Until Chrome comes up with that function like FF, the closest you can get to it is to Disable lots of bandwidth and storage consuming apps.\nThat can be done here:\n\nAlso go to your chrome://plugins/\nand disable all Plugins you do not want.\nThat will not stop the background loading of the page but will limit the what, and you can still use them at your desire (it will ask you).\nAnd it looks like this example of not loading some advertisement at the top of a page.\n\n", "Q: SSH to a remote station without port forwarding on my mac I would like to SSH onto a remote linux computer from the internet at school, which does not support port forwarding. \nI type ssh root@<myipadresshere.com\nbut of course it fails. \nIs there a way to SSH to my remote server using any network I am connected to without the ports being forwarded?\nIf I type SSH -A root@MyIP , it times out.\nSkylers-MacBook-Pro:~ skylerfennell$ ssh -vvv root@kd0whb.duckdns.org\nOpenSSH_5.9p1, OpenSSL 0.9.8y 5 Feb 2013\ndebug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh_config\ndebug1: /etc/ssh_config line 20: Applying options for *\ndebug2: ssh_connect: needpriv 0\ndebug1: Connecting to kd0whb.duckdns.org [67.166.55.176] port 22.\ndebug1: Connection established.\ndebug1: identity file /Users/skylerfennell/.ssh/id_rsa type -1\ndebug1: identity file /Users/skylerfennell/.ssh/id_rsa-cert type -1\ndebug1: identity file /Users/skylerfennell/.ssh/id_dsa type -1\ndebug1: identity file /Users/skylerfennell/.ssh/id_dsa-cert type -1\ndebug1: Remote protocol version 2.0, remote software version OpenSSH_4.3\ndebug1: match: OpenSSH_4.3 pat OpenSSH_4*\ndebug1: Enabling compatibility mode for protocol 2.0\ndebug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_5.9\ndebug2: fd 3 setting O_NONBLOCK\ndebug3: load_hostkeys: loading entries for host \"kd0whb.duckdns.org\" from file \"/Users/skylerfennell/.ssh/known_hosts\"\ndebug3: load_hostkeys: found key type RSA in file /Users/skylerfennell/.ssh/known_hosts:6\ndebug3: load_hostkeys: loaded 1 keys\ndebug3: order_hostkeyalgs: prefer hostkeyalgs: ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com,ssh-rsa-cert-v00@openssh.com,ssh-rsa\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT sent\nWrite failed: Broken pipe\n\n\nSkylers-MacBook-Pro:~ skylerfennell$ ssh -a root@kd0whb.duckdns.org\n    ssh: connect to host kd0whb.duckdns.org port 22: Operation timed out\n\n\nA: are you referring to port forwarding or agent forwarding?

I'm a developer at my small office and we exclusively use Exchange 365 for our email, and I am getting incredibly tired and frustrated of the web interface. I would like to use a local mail client.\nPostbox looked great, but some research reveals it does not natively support Exchange. I would like to have a client similarly feature rich (particularly when it comes to tagging/organization), but natively supports Exchange protocols.\nAny recommendations?\n\nA: I'll state the obvious one: Outlook:Mac supports Exchange natively, including support for Exchange's categories (which Exchange uses instead of tags)\nThere are third-party add-ins like MailTags which add support for categories/tags to Apple Mail.\nThunderbird + ExQuilla doesn't support categories/tags.\n\nA: A good alternative to Postbox would be the Thunderbird. made by the FireFox makers.\nIt can work with exchange server.\n", "Q: Variable not defined (AppleScript) For some reason the name of thePath comes up as not defined by my Automator workflow.\non run {input, parameters}\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set thePath to the (first item of the input)\n        set namedFolder to ((the name of thePath) as text)\n        set namedFolder to ((text 1 thru 13) of namedFolder)\n    end tell\n    return namedFolder\nend run\n\n\nA: namedFolder only exists in the scope of your tell block.

I only have one desktop in spaces, and when I take an app full screen, it always goes to the right of my desktop... I know I can re-arrange by hand in mission control, but I'd like to be able to skip that and have an arbitrary app open to the left of my desktop.\n\nA: If I have understood your question correctly, you can achieve this by the following:\n1. Launch Mission Control\n2. Add a new desktop by clicking Add to the right\n3. Drag the desktops in order of preference\n4. Exit Mission Control\n5. Navigate to the desktop you want an app to open on then right-click the app icon in the dock, choose Options and select This Desktop underneath Assign To (this assigns the selected app to the active desktop in either full screen or normal maximised views)\n\nNote that when you drag the desktops, the naming will always be ordered numerically from left to right. So if you began with a single desktop, adding any subsequent desktops will change the name of the original desktop to Desktop 1. If you drag another desktop to the left of Desktop 1 then Desktop 1 will become 2.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro file mods When I run ls -l there are files listed with @ file mod for some folders:\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root  admin      170 Sep  4 13:51 Users\ndrwxrwxrwt@  3 root  admin      102 Sep  5 09:02 Volumes\n\nI realized that the folders with @ sign can not be displayed in Finder.\nCan somebody tell me what is the @ sign for and how i can remove it?\n\nA: The @ sign means that the files have extended attributes.

My iCloud backup was current so I lost very little.  My podcast subscriptions were maintained through the backup/restore and were available again in the Podcasts app after they downloaded the episodes I previously had downloaded and queued.  All of this worked as expected.\nA day or 2 after the restore was complete, I noticed 3 stuck downloads.  They wouldn't complete and if I cancelled them they kept coming back and failing to download.  I didn't recognize the naming scheme of the episodes so I started looking further and found 3 new podcasts were listed in the application.  These podcasts were completely new to me and nothing I would have ever subscribed to or tried to download.  They are all on topics I have never podcasted on so I have full confidence they aren't renamed versions of other podcasts I've listened to before.  My suspicion is they are the result of either data corruption in the podcasts feed configuration from my backup/restore, or from data corruption in how Apple handles the sync.  Specifically they are:\n\n\n*\n\n*TWIMA: This Week In Martial Arts\n\n*Edward Daniel Podcast\n\n*Cape First Podcast\n\n\nI've tried everything that I can think of and everything I can find online short of removing the Podcasts application.  From recollection, this is what I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit the podcast list, and delete the offending podcasts - when I do this they do disappear but come back after the application is closed and reopened\n\n*Edit each podcast to remove the offending episode that keeps trying to download - when I do this the episode disappears but comes back after the application is closed and reopened\n\n*Subscribe to the podcast, wait, then unsubscribe to the podcast - no effect\n\n*Mark the episode as played and allow it to be auto-deleted - no effect\n\n*Turn on podcast sync in Settings - no effect\n\n*Turn off podcast sync in Settings - no effect\n\n*View my podcasts in iTunes - these podcasts aren't listed\n\n*Turn on podcast syncing in iTunes, find the podcasts, I can only find TWIMA and Edward Daniel, subscribe to them, then unsubscribe and delete them - no effect\n\n*Turn off podcast syncing in iTunes - no effect\n\n*Download other episodes of the podcast and delete those episodes and then the offending podcast - the podcasts disappear but come back after the app is closed and reopened, and the successfully downloaded episode is not shown, only the download that fails\n\n*(I'm sure I've forgotten other options)\n\n\nI don't want to delete all my podcast subscriptions and delete the application if I can avoid that.  I have a lot of played history on some very long running podcasts that would take a lot of effort to store in text and rebuild afterwards.  If I uninstall the Podcasts app, will it remember my played history?  I would be willing to try that if it should keep my play history (after I've dumped my history to text JIC).  I'm also curious if another backup/restore would have some chance of success.\nFWIW: I don't have any other podcasts applications tied to my iCloud/iTunes account that would be causing this injection.\nAny help or advice on how to permanently deleted these episodes and podcasts would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: I am having a similar problem: I had 18 podcast eposodes that were stuck attempting to download. I was able to get rid of 17 of them by manually downloading each one by searching the name in the podcast app. After manually downloading them, a restart of the phone would remove the stuck downloads. That might fix your issue, if you haven't solved it.\nMy further problem is that the 18th stuck episode is no longer available.\nI am going to attempt a restore but I expect to have the same issue afterward.\n\nA: I know that this is an old thread, but I have recently struggled with that problem so I thought that I would post what seems to have fix the problem for me.\nAfter upgrading my iPhone 5S to an iPhone 6, I restored my profile and started re-downloading all the data and files. When I got to the Podcasts app, it tried to re-download a podcast episode from a podcast that had been removed from the iTunes store since I originally downloaded it on my previous phone. At that point, every time I restarted the Podcasts app, the podcast appeared in the items downloading list but could never be downloaded successfully.\nI tried everything mentioned here. Even after unsubscribing, when I would restart the app, the podcast reappeared and the app tried to download the podcast episode. I then observed that in the iTunes app the podcast episode was also stuck downloading.\nThat's when I remembered another syncing problem that was solved by signing out of the iTunes Store and that maybe the iTunes Store was the reason the podcast kept reappearing.\nTry the following steps :\n\n\n*\n\n*Sign out from the iTunes Store in Settings>iTunes & App Store\n\n*Open Podcasts app\n\n*Cancel the download of the podcast episode by swiping right-to-left and clicking Cancel\n\n*Unsubscribe from podcast\n\n*Delete podcast by swiping right-to-left and clicking Delete\n\n*Power off phone and restart\n\n*Open Podcasts app, if the app is still attempting to download the episode, repeat the cancel, unsubscribe and delete steps\n\n*Power off phone and restart\n\n*Sign in back to the iTunes Store in Settings>iTunes & App Store\n\n*Power off phone and restart\n\n*Open Podcasts app to make sure the podcast and the attempt at downloading the episode are gone\n\n\nIt seems to have fix the problem. Hope this helps, this thing was driving me crazy. Good luck all !\n\nA: I was able to solve the problem through a combination of updating to iOS 8 and restoring to a new phone.  I can't say for sure which step solved the problem but I suspect it was the new version of the Podcast app in iOS 8.  The ghost podcasts did show up after the restore to the new phone but the episodes weren't trying to download.  A quick delete of the episodes and they haven't been seen from again.\n\nA: Near the top of the page it says \"[#] items downloading\".  Tap on that statement and you get a new page with all the stuck episodes. You can swipe each one to delete them.  That worked for me. \n", "Q: Reversing mouse scroll in mavericks How to reverse the mouse scroll so that moving a wheel up will make the page go up, and a mouse wheel down makes the page go down.\n\nA: System Prefs -> Mouse.

The sound is very consistent, and just never stops. What is this, have you had it and how did you fix it? \n\nA: The only moveable part in a retina macbook pro 13\" is the fan as seen on the following picture: (courtesy of ifixit)\n\nTherefore it must be an issue with the fan, particularly because the noise originates from the right side (imagine the macbook pro flipped and the fan will be on the right side). Either the fan failed or something got stuck in the fan and is preventing it from spinning. I suggest you take it into an Apple Store so they can have a look at it in detail.\n\nA: If you don't live near an Apple store, you can use a stethoscope or a piece of tubing to localize the noise. Check around the speakers, the keyboard, the trackpad and also on the back of the display and the back of the unibody enclosure.\nQuite rapidly, you will know exactly where the noise is and you can usually tell what's causing the noise from ifixit repair guides or a follow-on question here with your specific model and your specific location of noise.\n", "Q: How to open Emacs like in Linux Terminal I just got a Macbook (my first one!) and want to know how to configure Emacs to run in the same way it runs in Linux. That is, if I type \"emacs foo.c &\" in the Terminal, I want to either open either a new or existing file called foo.c in a separate Emacs window, NOT in the terminal. \n\nA: If the emacs you are running in Linux creates a new window then you are running it as an X11 application (a GUI application).  Normally emacs on Linux and other systems just runs in the terminal you have open (as a console application).\nThe version of emacs that ships with OS X is compiled just to run in a terminal. To replicate running in a new window you need another version of emacs. I would use Aquamacs which is an emacs modified to act like a normal OSX Cocoa app. The standard GNU emacs has a Cocoa app version which defaults to be more similar to behaviour on other platforms and is available in a binary version here.\nYou can also get X11 versions as well.

I'm curious exactly what in the OS won't allow music to be added to the directory.\n\nA: Apple calls the area in the storage of an iOS device containing media (music, video) for the built-in apps to play the iPod library.  iOS provides an interface that App Store apps can call to use the iPod library, but this is basically limited to playback and search.\nOther than that, apps' access to storage is restricted by sandboxing.\nFrom Apple's \"iOS App Programming Guide\":\n\nFor security reasons, iOS places each app (including its preferences\n  and data) in a sandbox at install time. A sandbox is a set of\n  fine-grained controls that limit the app’s access to files,\n  preferences, network resources, hardware, and so on. As part of the\n  sandboxing process, the system installs each app in its own sandbox\n  directory, which acts as the home for the app and its data.\n\nThis means that third party apps from the App Store can't directly access files other than their own (like the iPod library), so they can't save files that they download anywhere but their own directories.\nIn addition to the sandboxing, Apple also has a mandatory review and approval process for apps to go into the App Store, and so apps that don't follow the guidelines aren't available.  In a sense, that's not really a restriction \"in the OS\", because Apple can change their review process at any time and newly-allowed apps can be downloaded and used immediately without any change to iOS.  Also, iOS app developers can get their own apps signed to test on their own iOS devices, before the review process.  But from the point of view of the average user, what restrictions exactly are enforced by the sandboxing and what are only App Store guidelines is academic.  \nOn jailbroken devices, applications that have not been approved by Apple can be installed, and jailbreaks generally modify iOS so that apps can operate outside of sandbox restrictions. So it's possible for an app that understands the current iPod library file formats (for instance recent versions of iFile) to add music directly to the library.\n", "Q: Brand new MacBook Pro with Retina display - Mail, Preview and App Store freezes on launch I can never use most Apple-made apps on my MacBook Pro with Retina display, as the UI never responds, however Mail gets new emails and Preview displays images.

Is it possible to remove all/most offline documentation from XCode 5, to free up disk space?\nI would assume it is possible to make XCode (like Visual Studio in Windows) access documentation online, so removing offline documentation doesn't affect any functionality. Yes?\n\nA: Xcode 5, 6 and 7 documentation itself is located within:\n~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets\n\nYou can delete the files and when you re-launch Xcode, it will offer to re-download the current docs if you have automatic updates set.\nBefore deleting actual documentation, make sure your downloads folder for the images that contain the installers and the documentation are cleaned out:\n~/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode/Downloads\n\nIf you do decide to delete the documentation itself you will no longer have access to it through Xcode — so be careful not to delete the Core DocSets, or any others that you might need access to regularly as you don't fail over gracefully to the web documentation. \nThe documentation that is available for download through XCode is not simply a mirror of what Apple shows online. The docs available online amount to about 1/2 of what is actually available from the more comprehensive downloaded versions. Online documentation can also be updated to a newer build of Xcode, so downloading a copy ensures you have the correct documentation for your version of Xcode.\n", "Q: How to see total memory usage per app?

Recently, my MacBook stopped powering up. When pressing the power button, nothing at all happened. The usual green-yellow light on the power supply appeared normal, but no lights or sounds came from the MacBook itself. Only very rarely, after trying many times throughout the week, would it power on after pressing \"power on\". Once on, it never powered it off without me instructing it to shutdown.\nI took the MacBook to a repair store. They said I should leave it for a few days. When I returned, it worked, albeit they lost a few of the screws, didn't completely bolt the parts firmly together, and got it really dirty.

I don't know if they made significant changes, such as replaced internal parts, or just wiggled some wire and got it working again.\nAre there any steps I can take to investigate the computer to identify how the repair store fixed?\n\nA: I work at an Apple Authorized Service Provider, and the fact that they won't tell you what they did means it was probably just an SMC reset that took two seconds.

These functions include:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Responding to presses of the power button\n  \n\nI'm guessing they didn't tell you this because all it takes to reset the SMC is holding down 3 keys and the power button at the same time while plugged in, and you'd possibly argue about having to pay them. It seems pretty shady of them, because we have machines come in needing a simple SMC reset all the time, and most of the time we waive labor charges, but for them to not even tell you that that's what they did doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\nA: It's likely that as the poster above says, it was an SMC reset which is documented on the Apple Support site : [1] https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201295\n[1]: Intel-based Macs: Resetting the System Management Controller (SMC)\n", "Q: Torrent clients for Mac other than uTorrent Can someone recommend a good torrent client for the Mac, other than uTorrent?\n[The only problem I have with uTorrent is that occasionally it doesn't respect the upload limit.

But I didn't check for this option very thorough, it might have it :-)\nOne of the best features for me is that it can download a file in sequential order (think of a video that you can start watching it, before the download finishes 100%). \n\nA: I highly recommend the open source client Transmission.\n\nFeatures:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*The Mac OS X interface is written in Objective-C\n  \n*Shows transfer rates in the dock icon\n  \n*Uses Growl notifications and dock badging to keep you informed.\n  \n*Download/Upload Prioritization\n  \n\n\nOther:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Doesn't bundle toolbars, pop-up/flash ads, social tools, or any other useless crap.\n  \n*It doesn't hold some feaures back for a payware version.\n  \n*Its source code is available for anyone to review.\n  \n*Doesn't track users, and their website/forums have no third-party ads or analytics.\n  \n\nI've been using Transmission for many years and can't imagine using anything else.\n\nA: One more venerable classic client is Deluge.\nCompletely free from advertising and unwanted plugins, and has a focus on providing features the community needs, such as private downloads, password protection, and scheduling and bandwidth options.\nSupports a range of plugins that expand its functionality. The plugins can utilise privacy blocklists (which you shouldn't rely on), labelling, scheduling and notification options. You can monitor folders for files, and add them automatically.\n\nA: What about Aria2?\nBeing command-line based it's perhaps the most lightweight and powerful tool, and it's not only for Torrent but for file downloads in general.\nVery easy to install:\n(if you have the popular Homebrew package manager)\nbrew install aria2\n\nand very easy to use:\naria2c TORRENTFILE\n\nYou will be surprised by how easy and how fast it downloads the files. For advanced users, it has also many useful options, e.g. to attempt to download fragments of files in some specific order (e.g. to be able to watch a video while downloading it).\n", "Q: Two Apple ids and just want one I changed my e-mail from hotmail to gmail during 2013.\nI want my Apple id to follow that.\nThe old email account is still there when I configured my iPhone 5s and tryied to install my icloud and phone settings.\nThe new phone wants both apple ids. Why?\n\nQuestion : How do I remove my old Apple-id from my phone?\n\nA: I'm assuming when you say \"both Apple IDs\", that you mean an Apple ID using your Gmail account, and an Apple ID using your Hotmail account. \nIt asked you for passwords to both of those Apple IDs because you have purchases or free items licensed under both IDs.\n", "Q: iPhone 5s: Have to wait before I swipe after unlock animation is done I use the iPhone 5s with iOS 7.1.2.\nWhen I unlock the phone with my finger print, there is an animation where the icons move from the edges towards the center of the screen. After this animation is done, I have to wait approximately an entire second before I can swipe left/right on the touch screen in order to get to the apps on the other screens.\nThis is extremely annoying! Simple and quick tasks such as checking on emails will take far longer because I have to wait. This is very annoying and there is simply no way to avoid this and I don't know why Apple didn't fix this already. That's the first thing I ever noticed after buying this phone.\nWill this be fixed? Is there any reasonable workaround (I don't want to install jailbreaks) ?\nI know that the out-of-the-box iPhone 5s doesn't do this that way. After you install the latest iOS, the error occurs (maybe it's a \"feature\"?)\nThis isn't a bug that's only on my phone. I did reset it once (out of other reasons) and the bug was still there. Later on my phone got stolen, so I bought a new one and it was still there.\nAccording to ActMonitor, I have 230 MB RAM free plus 100 MB RAM inactive. There is also 3.6 GB storage available (out of 16 GB)\nTake a look at 7:31 in this video. There you can also see it, but not as extreme as with my phone.\n\nA: This isn't a solution (I doubt there is one, at least without jailbreaking), but it seems you can open apps immediately. So I would recommend putting those apps that you want to be able to open right away every time you check your phone like email on the bottom, so that they are always there. \nIt also looks like pressing the home button to swipe all the way left to the first home screen does not have a delay, so you could put apps on the first home screen and press the home button after unlocking (which is easy as you finger is already there). When I tested it it seemed pretty easy to accidentally activate Siri, so you might want to disable her if you do this if you don't use her.\n", "Q: Applescript question for copying files I wrote a script to copy files from an SD Card to a Thunderbolt Hard Drive.  \nI wanted the action to automatically do all of this in a single shelled applescript under an automator action.  \nWhen I run this applescript, it seems to work, but now users are reporting back to me getting errors when copying large files (5-8GB).  \nHere is the script I've written.

When I did this it worked ok. I gave the script 30mins.\nI do not have SD cards so in my testing I had to change the code some to accommodate my setup.\nI do notice :\n\n\n*\n\n*you have a two tell blocks for finder where you only need the one.\n\n*since you are not using the on run handler and the return input you do not need it in the code.\n\n*Your folder creation code has no check for existing names.\nThis also means there will be an error if the user uses an existing name.\n\n*Since they cannot create target folders of the same name there will never be a file/folder existing in it of the same name. So there is no real reason to check if an item exists already. And saying that, you should be able to remove the repeat block and exists checking and just use ( with timeout code):\n.\n with timeout of 1800 seconds --30mins\n\n              duplicate items of the_files to target_folder\n\n end timeout\n\nThis will also result in a single copy action in finder rather than possibly 10s-1000s of individual ones.\nFor your date default answer you can use:\nset theDate to do shell script \"date +%d%m%Y-\"\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    set FolderName to (text returned of (display dialog \"Please enter Today's Date: mmddyyyy-(alphaVariable if more than one card today.\" & return & \"e.g. \" & (theDate & \"B\") default answer (theDate & \"A\")))\n\n....\n\nThis will give you a current dated dialogue like this.\n\n", "Q: Rsync fails due to Sudo timeout I am trying to run a lengthy Rsync (local machine only, no ssh, no lan or wan connects involved) but Sudo is timing out and the script fails. Total runtime of the command is about 20 mins. What is the recommend way to either lengthen the Sudo timeout or disable Sudo from that particular command only? I am the admin of this system but do not log in as root.\nThank you in advance.\n\nA: How are you actually invoking the script? If you run a script like sudo script.sh, all commands inside the script are run as superuser and you should never have it time out. If you're running a script that has sudo commands inside it, then it could ask for a password more than once if it takes too long between sudo commands. The sudo timeout only applies to new invocations of the sudo command. If your case is the latter, you do have the option of using the command sudo -v in your script which will extend the timeout by its default value (normally 5 minutes, but see below for how to change it), but if everything inside needs superuser permissions anyways, it makes more sense to invoke the entire script with sudo.\nIf you do want to change the sudo time out, you need to edit the sudoers file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bring up the sudoers file:\nsudo visudo\n\n\n*Find the line that starts with:\nDefaults    env_reset\n\n\n*Add a comma and the command timestamp_timeout=minutes to the end\n(replace minutes with the number of minutes desired, 0 will always\nask for a password, a negative number will never time out -\ndangerous):\nDefaults    env_reset,timestamp_timeout=10\n\n\n*Save and close the file.\n", "Q: does anyone know how to login without credit card informations I have already made my Apple ID through Game center instead of doing it first on the App store.

I just remembered that the None option is hidden when you update a Game Center ID. Alternatively, (not reccommended) you could enter phony info.\n\nA: According to Apple as of (Last Modified: Jul 14, 2014) you do not need credit card for Apple Store.\nApple also recommends to have only one ID, for game center and all others.\nYou will be asked for payment information if you use products that are not free.\nCreate an iTunes Store, App Store, or iBooks Store account without a\ncredit card or other payment method.\nThere are 2 possibilities:\nOne is you already have a Apple Id, and you want to remove the Payment information.\nSecond one is you are creating a new account (without Payment information.)\n\n", "Q: Can I use sharing?

Thanks so much\n\nA: If you get to the cmd-r screen there you should have the restore option.\nSince your system froze, probably the best is to use restore the os x.\nYour system has the Internet restore option.\nIn order to reinstall OS X, you need to be connected to the Internet over an Ethernet or Wi-Fi network.

I'm creating a game where the player can unlock worlds, where they can unlock levels within those worlds, each levels has a highscore, and so on.\nI was wondering in which way should I store this data?  I was originally thinking of making a number of separate plist files, but that seems like an approach which could end up spiralling out of control.\nHas anyone approached this problem and come up with a decent solution?\n\nA: Most apps like that store data in a SQLite3 database rather than property lists. I recommend this route instead—actual implementation/etc is off-topic here.\n\nA: I think a good approach would be to save each world under a category, and saving the information for each world.\n For example:\n<dict>\n    <key>Worlds</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>TheLand</key>\n        <dict>\n            <key>WorldIsUnlocked</key>\n            <true/>\n            <key>Highscore</key>\n            <string>1304</string>\n            <key>Levels</key>\n            <array>\n                <key>level1</key>\n                <true/>\n                <key>level2</key>\n                <true/>\n                <key>level3</key>\n                <false/>\n            </array>\n        </dict>\n    </dict>\n</dict>\n\nThis way, you can easily point to whatever piece of information you want.\nE.g extracting the highscore of the world \"The Land\"  Worlds -> TheLand -> Highscore, will print out: 1304.\nChecking what levels are available within \"The Land\" Worlds -> TheLand -> Levels, will print out an array: level1: true, level2: true, level3: false.\nOn a side note, this question is more programming related and should therefor be asked over at stackoverflow.\n", "Q: Always open the finder in new tab I want a folder to be always opened in a tab instead of new window. The reason I want this is so that I have only one Finder window with multiple tabs. \nIf apps keeps on opening new window you may miss the opened folder.\nNew to mac so wondering how to do.\nI am using OS X 10.9.2\n\nA: As noted by another answer: you can't have all new Finder calls open as tabs in one Finder window. Cool idea though.\nAnd, as noted by another answer: you can control the behaviour of Cmd-Click actions in Finder so they open new tabs instead of new windows by going to the Finder preferences (Cmd+`) and making sure Open folders in tabs instead of new windows is selected in the General tab on the Preferences pane:\n\n\nThe reason I want this is so that I have only one Finder window with multiple tabs. If apps keeps on opening new window you may miss the opened folder.\n\nThe above preference settings for Finder won't stop apps from opening new windows. You can, however, use Finder's Window > Merge All Windows menu item to pull all open Finder windows in to the current, front-most, Finder window as tabs. This will address your straggler concerns, though in an inelegant manner I'm afraid.\nYou could use this Alfred workflow to trigger the Merge from Alfred. Or, if you're a LaunchBar user like me, here's a little AppleScript that'll do it:\non gui_scripting_status()\n  tell application \"System Events\"\n    set ui_enabled to UI elements enabled\n  end tell\n  if ui_enabled is false then\n    tell application \"System Preferences\"\n      activate\n      set current pane to pane id \"com.apple.preference.universalaccess\"\n      display dialog \"The GUI scripting architecture of Mac OS X is currently disabled.\" & return & return & \"To activate GUI Scripting select the checkbox \\\"Enable access for assistive devices\\\" in the Universal Access preference pane.\" with icon 1 buttons {\"Okay\"} default button 1\n    end tell\n  end if\n  return ui_enabled\nend gui_scripting_status\n \non click_menu(app_name, menu_name, menu_item)\n  try\n    tell application app_name\n      activate\n    end tell\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n      click menu item menu_item of menu menu_name of menu bar 1 of process app_name\n    end tell\n    return true\n  on error error_message\n    return false\n  end try\nend click_menu\n \nif gui_scripting_status() then\n  click_menu(\"Finder\", \"Window\", \"Merge All Windows\")\nend if\n\nIt's based off of this handy code blob.

Opening a destination in Finder from outside Finder (such as a Reveal in Finder or selecting a folder from a Dock stack) will create a new Finder window.\n\nA: In order to view in Tads you need to set it that way.\nFirst open Finder preferences and select open in new tab.\n\nNext in View menu select show tabs.\n\nIf you hold the cmd key and double click on new folder in finder it will open it in a new Tab bar\nOr, using the Plus sign on the right you can now open new tabs and decide what they will show, however the content displayed will depend on what you open in that tab, while the previous tabs remain unaffected.\nSample:\n\n\nA: Currently this is possible on macOS Sierra with the new \"prefer tabs\" feature.\nTo enable it, go to System Preferences > Dock > Prefer tabs when opening documents and select Always.\nWhat are the downsides to this? Opening a folder will force open it in a new tab. That means that if you have a Finder window open in another space, the folder will be opened in the background with hardly any visual feedback. This may prevent you from knowing if a folder actually has opened and forces you to manually go to the Finder window to see the contents of what you opened. Additionally, this option enables the feature is all apps, not just in the Finder. \n\nA: I used the AppleSript join-windows.scpt like:\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"Finder\"\n        click menu item \"Merge All Windows\" of menu \"Window\" of menu bar 1\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nand then make with crontab -e\n0,15,30,45 * * * * osascript /Users/me/Library/Scripts/join-windows.scpt > /dev/null\n\nafter first run in System Preferences / Privacy Tab you need to allow cron to control computer.\n\nA: HI it is possible through system preferences.\nGo into general section\n\nGo to prefer tabs section.

I'm currently trying to do something quite odd. I want to automate updates on multiple computers in my office and first I need to open a program and said program has two fields; one for username and another for a password. \nObviously walking around the office to 50 computers and inputting my user and password is quite annoying so what I'd rather do is be able to assign my username and password to variables and then pass those variables to the username and password fields in the program. \nSo far I can open the program via the remote desktop app on all the machines and I can use osascript to send keystrokes but I want terminal to ask me for the username and password so that I don't save them into my script. Is there an easy way to do this and then tell those variables that I save my pass and username into to be the keystrokes? Thanks!!\n\nA: These lines will prompt for your username and password:\necho -n 'Username: '\nread username\n\necho -n 'Password: '\nread -s password #The -s means silent, so your password is not shown in the terminal.\n\nYou can then use the variables $username and $password in the rest of your script, like this:\nosascript -e 'tell app \"System Events\" to keystroke \"'\"$username\"'\" & tab & \"'\"$password\"'\"'\n\n", "Q: Macbook Pro limits resolution of Samsung U28D590D to 1920x1080 I use a MacBook Pro late 2011 and I recently bought a Samsung Screen U28D590D 28\" which could, normally, bring me a resolution of 2560x1440 with DisplayPort.\nBut, my screen recognizes my MBP only with Mini-DisplayPort → HDMI connection. Mini-DisplayPort → DisplayPort connection doesn't work and I'm limited to a 1920x1080 resolution. Why is this happening and how can I fix it?\n\nA: I looked up the specs and that display supports 4K resolutions.  2011 model Macs do not support 4K displays.  I understand that you're trying to run it at 2560x1440, which Apple specifically says that model MBP supports for external displays.  However, here's the issue you're running into...\nTo get that 4K resolution, you must have either an HDMI 1.4 or DisplayPort 1.2 source.  HDMI 1.4 is definitely out.  You cannot get anything higher than 1080p over a MiniDP -> HDMI adapter.  So that leaves just DisplayPort 1.2 as your only hope.\nI cannot verify whether or not the MiniDP port on 2011 MacBook Pros actually supports DP 1.2.  Apple doesn't say on their spec pages and there is argument among tech sites as to whether or not it's does.  But let's say for argument's sake that it is supported...\n4K displays require the use of a specific feature of the DP 1.2 spec, called Multi-Stream Transport (MST). Even if the MiniDP port on your Mac is DisplayPort 1.2, both the GPU and the driver must also support MST in order to drive a 4K display.  Even though you're not trying to run the full 4K resolution on it (which you definitely cannot do), the screen may still be attempting to negotiate an MST link over the DP connection even though it doesn't need to and is failing to do so.  That would explain why you don't see anything.\nThe first thing I would do is check your display's menus to see if there are any settings relating to disabling MST support (maybe called SST mode?).  If so that might just be your golden ticket.\nIf that doesn't work, try running it over DisplayPort in a Windows BootCamp partition with the latest AMD graphics driver.  If it can work at all then Windows will be able to do it because the drivers are supplied directly by ATI/AMD and BootCamp Windows does not have to worry about graphics switching with the Intel HD graphics controller.\nIf you can't turn off MST support and it works in Windows fine, then then it might still be possible to use that screen over DP in OS X.  Apple advertised that the new Retina MacBook Pros could support 4K displays but caused kind of a stink because only some 4K displays actually worked (and even then, only at 30Hz refresh instead of the usual 60).  This was due to the lack of driver support in OS X for MST streams.\nThey fixed that as of the Mavericks 10.9.3 update.  HOWEVER, that fix is only reported to apply to 2013 Mac Pros and Retina-display MacBook Pros.  I'd bet you a sandwich that they didn't backport that fix to earlier models.\nSo here's the bottom line:\n\n\n*\n\n*IF the MiniDP port on the 2011 MacBook Pro is DisplayPort 1.2,\n-- and --\n\n*IF Apple backported the MST fix to non-retina MBP models\n-- OR -- \n\n*You can disable MST mode on your display,\n-- Then --\nYou might be able to use that display the way you want.\n\n\nThere are a lot of ifs there.  If none of those things is true, then you may well be screwed.\n", "Q: What happened to Apple made server racks? Simply the question is, what happened to the the Apple made server racks?

I wanted to single-boot Linux, so I made a bootable USB Gentoo install, which I booted with the help of rEFIT (installed on my OS X) and used gdisk to wipe my hard drive and write a new partition table. Yes, I realize that removing OS X was risky and stubborn.\nBut I accidentally shut down my computer without configuring the bootloader.\nNow I can't boot my computer because there's no bootloader. I put Ubuntu on a USB flash drive (MBR format, FAT filesystem), but the computer doesn't recognize it as bootable.\nI can't use the CD/DVD drive either, because a blank CD is already in there.

Unless you want 2 internal SSDs, you would be wasting $200. I assume that if you're hosting other websites then you would be using external Thunderbolt or USB drives for storage space, so it would make sense just to have the 256GB SSD. \n", "Q: How to fix iPhone 3 showing iTunes-icon after charging?

Also, Activity Monitor stays within normal parameters. I hope it stays that way and works. For it is an easy and free tip for non-technical Mac users.\nFound that out an hour ago but  looks promising.\nGoodluck \n\nA: I had this same issue. I went into Security & Privacy System Preference, just to look at what Spotlight was including. I checked one thing off and then back on again and it immediately stopped. Mine was using almost 100% CPU power and my fans were running nonstop. It all stopped after I did this and I have no idea why. I have a Mid 2012 MacBook Pro.\n\nA: This was driving me insane, Task Manager was recording 50-500mb/sec read operations while computer was idle, and I narrowed it down to MDS.\ntldr; Summary steps:\n\n*\n\n*Add all folders (including hidden) under Macintosh HD to Spotlight exclusion.\n\n*Remove Applications and Users folder, and anything else you need.\n\nHere were my steps to diagnose this as the problem:\n\n\n*Open Activity Monitor in stable-state, see massive read/sec. Verify MDS has read/written the most bytes.\n\n*Open Spotlight in Settings\n\n*Drag in \"Macintosh HD\" to exclusions\n\n*Restart computer\n\n*Open Activity Monitor\n\n*Wait for steady-state, see read/sec down to <100kb (woohoo!).\n\nNow the tricky part -- have to figure out what in \"Macintosh Hd\" is causing the issue and exclude.\n\n*\n\n*Re-open Spotlight Settings\n\n*Clean up any exclusions that were noise in trying to figure this out, just leaving Macintosh HD and any others you know might be trouble-makers. For me I left: Shared, System, Unreal Engine, VirtualBox VMs\n\n*Click \"+\" to add an exclusion, and go into Macintosh HD.\n\n*IMPORTANT: Type cmd+shift+. to show hidden folders, which there should be many.\n\n*Select all (cmd+a) then \"Okay\". Might get a couple of errors, which seems fine.\n\n*Wait for steady-state and re-verify <100kb read/sec times.\n\n*Remove \"Macintosh HD\" from the list with (-) button.\n\n*Wait for steady-state and <100kb read/sec again. This took my computer ~2 minutes, presumably because it's indexing some of the folders which didn't make the exclusion list because of the errors. Press cmd+space to open spotlight, and enter some text like \"a\". Notice that right under the search bar, spotlight has a progress bar that says it's indexing even though it's only consuming <100kb/sec read (not consistent, sometimes takes 5 minutes to show up even after it starts). Not sure what's going on here, perhaps a bunch of very small files, but either way wait for it to finish. Once finished, it should go near almost 0 read/sec.\n\n*Remove added folders one-by-one, repeating the process of waiting for both the progress bar and disk read/sec to go to zero. My removals in order were: Applications, Users, Volumes, .vol, bin, etc, cores, tmp, Unreal Engine, VirtualBox, opt, Shared, sbin, etcetera. Took about an hour per added folder to get back to <100kb/sec read.

To test this, run the following in your terminal:\nsudo mdutil -a -i off\n\nthis turns off indexing of files, and should result in a clear slow down of the fans if mds and/or mds_stores are to blame.\nTo turn indexing back on, run\nsudo mdutil -a -i on\n\nAfter this you could run the complete re-indexing of your hard drive (be aware this could be an over night job), it will delete your Spotlight data base forcing it to start over.\nsudo rm -rf /System/Volumes/Data/.Spotlight-V100/*\n\nThe next and final step would be to add others to your (do not scan), privacy settings.\n\nA: I'm on Apple M1 and I don't have any external hard-drive connected.  I have a folder on desktop which includes all my NodeJS projects.

If you want to exclude folders or disks from being indexed using the UI, (as of macOS 10.15 Catalina) you can add them in System Preferences -> Spotlight -> Privacy\n\n\n\nA: After trying everything there is on the web and forums, and nothing worked - a smart guy (Lincoln Adams) on the Apple forum with the same issue, made a mind blowing discovery:\nIn his case (and mine, and maybe yours) - this was caused by the Pinterest button/extension in Firefox. Try closing Firefox, rebooting, and using another browser for a while.\nThe thread on Apple forums\n\nA: if figured out when running the command sudo mdutil -a -i off\nthat spotlight is trying to index a USB connected drive of one Terabyte. \nI disconnected it and restarted the computer.\n\nA: I had this problem and it persisted even after disabling spotlight search. ALthough I don’t have the pinterest extension mentioned above, I found that closing Firefox solved the issue.\n\nA: When you close Spotlight by clicking outside it retains the text you entered in the text box. Deleting the text calmed the process down. My advice is to click/tap Esc two times when you're done with Spotlight. The first click   clears the text box, the second one closes Spotlight.\n\nA: From what I know that number is not a 100% based usage, i.e. that 11.9 and 9.6 do not mean it takes up 11.9% and 9.6% of the whole CPU processing power.\nFor a dual core CPU, 10 in that column means it used up 10% of a core only, i.e. 5% of the whole CPU. \nSo for a 8 cores CPU, 100% usage of the whole CPU the number showed for a process should be 800 but not 100.\nI assume your mac is a dual core CPU, 11.9 and 9.6 in total is not costing as much as you thought. \nIt should works the same way as top command works in Linux\n\nA: You said, \"I have included many locations in the privacy settings of spotlight.\"\nYou need to include FEWER locations, not more. If you include more, that means Spotlight is keeping very busy looking at them all.\nYou can easily go to System Preferences/Spotlight to un-select many locations. Especially, un-select Mail, search engines, and other internet dependent options.\nShut down and restart after changing your Spotlight preferences. \n", "Q: Can only run AppleScript from Automator I have the following AppleScript which toggles the scroll direction on the trackpad:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    activate\n    set current pane to pane \"com.apple.preference.trackpad\"\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"System Preferences\"\n        click radio button \"Scroll & Zoom\" of tab group 1 of window \"Trackpad\"\n        click checkbox 1 of tab group 1 of window \"Trackpad\"\n    end tell\nend tell\n\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    quit\nend tell\n\nThis script runs without issues when the \"play\" button in Automator is used to execute it. However, when I make a service that runs it and assigned a keyboard shortcut to the service, it fails to run via the keyboard shortcut.\nWrapping it in a try block with some error reporting yields the following:\n\nAutomator Runner is not allowed assistive access.\nError number-1728\n\n\nI found Automator Runner.app and gave it assistive access using the instructions found here.\nIt now appears with a checked box in the list of applications with assistive access:\n\nHowever, the issue persists. I continue to get the same message notifying me that Automator Runner is not allowed assistive access. when trying to run the script using the keyboard command of the service that runs the script.\n\nUpdate\nI just succeeded at implementing this alternative script to accomplish the same thing, but it also only works when Automator has focus and has the same issue when it does not:\ntell application \"System Preferences\"\n    reveal anchor \"trackpadTab\" of pane \"com.apple.preference.trackpad\"\nend tell\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\"\n    click checkbox 1 of tab group 1 of window 1\nend tell\nquit application \"System Preferences\"\n\n\nA: \nImportant note regarding AppleScript actions in Automator workflows.Hopefully this helps others who are looking for a fix.\n\nAssistive Access\nIf your script uses things like tell application \"System Events\" to get UI data from app windows or send virtual keystrokes, etc, then it'll require \"assistive access\".\nThis may be called different things in different versions of Mac OS, but can generally be found in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility, under \"Allow the apps below to control your computer\".\nEnabling assistive access for the Automator and Script Editor applications will allow your workflows and scripts to run from those tools, but not when saved as standalone apps. In theory, enabling access for any app should also let it talk to System Events.\nProblem with AppleScripts run from Automator Actions\nBut as many have discovered, Automator often has issues creating apps that can be granted assistive access, when such apps contain AppleScript code. Not to mention the fact that services cannot be granted such permissions at all, since they aren't apps.\nWorkaround\nHowever, you can build standalone AppleScript apps from the Script Editor application instead, and grant them assistive access without issue.\nYou can then run such apps as part of an Automator or shell workflow, like this:\nAppleScript action in Automator\ndo shell script \"osascript -e 'tell application \\\"My Granted App Name\\\" to activate'\"\n\nShell Script\n(can also be from an Automator action)\nosascript -e 'tell application \"My Granted App Name\" to activate'\n\nThis also works for creating services in Automator. Just have your service run the permission-granted app, rather than trying to add permission-requiring code to the service itself.\nNote that the tell app call doesn't require the \".app\" extension, or even a path. If you have many apps with the same name, there should be a way to get the app by its bundle identifier, etc.\nOther IDEs\nI'm not sure if this is a problem specific to Automator, since I haven't tried calling fancy AppleScripts from apps built with tools other than that and Script Editor. Either way, the above should work for other IDEs/compilers/etc. as well.\nRe-Building your App\nIn most cases, editing and re-building a granted app requires it be re-granted access. So it helps to test everything well in Automator/Script Editor before you build the standalone app, to save you the trouble. If your script is called by a larger project you routinely recompile, it's best to turn that script into its own app to grant it access once, and run the app from your larger project. At least until the larger project is finalized.\nFor apps used by multiple scripts, you could keep them in a consistent spot like a custom /Applications/Tools/Scripts folder. However, remember that any third-party code can launch apps and thus activate your potentially sensitive scripts. It's important to consider security implications when creating code that using assistive access.\nWhen Re-Granting Doesn't Work\nThere are times when re-granting a rebuilt app doesn't \"take\". In such cases, renaming the app and re-adding it via System Preferences usually solves this. You should be able to re-name the app back to its original at a later time. This is a bug with how Assistive Access caches its list of apps, and the filename and/or path are involved somehow. If anyone knows how to clear this cache, please add a comment; it would be very helpful.\n\nA: I suspect you may not really have a problem that could be \"debugged\".\nRead this Guide from macosxautomation.com on how to have applets that don't permanently keep their \"permission\" to run, be accepted by Mac OS X.   \nTrick is to install a special ResourceRules-ignoring-Scripts.plist that you sign and register your app(let) into. (But read the WARNING on this web page!)\nReason is, some apps save information \"into themselves\" and therefore won't be identical/ recognized next time they run.\n(But anyway: even if the Guide's advice does NOT help you, it still might be of interest to others  ...)\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but I was facing this issue just now and I managed to work around it, so I thought I would post an answer.\nI'd read elsewhere that adding Automator Runner.app to the Privacy/Accessibility pane of System Preferences would not prevent the error, so I didn't try it, but what did work for me was pasting the entire workflow into a new \"Application\" workflow document.  I saved that in the same location as the service and then I created a new \"Service\" workflow that only did 1 thing: run the new application I had just created.\nI then added that application to the Privacy/Accessibility pane of System Preferences.  Now, when I run the service, I do not get the permissions error.\n\nA: Not an answer, but...\nTo attempt to debug, I would deconstruct the script to its components, so roughly split to only \ntell application \"System Preferences\"\nactivate\nset current pane to pane \"com.apple.preference.trackpad\"\nend tell\n\n& test for any error\nThen add \ntell application \"System Events\"\n    tell process \"System Preferences\"\n         click radio button \"Scroll & Zoom\" of tab group 1 of window \"Trackpad\"\n    end tell\nend tell\n\ncheck again\n& onward until you find the fail point\nOne possibility would be to reverse sys events & sys prefs in your current running order, but that's just a shot in the dark.\nHopefully, someone with better applescript chops than I will provide a better solution.\n\nA: When working on https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/436069/53510, I ran into this problem.\nFor me, the (partial, imperfect) solution seems to be:\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility\n\n*Add your most frequently-used apps (the ones that are likely to be active and \"focused\" on when you're pressing the keyboard shortcut or otherwise triggering a Service.\n\n*Quit and re-open each of those apps.\n\n*Try triggering your Service again (such as via keyboard shortcut).\n\n*Notice where it gets blocked (such as in my case, the System Preferences window was opened but not visible, so I clicked the icon in the Dock)\n\n*See the dialog box asking for elevated permissions, and grant them.\n\n\nA: I Found the Solution!!!\nI found the best way to avoid this error is to use + sign and add application that way first.\nThen try run it. (I.e don’t try run it first. I.e. don’t drag and drop in there first.)\nAs a last resort fix: open system preferences. Remove the app with minus. Lock. Quit system preferences. Reopen system preferences. Add app with plus sign. Lock. Quit system preferences. Then try run app. Take your time with each of these steps...don't rush it. Still not working. You can mix in a restart and some log out log ins...it will eventually work...sounds like madness I know...but it works.\nMonterey 12.4.\nThanks to SIMCC\n", "Q: Sending Control+Alt+  to terminal in iTerm2 When I press Control + Command + i I would like iTerm2 to send the shortcut as C-M-i (i.e. ctrl+alt+i) to my terminal.\nI have\nHow can I do that?\nI have tried with the following with no luck:\n\nAny thoughts on how to get this to work?\nUpdate:\nI read the following here:\n\nTo have iTerm2 send \"C-M-Space\" to the terminal:\n1) Open: Preferences > Profiles > some session you wish to edit > Keys.\n2) Add a new key binding by pressing the \"+\" button.\n3) Select the \"Keyboard Shortcut\" field, and press ctrl + option + space.\n4) Select \"Send Hex Code\" in the \"Action\" list.\n5) Type \"0x1b 0x00\" to the field below the list.\n6) Click OK and close the preferences window.\n\n\nI wonder if I can follow the same approach for my problem. How do I find out which Hex Code I need to send for Control+Command+i?\nUpdate 2\nAfter reading this thread, I installed Key Codes and found the following info for Control + Command + i. What specifically am I supposed to enter as a hex codein iTerm2 for this to work?\n                                \n\nA: I finally sorted out the various issues to come up with a solution.  The problem seems to be that if the Control key is part of the keyboard shortcut  then no other modifier keys that are also pressed will change the code that is sent by that keypress.  If Control + i produces the ^i (tab) character then adding more modifiers to the shortcut will still produce the same ^i code, at least when using iTerm2.  This may be occurring at the OSX level or perhaps at the Unix level where a termcap table handles the translation of \"terminal keys\" to \"output codes.\" It can be observed with iTerm2 by using \"cat -v\" or \"vis -o\" to see the output being generated and is also seen when using Key Codes (without iTerm2 running) which makes OSX the more likely culprit. That conclusion is supported by noting that the general user is not able to redefine certain keyboard shortcuts (without difficulty) that are reserved for basic OSX functions (such as Command-Tab for program switching).\nIt is possible to programmatically differentiate any set of modifiers pressed with a character key but those modifier flags are accessible programmatically within OSX and by a totally unique set of codes for every different set of keys pressed. To witness this, use Key Codes and while holding the Control key and pressing a character key and then doing the same while pressing additional modifier keys at the same time, note that it is always the same character code that is produced. Yet Key Codes has access to the various keys being held and is able to display them to us in the \"modifier\" field that it reveals. And, if iTerm2 could only see the standard codes produced from various key presses and not also see the modifier flags then iTerm2 itself wouldn’t be able to define the range of shortcut keys that it is actually able to define.  On the other hand, after identifying each set differently modified keys in a unique manner, iTerm2 appears to pass it’s generated codes to OSX where they are handled in the same way as if they’d been keyed on a keyboard, resulting in identical output for groups distinguishable keystrokes.  So, for example, iTerm2 may pass the unique Control + Alt + i determined code(s) out for the use of tmux but OSX takes them and tosses out a few details before delivery, making the code appear to be just ^i when it finally arrives for tmux to handle. The shortcut binding in tmux expects to receive the code we thought we were sending but along the way OSX has removed the information about the Alt (Meta) key, the same as it would do if the keyboard shortcut had been typed on a keyboard.\nThe solution is to find a key combination that won’t be used for something else and that can be transmitted without being changed to another key combination that you do want to use. That’s where Key Codes is useful since it let's you test many key  combinations and find what the key presses are translated to be \"unique enough.\"  Here’s the process I used to make it work for me:\nGoal: Running tmux in iTerm2, I want to be able to press Command-Control-i and have tmux execute the \"select-pane -U\"command.\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose an esoteric key press that you won’t be using. Consider a multi-key sequence with the tmux escape character followed by another unusual key press making it much less likely to be needed.  I’m choosing to send the standard tmux escape character (0x02 = ^b) followed by the ansi code sequence for F1 (0x1b 0x4f 0x50).  Good keys to look at are the less used characters generated on a Mac by holding down Alt (Option) and Shift with another character key.\n\n*Within iTerm2 open Preferences and define the Command+Control+i shortcut in either the global key shortcuts or as a keyboard shortcut for a specific profile.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the + button to add a new shortcut. \n\n*Click in the Keyboard Shortcut field and hold down the Command and Control keys while you press the \"i\" key.\n\n*Use the mouse to select \"Send Hex Code\" in the Action drop-down. (Trying to use Tab to leave the Shortcut field will change the value for the shortcut.)\n\n*Type the string \"0x02 0x1b 0x4f 0x50\" (without the quotes and assuming that you are using the default tmux escape character, ^b = 0x02).\n\n*Press the OK button to commit your shortcut. Close Preferences.\n\n\n*Within iTerm2, invoke a tmux session and define the key binding for the codes iTerm2 will send.\n\n\n*\n\n*Invoke tmux as you normally would.\n\n*In the tmux window type the command: \"tmux bind-key F1 select-pane -U\" (without the quotes.)\n\n\n\nTest it by splitting your tmux window into several appropriate panes and try using Command+Control+i to move through panes vertically. If successful, you'll probably want to record your key-binding with the start-up bindings invoked by tmux on startup.\nThis method worked fine for me and should work well unless you have somehow used all the possible keyboard combinations for other uses.  Methods like this one combined with practice and experience guessing the inner workings of a system should can help work around situations like this one that may feel foreign and overwhelming. Some parts of the above explanation are reasonable guesses as to what is occurring or that may assign blame to the wrong process but I hope that it’s helpful as a guide to how problems like this can be approached with less than a complete understanding of the whole system. \n\nA: The easiest method to send key-combinations to terminal is to activate +Esc is Key setting.\niTerm2 > Preferences > Profile > Keys > change \"option key acts\" from normal to +Esc\n\nA: (The theory is in the following 3 paragraphs and the best guess answer is developed in the remainder of this long winded explanation. The spoiler is our educated guess of 0x89 as the answer to the given question. If not then you'll probably need to read much of the rest and do some searching on your own to see exactly what you should send and how. I do hope this helps.)\nTo sort this out the first thing is to realize that C-M-i is not the same as Control + Command + I except when (in a specific context such as an OS or a program) the Command key is set to be the Meta key. In iTerm the choices for the Meta key are one or the other of the Option (Alt) keys. In iTerm one can't speak of the Command key as the Meta key although it's possible to capture the Command key press by defining it as an iTerm keyboard shortcut. So what does it mean in iTerm to press Control + Command + i? It's not defined; it sends no visible or invisible characters at all. (This is best seen by invoking cat -v, vis -o or another program that will visibly display invisible codes and trying various keystrokes.)\\\nBut the idea of pressing C-M-i is somewhat defined and often including the Meta key with another key combination is equivalent to pressing the ESCape key followed by the same key combination. That appears to be what you were trying to do by setting a key to output the escape sequence: ESC + ^i. If that didn't work then we need to know what string of characters/bytes is actually wanted by whatever program you are trying to control. Following the example you pointed to I created a hex sequence of 0x1B 0x09 which produced the same output as your ESC sequence. (Hex 1B or 0x1B = Binary 000110111 = Octal 033 or \\033 = Decimal 27…value of 27 not 2 followed by 7; after a while these particular numbers all start to mean ESCape character when one sees them.)\nNow, Key Codes was a good try being the same sort of idea as using cat or vis to visualize the characters that get sent. The problem is that Key Codes is not running within iTerm but is running within OS X. One could say the Command key is OS X's Meta key but that train of thought isn't useful since OS X defines the function of its Meta key quite differently from how iTerm defines its Meta key. If you go into Key Codes and try pressing Control + i with and without the Command key you'll see that the difference is in the resulting modifiers; but the modifiers are internal flags within OS X that OS X creates by examining what keys are pressed. The actual output code is closest to the Unicode character shown (0x09) and you'll see that both with and without the Command key you receive the same character. But that's illusory anyway since what actually happens is that OS X gets the Key Code and the Modifers values and interprets those codes as it wants. Control + i comes closest to \"sending\" a ^i but add the Command key and, if the Finder is the receiving the results, you get one of the various Get Info commands; another program may interpret it as it likes. It's turtles on turtles on turtles all the way down, i.e., what you begin with may end up doing many different things depending on what is re-interpreting what, and so on.\nNow I have to try to give you an answer that will work for you, but the preceding was necessary to show why I can't say for sure. But I can make an educated guess. First, the context is iTerm and I assume you are running a program in iTerm that does something in response to what is said to be C-M-i. If, in iTerm I set one Option/Alt key to be the Meta key and then press that key with the ^i keys we will expect that we will get what we want to happen to happen. So let's find out what gets sent by doing that. If you use Key Caps it won't say anything different since you're back outside of iTerm. But when I use the cat -v command which does it's best to make the invisible visible on the screen and press C-M-i, then along with a strange diamond shape character I get the string M-^i which seems to be a way to say M-C-i. That looks good.\nNow I get out of the cat program and go to the vis -o program which will try to give me some octal values for some of the invisible characters. Now pressing C-M-i gives me an octal value (after pressing return) of \\211 as well as that funny diamond. (Octal 211 or \\211 = Binary 10001001 = Hex 89 or 0x89; which is encouraging since when I earlier turned on the Meta key in iTerm it gave me a warning a that Meta was usually used on older systems and new systems generally use the +ESC code sequence…back to where you started! I also have seen that what the Meta key often did was to output the ASCII 7-bit printable character with its high-order bit (leftmost bit usually set to zero) set to 1. If you strip the leftmost 1 from the binary coding of what we received you're left with a 1001 binary = Decimal 9! 9 is the character that pressing ^i \"sends out.\" That looks good.\nJust to go full circle and check it out further I can go back to iTerm, make sure I've turned off my Meta key options (just in case) and define a new keyboard shortcut to some key that sends a 0x89 (Hex 89). Then open a new window so that the changes are active and press the key you assigned the 0x89 with vis -o running to interpret your characters. Out comes the same funny diamond shape and the octal string \\211. So it appears we have set up a shortcut key to produce C-M-i to the best of what we know.\nWhether that key will do what you want depends on whether the program that wants that keyboard code handles what we gave it. Not knowing more this is a best educated guess. If it fails then it's necessary to delve further into the end program that is being controlled [I'd venture Emacs but, hey, I use vi so what do I know ;-] Hopefully some of the techniques and ideas presented here would help you determine how to send the correct codes once you found them. I hope that this works for you. Note that without all the fuss you can get a pretty good idea that it will or won't work by turning on a Meta key in iTerm and pressing C-M-i to see if that works; if so then proceed to define your shortcut key.\n", "Q: Free space on my jailbroken iOS device is rapidly declining -- how do I figure out why?

It runs up to iOS 6.x. At one point I installed various Apple apps like Find My Phone/Friends.\nI recently wiped it and set it up for wifey to use.

I'm attempting to change the settings of a Cisco IPSec VPN connection which was set up through OSX's built in VPN client in system preferences. The VPN functions as expected, allowing me to access protected servers at my company. I would like to access other websites on the internet through this VPN (youtube, wikipedia, whatever). As far as I can tell, my regular web browsing is not being directed through the VPN.\nThis apple support page says there is a setting called \"Send all traffic over VPN connection\" which can be enabled through the Apple menu > System Preferences > Network > Advanced > Options dialogue. However, when I select the VPN from the network interface list and click the \"Advanced...\" button, there is no \"Options\" tab or button. I see a dialogue with two tabs, \"DNS\" and \"Proxies\".

(I'm using OS X's built-in cisco client, not the Cisco branded client.)\nsudo route -nv add -net 10 -interface utun0\nsudo route change default 192.168.0.1\n\nReplace \"10\" in the first command with the network that's on the other side of the tunnel.\nReplace \"192.168.0.1\" with your local network's gateway.\nI put it into a bash script, like this:\n$ cat vpn.sh \n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [[ $EUID -ne 0 ]]; then\n    echo \"Run this as root\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nroute -nv add -net 10 -interface utun0\nroute change default 192.168.0.1\n\nI also found an explanation on how to run this automatically when you connect the VPN, but it's late on Friday and I don't feel like trying it :)\nhttps://gist.github.com/675916\nEdit:\nI have since left the job where I was using the Cisco VPN, so this is from memory.\nThe \"10\" in the first command is the network that you want to route over the VPN. \"10\" is short hand for \"10.0.0.0/8\". In Tuan Anh Tran's case, it looks like the network is \"192.168.5.0/24\".\nAs for which gateway to specify in the second command, it should be your local gateway. When you log into a VPN that prevents split-tunneling, it is enforcing that policy by changing your routing tables so that all packets are routed on the virtual interface. So you want to change your default route back to what it was prior to getting on the VPN.\nThe easiest way to figure out the gateway is to run netstat -rn before logging into the VPN, and look at the IP address to the right of the \"default\" destination. For example, here's what it looks like on my box right now:\nInternet:\nDestination        Gateway            Flags        Refs      Use   Netif Expire\ndefault            10.0.1.1           UGSc           29        0     en1\n10.0.1/24          link#5             UCS             3        0     en1\n10.0.1.1           0:1e:52:xx:xx:xx   UHLWIi         55   520896     en1    481\n10.0.1.51          7c:c5:37:xx:xx:xx   UHLWIi          0     1083     en1    350\n10.0.1.52          127.0.0.1          UHS             0        0     lo0\n\nMy gateway is 10.0.1.1 -- it is to the right of the \"default\" destination.\n\nA: Cisco VPN servers normally send out a list of routes to private networks so you don't end up sending all of your traffic through the VPN server. To overcome this issue, you can try the suggestions here to migrate from CiscoVPN to the native OS X IPSec VPN by decrypting passwords saved in CiscoVPN PCF files or manually set up routing.\nHope it could help.\n", "Q: How to get rid of re-appearing Dropbox Finder Toolbar button? I'm on Mountain Lion 10.8.5 and have Dropbox 2.10.29 installed. For some reason I can't permanently remove the Dropbox button from the Finder toolbar.\nI can remove it temporarily using Customize Toolbar or Cmd+drag it from the toolbar, but as soon as I open a new Finder window it's back again.\nIf I quit Dropbox from the menubar and remove the button, the button stays gone even if I open another window. The moment I start Dropbox the button re-appears.\nHow can I permanently remove the button (pictured below on the right) from the Finder Toolbar?\n \nI've contacted Dropbox, but I thought I would check if somebody here would have a solution in the mean time as well.\n\nA: The following procedure works on OS X Yosemite (10.10) and may also work on earlier versions of OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on the toolbar and select the 'Customize Toolbar' menu item\n\n*After the toolbar customisation sheet appears you should see that the Dropbox icon immediately follows two 'Flexible Space' items in the toolbar: \n\n*Remove the Dropbox icon by dragging it from the toolbar, and then repeat this action for one of the two flexible space items: \n\n*Close and reopen the finder window\n\n\n\nNote: Disabling the Enable Finder integration option in Dropbox's preferences may remove the Dropbox icon from the Finder toolbar, however it also disables sync status icons and Dropbox contextual menu items from appearing.\n\nA: In Dropbox preferences, uncheck Enable Finder Integration\n\n", "Q: How to download and install Darwin 13 OS in x86? I've conducted a research on UNIX operating systems and found out that an experimental OS (Darwin) is used for development of the OSX; just like Fedora on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\nDarwin OS has a license of \"Apple Public Source License\" or freeware.\nDarwin OS can be installed on x86 computer architectures according to Wikipedia.\nI've searched all over the net and torrent sites but it seems that the links to recent versions of the OS like 13, 12, etc. are very hard to find.\nI've tried the site \"opensource.apple.com\" but the \"Download\" section could not be found. I think that the links are hidden.\n1) Where can I download a recent version of Darwin like 12, 11, or 10?

From their website:\n\nOne current goal of this project is to provide a useful bootable ISO of Darwin 10.x and Darwin 9.x.\n\nDarwin itself is a modified FreeBSD OS with Mach microkernel.\nNote though that having Darwin is not a necessary part of developing in Obj-C. Both gcc and clang support Obj-C development in newer versions.

I have a MacBook Pro from work. To keep my browsing history separate, I use 2 different browsers. (Chrome = Work, Safari = Fun)\nI want to make my default browser Chrome while at work (9 am to 6pm), and Safari my default browser in the evenings. This will prevent me from accidentally opening a link in the wrong browser.\nHow could I switch my default browser at predefined times throughout the day?\nUpdate\nThere does not appear to be a 'set default browser' workflow in automator. Perhaps it would be possible to edit this file?\n/Users/yourname/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist\n\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/2803775?tstart=0\n\nA: Not nearly as complicated, but perhaps of value, is the app Choosy. It allows you to choose your browser every time you open a link outside of a browser. While this might sound onerous, it's actually pretty transparent, and I find it very useful in the leadup to going live with a new web project and testing in multiple browsers over and over and over…\nMight suit the bill if one added keystroke isn't a problem. Of course, once you're inside Safari, links clicked will open in Safari (although there's even a way to modify this behavior.)\nFWIW.\nChoosy\n\nA: Expanding on my comment above....\n\nSee the comment by user kerma at this related StackFlow article \nHis little command line app at https://github.com/kerma/defaultbrowser does what you need.\nHe provided the source code but it was designed for 10.9. A small change can make it to compile on 10.6 as well. I tested it on my system and it worked correctly.\nAll you then need to do is run it like this...\n#defaultbrowser -set firefox\n\n#defaultbrowser -set safari\n\nThe changes I made, to make it work with 10.6,  were\na) Add the Cocoa framework\nb) Make the following code change...\nReplace \nNSString *split = HTTPHandlers[i];\n\nwith\nNSString *split = [HTTPHandlers objectAtIndex:i];\n\nEDIT:\nAs was pointed out, the code does not change the default browser for HTTPS. To add that functionality, I added the following lines... \nFind the first line below, and add the second one for https\nCFStringRef urlschemeref = ( CFStringRef)@\"http\";\nCFStringRef urlschemeref2 = ( CFStringRef)@\"https\";\n\nand the same here\nOSStatus s = LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme(urlschemeref, newHandler);\nOSStatus s2 = LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme(urlschemeref2, newHandler);\n\nFinally change\nif (s == 0) {\n\nto\nif (s == 0 && s2 == 0) {\n\nRegarding the scheduling, since they know what cron is, I assume they know how to make the necessary changes. If not, a google search would provide the necessary answers. So the cron lines would be...\n0 9 0 0 1-5 /path/to/app/defaultbrowser -set chrome\n0 18 0 0 1-5 /path/to/app/defaultbrowser -set safari\n\nBUT, a much better way, because cron tasks will not run when system is powered down, is to have a means to detect location (like wifi connection) and change according to that. So if the cron job is set at 9am and you arrive late to work, you powerup your device at 9:15am nothing will happen...\nSo, as discussed here, I would recommend that they install ControlPlane or something like it, and schedule the change upon connection to the  wifi/network instead.\nHope that helped.\n\nA: Based on Vic's answer, this is what I came up with. \nDownload defaultbrowser, create a cronjob to run at 9 am and 6pm. \nBecause there is no gui, it will require taking advantage of the fact that mac is unix. \nFirst checkout the source code of defaultbrowser, and copy it to /usr/local/bin\ngit clone https://github.com/kerma/defaultbrowser.git /tmp/defaultbrowser\nsudo cp /tmp/defaultbrowser/build/defaultbrowser /usr/local/bin/\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/defaultbrowser\n\nThen to schedule the binary to be run at specific times, run the following:\nEDITOR=NANO crontab -e\n\n0 9 * * 1-5 /usr/local/bin/defaultbrowser -set chrome >> /Users/sowen/defaultbrowser.log 2>&1 && echo $(date) >> /Users/sowen/defaultbrowser.log 2>&1\n0 18 * * 1-5 /usr/local/bin/defaultbrowser -set safari >> /Users/sowen/defaultbrowser.log 2>&1 && echo $(date) >> /Users/sowen/defaultbrowser.log 2>&1\n\nNow my browser will change at 9 am and 6pm on weekdays.   \nExplanation: \nEDITOR=NANO crontab -e edits the crontab file\n0 9 * * 1-5 means on days 1-5 (monday - friday), run the following command at 9:00\n/usr/local/bin/defaultbrowswer -set chrome sets the default browser\n>> /Users/sowen/defaultbrowser.log appends to a file I call defaultbrowser.log in my home directory\n2>&1 fancy syntax that sends both errors, and logs to the same place\n&& combines two commands into 1\necho $(date) >> /Users/sowen/defaultbrowser.log 2>&1 Adds a timestamp to the log file\nI had some problems creating the cronjob, I had to use nano based on this information. \nAlso, this could have been rewritten using launchd, however cron was easier. \n", "Q: Can someone point me to resources to reverse engineer ancient Mac software?

It managed to add a whole two, and in the process copied them to another location without my consent. I then created an alias to force iBooks to read from the appropriate location on an external drive. Such was the intent, in any case.\niTunes doesn't like it when ~/User/Music/iTunes/ is an alias. Automatic sorting of music goes one directory too high because of reasons. A stupid bug that was never fixed, and likely never will be. I can deal with that, but now I find that iBooks is completely broken in an identical scenario. Why should it care whether a directory is on the boot partition or a larger external drive?\nThe error in the title took a good five minutes to appear.

I prefer using free software but any solutions are welcome.\n\nA: So, after some tinkering, I was able to do it using Automator. I'd be very surprised if this is the most efficient way to do it, but you only need to create the workflow once.\nBasically, there's an \"Extract Odd & Even Pages\" action that you can use to split the file. Here's a list of the workflow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ask for finder items.\n\n*Extract odd and even pages (Odd)\n\n*Move finder items (this moves the extracted PDF to a folder you specify, must be empty; otherwise, it'll be in a temporary folder that's hard to find).\n\n*Ask for finder items (select the original file again; otherwise, Automator will continue processing the file created in Step 2).\n\n*Extract odd and even pages (Even)\n\n*Move finder items (same as 3)\n\n*Ask for confirmation: Basically, it's a way to pause the workflow while you crop the pdfs. This is optional, you could just create a separate workflow (if you don't already have one) to combine the pdfs, and execute that once you're done. Otherwise, the idea is that you click \"OK\" after cropping both PDFs.\n\n*Get folder contents/Ask for finder items: Point to the folder where the two separate PDFs are located (or select both, if you used \"Ask for finder items\").\n\n*Combine PDF pages: Shuffle option\n\n*Move finder items (wherever you want the output).\n\n\nThat's the general idea, there are some refinements that could be done, if not a complete 'rewrite' to make it more efficient.\n\nA: you just need a PDF edittor for mac, there are many apps can do that, if you only use it once for a while, just try with the free online options, if you need to do this often, just get a PDF editor for Mac.\n\nA: try Briss - cross-platform application for cropping PDF files\nA simple user interface lets you define exactly the crop-region by fitting a rectangle on the visually overlaid pages.\n\n\n*\n\n*Crop Odd Even pages seperately\n\n*Crop PDFs GUI based\n\n*Crop different regions into separate pages\n\n*Crop multi column/pages\n\n", "Q: Change from POP to IMAP I'm not receiving all my e mails on my ipad.

I've just had an Apple Wireless Keyboard returned to me.\n\nThe thing is, it appears the batteries have expires and gone all...crusty. I can take the end off and pull the first battery out, but the other one is pretty firmly stuck in. I've tried scraping a lot of the gunk off with a long, thin object, but I've got nowhere. I've also tried banging it a few times to loosen the battery up, to no luck.\nCan I crack this thing open and get the battery out, or do I face an interesting visit to an Apple store?\n\nA: this happened to me.  i had to use a curved pick to pierce the battery and pull it out.\nbut it wasn't so simple because not only was the battery swollen, but it was also chemically bonded after the alkali leak. i did eventually get it to work again, it did require some sanding and grinding after.\ngood luck\n", "Q: iWork'08 sumifs equivalent in Numbers Does iWork '08 have a sumifs type command?

Essentially how do I fo the following:\n=sumifs(A$2:A$20,B$2:B$20,\"<10\",C$2:C$20,\"female)\n\nmany thanks!\n\nA: Numbers 09 has the SUMIFS function, which operates the same as in Excel. Numbers 08 does not appear to have it, but it has SUMIF.\nYou should still be able to do what you are trying by combining two logical statements.\nWithout using the function, you could also build a new column by multiplying values by a logical statement. For example:\n=A3 + A4 × (B4>2) \n\nThis will only add A4 if B4 is greater than 2...\nOr in your example, make a column using AND:\n=A2 x AND(B2<10,exact(C2,\"female))\n\nThen sum that column. Values that don't meet both criteria will be zero.\n", "Q: How can unauthorized movie purchases be made on my 1st generation Apple TV? In the last 6 months, two movies have shown up as purchased on my 1st Generation Apple TV, but neither I nor my wife have purchased them.\nThe first time this happened, I thought perhaps it had been done accidentally by my wife previewing a movie, then accidentally hitting the purchase button.\nThe second time this happened was last night when we were watching Monday Night Football. We were both sitting on the sofa and the AppleTV was NOT accessed by us. \nOur ATV1 is a refurbished 160GB AppleTV purchased directly from Apple with the latest software version [3.0.2]. I run ethernet from a Netgear WNDR-3700 router to the AppleTV. Password has been changed from default on the router. I have disabled the guest networks (yes this router has two guest networks) on the router, but do run WiFi for the windows computers and three local Apple devices (2 phones, 1 iPad 2nd gen).\nThe first time this happened, I enabled two-step verification on my Apple ID. Strangely, I get the two-step challenge ONLY when I sign-in from my Chrome Browser on the AppleID site, [ https://appleid.apple.com/account/home ].\nCan anyone tell me how unauthorized purchases could be made on my AppleTV without my knowledge? \nFurther, can anyone tell me how to lock down my network and 1st gen  AppleTV so that unauthorized purchases can't be made?\n\nA: I know this is a month old, but check your ir remote. My Fios remote is programmed to control my Apple TV. If the Apple TV is on, the remote may be triggering the purchases when you use the up, down and menu keys on it. Since you are watching another show through a different input, you won't even notice it until you get the bill. \nReprogram the universal remote or tuck the Apple TV where the IR signal can't SE it. \n\nA: THANK YOU !! to everyone who tried to help. Never got an adequate answer to this question. I enabled two step verification with Apple and have had no errant charges since. Everyone has made the assumption that the purchase came from within my own home, but I have seen enough to know the Apple ID system and charges to Apple IDs are by no means perfect. My suggestion to all - enable two step verification on your Apple ID.\n", "Q: Prevent Spotify using 3G on iPhone On the Spotify iPhone app, there is a manual setting to turn offline mode on or off.

So fans don't seem to be the problem.\n\nA: It is not normal to have computer overheating to the point of shutting down.\nYou can look up in your Activity monitor to see who is consuming CPU.\nPossible problems:\nYou cooling fan is not working at all or sporadic.\nYour SMC (that controls the fan) needs to be rested.\nFollow the instructions here based on your model to reset SMC.\nYou can also download the Intel Power app that will tell you what your CPU is doing.\nThe CPU is the single highest source of heat generation followed by GPU.\nHowever, sometimes (rarely) the battery can do that due to the edit currents (internal) that will heat it up. Check you battery status and condition.\n\nA: It looks like my computer is running cooler after a few shutdown restart cycles.

I sent a text message to (123) 456-7890 and an error message immediately appeared to \"use a valid 10-digit phone number\" and showed the number I used with a 1 before the area code. I tried deleting the contact's number and re-entering it, but the same thing happened. Why is the phone adding a 1? I've searched through settings (and I did turn off international dialing help to no avail). Is this a setting issue or...?\n\nA: The US telephone system use a #1 in front of USA area codes.\nIf you with in the same area then you do not need to dial it.\nEven if you dial '1 in local calls it will be just ignored.\nYou phone automatically adds a #1 anyway so you do not forget it.\nHowever if you are outside the area then #1 is needed in front of the number.\nIn modern days devices the #1 is hidden but it is dialed automatically.\n\nA: I was just able to duplicate this behavior sending a text to a number not in service. \nThe exact error message arrives as a text message from a network number and reads \"1XXXYYYZZZZ Error Invalid Number.

Instructions said that I would find the album in my library with an iCloud icon indicating the album was in the cloud and I just needed to click that icon to download the album. But the in-the-cloud-album was nowhere to be found in my library.\n\n\nI updated iTunes to the most recent version to validate that it wasn't a problem with the version I had.\nFinally I was able to download the album in the iTunes Store app in my iPod touch. It was in more->purchased->Music->Various with an download button. I downloaded my gift. And I could play the tracks with wi-fi off, proving that the tracks were were in fact downloaded to the iPod.\nBut when I synced (several times) the iPod with my iTunes library, the album fails to appear in my Library, and only exist in my iPod.\nThe questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Has someone experience this problem ?\n\n*Is it made that way on purpose so the free-album could only be played on iDevices and not in the Mac/PC ?\n\n*Is this a bug ?\n\n*How could I get around this in order to have the album in my music library in my Mac ?\n\n*How do I get the PDF booklet I'm supposed to get with the album ?\n\n\nEdit after accepted answer: \nWrong instructions leading to my confusion\n\nLiteral translation: Simply go to the Music app in your iOS device or to your music library in your Mac or PC and find Songs of Innocence in the Album or Artist tab.

As far as I know, to terminate hands-free voice dictation mode one must use their hands -- either by clicking 'Done', or by pressing Command + D.\nHowever, pressing Command + D also executes the application shortcut associated with that key combination. (eg, in a web browser you trade your dictation dialog for a bookmark dialog)\nHow can I end dictation mode using my voice?\nIs there an official way to exit dictation without using a mouse?\nIs there a way to return to Speech Commands once I've successfully used Speech Commands to start dictation mode?

It then stopped playing and the ((•)) symbol appears to the left of the song title.\nWhat does this mean, and how can I get may song playing again?\n\nA: That symbol indicates the \"song\" is an online stream rather than a file downloaded to your computer. This happens if you add a URL to your library rather than downloading the file and adding that.\nSo you must have been streaming the song each time you played it and now the stream has been turned off.

I am using BetterTouchTool to add more gestures for my Mac. I want three fingers swipes to move me back through the previous apps that I have open. Currently, I am setting the gesture to Cmd-Tab. Unfortunately this cycles me through the last two apps. I want to be able to swipe twice to go back two apps. How can I add this ability to BetterTouchTool?\n\nA: Here are two options. They both solve your general question (how to use swipes to cycle through previous apps), but not your particular use case (use two consecutive swipes to get to your second-from-last used app). I've also thrown in a bonus option, which I personally use, due to the limitations of the first two options. \n1) via Keyboard Maestro\nIn KM, open up the Macro Library (in the Window Menu). Under the \"Application Control\" category, you'll find \"Switch to Last Application\" and \"Switch to Next Application\". The second one will cycle you through apps in one direction: from right to left in the list that appears when you press CMD-Tab. Give this macro a hotkey trigger and tie it to three-finger swipe with BTT. \nDownside: Because \"Switch to Last Application\" only switches between the last two active applications, and \"Switch to Next Application\" cycles through all applications in one direction only, you are effectively limited to one-way cycling through apps. And because it cycles from right to left in the CMD-Tab list (rather than from left to right), you won't be able to swipe twice to get to your second-from-last used app. (Inspect the order of the CMD-Tab list to see what I mean.)\n2) via the Dock\nIn the Keyboard Preferences Pane, under the Shortcuts tab, and within the Keyboard category, enable \"Move focus to the Dock\". Give it a hotkey. Then use BTT to trigger this hotkey with Three Finger Swipe Left, and attach two additional actions: arrow left, return. Make another BTT trigger for Three Finger Swipe Right, and for this one have your additional actions be arrow right, return.\nDownsides: This method switches between apps according to their order in the dock, rather than according to how recently you've used them. So again, you won't be able to swipe twice to get directly to your second-from-last used app. Also, this solution is not as smooth as the first. You may need to add pauses between keystrokes in BTT, especially if you keep your dock hidden. \n3) Bonus option! (Because I don't think there's a way to perfectly accomplish what you're asking for -- I've tried many times.)\nI like to keep Three Finger Swipe Right and Three Finger Swipe Left both tied to CMD-Tab. It's a redundant but logical way to switch back and forth between your two most recent apps. Then I tie Three Finger Tap to a Keyboard Maestro hotkey which executes the \"Activate Application Switcher\" action. I have it display the switcher as horizontal icons, sorted by use order, and positioned under the mouse curser. This basically puts a smaller version of the CMD-Tab list directly under my cursor. It makes it quite easy to switch between apps using three finger swipes and taps. \n\nA: If you don't mind adding a modifier key to the gesture. Hold the key, say CMD, and swipe twice.\n\nA: My partial solution: I have a gesture attached to Cmd-Tab and a second one for Application Switcher. When I activate that, all the open apps pop up and I can use a 2-finger sideways scroll to select one and release to activate it. It's a little tricky to select the right one sometimes because it scrolls a little too fast, but it's the best I've figured out so far. I wish it were easier!\n", "Q: Can I turn off 2G support on my iPhone? From the commotion in the last several days/weeks I understood that a fake cell tower intending to play man-in-the-middle uses a 2G connection to avoid the authentication requirement (of the network towards the phone) that's part of 3G and up.I would like to avoid such MITM attacks by turning off the 2G support altogether. I can live with it if my iPhone only uses 3G/4G, and refuses any service when only 2G is available.I am using an iPhone 5S with IOS7.Is there any setting or app I can use for that? (Preferably without jail-breaking my phone, but I know that might be a stretch.)\nJohan\n\nA: Very simple; No way Apple will allow you to do this\n", "Q: How does the iPhone 5 measure elevation? I use an app called MapMyRun on the iPhone 5. In it is a report that shows elevation changes during the run. \n\nNow to my knowledge, the iPhone5 has an accelerometer and GPS+. \nThe iPhone5 has no barometer or other way to measure elevation. \nMy question is - how does the iPhone5 measure elevation? \n\nA: Measurements are done using the GPS. \nINFO: http://gpsinformation.net/main/altitude.htm\n\nGPS altitude measures the users' distance from the center of the SVs orbits. These measurements are referenced to geodetic altitude or ellipsoidal altitude in some GPS equipment.\n\n\nA: GPS calculations have to be done in three dimensions so your approximate elevation is always known while GPS is active.\nHowever, accuracy is usually too poor to be useful so most services cross reference your location against online mapping data to get the elevation data for that point. This works a lot better most of the time but can lead to anomalies at bridges, tall buildings, cliffs, etc.\n", "Q: Is the iPhone 6 waterproof or water-resistant? Before the iPhone 6 was officially announced by Apple, several reports claimed that the device will be waterproof.\nHowever, the announcement and specifications on Apple's site make no mention of it.\nIt would seem clear that the device is not waterproof, but has this been specifically reported or verified after the announcement?\n\nA: The iPhone 6 is neither waterproof nor water-resistant as marketed by Apple. Though tech journalists have found that the iPhone 6S is semi-water resistant, Only the iPhone 7 is currently certified as being water-resistant.\n", "Q: Implement a large email archive on a Macbook Pro 13\" I have a large email archive that I need to make accessible on my Macbook. The archive is currently in a Microsoft Outlook PST file from a Windows machine. I'm aware of tools like O2M to convert it to a file format suitable for a Mac client. The PST file is 14GB in size. My Macbook Pro is a 16GB model with the top-end CPU.\nBut my question is, what client is best suited to provide access to an archive of this size, and what file format is best used behind it? It's obviously a very large archive and I would not be surprised if Mail was not able to cope. I would prefer to avoid running a mail server on my machine to keep ongoing maintenance simple. Something that integrates with Spotlight would be a bonus.\n\nA: It really depends on what you're looking to optimize for, effort to implement or $$$ spent:\n1) You could spring for Outlook for Mac which will know how to import your PST and will also make its contents indexable for spotlight.  Downsides include the $$$ and the memory overhead involved in launching Outlook when you want to get into the details of an old email you were looking for.\n2) Use some conversion tool to get those emails into Apple Mail.  It will handle the quantity just fine (at least it does for my slightly smaller ~10G archive).  Spotlight integration is obvious here, but you also get quick view support when you use spotlight from a finder window.\n", "Q: How do I completely uninstall an app in OS X without the use of a dedicated app eg AppZapper? I came across this post, however all the answers recommend using Applications eg AppZapper or similar to achieve the uninstallation of the App desired.\nWhat are the steps required where the uninstallation is carried out by \"manual means\" by the user to achieve complete uninstallation ?\n\nA: In general most programs place files within the App icon, which is really a special folder for the Applications files. Many also add files within the Application Support folder within your library. \nSimply drag the Application icon to the trash, and empty it. Then open your Library folder (you might have to click on the \"Go\" menu item in Finder, while also holding down he Option key to expose the Library). Look under the Application Support folder, and see if your Application has a folder, which you may also trash. You can also do a general search in this folder for the App name or Software company name.\nOf course some apps also put other files in other places, such as LaunchAgents, PreferencePanes and other folders, but that is where such apps as AppZapper and AppCleaner are very nice to have. Also, check the Application website, as often software vendors publish the details of where they install data within OSX, usually in an item called 'manual uninstall'.\n\nA: Without using any external tools:\nThe Apple way-->move to trash and you are done.\nThat can leave residue but not very relevant files.\nSome app come with uninstaller (since they files are intertwined in the OS.\nSome app you open the \"Show Package Content\" so you see what came with the package.\n\n\n*\n\n*Not so recommended methods (you could make a fatal mistake)- the Terminal!\n\n\nYou could drill down using terminal and find residues using the \"mdfind\".\nYou could drill in to the System Library and delete manually.\nIt’s dangerously easy to delete files with the rm command do not use unless you are 101% sure, it can not be reversed.\n\nA: There are several steps you may want to take:\n\n\n*\n\n*remove any support files in /Library\n\n*remove any support files in ~/Library\n\n*remove any installed kernel extensions\n\n*remove any cache files left in /LibraryCaches\n\n*remove any cache files left in ~/LibraryCaches\n\n*Generically: remove any file created by the application at installation or during its run time.\n\n\nTo answer the question I think you want answered: there is no built-in facility to remove all traces of an app that you wish to uninstall (which is why programs like AppZapper exist at all).\n\nA: Simply delete the application from the list of applications. There is no \"uninstall\" like Windows. \n", "Q: Time machine/capsule read-only error I just got a new logic board installed on my Macbook Air (running OS X 10.9.4). Before the repair, I used a time capsule for backup (which has plenty of storage left). When my newly repaired MBA came home from the shop and tried to complete a time machine backup to the capsule, a message popped up that asked if I wanted to restore my previous backups. I selected that option, but it did not complete the backup and now I get an error message that says, \"time machine cannot complete the backup because the disk is read only\". I performed some simple troubleshooting (i.e., turned time machine off and unplugged the capsule), but no luck. \nI read on the Apple support page that I should try mounting the time capsule to my desktop and ejecting it from disk utility. If \"mount\" means connect, I cannot do that because it usually connects wirelessly and is not showing up in disk utility. (I don't know if it is relevant, but I use the time capsule for wireless internet, and it works just fine.) \nCan anyone explain to me (in the simplest, non-jargony terms possible) how I might troubleshoot this problem? I appreciate your help!\n\nA: Read only is a fail safe mode for the backups. It means there was a problem detected with the backup and you can only restore from it. \nThe system won't continue adding files since that would risk your losing even the ability to recover the files.\nThere is a procedure to re-attach a Mac to the existing backup once logic boards are replaced, but they assume that there isn't a failure of the backup at the same time.\nYou should have support from the people who replaced the logic board to help make sure you aren't just missing the steps to re-establish a backup, but if the backup were mine, I'd try backing up to a blank new USB drive and get a good backup now and then troubleshoot the Time Capsule to remedy the error causing the read-only status without risking your only backup. (Since the troubleshooting is to use Disk Utility to repair or erase the Time Capsule and then start over with an initial backup).\n", "Q: How to remove an icon from launchpad that does not appear in the Finder? I have moved an installer into the launchpad (uTorrent-Installer). The problem is that I would like to remove it now but as it is an installer it doesn't appear in \"Applications\" in the Finder. I can't right-click the icon to remove it nor can I drag and drop it into the trash.\nCan I delete apps from launchpad?\n\nA: If you are using Yosemite here is the surgical approach to remove only what you want to, instead of wiping out all of Launchpad.\nOpen up your Terminal app of choice, then use the following command:\nsqlite3 $(find /private/var/folders \\( -name com.apple.dock.launchpad -a -user $USER \\) 2> /dev/null)/db/db \"DELETE FROM apps WHERE title='APP_NAME_CASE_SENSITIVE';\" && killall Dock\n\nto remove an application from the Launchpad.\n\nA: *\n\n*open finder\n\n*go to your home or root directory (Icon looks like a house, may have your name or the name of your mac on it)\n\n*Open the applications folder located in that directory.\n\n*Drag the offending icon to the trash\n\n*Check Launchpad and watch it fade away\n\n\nA: Drag the icon or icons to the dock, then right click the icon on dock, select \"option\" - \"show in finder\", system will open a window to show you where the app located, then you can just threw it/them to the Trash.\n\nA: By default, Launchpad shows you all the apps installed on your Mac.\n\nTo remove a Mac App Store app that appears in Launchpad\nFollow these steps while you are logged in with an administrator account:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter Launchpad. \n\n*Click and hold on an icon until you see all icons jiggle.\n\n*Click the \"x\" button in the upper-left of the Mac App Store app icon you want to delete.\n\n\nNote: If you do not see an \"x\" button, either the app is not from the Mac App Store or you are logged in as a standard user. \n\n\n*Click \"Delete\" in the confirmation dialog to delete the app.\n\n\nTip: If you want to reinstall a deleted app, open Mac App Store, click the Purchases icon, then click on the \"Install\" button for the app.\nThis post is a shameless copy from: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4673\nCheck your Downloads folder\nAs you are talking about an installer, this might be located in your Downloads folder. If so, you need to remove it there.\nAnother way to delete an app from the launchpad:\n\n\n*\n\n*start your app from the launchpad\n\n*right click you app in the Dock\n\n*choose for 'options' -> 'Show in Finder'\n\n*now you can also delete it\n\n\n\n\nA: When an app has been uninstalled, often the icons are still in Launchpad. You still can not remove it. To remove click it and it will show with an question mark: drag it to the trash then.\n\nA: macOS Sierra 10.12.3:\nIf it's a .dmg file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Eject it in desktop\n\n*Delete it in finder\n\n*Open it in launchpad: It will show \"?\" in the icon\n\n*You can now drag and drop it to Trash\n\n\nA: I noticed while trying to figure this out that some of the apps displayed in LaunchPad aren't MacOS apps at all- but Chrome extensions that I added to the browser.  \nTo delete these, you can either:\n1) Open a finder folder and enter (Shift+Command+H) to see the applications folder there- you can delete these items by dragging to the trash - or;\n2) Load Chrome and going to settings/extensions and deleting them from the browser itself.\n\nA: Check the Chrome Apps folder to see if the app you're trying to delete is showing up on Launcher but n ot in Application.\nYour HDD> Users> [YOU]> Applications> Chrome Apps.\nThis worked for me, I hope it works for someone else. \n\nA: For Sierra first run this: \nsqlite3 $(sudo find /private/var/folders -name com.apple.dock.launchpad)/db/db \"DELETE FROM apps WHERE title='APP_NAME_CASE_SENSITIVE';\" && killall Dock\nwhich will result in an \"unable to open database file\" error response. Copy the database file name which is within the begin and end double quotes in the error response.\nNext run this:\nsqlite3 PASTE_WHAT_YOU_COPIED/db/db \"DELETE FROM apps WHERE title='APP_NAME_CASE_SENSITIVE';\" && killall Dock\n\nA: I had the same problem as you, but I fixed it with these steps (the app wasn't from the Mac App Store): \n\n\n*\n\n*Delete the app using Finder.\n\n*Empty your trash.\n\n*App will now have a question mark icon which you can drag to the trash.\n\n\nA: Check both of your Applications folders — there is an OS application folder (Shift+Command+A) and there is a user-based Application folder which is in the users home folder (Shift+Command+H).\n\nA: In difficult cases, you may need to have the Launchpad rebuilt from scratch. I had to do this when I found an app in my Launchpad that could not be opened \"because it may be damaged or incomplete,\" but I was unable to find the app anywhere on my system.\nThis hack requires executing commands from the Darwin command line with the Terminal app. You can do some real damage in the command line if you're not experienced with it (sometimes even when you are experienced).  If you still want to try this but you are at all hesitant about it, do as you would with any potentially dangerous operation and make sure you have a current backup of your system.\nI really mean it when I say the Launchpad icons will be rebuilt from scratch. They will probably end up in completely different places than what you remember, which could be a hassle if you have spent a lot of time organizing them into folders or otherwise arranging them \"just so.\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal window.\n\n*Enter cd ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dock.\n\n*Enter ls.\n\n*You should see a filename that looks something like 283F028F-D4F3-42D1-90E7-4337AEC50818.db (You may see other files ending with .db, but the important one will have a pattern like that.)\n\n*Rename the file with the mv command. I like to copy-and-paste the filename, then add {,.backup} to the end of it, a little Bash trick. So in this example, I would use this command: mv 283F028F-D4F3-42D1-90E7-4337AEC50818.db{,.backup}.\n\n*Enter killall Dock. Your desktop and icons will disappear momentarily, but don't panic. They should come back after a few seconds. (If they don't after a minute or so, you should be able to recover by logging out and back in.) \n\n*Open Launchpad.\n\n\nIf you used the killall Dock command in step 6, the Launchpad should come up fairly quickly.  If you had to log out and back in, you may have to wait a minute or so while watching a \"Loading Applications…\" message, then watching a grid of empty placeholder icons get filled in little by little.  Either way, you should eventually see a cleanly reorganized Launchpad without any extraneous app icons.\n\nA: I just get my Mac yesterday, and we have exactly the same problems. \nI installed a virtual machine to run Windows and then I deleted the program. However, there is a folder called \"Windows 8 tools\" left in the launchpad. I couldn't drag it to the trashcan nor could I right click it to delete. \nThen I just dragged it to the dock, right click it, and choose Options-show in the folder. I dragged the program to the trash and deleted it.\n\nA: If you have an application that does not 'jiggle' when you try to delete it - go to Finder, click on Applications, find the app, right press on your Apple mouse, and click 'moved to trash'. A window will open up saying.....before you delete....IGNORE IT! Go to Waste and empty it! Go back to your LaunchPad.....and the app is no longer there....it's gone!\n\nA: I had uninstalled an application but the icon still appeared in the launchpad. What removed the icon was to try to launch the application by choosing the icon (see LexS). Of course nothing launched because the application was already uninstalled. When I brought up the launchpad again there was a \"?\" on the icon. When I chose and held the mouse on the application the \"X\" appeared. Select the \"X\" and it's gone.\n\nA: i just using cleanymac to complete uninstalling deleted program thats still showing in launchpad. \n\nA: Press  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧  H in Applications (Finder), then just drag the items to the Trash.\n\nA: Press control+option+command+application icon in launchpad\n", "Q: I Would Like To Open Files in Different Tabs in the Same Window Using Xcode 5 I'm new to using Xcode.  When I started using Xcode a couple of weeks ago I had a file list to the left and had three tabs open for different files.  I'm not sure if that was a default setting or not.\nThis morning there was an update to iTunes.  I could not update it without closing Xcode.  Before if I opened a new tab it would open the same file that was in the other tab.  All I had to do was open a new file and it would open in the active tab.  Now when I open files they open in a new window.\nI have done online searches but they are for previous versions of Xcode.\nHow do I set up my preferences where a file list displays to the left as before and open files in new tabs instead of new windows?\n\nA: Left column in Xcode is called Navigator. You can show/hide it with ⌘+0 (Zero), or in the upper right window corner, see image:\n \nIn the Navigator there are dfferent tabs (Project Navigator, Symbols Navigator etc.). To see list of files in Your project You need to select Project Navigator or press ⌘+1.\nTo open file in current tab, single click on it in Navigator. If You double click the file, it would open in new window/tab. You can change the behaviour of double click in Preferences... -> Navigation -> Double Click Navigation.\n"]
