["Q: How to pair Bluetooth device with MacBook Pro after forgetting it? I accidently told my MacBook Pro to forget a Bluetooth device. I have no idea how to bring it back. How do I bring it back?\n\nA: Using \"System Preferences\" -> \"Bluetooth\" you should be able to add or \"pair\" the device in question as long as the device is in range and broadcasting a signal. You might need to turn the device off then on again, or tell it to \"pair\" or \"repair\" before it is visible from the MacBook.\n\nA: Bluetooth devices usually have \"Pairing Mode\". \nYou may have to put the device on pairing mode to be shown again in devices list in Bluetooth preferences and  be able to pair it. In headphones it is usually done by turning the device off and turning it on again by holding the power button for a certain amount of seconds.\nCheck your device's catalog. You'll definitely find it there.  \n", "Q: Is the \"Battery Is Not Charging\" state harmful? I have an Early 2015 Retina MacBook Pro. Sometimes I forget my charger and end up using my girlfriend's charger, which is for a 2011 MacBook Air, with a MagSafe to MagSafe 2 adapter. \nWhen I do so, the Battery status menu reads \"Battery Is Not Charging\", but the charge level in Activity Monitor appears to stay constant, so I can keep using my computer.\nDoes this harm my battery in any way?\n\nA: The MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) comes with a 60W MagSafe 2 Power Adapter and the MacBook Air (11 and 13-inch, Mid 2011) comes with a 45W MagSafe Power Adapter and according Find the right power adapter and cord for your Mac notebook \"You can use a compatible higher wattage adapter without issue, but it won't make your computer charge faster or operate differently. Lower wattage adapters will not provide enough power.\"  So since the MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) is designed for a 60W adapter the 45W adapter you're using isn't providing enough power to charge the battery is why you get the \"Battery Is Not Charging\" message however because its drawing enough to keep running without lowering the percentage of charge I don't see an issue although I personally would not make a habit of it.\n", "Q: Getting odd indentation or word-wrap behavior in pages I've recently started using Pages more for a large project I'm working on and it, of course, just started doing something odd. I'm wondering if anyone knows what might be going on.\nEssentially, when my type reaches the new-line point, my next lines indent like this:\n\nIf I place my cursor before 'been' and hit enter, my entire line backs up to where it should be. I'm having to do this for every line.\nQuestion\nDo I have a setting wrong? If so how do I stop this behavior and return pages to its defaults?\n\nA: IT looks like a hanging indent to me. In the Layout tab of the Format inspector panel, check to make sure First and Left are both set to 0 in the Indents section. The ruler is hidden by default, but the triangle and horizontal tick mark on the left margin of the ruler being set apart from one another will also produce either a hanging indent or first line indent (the upper tick mark represents the first line, the triangle represents the left margin aside from the first line). \n", "Q: Transfer Windows Apache Configuration to OS X My normal development enviornment has always been in Windows, but I finally scrounged up the money for a nice Mac Book Pro. I've managed to get everything I need set up Git, My Working Copy Repo, Web App is building without issue but I have a very indepth Apache config that has a lot of vhosts and rewrites in it that allow me to access the inner pages of my web app on a dev enviornment which I didn't write myself (I find apache configs daunting). \nIf my version of apache on OSX matches the version on my Windows PC, can I just copy the config folder over and restart apache for it to work?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: You should probably not blindly copy the entire Apache config directory. To start there will be several parts of the configuration that point to various files and folders that will be different.\nThe Mac stores the Apache config files in /etc/apache2 so I suggest you have a look at the files in there and compare them to your existing Windows files so that you can make the required changes.\nThen before you make any changes copy the entire /etc/apache2 directory to somewhere safe so you can always roll back if you fail.\n", "Q: How to enable echo service for tcp or udp on well-known port 7 on Mac OS X 10.8 or above? I am learning TCP/IP protocol with a Mac, and need echo service (refer to [RFC 862], or Wiki) to test network. But it seems to OS X doesn't implement it or disable it.\nI learned that launchd replaced inetd, you can create a launchd Property List File to launch daemons. In that way you can control some network service. So i edited telnet.plist (located in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons), set \"Disabled\" to \"NO\", and successfully enable telnet service. But I don't find echo.plist or something similar.\nOr, I can create an echo.plist according to telnet.plist\n\nBut what ProgramArguments should be? Is there a built-in daemon for echo service of which name maybe echod?\nOr, I have to compile inetd from source?\nThanks for any advice.\n\nA: AFAIK the echo service isn't implemented in OS X. You may use either a Java echo client/server or CocoaEcho instead.\nAfter unzipping the file check the folder .../build/Debug. I tested CocoaEcho server/client in 10.9.5 and it still works though it was built for 10.7. If you use a newer OS X version you may have to recompile it.\n", "Q: My iPad Air has a charging problem. it says its charging but it's not! My iPad Air says it is charging but it isn't and if I take the charger out and put it back in, it won't charge at all. What's happening?\n\nA: What I would do is make sure that it is in fact the iPad that's at fault and not a power adapter, as if you use an iPhone power adapter with an iPad, it will work, but will charge it slower. NEVER use a 3rd-party charger with any Apple device, if you are, that could be the problem. If you are using the official charger that came with your iPad, it simply could be broken. So try charging your iPad with different chargers.\nIf your iPad is at fault, restart your iPad by holding the power button and home button together until you see an Apple logo. Try charging it again when it comes back on in a few seconds.\nIf that still doesn't work, make sure that your iPad Air is running the current (as of today, 11/26/15) iOS 9.1 (update: 9.2 is current now, 12/13/15). Go to Settings> General> Software Update and update it if you need to, as the charging problem could be a rare bug in an older version iOS.\nIf your iPad is up to date, or after you update it, if your iPad still won't charge, back it up with iTunes (see this Apple Support link, also make sure that \"Encrypt Backup\" is checked and set the password as your iCloud password, also be sure to back up your iPad two or three times just to be safe) and then click \"Restore\" (erase) your iPad in iTunes. When your iPad is restored, connect it to iTunes again and click \"Restore Backup\" and select the backup you made. As long as you do these steps properly, none of your data will be lost, but a clean install might just fix your charging issue.\nIf it still won't work after a clean install, either the dock assembly or battery is no good and will need to be replaced. If it is under warranty, call AppleCare support and see about getting your iPad fixed for free. If not, you could still go with Applecare or go with a local repair shop for a cheaper price.\n\nA: Try to take a look at this webpage Abount Apple USB Adapters and be sure that you are using the right one.\n\nA: Four more steps to suggest before restoring from iTunes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close all of the apps\n\n*Turn off wifi and cell and turn back on.\n\n*Reset the iPad: press and hold the Sleep/Wake (on/off) and Home buttons, about 10 seconds, until you see the Apple Logo\n\n*More drastic: Settings > General > Reset All Settings\n", "Q: What's wrong with my Fusion Drive?

The drive (or at least one volume) has to be formatted as an HFS+ Journaled volume. Check this with Disk Utility. If necessary repartition the external drive. All data on the drive will be destroyed after repartitioning/formatting it. The drive (or at least one volume) has to have the size of the volume to back up (or more).\n\n*Usually you will be asked if the external drive should serve as a Time Machine backup drive after plugging it in for the first time. If not, open Time Machine in the System Preferences and configure the external drive as Time Machine backup drive.\n\nHit Select Backup Drive and choose your external drive:\n\nTurn on Time Machine. The backup will be started after a few minutes and will take some time depending on the size.\nRebuild Fusion Drive\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing altcmdR while starting your Mac.\n\n*Booted to Internet Recovery Mode open Utilities → Terminal in the menubar and enter:\ndiskutil cs list to get the CoreStorage listing.  \n\n*Copy the Logical Volume UUID, it's the fifth listed.  \n\n*Now delete the Logical Volume with diskutil cs deleteVolume LVUUID.\nIn your case that's diskutil cs deleteVolume E02059A8-E5D4-4DFF-9D0F-49408380838E\n\n*Copy the Logical Volume Group UUID, it's the first listed in the listing of diskutil cs list.  \n\n*Then delete the Logical Volume Group with diskutil cs delete LVGUUID.\nIn your case that's diskutil cs delete BD4DE488-7C63-4FBA-9FAC-9B92CD56EDE4E  \n\n*Enter exit and quit 'Terminal'\n\n*Open 'Disk Utility'.

It turns out that this problem reared it's head a lot with Dell U2410 monitors in the form of blurry fonts.\nThe solution is to override the EDID (Extended Display Identification Data) for your monitor so that OSX outputs in RGB mode.\nThe solution for doing this is detailed at, but I will repeat here.\nhttp://www.ireckon.net/2013/03/force-rgb-mode-in-mac-os-x-to-fix-the-picture-quality-of-an-external-monitor/\nDisable System Integrity Protection\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart Mac, as booting, trigger recovery mode with Cmd+R, then launch Terminal.\n\n*Enter csrutil disable and press return.\n\n*Restart Mac and login.\n\n\nGenerate Monitor Color profile override.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and save this ruby script https://gist.github.com/adaugherity/7435890\n\n*execute in terminal ruby saved_edid_script.rb\n\n*It will output a folder in your current directory.\n\n*Take this folder and place it in /System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides (El Capitan location, folder is a couple of levels up in older OSes, backup any folder with existing name)\n\n*Restart Mac\n\n\nRe-enable SIP.\nSame steps as \"Disable SIP\" but with csrutil enable\n", "Q: Search Spotlight for a file of specific type between two dates I've had a hard time tracking down a way to search for documents of a specific type between two dates in Spotlight.

After upgrading to El Capitan, I've started noticing annoying connections from the AirPlayXPCHelper to 192.168.1.0/24 subnet (my home network isn't in 192.168.1.0/24 subnet, it's in 172.16.0.0/12 subnet).\nQuestions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why AirPlayXPCHelper goes out to this network on port 5000 and 7000?\n\n*Is there a way to limit it's desire to go there?\n\n\nThank you.\n\nA: This happened to me too so I dug into it.  See Apple docs on Airplay Discovery https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment-reference-macos/airplay-discovery-apd19d206cc7/1/web/1.0\nI'll refer to a neighbor's device as an \"alien\" device to emphasize you don't want to connect to it, and that it is not on your local network.  (It could broadcast a public address, but that's not what is concerning people here.)\nThe alien device broadcasts its IP by Bonjour, peer-to-peer, or Bluetooth.  Assuming your network is even moderately secure, the Mac isn't getting the alien address via Bonjour.  Perhaps your Mac is getting the IP by peer-to-peer wifi but most likely your Mac is getting the alien IP via Bluetooth.\nYou could turn off Bluetooth to avoid this but some need it on.  I see no way on the Mac to say to ignore these broadcasts except for particular networks or to disable AirPlay discovery.\nOnce your Mac gets the alien device's IP address, your Mac tries to reach out over its regular network (wireless or wired) to the IP.  If it can't get there (because it is on a private address different than yours), no harm (except that Little Snitch noticed it).\nEven if the alien device broadcasts an IP that you can get to, suppose even the same IP as your real Airplay speakers/TV use, I understand the AES encoding of Airplay basically requires a pre-shared key.  Unless you've set that up, it won't talk to them.  If you did set it up, then your Mac already knows about your particular speakers/TV and there is no harm with it finding them again.\nAs for the case that you can get to the alien device via a public IP.  If it doesn't have the right pre-shared key, the Airplay AES encoding will keep the alien device from understanding what you send it.\nIt was scary to me to see this alien network show up, but it seems that this doesn't represent anything more serious than unnecessary alarms. Tell Little Snitch to silently block anything not on your local nets.\n\nA: Time to answer my own question:\n\nWhy AirPlayXPCHelper goes out to this network on port 5000 and 7000?\n\nThis is related to the Peer-to-Peer AirPlay and Airplay device discovery. macOS discovers new device and attempts to connect using these ports to finish (?) discovery process. \nCouple of my neighbours got new AppleTV and macOS attempts to connect to them. As all AppleTVs are connected to the different networks, it attempts to connect to each of them and it is what Little Snitch reports.\n\nIs there a way to limit its desire to go there?\n\nI'm not aware of any. I just blocked access for AirPlayXPCHelper to networks other than mine using Little Snitch.\n\nA: I had this exact same issue where Little Snitch detected external AirPlayXPCHelper traffic on port 7000 but treated it as internal traffic. What I mean is that even though I had all external traffic marked as deny, Little Snitch continued to prompt me on each connection attempt until I set it to deny local traffic (just for testing purposes), obviously I do not want to deny local traffic on this port... I do not understand why Little Snitch is interpreting this as local traffic (when the address is not in the local DHCP scope), a bug with Little Snitch perhaps?\nWhen I read a post about AirPlay it got me thinking about how AirPlay technology works, as it now uses bluetooth to establish connections between devices. I was unable to repeat the issue with local connections enabled and bluetooth disabled.\nLong story short I am now convinced this is simply a bug in Little Snitch and not someone trying to hack into my network. Blocking local connection or disabling bluetooth are the only ways I can permanently stop attempts.\nThe bluetooth traffic is coming from an AirPlay enabled device somewhere near your computer. Maybe a next door neighbours AppleTV?\n\nA: This question will help you disable the root cause of the problem. \nIf you're the curious type, I'd fire up WireShark somewhere and see if the Mac is actually sending out packets on those ports to those addresses. It may be that AirPlay has assigned itself an interface and is using it as a loop back or otherwise. \n\nA: I performed a traceroute and discovered that the request appears to have originated from the other side of my ISP gateway.\n\n\n*\n\n*My Edge Firewall \n\n*My on-prem ISP Modem \n\n*ISP Gateway\n\n*192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1)  9.921 ms  148.842 ms  10.342 ms\n\n\nI added a new firewall rule on my edge firewall (and not through Little Snitch) to block inbound requests. It seems to be no longer an issue.\n", "Q: OS X El Capitan Downloading problem I've downloaded OS X El Capitan from the AppStore.

E.g. someone attempting to brute force my admin password to remote login etc\nRunning OS X 10.11.1, built-in firewall set to block all incoming connections, Little Snitch 3.6.1. I'm on a home wifi network. There are 2 other Macbooks, 3 iPhones and 1 laptop running Windows on the same network.\n\nA: The mDNSResponder is responsible to handle (beyond other aspects) automatic distribution and resolution of computer hostnames without using a dedicated DNS-server. In the OS X world this is called the Bonjour service. The local names of all Bonjour (or zeroconf) enabled devices - including your host - are sent to a special multicast address: 224.0.0.251.\nTo detect those devices the firewalls have to open the respective port and accept incoming connection.\nSince your host probably is the only receiver and sender in your local network there is no special risk to accept those incoming connections.\nIn larger, non-SOHO or non-home networks security issues exist:\nSecurity issues (wikipedia):\n\nBecause mDNS operates under a different trust model than unicast DNS—trusting the entire network rather than a designated DNS server, it is vulnerable to spoofing attacks by any system within the multicast IP range. Like SNMP and many other network management protocols, it can also be used by attackers to quickly gain detailed knowledge of the network and its machines. Because of this, applications should still authenticate and encrypt traffic to remote hosts (e.g. via RSA, SSH, etc.) after discovering and resolving them through DNS-SD/mDNS.\n\n", "Q: Boot Into Recovery Partition After Installing Linux I want to install Linux on my mid 2014 Macbook Pro for educational purposes. However, I don't want this to be permanent. I've tried to partition the hard drive and install both OSs but I have not been successful and I would like to avoid using a virtual machine. \nIf I install linux onto the main partition that currently contains mac OS X and leave the recovery partition, will it be possible for me reinstall OS X from the recovery partition when I'm done with linux? I don't fully understand the process and therefore I am concerned that installing linux will install a new boot loader or something other software in the booting process that will prevent me from booting into the recovery partition. \nCan I still boot into the recovery partition after install linux on a mac?\n\nA: Short answer:\nIt will be possible.\nMore elaborate answer:\nIf you leave the Recovery HD intact, you can still boot from it later on as the boot process Linux uses (usually GRUB these days) will not touch the ability to use the Alt key to boot from any attached bootable partition.\nSo, pressing Alt at computer startup will then present you with two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows (even though Linux is installed; some distributions may show their name though)\n\n*Recovery HD-<version> (<version> is the version of OS X at the time you installed OS X, which created the Recovery partition)\n\n\nAdditional:\nYou have a MacBook Pro (Mid 2014).  So, you can always reinstall the original version of OS X (which may be either OS X 10.9 Mavericks or OS X 10.10 Yosemite), which came with your computer as you can use the Internet Recovery even if your internal Recovery HD is gone entirely.\nTo start the recovery process, hold down Cmd+R at computer startup.  If a Recovery HD is found, it will be used.  Otherwise, the Internet Recovery is used.  To specifically force the Internet Recovery, hold down Cmd+Alt+R at computer startup until you see a spinning (or blinking) globe.\nMore information can be obtained here: OS X: About OS X Recovery\n\nA: Even when all of the drive is re-purposed, which means that also the recovery partition is overwritten, one can still boot to Recovery if an Internet connection is available. The Cmd-R key press at boot is handled by the on-board UEFI and therefore can do without a recovery partition.\n", "Q: How to create a video recording of a background window I'm looking for some solution for creating a video recording limited to a single window, which continues to work even if that window gets partially or fully covered by other windows.\nAll of the screencasting/recording solutions I found seem to, at most, allow limiting the recording by a sub-region of the screen, and can't record covered/hidden windows.\n\nA: No applications yet exist for recording movies from the content of obscured windows.\nScreen recorders like QuickTime, ScreenFlow, and Snapz Pro X grab from the graphics hardware after composition. The process is focused on speed and low impact on the operating system.\nOn OS X, processes only get limited access to window content from other processes.\nHidden or obscured windows can be captured but doing so is relatively slow, computationally expensive, and not suitable for recording moving content. This is why tools that do offer individual window capture limit themselves to grabbing still images.\n", "Q: Logitech Ultrathin mouse scroll behaviour on mac i am using a Logitech UltraThin T630 mouse with a macbook pro (2015, os 10.11.1) and i am having a strange scroll behaviour.

But its docs make no mention of this.\nIf not root, how do I fix it?\n\nA: By default, MacPorts installs in /opt/local, which usually needs to be created and therefore MacPorts by default needs root to install and upgrade. However, it doesn't have to be this way.

I want to configure it for moving between tabs (using a 3rd party app called BetterTouchTool)\nEdit:\nOh I should mention that I've already disabled the option 'swipe between pages using left/right two finger scrolls', but that just disables the back/forward feature — not the horizontal scrolling functionality itself. (And even though most pages don't have space horizontal scrolling, the action still produces a \"dummy\" movement.)\n\nA: If you have disabled two finger swipes between pages in trackpad preferences then you should be able to configure it in BetterTouchTool by assigning keyboard shortcuts for those gestures. Swipes are generally fast and scrolls are generally slow. So you should be able to get both working side by side.\nYou can disable all scrolls if it really bothers you from accessibility section.

Many/most of the Services can be set up so that people with different OS can work together.\nUsually, you won't need or enable all of them but it's worth considering what you might make good use of and experimenting with some of them.\nBelow is a list of descriptions of the Services that I've shamelessly plagiarized from the book: OS X Server Essentials 10.10 by Arek Dreyer & Ben Greisler (I have a hard copy but you can buy it via itunes and other fine stores - https://itunes.apple.com/book/os-x-server-essentials-10.10/).\nCaching - speed up the download of software from Apple\nCalendar - share calendars, book resources like meeting rooms, projectors, etc\nContacts - share Contacts information\nFilesharing - share files. These mount like hard drives on the user's computer. \nMail - provide email service (needs a domain name, obviously)\nMessages - used to be ichat. Think of it like Skype. Users can text each other, video conference, etc.\nProfile Manager - manage the different Apple devices you are responsible for from the server\nTime Machine - backup the different Macs on your network to the server\nVPN - users not physically at the same location as the server can connect to it over the internet and be treated as if they are physically there (so they can use printers, other services, etc).\nWebsites - a web server\nWiki - a web site that can be easily edited with free-form information. Think Wikipedia but not as sophisticated. Each user can have their own wiki.\nXcode - allows developers of Xcode projects to share code and collaboratively build something\n", "Q: Do all iMessages always get pushed to Messages on the Mac? Hypothetical situation: Connected on different internet connections. If there are active conversations on my Macbook, and I get a text from one of the conversations not listed there, will it always push it to the macbook? Or if I read or delete it immediately, will it not show on the Macbook? Or are there ways to block certain numbers from going to the macbook?\nFrom what I understand, all messages received will always go to the Macbook if it's configured to do so. There's no way to filter them.\nJust wondering how iMessage works exactly.\n\nA: Unless there is a glitch and as long as you are connected to the internet, you will receive all iMessages that you would get on your iPhone on your Mac. If your iPhone is on the same Wi-Fi network, you will also receive all SMS and MMS texts on your Mac, as well.\nIf you blocked any numbers on your iPhone, they will be blocked on your Mac and the other way around.\nNow, if you receive a text for a conversation that is for whatever reason not on your Mac (like from an internet issue), it should start the conversation on your Mac from that text.\n", "Q: Do Powerbeats2 Use Bluetooth LE (4.0)? Yesterday I bought Powerbeats2 wireless in-ear headphones at Best Buy. I am wondering if they use Bluetooth LE or older Bluetooth technology, such as Bluetooth 2.1. \n\nI've looked on Apple's website and Beats' website, but neither of them provide specs for the headphones.\nSince Beats is an Apple subsidiary, I am assuming that this question is not off-topic.\n\nA: Yes, it is Bluetooth 4.0. I've been using it for the past one year. Although Beats or Apple website do not provide this information this Engadget article explicitly mentions it.\n\nThe Powerbeats² keep the (albeit modified) hook-over-the-ear design, but liberate heads from handsets via Bluetooth 4.0\n\n", "Q: Recover Messages content after clean install of El Capitan I've done a clean install of El Capitan. I do have a raw file back up of my home folder, containing the messages archive. This was created when I was in Yosemite. \nI grabbed the entire contents of the Home folder (/Users/myusername). This includes the Messages folder in the Library (/Users/myusername/Library/Messages). This was just a direct copy to an external drive. This folder contains three files and a folder\nchat.db\nchat.db-shm\nchat.db-wal\n[folder] Attachments\n\nI've attempted to just copy these files from the external drive to the new messages folder on my hard drive, but the structure of new and old messages appears different and the direct copy did not restore my old messages.\nI'm not sure what the content of the files is as they're not readily readable, but the new Messages folder in El Capitan has an Archive folder by default, which seems to contain the message content now, instead of whatever way it was being done in Yosemite.\nIs there a way to recover the old messages using either the archive I have or iCloud? \n\nA: By using the items mentioned in my previous comments and creating a symlink to the /Users/myusername/Library/Messages/Archive folder from inside the container (the change in structure created by el capitan) then restarting the machine, I got the messages back.\nContainer Path: ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iChat/Data/Library/Messages/Archive\n", "Q: iCloud Drive folders dissappared Normally when I click on my iCloud drive, I see this:\niCloud\n\n|--Pages\n\n|--Numbers\n\n|--Keynote\n\nHowever, now, when I click on iCloud drive, I am presented with a new folder called com~apple~CloudDocs.\nAll the Pages, Numbers and Keynotes sub folders have disappeared (and the documents within them).\nHow can I get my folders (and documents!!!) back?\n\nA: Logging out and back in seems to fix the issue.\n", "Q: Cannot connect to App Store via iPhone - Wrong Password although password is right So I have this weird problem.

However, if I try to connect via the  iPhone appstore using the same email and password I get:\n\n\"Verification Failed Your Apple ID or password is incorrect\" error\n  message \"\n\nI have already tried resetting my password via Apple ID management and successfully changed my password with a new one. I still get the same error message. \nAny Ideas?\nEdit: The problem occurs in only one of the iTunes account I use (Polish Appstore account). I can connect to my other account thru both my iPhone and my Macbook without any problem. So, I do not think there's a problem with the iPhone or its settings. I also don't think that it has anything to do with my internet connection. \n\nA: If the servers are broken or the network isn't working between you and the servers, your password isn't actually wrong. Even when all lights are green at http://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/ it could be an issue that'e exclusively server side, and you'll need Apple Support to get to that conclusion.\nBarring that, you can certainly to go through \"the usual troubleshooting steps\" on iOS since you're unlikely continuing to type the password incorrectly.\nYou should start with the support article below:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT203005\nBefore you contact support (the link at the bottom of the page - the next step if that doesn't work) is to maybe try a restart.

I get no files or anything.  How do I access what's in the dropbox?  Mine is full.\nNext, I am fed up with limited storage on iCloud, Dropbox and the like.  I want to get rid of these as I will not pay the money to upgrade.  How do I get rid of them and sync directly to my iMac from my iPad and iPhone???\n\nA: \nI am fed up with limited storage\nI will not pay the money to upgrade\n\nThat's the problem right there.\n\nA: Both Dropbox and iCloud work in very similar manners.\nYou can turn off syncing at any time and then copy the files from the \"chosen\" folder for each sync option to save them anywhere on your filesystem.\nYou don't have to turn things off to prune the storage and ride the \"free\" tier. Don't pay for something if you don't need extra storage - but those options are there for little money on iCloud side to get you over a temporary spike in storage needs if you need a month to clear things out.\nApple bundles a mostly integrated personal cloud storage solution with Server.app - which costs money and is generally much more time to learn how to operate than the time it takes to learn how to maintain files on dropbox or iCloud in terms of initial setup.\nHowever, once you set up your server, there is no bill for exceeding the storage space on the server hard drive - and that included attaching as many external drives as you care. Server can run on any Mac that runs the normal OS and you don't have to leave it running all the time, but of course files won't sync when it's not running and connected to the network.\n", "Q: Icons in Finder, Safari, Mail, and Dock are not visible I booted my MacBook Pro a few days ago and some of the icons on my dock were not visible. I noticed that there were icons missing in Safari, Finder and Mail. I attach a screen-shot to make my issue more clear.\n\n\nA: Try Safe Booting once. It causes all caches(including icon caches) to be rebuilt.\nSteps for Safe Boot here\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose Apple menu > Shut Down.\n\n*After your Mac shuts down, wait 10 seconds, then press the power button.\n\n*Immediately after you hear the startup tone, hold down the Shift key.\nYou should press the Shift key as soon as possible after you hear the startup tone, but not before.\n\n*Release the Shift key when you see the gray Apple logo and progress indicator.\nTo leave safe mode, restart your Mac again, but don’t hold down any keys during startup.\n", "Q: IKEv2 VPN El Capitan 10.11 When I setup an IKEv2 VPN, which I use from Windows without issues, on OSX 10.11.1 it refuses to connect.

Basically, dust can get into the earpod jack and cause an electrical disruption. To fix this, put the earpod plug in the jack until you hear the click, and then pull it out again. Do this over and over again. \n   Try it out, and if you have sound, then you have fixed it. If this has not happened yet, it will most likely happen in the near future, so be prepared.

Is there a tool built-in or third party that allows me to turn start up or shut down applications based on setting that I choose for a give time? For example, I usually run Dropbox, Google Drive, and a backup manager on start up. However, if I go to a coffee shop to work, I would like to preserve battery and bandwidth, so I would turn off non-essential Dropbox and Google drive. \nSo instead of manually turn off and on applications, is there a tool that allows me to do that just by selecting a \"profile\"?\n\nA: That's a good question - gave me a bit of head scratch. My initial answer (I will come with something else once I contemplate on that a bit)  would be onefor myself. I personally prefer terminal/bash to solve most of my OS X problems and belive me, most of them can be done very efficiently from the terminal ;)\nThat being said, I would write very short, very basic, bash scripts (re)starting / starting the software running in background you mentioned depending on the need. \nYou could play around with launchctl and make some jobs for that that will shut down/re-enable jobs for you but after you hit man launchctl you will probably realise that there is nothing wrong about killall -HUP in the end ;) There are very good tools to tame launchctl – one being lingon, which I also use for more resilient (read annoying) software like adobe's updates etc. to turnoff and disable.   \nProfiles, similar to ehh... Windows profile does not exist in the user space, there is no registry or anything like that - os x user resides in its userspace (and for that i'm eternally thankful) so you can (like I do) have for exampel, 2 different local user accounts, but they share their respective ~/Library (user settings/prefs) together - that is quite a nice thing to have and gives you a clean user without the need to synchronize settings between the two. I have a lot of my ~/Library/Preferences files and most of the ~/. so that might be an option for you, takes time but pays of double after you reinstall and have your old home in seconds after launching an re-link script.\nWell, as for now I recommend the #!/bin/bash solution which is maybe not the most elegant but it surely is the fastest one to achieve, and writing a killall script for start/restarting/shutting down processes is a 20 min learn curve procedure.\n", "Q: Can I make Firefox the default browser in iOS I really want to use Firefox as my main browser but can't find a way to make it the default browser on iOS: this make it's adoption much more complicated. Is it totally impossible? \nEdit - Example of use case: while clicking a link in the Twitter app, I would like it to open directly in Firefox.\nI won't jailbreak.\n\nA: You cannot change the default browser (Safari) unless you jailbreak, which you do not want to do. You can however use supported apps. For example, just like how ads in browsers may open app store \"sponsored\" apps, YouTube will open Chrome if enabled to. If the app does not specify which browser to launch in when a browser-required link is clicked, Safari will be launched.\nIf programmed to do so, apps are well able to launch (and transmit data) to other apps. You cannot change Apple's iOS default settings but you can decide which apps you use such that the apps you like will be supported.\nUpdate (2019) : The \"Share\" option in iOS may be able to launch specific browsers, eg: Firefox has this option.\n\nA: I have been using Firefox since it was a new experimental program called Phoenix. I downloaded the Gecko rendering engine to play with when it still fit on a single 1.44 mb floppy. It's my only real browser, and one of the first things I install on a new system. I don't use Mail.app or Safari.\nExcept on iOS. The only thing I value on iOS is stability. I live with the default mail and browser clients because they work, there are no required workarounds, and no added overhead. Every \"alternate browser\" on iOS is Safari with a different skin and no access to the faster JavaScript engine. Yes, I lose Firefox Sync on my iPhone and iPad. But it works.\nIf you want an all-Firefox ecosystem, you will either have to live with the inherent problems on iOS or give up on that one battlefront. There is a reason that Mozilla didn't release Firefox for iOS for so long - they were hoping Apple would back down and allow some freedom. Apple didn't. Mozilla has to live with it. Chrome on iOS has the same restrictions. No add-ons, no ability to make it the universal default browser.\n\nA: Use Apps That Work Together\nApps can launch other applications, so you can take advantage of this to build ecosystems of apps that work well together and use each other as the defaults.\nGoogle’s iOS apps are the star of the show here. Let’s say you have Chrome, Gmail, and Google Maps installed. When you tap a link in the Gmail app, it will open in the Chrome app. When you tap a map link in Chrome, it will open in the Google Maps app. And, when you tap a business’s email address in the Google Maps app, it will open in the Gmail app.\nIf you want to change default apps because you really prefer Google’s services, try just using as many of Google’s apps as possible. They’ll work together and allow you to avoid the standard iOS apps as much as possible. If you use third-party apps, hopefully they offer support for choosing your own preferred apps.\nIn case of Firefox I haven't heard or done anything of this sort. \n", "Q: Is it possible to enable OSX keyboard text substitution in more apps? OSX has built into text substitution that is configured in System Preferences > Keyboard > Text. This works great in certain apps, such as Evernote and Textedit, but seems to be disabled in other apps/content areas. Is it possible to enable it in other apps, such as Google Chrome?\nI would like to use text substitution to drop in signatures when composing emails at gmail.com while using Google Chrome.\n\nA: The application needs to implement Auto Text Expansion and it hasn't been implemented in Chrome yet. You could try this Chrome plugin Auto Text Expander. You'll have to again add the text-expansions though.\nMac's Text expansion should work in Safari though. If not already enabled, you can enable by typing the following in terminal.\ndefaults write -g WebAutomaticTextReplacementEnabled -bool true\n\nA: I gave up on TextExpander shortly after I started using it.  It didn't work easily on iOS devices - although there is a compatible iOS app - and I just found it cumbersome to use.  The updated version of the MacOS keyboard shortcut seems to work in more apps now and syncs across all of my Apple ecosystem devices.  \nI do use another solution for the Mac (this doesn't exist on iOS but it's excellent on the Mac) called \"Clipy\" for many items now that I'd otherwise have to remember keyboard shortcuts for.  It's essentially a bottomless clipboard that allows personalization and organization.  I recommend it for anything that you type repetitively but don't necessarily want to remember a shortcut for.  Just invoke a keystroke to bring up the list of your stored snippets and pick one.  Find it here: https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/58124/clipy\n\nA: I have found this to be problematic, too.  It is the one thing that nudges me back to using Safari instead of Chrome for OSX.  The solution that I've decided to use - at least for now - is to purchase TextExpander, which is a system-wide text shortcut solution.  \nWhile it does have significant advantages over the native text shortcuts there are some drawbacks as well.  For example, if I decide to delete the shortcuts in the System Preferences pane in order to avoid conflicts it will also delete them on my iOS devices, which is an undesirable effect for me.  \nPerhaps @sdayal can tell me if his tip about enabling the text expansion will work in reverse and, in fact, if it is also available for other applications.  For example, could I use the following terminal command:\ndefaults write -g WebAutomaticTextReplacementEnabled -bool false\n\nto disable the text shortcuts in Safari?  Moreover, are the equivalent commands for other apps, such as Mail, that I could use?  For example, would it be appropriate to use:\ndefaults write -g MailAutomaticTextReplacementEnabled -bool false\n\nThank you in advance for any assistance.  Turning off these shortcuts has been a vexing problem for me.  \n", "Q: Weird icon (OS X El Capitan) This icon appeared on my Mac Pro with El Capitan.\n\nIt cannot be clicked, nor I can see a name.\nAny ideas what it might be?

I have iMac A, MacBook Pro B, and MacBook Pro C. I want to copy a file from A to B and C using AirDrop. The problem is that I have multiple instances of the B and C machines showing up in AirDrop.

Surprisingly Google isn't giving me relevant search results on this.\nThanks\n\nA: I'm currently experiencing this issue has well.\nI will test using sudo scutil to rename computers via bash but still, AirDrop on OS X Mac relies on broadcasting the computers name instead of the iCloud name if multiple users are on the same computer which is not a good idea for a corporate environment.\n", "Q: Problem with installing grunt (lodash@0.9.2) I have iMac (ElCapitan) for few days and I try to install all needs for my work (templating for WordPress).\nI try to install grunt, but I got WARN messages in terminal and I am absolutely out of what they mean:\nnpm WARN deprecated lodash@0.9.2: lodash@<3.0.0 is no longer maintained. Upgrade to lodash@^3.0.0.\nnpm WARN deprecated lodash@2.4.2: lodash@<3.0.0 is no longer maintained. Upgrade to lodash@^3.0.0.\n\nI have no idea, if that is problem in my computer, or grunt. I try to search by google, but I did not find any suitable answer or better answer which can clear this for me.\n...will I need upgrade lodash@?\n\nA: so it is just warning and grunt is installed. Yesterday was not present in system, but when I check now by grunt --version, I got answer about version of installed grunt.\nI got confirmation on Github.\n", "Q: Unable to copy OSX Installer from external drive to Mac As usual I wanted to prepare bootable USB with OSX. Some time ago I've made a copy of my Mavericks, Yosemite and El Capitan to external drive.\nI wanted simply to drag & drop El Capitan to prepare USB drive.\nAfter dragging El Capitan app file to desktop I get\n\nThe point is, that my Desktop does not contain this file. What's wrong? The same happens to all 3 files. I cannot copy them. Are those files corrupted? In a meanwhile I'm downloading new file form App store...\nThis disk was plugged into Windows multiple times. Is it possible that Windows damaged app files? I've noticed that Windows treats app files as folders so maybe it changed the content?\n\nA: This is a known bug in the Finder app of OSX. Options you can try : \n\n\n*\n\n*Instead of drag-dropping you can try right click -> Copy Item and\nthen paste it on the desktop\n\n*Try copying the files through terminal command.\n\n*Try making a folder on the desktop, and then copy the files in the newly created folder.\n\n\nReference : Apple Discussions.\n\nA: I tried Terminal even as the first option but no luck in my iTerm. Then I tried all combinations with dragging and dropping and right click copy and paste. Nothing worked.\nFinally I went level up and dragged and dropped parent folders called OSX. First time it just created empty OSX directory in my Desktop with the same error message. But when I did it for the second time, it started copying all 3 big installers.\nIt's absolutely weird. So finally it's done. I'm writing this response from clean, formatted El Capitan.\nUp for Shaggy for all efforts!\n", "Q: Other ID's appearing in my Mac Store account Just bought a refurbished Mac Mini, with new SSD and fresh instal of Yosemite. After setup, using my existing IOS Apple account details I updated to El Capitan, added Little Snitch and Firefox. All seemed well, until I started to get notifications that updates were available for software I didn't recognise. Being new to Mac I thought this might be OS based and clicked to upgrade, only to be informed that such upgrades were not authorised for this user. I also saw two unknown e-mail addresses. How do I fix this? Also, if as I suspect, ID's are still associated with the machine, why did the updates (to apps not installed) only show up now? HELP!\n\nA: Just in case anyone is interested, I think I solved this. Still not sure why it should be the case, but it seems related to an external USB drive. When that is mounted, I get the notices about app updates I haven't bought and therefore can't  download. Even when the drive is ejected, this persists. However, if I clean boot without the drive or re-boot, all is well.\n", "Q: iTunes shortcut to delete files from disk I remember iTunes has a shortcut \"Cmd + Opt + delete\" to delele files from disk, it works in any playlist in iTunes.

I've also disabled any sharing service.\nHow can I resolve this problem? I want to use sleep mode without disabling wifi and without losing 20% of battery overnight…\nUPDATE: It seems that Apple has fixed the battery drain (in sleep mode) in macOS Sierra (10.12). But the macOS Sierra update didn’t fix the problem for me. It just introduced a new problem to my solution (posted below). Now with Sierra, The SleepWatcher program doesn't always execute the wake-scripts when waking up, resulting in a delayed enabling of the Wi-Fi (sometimes up to 45 seconds after a wake).\n\nA: I didn't found the exact cause of the problem, but I did found a solution which will avoid massive battery drains in sleep mode. The solution was to disable Airport (WiFi) when the Macbook was sleeping.\nI used SleepWatcher v2.2 (http://www.bernhard-baehr.de) to run 2 scripts at wake and sleep interrupts. When the macbook goes to sleep, I execute the following command to disable WiFi:\n/usr/sbin/networksetup setairportpower en0 off\n\nWhen the Macbook wakes up again, I enable WiFi again:\n/usr/sbin/networksetup setairportpower en0 on\n\nYou can download a script that installs SleepWatcher and the scripts at a blog post of mine (No ads located on the page).\nPlease note that in the original question of mine I said that I didn't want to disable WiFi constantly when putting the Mac to sleep. This solution does the same, but automatically, which makes it a good solution for the battery drain.\n\nThe sleep script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nstatus=$(networksetup getairportpower en0 | grep -Ei \"On$\")\n\nif [ -f /tmp/wifi.on ]; then\n    rm /tmp/wifi.on\nfi\n\nif [ \"\" !=  \"$status\" ]; then\n    echo \"`date` -- WiFi is On ... storing statement\" >> /tmp/sleep.log\n\n    touch /tmp/wifi.on\n    networksetup setairportpower en0 off\nfi\n\nThe wake script:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ -f /tmp/wifi.on ]; then\n    echo \"`date` -- Enablig WiFi\" >> /tmp/sleep.log\n    sleep 3\n    networksetup setairportpower en0 on\nfi \n\n\nA: The problem is the macOS continues to check for updates (including email, software, news, etc.) while your MacBook Pro is asleep (this feature is called \"Power Nap\"). This means it's very quick to get up and running when you open your MacBook, but it also means your battery goes down while it's asleep.\nThe problem some people have is that even with \"Power Nap\" disabled, their battery still goes down as MacOS continues to check for updates (it's possibly other software checking online for things).\nTo fix this, you can tell you MacBook Pro to disconnect from the Internet while it's asleep, preventing online checks.\nTo do this, you need to set the tcpkeepalive setting to 0. \nOpen up Terminal and type:\nsudo pmset -b tcpkeepalive 0\n\nAfter you enter your password for sudo it gives you a warning saying some features may not work properly. This is fine, it simply disables Internet access during sleep.\nYou can check it is set correctly by running:\npmset -g\n\nWhich should show \"tcpkeepalive 0\"\nAnd you can, of course, reverse it at any time by running:\nsudo pmset -b tcpkeepalive 1\n\nSimple!\nNote: You can also force your Mac not to connect to the Internet when it's asleep even when connected to a power supply, if you like: sudo pmset -a tcpkeepalive 0. (Personally I don't mind as long as it's not using my battery, so -b is fine for me.)\nAlso note: The results from pmset -g will vary depending on if your MacBook Pro is connected to power or not when you run the command. It will reflect the current tcpkeepalive setting, depending on its current power situation.\n\nA: I found a fix. Seems that 2015 and 2016 MBPs are affected. This required disabling SIP and changing a system setting. I reported the bug to Apple so hopefully they'll fix it sometime soon. Please report it to them as well since any changes you make will be probably reverted with a system update.\nFrom here: MacBook Pro 13 with Retina display consumes 10% battery overnight with the lid closed, is this normal?\nand more details about it here https://discussions.apple.com/message/30869802#30869802\nYou have to turn SIP off, then do \nioreg -l | grep board-id\n\nto get your board ID and then look for a file in the following directory that has your board ID as the filename (*.plist file) \n/System/Library/Extensions/IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/X86PlatformPlugin.kext/Contents/Resources\n\nRight click on the file > get info, and change permission for 'Everyone' to read and write (or edit this using sudo chmod a+rw *.plist). Then change these key values with a text editor so that they match these settings:\n<key>TCPKeepAliveDuringSleep</key>\n<false/>\n...\n<key>NotificationWake</key>\n<false/>\n<key>DNDWhileDisplaySleeps</key>\n<true/>\n\nFinally, turn SIP back on and reboot.\n\nA: Does your machine support Power Nap?  As I understand, this function causes the computer to wake at certain intervals to do things like check email but still keeps power use to a minimum.  I'm not sure if it uses an RTC alarm to do this or not. \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204032\n\nA: Here is a better way to toggle your wifi on/off with only one command\nnetworksetup -getairportpower en0 | grep \"On\" && networksetup -setairportpower en0 off || networksetup -setairportpower en0 on\n\nAnd you can also create a shortcut to running the command\n\n1. Start Automator, and create a new Service.\n\n2. Set \"Service receives selected: to \"no input\" in \"any application\".\n\n3. Add an action named \"Run Shell Script\". It's in the Utilities section of the Actions Library.\n\n4. Insert the bash command you want into the text box and test run it  using the Run button (top right). It should do whatever the script does (off, on or toggle), and there should be green ticks below the Action.\n\n5. Save it, giving it a service name you can remember.\n\n6. Go to System Preferences -> Keyboard, and go to the Shortcuts tab\n\n7. Go to the Services section, and scroll down to General - you should find your service there. If you select the line, you can click \"add shortcut\" and give it a keyboard shortcut.\n\n\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/22155705#22155705\n\nA: Was having this problem on 10.12 Sierra.

I am trying to find how to replicate a feature that I am used to, about the browser search autocomplete.\nSay I want to search Google for the following phrase: \"wikipedia star wars a new hope\". Of course in this particular case I could use a Wikipedia search provider, but that is not the point.\nIn the Android browser, I can start typing \"wi\" and the browser will search and suggest \"wikipedia\". I can then click on a button and complete \"wikipedia\" and keep writing. At this point, maybe I will write \"sta\" and the browser will suggest \"wikipedia star wars\". Again, I click and have this phrase in the search bar, and keep writing. I then add \"a n\" and probably the browser will suggest the complete phrase \"wikipedia star wars a new hope\" that I can click to actually search.\nThis is an enormous time saver whenever searching for longish phrases. In Safari, I get the autocomplete, but if, say, after writing \"wi\" I click on the suggestion \"wikipedia\", it is searched immediately, which makes impossible to keep writing.\nIs there a way to activate this feature in Safari?

I have iTunes running on my El Capitan Mac Mini. I have the iTunes Media folder linked to a NAS using NFS. This has worked for me quite well in the past. However after upgrading the storage on my Mac and reconnecting it to iTunes things have stopped working as well.\nFor some reason iTunes will organize the files in the way it would before. It will no longer put movies in a separate subfolder (which I like actually), for TV Shows it will no longer create season subfolders and most annoyingly it will put all the music in the iTunes Media root folder.\nWhat's even stranger is that when I use a local iTunes Media folder everything seems to working as it should.

How do I ask Siri about event length in calendar? She tells me that I have event and it starts at 10am but asking 'how long does it take' or 'how long is it' confuses Siri.\n\nA: As far as I know (I am on iOS 9.0.2), Siri cannot explicitly tell you the duration of the event. For events that are longer than three (3) hours, it also does not provide the end time of the event. Siri also (mostly) cannot do things related to previous items requested if you do not refer to it clearly, which is why \"how long does it take\" or \"how long is it\" will confuse Siri.\nYou can only work out the duration of the event if they are or shorter than 3 hours as Siri will only show you the start and end time. Past 3 hours, you have to physically enter your calendar app to find out.\n", "Q: Configure launchd I have a launchd plist in ~/Library/LaunchAgents designed to run a script located at ~/writout.sh every day at 10:30AM:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key>\n    <string>local.jackson.testwrite.plist</string>\n    <key>Program</key>\n    <string>/Users/jacksonkearl/writeout.sh</string>\n    <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>Hour</key>\n        <integer>10</integer>\n        <key>Minute</key>\n        <integer>30</integer>\n    </dict>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nThe script is:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"it works\" >> log.txt\n\nHowever, nothing gets written at the desired time. \nAre there steps I must take to alert launchd to the new agent?

It looks like the default path for launchd isn't one a user can write to (and probably for good reason).\nBut, doing launchd/launchctl by hand is rough. I highly, highly recommend using a tool like LaunchControl or Lingon. They provide the help and automation that makes me so much better at these scripts.\nUsing Launch Control - it quickly let me recreate your job, had all sorts of helpful hints, and most importantly knew to suggest redirection to debug the script exit / error condition.\n\nWith one click, it added the lines above to my plist file and offered to save it and reload the job for me.\n\nA: You need to load the launch agent into launchd.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Type cd ~/Library/LaunchAgents\n\n*Type launchctl load -w local.jackson.testwrite.plist (assuming that is the name of your plist file)\n\n\nThis will load and persistently enable your plist.\nYou can check if it is loaded with launchctl list\n\nA: You have several errors in your plist file:\n<key>Label</key>\n<string>local.jackson.testwrite.plist</string>\n\nbecomes\n<key>Label</key>\n<string>local.jackson.testwrite</string>\n\nand the plist is missing a \n</plist>\n\nat the end.

This is an important security concern!\nThis generally means your script has permissions like 'r_xr_xr_x' — readable and executable by anyone, but writable by no one.\nNot only that, but the directory your executable lives in must not be writable by any yahoo. So you need similar permissions (unwritable by anyone) there.\nI think root is an exception. So if your executable and/or directory are owned by root, the permissions can be 'rwxr_xr_x', for example.\nNote that this conflicts with your script, which will try to write into the directory from which it was launched. I suspect that may be root (\"/\") for launchd. You should generally fully qualify file locations in such scripts.\nIt seems like that requirement bites me in the butt every time I mess with LaunchDaemons!

I want the dock to be in the middle and want all monitors to be arranged from left to right. I keep my dock on the left hand side of my monitor. So when I position my monitors left to right it moves to the most left monitor. \nIs there a way I can force the dock to stay on the middle monitor and not move to the left monitor?\nSoftware version 10.11.1\n\nA: Switch off 'Displays have separate Spaces' in System Prefs > Mission control.\n\nThen set the middle monitor to be the primary in\nSystem prefs > Displays > Arrangement\nby dragging the menu bar to that monitor  \n\nAfter the question edit -\nI'm afraid if you want the Dock on the left edge there is no way to achieve this. The above solution only applies if you have the Dock at the bottom, otherwise it has nowhere to 'sit' & will always go to the first 'edge' it can find, which in this case is the left side of the left monitor.\nYou could try looking at something like DragThing instead, which can be anchored anywhere. I actually anchor mine to the right of my left monitor on a 2-screen setup, which effectively puts it where the red bar is on this image.\nLate Edit\nDragThing, after 20 years of sterling service, will no longer be supported after Mojave & is no longer available for purchase.\n\n\nA: A slight modification of the workaround suggested by bjunix and the accepted answer is to put the right display in the Arrangement of Displays from System Preferences virtually at the bottom, like this\n.\nThen in System Preferences > Dock > Position on screen = Right will place the dock on the right of the screen which is physically in the middle.\nYou only need to remember that to move to the screen on the right mouse should go to the bottom of the main screen in the middle. It works for me, as I have two external monitors connected to a Mac book pro which is on the right and want the dock on the right of the biggest screen which is in the middle.\nI used to work with my Mac Book sitting on my desk, main external scree right behind it and the secondary external on the left in vertical position and was using laptop as a keyboard and the third screen in a layout exactly like shown in the picture (a bit unhealthy). Now with the laptop finally moved to a Kensigton stand with a wireless chargers on the right of the right screen I could not find a way to rearrange the screens in settings and keep the dock on the right of the main screen, so had to go with some \"faking\". So far, so good, it just gets only a little bit of time to get used to moving to the screen on the right by going \"down\".\n4 years have passed, macOS Catalina 10.15.5 and it is still all the same answer \"this is not possible\" and \"the computer says no\".\nI cannot believe this is not possible in Mac OS settings and not a property of the system dock and extra software is required to set such a simple thing. With large wide screens in the middle of the multi screen setups the dock at the bottom takes just too much estate and the side of the main middle display is the best place for it. It would be nice for Apple to listen to the users and accommodate this need.\n\nA: If you want to have your dock on the right or left side, there is an workaround to achieve this by arranging your monitors diagonally. It's not the best solution as you have to move your mouse to the corner of the screen to go to the other space but at least the dock is where you want it.\nCredit goes to this answer here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/252994/62200\n", "Q: Does Yosemite have a problem reaching alternate subnets? I know my question is a bit vague.  Read on.  \nI have a static route set in my Asus router to bridge from one subnet to another (downstream router).  My Mavericks machine can connect to devices (via a web browser pointing to a devices' IP address control panel; for instance, a Brother printer) on this other subnet just fine but all (and I've tested 4!) Yosemite machines cannot.  I have also found that a Windows 10 machine connects just fine.  These Macs are all connected to the main router via wifi, DHCP and all options in network settings appear to be identical.  It appears to me that something changed in Yosemite.  btw, ping results via Terminal are basically identical on Yosemite and Mavericks.  0% packet loss to one of the intended targets and 100% packet loss to an unused address in the downstream subnet.  The only differences are just some expected variations in the ping times.\nI have also found that a Lion computer (10.7.5) can also connect to the other subnet just fine.

But that only made the confusion worse.\nCommon answers were:\nNo, don't put screen , because:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is very little gap between Keyboard & Display and adding a screen guard in middle would put pressure on display\n\n*Adhesive on screen guard could damage the coating on Retina display (anti-reflective coating?)\n\n\nYes, put a screen guard:\n\n\n*It'll prevent dust scratches (dust on keyboard causing a scratch.\n\n*It'll prevent grease/acid on keyboard sticking to display thus preventing damage to reflective coating.\nBTW, 3. already happened to me. I recently got a very tiny dust scratch on my display, which is the reason why I've been thinking of putting a screen guard.\nAre there experienced summaries of the risks so I can make a decision on this?\n\nA: It's generally safe on Macs without an anti glare coating and generally a bad idea if you ever want to go without the cover or care if your anti glare coating gets damaged. \nYour Mac will have bigger problems than grease on the screen if you put it in bags where it gets pressure that causes the screen to touch the keys. I would avoid those situations or use a thin cloth on the keys if you are worried about grease transfer, grit and surface wear and abrasion on the glass.\nOptically, you can sacrifice brightness and resolution/quality with some films - even the best quality (3M brand come to mind) ones. Unless you need a privacy filter or just feel better with a screen protector, I would recommend taking other measures to counteract your various issues and leave the glass as Apple designed it.\nThe one benefit of a film is if the adhesive is done well, it can cover up a damaged anti glare coating and also take surface nicks, keyboard rub damage and protect the gas if you Carr your Mac closed in a backpack where it can be pressed or jostled. \nAlso, if you have wearing of the glass, I have seen Apple cover that under AppleCare - they chose and designed the coatings and surfaces and make tradeoffs between gaps and durability. If you expect a function like retina screen to endure normal use - that retina screen resolution is not functioning properly if the glass has become worn.\nI also have seen repairs declined to be covered under warranty (you can always pay for a cosmetic repair if you wish) when it's purely a cosmetic issue - not actually interfering with the proper function of the hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*Anti glare should last reasonably well\n\n*If there are no signs of damage or mis-alignment, gaps in the screen could either be covered or not covered.\n\n\nWithout knowing how you use the computer, it's hard to generalize what's the best tradeoff for your use case. Hopefully discussing your points helps you and others decide what to do.\n\nA: Most answers for this question are going to mainly opinion-based, but most will agree that reason 1 isn't true at all, (do you see a rubber lining run around the bezel of your MacBook screen?), and 2 usually only happens if you buy a cheap screen protector (a good one should cost more than $20).\nYou should be just fine if you buy a high-quality screen protector from a good source.\n", "Q: How to increase text font size system-wide on iOS?

Am guessing this is a more brute-force approach.\n\nA: You are gonna need a jailbroken iphone and Bytafont2 installed. \nhttp://ioshacker.com/how-to/change-system-wide-font-iphone-ipad-bytafont-2\n", "Q: Will it do any harm to cannibalise an old hard drive as an SSD enclosure? I have an old G-Tech Mini portable hard drive (FW800, bus-powered) that I don't need any more, so as an experiment I took the actual hard drive out and replaced it with a 512GB Crucial M4 SSD. I would like to use it as an external boot drive over FireWire 800 to speed up an old 2007 iMac.\nSo far, it seems to be running great! The drive shows up and is nice and fast. But I'm worried that this isn't a 'proper' hard drive enclosure - it could be that it was only designed to work with its original hard drive. I have no idea whether the SSD takes more or less power than the original drive. There is a very slight whining sound when the drive operates, but I can't remember if that was always there. The G-Tech drive was a model from about 5 years ago.\nI know that with FW800 and without TRIM I won't be getting the best performance out of the drive, but I'm not worried about that. I just need to know that the chassis won't do any physical damage by delivering the wrong voltage or whatever. Am I doing any harm to the drive and/or enclosure?\n\nA: The SSD draws a lot less juice from your power supply and doesn't produce as much heat as a spinning hard drive.  You could say your enclosure is quite over-engineered for your SSD.\nI would be concerned if you'd try the opposite (putting a spinning harddrive into a SSD enclosure).\nThat being said it would be better if you'd put the SSD directly into your iMac.  Or swap the drives.  It's not that difficult and you'll probably gain quite some speed.\n\nA: FireWire specifies a 30 volt and 1.5 amp bus (45 watts?! Holy Christmas!). In any case it appears the FireWire port has plenty of power for your drive, and Apple always was a fan of target disk and FireWire. \nIt does sort of beg the question as to why you're choosing to boot it externally and not mount it internally where you could get even better speeds from the SATA port, but all appears to be kosher. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro rapid battery degradation I recently acquired a second-hand (new, for me) MacBook Pro Retina Mid-2012 model. Also, in the near past, I upgraded it to El Capitan, and it is currently on OS X 10.11.1 (15B42).\nLast week, it worked flawlessly, and ran for several hours on its battery— until its battery suddenly stalled out charging at 59%, and it started immediately losing power when the the cord is disconnected.\nIn summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*The battery suddenly stopped charging, and was stuck at 59%, which has since decreased to 56%. \n\n*If I disconnect the charger, it shuts down immediately. \n\n*The battery status is \"Replace now\" even though it worked nominally last week and only reports having had 65 cycles. I believe it briefly read \"Service battery\" before that.\n\n\nI have reset both the NVRAM and the SMC twice apiece. I am going to try to scare up another charger next. Does anyone have any further suggestions to try before paying the money for a battery replacement?\nMy previous experience with old MacBook batteries has been that they have slowly degraded to the point that they would only hold a charge for a few minutes, rather than suddenly dropping from nominal performance to complete inability to charge the computer, so I suspect the issue is not an old battery, and paying to replace it may not fix the problem.\nI share the same problems with this question, however I don't have a warranty to fall back on:\nNew MacBook Pro slow performance, battery not working\n\nA: Most likely, the battery is the issue. However, there is no way a battery should last only 65 cycles before it died. Most likely you have a defective battery. \nEven if you don't have a warranty, Apple will probably give you a new battery if you complain, since the current battery died way before it should have. They usually cover obvious defects even if the computer is out of warranty.\nThe other possibility is that the previous owner had something done to the battery at some point, and the work was done incorrectly. 65 cycles seems abnormally low for a 2012 laptop, unless the previous owner never used the computer.\n", "Q: What is a quick way to duplicate a tab in Safari? Is there a quick way or shortcut to duplicate a tab in Safari?\n\nA: Safari 13.1 finally added Duplicate Tab functionality, in both the contextual menu on tabs and in the Window > Duplicate Tab menu.\nIt doesn't come with a keyboard shortcut by default, but you can create your own keyboard shortcut in Keyboard preferences. (Internet Explorer, where this feature seems to have originated, used ⌘ + K.)\n\nA: I have two alternatives:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Cmd+L (go the Location/Search field), then Cmd+Return.\n\n*Click the back button (<), then press Cmd while clicking the forward button (>).\n\n\nBoth of these will open a tab in the background. (Often, Cmd + click opens the click target's reference in a new tab.)\nIf you also press Shift while performing the second step of either of these alternatives, the tab will open in the foreground.\n\nA: Press Cmd+L (go the Location/Search field), then Cmd+Shift+Return to open the same page in a new tab.\n\nA: Hold cmd then press L, after that C, after that T, after that V and finally release cmd and press enter. Usually use this so i'm an expert in this and can do this under a milisec. :D Or you make an automator workflow with this.\n\nA: Run the following AppleScript via FastScripts, Keyboard Maestro, or other AppleScript-runner utility.\n# Duplicate Safari Tab next to itself.\nset js to \"\nvar docURL = document.URL;\nvar open_link = window.open('','_blank');\nopen_link.location=docURL;\n\"\ntell application \"Safari\"\n  tell front document\n    do JavaScript js\n  end tell\nend tell\n\nOr place this JavaScript in a bookmark on the Favorites Bar and access via ⌘⌥[0-9] or mouse-click.\njavascript:var%20docURL%20=%20document.URL;var%20open_link%20=%20window.open('','_blank');open_link.location=docURL;\n\n\nA: If you use this a lot i sugest that you change your Safari Settings under \"General\" you can set \"New Tabs open with:\" there you select \"Same Page\"\nNow you can just use Cmd-t for open tab an it opens op the same page.\n\nA: *\n\n*⌘ + L\n\n*⌘ + Enter\nHow it works: The first step \"Highlights the URL.\" (File > Open Location...). The second step \"Opens the URL in a new background tab.\"\nI'm usually a Chrome user, but I just tested it. It works on Safari, too. I can't find a reference for Safari, but here is that for Chrome. (under Mac > Address bar shortcuts)\nEdit: Trauts beat me to it while I was formatting the key glyph. Feel free to ignore my answer and upvote him!\n\nA: I believe that Tetsujin has the best answer (see above).\nI read the above tips and tried several. Not noticing his tip at first I accidentally found the same solution, but for it to work this way you must have Safari's preferences set appropriately.\nI am using El Capitan, OS X 10.11.1 and Safari 9.01. This tip works because we previously 1) opened Safari's Preferences dialog (Cmd/Comma), 2) selected the Tabs tab, 3) set the \"Open pages in tabs instead of windows\" drop-down list box to Automatically and 4) enabled the three check boxes just below that. What this does is mostly self-explanatory - text in the dialog box tells what each choice means.\nCmd/L, Cmd/Return - that's the entire tip!.  Simple isn't it?\nCmd/L means Open Location and has the effect of opening the current  URL in Safari's Smart Search field and selects it.\nCmd/Return means Open a page in a new tab. The URL in the Smart Search field opens in a new tab.\nYou can type this as 1) press\nCmd and hold it while 2) you press L then 3) release L and press Return. You then 4) release both the Cmd and Return keys and you are done.\nThese two sets of keypresses will create a duplicate of the tab you are on and make it active.\n\nA: If you don't want to use several key inputs there's a plugin for just duplication. I can't recall the name of it just now but I have used it before.\nEdit: Found a plugin that does what you're looking for, it's not the one I have personally used for a long time but still does what you want. Pugin: http://thiemo.ch/safari/\n\nA: cmd + [ to go back one page, then hold cmd and click the forward arrow to open a new tab of the page you were just on.\n\nA: The Tab Duplicator extension does the job, adding both the toolbar menu and an item in current page's context menu.\n", "Q: XAMPP error figuring out? I am using Google Drive to sync files for web projects that I am creating. I have a PC (Windows 7 and windows Vista) and a Mac (10.11.1).\nXAMPP allows you to run PHP programs and databases on your local machine. The problem is that when I edit a file on my windows machine and then go to my mac machine and try to load the file in the browser, XAMPP gives me this error...\nWarning: Unknown: failed to open stream: Permission denied in Unknown on line 0\n\nFatal error: Unknown: Failed opening required\n  '/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/drive/fireworks/fireworks.html'\n  (include_path='.:/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/lib/php') in Unknown\n  on line 0\n\nWhat does this mean? How can I fix it?\nThis problem is really annoying and I need to fix it because it is driving me nuts! If I change the file permissions, it will make it work until the next time I edit the file(s) on my windows machine.\n\nA: I believe that you have the key to the answer in your question. It is a permissions issue and there are at least two ways that you could fix it. Ultimately, though, it is likely that Google Drive owns the file and then when the web server in XAMPP tries to execute it, it is denied. Likely, the web server isn't even in the same group as GD and therefore the Unix permissions should end in at least 5. I suspect that setting the files to the infamous (and absolutely rightly so) 777 would correct the problem. A permissions number ending with 7 indicates that you are giving the public full access to read, write, and execute the script. \nFor a resolution, move to git. I'm not aware of anyone using Google Drive as a deployment strategy, although I'm sure someone has. I believe the most popular version control is Git, which would be good to learn anyway as you will need those skills if you work for a development shop. \nA second option would be to write a little bash or Apple script to change the file permissions.\n", "Q: no sound coming from external speakers, that are plugged into jack on my macbook pro haven't touched any settings, or downloaded any new software.

Yet, when I unplug it from the jack, the sound from the computer comes on (3 sec) later. I've been reading the different posts and trying to follow the steps that are given, but it's not working.\n\nA: You can try setting the sound output manually from system preferences.

And not sure it's normal but sections of Contacts are flickering.\nPossibly related question:  if I have to uninstall something potentially incompatible with El Capitan, how do I identify what that is?\nHistory: Thank you for the answer from Steve Chambers under \"My Finder is not responding and there are no documents on Desktop after downloading OS X Yosemite\". I had that same issue. I clicked to Relaunch Finder after pulling up the dialog via holding command + option. Then I powered off and rebooted in Safe Mode. \nThe end of the answer to the above issue included the suggestion there might be something incompatible with Yosemite that would need to be uninstalled--is this the same for El Capitan, and if so how does one know what to uninstall?\nNot sure how to describe it but while the desktop started to come back on, horizontal rows started to roll or scroll from bottom to top of the screen. Like a wave in a football stadium, only rolling south to north. This only happened while powering up.\nThe good news is my desktop files are back and Finder is available to me. And Safari works fine.\nScreen wave happened in Chrome as well. I uninstalled and downloaded Chrome again but it didn't help. The top tabs are shuddering and the pixels in the right scroll bar and any website page are rolling up a bit similarly to how my desktop screen acted upon powering up. But I'm okay using Safari.\n\nA: Are you sure this isn't a display issue? Plug in an external monitor. If you don't see the same \"wave\" and flickering on the external monitor, your built-in display may be flaking out. If you DO see the same weird display errors on the external monitor, then something else is wrong (perhaps an incompatibility, but something that is causing that much of a display mess is unlikely - possibly your video card is having issues).\nIf it is the internal display, sometimes very gently flexing the lid of your computer can temporarily fix this. Contact points between the display cable and the screen can become loose or break, causing weird display bugs like flickering or rolling lines. Wiggling the screen can put things back into contact - but this is not a permanent fix, you will eventually need to use an external display all the time or replace the laptop screen. (My old 2007 MBP started doing this a while ago - I was able to \"wiggle\" it into working again but do not trust that it will keep working much longer.)\n", "Q: Why does =$0 appear in Safari web inspector?

In Chrome and Safari, you can call the console from any of the other tabs by pressing \"Escape\" so you don't have to keep switching.\n\nsource: http://www.andismith.com/blog/2011/11/25-dev-tool-secrets/\n\nA: $0 - $4 The $0, $1, $2, $3 and $4 commands work as a historical reference to the last five DOM elements inspected within the Elements panel or the last five JavaScript heap objects selected in the Profiles panel. $0 returns the most recently selected element or JavaScript object, $1 returns the second most recently selected one, and so on.\n", "Q: How can I restore all files i deleted in the Applications floder? Actually, i just want to delete one file in the Application folder,but when i moved it to Trash, CleanMyMac notices me to use it to delete it clearly. \nHowever after i clicked yes, it deletes all items in the Application folder,including Office,i works and Adobe etc. \nI have re-installed the apps. But it seems the problem cannot be solved only by re-downloading the apps. \nFacetime cannot find the camera right now and there is no responses when i click the right bottom. \nIs there anyone can help me with this? \n\n\n\nA: Without being at the helm of your computer, I would advise a fresh installation. Reboot into recovery mode and reinstall OS X. This should restore all system files, and your personal files should not be effected.\nYou can boot into recovery mode a number of ways. One would be to hold alt at boot, then select your Recovery HD. In some instances, an OS X user may not have this drive. Instead, you may want to try Command+Option+R for Internet recovery.\nA program like PhotoRec, which comes bundled with TestDisk. http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Download\nIt runs in Terminal, but you would be able to select your drive and recover all files. Note that any files that have been overwritten since they were deleted (which is very likely) will not be recoverable.\n", "Q: Photo stream or camera roll I would like to delete either camera roll or photo stream, but, am afraid of losing pics altogether. Camera roll being original and stream copies if I understand correctly. Therefore would seem deleting stream would be the route. But would that also take my originals?\nI cannot delete or rename albums. What is the solution.\nHave iOS 9.1\n\nA: Photo stream is your cloud backup, whereas Camera Roll is directly on your device. So, in short, delete the photo stream. You can completely disable the cloud backup in your settings so it won't keep reappearing.\n", "Q: Copy and Store notes on iCloud and device I have all my notes now stored on my iCloud but I also wish to copy and store them on my device. Can I do this?\n\nA: Once on iCloud, any other device with access to iCloud can store these files locally.\nFor OS X, go to System Preferences, sign in, and check notes.\nFor Windows, download iCloud for Windows: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204283\nFor an iPhone, sign into your iCloud account, then in settings, be sure that Notes is checked.\nThis should keep you in sync, and each device will store the notes locally as well.\n", "Q: Mac won't boot Windows partition after using disk utility I needed more space on my Windows partition...

OS X still boots, but how can I fix my Windows partition without reinstalling Windows and losing all my data? \n\nA: The following worked for me.  I have macOS 10.12.3 and Windows 10.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Recovery mode (restart, hold \"command+R\")\n\n*Utilities -> terminal\n\n*Run \nfdisk -e /dev/disk0\"\np\nsetpid 4\n[press enter]\nflag 4\np\nwrite\ny\n\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nA: The Terminal commands below has been proven to work in this situation. It's a fix within the last year from someone with the same problem. Disk Utility and Boot Camp were never designed to cooperate. Unfortunately, they aren't labelled at all to prevent this kind of event from taking place.\nFor future reference, I believe the way to resize the partition is to do so in Boot Camp Assistant. Since you already did it, however, you'll need to adjust your partition manually in order to get it booting again. Of course, replace disk0 with your disk number which you can find in Disk Utility.\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/6465316\n\nsudo fdisk -e /dev/disk0\np\nsetpid 4\n07\nflag 4\np\nwrite\ny\n\nNow Reboot and hold the ALT key and check if Windows shows up and is\n  bootable.

If you notice\n  the difference between the Disk Utility screen (two partitions) vs the\n  fdisk output (or the GPT) there are 'hidden' partitions and the MBR\n  partitioning style used for Windows allows a maximum of 4 partitions.\n  If you need further explanation, read the original thread.   Yosemite\n  should not be installed on any machine that is critical to you. If\n  only partitioning was done, but Yosemite was NOT installed, you are in\n  better shape. Yosemite ignores and is unaware of bootcamp and creates\n  an additional Recovery HD and moves things around.\n\n", "Q: How to get back all iMessages into newly installed OS X El Capitan? This is not related to the broken Messages app. \nAfter I formatted my drive, installed clean El Capitan and received a code on my iPhone I can send iMessages from my Mac. Messages are received by my contacts and I can also see them on my phone.\nThe problem is that I would like to see all existing (previous) messages I have on my phone, again in my Messages.app. That is, everything I wrote before formatting the drive.\nI haven't made any backups. I thought that simply everything will be synchronised like Contacts etc.\nCurrently only newly created messages are visible. Since yesterday, I've been reading a bunch of topics. Is this normal? Or am I missing something? As I said, it doesn't look like a sync issue since the new messages are working.\n\nA: Since you formatted your drive, your old messages will no longer exist on your computer. Unfortunately, iCloud does not sync iMessages with OS X as of this time. You also can't sync up using iTunes either. It's possible that you could extract them from your phone, but you wouldn't be able to simply put them back into the app again.\nIn the future, should you reformat, you should backup your user's library folder as this contains most customizations you have set for your apps, along with the iMessages you had before.\nEven if you had made a backup, however, the structure of messages will likely change over time and I know some folks even from Yosemite were unable to simply pass these files from a backup to El Capitan.\n", "Q: Disable automatic \"ligature\" handling in PDF/Preview on El Capitan I may have found a serious bug in EC...\nAs a college student I frequently need to copy and paste short passages out of PDF documents into other documents (e.g. for quoting). Previously, on Yosemite, I simply used Preview to do this. Preview is awesome because its AI algorithms almost always properly determine where paragraph breaks are. Just about every other PDF viewer I've used simply puts hard returns at every visual line break in the PDF.\nOn EC however, certain common \"ligature\" characters (i.e. two or more characters rendered together, such as \"Th\", \"ffi\", \"ff\", \"fi\", \"ft\" - these are the ones I've found so far) end up copying as blank spaces. In other words, if I have a PDF containing text that reads:\n\"This is different from those who can afford to pay for college first; such students may find it less difficult by at least fifty percent.\"\n\nI'll get this output when I copy and paste this text:\n\" is is di erent from those who can a ord to pay for college  rst; such students may  nd it less di cult by at least   y percent.\"\n\nThis is clearly not the desired output!\nWhen I slowly select the text character by character I can clearly see that the selection is moving over all of the letters in the ligature at the same time - in other words, it is treating the ligature as if it is one character. \nI tested the PDF on a lab machine at school which is still running Yosemite and it did not exhibit this behavior so this is very definitely a bug introduced in EC. \nIs there a setting perhaps via defaults that I can use to completely disable this behavior? \n(As a side note, I found out this bug after turning in a paper and having a professor ask why my quotes looked so funny... I didn't proofread as carefully as I should have, but still.)\n\nA: Are you sure it isn't a simple font substitution error? What font is the PDF rendered in? Do you have that font installed? Does the lab machine have it installed? Does the document you are pasting into use the same font as the source PDF?\nI did a simple test using your sample text, placed in a Word document (with ligatures enabled), then saved as a PDF using either Apple's in-built PDF or Acrobat Pro.\nThe original text, cut and pasted from Word:\n“This is different from those who can afford to pay for college first; such students may find it less difficult by at least fifty percent.”\nApple PDF, cut and pasted from Preview:\n“This is different from those who can afford to pay for college first; such students may find it less difficult by at least fi,y percent.”\nAdobe PDF, cut and pasted from Preview:\n“This is different from those who can afford to pay for college first; such students may find it less difficult by at least fi�y percent.”\nAdobe PDF, cut and pasted from Acrobat Pro:\n“This is different from those who can afford to pay for college first; such students may find it less\ndifficult by at least fiy percent.”\nAll of the above attempts pasted correctly, with the exception of the \"fty\" ligature, which differed in rendering based upon the PDF creation and rendering method(s) used. This character likely didn't translate correctly into plain text because I have enabled more than just basic ligatures in Word (optional and discretionary, but not historical).\nAll in all, it looks to me to be nothing but a font encoding or substitution error. Remember that a PDF document will have any necessary font characters embedded in the file itself, but when pasting, the target font will not necessarily match the source, especially if you are using a system with a clean install (meaning fewer fonts).\n\nA: This is not so much a bug as a fact of glyph encoding in PDFs. There are two data elements here: the text letters that make up the ligature, and the ligature glyph itself. \nWhen text appears in a TextEdit or Word document, the underlying data maintains the fi pair of characters, but displays them as one glyph: the ligature. If the font doesn't have the ligature character, then you see both letters separately.\nWhen a PDF is made, the display glyph is used, but the underlying pair of 'real letters' is not maintained within the data. PDF was designed as a description of displayed content.\nAny PDF that contains an alternative glyph or ligature may not display the correct data when the text is copied and pasted, unless there's a hidden text layer that contains the 'correct' lettering.\n", "Q: How to bring OS X native Digital Camera RAW support from 10.11 El Capitan to 10.9 Mavericks?

This is unavoidable if you are not willing to upgrade. For what it's worth, every older system that I have upgraded to El Capitan has seen some performance increases, in at least one case it was a significant bump in usability (early unibody MacBook that was barely usable in Yosemite is working beautifully in El Capitan).\nDo a full system backup and give the newer OS a shot. It is difficult but not impossible to downgrade. If you can swap in a spare hard drive, and install from there, you won't risk your current setup just to check whether you can live with the changes implemented in 10.11.\n", "Q: I got purple border on my Photos app window I got a purple warning border of some sort on my OS X Photos app.\nIt was described in this Apple Support community thread and got a solution.

This feature allows developers to debug their application's layout problems.\nAutolayout and Constraints\nConstraint based layout is a mechanism Apple recommends developers use to craft their user interfaces. The mechanism is often called Autolayout in developer documentation.\nAutolayout is tough to get right. It is possible to have constraints that conflict. Apple have added numerous features to help flag these conflicts and to help developer's fix them.\nThe NSConstraintBasedLayoutVisualizeMutuallyExclusiveConstraints flag is one such tool to aid developers.\n\nNot Intended for Users\nI presume you did not enable NSConstraintBasedLayoutVisualizeMutuallyExclusiveConstraints yourself. Preassuming this, it suggests Photos.app's engineers have an autolayout bug or that some other process has enabled this flag on Photos.app.\nEither way, the purple interface was rightly concerning as a user. No user should ever see, or need, this debugging tool. Somewhere a mistake was made or a bug exists within OS X.\nSafe to Disable\nThe suggested solution in the discussion thread deletes any value associated with NSConstraintBasedLayoutVisualizeMutuallyExclusiveConstraints.

How do I go about getting a new charger? My MacBook Pro mid-2015 charger mysteriously* stopped working today. I have AppleCare but I live in Ireland and there are no Apple Stores here.\nCan I go into an Apple authorised reseller and get a new charger for free because I have AppleCare?\nIf not, what's the process?\n*I thought I saw a spark in my room 2 days ago. I was falling asleep at the time. I got up, checked the plugs and unplugged everything in the room (including my MacBook). I can't remember if I've charged the laptop since then though.\n\nA: You can always initiate service from https://locate.apple.com and choose your provider of choice. The online self service is much, much better now, so starting with Apple support is often the fastest way for you to get things through the hoops and to a technician to do the exchange for you if a mail in exchange isn't offered.\nIn your case, you can direct the service to Ireland at https://locate.apple.com/ie/en/ and just click the box that says service.\n\nNot all resellers also provide service, so doing a little digging usually saves you a trip and some time.\n\nA: AppleCare does include replacing broken chargers.

Today I tried to plug it into my work PC to get some files off it (Windows 8), and it wasn't recognized. I tried to look up how to reformat it, but realized it was going to delete my files. So, I decided to forget that idea and plugged it back into my Mac. Now, it won't run, and Disk Utility says that the Partition Type is Microsoft Reserved.\nIt won't let me repair or verify in the Disk Utility because it says \"ERROR: Partition map check failed because no slices were found.\"\nNow, I can't access my files on either computer, which has like my life's worth of photos on it. I am about to have a heart attack if I've lost all of my data! I've been searching online and have seen many things where it says to create new partitions, but from what I understand that will delete all the data on the existing drive, which I don't want to do because I obviously don't have it backed up anywhere else (because this external hard drive WAS my backup).\nPlease, someone out there help me!!\nMacBook Pro, OS X Yosemite (10.10.3)\n\nA: Ugh - the main thing with \"your life's work of photos\" is to slow down and don't panic.

Enter diskutil cs list and copy the Logical Volume UUID. Then enter: diskutil cs revert LVUUID. Some CoreStorage LVs aren't revertible.

It treats scan as \"check all channels\" and may not even obey restrictions if you set them by hook or crook on which channels are allowed on the interface. It allows you to pre-filter by SSID name as opposed to channel:\nairport --scan=whatever\n\nFor sniffing, you can use the Wireless Diagnostics application, but it's not command line based/enabled as far as I can tell.\n\nOnce you start the program, look in the Window menu for the options available on your OS (the tool is improving over time IMO with more features and capabilities).\nYou are right and the authors of the airport manual page agree that \"airport more information needed here\"\n", "Q: Apple Watch Not Allowed to be Activated by New Owner I recently purchased a used Apple Watch.

When you boot to Recovery HD, you should also have about 15 lines of df output with devices running from disk0 to disk12 or more (it varies between OS X 10.8 and 10.11).\nIn your example, if you want to wipe all contents on what's normally named Macintosh HD and in your case is disk0s2/Macintosh Hard Drive - you could issue the command:\ndiskutil eraseVolume JHFS+ Macintosh\\ HD disk0s2\n\nThe \\ is needed to escape the space between \"Macintosh HD\" - quotes would work as well if you prefer that. I would just use Disk Utility to erase the volume and rename it Macintosh HD since that is far easier, there in the main menu of items, and doesn't need any care with spaces, quotes or messing up the disk0s2 and erasing the wrong area of the drive.\nThe reinstallation problem might be solved by erasing the storage, but that's probably a better stand alone question.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904\nThe above article walks you through how to use Recovery HD to erase and start over if that's your eventual goal.\n", "Q: How can I tell what version of Recovery HD OS is running while I'm booted to the recovery software?

Does the Pencil by FiftyThree work with the new drawing features in Apple’s Notes app in iOS 9?\nApple Notes app is not listed on their list of compatible apps.\nThe vendor offers a software development kit (SDK) for apps to integrate Pencil functionality. That suggests apps not using that SDK will not work with Pencil.\n\n\nA: Yes - it works very well on all iOS devices up to and including the iPad Pro. The Pro does some special refresh rate enhancements with Apple's Pencil that you won't get full advantage of, but this stylus is very nice and I think some will prefer it's ergonomics over the faster response of the pencil.\nFrom https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/ this is explained as follows:\n\nWhen iPad Pro senses Apple Pencil, the subsystem scans its signal at an astounding 240 times per second, giving it twice the data points it normally collects with your finger.\n\nSo, your finger, the Paper by 53 pencil hardware and other stylus will be scanned at 120 times per second.\nThe other important feature that the Paper stylus and Apple Pencil share is that they communicate angle data to the iPad via Bluetooth. Apple's notes read that information in the notes app, but Apple's notes app do not read angle data from the Pencil hardware, so it's more like your finger with no additional bluetooth data for the Paper SDK.

Can't restart because lock button is broken I'm trying to fix my brother's phone. The screen is completely unresponsive. I tried swiping around to try getting the passcode wrong to see if it would vibrate to no avail. The phone's lock button is broken, so I can't restart it that way, and it was never used with a computer, so when I tried to plug it in and fix it that way, iTunes asks me to confirm that I want to allow this device access by clicking something on the phone (which obviously I cannot do). I read somewhere that the LCD connector may be loose. Could this be the problem? Is there any way to fix this? Thank you!\n\nA: It sounds a lot like that to me. You could disconnect and reconnect the LCD cable yourself, if you are comfortable with opening up the iPhone. You would need a special iPhone screwdriver (one with 5-point star tip, AKA pentalobe), which can really only be found online.\nYou could also take it in to a repair shop, if any are around you, but whatever you choose don't over pay, as a working iPhone 4s is only worth around $100.\n", "Q: Time machine: moving a source external disk to a new computer I have two external 4TB disks, one for data and the other for TM backups. I recently moved from a MBP2010 (10.8.4) to a MBP2012 (10.10.5, fresh install).\nOn the backup drive, TM adds a root folder for the new machine, and that's fine. But it doesn't recognize the data disk, wanting to back it up from scratch.\nThere are many posts about TM behavior, but I haven't seen anything about this scenario. Yet there's a ton of people who use large external drives for data. Everyone has to wipe their backup and start anew when they migrate?\n(PS I'm fully aware that the backup media is too small and if my 4TB data disk reaches closer to capacity I'll have to get a large backup drive.)\n\nA: To make sure I understand - you have one external HD for data, plugged into your new computer, that was previously attached to your OLD computer - and you backed up your old computer + this drive to a second Time Machine drive?\nTime Machine is not recognizing the old archive because the new machine is a fresh install. So it made a new backup. The data drive (which you state is being seen as a \"new drive\") would have been part of that old machine backup - Time Machine should recognize things on a per-computer, not per-drive basis. Unless you tell your new machine to inherit the old backup, the existing backup of your data disk will be ignored as well, and a new backup will be created with that disk as part of your current computer backup.\nSSDs are great but the lack of cheap internal storage means more people have to use external disks for data. Cloud isn't a good alternative for everyone. Unfortunately the backup systems designed by Apple are not treating externals as separate backups - they are included as part of the internal mounted disk hierarchy of your computer.\n", "Q: How do I remove multiple owners from a file/folder? While trying to set up MAMP/PHPStorm, I CHOWNed the OWNER of my Sites folder to _www from myUser. Since this did not resolve the problem I was experiencing, I attempted to CHOWN myUser /Users/myUser/Documents/Sites... which worked, except Get Info shows both as owners, and ls -l reports _www as the (primary?) owner. I could not modify the folder contents, even though myUser is one of the owners.\nWhen I ls -leO@ as suggested in this answer, I see the following:\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 31 _www  wheel  -  1054 Dec 5 12:38 Sites\n  0: user:myUser allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,\n  writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity\n\nI sudo chown :staff Sites thinking this will give myUser more clout, and then sudo chown myUser: Sites which works in removing _www, but I'm left with:\nMacBook-Pro:Documents myUser$ ls -leO@\n...\ndrwxr-xr-x+ 31 myUser  staff  -  1054 Dec 5 12:38 Sites\n  0: user:myUser allow list,add_file,search,add_subdirectory,delete_child,readattr,\n  writeattr,readextattr,writeextattr,readsecurity\n...\n\nI've read the MAN page for CHMOD and ACL as suggested in this answer, and I've tried chmod -a#0 Sites and variations with no success.

The next screen should give you a list of options.\n\n*UITS recommends making the USB drive installer first. You don't need to install Windows or download the support software at this time, as it will be easier to do both later. To proceed:\n a. Verify that the USB drive you will be writing to is plugged in.\n b. Uncheck the Install Windows 7 or later version and Download the latest Windows support software from Apple options.\nc.

My wife and I have different iCloud accounts. We would like to have the photos from all our iPhones (I have 2) to be combined in a single location. Is there any way to do this? I had thought we could use the Google or Dropbox uploaders, but it seems that they don't run in the background. \nWe've tried family sharing and have had issues with it. Specifically, we don't reliably see photos from all devices, we don't get images from our digital cameras unless we import them into a Mac, and it's not clear how to export all of the family sharing photos to an archive.\n\nA: Use Google Photos. This being a fairly new app, it did not exist at the time this question was asked. \nGoogle photos is a new (free!) service that allows you to upload all your photos to Google Drive, automatically. You can also share all your photos with anybody you want, using the new Share Your Library feature. \nYou can download the app from the App Store, or access them on your computer. There's also a desktop uploader in case you want to upload photos on your computer automatically.\nThe best part about this app is that it allows you to delete all the photos you uploaded from your phone, freeing up storage space on your phone. Your photos will still be available through the Google Photos app.\n", "Q: DuckDuckGo settings in iPhone & iPad I have DuckDuckGo installed as my default search engine in Safari on both my iPhone 6 and iPad mini 2 (both iOS 9.1).

Is this a known bug, and if so, is there a solution for it?\n\nA: On your iPhone and iPad, Go into Settings → Safari → Block Cookies, and choose an option other than Always Block. Your settings should then save.\nYou could also enable Cloud Save to sync your settings across your browsers and devices. The option is available through the same hamburger menu under Settings, and is not associated with a username or a personally-identifiable value.\n", "Q: installing homebank with brew while installing homebank software I am getting error \n\nError: You must `brew link intltool xz' before homebank can be\n  installed\n\nMacBook-Pro:/ Sarfaraz$ ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\" < /dev/null 2> /dev/null\n\nMacBook-Pro:/ Sarfaraz$ brew install homebank\n==> Installing dependencies for homebank: pkg-config, intltool, xz, gettext, libffi, glib, jpeg, libtiff, libpng, gobject-introspection, gdk-pixbuf, atk,\n==> Installing homebank dependency: pkg-config\n==> Downloading http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/releases/pkg-config-0.28.tar.gz\n######################################################################## 100.0%\n==> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/pkg-config/0.28 --disable-host-tool --with-internal-glib --with-pc-path=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/share/pkg\n==> make\n==> make check\n==> make install\n  /usr/local/Cellar/pkg-config/0.28: 10 files, 600K, built in 2.9 minutes\n==> Installing homebank dependency: intltool\n==> Downloading https://launchpad.net/intltool/trunk/0.51.0/+download/intltool-0.51.0.tar.gz\n######################################################################## 100.0%\n==> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/intltool/0.51.0 --disable-silent-rules\n==> make install\nError: The `brew link` step did not complete successfully\nThe formula built, but is not symlinked into /usr/local\nCould not symlink share/man/man8/intltool-extract.8\n/usr/local/share/man/man8 is not writable.\n\nYou can try again using:\n  brew link intltool\n==> Summary\n  /usr/local/Cellar/intltool/0.51.0: 19 files, 224K, built in 16 seconds\n==> Installing homebank dependency: xz\n==> Downloading https://fossies.org/linux/misc/xz-5.2.1.tar.gz\n######################################################################## 100.0%\n==> ./configure --disable-silent-rules --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/xz/5.2.1\n==> make install\nError: The `brew link` step did not complete successfully\nThe formula built, but is not symlinked into /usr/local\nCould not symlink lib/pkgconfig/liblzma.pc\n/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig is not writable.\n\nYou can try again using:\n  brew link xz\n==> Summary\n  /usr/local/Cellar/xz/5.2.1: 59 files, 1.6M, built in 117 seconds\n==> Installing homebank dependency: gettext\n==> Downloading http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gettext/gettext-0.19.4.tar.xz\n######################################################################## 100.0%\n==> ./configure --disable-silent-rules --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/gettext/0.19.4 --with-included-gettext --with-included-glib --with-included-libcroco --with-in\n==> make\n==> make install\n==> Caveats\nThis formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local.\n\nMac OS X provides similar software, and installing this software in\nparallel can cause all kinds of trouble.\n\nOS X provides the BSD gettext library and some software gets confused if both are in the library path.\n\nGenerally there are no consequences of this for you.

This is 10 times more then all the App update, OSX Update and iCloud Data combined !!!\nIs this a bug or have i been hacked? I send a support letter to Apple and no response. \n\nA: Whatsapp was causing it. Whatsapp's internal backup system to iCloud Drive. If you have have your Mac setup to sync with iCloud, it will prefetch all iCloud drive content to your Mac as cache, which includes your Whatsapp Backup. Since your whatsapp backup are constantly renewed, the Mac will constantly have to fetch the newer version. \nFor me the Whatsapp backup was 5GB, which is why it easily consume all your bandwith. This problem could also be the same for any other Apps that backup to iCloud. Disable the Whatsapp Internal iCloud Drive backup was the solution, as whatsapp itself is backed up when you do full iPhone Backup to iCloud.\nProblem has been reported to both Apple and Whatsapp few weeks after this post, in 2016 i tested it and the problem was still there. Not sure about it now.\n", "Q: Added IFTTT Reminders channel, and now all my Reminders are gone I hope this is an appropriate question for here...\nYesterday, I received \"Automatic\" for my birthday (the gadget that connects a phone to a car). I got it all set up, then added the Automatic channel in IFTTT and started browsing recipes. I discovered an automatic to iOS Reminders recipe I liked, so I added the iOS Reminders channel as well.\nThe next time I opened my Reminders app, perhaps an hour later, all my reminder lists and contained reminders were gone!\nI managed to confirm that my icloud account still has all the reminders. They're just not syncing with my phone anymore.\nI tried removing the IFTTT Reminders channel. I tried turning reminder sync off and on multiple times. When I tried to create a new reminder and/or reminder list, nothing happens (I touch the plus in the reminders app and the app does not respond in any way). I can search reminders and view an empty \"schedule\" in the reminders app, so it's not frozen.\nI have a 4S running iOS 7.\nUPDATE:\nA few other symptoms or possibly helpful details I discovered since I first posted the question:\n\n\n*\n\n*2 of my icloud settings in the settings app had flipped from how I had them: the iCloud Keychain turned on and find my iphone was turned off. These were previously set the opposite ways.\n\n*If I turn off icloud reminders sync, an orange reminders list appears in the app and I am able to create new lists. But if I turn it back on, the orange reminders list disappears and I'm unable to create new lists.\n\n*All my calendar settings were scrambled. Many of the custom colors I'd set we're changed, as were which calendars were selected to be visible.\n\n*I believe this is unrelated, but I figure I should mention for full disclosure that I changed my default email in the settings app from an icloud address to my me.com address.\n\n*My default reminder list was changed from my \"Reminders\" list to my \"Recurring\" list (arbitrary names of my reminder lists)\n\n*Proximitask lost all of its links to various reminders\n\n\nI temporarily fixed the sync issue using the following method:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the calendar app\n\n*Tap \"calendars\" at the bottom\n\n*Pull the calendars down to refresh. This will refresh your reminders as well.\n\n*Open the reminders app and all your reminders should be back.\n\n\nHowever, the issue recurred and spread to my iCloud calendars.  I noticed this morning that all my iCloud calendars had vanished.  I had discovered this by asking Siri to create a reminder and she responded with:\n\nThe calendar that tracks your reminders doesn't support location-based\n  reminders.\n\nI tried the same method of refreshing the calendars, but it did not (at least immediately) work as had happened with the reminders before.  I tried a few times, then started poking around in the settings, but I didn't change anything.  I noted that nothing was mixed up with iCloud's settings.  When I went back to the calendar app, all the calendars were back and I was able to create a location-based reminder.\nSo I guess my question has changed from how to fix this problem to how to prevent it from recurring.  What is causing these new sync issues?\nMore details on automatic and IFTTT\nI had removed the IFTTT iOS Reminders channel.  Could it have something to do with the Automatic app itself?\nI have 2 other channels I added on Sunday when this started: PushBullet and Launch Center.  I have 3 new recipes I added for Automatic: car on notification, car off - push(bullet) me a map, and email me a diagnostic if the car has an issue.\nUPDATE 2\nA new detail... My reminders created on my iPhone were not syncing with my iCloud account - nor were reminders created on other devices synced to the iPhone.  I tried creating new reminders, marking reminders as done, and deleting old reminder on my iPhone and they did not sync.  I confirmed that my iPhone was connected to the same account as my other devices.  I logged onto icloud.com and confirmed that the reminder changes are not there, and I used Find My iPhone and it confirmed where my phone was.  Refreshing my calendars did not work this time, but rebooting and then refreshing my calendars on my iPhone did.\n\nA: I fixed it! All you have to do is make sure reminder sync is on in Settings->icloud, then open your calendar app, tap calendars at the bottom, and pull the calendars down to refresh. This will refresh your reminders as well. Open the reminders app and all your reminders should be back.\nNote, I had also tried all the things in the question before doing this, so I don't know if any of those actions are required beforehand.\nAlso note, you'll probably get an idea as to whether this will work for you or not if all your calendar settings are scrambled, as mine were. Many of the custom colors I'd set we're changed, as were which calendars were selected to be visible. Other clues are in my comments under the question, such as changes in my icloud settings and the inability to create new reminders & reminder lists.\nOne other thing I changed that I believe is unrelated, but I figure I should mention for full disclosure is, I changed my default email in the settings app from an icloud address to my me.com address.\n", "Q: How to remove Linux from my Mac?

How many times should I do that?\nWhat are the general recommendations for keeping the battery life as long as possible?\n\nA: The battery include a so-called \"fuel gauge\" chip that keeps track of the charge level, health status and individual cell balance. This chips is providing the battery level measurement that is displayed by OS X. As a result, you may install a new battery without consideration of its current charge level -- whatever the charge level actually is, it will be correctly reported by the battery chip to the OS.\nAs for all LiPo batteries, the main recommendation is to avoid regular deep discharges. There is no memory effect -- deep discharges degrade the chemistry and reduce the battery life, so try to keep your computer plugged as often as practical. An exception to this rule would be long-term storage of the computer. In this case, a charge level of about 50% is preferred (as per Apple recommendations).\n", "Q: Headless Mac mini: Share Screen + FileVault At the office we have a Mac mini that will be used to run a Teamcity agent. It is a requirement from our security department that we enable FileVault on this machine.\nI will also need to manage remotely (via Screen Sharing) this Mac mini from my laptop. I don't want to have to plug in a monitor + mouse + keyboard to manage the build agent.\nOn this Mac mini, we have 2 accounts: 1 admin account, and 1 teamcity account (standard user). Since the plist file that will run the agent is located in /Users/teamcity/Library/LauchAgents, I currently need to log in (via the login screen) as teamcity for the agent to start.\nMy problem is that after I restart the Mac mini, I can't \"Share Screen\" with the Mac mini.\nThe only solution around this that I found is to manually log in (from the login screen) to the teamcity account. Of course, I don't want to have to plug in a keyboard + monitor to start the agent.\nMy question is: how can I remotely \"Share Screen\" to a FileVault-enabled Mac, if the target user (teamcity) is not logged in?\n\nA: Other answers here are correct - it is not possible to remotely access a freshly-booted Mac with FileVault enabled without physical access (FileVault operates 1 layer closer to actual software than a 'traditional' BIOS or firmware password).\nIt is, however, possible to remotely reboot a Mac and force it to allow remote access even with FileVault enabled, provided you issue the correct command:\nsudo fdesetup authrestart\n\nApple calls this 'Authenticated Restart' official semi-documentation is available here, with a more in-depth view from C|Net gives a high-level description of its workings.\nNote that if a Mac is not restarted with this command (a regular restart, powerloss, or otherwise), physical access will be needed to access the Mac. The command also (obviously) requires admin privileges to run.\n\nA: You will need to attach actual hardware to login on a Mac with FileVault encryption enabled. You can not set the machine to automatically login (see Apple Support)\nThe machine requires that you enter the password very early in the boot process, I believe before it mounts the hard drive, so you can not use Remote Desktop or Screen Sharing to login.\n\nA: It is possible, but not with OS X alone.\nI had the same issue.. I wanted remote access (or, actually I only had remote access), but I also wanted the security of an encrypted disk.\nSo long as you don't ever need to use mac os locally, there is a relatively easy solution which I used:\n1. Wipe out OS X and install VMWare ESXi Server.\n2. Install OS X inside of that.\nNow you can log into the virtual \"physical\" console from the VMWare web interface and enter the boot password there.  After that, you can use the VMWare console, or you can use the normal apple VNC tool, etc.  \nUsing ESXi actually gives a lot of advantages if you only have remote access (like the ability to restart the machine easily without worrying if it will reconnect or not, the ability to make snapshots, etc.) - but it also means that the local console will be limited to a very simple terminal, so basically useless to do anything other than find the virtual machine's IP address or do maintenance work.  \n\nA: Building on the other answers... Here's an option that could work: You could boot from an external or second drive that does not have FileVault enabled but contains an OS with screen sharing enabled.

Our source for hosting the code is multiple paid, private repos on GitHub.\nIs there anything that I can try to speed up git operations? It doesn't seem to matter which operation it is, they are all slow.\nI was told to ask this question here as opposed to Stack Overflow.\n\nA: Run git gc once a while to speed up things (if you haven't set it to be automatically on)\n\nA: Turns out the answer to this was to disable my WebRoot software.

(probably irrelevant: The server came with an administrator account for my Aunty in her name that I haven't gotten rid of)\nAfter upgrading I created a new account for myself (Derwent) from the administrator account with (Admin access, local authentication) and signed in with my Apple ID, then enabled SMB and AFP File Sharing for all accounts, ensuring my account, Derwent had access to a folder called Movies.\nI could access this share remotely using SMB and AFP with the guest account, and with the administrator account, using terminal and Finder but no matter what I did, I couldn't access it using Derwent. I could also access my MBPr from my mini using Guest, Administrator and local authentication just fine.\nI created a new standard account test with the password test, so that I was sure that I was getting the password correct, (this account was not signed in to any apple ID) and still it wouldn't work.\nHere are some dumps of my console with different access methods.\nBrowsing to the share in Finder directly, and using \"Connect as\"\nGet error message: Access to your account on the server “minimac” has been denied.\nConsole dump on server end:\nDec  1 00:24:53 minimac kdc[232]: Got a

if the SMB-ACL group (com.apple.access_smb) includes the affected users or one of their groups. This group is a system group that is hidden by default in the Groups view of the Server app (show them using \"Show system accounts\" in the context menu).\nSee this answer for Monterey.\n\nA: In fact, in my case it was definitely the missing entry in the SMB Access List Group. Technically, when you select Options... and then add a user to the SMB-List there, it should automatically add that to the SMB Access List Group. But in my case it didn't. When I opened the \"Groups\" in \"Directory Editor\" of the Directory Utility and checked for SMB, I saw that the user in question was not listed there.\nAfter adding the user to the group, it worked flawlessly.\n", "Q: Touch LCD with Mac Mini I bought my first Mac Mini today. I'm using touch screen LCD PL2735M (http://www.iiyama.com/gb_en/products/prolite-t2735msc-2/). When I click on screen, mouse is moved to that place, but no click is issued. Is there any touch settings? (sensitivity, calibration). Thank you.\n\nA: This might help...  when using a trackpad on a MacBook, tapping does not, by default, click the mouse...   there is a setting (System Preferences -> Trackpad -> Tap to click) that must be enabled.   \nYou might try checking for that...  or something similar, to enable \"tap to click\" for the monitor (if possible).   I can't say 100% this will work, as I've never seen a touch screen used with a Mac... however hopefully this helps.\n\n\nA: WARNING: UNTESTED ADVICE INBOUND\nIt appears this question was asked on Apple's forum a while ago. Most touch screens report as a mouse to the OS, and then require special drivers to do anything fancy. Implementation obviously varies.\nThe first recommended set of drivers is from touch-base, though it appears they haven't released anything since 2012, so I'd be wary.\nI also found eGalax, which claims to work with OS X 10.10 and was released in April of this year. I downloaded, but did not install the .zip file, and their documentation appears very professional and straightforward. Their code is not open source, though, so installing their software may (but probably won't) steal all your credit card numbers or post a digitally-altered sex tape of you to the internet.\nAs always, you're taking advice from a stranger on the internet who is claiming to not know about the thing they are telling you to install. Your mileage may vary, be smart about what you install and give your password to, wear protection, kids eat free on Tuesdays, etc.\n", "Q: Will I have to pay for photos sent if my friend has switched iMessage off? Both my friend and I have iPhone 6 and we iMessage often.  I just sent him three photos but it seems he has switched iMessage off for some reason as the text I sent has delivered as green instead of blue and I didn't get 'delivered' or 'read.' \nI just want to know if I'll now have to pay for sending those photos as I always do whenever I send photos to non iPhone users?\n\nA: Yes, I expect that you will. \nIf a message cannot be sent as an iMessage (blue) for any reason - e.g. the recipient does not have an iMessage capable device, they have turned iMessage off, or you do not have a data connection over which to send it, it will go as an SMS or MMS message instead (green). \nIf the message is entirely plain text it should be sent as SMS, which are cheap or free on most mobile (cellphone) plans. However if it contains a picture or other attachment, which SMS does not support, it will be sent as an MMS message and these are usually charged at a higher rate.\nAt least on iPhone with iOS 9.3.2, you can see from the grey text in the message field before you start typing whether the message will be sent as iMessage or SMS/MMS ('Text Message'). If the recipient should be able to receive iMessage but you can't send one, e.g. because you don't currently have a data connection, sending should fail and you should then be asked whether to send the message as a text message or MMS.\n", "Q: How much RAM do the different models of iPad have?

Even if you could suppress the characters appearing, you still have to TYPE IN the password, and anyone who could see the letters of the non-suppressed entry string could also see what you're typing even if the entry string was suppressed. Hence why TouchID is really the only way to fly, other than concealing your screen.\n", "Q: Is there fuser -k  analogue for Mac OS? I want to kill process that runs at some port.

Is there a setting for that, or was that feature lost with iOS 9 and 6S?\n\nA: \"Hey Siri\" is now always on, if on, because of the new M9 co-processor; the same one that records your steps. Apparently it can do this without unnecessarily flattening the battery.\nSee the report from Apple Insider - Apple's efficient M9 coprocessor will let your iPhone 6s track pace, make 'Hey Siri' always on\n\nIn a first for the iPhone series, the iPhone 6s will measure a user's walking or running pace when they exercise, without the need for battery draining GPS. Previously, this functionality was limited to the S1 chip in the Apple Watch.\nThe M9 also allows for Siri to be always on. That means users will be able to use the device's \"Hey Siri\" voice command at all times.\n\n\nA: If you are getting false positives when you have your iPhone in your pocket, you could prevent \"Hey Siri\" from working until your iPhone is unlocked by going to Settings> Touch ID and Passcode and scroll down to the \"Allow access when locked\" pane and switch Siri off.\nYou won't be able to use Siri at all on the lock screen, but at least you won't get any false positives while your iPhone is in your pocket.

I allocated 20GB to that partition. Here's what I've done. I first go into Disk Utility, select my partition and click 'Erase'. It apparently erases everything but there is still 67.4 MB being used on the partition that I can't remove:\n\nIf I go into finder this is what I see on that partition:\n\nThose are hidden files obviously and I can't delete them. I then go to the hard drive itself and click 'Partition' but when I do that and select the partition I want to remove, the minus button isn't an option:\n\nI can't manually resize the partitions either (I want to re-allocate the disk space to my main drive).\nAny ideas on why I can't remove the partition?\n\nA: Another cause of the \"minus\" button being greyed out in Disk Utility is that it doesn't allow you to delete the first partition on the disk.\n\nA: I've had the same issue in El Capitan. The instructions above which feature the old version of Disk Utility are obsolete as the new version (El Capitan and up) does not offer the same set of options.\nThat said, in order to remove the extra partition for which the minus button was greyed out, I simply rebooted into Recovery Mode (CMD+R during boot) and ran Disk Utility from there. The button was no longer greyed out.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I solved this on my external drive using diskutil to merge the problem partition with a following partition.  Update: Klanomath points out this won't work if you've booted from the disk you want to modify.\nNote: Data will only be preserved on one of the partitions (the first mentioned in the diskutil mergePartitions ... command) so create a backup first if you need to.\nGet a list of partitions on the drive.

The leftover .blah files are OS X config things. The partition still exists on the disk, it just now doesn't have anything in it. \nDeleting a partition means removing the partition from the partition table. That partition will then no longer exist.\nFrom your question, you would like to delete the partition completely. \nThus:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on Apple SSD SM02... at the top of the Disk Utility drive menu. This is the Red box on the image below.\n\n*Click on the Partition tab at the top of the window. This is the green box.\n\n*Select the Snow Leopard partition, then click the minus sign at the bottom of the partition display. This is the purple box.\n\n*Click Apply, and Disk Utility will work its magic. This is the black box.\n\n\n\nThe names and OS X version in the image are different(I think that is from 10.9), but the steps and buttons are the same. \nEDIT:\nThis may be a workaround if you do not have the minus button:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a Time Machine backup of your main OS X hard drive.

What will I need to reinstall after the process is done? What files are not removed from my hard drive? What files ARE removed from disk?\n\nA: Almost nothing is actually removed. What happens is the installer downloads a fresh and complete set of system files - basically the things that came with the Mac out of the factory minus some iLife apps like Garageband for instance.\nThe installer doesn't delete any user settings, user files and doesn't even delete apps you installed.\nThe process is designed to make the system work whether or not you have large or small changes to the system.\n", "Q: Recover deleted files from MacBook Retina's SSD I need to recover deleted files from my MacBook Retina.

I have used programs in the past that worked on spinning platter hard drives and was wondering if there was anything similar I could use for an SSD.\n\nA: Unfortunately, most SSD firmware permanently wipes pages soon after they're marked as free by the OS sending a Trim command, so unless you've only deleted it within the last couple seconds, you're basically out of luck.\n", "Q: Can I set up Contacts phone numbers format iPad iOS 9.  I use AT&T.  iPad Air 2\nI spend a lot of time in Mexico where the phone number format is completely different from the one in the States, and in Contacts.  Also, Contacts will not let me add extension numbers.  Contacts' format is so frequently different from what I need that I really want to change the format preference to let me enter the phone number the way I want it to look.  I've  spent a reasonable amount of time over the years since I first bought the original iPad 2 trying to find a way to solve this problem.  I finally just put the numbers the way I want them in Contacts/Notes.  Is there a way to set up Contacts phone numbers the way I want them, even if I want them to be different every time?  \n\nA: International Numbers \nTo store international numbers in the Contacts app (without changing the whole phone in regional settings), you need to enter the country code when adding the number... and it will format it according to what is expected for that country.\nExamples\nEntering a standard US number, such as 3135551212 produces (313) 555-1212.\nEntering the country code first, such as +13135551212 produces +1 (313) 555-1212.\nFor a Mexican phone number, entering +526241234567 produces +52 624 143 1234.\nEtc... etc.    The trick is to use the plus symbol, plus the country code, in front of any international number.\n\nExtensions\nFor extensions, the general rule is that you use a pause, or wait, in the phone number when you add it.   \nFor an extension number that you type immediately after dialing the number, use Pause. This adds a “,” to the phone number.\nFor a prolonged pause (like when the IVR goes on for a while before asking you to choose a number), use Wait and then key in the number.\n", "Q: NTFS external disc restore trashed items I guess I deleted files on my external NTFS storage.

Summary\nI want to restore any of the OS and data files my Mac OS X computers to any previous state I \"save\" (aka \"backup\"), so I can revert back to a known-working software state when a change causes a problem (like a problematic OS or application-software upgrade). I want to do this without Internet-bandwidth limitations (hence the Drobo is preferred, over a cloud-only-based backup).\nImplementation Challenges\nWhat solutions can solve limitations #1 and #2 (listed below) for the following scenario, and still meet the requirements served by CCC + Drobo? I prefer to keep the Drobo, but I expect to replace and/or augment CCC with something else/additional. However, I'll evaluate any solution, no matter how big the change. (Within reason. I have to stick with Mac OS X, for now.)\nMore Details\nI currently employ Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC) to copy my entire MacBook Air (it's primary 'Mac HD' drive) historically running 10.9.5 and 10.10.5 to a Drobo Mini. I can restore my entire 'Mac HD' drive, including the OS, to the state saved on my Drobo backup by booting off a USB flash thumbdrive, then running a CCC restore from the Drobo -> Mac HD.\nThis is my only reliably means I know to reset my OS/apps/data/etc back to a known working state, especially after a 'Software Update' screws something up. This happens most often when I update to a new Mac OS X, decide its newly-introduced bugs are not worth it, and then I downgrade. (Happened with Mavericks and Yosemite. I suspect it will happen with El Capitan--when I first try it.) I then wait for the new Mac OS X to become mature enough for me to upgrade to it, or I'm simply forced to upgrade for whatever reason (like app support phases out for the older OS X version).\nLimitations. The above works well, but there's 2 limitations I'd like to overcome:\n\n\n*\n\n*OS X's FileVault can not encrypt my Drobo, given its thin provisioning. Thus my files on the Drobo are exposed \"in the open\" if some untrusted person/entity acquires/steals my Drobo.\n\n*Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC) can not automatically or at least not easily restore (in the above scenario) to a backup state/time prior to the latest backup.\n\n\nTime Machine. It is not a viable solution. I've tested it numerous times in scenario similar to above, and it has failed (miserably and obviously) every time.\nCrashPlan. I've spoken with 3 different pre-sales tech representatives at CrashPlan/Code42. None of them claim to solve the above, even though I suspect they can do it as well as CCC does it today, with the aforementioned limitations, of course.\nTrueCrypt. Ultimately, I suspect I'll need an backup-application-level and/or TrueCrypt-based encryption to solve this. But I'm open to anything that meets all the requirements.\n\nA: I run OS X server and use Time Machine to store things in an encrypted manner. I use a Promise R2 box for the actual storage instead of Drobo, and have not needed to use the AppleCare that I pay so that I get three years of Apple engineering support in case Time Machine acts up for me.\nIt just hasn't been an issue across the handful of clients that I've set up with similar setups. I used to lose a few backups a year when we were backing up to Time Capsule - but since using OS X server.app to handle the Time Machine - things are much better in a reliability standpoint.\nHopefully someone will have a good answer for Drobo since you have had bad experiences with Time Machine, but I wanted to chime in with what has worked well for the last 3 years. Of the 50 machines backing up over Time Machine, we're not seeing problems with Apple's encrypted backup solution.\n", "Q: Mac Mini 1,1 (10.6.8) Missing libc++ My Mac Mini 1,1 running Snow Leopard 10.6.8 is missing libc++.

But ejecting it is kinda useless as I can't use it then, and if I then reconnect it, it shows the yellow icon again.\nI'm running the latest version of OS X El Capitan.\nAnybody else have this issue or know how to fix this?\n\nA: To fix this I went into Get Info for the external drive and under the \"Preview:\" section it showed the TM icon, which I clicked and dragged to the top of Get Info and it overlayed the yellow icon.\n\nA: For me it fixed by following these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System preferences > Time Machine\n\n*Go to Select Disk...\n\n*Select the disk which is showing yellow icon\n\n*Start the backup\n\n\nThis will remark the disk as Time Machine Backup and macOS will change the icon to the Time Machine green icon.\n\nA: I just had this same problem after using Migration Assistant to move my data to a new Macbook. I told the new machine to \"inherit\" my existing Time Machine backup. Backups worked fine, but the wrong icon was shown for the drive (orange instead of blue with arrow). The correct blue icon was shown momentarily when I ejected the disk, but it kept coming back orange when I reconnected the disk. I went into the Finder preferences and in the \"General\" tab, under \"Show these items on the desktop\" I unchecked \"external disks\" then re-checked it. The right icon was then shown on the desktop. However, the wrong icon was still displayed in Finder windows. Doing \"get info\" on the incorrect icon in the Finder window caused it to immediately refresh to the correct icon.\nThis Time Machine troubleshooting guide also has some more elaborate fixes: http://pondini.org/TM/B4.html\n", "Q: Is there any way to run a PowerPC video game (Call Of Duty United Offensive) on Mavericks?

Can Rosetta be installed from my old Snow Leopard disks?\n\nA: No,there really is not an easy way to run PPC apps on Mac anymore. Your OS X Rosetta disk will definitely  fail to install on Mavericks.

I think you could use a video editor to flip the frame horizontally and then output the render to a new file which views correctly. It should be easier. The software should just be smart enough to do it. Other low tech option; video a mirror that has you in it. Then, you record (and flip), a flipped image. I'd do it in After Effects easily. You might do it in a lower priced editing app like VLC on a mac, however. I have not tested that though.

I've had this MacBook for 3 years.\n\nA: I use a commercial can of compressed air (versus air from your shop compressor, for example) and gently blow any and all dust from the exposed interior. I would do this before proceeding to replace the drive, especially if there is visible dust in the interior.\nI pay particular attention to any cooling fans (not knowing your exact model) to blow all of the dust off the fan blades and from the ductwork. A pair of tweezers or a toothpick can be helpful to remove major dust bunnies, if any.\nTry not to blow dust up into the fan spindle/seat directly, nor into your hard drive or Superdrive (which is simply saying, be careful to blow dust OUT of things, not into them). There may be an exposed pressure port on your hard drive case (non SSD), and the mechanism and optics in the optical drive, which are not friendly to dust or too much air pressure.\n\nA: Be careful to clear any propellant that may be in the top of the can, and use the can according to the instructions to avoid that propellant being shot onto the motherboard. It's unlikely to cause damage, but better safe than sorry. Otherwise, great answer above.\n", "Q: Can't find untested extension in order to remove it: SafariTabSwitching \nI don't need this extension anymore because Safari 9 has this feature built-in, but I can't find it anywhere to disable or remove it.

Also, I do not want to jailbreak the device.\n\nA: On recent iOS - you can just share out the files over SMB and use the files app to mount the share / move files and folders.\nFor doing it without a network or file share, here are the older steps using open source libraries to do this without needing to jailbreak the device.\n\n*\n\n*http://www.libimobiledevice.org/\nIf you don’t see this included, consider using homebrew to install that package and the http://askubuntu.com people are amazing resources if you run into issues.\n\n*\n\n*https://askubuntu.com/a/704677/21224\n", "Q: Trouble to opening t.co links I have trouble to open links from Tweetbot in Safari on the Mac. it just waits loading with the t.co domain.\nOn iOS I don't have this problems!\nIs it because I use uBlock as an adblocker? I can not reproduce this problem. After opening the link a second or third time it usually works.\n\nA: It is possible that it has something to do with uBlock. Have you tried disabling the extension temporarily? Try that and see if the problem persists, if it doesn't, then that is your answer. You might just need to whitelist the domain t.co.\nIf it doesn't solve the problem, then you might need to try something else. Is both your Mac and iOS device on the same WiFi network? There could be a firewall or something blocking the Mac from connecting to the domain, while the iOS device is on cellular data.\n\nA: If you are browsing the twitter site itself in Safari (and perhaps Chrome), you might be happy with the detox extension by Shaun Inman.\nIt's not the detox listed on Apple's extension site as that one injects things into Facebook.\nThe twitter detox is intended to make your history work better, but it might also alleviate your redirection mess as well.\n", "Q: Auto login with FileVault in El Captain When using File Vault on El Capitan, is there any way to disable the Auto Login, so when you start up it loads straight away without needing a password.\nIf not, then is possible to set it so when you enter a password it goes straight to the desktop and skips the loading bar. (i.e. so it preloads before the password is entered)\nI understand why a password is needed, but it is overkill for my situation.\nI'm guessing the answer is probably \"no\", but I thought there might be a terminal command or some other trick. \n\nA: A permanent work around would be to disable FileVault, which has the serious downside of compromising your encryption entirely, as described in this Support Article\nFor a one-off you can use the fdesetup command to reboot and bypass the user login step. This is designed for unattended reboots and works well in my experience without compromising your encrypted system.  Run the following command in Terminal:\nsudo fdesetup authrestart\n\nA: It's not possible. FileVault encrypts the entire startup volume, and therefore cannot do much of anything (including logging you in, or even loading the OS) until a valid decrypt password is given. Once you supply your password, then it's able to load the OS and log you in.\n", "Q: Issue with iSight on MacBook updated to 10.11 El Capitan I updated my MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2009) to OS X 10.11 El Capitan.

Ideas? I have an iPhone 5 that does not take a sim card. It is programmed for StraightTalk which goes through Verizon towers. I've had it over 2 years- finally got the sleep/wake button fixed since that's been a problem and known issue. When I got my phone back, I could no longer access 3G (so no iMessages unless I'm on wifi, no group msgs or photo msgs ever, no web without wifi).\nMy iOS is up to date. I've called the sat programming repeatedly to update. I took it into a store to check settings. I've been on the phone 4 separate occasions with providers and Apple (who did a remote check through computer and there are no hardware issues- I was told wifi wouldn't work either if there was).  The provider walks me through the same basic steps each time checking dumb things like airplane mode. They always wind up, an hour later, telling me that everything is \"fine on their end\" and my account is \"well provisioned\" and it should be getting data. Well, it's not.  Sometimes, they say they'll transfer me to someone else to try to fix it and then they hang up.\nThis phone doesn't use a sim card, never has, and a card won't work in this type of phone. (I even tested this once with provider and it made nothing work instead of just no 3G.)\nI have a friend who had the same issue with the same provider and they said eventually the ST people transferred them to Verizon and they reset something there. So far, I can't get anyone to listen to me to try this, and when I went into Verizon they said it wasn't their problem. The friend didn't have any other specifics as to what the issue was so I can't tell anyone what they did. :/ \nIf anyone out there can help, I'd greatly appreciate it. Seems like a waste to have a smartphone where I can't ever check mail when I'm out (or use browser to look things up or find my way). It's really disheartening to get nowhere after so many hours on the phone with people who don't seem to really know their job other than what the screen prompts them to ask. \n\nA: I'm not sure if you said where you got your phone fixed (I double checked, but I could be missing it), but who fixed it? Was it Apple, a friend, a repair shop? It sounds like something could have been either damaged or disconnected and not reconnected correctly in the repair process.\nIf you have done a full restore to the device (both from an iCloud/iTunes backup and set it up as a new device) then it is probably damaged physically. You need to contact whomever repaired the sleep/wake button.\n\nA: What I would do is see if the Straight Talk rep will send you a Verizon nano-SIM.\n\nThis phone doesn't use a sim card, never has, and a card won't work in this type of phone. (I even tested this once with provider and it made nothing work instead of just no 3G.)\n\nThe iPhone 5 takes a nano-SIM card. The only to date that never took any SIM card was the CDMA (Verizon) iPhone 4. Additionally, though you can use 3G with your iPhone 5 without a SIM, you can't use LTE without it and LTE is much faster than old 3G.\n\nYes, the iPhone in the picture is a 5s (note the gold color) and a GSM one (note the T-Mobile SIM), but as far as the SIM card is concerned, everything's the same there as for a CDMA iPhone 5.\n", "Q: How to run current mails from MacBook and access or search old mails from an external hard drive?

Then I would like to continue with my existing accounts to keep receiving fresh or current emails. \nHow do I then access or search the old mails from the external hard drive and if necessary reply or download content from them?\nIs there a way?\n\nA: You can try the following approach.\nFirst of all, show hidden files on your Mac by typing, on Terminal, the following command (substitute 'NO' to 'YES' if you want to re-hide files).:\ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES\n\nRelaunch the Finder. Now, go to youraccount/Library/Mail, then enter the folder Vx, where x is a number corresponding to your Mail version.\nThen, if you have an IMAP account (i.e., Gmail), enter the imap folder. \n\nAccessing  all the listed folders, you can see all your emails, with extension .emlx. If you double-click on it, it will be opened a Mail windows, where you can read the email and perform any operation you want.\n\nYou can just copy the mails you are interested in a new folder, in your external drive, and open from there when you want, for example, to read or reply to one of them.\n", "Q: iPhone 6S storage issue I have iOS devices since the 3GS but this happened to me for the first time tonight..

The thing you want to avoid that affects battery life is always keeping it plugged in. You want to make sure you regularly \"use\" your battery, allowing it to drain and then recharging to full. If it is always plugged in and sitting at full you'll start to notice a decrease in performance when the battery finally does get drained.\n", "Q: Use 3rd party storage as primary OS X server storage or hire OS X server?

How can I best diagnose this?\nI own a MacBook Pro from 2012, which recently has become unbearably slow: typically any action, such as clicking on a tab or typing, is followed by a spinning beach ball for about 30 seconds, even though I am not running any intensive process (e.g. only the web browser is open, with a couple of tabs; the same thing happens while browsing files in the Finder, or even typing my name at the login screen after rebooting).\nWhat worries me is that I cannot decide whether it's hardware or software related. I upgraded to El Capitan a few weeks ago, and after a couple of days of decent experience (it wasn't very fast, but at least remained usable), I figured after a few patches and/or spotlight doing its background work, things would improve, but no: the computer became so slow that I was forced to format the disk and make a fresh install. Things have not improved one bit, however.\nOne thing I noticed is that the battery is drained very quickly: I had it replaced less than 2 months ago, yet after only a couple of hours sitting idle the machine runs out of battery.\nSo, I have two options: try the painful process of re-installing an older OS version, and hope this will make it usable again, or give the machine to a repair service to check for hardware problems. This is quite costly here, even if they don't find anything or are unable to fix it, so I'd like to check first wether those symptoms are compatible with e.g. a hard-drive failure (in which case it would be worth getting it changed).\nEdit: Following the suggestions offered below, I tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*check the activity monitor: I do not see any process with high CPU load; typically the Finder or Web browser (Safari or Chrome) with a maximum of a few % of CPU usage. During the beach-ball freeze every minute or so, I am unable to focus on the Activity Monitor window to get updates, so it may be that a process appears and disappears during that time.\n\n*reset the SMC. For a little while it seemed to be more responsive after reboot. Unfortunately, after 10 minutes or so just browsing the Web, I'm back to the beach ball every couple of clicks. \nIt seems that regardless of the task -- web browsing, file browsing, text editor, there is a periodically recurring lag that freezes the system for a few tens of seconds every minute or so.\n\nA: Yes.

Since upgrading to El Capitan, when I quit the screen sharing client, the screen on the remote machine turns off. How do I stop this from happening, while still having the screen turn off normally after a few minutes of inactivity?\n\nA: Under System Preferences > Sharing, use “Remote Management” instead of “Screen Sharing”, as shown here:\n\nAs far as I can tell, everything else works the same but the screen no longer turns off when you disconnect a Screen Sharing connection.\nedited to add: this is under 10.11.3\n\nA: Run this command in the terminal to fix the external screen going blank on VNC disconnect. Works with Sierra OS.\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement RestoreMachineState -bool NO\n\n\nMore context from jabenninghoff on GitHub:\n\nIn newer versions of macOS, screen sharing will automatically re-lock the screen when you disconnect if it was locked when you first connected.\n\n\nA: To be clear - the top-rated solution here alone from colo2100cent does not solve the problem if you're connecting to a MacBook with the lid closed (tested using a mid 2011 MacBook Air running Sierra - VNC disconnect required opening the lid and a physical button press to wake it up), but works fine if you're using a desktop based Mac like a Mac mini or an iMac. A display must be connected externally for this to work on a MacBook, but this is wasteful if it's being stored in a closet as a server or otherwise not being physically accessed.\nWhat solved the problem for me was executing the command in colo2100cent's answer:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement RestoreMachineState -bool NO\n\nwhile also having a headless ghost display connected to the miniDP port, purchased for about 10 bucks. It tricks your MacBook into thinking there's a monitor connected at all times but does not require a monitor. Works like a charm - no more sleeping after VNC disconnect.\n\nA: I also have this issue (2012 Mac running El Capitan 10.11.5). I did not have this issue on my 2007 Mac Mini running 10.6.8 with a similar configuration (except using DVI instead of HDMI). When I close Mac screensharing or TouchPad on iOS, or switch iOS apps or lock the phone, the Mac Mini turns off external video. \nThe workaround I've found is:\nHit pause / play on the Apple Remote (the physical infrared remote — not an app) after starting the video, before closing screensharing. Then you should be able to close screensharing and the screen will stay on. I've also done this with the Apple bluetooth mouse and it works as well. \nYou can also accomplish this by waking the Mac Mini with the remote before initiating screensharing, if you remember. Annoying though since it will often open and start playing iTunes.\nThe Mac just seems to need some input from a physical device (mouse or remote) after waking to prevent it putting the screen back to sleep.\nGoing to try the Remote Management checkbox also to see if that helps. \n\nA: I solved this by restarting the Mac with the display (the TV) already ON.\nIf starting the Mac with the display off, either using Remote Management or Screen Sharing will result in the display turning off after disconnecting the VNC client.\n", "Q: OS X 10.11 CardDAV with self-signed certificate The CardDAV server I'm trying to connect to uses a self-signed certificate.

ATS prevents accidental disclosure, provides secure default behavior, and is easy to adopt; it is also on by default in OS X v10.11 and iOS 9. You should adopt ATS as soon as possible, regardless of whether you’re creating a new app or updating an existing one.\nIf you’re developing a new app, you should use HTTPS exclusively. If you have an existing app, you should use HTTPS as much as you can right now, and create a plan for migrating the rest of your app as soon as possible. In addition, your communication through higher-level APIs needs to be encrypted using TLS version 1.2 with forward secrecy. If you try to make a connection that doesn't follow this requirement, an error is thrown. If your app needs to make a request to an insecure domain, you have to specify this domain in your app's Info.plist file.\n\n\nA: Open the Keychain Access.app, and add your self-signed certificate to the login group. Then double-click it, expand the Trust section and set Always Trust for everything.\nTo pull your self-signed certificate click the lock    icon to the left of the browser URL bar (Safari/Chrome), pick Certificate and the drag the big certificate icon into Finder. Next, from Finder you can drag it into Keychain Access.app under login (or System).\nOR from the command line:\nsudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k \"/Library/Keychains/System.keychain\" my-self-signed-cert.pem\n\n", "Q: How do I use time machine to access system files like /etc/hosts? Time Machine makes it easy to recover older versions of your personal users files; How do you restore an older version of a system file (such as /etc/hosts) using Time Machine?\n\nA: For OS X 10.11, El Capitan, the steps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Applications > Time Machine; or use the Time Machine menu bar item and select Enter Time Machine.\n\n*Reveal the Go to Folder sheet within Time Machine using the key combination: Command + Shift + G.\n\n*Within the Go to Folder sheet enter the path /private/etc and select Go.\n\n*You can now browse your back-ups of /etc/ and restore files as needed.\n\n\nA: I just used Time Machine on Yosemite to recover /usr/bin/unzip; this is how I did it, given that my Time Machine backup disk is named Backup and my machine is named MyMacBook (not really):\n\n\n*\n\n*Set Finder to show all OS files: From a command line, run defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES\n\n*Open a Finder window to your backup media (eg: Devices / Backup ) and then drill down into the latest appropriate backup. The Backups.backupdb/MyMacBook directory will have a series of directories named as timestamps (YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS) and Latest. Each of these directories represents a Time Machine backup.\nOn my MacBook, the correct directory was Backups.backupdb/MyMacBook/2015-10-22-130134/Macintosh HD/usr/bin.\n\n*Open another Finder window, then use CommandShiftG to go to your system folder (/usr/bin in my case).\n\n*Drag and copy the file (unzip in my case) from the Time Machine window to the system window. You will probably be prompted for your password if it's a system file.\nYou can do this from the command line:\nsudo cp -p /Volumes/Backup/Backups.backupdb/MyMacBook/2015-10-22-130134/Macintosh\\ HD/usr/bin/unzip /usr/bin\n\n\nA: I think that may be the only thing OS X recovers via Time Machine, especially in El Capitan, with its infamous System Integrity Protection (SIP).\nIf all you wish to be able to recover other than your user files is /etc/hosts, then set a root cronjob (or I guess I should say a launchd job) to scp or rsync the file somewhere else.\nNote: crontab is supposedly \"deprecated\" in later versions of OS X in favor of launchd, but it still works (and IMHO, is way easier to setup than a scheduled task via launchd -- especially if you have a previous Linux/Unix background).\nOtherwise, if you wish to recover the entire filesystem, you should look into alternative backup solutions such as CrashPlan, which is quite cheap, and pretty much the standard cloud backup solution these days.\n", "Q: Unlock GSM iPhone 4?

I use my early 2011 15\" MacBook Pro for nearly everything under the sun - I often monitor which GPU is active using gfxCardStatus. I've noticed some idiosyncrasies in how OS X decides when to switch graphics processors:\n\n\n*\n\n*MOST apps that require X11 will trigger auto-switching, but not all\n\n*It seems every app that requires java will trigger the auto-switching, though I've not tested this with non-GUI apps.\n\n*Some apps (like Mathematica or XCode) which COULD require a high-performance GPU will force movement to the discrete card straight away, even if only fired up for a trivial task (dynamic switching in-app would be cool, off topic)\n\n*Many legacy apps (silverlight) which have no business asking for my discrete card will force it regarless\n\n*Finally, some apps (GIMP, in particular) which could definitely benefit from a discrete GPU actually don't ask for it at all.\n\n\nDoes Apple document how it chooses when to switch cards? Can apps make an OS-level request for the discrete card if it exists?\n\nA: On a high level, it's like an automatic transmission - when you press the gas gently, the throttle increases but when you stomp on the accelerator pedal the engine downshifts the transmission to increase the mechanical advantage.\nYou can influence switching to the powerful GPU by hitting the API with significant work and expect the \"transmission\" to dispatch that load to the non-integrated GPU.\nThe documentation on the API are all in Xcode (and online too, but I prefer using search on Xcode to hunt for a document).\nI would start with:\n\n\n*\n\n*xcdoc://?url=developer.apple.com/library/etc/redirect/xcode/mac/1153/technotes/tn2335/_index.html (online web link of the same article)\n\n\nThose links cover the Mac Pro and the \"What you should know when using OpenCL\" section contains a helpful note that WWDC 2013 Session 508: Working with OpenCL describes how to switch between two GPUs in a Mac portable using power considerations.\n", "Q: Exclude Music from Matching by Apple Music or iTunes Match The matching algorithm Apple uses is very aggressive and will many times mismatch music from my library no matter how well tagged it is. This is a nuisance for many and the information on how to remedy this is poor. How can you force music in your iTunes library from not getting matched in the cloud?\n\nA: After much testing the best solution I've found is to mislabel the track and album name. This is by no means optimal but at least it leaves the artist name intact so that the sorting stays neat without duplicate artists. Doing this manually for each problematic album would be a PITA but fortunately it can be automated to a high degree using MusicBrainz Picard.\nIn order for a track to bypass the matching algorithm it needs the title and album tag to be mislabeled with a character/number and a symbol before and after the name (and without any spaces). A track named Autumn Fog Lifts would for example become 0.Autumn Fog Lifts.0 if using my own personal syntax where I insert 0. before and .0 after.\nUsing Picard, one can set a script to do it like this:\n\n$set(title,$replace(%title%,%title%, 0.%title%.0))\n$set(album,$replace(%album%,%album%, 0.%album%.0))\n\nThis will add 0. before and .0 after. the title and album tag whenever music is added to Picard.\nThis is my recommended workflow of how to replace the mismatched music in the cloud:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click and show file on the problematic music in iTunes \n\n*Copy the music files to a new location, make a backup so to speak \n\n*Remove the music from within iTunes (make sure to select Move to Trash)\n\n*Add the music from your backup to Picard, it will retag everything \n\n*Inspect the results and save, add the music back to iTunes\n\n\nFor more information on how Picard works see How to Tag Files.\n", "Q: Xcode 7.1.1 very slow and laggy I updated to the newest Xcode version 7.1.1 in the hope, that the performance will be better.

In order to use the service with AppleTV, you'll need to either 1) stream from a compatible device, such as an iPhone / iPad / Mac, or 2) upgrade to the latest 4th generation AppleTV.    \n\nA: Just stream Apple Music from your iPhone or iPad to the Apple TV via AirPlay. \n\nA: I may be possible o use Apple Music on the 3rd generation Apple TV.

I was thinking it was maybe because certain mac commands are still available during the game (league of legends).\nI notice i can use cmd + shift + 3 to screen capture.

(in fact I can't even find where the snapshot files are!)\n\nA: Time Machine makes two passes on each file. If your file is open/locked/changing, then Time Machine will skip that file for that interval. Basically, it collects a list of all files needing backup and when it gets to the file - it might skip it and save it to try again once the first pass is complete. If the second pass fails, you miss that file.\nIdeally, you would quit Parallels (or at least shut down the storage / finalize all the writes) and then make a backup to avoid missing files or having a file being saved in an \"unusable\" state.\nIt looks like the vendor is changing the default behavior to accommodate Time Machine according to:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://kb.parallels.com/en/8827\n\n*http://kb.parallels.com/en/115052\nIt also gets complicated based on which other storage settings you use for the virtual disk technology - and I'll leave that for Parallels support to answer in a knowledge base article - but how Time Machine works is easily tested.\nRun a backup and then run tmutil compare to see what files are different than the ones saved in a snapshot. Try restoring the Parallels VM to a new location and booting it. The problem with timing issues is you might get a sane backup 9 times out of 10 or 99,999 out of 100,000 - but it's really about how much data you can afford to lose.\nMost people I know skip backing up virtual machines and implement an alternative method of saving user files off image (or syncing them) and/or setting a reminder to periodically make a snapshot backup of the state of the VM by scripting a shut down and then scripting a copy of the data files to a place where Time Machine will back up that periodic snapshot.\nOnce you have that set up, you can exclude the running VM files from Time Machine backup and save time/space on the backup media of incremental backups that might not actually be workable.\nIt looks like Smart Guard marks all the files excluded from Time Machine except the backup snapshots and the optimize scheduled snapshots automatically every 48 hours. You should be able to look at your Time Machine backups with a tool like BackupLoupe after running for a week and confirm that you are only getting backup snapshots and that they are happening every 48 hours.\n\nA: There is not much to add to bmike's answer except some aspects of what's happening under the hood:\nThe .pvm as well ass the .hdd file are in fact folders similar to apps. You may access them using the context menu -> Show package contents.\nExample:\nAfter configuring the SmartGuard feature, Parallels will save an initial snapshot of some files (in the dark blue box: .mem, .png etc all starting with {356...) in a subsequent Snapshots folder and a snapshot of the hdd with a corresponding name in the hdd package here starting with CentOS Linux 7.0.1-0.hdd.0.{356....\nFirst snapshot:\n\n\nAll changes made in the VM  afterwards are written to other files. In the screenshot above all the hdd changes are written to the file CentOS Linux 7.0.1-0.hdd.0.{5fb....\nSecond snapshot (I set the VM to create a snapshot every hour)\n\n\nThe second snapshot (in the light blue box) is created after one hour.

What am I missing?\n\nA: This is not actually caused by ls, since ls never expands patterns.\nThe decision about how to expand glob patterns (patterns containing * and ?) is made by the shell.  Your shell is most likely bash.\nBy default bash does not perform path expansion on dotfiles.  However, it can do so either by explicitly writing the . (as you discovered already) or by turning on the dotglob option.  From the bash manpage:\n\ndotglob If set, bash includes filenames beginning with a `.' in the results of pathname expansion.\n\nTo demonstrate, let's just print the expansion with echo instead of ls:\n$ touch .bash_profile.swo\n\n$ echo .*.swo\n.bash_profile.swo\n\n$ echo *.swo\n*.swo\n\n$ shopt -s dotglob\n\n$ echo *.swo\n.bash_profile.swo\n\nFuther discussion can be found here.\n\nA: Using ls\nThe problem is that your file has two dots, not one. You need to account for that:\nls -al .*.sw*\n\nThis will match any file that begins with a dot (invisible files like .DS_Store) and also ends with .sw*.\n.swa as well as .swz will match.\n\nUsing find\nYou can use the following to find all files with the same extension (swo in the case below) in a directory.\nfind ~ -iname *swo\n\n-iname finds a case insensitive match.\n\nYou can search for that/those specific file(s) using this:\nfind .bash_*.sw*\n\n\nNote: Using ~ as the path will search your entire home directory.\n\nA: The issue is that ls only shows files that begin with a . you have to explicitly have the first . in the file glob.\nThus the following will work:\nls .*swo\n\nUnix shells expand the glob before ls sees the file names.\n\nA: These patterns (*.sw* and the like) are known as globs.\nAs @Mark and @Zach Gates have noted, globs do not match files whose names begin with a period unless you explicitly include a . at the beginning of the pattern. This is because in UNIX-like systems (such as OS X), files that begin with a dot are considered 'hidden' files and are generally not shown by default.\nGlob matching is actually done by your shell (bash by default), not by individual commands such as ls.\nAs the bash manual explains under Filename Expansion:\n\nAfter word splitting... Bash scans each word for the characters ‘*’, ‘?’, and ‘[’. If one of these characters appears, then the word is regarded as a pattern, and replaced with an alphabetically sorted list of filenames matching the pattern (see Pattern Matching). If no matching filenames are found,...the word is left unchanged.\nWhen a pattern is used for filename expansion, the character ‘.’ at the start of a filename or immediately following a slash must be matched explicitly, unless the shell option dotglob is set.\n\n", "Q: Why does my iphone 6s not wake up for a phone call?

Let us say I have \n\n\n*\n\n*A laptop, and\n\n*An iphone.\n\n\nWhen I connect the iPhone with the laptop, iTunes pops up inviting me to sync\n\nBy \"sync\", does it mean to\n\n\n*\n\n*overwrite the content of the laptop with that in the iPhone, \n\n*overwrite the content of the iPhone with that in the laptop, \n\n*or something in between?\n\n\nA: Synchronization is the process of ensuring that your iTunes and iPad/iPhone contain the same up-to-date files. If you add, change, or delete a file from one location, the synchronization process will add, change, or delete the same file at the other location.\nFor example, if you had a few songs on your computer, and a few on your phone, and the ones on your phone were not on the computer, and the ones on your computer were not on the phone, then after a \"sync\" operation, the contents of your computer AND the phone is the combination of contents of both devices. \nIn short,  the content on device 1 now exists on device 2 alongside device 2's original content, and the content of device 2 now exists on device 1 alongside device 1's original content. \n\nA: Apart from the answer Shaggy D gave, that it doesn't overwrite anything unless specifically instructed, just merges the two \"branches\" of the library (including pointing out and creating separate files in instances of for example notes that have been modified on both locations creating a conflict) sync is also when the phone contents that aren't part of the iTunes library get backed up, if you're backing up to a computer instead of iCloud. So for example your sms convos, preference files etc. \nThat part of it is indeed a one-way process, from phone to computer. The reverse is when you click \"restore from backup\". \nA thing to note is that if you want your backup to truly mirror your device you need to turn on encryption or it will skip some sensitive data, health and such.\nEverything about this is also rather muddled these days as you can choose to backup to iCloud instead of computer, and most probably have their contacts, notes etc already mirrored through either iCloud or their Google/Exchange accounts - that stuff obviously isn't touched in the sync as it's already in the cloud.\nA last tip about the library - generally it will transfer App Store purchases made on the phone to the computer, which can take up a lot of space and the files are of no use to the computer. Still, if they're not on the computer they won't be put back on the device in the event of a restore. If in need of space on your main drive definitely either move your entire iTunes library to a different drive, or symlink the Mobile Applications folder and move the .ipa files, works perfectly well. \n", "Q: Is there a way to turn Wi-Fi on/off using Spotlight?

Thinking about doing a clean install.\n\nA: This issue was plaguing me for a long-time and was really annoying.\nI initially thought it was an issue with a random plist or other file hanging out in the Library/ folder and I tried deleting many of them to try and get to the bottom of this.\nEventually, I was tipped off to a Keychain issue by looking in Console, which with some Google'ing, led me to this post on Apple's forums.\nUltimately, I removed all of the following items in Keychain Access, retried adding the account in Internet Accounts, and everything worked well!\n\nIt sounds like it was only the com.apple.account.Google.oauth* tokens that had to be removed, but your mileage may vary.\n\nA: None of the methods mentioned anywhere worked for me. However, I logged out of my iCloud account, added the Google accounts, then logged back into my iCloud. Everything worked after I logged out of iCloud and I got past the grey screen. \n\nA: For me, I also had to delete an entry called: \nname = \"https://gmail.com\" \nKind = Identity preferences\nThat did it for me.  I have too many saved credentials with \"gmail.com\" in them (my email), so searching 'gmail' isn't so easy.  Hopefully helps someone else too.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, I went to add my google account and it asked me to authenticate in the browser and showed a small window with a loading spinner that would never load.\nThe solution for me was to change the default web browser to safari, system preferences > general > default web browser. Then try again and it worked. After this you can change your default browser back.\n", "Q: What can cause a (software) keyboard failure on a unibody macbook? I've got a macbook on which the keyboard has suddenly failed.  \nThe trackpad works, the power button first, but pressing any other key on the keyboard has NO effect. \nOn the other hand. During boot I can do CMD-opt-P-R to reset the EPRAM (this has no effect), but does show me that at least those keys are working during boot.  \nWhat might be happening here? \n\nA: Are you able to boot into Recovery Mode and test the keyboard there?\n\nTo start your computer from Recovery, restart your Mac and hold down the Command and R keys at startup.\n\nIf that works, consider re-installing OS X or at least booting into Safe Mode to disable errant extensions and plugins.\n", "Q: How remove weather from today view in os X notification center? In my notification center in os x, I have disabled the weather widget. But still, under 'today' there is weather information. The weather widget itself still shows as disabled though!\nHow to completely remove weather info from the notification center?\n\n\nA: You can't remove weather from Today without removing Today. The Weather widget is a separate interactive Weather widget, not part of Today. If you don't want weather to show within Today, you need to remove the Today widget.\n", "Q: Symbolic links of plist file getting turned into plain text files I'm trying to share my Sequel Pro favourites between my iMac and my Macbook Air. The method I'm using is this:  \n\n\n*\n\n*On the iMac, ove Favorites.plist from ~/Application Support/Sequel Pro/Data to ~/Dropbox/Apps/Sequel_Pro;  \n\n*On the iMac, make a symbolic link to the Favorites.plist file (in Dropbox) and move that link into the ~/Application Support/Sequel Pro/Data folder;  \n\n*On the Macbook, make a symbolic link to the Favorites.plist file (in Dropbox) and move that link into the ~/Application Support/Sequel Pro/Data folder\n\n\nIn both steps 2 and 3 I need to rename the symbolic link file from Favorites.plist symlink to Favorites.plist in order to Sequel Pro to pick up on it.\nWhat I find is that Sequel Pro on both machines opens with the favourites in place, but changes to the favourites are not reflected on the other machine and do not seem to be passed back to the original in Dropbox (there is no 'sync activity' indicator on the Dropbox icon). Further investigation reveals that, after opening Sequel Pro, the act of saving changes to the favourites (or of quitting the app, which I guess updates the favorites.plist as part of the quitting process) apparently changes the symbolic link into a regular text file rather than updating the original.  \nIs this expected behaviour?\nExtra info: OSX 10.9.5, Sequel Pro 1.1\n\nA: Yes, it's the expected behavior because Sequel Pro expects the Favorites.plist file to be where it's programmed to be, in ~/Application Support/Sequel Pro/Data.\nIn other words, when Sequel Pro opens, it reads the Favorites.plist file following the symlink because it's just making a read of the file.  When a change is make or the app closes the file is updated and is written in its programmed location and does not follow the symlink because first a temporary Favorites.plist.<$random> file is written and then the symlink is deleted and the temporary Favorites.plist.<$random> file is renamed to Favorites.plist.  In this process Sequel Pro sees the symlink of the Favorites.plist as a regular file not a symlink and why it's replaced.\n\nA: user3439894 has confirmed that this is expected behaviour. I found a workaround, however, which is to move Favorites.plist’s entire enclosing Data folder into Dropbox and to use that folder as the target for the the symbolic link rather than the individual file. That seems to work fine.\n", "Q: Adding a compiled application to $PATH. Understanding the problem I'm trying to understand the whole $PATH problem but I've got no luck so far.\nSuppose that I've just compiled an executable with make and I need to launch it with the shell without using the full path.\nWell the problem is that I don't fully understand all these \"add to path\" things.\nMy idea is that if the terminal reads on specific folders, why don't we just put all the application files to this folder?\nWhy don't we add the whole Applications folder to the list of folder that the terminal goes to open an application?\n\nA: The PATH variable already containts a list of directories which the shell (which is what is running inside Terminal) is using to search for any executables. So if you compile something on your own and put it into one of the folders listed in PATH you can execute it from the shell prompt right away. \nThe current folder (.) usually is not part of PATH for security reasons. So for stuff you compile and want to run right away, you have to execute ./stuff for the shell to find it.\n", "Q: Streaming iMac's Audio to iPad I want to stream all audio output from my iMac to iPad. By the way, I know, there are only app which named Airfoil for that functionality.

We have a Mac OS X Server running on 10.10.5 with Server 5.0.15. We are using Profile Manager to deploy some basic configuration settings.\nThere are five Macs besides the server: three MacBook Pros, two Mac Minis. I set up the following device groups:\nDesktop Macs\nMobile Macs\nCompany Macs\nThe three MacBook Pros are in the Mobile Macs group, the two mac Minis are in the Desktop Macs group. Company Macs has the other two groups as its members.\nHowever, it seems that the settings for Company Macs are not being propagated to the clients. Activity for the group shows \"Push Settings: Succeeded\"… but it shows that even for a client machine that has been powered off since before I made the settings change. My other machines do not show any Profiles for the Company Macs group, only the specific group they are assigned to.\nEven more curious: when I remove the nested groups, and simply assign the laptops to Mobile Macs and Company Macs group explicitly, the Company Macs profile is still not pushed out.\nShould this work with nested device groups? I don't want to wipe Profile Manager and start over if it's not intended to work this way (but then why is it even an option to add a group to another group?). My hunch is that something is corrupt with the Company Macs group, since it's not pushing the profile even for Macs manually assigned.\n\nA: Yes.\nThe problem was that a process on the server or the client did not like one of the settings payloads in the \"outer\" group (Directory in my case). \n", "Q: Make Osx Text shortcut works when using Microsoft Remote Desktop On Yosemite it's possible to define text shortcuts in System Preferences > Keyboard > Text But they don't work when I'm on Microsoft Remote Desktop app, is there a way to make them work on it?\n\nA: In an RDP session, everything you type is sent to the host computer, not interpreted by your local machine. You'd need to define the shortcuts you want to use on the Windows box you're accessing to use them. \n", "Q: Backing up External Drive without Time Machine I'm not too familiar with Time Machine. I cannot recall if Time Machine creates full version-controlled images, or just changes what's different since last time. \nI'm interested in the latter, I don't need rollback iterations or anything, just a clone of the present.\nI ask because the backup drive I just got is not that large, I don't want any space wasted.\n\nA: Time Machine use an incremental backup approach, where each backup only contains the differences since the previous backup. For a single, changing, file over time, Time Machine keeps state snapshots of the file so you can move backwards in time and see how the file was at previous, different states.\nAs the disk fills up, Time Machine will purge the oldest snapshots it has. Time Machine will do this opportunistically to ensure that your backup disk always has enough free space to store the next incremental snapshot of your live data it wants to make.\nTime Machine doesn't back up everything. It has user-specific exclusion lists as well as a built-in exclusion list. Because of this, the target backup drive doesn't need to be many times bigger than source drive, only a few times bigger than the data set on the source drive that it will be backing up. You can exclude the operating system files for the most part.\nFor example, on this Mac, you can see that even though there's over 500 GB of storage used on the Main drive, the Time Machine drive isn't 100% full and actuall stores many, many months of incremental backups:\n\nMy rule of thumb is you'd like 2x the amount of data you have if you want a long history. But you can get by with 1.5x if all the files on your source drive aren't changing frequently which is true the vast majority of the time.\nIf you just want to make regular, scheduled, clones of your drive you can use something like Carbon Copy Cloner, which includes a feature for scheduling clones, to take a snapshot of your source drive to a target drive that doesn't contain incremental backups, but is made by taking an incremental update approach. It will only update files on the target if they've changed since the last backup was made and the target drive will only contain the state of your source drive as it was the last time a backup was done.\n\nA: The following website has a wealth of information about Time Machine:\nhttp://pondini.org/TM/Home.html\nincluding this page detailing how it uses hard links to only back up what has changed: \nhttp://pondini.org/TM/Works.html\nand this page detailing much space you would need on an external drive:\nhttp://pondini.org/TM/1.html\n", "Q: Prioritize network usage by app? I have one folder of old videos backing up via an uploader app (odrive), but it's 200 GB so it will take a few days.\nWhile that's happening I need to upload a small (50MB) video which I need to send to a client for review (in a different folder) – NOW! – via another app (CloudApp).\nSo now the big backup is holding up my need-it-now upload.\nIs there any way to have the 2nd app take over priority and/or \"throttle\" the first app until it's done uploading?\n\nA: Implementing quality of service on the network client/endpoint is generally a waste of time and therefore (I presume) no one has made that sort of software for OS X.\nThere isn't an easy way to go in and fiddle with things without tearing down the transfers that are in progress and I can probably infer that you can't resume either transfer easily or you would have simply paused the first to see if it helped the second already.\nA more viable option going forward is to use a network protocol that lets you pause one and resume a partial transfer for the long acting transfers.\n\n\n*\n\n*transmit.app allows you to pause transfers\n\n*rsync effectively allows you to resume transfers since it can pick up a partial transfer in the middle of a large file when it gets interrupted.\n\n", "Q: New drive + new OS, but will Time Machine restore old OS? I have a 2011 MacBook Pro and it was running OS 10.7. I use Time Machine regularly. Just had the harddrive replaced with an SSD and OS 10.11. If I restore from Time Machine instead of Migration Assistant will the restore revert to the old 10.7 OS? \nIf I use Migration Assistant to pull files from Time Machine, what will I lose? Apps? 'Date created' metadata?\n(It's possible I haven't understood enough to state the question clearly.)\n\nA: Using Migration Assistant is the same as restoring from a Time Machine backup. Restore data from your Time Machine backup will not change the version of OS X that you are running (i.e. you will remain at OS X 10.11 regardless of the version of OS X that created the backup).\nYou lose none of your information or metadata. You will not restore any system files, but all other files from your backup will be restored, including but not limited to files you created and saved, along with their metadata (date modified, etc).\n", "Q: Accidentally changed owner of /var system folder recursively to myself Long story short, accidentally I ran\nsudo chown -R myusername /var/\n\nand now my mac won't boot anymore (after entering user password for hdd decryption loading bar is slowly filled and after it gets full, nothing happens). I have access to the hdd via the OS X restore utilities (Cmd+R) on startup and managed to mount my hdd using terminal. What should I do to fix this? Should I sudo chown -R root /var/ now?\nI also tried fixing the disk using Disk Utilities First aid, but that didnt work.\n\nA: Since the system isn't bootable (in the normal sense), one easy way forward is to boot to Recovery HD and re-install the OS. There are thousands of files in /private/var that should be owned by root:wheel, _softwareupdate:_softwareupdate, myusername:staff, and hundreds root:admin so carpet bombing one ownership across the directories might lead to even worse breakage.\nA reinstallation won't delete anything in the user and application folders but it also may or may not work - depending on if it moves aside /private and makes a new one or if it runs the equivalent of sudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --repair --standard-pkgs --volume / which is a way to \"repair permissions\" on El Capitan if you managed to get things running again. If you have a recent backup, you could always just erase and reinstall from that.\nI would try this as a first step to see if your system is salvageable. The repair_packages tool will run in single user mode, so that might be a nice thing to try after mounting / as read write (the syntax is provided when you boot). That tool used to be something you could run from Disk Utility, but now it's a command line tool for more specialized use apparently.\n\nA: What group is it chowned to? You could try adding yourself to the root group and then doing sudo chown -R yourusername:root /var, then make sure group access is set to whatever right now owner access is at (so if it's rwx-r-r make it rwx-rwx-r)\n", "Q: Filing Sent messages in a folder other than sent messages folder Is there a way to create a rule in Apple Mail that will copy every sent message to another folder?

It's unable to web browse to many common websites which normally auto-escalate from HTTP to HTTPS.  Example, one can normally go to trello.com or pinterest.com just by that name in the browser and it'll auto bounce up to HTTPS.  With this new machine it fails to connect.  However, if you manually do https in the URL bar, it will connect.\nNotably it doesn't affect all websites (google.com is fine, among others).  It's also limited to this specific machine.  Our old Macs don't exhibit the same behavior.  OS X is fully up to date.  I've even tested with Firefox and the problem happens there too, so it appears to be OS level (although, above ICMP level as pings work perfectly fine of course).\n\nA: Wondering if this might be related to instances where some http sites were being redirected to non-existent https sites.  Try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clear your browser cache in Safari\n\n*Close Safari\n\n*Delete ~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist\n\n\nA: We ended up having to reimage the machine with a fresh install of OS X.  \nOther quirky problems were also found (with wifi and connecting to servers).

Using OS X 10.11.1 El Capitan, sometimes I'm confronted with a 'nonresponsive window': a program that keeps stalling for like 10-30 seconds. In most cases this happens to be Adobe Photoshop, but I've encountered it with other programs as well (e.g. Firefox or Chrome).\nNote that the program isn't completely frozen or cashed, it's just doing some heavy calculations or whatever, and the window doesn't respond (I can't click or drag it) but eventually it comes back to life and continues working normally.\nI can reproduce it, for example by having a very large image open in Photoshop and then going File > Save for Web.\nWhile this is happening, I get the spinning color wheel, and I can't bring other program windows to the front. For example if Photoshop is stalling, I would like to cmd+tab to my browser or whatever and do something else there. But that doesn't work, the stuck Photoshop window remains in front of any other program I switch to.\nIs there a way to hide or minimize such a program in OS X, so I can continue to work in others while this particular thing does whatever it needs to do? \nNote that I do NOT want to force quit or kill a program, it need to keep running, it just needs to do so in the background, allowing me to use other programs meanwhile.\nEdit:  Cmd ⌘   Tab ⇥   still works, but Photoshop will not drop to the background whilst busy, as in this illustration…\n\n\nA: I'm tempted to post this as an answer, even without full info…\nI am assuming that if you cannot  Cmd ⌘   Tab ⇥   to another app at this point, it is because the entire machine is currently too busy to respond, not just the frontmost app.\nIf an app itself is unresponsive [& you can see other apps around/behind it, i.e. not full screen or maximised], you ought to be able to simply move the cursor outside that unresponsive app & the daisy wheel will go away, returning to the standard cursor. Clicking one of the other apps will bring it to the front.  Cmd ⌘   Tab ⇥   at this point would also work.\nIf the daisy wheel doesn't go away outside the borders of the unresponsive app, then the entire machine is too busy to respond - usually just temporarily, until whatever process taking all the resources has finished its task.\nPhotoshop processing a very large image for the web is just the kind of task that can temporarily use large amounts of RAM & CPU. I just tested on a 5000 x 3000 image. Photoshop went busy for approx 15s, RAM usage doubled & CPU usage went to 100% [which is 1/24th of the number of virtual cores I have, so in essence used one core to its fullest] . I was able to change screens, switch to other apps etc, but I'm running on a 12-core Mac Pro with 64GB RAM.  \nFrom this snapshot you can see the brief effect [highlighted in red] on the cores & the drop to 'not responding' in Activity Monitor.\nPerhaps try some comparison tests & see what figures you get at the same point.\n\n", "Q: Getting rid of icloud on old iphone Bought an iphone 6.

I need Chrome to restore last session tabs after closing its whole window. \nSimple \"continue where you left off\" does not work when I close Chrome's window.\nI was looking for the resolution but all I got is useless answers provided by apple fanboys \"that is the proper way - closing window does not mean closing a program\". Sincerly, I don't accept it.\nHow to achieve proper behaviour of \"continue where you left off\"?\n\nA: To add to a previous answer (one by Charlie74), if you happen to accidentally close the window using the red x at the top, you can quickly get back all your tabs by using commandshiftT. This is usually used to reopen a recently closed tab, but also works to reopen a recently closed window.\n\nA: First, you want to make sure the setting is enabled in Chrome.    In the upper left corner of the screen, you'll want to click on Chrome -> Preferences and make sure the \"continue where you left off\" button is checked.\nNext, please do understand there is a difference between closing a window and closing a program.   Command - Q is used to exit a program completely.    In OS X, if you close a window using the \"red x\" in the upper left corner, you are closing out a window, and not the program.    \nTo see this work correctly...  try opening 3-4 tabs.

When using Mail.app to access a gmail account, will images get pulled from the google image proxy servers or from the original servers? \nFrom https://support.google.com/mail/answer/145919?hl=en\n\nHow Gmail makes images safe\n  Some senders try to use externally linked images in harmful ways, but Gmail takes action to ensure that images are loaded safely. Gmail serves all images through Google’s image proxy servers and transcodes them before delivery to protect you in the following ways:\nSenders can’t use image loading to get information like your IP address or location.\n  Senders can’t set or read cookies in your browser.\n  Gmail checks your images for known viruses or malware.\n  In some cases, senders may be able to know whether an individual has opened a message with unique image links. As always, Gmail scans every message for suspicious content and if Gmail considers a sender or message potentially suspicious, images won’t be displayed and you’ll be asked whether you want to see the images.\n\n\nA: Apple's Mail.app fetches email over IMAP. Gmail does not replace any image URLs when email is accessed through IMAP, therefore images come directly from the original source.\nYou can verify that by reviewing the raw source of the email in your IMAP client (e.g. Mail.app).

The machine obviously isn't stressing about it, it seems to just be an arbitrary delay.\n\nA: Tapping with the trackpad has a delay while the trackpad decides which gesture you are performing. Disabling some gestures will remove this delay in certain cases:\n\n\n*\n\n*If “Smart zoom” is turned on, then a two-finger tap needs to wait to see if you are performing a two-finger double tap.\n\n*If dragging is enabled (“with drag lock” or “without drag lock”), then a one-finger tap needs to wait to see if you are performing a double tap. (This setting hides in the Accessibility preference pane.)\n\n", "Q: System storage not being correctly represented in 'About This Mac' For some reason, in the 'About this mac' under storage, my mac running el capitan (macbook pro 13\" early 2015) doesnt correctly display how much storage i've used.

It will also slow you computer considerably, using up almost all of one of your CPU cores, and about 2 GB ram. This is from my experience on a 1 TB hard drive, so it may be less or more intense for you.\nP.S. Plug in your charger before doing this.\n\nA: Figured out the issue for my case.\nIn Terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type cd /cores\nIf the folder is not there, you can ignore the rest of this post.\n\n\n*\n\n*Type ls.

I have a message in my inbox which I would like to print, but Mail associates it with a conversation in another mailbox and the print preview shows the entire conversation.  How do I print just the message in my inbox?\n\nA: Mail does only print the selected email in a conversation rather than the entire conversation.\nThe problem is that the selected email at the end of an email chain includes a quoted copy of the previous emails. This can't be removed as it is part of the email that you selected. If you only want the text that the author of the email wrote, you will need to copy the content out into a text document and print that instead.\n", "Q: iPhoto to Photos issue I just took my computer into the Mac store and had it upgraded to El Capitan. I had iPhoto on my old version, I believe it was Lion. Before I took my computer in, I backed my computer up to a Seagate external drive. \nWhen I got my computer back, I realized that iPhoto is no longer being used by Mac. So, based on advice that I read on this site, I re-downloaded iPhoto onto my computer; however, it will not let me import pictures from the hard drive. There is a grey \"X\" through the iPhoto icon and when I click on it it tells me that \"You can’t open the application “iPhoto” because it is in a Time Machine backup.\" I have 7 years of pictures on there, and I am afraid I may have lost them for good. \nAny ideas on how I get my pictures off my hard drive and back onto my computer? I don't care if they are in Photo or iPhotos, I just want them back.\n\nA: Neither iPhoto nor Photos stores any photos—they are applications which access the photos stored within iPhoto libraries and Photos libraries respectively. The library is what stores the photos, which is what you should be transferring from your backup.\nThe library is stored by default in your Photos folder within your home folder, and stores all of your photos (providing you are not using referenced masters). Photos (the application) is part of OS X and you should not be restoring it from a backup.\n", "Q: Time Machine over the network fails and reports incorrect available space I use Time Machine to backup my iMac to a MacBook Pro which is running OS X server.  Both are running 10.11.1; the Server version is 5.0.15.  Time Machine had been running fine using a 4TB USB drive on the server.  Yesterday I added a 6TB drive and switched the iMac to use it (again, over the network).\nNow Time Machine fails after about 90 seconds and reports \"The backup disk needs 743.84 GB for the backup but only 509.94 GB are available...\"  The Time Machine System Preference panel then shows \"510 GB of 510 GB available,\" which is strange because before the failure it correctly indicated \"6 TB of 6 TB available.\"\nI have doubled checked the formatting of the 6TB drive (HFS+ Journaled, GUID Partition Map) and confirmed that the server also shows 6TB available.  I have also reset Time Machine backups (http://pondini.org/TM/A4.html), rebooted both computers, shutdown and restarted the Time Machine service, and basically started everything I know of from scratch twice.\nAny solutions or hints will be quite welcome!\n\nA: After a bit of digging into the details, I discovered that the sparse image created by Time Machine was limited to about 500GB (475Gi to be exact).  Here is abbreviated output from 'df -h' with both the network share (TMBackups6) and sparse image (disk5s2) mounted:\n$ df -h\n//xxx@xxx._smb._tcp.local/TMBackups6 5.5Ti 1.7Gi 5.5Ti ...\n/dev/disk5s2                         475Gi 427Mi 475Gi ...\n\nSeeing this, I double checked the \"Limit each backup...\" setting on the server;  the checkbox was cleared, which should mean no limits.  Still, the evidence pointed to enforcement of the default 500GB limit.\nAt this point I started thinking about creating the sparse image manually with the limit set to a sensible value.  However, I don't do this often a did not relish spending time figuring it out.  Instead, I set the limit to 9999GB and now Time Machine is backing up properly.  To change the limit,\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Server app.\n\n*Click on the Time Machine service in the left column.\n\n*Double click the backup destination on which to set the limit.\n\n*Check the Backup Limit check box.\n\n*Change the limit in the text box to be larger than the backup drive.\n\n*Click the OK button.\n\n\nHere is a screen shot (cropped) showing the results of steps 4 and 5 with the check box and text box highlighted in yellow (OK button not shown):\n\nI do not yet know if setting the limit larger than the size of the physical drive will cause problems in the future. I believe from Maverick on, Time Machine is aware of both the physical drive size and maximum size of the sparse image.  So don't expect problems.\nI am satisfied with this work around for now.  If anyone knows the root cause and a real permanent fix, I would appreciate the info.\n", "Q: Conflicting Settings in OSX Server Profile Manager (Groups and Users/Devices) please help me understand what happens if you have nested groups in Profile Manager and you apply conflicting Settings. Which Setting will be Carried oft?\nE.g.:\nI have the following groups:\nAll\n|-Teachers\n|-Students\n\nSo Teachers and Students are nested in All. \nWhen you activate a Setting or configure a payload in All. And you deactivate the Setting in Teachers: how will a User belonging to teachers be configured?\nAnd what Happens if you additionally change this users' settings conflicting with the above.\n\nA: I found the answer to this question myself accidentially.\nPlease check this site for a more detailed explanation. There is no single answer to this\nCondensed:\n\nSome settings, such as controlling which items are opened at login, are cumulative because no one particular setting overrides another — any number of items can be opened at login.\n  Some settings are inherited from workgroups to the user level or from within nested workgroups. Settings with only one ultimate outcome — such as the position of the Dock onscreen — use an order of priority to override the same setting for different account levels. The prioritization of conflicting preferences to override the same setting also applies for inheritance. The order of inheritance and overriding preferences is\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Workgroup (the least specific level)   \n\n\n*\n\n*Device group   \n\n\n*\n\n*Device   \n\n\n*\n\n*User (the most specific level)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, a preference set at the workgroup level can’t override the same preference set for the computer group, computer, or user level. In this sense, a preference set for the user always wins when overriding other levels.\n", "Q: Why do file transfers take a long time to stop? I encounter this problem a lot, and I've also had it on Windows.\nIt doesn't matter if it's over a network, or locally on a hard drive, but file transfers never stop when I click the stop button. They always take 20-30+ seconds to stop.\nI have encountered this issue across multiple Macs, and even on my old Windows PCs I used to use.\nIs there something inherent about file transfers that cause this massive delay?\n\nA: With file transfers, both copy and move, cancelling the operation tries to not interrupt the current file being transferred. When interrupting a file transfer, Finder finishes the current file, so that you are not left with two corrupt half-files in both locations. This means you can continue the operation later, or move the files back (if it's a move), if you so wish.\n\nA: I have had the following problem on and off for a while, and here is how I solved it.\nI believe after researching on this topic for a long time and running a few tests on a couple of machines, that when the Finder is slow to duplicate / move / delete a file has to do with the graphics cars and background tasks which are difficult to troubleshoot.\nI am not claiming that this solution is 100% efficient, and I am certainly not an expert, but it worked exceptionally well for me, and has the advantage of being quite fast and simple, so I wanted to share it.\nThe process I followed made these tasks much faster immediately, and was actually a simple process to follow compared to other, more complex solutions I have seen online:\n-if you're running Time Machine, eject it for a moment, you can plug it back after trying these steps - Time Machine will often run in the background without necessarily being obvious, but it consumes RAM and probably also the same resources that are necessary to deal with files;\n\n-if you have peripherals plugged in the computer, unplug them all except for the ones that are required to operate basic tasks (keyboard, mouse...). This is also true for memory cards and others more discreet peripherals (bluetooth, etc);\n\n-if there are lots of icons on the desktop of your computer, clean it and reduce the amount of icons to a bare minimum. This is an important step, as I believe that having images (JPEGs, etc) and sometimes even folders on the desktop sucks a lot of power from the machine, as it is constantly using the graphics card and RAM to display thumbnails;\n\n-if there are folders that contain more than 1000 elements on your machine, break this number into smaller numbers by creating dated folders or categorizing. I believe that running extensive file trees also consumes a lot of efficiency for the machine as it constantly catalogs files in the background;\n\n-after saving your work or documents or your tabs, quit all the applications you are not using, and try to only ever use under 4-5 applications at the same time while always quitting the ones you are not currently using;\n\n-if you have many tabs of Safari (or another browser) open at the same time, or a few tabs that are extensive in their use of JavaScript or Flash, reduce the number of tabs to be under 20. This is another very important step to increase the computer's performance, as frequent background tasks on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, etc can load the computer's performance drastically;\n\n-give your hard-drive some breathing space. If you're running RAM-greedy apps such as Safari or Firefox with lots of tabs open or creative applications (image editing, 3D, etc) on very little free HD space, it's also without a doubt one reason why the computer has trouble multitasking. It's time to use a file)mapping application, and back-up externally the files that are encumbering the hard drive and that you use the least often;\n\n-once all these steps have been followed, repair permissions on the hard drive of your machine and restart.\n\nThings should go much better after these steps have been followed.\nGood luck, and if you have any comments, feel free to share them below.\n", "Q: Change output color of terminal (in Mac) to be different from typed text color I know how to change the color of ls output, but I would like to change the color of all terminal output.\nTo make clear what I mean, below is a picture of my terminal.

I pay Apple for 200 GB of storage with iCloud Drive.\nWhat are the steps to share a 60 GB file with someone?\n\nA: In general, iCloud is not a person-to-person sharing platform. It is mostly restricted to sharing with your devices, so there is almost no capability to share with others. It does have the ability to share Photos and videos in a limited fashion, called 'Family Sharing\". \nIn El Capitan, Apple introduced a feature called Mail Drop. This feature duplicates what many have done using services such as Dropbox: it automatically uploads a large file to iCloud, and embeds a link to that file in the email message. \nIf your recipient uses Apple Mail in Yosemite or El Capitan, Apple Mail automatically downloads the file from iCloud, so it looks like the attachment was sent via mail, when really only the link was sent via mail.\nFor more on how this works, here is the latest Apple support info.\nThis sounds perfect for your needs. However, Mail Drop has a limit to the file size of 5GB. It claims not to work on file sizes over 5GB (no direct personal experience). Therefore, it likely won't support your use case of 60GB.\nDropbox and Box.com do work in this manner and allow you to create both public and private links to whatever files you wish. Both offer free tiers, however, the free accounts are limited to 5GB, so your 60GB file will required a pay account.\nHonestly, given the size of your file, it might be simpler, and far cheaper to put your file on a 64GB USB stick and use snail mail.\n\nA: In 2018 this is now something you can share out.

I would like to complete the initial setup of a Mac Mini (2015) without having to use an external monitor (or a mouse or keyboard).\nI do have a MacBook Pro available in case this would help (and from which I would like to remotely setup the MacMini), but I thought that I would be able to just follow the procedure discussed by Apple here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202542\nBasically, that article says you should be able to see the Mac in your shared computers section and just start ScreenSharing. However, this doesn't work and I am suspecting it only worked for MacMini Server models back when they sold them. Today, Apple only sells a \"Server.app\" from the Mac App store and the \"helpful\" comments on that help desk article say:\n\nAdopting Server app\nOn the server, open the Mac App Store.\nSign in with your Apple ID. OS X Server should appear in your purchase history. This is for verification only.\nOn your administrator computer, open the Mac App Store.\nSign in with the same Apple ID as in step 2.\nGo to the Purchases tab and install OS X Server.\n\nWell, that clearly requires a Monitor, right ?\nIs there no way at all to setup a Mac Mini (with the help of just a MacBook Pro)?\nCurrent state: I can see the MacMini on the network - well I can PING it and confirmed the MAC Address - so I know its on the network, but I can't SSH or VNC into it ...\nIdeas:\nTarget Disk Mode (TDM):\nWith the help of a keyboard I might be able to start the Mac Mini in TDM and somehow install whatever I want on it. I don't exactly see this solving my problem, though - unless I could do this from another Mac Mini. A MacBook Pro OS X installation will look different to the one performed through a Mac Mini, I believe, but please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nA: I contacted the Apple Support Hotline and got the expected answer: setting up a Mac Mini without an external monitor is not possible (unless you happen to know and correctly perform the exact order of keystrokes necessary to complete the setup with an attached keyboard).\nThis actually got me thinking: What if I could attach a pre-programmed keyboard that delivers the required input timed appropriately to the required wait-times, etc and generate a universal \"Mac setup adapter\"? I could imagine the \"Teensyduino\" being the prefect fit for this job. Unfortunately, though, I don't have one of those lying around at the moment, but it would be worth considering if one really had to do a larger scale setup of such machines.\nSolution: In contrast to my initial concerns about using Target Disk Mode, apparently people have previously had success installing OS X onto another computer in this way. There are two different approaches here:\n\n\n*\n\n*We can try to re-install OS X (onto the Mac Mini in TDM from the MBP), which in my view is not a very good solution. \n\n*We can run the initial setup only by booting into the Mac Mini OS X partition from the MBP (by starting the Mac Mini in TDM).\n\n\nThe secondary option appeals to me, but either solution does require a Thunderbolt (or FireWire) cable. The process would look something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down MBP and Mac Mini.\n\n*Start Mac Mini in TDM and connect the cable to the MBP.\n\n*Start the MBP while holding the OPTION key to select the Mac Mini hard drive as the boot partition.\n\n*Complete the initial setup and activate any remote access features you want.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to modify the behavior of Finder UI elements with AppleScript?

Did a restore to Yosemite. Tried to install El-Capitan, which didn't go well at first (I would download it and then get a message telling me it was corrupt when I tried to install). This morning, I re-downloaded and the install kicked off (progress!). However, it stalled and now shows the grey apple and a progress bar (about 95% completed). It's been like that for hours. \nI tried to re-start but it goes right back to this screen. I ran disk utility, but nothing came up.\nI'm not a mac user, so I'm not sure what steps to try next. Do I need to do another restore to Yosemite? \n\nA: Apple Support: 1-800-275-2273 (Or you can get it from here)\nCall, it wont take long, and you don't need to have applecare or anything like that. And this way, if something breaks, maybe you'll be eligible for some kind of reimbursement.\nYou can do the whole thing with your phone on speaker. I actually tried to call them myself (and then relay the information) but one of the first things they ask for is a serial number. \nThe occasions i've called them are all blurred together, but i vaguely remember being told to hold the power button for some specific length of time, holding some key while it started up (which might have been to activate disk utility), and unplugging the iMac. \nThe key thing, though, is that i called them, it didn't take long, and in doing so i was able to fix it.\n\nA: A lot of  things can could be the cause of the failure to upgrade. Issues include a failing HDD, invalid computer date, corrupted installer image, a corrupted operating system prior to upgrading, and possibly others.\n\n\n*\n\n*A failing hard disk can cause spastic hard drive performance. A\nfailing disk might struggle and lag when attempting to read and write\nfrom the disk.\n\n*I've noticed that OS X installers (at least the newer ones) run some\nkind of date check prior to starting the installation. My guess is\nthat the installer checks the computer's date to ensure the \"date\" is\nafter the installer was downloaded. Anyway, the error usually\nsignifies that the \"installer couldn't be verified\" or something like\nthat. The computer's date can be set using the terminal command date\n[mm][dd][hh][mm][yy] (month, day, hour, minute, year). This issue is\nparticularly prevalent when running an installer on a computer that\nhas been without a power source for a long time as a power loss will\ncause the clock to reset.\n\n*If you are installing off of a USB or network recovery device, the\ninstallation may have be corrupted either because of a read error or \na bad connection to the installation image source. The image\noriginally downloaded from the App Store may also be corrupt. In\nwhich case, re-download the image and attempt the installation again.\n\n*An upgrade is different from a clean installation. A clean\ninstallation involves simply installing macOS onto a drive with\nnothing already on it. An upgrade, on the other hand, involves\npreserving your files while writing the new OS files into place.\nSometimes, when performing an upgrade, there may already be junk on\nthe disk that interferes with the installation process.\n\n*Another issue I've experienced is failure of the motherboard though\nyour particular issue doesn't hint at a failing board.\n\n\nThere are likely other causes which I have yet to run across. \n", "Q: Error when running security in Terminal I'm trying to export the keychains in Terminal.

To free up disk space, I'm asking if it's possible and safe to remove some apps from my Mac OS X Yosemite download that I never use. If \"yes\", how do I do this safely and, hopefully, quickly.\n\nA: The short answer is: Yes, you can delete apps without \"damaging\" other apps.\nI assume by \"Yosemite download\" you mean your original full download of the Yosemite operating system and not the \"Download folder\" only.\nThe slightly longer answer is: Just go into the applications folder and delete the apps you don't think you need. First, make sure you go into the Mac App Store and credit any possible apps to your account, though. This way, you can delete iMovie for example and later just re-download it from the Mac App Store if you need to.\nDeleting an application from the Applications folder will not damage any other app, but I wouldn't recommend deleting anything from the \"Utilities\" folder.\nThe bigger problem is that for example Garage Band (if its installed) also has templates and other things installed in Library folders, which also take up quite a bit of space. I wish Apple would allow a bit more flexibility during installation.\n", "Q: Switching MBP from hard drive to SSD I have a mid 2010 13\" MBP that I am wanting to last me a couple more years.\nIt was suggested I get a SSD to replace my hard drive, so I bought it but need to know some stuff before switching to it. \nI have an external hard drive that I back everything up to. After I have backed up everything, what's the best way to go about putting back the Mac OS, iTunes, Microsoft Office, Pictures, Documents, etc. that I want on the SSD? I don't want to put everything back onto the MBP, just things I use most often.\n\nA: You can \"restore\" to a new Mac during setup from a Time Machine Backup. This would be the most straight forward solution, but it won't let you selectively pick and choose what to restore.\nAn option still involving Time Machine would be to exclude locations that you don't want to backup and restore fully (such as the Applications folder) and just backup that folder manually onto some external hard drive.\nA clean way would be to just install Mac OS X fresh onto that hard drive and copy everything \"by hand\". This gives you most control over which files will be copied and which you don't need anymore, but it'll take you much longer.\nIn regards to how to do it all (install Mac OS X onto your new SSD hard drive), I would consider this:\nCurrently I assume you have three hard drives. The first one inside your MBP (the internal hard drive). The second one in your external hard drive (1TB Seagate with the Time Machine Backup on it). And the third one is your new SSD (currently not in any case).\nOPTION 1 (if you can't tinker with your external hard drive)\n\n\n*\n\n*Attach the external hard drive (Seagate) to your MBP.\n\n*Partition the drive into 2 partitions with Disk Utility (hopefully this will work without having to erase everything)\n\n*Install OS X from your MacBook Pro directly onto the external SSD drive. You probably have to download the installer again and need to select the correct install target partition during the setup.\n\n*Build the SSD into your MBP.\n\n*Start the MBP while holding the OPTION key then select the external OS X partition (also well explained here: http://osxdaily.com/2014/10/18/clean-install-os-x-yosemite/ - this also applies to El Capitan)\n\n*Now repeat the OS X installation procedure onto your internal SSD drive\n\n*Restart the MBP and hold OPTION again, this time select the internal SSD\n\n*Restore with Migration Assistant or manually.\n\n\nOPTION 2 (if you can't partition your external hard drive)\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the SSD drive into the external hard drive case (switch it with the external hard drive)\n\n*Connect the external hard drive (with SSD inside) to your MacBook Pro through USB\n\n*Format the SSD to whatever you prefer and Mac OS X supports (HFS+ usually)\n\n*Install OS X from your MacBook Pro directly onto the external SSD drive (over USB)\n\n*After installation is completed build the SSD from the external case into the internal MacBook Pro (this is the first and only time you open the MBP).\n\n*Put the second (external) hard drive (with your Time Machine Backup on it) back into the external hard drive case (to connect over USB).\n\n*Restart the MBP and connect the external backup over USB, then start the Migration Assistant, which will let you restore from a TM Backup.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can also put your original hard drive from the MBP into the external housing in Step 6 and just copy everything manually (and skip Step 7).\n\nA: I would say use the migration assistant. But if you are only wanting to keep select items then you really only need to copy over the items from your user folder.\nFrom the external navigate to:\n/users/*youraccount*\nOpen a 2nd Finder window and navigate to your user folder by pressing command+G in a Finder window and typing ~ into the location field and pressing enter.\nDrag and drop whatever you want from the external to your User folder.\n", "Q: Garbled screen graphics after wake up Macbook from full battery drain A couple times now when my Macbook Pro running Yosemite was left unplugged overnight (with the screen open) I have come back to it like this \n(That's the drained battery symbol that indicates you need to plug in your Mac) \nThe graphics continue to be garbled like that when it starts up after some charging. The problem is resolved when the computer restarts.\nMy question is: should I be concerned by this? I have never seen this on other Apple devices. My device is still under warranty, so I could take it in, but if it's not really a problem / won't get worse than this, maybe not worth the effort.\n\nA: I have a 2008 15\" MacBook Pro that does the same thing. Every time the battery drains, and I plug it back in, the screen will be completely distorted (but will go back to normal after reboot). Apple has replaced my logic board twice for this problem, and it still occurs. It's just an annoyance, as the laptop is still running great 7 years later. I wouldn't worry too much about it, unless it begins to happen while using the OS. \n\nA: I bought a macbookpro mid 2015 and after 3 day the video card crashed, so I tooked it to the store and they gave me a new one.\nAfter a month usin the new computer I got this screen when the battery drained, so I went back to the store and they replaced my computer again.\nNow, 3 days after using the new computer I just realized it does the same thing, so I have to go back to the store :/\nThey have a great service though -\n", "Q: How to restore user account from different boot?

Still have a Yosemite partition on the same computer though.\nWhat I want to know is, is there a way, from outside the Mavericks boot, to change the home folder info?

Each time the name is different which is always a randomly generated haphazard mixture of letters and numbers. Is it possible that my system be infected with some malware. I have reinstalled the OS, El Captain, to get rid of this particular issue but at times I can still see the connection there. Do I need to worry about this?\n\nAny ideas will be appreciated.\nRegards\n\nA: This is quite likely (no guarantee) that there is someone nearby with a WiFi device (Phone, printer, WiFi 4G router, etc) that generates a different name each time it turns on.\nNote that the signal strength is pretty low. so it is not likely all that nearby. Using a WiFi stumbler might give you more information about the device as most WiFi devices will often self-identify with a Manufacturers name or model number. The stumbler software could also potentially help you locate at least which direction the WiFi source is.\nIs it possible that someone is nearby trying to hack into your systems? Yeah. Is it likely? No, unless you have a lot of money or have access to valuable information or goods, or a person of interest to someone gathering intelligence on you it is unlikely you are a persistent target of attack.\n", "Q: How does AirDrop retain \"Developer Verification\" information?

However, when e-mail is used, the error regarding an unknown developer prevents the app from running. Why is AirDrop successful and e-mail not?\nIs there something I can do to share the app and retain the developer information?\n\nA: Apps are actually containers, if the container doesn't contain a verified developer certificate then you will see that message pop-up when you try to open the app.\nIf you right click and select open it will still let you open the app, irregardless if it is from a verified developer or not.\n", "Q: iPad mini - change ID for App Store I have 2 email addresses.

Without any information about the phone other than the IMEI, there's not a lot he can do.\n\nA: If anybody calls or messages the lost phone, and a notification appears on the lock screen, you can call them back without unlocking the phone.

I noticed that the mDNSResponder process on my machine accepted an incoming connection from the name given to my machine in relation to sharing capabilities (xxx's-MacBook-Pro.local) on port 53. Despite reading about the Wikipedia article on Bonjour, I still don't really understand what it specifically does.\nIn this case, was mDNSResponder trying to see what sharing capabilities were enabled on my machine? \n\nA: Without more information about what monitoring tool you're using and exactly what it's showing, it's hard to say for sure what's going on. But I can tell you a little bit. mDNSResponder has three main jobs on OS X:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sending out multicast DNS (mDNS aka Bonjour) lookups to the local network on port 5353 (and listening for responses). These include both looking up names (e.g. \"I'm trying to contact somethingorother.local; what's its IP address?\") and looking up available services (e.g. \"what computers on the local network provide AFP file sharing services?\").\n\n*Listening for and responding to mDNS lookups that apply to it. For example, if its Bonjour name is xxxs-MacBook-Pro.local and it sees a request for xxxs-MacBook-Pro.local, it'll reply with its IP address(es). Similarly, if you have AFP file sharing turned on and it sees a request for AFP servers, it'll reply (\"Me! I'm xxx's MacBook Pro and I provide AFP service on port 548!\").\n\n*Sending out normal (unicast) DNS lookups on port 53 to some DNS server (and listening for responses). Names that end in \".local\" get sent out via mDNS; everything else (e.g. \"www.apple.com\") gets sent via normal DNS to the server(s) configured in the network settings.\nIf you're seeing activity on port 53, that's normal DNS. I'm not sure why you're seeing it as an incoming connection (unless it's really a reply to request you sent out?), or why the source would be your own computer. For those, I'd need more detailed info about what you're seeing.\n", "Q: The Download Preview window in the Dock - how to change sequence Since 10.11, the order of items in the Downloads folder in the Dock has changed to alphabetic.

(dot) in it If I enter whoami in Terminal.app my id is shown as Abhi.Sri\nNow if I do  chown -R Abhi.Sri /usr/local it says the user Abhi.Sri is invalid. \n\nA: I think your short username is malformed. I recommend to rename it to lower case characters (and no special characters except the underscore).\nAdditionally you would have to use a sudoers account (e.g. an admin account) and prepend sudo to change ownership of /usr/local since /usr/local is owned by root:wheel. Changing the ownership of /usr/local and subsequent items is non-standard and not recommended.\n\nA: The terminal might be interpreting the dot ('.') as a wildcard character.\nI'm not at my Mac, so I can't test this, but try escaping the '.' with a backslash:\nchown -R Abhi\\.Sri /usr/local\n", "Q: Most of the time spotlight is showing nothing after upgrading to el capitan I use spotlight a lot but after upgrading to el capitan most of the time its showing empty window.\nIts very annoying.

However I am somewhat hesitant about allowing the entire 10.10.5 system to use the Python.framework from 10.10.3.\nIs there a way to force only the Calendar Server process to use the 10.10.3 Python.framework, while the rest of the system can use the new one that came with 10.10.5?\nI updated the server a few days ago and none of the people who depend on those calendars can access them right now. The fix offered by several other places was to update to 10.11, but I have some other applications that must run on this server that only work on 10.10, and are broken on 10.11. I'm sure there's no way to make them work on 10.11, so the only option for me right now is to stick with 10.10.\n\nA: A dangerous way to move forward is to use the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable to change which python framework the calendar server uses. You will need to edit the launchd plist for the calendar server inside of the Server.app bundle to add your the environment variable. Look in Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/  for the file.\nThe man pages for launchd.plist(5) and dyld(1) will be useful. Also the otool -L command may help you track down dependancies.\nI'm not sure how well the calendar server will run with these changes.\n", "Q: How to add app icon for iPad Pro in Xcode In Xcode 7.1 and 7.1.1 there is no slot for app icon for iPad Pro. I have no idea how to put in an app icon for iPad Pro.\nHow can it be done? Does the App Store make the scaled version of the iPad Air app icon onto iPad Pro? \n\nA: You need Xcode 7.2 beta 3 or later to add iPad Pro app icons (167 × 167) to asset catalogs.\nrdar://22915712\n", "Q: Are there any good reasons to NOT symlink 'System Folders' like Photos or Music? I am currently adopting oDrive for all my cloud storage needs. The only restriction that oDrive has it that it creates a folder called 'ODRIVE' on your computer. Everything that you want to sync has to go in that folder. I have now symlinked my Creative Cloud folder (for adobe CC) but I would REALLY like to symlink my Movies, Music, Documents, etc. That way oDrive manages my backup process, I continue using my usual workflow of saving photos to Photos and music to Music.\nBut I'm uncertain of how the Apple OS treats those folders. As I believe they are \"System Folders\" and have requirements on them.\nSo is there any good reason to NOT symlink 'System Folders?'\n\nA: This is fine! Go ahead!\nSymlinks or hard links are followed by the system, so you're free to create them within any of those folders, or indeed the folder itself.\n", "Q: Cant recover from Time Machine Disk because [UPDATE NEEDED] I have an external drive with a bunch of backups and I want to make a restore from that disk. I've always been able to restore by starting the computer while pressing the option key and selecting the disk, where it would take me to an options panel where I could start the recovery process.\nBut when I try to access that disk now, It shows me a login page with a user called \"[UPDATE NEEDED]\". What should I do to pass this step? How can I make this work?\n\nA: from the answer to a very similar question from 2014:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Log in into the Mac as administrator.\n  \n*Backup the Mac with Time Machine (optional but recommended)\n  \n*Launch System Preferences selecting System Preferences from the Apple menu.\n  \n*Click the Security & Privacy preference pane.\n  \n*Click the FileVault tab.\n  \n*Unlock the pane clicking on the padlock (administrator password required)\n  \n*Disable FileVault and wait (…about 3hrs with a 250GB no SSD HD)\n  \n*Restart the Mac (optional but recommended)\n  \n*Go back the FileVault tab.\n  \n*Enable FileVault and wait (…about 7hrs for me!!!)\n  \n*Restart the Mac.\n  \n*The unknown user account will disappear.\n  \n*This should also now allow you to set automatic login.\n  \n\nI assume, if thats the only account listed, it has to be an administrator account.\nI know you might not be able or want to back up your drive again, though. So maybe this isnt what youre looking for (though that step is optional).\nalso heres a discussion on apple.com from 2011 with a similar question and answer. this one may be closer to your scenario as it also doesnt mention any accounts besides the \"update needed\" account\n", "Q: Audio from Lightning dock? Is Apple the only company that makes an iPhone dock with an audio out jack (3.5mm) that gets the audio straight from the Lightning port... as opposed to a separate audio plug? See example below:\n \nI'm looking for something that won't bend my cable as I intend to thread it and undo it several times.\n\nA: I can only find one other manufacturer, but I guess that's sufficient to say Apple are not the only company to make a dock with audio out from the Lightning port.\nHenge Docks Gravitas can do this.\nIt's not completely clear from the web page that there is no separate audio plug going into the phone, but the user guide is clearer.\nThis structure enables you to have the phone connected to both computer/charger & external speakers, simultaneously.\n\n", "Q: Use SSD partition on Mac Mini Fusion Drive through Windows Bootcamp I've been checking through so many questions here, a lot of forum posts, and I can't get a clear answer to what it is I think I want to do.\nI bought the fusion drive because well...SSD...I added a bootcamp installation of Windows 10 - which created a partition on the HDD (as far as I can tell based on what I've read so far) - I followed standard Bootcamp procedure.\nAnyways, I want to make use of the SSD on my Windows side as well - but I'm not sure how to go about doing this. I don't want to run Windows on the SSD itself, just certain applications like wamp, and my dropbox sync folder. I think it will provide some great performance for wamp and my php development needs.\nThis is what I've found when looking at Disk Management in Windows:\n\nAs can be seen there, Disk 0 is the HDD and Disk 1 is the SSD. Looking above you'll see the Windows partition, (BOOTCAMP (C:).\nAlso, the SSD, Capacity, 112.68GB, Used, 112.68GB - so...either Mac OS hasn't loaded anything into the SSD as yet, or perhaps Windows just can't read it? I don't know. The Mac Mini is brand new, and I didn't do that much prior to installing Windows.\nWould it cause any problems if I partitioned the SSD and formatted one partition as NTFS so that I could make use of it on my Windows side of things as well?\nThis must sound very stupid - but I'm not very familiar with all of this stuff...\nAny advice would be appreciated. Keep in mind, I need to use Mac as well as Windows.\n\nA: Yes, you'll mess stuff up if you partition it. The fusion drive creates a partition on each drive, which is put together to create the fusion drive. Windows cannot read HFS, so it assumes the disk is empty. Just leave your Windows partition on the HD, and everything should work fine.\n", "Q: How to get iTerm to properly send the CTRL-. sequence? Emacs uses a lot of C-. and similar keyboard sequences.\niTerm doesn't send the key sequence C-. itself, but I've found that I can map C-. into an escape sequence or hex code or text in iTerm's preferences/profile/keys. How can I get iTerm to send C-. as something that Emacs will recognize?\n\nA: You can view Emacs' key bindings by typing C-h, b. If you then search the help text for C-. you'll find this mapping:\nM-[ 2 7 ; 5 ; 4 6 ~ C-.\n\nThe ESC [ … ~ sequence is used to send arbitrary key combinations numerically, primarily for combinations that don't map to a specific character. Since Control-Period doesn't map to a character that can be sent to a terminal, map it to the character sequence ESC [ 2 7 ; 5 ; 4 6 ~ (without the spaces).\nThe second parameter in the escape sequence is a number representing the modifier keys and the third parameter is the base character. The modifier-key values are described at the end of the PC-Style Function Keys section of the XTerm Control Sequences documentation.\n", "Q: Using MBP as web server with many users I teach new media classes at a small liberal arts and sciences university. For the past several years, I have been running an Ubuntu server on an old desktop PC in my office. At the beginning of each semester, I create an account on the web server for each student. They learn how to use FTP to upload their digital projects, and some students experiment with basic UNIX command line options. The server recently died, and I'd love to swap in my old Macbook as the new server.\nI have spent the better part of a day trying to install Ubuntu 14.04 on a late-2011 MBP. Unfortunately, the dual graphics card configuration causes real problems for the Ubuntu installer. I've worked through multiple installation guides, and cannot manage to boot to the Ubuntu OS without manually editing the grub every single time.  \nIs it possible to accomplish my objectives while sticking with Yosemite on the MBP? Specifically, this is what I need to be able to do: \n\n\n*\n\n*SSH into the MBP server from my other computer in order to create new user accounts. \n\n*Allow students to connect to their FTP folders via SFTP. Over the course of a typical year, there would be probably be around 30 new user accounts created. \nReally... That's about all I need to do. I don't need a fancy graphical interface. I just want to telnet/FTP into the server and occasionally patch it to receive the latest security updates. \nI know that Macs have some sort of UNIX terminal under the shell. It would be so cool if I could just telnet/SSH to reach the machine from my desktop computer. Then, I could use basic UNIX commands to create user accounts. \n\nA: I'm sure you can create users manually from command line in OS X, and while I have a large *nix background, I'm only familiar with approaching this from a GUI standpoint in OS X (though like I said, this absolutely doesn't mean it can't be done.)\nSimply get on the console or enable remote administration for your OS X user and VNC to the Mac from your desktop.  Or install xRDP on the Mac, which is my personal preference for GUI access from Windows-to-Mac.\nFrom there, just go to System Preferences, and create the user accounts from there.  You can tweak the remote administration access to allow these users or add them to a specific group and give that group SSH access from there.\nThis will achieve what you're looking to accomplish.  If the basic commands are the same as what you are familiar with, just enable Remote Administration, SSH to the Mac, and do your thing from the command line.\n", "Q: How can I have dmg files automatically unmount when I trash them? A while ago, I used to have some kind of App or service that would automatically unmount a dmg file whenever I put the dmg file into the trash. This was really convenient, but I've since reinstalled OS X, and I've completely forgotten the name of the app that provides this useful feature. I still have backups of my old system, but I have no idea where to look. So, does anyone know of an app that provides this feature?\n(Note: There are plentiful tutorials on how to achieve the reverse, i.e. auto-trash on eject, but this is not what I'm looking for.)\n\nA: I found two options\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a folder action on ~/.Trash to unmount any DMG getting moved into the trash can (see second part of this article, summarized below)\n\n*DMG Cleaner claims to be able to do this as well\n\n\n\nFolder Action to unmount DMG moved to Trash\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new \"Folder Action\" workflow in Automator\n\n*Set Folder Action to work on ~/.Trash\n\n*Add a \"Run Shell Script\" action to the workflow \n\n*Set shell to \"/usr/bin/python\" and make sure input gets passed as arguments\n\n*Replace the content of the script box with the following script\nimport string, os, sys\nlines = os.popen(\"hdiutil info\").readlines()\nshould_eject = False\nfor line in lines:\n    if line.startswith(\"image-alias\"):\n        path = line.split(\":\")[1]\n        image_path = path.lstrip().rstrip()\n        if image_path in sys.argv:\n            should_eject = True\n    elif line.startswith(\"/dev/\") and should_eject is True:\n        os.popen(\"hdiutil eject %s\" % line.split()[0])\n        should_eject = False\n    elif line.startswith(\"###\"):\n        should_eject = False\n\n\n*Save the workflow\n", "Q: Use backup drive with Snow Leopard I have two Macs, one is running Snow Leopard and can't be updated any further. The other is running El Capitan. I use FileVault on the latter and I also want to backup the latter to a 1TB external hard drive using Time Machine. \nI want the backup to be encrypted. AFAIK that means I will not be able to access the EC backup on the SL machine. That's OK with me. But I still want to use the remaining space on the drive as storage that I can also access on the SL machine. \nIs it possible to have only the backup be encrypted but having the rest of the external drive be compatible with SL? (I.E. unencrypted) \nCan it be achieved by making two partitions, one for encrypted Time Machine backups, and one for other, unencrypted storage? Can the latter partition be exFAT formated?\n\nA: yes, two partitions of the same physical drive would allow you to run in this configuration.  It would be your best option.\nyou can partition and format the storage partition to whatever flavor you'd like (fat or GUID, etc)... The backup partition, however, needs to be HFS+. That is the only format Time Machine will work with.\n", "Q: Screen sharing not working on OS X 10.11 El Capitan I'm running OS X 10.11 El Capitan and Screen Sharing has become more and more tedious. I have a MacBook Air, my usual laptop, and a Mac mini to which I want to connect with Screen Sharing (on my MacBook Air). \nHowever, most of the time I cannot see anything on the Sidebar of the Finder on my MacBook Air. If I manually Go → Connect to Server and enter vnc://myhomemini (which is the server that my Mac mini's Sharing settings suggests I use), I just the popup message:\n\nUnable to resolve “myhomemini”\n  Verify the name you entered and make sure your network connection is working.\n\nNeither computer has a firewall enabled. Both are on the same home network that belongs to me, of course, and both are online without issues individually. On the Mac mini (destination computer, whose screen I want to see on the MacBook Air), the Sharing settings have both Screen Sharing and File Sharing enabled. Nothing else like Remote Management etc is enabled. \nWhat else? Apple's support website is utterly useless. All the advice on the Internet is also speaking of random things from 2012, etc. Welcome any ideas.\n\nA: Sounds like one computer isn't able to reach the other.\nTry using vnc://myhomemini.local\nAdding the .local tells your Mac that it should use bonjour (multicast DNS) to resolve the address.  If everything is on the same network and multicast is allowed (usually the case) this should allow your computers to find each other.  \nAnother possibility is that your network is configured not to allow hosts to talk to each other.  So even though they are on the same network, the router doesn't allow them to talk.  Look at the settings on your router to determine if that is the case or not.\n", "Q: iCloud photo library causing duplicate photos Ever since I started using iCloud photo library I am getting duplicates in photo on iMac OS X El Capitan. Also, all photos that went into the iCloud photo library  uploaded on iPhone too.\nWhat am I doing wrong? I don't want all photos on iPhone and certainly don't need duplicates in photo.\n\nA: iCloud doesn't duplicate the photos, it just stores them in iCloud.\nThe purpose of iCloud Photo Library is to allow you to access your photos on all your devices. If you don't want your photos on your iPhone, don't use iCloud Photo Library.\n", "Q: Photos won't let me edit anything / Same problem on Sierra So (my mom) is trying to edit photos in OS X El Capitan's Photos app and can't seem to do so, all the options are just greyed out.

Most of my computer problems are self-inflicted, so I'd imagine this has to do with some changes I made a few months back that I will detail further down.\nThe computer experiencing issues is a 2012 MacBook Pro 13\" (MacBookPro9,2), running Yosemite 10.10.5.\nHere's what I know:\n\n\n*\n\n*The device connects and shows up as a connected Bluetooth device in System Preferences.\n\n*The device is not recognized as an audio device on my 2012 MacBook Pro (it doesn't show up in the preferences pane).\n\n*The device is able to receive audio from my Android phone.\n\n*The device is able to receive audio from my 2010 MacBook Pro running the same OS version (10.10.5), less a security update and various app updates.\n\n*I had to manually remove Avid ProTools components a few months ago, so likely the issue is with something I edited incorrectly.\n\n*Copying com.apple.audio.SystemSettings.plist from the 2010 model to the 2012 model does not correct the issue.\n\n*Deleting com.apple.audio.SystemSettings.plist from the 2012 model outright does not correct the issue.\n\n*Restarting, etc. does not correct the issue.\n\n\nI suspect that there is some kext file or similar package that needs to be reset or replaced with a good one, but don't know where it would be.\nI do not want to (nor should I have to, in theory) reinstall my system due to a million and a half other reasons.\nI realize that this is an unusual issue, as various search engines with various terms yielded nothing fruitful. Any assistance you can offer is appreciated.\nMacBook Pro (13-inch Mid 2012), OS X Yosemite (10.10.5) \n\nA: Resolution:\nI installed Yosemite on an external drive so that I could find all the system files related to audio (using EasyFind, a great search utility for Mac), compare them to my existing system for any file size mismatches, and then replace the offending file(s).\nThe offending file was found in /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL and was most likely \"BluetoothAudioPlugin.driver\" (duh), though I replaced all the files in this folder with the system defaults, so I don't know that it was solely caused by this one alone.\n", "Q: Safari having trouble accessing my keychain On El Capitan my Safari seems to have trouble remembering my settings for keychain: when the following pops up it stays there if I click \"Allow\" or \"Always Allow\". It goes away when I click \"Deny\" with the obvious consequence that the key is not used and my identification fails.\nIs that a know bug? What can I do to diagnose it in more details or to fix it?\n\n\nA: Always Allow should add the application to the item's 'always allow' list. If it doesn't, you can try adding the application yourself.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the keychain in Keychain Access.\n\n*Find and open the 'Internet password' item for GitHub.\n\n*In the Access Control tab, click the + and add Safari to the list.\n\n", "Q: Autofill password not working on iTunes Connect? Every time I connect on iTunes Connect (OS X 10.10, Chrome) I have to fill in my password, which is very tiring. Chrome autofills all my passwords, why doesn't it work there?

I want to enter multiple tasks at once. A simple import from a text file might work. I tried copy-paste multiple lines but then they were treated all as one task. \nIs there a way to enter multiple tasks in one step?\n\nA: You need to paste the list into the list of tasks, not into the title of a single task.

Searching for contents (phrases) of the message does not seem to work. I want to add \"Finder tags\" to certain messages.\n\nA: I'm tempted to say the easiest way to do a file contents search in what Finder would consider a System location would be EasyFind - freeware, though it's one app I'd happily pay for. [No affiliation]\nYou can drag a folder to define the search domain, then search by Phrase in File Contents. You can either QuickLook the result, or right click & open in Mail or Reveal in Finder\nI picked a fairly innocuous monthly summary from Backblaze as an example…\n\nOne thing to note is that the same mail may appear in more than one location. I really don't know why this is.\n\nA: You can use HoudahSpot to search for mail messages. Full disclosure: HoudahSpot is commercial software that I develop.\nMail.app does a very good job at sharing information with Spotlight. Technically: OS X includes a Spotlight importer that reads .emlx files and provides Spotlight with loads of metadata to index.\nHoudahSpot searches the Spotlight index and can find mail messages by subject, sender, recipients, etc.\nHoudahSpot can also be used to assign Finder tags to files.

It is not duplicated question.\n\nA: Thanks to the development of Bluetooth 4.0 and BLE, it is not possible to airdrop between newer iOS devices and older (pre-retina, I believe) MacBooks. \nThis is because the standards are incompatible, while 'legacy airdrop' is still an option for MacBook-to-MacBook communication, it appears iOS devices do not have this functionality. A more in depth discussion can be found on Apple's forums, and a lengthy discussion on whether an upgrade is possible or should be attempted here. \n", "Q: Wireshark pane couldn't display \nI installed Wireshark Version 2.0.0 on OSX 10.11 with XQuartz 2.7.8\nBut it doesn't display any pane, I don't know what happened...\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: \nI mean when I open the Wireshark, the layout supposed to display three pane(Packet List, Packet Details &Packet Bytes)\n\nIf you double-click on Wireshark, it will not show the three capture file panes, because there's no capture file to show!  That's been the case for several releases now, since before the 2.0 release - the 1.12 release does the same thing.  If you double-click on a capture file, it should open that file and show you the three capture panes.\n\ninstead of the native UI... \n\nThe splash screen (which is what your screenshot shows) and the three-pane list are both part of the UI, whether it's in the 1.12 release (which, on OS X, uses X11) or the 2.0 release (which, on OS X, uses Qt directly atop Quartz with no X11 - this is not a \"native\" vs. X11 issue).\n\nI think when I open this app, it should has different UI...\n\nThat's not what it was written to do - not on OS X, not on Windows, and not on {Linux, Solaris, *BSD, HP-UX, AIX, etc.} with X11 (or Wayland or Mir).  If you open it directly, it shows the splash screen, just like the screen you saw; if you open it by double-clicking on a file, it'll open the file and show you the three panes.\n", "Q: How can I get the window bounds for \"Adobe Illustrator\" in AppleScript? Apparently, Adobe doesn't have a single mechanism in place for people using a laptop and additional monitors with their products. As an Adobe CC user who primarily works from a laptop that connects to a larger monitor at home or school, ALL Adobe CC products open with a pop-up window that is outside of the monitor bounds. So you can't move, or adjust, anything.\nIt effectively locks the product.\nThe only workaround is to disconnect the monitor, wait for everything to shift over to the LapTop window where it makes sure to open everything inside of the monitor bounds. Then reconnect the monitor, and move everything over. Which is a MASSIVE time waster when you're dealing with 8gb of RAM and MASSIVE graphics files.\nI've started learning AppleScript JUST TO FIX THIS RIDICULOUS GLITCH.\nBUT... AppleScript and Illustrator don't work with windows and bounds together.\nCan someone help me with whatever script I would have to write to get (and set) the Adobe Illustrator window bounds?\n\nA: Here's a piece of code that just gets desktop's dimensions and transfers them to another application's first window.\nExchange \"TextEdit\" with Illustrator's process name and build yourself a Service in Automator (open \"New\", choose Service, draw \"Do AppleScript\" to right, insert this code ...).\nGive it a shortcut via [ System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services ] and get going!\nHope this helps ...\ntell application \"Finder\" to set myBounds to bounds of window of desktop\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"TextEdit\"\n    set position of window 1 to {0, 20}\n    set size of window 1 to {item 3 of myBounds, (item 4 of myBounds) - 20}\nend tell\n\n", "Q: Does the \"messages from iphone\" icon only appear in the dock when my messages are opened from my iPhone?

I recently installed VMware Fusion Pro in that and created a new VM and installed Windows 10 64Bit. The problem I'm having is that the resolution is very bad when I use to this Win 10 in my VM. The texts are blurry.\nMy Mac's resolution is 2880*1800 (Intel Iris Pro graphics) and i thought if i change my Windows resolution to the same values, it would fix it. But I can't even see that kind of resolution in my Windows display options.\n\nYou can see the blurriness in the text Identity and Detect. (I tried different resolutions and ended up with the setting 1440*900. I also adjusted the text size to be 125%)\nHow do I fix my resolution issue so that my Windows 10 is also sharp. Is it a problem where Windows 10 is not capable of supporting Retina displays ?\nHere is another screenshot of what I am having. The left side is chrome in my Mac and right side is Chrome in my Windows 10.\n\n\nA: Finally I got this working. The trick was to install VMware Tools in my VM OS (Windows 10). After installing this, I was able to select 2880*1800 resolution. \nMuch better now :) Some apps are still not sharp (Visual Studio menu items etc.). But I can live with those.\n \n\nA: All my virtual machines (with GNOME, KDE, WIN10, etc) seem to be a bit blurry on VMWare Fusion (comparing to non-VM or VMWare Workstation VMs).\nThis is what worked for me (on a 2018 Mac Mini and VMWare Fusion 11):\n\n\n*\n\n*In VMWare Fusion, enable \"Use full resolution for Retina Display\" under Display\n\n*On Mac, open \"System Preferences\", make sure that Resolution is \"Default for display\". (I personally prefer \"Scaled\" display but it looks like it does not play well with VMWare Fusion).\n\n\nA: my solution was to disable the 'Use full resolution for Retina display\"\n\n\n*\n\n*Virtual Machine\n\n*Settings\n\n*Display\n\n*Use full resolution for Retina Display (un-check)\n\n\nA: I already had VMware Tools installed, so when I went to Install, it took me down the \"Change\" path and I didn't have anything to change.\nWhat worked for me was:\n\n\n*\n\n*Repair VMware Tools (Windows restart required afterwards).\n\n*Unchecking \"Use Full Screen Resolution for Retina Display\" (which I had checked before).\n\n\nNow it looks much better, and it fills the entire screen again.\n\nA: Load and start the virtual machine. \nIn the menu bar Click 'Virtual Machine' then 'Install VM Tools' or 'Reinstall VM Tools' click install/repair and restart virtual machine.\nThis should work - took me a couple of hours to find the solution.\n\nA: On my 2017 MBP 15\" I needed to also uninstall VMWare tools from my Win 10 VM and reinstall it. Doing the Repair was insufficient. During the reinstall I checked Complete instead of Typical. Finally got full resolution back in Win 10.\n", "Q: \"Force Sticky Console\": Safari devtools shifts away from Console to DOM inspector on reload When I'm working with the DevTools open, if I refresh the page, DevTools automatically switches to the DOM Inspector tab instead of staying on the console.

I've tried disabling Lastpass and the popup still comes up.\n\n\nA: This is almost definitely caused by a setting in your system preferences:\n\nMaybe you have the new trackpad (or a macbook) in which case this part of the system preferences might look a little different, i know trackpads/laptops with 3d touch probably have some variation in regards to the appearance of the trackpad preferences, but it must be a setting thats analogous to the setting near the top left in the above picture, 'look up & data detectors'. \nTo me this would suggest one of 3 things:\n\n\n*\n\n*You're accidentally clicking the \"shortcut\" you assigned to 'look up' when you're intending to hit the shortcut assigned to 'click'\n\n*Your trackpad is defective/worn-out and thats why its doing this.\n\n*You have 'look up' and 'click' assigned to the same shortcut. (which doesn't seem to be possible on my computer)\n\n*You've been 'clicking' everything using 'look up' (not sure thats possible either).\nAn easy solution to this is to simply disable any \"mouse shortcut\" for 'look up'.

The window only gives me two options, \"Manage\" and \"Upgrade\", either of which opens up System Preferences, which wouldn't be such an issue if my internet connection was faster, but it takes System Preferences way too long to retrieve info about my iCloud Drive and I can't close System Preferences until it does. One cannot hide the window by clicking into another app.\n\nHow can I disable these iCloud Drive messages from appearing (perhaps from a Terminal command)? I am using OS X 10.11 \"El Capitan\", if it makes a difference.\nI'm really looking for something that will just prevent this window from launching, maybe via a Terminal command or deleting/renaming a file, rather than just giving in and buying more storage or freeing some space.\n\nA: As far as I'm aware, these are the only ways to turn off this message:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off iCloud Backup\n\n*Free up some space in iCloud\n\n*Turn on Do Not Disturb\n\n*Pay the money to upgrade\nAll the Google searches and discussions on Reddit, Apple and other websites indicate that there is no other way. However I'm trying to reproduce the issue to see if it can be solved via the command line.\nUntil then, or until someone else comes up with a working procedure, assume the above is the only answer.\n\nA: I had this pop-up too and today I had time to see if I can disable it. It's not a final solution but I can at least kill it now. I hope others can help you (and me) point to a solution where it will never popup again.\nThe underlaying process which pops up this message is: UserNotificationCenter.app which resides in /System/Library/CoreServices/\nYou can kill it in Activity Monitor. But I wanted it 1 step easier so I made a small script.\nCopy paste these lines in a plain text file and make sure to give it the extension *.command\n#! /bin/sh\npkill -9 UserNotificationCenter\nsleep 5\npkill -9 System\\ Preferences\nkillall Terminal\nexit\n\nAfter you did this open Terminal. Copy paste sudo chmod 755, press spacebar and drag your text file in the terminal window. Hit enter, type your password and your done. As soon as this message appears, double click this file and it's gone.\nA little explanation: If you kill UserNotificationCenter it will open the iCloud System Preferences. 'Sleep 5' pauses the script for 5 seconds otherwise it kills Sys Prefs faster than it starts. The script starts Terminal to run it so we quit this too (but you can leave it out if you need Terminal). \nThis temporary solution works for me until we find a way to demolish it for good. \n", "Q: cannot turn off spotlight indexing on external drive I know this question has been asked before, but the solutions suggested are not working for me.\nI just finished attaching a brand new external hard-drive and waiting for 14 hours for Time Machine to finish backing it up.

I am trying to write a script which will select all non-folders in a given Finder window which is in List View and has revealed/expanded all sub-folders (see image).\nAs there tend to be many more files than folders, my thought is to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select all items\n\n*Deselect all folders\n\n\nI am also willing to start with nothing selected and then add non-folders to my selection.\nIn any case, I'm stumped. Any help would be appreciated.\nDesired result would look similar to this:\n\nEDIT: (to answer the xy problem - it's gonna be long, but you asked for it)\nI repair computers for a living, which means I do a lot of \"Backup data, erase hard disk, install OS, restore data\" all the time. Both Windows and Mac, although I do all the backups on my Mac, so the client's data is restored from a Mac volume via the network.\nUsually, I just drag entire folders from backup volume to restored Windows PC and wait for it to finish. Sometimes, though, the copy fails, often because \"the pathname is too long\" or some such nonsense. In such cases, I end up copying smaller chunks at a time until I'm done.\nThen I have to check and double check that I haven't missed any files/folders. So, I open two windows, one with the source folder, the other with the destination folder. And I compare folders (Music, Docs, etc.) from each. I look to see if the number of files/folders match and that the amount of bytes used is the same.\nOften, because of the .DS_Store in Mac folders, the bytes don't match. If I open the folder and Get Summary Info on just the contents, the byte counts match up perfectly.\nSo, rather than open dozens or hundreds of folders and subfolders, one by one, what I do is open the Documents folder, for example, in list view, reveal all subfolders (this much I can do in AppleScript already) and then I Select All and de-select the folders, and then Get Summary Info.\nIn my image above, I could do it manually, of course. But, in many cases, I have folders with hundreds of files and several folders deep. If I do it manually, it takes a long time and inevitably, right before deselecting the last 10 folders, I'll make an errant click and have to start all over.\nThis is why I want a script to select all non-folders.\nIf there is another solution, great. Let me hear it.\n\nA: If all folders are expended in the list view , here are two solutions.\nFirst solution: \nThis AppleScript\nmy deselectAllFolders()\n\non deselectAllFolders()\n    script o\n        property sel : {}\n    end script\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        set o's sel to selection as alias list\n        set tc to count o's sel\n        repeat with i from 1 to tc\n            if class of item (item i of o's sel) is folder then set item i of o's sel to missing value\n        end repeat\n        set selection to aliases of o's sel -- select all items without folders\n    end tell\n    return \"\" -- to not put all files into the result (it's very slow to show an huge list in the editor )\nend deselectAllFolders\n\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*All items must be selected before executing the script. \n\n*Slow on huge list of items.\n\n\n\nSecond solution:\nThis AppleScript\nset pScript to \"from Foundation import NSFileManager, NSURL, NSDirectoryEnumerationSkipsHiddenFiles, NSURLIsDirectoryKey, NSURLIsPackageKey; from ScriptingBridge import SBApplication\ndef procFolder(fold):\n    p = df.contentsOfDirectoryAtURL_includingPropertiesForKeys_options_error_(fold, [NSURLIsDirectoryKey, NSURLIsPackageKey], NSDirectoryEnumerationSkipsHiddenFiles, None)[0]\n    for f in p:\n           r=f.getResourceValue_forKey_error_(None, NSURLIsPackageKey, None)\n           if r[0] and r[1]:\n               allFiles.append(f)\n           else:\n               r=f.getResourceValue_forKey_error_(None, NSURLIsDirectoryKey, None)\n               if r[0] and r[1]:\n                     procFolder(f)\n               else:\n                     allFiles.append(f) \n\nallFiles = []\ndf=NSFileManager.defaultManager() \nfinderApp = SBApplication.applicationWithBundleIdentifier_(\\\"com.apple.finder\\\")\ntPath = finderApp.FinderWindows()[0].target().get()\nprocFolder(NSURL.URLWithString_(tPath.URL()))\nfinderApp.setSelection_(allFiles)\"\n\ndo shell script \"/usr/bin/python -c \" & quoted form of pScript\n\n\n\n*\n\n*No need to select all the items in the list view.\n\n*Fast (1.5 second on 8500 items)\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, Finder doesn't support revealing files in this way.\nThe following code sets 'theFiles' to the files in the directory chosen, but 'reveal' doesn't support any parameters. If you already have the window open, it selects the files in the root of the chosen folder in that window, but then opens a window for every other folder recursively.\ntell application \"Finder\"\n  set theFiles to get every item of (entire contents of folder (choose folder)) whose kind ≠ \"Folder\"\n  reveal theFiles\nend tell\n\nI still feel like this is more of an XY problem though.\n", "Q: Turn Internet Sharing off automatically when on specific network At home I connect my MacBook Pro, running OS X El Capitan, to the Internet using Ethernet, and share the connection with my phone via Wi-Fi.\nAt work I connect the MacBook Pro to the company network using Ethernet, and Internet Sharing is not allowed.\nIs there a way to automatically turn Internet Sharing on and off depending on which network I am on? \nA solution which detects the Ethernet network, somehow, the presence or absence of specific Wi-Fi network, or indeed the actual geographic location would do the job.\nI am aware that I can set the 'Location' via the Apple menu, but can that control the Internet Sharing options, and can detecting the location not be done automatically? Selecting the location manually is too much like hard work.\n\nA: Yes, you can use ControlPlane.  It is designed to do exactly the sort of thing you've mentioned.  \n\nYou'll need to define a context (like \"Home\" or \"Work\" or \"Out & About\") or a few contexts, and then define what clues show what context is active, and then define what actions to take when a context becomes active or ceases to be active.\nIn most cases a context corresponds to a location (or vague type of location, like \"Out & About\").  But you could have a \"Hotspot\" context and a \"Wi-Fi\" context and an \"Ethernet\" context, if that suited your needs better.  Or you could have \"Metered\" and \"Unmetered\" contexts.\nYou can also enable multiple simultaneous contexts, but that gets complicated and confusing, and I don't recommend it at first.\nYou can use presence of networks, geographical location, and perhaps dozens of other things to determine your location/context.  It's quite powerful (but after a while you'll notice things missing, like the ability to directly trigger an action from an evidence source, without the need to use a context as an intermediary).  I heartily recommend it, even though you may eventually wish it did a lot more than it does.\n", "Q: App Rejected 3 Times, clueless how to fix issue so an App of mine has been rejected 3 times.  Each being the same reason:\nGuideline 2.2: Apps that exhibit bugs will be rejected\nMore specifically the App Reviewer(s) cannot log into the Application Server, which is needed to proceed.\nThe problem here is that I can not for the life of me figure out why they can't login.  The App has been tested thoroughly around the World from various testers, in the States (N.Y and California) as well as in India and Australia.\nEveryone can login but the Apple Review team just can't.  I asked them to test on actual physical devices for the last submission since I believe they are using their own test suite when reviewing Apps.  Not sure if they did though.\nHow should I proceed with this?  I'm out of ideas.\n\nA: If Apple reject your app due to a technical problem, they usually provide a screenshot. Check the bottom of the message in iTunes Connect to see if there is an attachment.\nYou could try some severe logging: in the app, log exactly what is happening, all the inputs, all the errors, and have it report to your server. Thus, after they reject the app, you can go through the logs and see what is happening.\n", "Q: Putting imported tacks into an album I just imported music from some CD's I had, and iTunes put each track into a single album.

The machine is a few days old. Whenever I try to run a sudo command, I'm asked for my password and told\naccountUsername is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.\n\nHowever, all the instructions I can find for adding a user to the sudoers file require having at least one user that has sudo privileges. I've tried \nsudo visudo and sudo adduser username sudo - but obviously both of those require the user to be a sudo user.\nI'm not sure how I ended up in sudo purgatory. The only thing I can think of is - my employer created two additional admin accounts and then removed admin rights from my original account.\nAll accounts have since been upgraded to have admin privileges and the problem still persists.\n\nA: It sounds like your employer has disabled using sudo commands from any admin account, instead opting to include only specific users. This would mean only the employer's admin account would be able to use sudo. If you no longer have access to this account, you could boot into Single User Mode and run the visudo command to fix it. If they didn't remove the user from the sudoers list, you could also make a new admin account with the same shortname. \n\nA: If that's possible, Recovery mode has a root terminal as one of the utilities. You can visudo from there, and add:\naccountUsername    ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\nUpon restarting, the user you listed will now be able to use sudo once again,\n\nA: This situation was caused by opening the sudoers file in Sublime Text - which somehow resulted in a malformed sudoers file. So first of all, don't do that. I have since learned that you should only open the sudoers file with sudo visudo. \nI replaced the file using visudo with a default sudoers file for my OS and version that I found online.\nHowever, to do that you will need to log into single user mode (as per Austin or TheBro21's answers) or you could also enable root user temporarily while you fix this.\n", "Q: How to use f11 on a Mac I'm playing a game called fishing planet and I need to use f11 to change the pitch but it's the volume so I can't use it \n\nA: Hit the Fn key at the bottom left along with F11. Alternatively, in System Preferences, you can set the F keys to be used as F keys and not as volume etc., so then you won't need to press the Fn key every time.\n\nA: On macOS 11 Big Sur you can find the option under:\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Mission Control\nThen disable the F11 shortcut.\n\nA: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Mission Controls => Locate \"F11\" and uncheck it for Show Desktop (or whatever it's set as)\n\nA: I find this definition to be helpful towards the question:\n\nThe F11 function key will quickly slide up all your windows, revealing\n  your desktop, and letting you interact with your files and folders. By\n  default on MacBook / Pro / Air, and on the small keyboard for iMac,\n  the F11 key is mapped to special functionality, like decreasing the\n  volume. All you need to do is hold down the \"fn\" function key (bottom\n  left corner of your keyboard) while pressing the F11 key to trigger\n  the show-desktop command.\nsource: http://in5stepstutorials.com/mac-os-x/quickly-show-desktop-in-mac-os-x-gesture-hotkey.php\n\n\nA: The function keys on a mac have certain functions like volume, Expose, etc. Instead, you need the Fn key to press. so Fn+F11. On a windows on the other hand, you would use the function key for the F keys functions.\nYou can do such thing on a mac too in System Preferences > Keyboard > Use F1, F2, etc. as standard function keys.\nDoing the above will make F11 keys function like on windows. If you need to adjust volume, etc. with this option checked, you use the Fn key for that.\n", "Q: Disfunctioning songs on Apple music Some songs in apple music can't be played. It is very weird cause in the start I could listen to these songs, and then suddenly they became unable to play. They just turned grey and it isn't possible to play them. It is very frustrating and I know that it hasn't something to do with my internet connection. It is like this at both my macbook and my iPhone. Have anyone else experienced this? And does anyone know if there is a way of fixing it?\n\nA: Sometimes songs are removed from Apple Music at the request of the artist/ publisher. \nIf you do Get Info on a track you have a problem with, go to the File tab and see what it says for iCloud Status.\nIf it says No Longer Available then it is as I have described above and is shown in the screenshot I have attached.\n\n", "Q: Clear \"Disk2\" \"OS X Base System\" before USB boot OS X install Machine is MBP E-2011 500GB hybrid hard drive.

The one you most likely ran into was the full-screen-zoom, and you're correct, it's not what you're looking for. The other one is per-application zoom. The short answer is that an application must support using scroll to zoom, there is no system setting for this.

The edges of the case then reflect light from the flash onto the camera sensor, resulting in a lot of glare during flash photography and video recording.\nThe only solution is to not use that case while using your camera’s flash. It would be best to simply switch to a different case with a wider/better-designed rear camera opening.\n\nA: There is no way to not make the flash so bright on your iPhone, but you could use a third-party camera app on the App Store, like Camera+, to control exposure and other settings.\n", "Q: Iphone 6 plus keyboard letters uppercase I bought my Iphone 6 plus yesterday, and i was wondering is it genuine because keyboard letters when typing messages and emails are all uppercase no matter caps lock.

It has\n\n\n*\n\n*10.6 (the minimum required OS),\n\n*2.5 GB RAM (~2.5 times the required memory), and\n\n*a 2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo.\n\n\nHowever, the Sling TV web site claims you need a \"2 GHz Intel Core Duo\".  I wasn't aware that there was such a thing, but Googling for the difference between them turned up nothing apparently useful, and even Googling for \"2 GHz Intel Core Duo\" turned up very little—most results refer to the 2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo.  HOWEVER there is a page from Intel which mentions \"2 GHz Intel Core Duo\".  Is this a different CPU, or just another way of referring to the 2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo?\nIf they are different CPUs, can I assume the Core 2 came later, and therefore I have a newer CPU than Sling requires?\n\nA: Yes, the Core 2 Duo and Core Duo are different and the Core 2 Duo came later so your iMac should support any software that requires at least a Core Duo.\nYou can tell because the Early 2006 MacBook Pro used the Core Duo while every MacBook Pro after that until 2010 used a Core 2 Duo. This isn't definitive in proving that the Core 2 came after the Core, but Apple's not going to continually downgrade the processor in its top-of-the-line laptop year after year, plus the \"2\" usually denotes a successor anyway.\n\nA: They are different processors.    \nThe Core Duo was released earlier in 2006.\nThe Core 2 Duo was released mid 2006.   \nFor specific dates, and more info on the processors, this Wiki page is a good reference:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core#Core_Duo\n", "Q: 'soft return' in iTerm2 I'm just wondering is there a way to enter a new line in iTerm 2 without executing the line being typed? \nI am looking to make use of some relatively long commands to automate some things, but not being able to format things is proving to make long commands hard to read. \nIs there any way to enter line breaks or soft returns so that when enter is pressed the whole command will still execute?\n\nA: Not sure if I understand correctly. If you put \\ at the end and press enter, it is treated as continuation of the line and control goes to next line for you to type more. Only when you press enter on a line that doesn't end in \\ is when the entire piece of code gets executed on the shell. So in a way \\ could be you soft return.\n", "Q: Why were my notes deleted when I permanently deleted emails on gmail site Why were my notes deleted when I permanently deleted my emails from gmail account.  Can I get my notes recovered? My notes on Apple phone were lynced to Mac I am told.? Can you help \n\nA: If you were syncing your Notes via your Gmail account (and not via iCloud) then Gmail treats them like a plain text email. If you delete your email, then you also deleted the notes.\nRestoring from backup is your only bet - either a Time Machine backup or by recovering lost email.\n", "Q: What formats does Quick Look for iOS support for presenting 3D information?

Notice the following observations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Playing mp4 movies in both QuickTime, VLC and in webpages in Safari works fine for some time, but after a while starts lagging.\n\n*The machine gets extremely hot, at most CPU temperature 101 degrees according to my temperature utility. The iMac (and previous Minis) never got anywhere near as hot.\n\n*Indicated CPU usage in Activity Monitor seems to increase proportionately with CPU temperature (and how long the machine has been on), but this is somewhat unsure.\n\n*The process VTDecoderXPCService sometimes takes several hundred percent while playing video. But sometimes it takes nothing at all.\n\n*Encoding PAL videos to mp4 with ffmpeg goes extremely slow (around 1 second of footage per second, while for comparison my MacBook Air 2014 manages 5 seconds per second)\n\n\nApple said \"80% of the times doing a full format and reinstall solves problems like this\". The guy who sold me the thing said he already reinstalled it, but he may not have done a full format first.\nBefore I go through the trouble of formatting and reinstalling, does anyone have experiences and tips to share of similar situations?\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the Mini actually designed for and supposed to get so warm (100 degrees celsius)?\n\n*Is the problem simply due to the CPU being a i5? Are i5's ridiculously much slower than i7's?\n\n*Is a full and reinstall likely to fix the problem?\n\n*Are there other causes and solutions I should fix? (Save hardware problems and repairs)\n\n\nNotice that VLC is set to use hardware acceleration and QuickTime runs accelerated by default as far as I know, so the problem is probably not related to this.\n\nA: The Core i5 processor will throttle it's speed if it gets over what Intel refers to as the 'TJ Max' which is somewhere around 90C. If your software is telling you that you're hitting 100C, then you've obviously got a cooling issue.\nUnless you suspect the previous owner tried replacing the CPU or heatsink (unlikely), it might just be that the vents are clogged or the fan is clogged or not working. Fortunately, this should be easy to get to the fan as per the iFixit guide here. You can probably confirm the fan performance by putting your hand over the vent in the back when it is running hot and see if it is blowing a lot of hot air on you; I imagine you'd barely feel anything when you should feel something relatively significant (think: it should blow/flap a piece of paper you hold over it like if you used your mouth to blow air onto it).\nBefore buying a new fan, you could try seeing if the fan spins easily with your finger (and keeps rotating for a short moment). What I've found in the past is that these little fans can get dust either built up on the fins (easy to clean) or the bearing and/or rotation points could have dust buildup that is causing the fan to be difficult to rotate. What you need to do is clean out the dust (perhaps with some tweezers) and see if you can make it spin with more ease again. Further that, if you are comfortable enough with somewhat disassembling the fan and could get some oil into the fan's bearing, that might make it as good as new. Typical good oil for this is along the lines of \"sewing machine oil\" or perhaps if you have a RC Car shop nearby, they have nice oils with needle applicators that works great. Reinstall fan and things should be good.\nAs far as the performance degredations you're seeing and the higher CPU usage, that is certainly inline with the throttled i5 speed; if the chip is running slower, it isn't getting tasks done as fast which means these tasks are taking more of the CPU time (if you look at it as a measurement of time, not capacity).\nHope this works for you!\n\nA: My Mac mini Mid 2010 was overheating and rebooting even after cleaning and switching off Spotlight.\nmds and mds_stores constantly consuming cpu \nApril 2018 turned off indexing PC getting too hot - crashing\nsudo mdutil -a -I off\nsudo mdutil -a -I on\nThen I examined the fan and found there was no air intake so I drilled 18 mm × 6 mm holes in the plastic cover on the bottom in front of the unit opposite the fan.\nIt's cool now.\n\nA: The culprit simply turned out to be a loose fan cable. The CPU got to over a hundred degrees and throttled performance by design to avoid hardware damage. Fastening the fan cable enabled the fan and got the machine back to normal. Hope this will help others experiencing similar problems.\n", "Q: Sharing photos.app library across multiple machines I have three machines: A Mac Pro, a Macbook Pro and a Macbook Air. I created the library on my MBP and all photos are stored on the file server on my network which all machines can access.\nCopying the library to my MBA and MP, I can see the thumbnails as you'd expect but it refuses to load any files whatsoever, despite the volume being mounted at the same path.\nHas anyone had any success in getting this to work?\nI had a look at the database and each file has a hex encoded string stored against it which is storing system disks UUID amongst other machine specific things regardless of the fact that it's on the network share.\n\nA: According to this Apple Support Document:\n\nImportant: If two or more users attempt to use the same iPhoto library\n  and the library is not on a volume where permissions are ignored,\n  unexpected results may occur. This includes the inability to see or\n  edit certain photos, or the inability to open the iPhoto library.\n  Follow the steps below to ensure each user has read/write access to\n  the iPhoto Library.\n\nEssentially, a single Library must reside on a volume where permissions are ignored. A NAS or a shared internal/external non-System HD attached to your Mac Pro be a good start. You will not be able to share the Library from the internal boot drive as it cannot be set to ignore permissions.\n", "Q: Peculiar behaviour with Mac OS X Application on El Capitan I have an installation made with Packages (v1.1.3), and my (codesigned) application installs fine.\nAnd I can run it ONCE. Second time, the application won't open. It is as if OS X thinks the application still is running, because if I start the application from terminal open -n /Applications/MyApplication.app it DOES open. But not without the -n option. And there is no instance of it running, either shown in Activity Monitor, or with ps -A.\nDoing open /Applications/MyApplication.app in Terminal, the open command will just \"hang\" indefinitely. No log entries in Console, nor any on stdout that could shed light on this.\nStarting the executable directly in a terminal: /Applications/MyApplication.app/Contents/MacOS/MyApplication works just fine though (!)\nAnd one more thing: If I rename the app to say, \"MyApplication2.app\", it ALSO opens up correctly. But not if I change it back.\nWhen in this condition (which is fully reproducable by uninstalling the package, then reinstall it), if I logout, then log back in, the application will open normally.\nFurthermore: The application works fine on a freshly installed El Capitan (and on Yosemite), the problem has thus far arisen on machines that have upgraded from Yosemite to El Capitan.\nI really have no idea where to look for the solution for this one...\nEdit 1: Actually, this is reproduced each time I reboot the Mac. But if I then logout/login, it starts working.

I am thinking of switching to just storing all my documents on my iCloud drive. \nWith Backblaze, you can set an encryption key. Without this key no one can access your data - not even Backblaze. \nI know by default, iCloud does not do this. But is there a 'set-it-and-forget-it` workaround to have files encrypted before they are uploaded? \nI don't have anything sensitive in my files. But after all the stories one hears in the media, I would be reluctant to put my files in a place where a rogue Apple employee (or contractor) can just open them up. \n\nA: If you want set-it-forget-it like BackBlaze, then iCloud is not for you. Your data is safe from a rogue Apple employee, but not safe from a government agency or someone with a legal ability to extract it. When Apple can help you regain access to your iCloud files if you forget your password then they can help a government agency to do that too.\nBut if you create your own password-encrypted disk image (.sparsebundle file using Disk Utility and encryption in the Finder) then the password is known only to you, and is only stored in RAM on your machine while your disk image is open and mounted; it is destroyed when you unmount and close the encrypted disk image. You can keep copies of that encrypted disk image on your machine or in a cloud service.\nIf you never store that password in the Keychain iCloud or localitems keychain files, then it will never be uploaded to iCloud. If you store that password in a local-only Keychain file then it is secure but would not necessarily be proof against seizure of your hardware or a malicious remote control.\nRegardless of how well you protect the password to your encrypted disk image, you might be forced to decrypt it whilst under arrest. If you 'forget' it, then that may be used against you in court. If you truly forget it, then your data is completely deleted and unrecoverable.\n\nA: iCloud seemingly already does this by default\n\niCloud secures your data by encrypting it when it's sent over the Internet, storing it in an encrypted format when kept on server (review the table below for detail), and using secure tokens for authentication. This means that your data is protected from unauthorized access both while it is being transmitted to your devices and when it is stored in the cloud. iCloud uses a minimum of 128-bit AES encryption—the same level of security employed by major financial institutions—and never provides encryption keys to any third parties.\nWhen you access iCloud services using Apple’s built-in apps (for example, Mail, Contacts, and Calendar apps on iOS or OS X), authentication is handled using a secure token. Using secure tokens eliminates the need to store your iCloud password on devices and computers. Even if you choose to use a third-party application to access your iCloud data, your username and password are sent over an encrypted SSL connection.\n\nAnd regarding the privacy:\n\nApple has a company-wide commitment to your privacy.

There is this issue on OSX that often when you put a font file into the trash, it can't be emptied as the system thinks the font is still in use:\n\nHowever, I've uninstalled it using Font Book, I've quit any application that might still be holding on to the font, including the Finder, but it's still reported as being in use. The only thing that helps is completely logging out and back in again, but that's not right. There has to be a better way. Has anyone figured this out?\n(I know this isn't exactly a serious problem but it's nagging me.)\n\nA: You could force remove it using Terminal, if it really bothers you. \nExample:\nrm /Users/akiekintveld/.Trash/font.ttf\nWould remove a file named \"font.ttf\" from your trash. \n\nA: Ok, I did some more research and I think that this is actually a long-standing bug in the system. I’ll post this to whoever else is bothered by this. Using the following Terminal command, you can see what processes are still holding on to the font file (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8317177/see-what-process-is-using-a-file-in-mac-os-x):\nlsof|grep <name of the font file>\n\n(It’s the first column of the data that gets printed.) And then you can restart the process (app) in question and see if you can delete the file now. In my case, it looks like it was the Finder, but I restarted that one and I still couldn’t empty the trash. Next time it happens, I’ll dig deeper (I’ve already deleted the file now).\nIn case you just want to get rid of the file and don’t care what’s causing the problem (like I do), you can delete the font file directly from the Trash, again using the Terminal, as Austin Kiekintveld suggested:\nrm ~/.Trash/<name of the font file>\n\n(When using the Terminal, leave out the <>, they are just to mark that it’s a placeholder)\n", "Q: SFTP - how to tunnel to private AWS server behind AWS NAT I need to SFTP connect to a AWS server behind a NAT server in a private subnet.

I was just trying to put some new music on my iPhone 4 (just temp phone until Christmas), I have had it for around 5 months, after losing my old iPhone 4s 6 months ago. I thought the backup was for music so I tried backing it up, clicked the wrong one and it backed up my OLDER iPhone 3GS from almost 2 years ago. So now everything I have had for the last 5 months is gone, since I have never plugged this one into iTunes before or backed it up is there any way of getting it back?\n\nA: So, I don't think this is necessarily as simple as the current answers make it out to be.    \nTechnically no, if you don't have a recent backup, you can't restore your phone to it's most recent state.\nHowever...  a backup (in its simplest form) is just: \n- a list of apps you have installed, and where you have them on your screen\n- your email / iOS settings\n- any data stored in the apps\n- photos (unless you have iCloud photo enabled, then photos are not part of the standard backup)\nSo, given the above...   music is not part of a backup.   Any music you've purchased through iTunes is already part of your account.   You just need to download it again (it's already paid for).   Any apps you've downloaded can be downloaded again as well...   they are already purchased.   If you aren't using iCloud photos, you might lose some recent pictures taken...  but that's going to be about it.    \nAlmost everything done on an iPhone is easily recoverable without a \"backup\".   The backup just makes things easier.    \n\nA: Like Tetsujin said, no, sorry. Only if you have another backup or if it was set to backup to iCloud.\nTiferrei\n", "Q: Apple watch showing old notifications On my apple watch I receive a imessage, I twist my wrist to show the message but for it always shows me the old messages and then the new imessage? How can I stop this so it either just shows me the new message or the actual up to date thread?\n\nA: Sometimes, you may not know that the configurations of your Apple Watch push notification system is different from your iPhone. The phone may receive the latest messages while the watch is lagging or doesn't receive any at all. This post might help you out.\n\nA: This is a watchOS 2 Bug\nThe issue as described is basically that old, previously read/dismissed messages in a conversation continue to show up when new messages arrive (zombie messages) long after they were initially received and were marked as read.\nThe fix described here is to delete the offending conversation on Apple Watch. Once this has been done, notifications for conversations with that contact will begin to function normally.\nDoing this will not delete the conversation from any other device so you don't have to worry about losing your conversation, so even though it seems destructive, this is a non-destructive fix in that sense. \nNote: the next time a notification for that same contact is received by the watch, the deleted conversation will be restored and viewable from the watch. Prior to that the conversation will not be present within the watch's Messages app's conversations list.\n", "Q: Keyboard / Trackpad not working in Mac OS, but works on boot screen and in Windows Have an issue with Macbook Air 13 (Mid 2013). Both trackpad and keyboard work fine on the boot screen, also in Windows 10 bootcamp installation, but in Mac OS X neither works (not even Caps Lock LED). External keyboards and mouses work fine.\nTried clean re-install wiping all existing partitions (Yosemite and El. Capitan) - no difference. Actually, even during Mac OS installation, input works fine on the boot screen, but as soon as Mac OS setup loads, both keyboard and trackpad stop working.\nSMC and PRAM resets didn’t help.\nEDIT - Some additional info gathered during troubleshooting: (Thanks Tiago Ferreira)\n\n\n*\n\n*Internal keyboard and trackpad work fine in Diagnostics Mode.\n\n*The only warning on Diagnostics page is that battery needs servicing. \n\n*Keyboard and trackpad do not work in Safe and Single User modes.\n\n*When booting into Single User mode, there are bunch of errors related to AppleHSSPIController\n\n*Disabling Bluetooth doesn't help.

You'll need to take it to your local Apple Store for the genius to do it. If it is indeed an hardware problem, Apple Stores have access to a more detailed system diagnosis, which will almost certainly tell you what the problem is if it isn't firmware. \nSorry for the long time and hope you can solve it.\nTiferrei\n", "Q: \"iTunes will erase and restore your iPad to iOS 8.4.1 and will verify the restore with Apple.\" What doest verify the restore with Apple mean for me? What will be the effect when I perform such update?\nWhat I am going to do?\nDowngrade iPad to iOS 8.4.1. So far I downloaded .ipsw file, and then with alt + cmd I clicked Restore iPad... in iTunes Connect. What is gonna happen now?\n\nA: In this discussion from 2010 on apple.com it says this: \n\"I can't speak for Apple programmers. If you still have the 3.1.3 ipsw file on your computer it will reuse it and not download it again, but it will still go back to Apple's server to verify the copy that you have, presumably to verify that it has not been hacked.\"\nIf you google \"verify the restore with apple\" you will see it mentioned in a lot of jail breaking related posts. To me this suggests its somehow meant to prevent jail breaking. And perhaps thats what the post in the apple discussion meant by 'hacked'.\nTo me it also sort of sounds like something intended to prevent people from using stolen apple stuff. \nEdit: in addition to what i said in the comments, and to give you an answer with some more finality: Backing up to firmware that you got from a third party may work fine. But theres no reason to believe that it will, other than your own personal perception of the place where you got it from. \n\nA: When iTunes says that it means that it is checking with the Apple servers if:\n\n\n*\n\n*The ipsw is valid (if it wasn't modified).\n\n*If it is still signed by Apple (this prevents users from downgrading to less secure versions)\n\n\niOS 8.4.1 is no longer signed, meaning that there is no way to downgrade, the only signed iOS versions for now are iOS 9.1 and iOS 9.2 if you're in the beta program.\nIf you want to check this in the future, ipsw.me has a pretty good database on signed firmware versions for specific devices.\n", "Q: How do I set what \"maximize\"means for a window? For some applications (eg terminal) when I double-click the title bar, it expands to fill the screen (height and width). For some (eg chrome) it expands down to fill the height, but doesn't change width. For still others, (eg emacs) it cycles between height, full screen, and original size. \nHow do I change this? I would LIKE to have control over each app, but turning everything into the 3 step cycle would be ok too. \nI'm in el Capitan, in case that matters. \nThanks.\n\nA: the maximise feature on OS X is set to in some apps like Terminal (because it's content is purely text and can easily by formatted) to fit your whole screen, on other apps like Safari or Chrome, because they are browsers they tend to contain images (and other hidden HTML or CSS contents) which would make it by default to arrange the window so that it displays all the content correctly but also to allow you to work at the same time with other windows, that's why it will try not to use all the width (people tend to use 2 windows sideways not upways) but remember that (at least Safari) tends to remember the height and width that you manually chose.\nOn the 3 step cycle I think there is no way to do that, sorry, what I usually do is usually set browsers to use all the space available, if I need to use another app, either enter fullscreen mode with Safari and you can easily change from desktop to fullscreen apps with (control) + (left or right arrow). If you really want to do something like comparisons and really need to have both windows opened at the same time us El Capitan's split screen feature, set Safari (or others) to fullscreen and then access expose and drag your other windows to Safari.\nHope this helps,\nTiferrei\n\nA: Window maximisation is controlled by the third (rightmost) button in the top left of the window (the green button in older versions of the OS). The double-click feature is a shortcut; the third button gives you more, but not complete control.\n\nIts default behaviour is to send the window to full screen. You can get your menu bar back by sending your mouse to the top edge.\nYou can access secondary behaviour by holding down the option key before you click it. The fullscreen double-arrow icon changes to a +. The behaviour in this case is what used to be called 'zoom'. Window zoom is specifically coded into each app. For example, Terminal zooms to the height and width of the screen, leaving the menu bar intact and not extending past the Dock. Safari has a minimum zoomed window width: if your window started out narrower than the zoom width, it expands. If it started out wider than the zoom width, it doesn't change width. Safari makes the height of the window take up all the spare screen space not including the Dock and the menu bar. Older software won't even know about the fullscreen capability and may just have the + behaviour.\nTLDR; you can't change it because it's in the compiled program code, not something configurable like a plist file. You can choose between full screen and 'zoom' maximise.\n", "Q: app updates locked on iphone 6 My iphone 6 has 7 apps that need to update.

I have always used bash for work, and never had problems with it.

DarkWake is assumed to be an internal name for PowerNap, and is referenced on a Patent. \nFor more, please visit the article on Xlab:\nhttp://www.thexlab.com/faqs/mavericks_post_install.html#Delay_before_sleep\n\nA: I've seen this question come up all over the web with no fix, so will post my solution here.\nThe issue is that the mac is running a newer OS than it was designed for, and thus doesn't play well with the Power Nap feature available in Mavericks and newer OS X. Non-retina macs lack the hardware to use Power Nap, but power nap isn't completely disabled as it should be on a non-retina mac.\nThe Power Nap feature is still operating to some extent (though logically it should not be on this older hardware). So when your mac tries to sleep, Power Nap hangs because it doesn't know what to do with your old hardware, so the system waits until the whole process times out after 15 seconds.\nTo disable Power Nap (or darkwake as it's called in the system internals) you'll need to simply toggle it off. But because the file you need to edit is in the System folder, you'll have to disable system-wide security first, make the edit, then re-enable security.\n\n\n*\n\n*1) Reboot into recovery mode\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off the computer.\n\n*Hold the Command+R (⌘+R) keys.\n\n*Press and release the power button.\n\n*Release the Command+R keys once you see the Apple logo.\n\n\n*2) Disable System Security\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Terminal (in Utilities Menu > Terminal).\n\n*Type csrutil disable.\n\n\n*3) Reboot like normal\n\n*4) Get a plist file editor if you don't have one (I used Pref Setter)\n\n*5) Open the following plist file using your editor\n\n\n*\n\n*/System/Library/CoreServices/powerd.bundle/com.apple.powerd.plist\n\n*You may need to press Command+UP (⌘+↑) in the file chooser dialog a few times to get up to where /System lives.\n\n\n*6) Make the plist modification\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the row with KeepAlive and change its True value to False\n\n*Save and close\n\n\n*7) Reboot into Recovery like before\n\n*8) Enable System Security\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Terminal (in Utilities Menu > Terminal).\n\n*Type csrutil enable\n\n\n*9) Reboot like normal\n\n\nNow after activating sleep a few more times, it should be noticeably faster than before.

How does that make sense? \n\nA: My 16GB iPhone 5s reports 12.2GB capacity on iOS 9. It's normal to only have 5.3GB of capacity for an 8GB device. First, this is because iOS takes up quite a bit of room (and steals a little extra, too, just in case). Second, when calculating storage, 1GB is equal to 230 (1,073,741,824) bytes, but Apple sells you the iPhone with 1GB defined as only 109 (1,000,000,000) bytes (this is usually noted on the side of the iPhone box).\n", "Q: Is there a way to lock the volume & brightness on iPad/iOS 10 from getting changed by a child?

I have 2 macbook pro A and B. I want to transfer A to B to make them identical. I have done something similar before by creating a disk image and then retoring a new hd from the same disk image.

Am I supposed to boot in recovery mode before?\n\nA: Yes - booting to Recovery HD is the best option. Then you can do the bit for bit copy. I'm liking to do installs and then run Migration Assistant (over the network if needed or) by connecting over target disk mode to migrate from the old Mac to the clean new OS during the initial setup.\nThe procedure for that is to boot the new Mac to Recovery HD and to erase it completely if it already ran the setup assistant and created an initial user.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904\nThe reasons I like migration is:\n\n\n*\n\n*You know the new OS is clean/pristine\n\n*It's faster - sometimes far faster\n\n*System unique files are actually unique so that the two \"clones\" aren't too close a match for some oddball edge cases and Time Machine backup cases.\n\n\nA: I recommend Carbon Copy Cloner.

Recently I noticed that entire albums were missing off my phone, or weirder still, that some albums would have two or three tracks present and the rest missing.\nAfter checking that I did not have “Only Offline Music” selected, I did the obvious: I logged out of my Apple ID account and logged back in. A lot more music disappeared. Now roughly 90% of my music is missing.\nSome artists are entirely present, some have taken huge hits, and a lot have exactly one song each.\nI have also deauthorized my main computer (which has all my music) and reauthorized it in the hopes that would force a resync, but no such luck.\nI should also mention that I never signed up for Apple Music, not even the free trial. I know there were some problems there, but that’s not the cause of my woes.\nSo what is going on here?\n\nA: Finally figured it out: in the Settings app, under Music, “iCloud Music Library” was somehow disabled.

Thus far, I am noticing that:\n\n\n*\n\n*I can no longer use Messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n*I cannot use FaceTime.\n\n\n\n\n\n*I cannot authenticate into iCloud via the Preference Pane.\n\n\n\nI have verified my iCloud credentials elsewhere (on another Mac, on iCloud.com, on an iOS device).\nDoes anyone know how I can force iCloud to recognize my credentials on this machine?\nEDIT: In response to the myriad suggestions by Tetsujin, I have catalogued them here:\n\n\n*\n\n*NVRAM reset has been done.\n\n*Started up MacBook in Safe Mode.\n\n*CANNOT use Messages from Safe Mode.\n\n*Checked status of service (UP).\n\n*Signed out of Messages and Facetime on all devices and back in.\n\n*Restarted routers and incoming internet.\n\n*Tried alternate ISP.\n\n*Verified SN displays, and is valid.\n\n*Disabled all firewalls.\n\n*Checked veracity of /private/etc/hosts file.\n\n*Verified that no proxy was being used.\n\n*Deleted Keychain entries for imessage and com.apple.idms.\n\n*Verified that the Guest account CAN access Messages.\n\n*Deleted com.apple.apsd.plist and rebooted.\n\n*Reset SMC.\n\n*Reinstalled OS X 10.11.2.\n\n\nNone of these things has worked for me.\nEDIT 2: I am also having issues running apps purchased via the AppStore. Each time I run one, I have to log into the AppStore to verify the purchase.\nEDIT 3: I've done myriad changes including deletes of Caches, StartupItems, Libraries, etc. (in concert with AppleCare Support), and nothing has remediated the issue so far. I'll document everything as time permits.\nEDIT 4: The issue is more than just with iCloud, but also involves certain apps that require access to some subfolders in ~/Library. For example, when I try to update EFI's Fiery Software, I get this:\n\nAnd when I execute OmniFocus, I see this response:\n\nAnd some apps that use the Sparkle framework to perform updates simply fail. iSale 5 is one example:\n\nSome apps work fine, while others obviously do not. There is a major permissions issue here somewhere. I just haven't been able to track it down.\n\nA: It seems that I have found the answer to this issue. I ran the ACL permissions repair tool at the Terminal in Recovery Mode, but when I checked the ~/Library and its subfolders from the CLI, I found that many of the subfolders were owned by another user account. (How this happened is anyone's guess.) The solution here was to Get Info for the ~/Library folder, and then ensured that I had RW access to it. Then, I simply chose to Apply to Enclosed Items...\n\n\nA: Try restarting your Mac. If that doesn't solve your problem, go to the iCloud pane in System Preferences and try signing out and then back in.\n\nA: Dave...I had the same problem and here is what worked for me. I updated from 10.11.1 to 10.11.2 (Vanilla install with Clover). Use iMessage_Debug 2 to get the proper info in conjunction with steps in the screenshot. iMessage_Debug 2: http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/files/file/278-imessage-debug/\n\nA: I had the same issue with iCloud, but also had wifi troubles when connecting to a WPA2-Enterprise network. The only way for me to fix is was doing a Clean install from an external disk. Using the recovery mode to erease the disk and reinstall os x did not work.\nIf you want to reinstall your mac, make a backup first, but do not put the while backup back because the problem then reoccurred (in my case).\nIf you do not have a external disk with os x, you could go to an apple store or apple certified service center.\n\nA: Just solved the identical symptoms - thought it was el Capitan because the service stopped working the same day I ran the 10.11.3 upgrade, but in fact LittleSnitch was blocking identityservicesd from contacting IMRemoteURLConnectionAgent. As soon as I deleted the rule all was happy.\nI would assume that any firewall could be doing the same thing. I was alerted to the issue when I followed instructions elsewhere to create a new iCloud account and create a new Admin User on the iMac using that account to log in, and it wouldn't connect.\n", "Q: iPhone 4 Battery Problem I am having a problem with the battery in my Mom's old iPhone 4.\nShe recently had to replace her phone because it was showing this screen:\n\nThat isn't her phone, but that is what it was showing. When we unplugged it, the phone completely died so we left it to charge for a while.\nIt then showed the connect to iTunes screen:\n\n(Also not her phone)\nI went to unplug it and plug it into my computer, but it instantly turned off. I plugged it into the computer and when it started, it showed the same screen. iTunes found it and said that I needed to update or restore the phone. I tried, but I got error 21 (some online researched said that this meant the OS couldn't boot because it had a bad battery). I ordered a new battery online and attempted to replace the battery myself. I had no problem and when I was done and plugged it in to the computer, it showed the same screen. I should also mention that there was never (from the start!) a screen that indicated that the battery was dead.\nAt this point I was pretty upset because my mom had years and years of photos that were never backed up.\nAny help would be very much appreciated.\nEDIT: My questions are A) Why would the iPhone allegedly not detect the battery B) are there any fixes that would not require me to take the device in (not on warranty anymore) and C) If it isn't the battery (because I have replaced it), what could be causing this?\n\nA: That's not a battery problem unless it powers off while you are trying to connect it to a computer / powered USB hub to try and pack up the photos.\nTaking it to Apple for service won't get the data back as they erase the device if it gets swapped. If the battery indicator is not showing, it could be a bad battery (even some new parts are DOA), the connectors failing or the control circuitry on the main board is faulty.\nWorst case, get a quote from a data recovery service and understand if they charge if they cannot get back what you want. Be careful - some say if any data is recovered - be sure to specify you only want photos if that's what you're considering paying for.\nIf you have a Mac - check out PhoneView to restore the photos. There are lots of other apps, you can search them here for specifics but you might have passed the window where you can get the photos back.\n", "Q: What are the \"Overlapping Squares\" icon in status menu on login screen? On El Capitan's login screen the status menu (top right near time) shows an icon of two overlapping squares, one square is to the top left and looks behind the other. \nIt doesn't show once I login.\nWhat does this icon represe \n\nA: Does the icon look like what is in this image? \nhttp://cdn.osxdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/screen-sharing-messages-app-mac-os-x.jpg\nIf so it sounds like it would be related to Screen Sharing.\n", "Q: iPhone on silent except for calls When I sleep, I don't want to hear any notifications from my phone, unless I get a phone call. In case it's an emergency from a family member, etc.\nIs there a way to set it to silent on every app but phone calls easily?\n\nA: Put the contacts you want to allow to call you when you are sleeping to a group an give that group a name.\nThen: Settings > Do not Disturb > Allow Calls From > select group of contacts that you created.\nAdditionally you may select to allow repeated calls (if someone will call you second time within 3 minutes - you will hear it) and choose Scheduled if you want to schedule your Do Not Disturb to switch on automatically.\n", "Q: Yosemite: How can I diagnose problem where Chrome won't download anything When I try to download anything in chrome, nothing happens (eg. saving an image with right click). When I try to download an extension, chrome says This item is already being downloaded and added into Chrome. I looked \"under the hood\" and the Download folder is correctly set. Downloads work in safari. This problem also persists in Chromium. I have tried several solutions to my problem, but I simply cannot download anything. I tried deleting my chrome profile, pasting a past solution into terminal, as well as completely deleting all chrome applications I could find and reinstalling. I thought this could be a cache problem and deleted the cache (sudo rm -rf ~/Library/Caches) as well as my Google Library folder (rm -rf ~/Library/Google). However, none of these attempts have affected my situation\nWhat could be causing this issue?

I installed gcc via homebrew with no errors.\nbrew install homebrew/versions/gcc49\nbrew unlink gcc49 && brew link gcc49\n\nBut when I try to run gcc, clang is used instead. \n~$:gcc --version\nConfigured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1\nApple LLVM version 7.0.0 (clang-700.1.76)\nTarget: x86_64-apple-darwin15.0.0\nThread model: posix\n\nEdit:\n~$:type gcc\ngcc is /usr/bin/gcc\n~$:type /usr/bin/gcc\n/usr/bin/gcc is /usr/bin/gcc\n~$:echo $PATH\n/usr/local/sbin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/TeX/texbin\n\n\nA: Instead of invoking using gcc you need to call gcc-4.9. Alternately you could create an alias for gcc to point to gcc-4.9(although that is risky).\n\nA: For anyone who stumbles upon this currently (like I did), I found that I needed to locate my version of gcc (which I had installed with brew). This is annoying when gcc --version gives the clang version instead! To find the correct gcc version, run\n$ ls /usr/local/opt/gcc/bin | grep gcc\ngcc-10\ngcc-ar-10\ngcc-nm-10\n...\n\nSo I had gcc-10. Whenever you wish to use gcc just replace it with gcc-10, e.g. man gcc-10. Of course you could write an alias for gcc to gcc-10, but this probably is not a great idea as Xcode seems to rely on the gcc --> clang simlink.\n", "Q: icons not bouncing at all when I open them I was forced to do a fresh install of El Cap. Now when I click on an app to open it, it will not bounce, not even once to acknowledge that the app is opening. \nHow do I solve that?\n\nA: You need to select Animate opening Applications option from Dock Preferences:\n\n", "Q: How to format multiple exFAT partitions on USB drive? I'm following the instructions in Creating a bootable Clonezilla dual partition USB device but using my Mac laptop running El-Capitan.\nI managed to create an MBR partition table and two partitions on the external USB drive using OSX' fdisk utility but I failed to find a way to format the existing partitions to ExFAT.\nAll the references I found so far point to diskutil eraseDisk or suggest using Windows or Linux for that, but I don't have access to bare-iron servers with these OS's and failed to access the unformatted USB drive from VirtualBox virtual machines on my laptop.\nSo, the question is - \"Is there a way to execute the equivalent of mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdb1 on OS X?\"\n\nA: To format an ExFAT partition, unmount the partition and use (sudo) newfs_exfat [options] /dev/disk*s*. Check man newfs_exfat for the options.\nThe default FAT-size is 32bit, so you don't have to (or more precisely: you can't easily) specify the -F option.\nTypically the Terminal commands should look like this:\ndiskutil list #to get the disk identifier of the exFAT partition\ndiskutil unmount /dev/diskxsy\nsudo newfs_exfat -v Name /dev/diskxsy\n\n\nA: You can also use diskutil directly:\ndiskutil eraseVolume ExFat NewVolume /dev/diskXsY\n                     |     |\n                     ^ Format of partition\n                           ^ Name of the new volume\n\nYou can also re-partition a whole disk all in one command:\ndiskutil partitionDisk /dev/diskX 2 MBR \\\n        ExFAT NewVolumeA 100M \\     |\n        ExFAT NewVolumeB R          |\n        |     |          |          ^ Partition scheme, can be GPT or APM too\n        ^ Format of partition\n              ^ Name of the new volume\n                         ^ Size of the volume, R means the rest.\n\n", "Q: MacBook air is messed up, can't erase the hard drive from recovery Something happened when installing El Capitan and now I have only one partition in my hard drive with only 30 gigs of space when it's supposed to be 128.

I have set up Internet Sharing over Wifi on an ethernet-wired desktop Mac running Yosemite 10.10. I have various OS X and iOS clients that are able to connect to the shared Wifi connection and access the internet normally.\nThe internet Sharing utility that is supplied in System Preferences is easy to use, but provides very few configuration options. I'd like my OS X client devices to see my Bonjour shares, and for that I believe they need to be on the same subnet. Internet Sharing creates its own subnet, however, and I'm forced to use clunky workarounds to access my Bonjour-shared material.\nThe primary subnet is 192.168.1.X. The subnet created by Internet Sharing is 192.168.2.X. I want any device that connects to the shared wireless to be on 192.168.1.X.\nI believe that I could use the ethernet and wireless interfaces on my desktop Mac in bridge mode, where the desktop simply passes any packets it receives from either end straight through.\nI have read up on ifconfig at FreeBSD, and got as far as creating a bridge and associating the two interfaces with it:\nsudo ifconfig bridge create\n(response: bridge1)\nsudo ifconfig bridge1 addm en0 addm en1 up\nsudo ifconfig en0 up\nsudo ifconfig en1 up\n\nHere, en0 is my ethernet interface, and en1 is my wireless interface. The documentation says that the bridge device needs an IP, so I gave it a static one instead of using DHCP:\nsudo ifconfig bridge1 inet 192.168.1.3/24\n\nThe CIDR notation set up the netmask and broadcast addresses for me. I kinda hoped my wifi clients would be able to see 192.168.1.3 from that point, but no dice.\nI have a DHCP server at 192.168.1.1, an Airport at 192.168.1.2 (which is inaccessible for these devices due to range), a router at 192.168.1.254 and DHCP addresses allowed in the range 192.168.1.4-192.168.1.253. The Airport is itself in bridge mode and provides no services other than the Wifi access point.\nThe issue I have is how to then set up the wireless access point on the desktop Mac. I know that I need to set the SSID, PSK, encryption, password, but the guides I am able to find online refer to various flavours of Linux and differ to what I have. Some guides are downright tantalising with the apparent simplicity of the task, such as this one: Creating a FreeBSD Wireless Access Point. There, one simply supplies parameters to ifconfig, but those parameters are missing from the OS X implementation. I know that OS X has the tools to do this already installed, since it can do it via Internet Sharing. I don't know how it does it and haven't been able to find out with the usual Googling.\n\nA: I've had the same question, but from the other point of view. I wasn't aware of ifconfig (kinda new to this stuff).\nI think I got it working by doing it the other way round.\nI first had OS X share my internet over wifi (via sharing preferences)\nThen with ifconfig, you'll see that OS X creates a bridge100 (or something)\nI set the IP manually like you did on that bridge\nand then I add my network connection supplying the internet access.\nNot entirely sure whether it works perfectly, at first glance, everything works OK, but who knows....\n", "Q: iPhone 5 upgrading after syncing with iTunes I synced with iPhone and was asked whether I wanted to upgrade my iPhone 5.  After that I could not open my phone.  When pressing the started button I get a picture of what looks like a charger with an arrow pointing to iTunes.  I tried to reboot, but to no avail.\n\nA: When you see the lightning cable and iTunes logo on your screen, it means that your iPhone has entered Recovery mode.\nThe best thing to do is to connect your iPhone to iTunes on a Mac or Windows PC and restore it. \nITunes should display a popup saying that you connected an iPhone in Recovery Mode.\nFrom the screen in iTunes, select restore or restore and update. (Actual button names could be different as what I say)\nAfter you restored your iPhone you need to configure it. If you want, you can restore a backup from iCloud or iTunes when there's one available.\n", "Q: How to set the color of terminal text in ssh session exact same as local session? So this is almost a copy from my previous question: Change output color of terminal (in Mac) to be different from typed text color for which I got a great answer here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/218736/34070. However, the only problem is that when I use ssh, all the text in the ssh session is now lightblue (see screenshot). How can I get the ssh session to use the same color scheme as my local session, and also have different output color for type commands and output?\n\n\nA: The main issue here is that the prompt command and colouring options are sourced from the computer you are logged into.  So when you ssh somewhere, you must change the colouring/prompts on that server as well.\nThere are a couple of options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Depending on the OS of the server you are logging into you could reset the prompt colours in the login scripts there.  Or;\n\n*Add an exception in the preexec command you installed before so it doesn't change the foreground colour for ssh commands\n\n\nSomething like\n    [ \"$BASH_COMMAND\" =~ \"^ssh\" ] && return\nin the preexec_invoke_exec function.\n", "Q: Encrypt home directory only I have a shared computer that is primarily for my use, but occasionally when I'm out of the office others would like to use it. \nThese others require Administrator access to be able to install software etc. but I'm concerned (just as much out of mistake as anything else) about the security of my personal stuff on the machine. \nI'm looking for a means to encrypt my home directory that can only be unlocked by my password. \nObviously FV2 doesn't cut it, as the full drive is decrypted as soon as the other user logs in. \n\nA: If you do not want to encrypt the whole home directory but only a few files/directories you could use something like Hider. It's paid though.\n", "Q: How can I mount Microsoft OneDrive as a network drive in OSX? I have a 50GB OneDrive account which is basically full.\nI'd like to store/access stuff directly on/from my OneDrive by mounting as a network share, rather than syncing with my Mac, and therefore using up 50GB of Mac HDD space.\nThis is possible on Windows, and I can confirm this works on my OneDrive account.\nOn Mac, I try the equivalent, e.g.:\n\nThis correctly asks for credentials:\n\nBut then fails:\n\nAny ideas?\n\nA: You cannot mount a remote \"drive\" to OneDrive as the synchronization/authentication  protocol is not implemented within the OS X file system.  (It is in Windows, which is why can you do it).\nHowever, I have a client who accomplished this with an App:  CloudMounter.  It worked really well and was priced pretty fairly ($30).\nI personally don't have a need for this software so I don't use it (I am also not affiliated with this company in any way).  However, I can tell you that it has worked very well for my client and he has no issues with it.\n\nA: I think your not the only one with this problem, actually I think it isn't supported by Microsoft, personally I use ExpanDrive, an app focused on creating virtual drives for cloud services.\nHope this helps,\nTiferrei\n\nA: Try Browsing to your onedrive from a web browser. then click into any directory. Once in there look at the URL and copy the numbers and letters after id= to the % sign. Then add that at the end of https://d.docs.live.net/xxxxxxxxxx for an example. That works for me.\n\nA: The workaround to this, of course, is to simply save cloud-based documents directly to your mounted iCloud Drive, then copy from there into your OneDrive. OneDrive doesn't care where those files reside, so it thinks iCloud is just another locally mounted volume.\n\nA: If you use MSOffice on the Mac, it will allow you to set OneDrive as default file location. When opening or saving files, you can select any folder in your OneDrive account without the need for a local copy as iCloud does. That should Apple do with iCloud too. \n", "Q: Disabled OS X Server still appear on localhost Before when I entered localhost into the browser there was my localhost from MAMP, basically directory for my web repositories.

I thought the issue might be with my screen connector, but the artifacts are captured when I take a screenshot. The artifacts are never the same and are always located in different parts of the screen.\nAny ideas?\n\n\nA: This is usually due to a GPU issue on the Mac. I have seen things online which say that this is due to graphic switching, which only occurs if you have two graphic cards which switch due to software (e.g say if you are using Photoshop which uses a much more powerful card and then you quit it and it returns to a normal card). \nA MacBook Pro 2012 only has internal graphics and not a AMD Radeon R9 M370X, which only the MacBook Pro 15-inch has, meaning it is not software, but it is due to a hardware issue, in this case, the GPU. \nIf it is in warranty, take it in to Apple and see what happens there. \nI hope you get something sorted out soon. \nCheers!\n", "Q: Troubleshooting installing Xcode updates, stuck I am trying to install the upgrades to Xcode, Xcode version 7.2. Unfortunately, the App Store shows that this installation has been \"Installing --- less than a minute\" for over four hours. \nIt appears to be stuck. How can I fix this? Why is this happening? \nI tried correcting the permissions for Xcode, running \n$sudo pkgutil --repair com.apple.pkg.Xcode\n\nI get this in return:\nVerifying files from package 'com.apple.pkg.Xcode' on '/'.\n    ACL found but not expected on 'Applications'.\n    Unable to set owner & group on \"Applications\". Error 1: Operation not permitted\n    Unable to set permissions on \"Applications\". Error 1: Operation not permitted\n\nCan I try to install these upgrades via the Terminal? I am using OS X El Capitan 10.11.2\n\nA: For command line you could try using:\nsudo softwareupdate -l (to list all available updates)\nsudo softwareupdate -ai (to install updates)\nsudo softwareupdate --help (for other help options)\n\nA: Based on my recent experience (this morning).\nDownloading Xcode7.2 without going through the App Store is a waste of time and can give problems later. Best to delete all previous attempts.\nLog onto your Apple Developer account.\nLook for Xcode 7.2 and download this dmg. You will be asked to agree to new Apple agreement. The download is 4.5GB +, so it may take awhile. In Berlin with a 100Mb line, it still took 18+ minutes for me.\nOnce the dmg is fully downloaded, double click on icon in your Downloads directory (don't click on any previously downloaded xcode7.2 dmg)\nThe splash screen requires you to drag Xcode into Applications. If you are asked whether to replace a newer version - keep your wits about you. If you have previously downloaded xcode7.2 outside of the App Store envelope, it may be 'more recent'.\nThe copy from Download directory to Applications directory will take time. Expanded, the file size is 9GB+\n\nYou may also want the new command line tools. There are two versions depending on what version of OS X you are using.\nHave fun\n\nA: On my machine, it would not start until I deleted the version in applications. Then the download started.\n", "Q: Download speed of an app at the App Store? I think the title is self-descriptive, but I'll describe it more precisely here: What I mean by \"Download Speed of an app\" is when you click in the download button of an application, at the Purchases tab we'll see the app downloading, like this:\n\nWhere can I see the download speed of OS X El Capitan, in the case of this image?\n\nThis might have been asked before, but I don't find it anywhere. \nI tried clicking the progress bar, but nothing is displayed, the only thing that the Purchases tab displays is the app, downloaded size, and time remaining.\nThis question takes me to another question: How do I know what's all that's being downloaded? I ask this because I feel the download speed is very slow sometimes, and I'd like to know what are the apps that are downloading stuff...\n\nA: The download speed on the App Store depends on two things: speed and size. If you have a DSL connection (the average connection is around 128kbps to 3000kbps (3mbps)), it is going to be very slow to download an app. If you have fiber optic internet (which can range from 10mbps to a Gigabit) it is going to be a hell of a lot faster. \nIf you are downloading El Capitan, which is 6.2GB, and you are downloading on a 5mbps connection, then it will take almost 3 hours to download. \nYou should take a Speedtest here and see what your speed is, you can also see if you are getting what you paid for. Go to this link and input your download speed here.\nI have found that if you have inputted DNS servers in System Preferences, remove the DNS servers and that should make it a little faster.\nHappy downloading!\nCheers \nEDIT: If you want to see how fast it is downloading, try Rubbernet which shows how much bandwidth a process or an app is using. Another app (which I use), is iStat Menus. It only shows processes that are using most of the bandwidth. The process that you are looking for is \"storedownloadd\" which downloads apps on the App Store. Sorry for misunderstanding you. \n\nA: You can check in Activity Monitor. Go to the Network tab. You can only see the total download speed of all apps together. For the individual apps you can see the number of Bytes and packages received. That should give you an idea of how fast the download is going. \n", "Q: What software can I use to mirror my MIDI keyboard controller on-screen?

Can anyone tell me if that will be an issue? And if so, is there something specific I can do to make it all work? Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: As long as the songs are still present inside his library in iTunes, all the songs are still available to sync over to the new iPod touch.\nAlso, you should be able to sync his old iPod nano to iTunes to get the songs back in the event that they are not in the library.\n", "Q: Numbers Between Formula IF(AND(B13≤74,B13≥75,B13>90),\"0\",\"3, 5\")\n\nI'm trying to generate an if statement that outputs either 0 if under 74 or under 3 between 75 - 89 and 5 if over 90.

If so, and Boot Camp is a no-no, then you need something like Parallels Desktop 11, which will enable you to run Windows 7, 8 or 10 alongside OS X and switch from one to the other very easily. Indeed, if you have sufficient storage capacity, two or more Windows virtual machines can be set up.  I have 7 and 10 virtual machines on my MacBook Pro. Installing Windows is a breeze, but transferring the existing machine configuration will be an unavoidable chore; I don't know of any shortcuts.\n\nA: The downloaded image for Virtual Box has the name IE11 - Win7.ova, and the image for VMware is named IE11_-_Win7-disk1.vmdk - this means that your image can only run in VMware.\nYes, you are right you can run a .vmdk file in Virtual Box, but then this image should have been made for Virtual Box.\n", "Q: Block emails from specific sender only in Mac OS mail program I have an email account registered on my Macbook and on two more devices. Is it possible to block / not download all emails from a specific sender just on my device but not touch the server email account settings, so the sender can still send to the two other devices?\n\nA: I think your best option would be to set a rule so that if the sender is this than archive message, I wouldn't recommend deleting the message as (depending on your mail server's settings) it may delete the message also on your other devices.\nHope this helps,\nTiferrei\n\nA: I don't think you can do that.

He remembers the password, but he cannot remember his Apple ID's password, nor the security question, nor the password for the email linked to this account. I can access the phone, even jailbreak it, but how can I remove or change the password of the Apple ID?\n\nA: There's no way to reset the password of the Apple ID if you don't know neither the answer to the security question nor the password to the email account linked to the Apple ID.\nHowever, you can easily remove the Apple ID from your iPhone. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > iCloud.\n\n*At the bottom of the page, tap Delete Account.\n\n*Tap Delete to confirm.\n\n\nA: The Apple ID is tied to the device's serial number on Apple's servers. You cannot change it without going through Apple. Something that is technically possible, but unethical, is bypassing the Activation Lock (only if you're jailbroken, and I'm not going to cite any references), which will make your device think that it's tied to someone else's account (or no account at all), but that still doesn't change it on Apple's side.\n", "Q: Magic Mouse Sticks in Full Clamshell I have been using my MBP (13\" mid-2009 running OSX 10.9.5) in clamshell mode with an external monitor connected via minidisplay port, Apple wireless keyboard, and magic mouse for a couple of months. Starting a few weeks ago the mouse would not recognize left clicks anymore and remain stuck on a random spot on the screen with a left click when I close the MBP and try to work in clamshell mode. It still tracks, so that when I move the mouse it highlights from where it got stuck. Also right clicks still work; but obviously they are no use without being able to left click. Also, the keyboard works without any issues.\nThis problem disappears when I open the lid minimally without waking the MBP monitor. This workaround was suggested here. Similar fixes that people have suggested such as removing any plugged-in USB devices do not apply because there isn't anything plugged in besides the MDP and the magsafe connector.\nAdditionally, I believe that it's not a hardware issue because it worked previously, i.e. an external bluetooth dongle or wrapping aluminum foil around the MDP should not be required.\nAny suggestions or fixes?\nThanks!\n\nA: News Flash edit\nFound this discussion which strongly suggests it is a hardware problem but not the mouse itself. One guy solved it by using a USB dongle.\nMy original answer remains below, un-edited.\nend News Flash edit\n\nNever had this problem w/ my magic mouse, nonetheless...\nGet back to a default - disable any 3rd party enhancement software. Reset mouse system preferences to defaults.\nMagic Mouse iFixIt video search\nFrom there, Here's an interesting video: Can I DYI fix a Broken Left-Click Resistance?. The tear down may not be something you want to do. I think I would try because the mouse seems pretty useless in its current state. iFixIt sells tools and parts for doing this kind of stuff.\nP.S. I liked my magic mouse perfectly fine. In the PC world this thing is E.T. alien technology.

It reboots to safe mode and then back to normal mode.\nThis has happened before on version 8.4, but it wasn't connected to WiFi then. Restore fixed it.\nI want to know how I can fix it without a restore so I can keep root access. I have root SSH access to the device, which is amazingly still connected to the WiFi. I can also use apt tools(apt-get apt-cache dpkg) and I've removed the last installed tweaks(apt-get purge)(DefaultPlayer and iCleaner).\nIf I have to restore, is there a way to backup over SSH and restore to a jailbreakable version?\n\nA: First things first, always backup.\n\n\n*\n\n*No jailbreakable iOS version is being signed so no, if you restore it you'll lose your jailbreak. \n\n\nThe problem is probably a theme relates package, try disabling winterBoard themes. \nI would suggest reinstalling the system anyway because if your safe mode isn't working it means that the private system partition is broken, even if you got it working for some reason it would have loads of problems in the future, unfortunately, you'll lose your jailbreak. \nAlso, I'd suggest making a backup with iMazing, a great OS X (and windows) tool to manage your iDevices in more detail. \nSorry for that, \nTiferrei\n", "Q: OS X: When a notification is closed in one computer why it is still present in another computer? Got two computers with the same OS X version, with the same account name and Apple ID, I will call these two equipments A and B.\nWhen a notification pops-out from Calendar app in A the same goes for B, when closed the notification in A, B still shows the notification.

Without the card, it wasn't easy to find the book.\nSimilarly, to save time when deleting a file or even a directory, computers just delete the pointer to the file rather than the entire file. Meaning that the file is still out there, just not easily seen, since the pointer, the card catalog entry is missing.  Unfortunately, because there is no catalog entry for the deleted files, the space occupied by the newly invisible files is marked as available and any actions that write to that space risk erasing those files permanently.\nTo get the file back, as was previously mentioned, you can use undelete tools, such as Boomerang, to scan the hard drive for files that are missing file system entries in the \"catalog\". The undelete tool will then locate any deleted files and then recreate the original file system entries, making the files visible.\nI just noticed you asked for Unix commands, my bad.  I don't know of any Unix commands, but as you've seen there are a number of GUI-based undelete tools, like boomerang, that you might use.\n\nA: First check your Time Machine Backup. The file is probably still there.\nIf don't have a Time Machine Backup or that folder wasn't backed up, you can use one of many third party tools to try and retrieve the files.  Prosoft Data Rescue, Disk Warrior,  EaseUS Data Recovery, FileSalvage, Disk Drill, PhotoRec.\nAvoid writing new data, so the deleted sectors aren't overwritten. So ideally shut the computer down and use a different computer or boot drive to get the data recovery tool.\n", "Q: How can I re-download music I bought onto my iPhone?

There are two native options to navigate the menu bar. First, very quick, and intuitive, is a Mac universal shortcut Command(⌘)+? (which is: ⌘+Shift+/) which will take you to the Help menu. From there you can search whatever menu bar item you wish, and get the shortcut if one exists; just start typing.\n\nSecond if you manually want to navigate the menu bar then, open System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Keyboard > Check and Set shortcut for Move focus to the menu bar. This way you can move focus and navigate using arrow keys.\n\nIf you go to the App Shortcuts category in the same pane, you can also change the Help Menu shortcut to your liking.\nTertiary option would be, investing in a third party application to help you find/remember shortcuts faster. Personally, would recommend KeyCue. There are several others, just search on Google or App Store.\n\nA: See the official Apple Documentation: Mac keyboard shortcuts for accessibility features\nAnother helpful trick:\nUsing your keyboard with dialogs won't work by default.

Is some missing due to the partitioning?\n\n*What do I need to do in order to get Boot Camp Assistant to function properly?\n\n*How can I repair any damages that occurred due to the failed attempt?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*209 GB usable space is normal for a 256HD.  It has to do with formatted partition sizes plus the hidden recovery partition.  Totally normal.\n\n*It will likely crap out again.  Not sure why.  To fix it, you'd need to look at log files (Applications/Utilities/Console) system.log and see if there's any error or at least what its doing.  Fixing it will be a total PITA.  The most direct way to fix it, will be to back everything up, boot from an Internet Recovery (not the local recovery) and totally repartition the drive using Disk Util.  Then put the Mac OS back and your data back.  Then do it again.  \n\n*Hold Command-R at boot to boot up the hidden recovery partition.  In there, use Disk Utility to check the disk for errors.

If I were to quit using Match, would I still get my own songs via upload to the cloud or whatever, or would I only be able to access Apple's music? I'd die if I couldn't stream my garageband projects to all my devices.\n\nA: Apple has a quit informative support-article that addresses the differences between Apple Music and iTunes Match. Both include the iCloud Music Library witch can store your songs, the main difference between both services is what will be stored within this library:\niTunes Match\n\n\n*\n\n*When joining iTunes Match, it matches all your local music using the sound profile of each song.\n\n*If the song is available within the catalogue of iTunes, it is added to your iCloud Music Library and made available to download or stream on all devices as 256 Kbps DRM-free AAC.\n\n*Songs that are not available in the catalogue are uploaded to your iCloud Music Library without any changes. Likewise they are available on all your devises.\n\n*If you cancel your iTunes Match subscription, all songs already matched can be played or downloaded open end as there is no DRM in place. Only new songs are not added.\n\n\nApple Music:\n\n\n*\n\n*When joining Apple Music, you local music is matched against Apple Music's catalogue using the meta-data of each song.\n\n*If a song is available within the catalogue, it is made available on all devices via Apple Music (similar to how you can click on \"Add to library\" upon every song in Apple Music). Songs can be streamed or downloaded on all devices, but will always be DRM protected 256 Kbps AAC.\n\n*If you cancel your Apple music subscription, these songs will no longer be playable, downloadable etc.\n\n*However the songs in your local library you initially matched against remain unchanged (no encoding, no DRM) and can be used as before.\n\n*Songs that are not available in the catalogue of Apple Music are uploaded to your iCloud Music Library and available on all your devises. I could not find any information regarding DRM or encoding changes for these \"unmatched\" songs.\n\n\nApple Music and iTunesMatch:\n\n\n*\n\n*When both are used, songs are matched and made available as described for iTunes Match (no added DRM etc.) and Apple Music just acts as a streaming service without interfering with your local files.\n\n\nSo to answer your question directly, your own projects would continue to be available on all devices if you would just use Apple Music.\n", "Q: Generate Safari Developer Certificate for building extensions I have gone through this link.But everything seems to be changed.\nEverything redirects to Apple Development Program.So is it mandatory to enroll in that development program to create a safari development certificate to create extensions?\nAnd if so where can I get that certificate from?\n\nA: Apple unified all the developer programs (iOS, Mac and Safari) under one umbrella program entitled Apple Developer Program.

When searching in iTerm2, some kind of of fancy live highlighting thing seems to kick in even before you hit enter. When the scrollback buffer has more than a few thousand lines in it, this search mode seems to become unusably slow. It maxes out a CPU at 100% and doesn't actually find anything while it's \"thinking\", making it impossible to search long scroll buffers. And it never finishes thinking (at least not quickly enough for me to have seen it ever finish).\nEven just typing the characters into the search box becomes slow, one character appearing per second.\nIs it possible to disable the highlighting (to only highlight the current result) or otherwise speed up search? I'm trying to switch from Terminal.app to iTerm but, as I have discovered, I search a lot.\n\nA: Well first of all incremental search is a wonderful feature (that I guess you would be using inside vim as well). There is workaround for doing non-incremental search though.\n\n\n*\n\n*Type the word to be searched on the terminal prompt.\n\n*Highlight the word (using mouse or keyboard). \n\n*Hit CommandE.\n\n*Hit CommandF.\n\n*Hit Enter\nThis should highlight all occurrences the words in one shot.\n\nA: I haven't encountered this particular problem, but I also don't use the built in searching feature very much.\nBecause of how this is programmed, it does duplicate work. Say you want to search for \"set background mode\"; as you are typing it searches for \"s\", then \"se\", then \"set\", etc. Using copy and paste for your search term may help a little bit but probably not noticeably.\nAlternative 1: Play with iTerm settings\nYou can find the iTerm 2 scrollback settings in Preferences > Profiles > Terminal > Scrollback Buffer\nMine are set to:\n\n\n*\n\n*[x] Unlimited scrollback\n\n*[ ] Save lines to scrollback when an app status bar is present\n\n*[x] Save lines to scrollback in alternate screen mode\n\n\nAlternative 2: Reduce the size of your scrollback buffer\nIf you untick \"Unlimited scrollback\", you can then set a small value for Scrollback Lines. This will reduce the amount to text that have to be searched. It could make your searching more tolerable at the expense of a smaller scrollback.\nAlternative 3: Upgrade to the latest version\nI'm using iTerm2 Build 2.9.20151111, which is a Beta for 3.0. It operates very well and has additional features over the stable 2.x version.\nAlternative 4: Take this question to the developers\nThis should really be Alternative 1.

In the FaceTime settings, FaceTime is still listed as the default dialer. \nAny idea where Chrome would have made this change and how I can revert it? Better yet, how can i remove all remnants of google hangouts from my life??\n\nA: I'm not sure about removing hangouts completely (perhaps use a cleaning tool such as CleanMyMac, though many users dislike that type of app), but I have a suggesting for changing how telephone links are handled: try RCDefaultApp, a free prefpane which manages default apps for opening different types of files and URIs.\nUsing that prefpane, you could change the default setting for tel URLs to open using the FaceTime app.\nMore details on modifying the files that control these defaults are in this answer on SuperUser.\n\nA: I am using SwiftDefaultApps in macOS Mojave, to manage URL and application handlers. \"tel\" is set to FaceTime and yet clicking on telephone number links, in Chrome, is still opening Hangouts.\n", "Q: Restore data in iPhone I accidentally went into my phone and deleted my phone from Find My iPhone, I was surprised to see that all my photos and contacts and app were deleted, I want to restore my old data back, how can I do that?\n\nA: You can do it from a previous backup saved in your computer (where is located iTunes) or from an iCloud backup. \nBoth the procedures can be done if and only if you previously completed a backup.\nRestore from an iCloud backup\n\n\n*\n\n*On your iOS device, go to Settings > General > Software Update.

So the contents of the JAVA_HOME environment is altered in the child process, but the child process can't affect the environment of the parent process in your interactive shell.\nYou can setup the environment for your interactive shell in various places depending on the shell (~/.bash_profile is one for bash as you alluded to in your question).

Often in the winter (low humidity), getting up from and sitting down onto the seat at my desk, or taking off a jacket, and such will build up a static electric charge on my body.  Sometimes I don't remember to touch a metal object before touching my MacBook Pro, causing me to zap my laptop.  Is this likely to cause damage?  Should I be very careful to discharge before touching my laptop?\n\nA: That shouldn't be a problem at all if your MacBook is connected to the power source since it's grounded and by the way I wouldn't consider harmful to touch the MacBook body after being electrically charged even if the MacBook isn't connected to the power source. You have to pay attention only if you're touching directly motherboard components.\nEDIT\nMy answer is not completely correct.\nCheck the comments\n\nA: I wouldn't recommend it. I'd try hard to remember to discharge on something more robust first.\nThe reason you get away with it is that the case acts as a Faraday cage, sending the 'zap' of static charge round the outside of the casing, rather than through the components inside.  \nThis, however, doesn't include the power adapter itself, which is taking the brunt of the power-flow. It will be protected against such, but I wouldn't recommend making a habit of it, it won't survive it forever.\nThe standard design of any inline or 'wall wart' type power supply is that they are not in fact Earthed [US grounded, though unfortunately that term causes confusion as it appears it can apply to a return path rather than a true earth connected to physical 'dirt'/cold water mains supply etc]  \nThe same type of supply is responsible for the buzz or hum you can sometimes feel when you touch a device powered from this type of power supply - it is leakage of very small quantities of high voltage which the PSU fails to suppress; not in itself dangerous.  \nIn the case of you 'zapping' the computer with built-up static electricity, the charge can actually return down the same path that causes the 'buzz'. \n", "Q: How to prevent changes on the iPad I have an iPad with iOS 9 that is used by technological illiterate people of my family.

I'm with Verizon on an iPhone 6 running iOS 9.\n\nA: Adopting a Google Voice number would allow you to do this, but only for calls placed to your Google Voice telephone number. It will also allow you access to SMS (non-iMessage) messages to that number.\n\nA: This is definitely not a free option but have you considered (or do you have) an Apple Smartwatch? \nYou can connect a smartwatch to your phone by connecting to your wi-fi in your building (if you can leave your phone in your car or somewhere safe, get service and connect to the wi-fi that is). This way your phone can be picking up the calls and transfer the information to your smartwatch.\nProbably not the prefered action, but I believe it is the only way you can really do what you are asking.

It is lethal.  as in, deadly. as in, if you do it, STOP everything and fix it. or your Mac could very well die.\nGeneral stupid ways of handling spilled water could include:\n\n\n*\n\n*crossing your fingers and hoping that nothing got hurt\n\n*inserting your Mac into a gallon of rice and hoping that it dried out with no damage\n\n*inserting your Mac into a microwave to dry it out\n\n*restarting your mac (or plugging it in) without having disassembled it and cleaning out the water.\n\n*logging onto the internet with the mac and querying others to see what they'd do.\n\n\nGeneral intelligent ways of dealing with spilled water would include:\n\n\n*\n\n*IMMEDIATELY shutting it off\n\n*NOT restarting it\n\n*NOT plugging it in\n\n*removing the battery (if removable)\n\n*fully disassembling the laptop (or taking it to a shop which does the above)\n\n\nWater leads to all of the following actions:\n\n\n*\n\n*shortouts (chips burning up)\n\n*corrosion\n\n*blown circuits\n\n*battery failure\n\n*fire\n\n*permanent damage\n\n*mold\n\n\nIF you spill water in your Mac, shut it down. do not reboot it. remove the battery. disconnect power. Take it to a professional shop who repairs issues like this.\nletting it simply sit for a few days will only prolong the damage, because water causes corrosion. \nThe ONLY correct action after a liquid spill is to fully clean the boards, dehydrate them, then reassemble.  and if you don't know what you're doing, you're likely going to cause MORE damage.\nBased on your explanation, your Mac got water in it. and your running of it has likely blown the ADC circuit on the logic board, or possibly part of the USB sub-circuit.\n\nA: Well. Everything's working fine now.\nI just had to hit it hard (no jokes)\nAnd it's working like charm, even after all the time.\nI found out that this Mac is pretty old, maybe water wasn't even the case.\n", "Q: Server/machine name on desktop background I've seen that single-color desktop background with the familiar serif font showing the computer's name since the 1990s. \nI very much doubt that all of the server admins I've come across in that time have painstakingly created actual image files with the same font treatment.\nHow the heck does one set that up?

I want to enter the event as 06:00 here, but really mean 06:00 in the Netherlands local time. The calendar is in iCloud.\nThis happens all the time when booking flights — the times are always in local time, which is, of course, appropriate.\nWhat is the correct setting in the iPhone and on the MacBook for this to work? I think the wording has changed, but I never thought it was clear.\nCurrently I add the local time in the notes just in case. I was caught out in the past when the event showed the wrong time (fortunately it meant I was too early for the flight).\n\nA: I have spent a lot of time in order to have clean calendar entries for flights over multiple time zones. I couldn't find any good solution, because iOS and OS X only support ONE time zone per event (by the way, so does Microsoft Exchange). \nThe best solution I found was to create two events :\n\n\n*\n\n*One for the take-off, specified in its local time zone. \n\n*One for the landing, also in its local time zone.\n\n\nAnd when your phone or computer changes time zone, you have the correct local time.\nIn a perfect world, an event should be able to have 2 time zones (one for the start time and one for the end time). Apple could do it, but it would probably break compatibility with other applications like Outlook.\n\nA: From OS X Calendar Preferences you could turn on TimeZone settings.\n\n\nThen you can select the timezone you want to display calendar time in and make entries in that timezone.\n\n\nA: It appears that iOS 10 (currently I have 10.3.3) supports different time zones for start and end of the event. Here's a screenshot below showing how you can create a calendar entry via iOS that spans across different time zones:\n\n\n\nA: Don't you think it's ridiculous that a calendar app like that on the iphone provides no way for you to enter the time zone of an event? Di people with iphones never catch planes? The only way this can be done is for the user to change the default time zone for the whole calendar, enter the event, then restore the original setting.\nYou'd have thought this would be possible. In fact, support is already there: if you receive an ical appointment file in an e-mail, it's time zone specification will be used. So how come you can't enter it yourself?\nThe only way I've found so far is to type times into a Notes document, with the GMT offset, eg 2015-12-17 19:00+08:00 for a Singapore time. This is properly recognised as a date, highlighted as a link when you stop editing. The link invites you to create a calendar entry. When you do, annoyingly, the offset information disappears, but the time, adjusted to current local, is correct.\nThere is definitely room for improvement here. \n", "Q: time on MBP doesnot update I am using MBP running yosemite(10.10.1) retina 15inch mid 2014, it is not showing correct time.

However, if there is at least one Finder window, when the line tell application \"Finder\" to activate desktop is run, it will make that window active, rather than the desktop.\nWhat is the reason for this? And what is the correct way to put the focus on the desktop (same effect as clicking on the desktop image)?\n(Doing this on El Capitan)\n\nA: You could tell Finder to minimise all it's windows by:\ntell every window\n    set collapsed to true\nend tell\n\nThen activate desktop and the usual.\n\nA: Here is some code I could make work on my \"Capitan\":\ntell application \"System Events\"\n  tell application \"Finder\" to activate\n  repeat while (value of attribute \"AXfocused\" of group 1 of scroll area of ¬\n     process \"Finder\" is {false})\n        keystroke \"<\" using command down\n  end repeat\nend tell\n\nThe repeat-loop checks whether \"group 1 of scroll area\" --which to my surprise \"is\" Desktop-- is \"AXFocused\" (meaning finder's active \"window\").\nIf NOT so, it keystrokes \"cmd <\" (on a German keyboard), which is identical to finder's:\n<menu: \"Windows\" / \"Next window\"> menu item.\nYou will see some or all of your windows brought to front ONCE.   \n(I tried all kinds of \"clicks\", \"selects\" and the like beforehands  to no avail ...)\n", "Q: Wrapping youtube-dl into automator via applescript I am hoping to make an automator application that prompts the user for input (i.e. youtube url), and downloads it using  youtube-dl (already installed via Homebrew).

I've had my iPhone 6 for a year now and have never experienced such a crash. I am a novice coder and am aware of 32 bit time restraints. \nBeing as curious as I am I was wondering how Apple handled having to restrain users. I was scrolling quite quickly and reached an arbitrary date in 1970. I then gave it a good hard scroll downward and reached mid-summer in 1968. My phone then crashed graphically and after about a second it shut down. It tried to boot up again and is now in a reboot loop. It displays the apple logo for about 15 minutes and then the screen turns off and starts all over again. \nI've tried twice with Apple chat and haven't reached a resolution yet. I am now about to be redirected to a senior technician but I don't know how much they'll help. I've already tried to \"soft\" reset by holding the power and home buttons. It just starts over again. I've also tried to use the iTunes restore functionality. When it is about to finish restoring, the final stage of \"verifying firmware\" comes up and freezes everything. My phone then starts the reboot loop again as if nothing happened. \nMy iTunes is on the latest version (12.3.1) This is an iPhone 6 16GB and I am running iTunes on a Mac. \nIf you know how to help me please help as I have been trying to resolve this for hours.\nEdit: I ended up having to go to the Apple Store because my phone was still under warranty. They accepted it but clearly seemed as though they were not knowledgeable that such issue could occur.  \n\nA: You can't restore out of this problem, even with DFU restore. A bug with 64-bit devices renders them ‘bricked’ if you set the date to 1970-1-1.\nTake your device to an Apple Store for them to reseat the battery, or you can try reseating the battery yourself. You could also put it in a drawer and eventually the battery will drain to a point where the date setting is lost and it should then power up properly. At this point, don't charge it and seek hardware service if you can't wait out this situation.\nThe bug is discussed on /r/apple: Changing Time & Date settings to Jan 1, 1970 will permanently brick 64-bit iOS devices\n\nA: You can get an extra restore option by holding option key and mousing over the iPhone in iTunes.\nBut then you also need a backup.ipsw file - or download a stock ipsw file.\nThis could work.. :)\nLike so: How can I restore my device with simply ipsw file and iTunes?\n", "Q: New iPhone 6s lost the new photos after synching to iTunes (restore old back up of iPhone 5s) I have new iPhone 6s with lots of holiday photos.

I disabled icloud, so theres no back up in icloud too.\nIs there anyway to recover my lost photos?\n\nA: Whichever you chose, you should have done it the minute you got the new phone, then the transition would have been seamless. \nThere's now no way to recover the intermediate data, unless it it was also backed up on iCloud.\n", "Q: Two external keyboards of the same type have different mappings I use the Logitech K750 on my MBP at work and also bought the keyboard for myself to work at home with the same laptop (German PC layout!).\nThe problem is that one of the keyboards will always have the ^ and < keys swapped:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo rm /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist to reset the mapping\n\n*Plug in the K750 at work, select mapping: everything works fine\n\n*Come home, plug in K750, select mapping: ^ and < keys are swapped.\n\n*sudo rm /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist to reset the mapping\n\n*Plug in K750 again, select mapping: everything is fine\n\n*Come to work, plug in K750, select mapping: ^ and < keys are swapped.\n\n*Start from 1.\nThe behavior is super annoying and I can't get my head wrapped around what is causing the issue because it's the exact same keyboard-type.\nWhat is wrong with my keyboards?\n\nA: I'm not familiar with what you are trying, but I've had success with Karabiner for device-specific remaps, it's a little complicated to use but they have a manual on their site\n", "Q: iOS app for exporting HomeKit data? I have bought an Elgato Eve HomeKit-compliant weather sensor. It works well enough but unfortunately its accompanying app does not support data export. \nFrom what I understand about Apple HomeKit, other apps should be capable of accessing HomeKit data that is stored on the same device (as e.g. from the weather sensor), if I permit them to do so. \nSo is there a (perhaps generic) iOS app that would allow me to see all HomeKit data stored on my iPhone and to export it (e.g. send CSV file by e-mail, or similar).\nUPDATE In terms of Apple's HomeKit framework temperatures seem accessible as HMCharacteristics e.g. of type HMCharacteristicTypeCurrentTemperature inside an HMService of type HMServiceTypeThermostat. I have not found yet whether the HomeKit framework natively supports the notion of historic data (e.g. past temperatures). Apple's HMCatalog sample app indicates that the specific device also maintains a number of private characteristics, some of which could (perhaps) be related to historic data. Alternatively it could also be that all temperatures arrive in Elegato Eve's app as notifications and that hence historic data is only supported on the level of this app.\n\nA: I've been able to solve this as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*use iTunes to sync from iOS to Mac to create unencrypted iPhone backup\n\n*obtain and start iPhone Backup Extractor for OS X\n\n*select latest backup, then Expert Mode, then Application Domains, then com.elgato.eve, Documents, Elgato Systems##EveWeather##*sql (* stands for what looks like a device serial number) and extract SQL file to ~/Desktop/\n\n*sqlite3 ~/Desktop/Application\\ Domains/com.elgato.eve/Documents/Elgato Systems##EveWeather##*sql reveals that the database contains 3 tables, one for humidity, temperature, and air pressure each\n\n*export tables e.g. to CSV files, then import e.g. into Excel\n\n", "Q: Is Transmit Power Control technology implemented in iPads? Transmit Power Control (TPC) is a mechanism used by Wi-Fi emitters to lower signal power in order to reduce interference with other wireless networks (and, in mobile devices, save battery).\nIs this algorithm implemented in any model of iPad?\n\nA: This is a Broadcom question, and not an Apple question.  However, I wanted to provide some basic info on how the \"low power mode\" of the WLAN chip and iOS.\nLowering the transmit power is handled by the wireless chip, not by Apple itself.  For example, in the iPhone5 it uses the Broadcom BCM5334 chip which is capable of low power consumption (40-50% less than the previous generation) and \"dramatically reduced standby power by 3 orders of magnitude.\"\nLooking at the specs of the BCM4334, we find that it has \"Programmable dynamic power management\"  Going into the details we find that it the BCM4334 WLAN power states are described as follows:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Active mode — All WLAN blocks in the BCM4334 are powered up and fully functional with active carrier sensing and frame transmission\n  and receiving. All required regulators are enabled and put in the most\n  efficient mode based on the load current. Clock speeds are dynamically\n  adjusted by the PMU sequencer.\n  \n*Doze mode — The radio, analog domains, and most of the linear regulators are powered down. The rest of the BCM4334 remains powered\n  up in an IDLE state. All main clocks (PLL, crystal oscillator or TCXO)\n  are shut down to reduce active power to the minimum. The 32.768 kHz\n  LPO clock is available only for the PMU sequencer. This condition is\n  necessary to allow the PMU sequencer to wake up the chip and\n  transition to Active mode. In Doze mode, the primary power consumed is\n  due to leakage current. \n  \n*Deep-sleep mode — Most of the chip including both analog and digital domains and most of the regulators are powered off. Logic states in\n  the digital core are saved and preserved into a retention memory in\n  the always-ON domain before the digital core is powered off. Upon a\n  wake-up event triggered by the PMU timers, an external interrupt or a\n  host resume through the HSIC or SDIO bus, logic states in the digital\n  core are restored to their pre-deep-sleep settings to avoid lengthy HW\n  reinitialization.\n  \n*Power-down mode — The BCM4334 is effectively powered off by shutting down all internal regulators. The chip is brought out of this mode by\n  external logic re-enabling the internal regulators.\n  \n\nThe algorithm that is used to lower power consumption/output will be specific to Broadcom and unrelated to Apple.  iOS only puts the chip into power one of the power states; it doesn't manage the power states.\nNow, for the main question...\n\nIs Transmit Power Control implemented in iPads?\n\nIf it uses this chip (iPad3), then YES.\n\nThe BCM4334 also supports Transmit Power Control on the STA together\n  with standard Bluetooth TPC to limit mutual interference and receiver\n  desensitization. Preemption mechanisms are utilized to prevent AP\n  transmissions from colliding with Bluetooth frames. Improved channel\n  classification techniques have been implemented in Bluetooth for\n  faster and more accurate detection and elimination of interferers\n  (including non-WLAN 2.4 GHz interference).\n\n", "Q: Changing Support URL in iTunesConnect Is it possible to change the Support URL for an App at any given time, even during App Review or after it has been approved without having to upload a new version or binary?\nI saw this link, iTunes Connect App Properties, it says Editable: Unlocked for Support Url, not sure what that means though.  But I would assume it means I can change the Support URL at any given time.\n\nA: Yes, you can change accompanying details of your app while waiting for review and after the review is complete.\nApple's documentation mentions the following, emphasis mine:\n\niTunes Connect App Properties\n...\nMany of the properties in the following sections are either locked or unlocked. Unlocked properties are always editable. Locked properties are only editable when your app is in an editable state. The tables in this section indicate whether a property is locked or unlocked. Changes you make to unlocked properties are posted immediately, but expect 24 hours for a full refresh of the change on the store.\n\nAnecdotal stories suggest Apple do keep an eye on any changes you make but, as of now, no additional review is required.\nFields will be disabled and marked as Locked, if they can no longer be edited. Locked fields are deemed associated with a specific binary.\n", "Q: Any nice, stable ways to keep a window 'Always on top' on the Mac?

My device too is on 8 and it will be upgraded to 9.1 directly. \n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: iPhone 6 & iOS 9 - ad hoc app will not install I'm having problems installing our developed app (distributed via ad-hoc) to iOS9.\nThe ipa installs and works fine on iPhone 4 and on iPad 2 (iOS 9.1) but nothing seems to work for iPhone 6 with iOS 9.1.\n\n\n*\n\n*I've tried to install it with iTunes - install stops at ~60-75% and app icons turns grey, then tapping it just says waiting under the icon and nothing else.\n\n*Tried to download ipa file from website via safari - safari says it can't download this kind of file.\n\n*Re-build and archived, selected distribute using ad-hoc and installing via iTune. Nothing happens - app icon won't even appear in iPhone and iTunes says installing next to app, sync icon in iPhone disappears after a second. The same ipa works fine on iPhone 4 & iPad 2.\n\n\niPhone 6 & iPad 2, iOS version: 9.1 (13B143)\niPhone 4, iOS version: 7.1.2 (11D257)\nNothing shows up in device logs (xCode - Window - devices - device logs). I tried to restart between the installs to ensure nothing was cached. Tried to hard reset (?, on/off button + home button). I'm at the end of my wits, nothing seems to work and I it won't tell me why it doesn't work.\n\nA: I've been working with this problem the whole day now and I've cleared few things up. First, ad-hoc deployment method is not what I'm actually looking for, in my case correct method is enterprise deployment. I'll get back to it later.\nI think my problem was in provisioning profiles, because when I added iPhone 6 to devices list (in apple developer center) and included it in provisioning profile, the app installs just fine. Although, when I disabled iPad from devices list it still worked, weird.\nI needed to distribute the app outside of the App Store but I wasn't really sure what deployment method to use. Now I think I finally made some sense in them. \nAd-hoc deployment\n\n\n*\n\n*meant to use for testing and in-house apps\n\n*distributed outside the app store\n\n*devices on which the app is used must be added to devices list in apple developer center and selected in provisioning profile\n\n*maximum of 100 devices \n\n\nEnterprise deployment\n\n\n*\n\n*meant for in-house, private apps (eg. intranet)\n\n*distributed outside the app store\n\n*unlimited devices\n\n\nDifference between them is that ad-hoc is available for everyone while enterprise is only available to developer or team which is under enterprise account. Enterprise should be registered by the company which will be using the private app (eg. intranet app) and add developer (or agency) under it. This way they don't depend on each other and can keep finances separate. \nI'm sure I've still misunderstood something, so if you find any incorrect information here, please do tell.\n", "Q: pkgbuild created package does not install correctly Have now used pkgbuild/productbuild to create a product archive, consisting of three packages (application, uninstaller, KEXT), that according to installer installs fine, no errors.\nThe KEXT is correctly placed in /Library/Extensions and postinstall script loads it nicely.\nBut my applications are not moved to the /Applications/Company/ folder. The folder is created, but the applications are not placed there.\nThe process of doing the component plist + distribution XML is so utterly simple so I just cannot fathom what the h*ll can go wrong ?\nThe package can be \"installed\" via Pacifist, albeit then the postinstall script is not executed.\nHelp?\nUpdate:\nAnalyze phase (application resides in ./pkgbuild/app_path/ folder):\npkgbuild --analyze --root \"./pkgbuild/app_path/\" app.plist\n\nBuild phase:\npkgbuild --root \"./pkgbuild/app_path/\" \\\n         --component-plist ./app.plist \\\n         --install-location \"/Applications/Company/\" \\\n         --identifier \"com.company.myapp.pkg\" \\\n         --version \"1.0\" \\\n         app.pkg\n\nThen the product archive, step 1:\nproductbuild --synthesize --package app.pkg distribution.xml\n\ndistribution.xml is then modified with correct background image, license, etc.\nStep 2:\nproductbuild --distribution ./distribution.xml output.pkg\n\n(I omitted the KEXT package as that works perfectly)\nWhen installing \"output.pkg\", folder /Applications/Company/ is created but is empty.\nSOLVED (see Grahams answer below):\nBy setting BundleIsRelocatable in the component plist files to false, the applications are put into the correct place. \nViewing the installer log, the application got \"relocated\" to where my Xcode project built the app, but still create the /Application/Company folder. A \"slightly\" peculiar behaviour I would say.\nOSX version is 10.11.1.\n\nA: Moved Applications\nThe Installer is likely updating the first copy of the application it finds and not the application in the default install location.\nThis behaviour is deliberate and allows users to move applications, while retaining the ability to use Installer packages to apply updates.\nAs a developer you probably have numerous copies of the target application on your Mac. It is likely the last copy you – or Xcode – launched is the one being updated. This can include copies within hidden build folders.\nEnforce the Location with BundleIsRelocatable\nSetting BundleIsRelocatable flag to false forces Installer.app to use the exact path provided by the package.\nWithout this flag set, the Installer.app will search the target Mac for matching applications and write the new copy to the discovered location.\n\n\n*\n\n*Try your installer with a clean Mac with a fresh copy of OS X.\n\n*Look closely at the log output from Installer.app or installer; you will see entries regarding the search and final location of the relocated application.\n\n\nReport the Bug\nThat the Installer still created the parent company folder does feel like an error. Please report a bug with Apple.\n", "Q: How do I make my Mac use .bash_profile to add extra paths after I statically set $PATH? I, like an idiot, decided to export PATH=/usr/local/sbin/.\nAfter some googling I was informed that one should use a .bash_profile file in the root directory of your user which you can use to append paths to the initial $PATH . However the .bash_profile file did not exist prior to me creating one so I'm unsure how to prompt my Mac to actually use this file as part of it's PATH configuration. Every site I've visited simply tells you to make edits to said file but does not explain how to get the OS to use it.\nHow do I get my Mac to read from .bash_profile to add custom paths? \n\nA: The bash shell actually defaults to look for ~/.bash_profile even though it may not initially exist.\nAfter creating this file in the root directory of your user, just enter source ~/.bash_profile . This forces the bash shell to read immediately from the file and will run it's contents straight away.\nAs long as you have a line that looks like export PATH=<directories> in the file, your PATH will be set by this every time.\nThis helped.\n\nA: Try:\ncd ~\necho 'export PATH=\"$PATH:(insert other path here)\"' > .bash_profile\n\nor\ncd ~\ntouch .bash_profile\nnano .bash_profile\n\nThis file is read automatically.\n", "Q: Why does iPhone Music app show me \"Apple Music\" logo instead of my iTunes songs? I synced all of the music in my iTunes Library to my iPhone (like it was an iPod).\nI've been listening to the music in my Jeep for weeks by plugging into the USB port and choosing songs and playlists from the in-car radio's touchscreen.  (So I know the music is on the iPhone.)\nToday, I want to listen to my music with headphones.  Thought I'd try Siri ... I told Siri to \"Play Accept Yourself by The Smiths\", and sure enough she played it!  (I thought it was pretty cool that worked, actually.)\nWhen the song ended, I thought I'd chose something manually.\nOn the iPhone I touched the \"Music\" app/button on the home screen, it took me to a photo of a girl wearing headphones and the \"Apple Music\" logo.\nNo lists of songs, no other options.\nI went to the \"Settings\" app, and selected \"Music\" and I noticed that \"Show Apple Music\" was switched to ON.  So I turned it OFF.\nWent back to the \"Music\" app, and there's still nothing but the photo of the girl and the \"Apple Music\" logo.\nWhat am I doing wrong?  How can I see the songs that are my iPhone?\nThanks!\n\nA: I've learned more ... I may have an answer to my question.\nAccording to this article here ... when I told Siri to \"Play Accept Yourself by The Smiths\", she may have played that from Apple Music, not from my own library.\nThat would explain why \"Apple Music\" got turned on.\nBut I don't know why this would happen because I did not renew my Apple Music subscription after the trial last summer.\nAfter ensuring the \"Show Apple Music\" setting was OFF, I powered off my iPhone.  Restarted, and it looks like I'm back to \"iPod\" mode in Music.\n\nA: I have this problem also from time to time.\nWhat solves it for me is to either wait until that screen with the person wearing headphones finishes loading (it will try to sell Apple Music to you) and dismiss it or just close the app and reopen it a bunch of times.\nIf neither of those works, try restarting your iPhone and trying them again.\n\nA: I had the same issue and i found a work around in a simple way.\n\n\n*\n\n*Close the music app and force close from the phone memory.\n\n*Put your phone in Airplane mode.\n\n*Open the music app.\n\n*When it opens, click on Songs with the cursor sign down\n\n*Choose last option, only downloaded music.\n\n*Close music app from home button.\n\n*Remove the airplane mode from the phone.\n\n*Reopen the music app, now it works fine, no more the Music Apple Logo.\n\n\nThis is how I made it work on my iPhone.\n\nA: I had the same problem. There should be two buttons below the girl. One is to show Apple Music and one to go to your song library. Those two buttons disappeared in my case and somehow they appeared again. \nYou might need to do nothing other than wait it out.\n", "Q: iWork and iLife are not free after reinstall I recently bought a Macbook Pro 13\" Early-2015 from a guy who used it only once and then reinstalled it for selling (already upgraded to the latest El-Capitan).\nAfter I set up my Apple ID I couldn't download the iLife & iWork apps for free, they all cost money..\nI have them all free on my iPhone though.\nWhat are the necessary steps to be able to download them for free? I know it should be on every Mac after 2013. The one I bought is 2015.\nThe Macbook was purchased in an official Apple Store in the United States, I have the receipt.\nThanks!\n\nA: You can download the iWork '09 and iLife '11 trials and install them.

Now there are multiple copies of several files wherein they are labeled 'example_1', 'example_2', 'example_3' and so on.\nIs there any way to differentiate between these copies and the originals so that I can delete the extras and free the space they're taking up without damaging my computer's functionality?\nI'm fairly certain some of the copied files are possibly data files and other necessary items.\nHere is a screenshot of what I am describing:\n\n\nA: Firstly, a better way to make backups would be to use Time Machine. This will maintain a backup that can be restored, as it was backed up.\nSimply copying files to another disk is a fine backup method, but copying files from All My Files will copy them \"out of context\". All My Files is a sort of \"smart folder\" that dynamically displays documents from your Mac or iCloud Drive. This view can be useful for your viewing & access. But this view of those files does not show any folder hierarchy for where those files are actually stored.\nI notice that one such file that you've copied is __init__.py, which is a special file for the Python language. I'm guessing it originally was located in a folder for, perhaps, a cloned GitHub repository? Copying this file to a \"backup\" is fine, but for it to be useful, it needs to be kept with the other files/folders it was with.\nOne of the most important elements of making backups is that the backed up data can later be restored in a usable state, as it was originally arranged. This is why I'm recommending making backups with a tool, such as Time Machine. Or, if you'd rather backing up a smaller set of things from your computer, for limited space available on your backup media, you should not make those backups from a dynamic view such as All My Files. But instead, make backups of the literal folders of things you'd like not to loose.\n\nNow, as far as all those duplicates, in certain situations of copying files, Mac OS will increment a number \"at the end of the filename\". So, for the example of __init__.py, the duplicates all are named __init__NN.py. (The files with additional/incremented numbers at the end, before any last .name are extra copies.)\n\nA: The files disappeared because they were disk images instead of actual files.  I now simply backup my actual Documents, et cetera, folders instead.\n", "Q: Iphone videos for Court I have some iphone videos that my atty has told me I need to put on or in something that can be handed to a judge for a civil matter. I originally was just gonna email them or put them on a flash drive but he said that isn't sufficient for court. \nPictures and documents I'm printing & putting in a binder... the videos I'm a bit stumped stumped for ideas. The best I've been able to think of is getting a cheap old laptop (with a decent battery so it doesn't die in court) and put the videos on the desktop of the laptop to be played/replayed on a decent sized screen as needed. Any other ideas? I feel like there has to be a better way but maybe my mind wants technology to be better then it is at the moment. I don't want to get so fancy that judge or whomever has trouble figuring out how to play the videos - just want it simple as possible. \nI have enough work/personal stuff on my own devices I don't want to just handover what I already own loaded up with personal stuff not related to the matter. \nMy attorney is not tech savy, he doesn't email or text, only does phone calls so he has no advice on how. \n\nA: Burn the videos to DVD, so they can be played in a regular DVD player. Also hand over all data files on a USB drive.\n", "Q: El Capitan - Weather search in Spotlight not working I've just upgraded my Mac to OS X El Capitan and typed:\nweather in Sao Paulo, BR\nI got nothing. \nI'm actually in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Any ideas?\n\nA: From testing on my Mac, I can confirm that weather in Sao Paulo, BR doesn't actually show the weather, whereas weather in Sao Paulo, or weather in Sao Paulo, Brazil does. Whether or not the ã is used doesn't affect the result: \n\nIf these inputs don't return the natural language search results, then check on the OS X Feature Availability page. You may need to reconfigure your Language & Region settings in System Preferences in order to use the feature, until it's supported for your current Language and Region settings.\nIf neither of these methods provide solutions, you may want to try disabling and reenabling Spotlight Suggestions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences & navigate to Spotlight\n\n\n\n*Ensure that Spotlight Suggestions is checked; if it's already checked, uncheck spotlight suggestions, then recheck it.

Clicking the update button results in the App Store somewhat ignoring the action where it seems to try updating for about 0.1 seconds (there's no way it can detect a real network failure that quickly), and then reverts back to the button as though nothing were pressed.\nRepeatedly pressing the update button eventually results in the update going through, where it finishes without any issue (once it finally makes a real attempt to download it)\nNo other apps show any signs of having network issues and all other devices work fine on the WiFi network.\nAuto-updates have been failing for a long time as well, not sure if related. \"Unable to download software update\" messages frequently pop-up randomly while I'm doing other things.\n\nA: Not sure what caused the issue, but it was finally resolved by using \"Reset Network Settings\", which seems to do some kind of deep purge that requires rebooting the device (with a progress bar for some type of process that runs).\n\nA: You could try updating to the newly released iOS 9.2, as it fixes a bunch of bugs.\n", "Q: Click app in dock to show open instances Coming from a windows machine here. Is there any way that when you click on an app in the dock that is running, it would show the open instances? For example if I have multiple chrome browsers open. \nCurrently, you have to right click on an app item and that pulls up a menu with a very hard to read list. Is there some way to show larger information? Or show all the instances of the app?\nMaybe this would require some custom dock plugin? Not sure.\n\nA: While generally most applications allow only for one instance of an application to be running, I believe that you mean the multiple windows open for an application.\nBy default OS X does not show icon or window previews on the Dock.  However, there are two options for allowing to see the windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mission Control (built-in)\nMission Control gives you the overview on the entire screen with all open application windows grouped together, but there is also an integrated function, called \"Application Windows\", which just shows you all the windows open for the currently active (foreground application).  You can assign keyboard shortcuts and and trackpad gestures inside System Preferences. Additionally, if you prefer to use the mouse for this feature, you can drag the Mission Control application into the Dock for you to click on.\n\n*3rd party application (e.g. HyperDock)\nThere are some 3rd party applications, which mimic the Aero window preview of Windows 7.  The one I used to have was called HyperDock, which looks almost like the real thing, but there are others as well.\n\n\nA: Apple provides the Mission Control visualization and it's not designed to work in even the slightest manner similar to the windows task bar.\nIf you prefer the task bar, you will want to look for third party window manager and task bar software providers - there are always several good solid ones and some up and coming ones.\nAlso - check out fluid app - it's really nice for web apps to make them feel more like a real app as opposed to just another tab or window in your browser. It's not for everyone, but those that like it - absolutely love it in general.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://fluidapp.com\n", "Q: Is it safe to disable System Integrity Protection? While using OS X El Capitan 10.11.x, is it safe to disable System Integrity Protection? There are all these additional apps that modify folders and the dock that I want to install but you have to disable rootless first.\nGood idea or bad idea? \n\nA: If you disable SIP you'll get the same level of protection as you had with OS X versions before El Capitan. Whether this is enough for your needs it something only you can decide.\nOTOH it's not that much trouble to disable SIP briefly to chance a protected part of the system. If you want to be on the safe side, disconnect from any networks while you do this.\n\nA: I felt like it had a negative impact on the battery life of my macbook pro(around 300 cycle counts but not more than 300).After I disabled SIP, I was hardly getting five hours of battery. Few days ago, I enabled it, and it's back to normal. \nAbout the safety issue of the core system file :If you know what you're doing, you should be fine. The following link should help you more about the SIP. http://www.imore.com/el-capitan-system-integrity-protection-helps-keep-malware-away\n\nA: It is not safe to disable SIP. It is there to keep external apps from modifying system files, and once it has been disabled nothing short of a reinstall of the whole OS from external media can rectify this.\nOnce system files have been modified, even once, an attacker could have corrupted and infected your whole system, and turning it back on will not change this, as the damage has been done.\nTo be fair, Windows essentially allows the same thing every time you click yes to install any program(grants admin access to all files), but this doesn't make it more ok. That being said, I have installed dozens of programs from the internet on Windows and I have been (as far as I know) fine.\nSIP is essentially a level of privilege above sudo. If you need to disable it, do so, but don't fool yourself: it is not secure.\n", "Q: Keychain: Beachball When Visualizing Password I can use the passwords in the keychain when opening a program, but if I try to display the password in the keychain entry I get asked for the root password.

My phone has told me that my data/storage is hitting the limit. My question is what exactly makes up this data/storage? Is it the notes I keep on it? Saved texts?\nI've seen the categories and how much room they take up including photos, audio/music, apps and data. Do I just need to go in and delete stuff to make more room?\n\nA: Yes, to view the current storage being used, you can navigate to Settings > General > Storage & iCloud Usage > Manage Storage.    From here, you can see which apps are taking up a lot of space, how much space your photos / music are taking up, etc.\nOnce you know what's taking up all your space, you can delete things as needed.\nAlso, note that in older versions of iOS (depending on which you are currently on), space taken up by Messages was not shown here.   \n\nA: I'm a little confused on what you mean by \"data/storage\", but here's what both of those terms mean:\nCellular data is anything that you do online when not connected to a Wi-Fi network---app downloads, video streaming (Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, etc.), browsing the web, anything you do over your cellular network.\nStorage is anything actually stored on your iPhone---photos, apps, documents, music, movies, TV shows, text message conversations, etc.\n", "Q: Temporarily disconnect from home Wi-Fi?

When they ran the test, they didn't find a problem either and then told me that they would not do the repair.\nWhen I showed them the photos that I had taken when the graphic glitches occurred, they said that that was enough evidence and then they repaired the MBP.\nDid you show the pictures/videos of the problem to Apple? If you did, I would either go to an Apple Authorized Service Provider and see if they agree to do the repair or go back to Apple and try escalate the problem.

I recently moved my iTunes music library onto a new computer set-up by copying the \"iTunes Media\" folder onto an external HD and then onto my local disk. When I opened iTunes for the first time, it loaded the cover art for all of my iTunes-purchased content but it displayed the cloud icons for all my music, indicating that it was available to stream but not available offline, and it did not display the music I've imported from CD's at all.\nI assumed that my transfer didn't work, so I started downloading my high-priority purchased content again. Well, yesterday I actually went into my \"iTunes Media\" and \"Music\" folders, and all of the audio files are there. The high-priority content that I've downloaded again has all duplicated, and the content exists but is not duplicated.\nNow I want to clear the duplicate files. I also want to either display the imported and the low priority purchased content in my iTunes library or delete it from my local disk (haven't decided which yet). I'm guessing that some or all of this can be automated with Applescript or Automator, but I've never used either of those before and I need some help. Which tasks can I automate, and what's the best way to learn these utilities if I've done some programming before?\n\nA: Doug's AppleScripts for iTunes have helped me a great deal. Try Dupin for cleaning those duplicate files. There's also a lite version.\nYou can learn a lot about AppleScript by opening scripts by others in script editor so you understand what's happening. Apple also has a comprehensive guide about the language, if you want to read all about it. \n\nA: iTunes menu->View->Show duplicate items\n\nA: Thanks for weighing in folks.\nTweaked around with Applescript, but at the end of the day I was going to spend more time futzing with it than it would take to manually organize the files to my standards.

I recommend that you install Xcode and Xcode command line tools from the App Store. That will give you the GCC compiler (and probably LLVM as well).\nWithout knowing your build process, I can't tell you how to set a default compiler. There will be an option in Xcode as well as options with command-line build tools. In other words, Macs do not have a system-wide default compiler setting that I'm aware of.\nHere's the official documentation on how to use a different compiler with CMake:\nHow do I use a different compiler?\n\nA: You can just open Terminal and type in gcc. If GCC is already installed on your Mac then it will show as \"no input files\".\nIf you don't have GCC installed then you will get a dialogue box saying you to download and install GCC and its respective command-line tools. This method is preferred, because installing Xcode from the App Store will take you time and as well as consumes your data (4.7 GB).\nSince you need only GCC, this is better because it even saves you disk space by installing you only GCC files.\n", "Q: How can I create bash_profile and bashrc OS X 10.11.2 El Capitan\nI want to create some alias, so I go to ~/ folder and there is no .bash_profile or .bashrc.\n\nI have been looking for some info and I learn that .bash_profile is only read when bash launch an interactive login shell (default type of terminal in OS X) and .bashrc is only read when bash launch an interactive non-login shell. But I don't find how to create .bash_profile and .bashrc for my user. How can I do it?\nAfter @klanomath answer:\n\n\nA: Open Terminal and enter:\ntouch ~/.bash_profile\ntouch ~/.bashrc\n\nTo edit the file(s) use:\nnano ~/.bash_profile\nnano ~/.bashrc\n\nInstead of nano you can use any decent text editor (e.g. BBEdit, TextWrangler).\nTo immediately enable any changes in the file .bash_profile use source:\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n\n", "Q: Offline music not showing up after iOS 9.2 upgrade After upgrading my iPhone to iOS 9.2 today, the songs in the Apple Music library don't show up as saved offline. Playlists show as offline.\nI went to Settings->General->Storage and the Music app is using the same amount of storage as before (i.e. the music's still on the phone). But when I click on 'Music' in Storage, the Settings app freezes and doesn't recover even after minutes.\nWhat are my options?\n(I can of course redownload the library, but several gigabytes of my storage is already gone)\n\nA: My wife had a very similar problem, ever since upgrading to 9.0.

It's been like that since I downloaded iOS 9.2 \n\nA: I had the same problem. This is how I solved it:\nSettings>Music\nTurn off \"Show Apple Music\"\nThen go back to iTunes. The picture with a girl will now have text underneath. One of the lines is \"go back to my music\"\nTap on that sentence.

I participated in the beta version of El Capitan I think last year. When the public release version came out I installed it and didn't discover that I was still using the Beta version until a month ago. I can't seem to find a way to do so. Apple tech support wants to charge me ridiculous $'s to help me with no guarantees. Can anyone send me to a site or tech paper or direct help to help get rid of the beta? I am unable to update from the app store. I am using a MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2012).

Since a few weeks ago I am observing a strange phenomenon: all disks show roughly 10GB more free space than they really have.\nE.g. I plug a USB drive in that has 32 GB. Finder shows me 42 GB.\nOther example: Finder shows that I have 11GB free. I pull a 2 GB file to the Finder and get the message: not enough disk space.\nWhat could be the reason?\n\nA: I tried out the usual Apple voodoo things (PRAM reset etc), and one behaved strange: when I started the Macbook with pressed Shift-key (safe start), it took very, very long. Usually this takes like 5 minutes, this time it took more than 40 Minutes (huh!).\nAfter that I just restarted again and everything was fine. So it looks like safe start fixed the problem\n\nA: Probably a corruption in one of the system caches (that are emptied when starting in Safe Mode).\n", "Q: Full screen problem Whenever I use a full screen app, it first blacks out my other monitors and then whenever I click on another monitor it closes the full screen app and goes to windowed mode.\nI would like it to just go fullscreen without my other monitors going black and I would like to be able to click on things on my other monitor without it closing the full screen.\nI am running the latest version of El Capitan.\nThanks in advance :)\n\nA: The only way to prevent this is to have \"Displays have separate Spaces\" checked in System Prefs > Mission Control\n\nThis then requires that you have at least one more Space than you have monitors, or it has 'nowhere to go'\nIt has downsides…   \n\n\n*\n\n*that either Space can then be on either screen, so you lose the ability to spread your work over 2 monitors  \n\n*that the Dock & menu bar can be on either screen\n\n\nPersonally, I don't think Apple quite thought through how Spaces & full-screen work if you have more than one monitor, the end result being that either setup is a compromise.\nMy own solution is to never use full-screen & also not use 'separate Spaces'\n", "Q: Comma in 1000 separate in Excel app does not work Even i check the box \"use 1000 separate (,)\" but nothing is shown in the number.

This, using the same account.\nI'm looking for a solution to manage access to my computer. For someone who has physical access to my computer (like myself and a couple of my friends who will use it every once in a while), I would like to have simple and short password that keeps complete strangers out. However, I would like to have another complex password for the SSH server, because the SSH server will be available from the public internet from time to time and having a simple password would be to much of a security risk. \nI have looked into passwordless authentication using ssh keys, but that's not what I'm looking for, because I want to be able to ssh into my computer from any device. (And as far as I understand, my computer should have a list of trusted ssh-keys.)\nSo ideally, I want to have a simple password to unlock my computer with physical access and a complex password to connect over ssh.\n\nA: I think the real solution is to create a non-admin account which can be accessed via ssh (presumably the account you want to use via physical access will have sudo privileges). The ssh account should not really have anything or be able to do anything other than let a user log in. You can then sufrom that user to the actual account you want to use, which will give you an additional layer of security and better logging regarding who is accessing the system (or trying to)\n\nA: Not exactly what you describe, but it should solve your problems. The tool is called \"single packet authorization\" and very nice implementation with description is fwknop.\nIf you have computer with IP accessible from the internet, it is really common to see many authentication tries on SSH and it is really handy to protect the service somehow. Hiding is a good approach. Fwknop will basically allow you to unlock the ssh port for specific address from your mobile phone (for example) and then you can connect using your relatively simple password without exposing it to the world.\n\nIf it is way too complicated you can always set up two users:\n\n\n*\n\n*local:\n\n\n*\n\n*with simple password\n\n*denied to log in remotely\n\n\n*remote:\n\n\n*\n\n*complex password\n\n*allowed remote login using AllowUsers option in sshd_config\nand set up sudo transition from the remote to the local (either automatically or manually) to get into the same \"context\" as with your local logins.\n", "Q: Deprecated “natd” and “ipfw” in El Capitan I want to share my internet connection and VPN connection but Tunnelblick/OpenVPN doesn’t play nice with internet connection sharing in OS X. \nThere was a suggestion on a workaround on how to route all traffic over VPN as per this post: Using (and sharing) a VPN connection on your Mac\nThe script is:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nnatd -interface tun0\nipfw -f flush\nipfw add divert natd ip from any to any via tun0\nipfw add pass all from any to any\nsysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1\n\nI am not a UNIX expert – so I am just wondering if anyone can help me with the alternative for the above deprecated commands please?\n\nA: I figured it and it seems sharing VPN connection in El Capitan is so much easier than it seems.\nIn Preferences -> Network click on + and add a VPN (PPTP or L2TP)\nIn Preferences -> Sharing \n\n\n*\n\n*Select (do not check yet), from the Share your connection from choose VPN connection previously created.\n\n*From To computers using select Wi-Fi if you connect your computer to internet with Ethernet cable or select Ethernet if you connect your computer to internet with Wi-Fi.\n\n*You can change Wi-Fi Options from bottom left button.\n\n*Now Check the Internet Sharing from the left menu, and click Start \n\n*Every time you connect the VPN a network will be created and lets you connect to it with any device and use the VPN on you Mac.\n\n", "Q: Smb share - can't connect to local smb share from el capitan I have set up a samba share on my local network using a raspberry pi. I can mount the share from my Linux machine and ios devices (using Fileshare), but can't from my new macbook pro running el capitan. I use cmd+k in finder and type in the user credentials, but get an error message (in danish) saying something along the lines of 'there was a problem connecting to the server'. I have tried changing smb:// to cifs://. I get the dialogbox with the user credentials, but it now shakes, as if my password is wrong. It even gets more weird - I am able to use ssh from the terminal with no problems... \nDoes anyone know what's going on? And what to do?\n\nA: If you are familiar with connecting via Linux via /etc/fstab, then you know there are a lot of possibilities of what could go wrong simply because there are SO many different options for connecting to different types of network shares, and it seems like every OS handles these options differently.\nI have encountered issues similar to this before, and in my cases, it was always either an issue with ownership/permissions and/or the specific mount point (or a combination of the two):\nFor instance, I have a ZFS pool setup using FreeNAS, and the mount point is set to //x.x.x.x/share, and the login credentials are supposed to be for a specific user.  I have no trouble connecting to it in Windows, but the only way I can connect to it in OS X is to connect directly to the IP using the root credentials.  I know there is a way to fix it, but I haven't gotten around to looking into it yet.\nSo my first advice would be to try connecting directly to smb://x.x.x.x or smb://x.x.x.x/share, or any other variations that you can think of, using various sets of credentials that have access to that box.\nIt could also be a Samba version issue (which Samba is notorious for) that could be causing these 2 guys to not agree with each other.\nAlso, sometimes in OS X if I am trying to mount a share with one of the various mount commands in Terminal, I find that it tends to give me trouble sometimes if mounting with my normal user, so in certain circumstances, I need to use sudo in order to mount it as root.\nIf all else fails, I would try installing the Netatalk packages on your Raspberry Pi.  Netatalk is an open source version of the Apple Filesharing Protocol (AFP), which OS X obviously tends to handle much better than Samba (SMB).  If you enable the share to also use AFP, you can connect to it from Finder using afp://x.x.x.x/share, etc.\nIf you are running Raspbian, those packages should be available via apt-get.  I hope this helps!\n", "Q: deleting a large group of photos in photos (like from a game cam) I am trying to delete about 1000 photos taken on a game camera and transferred to Photos.  .

Right now the only difference I can see is the cost and time needed for shipping, but I'm more interested in knowing if there are long term benefits of one over the other technically wise in terms of speed/durability/other.\nHow can I determine the better SSD - not the cheapest?\n\nA: While I'm a big fan of OWC normally, I would go with the Transcend Jetdrive 725. That's what I just ordered for my Mid-2012 Macbook Pro Retina.\nThe main reason I did not go with the OWC Auro drive is I've had a couple of friends who've upgrade their systems to the OWC Auro drive have problems. While they were both happy at first, at least one of them had their OWC Aura drive, for a Mid-2012 Macbook Pro Retina, die after 6 months of use. The other friend complained about their Macbook Air running hotter after the upgrade (not sure if they screwed up their upgrade) and having drive issues as a result. There are also other stories floating around the web about the OWC Auro drives failing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_sK0336Hto.\nThe Transcend Jetdrive 725 comes with a 5 year warranty for the same price as the OWC Auro, which only has a 3 year warranty. The OWC Auro Pro version does have a 5 year warranty, but is more expensive than the Transcend at that point.\nPlus, the Transcend 725 drive now has TRIM support under the latest Mac OS (thanks to Apple). On the other hand, OWC recommend that you DON'T enable TRIM support with their drives.\n\n\"In fact, enabling TRIM could actually hurt the performance and reliability of your OWC SSD, rather than help it.\"\n\nI hope this helps in your decision making process.\n\nA: I know this is an old thread, but I'm sure there are many people like me looking to increase their MacBook Pro storage.\nI bought my mid-2015 Retina MacBook Pro with 512 GB storage.  This wasn't enough for me, and in December 2016 I purchased an OWC Auro 1TB SSD drive.  Installation was a breeze, and at first I didn't really notice any issues with it.\nAfter a few months though, my MBP fans started getting really loud, due to the SSD overheating.  Even if there was no heavy graphics or gaming or processing load, my keyboard ran super hot, and fans full speed most of the time.\nTo test this, I switched back to the factory SSD, and even with more processing power being used, the fans stayed totally silent.\nSwitched back to the OWC Aura, but after a couple of months (right before the 1-year mark), the drive gave up on me and wouldn't boot anymore.  A local Mac technician saved me by using diskwarrior to repair my disk, back up my files, and swap back to the factory drive.\nI contacted OWC, and they replaced the drive (had to send it back to them first, because it was past the 30-day return mark).  \nNow, fast forward 6-7 months, and I had the same issues last week.  Graceful shutdown one evening, next morning come to boot up, and I get the dreaded folder-with-a-question-mark icon, with my Mac not even seeing the SSD drive.\nBack to the Mac technician, after some troubleshooting (drive wouldn't boot when in an external enclosure, but did end up booting when put inside another MacBook), was able to run an extra backup, and I'm back at the 512GB factory SSD, with no overheating issues, and much faster performance.\nI'm about to contact OWC again, but I can't get a refund, and I'm not interested in trying the Aura again, it's just too much of a hassle.\nI might give Transcend Jetdrive a try, but still skeptical, and don't know if it's worth the drop in performance (read/write speeds with the factory original are SO much faster).\nOne mac expert friend of mine recommended I try a m.2 to PCI-E adapter with a Samsung Evo 960, so I might try that.\n\nA: I have a 2012 13\" MacBook Air and upgraded the SSD to a 1TB one from Transcend, and had random problems including crashes. I switched to an OWC 1TB drive, and never a hint of a problem. And the Transcend drive works fine in an external bootable mirror backup drive, connected via USB 3.0.\nI also have an early-2015 MacBook Pro Retina. The Apple SSD died out of warranty (a not uncommon problem among my colleagues) so I replaced it with a Transcend drive, but its SMART status is indicating multiple uncorrectable writes. Therefore I'm going to switch to a 1TB OWC Aura Pro drive. I think that the problem is that the Transcend drives overheat in real-world service, and Transcend haven't designed for that. Stick them in an external enclosure and they're fine.\n\nA: For what it's worth, I'm having problems with OWC Aura Pro drives in my mid-2011 Macbook Air 13.  I bought the 512gb model in March 2016. It worked until last December, when it failed.  OWC sent a replacement promptly.  This past weekend, that drive failed.  I have now sent it back to OWC for examination.  My guess is that they will send me a warranty replacement.  I am planning to buy a Transcend drive or just get a new machine.  Having hard drive failures every few months is not acceptable. \n\nA: A long while ago I installed an SSD in a tower PC that has a tendency to run hot. The SSD quickly failed. So did the the replacement, supposedly heat-proof SSD.\nI’ve got the same model MacBook Pro as you. It runs so hot, I used to set it up on my desk with the lid closed and hooked up to an external monitor, so it’d act like a radiator and warm my hands in the winter.\nThose experiences puts me off trying to replace its drive with a new, non-Apple drive.\nFor want extra storage, I’d got an external USB3 hard drive. There are some really compact and durable models available now. \nOr you could just get a hard drive enclosure and a separate HDD: have the HDD from an old MacBook Air in one, as a permanent backup of it.\n", "Q: What is the best free option for automatic ftp sync with finder? I was quite happy when I found out that Finder had native support, but it didn't take long until I realized it was read-only access. \nWhat is the best free option for automatic ftp sync with finder? I am using El Capitan. I'm not interested in very much functionality, just the ability to edit files.\n\nA: TextWrangler\nYou can use BareBones' Text Wranger. It is a free texteditor with onboard ftp capability. TextWrangler is BBEdit's little brother, and BBEdit is one of the best text editors. I use this text editor at least since Mac OS 7.6 And, just like BBEdit, TextWrangler does not suck.\n\n\nA: FileZilla, but beware of the adware in the installer, as its hosted on SourceForge. CyberDuck, in the App Store, is another good option; both support editing and syncing back to the server.\n", "Q: cannot see photo clearly from ipod touch library locally I have an ipod touch and ios 9.1.

Are there ways besides iCloud or using a computer with iTunes to back up data on your iPhone or iPad?\nOne way seems to be a USB flash drive with a lightning connector... But is that just for photos and not other data like internet bookmarks, notes, etc.?\n\nA: I'd say… No. \nThe backup structure would require some kind of 'smart' object at the other end.\nYou cannot just connect a storage medium & push data to it.

I'm a Windows user who has to use a Mac for my job. My biggest frustration with the Mac is that I can't switch between multiple instances of multiple program easily. I have to keep a little bit of every window visible at all times so I can click on it to switch to that window.\nIs there a way to easily switch between multiple instances of multiple programs on a Mac? On Windows, every instance of every program is in the taskbar, so I can just click on that instance to switch to that instance. I can also alt-tab to switch between windows easily.\n\nA: There are easier ways to switch windows/apps than using the Dock. Most native, is  by using the Mission Control. You can activate Mission Control several ways, on laptops it's usually F3 (without the Fn key), from Trackpad/Keyboard (check preferences) then select which app and window you want. You can also group windows by app: Mission Control > check \"Group windows by application.\" Use two-finger scroll to zoom-in on specific app when grouped. \nCouple useful shortcuts:\n\n\n*\n\n*⌘+Tab: Switch between apps, use w/ Shift(⇧) to go in other directions.\n\n*⌘+`: Switch between windows of current app, use w/ Shift(⇧) to go in other directions.\n\n\nCheck out Keyboard Preference Pane for other shortcuts, or customise any.\nYou should use spaces, if you already aren't, this will help you sort out apps and create a better workflow.\nEDIT: I forgot to answer your big question. To have multiple icons for each window, though it's not recommended; it'll mess up the mission controls and confuse you, you'd have to do it through Terminal:\nopen -n -a Google\\ Chrome; -n for new instance, -a specifies the name of app. You can also supply files after that so it'll open those files with the default or app supplied. Do man open to read more about it. \n\nA: Apple has very intentionally designed against the idiom of having a task bar.\nI would try enabling three finger swipe down (a.k.a. App Exposé) which lets the standard have Mission Control interface show you only the windows of the application or experiment with making specific browser windows full screen or set up several virtual desktops to segment your work.\nSince there is no general way to enable this on OS X, you can look for lots of third party solutions to add a task bar functionality to the OS. I've always preferred the Mac way, but there are times when windows has a better workflow even for me - so I get your point and wish to not have to change the way you feel is best for you to work.\nSince I don't have a silver bullet - if your windows are web browsers, you could get an app like fluid to make each web site look like a separate app, but you're still working in the dock / mission control / multiple window idiom and not the windows task bar idiom - so that might be like the proverbial \"putting lipstick on a chicken\"\n\nA: Ok I'm a bit late for this, but in case anyone comes up with the same issue here's the solution:\nRight click on the Dock, select \"Dock Preferences\", and from there, uncheck the box that says \"Minimize windows over the icon of the application\". That will make that every instance of an app have its dedicated icon on the right side of the Dock (to the left of the Trash App icon). You can even click and drag each instance to reorder it at will.\n\n\n", "Q: MacBook Air 2015 Shuts Down in Boot Camp Randomly My MacBook Air (2015) randomly shuts down (like, the power just cuts off) in Boot Camp. This doesn't happen if I have the charger plugged in. \nWhile I vaguely recall it happening once or twice in OSX, I feel like it's a Boot Camp exclusive battery problem or something. Running Windows 10, so maybe the battery is overheating, cause Windows just makes the fan run louder, but I'm not sure.\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: The quick answer is that when a battery starts to fail (due to age or just failure), the voltage can fluctuate to the point where the system cannot log an error or go to sleep. Since you have some evidence that this happens on battery alone, you'll need to collect enough data to prove that hypothesis or replace the battery and see if it helps.\nYou might also ask a pointed/specific question on out partner site superuser.com to ask if your specific version of windows can log low voltage errors or how to diagnose a sudden shutdown cause from the windows side of things.\nI have diagnosed these things and ruled out other causes on the OS X side, but I cannot begin to advise you on how to read the windows logs and nothing that I know of is saved to Apple's NVRAM if windows crashes while it's running - but I could be proven wrong on that point by someone with that knowledge if they decide to weigh in :-)\n", "Q: Does a new computer require a new Time Machine drive? If I buy a new iMac to replace an old iMac do I need a new or different HD for Time Machine?\n\nA: No - you don't need to get a new drive, but it's always nice to consider getting a new drive for reliability reasons. At some point, retire the old drive to the shelf or delete it and repurpose it. The backup should ideally be more reliable than the source in terms of longevity. Even an unreliable drive can be useful though since it will protect you from user errors and is unlikely to fail at the same time as the primary source if you are primarily concerned about having two copies of the current data.\n\nOne Time Machine drive can serve to hold files from many computers. Similarly, one computer can back up to multiple Time Machine drives.\nIn the case where you migrate data from one Mac to another, the system will usually detect this and offer to \"migrate\" the one time series of backups so that you get two benefits:\n\n\n*\n\n*You don't lose the space savings where each file is only saved when it changes - saving space when a dozen backup intervals contain the same file version.\n\n*You don't lose history and have to wait for all the files to back up.\n\n", "Q: Fullscreen app unusable due to focus loss i am quite new to the OSX system and having some issues with ElCaptain. \nBasically a fullscreen application (Android Studio in my case) loses the focus and i have to kill it via the task manager in order to get it up and working again.\nTo reproduce it i just have to open Android Studio. Then open the Genymotion Device manager and then the desktop switches to my main desktop (where non-fullscreen apps are placed). If i switch back to Android Studio again, the input focus is still on the Genymotion windows which is placed in the background. In this case i cannot bring the genymotion window back to foreground again and Android Studio does not accept any input anymore.\nIs there any hotkey combination or other trick to get that window back again? I can see a subwindow \"Genymotion*\" if i \"right\"click on Android Studio, but its greyed out and i cannot switch to it this way.\nAny tips?\n\nA: You could use a combination of App Expose (4 finger swipe down) and Mission Control ( 4 finger swipe up or F3) to view all possible app windows. Make sure you have these setting enabled.\n\n", "Q: Mac App Store Upload Fail: Validation Error (SFML) I'm working on a SFML App in Xcode 7.2, and I'm trying to upload my project build to the Mac App Store, and I'm getting the following error:\n\nAn error occurred during validation\nCouldn't find platform family in Info.plist CFBundleSupportedPlatforms or Mach-O LC_VERSION_MIN for A\n\nI've tried, among other things, adding a new entry to my Info.plist for CFBundleSupportedPlatforms with an entry for OSX. I've tried changing dylibs vs frameworks, i've tried universal vs standard architectures. All of these modifications have yeilded no success.\nThis question is following a previous problem with freetype that I fixed. Is it possibly still a problem with freetype? any suggestions?\nUPDATE:\nOK, I've gone through and reset up a whole new project following the App Distribution Guide. I Did see some issues with some of my build settings, and fixed them. But I'm Still getting the same error. Does anyone have a clue what I'm doing wrong?\n\nA: I fixed it! \nThe problem was that I had only edited my project-info.plist. I went and added the same lines for CFBundleSupportedPlatforms to the info.plist's for each of my external frameworks.\n\n\n*\n\n*CFBundleSupportedPlatforms => array,\n\n*item0 => MacOSX\n\n\nSeems to have done the trick.\n", "Q: How to move my Photos library to internal drive to use iCloud Optimize space feature I recently finally imported my photo library into Photos from iPhoto. I have my library stored on an external drive since my internal 256gb has been full for awhile. \nNow that it's in Photos, I went ahead and upgraded for a couple of bucks to the 200gb iCloud drive so I can upload all my photos into the cloud. I also checked the option to \"Optimize Mac Storage\" because I mainly just want the original high res options available via iCloud and I don't want the local library taking up much space.\nHowever, while the upload is still going on, I have no idea how to successfully migrate my Photos library onto my internal HD so the optimize Mac storage will do anything. There is enough room on the external drive where the library currently reside, so I doubt it will try and cut anything down. \nSince as far as I know you can't set a target size, any ideas on how I can get it to compress my 100GB library into something closer to 40-50GB so that I can attempt to fit it on my internal drive?\n\nA: Once your album shows as fully synced with iCloud, simply quit Photos, disconnect your external drive, run Photos, and tell it to create a new Photos Library on your internal drive. Photos will download all thumbnails and the high res versions of images you view regularly.\n", "Q: Can I run a program with ≥ 512mb of VRAM required? I have a MacBook pro 13-inch, mid 2010. I recently installed 8GB of RAM. I understand that the NVIDIA that is installed (NVIDIA GeForce 320M 256 MB) uses shared graphics memory. Does this means that the memory that is shared with the graphics card increases the total amount of VRAM? Could I run a program with a VRAM requirement of 512MB or maybe even 1GB?\n\nA: The NVIDIA GeForce 320M 256 MB doesn't contain any dedicated VRAM. Instead a maximum of 256 MB of your 8 GB RAM are used as VRAM (shared memory).\nI doubt that you can run apps which require 512 MB or more VRAM. You may try to lower the VRAM requirements of the application though - depending on whether this possible at all. Anyway, it will run incredibly slow then.\n", "Q: How does OS X detect a PowerPC application? I use an application called Anki for learning foreign languages and professional terminology.\nThis app creates a default folder in /Users/user/Documents/Anki, which I did not want.\nYou can circumvent this by calling the app from the CLI with the -b option. Because of that, I went into the app bundle and looked for executable in Anki.app/Contents/MacOs/, which is simply called Anki.\nI renamed this file to Anki2 and made a new executable called Anki, which simply reads:\n/Applications/Anki.app/Contents/MacOS/Anki2 -b /Users/henrikgiesel/Library/Application\\ Support/Anki  \n\nAnd I can open the App bundle perfectly fine!... Until the next reboot, then it will complain:\nYou can’t open the application “Anki.app” because PowerPC applications are no longer supported.\nWhy is this? How does OS X detect PowerPC application? Would it work if I wrote a C-file doing basically the same and putting the compiled version in the place of the Shell script?\nEDIT:\nI can still open it from the CLI like this:\n/Applications/Anki.app/Contents/MacOS/Anki\n\nBut not like this\nopen /Applications/Anki.app\n\n\nA: Try wrapping the shell script as an app using Platypus. I've packaged multiple perl and bash scripts using the program, all appear as simple applications, with an icon of your choice, none have ever been misidentified as PPC apps.\n", "Q: Mark Email \"Unread\" from Email full view I have been switched to iPhone (iPhone 6s with iOS 9.2) from Android a few days ago.

Also speed is lower on the MacBook.\nSometimes things are so bad that I cannot establish a connection to remote hosts and things go in timeout (e.g. http, Skype, and other protocols and ports).\nI've read elsewhere that it's recommended to change the frequency which the router operates from 2.4 GHz to 5 GHz. However this is not an option for me as I don't control the network infrastructure of the places where I use the MacBook.\nAre there any other fixes for this issue? If not, do you think I can ask Apple for a refund as they clearly are incompetent dealing with this?\nUpdate:\nSee result of pinging google.com, from the screenshot it's possible to see how initially the ping time seems normal but then it went up or even goes in timeout from the exact moment when I switched on the Magic Mouse\n\n\nA: install 10.11.2 update and see if that helps.\n", "Q: How to backup live photo as 6s feature in dropbox or other I found that live photo is not backup on dropbox or google photo\ncan live photo (on 6s feature);only backup on icloud?\n\nA: The iOS app Photo Sync can auto-upload Live Photos to your Dropbox Account and as an option delete those after successful upload.\nThe live photo will be – as usual with all these work-around solutions – split into two parts, a „YYYY-MM-DD hh.mm.ss.jpg“ and a „YYYY-MM-DD hh.mm.ss.mov“. (The naming scheme can be freely adjusted to your needs.)\nAnother seamless option is Google Photos. Works absolutely clean and straightforward.

When initially setting up the Boot Camp installation I set this partition to be quite large but now I wish to utilise more of that space in the Macintosh HD volume.\nI've booted into Windows and used Disk Management to shrink that volume, so there's now just over 200GB of unallocated space on the drive.\nI now wish to 'incorporate' this unallocated space into the Macintosh HD volume, but Disk Utility (the GUI version) doesn't allow it.\nI've also tried\nTerminal > diskutil resizeVolume disk0s2 0\nI used 0 because diskutil tells me \"A size of zero will cause a grow fit-to-fill.\" However, this command responds with \"Volume format does not support resizing\" and while that response might be very clear to someone else, I'm not sure what it's telling me. Is it because the unallocated space was previously formatted as NTFS?\nAm I doing this the wrong way? Do I just need to tweak my Terminal command? What is the correct way to extend my current Macintosh HD volume into that unallocated space?\n\nA: Change partition size only with Bootcamp Assistant.\n", "Q: Folder icons missing on Desktop all of the sudden my folder icons disappeared on OS X Yosemite.\nIt looks like this:\n\nThese are all folders, they are not missing their icon in finder tho, only in the primary  view.\n\nA: First of all a quick reboot might fix your problems. If that does not work, you could try relaunching finder.  Apple icon → Force Quit → Finder → Relaunch. If that does not work you could try deleting the Icon Cache. Go to Terminal, which you can just search for, or go to Applications → Utilities → Terminal. Paste exactly these commands in one at a time. \nsudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.dock.iconcache -exec rm {} \\;\n\nsudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.iconservices -exec rm -rf {} \\;\n\nsudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store\n\nDo note that when you put in a sudo command, you must put in your password once. The characters do not appear when typing them, so don't worry. \nIf this does not work, you should do a complete restore of the Mac. Look up tutorials online, but make sure to do a backup of your Mac with Time Machine or a cloud based service.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Perhaps a relaunch of Finder helps: Apple menu → Force Quit → Finder\n", "Q: airportd keeps crashing I'm running a Macbook Pro retina 13 inches early 2015 with 16 Go of RAM and a 3,1 GHz intel core i7 on OS X El Captain 10.11.1\nI keep having some problems with airportd that crashes really often.

I know that there are many threads about resetting/retrieving an admin password, but bear with me please and I'll explain why they don't work for me. \nI recently moved in to a property only to find that the previous tenant had left behind a mid 2007 iMac - great, right!? No. The iMac works... as a CPU. The screen has been smashed up and has only a faint light emitting from the lower left corner so I have had to resort to buying a Mini DVI to VGA (which works perfectly as I'm currently on it on a guest account). This is where it gets a bit more complicated though. I wish to reset the iMac, but cannot without using the UIs accessed through reboot - when I access these (CMD+R, CMD+S, etc.) the external display isn't recognised so I go completely blind as to what is happening. I have read a few threads that say resetting an iMac is complicated, so I have thought about just creating myself a new administrator account, deleting the old one and all of the files with it - but without the old admin password, I can't do that - again, all threads resort to UIs accessed via reboot which I can't VISIBLY access... \nSo how can I reset the admin password without a working screen?\n\nA: Simply create a new admin account by reinitiating the OS X Setup Assistant: \nBoot to Single User Mode by holding ⌘S on startup with the external display attached.\nWait a few minutes and then enter (\"blindly\"):\nmount -uw /\n\nwait a second or two and then enter:\nrm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\nreboot\n\nIn Single User Mode the US-en keyboard layout is used.

Now after SMC I've got the exact same range as before changing the thermal paste :/\n\nA: I'm unable to answer / resolve the OP query, but I wanted to share my similar experience. I've had a very similar experience in that I had a MBP 2011 15\" GPU failure about 18mths ago, which resulted in the Main Logic Board (MLB) being replaced earlier this year. Since then I upgraded the OS to El Capitan - and the MBP heated up faster and hotter than it did prior to the GPU failure, and the fans didn't audibly start up as much or as loudly as they did before the GPU failure/ MLB replacement. The OP's temperature stats & data were similar enough to mine to not warrant posting my own (plus i can't remember that level of detail! I then began experiencing similar GPU related symptoms (lines across the the screen etc) and I took the MBP to my local Apple Store, who replaced the MLB immediatley... since then I havent experienced the same high temperatures, however I still can't hear the fans kick-in when it does get hot...or somehow the new MLB replacement has somehow qietened the fans (although I can't see how this is actually possible). I've reported this to Apple Support, however there isnt a resoltion... arguably as there isn't a problem as such. I'm probably being over-concerned.\nBefore this model went vintage, I would recommend you contact Apple Support and get it booked into a Genius Bar asap alongwith a set of actions that can be carried out at the bar to replicate the high temperatures. Now that Apple likely won’t repair it, people are going to have a harder time to tell if the extra heat is normal since the GPU generates more heat when it runs than just the CPU alone which was the case when the GPU was off or in a failed state.\n\nA: if you have old back up, try to do fresh reinstallation after deleting everything including recovery partition from old back up, i suspect it is OS changes where it is triggering temperature of graphics card by giving some commands to put more load. it could be intentional or bug.\nhere is my experience, my screen turning black and dizzy after heat, i started complaining is apple nothing happens as my laptop was out of care pack. i started complaining on twitter, before this my fan was running crazy for doing similar things, after a month of regular complain daily two screenshots, quite strange that my fan automatically stops sound and laptop started working amazing cool like there was never heating issue.\ni stopped posting on twitter and 2 weeks problem returened. i know it is difficult to believe but it really happened.

Plus to make the machine more useable, I attached a 256 GB Thunderbolt SSD and created a FusionDrive, as per this blog (in german). There are lots of howtos explaining how to create a FusionDrive. This really gave the machine an incredible performance boost.\n", "Q: How do I edit keyboard shortcuts in Nano? Is there a way to edit the keyboard shortcuts in Nano?\nI would like to change Move to next word from Right (Ctrl + Space) and Left (Alt + Space),\nto Alt + ← or →.\nAccording to this thread on AskUbuntu, one should be able to edit /etc/nanorc. However, on my OS X computer, that file is empty except for this line: \nset nowrap\n\nAssuming that this is the only file there is, how could I override the keyboard settings here?\n\nA: If you install a more up-to-date version of nano, it has improved keyboard navigation. In nano 2.7, the move word shortcut is ctrl+left/right. So you might not even need to do keybindings if you are satisfied with ctrl instead of alt.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install homebrew: https://brew.sh/\n\n*Install nano: brew install nano\nIf you really want alt, then keep reading.\n\n\n*\n\n*If using Mac Terminal, you will need to enable the Use Option as Meta key setting. Otherwise the alt key won't work.\n\n*/etc/nanorc might be ignored, depending on the flags when your nano was compiled. You can use ~/.nanorc instead, that will work for sure.\n\n*Add these lines to ~/.nanorc. (It seems that nanorc does not allow left/right arrows for keybindings, so I chose , and . since they are the same keys as < and >.\nbind M-, prevword main\nbind M-. nextword main\n\nNow alt+, and alt+. will move to prev/next words.\nYou can find the full list of commands here: https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/v2.7/nanorc.5.html#REBINDING%20KEYS . (You may want to find the exact version of your nano if not v2.7).\n\nA: You can find a description of commands/settings allowed in /etc/nanorc by running man nanorc.\nOS X 10.11-10.15 uses nano 2.0.6 which doesn't seem to support key rebindings.\nHowever if you install Homebrew you can easily install a modern version of Nano with:\n# brew install nano\n... wait for install ...\n\n# /usr/bin/nano --version\nGNU nano version 2.0.6 (compiled 17:24:29, Jun  5 2020)\n\n# /usr/local/bin/nano --version\nGNU nano, version 5.3\n\n", "Q: Migrate speech profile I've been speaking into my Mac for the last couple of years.\nI'm starting a fresh OSX.\nIf I understand correctly, the speech recognition improves over time.\nIs it possible to migrate my old profile, so it doesn't have to learn from scratch?\n\nA: Assuming - and that's a big if - that your speech profile is user specific you could still try migrating but only migrating your home folder (e.g. via Time Machine or from Mac to Mac) instead of the full system.\n", "Q: Windows vs OS X temperature, Windows runs hotter I could see about 10 degrees celsius less when idle in OS X, compared to Windows 8.1, that's ~49 °C compared to ~38 °C.\nI've seen that, according to Macs fan control, the fan is shut down in idle, but after googling, some people say macbook should always keep fan running at around 1200 rpm. \nShould I leave it as is or would it be safer to use a custom fan management to keep it running at 1200 rpm?\nSpecs: MacBook Pro Retina 13\" 2015\n\nA: I would not recommend changing you fan-speed management if you are not sure about it. 38°C - 49°C won't harm your macbook.\n", "Q: Nested IF statement in Numbers I am working on a table to tabulate mileage costs for my small business.

This used to happen on my previous install of El Capitan but stopped when I did a clean reinstall. Now the exact problem is happening again.\nThis seems to happen mostly when I am running in clamshell mode, connected to an external display while using my Magic Mouse. But this doesn't seem to be the issue since it resolved itself when I reinstalled.\nI installed the Microsoft Office 2016 suite, Live Interior 3D Standard, Firefox, Skitch, and LaTeX recently. Could these be causing these issues? Is there any way to see \"recently installed daemons\" of some sort? New LaunchAgents, for example?\n\nA: In my opinion, you should clean your Magic Mouse and your desk (dust, hair, ...).\nI don't think it is software-related.\n\nA: To fix this, if it's connected to an external display and has a closed lid, open (wait few sec) and close the laptop lid.\nIt sometimes happens on my MBP, it is too connected to an external display. Disconnecting all USB and turning off Bluetooth didn't help, so it's not related to an external USB/BT device.\nMy guess is that OS X El Capitan has a bug related to external display causing this. Another symptom is that sometimes app's window position are moved off-screen without apparent reason. \nLooks like a bug in translation of screen coords with an external display connected.\n\nA: I had the same issue with my Macbook Pro. The trackpad is staying active even when laptop lid is closed.

The iTunes desktop application has a feature where you can listen to a 90-second sample, or preview, of a song before purchasing it. However I can't find this feature on my iPhone. I'm looking in the \"Music\" app on iOS 9.2. Is there a different place that I should be looking? Is the feature hiding behind some sort of touch gesture that I just don't know about?\n\nA: That would be part of the iTunes app that comes bundled (pre-installed) on your iPhone. \n\nA: It was answered above perhaps, but the answer also applies to IPad. Do not open the Music App and hope to listen to music samples, like the old days. When you attempt to search for a song and try to play it in the Music app, you will get an annoying and repetitive \"Join Apple Music\" pop up panel, where you will be invited to get the 3 months free offer. Get out of Apple Music App completely.\nFirst go to IOS Settings, scroll down to music and switch \"Show Apple Music\" to off. Then go to the iTunes Store App (not iTunes), and on the bottom, click the music icon, bottom, left side. Then you'll be able to do a search, click on the song/album title you want to hear, and listen to snippets, like the old, much better Apple Music set up. They over-paid $3 billion to Dre and Iovine for Beats Music and to recoup their investment, they try to push people into signing up. They don't have help info or docs in IOS/iMusic to clarify this misleading and confusing new protocol, which is purposeful.\nDesktop Apple set up is different, but IOS/iMusic is now a sales funnel for Apple Music sign ups. That's why you'll have a difficult time trying to get info from Apple help pages or forums at Apple on simply how to play short samples. Sucks. \n\nA: As in iOS 11.2, you cannot view sample/preview song in Apple Music. You could however view them in iTunes store. \nBut it is cumbersome to switch to iTunes and search for the song you want to preview. There’s a way to fix this “automation”\nFirst download workflow. Then add an extension to open the URL. Go to Apple Music. Choose one album and click show full album. Force touch a song you didn’t purchase. Choose share and select run workflow. Choose the extension you just create. It should open the album in iTunes store automatically. \nHope this helps\n", "Q: Get notified by notification centre when someone ssh's into my computer? I know that if I open Terminal and I type inwho, it shows who is logged in and at what time, etc. However, I am not going to be at Terminal all day and keep typing who. So, I would like a notification that appears when someone logs into my computer, or in this case, when someone ssh's into my computer. Is there some way to do this in Applescript? Thanks for your help!\n\nA: Applications like Growl or GeekTool may be able to help you with this. Growl can send messages to the Notification Center or use its own notifications; when coupled with an external system application like Log Surfer, it may be able to provide the notification you seek.\nGeekTool would be much easier to setup, but doesn't send info to the Notification Center. Instead, you can have it display the output from a standard UNIX command on your desktop. In particular, you could have it display the output of a 'who' command, and update that every few seconds.\n", "Q: Can I upgrade the SSD on the Early 2015 13\" Macbook Pro? I do not want to go to Apple to upgrade the SSD on my macbook pro 12,1. Is there a third-party SSD that would work with my Macbook Pro? I currently have the 128GB model, and it is running out of space. I am looking to purchase either a 256GB or 512GB SSD that will run at comparable speeds to the current SSD. I know Apple has tried to stop users from upgrading to third party SSDs, I am more than comfortable upgrading these things by myself, but I just don't know if there is any compatibility. Thanks.\n\nA: Answer in 2020: A MacRumors forum post details the process of using an adapter along with a generic M.2 NVMe SSD drive to replace the OEM drive in certain Macbook models, and 2015 13'' Macbook Pro is one of them. The post argues that this method is much better than using OWC/Transcend drives due to price and quality. I have personally followed the guide and completed the replacement, and 3 months in everything works fine.\n\nA: Have a look here at MCE USA.\nThey offer SSD Blades for MacBook Pro Late 2013 - Early 2015 from 256GB up to 1TB.\nhttp://store.mcetech.com/mm/merchant.mvc?Store_Code=MTOS&Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=PCIEFLASH\nOWC/MacSales doesn't have any yet.\n\nA: It seems like OWC has finally managed to build replacement SSDs for the new macbook pro retina models, including the 13\" early 2015 model (480 gb model):\nhttp://www.owcshop.eu/catalog/product_info.php/aura-macbook-retina-mid2013-till-2015-480gb-preord-p-1380#.Vup7ExIrK-Y\nAnd a 1 TB model too:\nhttp://www.owcshop.eu/catalog/product_info.php/aura-macbook-retina-mid2013-till-2015-preorder-p-1378#.Vup7OhIrK-Y\n\nA: Your MacBook may be a bit too new to get an upgrade for, however THIS site provides SSD replacement drives for MacBooks made between 2008 - 2013, depending on the model.    \nYou might contact the company to see if your 2015 MacBook can use any of the drives they sell.\nAlso, these drives are very highly rated on Amazon.com, so I think you can feel safe that these are a realistic option.\n\nA: Transcend also has an SSD upgrade for this model.

Only a trip to Apple will resolve this.\nI had a similar issue with my similar MacBook Pro. The battery showed bad, and it would only run when plugged in. It turned out to be a problem with the charge indicator unit (the thing that shows 5 tiny lights). It had a bad chip, and it was not allowing the battery to charge. A quick swap of the part and my Macbook Pro was back to normal, showing a full battery.\nSend to Apple or go to the Apple store, as these kinds of things often show in very strange ways.\n\nA: Your battery is dead because of 6 months without exercise.\nCheck it if you want to be sure at an Apple Store.\nIf I was wrong, please bring back their analysis and kill my answer :).\n", "Q: Apple software upgrade crashes (heap corruption in msiexec.exe) on windows 10 bootcamp I have a mid-2012 15\" retina Macbook Pro, and I've been using bootcamp with windows 7/8/8.1 for years without any drama.

To verify that the update is correct, and that nothing more has accidentally changed, I would like to see the changes between the external and the local before performing the upload.\nTo perform the verification I need to download the file from the external site and perform a diff on the files.\nMy first thought was that there must be a easier way to do this, and that it might be that there are SFTP clients that integrate this \"under the hood\".\nAre there any SFTP clients for OS X that let you compare and see the differences between a local file and the file on the server before doing an upload.\n\nA: I use Transmit from Panic. It doesn't allow an actual file to file content comparison like a diff, but you can do a simulated sync to see which files will be replaced or deleted.\nIf you drag one file from window to window it asks you to verify and gives you the information on both files regarding modification dates and times.\nYou can try it before you buy it.

I would like to stream music from my Apple devices to my kitchen.\nI've got an old amplifier and passive speakers.\nI know that I can simply connect my airport express to the LAN or WiFi and to the ampli as line input, but I would like the ampli to turn on only when there is a line input signal, and then automatically turn off after an idle time, in a way similar to many Subwoofers.\nIn this way only the AirPort Express will be always powered.\nIs there a device or a simple way to do this job?  \n\nA: While in terms of the specificity of the desired implementation I agree with @patrix, you could get the desired solution if you're open to reframing how it all gets handled. I'd say the easiest (but somewhat costly) way to get the desired behavior is to get a Logitech Harmony remote.\nIf the amplifier pre-dates remote controls, you might need to think further outside the box and look into a wifi/BT-enabled power switch (plug the amplifier into said switch and have the hardware power toggle on the amp always set to \"On\"; give the signal to the power switch to let the power flow through it, the amp then remotely powers on).\nThings get very interesting in these days of \"Internet of Things\"… :-)\n", "Q: Hard link '~/Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs' to ~/iCloud Is it possible to do this at all?

It's the latter portion that I am interested in. What do I need to do in order to register my custom browser so that it can be set as the default?\nI'm guessing there is a .plist file somewhere for that?\n\nA: You don't add yourself to this plist—OS X manages this itself. For example, download a new browser and copy it to the Applications folder. Without opening it once, OS X will add it to the list in System Preferences.\nThis is achieved with the following in the Info.plist in the app:\n<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>\n<array>\n    <dict>\n        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>\n        <string>http URL</string>\n        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>http</string>\n        </array>\n    </dict>\n    <dict>\n        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>\n        <string>Secure http URL</string>\n        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>https</string>\n        </array>\n    </dict>\n</array>\n\n\nA: As of macOS 11 (Big Sur) it was not enough by adding the URL types to the Info.plist, it is also necessary to add the document types for HTML and XHTML.\n<key>CFBundleDocumentTypes</key>\n<array>\n    <dict>\n        <key>CFBundleTypeName</key>\n        <string>HTML document</string>\n        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>\n        <string>Viewer</string>\n        <key>LSItemContentTypes</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>public.html</string>\n        </array>\n    </dict>\n    <dict>\n        <key>CFBundleTypeName</key>\n        <string>XHTML document</string>\n        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>\n        <string>Viewer</string>\n        <key>LSItemContentTypes</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>public.xhtml</string>\n        </array>\n    </dict>\n</array>\n<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>\n<array>\n    <dict>\n        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>\n        <string>Web site URL</string>\n        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>\n        <array>\n            <string>http</string>\n            <string>https</string>\n        </array>\n    </dict>\n</array>\n\n", "Q: Is there \"danger\" in removing Macintosh HD from my Time Machine as a back up? I want to use Seagate Backup Plus Drive I'm a novice (obviously!), and my Seagate will not back up my computer because it says there is nothing to back-u since my Macintosh HD is in my \"Exclude these items from backups\" under \"Options\".  I'm having a little anxiety if I take it off the list -- that I will lose all that is on it.  Call me crazy.  I just need some confirmation since I do not put it on this list so I assume it should be there.\n\nA: None of the items in the \"Exclude these items from backups\" will be backed up. Usually only the backup volume (i.e. the Seagate Backup Plus Drive) itself is in the list.\nSo including Macintosh HD in the above list is counterproductive if you want to backup Macintosh HD.\n\nA: If you are worried about Time Machine and losing data here are two safe ways to change things.\n\n\n*\n\n*Only delete files when you enter the time machine interface - a small finder window, a blurred background and the list of time backup intervals on the right side of the screen running vertically from now (bottom) to the oldest backup (top). If you delete a file or a backup there, it prompts you for a password so you are sure to want it gone before it gets erased.\n\n*If you remove something from the Time Machine preference, that only removes an exclusion - so that means the next backup will copy more files to the external drive going forward. Basically the double negative means removing an exclusion includes more files. No actual data on the drive is deleted, no data on the backup destination is deleted - just the settings for the app change.\n\n", "Q: identity.apple.com/pushcert not loading I'm trying to renew my Apple Push Notification Service certificate per the 30 day notification email I received.

I opened Terminal on my MacBook Pro and the prompt reads:\nMacBook-2:~ myName$\n\nIs there something wrong? Do I need to be worried about this? Why -2? \n\nA: This is because there can't be two devices on the network with the same name. MacBook becomes MacBook-1, then MacBook-2.\nYou can check this with:\nscutil --get ComputerName\n\nThis could be because there are two other devices with the name MacBook, or because Bonjour hasn't forgotten that the device disconnected. It's nothing to worry about, and you can change the computer name from System Preferences → Sharing or use scutil to ask for a name change.\nscutil --set ComputerName MacBook\n\n", "Q: Change terminal color for each tab I work on a lot of tabs in terminal at a given time. Sometimes, I get tabs mixed up and accidently run commands on tabs I am not supposed to. \nTo simplify this, I wish to write some script, that on each new tab creation, comes with a random background color (not the text background, the window background), so that I can easily identify the tabs I was working with.\nAny suggestions ? \n\nA: The built-in default \"Solid Colors\" profile randomly selects a background color for each new terminal.\nIt works by setting the background image to a folder of images, each of which is a solid color. To choose different colors (or patterns, etc.) you can place a collection of images in a folder and set a profile to use the folder in\n\nPreferences > Profiles > [profile] > Text > Background > Image:\n\nAnother feature of profiles is that if you create a new terminal with Shell > New Command or New Remote Connection it will look for a profile with a matching name and select that profile. It will look for a match of the entire command string, a partial match of the command name and arguments starting from the left, and it will also try to interpret the profile name as a regular expression.\nThis means you can name a profile “ssh” to have it selected for any ssh command, or “ssh hostname” for ssh commands whose first argument matches hostname, for example.\n\nA: I would highly recommend using iTerm2\nI'm still finding cool new features. I don't know about a truly random background color, but I know you can change your settings based on user, host, file system location. Though, that feature may still be in beta. \nYes, that's still in beta:\n\nAutomatic Profile Switching\n  Using the Shell Integration feature, you can have iTerm2 switch profiles depending on what you're doing. For example, you can define a profile that's always used when you ssh to some hostname. Or when your username is root. Or even when you're in a particular directory.\n\n\nA: If you want permanent customization, look at the nice details here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/99453/118237\nFor temporarily change, all you need to do is right-click on the terminal tab, choose \"Inspect Tab\", and make change via Info or Settings tabs. \n\n\nBTW, this information is based on Terminal Version 2.7.3 (388.1.1).\n", "Q: How to type \"Full Width\" characters?

So what is the reason of this complaint? Is this linked to apple (Mac) or is it the Hard Disk, which is a LACIE disk? How can I overcome this problem, if possible, or raise the \"too large for the format\" threshold to at least 8GB, from the ~4GB it currently sits at?\nAnd have I chosen the appropriate SX for this, and if not, which SE would be more fit?\n\nA: I'm guessing that volume's format is FAT32 and you're trying to copy file bigger than 4GB. That's FAT32 limit. Check this for a reference.\nAs the first point of investigation, check what's the format of your partition. If it's FAT then that's the reason. Change it to exFAT, NTFS or native OSX.\nSo available free space has nothing to do here and can be misleading.\n", "Q: How can I rebind keyboard keys in OS X?

Look into Cordova and PhoneGap. There are similar alternatives for making apps for desktop operating systems as well.\nWhile they may be easier to develop depending on your existing skill set, they may not feel as fluid as native apps. While some developers do a great job making HTML5-based native apps or even hybrids, often times they feel non-native to the user.\nIf you have an existing mobile-friendly website that you want to package into a native app, you can probably make a basic app with a UIWebView that merely displays the website.

So I don't think the following problem occurs on that end of the connection:\nWhenever she connects her MBP to the projector with a HDMI cable, the MBP seems to detect it and changes its resolution. But the display on the wall stays black no matter which resolution I choose in the system preferences.\nHas anybody experienced something similar? Could it be a problem with the color profiles?\n\nA: Opposite of your thoughts that the problem lies at the Mac end, I'd personally search on the projector first.  If the supplied signal is somehow out of range, the projector should beam some feedback by showing an error on the wall.\nPerhaps you haven't selected the right source on the projector.  Does the projector handles a different HDMI source correctly?\nBeing such an expensive projector and all, connecting it to a (n old) Apple TV could do wonders.

When I restore my mac to the state it was in a week ago, I need to be sure that the Dropbox folders saved locally do not revert to their older versions, sync, and resave the whole folders as older versions.\nI see things online on Dropbox support about recovering previous versions of Dropbox files, but I want to avoid the problem up-front. Trying to solve by reverting could lead to messy problems with conflicted versions if a colleague is working while I revert.\n\nA: Dropbox support got back to me with this great response.\nIf you want to make permanent changes to your computer that do not sync back to the website you need to unlink the computer first.\nFollow these steps to unlink a computer:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the Dropbox icon in the menu bar at the top of your screen on Mac.\n\n*Click on the gear icon in the Notifications panel and select 'Preferences' > 'Account'\n\n*Click the 'Unlink' button\n\n*Afterward, Dropbox will prompt you to re-register. Quit!\n\n\nYou can now safely move or delete files in the Dropbox folder and not affect anything else.\nNote that the Dropbox folder itself is still there. If you relink to a different Dropbox account, the application will detect that another Dropbox folder already exists on the computer, and will give you two options: 'Choose Another Location' or 'Install'.\nIf you want your new Dropbox folder to be in a location different than your existing folder, click on 'Choose Another Location'.\nIf you want your new Dropbox folder to be in the same location as your existing one, click on 'Install'. This will rename the existing Dropbox folder to 'Dropbox (Old)' and will create a new Dropbox folder for the account you’re currently linking.\nThe above steps should give you the option to keep the files in an unlinked folder (Dropbox Old) or you can choose to delete that folder.\nYou may also want to unlink, delete the folder entirely, reinstall the Dropbox application and link the device. This will then create a new Dropbox folder and the functionality of the Dropbox application is limited to watching your Dropbox folder for changes and syncing any changes that occur across your connected devices, and will sync down your Dropbox account that shows on Dropbox.com to that device.\n", "Q: Disable \"space+shift\" in Sublime Text I want to disable the \"space+shift\" thing in Sublime Text, it creates something that looks exactly like a space unless marked, and it messes upp all my scripts because I always accidentally type it.

Since the appdef list already contains Sublime Text you can immediately add a new remapping.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download, install and open Karabiner\n\n*Open in the menulet Karabiner -> Preferences\n\n*Open the tab Misc & Uninstall\n\n*Hit the button Open private.xml\n\n*Open the file private.xml with an appropriate editor\n\n*Enter the customized keycode\nExample (ShiftSpace -> Space):\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n  <item>\n    <name>Enable at only SUBLIMETEXT</name>\n    <item>\n      <name>Shift+Space to Space</name>\n      <identifier>remap.app_sublime_shiftspace2space</identifier>\n      <only>SUBLIMETEXT</only>\n      <autogen>__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::SPACE, MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_SHIFT, KeyCode::SPACE</autogen>\n    </item>\n  </item>\n</root>\n\n\n*Save the file\n\n*Open in the menulet Karabiner -> Preferences the tab Change Key\n\n*Hit the ReloadXML button\n\n*Enable the Sublime Text remapping.

I know that the default search engine works for Safari because when I type in the search bar it searches with Bing.\nSearch results for this don't apply to iOS 9. The iPad is new and there are no extensions on any sort installed. No data has been transferred from a backup. The only third party apps installed so far are MS Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.\nHow can I make Siri search with Bing?\n\nA: Until today, there's no way to do this. Here's my findings:\nSiri doesn't perform search directly on baidu.com, it uses Siri's hideout [guzzoni.apple.com] to relay the request over (properly configured) TLS. \nOther than asking for Apple's mercy, I think it's more probable to trade Chinese iPhone with one from another country.\nBTW, the packets themselves are pretty fun to look at.\n", "Q: iPad Air 2 charger getting warm My charger has been fine until recently although I noticed it getting warmer.  Last night it wouldn't charge at all and this morning it was so hot I could just about touch it with bare hands. I couldnt get the iPad to start up and eventually noticed a message \"only use Apple charging devices as others may cause harm\" it was then that I began to use my MacBook Pro USB.\nThe iPad charges okay from my MacBook Pro USB, is this a common occurrence? I bought the iPad as a manufacturers refurbished and has been fine in every other way.\n\nA: It sounds like there may be a defect with either the charger or the iPad. I suggest taking it to an authorized Apple store so that they can run diagnostics on it, and potentially repair it. \n\nA: When something is painful to touch - I would always seek Apple service - remotely or in person if that is convenient.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://locate.apple.com\nThere are multiple safety mechanisms to prevent overheating and fire, but if there is one thing wrong - another thing could fail too and I would want to give Apple the change to fix things under warranty or exchange it if they feel it's a safety issue. \nIt's almost certainly the charger that's faulty - the iPad does draw a good amount of power so in a warm room, the charger can run hot and be fine, so it could be nothing at all too. Better safe and if you can borrow an infrared thermometer or use this as an excuse to spend $15-30 and buy one - it would be worthwhile to measure exactly what the case temperature is compared to ambient temperature. That would tell a lot more about whether it's within specifications or overheating.\n\nOnce you're sure the heat is normal, then you can look into the cable and maybe if there is lint covering a pin that's causing the \"incompatible / non-apple detection\" but that also seems to indicate a hardware issue somewhere along the chain.\n", "Q: Can a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) have their hard drives upgraded My friend has a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) -- she wants to install a magnetic 2.5\" HDD. Can I install any such drive or do they have to be apple compatible hardware.\n\nA: Not possible. There's not enough room for a spinning hard drive to be connected inside any retina portable MacBook. \nThat being said - hose drive would work well externally via thunderbolt or USB and internal non-OEM replacements are available. \nTo install special SSDs. other than Apple branded look for resellers and online like OWC or RamJet. \n", "Q: In my iPad settings there is an app called null what is it? When I go to settings on my iPad it shows an app called null what is this? What do I do about it? Is it bad or nothing to worry about?\n\nA: It's not obvious where this app came from. According to the answer to this question, it probably is an app that was incompletely synced with iTunes.\nThere's nothing to worry about, and you don't need to do anything about it.\n\nA: You can go to Settings-->General-->Storage&iCloud Usage-->Manage Storage. Then scroll down the apps to find null and delete it.\n\nA: Null doesn't mean anything bad, it just means your iPad thinks there is an app but it can't get all the information required to display it, or the information doesn't exist.\nIf you don't see this \"Null\" app anywhere else, it may just be leftover from either a incomplete sync, an app may of not been completely deleted, or a variety of other reasons.\nUsually a restart should fix it but if it doesn't it's nothing to worry about. If you know an app you recently uninstalled you may also want to try to reinstall and delete it again because it might be a leftover from a partially deleted app.\n\nA: I deleted this app and all of a sudden the 'delay' between me pressing the keyboard and the letters/numbers appearing on the screen disappeared.  Made me wonder if it was some kind of spyware...\n", "Q: Port 9000 apache returns access forbidden I am using native PHP and native Apache.

But I am able to access PHP websites using virtual hosts or from localhost URLs like this http://localhost/~subhojit/phpwebsite.\nI am not sure what I am doing wrong. Please help.\n\nA: To get vdebug (or any php debugger client) to work, you don't visit port 9000 in your browser. That's the port that vdebug and xdebug use to talk to each other. You just need to visit the URL as normal.\nThe process is this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start vdebug with F5 (default)\n\n*Visit the URL that you want to debug, but add the query parameter XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1 (e.g. http://localhost/~subhojit/phpwebsite?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1)\n\n*Go back to vim - a connection will have been made if both xdebug and vdebug were configured correctly\n\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: USB-Serial Controller doesn't appear in Network I'm running El Capitan (10.11.2) and have had all sorts of problems with my USB-Serial cable after upgrading to El Capitan. \nI have the latest drivers for my TrendNet TU-S9 USB-Serial Cable dated 11-10-2015. I've also tried getting the PL2303 drivers (dated 10-22-2015) from Prolific. \nI unplugged the cable, uninstalled the old drivers per the instructions, rebooted, installed the latest drivers, rebooted, and plugged in the cable. \nUnder System Information-USB, I do see USB-Serial Controller D in the list of USB Devices. In /dev, I do not see tty.usbserial. Also, I do not see USB-Serial Controller as a possible interface in Network within the System Preferences. I just see Bluetooth PAN, FireWire, Ethernet and WiFi as possibilities when I try to add a new interface. \nI've uninstalled and reinstalled several times and just can't get it to work. It is as if something is not letting the drivers be installed. I'd be grateful for any possible suggestions.\n\nA: The aptly-named mac-usb-serial.com should be able to help you. \nThe real issue is conflicting drivers. In my experience, sudo kextunload AppleUSBFTDI has worked on both OS X 10.10 and 10.11, if you want to skip the linked troubleshooting steps (you should not). \n", "Q: What must I enter into Terminal, using sudo to make myself an administrator? My user account is a standard account on my Mac. What must I enter into Terminal using sudo, to make myself the administrator?\n\nA: If the actual user < user_name > has a standard account, you would have to enter\nsudo dscl . -append /Groups/admin GroupMembership <user_name>\n\nto make < user_name > an admin.\nOnly a restricted number of users are sudoers (i.e. accounts which are allowed to run su or sudo with root privileges successfully) though. The standard sudoers file (/etc/sudoers) in OS X looks like this:\n...\n# User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL) ALL\n%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n# Uncomment to allow people in group wheel to run all commands\n# %wheel    ALL=(ALL) ALL\n...\n\nSo only root and members of the admin group are allowed to run sudo by default. The above command run by < user_name > will fail consequently, because  < user_name > isn't in the list.\nTo enable sudoing for < user_name >, you would have to add < user_name > to the list (below # User privilege specification) or uncomment the %wheel line with sudo visudo which has to be run by sudoers again (that's the Catch22 mentioned by Tetsujin).\n\nA: That's a bit of a Catch22…\nYou need to already be an administrator to be on the sudoers list [with very few manually-changed exceptions]\nEssentially, you cannot promote yourself.\nThat's the entire point of sudo & being an administrator, to be able to assign non-admins limited abilities.\n\nA: If you have access to an administrator account, you can become that account temporarily with:\nsu - <admin_username>\n\nFrom there you can perform administrative actions via sudo.\nIf you do not have access to an administrator account, then there is no \"sanctioned\" way of getting admin access (since that's the whole point to having separate admin roles), but there are plenty of less-than-legitimate ways of attaining it, such as privilege escalation exploits or booting into single-user mode. (These will be left as an exercise to the reader.)\n", "Q: forwarding SMS messages to email on Iphone 4 For the holidays I will be in a small town with no cell service. However my job requires that I respond to SMS messages day or night.

It feels like the \"hit zone\" for the resize handle on windows in Yosemite is about 4 pixels wide. Meaning when I want to resize something I end up hunting around for it for 3 or 4 seconds every time. Is there a way to change this activation zone? I'd rather not have to install a tool to fix it. \n\nA: Here's a GIF showing the border for resizing a window. It's not that small, but I don't think there's a way to change it.\n\n", "Q: Sharing an iCloud account I am setting up my parents with an Apple iPad.  I was wondering if I can configure it so that they share a single iCloud account for email, calendar, contacts, photo stream, FaceTime calls, etc.  Is there a better way than a shared iCloud account if I want them both to be able to use it and there is only 1 device?\nI do not think the IOS on an iPad natively supports multiple user accounts like Mac OS X.\n\nA: There is actually no other option (unless you want to do some more advanced stuff which probably shouldn't be done on a device you don't use yourself). There is one user (or more precisely one set of settings) on an iPad and you can configure one iCloud email/calendar etc account. You can have a separate account for iTunes and the App Store, but this is probably not what you are looking for.\nOTOH, you may want to look into iCloud email aliases to give both your mother and your father individual email addresses. See the answers on Is it possible to have 2 iCloud email accounts in IOS 5? for details.\n\nA: Not sure if this helps but you can create/link as a family, with one account as primary (perhaps you so can admin) then you get a shared calendar, shared photo cloud, and share app/music purchases (each can DL as wish).\nEmail can always be setup via IMAP for both to share independent of the above. Likewise you can always share cloud and calendars, but the family thing is cool bc then you can share purchases too.\n\nA: You can add multiple iCloud accounts on iOS, however, the second one can only be used for Mail, Contacts, Reminders, Calendars, and Notes. Only the main iCloud account can be used for Bookmarks, Photo Stream, iCloud Drive, Backup, and Find My iPad. Simply go to Settings, select Mail, Contacts, Calendars, then Add Account and select iCloud.\nFaceTime can be set to respond to multiple IDs, as can Messages.\n", "Q: Macbook pro mid 2012 slow down I'm actually asking about my wife's MacBook Pro which I don't use very often. It's slowed down quite a bit recently and apparently before the update to El Capitan. Programs have started to take a long time to launch but once they have launched actually run fine. After booting up it will take about 45 seconds for Safari to even be usable. Spotlight also lags a lot and can't even keep up with typing, although it responds to 'escape' quickly.\nI've watched the system monitor and even when programs are launching the CPU seems to be low with around 90% idle. It has 4GB of RAM and there always seems to be around 1.5Gb free.\nI've attached the summary showing the hardware below. It doesn't have an SSD.\nI've also run the Apple Hardware Test which took approximately an hour and nothing was reported from it.\nFrom what I've read people have suggested upgrading the memory but since it doesn't seem to be running out of memory I would be surprised if this helped. There's also very little running and nothing user installed that is being launched in the Dock at start up. \nAny help would be great and happy to provide any other stats needed. \nModel Name:    MacBook Pro\n\n\n*\n\n*Model Identifier:    MacBookPro9,2\n\n*Processor Name:  Intel Core i5\n\n*Processor Speed: 2.5 GHz\n\n*Number of Processors:    1\n\n*Total Number of Cores:   2\n\n*L2 Cache (per Core): 256 KB\n\n*L3 Cache:    3 MB\nMemory:   4 GB\n\n\nA: Starting with OS X 10.9 it appears that OS X relies heavily on one having an SSD.  Since apps, which have been run once after startup, when relaunching them, they are mainly started off inactive memory/cache and therefore are faster the second time you start them.  This is in line with your statement that once they are loaded, they work fine.\nAs a comparison, in my Mac Pro (Early 2008), I used conventional HDDs for a very long time as well.  The computer originally came with Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, which purred on this machine.  All following big cats also purred away without a problem at all.\nHowever, with the naming convention change of OS X 10.9 Mavericks, loading something from the HDD became cumbersome along with it (tested with System Preferences which took 30(!) seconds to show up after the system was started).  Once started and closed, it re-opened fast (due to it still being in inactive memory or cache).\nThe same could be seen later with \"Star Wars: The Old Republic\" under Windows on the very same computer.  Using the HDD it took some time to load the game and/or planets.\nWhile you can try things like clearing caches (which you can find at ~/Library/Caches), or back up all your data (e.g. using Time Machine) and reinstall OS X entirely (to verify that upgrading to newer OSs did not leave undesired settings), for the long haul I guess that you will not get around spending a bit more and get an SDD.  I did so myself eventually.\nWhile dissatisfied to spend money as well, I am very satisfied with the results.\nIMPORTANT: If you buy a non-Apple SSD drive, you want to check about trim to optimize it.  Otherwise you may wear it down too fast and spend even more money in buying a new one earlier.\n", "Q: Prevent deletion of apps from the Chrome App Launcher by other users How do I protect apps inside the Chrome App Launcher on a MacBook from being deleted by different users of the laptop? \n\nA: Make their accounts non-admin.\nYou cannot stop an admin from doing anything.\nSystem Prefs > Users & Groups  \n\n\n*\n\n*Unlock  \n\n*Disable\n\n\n\n", "Q: How much free space do I need to install Mavericks 10.9.4?

Let's say I have an Applescript that does THISCODE.  And I have another Applescript that does THATCODE.  I always run them in sequence, but never at regular intervals.  In other words, whichever one I ran last time, I'll always run the other the next time.\nIs there a way to combine the two Applescripts into one using a simple toggle?  For example, at the end of the Applescript, could I write a variable into the beginning of the script that'll be read the next time, such as EVENvariable or ODDvariable...  so that, when the Applescript runs, it'll know which state it was in the last time it ran.  Or is there an even more simple and obvious solution I'm missing?\n\nA: You can do it by setting your own defaults parameter, to store the value between uses/reboots etc, otherwise an Applescript will not remember your current toggled state.\nThis is a quick example that will set a user-defined parameter [replace with actual company &/or product name & memorable parameter name if you have one, otherwise the example data will do fine] then will just say out loud, 'yes' or 'no' depending on the state of the defaults parameter switch.\nYou can run it from the open script or save it as an application.\nset newTestParameter to \"YES\"\ntry\n    set oldTestParameter to do shell script \"defaults read com.myCo.myApp myParamSet\"\n    if oldTestParameter is in {\"1\", \"YES\"} then\n        set newTestParameter to \"NO\"\n    end if\nend try\ndo shell script \"defaults write com.myCo.myApp myParamSet \" & newTestParameter\n\n--your actual code, dependant on above switch\nif newTestParameter is in {\"1\", \"YES\"} then\n    say \"Yes\"\n    -- run thisCode\nelse\n    say \"No\"\n    -- run thatCode\nend if\n\nOn first run it will write a new file to ~/Library/Preferences called com.myCo.myApp.plist & will contain one parameter, with the current state of your toggle, like this\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>myParamSet</key>\n    <string>NO</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nYou don't need to do anything to 'maintain' this on your own, you can simply keep sending its new value with each script run.\n", "Q: Allowing sudo privileges, but not access to sites Is it possible to make it so a user can use the sudo command in terminal, but not have access to sites other then those allowed through parental controls, without a third party system? \n\nA: By adjusting the sudoers file (/etc/sudoers) with sudo visudo it should be possible to accomplish this. It is a hell of a job and you need a profound knowledge of all commands to fine-tune this while avoiding errors and loopholes though. \nYou have to add the user to the User privilege specification section\n...\n# User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL) ALL\n%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL\n...\n\nThen use a whitelist (or a blacklist) of allowed (or disallowed) commands:\nExamples:\nwhitelist\n# User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL) ALL\n%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL\nuser    ALL=/usr/bin/nano,/usr/bin/opensnoop\n\nblacklist\n# User privilege specification\nroot    ALL=(ALL) ALL\n%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL\nuser    ALL=!/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy,!/usr/bin/passwd,!/usr/sbin/*\n\nYou may mix whitelist and blacklist.\nPlease check man sudoers how to simplify things or narrow things down by configuring User, Runas, Host and Cmnd alias specifications.\n\nCheck the accepted answer to the question How to prevent sudo users from running specific commands? for the pitfalls of configuring a simple command like rnano in the sudoers file.\n\nA: The two concepts are mutually exclusive.\nAdding someone to the sudoers list effectively gives them the power to bypass any restriction you wish to impose on them.  \n", "Q: How can I move or replicate my Apple Music iTunes Cloud Library to Spotify? I have been using Apple Music from day 1, but I'm disappointed and want to move back to Spotify. Is there any way at all to easily replicate or move my entire library from Apple Music to Spotify? \nAll solutions I encountered by searching the internet only work the other way around.\n\nA: Though I haven't used it personally, the online service Stamp claims that it will transfer your \"tracks and playlists across various services,\" including Spotify and Apple Music in either direction.\nIt looks like, assuming you want to move more than a handful of songs, it costs €9 for a license. Reading through the iTunes and Play Store reviews for the mobile versions, it looks like most of the negative reviews are just people who didn't realize it's not free, though some people say that it's fairly slow or doesn't do a very good job of matching up the tracks between services.\n", "Q: I don't ever use Siri, but it's using too much battery I never use Siri, but when I look what has been draining my battery it says it's Siri!\n\n\nA: None of these suggestions helped me. What caused this problem was that my phone was set to automatically connect to a WiFi network that required a separate webpage-based login. They're called \"captive networks\" like the ones in restaurants and coffee shops, where you have to first open your web browser, and then fill in a login form, or click an \"Accept\" or \"Go Online\" button before you can connect to the Internet.\nWhat happens is that my phone connected to the network automatically, but since I didn't open a web browser and manually login, I had no Internet connection. Then, Siri detected that I was connected on WiFi and tried over and over again to get out to the Internet, sucking up all my battery. (Perhaps Apple should have Siri do a progressive increasing of Siri's connection interval if the Internet fails? Kind of like Gmail does.)\nTo solve the problem, I just went into Settings->WiFi and selected the WiFi network that was causing my problem, and then clicked Forget this Network to stop my phone from automatically connecting. (You could also just leave your WiFi turned off, but that's no fun.)\nNext day, I had 90+% battery life when I was heading home at 6pm.\n\nA: In iOS 9, Proactive services like Siri Suggestions (on the far left home screen page) will consume power. It has nothing to do with the actual Siri.\nIf you don't like Siri Suggestions, you can disable it in Settings > General > Spotlight Search.\n\nYou might also go into Settings > General > Siri and make sure \"Hey Siri\" is turned off, especially if you have an iPhone 6s or 6s Plus. Your iPhone \"listens\" for the words \"Hey Siri\" but only when connected to power (unless you have an iPhone 6s or 6s Plus, then it's all the time), but doing the two things above and then restarting your device should prevent more usage from accumulating under the \"Siri\" bucket.\n\nA: If you turn off your Siri and leave your phone off (locked) doing nothing for a day and overnight Siri will use less battery and the percentage will go down.  Siri drained my battery one time and i learned that keeping Siri off helped it.\n\nA: I don't have an answer, but I have a theory. I'm having a hard time believing \"Siri\" is really \"Siri\". I have a phone that is waiting for a number port and sitting on my desk doing nothing. After 24 hours of sitting off Wi-Fi and looking for a network, not using it for anything, with the screen off, it says 90% of the usage was \"Siri\". Hence, I think \"Siri\" is synonymous with \"System\".\n", "Q: \"Recent Items\" count is not saved in System Preferences-OS X 10.11 \"El Capitan\" In System Preferences, when I try to change \"Recent Items\" count from \"none\" to any other value it is not saved. I can change it, but when I close System Preferences and open it again I still see \"none\" in \"Recent Items\". What can be the problem? Is there a way to change it manually? I am using OS X 10.11 \"El Capitan\".\n\n\nA: Sounds like the .plist file is corrupted. Go to Library/Preferences and drag the file named com.apple.recentitems.plist into the Trash and empty it.

Or do I have to disable SIP remove the app and then (if I can) re-enable SIP?\nEDIT\nIt occurs to me that because SIP acts only on the boot disk, it is easy to delete the file by just booting from another disk (eg USB) and accessing the main HD from there.\n\nA: Not sure if this is really a good idea, but you can run this (as yourself, not root) in Terminal:\nlaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.AddressBook.SourceSync.plist\n\nFWIW, I had the same problem and even after following the instructions in Tetsujin's link, turning off all Contacts accounts in System Preferences, logging out of iCloud, blowing away the AddressBookSourceSync directories in ~/Library/Caches and ~/Library/Application Support, and of course many reboots, I could not get AddressBookSourceSync to stop blocking sleep. This command “fixed” it.

I have a 2013 iMac with a broken logic board and display. It's too expensive to repair, but I'd like to salvage the fusion drive. If I put the drive in an external case will it work?\n\nA: A Fusion Drive is a combination of 2 drives, one Solid State (SSD) and the other a standard Hard Drive (HDD). You can remove the two drives and reuse them in enclosures as 2 separate drives.\n\nA: No, the Fusion Drive will not work away from a Mac.  The separate components can be formatted to work as stand alone drives but the core storage volume that we call a Fusion Drive will not function without OS X.\nThe data is gone once the Fusion Drive is busted.

I have my eye on the app Day One. One reason for this is that it's based on Multimarkdown, which often means it includes support for equations in LaTeX. However, I don't know if this particular Markdown feature is supported in the Day One app.\nIf anyone has the app, you could test this for me by typing something like\n$$ \\int x\\,dx = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 + C $$\n\nand seeing if it comes out as a nice-looking equation. \n\n(It is possible that \"MathJax\" might have to be enabled in some kind of preferences menu for this to work.)

Lately, whenever I am trying to find a process on console with ps aux | grep foo, it is returning a grep: command not found. Ok, that could be something that I changed and did wrong, but the problem is that, after a few tries, it suddenly knows what grep is:\nMM:.dev$ ps aux | grep foo\n-bash:  grep: command not found\nMM:.dev$ ps aux | grep foo\n-bash:  grep: command not found\nMM:.dev$ ps aux | grep foo\n-bash:  grep: command not found\nMM:.dev$ ps aux | grep foo\nMM            70953   0,0  0,0  2699108    744   ??

Just try typing it again, move with your cursor before the letter \"g\" of grep, delete the whitespace that could have been entered with a still pressed ALT/Option key, hit the space key again and fire up your commandline. \nAnother workaround is to lower the keyboard repeat rate in System Preferences, if you are not typing with ten fingers. :-)\n\nA: Looking at your output, there seems to be an extra space before grep in the error message. I assume this is coming from a still pressed Opt/Alt key after typing the pipe symbol (so you basically are typing Opt-Space instead of just Space). Try ps aux |grep foo (without a space between the pipe and the g).\n", "Q: Set imageView as a banner inside an app I wonder if Apple Review team allows such thing.\nImagine you have a imageView inside your app, and you set it as a static banner, without any clicking option etc. \nDo you think Apple will allow sth like this?\nTo give you a better notion of what I mean:\n\nThe banner with \"Amlozek\" text is just a completely static ImageView that can have no interaction with user.\nDo you think Apple would say \"hey, you are placing ads inside your app omitting the official way to do that\" or they just don't care about such small banners?\n\nA: Apple don't restrict ads in apps to iAd.

I have an iPhone 5 running iOS 9.1 and a Macbook Pro running Yosemite.\nBoth devices are set up to sync photos to and from iCloud.\nWhen I take a photo on the iPhone (for further processing on the Macbook), it takes an inordinate amount of time until the photo shows up in the Macbook's photos library - sometimes up to 10-20 minutes. Sometimes it seems to work faster if I quit the Photos app on both devices, and start it again.\nI often end up sending myself photos through E-Mail because it's quicker. That seems ridiculous!\nIs there a way to force a sync on the iPhone, or to speed up the process some other way?\n\nA: When you take a photo from your iPhone, switch to the Photos app. At the very bottom of the Photos tab, you should immediately see the indicator Uploading…\nIf your MacBook is plugged in to a power source and/or has the Photos app open, it will download photos as soon as they are in iCloud.\nBoth your devices need to be connected to Wi-Fi for the aforementioned to occur.\nThe key is for you to open the Photos app on your iPhone. It used to upload as soon as you connected to Wi-Fi (possibly only if you had sufficient battery), but as of iOS 9 that no longer appears to be the case. I’m guessing this was done to keep from eating up your bandwidth while you may be doing something else.\nIf you don’t open the Photos app, your iPhone will upload new photos if it is connected to a power source and locked, and it has sufficient battery.\nUpdate: Starting with iOS 10, I am once again seeing immediate uploads of photos from my iPhone when connected to Wi-Fi, whether I’m using the phone or not, and whether connected to a power source or not (might still need to be above 50% battery). Low power mode should be turned off too. \n\nA: I've an iPhone running 9.2 and MBP running El Cap (Photos v1.2). I do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Photos on my MBP and let it stabilize (finish its startup processing).\n\n*Take a photo(s) on my iPhone.\n\n*View the photo(s) on my iPhone -- even just popping into and out of the app is enough to ensure the sync process has started.\n\n*Return to my MBP, and the photo(s) appear there, usually within 2 minutes.\n\n\nThe syncing of the photo on OS X corresponds with the process photolibraryd jumping to the top of my process list, as viewed in Activity Monitor. I think the key is to have Photos open and switching into Photos on iOS -- the latter step signals the app that you have stopped taking photos and it's safe to start the sync. More experimentation is obviously needed, for example, I've not yet been able to see if photolibraryd runs on a periodic schedule, or if some other process signals it that there is new data in the cloud that needs to be sync'd.\n\nA: No, unfortunately the process is completely automated and no \"force sync\" exists, you simply have to wait.\nObviously understand that your iPhone needs to be on Wi-Fi (and the faster this is the better) for the sync to iCloud to happen. Photo app sync doesn't happen over 3G / 4G.\nFor me this process is lightning quick - I take a photo on my iPhone 6S and within seconds my Photo's are updating through iCloud. Now, I should point I'm checking the upload through www.icloud.com and not the Photo's app but you could do the same to check if at least the iPhone is getting the shots up quickly and whether the slow down is between iCloud and your Mac.\n\nA: You absolutely can speed up iCloud photo sync. Server.app can run on most any Mac and act as a caching server.\nOnce you've set up the caching server, you can opt in to caching your iCloud data (encrypted and secured) on the local server which in my experience greatly increases the download time from iCloud to a device.\nI haven't experienced any upload delays of more than a few minutes lately, but that might also be affected by the caching server and wireless sync peer to peer if you update the iOS and mac OS devices.\n", "Q: How to find an iMovie project file - Mac- iPad iMovie? I'm trying to get an iMovie onto my iPad in an editable format and I'm told you need to paste the project file into iCloud drive.

You can keep working on the project file you exported—it opens in either iOS or OS X—but once you import it into iMovie on the Mac, you're stuck editing in the Mac environment.\n\n", "Q: Turn off the built-in monitor on MBP El Capitan with clamshell open I usually plug my MBP 15\" late 2011 (El Capitan 10.11.2) with an external monitor, and I only use that. Also I need to use the trackpad.\nSo I need to turn off the built-in monitor with the clamshell open. Possibly using a terminal command. How can do it?\nI already tried this solution (for Yosemite) but doesn't work on El capitan: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/154600/90762\nAnd I already tried DisableMonitor app but it reduces the brightness of the monitor to 0 and it remains on! So probably it consumes more. Is there a way to completely turn off?\n\nA: You can also just mirror the display of the MacBook screen to the external one and then turn off the brightness of the Macbook screen (so it turns fully black).\nThen you can keep the lid open of your MacBook AND use the TrackPad.\nSystem Preferences > Displays > Arrangement > Select \"Mirror Displays\".\n\nA: Given how none of the old methods seemed to work in El Capitan, the magnet method sounded pretty interesting to me, so I decided to try it.\nI got the smallest and weakest hobby/craft magnet I had, and ran it through the top left corner of the Macbook Air, as some of those other answers said that's the location. I suspect the location may differ between Macbook models. \nIn my MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2012), the location seemed to be on the left side, slightly above the Tab key. \nI used Pritt multi tack to keep the magnet in place, but you could use double sided tape, for example. If I wanted to be really careful with the magnet, I could've put a spacer between the Macbook surface and the magnet about the height of the magnet itself, and it still would've worked.\nThere's one kinda big downside to this.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you stop using the Macbook touchpad or keyboard for something like 3 seconds, they stop working. You then need to remove the magnet to re-enable them. This is kind of a deal-breaker, if you don't want to use external mouse and keyboard.\n\n\nIf you are ok with using an external keyboard and mouse, this seems like the best method to me.\n\n\nA: Close the lid of your MacBook.\n\nA: SwitchResX works for me: you can easily disable displays in its GUI.\n", "Q: How can I show the contact number of the Dialed contact I want the contact number to appear on the dialling screen when initiating call that if contact has more than one number I want to know which number I had dialled.\n\nA: Unfortunately, you cannot display the number of a contact while calling him. However, there's a way of identifying the number you are calling by adding a custom Contact Label.\nTo do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Contacts app\n\n*Search for you desired contact\n\n*Tap Edit in the top right corner to edit your contact\n\n*Tap the label next to the number on the left.

You may need this for Perl and other scripts that should to be run via a webserver. If you apply 755 to a directory, it means that everyone can go to it and get its file listing.\nWhen you run chgrp group-name filename command you change the group of each filename to group-name. \nRunning both commands using sudo prefix let you be sure that the changes takes effect, because your run it as root that is the user with most permissions on every single unix like machine.\nYou can type man chmod, man chgrp or man sudo for more info and options.\n", "Q: DVD stuck in 2006 iMac, won't boot So I put a DVD in and it wouldn't come out.

I have a bunch of formatted spreadsheets scattered all across my computer. There are literally thousands of them. I want to get them all into a centralized folder and have mostly done that, i.e. most of these documents are located inside of a single folder (recursively anyway, there are some within subfolders of that single folder), there are a few stragglers however, maybe 5% of them. Currently in my Finder/Spotlight search results, I have to sift through thousands of files located in the correct location to find them.

I've tried this so far without success:\n\nI'm guessing I could use Automator but feel like that's a little hardcore given the strength of Apple's native tools, terminal commands being even more-so.\n\nA: You can use HoudahSpot to search for spreadsheets that are outside your centralized folder. Full disclosure: I am the developer of HoudahSpot.\nIn HoudahSpot you can create a search for spreadsheet files. Specify that you want to search your home folder, but want to exclude the folder you set aside for spreadsheets.

When unplugging them you cant just flip them out they need even pressure from each side and the middle and gentle levering very tiny amounts at a time if you are in the habit of flipping them out you may have inadvertently damaged them, if you think you may have been careless with the connectors you can get replacements inexpensively and this is a common issue on the mac.\ni would disconnect the battery from the logic board and leave it for 15 mins then be very careful to firmly plug it back in using even pressure so all of it is plugged in evenly, be very careful. don't connect the mag. (trying to discharge the mac battery while the mains is plugged in won't discharge the battery). Then close your mac back up and screw it back together. before you plug it in the mag hold down the power button to 15 seconds or longer, something should happen a beep, a flashing light so just wait. if after a while nothing happens plug in the mag. But just wait for something to happen, mac batteries have an issue where they can get all screwed up and need discharging and this is how I would fix it.\nthe main reason for a battery needing this is usually due to hardware changes (for example recently I'm betting bet you have made some hardware changes like an SSD or just better memory), the mac will work fine for a while  after a hardware change then need a negative discharge, its a one time deal and due to a new power setup from voltage changes in the hardware. Replacing the battery won't change the situation as the system still needs to reconfigure its new voltage settings. Don't try to reset the battery with the mains pugged in its all done without any external power, i think its a lot to do with the boot up process and probably unique to MBP. \n---edit i edited this to make it more informative and corrected spellings---\n\nA: I had the same issue. I tried everything and nothing seems to work, but then I opened my MacBook and unplugged the battery socket with the charger connected and everything is perfect now.\n", "Q: Accept login policy banner without mouse My computer setup currently has three monitors: the 15.4\" built-in display of my MacBook pro, a 27\" Apple Thunderbolt Display connected by Thunderbolt, and a 10\" Mimo Magic Touch display connected to the Thunderbolt Display via USB.  The computer is running a version of OS X 10.10 Yosemite.\nMy computer also has a user agreement policy banner set to appear at login due to the presence of /Library/Security/PolicyBanner.rtfd.  However, the Mimo monitor appears to be causing issues with the policy banner: namely, the banner is appearing partially off-screen, making the \"Accept\" button unclickable.  I'm not sure if this is due to the smaller size of the monitor, or the atypical monitor/driver.\nFurthermore, the standard accessibility functionality does not appear to work with the policy banner as far as I can tell: I can't use ⇥ to tab to the \"Accept\" button, nor can I just hit ↩.  I've also tried various combinations of modifier keys with these options.  ⌘+A (the first letter of the \"Accept\" button) also does not work.\nUltimately, my question is thus: is there a way to accept the policy without using the mouse and clicking on \"Accept\"?  If not, this seems like an accessibility oversight on Apple's part, as I would imagine this is also a potential problem for users with special accessibility needs.  It would also mean that you can no longer log into your mac with just a keyboard.\n\nA: This appears to have been fixed in OS X 10.11 El Capitan, as the banner can be accepted using ↩.  Furthermore, the window appears fully on-screen in my scenario, rendering the need for a keyboard-only approach unnecessary for my use case.\nSo as far as I can tell, it is impossible to accept the policy banner without using the mouse in OS X 10.10 Yosemite, but they've fixed it in OS X 10.11 El Capitan.\n", "Q: Changing configurations for Jrnl Greetings to the apple community.\nI'm a newbie to mac and the terminal and I have no previous exposure to Linux.\nI have only casually used computers. However I've been wanting to step up my game and understand a few basics.\nI've installed this package http://maebert.github.io/jrnl/ which is basically to write entries on the terminal.\nI've done so, and I've been following the tutorial.\nHowever, I'm facing difficulty to edit my entries.\nThe documentation says that I need to change the ~/.jrnl_config file.\nHowever, when I try to access it I get permission denied.\nHarguns-MacBook-Pro-3:~ hargun3045$ ~/.jrnl_config\n-bash: /Users/hargun3045/.jrnl_config: Permission denied\nI have a very vague idea of user read/write permissions and about Root access, however I'm not very clear how I can go to the particular file and change settings.\nCan a experienced user guide me? \nThanks!\n\nA: It looks like you're attempting to execute the .jrnl_config file. You don't want to execute it, you want to edit it. i.e. nano ~/.jrnl_config or open ~/.jrnl_config.\nIn the error message, Bash is telling you that you don't have permission to execute the file. This is because execute permission isn't given to your user (or any user, most likely) for that file.

I have an album in My Music, so the plays should be syncing, but the play count is not being effected by music played on my phone. Is there any trip to let the play count sync between devices? I know that the \"love\" are device specific, but I thought that play count should sync because it worked before Apple Music.\nThanks\n\nA: I can only get it to sync when I plug my iPhone to iTunes and sync it manually. \n\nA: For me, it takes a good while for the play counts to sync, but eventually they will. So wait a few hours and see if they've been updated.\n", "Q: Use caffeinate to prevent sleep on lid close on battery The native caffeinate utility is not working to prevent my macbook from sleeping when I close the display.  Instead, the system sleeps and various network services ( VPN, screenshares, VOIP calls, messaging clients, file transfers ) to fail while I walk from my desk to my meeting in < 5 minutes.\nWalking around with the laptop lid half open makes it difficult to safely carry with my coffee, and is distinctly uncool.\nThe native caffeinate utility is designed to handle this as a user-friendly replacement for pmset, but appears to be designed not to work when disconnected from AC power.\nDocs via man caffeinate\n\n-s Create an assertion to prevent the system from sleeping. This assertion is valid only when system is running on AC power.\n\nLooking for a native alternative to InsomniaX or nosleep.\nA timeout feature is essential so that I avoid accidentally stuffing my undead macbook into a bag, resulting in a hot mess.  ( caffeinate -t, specifies the timeout value in seconds )\n\nA: Github user iccir has made a very handy little free menubar app called Fermata that does exactly what you want: keeps a MacBook awake with the lid closed, and allows you to set a timeout duration.\nI just tried it on Mojave (10.14.2) and it worked great for me. https://github.com/iccir/Fermata\n\nA: tested on macOS Catalina Version 10.15.6\nworks both on battery mode and charger mode.\nsudo pmset disablesleep 1\n\ndo not forget to restore settings by\nsudo pmset disablesleep 0\n\nMy daughter often close the lid once she found I left my seat while I am still listening YouTube, this pmset command helps me to continue listening YouTube.\n\nA: It's not ideal, but here's a solution. To prevent the laptop from sleeping when the lid is closed and you're running on battery, run the following commands:\nsudo pmset -b sleep 0; sudo pmset -b disablesleep 1\n\nTo re-enable laptop sleeping when the lid is closed and you're running on battery, run the following commands:\nsudo pmset -b sleep 5; sudo pmset -b disablesleep 0\n\nThe \"5\" in the second set of commands represents the number of minutes before sleeping when on battery; adjust as desired for your laptop.\nThis is a bit dangerous, since if you forget to re-enable your settings, the laptop will never sleep when on battery. Because of this, I've written a shell script to automatically re-enable the settings:\n#!/bin/bash\n#***************************************************************************\n#*** noz - prevent laptop from sleeping when lid is closed\n#***************************************************************************\n\n#***** set some defaults *****\nBATTERY_SLEEP=5 # in minutes\nDEF_WAKE_LEN=300 # in seconds\n\n#***** determine timeout value *****\ntimeout_len=${1:-$DEF_WAKE_LEN}\n\nfunction prevent_sleep() {\n    echo\n    echo -n \"Preventing sleep for $timeout_len seconds; press <enter> to continue...\"\n\n    sudo pmset -b disablesleep 1\n    sudo pmset -b sleep 0\n}\n\nfunction enable_sleep() {\n    # $1: <enter> = 0, timeout = 1, Ctrl-C = undef\n\n    #----- insert a newline for timeout or Ctrl-C -----\n    if [[ ${1:-1} -eq 1 ]]; then    echo; fi\n    echo \"Restoring previous battery sleep setting: $BATTERY_SLEEP\"\n\n    sudo pmset -b disablesleep 0\n    sudo pmset -b sleep $BATTERY_SLEEP\n\n    #----- sleep on timeout only -----\n    if [[ ${1:--1} -eq 1 ]]; then   sudo pmset sleepnow; fi\n    exit\n}\n\n#***** prevent it from sleeping *****\nprevent_sleep\n\n#***** trap Ctrl-C *****\ntrap enable_sleep INT\n\n#***** wait for an enter *****\nread -t $timeout_len\nrc=$?\n\n#***** re-enable normal sleep *****\nenable_sleep $rc\n\nThe shell script will disable sleeping until you hit the Enter key, at which point it will re-enable the sleep settings (alternately, you can hit Ctrl-C and achieve the same thing). It will also set a timeout (defaults to 300 seconds/5 minutes) after which the sleep settings will automatically be re-enabled, and the laptop will be forced to go to sleep. While this would be a pain if you're using your laptop in a meeting, it will be a lifesaver if you forgot and put your laptop in your bag to go home.\nAstute readers will note that these commands require sudo; sadly, that's unavoidable AFAIK. What I've done on my system is to make it so that I don't have to enter my password to run pmset as root. To do that, edit the sudoers file (sudo visudo) and add this line:\njoe ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pmset\n\nreplacing \"joe\" with your username. You could probably achieve the same result (i.e. running the script without having to enter your password) by running the shell script SETUID, but I don't like doing that; opening up this one command via sudoers seems less risky to me.\nTo run the script, stick it in a directory on your PATH and invoke it as such:\nnoz [<timeout in seconds>]\n\nWhen you get to where you're going, simply hit Enter or Ctrl-C and you're good to go. And if you forget about it, it will automatically reset and sleep.\nThere's probably a way to achieve all of this via AppleScript, so that you can then assign it a hot key and what not; I'll try that if I ever get tired of running this from the command line.\n\nA: There's no native way to do it. Here is what I got after some searching and trials:\n\nNote:\n\n\n*\n\n*Nosleep's kernel extension failed to be loaded on High Sierra\n\n*The private SPI is NOT supported by Apple after High Sierra. Fermata switched to the pmset method after version 1.1\n\n*You may need to disable Gatekeeper to let Insomnia work as expected.\n\n*The other apps I tried don't work with lid closed\n\n\nA: Have you tried this app? I find it very useful for exactly what you're after. \nI'm fairly sure it has a timeout feature that you set within the settings of the app. \n", "Q: Mid-2015 Macbook Pro Dented on Arrival I was finally happy to be retiring my Early 2011 Macbook Pro, and upgrading to one of the newer force touch rMBP. But when the package arrived today, I noticed that it has a dent under the chassis. \nI haven't used the laptop, or even turned it on, but the seller won't accept returns on eBay. Common sense would suggest getting in touch with Apple, but I'm not sure if this is covered under warranty. \nWhat are my options right now? \nSome pictures: \n\n\n\nA: If the laptop is brand new then it should be covered under warranty by Apple for at least 12 months. I would definitely recommend getting in touch with them. You can lookup whether you're covered by warranty by entering in the laptop serial number here. \nEven visit an Apple Store if there is one nearby you, they are usually more than happy to help. \nEven though this is technically physical damage, it's due to no fault of your own, so it needs to be fixed. \nI would also open a case with the seller through eBay, although they state they do not accept returns, if the dent wasn't photographed as part of the ad, or if it happened during shipping, it should be covered under the general eBay/PayPal returns policy. \n", "Q: Unable to change volume during call when on speaker mode I'm able to change volume when not on speaker, however it does not work if I'm on speaker mode.

Your otool -L output on the Python module should thus contain\n/opt/local/lib/libgnuradio-grgsm.$version.dylib (...)\n\nThis path is copied from what Apple calls the \"shared library identification name\" in a library when you link against it. That means that whatever value is in the output of otool -L on the Python module is the same value that you get by running otool -D on /opt/local/lib/libgnuradio-grgsm.dylib (or just using otool -L and looking at the first line). If you do this on your machine, you will notice that it also does not contain an absolute path. That's the root cause of the issue you see.\nFirst, this is a bug in GNU Radio, or MacPorts' packaging of GNU Radio. Please file a ticket so this can get fixed or addressed with the GNU Radio developers.\nSecond, there are a couple of ways to work around this issue for now:\n\n\n*\n\n*Method A: Fix the identification name of libgnuradio-grgsm.dylib. This can be done using install_name_tool -id $correctID /opt/local/lib/libgnuradio-grgsm.dylib. Note that the absolute path to the unversioned dylib is likely not the correct value for this. libgnuradio-grgsm.dylib is likely a symlink to another symlink with the major version embedded. This path is the one that should be used as install name. After this change, rebuilding the Python module should solve the issue.\n\n*Method B: Fix the path in the load command of the Python module. Use install_name_tool -change libgnuradio-grgsm.dylib $correctID /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/grgsm/_grgsm_swig.so to do this. $correctID should be chosen as explained in Method A.\n", "Q: Xcode 7.2 downloading but not installing I went through the tedious download process via App Store.

I have recently been recording long videos with my iPhone (3 hrs/day). When I've come home, I have transfered the videos to my computer and then deleted them on the iPhone.\nDespite this, my iCloud storage has gone from half-full to completely full in a very short time. It doesn't feel right, and while I can't prove it, I think that the long videos haven't been deleted but are still counted.\nI have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Emptied \"Recently deleted videos\"\n\n*Made sure that the long videos aren't present on iCloud on any connected device (including in the \"Photos app\" on icloud.com)\n\n\nI do not back up my devices to iCloud – so it can't be that they are lingering there. I also haven't taken any other images except those videos.\n\nA: With the help of AppleCare support, after a very lengthy exchange spanning 6 months, this issue finally got resolved.\nIt turns out that photo and video original files were still erroneously being kept in the iCloud storage, even though I had deleted them completely from all GUI interfaces. I discovered this by downloading the entire library to my iMac using the Download and Store Originals settings in Apple Photos, and then in manually inspecting the ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary file, by right-clicking the file in Finder and opening it with Show Package Contents.\nI was then able to see old photos and videos that were supposed to be deleted long ago;  which led me to understand that they were also \"stuck\" in the iCloud storage and therefore held my storage space \"hostage\" at a higher plateau than necessary. This had forced me to increase my storage plan.\nThe photos and videos not deleting properly happened pre-iOS 9.11, and it's not certain if the bug causing the actual issue is still alive in later iOS versions. However, if you have under unusual circumstances encountered this bug before the update to 9.11, the originals can still be stuck there, because iOS updates will not get them out of limbo. If looks like you have used up far more disk space/iCloud storage than the amount of photos and videos in your library can account for, I suggest that you inspect the photoslibrary file.\nYou will then need Apple Support help to reconstruct your iCloud photos library which their engineering support team can do, once you've explained the issue to a AppleCare senior adviser. Just be warned that they are not used to this issue and a lot of explaining may be needed to get them to take the case seriously. In my case, I had to collect a lot of evidence and do some real argumentation to get them to understand that there was a problem in their system.\n", "Q: How to open applications in fullscreen via Terminal I just created a script to open my most-used apps, but I have two questions about it.\nThe code of the script is the following:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"Hi $(whoami)\"\necho \"Openning your default apps...\"\nopen -a Mail\nopen -a Wunderlist\nopen -a Reminders\nopen -a Notes\nopen -a Pocket\nopen -a Safari\necho \"Do you want social networks?

I'm going to be repurposing my laptop as a media center in the near future and I was planning on using a non-admin account for day-to-day usage.  I was thinking of enabling parental controls so I can lockdown what applications are allowed to run but parental controls can be a PITA so I would like to know how it works under-the-hood.  \nIs it using seatbelt to implement some form of MAC or does it just make it difficult to launch applications through the UI?\n\nA: The restrictions are a multitude of features and MDM/MCX controls that apple has for a long time delivered for corporate users and managers to control the OS. Since so many different restrictions can be configured, there is no one implementation.

I am considering getting a new Time Capsule (2TB) as a basic/pseudo NAS, in addition to a target for Time Machine for two macs. \nMy macs each have a 500 GB ssd. Neither are currently even half full, but at some point down the road, I assume they'll each have 400 GB. I think I've read that Time Machine should have storage for at least 1.5x the amount of data being backed up, so 400 x 1.5 = 600, x2 macs = 1.2 TB needed. \nWith the 2 TB Time Capsule, I'd have 800 GB available for NAS, but I need to LIMIT the space used by Time Machine, since it otherwise continues to grow, using all available space on the disk. But the TC disk can't be easily partitioned, so the solution I found is to put my NAS files in a blank Disk Image on the Time Capsule -- which prevents Time Machine from using that space. (See Can I set up quotas on my Time Capsule?) \nWhen creating a Disk Image in Disk Utility, the largest preset is 8.3 GB. But this would require an 800 GB Disk Image. So finally, my question...\nQUESTION -- Is an 800 GB Disk Image (and this strategy in general) ok, or is it a very bad idea? Why?\n\nA: This is a bad idea on a Time capsule. It is possible, but it will be extremely slow to set up and very slow in use.\nSee Pondini's Time Capsule Q3\nYou can use Disk Utility to create a custom-size disk image (normal, not sparse) and specify it to be 800GB size, but you have to create that empty 800GB file locally first, then upload it to your Time Capsule. The Time Capsule's disk and network connections are not built for speed.\nEven if you reserve 800GB of space on your Time Capsule, there is no quota to shared the remaining 1200GB fairly between your users. \nFor example - One user could repeatedly fill their SSD with junk, back it up to the Time Machine target on the Time Capsule, delete the local junk and download fresh junk to the SSD. They could repeat this until the 1200GB space is used up. Only at that point would their oldest junk be automatically deleted from their Time Machine history. The other user would not be able to prompt any clear-out of the junk, they would only be able to lose their own oldest material.\nShorter answer: Time Capsule is great, but it is a backup device not a NAS: it is too slow and has no NAS functions. Don't try to use it like a proper NAS. It is handy for storing a few shared files like a very very basic NAS can, but that is very limited.\n", "Q: Better understanding Family Sharing (Can I share app from OSX to my iOS device?) I'm trying to figure out (for the first time) Family Sharing feature.

I would like to install it on my iPad. Is it possible? Or can I share only between OSX to OSX and iOS to iOS?\nDoes Tweetbot (or any other app) bought for OSX is something completely different than Tweetbot for iOS?

This makes it really easy to connect to my home-network. You get a list of services like Plex, iTunes, filesharing, screensharing, printers, and so on. You can also easily browse the web (via firefox) over this connection as well.

The following citation from /wiki/superuser gives further support for this.\n\nGiven that a superuser account has substantially more privileges than ordinary user accounts and can therefore make unrestricted, potentially adverse system-wide changes, the Principle of least privilege recommends that applications use an ordinary account to perform its work so as to improve system security and stability.\n\nI have just downloaded Adobe Reader 11.0.10. After double clicking the .dmg and opening the disk image, only a file called Install Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.app is visible. When I start this, it prompts me with the \"wants to make changes dialogue\". So if I type my password here (being an administrator), the application can do absolutely anything.\nWith a .pkg file I do not mind entering the password of an administrator, because I can see exactly what operations require the privileges. Unfortunately an approach like the one in this answer does not work, because the .app file does not contain a .pkg file.\nQuestion: Is there any way to get Adobe Reader without granting it administrator privileges?\n\nA: The 'Install Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.app' you downloaded is an online installer.\nThis means that the installer downloads Adobe Reader when you run the installer, such that the installer always installs the latest version, even if you run an older installer. This is why the installer is only ~2 MB, which is nowhere near enough to store Adobe Reader within, even compressed. Thus, there's no Adobe Reader inside that you can extract.\nWhat you actually want is the offline installer, available to download from the Enterprise site:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://get.adobe.com/reader/enterprise/\nSelect the version of OS X and your language, and you will be able to download the full installer of over 100 MB.

The first problem was sorted using the darkened menus and dock. But not the second problem.\n\n\n\nA: I think I've got the solution. Apart from enabling dark menu and dock all you have to do is to turn on \"Increase contrast\" option. See below:\n\n\n", "Q: Can't rip CD into my Son's iPod because of Apple Music I'm a simple man. I want to take the CD my son got in kindergarten. Rip it into mp3/aac using my iTunes 11.3 El Capitan based Mac. Plug in my Son's 5th gen iOS 9,2 based iPod Touch. Put the ripped music into his on device's Media Library. Plug the device back into the stereo in his room. Play the good vibes and see him go crazy the toy drums once more.\nAlas, Apple broke that:\n\nThis in itself is wrong, as I did enable the family package of Apple Music and added my Son's device into my Apple Music account (streaming of music works on his device).\nSo now I have the newly ripped music claimed by Apple Music and uploaded to iCloud (fine, whatever). The problem is can't move the files to my Son's device AND I can't share my own uploaded media using something I would imagine be called \"Shared Family iCloud Music Library\".\nThe music itself is merely uploaded, not matched and not DRM protected. \n\n\nThis all comes down to me not knowing of a method in which I can put my ripped music on my son's iPod. Which makes it NOT OK any more.\nAny suggestions? \n\nA: As I suspected, once you turn iCloud library on, it is reluctant to allow you to add music using iTunes alone, as there could be file duplicates and a storage war. \nPer Apple's forums, turning off iCloud musing will allow you to sync music manually, then you can turn it back on. Note this will delete all the 'iClouded' music and then re-download it, you you'll probably want to do this when you have a spare hour or so and a stable wifi connection. \n", "Q: MacBook connected to ghost network I have a MacBook and it has been giving me a weird issue since today morning.

It still showed connected to the wifi network that had been off for the past couple of hours.\nThe net did start to work when I switched on the router but I still can't figure out why this was happening.\n\nA: You are actually connected to the AirPort.

I got a new iPhone in the US, but am using it abroad (Israel) and with my old Apple ID.\nIn the App Store I see the Apple Pages/Numbers/Keynote with a price tag on them (not free) when they should be free.\nWhat is the problem here?\n\nA: After taking it up with Apple Support, here is the answer:\nThe first user (AppleID) which activates a new iPhone gets those apps free. If the iPhone is reset to defaults and another user (AppleID) is used, which is what I did, then that user does not get them for free.\nSo the free option is a one time thing. \n", "Q: Move album from iTunes on PC to Macbook wirelessly I have just used iTunes to import a CD on my desktop Windows 7 PC.\nI'd actually like the CD on my Macbook Pro's (El Capitan) iTunes library; I've been using iTunes' Music Sharing to access it in the past.\nHow can I \"wirelessly import\" this CD from my PC's iTunes onto my Macbook's?\nThe two iTunes libraries use different iTunes accounts.\n\nA: I wouldn't bother with looking for an iTunes based solution. Instead I would:\n\n\n*\n\n*Locate the audio tracks in Windows Explorer.\n\n*Transfer the tracks to your Mac by whatever means you have (direct network connection, Dropbox etc.).\n\n*Import the tracks into iTunes on Mac (e.g. by double-clicking them in Finder).\n\n", "Q: How to avoid iTunes asking for iCloud account? iTunes always asks me to log into my iCloud account. I do not want to use iCloud. This message to log in drives me crazy, it pops up every five minutes. How can I stop/avoid this, while still using iTunes?\nTo make it clear: I do not want to connect to Apple services all the time. I have an Apple ID, but when I created it, it was for the online service. I have bought music on iTunes, but after testing it I went to only buy DRM free music somewhere. However, I like the hardware, I like many things regarding Mac OS, but I have my own clouds and I do not want to connect to some internet service all the time.\nThere is a similar question here: iTunes asking for password for wrong iTunes account\n\nA: iTunes is requesting that you sign in with your Apple ID. Your Apple ID is used to associate your iTunes purchases and credit details with iTunes. \nAn iCloud account is not the same as an iTunes account, but typically, one uses the same Apple ID for both. However, it is possible for one to use a DIFFERENT Apple ID for iCloud and iTunes. In fact, this is quite normal for those that shared iTunes purchases with other family members before Apple implemented Family Sharing.\nThe answer is simple: create separate Apple IDs for iCloud or iTunes. If your Apple ID is currently used for iCloud, feel free to create a new one just for iTunes. \nNote that iTunes doesn't use iCloud for music, or storage, or really anything, so it is not clear what is the basis for your objection.\n", "Q: Duplicating and renaming Finder selection to the same folder in one clean step?

For the AppleScript solution, I need to find a way to remove the file extension from ((finderSelList)'s (item i)'s name), and also remove the trailing . when dealing with folders.

I put a coin there and tape (on the rubber) and it works. \nIt appears this part is moving and when there is no space between the case and this part it stops moving and works. That's also why sometimes keys worked when bending the case. My opinion is that the problem occurred thanks to late replacement of the battery, which bent the case a little bit and left some space which causes the problem.\n", "Q: Terminal - how to restart session after inadvertently exiting? Sometimes I inadvertently exit from a Terminal session (usually because I think I'm connected to a remote system, when I'm not), so I get to this point:\n\nHow I can I restart the session at this point ? I don't want to close the window or tab because I have a bunch of tabs all set up for my normal workflow, so I just want to get the session in the current tab going again (i.e. get back to a bash prompt).\nThe only solution I've found so far is to quit Terminal completely and open it again, but that is far from ideal as it obviously interrupts anything else I'm doing in other Terminal windows/tabs.\n\nA: William T Froggard's script did not do what I needed, because generally the only way I get into this situation is via ^D (ctrl+D), and redefining exit did nothing for that situation. For me, Dennis Williamson's suggestion of setting IGNOREEOF was enough. I just added:\n# Do not exit on a single ^D, require 2 in a row\nIGNOREEOF=1\n\nto my ~/.bashrc file and now (if I'm in the top-level shell and would exit the terminal) the first ^D generates the response:\nUse \"logout\" to leave the shell.\n\nIf I type ^D again immediately, the shell exits, so exiting when I want is still easy, but now a single ^D will give me a warning. (If you want, you can set IGNOREEOF to a higher number to require additional consecutive ^D's.)\nAlso helpful, if I'm in a sub-shell, the first ^D generates the response:\nUse \"exit\" to leave the shell.\n\nAgain, an extra ^D will get me out, and now I can tell the difference between exiting a sub-shell and exiting the top-level shell. \n\nA: At this point, there's no way to get the tab back. The terminal session is closed, and it no longer has a TTY. There's just no way to reference the tab in order to do anything clever. I'd suggest adding this function to your .bashrc or .profile so that you won't have the issue in the future:\nexit() {\n    read -t5 -n1 -p \"Do you really wish to exit? [yN] \" should_exit || should_exit=y\n    case $should_exit in\n        [Yy] ) builtin exit $1 ;;\n        * ) printf \"\\n\" ;;\n    esac\n}\n\nor, for those of us who use the Z Shell (add it to your .zshrc):\nexit() {\n    if read -t5 -q \"?Do you really wish to exit? [yN] \"; then\n        builtin exit $1\n    fi\n}\n\nIt's a nice little barrier between you and that annoying exit command!

I mean used USB stick with installer and fully erased disk.\nThen I created 5 partitions: One for OS X, one for Windows, two for Linux and one for Data:\n| OS X - 1 | Windows - 2 | Linux - 3 | Linux2 - 4 | **Data - 5** |\n\nThan I installed Linux and rEFInd to boot it. \nNext I installed Windows. But it was awful without drivers, so I boot into OS X and created USB stick with drivers with BOOTCAMP. I boot into windows again, installed drives, rebooted, and saw only disk C: and D:, which are Windows and OS X partitions.\nSo I booted in Linux, and created hybrid MBR on my own, adding only Windows and Data partitions to it.\nIt worked. I was able to use Data on any system.\nI had not booted windows for a week, and I installed OS X 10.11.2 update. And when I started Windows again, I could use only Windows and OS X partitions.\nI think that BootCamp assistant or some other OS X program recreated Hybrid MBR. But they add only first 4 partitions, and Data is fifth!\nHow could I stop OS X from restoring MBR? Maybe I could make it not to be able to see Windows or remove bootcamp?\nPS Sorry for my English\n\nA: Update 1\nI do not believe there is a way to keep OS X from updating the MBR table. It would appear that OS X relies on partition entries appearing in ascending order in the GPT. Also, OS X desires the index of each MBR partition entry to be the same as the partition entry in the GPT. Occasionally, when OS X finds a discrepancy, it will make a correction. \nUsers have found tools, such as gdisk, that allow editing of the MBR table. This will allow GPT entries with indices greater than 4 to appear in the MBR table. Fixes of this type are temporary since OS X may erase them at any time. Furthermore, El Captain (OS X 10.11), with SIP turned on (the default), will not let gdisk change the MBR table. Rod Smith has recently published changes to rEFInd which allow SIP to be turned on/off at boot time.\nSince you refer to a Hybrid GPT for use with Windows, I will assume you have a Mac dated before 2012. My Mac is a 2007 iMac. I have run Vista in 32 mode and Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10 in 64 bit mode. These installs were not from upgrades, but rather clean installs into freshly formatted partitions. In each case, the Device Manager showed all devices working properly after installing the Boot Camp Support Software. Also, no version of the Boot Camp Assistant was used to install Windows. However, due to the limitations of my Macs firmware, I am required to install Windows in BIOS/MBR mode.\nAlong with Windows and OS X, I have also installed 64 bit Ubuntu Linux. Since Windows needs to be installed in BIOS/MBR mode, I decided to install Ubuntu in EFI/GPT mode. Also, to aid in choosing an operating system at startup, I install rEFInd in its own partition.\nSo how many partitions does that make my Computer? Let's count.\n\n\n*\n\n*1 EFI partition FAT formatted.\n\n*2 Windows partitions NTFS formatted. (Sometimes I two different Windows installed) \n\n*1 Fat formatted partition for data.\n\n*1 OS X partition HFS+ formatted. ( I do not use Core Storage)\n\n*1 OS X recovery partition HFS+ formatted\n\n*1 HFS+ formatted partition (Sometimes I have an older OS X installed\nhere)\n\n*2 partitions needed for Ubuntu (currently empty, Ubuntu was installed)\n\n*1 small HFS+ partition for rEFInd.\n\n\nSince only Windows is required to use a BIOS/MBR scheme, it made sense to put all FAT and NTFS partitions first on my main drive. To do the same on a different computer depends on what equipment and software is available. In my case, I have 2 TB of external storage, a WinClone license, and a 40 MB/sec internet connection. I can boot OS X from the external storage which gives me the ability to image backup part or all of my internal disk and repartition as needed. \nOriginal Answer\nWell, the answer would seem obvious.\nPut the Windows and data partitions before the OS X and Linux partitions.\nI did this on my 2007 iMac and I have eliminated the problems you are having.\nThe easiest way to accomplish this is to install OS X on an external drive and boot from this drive. You then can repartition your internal drive. Then install OS X on the internal drive, followed by the other operating systems. This is what I did.\nTo explain what other installation options are available, I would need to know the model/year of your Mac.\n", "Q: iPad 2 asks to connect to iTunes while iTunes asks for passcode on iPad SCENARIO: \nI have an old iPad 2 (I think) model A1396 from a relative reclaiming an iTunes update. iPad screen is telling device is deactivated and should be connected to iTunes.\n\nWHAT I'VE TRIED\nI downloaded iTunes and connected the iPad, iTunes detects the iPad, but complains because I need to put the passcode in the iPad.\n\nPROBLEM \nI have the passcode, but the iPad screen is not asking for it, I can't unlock the screen and I just can restart the iPad, entering in this way in a vicious circle… sigh!\nQUESTION is: Is there some way to unlock the iPad to insert passcode and allow update via iTunes?.\n\nA: It seems that the reason the iPad is disabled and requires you to connect to iTunes to re-activate it is because the passcode was entered incorrectly too many times. \nIn this case, you'll need to erase the iPad, and unless you made a backup before the iPad got disabled, there isn't a way to save your device's data, and you'll lose all your data and settings.\nErase your device with recovery mode:\nIf you've never synced with iTunes or set up Find My iPhone in iCloud, you'll need to use recovery mode to restore your device. This will erase the device and its passcode.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iOS device to your computer and open iTunes.\n\n*While your device is connected, force restart it: Press and hold the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons at the same time. Don't let go when you see the Apple logo — keep holding until you see the recovery mode screen.\n\n\n*When you see the option to Restore or Update, choose Restore. \n\niTunes will download software for your device. If it takes more than 15 minutes, your device will exit recovery mode and you'll need to repeat steps 2 and 3.\n\n*Wait for the process to finish. Then you can set up and use your device.\nFor more info, check Apple's support article.\n", "Q: OS X automatically deleting files Before I made multiple cloud accounts available to backup my Mac, running OS X El Capitan, I saved every file in All My Files onto a 16 GB external SD card.\nI noticed that every few days everything on the SD card would seem to disappear.  Is there any explanation that could be had for this?\n\nA: Backing up specific folders instead of copying the disk images (I realized that's what 'All My Files' consists of) has allowed me to make permanent backups with different services and devices, including my SD card.\n", "Q: What is com.apple.bird? Why does it grow so big? When trying to clean up their hard disk, some users discover ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.bird is pretty big, sometimes in the order of many gigabytes. What is it?\n\nA: Bird is part of iCloud and the files in the folder might be owned by any app using iCloud.  I wrote a simple Python script to try and find out who owns the files in the directory:\n$ python blame-bird.py \n4R6749AYRE.com.pixelmatorteam.pixelmator            0.00MB\ncom.apple.shoebox                                   0.00MB\ncom.apple.TextInput                                 0.00MB\niCloud.com.apple.iBooks                             0.00MB\n57T9237FN3.net.whatsapp.WhatsApp                 6904.66MB\n\nAccounted for: 6904MB.  Still unaccounted: 1879MB\n\nSo on my Mac WhatsApp is the biggest culprit.  I filed a bug report with them (although I am not sure if it's really their fault).\n\nA: 'Bird' is part of the iCloud structure. You would have a large cache if there are pending documents to upload or process.\nOver time, the com.apple.bird cache is generally kept cleaner than you're thinking. Mine is 400 KB [that's K, not even M]\nYou can diagnose this with brctl - which has a diagnose command and a log command. Unless you are sure you have a bug in the cache - I wouldn't delete the files as they might cause you at best - another upload of the original content and at worst - cause errors or data loss of iCloud backed documents.\nWith that large a cache you should be able to dump and then monitor whatever categories/classes of data have the most size.\nbrctl dump\n\nIt's exceptionally verbose and you might not want to spend time learning what it does - but the data is quite helpful in determining what's actually happening and gives you an option before reaching out to AppleCare or another support tech in cases where you don't see the cache clearing itself over time.\n", "Q: Possibility of getting HealthKit data from third-party sensors in real-time? I have heard that HealthKit can be used to gather health-related data using the iPhone’s sensors in real-time, and I know that there are several third-party wearable biometric sensors that can interface with iOS and are supposed to be compatible with HealthKit (but it’s not clear to me whether that means they’re compatible with HealthKit itself or just the Health app). What I want to know is: does the HealthKit API provide a (relatively simple) way to access data from these external sensors in real-time as they're coming in? Or is it really only designed to do that for sensors that are already in the iOS device itself?\n\nA: From a user level - the health app consumes data that is stored in the HealthKit framework. From the developer and hardware manufacturer side, HealthKit framework is an API for them to do things reading and writing the data so that what you describe is clearly possible.\nEven watch OS streams live data - so that's a core feature of bluetooth low energy. Once the data is on iOS, it's a matter of the developer placing it under health kit control. This is something Apple expects and allows with their code and SDK/API.\nNow, not all data can be written to all areas - for instance, Apple's workout app doesn't allow third party contributions on Watch OS 1.0 and 2.0 but it does allow workout data to be stored in the database along with the Apple watch workout app data.\n", "Q: MacBook does not mount, does not boot, does not read drive When i press alt on my MacBook during startup, it only shows a disk that i used to have Windows installed (which is now empty).

I connected a device to my USB port, but it's unclear how much current it is drawing. Is there a way from the command line, or otherwise, to determine how much current that device is drawing?\n\nA: It's not likely that Apple would invest in ammeter circuitry in the usb power lines and connect it to the computer motherboard. \nIt's likely there is some form of current overload prevention (I wouldn't even know what. A polyfuse maybe?), but it wouldn't be something accessible to the operating system.\nCurrent draw information will more likely than not require additional hardware to obtain.\n", "Q: 2007 Macbook Pro will not boot to HDD I have a 2007 MacBook Pro running Yosemite from an off the net upgrade from Snow Leopard and the graphics went crazy while trying to watch a TV program on my Slingbox app. I forced a shut down by holding the power button down and now it will not boot up to the hard drive. upon trying to start it up, the initial startup tone is sounded, the apple pops up on the screen and the progress bar begins to load. Upon reaching about half way on the progress bar it stops loading and eventually goes to a black screen with an arrow cursor. I tried reloading the OS with the original Snow Leopard OS disc but got a pop up stating that the OS was not compatible. I then went to utilities and ran a disc permissions test, a disc permissions repair , and then a disc test but the it said the disc appeared to be OK. It still will not boot and is still only loading about half of the loading start up bar. Anybody have any ideas? I think the hard drive may be toast but I really would love to load some of the pictures and desktop info on to an external drive but don't have a clue on how to proceed.\n\n\nA: It appears that your drive is failing. Your best bet is to attempt to clone the drive to prevent data loss. If you're unsure how to proceed, your next best bet is to run fsck, which can, in some cases, fix any formatting issues on the drive (but NOT physical ones). This Apple support article will give you a good walk through of the troubleshooting steps, but again, best to try to rescue data if you don't have a back up before going forward. \n\nA: Step one in proceeding is to start up in verbose mode (hold down Command-V) as you start your Mac, and then post the last few lines of output here. Sorry--I'd add this as a comment instead of an answer, but I don't have the reputation yet.\nWhen you start up the Mac it should display text as it boots (white text on a black background). The last few messages may indicate the problem. See the example image below where I've highlighted an error in red.\n\nIf the cause of the problem turns out to be a hard drive failure, I would recommend recovering as much data as you can from the hard drive. One way to do this is to connect your laptop to another Mac and boot the laptop into Firewire Target Disk Mode. Then use a data recovery program such as ddrescue to copy the data from your failing hard drive to a disk image on the Mac you're using for recovery. If you or a friend don't have another Mac with Firewire, you may be able to remove the hard drive from your laptop and plug it into another computer with a USB to SATA adapter. If you have more questions about ddrescue, it might be better to start a new question.\nKeep in mind, that for some kinds of disk damage, the more you access the disk the more likely it is to fail completely. I just recovered 1.2 TB of my data from a 3 TB drive before it failed completely. Fortunately, all my data was in that first 1.2 TB.\n", "Q: OpenOffice multiple launcher in launchpad/dock I recently installed the OpenOffice 4 on my Mac and I use it also on Linux (CentOS 6.5 / Gnome2).\nOn Linux, after the installation, I got a specific shortcut (launcher) for every Office application (Spreadsheet, Text Document, Presentation, and so on) but on MacOSX I have only one launcher and I have to select the type of application afterwards.\nIs there any way to install all shortcuts individually in the Launchpad and in the Dock as well like it is in the Office menu of Gnome under Linux?  \n\nA: Unfortunately, I believe this isn't possible, not because of a Mac issue, but because the OpenOffice team chose to have it work this way.    \nI had found this site here which provided some app launch icons, though it seems it may be out of date and these may no longer work.   \nThe site does have a \"workaround\" posted...  which is the following:\nJust an FYI. I have found that in OpenOffice 3.2 running on Windows there is an openoffice icon in the system tray that when right clicked allows you to open any individual application directly. On a Mac simply keeping the openoffice icon in the dock and then right clicking it gives you the same capability.\nGiven this... it seems OpenOffice decided that the \"right way\" to access a specific app from the dock is right-clicking and then picking the one you want.   \nNot exactly what you are looking for...  but might be the closest you'll get.\n", "Q: Trouble importing videos to iMovie from Canon Vixia HF R600 I have a Canon HF R600, and when I open iMovie 10, I can see my camera listed, but there are no videos displayed. When I look on the camera, though, there are a bunch of files. Why aren't the files popping up?\n\nA: If you open finder, look in the storage card instead of using imovie. Sometimes the camera makers store files in other directories than the one indicated for current images \nIf you can find the files, drag them to a desktop folder and try importing them from your folder instead of directly from the card. Once things are all saved, using the camera or the Mac to reformat the media usually clears up the multiple folder confusion. \n", "Q: Safari update message on my Mac, why is it there for four days? When I click on Safari I get message telling me:\n\n\"Safari is being updated... Safari can not be opened while it is being updated\" \n\nWhen will updating Safari be finished on my computer? I need to use it and it has been updating for four days now. What do I do now to use Safari?\n\nA: This will work with any stuck update from the app store, btw, just change the names of the stuff to delete.\nFirst thing to try: clear the app store updates folder at Macintosh HD/Library/Updates\nSecond thing to try: Open Terminal (Applications > Utilities > Terminal) and paste this: open $TMPDIR../C and in there, delete anything that has the name com.apple.appstore then do the same in Terminal with this command: open $TMPDIR../T\nThird thing to try: Open Disk Utility (Same place as Terminal), select your hard drive and run Fix Permissions.\nOne of those should do it.\n\nA: It appears that the update died prematurely and didn't clean up, so the system thinks it's still being updated. After completing the update, the locks will be cleaned up and you'll be able to open Safari again.  From the Terminal, execute:\nopen /Library/Updates/*/ApplicationLoader.pkg\n\nThat should pop open a window with the usual installer.  Go through the motions to install the package.  Once it's done, you should be able to run Safari.\nHere's where I got the solution myself.\n", "Q: Apple Watch Heart Rate Glance Shows Same Number Every Time, Or Series Of Random Numbers, Also On Replacement Watch Whenever I check my resting heart rate using the Watch's heart rate glance, it does one of two things:\n1) I see one low number (which sometimes seems accurate, e.g., ~70).\nA couple of seconds later, the heart rate shown on the screen jumps up to 107 or 121.  It does this every single time; it either shows the lower number first then jumps, or goes straight to 107, or 121, but it's always the same number-107 or 121.\nOR \n2) I get a series of wildly fluctuating numbers, which are way too high, e.g., 138, 159, 174, etc.  It's usually something random and usually high numbers.  Taking my heart rate manually shows the numbers to be way off.\nI tried doing an unpair (erase) of the Watch several times.  An AppleCare technician attempted to run a diagnostic on the Watch multiple times, but was only able to run a diagnostic on the iPhone (6S Plus).  He could not reach the Watch, which only went to the diagnostics' \"Waiting\" screen one time out of about ten tries.\nSo Apple shipped out a new watch.  Here's the kicker:\nI immediately set up the new watch, and after the setup was complete, the exact same thing is occurring.\nThis issue has also persisted across (the first Watch) being paired with two different iPhones (a 6 Plus and a 6S Plus, both new), so I think that minimizes a physical defect in the phone being an issue.  The Watch was of course unpaired and reset in-between phone changes, multiple times.\nI am interested, among other things, about the security aspect of this particular problem.\nEdit:\nI did see the articles about tattoos. I don't have any tattoos or scars. I wear it tight (it was fitted at an Apple Store). Furthermore, I found a new angle on this: with both watches, if I hold the watch in the air (not against skin or anything else), they give these same multiple BPM readings that look simulated. I work in a security-related field and call me paranoid, but I think the Watch has been rooted. I've ruled out two new Watches, two new iPhones, multiple resets (and set up as new), and now myself (and the watch dangling in the air, apparently)\n\nA: If the watches are different, and the phones are different, then the only thing that appears to remain the same is you.\nYou don't mention, but have you ruled out the possibility of there being anything about you? For instance, I remember reading that tattoos could prevent the heart monitor obtaining a clear reading, and there was some talk about people with very black skin also having difficulties. Example article here http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-32537030\nThe other possibility is whether there is something with the tightness with which you wear it?\n", "Q: Why does opening AirPort Utility restore my internet connection? My office has a D-Link router hooked up to DSL. Connected to it via Ethernet is an Airport Extreme (6th generation). The Airport Extreme is the wireless router to which my MacBook and other users connect. It's in DHCP and NAT mode, in case that's relevant.\nEvery once in a while (maybe once every one or two weeks), my internet connection stops working, though the Wi-Fi icon in my menu bar still shows full strength. I used to reflexively disable and enable Wi-Fi, which would reliably fix the problem.\nThe past few times I wanted to investigate further, so instead of disabling Wi-Fi, I try pinging the Airport Extreme at 192.168.2.1, and I get \"Request timeout for icmp_seq\". Then I open AirPort Utility. However, the moment I open Airport Utility, everything reliably starts working again, and pings start coming back acked. I'm pretty sure it's the act of opening Airport Utility that's triggering this, as I can wait a variable length of time before opening it. What's going on here?\nI'm on an early 2015 13-inch retina MacBook Pro running OS X 10.11.1.\n\nA: Can you try disabling the DHCP and NAT and putting the device into Bridge Mode? Since the D-Link is functioning as the router there's no reason to double NAT (this is generally considered bad) and that's the only thing that's strange about your setup that could be causing this behavior.\n", "Q: Is there a way to set the dock height in fixed pixels?

It only allows web access to a list of websites and blocks all others. Recently, however, it has been switched to \"Try to limit access to adult websites\". When I switch this back to \"Allow access to only these websites\" and then close the preference pane, when I go back to it, the changes I've made are not saved. No changes that I make to the Parental Controls profile are saved upon simply exiting the pane and going back to it.\nI figured it was a permissions error but fixing permissions did not solve the problem. I've removed the com.apple.mcx.plist file from the user folder, removed the user folder from the Library/Managed Preferences folder and neither of these things has changed anything. I'm at a loss here on how to fix it. Thank you for your time.\n\nA: The following steps seem to have resolved this issue for me.  (Sadly I don't know if this will help anyone else, since the whole Parental controls system seems very complex and buggy, and I don't really understand what is happening here.  But I thought I'd note it here anyway.)\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete all unnecessary user accounts (created during testing).\n\n*On all remaining accounts, tick \"Allow user to administer this computer\".  (Here, I'm trying to ensure Parental Controls is disabled on all accounts and hopefully cause some kind of reset, since I'd noticed that a new managed account I'd created had the same issue - and so the issue wasn't with the individual accounts, it was with the entire machine.)\n\n*Reboot.\n\n*On the account that needs to managed, untick \"Allow user to administer this computer\".

I'm not sure what it's for; but I came across an article that showed how to turn it off in Keychain Access Preferences. \nI'm not sure if this raises any problems. Any suggestions?\n\n\nA: OCSP (and its performing daemon ocspd) as well as CRL are two different but similar methods to check the revocation status of public certificates and are part of the PKI (public key infrastructure).\nThe revocation status (beyond other statuses) determines the validity of a certificate.\nThe revocation status of a certificate may be good, unknown or revoked. The status will be changed from good to revoked if the publishing CA (certificate authority) or the certificate itself was compromised (e.g. the CA was hacked or the private key of a certificate was stolen or was published by accident).\nUsing a revoked certificate (without knowing that it was invalidated) on the client side may compromise its security.\nYou are strongly advised to enable OCSP and CRL and prioritize OCSP.\n\nAddendum:\nI supervised the needed bandwidth of ocspd with Little Snitch.\nBy searching for ocspd in the network monitor, marking the process and hitting the info button (highlighted in red) I get the total traffic.\n\n\nAfter an uptime of ~5 hours I get 3.97 kB outgoing and 23 kB incoming traffic.\nYou may download and install Little Snitch and hunt down the culprit yourself. Besides the whole traffic of the process you can get the traffic to and from a single host also by choosing one them.

If not you could try a commercial product like DiskWarrior, Drive Genius, or Data Rescue.\nUnless you do a destructive delete, files are never actually deleted and as long as you don't save anything else to the disks the files are still there and have not been overwritten.

So what about the 's' character meaning in 5s and 6s series of iPhone?\n\nA: The iPhone 5s \"s\" apparently stands for security (they added touch ID), but the \"s\" in iPhone 6s is still largely debated, though some have speculated that it might be for sensitivity (as per the new 3D Touch features)\nHowever, apple has never really released any official information regarding what the s stands for in any models other than the 3GS and 4s.\nBut really, I don't think apple plans what the s stands for, it is just a symbol to show that this model has improvements upon its predecessor, but is not altogether different. \n\nA: It's debatable. \nSome say the \"s\" always stands for \"successor\". Like how the 6s makes great improvements on the 6, but since it doesn't have a new design, Apple shouldn't really call it the iPhone 7.\nHowever, Phil Schiller, at the iPhone 3GS release event, said specifically that the S in 3GS stood for \"speed\", based on how much faster it was than the 3G.\nFans also sometimes make up their own meanings for what the s stands for:\niPhone 4s: Siri\niPhone 5s: Security (for TouchID)\nHowever, at this point, Apple's naming scheme is set after almost a decade and they'll just give every other iPhone name an s, so it likely does just mean successor.\n\nA: s stands for \"We don't really have enough features to release a new iPhone, but we're gonna do it anyway.\"\n\nA: the \"S\" stands for 'Same' IPhone 5Same\n", "Q: How to remove locally stored Exchange emails? VIP in company who uses several people's mail boxes purchased Mac Air. Outlook 2011 by default insists on locally storing everything.\n50k+ items, plus attachments later the HDD is full. I've set the accounts to download headers only, but the HDD is still full. How do I remove the locally stored mail, because it's still on the exchange server where it belongs?\nThe computer is so full it can't really do anything anymore and I can only come to this Office once before Christmas.\n\nA: Outlook 2011 cannot disable storing the email locally. Your best alternative would be to access the email using Outlook Web Access (if it is enabled).\n", "Q: How do you remove SSL certificate exceptions on OS X? When connecting to a URL via HTTPS and the SSL certificate doesn't match (such as at a paid Wi-Fi hotspot), Safari shows a dialog asking whether the certificate should be accepted. If you accept the certificate, OS X adds an SSL exception and will never ask about that certificate again.\nThe question is, where is that exception stored? And how can I get rid of it?\nNote that this question is essentially the OS X version of “How do you remove SSL certificate exceptions on iOS?”, however the iOS answers make no sense for OS X.\n\nA: The exceptions are stored in Keychain Access. The certificate will be copied there, together with the trust settings. Double-click a certificate and you will be able to change it's settings. Note: you can have trust setting on system level and user level! They have separate keychains as listed in the sidebar.\n\nA: The other answer didn't work for me. A method that work for me is to open the \"Keychain Access\" app (which can be found through Spotlight Search), then click the \"Certificates\" category. Then right-click on the certificate you want to delete and delete it.\n", "Q: How to make NumLock/numpad cursor keys work on an external USB keyboard? I have a Genius USB \"partial\" keyboard - a numpad like this one.\nIt types digits and +-/*, but doesn't switch to cursor mode with NumLock off, and Home/End/PgUp/PgDn keys were the reason I purchased it.\nHow do I make Home/End/other cursor keys work?\n\n*\n\n*Sometimes USB keyboards don't work if Mouse Keys in Mouse Settings is on. Mine is off.\n\n*Sometimes hitting Clear key on the keyboard helps. I don't have it.\n\n*Ukelele doesn't have the numpad keys to edit.\n\n*Karabiner (ex KeyRemap4MacBook) doesn't have a ready feature for this.\n\nThe solution according to this answer seems to be Karabiner. Though, it looks pretty advanced and I didn't find it in half an hour.\n\nA: OS X does not understand 'Num lock'. There's no on-off state for Num lock in OS X and as such can be thought to be always on.\nThe Num lock button itself on a Windows keyboard is interpreted as Clear in OS X. You are able to bind this to actions in Keyboard Maestro, but a 'state switch' would essentially require saving a variable in Keyboard Maestro to be checked when a button is pressed, then intercepting the action and providing its own key press.\n\nA: I had a similar issue and made my complex_modifications for Karabiner Elements available in a pull request here: https://github.com/pqrs-org/KE-complex_modifications/pull/509\n\nA: With the latest karabiner, there is a defined complex rule to enable this rather easily. You just need to import and enable these rules:\nhttps://ke-complex-modifications.pqrs.org/#numpad\n\nA: After a better look, I found it in Karabiner: \"For PC users\" - \"Use KeyPad as Arrow\" - \"Enable KeyPad as Arrow\".\nI'll leave the question here, it might be useful for someone else.\nUpdate: Karabiner-Elements, which is the only Karabiner for Sierra+, is a new product. In Karabiner-Elements, I just added a mapping from every numpad key to its function, for external keyboard. \n\nA: Here's what I put in my private.xml file (using Karabiner.app), and it allows the following functionality:   \nUse a generic external numerical keypad with Mac OS X, and Num Lock on/off toggles number vs arrow/Home/End/PgUp/PgDn functionality.  Num Lock light turns on/off as appropriate as well :-)\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n    <item>\n        <name>Toggle Numbers/Arrows</name>\n        <identifier>private.toggle_numbers_arrows</identifier>\n        <autogen>\n            __KeyToKey__ KeyCode::KEYPAD_CLEAR, \n            KeyCode::VK_CONFIG_TOGGLE_remap_keypadnumlock, \n            KeyCode::VK_IOHIKEYBOARD_TOGGLE_NUMLOCK,\n            KeyCode::VK_IOHIKEYBOARD_TOGGLE_NUMLOCK,\n            KeyCode::VK_IOHIKEYBOARD_TOGGLE_NUMLOCK\n        </autogen>\n    </item>\n</root>\n\nAs you can see, I needed to include the \"...TOGGLE_NUMLOCK\" three times to get the Num Lock LED status to appropriately indicate the state (otherwise it was backwards, whereas it would be lit for arrow functions and dark for numbers).  Maybe there's a simple way to fix it, but the hack works perfectly for me.

Moving items between keychains usually works with drag and drop, but I cannot drag an item from iCloud keychain to another keychain. I can start dragging, but the items then disappears from my cursor. I am also happy with a command line solution.\nI am using OS X 10.11.2 (El Capitan).\n\nA: From comments, it appears Apple may have forgotten to include drag & drop - or maybe it's intentional…\nEither way - you can right click Copy, then change to the Login keychain & right click Paste.\nYou can then delete the original.\nYou will need to re-grant access to Safari by inspecting the item [double click] selecting the access tab & adding Safari to the list of programs.\n", "Q: Delete a location from time machine I have a folder in ~/Downloads/Media with lot of media files backed up in time machine.

I want to remove the location permanently. \n\nA: Open System Prefs > Time Machine, then click Options…\nYou can add exclusions to the list, by clicking the + & navigating to the location, or simply by dragging any folder/drive etc into the box.\n\nIt would appear that anything already backed up will stay in the older backups until eventually it just 'falls off' over time, as Time Machine cycles through your drive space.\n", "Q: Unlock iphone 4s My iphone 4s was orignally with orange, latterly with virgin.

I use LaunchBar for that but AppleScript/Automator and the gold standard for scripting input - TextExpander - would be worth investigating if you want more advanced options. The steps to configure each of these depends on which app you select to control your Mac.\nYou can see the apps you have that are able to control (enter text at the insertion point in your case) by opening the Security & Privacy preference pane and selecting Privacy and then selecting Accessibility.\n\nA: If you are talking about the current text-caret position, I would have suggested that your application put the output in the copy/paste-buffer and that you make an Automater Service that opens the application.\nCheck this tutorial on how to do this: http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-launch-any-app-with-a-keyboard-shortcut--mac-31463\n", "Q: Switch vibrations for all notifications except phone calls in silent mode I would like to receive any type of notifications (e.g.: WhatsApp message notifications) without  vibration.

The only problem that I cannot get my head round is that it all works fine but I received an email this morning, and when I clicked on it to read it, the screen just went back to the home page. All other emails I have received are fine and can open and be read no problem, but for this one email every time I try to open it the screen continues to go to the home screen.\n\nA: When the screen goes back to the home page, it means that Microsoft Office Mail is crashing because of some problem. \nIn this case, the email that you're trying to open contains something that causes the app to crash. This is an issue with Microsoft Office Mail, and not with your iPhone. The only solution right now is to either open this email on your computer, or wait for Microsoft to fix this bug in a future update.\n\nA: The email probably contains some kind of file that your phone doesn't know how to handle, or it could contain some kind of virus.

Every time I type my account name (located at the top right of my screen) and my login password it isn't correct.\nI must have deleted my original account and I can't remember the name for it. Is there any way I will be able to find out?\n\nA: If you end up needing to make a new admin account, there are several threads here covering that. I'd start with this one:\n\n\n*\n\n*I don't have administrator account on my mac\nYou can open the system preferences and look over all the users and groups.

How do I see a list of all running processes/tasks on macOS/OS X?\n\nA: The app /Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor is what you're looking for. If you use the command line in Terminal, the top command is useful too. In Terminal, type man top to see the various options. Activity Monitor shows you a wealth of information about each process.\n\nA: You can use \ntop -o cpu\nor  \ntop -o rsize\nor \nps aux\n\nA: Inside Terminal, you can type ps aux\n\nTerminal is available under the utilities folder in the App folder.\n\nA: Applications / Utilities > Activity Monitor\n\n\nA: To see the process names just by themselves with quotes and new lines, try this in Terminal:\nps axc | sed \"s/.*:..... /\\\"/\" | sed s/$/\\\"/\n\n\nA: Try top -o +state, it will show all the running processes in the top of the 'top', however, below it will also show the sleeping processes.\n\nA: You can use top -o mem inside terminal, to see running processes\n\nA: Note: This solution requires pstree to be installed from either  MacPorts (sudo port install pstree) or Homebrew (brew install pstree) first.\nTo understand the relationship between processes, pstree is your friend. Without any switches it will show ALL processes.\nHowever, that produces quite some verbose output. To help narrow the search space for the issue, you can use the -u switch, to limit output to puke out only your own processes:\npstree -u YourUserName\nI had high CPU activity and wanted to see what I did that was triggering it, so being able to see how processes were chained (spawned) was more interesting to me.\nAnyhoo, hope this helps you narrow to isolate the cause of a system issue quicker.\n\nA: If you need something in text mode but ps and top aren't good enough for you then try htop (installable with brew install htop) — it will interactively show the list of proceses (similar to Activity Monitor), as well as allow to do the following:\n\n*\n\n*filter processes by name with /\n\n*kill with k\n\n*inspect a process with lsof with L\n\n*show the process tree hierarchy with t\n\n*sort by CPU, state, priority, memory, etc with F6\n\n*display CPU load per each core\n\n\nA: Okay, look what I found:\nYou can use \n - Dock\n - Launch Menu (Just press Command + Option + ESC)\n - Install special app for that (e.g. Activity Monitor)\n - Look using terminal\n - Or use console commands \nand that is not the full list!

Is it possible to generate a new certificate with the same old private key?\n\nA: No - spoofing the key signature would be equivalent to bypassing the chain of trust entirely. You'd probably be able to sell that exploit to bad actors and governments for a lot of money.\nYou will need to re-sign the apps and likely increment the version numbers on them before pushing them out since Apple doesn't re-sign things for you dynamically as they do with App store downloads.\n", "Q: Where to find OpenSSL devel package - can't seem to find it in Brew I'm trying to install openssl-devel on OS X El Capitan, and I can't seem to find the package on Brew nor the source anywhere online.

I do see setting hostname change in the console.\nnetwork changed: v4(en1!:my ip address from phone) DNS+ Proxy+ SMB\nconfigd[24]: setting hostname to  \"Johns-MBP-2\" \n\nIs this from changing internet connections or could this be from malicious software? Or is this because I changed Wi-Fi credentials and opened new terminal windows when I had previous ones open from when I was using the other Wi-Fi networks?\n\nA: This is a bug in the implementation of iOS/OS X in my eyes. What used to be a good thing is now a pain in the behind.\n\n\n*\n\n*Computer name keeps changing OSX 10.10 (14A389)\n\n*Why does an iPhone rename itself with (2)\n\n*My Mac mini's computer name keeps changing when it resumes from sleep\nThis has been something that people of Apple products have been dealing with since 2012 on a widespread basis. It's easier to fix on OS X where you can call the scutil command:\nscutil --get ComputerName\nscutil --set ComputerName \"Whatever You Wish\"\n\nThe only positive thing is that in some cases, people depend on host names so making the change visible in the terminal has some benefit for them, but it sure causes a lot of worry and concern when people see names they have chosen being ignored and reassigned/modified without any reasonable explanation as to why being presented to the user. On the practical end, there is absolutely no good way to prevent this renaming - either setting things up on the network router side or on OS X side given that the OS manage IPv4 and IPv6 and AirDrop and bluetooth networks and shuffle the network settings to accommodate many clients.\n\nA: If you have another computer with the same hostname (probably on the network) your hostname might change.\nOne way this can happen (speaking from experience) is if you restore from a backup or some similar method, especially if you use Time Machine, because your TM backup is associated with the computer name and to avoid conflict your computer name won't be set to the existing hostname.\nYou can change your computer name by going to  Menu > System Preferences > Sharing > Computer name (at the top) (this name appears on AirDrop).\nYour hostname will automatically be changed to be the same name (you can see it under the text box). If you want to change it, click \"Edit...\" under the text box.\n\nA: Usually this is an effect you have in networks, where a so called DHCP server assigns dynamically network adresses to your devices. Additionally the DHCP server often also works as DNS server. For that it maintains a table with all the IP adresses already leased to the devices and their resp. Media adress (MAC Adress) and sometime the hostnames. Every entry has a lease time, after expiration the IP adress will be set free again and put back into the pool of available and assignable IP adresses.\nNow you came along with your Mac and it is configured with a hostname \"John's MBP\" and you have been in the network before. IP Adress fetching is set up to by dynamic. Your Mac now gets an IP adress assigned to from your DHCP server and in parallel your MBP asks the DHCP server about the DNS entry about \"John's MBP\". Looking in its lease table, the DHCP server answers 1.2.3.4 because your MBP was some time ago within the lease time in this network.\nNow MacOS is too stupid to realize it is the same entry that was put in the DHCP DNS table hours ago because the same device requested an IP adresse. To respect Bonjour broadcasting and therefore also AirDrop, it decides to switch the hostname and to add a number at the end of the hostname in case the original \"John's MBP\" will be back again in an unknown time and that would lead to Bonjour chaos. \nThat is the reason why configd changes your hostname. This happens always in DHCP and dynamic DNS table environments all the time. I stopped counting and opening tickets at tech support in my company. Currently my MBP has a counter at the hostname of 16. Nothing bad so far, no malware, no error, only devops stupidity in MacOS and DHCP dynamic DNS computing. :-)\n", "Q: How can I see Windows PCs on a Mac and vice versa on a home network? I have an iMac running El Capitan, an Intel NUC with Windows 10 and a Raspberry Pi running OpenELEC (for now, but I've also tried OSMC and Raspbmc). I have a simple WiFi network with no Windows domain or anything. \nThe Mac and the Pi can see each other in their network browsers, but not the NUC. The NUC's Network only shows the NUC. All of them are in the same workgroup (WORKGROUP) and all of them can ping each other. On the Mac, I can use Finder's 'Connect to Server...' option to add smb://10.0.0.199/sharename (which is the IP of the NUC) to access a share alright, and I can open \\\\10.0.0.99 on the NUC to access the Mac alright too. But the Windows computer(s) don't show icons for the Macs in the 'Network Neighborhood' equivalent and the Mac and Linux (Pi) computers don't show the Windows PCs.\nConfiguring networks and sharing on Windows has always been a trial-and-error process for me. Just mess with various settings till something works and that's how I've even gotten these machines to ping or access each other.\nWhat am I doing wrong? Is there a guide to setting up a non-domain network the proper way with mixed platforms?\n\nA: You need to specifically enable Windows File Sharing on the Mac.\nBy default just checking 'File Sharing' will enable [I think, it's been a long time since I set up a raw machine] SMB & AFP, but not specifically Windows.\nSystem Prefs > Sharing > Options…  \n\nIf you need to specify a Workgroup, that's done from Network > Advanced… > WINS\n\nOne thing to be aware of is that if one of your non-Mac machines isn't set to be Master Browser, then the Mac can often force an election & win, even if it wasn't supposed to.\nDepending on which machine is most likely to be on at all times, you may need to force that to be the Local Master.\nThis is a good article on how to set it on multiple platforms - http://petestechblog.com/archives/847 - there's a bit much to précis here.\n\nA: I fixed it.\nThe problem was a silly little one, which I so sure wasn't the case, I didn't even bother to look when I did think of it.\nThe NUC Subnet Mask was set to 255.0.0.0 for some reason. Everything else is using the default 255.255.255.0.

Could anyone help me with that?\n\nA: You can't simply open Install OS X Yosemite.app and install Yosemite somewhere if your Mac is booted to OS X El Capitan. The installer app will obstruct this. You have to use a detour:\nDownload the Install OS X Yosemite.app from the App Store. The Yosemite installer must be \"purchased\" previously. You will find it in your purchase list then and you can re-download it. Create a bootable installer thumb drive:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ Yosemite.app\n\nYou may have to replace the proper path to Install OS X Yosemite.app and the name of your thumb drive in /Volumes/MyVolume in the above command.\nReboot to the bootable installer thumb drive. After starting the installation you will be asked where to install Yosemite. Choose an empty partition which mustn't contain an El Capitan operating system. You may also install to a second thumb drive (> 16 GB).\n", "Q: USB Bootcamp: INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE i'm on a late 2012 iMac (15C50) and created a Windows 10 Bootcamp installation which worked fine. I transferred it to a external USB SSD with Winclone 5 which basically worked. I can still select it as a boot target in system settings and it starts to boot. While booting i get a blue screen with INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE Error.\nDoes anyone know of a chance to get that fixed? I can boot into recovery mode sometimes (Recovery with network works most of the time). But normal boot definitely fails every time with the same error.\nIs this probably a general incompatibility from my external drive case (I tried two from Inateck) with EFI Boot procedure or am i just missing some Windows drivers?\nAny hint is appreciated.\n\nA: You need to go into regedit and change the registry hardware config / boot driver flag to a 14 hex value before you clone the drive to the external usb drive.

Any assistance or guidance would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: If brew doctor doesn't run, then you have some breakage in the PATH variable on the system or you need to re-run the installer package, perhaps cleaning up things according to the support site for homebrew.\nYou can check where the brew command is with:\nwhich brew\ntype brew\n\nBoth of those should point to a command located at: /usr/local/bin/brew and the path /usr/local/bin should be in your path variable. To test that, quit terminal and open a new window. The set command below should look like the one I pasted with \"mac\" and \"me\" different for you in all likelihood.\nmac:~ me$ set | grep -i PATH\nPATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n\nSince this is how the system should be set up out of the box, if you have made modifications you'll want to look over the site for ways to debug a broken path. Your text seems to indicate that the path is set correctly, but that's the cause of command not found or the brew script itself is somehow corrupted - but that script is in /bin/sh not bash so I would expect a different error if it's messed up in some manner.\n", "Q: Deleted photos from MacBook but storage space not reclaimed I recently ran out of space on my MacBook Pro because I have a lot of pictures saved to it, so I went out and bought an external hard drive (2 TB).\nI moved every single photo on my MacBook hard drive to the external hard drive and deleted all the photo copies remaining on my macbook drive. Currently there are 0 photos on my MacBook drive, yet I keep receiving a message saying my disk is critically low on space. When I check what is taking up that space, its all photos, about 49.83 GB to be exact.\nThis is really frustrating as I searched my entire MacBook drive for any remaining photos, yet I can't find a single one even though it says that Photos are taking up about 50 GB of space on my MacBook hard drive. I am a photographer if you are wondering why I have that many photos, and keeping that in mind I also thought maybe it's my Lightroom catalogs thats taking up space. I moved my entire catalog folder into my external hard drive and deleted the original from my MacBook to make space, but that only created about 2.98 GB of space.\nSomeone told me I should turn off my Time Machine and delete all my backups, but I can't seem to find where the turn off button is.\n\nA: Photos has its own Photos trash, so when you remove pictures, they don't go to the normal trash bin, but to the Photos trash within the app. So as you delete pictures you don't reduce the size of the app until you empty the Photos trash.\nThis was making my crazy until i figured it out!\nOn the current Photos app, the Recently Deleted folder is available from the left-hand folders pane. On earlier versions it's available from the File menu, under \"Show Recently Deleted\".\n\nA: Did you empty Trash (Recycle Bin for Mac) (After moving your files to the external HDD?\nIf you have Time Machine setup on your primary HDD (where your OS X is setup), setup it up on another HDD (External HDD).\n\nA: Images or videos in Photos are firstly moved to folder Recently Deleted once deleted. Photos will automatically delete it permanently after 30 days. It is indeed an application level trash bin in Photos. There is a button, which allows you to delete items without waiting for the 30 days count down.\nHowever, Photos does not reclaim disk spaces immediately after you empty the Recently Deleted folder. Keep Photos opened. It will reclaim disk spaces slowly. I believe that they are the image caches, thumbnails, indices for searching and all other metadata files being cleaned up in the background. So, if you are on a MacBook, connect to the ac power and just don't put your MacBook and hard disks on sleep. \nAlternatively, if you have already moved the entire library and just clean up the whole, close Photos first. Hold down key option and invoke Photos again. Choose Create New... to create a blank Photos library. Then close Photos. With Finder, delete the old \"Photos Library.photoslibrary\" and rename your blank library with that directory name.\nI'm running High Sierra and having Time Machine backups. This works for me. \n\nA: If you're running against a wall thinking it's photos, instead find the folders with the largest usage:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder\n\n*Go to Computer (Command + Shift + C or use the Go menu)\n\n*Sort by List view (Command + 2)\n\n*Open preferences (Command + J)\n\n*Check the Calculate all sizes control at the bottom of the preference window and close the pref window\n\n*Click on the size column in the window to have the largest items at the top of the finder window\n\n*Then use the triangles next to the folder to see where the disk storage is actually being used.\n\n\nYou can focus on folders with 20 GB or larger and make a list of things - perhaps asking a follow on question if you have things in ~/Library that need clearing up. Those generally come back or break things, so don't just trash them directly without doing some research on what exactly you are deleting.\nAlso, the calculation can take some time, so once you have enabled that, maybe go make a cup of tea or coffee while Finder crawls the filesystem to add up the files in your home folder and elsewhere to show you what's taking up the storage.\nAlso, your library folder is normally hidden so perhaps open a second finder window to show the sizes there:\n\n\n*\n\n*hold option and command and use the go menu in finder to choose Library\n\n*repeat the preferences to calculate all sizes\n\n\nIt wouldn't be unusual to have 25 GB of containers and caches for iTunes, iBooks and Xcode if you are using those applications on this Mac or with iCloud storage.\n\nA: The Photo application moves all pictures in a special folder called \"Recently Deleted\". They will be kept on your computer for 30 days. After the 30 days period the pictures will be deleted and the space freed. If you want to free space earlier you will have to click on that folder and deleted again.\n", "Q: My iPhone storage space is never released I have an iPhone 5c with 8GB of storage, out of which approximately 3GB is taken by the operating system.\nI've always had issues with running out of space, notwithstanding the very few things I keep stored on it, but since some days I'm having the whole memory completely taken and I'm unable to take any picture.\nI keep on deleting files (e.g. I delete media from WhatsApp/Messages and I move pictures from the iPhone to iCloud), but still the memory is never released and always stated as 100% taken, and I'm talking about a significant amount of files deleted/moved (approx. 200 photos and 10 videos).\nI hence try to restart the device, close the applications (trying more generally to make the OS re-initializing the memory stats), but still no luck. The only (weird) thing that makes the memory release a bit is when changing the language.\nMy operating system is iOS 9.0.\nI'm wondering what's going on, are the deleted/moved files cached somewhere? Is there any effective way to completely release their memory cells and get back my memory?\n\nA: Open the Settings App on your iPhone, go to Photos & Camera.\nUnder the mentioned menu, you will see 2 options: Optimize iPhone Storage and Download and Keep Originals.\nIf Download and Keep Originals is selected, this is the cause of your issue.\nChoose Optimize iPhone Storage. (Be sure that your Photos are Synced/Backed up on iCloud or on your PC or Mac - This option should not delete any photos from iCloud, but just to be safe).\nHope my answer solves your issue. I checked the settings on my iPhone 6s 64gb.\n", "Q: Irrelevant outdated update stuck in App Store I upgraded to OS 10.11 which gave me a new version of iPhoto. However, an older version of iPhoto v9.6.1 is stuck in the App Store and I get periodic alerts that it is available for upgrade. When I try to accept the upgrade to hopefully clear it out, I'm told \"Update unavailable with this Apple ID\".\nHow do I get rid of this outdated \"update\"?\n\nA: The app store searches all available drives to update software. You would want to use spotlight to find and delete all copies of that software or set up a privacy to tell spotlight not to index the location where you store an old copy of an app.\nOpen Spotlight preferences and add an exclusion for the folder containing the app.\nAnother remote possibility is if spotlight itself is confused / in error - you might need to exclude the entire drive to wipe the bad search results and then remove the exclusion and let spotlight re-build the entire search index for your drive(s).\n", "Q: How to delete all \"Audio\" files from my MacBook Through the disk utility, I can see I have over 10 GB of \"Audio\" files.\nWhen I search on Finder for music files (kind \"Music\") no more than 10 MB comes.\nWhat exactly is considered to be \"Audio\" files?\nHow can I free up those 10GB?\n\nA: From within Finder, select the search box at the top right corner of the window and type Audio; a list will popup, near the bottom of which will be Kinds and Audio. Select that type, and then for the scope, select This Mac. This will show all the files on your Mac (at least within your Spotlight search's view) that OS X considers to be audio files.\nYou should be very cautious when deleting files shown this way, as you'll find many are embedded in applications, or used by other applications, including the OS, in various ways; deleting them may render an application dysfunctional.\n", "Q: 3 devices. icloud library I have 3 apple devices (one phone and 2 Ipads). If I turn off icloud library on my phone can I delete photos on my phone without deleting them on the other two devices?\n\nA: Yes. If you disable iCloud Photo Library on your iPhone, photos will no longer be uploaded or removed from iCloud as per your actions on your phone. The iCloud backup for your phone will update, but that obviously doesn't affect the other devices. \nEither way, it would be good to understand and have in place backup procedures. One is that the iPhone saves \"deleted\" photos for 39 days. After you delete photos from your iPhone I recommend that you check your iPad to make sure they aren't deleted there. Second, it would be good to backup all of your photos to a computer. \n", "Q: As the Mac mini has no battery, would it fail or just suspend if the power is cut? I was interested in buying a Mac mini for work (I love Linux but it requires too much maintenance).\nHowever, it turns out that it has no battery at all (different to a MacBook Pro/Air etc).  \nI have never owned a Mac and I would like to know what happens if electrical power is missing for a few seconds? (It happens.)\nDoes it have kind of \"snapshot\" function or would it result in losing everything I was doing (if not saved)?\n\nA: As with any computer which does not have a battery you will lose everything not saved to disk if you unplug the computer from the power  supply. If you use a Mini in an unstable environment, adding a UPS might reduce the risk of data loss. \n", "Q: How to set Title in Contacts but not display it? Is there a way to set the 'Title' field in Contacts, but to not display it?  i.e., in Mail I want to see \"John Doe\", but have the contact card display \"Captain John Doe\".\nCan I do this?\n\nA: Set it as a Nickname instead.

The sign-in, presumably will just ask you to confirm with your ID & password, then check against Apple's servers, but the encryption [assuming you use it to preserve your passwords etc in the backup] is another factor.\nAll I could suggest would be to test before it becomes critical - if you have another computer to test with, or even on a new, 'blank' Mac account, before you go away.\nIf it failed at that point, you'd have your 'real' backup at hand.\nAs the saying goes, a backup strategy is only as good as your ability to restore it.\n", "Q: Keyboard's light is not working When I press the F5/F6 button, the HUD shows a decreasing/increasing bar related to the keyboard's brightness (image). \n\nSo far so good… The problem is: the keyboard stays completely dark, no light is emitted from the keyboard, even though the bar is moving when I press the keys F5 and F6. \nI've already tried to reset PRAM and SMC but it didn't fix my problem.

Can I use the fact that I've connected to the network on my Mac to have the iPhone connect without wasting time entering the password on the phone?\nIn case it helps, it's an iPhone 6 with iOS9 and a 2009 MacBook Pro with El Capitan.\n\nA: As far as iCloud keychain goes, it will save a lot of your passwords that you enter on websites (as well as usernames) but I don't believe it will do it for wifi passwords.\nOnce you enter the password once on your iPhone though, it should remember it from then on, so you will not have to enter it each time. \n", "Q: Is there an application like Connectify for OS X El Capitan?

My main concerns are books(Pdfs,epubs) that I open in iBooks app. Those app have not been bought within iBooks.\nIs there anyway to take backup of books before I go for upgrade?\n\nA: If you connect your iPad to your mac via its lightning cable and then open up iTunes, the iPad will show up as a device.\nClick on it to bring up an info page that has an overview of everything stored on your iPad. From here you have to option to do a full back up by clicking the back up option. This will save all of your user data (including files added to iBooks app) in a back up to be stored on your mac. \nYou then have the option to update iOS in iTunes, you can't update to 8.x unfortunately, you'll have to update to the latest version of iOS 9.x whatever that may be when you do the download.\nAlternatively after you've done the backup you can unplug your iPad and download the update via wifi from within the settings app of the iPad.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: How to Transfer slo-mo video from one mac to other in photos.app with slow motion edits options? I have a slo-mo video imported from iPhone to my photos app. Now I need to transfer this from photos of my mac to other mac's photo.\nI tried by exporting my video as a file in finder and later imported back to the photos app. The slow motion video is working as expected at right timings, but the editing mode is lost. i.e: We cannot alter the timing or frame of the slow motion thereafter.\nWhat can be done if it need to import the video again with the slo-mo frame edit options available.\n\nA: *\n\n*In Finder:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a folder for the media you want to transfer.\n\n\n*In the Photos app:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the media that you want to transfer.\n\n*In the menu bar, select File > Export > Export Unmodified Original For...\n\n*Select Export\n\n*Choose folder from step one\n\n\n*Transfer the folder from step one to the Mac where you want to import the photos\n\n*In the Photos app on that Mac:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the menu bar, select File > Import...\n\n*Select the folder you exported from step one\n\n*Select Review for Import\n\n*Follow the dialog.\n\n\n*Enjoy.\n(But do note: If you made a modification to the slow motion segment, it will be reset to the default after export. I'd love for this to be amended, but I suppose we're beholden to Apple for that...)\n", "Q: Signal Problems between 2015 Macbook Pro and Dell 4K P2415Q Monitor I just bought a P2415Q Monitor and connected it to my 2015 Macbook Pro with the DisplayPort to thunderbolt cable that was included with the monitor. It seemed ok at first, but after the first time the computer went into sleep mode I noticed the monitor wouldn't wake up. The message on the monitor was:\n\nThere is no signal coming from your device. Please activate your\n  device to wake it up. If there is no display, press the monitor button\n  now to select the correct input source on the On-Screen-Display menu.\n\nThere is some information about this message in the monitor's User's Guide, but nothing that helps.\nThrough a combination of just random experimentation (unplugging/plugging, turning off/on, etc) I was eventually able to get the monitor and laptop connected again, but the problem recurred the next time the computer went into sleep.\nI've now also seen a bunch of posts online complaining about similar issues with this monitor or the 27 inch variation. Does anyone have any suggestions about resolving this? I was thinking about getting an HDMI to HDMI cable and seeing if that was an improvement over the DP-mDP connection.\nAnother thing I notice while experimenting with connections was that when I plugged the DP cable into the monitor's DP-OUT connector it seemed to work just as well as plugging it to the DP-IN slot (i.e. worked initially but failed to wake up from sleep). Is that normal that the OUT would also work as an input?\n\nA: After changing nothing, the monitor has been working fine for over a week now. All I can think of is maybe the computer was rebooted and that somehow solved the signal issues. I don't think any updates were installed and I'm still using the same DP cable. Resolution is still 3840x2160 at 60hz.\n\nA: I use a 2014 Macbook Pro with two Dell P2415Q via Display Port and I run into this issue from time to time.\nThe only solution appears to be to hard reset the monitor (disconnect cables and hold power for 10 seconds).\nRebooting the Macbook has no effect in my experience.\n", "Q: Apple MacBook Pro display shows black screen I have a MacBook Pro 15 inch 2015 model. Until yesterday it worked fine. But now it shows a black screen. But when I connect to external display through HDMI it works fine.\n\n\nIs there any solution to solve that problem?\n\nA: Unfortunatly, it looks like a hardware issue.\nUse the external monitor to see what you are doing and go to the system preferences and check the settings. Check the monitor preferences and see if it listed. Try turning the brightness all the way up.\nIf it is a 2015 model and less than 1 year old Apple should repair it for free. If you have AppleCare extended warranty they will repair it for 3 years for free. Take it to an Apple Store or an Apple approved repair vendor. \n\nA: It's display cable problem dude check cable connector by opening display case \n", "Q: Can't reformat SD card (Yosemite) I have a 2 GB SD card that I can't reformat.

Some people go so far as to say there's a \"light beam\" inside the slot that reads the lock slider in the cards. \nIt came down to either buying a USB SD reader or opening the iMac to extract and service the reader part itself. Then I used a led light to see inside the slot itself and it was all in fact just pins. a pin is pushed when the card slider is in “lock” position preventing the OS from writing. I used tweezers to scrub inside the lock recess in the iMac slot, plugged the SD afterwards and it worked, it's writable again. might have been jammed with dirt and dust.\n\nA: I had the same exact problem.  Format your card using this application: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/index.html\nWorked perfect for me.\nCheers.\n\nA: Does it have a lock switch on the side?\nIf the card is not corrupted, it could help to slide the lock switch several times.\n\nA: Not sure if anyone has put this as an option yet but, after fussing with this issue many times over, I brought out my dusty usb card reader and voila no more issues... Hope this helps...\n\nA: I had the 'Disk Utility.app v15 (1511.3.1)' response \"couldn't open device\" on Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.6, while trying to erase an external USB hard disk that had previously been used with Windows. After much struggling, what worked easily, was to boot into Rescue mode and use Disk Utility there.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you want to work on an external disk, plug it in\n\n*Restart -- or with the Mac shut down, start up -- while holding command-R until the progress bar under the Apple logo has progressed about 1/4 of the total distance\n\n*Choose 'Disk Utility' from the 'OS X Utilities' window\n\n*Chose the disk at the left, and click [Erase]\n\n*reboot into regular mode\n\n\nA: If you feel comfortable with the terminal you can try using diskutil commands. (Make sure you have a current backup of your main hard drive and dismount all other drives, then insert the SD card.)\nRead the man page for diskutil first.\nThen make sure you are absolutely positive which disk is the SD card before you execute any command that could erase your hard drive if you are wrong.\nYou might read this post of someone with a similar problem:\nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20070306150736965\nGood luck and be careful!\n", "Q: Why is VLC verified every time I open a file that is supposed to open with it? I have downloaded VLC for Mac, and I installed it. Now every time I open a video that is supposed to be opened by VLC, it starts verifying again, like it is the first time and it will install it. I also don't see a shortcut in the Applications folder. What is the way around this?\n\nA: If your Applications folder doesn't contain VLC.app, you probably didn't install it properly. The verifying process (trying to start VLC) indicates that a dmg containing the app has to be opened.\nSince VLC is a self-containing app you don't have to initiate an installation. Instead open the downloaded VLC.dmg, drag and drop the VLC.app inside the mounted dmg to the folder /Applications. Then unmount the dmg and start VLC.\n\nA: I had the exact same issue. I think it happened because I tried to open a video file using Open With while the VLC dmg was still mounted (even though I did properly install VLC to /Applications/VLC.app). Apparently it associated to the mounted dmg instead of /Applications/VLC.app.\nThe solution was simple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unmount the VLC dmg.\n\n*Run in a terminal: killall Finder\nAfter this, using Open With > VLC associated to the proper /Applications/VLC.app, and did not go through the \"verify\" process every time.\n", "Q: How to move books from iBooks on my iPhone with iTunes on Mac? The first thing I bought was an iPhone. I have a lot of books there in iBooks. Now I would like to sync this library across my other devices: Mac and iPad. I know that the base for devices is Macbook and syncing via iTunes.\nBut when I connect my iPhone to Macbook, and then try to set Sync Books I got a warning:\n\nI definitely do not want to remove them from iPhone. What should I do then?\n\nA: Did you buy them from the iTunes Store? If so, they should sync automatically via iTunes into iBooks on your Mac. If you got them externally to iTunes, then you will have to separately move them to your Mac first before using iTunes on your Mac. Can you mail them to yourself and import them into iBooks on your Mac? It does matter which version of iTunes and OSX you are using as the behaviour of iTunes and iBooks has changed between releases, however the fundamental point is that you need to move them independently of iTunes to your Mac first. \n", "Q: Can I switch between multiple Macs connected to an iMac with Target Display Mode? I have a MacBook Pro that I use with a pre-Retina iMac in Target Display Mode, using Thunderbolt.\nI'm thinking of also getting a Mac Mini, and I want to run it in TDM on my iMac.\nCan I connect both the MBP and the Mac Mini with Thunderbolt cables to my iMac, and thus use ⌘ + F2 to rotate between all three desktops, so that I can switch to display any of these at any time:\n\n\n*\n\n*The MBP \n\n*The Mac Mini\n\n*The iMac native display\n\n\nA: As I understand it you want to alternate between using the iMac display to display a) itself b) a connected MBP c) a simultaneously connected Mac Mini\nWhen you enter Target Display Mode, you do this on the target, i.e. the iMac. There is no option to tell the iMac which connected computer to display, if there are multiple connected.\nAccording to Use your iMac as a display with Target Display Mode in the section Exit Target Display Mode it mentions, \n\n\"Your iMac also exits Target Display Mode if you disconnect the cable\n  that connects the two computers, or if you shut down or sleep either\n  computer\"\n\nI have since tested with a Late 2012 iMac 27\", Late 2013 15\" Macbook Pro, and a Mid 2011, 13\", Macbook Air, all running Yosemite.\na) I first connected the MBP and iMac via Thunderbolt cable, and pressed Command-F2 on the iMac. This caused the iMac to go into target display mode and displayed the MBP.\nb) I connected the Macbook Air, via a second Thunderbolt cable and this caused the iMac to exit target display mode (as both the Macbook Air and the MBP were not sleeping).\nc) I put the MBP to sleep (by closing the lid), and pressed Command-F2 on the iMac. This caused the iMac to go into target display mode and display the Macbook Air.\nd) I then alternated target display mode by alternately putting the Macbook Air and the MBP to sleep and pressing Command-F2 on the iMac.\nThis all seemed to work ok, except one annoyance and that was the iMac seemed to have a dim display every time I entered target display mode. I had to manually adjust the brightness of the iMac display, using the display settings.\nNB: From step b) that you cannot have the two computers connected to the iMac awake at the same time and have the iMac in Target Display Mode. At least one of the computers connected must be sleeping. The linked Apple support page fails to mention that.\n\nA: In order to switch displays you either need to shut down or disconnect the computer using the monitor i.e. the display \"remembers\" the active port and will only switch if this original source is turned off or disconnected.\nBut you can use a physical DisplayPort switcher like this one :\nhttp://www.kanex.com/snapx\n\nTwo Macs, One Display\nWinner of MacWorld’s Best Consumer Hardware, Kanex SnapX is a compact\n  two-port switcher designed for Apple LED Cinema Displays 27 and 24\n  inch. Control two Macs with your keyboard, mouse and get full audio.\n  Simply connect the two built-in mini DisplayPort cables with USB from\n  the SnapX to your Mac computers, plug the display cable to the unit\n  and you are set.\nNot compatible with Thunderbolt™ iMac and Display\n\n\nSo, for me the best solution is to move to DisplayPort or to turn off your screen when you want to change (you can use the hot corners or some shortcuts).\n\nA: The hardware doesn't support this directly - so without a KVM type server environment hardware that's usually targeted for Linux/Windows, this is better solved with Software.\nWhat you want would require modifying Mission Control or the OS X display manager to contain a remote desktop version of the other computer's desktops. I don't think this is in existence and you would need to recruit some developers to do it. If you want to try the open source community at the task then go ahead.\nOption 1\nYou can try using a peer to peer remote desktop client from one computer to the other and just make the remote desktop client full screen. That will make it appear in mission control. To get a better response time you could try linking the computers together with an ethernet patch cable.\nOption 2\nThe problem is it looks like you don't want to get a third monitor but this is how you could do it if you could get a third monitor.\nYou can use Synergy to go between both computers with one keyboard and one mouse. It is like having multiple desktops but between two completely different computers. You can grab a nightly build of Synergy free here to try it out.\nIf you want a good cheap monitor then try the ASUS VN247H-P.\n", "Q: Kernel panic in old MacBook Pro after upgrading to El Capitan I'm trying to get my old 15-inch MacBook Pro (Mac-F42D86C8) from late 2008, back to life.\nI installed El Capitan operating system upgrade and since then, everytime I boot I reach a kernel panic and the laptop reboots again and again.\nI've managed to start the system in safe mode and read the kernel panic information (attached below).

the El Capitan install and get it working without issues.\nSo I've removed the HD from the White Macbook and put it back in the MacBook Pro 2008 and It has booted correctly the first time. I've started Safari, I've gone to youtube and when starting to watch the first video, it has kernel paniced. Now I'm unable to boot the computer again.\nBTW, I'm using a 3rd party Hard drive, but I believe it's not the issue because it works flawless in the White Macbook. My understanding is the issue is related with the two graphic cards, and I'm unable to upgrade the EFI as suggested by @kenjikato \n2nd UPDATE 2016-01-03\nEvery time I boot my HD in my white MacBook and then put it back in my MBPro it works the first boot. \nThis time I switched to high performance in Energy Saver and it did work. However seconds after that, the screen started to turn purple. It looks like something is wrong with one of these graphic cards.\nYou can see the video here\n3rd UPDATE 2016-01-04\nI've managed to boot sometimes in El Capitan, however it's quite unstable, and the operating system doesn't seem to remember the high performance mode after a crash. This is another kernel panic I captured today, I believe it's different enough from the previous one.\n\nAnonymous UUID:       A4F7B385-F7EB-6327-54C1-E8D48CD11866\n\nSun Jan  3 08:41:23 2016\n\n***

your problem.  It appears that you have one of the faulty Nvidia 9400m graphics cards in your computer. If you search on your model you will find lots of discussions (Apple Support, GoodBytes) about this system, and problems with the 9400m graphics card.\nIf you were running your system in “High Performance” graphics mode, then the system relied on the 9600m graphics card rather than the 9400m. So you would not have seen the dreaded flickering and green flash so many people reported on.\nThere is a fix, Apple released an EFI Firmware Update 2.8 for several systems including your MacBook in 2012.\nBut if you read through your kernel panic log you will see that you only have the 2.0 EFI Firmware in installed.\ncom.apple.driver.AppleEFINVRAM  2.0\ncom.apple.driver.AppleEFIRuntime    2.0\n\nHence the kernel panic you are seeing.\nI would suggest that if you made a backup before you tried updating the system (you did make a backup right?) that you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your computer from your Snow Leopard pre-upgrade backup.\n\n*Go to  -> System Prefs -> Energy Saver and set your graphics card to High performance. \n\n*Try installing the EFI Firmware Update 2.8 from Snow Leopard.NOTE: The installer will ONLY work from Mac OS X 10.5.8, 10.6.8 or 10.7.3. according to the Apple website.\n\n*Reboot to the internal drive, and the new El Capitan OS you already installed.\n\n\nYou might have to rerun the El Capitan installer again to get things working, but I have a feeling that you should be able to just boot up into El Capitan.\nI hope this solves your problem.\nADDITION:\nOne additional workaround for this problem came to me from a friend.\nYou can try and disable (in Mavericks 10.9, Yosemite 10.10 and El Capitan 10.11) the Automatic Graphics Switching if you can boot into the the updated OS, and get to the System Prefs. This may disable the 9400m enough that you “might” not see the kernel panic again.\n\nA: here i think you can get some help\nhave you tried erasing your HDD and then reinstall via CMD + R?\ngreetings :)\n", "Q: My find/replace text magically changes in Xcode I had a project wide find/replace search all set up yesterday in my Xcode project. Today when I get back to Xcode (without restarting or touching it in any way) the search text has changed. The weirdest thing is that the search text is now the same as a text search I made today in Google Chrome(!). I know for a fact that I haven't searched for \"shipping costs\" in my Xcode project.\nCould someone explain what's going on? I don't particularly like it when applications throw away my data and I would like to prevent this from happening again.\n\nA: Find/replace uses what's known as the Kill Ring, rather than regular Copy/Paste\nIt's similar to the regular Copy/Paste buffers, but uses a separate memory area.  \nYou can 'Kill' using  Ctrl ⌃   K  which is similar to Cut &\n'Yank' using  Ctrl ⌃   Y  which is like Paste.\nThe kill ring is also used in a lot of search routines, so will be replaced any time you perform a new search.\nDon't rely on it as a data store.\n", "Q: Can't install Windows 7 on Macbook Pro I want to install Windows 7 on my Macbook Pro(15'' mid 2012 version). It seems like only Windows 8 can be installed. I was using Windows7 on this mac before. I have erased it and want to install it again but this happens. Can someone please help me?\nThank You\n\n\nA: Steve Chambers is right. \nAs Windows release new versions boot camp is updated to support them and more often than not they drop support for the previous version of Windows. \nYou could either install Windows 8.1 (it still has the start menu ;) ) or install Windows 7 under parallels desktop. \nI personally use parallels desktop as it allows me to use Windows and Mac at the same time. I run it on my 2014 MacBook Pro retina. No issues, everything runs perfectly. \n\nA: According to Apple's web site Install Windows 7 and earlier on your Mac using Boot Camp, you can still install Windows 7 on your Mac. Follow the instructions given at this site. You may have to upgrade your version of OS X.\nIn the event you want to keep your version of OS X and the Boot Camp Assistant will not let you install, you can use a free copy of Virtual Box to install Windows 7 directly from the ISO file. The procedure would be similar to my answer given here. The difference is that you only have one internal drive and you do not need to enter Audit mode.

I was planning to use xhyve to virtualise FreeBSD on my early 2009 Mac Pro (eight core) which has a fresh install of El Capitan (with all updates).I installed via homebrew and I get the following error when trying to run:\nvmx_init: processor not supported by Hypervisor.framework\nUnable to create VM (-85377018)\n\nI have verified that the version of xhyve (0.2.0) works on my 2011 iMac.\nHaving a look I can see that on my iMac hv_support is enabled:\niMac$> sysctl kern.hv_support\nkern.hv_support: 1\n\nBut on my Mac Pro it is not:\nMac Pro$> sysctl kern.hv_support\nkern.hv_support: 0\n\nkern.hv_support is a read-only value so cannot be changed using sysctl.\nMy Mac Pro has an Intel E5520 which I believe supports Intel VT-d, VT-x, and EPT.  Apple also has a page detailing the minimum firmware version and hardware required for VT-x, I’m using a newer Mac Pro than specified and the hardware is the most up to date I can find (MP41.0081.B07).\nI can find zero documentation about Hypervisor.framework other than the fact that it is new in Yosemite.  I’m unsure whether there is some switch I can toggle to enable this, or whether I am completely scuppered…\nAny advice on Hypervisor.framework, or suggestions on getting this working?  While the answer “give up, it doesn’t work” might be the correct answer, it would be good to see some documentation backing this up.\n\nA: Apple's documentation for the Hypervisor framework (https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/DriversKernelHardware/Reference/Hypervisor/index.html) mentions that the processor needs to support Unrestricted Mode, which is a feature available only on a Westmere or newer generation Intel processor. Seeing as the Westmere generation was released on January of 2010, your Mac Pro most likely doesn't support this.\n", "Q: I purchased the iOS app System Status and not sure how to use it I purchased System Status (an activity monitor app) for my iPhone as I read here in the forum it can stop the activity ball from rotating without rebooting the iPhone.

We updated several apps at one time. The iPad said it couldn't update them with 47% battery power, so we plugged it in and ran the updates again.  Now it asks for a 4 digit pin which it never asked for before. We didn't \"accidentally\" set a pin, and no one else has had access to the iPad.  We have tried several 4 digit codes that we \"might\" have set, none that work.  What do we do now? \n\nA: Check that your iPad is not in lost mode by going here. If so, disable it by going to Find my iPhone on another iPad or iPhone or going to icloud.com on a computer and then go to Find my iPhone. Click on the device on Find my iPhone and click Lost Mode and then turn it off.\nA more likely story is that someone could have enabled \"Restrictions\" on your iPad. There are some ways to find out this code, or to disable Restrictions all together. \nBefore you do any of this, just make sure that you have Restrictions enabled by going to Settings → General → Restrictions and then click on that and if you are prompted to enter a 4 digit code, just try once more at guessing the 4 digit code. \nIf it still does not work, plug in your iPad to a computer. Make a backup on iTunes with the current settings. Then follow this tutorial. This is for both Mac and PC.\nCheers and good luck!\n", "Q: How to kill google photos process? My Google Photos service on osx is hung.  There's no obvious process to kill and try to restart.  \nI'm on OSX 10.11.2\n\nA: Open the Activity Monitor app (found in the /Applications/Utilities folder) and select the process from the list. Click the stop process button at the top left of the Activity Monitor window. If the process is a background process, you will have to select the memory tab to see the list of background processes.\n\nA: There are a few ways you can accomplish this. The easiest way would be to open Force Quit... In the top navbar apple menu (Keyboard shortcut Option+Command+Esc). A window will pop up from where you can quit applications. Sometimes, you cannot use your mouse when Applications don't respond, so you can navigate with arrow keys and press enter twice to quit.\n\nAnother way would be to Open Activity Monitor, looking for the App, and pressing force quit (This is assuming that you can use your mouse when an app hangs).\nIn my opinion the best way is to open up the terminal and type:\nkill -9 $(pgrep Photos)\n\npgrep will look for the PID(Process ID) of Photos, and will kill it. However not necessary you can use it with sudo on the start if the app refuses to kill.\nThe command line method  is also conveniently tie-able to a keyboard shortcut, so you can Terminate Photos, or any problematic app you find with the press of a shortcut:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up Automator.\n\n*Make a new Service.\n\n*Drag a Run Applescript block to the workflow\n\nThen, once you saved, you can go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts, and you should find the Service you made with Automator somewhere under services. You can then enable it, and tie it to a shortcut so it runs everytime you press a certain key combination\n", "Q: iPhone 6 screen burn Well basically my iPhone 6 is showing imprinted images in the background, like from previous applications and such. Basically screen ghosting.\nHere are some images:\n\n\nIn this case it is impressing the home screen, but it sometimes shows previous apps and such.\nWhat is this issue related to is it hardware or display? Please if anyone has gone through this shine a light because it's really frustrating.\n\nA: If you have an Apple Store close to you definitely go in and/or book an appointment with a Genius. They will be able to take a look at it and advise you what has caused it. If it is hardware failure and your phone is within warranty, they will generally replace the screen for you on the spot for no charge. More often than not even if you are out of warranty, they will still replace it for free or for a much reduced price.\nI agree with the others that this is a hardware issue with the LCD panel.\n\nA: Definetly a LCD problem. By now I believe you have solved it, but that ghosting effect is a result of applying too much pressure on your phone's screen and because of that you can see the imprint of your app screen. Replacing LCD fixes that for sure, but I wouldn't be bothered with that, I barely noticed it myself. :D\n\nA: Im having this problem right now but if you notice that the ghosting has maybe a blue-ish tint or is in the shape of the internal battery, its definitely an expanded battery problem. That happened to me and when i took it in they said it was clear signs of a expanded battery. It was pretty beyond repair so they just gave me a new one. (if your battery is draining super slow too thats a big sign of an expanded battery)\n", "Q: Does deleting a photo from iCloud on PC affect its copy on iPhone storage? I want to ask if I delete a pic from iCloud online, does it get deleted from the iPhone too?\n\nA: If the only copy on the phone is in Photo Stream or iCloud Photo Library then yes, if you delete it somewhere, it will be removed everywhere you are signed in to iCloud.\nIf you haven't subscribed to iCloud Photo Library, then you may still have the Camera Roll in the photos app, in this case the photo would remain in there, if it was taken on the iPhone originally.\n", "Q: Is it possible to hide the bottom tab in Chrome on OS X using keyboard?

When it does, the fan is running at high speed and there is either no battery symbol, or one with an x on it.\nIf the  power cord is unplugged, the laptop dies within a few seconds. \nIf the MacBook Pro is shut down properly before the battery dies, the SMC reset is not necessary to start it back up.\nI have tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Swapping the battery\n\n*PRAM rest (in addition the the SMC reset)\n\n*I ran the Apple Hardware Test (AHT) and it came out with no issues.\n\n\nDoes anyone have options on what I should try to look into? Thanks.\n\nA: You tried swapping the battery, which means your system is a few years old... I have a 2007 MBP and had some similar issues here and there when my battery aged. Part of the problem was actually my power cord. It was flaky. If your cord is underpowered (e.g. using a 45 W rather than an 85 W for a MacBook Pro) you won't have enough juice to charge a dead battery, so it restarts as if one was not installed or won't restart at all. If your cord is flaking out, it may not be charging consistently (I have a spare cord that sometimes works, and other times needs to have the extension cord removed and re-seated before the MBP recognizes it and kicks on the charge indicator light in the MagSafe connector). Possible that your battery drain is faster than your power cord can replenish at this point. The fact that a different battery gave the same results again makes me suspect the power cord. I'd try a new cord (if possible) and see if that helps at all.\n", "Q: Characters and notification bounce when Terminal loses focus OSX 10.11.2\nTerminal 2.6.1\nI have an intermittent issue that is driving me up the wall. I spend a lot of time in Terminal in full-screen mode on my 2015 11\" Macbook Air. I generally have Chrome or Notational Velocity or something else up in one of the \"Spaces\" nearby and switch back and forth with the four-finger-swipe gesture (enabled in System Preferences -> Trackpad -> Swipe between full screen apps).\nOver the last several months, one of the tabs in my Terminal will sporadically start giving me a \"bounce\" and the red 1 badge to single some kind of alert any time it loses focus. I usually notice it when I'm using a four-finger swipe to go back and forth to another space (which immediately shows a single bounce of the Terminal icon and the badge in the dock).\nThe terminal acts normal upon return to focus. I don't see any notifications or message other than a few odd characters. It was hard to identify exactly what characters, so I ran cat and then changed focus, and it looks like it's ^[[O^[[I. I thought this kind of looked like some of the sequences to make arrow and special keys behave in Terminal -> Preferences -> Profiles -> Keyboard, but I don't see any with those characters.\nI get the same problem when in normal (not full-screen) mode and click on a different icon -- even in the same space -- and Terminal loses focus. Same characters, a bounce, and badge, so I don't think it's related to Mission Control.\nI am often running tmux and have SSH connections to a few servers, but I haven't noticed it being exclusive to a tmux or SSH session. For example, currently I have a few Terminal tabs open, and it's happening in a tab running an SSH session (not in tmux), but not happening in another tab running tmux in SSH, and not happening in other tabs open to local directories.\nI don't see anything obvious in Console.app and nothing from Terminal. I usually try to include a \"WHYT\" section to my stackexchange posts, but I can hardly figure out where to start here -- I'm stumped.\nNot a major issue, but definitely annoying, and it shows no signs of leaving me alone over the last few months. Any help figuring this out would be greatly appreciated!\n\nA: Some program you're interacting with has enabled terminal Focus In/Out events, normally used along with Mouse Reporting (aka “Xterm Mouse Tracking”). When enabled, the terminal sends events to the TTY to indicate when the terminal gains or loses keyboard focus (i.e., becomes active or inactive).\nThe terminal command for enabling focus events is:\nCSI ? 1 0 0 4 h\n\n(CSI = Control Sequence Introducer: ESC [.)\nThe focus in/out events that the terminal sends to the tty are:\nFocus In:  CSI I\nFocus Out: CSI O\n\nThese are the sequences you're seeing when you use cat to view them.\nThe terminal Dock-icon bounce and badge indicate when a BEL (Control-G) is sent to the terminal when it isn't the active/frontmost terminal. (There are preferences to control these behaviors in Preferences > Profiles > [profile] > Advanced.)\nSo it appears that some program has enabled Focus In/Out events and is sending a BEL in response to them.\nIt could also be that the program sending the BEL is not the same as the program that enabled the Focus In/Out events. For example, an editor like vim may have enabled them, but some intervening program like screen or tmux (or possibly ssh, although it seems less likely) is intercepting the Focus In/Out events and responding with a BEL to indicate that it considers the input to be invalid.\n\n…it's happening in a tab running an SSH session…\n\nSince you didn't say, I'll assume you're just using a shell within that session and not some other program. If that's the case, it's likely that you ran some preceding program within that SSH session that enabled the focus events and then exited without disabling them, leaving the shell to receive them, and if you type ESC [ I or ESC [ O manually into Bash, by default it will emit a BEL to indicate that the input is considered invalid.\nIf you have only used a shell within that SSH session, then you should examine the shell startup/configuration files on the remote host to see if there's some code to enable the focus events.\nYou can simulate this situation by running the following command in Bash (and probably other shells):\nprintf '\\e[?1004h'\n\nThen you'll find that Bash beeps (sends a BEL) when you activate or deactivate the terminal view/window.\n", "Q: Stopping Dell P2715Q monitor flickers with MacBook Retina 12\" (2015) I have recently purchased both a Dell 4K display (P2715Q) and a new Macbook (Retina, 12\", 2015).  According to Apple's website, the MacBook should be capable of driving the display at full resolution at 30 Hz, when connected over HDMI (via Apple's own USB-C to HDMI adapter), https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202856.  While the display is detected correctly and I can select up to the full 3840 x 2160 (though it defaults to 1920 x 1080) pixel settings, the Dell display continually flickers, going blank for a fraction of second every few seconds.  This behavior persists regardless of the choice of scaling.  \nHas anyone else encountered this issue (or not) with this setup (or other 4K display)?  Any strategy to resolve this issue?\nThings I've tried: \n\n\n*\n\n*Doing an NVRAM reset on the Mac (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063, as suggested by Apple's help desk) and \n\n*a Factory Reset in the Dell monitor menu options (the only suggestion from Dell's help desk) \n\n\nboth of these appear to reduce or sometimes stop the flickering for a few hours, but it returns by the end of the day (or if the Mac is left on over night).  Having to reset NVRAM every day isn't a great experience...\nEdit the problem persists both while the laptop is in Clamshell mode (with the lid closed) or open as an additional monitor.\n\nA: This may be good or bad news deepening on how you look at it, but it’s the Dell 4K display, not your Mac. Both Dell model numbers 2715Q and 2815Q are notorious for this kind of flickering when used with MacBooks. If you search around on Amazon and other sites you will find similar complaints.\nWe purchased 4 of the Dell 4K P2715Q monitors where I work, and we returned ALL of them in the end because they exhibited this exact flickering behavior (as well as the inability to properly run at 60Hz).\nIt didn’t matter if we connected different types of Macs, or used different connectors. If we tried to drive these monitors at full resolution we saw this problem.\nDell told us the same thing when we called support (and we have the good support where I work), and we still never succeeded in making them work.\nIf you do find a solution with your Mac that makes this monitor work properly I will be happy to learn about it.\nEDIT: For the benefit of anyone coming to this answer and wondering about other’s who’ve seen the same problem. Check out Apple’s forum posts reporting the same problems with the P2715Q.\n", "Q: Why are some tracks in my iTunes grayed out?

Plenty of experts have tried, there have been detailed discussions at Stack Exchange and other sites, but there's no command you can run to turn full screen mode off, or change the default behavior.\nFortunately there are 2 ways to get around this…\n\n*\n\n*Hold down the Option (Alt) key on your keyboard when you click the green maximize button. The window will then zoom the OLD way - i.e., it will not go into full-screen mode.\nOR\n\n\n*Use a free, third-party app called BetterTouchTool.\nUsually I don't like recommending specific software, but as far as everyone has been able to tell, it's the only app that actually lets you change the default behaviour of the maximize button - i.e., the only one that doesn't require any keystrokes at all. Instead, you use the app to assign a new action to that button. After that's set, when you click the button, it works the way it used to.\nYou may need these instructions to change the app preferences. Their terminology is a little non-standard:\nIn the BetterTouchTool Preferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select \"Other\" category at the top of the window.\n\n\n*Make sure that \"Global\" is selected at the left side.\n\n\n*Click \"Configure New Trigger\" button in the bottom part of the window.\n\n\n*Select \"Leftclick Green Window Button\" as trigger.\n\n\n*Select \"Zoom Window Below Cursor\" as predefined action.\n\nSave those changes and make sure to set the app to run automatically when you start your computer, so it is always running in the background.\nThere may be other options in future, but last I looked the app was the overwhelming favorite fix.\nTens of thousands of people have written to Apple to complain about this over the past two years. And one of the reasons is: it tends to screw up and cause odd behavior with multiple non-Apple applications, i.e., ones that haven't updated their software to play nice with full screen mode.  But even without that hassle, for many tasks (especially ones that require having multiple apps and windows open simultaneously) it's a frustrating time-waster for a whole lot of people.\n\nA: The best way is to avoid clicking on that green button BUT instead double click anywhere on the title bar of the window.\n\nA: What works for me - when i forget to option-click on the green button - is to move the cursor to the top so you can see the menu items and then click the green button.\nI almost never want full screen.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro using all the bandwidth My Macbook Pro is using all my bandwidth and making my entire network unstable.\nI thought this could be the iCloud Photo Library, so I paused for a day, didn't change anything, turned off iPhoto process, no change.

So is my only option is to turn that off? or could I be wrong?\n\n\nA: nsurlsessiond is used by other software to make requests on their behalf, the most common source of large amounts of data being transfered with it on workstations and end-user devices is iCloud Photo Library and iCloud Drive. \nYou can watch for filesystem activity in ~/Library/Caches/CloudKit if photo sync doesn't seem to be the source.

It works when paired with a different MacBook Pro, though.\nAlso, I had an older Apple wireless keyboard that suddenly started exhibiting the same behavior, which is what prompted me to buy this new one in the first place.

Not certain if the mds stuff has anything to do with it, but I even turned of Time Machine and I still saw all that mds activity.\nAny suggestions about how to solve this problem or even how to analyze it much appreciated.\n\nA: Well, for starters, clearing Spotlight's index will make mds have to work all the harder to refill it.\nIf you've ever had MacKeeper on there, you need to get hold of Malwarebytes to get rid of the leftovers.\nAvast, in itself, will slow down your machine. I tried it once, got rid of it within a week.\nI'd also be tempted to say updating to El Capitan might fix some of it. I found Yosemite was getting pretty laggy towards the end.

Been having issues with Time Machine and backup so I ran disk utility on all my drives: iMac drive, iomega external HD and Time Capsule. When I run on Time Capsule I am getting a failure and this message:\n\nUpdating boot support partitions for the volume as required.\n  Unable to mount volume for repair.\n  Operation failed…\n\nTime Machine says \"last backup Nov 25, 2015.\" Can't figure out what is going on. Does anyone have any suggestions?\n\nA: TimeMachine is rock solid. I have used it extensively and exclusively since it came out at on many different machines and have never lost any data. Like any backup system, it is only as reliable as the person using it. You need to have multiple disks rotated at regular intervals. Time Capsule is just one Time Machine disk, so don't confuse the two. You need additional Time Machine backups on other disks. Unfortunately all disks fail eventually. If it says that the last back was a certain date then that is what you have.\n\nA: Disk Utility can only check backup disks in recovery mode. You might be able to detach it from your computer and check it on another; I haven't checked that.\nFor more information, see this excellent article by Howard Oakley.\n\nA: You do not want to fix it but understand what is going on?\nThere are several components to this answer.\n\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine is unreliable software. It has failed so often for so many people. Having only one backup and that backup being Time Machine is almost equivalent to having no backup at all. Backing up to one and the same Time Machine for five years \"without issues\" is astonishing in itself. Time Machine reliability seems to get worse over time: one example to move away from pure opinion. Lesson: do not rely solely on Time Machine.\n\n*HFSplus is a very old and evolved filesystem that was simply not designed for POSIX compliance. Hardlinks being a requirement for that and Time Machine. Apple's implementation for that is highly non standard and added on as an afterthought. Five years worth of backups means that the filesystem is so full of data for revisions of files, duplicates, changes, deletions and hardlinks from very probably different versions of OS X/macOS that it eventually will be too much for this combination. Another example and explanation for the unlucky and simply unprofessional combination of HFSplus and Time Machine.\n\n*Disk Utility and fsck are not that capable of repairing issues with HFSplus. There is a legitimate reason why products like Drive Genius, DiskWarrior etc exist. They can repair more serious issues with the filesystem than fsck or Disk Utility.\n\n*Apart from those systematic reasons there is of course the most simple possibility: unfortunate things do happen. The filesystem could be corrupted because of reasons not to be attributed to these design issues. Bit flips, bit rot, hardware problems like bad sectors etc. An age of five years (at least that) isn't exactly young for a drive.\nTo answer the question in the title: yes, you should be able to repair a Time Machine volume with Disk Utility. Problem being that sometimes you simply can not. \nIf you still want to repair the volume you then have to try the other options (DG, DW…).\nIf you want that data back, try to restore it to a big enough volume. Revisions might get lost that way. Or try to copy that volume via rsync or dd to another volume, then copy/restore that back to a freshly formatted Time Capsule.\n", "Q: Where on the file system are my photos imported to? I'm using OS X Yosemite 10.10.5.  I have connected my Canon PowerShot A3400 IS Camera via USB to my Mac and automatically a window launched that imported my photos.  The Photos application (version 1.0.1 (215.65.0)) launched and I can see my photos within it.  My question is, where on the file system are these photos?  I want to import these into a Google photo album but don’t see any option in the Photos application to save them somewhere and I can’t seem to find them in the Finder app.\n\nA: If you're using the Photos application then your imported pictures can be found at:\n~/Pictures/Photos Library\n\nThis is a special folder. If you double click on it in Finder it'll open the Photos application instead of showing you the contents of the folder. To see the contents, right click on the folder in Finder and select Show Package Contents from the menu.\nOnce you're inside the special folder the unaltered master photos are in the Masters sub-directory sorted in to year and then month then day sub-folders.\nIf you're trying to find the path to the location from a Terminal command line it's:\n~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary\n\n\nA: As long as you don't click \"import\" in the Photos app, the files are still on your camera's flash drive and not actually imported to you hard disk.\nThe camera's filesystem should also be mounted in the Finder. On the command-line, all mount-points are accessible under /Volumes.\n\nA: They are stored within your Photos Library, but Apple don't really want you to play in there, so they make it awkward to get to.\nIf you want to play the game the way Apple intended, then the simplest way is to either Share them from in Photos, or to drag them from the photos app to your desktop, or any specific folder.\nIf you want to 'break the rules' then you can open the Library 'file' - which is really just a special folder with its contents hidden from the casual observer - by right clicking the Library & selecting 'Show Package Contents'\nThis will open it as a folder; your original pictures are located within the Masters folder.\nDon't delete things from there, just copy things out of it, or you will confuse Photos.\nTo get to the Library file, if you're struggling to find it… \n\n\n*\n\n*Open a new Finder window using  Cmd ⌘   N   \n\n*Go To…  Cmd ⌘   Shift ⇧   G   \n\n*Copy paste this - ~/Pictures/Photos Library including the tilde ~ & hit  Enter ⌅ \n\nA: I follow this method - click on the desktop icon \"Mcintosh HD\" (it looks like a hard drive and I have no idea how it came on my desktop.

I'm using the built in Screen Sharing tool in El Capitan to control an iMac from a Macbook Pro in full screen mode. Everything works beautifully except that many special keys and gestures are intercepted by the local Mac and not sent to the shared Mac. Specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl-Arrow (Desktops and Mission Control)\n\n*F3 (Mission Control)\n\n*F4 (LaunchPad)\n\n*Three finger swipe (Switch between Desktops, Mission Control, Exposé)\n\n*Two finger swipe from left side (Notification Center)\n\n*Pinch with four fingers (Launchpad)\n\n\nI can't find any way to switch between desktops on the remote machine other than manually opening the Mission Control app from the Finder or Dock. Disabling the gestures on the local machine doesn't help; they still don't get sent to the remote machine.\nIs there any way to get special keys and gestures passed to the shared machine?\n\nA: Not truly a fix, but a possible workaround.\nThis picture has the remote key assignments to the left, & mine to the right.\n\nBy avoiding the same keys for Mission Control itself, I can get to the remote machine's 'screen list' by using  Ctrl ⌃   ↑  at least & click on the one I require.\nIt's not neat, but it does function.\n\nA: Apple's Screen Sharing has very limited ability to intercept the shortcuts and direct them to the remote OS.

Earlier on my notification centre got stuck half way down the lock screen, making my ipod completely unusable. \nI tried turning it off but the notification centre is blocking the slider and obviously I can't restart it since my home button is broken. Has anyone got any solutions? It's an absolute nightmare!\n\nA: Press and hold the sleep-wake button to shut down the iPhone.\nWhen you restart it, the notification center should be freed, but you will clearly have issues using the device if you lose control over the assistive touch, so be sure to set up backups the first chance you can. \n\nA: let your device power down then try recharging it, and then hopefully it should be usable once again.\n\nA: This is a \"solution\" to anyone who's home button has completely fallen out to the point where you can see the metal that's inside. The home button is connected to a piece of copper which leads upwards and disappears behind the screen sort of. Having 100% battery and being really pissed off that I was going to have to wait (and already having a really beat up iPod) I did something that MAY NOT BE A SMART IDEA. It's very possible that the way I fixed it could've caused me to dislodge a section of the screen, crack my iPod even more, or hurt the gutting/computer chips inside the iPod. So if you place the iPod flat with the bottom facing you and you look upwards into the hole where the home button use to be you can see a piece of copper. If you stab around in there eventually with something (probably not wise to use a paper clip, might get shocked) you'll eventually hit something that will trigger the home button command. Hold your probing device against that area and hold the top button on the screen until your iPod shuts off completely. Reboot, problem solved. I know I have an iPod so it may be slightly different but I highly doubt it.\n\nA: Well, I think I will just let the power to out and I will just turn it back on with the charger due to the fact that my home bottom button is broken. So this way when it shuts off I can rebuild the power so that the notifications and that whole bar situation is figured out. \n", "Q: Reformat URLs using Applescript or Automator Currently I have a process that downloads image URL from a website.

But it does not play the audio from videos created by an Olympus SZ-31MR digital camera.\nThese videos do play within Photos, but they are silent. \nWhen played in Quicktime Player (and VLC), the audio plays correctly.\nAccording to Quicktime Player, videos from this camera are encoded as \"H.264, 1920 × 1080, Millions; 16-bit Integer (Little Endian), Stereo, 32.000 kHz\"\nThis is in OS X El Capitan (10.11.2) and Photos.app 1.3 (350.23.0), but the problem is not new. This thread on discussions.apple.com claims the problem is the audio codec used by the Olympus camera.\nIs there a way in which I can play these videos and get sound, without having to find the individual video files and open them in Quicktime.app? Any of the following solutions would be acceptable:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some kind of install (a Quicktime plugin?) that fixes the behaviour in Photos.\n\n*An alternative photo browser that can import (or view in place) the Photos library and which can play the audio in these videos. (I've tried Lyn, but that has the same behaviour as Photos.)\n\n*Some way of transcoding these videos so that the audio plays in Photos. I have lots of videos and import new videos regularly, so a convenient interface would be important here.\n\n\nA: (Answering my own question.)\nThe problem is that the Olympus SZ-31MR encodes its audio as signed 16-bit PCM. This audio format is not supported by Photos. So the audio needs to be transcoded in order to play from Photos.\nThe command-line program ffmpeg can transcode audio streams while leaving the video streams unchanged. For example, here's how to transcode the audio to Apple Lossless (ALAC) and copy the video:\n$ ffmpeg -i input.mov -vcodec copy -acodec alac output.mov\n\nExperimentally, it seems that Photos doesn't mind if I edit the videos in its library, so here's a shell script that automates transcoding the Olympus's 16-bit PCM to Photos-compatible ALAC:\n#!/bin/sh\n# Convert movies in Photos library from 16-bit little-endian PCM to\n# Apple Lossless.\n\nset -e\n\n# Location of Photos library\nPHOTOS=~/\"Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Masters\"\n\n# Directory for movie backups\nBACKUPDIR=~/movie-backups\nmkdir -p \"$BACKUPDIR\"\n\nfind \"$PHOTOS\" -name '*.MOV' | while read MOV; do\n  if ffprobe -v fatal -show_streams -select_streams a -of flat -i \"$MOV\" |\n    grep -q 'codec_name=\"pcm_s16le\"'\n  then\n    echo \"Transcoding $MOV...\"\n    BACKUP=$BACKUPDIR/$(echo \"$MOV\" | sed 's+_+__+g;s+/+_+g')\n    TMP=$BACKUPDIR/tmp.mov\n    ffmpeg -v fatal -y -nostdin -i \"$MOV\" -vcodec copy -acodec alac \"$TMP\"\n    mv -- \"$MOV\" \"$BACKUP\"\n    mv -- \"$TMP\" \"$MOV\"\n  fi\ndone\n\nThis script is careful to keep the original movies in a backup directory in case something goes wrong, and it uses set -e and ffmpeg -v fatal to avoid continuing after an error, but it does overwrite the movies in the Photos library, so use it at your own risk.\n", "Q: Xcode doesn't start I recently downloaded Xcode directly from apple.com (I didn't use the App Store).

Would I still have this ability with iOS 9?\nNote: This was originally asked prior to Apple ending iTunes Radio for non-subscribers.\n\nA: It looks like you still can play your iTunes Radio stations from Siri. From what I understand, you're correct in your observation that you no longer can view all of your stations outside of the \"Recently Played\" section, but Siri can both create new stations and play existing ones on command.\nI tried playing/creating stations through Siri a few times on my iPhone 6+ running iOS 9, with these results:\nWhen I tried to play an Owl City radio station I had previously created, and told it, \"Play my Owl City station on iTunes Radio,\" it played Beats 1. But this worked (and created a new Owl City station instead):\n\n\nTo make sure that things were working the way I thought they were, I also tried playing a Taylor Swift station I had recently created. This time, it played the station without creating a new one.\n\nUnfortunately, you can't just say, \"Play my most recent radio station,\" and expect it to play your most recent station. Instead, in my experience, it jumps to Beats 1, what Siri calls its \"favorite radio station.\" You can see the Music app cueing it up in the background thanks to Siri's translucent new appearance.\n\n", "Q: How do I ignore ownership on an external hard drive without using Get Info?

First is has the name \"Master Boot Record Partition Table\" or the abbreviated name MBR table. The second is called the  \"Global Unique Identifier Partition Table\" or the abbreviated name GPT. The MBR table can only have 4 entries, where as, the \nGPT can have 120 entries. When OS X makes an entry in the MBR table, the entry is also duplicated in the GPT. Furthermore, these duplicates are stored in both tables using the same index. For example, if an entry is duplicated and one of the pair is the 3rd entry in the GPT, then the other will be found as the 3rd entry in the MBR table. This means any GPT entry with an index greater than 4 should never appear in the MBR table.\nWhile OS X is aware of both the MBR table and the GPT, the same is not true for Windows. For you model Mac, Windows will never look at the GPT. It only sees the MBR table. If you used OS X to create the Boot Camp partition with an index of 5, then this partition will not appear in the MBR table. Therefore, Windows will not be able to find this partition during the installation process.\nIt is possible to make the 5th entry in GPT be paired with one of the last 3 entries in the MBR table. This requires either a third party tool or a great deal of manually editing of the MBR table using the OS X command line tools. Ron Smith offers a third party tool called gdisk which can make this kind of change to the MBR table. Basically, you first select the r option to enter the  \"recovery & transformation\" menu. Next, you select to h option to create a hybrid MBR. At this point, you can enter the indices of the GPT partitions you what to appear in the MBR table. Finally, you select the w command to write the changes to the MBR table on your drive.\nIf you wish confirm if the use of gdisk would help install Windows on your Mac, then edit your question and add the output from the following commands.\nsudo fdisk /dev/disk0\nsudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0\n\nThese commands will not change your Mac. They may ask for your login password. This is normal. The GUID's produced are all published in the public domain.

I've noticed when I receive messages in the Messages app in El Capitan, it plays the \"Chime\" sound from iOS 9.  \nI recall that in the previous version of OSX, or perhaps the one before it, the incoming Messages notification sound was simply a different pitched variant of the \"send\" message sound. \nHow can I restore it to the original Messages sound from the older versions of OSX?\n\nA: Prefs > General\nTake your pick…\n\nMine's always just gone 'ping' so I don't know precisely which sound you mean\n", "Q: Can softwareupdate be used to automatically download (but not install) on the terminal? Could the Terminal command softwareupdate be used to download (but not install) any MacAppStore updates, say with a scheduled Calendar running an Automator/AppleScript script?\n\nA: From man softwaredownload:\n-d | --download\n    Each update specified by args is downloaded but not installed. The values of args are\n    the same as for the --install command. Updates downloaded with --download can be sub-\n    sequently installed with --install, or through the App Store (as long as they remain\n    applicable to your system).  Updates are downloaded to /Library/Updates, but are not\n    designed to be installed by double-clicking the packages in that directory: always\n    use --install or the App Store to actually perform the install.\n\nSo yes, that is possible. AFAIK iCal has lost the ability to run AppleScript commands a few releases back, so you might be better of with a launchd job.\n", "Q: Automatically eject disk image x minutes after mounting So I have an encrypted disk image that I use to store sensitive files. However, I often forget to eject it when I'm done, which obviously negates the whole point of encryption. What I'd like is some tool, setting, etc. (perhaps a cron job?) that monitors when a specific disk image is mounted, waits a specific duration of time, and then displays a message notifying the user of imminent ejection. If the user does not opt to reset the timer, or doesn't respond, the image is ejected. Alternatively, it could also eject when the screen saver activates. Do any tools like that exist?\n\nA: You can use a cronJob and an apple Script\nunMount a disk with AppleScript :\nset mountedDiskName to \"AirPort Time Capsule\"\nset diskIsMounted to false\n\ntell application \"System Events\" to set diskNames to name of every disk\nif mountedDiskName is in diskNames then\n    set diskIsMounted to true\nend if\n\nif diskIsMounted then\n\n    //  put a sleep or a notification here, see explanation below\n\n    log \"Disk Found, unmounting now...\"\n    do shell script \"diskutil unmountDisk\" & space & quoted form of mountedDiskName\n\nelse\n\n    log \"Disk Not Found, mounting now…\"\n    mount volume \"afp://AirPort%20Time%20Capsule._afpovertcp._tcp.local\"\n\nend if\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/29332873/os-x-applescript-to-check-if-drive-mounted-and-mount-it-if-not\nMake a cronJob to run the Script :\n* * * * * osascript ~/Desktop/theScriptToBeExecuted.applescript\n\nHow can I configure my computer to run an AppleScript at a specific time?

Instead of just allowing me to copy exactly what I highlight, it will expand to what it considers more useful.\nAs an example maybe I have the following command\nrsync <file> server.example.com:/home/user/<file>\n\nIf I was to select via cursor and highlight server.example.com, it will instead re-highlight the entire command and copy that.  It is so annoying because I copy stuff all day long. \nI copy by either pressing Command+C, or right clicking to get the dialog menu and selecting copy which is the same as doing “Edit” → “Copy”, on the toolbar.  \nI have disabled the automatic select text and copy function. That is something I do not want enabled.  \nIs there anyway to fix this?\n\nA: It is an option under Preferences>General>Selection. \nI am using iTerm Build 3.1.6.\n\n\nA: If you do a double-click to select it go into \"all-word\" mode, which automatically grabs each word.\nIf you just click and drag it'll take whatever your selection is.\n\nA: If you go to Preferences ( ⌘ + , )\nUnder the Appearance Tab, there is an option \"Show tabs in fullscreen by holding ⌘ for:\" and there is a slider from 0 - 10 sec.\nI had the option set at 0 sec and was getting the issue described here.\nWhen I set the slider to 10 sec, this was not an issue.\nI like being able to see the tabs, but do not like it messing with my copy selection, so I went with 1 second, enough time for me to copy the text without it fudging with my selection and showing the tabs.\n", "Q: Runnng Yosemite on late 2015 iMac 21.5\" Does Yosemite run on late-2015-iMac-21.5\"? It comes with El Capitan. I would like to install Yosemite instead.\n\nA: Usually you can't downgrade OS X below the version the hardware originally got delivered with, mainly because drivers for newer hardware etc. are not available in the older versions. The late 2015 iMacs come with architectural and graphics changes compared to previous models, so older OS X versions may have problems here.\nIf you are looking for specific behavior etc. only available Yosemite, you could install it in a VM though.\n", "Q: consequences of `sudo rm` apps that shipped with the OS (like Photos, Messages, Mail) I've got numerous OSes installed on my Macintosh laptop for certain reasons.

Mostly because any part of these applications that is used by other applications will be stored in other locations like the \"/Library\" or \"/System/Library\" folder.\nHaving said this, I don't see any real benefit to deleting these applications. When Apple release an update for the operating system there is a good chance that it will restore a good portion of the files that you've deleted.\nIf you aren't using these applications the only benefit I can see to deleting these files is getting you back a little bit of hard drive space. I would recommend not deleting them from \"/Applications\", and just in case, I would STRONGLY recommend against deleting anything from the \"/Library\" or \"/System/Library\" folders.\n", "Q: Explanation for wrong charging wattage / slow charging? I have a 2013 Retina MBP and a fairly new 85 W Magsafe 2 charger. But when I connect this charger to my Macbook and check in Battery Health, it claims that it is receiving only 49 W.\n\nDoes anyone know why the laptop should be drawing such a low supply from the Magsafe 2?\n\nA: 85 W = maximum power used by your charger on the power supply side on AC.\n49 W = actual power received by your MacBook internal power managment on DC.\nWhere is evaporating the missing 36 W?\n\n\n*\n\n*Within AC -> DC transformation.\n\n*Joule effect within all conductors. This explains why your charger is heating (and incidentaly heating the atmosphere of our hosting Earth). This consumption is high because it is depending on the square of I (RI²) and on low voltage I is high.\n\n*A part is diverted by the PMC to power different parts of the computer based on its energy saving state.\n\n\nA: The shown charging wattage is correct. The whole wattage of the MagSafe is divided into charging the battery and running your Mac. So probably your Mac needs ~35 W and the rest of ~50 W is used to charge the battery.\nYou may estimate the needed wattage of your Mac by temporarily unplugging the MagSafe. \nThe power usage (and the realtime Usage in mAh) provided by the battery will change to certain amounts. After replugging the charger this will change back to the charging wattage.\nOn my MacBook Pro I get the following:\nOn Battery: ~70 W (- 6510 mAh)\nCharging:      ~6 W (         -        )\nEstimated total wattage: ~76 W (not taking into account that the power consumption is slightly lowered in battery mode)\nAfter quitting a power consuming app running in the first attempt I get\nOn Battery: ~40 W (- 3980 mAh)\nCharging:    ~32 W (         -        )\nEstimated total wattage: ~72 W\n", "Q: How do I disable all Source Mapping in Safari DevTools?

I installed Lync 14.2.1. When I send some text to somebody, he gets this text as clipped. tail of chars are clipped. it is impossible to read \"y\" or \"g\". because they don't have tails. I tried to various font and font size but no change. how can I fix this ? \n\nA: I have the same issue with Lync 14.2.1 (150923) and El Capitan (10.11.2 (15C50)). It occurs only when sending messages to Lync for Windows (I'm not sure which version but one compatible with both Office 2010 and 2013). Mac to Mac messages look fine. The symptom is with line spacing (the vertical distance between lines of text) that causes text to be clipped and difficult to read.\nI have done extensive testing to try to find the solution, by changing font sizes on both the sending side (Mac) and receiving side (Windows) to no avail. When I log in to my account on Lync 2010 (4.0.7577.4484) for Windows 7 through a Windows 7 VM, my messages look fine to recipients.\nTo conclude, Win-to-Win and Mac-to-Mac are fine, but Mac-to-Win is not, regardless of the font or font size selected on both ends.\n", "Q: xxd not found in Recovery Mode, Mac OS X 10+ In Recovery Mode, I was trying to access my password hashes, except bash 3.2 returned command not found for xxd. \nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: The recovery partition neither contains xxd nor od. Use the one installed to the main OS X volume by entering:\n/Volumes/NameOfMainVolume/usr/bin/xxd\n\nDon't forget to escape spaces in the name of your main OS X volume with a backslash. If you want to save something to a file also use your main volume. The Base OS X you are booted to is read-only and all the smaller r/w disks with less than ~50 MB are lost after a restart because they are in RAM. \n", "Q: Trackpad gesture to select text Ok, it should be very easy one to figure out but I can't do it, so I'm asking experts. I want to know which one is accurate trackpad gesture for selecting text. Is it \"three finger swipe right\" or \"one finger fixed with two fingers swipe down\" or \"three fingers swipe down\" or any other ??\nThis is the  context in which I'm asking this question.\nI'm trying to automate my text selection to get highlighted in preview and to get copied to clipboard in web browser. Two different things , but selecting text & assigning gesture is common.  \nThe way I select text in browser is by \"three fingers drag right & down simultaneously\".\nThis is how automatic highlighting worked in preview: selected text by \"three finger swipe right\" -  assigned action \"^ command H\" to this gesture using bettertouchtool app & selected text is highlighted. But can't use same technique in web browser to automatically copy my text with trackpad gesture. \nWhen I use \"three fingers swipe right\" gesture in browser it only selects few words or one line & not the entire set of lines/para like in preview. So what will be right trackpad gesture to select text in browser. I hope its clear now.\n\nA: I think this link may help you out. \"Three Fingers Drag\" is not in Trackpad Preferences. It's in Accessibility.\nhttp://www.idownloadblog.com/2015/06/25/three-finger-drag-gesture-os-x-el-capitan/\nAdmin please pardon me for pasting links.\nJames\nFrom Vietnam.\n\nA: You can enable a three-finger-drag in system preferences, under touchpad/trackpad. Then, you can use three fingers to select text.\n(Assuming that is what you're asking, it is not very clear to me.)\n", "Q: How can I check what mode is already on on defaults write? I am making a script that puts on a defaults write thing to true. How can I check before it's it's true or false?\n\nA: You can use defaults read. For example, if I wanted to check for AppleShowAllFiles, I would do:\n~$ defaults read com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles\nYES\n\nWhich would return YES in the stdout. You can make your script execute this command and read it from stdout.\nAnother perhaps unrealistic (and quite dangerous) option would be to read directly from ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.<ID>.plist, however most of then are rather unreadable. For example, com.apple.Finder.plist around the area of AppleShowAllFiles looks like this:\nNSNavOutlineColumnSettings.v1_FXMyDocumentsArrangeGroupViewBy_AppleShowAllFiles_ViewSettingsDictionary_CopyProgressWindowLocation_FK_StandardViewSettings_8NSTableView Hidden Columns\n\nThis is not recommended though\n", "Q: Disk storage graphic and usage amount inconsistent? I have a Macbook Air(6,2) with 120 GB SSD. When I checked About This Mac --> Storage, I see inconsistent information.\n\nIt says 87.89 GB free but Apps take up 92.65 GB. So there should only be about 30 GB free according to the graphic. However, I believe the graphic is wrong because OmniDiskSweeper says Macintosh HD is ~30GB. \nWhy do the graphic and numbers disagree?\n\nA: Blame Spotlight. About this Mac relys on Spotlight's data, and it's clearly screwed up here. You can fix this by forcing Spotlight to reindex your hard drive. Goto System Preferences > Spotlight > Privacy tab. Then add Macintosh HD into the list, then remove it. Spotlight should start reindexing your hard drive. (You can test this by pressing CMD Space and entering an equation. It should say indexing).\n(Oh, and this is a duplicate of this Finder and About this mac shows different free space sizes?)\n", "Q: Will my emails be kept if I upgrade from 10.6.8 to 10.11? I have a (Mid 2009) Macbook Pro. I want to upgrade my MacOS X version from 10.6.8 to 10.11 but I have some issues.\nI have so many important emails stored in Mail v4.5 on Snow Leopard that I don't want to lose. I wanted to know if I upgrade, will all my mail be kept in the new version of Mail?\n\nA: The upgrade does keep all emails, but the new mail program will reprocess and reindex and move the actual files. \nIF there is corruption in the filed or database on your computer now, an upgrade is when things get worse, so be sure to back up your Mac before the upgrade. That way, no matter what happens with the script, you could wipe and go back to the way things were or investigate your follow on question of how to export or make the mails portable in general as opposed to trusting the upgrade does what is intended.\n", "Q: Using TimeCapsule through PFSense firewall I'm running some time capsule automatic backups and I've recently totally changed my home network with a PFsense firewall and of course my mac stopped recognizing my time capsule. \n\n\n*\n\n*My mac is connected by WIFI to the PFSense router on the interface WLAN with the IP : 192.168.4.12, using DHCP. \n\n*My Time Capsule is connected by Ethernet to the PFSense router on the interface LAN with the IP : 192.168.3.14, using another DHCP server. \nThere is a firewall rule allowing any request from the WLAN network to the address 192.168.3.14 on the LAN network. And the LAN network can access the WLAN Network with another rule.\nThis is working fine, I can ping my Time Capsule from my mac, and when I connect by the finder to 192.168.3.14 with CMD+K it mounts without a problem. However, when I open Airport Utility, it doesn't see my time capsule on the network. (Maybe it's only looking for devices on the same subnet ?) but I can connect to it and configure it by specifying it's ip address with CMD+MAJ+O (Use another device). \nBut while the airport utility is not detecting my time capsule by it's own,the time machine configuration doesn't see the time capsule neither and I can't run any backups. \nI would really appreciate if you had any clue to give me on how to make my mac see my time capsule and start making backups again. Thanks in advance,\ntourdetour. \n\nA: Okay, that was quite tricky. Like I've said in a comment, Bonjour is used by my Time Capsule to be recognized by the mac but isn't supposed to work on a different subnet. \nI set up an Avahi server on my pfsense router that is forwarding any Bonjour request to the WLAN and I can now access my Timecapsule by wifi, use AirPrint and Airplay. \nFor more informations : http://www.avahi.org\n", "Q: What is the \"lsd\" process on OS X, and why is it using so much CPU power?

I just got an iPhone 6, upgrading from the 5.\nMy main computer is a Mac Pro Running Snow Leo, and iTunes 11.4. I backed up the iPhone 5 and when I went to sync to the 6, I got a warning that it wants a higher level of iTunes. I went to the other Pro running Yosemite and iTunes 12 is there, so I backed up the 5 to that computer. The apps don't show up to add back to 6, nor does the 5 backup show to copy it over. \nHow do I get the apps to transfer? (If I need to transfer all of iTunes from the Snow Leo Mac to the Yosemite Mac, and just update iTunes in place, that's ok too. I'd just like a hint at the best method to get this new phone up and running)\n\nA: Since iTunes won't back up the apps, I tried taking the files, e.g. Evernote 7.9.1.ipa, etc, and moving them from the iTunes 11 to iTunes 12. \nWhen at the Yosemite machine running iTunes 12, a double click of the app loaded it to the folder where apps are stored and pulled it into iTunes to sync. \nNow, I'll spend a bit of time and look at the old phone to see which apps I use and would like to keep. Just a click to load each one, at least not a search and download off the store. \n", "Q: Can I install an older OS X over a newer OS X without restoring from backup? Previously I was running Yosemite.  I upgraded to El Capitan and started having problems with an app I used regularly. The backup I have is OS X Lion.  If I restore this backup, I'll lose a ton of files. Is it possible to simply install Yosemite over El Capitan without restoring files from backup?\n\nA: No - the installer will refuse to run unless you follow the erase and install procedure.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904 - go to the Erase your drive and install OS X section at the bottom of the article.\n\n\nYou would have much better luck with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up the Mac - make a bootable clone if you like that flexibility or Time Machine is fine.\n\n*Install the older OS on to an external drive. Make a junk/admin user when the setup assistant runs.\n\n*Add a new user and point that user's home folder at your \"current\" /Volume/whatever/Users/shortname folder.\n\n*Test things that are likely to break: Mail, Contacts, Photos - things that are stored in a database are likely to not be happy going back to older file structures. Once you have a hit list of the things that do and do not break, you can decide to clean things up or manually migrate things to a second \"clean installation\"\n\n\nIf you don't like the complexity or are not comfortable with the concepts above, you might want to just start with the old OS and move things over one by one when you need them. Having a bootable backup here is key since you may have to boot to the newer OS and export things with a tool or by hand for data that doesn't migrate easily.\nIf you're comfortable managing several backups and several OS and several home folders, you may never go back to having your OS run on the same volume as your user home folder. I know people (mostly NEXT era Apple employees and others in the profession) that use this method all the time to make OS changes less intrusive and to separate the backup of user data from the backup of system data and caches.\n", "Q: MBA & VGA monitor, using strange reduction Thunderbolt-HDMI-DVI-VGA I have latest Macbook Air and I want try to use VGA monitor.

For example, someone buys a $50 gift certificate on our website and that gets delivered automatically to the other user.\nIs there a major retailer that does this? I see passbook mostly for tickets (and to be honest, it's a bit unwieldy). \n\nA: Yes - this is a valid use of Passbook now called Wallet on iOS 9. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/wallet/\nApple has ample sample code, working server implementations, automation and testing tools as well as several guides to let you know what is possible without digging into the code.\nMost developers that do any sort of work with Passbook could quote you their assistance in running your campaign if you didn't want to DIY.\nOne major retailer that has had stored value in Passbook for more than a year now (2013) is Apple - both their retail gift cards and iTunes store/Mac App/iOS App/iBooks store combined balances. You can watch a video explaining how Apple rolled this out:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2013-303/\nI also believe that several companies are rolling out discounts/loyalty cards in addition to stored value - but that's a bit newer and I'm not sure that API is finished on Apple's end quite yet. You could easily accomplish that on your end with a web server and some custom coding to track your user through an iOS app or purely through the wallet and/or iBeacons to have the item check in with the server when presented at a POS terminal or other location in store.\n", "Q: Retina 2012 15\" Macbook Pro: Vertical Lines like dead pixels I recently purchased a used MacBook Pro 15\" Retina (2012). Before I bought it, its screen was replaced entirely and so was its upper case. I am currently using Windows 10 on the laptop. \nI started noticing intermittent vertical lines 1 pixel wide when using the machine. At first I thought it was a row of dead pixels, but the screen will sometimes go back to working properly for no reason what so ever. Sometimes the lines are a bright magenta or dark green. The most persistent line is a very subtle light gray. I take very good care of my electronics and I have never dropped the MacBook. What do you think could be causing this? I believe I am past the previous owner's 90 day warranty on the last repair and the AppleCare expired about a month ago.\n\nA: Is this only happening when running Windows ? Do you have the same issue when you run MacOS, when your mac boots, or if you are running any other operating system ? It seems like a graphical driver problem. You could maybe try to update your bootcamp drivers if you're using bootcamp. The support of Windows 10 for macbook is very recent so it might be buggy... I had those sorts of problems when running Linux on mac. \n", "Q: Changing My Phone Number Help I want to change my cellphone number but I am not sure if that will erase the entire contents of my iPhone. Will it?\n\nA: Not at all ! If your change your SIM card (which may not always be necessary if you change your number) , it may erase data on the SIM card, but usually there is nothing on it except some factory useless numbers. But all the data on your phone should be safe and sound. \n", "Q: Omitting photos when backing up an iphone to a macbook with itunes I have a 64GB iPhone 6 and a MacBook Air with a 256GB disk, about 20GB of which is empty.  There are about 24GB of photos and videos on the iPhone, all of which have been imported into the Photos app on my MacBook. Thus I have a backup of the phone photos on the MacBook.  But when I try to sync my iPhone to the MacBook through iTunes, it tries to copy all the photos into the backup and fails because there is not sufficient free space on the MacBook disk.  Since I already have a copy of all the photos in the Photos app., there is in fact no point in iTunes creating a second copy during the backup.  But everything else on the iPhone should be backed up.  \nThus what I need is a way of telling iTines to backup everything on the iPhone except the photos.  However, I cannot find any way to do this (apparently rather simple) thing.  is it possible, or is there some work around?\n\nA: I am assuming you are not using iCloud Photo Library, but are importing the photos into Photos through a USB cable.\nWhat you can do is remove the photos from the iPhone after importing them, and then sync them to the iPhone through iTunes. As far as I know, when not using iCloud Photo Library, an iTunes backup of an iPhone will include a copy of all the photos in the Camera Roll of the iPhone, but it will not include another copy of all the photos that were synced onto the iPhone through iTunes (Apple Support states that “An iTunes backup doesn't include: [...] Content synced from iTunes, like imported MP3s or CDs, videos, books, and photos”). This way you can still view the photos on your iPhone without having two copies of them on your Mac.\n", "Q: Why does the Apple Watch health reminders pop up at 50 minutes past the hour? The Apple Watch gives me health reminders about standing or walking goals. These reminders pop up at 10 to the hour - ie at XX:50. \nThis seems like an opinionated choice, but I thought there might be something behind it, some reasoning I'm missing. \nMy question is: Why does the Apple Watch health reminders pop up at 50 minutes past the hour?\n\nA: The Apple Watch wants you to stand each hour to complete your stand goal. So if you haven't stood during all the hour, it will remind you to do it 10 minutes before the next hour to give the the time to stand a little and add an hour to your stand goal !\nIt's anyway what apple says on their website : \n\nEven if you’re active part of the day, sitting too long has its own health risks. So Apple Watch senses when you stand and move just a bit and gives you credit. And if you’ve been sitting for almost an hour, it reminds you to get up. You close the Stand ring when you’ve stood and moved for at least one minute in 12 different hours during the day. It may sound like a small thing, but sitting less can improve your health in significant ways.\n\n", "Q: Is there free, system-wide http/https proxy software for OS X?

Even on an out-of-box OS X installation there are already a lot of background services running if needed, the difference between client and server is a bit academical in a way. \nBuying (and running)! Server.app is the intended way of using OS X Server, so there isn't any disadvantage. Basically the application itself primarily is used to administer and install all the server services and configurations (some of them you could also configure already manually by editing the corresponding config file).\nAt the end, these services (if activated) will need some additional CPU cycles, but this shouldn't be a problem with the hardware you are using (aka the hardware able to run 10.11), at least not if you only have a handful of clients accessing the server.\n", "Q: update_terminal_cwd demystified please? I am trying to find the documentation on what, exactly, the printf command is doing in update_terminal_cwd.\nIf you didn't know already, the update_terminal_cwd function is defined (at least on Mac OS X 10.7.4) in /etc/bashrc and in that same file the function is added to the $PROMPT_COMMAND so that it runs every time you hit enter in the Terminal.\nThe text of the update_terminal_cwd function itself is as follows:\nupdate_terminal_cwd() {\n    # Identify the directory using a \"file:\" scheme URL,\n    # including the host name to disambiguate local vs.\n    # remote connections. Percent-escape spaces.\nlocal SEARCH=' '\nlocal REPLACE='%20'\nlocal PWD_URL=\"file://$HOSTNAME${PWD//$SEARCH/$REPLACE}\"\nprintf '\\e]7;%s\\a' \"$PWD_URL\"\n}\n\nThis is a few steps down the rabbit hole from trying to set my Terminal tab names from the command line, which can be done rather easily, but the tab name gets reset when sshing into a box.\nThis led me to How to stop automatic changing of iTerm titles? and the rather obscure list of control sequences on the Mac.\nIf you go to that last link and search for the string osc ps ; pt bel, you will find the section which defines the escape character that makes tab renaming work.  However, while that explains printf '\\e]1;%s\\a' (note the \"1\"), it doesn't explain what the \"7\" does in the update_terminal_cwd function I quoted above.\nWhere is this documented??  (And why does PWD_URL include the prefix file://?)\n\nA: from Terminal.app v2.6.1 (OS X 10.11), under Preferences/Profiles/Window, there is highlighted text \"Escape sequence...\" which says:\n\nThe working directory and location of the current document may be set\n  using the Operating System Command (OSC) escape sequence:\nESC ] Ps ; Pt BEL\nThe parameter Ps is either 6 (document) or 7 (working directory) and\n  Pt is a “file:” URL.

I'm not sure that all are even Photos extensions, either, but for sure, some of them are. I actually bought BeFunky Express for the teeth whitening and skin smoothing abilities. I also have some MacPhun apps that work as extensions: Snapheal CK, Intensity, Noiseless and Tonality. Pixelmator has a distort extension, but nothing more yet. And a newer app called Affinity Photo has some too, that are supposed to be pretty good. I haven't got that app yet so I don't know. But, I'm sure more extensions are on the way. Keep your eyes open for more…  \n\nA: Right now the only way is to search for \"Apple Photo Extensions\" in the App Store search bar.  Unfortunately, it will bring up apps that are not extensions since the three words are pretty generic.  So far I can only find about a half dozen real extensions and quite honestly they are underwhelming.  I am beginning to think Apple's Photos move is a failure.  The new app and can't even do the basics that other photo editing software (including Apple's prior versions) can do.  Give me back Aperture with iCloud sync and I will be happy.  \n\nA: Actually, I have just discovered that photos has a lot more in the way of editing features than I at first thought.  Adding options from the 'add' menu is a no-brainer, but I had totally missed the fine tuning options when you pull down the drop down menus in each edit option, and the hidden beauty of extending the tweaking range by pressing the Alt key is just diabolical.  Apple often does this, I find, make things very simple and assume if we are interested in going a little further that we will find the way ourselves.  \nThe following article has been enlightening.\nhttp://www.macworld.com/article/2965934/software-photography/the-hidden-editing-power-of-photos-for-os-x.html\n\nA: Search \"Photos Extension\" in the search bar.\n\nA: In the Mac App Store, search for appex:com.apple.photo-editing.\nYou can also get to this by opening Photos, select a photo, click on Edit in the upper right, then click the \"...\" button, and select \"More...\" from the menu that appears.

I've been the happy owner of an iPod nano 5th gen, 8Gb for a few years.\nOver the years, I've added and deleted many songs, lyrics, album art, etcetera, and I recently assumed that something was corrupted in the drive: when I would add new album artwork to a song, it would either not work or add the album art of one song to a lot of other totally unrelated songs.\nThis thread is excellent to start troubleshooting, but didn't really help on a iPod nano (diagnostics mode is limited on this model).\nPermissions Repair (or actually \"First Aid\" as it is now called) didn't find anything.\nSo I backed up all the songs I had on the it to my MBP. I also checked that the files were not corrupted.\nI would like to restore the device the best possible way, before I put the tracks back on it.\nWhen I launched the (brand-new) El Capitan's Disk Utility, there was a new setting I hadn't seen in previous versions, called \"scheme\".\n\nThe options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*GUID Partition Map\n\n*Master Boot Record\n\n*Apple Partition Map\n\n\nI'm not really sure which one to use for an iPod nano, and couldn't find anything online.\n\nA: The best way to handle an iPod Restore is to do it from iTunes.  \niTunes knows what it is & how to format it - it will even actually format differently depending on whether you have iTunes on a PC or Mac, to enable easier file handling afterwards.\n\n\n*\n\n*If it's a model with a lock switch at the top [red dot visible] switch the lock off first [white dot] - Some models will crash if you don't.\n\n*Plug it into the computer, launch iTunes if it doesn't launch automatically.\n\n*Click the device icon in the top bar, choose the iPod if you see multiple devices listed.\n\n*Click Restore. Follow the onscreen instructions.\nYou will need to resync afterwards.\n\n\nA: If you prefer the command line to format your device, this did the trick for me on a 4th gen Nano :\ndiskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ mydiskname diskX\n\n\n\n*\n\n*with \"mydiskname\" being your personal choice, and \n\n*X to be replaced by the corresponding device number. \nThe latter you can determine via\ndiskutil list\n\nYou might also first have to unmount the device with \ndiskutil unmount [force] diskX\n\nThe \"force\" option may not be always necessary, so you might be able to leave it out. (But I figured, since the goal is to blank the device anyhow, a force should not hurt too much.)  \nGood look! It took me a while. Nothing I found online seemed to work out for me. So I finally went down trying the trusted old diskutil command, worked like a charm. The nano was immediately recognized in iTunes.\n", "Q: Restoring trackpad to original I messed up with my trackpad settings.

DirectX 11 is not supported yet... as expected\n\nA: Answer: Not likely to happen. \nAfter years of pestering, January 2018 Parallels posted a formal statement and explanation regarding DirectX 11:\nhttp://blog.parallels.com/2017/12/04/directx-and-parallels-desktop-13/\n\nWhy isn’t DirectX 11 supported in Parallels Desktop?\nOne of the mandatory DX11 features is called “compute shaders.” The\n  name “shaders” usually refers to graphical functions that calculate\n  the appropriate color and brightness for an image, but “compute\n  shaders” are quite different. Compute shaders help the programmer to\n  more easily take full advantage of the many processors on today’s\n  graphics cards, primarily by broadening shader capabilities beyond\n  pure graphics to more general calculations, which can be done on a\n  graphics chip.\nParallels implements DirectX emulation by translating it to the\n  equivalent OpenGL function, since OpenGL is implemented in the macOS®.\n  Unfortunately, the version of OpenGL in the macOS does not have\n  compute shaders. There is nothing for Parallels Desktop to map DirectX\n  shaders to in the OpenGL framework in the macOS.\nThe macOS does support another style of compute shaders in the OpenCL\n  framework. (Don’t let the similarity in the names “OpenGL” and\n  “OpenCL” make you think they’re similar. They aren’t. In fact, they\n  are competing “standards.”) Unfortunately, however, OpenCL on Mac\n  isn’t as robust and doesn’t cooperate well with OpenGL.\nBesides compute shaders, there are other features missing in OpenGL on\n  macOS, which means there are additional “feature parity holes” with\n  DirectX. There’s simply not enough functionality to translate DX11 to\n  in the functions available in the macOS.\nApple® started pushing its own Metal API recently, which is universal\n  for Mac computers. Only time will tell if Metal will give the\n  Parallels Desktop programmers what they need to support DirectX 11.\n  Stay tuned, but don’t get your hopes up for any major change in the\n  near future....\n\n\nA: Parallels 15 has DirectX 11 support... finally.\n(To be fair, none the competitors seem to have it yet, so I guess it wasn't a simple fix)\n\nA: There are other (less sophisticated) Windows emulators (CrossOver, Virtual Box, Q, et cetera) but none that support DirectX 11 or higher. Hopefully something will be developed in 2017, but for now I am positive there is none as I've researched this extensively for years and additionally I predict that if there were it would be talked about everywhere.\n\nA: If you run Windows via Bootcamp and dont mess with the display settings or screen size, it should run.\nTo be safe have an external drive and try to install bootcamp on it to see if it can run it.

This is on Mojave by the way.\n\n\n*\n\n*I had to disable SIP in order to create the VMDK. It just wouldn't create the VMDK until I had disabled SIP (to disable SIP you have to boot your Mac in recovery mode by holding Command+R on start up, then when you're in recovery you open a Terminal - the option is within one of the Menu Bar drop-downs - then you type in csrutil disable).\n\n*When I created the VMDK it actually created two of them. The one without the \"-t\" extension is the one that VirtualBox seems to understand.\n\n*I could only get the VM to boot by enabling EFI within VirtualBox's settings (go into the settings for your Windows 10 VM, select the \"System\" tab which is the second along the top row, and at the bottom of the \"Motherboard\" pane there is a checkbox saying \"Enable EFI (Special OSes only)\".\n\n\nAfter this, it did boot. Whether it still boots after re-enabling SIP I don't know, but I think it would going by the comments here. I think disabling SIP is only necessary for creating the VMDK. But I haven't tested running the VM after re-enabling SIP.\nAnd I probably won't test that, because unfortunately the VM performance is pretty terrible. The reason I did this whole thing was to try and play Halo (a relatively old game released in 2003 on the PC, but still a 3D game) from my Windows partition inside the VM. So that I wouldn't have to reboot into my Windows partition to play it. Halo does have a Mac version, but it won't work on Catalina since Catalina has dropped support for 32-bit apps, which is why I was trying this. But yeah, the performance was... terrible. About 1 frame per second or even less. Maybe if I tweaked the settings it might work better but it seems pretty rubbish. I even managed to run this game using Wine and it gave me perfectly smooth performance, even though it made my CPU run at a constant 80+C even with fans manually set to full speed. So Wine, for this, seems to be better than VirtualBox.\nBut if you need to get your Windows Boot Camp partition running with Virtual Box just for maybe testing a website in IE or something then this solution could work. I was able to boot Windows and while Halo ran very badly, the OS itself didn't run that badly.\n\nA: I followed this guide: http://web.archive.org/web/20181103074214/http://danielphil.github.io/windows/virtualbox/osx/2015/08/25/virtualbox-boot-camp.html\nI did not follow the instructions to disable SIP, and kept EFI mode on. It worked fine.\n\nA: I also followed the guide at http://web.archive.org/web/20181103074214/http://danielphil.github.io/windows/virtualbox/osx/2015/08/25/virtualbox-boot-camp.html\nI will add what challenges I had following that guide, but I was able to run my BOOTCAMP partition using VirtualBox, which is free, so I'm happy.\nFirst, you should have installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows 10 x64 using the OS X Boot Camp assistant\n\n*VirtualBox 5.0.26 r108824 \n\n\nI also downloaded:\n\n\n*\n\n*VBoxGuestAdditions_5.0.26.iso (I don't think this is necessary, but I did it just to be safe)\n\n\nAs far as Disabling SIP or System Integrity Protection on El Capitan (OS X 10.11), I skipped that part. It was not necessary in my case.\nAs far as setting drive permissions:\n\n\n*\n\n*I ran diskutil list to get a list of drives on my system, taking note of the drive number of the drive named EFI and the other one named BOOTCAMP, which in my case, the EFI drive was 1 and the BOOTCAMP drive was 4.\n\n*I then ran the instructions to unmount my Bootcamp drive and set permissions so that VirtualBox could access the drive. According to danielphil, this needs to be performed each time one reboots.\ndiskutil unmount /Volumes/BOOTCAMP\nsudo chmod 777 /dev/disk0s1 <--- This is the drive no. of the EFI disk\nsudo chmod 777 /dev/disk0s4 <--- This is the drive no. of the BOOTCAMP disk\nAs far as creating the VirtualBox image, the instructions are:\n\nRun the following commands to create a VirtualBox disk image wrapper for >your HD. Substitute the 1,4 with the numbers of your EFI and BOOTCAMP >partitions as appropriate and put your OS X username in for >your_username_here.\n  Make sure you are in the directory where you want to store the VirtualBox image, or you will have to move it later.\n\nsudo VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -rawdisk /dev/disk0 -filename win10raw.vmdk -partitions 1,4\nsudo chown your_username_here *.vmdk\n\nAs far as creating the VM, the guide was not so clear. Before I followed the instructions from the screenshots, I created a new virtual machine in VirtualBox, checking \"Do not add a virtual hard disk\".\n\nOnce created, I selected it and clicked on \"Settings\". At this point, I followed the screenshots in the guide. The only difference was that:\n\n\n*\n\n*I did NOT check \"Enable EFI (special OS only)\"\n\n*I did NOT have the option to check \"Enable VT-x/AMD-V\"\n\n*I used the recommended base memory of 2048 MB, as I only have 8GB of memory\n\n*In the \"Storage\" tab under \"Storage Tree\", I had to:\n\n\n*\n\n*click the \"adds optical drive\" icon under Controller:SATA to add the \"VBoxGuestAdditions_5.0.26.iso\" file I downloaded. \n\n*remove the \"empty\" image under Controller:SATA\n\n*Select the \"Add IDE Controller\" icon at the bottom\n\n*click the \"adds hard disk\" icon under Controller:IDE to add the vmdk file created\n\n\n\nA: Had the same issue and found a solution: just uncheck \"Enable EFI\" in the VM settings (OS X 10.11.3 / Windows 10 / VBox 5.0.14). Disabling SIP was not necessary.\n\nA: Just in addition, I use this kind of script placed in /usr/local/bin to start Boot Camp in VirtualBox:\n#!/bin/bash\ndiskutil umount disk0s3\nsudo chmod 777 /dev/disk0s3\nsudo chmod 777 /dev/disk0s1\nVBoxManage startvm \"Win10\"\n\nAnd this to power it off:\nVBoxManage controlvm \"Win10\" poweroff\nsudo chmod 640 /dev/disk0s3\nsudo chmod 640 /dev/disk0s1\ndiskutil mount disk0s3\n\n\nA: I also followed the guide at http://danielphil.github.io/windows/virtualbox/osx/2015/08/25/virtualbox-boot-camp.html, but unlike the top answer, I had to disable SIP and enable EFI on the VM to get it to run okay.\nHowever, it's worth noting that although you have to do sudo chmod 777 /dev/disk0sX every time, you can disable SIP after setting up the VM and it will continue to work fine. I was a bit dubious about permanently disabling SIP, and I'm glad that I don't actually have to.\n", "Q: Clear recents list in Screen Sharing on OS X El Capitan Please help me clear the list of 6 recent connections offered by the Screen Sharing app.  View the list via a right-click on this app when docked.

I would like to change the folder icon for each, to be a picture of the people with whom that folder is shared.\nI know that I can change the icons for regular folders, so I tried to do that for the dropbox folders... which seemed to work at first. However, I notice that after a reboot, the folder icons reset to the default dropbox shared folder icon.\nIs there a way that I can change the folder icons on a more permanent basis?\n\nA: Dropbox likes to reset the images. You can prevent this by locking the new folder icon. After setting the folder icon to your desired icon, run the following command:\nchflags uchg /path/to/folder/Icon$'\\r'\n\nTo unlock, replace uchg with nouchg.\n\nA: It is an old question. But since the behaviour of dropbox gets increasingly annoying as it now even replaces the folder icon of the base Dropbox folder, I tried to resolve this. The following works for me on macOS Catalina 10.15.4. Unfortunately, one has to do this after every update of Dropbox. It only partially solves the original question, as I can only replace the default folder icon for shared folders. It is not possible to prevent Dropbox from overwriting individual folder icons for shared folders.\nThe Dropbox app stores its icons in Dropbox.app/Contents/Resources. There, you will find two files for each folder icon, a foldericon.icns file and a foldericon.icns.rsrc file. The latter prevents the simple solution, which worked for years, to simply replace the foldericon.icns files.\nCaveat: If you install Dropbox on a machine with several user accounts, the app which actually runs is a copy of this one stored in ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Dropbox. You have to do the changes there.\nThere are currently the following folder icons:\n\n\n*\n\n*DropboxAppFolderIconYosemite.icns\n\n*DropboxCameraUploadsFolderIconYosemite.icns\n\n*DropboxFolderIconYosemite.icns\n\n*DropboxReadOnlySharedFolderIconYosemite.icns\n\n*DropboxReadOnlyTeamFolderIconYosemite.icns\n\n*DropboxSharedFolderIconYosemite.icns\n\n*DropboxTeamFolderIconYosemite.icns\n\n*DropboxTeamMemberFolderIconYosemite.icns\n\n*DropboxViewNameOnlySharedFolderIconYosemite.icns\n\n\nand their respective resource files. \nSuppose, you have replacement images and have made them into .icns files. Then do the following for each of them:\nsips -i name.icns\n\nwhich creates a resource fork for this file and stores the image there. Then we have to get that resource fork copied into a file. The difficulty is that it must be copied in binary format. We can do this with a combination of xattr and xxd:\nxattr -p com.apple.ResourceFork name.icns | xxd -r -p > name.icns.rsrc\n\nThe command xattr reads out the content of the resource fork, but dumps it in hexadecimal form. We revert this with xxd and thus create the content of the resource fork as data of a file. \nStop dropbox. Now copy name.icns and name.icns.rsrc to the above mentioned directory overwriting the folder icons you which to change. It might be wise to make a backup of the originals. Start dropbox again, and the folder icons should have changed to the ones you wanted.\nYou may put the copy commands all in a small shell script which you can run after you notice that dropbox has updated itself. Don't forget to stop dropbox before running it.\n", "Q: Spontaneous Mission Control invocation I have a very weird situation that when I start my Macbook, Mission Control is invoked many times for a couple of seconds. Then it stops and everything goes back to normal (occasionally though it starts again the craziness but very sporadically).\nIn the beginning I though that my trackpad was completely broken so I went to System Preferences > Trackpad > More Gestures and I disabled the gesture  there. But unfortunately the problem still persists...\nIs there any way to see from where Mission Control takes an invocation command? I thought of adding a keylogger to see if the keyboard is also broken and sends random events but if something else is the problem then this is not enough. I wish there was a debug mode or something that I could see who is talking to which service of my mac :/\nAny ideas???\n\nA: I would look at two things:\nCheck to see if Mission Control is listed in System Preferences -> Desktop & Screen Saver -> Screen Saver -> Hot Corners\nCheck to see if Mission Control is listed in System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> Login Items\nEither of these might cause issues similar to at least some of what was described.\nAdditionally, when you shut down or log out, if the checkbox \"Reopen windows when logging back in\" is selected, all the programs that are running when you log out will be restarted the next time you log in - this might be re-launching some software that you don't actually want to use any more. I generally uncheck this box. If you select \"Apple Menu\" -> \"Log Out\" and make the checkbox unselected, you can then hit the \"Cancel\" button to not log out, and the checkbox deselection will be retained.\n", "Q: Apple Configurator refreshes as soon as it finished I've got several iPads which I manage with Configurator.

Once you are able to clear the refresh screen and see the settings for that device, it should refresh correctly in the future.\n\nA: Not a perfect answer, but it kind of works, and at least keeps the device from refreshing forever.\nUnder Preferences > General you can uncheck the box for Automatically Refresh when a supervised devised is connected:\nThis means you do have to manually click on each device to start the refresh process, however that is at least a bit preferable to having the device refresh interminably. \n", "Q: Reboot an Application when it Takes too Much Memory Some applications start off with small memory footprints, but slowly grow to take up way too much RAM. Is there a way I can automatically detect when an app reaches a certain threshold, and then kill and relaunch the app?\nI know that I can see the memory footprint on Activity Monitor, but that doesn't seem to be AppleScript-able. I can also see an application's memory footprint by using ps aux, but its numbers don't seem to match up with Activity Monitor's.\nI'd appreciate any help with this\n\nA: You can try cleanMyMac. It will show you available ram and allow you to clear it. You could also create a cron job that executes sudo purge to try to fix some of these issues. (though I know that solution isn't without its detractors and skeptics)\nIn my opinion, Applescript itself is a huge memory hog. \nI've been trying to OCR a large number of documents via an Applescript that calls Abbyy Fine Reader. It will run for about an hour and then it crashes the mac (just prior I get an error saying all available application memory has been used).\nI initially thought it was an issue with Abbyy and the size of the documents. But it turns out the problem is actually applescript. The My system has 16GB of memory. But Applescript would chew through that in less than an hour with this document dump.\nI even tried hacking things by creating a cronjob that executes sudo purge every couple of minutes. That helped. But ultimately not a whole lot. The only thing that freed up the memory situation was to exit from Applescript.\nAll this led us to switch to controlling Mac applications with ruby using the rb-scpt ruby-gem.

There are many, Free or Paid iOS Apps to download Youtube Video. Most of them worked the same, where you paste the URL into the built in browsers, press and hold the play button to download.\nHowever most of these Apps only download the low / 360P version of the file. I wanted to save the full 720P or 1080P video, and have yet to find an Apps that does it. Anyone know of any Apps/ Ways to download the Youtube HD video on iPhone?\nEdit: I try using KeepVid.com, the resulted link only allows me to play the video file in Safari, and not save it.  \n\nA: iCab Mobile (http://www.icab-mobile.de/) is a very functional web browser with many plugins In addition to the ability to download files for local storage and then opening with other apps via iOS's native share sheets. If you can view the video in the browser, you can download it. It also offers the ability to change your browser's ID so that you can tell the server you are on a Mac or Windows desktop in order to get your desired resolution. Highly recommended tool for downloading videos at whatever resolution you want.\n\nA: If you don't necessarily need an app, there are much better web pages out there for downloading YT videos. Try this: https://loader.to/en22/\n", "Q: Display point values on numbers graph On an Excel graph, if I mouse-over a data point on the graph, the application shows me in a small pop-up window the exact X and Y data values of the point that I am mousing-over.\nIs there a way to do this with Numbers.app, either as a mouse-over, or some other way, so I can see the exact data values of a given point on the graph, without having to go back and look at the table that was used to generate the graph?\n\nA: Select the graph, go to Format, Series tab, then select a Value Label.\n", "Q: Unstable Wi-Fi connection on MacBook Air (Early 2015) My father's MacBook Air (Early 2015) has some strange Wi-Fi issues that he says he's been experiencing ever since he got it.\nI finally took the time to look at it and there is indeed something strange going on. The Wi-Fi seems to work pretty well, except that it intermittently seems to become slow for a few seconds. This makes streaming video and general browsing really annoying.\nI've run a ping google.com for a few minutes and plotted the ping time on an excel graph. And we can definitely see that it hikes 10-fold every few seconds.\n\nI can confirm it's not coming from our router. This doesn't happen on all the other devices that are connected to it.\nThings I have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Everything in this thread \n\n*Resetting our router\n\n*Disabling everything (Bluetooth, Airdrop, etc)\n\n\nThere is one thing I noticed, is that it seems that the laptop's battery has swollen a bit. I'm not 100% sure about this as I don't have another MacBook Air 2015 to compare with.\nIt feels like a hardware issue, as it's been like this since the beginning (according to my dad). I guess part of my question is \"How do I get Apple to take us seriously and do something?\" ... I can already imagine Apple telling us that we have to contact our ISP, or that we need to try restarting the computer. Thing is, I have already tried all of that stuff.\nOr maybe somebody has an idea what the problem could be?\n\nA: It is most likely your battery pushing on other components in the computer. This can loosen connections or cause the wifi transceiver to be partially blocked or even bent. The first step you should take is getting the battery replaced (because swollen batteries can be unstable sometimes anyways) and see if that fixes the problem. If it doesn't there may be permeant hardware damage.\n", "Q: How do I relocate a existing VM with a OS already installed I have a VM up and running great with Ubuntu installed onto it. I want to stick it on an external herd drive. How can I do that without breaking it? Do I just drag the files, or is there something special I need to do?\nI am using VirtualBox.\n\nA: As you're moving the VM's location but not the hardware that the VM is running on (i.e. you're not changing the host computer), moving the files is fine. This is only fine because of this clause. Moving the VM to a different host computer should be done with import/export.\nYou need to make sure that you've moved all the files, otherwise errors will occur, as well as making sure that you move rather than copy the files, otherwise you may get duplicate UUID errors. Deleting the VM from VirtualBox without the external drive attached reduces the likelihood of duplicate UUID errors, as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Quit VirtualBox.\n\n*Move the VM files to the external drive.\n\n*Disconnect the external drive.\n\n*Open VirtualBox and remove the VM.\n\n*Attach the external drive and add the VM to VirtualBox.\n\n\nA: Next time... copy the VM (so the original is kept untouched) and move it to wherever, and confirm that it works.  Once you've convinced yourself that it does work, move the original.  You could've answered this question yourself.\n", "Q: Distributing Beta App to Remote Users It seems like there is no simple solution to providing my beta iOS app to people outside of physical contact.  The ways that I have found to do this WITHOUT using the App Store (which Apple explicitly says is not for Beta testing) are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Developer Enterprise Program; Expensive and Excessive\n\n*Use TestFlight; Only up to a measly 25 \"Internal\" Testers allowed before extreme Guidelines put in place for more people (Why not just put it on App Store at this point...?)\n\n*Give them my whole Xcode project and have the user build it in their own Xcode environment; Impossible to ask of non-tech-savvy people + I do not want to give my project to people outside my company\n\n*Ad-Hoc Development; Make everyone give me their UDIDs...Huge hassle for others/ People might not want to do it outside my company\nThe app I am developing is going to be used by people in the scientific community to control a specific device that my company is making.  There's a chance that it might never be up to Apple's standards for apps on the App Store, but could be used by more than 100 people in the near-distant future.  I guess the real question I am asking is: How do I get my \"sub-par\" beta app to a large group of people?\n\nA: You could use TestFlight for external beta testers. This will allow you to test with up to 2,500 external testers. You do not need to know their UDIDs, only their email addresses.\nHowever, I assume you think your app won't be able to pass even the less restrictive beta app review.\nIn that case, you could distribute your app in a \"half-baked\" form. Instead of giving out the Xcode-project including sources, which you state you do not want, you could distribute your app as compiled, but not yet signed, binaries.\nIn order to make it easy for your customers, you would have to build or get built a simple tool that the user can run that codesigns the binaries with the user's AppleID. They wouldn't need to be registered Apple Developers.\nThe tool would need to alter the bundle name in Info.plist and use the \"codesign\" tool to sign the app:\nTo make the bundle name unique, just add any random identifiers to the bundle name in the plist file.\nThe codesign tool can be used with a command like this:\ncodesign --force --sign \"my identity\"  <path for .app file>\n\nwhere \"my identity\" is the identity (apple-id) of the end-user.\n\nA: In the past you would have to choose between Hockey app and TestFlight for large beta groups - but now that Apple has purchased TestFlight and you need to go through review to get a beta out, Hockey app's beta testing framework is the best suited to your needs listed.\nIt helps handle the user enrollment and management of getting builds notified and served up to end users. You still are on the hook for managing your pool of test AppleID, but now that the 100 device limit has been loosened, you can do pretty broad beta testing using Hockey and Apple's normal paid developer account limits.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://hockeyapp.net/features/\nLong term, you will want to get the app into one of Apple's stores since \"abusing\" the enterprise distribution signing is both costly in time and money to set up and over time, it's not that hard to get an app through review. Yes, you might get delayed a month or two or more, but if you persist, it's a rare app that can't deploy unless you are breaking one of the rules that Apple cares greatly about like including frameworks that use private API or that run code they download after the app has been signed and submitted for approval.\nYour only other option is to ship the source code to each user and have them use Xcode to build, self sign and then install their own app. That might fly for motivated users of a specialty app. GitHub or other source tools would help you push out updates, but you'd be supporting people and possibly charge for that instead of the app itself under that model. \n\nA: Fabric.io is really great.\nYou can send an invitation by email and you will receive the correspondant UDID by email.\nAnd the really good point of Fabric is the Crashlytics and Analytics features.\n\nThe Fabric platform is made of four modular kits that address some of\n  the most common and pervasive challenges that all app developers face:\n  stability, distribution, revenue and identity. It combines the\n  services of Crashlytics, MoPub, Answers, Twitter and others to help you build\n  more stable apps, generate revenue through the world’s largest mobile\n  ad exchange and enable you to tap into Twitter’s sign-in systems and\n  rich streams of real-time content for greater distribution and simpler\n  identity. And Fabric was built with ease of use in mind. Installation\n  takes just minutes, and most features only require a few lines of code\n  – so you spend less time managing SDKs and more time building the best\n  experience for your users.\n\nhttp://frabric.io\n\nA: Diawi is a great platform for what you are looking to do.\nEssentially you upload your app to this platform and you get a short link you can send to your testers. When they open the link on their iOS device they are prompted to install the app.\nAs detailed on their website, the catch is you have to add each user's device to the provisioning profile used to install the application.\nThis is probably as easy as it gets for the users, without distributing via TestFlight.\n", "Q: Can iPad SSL/TLS traffic be inspected during DEP enrollment? I am planning for hundreds of iPad devices that should enroll into MDM using a DEP certificate setting but the network in use inspects SSL/TLS traffic using man in the middle technique in order to decide if outgoing traffic is allowed or not.\nWill this inspection prevent enrollment?\n\nA: The DEP program as well as iOS security design out of the box will likely foil your attempts to enroll a device using networks where you need to install custom CA/certificates.\n\n\n*\n\n*iOS does not automate silent installation of trust certificates without being enrolled in MDM or supervised. You would be preventing this initial enrollment unless you have what amounts to an illegal cert that makes your MITM servers look like Apple owned and operated. I say illegal in the sense that comodo, symantec and others are in hot water from Apple, Google and other OS vendors for issuing certificates to entities that are not what the certificate says.\n\n*Once you have the devices entered into your MDM, you can then push wifi profiles and your CA certs and then join the networks where you are \"inspecting\" SSL/TLS and other encrypted traffic between iOS and Apple or at least attempt to decrypt/re-encrypy/inspect that traffic.\n\n*DEP runs at a point in the OS setup that users can't even accept a custom certificate - this runs before the home screen is initially presented to users as part of the setup script / out of box experience.\n\n\nThis is documented at https://www.apple.com/business/dep/ and https://ssl.apple.com/business/docs/DEP_Guide.pdf and I would reach out to your Apple contact that established your \"sold to\" account for assistance in this.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.apple.com/deployment/programs/#/\nI wouldn't want to surprise Apple with what you're doing and risk them shutting down your DEP. Also they have engineers that can guide you if other large customers have the same \"inspection\" needs that you do and there are either undocumented ways to get around the design or otherwise clear only the initial traffic to Apple and then inspect things once the devices are enrolled.\nYou will have detailed legal agreements with Apple when you sign up for DEP, so you'll want to read through them as well since Apple vets organizations quite thoroughly, you can probably get excellent help directly from Apple if you've already jumped through all the hoops to be qualified for DEP in the first place.\n", "Q: How do I fix a corrupted USB drive on OS X? I accidentally bumped the drive while repartitioning it and it unmounted. After that when I tried to repartition with Disk Utility I got Partition Failed with the error: Could not open device\nNow I am unable to modify the drive with Disk Utility. I don't really care about what is on the drive.\n\nA: Step 1\nOpen Disk Utility (it is in Applications/Utilities) and click New Image with the device you want to fix selected\n\nStep 2\nIt doesn't matter what you name it but put it on your desktop so you can find it easily. Make sure it is a read/write.\n\nStep 3\nFind the disk on your desktop and open it. It should be empty.\n\nStep 4\nOpen Terminal (in the same place as Disk Utility) and type in diskutil list and locate your drive. It should have something similar to the name that shows up in disk utility indented under it (in my example it doesn't)\n\nStep 5\nWe are going to use a Terminal utility called DD to copy the contents bit by bit of the disk image we created to the drive. Make sure you do this right because you can seriously damage your hard drive if you don't. Feel free to ask questions.\nThis is the layout of dd: dd if=<source> of=<target> bs=1m\nSo type dd if= and then drag the drive (the one I named \"Something\") into the terminal window. After that copy the /dev/disk# from the diskutil command of your disk. Make sure it is the right one or you will overwrite your hard drive or other connected drive. Adding onto the dd command type of= and paste the /dev/disk#. Now add bs=1m to that.\nNow in the dd command you should have something that looks like:\ndd if=/Volumes/Something of=/dev/disk1 bs=1m\nThis is what it would look like for my example.\nIf everything looks ok then press enter.\nThis can take a long time and will not tell you what is happening until it is done. It will just be a blank line in the terminal. When you press enter just let it go until it is done. You will know when it is done because it will tell you something like copied something bytes....\nFinal step\nNow that you have done that you should be able to go back into disk utility and repartition your dive under the partition tab. If you don't know how to partition it, just click the plus button near the bottom left, name your partition, and make it Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and click apply.\nRemember if you are unsure, something is different in the steps, or something doesn't work, ask questions!\n", "Q: Traffic to IP addresses matching local network not sent over VPN I have an active VPN connection (L2TP) and try to access a server with IP 192.168.1.29 in the remote network.\nIf my local network uses the same subnetwork (192.168.1.0/24), connections to that subnet are not routed through the VPN, so the connection to the remote server fails. If my local network uses a different subnetwork (e.g., 192.168.2.0/24) the connection succeeds.\nIs there a way to access my server in the first case?\n\nA: No. This is precisely why all of documentation about setting up VPN tunnels/bridges stresses the need for local and remote networks to have different subnets.\nYou will need to change one or the other.\n", "Q: Bootcamp: Windows installer couldn't find drivers. I placed them on the installer USB. Where should they go? I have a Late-2013 model 15 inch rMBP, with El Capitan. I downloaded a Windows 7 64bit ISO from Microsoft. \nOpened up Bootcamp Assistant, created a bootable Flash drive, and downloaded the Windows Bootcamp Support Files from Apple. \nI extracted the zip, and copied the files over to the Bootcamp USB drive.\nBack in Bootcamp Assistant, chose \"install windows\" option, created my partition (100gb), it seemed to be zipping along then it restarted my laptop and booted into the windows installer.\nWindows installer stated that it could not find the necessary drivers, and to insert the disc containing them. There was an option to select folders on the hard drive which contain the files, but it said it could not find them in any of the folders. \nSo.. what did I do wrong? Where should the support files be extracted to? Does it need to be an entirely separate USB from the Windows 7 USB? ugh. Not sure why this isn't working.\n\nA: Just following up. I unmounted the .ISO file, deleted the windows partition and re-created the USB drive... Seems to have worked this time. Gonna chalk the issue up to an anomaly.\nLike @DavidAnderson pointed out in the question comments, users with a Retina MacBook Pro 15 inch should use This version of the support software, not the one I linked in the original question.\nCheers.\n", "Q: iPhone 6S Plus - Macbook Pro USB Charging not reaching 2.1A I've seen various reports of iPhone 6 Plus get 2.1A charging from Macbook Pro.\nhttp://blog.equinux.com/2014/09/iphone-6-and-6-plus-charging-secrets-revealed\nhttp://www.iphonehacks.com/2014/09/iphone-6-iphone-6-plus-can-charged-faster-ipad-charging-adapter.html\nhttp://9to5mac.com/2011/03/25/new-macbook-pros-get-serious-ipad-charging-juice-in-their-usb-ports/\nHowever, I'm unable to replicated that on my own Macbook Pro Retina 15\" 2015.\nIt stays at 1A as below\nCurrent Available (mA): 500\nCurrent Required (mA):  500\nExtra Operating Current (mA):   500\n\nCurrently on Yosemite and plugged in.\nAnyone having the same issue (or has been able to get the Macbook to power out 2.1A?)\n\nA: I have the same 2015 15\" MBP, just upgraded to OS 10.13.4, and with my iPhone 6S+ discharged to 13%, I got: \n\n\n*\n\n*Current Available (mA): 500\n\n*Current Required (mA): 500\n\n*Extra Operating Current (mA): 1600\n\n*Sleep Current (mA): 2100\n\n\nBUT, I only get that in the right USB port.

Now this owned device became a trash?\nI always hated apple and now i hate 10x more. I am not able to use a device that i own.\n\nA: The reason that your AppleID is required is for security reasons.   If you were to lose your iPad or have it stolen, and anyone could just factory reset it and make it theirs, then you'd be upset that Apple allows anyone to register on a stolen iPad.   \nSo, when an iPad is reset the normal way (you are logged in, you select to reset from the menu), your ID is automatically removed so that it can be associated with any ID afterwards.\nIn your case...  since this was not done, the iPad is still bound to your Apple ID.   As you mentioned, you don't recall what this is...  but do you really have so many email addresses that you aren't able to guess at the right one given the first character?\nI suggest visiting https://iforgot.apple.com/appleid#!&section=appleid to try and figure out what your ID was... as there is no way to remove an ID from the iPad in the current state (again, for security reasons).\n", "Q: Apple Remote controlling iPhone I am trying to connect an Apple TV remote to my iPhone so I can test my application with the remote. \nBut I can not find anything that shows how to connnect the devices together.  Does the remote only connect to the Apple TV? \n\nA: Support is not just limited to the Apple TV, as the new Siri/touch sensitive remote can also pair with Macs so you can test tvOS apps in Xcode (presumably). Though only some Macs are supported.\nHowever, there's no iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch support (on iOS 9.2 or earlier at least).\n", "Q: forgot Apple ID after restoring iphone I reset my phone. then when it finally turned back on after restoring itself, it asked for my Apple ID and the password.

I tried with 8GB, 16GB and 32GB cards and none worked. The trick was in the SD card reader. On the left side there was a switch for physical write protection. Toggling the switch and reinserting the card worked!!\n\nA: I tried a different SD card reader, and that fixed the problem.\n", "Q: How do I stop call log syncing back after iOS erase and install?

Now, whenever I start my Mac, I am greeted with a login screen showing two accounts: 1) Mine. 2) Guest user.\nI have Find My Mac turned off, as I know people have suggested that the Find My Mac feature may be responsible for this behavior. Beyond that, I have logged out of my iCloud account from \"System Preferences -> iCloud,\" and also disabled the Guest account from \"System Preferences -> Users & Groups.\" Now it shows the Guest user as off in System Preferences. \nHowever, when I start my Mac, I'm still shown two accounts to log-in.

I am using HDMI to plug in the HDMI to VGA converter (which is plugged in to my monitor). The screen is just black and then the Mac starts flashing. The external monitor does not have any effect. I tried out the wiring and monitor on another windows computer and it worked smoothly.\n\nA: The MacBook Pro's HDMI port has a DVI-D implementation. This means it has no analog signal, which is what VGA relies on to connect. More information here: apple support forums . Apple supplies an HDMI to DVI adapter, which could solve your problem if your monitor has a DVI port. If not, then I would suggest getting a Thunderbolt (Mini DisplayPort) to VGA cable, then using the Thunderbolt port on your Mac to link to your monitor instead.\n", "Q: How to mount a DMG image created with dd? I created an \"emergency\" image of my dying HD using the procedure explained in \nRecover a dead hard drive using dd.\nNow when I try to mount the dmg file I get the message: \"The following disk image couldn't be opened... no mountable files\"\nHow can I mount the image and explore the directories and files?\n\nA: I've gotten shafted doing a similar rescue using dd. I doubt this will help, but it's worth a shot: How to Repair DMG Files. Another comment on there reported success opening a problematic dd created image using filesavage, seems kinda dated and pricey for a maybe.\nI don't know if your drive is still alive or not, if you can do another rescue run with different software, that would probably be your best bet. \nIn the comments on the webpage you linked to, there were suggestions of using ddrescue, a worthwhile read here before you go down that road and it might explain why your (and my) dd backup did not work. \nYou can easily install the current version of ddrescue if you have macports installed sudo port install ddrescue. Failing that, If you have xcode installed, it's trivial to download the latest source code, browse to download in terminal, extract lzip -dc /PathTo/ddrescue.tar.lz | tar -x, cd to extracted ddrescue directory, then make and sudo make install. If not, another alternative is the this ddrescue-gui that I came across, it has ddrescue bundled within the application, you'll want to download the .dmg version. This might be an easy way to go, but you lose the power of log files (you can merge multiple partial recovered images).\nI've used testdisk/photorec in the past with some success, it got some of my files but not all of them, and it was not organized at all by the way, many duplicates. I'd try ddrescue or ddrescue-gui out if I were you, if you want to do the free & command line route. As always, read the manual, it's got some good practices as far as best recovery practices.

Is there a way to fix it other than putting my SSD in the main drive bay?\nThanks folks!\n\nA: yes, there is a way to do this (I've got 2 drives and have been running this config for several years:  Mac OS on main drive, and FAT/winblows on optical bay)..\nyou have to first do the setup of the windows drive with it in the main bay (for some reason it won't recognize in the optical for purposes of BootCamp)...\nThen after you've installed, you can move it over, then you can option-boot from it..\nAn added advantage of this setup is thatif you've got VMWare (fusion) you can also boot it as a virtualized OS from within Mac...\n\nA: I posted an answer where the optical drive was replaced with a hard disk drive (HDD) and the primary drive was a solid state drive (SSD). See this link. I believe the procedure would still work for your configuration. You will not need to swap drives using my method. You will need to install a free copy of virtual box on your OS X disk.\nYour question does not explain how you booted to the Windows installation media. Did you use an external DVD drive or a flash drive? In either case, have you tried booting to the Windows installation media and just executing steps 37 and 38 from the above link? Try preforming these steps with both drives installed in your Mac.\n", "Q: Preventing iCloud out of space pop-ups on 128gb iPhone 6s Is it possible to prevent the iCloud out of space pop-ups from appearing on my iPhone? \nIt pops up every other time I use my phone. I have basically the default+$5 20GB iCloud plan,  but don't plan to upgrade. \nI don't think it's a good usage of iCloud to backup all 128gb of my iPhone... (I'm actually about 90% capacity - obsessive video/photos) \n\nA: You can't turn off the out of space message, instead you will need to manage your iCloud storage space.\nTo manage your storage first find out what is stored in iCloud. Settings > General > Storage & iCloud usage > Manage Storage. \nBackup size to iCloud storage usage is not a 1:1 relationship as your question suggests, I.e. 128gb of iCloud storage is not needed to backup a 128gb phone.  Music and Apps are good examples of items not included in the backup. \nPhoto's and videos are stored in your iCloud space but as part of iCloud photo sharing, not a \"backup\".  As your question suggests this is the largest use of space on your phone, you might want to switch off iCloud photo sharing (settings > iCloud) to save the space.  Another good solution might be to switch this item off and download the Dropbox app, and let it backup photos and vids.\nAnother iCloud space waster might be old device backups.  A new device won't overwrite the old devices last backup.  When that backup is no longer needed it must be manually deleted.\n\"default+$5 20GB iCloud plan\" makes no sense, you likely either have free 5gb plan or the next level up is 50gb for 99cents a month.  5gb should be plenty to backup your 128gb phone, if you turn off iCloud photo.  My 64gb phone is at about 52gb but my backup is just 1.6gb after compression and subtracting what's not backed up as part of a backup.\nIn summary, and to directly answer your question.  No you can't turn off the out of space errors, you must manage the use of iCloud space instead.\n", "Q: Why is the \"Encrypted\" format not available in the list when erasing a USB flash chip in Disk Utility? It shows up for normal, external hard disk drives. Is there a way I can force it to encrypt?\nThe installed OS X is El Capitan.\n\nA: You can't do it from Disk Utility but you can do it from Finder by right-clicking on the partition and choosing Encrypt.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Disk Utility and click on the drive (not the partition)\n\n*Click Erase button\n\n*Choose Name\n\n*Choose Format: OS X Extended (Journaled)\n\n*Choose Scheme: GUID Partition Map\n\n*Click Erase button\n\n*When complete, open Finder\n\n*Right-click on the new drive partition\n\n*Select Encrypt\n\n*Enter passwords\n\n*Finish\n\nA: *\n\n*Open Disk Utility\n\n*In the top left of the Window, select the View drop down\n\n*Select Show All Devices\n\n*Click on the top level external drive (Note in the image below in the sidebar how the parent device is selected)\n\n*Press the Erase button and set the Scheme to GUID Partition Map\nAt this point, the Format option will contain the encryption options:\n\n\nA: For newer versions of Mac OS (Big Sur and onward), Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) is no longer an option. If you erase it unencrypted and then use Disk Utility to encrypt, it gets converted to an APFS file system.\nPreviously, I would always use Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted) for Time Machine backups. Big Sur added Time Machine support for APFS (Encrypted).\n", "Q: iPhone 5 shutting down automatically again and again My iPhone 5 (factory unlocked) of three years (almost) started shutting off by itself since yesterday. It is completely unusable. Most of the time now, as soon as I boot it up again and unlock it, it shuts off. Other times, it stays on for a while before I run any app (stock, third-party, settings) and it shuts off. On rare occasions if I keep it in airplane mode, it stays on. Until, it shuts down later. I suspected something related to network connectivity was triggering something that was causing the phone to turn itself off. I tested by removing the SIM card altogether, but I couldn't find any particular pattern. \nI have tested with the battery at > 50% and > 80%. If it is a software issue, I am assuming an iTunes restore to 9.2 should do (it's in the process). \nIt's running iOS 9.2. No jail-breaks. No recent physical abuses inflicted on the phone to warrant a reaction like this. \nCan anybody please share any ideas on what might be the issue here? \nUpdate: If it is plugged directly to a power adapter, it does not shut off with or without network enabled.\nUpdate: 9.2 restore didn't help. I also experimented by leaving the phone connected to the power adapter but with the adapter not connected to any power source. It didn't shut off all night. Since then, I have been using it without it being connected to anything. The battery has drained from 100% down to 70% so far, with network/wifi and everything enabled. It hasn't shut off. This is perplexing. \n\nA: Since your phone is 3 years old and operates correctly when plugged in, it's time for battery replacement.  Doesn't matter that you think the battery is at 50 or 80 percent, the battery has aged and the indicator is no longer giving you accurate information a result.\n\nA: It could very well be the battery. I'd try a DFU restore if you have solid backups of your stuff \n\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201263\n\n. This restore replaces software AND firmware which is vital to the phones comms between software and hardware. Note: DO NOT RESTORE A BACKUP FROM ICLOUD OR COMPUTER. If your problem is one of the two above, you will be right back to square one again. This is a sure fire method to determine a definite hardware vs software issue.\n", "Q: Portable encrypted USB stick I would like to have an encrypted USB stick that I can use with Windows and OS X.\nI could format it as FAT32 and then have a encrypted image files (more than one due to the file size limitation of 4GB) that I could mount on both, and have the software to do it on the stick itself.\nAny suggestion on the best format?\n\nA: Buy a USB flash drive that uses hardware encryption, where the unlock mechanism doesn't depend a software client, then format it however you prefer. An example of this would be a USB flash drive with a a biometric sensor which can scan a finger, or a built-in keypad where you can enter a PIN to unlock the drive. Several vendors sell hardware encrypted flash drives like these, including Apricorn and Imation.\n\nA: Neither OS X nor Windows have on-board tools to read their mutual encrypted file system (FileVault2 / BitLocker).\nThe only solution I found so far is using a third-party tool:\nBitLocker:\n\n*\n\n*Dislocker\nThis software has been designed to read BitLocker encrypted partitions under Linux and Mac OSX systems.\nThird party file system:\n\n*\n\n*LaCie's Private-Public (download page/Documentation). On the Mac side you have to install OSXFuse additionally.\nThe software seems to be free of charge.\n\nA: You could try VeraCrypt, which is a fork of the now-defunct TrueCrypt. This will let you encrypt the whole device and make a Fat32 or NTFS partition inside the encrypted volume. It supports OS X and Windows.\n** Note that for MacOSX 10.6 and newer, OSXFuse must be installed as per VeraCrypt's \"System Requirements\" at https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=VeraCrypt%20Volume\n\nA: I would look at using an IronKey USB stick.\nhttp://www.ironkey.com/en-US/encrypted-storage-drives/s1000-enterprise.html\nI use one of these at work almost every day, and move files between Mac and Windows systems all the time. It’s the best solution we’ve found to keep data safe.\nThe biggest drawback is the price. They are NOT cheap when compared to other USB stick drives.\n\nA: Rich Trouton is right. A hardware encrypted USB device would solve the problem. Otherwise you can use use a third party cross platform encryption tool like EasyLock. It works on Windows and OS X, but I couldn't make it work on Linux.\n", "Q: Can't complete OS X 10.10.5 software update in App Store I'm trying to update my iMac to OS X 10.10.5, but there seems to be an error when updating.\nWhen I press the update button a message appears to download and restart. When I press it the update starts to install. After some time it get blocked or a message 'show details' is shown, but even after pressing it nothing happens. The update still remains in the App Store.\nHow can I complete the update?\n\nA: Assuming you are already on 10.10.something just get the Combo Updater directly from Apple, rather than from the App Store.\nDirect link: Download OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 Combo Update \n", "Q: Issue with bridging Ethernet to Wi-Fi I've connected a Pi directly to my iMac via Ethernet cable. The Pi has an address 169.254.121.172 and the iMac has an address 169.254.10.117. I can connect to the Pi via SSH and can ssh back to the Mac ok. Internet sharing has been turned on (sharing Wi-Fi to Ethernet). I just can't resolve any addresses on the Internet. I have added the iMac's IP as a gateway and when I traceroute to 8.8.8.8 I can see it hitting the iMac but the packets get no further. There is a bridge0 which has an IP 169.254.10.117 and it does resolve when pinged from the Pi. I'm running Yosemite 10.10.5. Ideas anyone?\n\nA: the 169.254.x.x address space is known as Link-Local addressing & by definition does not leave the building.\n\nIn a computer network, a link-local address is a network address that is valid only for communications within the network segment (link) or the broadcast domain that the host is connected to.\nLink-local addresses are usually not guaranteed to be unique beyond a single network segment. Routers therefore do not forward packets with link-local addresses.\n\nSource : Wikipedia - Link-local address\nA link-local address is usually self-generated by a computer if it cannot find a DHCP server.\nIf your network has no DHCP server [your router ought to contain one] then you need to use manually-assigned addresses in the same subnet as your router/gateway. Nominally, for a home or small business, these would be in the 192.168.x.x space. \n", "Q: Unable to unlock screen if QuickTime was the last app open in fullscreen view I noticed that if I leave QuickTime open in fullscreen and then my screen is locked, I have no way to unlock it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Screen is completely black but for the mouse cursor.\n\n*I can move the mouse across the screen and the attached external monitor.\n\n*Both the external keyboard and the laptop one have no other effect than to make the system beep by each keystroke.\n\n\nIs there a better way than to force power off the machine to unlock it?\n\nA: command+option+esc, than force quit QT Player\n", "Q: How to get ongoing notifications of unread texts? One of my family members texts me at night when they are having nightmares. I want to know when they text me at 4 am instead of sleeping through it.\nIs there a way to make text notifications keep going off until read?\n\nA: The closest you’re going to get is to set Messages alerts to repeat 10 times by going into Settings → Notifications → Messages. There, swipe to the bottom to reveal the Repeat Alerts menu:\n\nThis will cause Messages notifications to ring for 20 minutes after the initial one, or until you’ve read/dismissed them.\nNext, make sure Do Not Disturb is disabled by going into Settings → Do Not Disturb and toggling both Manual and Scheduled to Off (there are no VIP notifications in Messages yet).\nYou could also assign a custom loud and obnoxious text tone to the family member in question that will make it more likely a message from them will wake you up, but that alert sound will trigger for all text messages they send you, even during the daytime.\nCoworkers who were on-call 24/7 also found it useful to turn on LED Flash for Alerts under the HEARING section of Settings → General → Accessibility.\nIf you lay your iPhone face down at night it will flash brightly when you receive a notification, although this will be active at all times for all notifications, so you might need to disable this every morning and re-enable it at night.\n\nA note on Do Not Disturb: if you have a habit of using Do Not Disturb and occasionally forget to turn it back off, you can make sure it gets disabled at night by enabling Scheduled for a 1-minute duration every evening, say, from 10:30 to 10:31 p.m., or sometime before you go to bed.\n", "Q: What \"defaults\" command is used to enable NTFS write support in OS X I remember long time back I came across some terminal command (something like: defaults write...) to enable ntfs write support on OS X.

From what I can see you can only do one at a time. Is there a way to this by folder? I have 60+ images and and doing one at a time will be tedious and time consuming.\n\nA: Maybe try the Carousel app? They're about to discontinue it in March, but it should still be available. From what I recall, you should be able to select multiple images in that app, and you might be able to save them to your Camera Roll from there.\n\nA: I had the same issue, I wanted to transfer multiple photos from my dropbox to my iPhone SE 2020. I didn't find a solution (December 2021), so here's my suggestion [it's kinda slow but you don't have to download one by one]\nWhat I've done is:\n\n*\n\n*Open Safari.\n\n*Navigate to dropbox.com\n\n*DO NOT ENTER THE APP, continue with logging in to your profile on the website.\n\n*Go to the folder with your photos or to all files. Click on the checkbox above all files. Then click the three dots, Download. This will download a zip file to the Files app on your iOS device.\n\n*When it's done, open the Files app. Go to Downloads or Recents and click on the icon of the zip file you just downloaded. [if you downloaded all the files from folder \"FAMILY\", the file should probably be named FAMILY.zip]. This will create a folder [for example \"FAMILY\"] in the Downloads or Recents in the Files app which contains all of the photos you want to download.\n\n*Now open the folder and, in the top-right corner click the three dots > select and click the Select All in the top-left corner.\n\n*After you have selected all of the photos, click the box with the arrow in the bottom-left corner and click save images.\nNow you have all your images in the Recents folder in your photos app.\n\nMy software is iOS 14.7.1\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: For iPad or iPhone users, get free app called Documents.\nTakes a little bit to work out but will do what you want.\nPlease note, this will take photos from your Dropbox and place them back on your camera roll.

This is problematic because their contacts are synced up, which they don't want.\nThe idea is for my cousin to get a new iPhone, which will have all of his old music, games, iCloud stuff, etc. but none of his father's contact info.\nHow is this done?\n\nA: The big problem in your proposed \"ask\" is \"have all his old iCloud stuff\"\nWhat you can do is use one Apple ID with iCloud on two devices. You can even have some of the categories not sync: for example - no contact data, but iCloud has not mechanism to clone or push some content to second account.\nYou have to manually do that by using two devices and then turning off iCloud on the second device and retain the data you wish on that device. Apple purchases always follow the account that purchased them, so you can possibly mix two \"buy\" accounts for a short time, but the next time an app update happens, you'll need both account passwords to update everything.\nIt might be time to make a second account and move forward with each person re-buying / controlling what is contained in each account.\nThe good news - is contacts is really easy to separate so start there and then you can decide how much work it was to separate those so that each device has their own contacts and then repeat for each \"bin\" of data that comes with iCloud/Apple ID.\n", "Q: MS Word 2011 forces wrong keyboard change For some strange reason, and since a very long time, every time I open word, the keyboard is automatically changed to Japanese Hiragana. Obviously, being Italian, I do not at all want such an auto change. Is there any way to reverse this? Is this a Word problem or something related to the OS, or perhaps something to do with both?\nUpdate\nFollowing comments, I tried unchecking the box in Word > Preferences > Edit for \"Match font with keyboard\". No change, but I found out that the change takes place during the opening of Word, stays there while the Project Gallery is open, and is reversed as soon as the new document gets opened, so once the new document appears, the keyboard changes back to the correct US Extended keyboard.\nUpdate copied from the forum\nNeither the Normal.dotm, nor the Match font with keyboard box in Preferences>Edit, nor Tools>Language and selecting Italian, none of this did anything. This issue is mysterious...\nAnother copied update\nThe Language and Text thing (System preferences > L&T > put Italian at the top of the language list) did not work at all. Plus, I want my Mac to speak English, and this change makes System Preferences speak Italian, which I decidedly do not like. Which is why I reversed it.\n\nA: Tom in the comments here was getting to it. Too bad John Korchok was quicker in replying over at the forum. He suggested this:\n\nThat means there is one last thing you can try. Please open Applications>Microsoft Office 2011>Additional Tools>Microsoft Language Register and open Microsoft Language Register. Check that the dropdown is set to English, then OK out and test Word once more.\n\nAnd I commented on it with this:\n\nYep, that was it. Changed Japanese to English, and the keyboard change vanished. But the Phonetic Guide option also vanished… is there any way to have both no keyboard change and the Phonetic Guide? Because if I ever find myself typing Japanese, I might need that phonetic guide… Of course, if that ever happens, I can just reopen the register, but if there was a way of keeping the option even with the register saying English it would be great.\n\nThat was 2 secs ago so he hasn't had time to reply to the \"would be great\" part just yet :).\n", "Q: Can I use an Xbox 360 controller with the 4th Gen Apple TV (2015)?

Answers will still be useful though for another time.\n\nA: The way to check all percentages is:\nbrctl monitor com.apple.CloudDocs | grep %\n\nPossibly some other commands will help as well if the above has too much detail. Open terminal.app and issue the command:\nbrctl log -w\n\nThat will dump all sorts of iCloud sync data and debugging status - most of which won't be relevant, but you can watch it over time to see if any of the internal information allows you to calculate things or just know that something is happening or has had an error.\nbrctl status | grep foreground\n\nThe above command will show active containers and you might be able to monitor the specific container that has activity in a second window:\nbrctl monitor com.apple.CloudDocs | grep filename\n\nThe monitor command could slow things down as it dumps a lot of status to my screen as I have a lot of files in iCloud currently - but it does show periodic % estimates for the specific files being uploaded.

But today as soon as I left the house my iPhone immediately chewed through 1.5Gigs of data before my carrier luckily shut it down (I have a 1 gig plan).\nThe usage is all from the 'Media Services' item in system services, but I don't know what that actually is (cellular->System Services->Media Services)\nAll of the following settings are off and were already off before the data use, what else do I need to do to stop this?   \n\n\n*\n\n*Settings->Music->Use Cellular Data  (off)\n\n*Settings->iCloud->iCloud\nDrive->Use Cellular Data (off)\n\n*Settings->iTunes & App Stores->Use Cellular \nData (off)\n\n\nCould this have anything todo with iCloud Music Library setting, which I think was turned on for me as part of Apple Music?\n\nA: After some extensive testing and looking at the data usage time period, I have concluded that I was bitten by the 'wifi assist' feature (which is now set to off).   The massive sync of songs to my device from the cloud was actually when I was or should have been connected to my wifi, and was 'assisted' by my cellular connection, even though that sync would not have been allowed given my settings if just on cellular and not wifi.\n", "Q: Slow login and Terminal loading time in Yosemite, possibly related to open directory I have a problem with slow login times in Yosemite.  Logging in is speedy after booting, but after a while (a few days usually) it slows down and can take 20-30 seconds.  The time to load a new Terminal window / tab also increases.  If I reboot, the problem is fixed...for a while.  I tried the answers in this question and nothing seemed to work.  I ran the profiling suggested here and this part of the output looks suspicious:\n+   ! 8118 ???  (in login)  load address 0x10583c000 + 0x2a8f  [0x10583ea8f]\n+   !   8118 openpam_dispatch  (in libpam.2.dylib) + 277  [0x7fff86957a7d]\n+   !     8117 ???

Any ideas on how I can further diagnose or fix this issue?\n\nA: I had the same problem everywhere authentication is needed after upgrading to High Sierra. Sampling login process gave similar output where ODRecordAuthenticationAllowed takes longer to complete than usual. The call graph shows that the authentication request dispatched from transaction_simple probably encountered some multithreading issue as caught by semaphore_wait_trap that consumed most of the runtime. So, something else must have been busy with authentication ALL the time.\nIn my case the culprit turns out to be the printer. After updating the printer's driver and changing to use AirPrint from CUPS, login, terminal, browsing etc. are now all working to normal, and sampling login process again produces nothing as now the authentication request is too fast to catch.\n", "Q: OSX Services - character substitution + for _ I've created a service to use primarily in a browser for searching IMDB, so instead of copying and pasting the film's name I just select the text and run the service I created which will automatically search IMDB for the selected text.

It needs a certain software patch currently to make it run successfully in the latest OS, and we are sending the patch as a standalone separate app, which when installed, does the necessary things (mainly updating a Config file within the <MyApp>.app folder in /Applications). After this, double clicking the app icon in Finder launches it fine. But when we try to launch it by clicking the icon in the Launchpad, it doesn't open. (this is the problem which we are solving, it won't open even from Finder by double clicking without the patch).\nSo I tried to refresh the Launchpad by these things:\nrm ~/Library/Application Support/Dock/*.db\ndefaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true; killall Dock\ncd $TMPDIR../0/com.apple.dock.launchpad/db/ && rm db*\n\nNothing works.

So since nobody on Apple.SE, Unix.SE or other sites was able to help me with my little WWAN problem, I've taken a look at the configd source and I was wondering... suppose I'd want to give patching the code a shot, what dev tools would I need and is there something about OS X keeping me from replacing the vanilla configd binary with a patched one (on a new installation on an external drive so as not to render my OS X productive system unusable)?\n\nA: You can use XCode - it's in the App Store, and free. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12\nDownload that whole directory, open up the XCode project: configd.xcodeproj\nThen, you can build it using XCode.\nYou'll probably need to turn off the code-signing protections - Security and Privacy panel in System Prefs. Allow Apps downloaded from anywhere. Not sure if Apple has additional protection for system binaries.\nTry it on a different drive, or in a VM and see what happens.\n", "Q: Two Time Capsules with same disk name - Time Machine settings \"mix up\" targets? I added a second Time Capsule to my network. At first I configured the MacBook Air to use it and everything went well. Then I configured a MacMini Server to use it and Time Machine Settings seem to be confused:\n\nThe first (...nw3) has 3TB, so that's ok. The second (TC) has 2TB, so something is not right here.\nI know, that I added the first, was confused by both showing 2TB and then removed the 3TB one. Interestingly the 3TB remained, but the 2TB was gone. So I added the 2TB time capsule and noticed, that all show as 3TB. (The ExtHD04 is a USB drive, so the icon is obviously wrong for that.) It looks like as if in the settings the destinations are picked by disk name and with two of the same name, it picks just which \"comes first\".\nEDIT: A few backups later I notice this: The display is sometimes correct on my MacBook Air; the display is always wrong on my two MacMini's. This applies to El Capitan 10.11.1 and 10.11.2. I'll file a bug report and see what Apple says. /EDIT\nQ1: Are problems to be expected, when two time capsules with the same disk name are in use?\nQ2: Is it recommended to rename the disks?\nQ3: Can I fix it in another way and if yes, how?\n(Never renamed a time capsule disk - I assume one can do it when erasing the disk in the time capsule settings via Air Port Utility.)\nI searched for such issues, but all results gave no hint for problems and I got the impression, that this should just work. However, it makes me a bit nervous, as I would expect the backup system not to show such behaviour.\n(All running El Capitan, 2TB Time Capsule is Gen4, 3TB Time Capsule is Gen5; MacBook Air backs up over WiFi, MacMini Server over ethernet cable.)\n\nA: A1: I do believe TM uses UUIDs to identify backup servers. There shouldn't be any issues with duplicate names.\nA2: Renaming the disks would probably help you identify it, but it is unlikely that it would solve this problem. As mentioned in A1, TM uses UUIDs to identify disks.\nA3: I would try removing the disk through the \"Select Disk\" button below the disk list (this does not delete your existing backups) and reselecting it.\nI would believe that this was likely caused by a graphical glitch.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: iPod email rescue address changed My rescue email address changed for my iPod and I cannot remember the answers to my security questions.

I want a power adapter for a MacBook Air that matches Australian outlets (without a separate adapter).  It seems reasonable that if I buy such a thing from http://www.apple.com/au, it will have the right outlet format.\nUnfortunately, there's no language to that effect on the product page, and if I add it to cart there's no indication that the adapter won't be US-format.  Will adapters purchased from http://www.apple.com/au be Australian format?\n\nA: Have a look at: Apple World Travel Adapter Kit\nIf you get the adaptor kit it works with your existing power supply. You just pop off the end you have, and slide on the new end. It's just changing out the prongs for the correct one needed.\nAlso works with most other Apple products.\nThis isn't like a normal international adaptor which sits between the socket and the existing plug - it replaces the existing plug.\n\nA: Anything you buy from the Australian Apple Store is going to have an Australian power outlet plug. I'd be more wary about buying from Australian 'suppliers' from eBay or similar. You'll probably run into fake chargers there (even with Australian power plugs). There's a good list of differences in the article \"Real vs. Fake Apple Power Adapters: 4 Signs of a Fake from Verified.org.\nI unknowingly bought one years ago, and it is still working but does get a bit too hot for my liking so I'm always been a bit suss on them.\n", "Q: El Capitan Mail: How to cancel processes in Activity window? I've found a number of questions about the \"floating\" behavior of the Mail Activity window in El Capitan.  I have a different question:  In all previous versions of Mail.app, processes in the Activity window could be cancelled by clicking on the \"Stop\" button.  In El Capitan, the Stop button no longer seems to exist.  So the Activity window tells me if something is stuck, but doesn't give me any way to cancel a process.  Is there any way to get that functionality back?\nEdited: Here's an example of what I'm talking about.  This window has been stuck on \"Connecting...\" for more than 20 minutes.  There's no way to stop it and there's no way to find out what's going on.  Turning off Wi-Fi and restarting the app (even rebooting!) didn't do anything; that \"Connecting...\" process is just still there.\n\n\nA: To cancel the activity without the (X) button that is gone since El Capitan, on Mail versions with the V4 format, it seems to be enough to stop the app, go to cd ~/Library/Mail/ and remove the three ExternalUpdates.* files. \nThese seem to be the files that keep the queue of remote operations. \n\nA: The Activity window doesn't offer any method for correcting problems anymore, but its status messages will alert you when something is going wrong with your mail service, and usually help you figure out what it is. \nIf the Activity window shows problems with one or more of your Mail accounts, you'll want to try the two additional troubleshooting aids provided by Apple.\nApple's Connection Doctor can help you diagnose problems you're having with Mail.\nThe Connection Doctor will confirm that you're connected to the Internet and then check each mail account to ensure you can connect to receive mail, as well as connect to send mail. The status for each account is then displayed in the Connection Doctor window. If you're unable to connect to the Internet, the Connection Doctor will offer to run Network Diagnostics to track down the cause of the problem.\nMost Mail issues are likely to be account related rather than Internet connection related, however. To help troubleshoot account issues, the Connection Doctor offers both an overview for each account and a detailed log of each attempt to connect to the appropriate email server.\nRunning Connection Doctor\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Connection Doctor from the Window menu of the Mail program.\n\n*Connection Doctor will automatically start the checking process and display the results for each account. Connection Doctor first checks each account's ability to receive mail, and then checks each account's ability to send mail, so there will be two status listings for each mail account.\n\n*Any account marked in red has some type of connection issue. Connection Doctor will include a brief summary of the issue, such as incorrect account name or password. To find out more about the account issues, you'll want to have the Connection Doctor display the details (logs) of each connection.\n\n\nView Log Details in the Connection Doctor\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Connection Doctor window, click the 'Show Detail' button.\n\n*A tray will slide out from the bottom of the window. When they're available, this tray will display the contents of the logs. Click the 'Check Again\" button to rerun the Connection Doctor and display the logs in the tray.\n\n\nYou can scroll though the logs to find any errors and see a more detailed reason for any problems. The one problem with the detail display in the Connection Doctor is that the text can't be searched, at least from within the Connection Doctor window. If you have multiple accounts, scrolling through the logs can be cumbersome. You could of course copy/paste the logs to a text editor and then try to search for specific account data, but there is another option: the Mail logs themselves, which your system keeps tabs on.\nWhile the Activity window provides a real-time look at what's occurring as you send or receive mail, the Mail logs go one step further and keep a record of each event. Since the Activity window is real-time, if you glance away or even blink, you may miss seeing a connection issue. The Mail logs, on the other hand, keep a record of the connection process that you can review at your leisure.\nEnabling Mail Logs\nApple includes an AppleScript to turn Mail logging on.\nOnce it's turned on, the Console logs will keep track of your Mail logs until you quit the Mail application. If you want to keep Mail logging active, you'll have to re-run the script before each time you launch Mail.\nTo turn Mail logging on:\n\n\n*\n\n*If Mail is open, quit Mail.\n\n*Open the folder located at: /Library/Scripts/Mail Scripts.\n\n*Double-click the 'Turn on Logging.scpt' file.\n\n*If the AppleScript Editor window opens, click the 'Run' button in the top left corner.\n\n*If a dialog box opens, asking if you wish to run the script, click 'Run.'\n\n*Next, a dialog box will open, asking if you wish to 'Enable socket logging for checking or sending mail. Quit Mail to turn logging off.' Click the 'Both' button.\n\n*Logging will be enabled, and Mail will launch.\n\n\nViewing Mail Logs\nMail logs are written as Console messages that can be displayed in Apple's Console application. Console allows you to view the various logs your Mac keeps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Console, located at /Applications/Utilities/.\n\n*In the Console window, expand the Database Searches area in the left-hand pane.\n\n*Select the Console Messages entry.\n\n*The right-hand pane will now display all messages written to the Console. Mail messages will contain the sender ID com.apple.mail. You can filter out all of the other Console messages by entering com.apple.mail into the Filter field in the top right-hand corner of the Console window. You can also use the Filter field to find just the specific email account that's having problems. For instance, if you're having problems connecting to Gmail, try entering 'gmail.com' (without the quotes) in the Filter field. If you're only having a connection problem when sending mail, try entering 'smtp' (without the quotes) in the Filter field to only show logs when sending email.\n\n\nYou can now use the Mail logs to find the type of problem you're having, such as passwords being rejected, connections being rejected, or servers down. Once you locate the problem, use Mail to make corrections to the Account settings, then try running the Connection Doctor again for a quick test. The most common problems are wrong account name or password, connecting to the wrong server, the wrong port number, or using the wrong form of authentication.\nUse the logs to check all of the above against the information your email provider gave you to set up your email client. Finally, if you still have issues, copy the Mail logs showing the problem and ask your email provider to review them and provide assistance.\nSource.\n\nA: It appears that you have to run connection doctor in addition to viewing the activity monitor window in Mail.app now in El Capitan to see which account or mailbox my be having problems.  In previous versions of Mac OS X, you only had to view activity monitor.\nThere is now a \"Log Connection Activity\" check box in connection doctor, which creates a more detailed log file in ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Logs/Mail/.\nThis does seems like a step backwards, but at least there is more detailed logging that I do not remember in previous versions.\n", "Q: iPhone 5C downgrade iOS 9 to iOS 8 I bit the bullet and upgraded to iOS 9.1, and the phone now moves like it's an iPhone 3GS. I can see iOS 8.x is no longer signed, but fortunately I have SHSH of iOS 8.2 saved.\nHow can I downgrade without losing my warranty?\nI've heard jailbraking will void warranty, but I guess jailbraking then flashing an iOS version that removes the jailbreak should allow my phone to still be in warranty.\nPS: This is not a duplicate of Can I install any iOS version I wish by picking and choosing which firmware to restore?, because it talks about restoring from IOS9 to usinged IOS8 version with SHSH blobs.\n\nA: You can't do it, unless you saved your signature while iOS 8 was still being signed. Without a saved signature, there's no way for anyone except Apple to install iOS 8 on any device.\n\nA: Jailbreak will prevent Apple from providing you service/support. As mentioned in the other comments restoring to the current iOS will fix that. The main question that hasn't been posed is : \"What is the memory storage of your device?\" Current versions of iOS have been optimized for upgraded hardware but you shouldn't experience that drastic of a reduction in overall phone performance. The first thing I'd look at is how much storage am I using before the OS.\n", "Q: Apple Watch is taking heart rate readings while being held in the air, not pressed against skin. How is this possible? While holding the watch in the air, the heart rate glance provides a heart rate that jumps around.\nHow is this possible?  The sensor on the back is pressed up against nothing.\n\nA: The heart rate sensor on the Apple Watch works by processing signal from two photodiodes. It is designed to have two green LED reflect from the wrist, but readings are likely due to picking up light reflected off another surface.\nFrom Apple:\n\nThe heart rate sensor in Apple Watch uses what is known as\n  photoplethysmography. This technology, while difficult to pronounce,\n  is based on a very simple fact: Blood is red because it reflects red\n  light and absorbs green light. Apple Watch uses green LED lights\n  paired with light‑sensitive photodiodes to detect the amount of blood\n  flowing through your wrist at any given moment. When your heart beats,\n  the blood flow in your wrist — and the green light absorption — is\n  greater. Between beats, it’s less. By flashing its LED lights hundreds\n  of times per second, Apple Watch can calculate the number of times the\n  heart beats each minute — your heart rate. In addition, the heart rate\n  sensor is designed to compensate for low signal levels by increasing\n  both LED brightness and sampling rate.\n\n", "Q: Icon without app name in Notifications (iOS 9.2) There is an icon without app name in the Notifications screen of my iPhone (iOS 9.2).\nAny idea what app may be causing this?\n\n\nA: That is the Apple News app icon. \nIt should appear normally if you are in a region that is supported by Apple News. \nIts availability is dictated by the Region setting under Settings > General > Language & Region.\nIf that is set to a region that is supported by Apple News, then it is likely a bug. Try rebooting your device.\nIf that is not set to a region that is supported, the malformed entry in your Notifications settings may be a result of having used one of several 'methods' to force the availability of Apple News. \nIt should not present any problems for your device, but if you really want it fixed/removed, a restore may be in order.\n", "Q: Why has iTunes not found/downloaded all of my purchased songs?

Why is this and where can I find the rest of the songs? Thank you\n\nA: You would need to work with Apple support to track down one specific case - but it could be that items are no longer available for re-download in your region. 500 seems like a lot of churn, but Apple doesn't guarantee you a re-download from the cloud so you might want to get your backup copies and restore them that way.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7101766?language=en\n\n*https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html\nTo contact support check your country here and then use the link at the bottom of the page: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204411\n", "Q: I think I messed up the Fusion Drive on my 2TB iMac I want to ask you how can I get back together my Fusion Drive (merge HDD and SSD together).

I also checked ownership and permissions of .bash_history. Later I also tried to delete this file. This answer didn't help either. My default shell definitely is bash.\n\nA: Begin isolating the source of the problem by removing any customizations of Bash’s history. For example, any code that sets shell variables that begin with HIST, or uses set -o to set either the history or histexpand shell options.\nThe per-session command history code in /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal attempts to maintain compatibility with Bash’s history variables, and tries to detect when the user is probably doing something it can’t be compatible with and disables the mechanism in that case (because the user is doing something arbitrary, like loading, saving or modifying the history). However, if you have scripts that run the history command, that code has no way of knowing in advance; you’ll need to either update your code to maintain compatibility with the new per-session command history, or disable the per-session history by setting SHELL_SESSION_HISTORY=0 as described in the documentation in /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal.\nIf you’re not customizing HISTFILE, HISTTIMEFORMAT or the histappend shell option, another thing to check is if your shell startup script(s) modify either PROMPT_COMMAND variable or the EXIT trap without concatenating the previous value to avoid wiping it out.\nSee the comments in /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal for a description of how the mechanism works and how to customize or disable it.\n\nA: See this answer from a similar question. El Capitan made some changes whereby it tries to do session-dependent history. You can likely fix your problem just by running touch ~/.bash_sessions_disable to create a flag file to disable this behaviour.\n", "Q: Make Siri Ding Again on Pressing Home Button So according to this Apple support article, Siri doesn't make that bell sound after holding the Home button to launch it on iPhones with iOS 9 or later.

I have dropped it twice now and both pretty hard times (dropped open). After this I started to notice kernel panics initially when I would open up a folder full of pictures. This continued and El Capitan was released so I figured I should just wipe it clean and start fresh, thinking the problem might be software related. \nAfter initially just installing the new OS over the existing one(leaving all my previous data intact), I finally just decided to wipe it clean and do a fresh install. This was complete and I thought that I might have solved the issue. \nI started to experience more and more frequent KPs yet still no predictable schedule to when they would occur(some a hour apart, some ten minutes). At this point I started to look into the hardware side. I ran AHT (both sticks of RAM) and I got a 4MEM/60/40000000 error = memory module. \nOnce the error pointed to my issue I then began to open up the MBPs' backplate and preceded to reseat the memory in hopes of a simple fix, which did not work. I then tested each stick separately and in each respective bank. The results were as follows:  \nbank/dimm01(lower)  \nstick A = no error  \nstick B = no error  \nbank/dimm02(upper)  \nstick A = 4MEM/60  \nstick B = 4MEM/60  \n\nI figure at this point that the bank/dimm02(upper) slot is bad (probably damaged from a drop of something similar).\nI take stick B seat it into bank/dimm01(lower) and boot it off one stick. \nJust to be extra sure I ran rember too and it came back clean. Finally I thought the problem was 'resolved'.\n24 later, on the single stick boot, guess what? another KP and not just one, a nice and lovely triple kick of repeated KP for my holiday splendor.\nDoes anyone have any insight?

The only FW HDD I have is my backup HDD.\n\nA: I will forward you to this answer. To install Windows you will have to first install a free copy of VirtualBox. This software takes very little drive space and is required to boot from the Windows iso file.

To fix\n  the problem, quit all MIDI applications (including this one) and\n  launch them again.\nFor now, MIDI Monitor will not be able to spy on the output of other\n  MIDI applications, but all other features will still work.\n\nThis leads me to believe the problem is with my OS upgrade rather than my hardware. I upgraded to 10.11.2 with the hopes that it may fix the issue, but it was to no avail. \nWhat can I do to restore midi function in my macbook pro? This was working prior to el capitan upgrade.\n\nA: We had the same midi issue after upgrading to El Capitan 11.10.2. After working many hours with Apple's support team, they finally suggested we revert back to Yosemite. Weak sauce or apple sauce, you decide :) \n\nA: Instead of downgrading the OS I upgraded my midi controller. Not particularly relevant, but I switched from m-audo to akai.\nThis fixed the issue, even though the previous device was listed as compliant on the MFs website. I made sure the new device was also listed as USB compliant. \n", "Q: \"pkd\" process on El Capitan I just upgraded to OS X 10.11.2 (El Cap), and overall it seems to be working OK.\nOne strange thing: there's a \"pkd\" process which is taking ~150% CPU, all the time, even though I'm not doing anything.\n(At first I thought it might have something to do with Spotlight reindexing or something, but 12 hours later it's still going.)\nWhat is it?  Can I stop it?\n\nA: The manpage says:\nNAME\n pkd -- management and supervision daemon for plug-in services\n\nSYNOPSIS\n pkd [-v]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n pkd manages plug-ins for the PlugInKit subsystem. It is a classic launch\n agent managed by launchd.\n\nSounds pretty safe to kill it off, by opening a terminal and running:\nlaunchctl stop com.apple.pluginkit.pkd\n\nIt should restart itself whenever it's required (possibly immediately).\n\nA: I uninstalled all plug-ins to my Safari and that cured the problem.......very annoying process\n\nA: If you use the Roboform plug-in with Safari, you might be having a known issue with CPU usage that can be fixed only by removing it.\nMore info:\nhttps://discussions.apple.com/message/30212342#message30212342\n\nA: I killed Tunnelblick and Karabiner-Elements, then force-quit pkd in Activity Monitor, then restarted Tunnelblick and Karabiner-Elements.

Using\n... label=\"Seagate Backup Plus Drive\" none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse\n\nshould interpret the name as Seagate Backup Plus Drive and\n... label=Seagate Backup Plus Drive none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse\n\nwill interpret the name as Seagate.\nThe better solution is to rename the volume to one word without spaces or use an escape sequence like in this answer.\n\nA: You need to escape the spaces with \\040, so it would be as in the following example:\nLABEL=Seagate\\040Backup\\040Plus\\040Drive none ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse\n\nSee \"EXAMPLES\" in man fstab from a Terminal.\n", "Q: I erased the partition where Windows 10 was previously installed.

How can I merge all of this with my mac partition? I heard that I should be able to click \"-\" when BOOTCAMP is selected and then expand my mac partition to use the unused space, but as you can see, I can not click the \"-\" button.

You first have to remove the Bootcamp partition and then expand the FileVault volume.\nTo remove the Bootcamp partition and resize the CoreStorage Volume Group (containing the FileVault volume) the Mac has to be booted to Internet Recovery Mode. Recovery Mode is not sufficient because the Recovery HD has to be moved. The actual boot volume or partition can't be moved.\nPreparation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Detach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive)\n\n*Restart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing alt cmd R at startup.\nThe prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.\nOn a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.\nI recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.\nAlternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan) or a thumb drive containing a full system (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan).\nRemove bootcamp partition and expand CoreStorage Volume Group\n\n\n*\n\n*Booted to Internet Recovery Mode open Utilities → Terminal in the menubar and enter:  diskutil list to get the disk identifiers and diskutil cs list to get a CoreStorage listing.

Often, in a case like yours, there is a forgotten directory with installers around somewhere.\n\nA: I'm normally not the kind of user to rely on \"cleanup\" apps, but I will have to say that MacPaw's CleanMyMac 3 has been wonderful at freeing up space on my computer (Mid-2012 Macbook Pro Retina with stock 256GB SSD). The first time I ran it I cleared out about 22GB of disk space, and I'm regularly removing anywhere from 40MB to 2GB of data cruft a day as of late.\n", "Q: Is it possible to disable CPU throttling on a MacBook Pro with a completely dead (not recognized) battery? I have a MBP late 2011 running El Capitan, recently my battery died (x over the icon and \"no battery available\" in the dropdown.) I've noticed since then that CPU intensive tasks are very slow, and I read that without a battery macs will throttle the CPU to half capacity.\nSo now I'm looking for one of two solutions:\n1) Either somehow disable the throttling, or \n2) Trick the computer into thinking it has a battery.\nIn regard to the first one I've tried a few things such as described here, removing a plist file that supposedly controlled it, but that hasn't helped. Any help would be greatly appreciated, TIA.\nEdit: I've looked over the question about a 2006 MacBook, it's similar but I've tried everything outlined there and nothing has worked. I'm curious if there are any new ideas. I think the difference may be El Capitan.\n\nA: Not practically. You're better off selling the computer for parts or getting a replacement battery / having the Mac serviced by a professional.\nNon user replaceable batteries are very vulnerable to damage and lithium battery fires are no joke. Even global companies have struggled with making safe products from brand new parts (galaxy 7) so please don't cut corners on safety when Apple batteries are involved - especially with repair parts or unauthorized / uninsured repair shops.\nSeveral people have tried disabling kernel extensions and tried to patch the firmware to varying levels of “success” and “this may damage your Mac permanently” comfort.\n\nA: This is my solution (disable aggressive throttling) and I'm the developer.  I don't have to do something more dangerous as instructed in this article.  CPU/GPU will be throttled again after wake-up from system sleep/hibernation or when it becomes really hot (seems so).  There is a kernel extension compiled for OSX 10.11.  NO WARRANTY!\n", "Q: How to stop verification required when installing free apps I've already done open the billing information , but the thing is \"none\" doesn't exists , there only \"visa , master and Amex\"\n\nA: Sorry, but there is no way around that to download apps, even free ones. You will have to provide the App Store with a debit/credit card on file. Don't ask me why, I don't work for Apple.\nIf you don't want to use your real card, you can use an old card (even a prepaid one), even if there's nothing on it. You just can't purchase any paid apps and the card must not be past it's expiration\nThere's an official Apple support article on this, as found by IconDaemon.\n", "Q: What does this mean: \"Wi-Fi has the self-assigned IP address...& will not be able to connect to the Internet\"? I have internet access but I noticed that in System Preferences/Network, although the W-Fi status is \"On\" this statement is below: \"Wi-Fi has the self-assigned IP address XXX.XXX.X.XX and will not be able to connect to the Internet.\" There is a yellow dot preceding the \"Wi-Fi / Self-Assigned IP\" icon on the far left of the System Preferences/ Network window. The Network Diagnostics shows all the items under Network Status as green. My modem does not have a router. It is behind a Verizon (ISP) router that I do not physically own or have access to. I can only access the settings at: \"my home.modem manufacturer's name.com\". Is this still a problem that needs correcting? Thank you. \nUPDATE: My ISP says: \"Okay that's the issue as it is a 6100 modem it does not have a feature or wireless option you need to get one wireless router from ups store...I will send you a free modem which is an advanced one..\"\nMacBook Pro with Retina display, OS X Mavericks (10.9.5), MacBookPro11,3; Airport Time Capsule\n\nA: So there are two things happening when a wifi device wants to use \"internet\". First it has to join the wifi network using an AP (access point) If there is a password like WPA that needs to be supplied. Next the device needs to get an IP address. That information comes from a router. It is not always necessarily true that the router and AP are the same piece of equipment. If the IP address acquisition (typically via DHCP) fails or times out the device will assign itself an IP from 169.254.X.X. However this IP can never talk to the Internet and the device knows that so that's why the message is provided. Sometimes this is simply resolved via a reboot of the router, but it could also be a hardware failure, especially if the AP and router are two separate devices.\n\nA: I would check Airport Utility to see what the problem is. If there is a yellow dot by the Time Capsule, that means that it is not properly connecting to the Internet. This means either the Ethernet cable is loose, or it is not configured properly. Try checking all cables or restarting the router, or try to reconfigure the Airport. If all fails, see this guide on Apple's website on resetting/troubleshooting the router. \nIf the Internet bubble is yellow and the Time Capsule is green, then your router is messed up and you need to contact the owner to reset it. \nHope that helps. \n", "Q: Expanding a Fusion Drive partition I created a partition on my Fusion Drive when I first purchased my iMac running Yosemite, and I would like to now resize that drive (\"Data\" in the screenshot below), but Disk Utility doesn't allow it (the \"Partition\" button is disabled). \n\ndiskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0\n    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            121.0 GB   disk0s2\n    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s3\n/dev/disk1 (internal, physical):\n    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *3.0 TB     disk1\n    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1\n    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            2.7 TB     disk1s2\n    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.1 MB   disk1s3\n    4:                  Apple_HFS Data                    326.8 GB   disk1s4\n/dev/disk2 (internal, virtual):\n    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +2.8 TB     disk2\n                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2, disk1s2\n                                  03BC8817-F05E-4FC3-9A5C-50130CDAB3AB\n                                  Unencrypted Fusion Drive\n\ndiskutil cs list\nCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found)\n|\n+-- Logical Volume Group DFD31523-36BE-47AB-A666-54B64038E46B\n    =========================================================\n    Name:         Macintosh HD\n    Status:       Online\n    Size:         2793817645056 B (2.8 TB)\n    Free Space:   0 B (0 B)\n    |\n    +-< Physical Volume FEC1934B-53F8-49A1-ABE6-5155689D9A68\n    |   ----------------------------------------------------\n    |   Index:    0\n    |   Disk:     disk0s2\n    |   Status:   Online\n    |   Size:     120988852224 B (121.0 GB)\n    |\n    +-< Physical Volume 4F985EA2-E22B-451F-BEB3-E5EF76D14A59\n    |   ----------------------------------------------------\n    |   Index:    1\n    |   Disk:     disk1s2\n    |   Status:   Online\n    |   Size:     2672828792832 B (2.7 TB)\n    |\n    +-> Logical Volume Family 27D90160-503D-48B7-B434-798CEE738260\n        ----------------------------------------------------------\n        Encryption Type:         None\n        |\n        +-> Logical Volume 03BC8817-F05E-4FC3-9A5C-50130CDAB3AB\n            ---------------------------------------------------\n            Disk:                  disk2\n            Status:                Online\n            Size (Total):          2787630755840 B (2.8 TB)\n            Revertible:            No\n            LV Name:               Macintosh HD\n            Volume Name:           Macintosh HD\n            Content Hint:          Apple_HFS\n            LVG Type:              Fusion, Sparse\n\nIs there another way to expand the partition? Maybe a third party software solution? \n\nA: The good message: you can resize both partitions with on-board tools. The bad message: you can't change the start block of a partition to a lower block number (i.e expand Data to lower block numbers). The partition Data has to be deleted first.\nPreparation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your Mac\n\n*Safe all files and folders in Data to an external drive\n\n*If you don't have an external drive you can also save the files to Macintosh HD – if it contains enough free space for all files (~223 GB) and the expansion size of Data. Example: If you want to expand Data by 673 GB (to 1000 GB!) you need at least 926 GB (223 GB + 673 GB + ~30 GB some free space for the system) free space on Macintosh HD.\n\n*Detach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive)\n\n*Restart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing alt cmd R at startup. Booting to Recovery Mode is not conducive because the Recovery HD will be moved in one of the steps below. And you can't move a partition used as a boot volume.  \nThe prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.\nOn a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an Apple/Akamai server.\nI recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.\nAlternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan) or a thumb drive containing a full system (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan). If you boot to a full system and login as admin you have to prepend sudo to execute special commands like gpt ...!\nRemove the partition Data and shrink the  CoreStorage Volume Group\n\n\n*\n\n*Booted to Internet Recovery Mode open Utilities → Terminal in the menubar and enter:  diskutil list to get the disk identifiers and diskutil cs list to get a CoreStorage listing.

I like to playback a lot of different videos for a theatrical play  without having to pause or having a dead time in between the videos.\nDo I need a specific software? Can I do it with Quick Time player? Or VLC?\n\nA: Unless you are willing to edit the videos together in one long video. I would use VLC, or load them all into iTunes (if the videos are iTunes compatible) and make a playlist to playback your videos.\nWith VLC you you should see very little dead time between videos, but you might get some jumping on the screen if they are of different resolutions. With iTunes it can be hit or miss depending on the format of the videos.\nHere's the VLC playlist setup instructions: https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Playlist/\nYou could do what you want with QuickTime, but it's rather tricky, and not as full proof as it was with QuickTime 7, or as easy as it is with VLC.\nThere's also the Elmedia Player, MPlayerX (which is based on open source), and 5KPlayer if you are looking for an alternatives to VLC or iTunes. I have used the Elmedia Player before when I needed to have Flash videos play in the mix. But I don't know if I would go with the 5KPlayer (even though it does supposedly have AirPlay support). It's from a Chines company that doesn't seem to be fully Apple Certified from what I can tell, so I'm not sure I would trust them.\nI should also note that you will want the videos on a FAST SSD drive that's internal to your system, or connected over a fast connector. Otherwise part of the delay you will see between videos will be based on the load speed of the videos from whatever drive they are on.\nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: Where are crontab files stored in OS 10.8 I've already looked at this question:\nWhere is my crontab file?\nBut there is no real answer except for 10.7.

Now I can sync my devices to my mac running Ableton Live, but this is where the trouble began.\nIn order to actually hear my devices, I'm running them through an analog line mixer alongside the output of my Mac.  The trouble is that the amount of noise coming out of the headphone jack of the iOS devices is outrageous.  It's not just normal line noise however, I'm hearing all kinds of access and data transfer going on.  It comes & goes in bursts, some lasting only a couple seconds, some lasting much longer.  Also there is a horrible, continuous high frequency whine, and little blips & \"glitchy\" sounds, much like if you've ever had your cell phone pick up noise from a computer, etc.  Bottom line it it's all horrendous to listen to, and definitely not acceptable for any sort of music making.\nBut here's the interesting bit.  If I disconnect the device from the Mac - all is quiet.  Not just quiet, but SILENT, except for the audio I'm actually playing on the device.  It's pure heaven to listen to... absolutely pristine.  But connect the Mac again and... back into the bowels of audio hell.\nThis is true on all 3 of my iOS devices, with completely different cables.  It's also true if I connect to my USB hub.  However, if I provide power to the iOS device via an external source (like a Lenmar portable power pack), then I do NOT get any noise.  It seems like some sort of grounding issue or something that only happens when physically connected to the Mac in some way.\nIs there anything I can do to remedy this?  As it stands now, the analog outputs are simply unusable for music making if I want the devices to be powered at the same time (and with how much power some of these apps draw, power is really a practical requirement).  I've experimented with the MusicIO app, which allows for digital audio over USB.  While it does actually work, I'm having audio glitch issues with it which are unacceptable (and completely different from the noise described prior).  I also have an iConnectAudio4+ which works for digital audio, but only on a single iOS device at a time so really also doesn't get me what I'm after.  Anything I can do to \"isolate from ground\" or whatever else might be causing this horrible noise?\nEDIT:  Some additional interesting info.  The noise is not actually in the analog path of the iOS device audio.  It's being introduced somehow into the path of my entire audio system by the analog out of the iOS devices, but is not in that signal path.  To illustrate this, I can turn OFF the mixer that the iOS devices are going into, so that no signal at all is passing through.  Yet I still hear the noise on the main outs of my system.  If I unplug the analog out of the iOS devices - even though they are not currently able to pass sound anyway - the noise stops completely.\nEDIT 2:  I'm pretty certain now that this is a ground loop issue inside the iOS devices themselves.  I can essentially break the loop by disconnecting either the Mac, or the audio output.  If both are connected - even if the audio output of the iOS device is muted entirely - then I get all sorts of access noise coming out of my main system audio outs.  But since this appears to be inside the iOS devices, I can't really do anything to \"lift\" or otherwise isolate the ground.  I'm really stumped on what I can do about this other than add some sort of pro-level 3rd party docking solution to get balanced audio out (or even digital).  But I really don't want to do this.\n\nA: Well to my shock and amazement, I seem to have solved the problem on my own.  Looks like it was actually related to the specific USB wiring of my setup.\nI have a 10-port USB Hub (un-powered as I lost the AC adapter at some point) with most of the ports filled (a USB mic, a couple pieces of external MIDI gear, iPhone, Mac keyboard, etc.)  In addition to the devices I just mentioned, I also had my audio interface connected to this hub, but had forgotten that it was so.  The iPad mini was connected directly to the mac.\nBy switching things around and connecting the audio interface directly to the mac instead of to the hub, all extraneous noise disappeared completely.  Everything is pristinely quiet now (as best as I can tell at the moment, being that this is an active household and it's not exactly silent very often).  Definitely the constant whirring and chirping and data noises I was hearing before, are gone.  As is the high pitched whine.  Interestingly the iPad works fine connected to either the Mac or the hub, however does not get power if connected to the hub, so I'm leaving it on the mac.\nJust goes to show how critical the way things are plugged in can be.  Just because it's a USB port, does not always mean it's the right one to plug into!  =)\n", "Q: Large zip files created in OS X cannot be opened in Windows When I compress a large directory in OS X, like 5-6 GB the resulting archive cannot be browsed in Windows / Total Commander. It hangs the app and stays at 100% cpu usage, like its trying to extract it or something. Does anybody know whats causing this? Smaller zips that have like 2-3 GB can be browsed instantly.\n\nA: The built-in Archive utility on Mac OS X creates invalid Zip files when they are larger than 4 GB. This is still the case on Sierra (10.12.6).\nIn Windows 10, trying to open such a .zip file in Explorer fails, saying the file is invalid (which is true).\nCurrent versions of Total Commander, 7zip and probably others have workarounds for this particular bug, and should be able to open and uncompress these large files.\nConclusion: do not create large .zip files (over 4GB) with the Mac built-in compressor but use some other tool instead.\nFor the gory details, see Apple Archive Utility (and ditto) and very large ZIP archives (which is, ironically, only available on archive.org since the original web site has shut down)\n", "Q: Stetting up your Mac install phase is taking a long time; save to reboot? A friend of mine just got a new iMac from Best Buy. Installation phase went fine (I'm pretty sure OS came installed). She got to the \"Setting up your Mac\" phase and it's been stuck for about 3 hours right now. Never took this long before in dealing with Macs, ever. \nKnowing potential problems with powering down during an install, I've been avoiding the turning-it-off-and-on-again option. Is it save to power down and reboot? I really don't know what OSX does during this step so I've been avoiding this possibility.\nToday is Dec 26; Apple's servers might be overwhelmed with installs right now but I can't be certain since I've never purchased Macs anywhere except from Apple directly. \n[FYI I have told her to contact Apple care and I suspect they might tell her to do something like that.]\nI don't know the model iMac it is; she hasn't gotten back to me on our iMessage conversation.

Jus remember to download the specific drivers for your model on apples website download page, then pass them to an USB stick and install the software on your windows partition, also of your using an ISO or disk image I would recommend CAREFULLY using the dd command, boot the drive and install to the partition, then boot back to os x, get the drivers and then boot to the windows 10 partition, configure windows and install the drivers. \n\nA: I've done it before with rEFInd (http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/)\nYou should get some guides though, order in OS installation is important to avoid problems and headaches with Bootcamp.\nGood Luck! \nIf you want to avoid the hassle to have 3 partitions in one Laptop's disk, Virtual Machines may be your thing.\n", "Q: Edit the Display Name for a contact in Contacts.app First off: I'm mass printing envelopes. I export my contacts (from Contacts.app) to vCard, then convert them to CSV, before using MS Word's built-in mass-mailing tool.\nIn my contacts, I've found it to be easier to make an individual contact for each person, so I can keep their email addresses and phone numbers sorted nicely.  However, I'd like to have my cards addressed to the family, not just the individual.\nTL;DR:\nI'd like a program that will combine the spouse's name with the main contact's name, and store it either in the existing FN field of the card, or else add a new field (such as famName, etc.).

I have a MacBook Pro 15 Mid 2014 with OS X El Capitan. \nWhen I accidentally disconnect the external USB disk (without clicking eject), I can't reconnect the disk. If I remove and plug the disk back in it doesn't appear in the Disk Utility.\nThe solution is to reboot the system.\nIs there some command to reconnect the disk without rebooting the system?\n\nA: You can, in Terminal, try:\nsudo diskutil list\n\nCheck the output for any drive matching the external drive you have connected. /dev/disk0 is your internal drive. If you have no other drives connected, then your external disk should show up as /dev/disk1.\nIf you can see the drive, run, from Terminal (assuming your drive is /dev/disk1):\ndiskutil mountDisk /dev/disk1\n\nThis should properly mount your external drive.\n\nA: Open the terminal.\nIf the disk is not encrypted\nEnter this into the terminal:\ndiskutil list\nIt will list all the disks that are physically connected to the computer, even if they aren't mounted.\nLook for the name in the list and the corresponding code in the format disk#s#. I'll pick the code disk4s2 out of the air, you use what is in your list. Then mount the disk with:\ndiskutil mount /dev/disk4s2\nIf the disk is encrypted\nI encrypt all my disks. If the disk is encrypted, you must use CoreStorage. It's just as easy, except you have to slog through my long-winded explanation, and you must use the disk's Jumble Number instead of its disk#s# designation. I call it the Jumble Number because it is not labeled and it is a long jumble of numbers. Don't faint. You can just highlight it, copy it with CMD+C and paste it with CMD+V.\nFirst, find the disk:\ndiskutil coreStorage list\nThe word \"coreStorage\" is case sensitive. You must type it in lowercase but capitalize the S, otherwise it will say \"command not found.\"\nLook for the name in the list (for example, \"Fred's Disk\"), but this time use the Jumble Number that is directly beneath it.\nMount the disk as follows, but don't use the Jumble Number in my example, use the one you find in the list:\ndiskutil coreStorage unlockVolume 29B8Ad4C-2608-4822-A272-3DA848CACB83\nSomeone who is handy with AppleScript can probably whip up a substitute for Disk Utility that actually works.\n\nA: For me this worked, both on USB-connected-, and on builtin-cardreader-devices:\nunmount the disk (I did that in DiskUtility, to have more visibility), and then in a terminal:\nsudo mkdir /Volumes/TheName && sudo mount -w -t msdos /dev/disk2s1 /Volumes/TheName\n\n(adapt that to the volume at hand, like -t exfat, etc., you can find such details inside DiskUtility)\n", "Q: Bluetooth connection, JBL Flip3 to Mac Pro I've read all the advise posted to connecting JBL Flip speaker to Mac Pro.\nI'm not sure if this covers the new JBL Flip 3.

Hopefully someone here will know the answer.\nI am running Mac OS X.  I would like to be able to configure pf because it seems to be more sophisticated and flexible than the default Mac OS X firewall that you can access through the System Preferences.  I tried using some pf commands and got some errors that I don't understand.\nbash-3.2$ sudo pfctl -s rules\nNo ALTQ support in kernel\nALTQ related functions disabled\nscrub-anchor \"com.apple/*\" all fragment reassemble\nanchor \"com.apple/*\" all\nbash-3.2$ sudo pfctl -s states\nNo ALTQ support in kernel\nALTQ related functions disabled\n\nI looked up ALTQ on Wikipedia and it seems to be a queueing program that does statistical multiplexing of packets at the kernel level.  It is the kernel module that BSD systems use for queueing of packets.  And the Mac OS X kernel apparently doesn't support it.\nOkay, so this doesn't really make sense.  Why would Mac OS X include the BSD pf firewall but not include support for the queueing software necessary to make that firewall work?  Isn't that kind of counter-productive?  There must be some way to turn support for ALTQ on, but I have no idea what it is.  I'm not even entirely sure what ALTQ is.  Is it a loadable kernel module that I have to load using the kextload command?  Or is the problem that it's already there but the kernel is just incompatible with it.  I am utterly confused.\n\nA: Let's clear up a few misconceptions here, and get your PF working for you.  First, the ALTQ portion of PF handles QoS, or Quality of Service functionality, which might only be relevant to your needs if you were doing some sophisticated network routing through the machine and needed to prioritize the routing of certain types of latency-sensitive, network traffic -- video streams, cell phone calls, etc -- in order to reduce latency and assure such traffic of a greater responsiveness.\nI would not worry about the QoS portion not having been implemented in Apple's port of what appears to be the FreeBSD version of PF.  Apple must have envisioned less of an enterprise-level network routing usage of their operating system and more of a home-user and office-user usage in opting to skip the ALTQ inclusion.\nNext, I find the following command more useful for an overview of what PF is doing:\nsudo pfctl -vvv -s all\n\nOur next step is determining what you would like PF to do.  The meat-and-potatoes configuration for PF is the file /etc/pf.conf.  Is there something specific you would like PF to do, or would you like me to post a few example pf.conf files, in order to give you an idea of how it is used. \nAll in all, you make a wise choice in choosing to use PF.  It is a shame that Apple, for one reason or another ( hint -- think Edward Snowden... ) has opted to deploy its operating system with its firewall onboard, but disabled by default, and without any packet filtering rules enabled by default...  \nDoors wide open, if you ask me...\nHope that this helps.\n\nA: Well, I'm no expert in pf but I just tried the commands pfctl -s state and pfctl -s rules and it's working on my El Capitan installation (I have firewall enabled in System Preferences) while also printing the warning for ALTQ.\nMy guess is Apple ported most but not all functions of pf so you get this warning for ALTQ, which means pf doesn't support traffic shaping in OS X.\nAs a side note, OpenBSD (original developer of pf) actually removed ALTQ support since April 2014.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: What is it that prevents using a 3rd party SSD in a 2015 rMBP? I bought an Early 2015 MacBook Pro Retina model with the 128GB SSD and have been wondering what to do if I need more disk space.. then I found out that it's currently not quite possible to just stick any connector-wise compatible drive in place of current drive as an means of upgrading the storage.\nOWC, Transcend etc sell nothing, Apple does not sell anything (at least not without installation at an ASP), however it seems eBay has some Far-East sellers that have some kind of adapters which allow for 3rd party SSDs to be attached, but they seem to have various limitations as some will not make the new drive bootable, some will boot, but do not support passwords etc leading to believe they just emulate some bit of the original drive but not all.\nMy question is - what is it exactly that causes this incompatibility? Is there some kind of white-list in the EFI firmware that allows only specific SSDs to work? Or is there perhaps some actual additional handshake/encryption/protocol that happens during the EFI boot that helps \"to secure\" the boot-up process to actually justify this incompatibility?\n\nA: The reason for the \"incompatibility\" is simple: there is no SATA-based SSD in this Mac. Apple is transitioning away from SATA-Based SSD drives and moving towards PCIe based SSD drives.\nI thought there were a couple of manufacturers that had upgrade parts for PCIe SSDs and a quick search for \"MacBook Pro PCIe SSD\" should yield some results for you.\n\nA: Apple uses a proprietary PCI-e connection (Apple, remember?). However, since 10.13 and later, some NVMe drives are supported and a little pin adapter will make something like a Sabrent Rocket work just fine.\n", "Q: Does downloading big files reduce my SSD lifetime significantly? I love downloading movies from the internet, and download files with sizes usually around 600 MB - 1 GB. \nI have a MacBook Pro with a Retina display, which comes with an SSD. Will downloading and saving it to directly to my SSD reduce my Mac's SSD lifetime significantly? Should I buy an another external HDD for this hobby?\n\nA: No, not at all. People underestimate the lifetime of SSDs. They can write a lot (usually around 700+ TB before clunking out).\nThis is a good place to find out more about how long SSDs actually last..\nIn fact, if you'd like to see more stats on your SSD, this tells you how to install smartmontools to get an idea of your drive's status.\nAs for your second question, I would say that's entirely up to you. If you'd like to avoid having large files cluttering your limited SSD space then go ahead with the HDD purchase.\n\nA: If you're doing it for the movies only, you will be better of with some NAS or the likes that let's you have an instance of JDownloader (Headless) and some Torrent client in order to download those movies while your macbook is asleep. It has also the advantage of being ampliable if it has let's say 3 bays and you use only one in the beginning. You also have some 8TB HDDisks which purpose is basically for Archiving, they use a new tech that crams more data in the same physical space, so they have a more limited read/write speed and life cycle, but if you only save the movies, and then maybe watch them once, or revisit occassionally, you should be fine with it.\nAnother cool option would be a Seedbox with Plex Server installed, you can even share with your family and have your own Netflix without that much hassle.\nPS: I actually move the data out of the rMBP SSD after downloading, but prefer to download it in the SSD because it let's me juice up my 200mb symmetrical connection with no hassle, doing that with a regular HDD, not so easy.\n", "Q: Might have accidentally change admin user to standard user So I tried deleting an app a few days ago and it requires admin name and password.

It still takes a serious amount of time, until UserEventAgent goes back to normal.\nI also checked the log to find out, if there are any messages, that could give me a hint, but the messages differ every time. There is no message that always causes the UserEventAgent to start up the fans and there is none to stop it.\nThe only thing I noticed is a huge number of errors, logged in the UserEventAgent statistics:\n\n\nIs there any way to find out, what causes the UserEventAgent to go haywire?\nMaybe a terminal command, or something like that?\nAs a note: Testing it will take some time, because I will have to wait for the next spike to test solutions.\n\nUpdate January 2nd, 2015\nI just got a new spike.\n02.01.16 12:18:14,403 UserEventAgent[47]: Failed to send message because the port couldn't be created.\n02.01.16 12:18:14,404 UserEventAgent[347]: com.apple.TMHelperAgent.SetupOffer enabled\n02.01.16 12:18:17,234 UserEventAgent[47]: Failed to send message because the port couldn't be created.\n02.01.16 12:18:17,235 UserEventAgent[347]: com.apple.TMHelperAgent.SetupOffer enabled\n02.01.16 12:19:26,417 UserEventAgent[47]: Captive: [UserAgentDied:143] User Agent @port=101939 Died\n02.01.16 12:19:26,422 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.UserEventAgent-Aqua[347]) Service exited due to signal: Killed: 9\n02.01.16 12:19:26,681 UserEventAgent[16347]: Failed to copy info dictionary for bundle /System/Library/UserEventPlugins/alfUIplugin.plugin\n02.01.16 12:20:27,224 UserEventAgent[45]: Failed to copy info dictionary for bundle /System/Library/UserEventPlugins/alfUIplugin.plugin\n02.01.16 12:20:27,227 UserEventAgent[45]: Captive: CNPluginHandler en0: Inactive\n02.01.16 12:20:27,794 UserEventAgent[45]: Received XPC_ERROR_CONNECTION_INVALID for connection com.apple.backupd.xpc\n02.01.16 12:20:27,799 UserEventAgent[45]: Failed to send message because the port couldn't be created.\n02.01.16 12:20:28,000 UserEventAgent[45]: nsurlsessiond_events plugin: adding token 1 for client softwareupdate_download_service\n02.01.16 12:20:30,795 UserEventAgent[45]: Captive: [CNInfoNetworkActive:1748] en0: SSID 'Boop' making interface primary (protected network)\n02.01.16 12:20:30,795 UserEventAgent[45]: Captive: CNPluginHandler en0: Evaluating\n02.01.16 12:20:30,797 UserEventAgent[45]: Captive: en0: Probing 'Boop'\n02.01.16 12:20:30,897 UserEventAgent[45]: Captive: CNPluginHandler en0: Authenticated\n02.01.16 12:20:30,921 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.UserEventAgent-LoginWindow) This service is defined to be constantly running and is inherently inefficient.\n02.01.16 12:20:31,047 UserEventAgent[217]: Failed to copy info dictionary for bundle /System/Library/UserEventPlugins/alfUIplugin.plugin\n02.01.16 12:20:31,072 UserEventAgent[217]: user agent networkd: built Nov  3 2015 13:38:22\n02.01.16 12:20:34,359 UserEventAgent[45]: assertion failed: 15C50: com.apple.fsevents.matching + 4704 [80662126-A833-3279-8A32-49393FD4E964]: 0x0\n02.01.16 12:20:44,822 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.UserEventAgent-Aqua) This service is defined to be constantly running and is inherently inefficient.\n02.01.16 12:20:45,031 UserEventAgent[269]: Failed to copy info dictionary for bundle /System/Library/UserEventPlugins/alfUIplugin.plugin\n02.01.16 12:20:45,064 UserEventAgent[269]: com.apple.TMHelperAgent.SetupOffer enabled\n02.01.16 12:20:45,167 UserEventAgent[269]: user agent networkd: built Nov  3 2015 13:38:22\n02.01.16 12:20:45,453 UserEventAgent[269]: received an unknown event from daemon\n02.01.16 12:22:12,000 kernel[0]: process UserEventAgent[45] thread 1395 caught burning CPU!

Mac hard drive stopped working while inside, but when you connect via USB it works perfectly fine. Even got new hard drive, but still got an issue with booting from hd inside mac. Machine can see the disk. I’ve installed OS X on new hard drive via USB connection, but when I put hd inside it won’t boot. Crazy world, no idea what's wrong with it. But in terms of data, try connecting it via USB and you may find that your data is safe.\n\nA: To be real frank it seems to me that the problem is more likely to be on the media (SSD) than on the software.\nIf the data is important, I suggest you look into professional data recovery services ASAP as the problem might worsen in case of a hardware failure. (Yes, I witnessed a Mac with SSD going from still-kind-of-bootable to the-disk-completely-not-detected between several consecutive boots when I worked at one of the service centre)\nCore Storage volumes are usually quite durable but almost never recoverable with included tools in case they finally breaks (especially when it's encrypted). I don't think any combination of fsck /\ngpt / diskutil would work… but good luck.\n", "Q: How to know if the new MacBook is charging while turned off? I recently bought the new MacBook 12\" and since it uses a USB-C port and not the traditional MagSafe one, I wanted to know if there is some way for me to know whether it is charging or not while it is switched off. I know that when we connect the charging cable we get a sound and the battery percentage shows up on the screen but I wanted to know if there is a way to know that in-between the charging without booting up.\n\nA: Curiously, Mac portables has been designed to be put to sleep instead of shutdown for very long time (I occasionally reboot, but never shutdown my iBook G4, which is from 2004)\nSo the solution would be using it as how it was designed, put it to sleep, open lid to check.\nYay, that's the USB standard's issue.

The idea from tjt263 is a good one, but since USB type C is fairly new, there isn't an adapter available for USB-C. I suggest to wait 'til new cables with a charging indicator included are released.\n\nA: I have the same issue.

Is there any way to make it possible?\nUPDATE: What I'm asking is 'Is there any way of enabling ISO install like USB one?'; I know that I can install Windows using some VM tricks, but it's not very quick nor is it simple.\nI am using latest OS X 10.11.2, and I want to install Windows 10 on the same drive as OS X, if that helps. \n\nA: Updated Answer\nThe 2012 and newer Macs are installing Windows 10 to boot using EFI/GPT method. The older Macs generally only have firmware that allow Windows to boot using the BIOS/MBR method. If your MBP requires the use of the this legacy method, then even if you can trick the Boot Camp Assistant into an iso only install, your computer may not boot Windows properly. Furthermore, the Boot Camp Support Software will not be written to handle the new EFI/GPT type of booting.\nBTW, install Windows 10 using VirtualBox is not a trick. The process is exactly what the Boot Camp Assistant does for the newer Macs, with some additional steps. The newer Macs use the EFI/GPT boot method and therefore do not need to change the MBR in order to boot Windows 10. For the older Macs, using the BIOS/MBR method, this is a requirement. The purpose of VirtualBox is to copy the installation files from the iso file to the partition from which the Window installer will boot from. This is exactly what the Boot Camp Assistant does for the newer Macs. Once the files are copied to this partition, you can boot the Window installer just as one did using a DVD or USB flash drive.  Once you boot the Windows installer, VirtualBox, as well as, the Boot Camp Assistant no long play any role in installing Windows.\nOriginal Answer\nGenerally installing directly from the iso using the Boot Camp Assistant is reserve for the newer Macs (2012 and newer). Also believe you need Windows 10, but Windows 8/8.1 might work. \nIn any case, your MBP is (13-inch, Early 2011). The accepted method for installing Windows is to use your optical SuperDrive. If your SuperDrive does not work, you can still install Windows, but you really have to want to. The procedure has many steps.\nYou did not specify which version of Windows you want to install. I believe you can install 7, 8 and even 10 if you wish. Without an optical drive, you will need to install a free copy of VirtualBox. If you wish to proceed, update your question to include which version of OS X you are using, what version of Windows (7-8-8.1-10, home or pro, 32 bit or 64 bit) you want to install and if you intent to use the free Microsoft upgrade to Windows 10.\nAlso, did you replace your SuperDrive with another internal SSD or HDD? If so, do you intend to install Windows on such a drive?\n", "Q: Change keyboard layout permanently I want to permanently change my keyboard layout.

Prior to iOS 9.2, large videos would be resized when sending as an e-mail attachment. After 9.2 introduced Mail Drop however, this resizing functionality seems to be disabled even if I opt not to use Mail Drop. \nThe recipients I'm sending the video to have very limited bandwidth (3G cellular) and I do not wish to send them the full sized video - even if they could figure out how to open files from Mail Drop (which they can't)  \nIs there a way to completely disable Mail Drop on iOS like there is in OS X to get this resizing behavior back?\n\nA: You can still compress a video and bypass Mail Drop when you compose a new email and manually attach the video (by long clicking email body).\n", "Q: How to Poll USB mouse through terminal in El Capitan I've been trying to view which devices are connected to my USB ports through terminal in El Capitan, in particular a USB mouse. I've read online that I can ls /dev/tty.* to view all connected devices. But each time I try this before and after connecting a device, the output does not change. \nI've also tried ls /dev and do not see a change in the output.\nI've also tried ls /dev >> before.txt, then, after plugging in a device (like a mouse), ls /dev >> after.txt', then vimdiff before.txt after.txt. And I still do not see any new devices.\nIs this the correct location to be looking in for devices? (namely /dev)\nIf not, where should I be looking?\nNote, there is not a location for /dev/input on my machine. Also, I'm doing this because I would like to practice reading the bits from a serial bus and I need access to the bits incoming from the USB port.\n\nA: For any regular USB device, use:\ndiskutil list\n\nThis brings up the disk utility command line interface's \"list\" tool, which provides you with information on internal and connected disks, be it through USB, SATA or PCIe. It's much simpler than looking through /dev (which includes ttys and a lot of other stuff), and gives you much more information like capacity, partition tabling and the S.M.A.R.T. status (if supported) of your drive.\nIf you'd like to look through /dev though, try\nls /dev | grep disk\n\nThis will show only the entries with \"disk\" in them (disks and connected devices in OS X are mounted as /dev/disk[number]).\n\nA: This answer will attempt to cater to your intentions, if I've misinterpreted, feel free to comment and let me know. \nApple does a fairly good job of allowing developers access to hardware through the OS, the sort of direct reading you appear to want to do bypasses the hardware abstraction layer, and so is discouraged and very rarely found today outside of DOS. \nFurther, while a USB mouse uses a serial communication method (Universal Serial Bus), it is not an RS-232 or COM port which is commonly referred to as a serial port. \nIf you want to learn to take advantage of the mouse when writing programs or scripts on your Mac, take a look at Apple's Developer Guide and try out Python, though at that point we're into software development, so you'll want to check out StackOverflow. \n", "Q: Switching original backup from Timemachine Im using the WD My Passport for Mac, and I recently formatted my entire computer.

The problem I have now is when I press ALT key on startup it shows two bootable disks. Macintosh HD and Windows. Windows was a partitioned disk I had for windows and is empty (maybe). \nAfter using resizeStack it shouldn't be there. When I open Boot Camp Assistant to reinstall Windows, I get the message that there is an \"error partitioning the disk\".\n\n\nA: I recommend the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Recovery HD by pressing cmdR while starting your Mac, open Disk Utility and first check the superior disk, then inferior volume for errors and repair them if necessary.\n\n*Boot to single user mode by pressing cmdS while starting your Mac and enter fsck -fy.

When I mount the card on my Macbook Pro using a USB card reader, Photos.app automatically launches.  But the app doesn't seem to \"see\" that there are pictures inside the folder.  I can access the pictures through the Finder (see screenshot), and of course I can manually import the pictures by dragging them from the Finder window into Photos, but I am wondering if there is some way I can point Photos.app to the directory where the photos are stored so that it can find them and import them on its own.\n\n\nA: I believe this is a bug in the latest Photos app 1.3, which was released on Dec 8 2015.\nIt only imports pictures that has a filename such as DSCxxxx.JPG or IMG_xxxx.PNG.

Open File>Import, choose your device, and when you come upon a grayed out folder, right-click, and choose \"Quick Look\". This will pop up another window which you can close, but once closed, you'll see that the dialog will have traversed into the folder that was grayed out.

(But keep them in iCloud) I have a mixture of local music that I added myself to iTunes, along with albums added through Apple Music. Fortunately, iTunes recognizes this and allows me to “Remove Download” for the songs I added manually to iTunes. So all my songs effectively behave like Apple Music “songs.”\nI'm wondering if there's a way to batch-remove all downloads from iTunes to free of some disk space, since I can stream non-downloaded songs anyway.\n\nA: In iTunes 12.6, under Music, select Songs and sort by iCloud Status. If that column is missing, right-click the column headers and tick iCloud Status.\n\nSelect all songs with a status of Apple Music by clicking the first one, holding ⇧ shift, and selecting the last one. Then right-click and select Remove Download. Repeat for all songs with a status of Matched, Uploaded and Purchased.\n\nIn fact you can simply select the first song with a status of Matched, hold ⇧ shift, then select the last song with a status of Uploaded. This is true in particular if you use iTunes Match rather than MUSIC.\nThe songs you want to leave on disk are marked as Duplicate and Ineligible.\n\nA: The simplest and quickest way is to setup a new iTunes library. This will ONLY work if you have Apple iTunes Music Match purchased. Otherwise do NOT attempt this process.\n\n\n*\n\n*Close iTunes.\n\n*Move your existing iTunes library to another location on your drive (DON'T DELETE!).\n\n*Re-Open iTunes, and you should now get a message like.\n\n\nThe folder “iTunes” cannot be found or created, and is required.

You want to Create Library.\n\n*You will get the New iTunes Library window. Choose where you want it to go and hit Save.\n\n*This should create your new iTunes Library.\n\n*Sign back into iTunes, and as long as you have Music Match you should have access to all your music again. BUT.....\nThe MAJOR DRAWBACK to this method is that you will have removed any videos, books, apps or anything else stored as part of you iTunes library. These should also all resynchronize with your iTunes library, if you want to download them. Otherwise they will be stored on the Apple cloud tell you do re-download them. \nThis does NOT include any videos, audio books, or other files that you might have \"ripped\" that were not acquired from Apple. You will lose these files if you don't move them from your older iTunes Library to the new one.\nIf you are happy with the way this turns out, then you can just start using the new library and get ride of the old one. MAKE SURE you have all the files you want in the new library BEFORE deleting the old one.\nOtherwise you can trash the NEW iTunes library, and move you old one back.\nALTERNATIVELY: You can go into the iTunes library folder, open the iTunes Music folder, and then delete all the music folders, while leaving the Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts, and iTunes U folders. AGAIN, you must have Apple iTunes Music Match purchased for this to work.\n", "Q: Always Open mp3 files with QuickTime Currently the default application for mp3 files on my Macbook Pro (10.6.8) is iTunes.

If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.\nAlternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan) or a thumb drive containing a full system (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan).

I intend to scan the outdoors mainly. So this brings me to requiring a powerful laptop. I really don't want to buy a Windows laptop, I want a Mac laptop. I could use an open source API for Kinect, that works on Mac but it seems to be quite slow and obviously won't be as robust as Microsoft's official SDK.\nAm I correct in thinking that it's possible to install Windows on a Mac, and run Windows natively (without running in a VM) on the hardware (with the help of Boot Camp perhaps)? \nWould the Mac's GPU work correctly while using Windows? Would the Windows drivers work for them?\nThe last concern I have is if the Mac's USB 3.0 chipset will work fine with the Kinect (it uses USB 3.0) when Windows is booted. Does anyone have any insight about this?\nWhen I'm not using the Kinect, I will of course only be booting OSX. I have no intention to use the Mac laptop for Windows other than when I'm using the Kinect.\n\nA: In short, yes, everything would work fine for you.\nYou would get a Windows license, and use Apple's native Boot Camp software to create a Windows partition. This runs completely off the hardware and without the need for a VM.\nPart of the Boot Camp installation process is to install the correct Windows drivers for your Apple hardware, so the Mac's GPU and USB 3.0 ports should work.\nAs far as hardware goes, you would need a pretty good laptop and graphics card. I recommend Apple's MacBook Pro 15in with Retina Display.\n\nA: Yes the Kinect will work if you use your Mac with Bootcamp, though unless you're scanning at night I wouldn't recommend using the Kinect for outdoor work- infrared light (sunlight) can interfere with the scan quality.\n", "Q: How do I instal OS X when boot combos don't work? I'm trying to instal OS X on a 2013 Macbook Air. I erased the OS X partition, the computer is booting to my windows 7 bootcamp partition by default. All boot key combinations(C, Option, CMD+Option+R, etc.) are not working, probably due to water damage. I can no longer get into recovery mode, but the files to boot into it are there.\nIf anyone can help me get into recovery mode I can use a time machine backup to instal OS X from there. Is it possible to change the boot drive from Windows 7? Could I some how delete Windows 7 so that the boot order will move on to recovery mode? Is there a way to install OS X from inside Windows 7?\n\nA: A long shot, but there should be a taskbar item that bootcamp installed on your Windows OS. If it's still there, you might be able to right click on it and get into options to change boot preference. From what I recall that does not show the recovery partition. I don't have a windows partition at this time so I can't help much there.\nanother thought I have is you might be able to install a third party bootloader like rEFIt or rEFind and get in from there with a tweak to the config file to choose the rescue partition on startup. \nDoes your 2013 macbook have a cd drive? If not can it boot from USB or external cd drive?\nIt should be possible to tell the bootloader which MBR to boot into before restarting. I think you can accomplish what you need to from a live cd or similar. Doing it from within windows would be difficult but not impossible. There are tools like Paragon's HFS+ that will let you access mac filesystem (system requirements says it supports Windows 7). But yeah, dealing with HFS+ from windows or linux is a nightmare. I think generally the first step is to disable journaling, but you don't have that luxury now.\nApple stores can now reformat apple computers over the network using proprietary tools not publicly available. If they can do that for your 2013 model, it might save you some grief.

Week numbers and their start date I want to write an AppleScript that creates projects in OmniFocus where their defer date and due date is set to any weeks' start and end day. \nThe result should look like this:\nweeknumber: day1. month1. year1 - day2. month2. year2\n\nWhere weeknumber is replaced with a weeks' week number. day1, month1 and year1 take weeknumbers' week number and parse it to that days' date. So for week number 09 in 2016 that would be 29. 02. 2016. The first week ends (day2 and so forth) end on 06. 02. 2016. So the result for the first week of 2016 would look like this:\n09: 29. 02. 2016 - 06. 02. 2016\n\nFrom the shell it is possible to get the last day of a month like so:\ndate -v 1d -v 3m -v 16y -v -1d +'%V: %d. %m. %Y'\n09: 29. 02. 2016\n\nIn AppleScript you can turn any string, e.g.  returned from a shell script (date) into a date object with the syntax:\nset lastDayShell to do shell script \"date -v 1d -v 3m -v 16y -v -1d +'%V: %d. %m. %Y'\"\nset lastDay to date lastDayShell\n\nThe command to add a new project to OmniFocus is this:\ntell application \"OmniFocus\"\n    tell default document\n        set weekNumbers to folder \"Week Numbers\"\n        tell weekNumbers\n            set project1 to make new project with properties {name:\"09: 29. 02. 2016\", defer date:firstDay, due date:lastDay, singleton action holder:true}\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tel\n\nI know all of that. I just can't find a resource that says how to get the first and last day of any week. I want to set the defer date of any weeks' start to the first of the week, and the due date to the last day. \n\nA: Thanks to @ryan-m's comment I found a solution. Turns out date(1) is actually really cool. Its ability to do \"adjustments\" were the answer. \nYou can tell date to simply \"go to\" a specific day by using -v. You can then use plus and minus to \"adjust\" that date in another -v. So for instance:\ndate -v 1w -v 16y\n\nWill go to the first month of 2016. (Or a date that contains that date)\nWith an adjustment we can walk through dates:\ndate -v +1w -v +0d -v 16y\ndate -v +1w -v +6d -v 16y\n\nThis goes to the first week of 2016. The second command goes from the beginning of that first week 6 days ahead. This is the 10th of January 2016. -v +2w would be the second week, and so forth. It's apparent which part can be automated here.    \nEverything that +'string' at the end does is it formats the date you're at in the way you want it displayed. I use this in my script to make a date-string that AppleScript's date command understands. Please don't confuse the shell command date(1) with the AppleScript date command.\nThis is the script I ended up with, by the way:\nrepeat with weekNumber from 1 to 52\n    set weekStartShell to (do shell script \"date -v +\" & weekNumber & \"w -v +0d -v 16y +'%d. %m. %Y'\")\n    set weekStart to date weekStartShell\n    set weekEndShell to do shell script \"date -v +\" & weekNumber & \"w -v +6d -v 16y +'%d. %m. %Y'\"\n    set weekEnd to date (weekEndShell & \" 23:59:59\")\n    set projectName to ((\"CW\" & weekNumber & \": \" & weekStartShell & \" - \" & weekEndShell) as string)\n\n    tell application \"OmniFocus\"\n        tell folder \"Day Projects\" of default document\n            set projectWeek to make new project with properties {name:projectName, defer date:weekStart, due date:weekEnd, singleton action holder:true}\n\n        end tell\n    end tell\n\nend repeat\n\nNote that in order to use AppleScript's set var to date \"date-string\" you have to give it a string in your locale. In Europe the string is 01. 02. 2016 23:59:59. In America this probably is something like 2016/02/01 23:59:59. You need to modify these in the variables in the script. (+'%Y/%m/%d' at the end)\n\nA: I believe this should get you what you want, assuming to you want the first Saturday of a given month. \nFirst, let's start with getting your last day of the month with the script you used, but output as UNIX time. \nSTART=$(date -v 1d -v 3m -v 16y -v -1d +'%s') # given date in seconds\n\nNow we can find the first Saturday of the month with this date. \n# parse the given date time\n# move to the first of the month (-v1d)\n# move to the 6th day of the week (-v6w)\n\ndate -v1d -v6w -jf '%s' $START '+ %a %d %b % Y'\n\n# Result: Sat 06 Feb 2016\n\n", "Q: Wifi: no hardware installed, then flashing question mark when restarting I bought my laptop ( MacBook Pro mid 2012 or 2011) I have 10.11.2 OS X elcaptain. \nThis entire thing started few days ago. I was watching a movie late at night on my laptop and I think I probably slept and forgot to close my laptop. I woke up closed it. Few hours later, I opened it to access the internet I get the option of wifi: no hardware installed. I've never seen something like this before. So, I restarted. It didn't work. Today, my friend told me to shut it down then press command and r when I open it and restoring my laptop that might make it work. Now, I did this and the computer asks for Internet recovery, but it can't connect in the first place. I shut it down. I opened again and there's a question mark in a folder flashing.

One unlikely scenario (still possible) is your hard drive SATA cable, optical drive etc.. one another part is bad making look like a hard drive issue. \nI would have a tech take a look at your computer before you tinker with it too much, sounds like waiting until you return is your best option. \n", "Q: My external monitor doesn't work at full resolution with my MacBook I've got a MacBook Pro (Early 2015, OS 10.11.2) and I've also got a Dell 2209WAf monitor, which I'm using with a VGA cable and this adaptor.\nThe monitor's optimum resolution is 1680x1050 @ 60Hz and RDM shows this as an option. However, when I try to use that resolution, my screen looks like this  which is clearly not right (it looks impossibly pixellated and really hurts my eyes, you can barely see anything on the screen).\nOn the monitor, it says it's displaying 800x600 when my Mac says it's displaying 1680x1050.\nI've seen questions about VGA cables/adaptors etc. asked before, but they all said it was to do with the resolution being too high. My monitor (and adaptor) can display 1920x1080 so that would appear to not be the case here.\nThe options for the resolution in Displays all work perfectly (various ones from 800x600 up to 1400x1050 when Alt-Scaled) but then it jumps up to 1920x1080. How can I add 1680x1050 to this list, as presumably that would display clearly? SwitchResX doesn't fix this and neither does RDM, I've seen stuff about editing .plist files but that was all for Yosemite, apparently it's different for El Capitan.\nAny help is massively appreciated!\n\nA: I don't have enough points to add comments, but I just had the same issue and found the reply by Dan Grove extremely helpful.\nThis reply is in regard with the step 2 of his proposed solution.\nIt can be skipped by retrieving the monitor's EDID data from SwitchResX. You can download the trial version and, in the monitor tab of SwitchResX preferences you'll see an \"Export EDID\" button on the top right-hand side.\nI thought this might be useful since it doesn't involve any Windows machines.\n\nA: I've spent the last 4 hours (at least) fixing that issue on macOS Sierra. The way I managed to do it is based on Dan Grove's reply to himself in this same thread, but with more DIY (thanks Dan!).\nFew things I think are important to understand about EDID files:\n\n\n*\n\n*For one given screen device, EDID files are different depending on the OS.\n\n*DO NOT retrieve the EDID from the computer where you have the issue (as suggested by chiara in this thread) – it did not work for me and gave me corrupted data.\n\n*You will need need a computer where the screen works (typically running Windows) to retrieve the correct EDID to then port it to Mac.\n\n\nNow, following Dan Grove list of steps (see his post above), I would bring some clarifications as follow:\nStep 1 – I used a real Windows computer to do that, not a Virtual Machine.\nStep 2 – There was no option to export the EDID data as an RTF file in MonitorInfoView when I did it, probably because the software got updated since. I had to click on View > Lower Pane > EDID Hex Dump to actually see the Hex part.\nStep 3 – For those who don't know what Hex is, below is a screenshot. You will have to remove the surrounding parts (highlighted in red) to only keep the Hex part (highlighted in green).\n\nYou can then copy and paste the green part in EDID Reader as Dan explained. You don't necessarily need to have the 3 boxes ticked, just click on Parse Edid and check if the information on the right reflect what your screen device should be – e.g you should be able to see the resolution you're trying to make work.\nStep 4 – This is the tricky part which got me confused. The tutorial is asking for you to output the result of the following Terminal command in a text file ioreg -lw0, and search for various strings within the said file. \nUnless I'm mistaken, ioreg stands for Input/Output Register, meaning it's basically listing all the devices of your machine. However, having 2 screen devices (the native Macbook screen + the external one I was trying to make work), you need to be careful not to be mistaken with your native screen.\nThe tutorial asks you to look for the IODisplayEDID string but my external screen did not have any in the ioreg output (which is certainly why is was not working). The correct IODisplayEDID data to create is the one we found in the Hex part, highlighted in green above. This is the string you need to port into a mac Overrides file (just follow the tutorial if you have no idea what I'm talking about).\nTo avoid mistakes, just be aware that the DisplayVendorID for the Apple native screens seems to be 1552. If during the tutorial you end up using this ID, you're about to change the settings of your native screen, not the external one :)\nI hope this brings some clarification to the very useful steps from Dan Grove.\nCheers\nfred\n\nA: You can go to System Preferences > Displays, then option-click (press option key while left-clicking) on Scaled to expose additional resolutions that aren't exposed with a normal left-click.\nOtherwise, you have a great choice of software for that, like switchResX:\n\nWhy hassling with Apple's inbuilt screen settings, when there is so\n  much more to get and much easier, too? \nWith SwitchResX you get back control on your screen – or screens even!\n  There are plenty of inbuilt options...\n\n\nA: EasyRes from Appstore solved my problem of not having the 4K resolution on my monitor. It's plug and play.\n\n\nA: No program is needed. I was seeking help around forums and I decide to try with cable (without any adaptors) I bought cable for less than 4quid and I got full 2560x1440 it's Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable (thunderbolt to display port on external monitor). If resolution still not showing keep holding Option key and click on Scaled (in Display settings). Good luck!\n\nA: Okay, so I managed to work out what the issue was in the end - it was OS X's handling of the EDID data from the monitor. Windows evidently could read the data just fine, which is why it worked perfectly every time. Where Apple don't develop plug-and-play drivers for monitors (I assume) and hadn't added a profile for mine, it couldn't recognise it.\nIn the end, it was a relatively simple fix. Here are the steps I followed (some very basic knowledge of Terminal is necessary for the second half, it's mostly common sense though).\nThings you'll need:\n\n\n*\n\n*A Mac/computer running OS X that isn't currently recognising your monitor correctly (duh)\n\n*Access to a PC running Windows (with same connections as Mac, DVI and VGA have different EDIDs for instance) or Mac via Boot Camp\n\n*A USB drive in FAT32 (doesn't need to be big)\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Windows from your Mac if you can (or alternatively plug a Windows machine into the monitor that isn't working properly)\n\n*Download and run MonitorInfoView.exe from here (some similar applications don't export the full 128 bit hex code you need for the EDID) and select the monitor you need the EDID for - make sure you don't choose the internal screen if you're on a MacBook! Then export the EDID data as a .rtf file (it's in one of the options in the menu bar) and save it to a drive that can be read by Windows and Mac machines.\n\n*In the .rtf file (at the bottom) there should be a Hex table - this is your monitor's EDID data. Remove the \"0x00\" (etc.) code from the start of each row and copy the resulting text into www.edidreader.com. The Hex key needs to be in the format that edidreader can read, as otherwise the code won't work for the second half of this tutorial (I made that mistake first time) - the tool should display exactly the same data as what you got in the .rtf file when all three checkboxes are ticked.\n\n*If your EDID data isn't corrupted, follow the steps in this excellent tutorial here about how to edit the Overrides in OS X.\nTo do this, you'll need to disable SIP (reboot Mac holding Cmd+R, run \"csrultil disable\" via Utilities > Terminal and then reboot and log back in. Also, the location of the Overrides folder has changed in El Capitan, so it's now in /System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides instead of what's mentioned in the forum guide.\n\n\nIf your EDID data isn't being read at all by anything, you'll need to either use another monitor (that broken one won't ever work properly) or have the defective one replaced etc.\nI hope this can somehow be helpful to someone - I couldn't find a comprehensive guide about how to solve this problem anywhere (and I've been looking solidly for 2 days+)!\nPeace,\nDan\n\nA: I had a similar problem today with an iMac and a SyncMaster225BW display also with 1680x1050 native resolution. Tried SwitchResX which did not seem to work. But the problem seemed to fix itself after a reboot - the secondary display came up in native resolution. (This was after uninstalling SwitchResX.)\nWhat I actually did was reboot into recovery mode and turned off the SIP (planning to modify one of the DisplayVendorID files according to instructions that turned out to be unnecessary).  I doubt turning off SIP had anything to do with it, but it's possible. \n\nA: After updating to macOS Sierra I encountered same issue. As I understand it was because mac recognised it as TV instead of as additional monitor. Next steps helped me to solve the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Save file from embdev.net to Downloads folder.\n\n*Run in terminal cd ~/Downloads and ruby patch-edid.rb It will generate folder with name something like DisplayVendorID-4b1f\n\n*Reboot Mac holding Cmd+R, run csrutil disable via Utilities > Terminal and then reboot and log back in.\n\n*Copy generated folder to /System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides. Needs entering admin password.\n\n*Reboot mac. It should be ok now.\n\n*Repeat step 3 but running csrutil enable instead.\n\n\nA: you can follow Force RGB mode in Mac OS X to fix the picture quality of an external monitor .\n\nA: I found the issue was with the monitor. By changing 1 setting the resolution was fixed. See here:\n\nOn the Mac: System Preferences > Displays > Under the Display tab set the Underscan -> slide to OFF! (This ensures it is in the default position)\nOn your Monitor: Image Control > Custom Scaling > Overscan ---- OFF!\n\n\nA: For people having external display issues on boot camp (Windows 10) I just solved my issue of always defaulting to minimum resolution no matter what setting I picked by doing this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Manually went to AMD and installed the graphics drivers first\n\n*Control Panel->Display->Advanced Display Options->Select external monitor->Display adapter properties->List Modes\n\n*I don't know if it matters but I first selected a lower resolution, in my case 1680x1050 then Ok and Apply and BOOM! It was scaling correctly! Then I went back to List Modes and increased it to its max which was 1920x1080 \nSo its good to go now! Hope that helps somebody before you dive into that EDID stuff...\n\nA: My experience was thankfully a lot simpler than reading / applying EDID settings.\nI'd recently bought an Iiyama ProLite Ultra-wide 3440x1440 resolution monitor, and this default resolution was missing from the list of available sizes.\nI was using a standard USB 3 / HDMI hub to connect the monitor. I then switched to an Apple proprietary USB 3 / HDMI dongle and voila! It suddenly detected the correct resolution.\n\nA: Adding one more answer since none of the above worked for me.  Don't assume your HDMI cable is fine.\nI purchased a two-pack of identical HDMI cables (AmazonBasics brand) that both \"support 4k\" which I connect via a USB-C adapter to the USB ports on a MBP with a 4k display on the other end.\nThe problem turned out to be that one of the HDMI cables in the pack appears to be defective.\nWith Cable A, I get only a max resolution of 1920x1080.  Keeping the adapter constant and only changing the cable to Cable B, I'm able to get access\nmuch higher resolutions such as 3840x2160 (\"More Space\" in the Displays preference pane for this monitor).  I can replicate this switching across the various USB C ports on the MBP and the HDMI ports on the monitor.  I'm not sure why it's happening but it is 100% consistent.\nIt's very weird that with Cable A the monitor does not seem to get identified as high resolution in the Displays preference pane and displays a standard UI vs the retina UI.\nI would be curious to know in the comments if anyone has experienced a similar issue / if there's anything I can do with the cable that doesn't seem to support 4k.\n\nA: My situation was with a cheap 1080p Samsung monitor with a DVI connection. I was using an adapter to plug into the USB-C port of my MacBook Pro that has a DVI plug. The monitor was working fine but it was showing up in 720p resolution, even when I set it to \"Default for display\". I tried multiple things, replugging, changing to Scaled, etc., nothing was working... until I decided to plug my adapter to a different USB-C port. I was plugging it the one nearest to me, I then put it on the one next to it, nearest to the screen. That did it! Now it shows the full 1080p resolution as intended.\n", "Q: Is it possible to set the JAVA_HOME env in El Captitan? I am unable to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable osx.

I prefer CCC, as I don't need snapshots of my system every minute. Utter ridiculousness. I can attest to there being curious permissions issues with sparsebundles, which I adjusted accordingly (read, \"nuked)\", but am not even sure if that fixed anything. I'll say that you must be extremely patient if you're wanting to mount said bundle in order to explore it's contents. You can't have multiple systems contending for access to your TM backups, or else you'll get the dreaded \"resource temporarily unavailable\". Basically, the mouse sucks and I use Cmd+O to mount any disk images, and then I WAIT SEVERAL MINUTES. It was upon this realization, and the fact that multiple machines cannot access the same disk image simultaneously, that I was able to consistently mount and explore the TM backups.\nMounting and exploring these disk images truly is a long process and requires a lot of patience. I also recommend adding all the mounted disk images to Spotlight's list of excluded locations. This just wreaks all kinds of havoc. \nTL;DR - make sure only one machine is attempting to mount the sparsebundle, be PATIENT after attempting to mount (several minutes), wait another several minutes for file indexing. You might even hear your fans spool up as DiskImageMounter goes into overdrive. Add these images to Spotlight's excluded list. \n", "Q: Where are the Flash temp/cache files in safari 9? They move every version Safari 9.0.2 under yosemite and el capitan: looking for where the cached flash video files are stored. It seems they change location every time there is an OS or Safari update. And are they accessible via Web Inspector when I have the page loaded/video running?\n\nA: In the past it used to be possible to find cached Flash video files and retain them.\nHowever that doesn't seem possible in recent versions. There are a few \"Cache\" folders created if you install Flash Player (or use the one bundled with Google Chrome), but when a Flash video is actually playing the data appears to be written temporarily to a location similar to /private/var/folders/t5/zp1103fj4h924mvzysl1m9wh0000gn/T/FlashTmp.T6ja08 but it doesn't stick around long.\n", "Q: Forgot iCloud password I forgot my password for my icloud account.

I am having trouble with a specific financial services provider;  every time I try to visit myvisaaccount.com to check my card balance etc, I get the dreaded Chrome red strikethrough https and x-ed out padlock, with dire warnings about an insecure connection.  If I try Safari or Firefox I get different visuals but the same message:  invalid security certificate.\nHowever, tech support for VISA does not see this problem from their own home or office computers.\nSo I am trying to find out why my OSX Lion laptop hates this web site so much.  I have got into the Keychain Access tool and I have no personal certificates:  empty list.  System (and Root) Certificates are all up to date, with no anomalous descriptive text.  And yes, my system date/time is correct and I am in the right time zone, and I am getting my date/time from Apple N America timeserver.\n[]\nI am thoroughly out of ideas and very frustrated with this problem.  What more can I do to diagnose or fix it?\n\nA: Too much to post in a comment so I posted as an answer.\nThe reason that you are being told the certificate for https://www.myvisaaccount.com/ is not safe is that the root certificate that has been used to sign the www.myvisaaccount.com certificate is not valid on your system.\nIf you open the Keychain Access application and enter \"Entrust\" in the search box you should be present with something like seven certificates. Check the expiry date on the one titled \"Entrust Root Certification Authority - G2\". My guess is that it will have expired.\n\nIf the certificate has expired (or does not exist at all), a potential fix for this is to just download and install a new \"Entrust Root Certification Authority - G2\" certificate. You can find the certificate on Entrust's website here. Just click the \"Download\" button under the G2 part of that page, this will download a \"entrust_g2_ca.er\" file to your Mac. Open that and it should automatically open the KeyChain Access application. By default it will likely offer to install to your \"login\" keychain, change that to add it to your \"System\" keychain.\nIt looks like you'll need to install the L1K certificate as well. Install both and then the certificate for the www.myvisaaccount.com should be validated as trusted.\n", "Q: Is there a way of seeing what `brew cask zap` does before it does it? I'd like to see the results of \nbrew cask zap <something>\n\nso I can decide whether I want it to do that before it does it.  Is there anything equivalent to a --dry-run option, that I'm somehow missing?  Or any other way of achieving the same results?\n\nA: There doesn't appear to be a way of doing a dry run of a brew cask zap command.\nYou could look at the recipe and work out from that what the command will do. According to the man page the command will...\n\nImplicitly performs all actions associated with uninstall, even if the Cask does not appear to be currently installed.\nRemoves all staged versions of the Cask distribution found under /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/\nIf  the  Cask definition contains a zap stanza, performs additional zap actions as defined there, such as removing local preference files. zap actions are variable, depending on the level of detail defined by the Cask author.\nzap may remove resources which are shared between applications.\n\nSo running brew cask cat <something> and examining the uninstall stanza (and the zap stanza if it is present) should give you a general idea of the files that zap will remove.\nLonger term you could request a \"dry run\" feature.\n", "Q: Slow install (hours-days) of El Capitan on 2009 macbook pro SSD Ok, the details:\nMid-2009 Macbook Pro, previously running Lion on native HDD just fine. Installed TRION 100 OCZ SSD, booted with external USB El Capitan installer. Used the installer to format and partition SSD. Fixed the date issue in Terminal before install and connected to the internet. \nSo, every time I get through install (which takes 2-3x longer than the 13 minutes it promises), it reboots, goes to the grey install screen and promises 'Installing: About 19 minutes remaining',yet barely budges. I stopped trying to reboot and install again and let it run this time, and it budged a bit overnight, still less than 20% of the progress bar. At this rate, it will take 3-5 days to install? Can't be normal.\nI know third-party SSDs and older macbook installs can take longer (plus I think it's installing over wifi for some reason?), but this is unworkable. Any suggestions?\n\nA: Solved this a while ago, but will post the answer here: the SSD was incompatible with the hard drive. Since it was an older Mac, the TRION 100 OCZ was not compatible. I took it back to the store and got a Samsung SSD for $20 more, and the install went smoothly.\n", "Q: Does Apple accept .app jars on the Mac App Store? I know that I can bundle a .jar into a .app using Automator and AppleScripts. \nHowever, can this .app be submitted to the App Store?  And if it can be submitted to the App Store, will Apple accept an application of this type?  Are there any examples of apps on the App Store that are .jar converted to a .app?\n\nA: The question was asking about the Mac App Store, not the iOS App Store. Yes, Apple does accept Java applications into the Mac App Store if packaged correctly. Here are a couple links with more info:\nPackaging for Distribution on a Mac\nGetting Your Java 8 App in the Mac App Store\n", "Q: Mac thinks external Dell display is a built-in display So I have a Macbook Pro running OS 10.11 with 1 additional Dell display. For Christmas I received another Dell display, but I'm having issues with this mac thinking the new display is a \"Built-in\" display. When I bring up the Display Preference, it shows my old Dell display as a DELL E2414H, but the new Dell display is showing up as Built-in display. Both displays are exactly the same, with the only difference being how they are connected. The older display is connected via the display port adaptor which is connecting via VGA, while the new display is connected to a USB 2.0 adapter also connected via VGA. Since the new display is being recognized as a built-in display, the resolution is all fuzzy and the task bar is outside of the screen. When I look at the resolution settings and view the scaled options, everything is set to 1920x1080 ( as it should be).\nWhen I open up the About this Mac menu, it shows that I have 2 additional displays, but says the new one is 30.5 inches ( It is actually 24 inches, just like the other display). I'm assuming that since the Macbook thinks the display is much larger than what it is, this is what is causing the bad resolution. Is there any way to fix this? How do I forced the Macbook to recognize the display for what it really is?\n\nA: There may not be drivers for this monitor set up for the MacBook. Check if you can find drivers online for this monitor.\n", "Q: Exchange Time Capsule hard drive with PS4 Hard Drive is it from the data and values possible, to exchange the PS4 and Time Capsule's Hard Drive?\nSo built in the PS4 the Time Capsule hard drive and in the Time Capsule the PS4 Hard Drive.\nCould anyone say me if it so possible and works fine?\n\nA: It may be possible to put the PS4 drive in the Time Capsule but not vice versa, and not really recommended.\nAccording to this support document from Sony, the PS4 uses a 2.5\" hard drive.\nAccording to iFixit guides such as this one for the pizza box model and this one for the newer vertical model the Apple Time Capsule uses 3.5\" drives.\nSo, with an adapter, the Time Capsule drive could work in the PS4, but the PS4 drive won't fit in the Time Capsule.\n", "Q: 94 photos and 463 MB I have an iPhone 4s 16 GB. I realized my photos took up a lot of space so I put most of them on my USB drive. I only kept 94 of them on my phone. But they still take up 463 MB of data. I looked at each photo on my laptop and they all took up between 100 and 600 KB each. There's ONE photo that takes up 3 MB but that's it. The rest are only a few hundred KB. I tried using that Phonecleaner thing and it did nothing. Also restarting my phone. Plus I have nothing saved to icloud or any shared photos or anything synced from my computer (I've never even signed into iCloud. EVER.). Just my normal album. 94 photos. Is there a reason why it's taking up so much storage space with so little photos?\n\nA: Are there any photos in your \"Recently Deleted\" album? These still count towards your photos storage.\nTry signing into iCloud and uploading the photos to iCloud Photo Library (enable at Settings > iCloud > Photos). The size of your iCloud Photo Library (Settings > iCloud > Manage Storage) should represent the size of the photos on your phone.\nSome people have suggested performing a hard shut down (hold Power and Home buttons for 5 seconds until screen goes black) to reset Storage usage info.\n", "Q: How can I hook up a PHP server? I have a php page I want to test on a server. Is there a server that runs through Terminal.app that supports PHP? I read this tutorial, but either I did it wrong or it didn't work. How can I start up a server?\n\nA: The simplest way to set this up is to use MAMP. You can download it for free from here: https://www.mamp.info\nIt sets up a local and isolated PHP/MySQL/Apache server that you can start and stop at any time.\nIt's a web developers friend if you want to keep your Mac system somewhat isolated from the development work.\n", "Q: Messages showing \"Tap to Download\" instead of images Lately when someone sends me a picture via iMessage, I see a box that says \"Tap to Download\" instead of an image. Most of the time when I try tapping the box, it says \"Downloading\" but it is stuck at 0 bytes out of about 2 MB. Other times it will actually download after I tap it and show me the image.\nThis seems to be tied to the user sending me the message. E.g. I can view all photos I get from Alice perfectly (no tap to download required), I can view all photos from Bob (after tapping to download), I cannot view any photos from Charlie (I get a tap to download box, but it's stuck at 0 bytes).\nIf I view the conversation on another device (e.g. a MacBook), I see the image just fine.\nWhy is this happening, and what can I do to resolve this issue on my iPhone?\nI tried restarting my phone, but that doesn't help.\n\nA: On the device with the issue, go to Settings -> Messages -> Send & Receive and then click on your Apple ID to sign out and then sign back in again. This seems to resolve the same issue for other people.\nI think the reason for the issue you are experiencing is a corrupt file, by signing out and back in your device deletes a handful of files associated with your iMessage chats and regenerate them afresh from Apple's servers.\n", "Q: I can't remember my restriction password If I can't remember the restriction password I can't reset all settings and watch videos on safari again.\nPlz tell me how to reset my restriction password WITHOUT a computer or any apps.\nI can't download any apps anymore until I reset all settings and can't do that cause don't remember restriction password. Plz tell me how to reset restriction password without computer or any apps thank u=>\n\nA: I'm afraid you won't be able to reset your Restrictions passcode without any apps or computer.\nYou would have to wipe or reset the phone through iTunes, or remotely erase your phone with Find My iPhone if it is enabled.\n\nA: There was a way I found to get around this once (I forgot mine, too) and it involved extracting a .plist from a backup of your iPhone. In this .plist, there's a value called RestrictionsPasscodeKey and there's also RestrictionsPasscodeSalt (they're both something to do with encryption) and I found a Java app online where you could put these 2 values in and it would work through all the combinations of numbers until the code (combined with the salt) generated the original RestrictionsPasscodeKey.\nMy iPhone was jailbroken at the time so I could access the .plist from iFile, I have no idea how easy it is to extract it from a backup. Also, I was running iOS 8 at the time so I'm not sure whether this would work with iOS 9 (although the website I used worked for iOS 7 and 8). You would need a computer for this, though (unless you're jailbroken, you'll need still need a web browser though).\nGood luck!\n", "Q: com.dashlane.DashlaneAgent still trying to be loaded I have removed Dashlane using the documented procedure, yet launchd is still trying to load com.dashlane.DashlaneAgent.

I've also looked in /private/var/db/launchd.db and not found any entries for this service.\nI did find lines for this service in /var/db/com.apple.xpc.launchd in both loginitems.501.plist and disabled.501.plist. When I remove those lines and reboot, they simply reappear.\nSo this service launch is coming from somewhere; does anyone know where?\n\nA: It turns out that Dashlane was still in my .Trash; deleting it from .Trash solved the problem. I don't understand why; perhaps someone else does; but it seems worth recording here.\n", "Q: Disable iphone zoom Somehow I got into zoom mode on the iphone - I think something like two presses of the Home Button - though not precisely since two presses would show the running apps. I got into zoom while fat fingering the \"show running apps\".\nIt was difficult to get out of zoom as well.\nSo then it would be useful to completely disable whatever button shortcuts get us into that mode.\nThe following link has instructions on how to disable zoom http://www.technipages.com/iphone-enable-disable-zoom.  \nHowever I already do have that turned off: so that is not sufficient. Any other way to completely disable the zoom?\n\nA: It's possible you set up a home button shortcut to toggle Zoom, so turning it off is only going to help until you turn it back on again by accident. :) \nLook here: \nSettings > General > Accessibility > Accessibility Shortcut (very bottom)\nIf you have Zoom checked here, hitting the Home button three times is what is toggling Zoom on and off.

I set it up as a new phone (both have the same name) and upgraded to iOS 9.0.2.\nIs there a way to use the old phone's backup?\n\nA: Now that you've upgraded the phone, you should be able to go in to Settings > General > Erase All Content and Settings.    This will reset the phone like new, except having the latest version installed.    When it restarts, you'll be able to restore from your newer backup.\n", "Q: AppleScript sending Mail messages before file attachments are attached in El Capitan I have a Workflow that runs an AppleScript which attaches spam emails as file attachments and sends them to ASSP for processing.\nIt's been working fine, but apparently something has changed in El Capitan's Mail or one of the subsequent updates which has caused it to stop working.

Any suggestions as to what I need to do to fix this problem?\n\nA: Your daughter's iPad mini isn't broken, but she will lose everything not stored in iCloud (contacts, documents, likely photos will all be alright).\nIn order to get the iPad back to normal you'll need to restore it with iTunes on your Mac or PC (it comes with OS X on a Mac, but will need to be downloaded from http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/ if you don't already have it).\nTo paraphrase this Apple Support link:\n\n\n*\n\n*Plug the iPad into your computer by using the Lightning-to-USB cable\nincluded with it.\n\n*Open iTunes\n\n*Select the iPad in iTunes\n\n*Click \"Restore\" or \"Restore from Backup\" if you have one \n\n*The iPad will need to be set up as if it was just taken out of the box, but it will be running iOS 9.2, the newest update.\n\n", "Q: Just installed new screen on iPhone 5s, getting weird ghosting/burn effect My wife's iPhone 5s screen cracked and for the holidays I had a friend of mine install a new screen on her phone. The only problem is, there's some weird issues going on. First, the outer edges of her screen are lighter than the center, and second, on dark screens you can see burned in images of her keyboard. She already shut it off for a while and did a soft reset and that didn't fix it.\n[Update] Just noticed that the image 'burned in' changes frequently. For instance, if I have Facebook open then go directly to an all black image, I'll see remnants of Facebook. If I have Google open then go directly to a black image, I'll see remnants of Google. There's also a dead pixel on the left side.\nAny recommendations?\n\nA: There's not much you can do aside from having the screen replaced again, maybe checking the connectors on the inside. \nWhat I'd do is just buy a new screen online, but make sure that I get a good one. Usually, the old you-get-what-you-pay-for applies to iPhone parts, so my advice would be to spend a little extra and get a nice digitizer assembly (screen) and be sure to buy it from a US, UK, Canadian, or Australian seller. Usually, I buy them for around $50.\nWhen you get the new screen, have your friend put it on and have him return the faulty one for a refund.\n", "Q: Unable to create outlet using trackpad I am using Xcode 7 on a MacBook Air without mouse.

According to this KB article, it should work out of the box. I also tried disabling SIP as detailed in this article (which deals, though, with another audio interface). I opened an issue at the Alesis support forum but don't have my hopes up for a reply from them, seeing other people complain about USB devices and getting no feedback.\n\n\nI'm assuming that the two issues are related. I haven't tried connecting the real Orion32 device, as it's not in my studio, but the RME device works fine.\nI would appreciate any input on how to investigate further.\n\nA: So, for the sake of documenting this:\nI suspected that the Orion32 driver might be causing the trouble. Looking at system.log, every time I connected the Control Hub, the Orion driver logged some error messages. I deleted the driver and restarted the machine, which seems to have solved the problem.\n", "Q: WAN connectivity failure every 5 minutes on Technicolor router Starting recently, my MacBook Pro running OS X 10.11.2 loses its Internet connection every five minutes or so.\nMy router, a Technicolor TC8717T (don't ask, it's the free one from my ISP) provides two wifi networks:\n\n\n*\n\n*TC8717T88 (2.4 GHz)\n\n*TC8717T88-5G (5 GHz)\n\n\nRegardless of which wifi network I'm connected to, the Internet connection will die after about five minutes. The computer will remain connected to the wifi network, at full signal strength, but I'll be unable to browse to any websites or do anything over the Internet.\nWhen this happens, Network Diagnostics will report that the connection to my ISP is failing, and Wireless Diagnostics will report a \"WAN Connectivity Failure\" and advise that I restart my router.\nAt this point, if I do any of the following...\n\n\n*\n\n*Switch to the other network (from 2.4 GHz to 5 GHz or vice versa)\n\n*Disconnect from and reconnect to the same network\n\n*Turn my wifi off and back on\n\n*Restart my router\n\n\n...the Internet connection will be restored, but only for another five minutes or so, until it fails again in the same fashion.\nWhat could be causing this, and is there anything else I can try?\n\nUpdate: two other pieces of info that I've discovered:\n\n\n*\n\n*When the connection drops, other devices on the same wifi network remain connected.

It was stuck in a loop trying to access a file it couldn't. \nTo see if this might be an issue for you run:\nsudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --verify --standard-pkgs /\n\nAnd see if there are any files wile damaged permissions.\nFor me it was:\nPermissions differ on \"Library/Java\", should be drwxr-xr-x , they are drwxrwxr-x .\nUser differs on \"private/var/db/displaypolicyd\", should be 0, user is 244.\nGroup differs on \"private/var/db/displaypolicyd\", should be 0, group is 244.\n\nSo it is a good chance Java permissions are the culprit. To fix run:\nsudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --repair --standard-pkgs --volume /\n\nAnd then restart Safari. For me this immediately dropped CPU use from 150% to 14%. \nOne should note if you have 100s of faulty permissions, it could be an early sign of disk failure.

Read on for more details.\nWhen you drive a display at that resolution (higher than HD that is) with the graphics card you have in your Macbook, you will be pushing it to it’s maximum. This means if you are looking at a display running 2560x1440 to say play games. You won’t see stealer performance. It will be decent, but you’re not going to be pushing anything over about 30FPS.\nIf on the other had you are looking at doing coding, web surfing, and the occasional graphics work. Then you should be fine. But video playback in full screen will most likely be choppy at best.\nBe aware that the ability to support the resolution you are taking about is not solely the responsibility of the computer. If the display in question uses only a digital video signal (no VGA connector on the monitor) then the monitor must also synchronize with your Mac.  I’ve seen this be a problem with some off brand displays, but an Apple Cinema Display, Dell, HP, or other name brand monitor should work fine in most cases.\nFor optimal performance you will need to use Dual-link DVI out from your computer, and make sure the monitor supports that. Most monitors support DIV, but not all support the Dual-link DVI format. To do this you will need the Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter with cost around $99 as of 2015. By the way, this is REQUIRED if you are using a 30” Apple Cinema Display.\nI hope this helps.\n\nA: How well something performs can be very subjective.  What works well and looks good for one person, may be dismally poor for someone else.\nThat's why you should look at comparative results/reviews.  In this case, from NotebookCheck:\n\nIt does not feature dedicated graphics memory but uses the systems\n  main memory instead (shared memory, in Mac OS X 256 MB from the main\n  memory). Therefore, the performance is not as good as similar cards\n  with dedicated graphics RAM.\n\nAs for your particular Macbook..\n\nmaximum resolution for external display as 2560x1600, so in theory it should work fine,\n\nNot in theory, but in reality, it will work fine.  NotebookCheck published some Apple gaming benchmarks:\n\nThe question is, what do you want to do with it?  The key here is remembering that this is a GPU from 2010 that uses shared memory so performance is limited.\nAre there gotchas?  No.  Your GPU can only perform to it's capabilities which is true for every GPU.\n", "Q: terminal custom commands source every time After following this comment I added all my startup/alias commands to ~/.bashrc file and in ~/.bash_profile I added source ~/.bashrc \nBut still my aliases are not working.

I have installed MAMP on my MacBook, and I use localhost to manage my website repositories. Previously once I installed OS X Server I was not able to manage my websites because there was OS X Server. Is it possible to configure OS X Server under the different name than localhost (example: osxhost)?\n\nA: I think that the issue may be that both MAMP and OS X Apache (VIA the Server.app) are both listening on the default port 80. If you use SCUTIL to set the host name it will change the hostname for all servers on that Mac, I believe.\nWhat I would do is check the settings in MAMP and make sure it is not listening on port 80 and if it is change it to something else. I believe if you restore defaults it will listen on a different port. Then you will have two independent web servers each listening on a different port. The server.app web server will listen on port 80 and MAMP on whatever port it is set to.\nNow you can get to the MAMP site by adding a colon and the port number after localhost. Assuming MAMP is set to port 8080 it would look like this:\nhttp://localhost:8080\nand for the server.app server instance:\nhttp://localhost\nIf you don't specify a port, it defaults to port 80.\n\nA: maybe this command can help you: scutil –setHostName <new hostname>\nsource: krypted\n", "Q: Change permissions of wheel to Read Only How do I do the following using the terminal on mac os x?:\n\nChange permissions of wheel to Read Only in\n  /System/Library/Extensions/Soundflower.kext\n\n\nA: For OS X versions before 10.11\nsudo chmod g-wx /System/Library/Extensions/Soundflower.kext\n\nFor 10.11 you'll need to disable SIP first. \n", "Q: What is the real meaning of the \"WiFi strength\" indictor?

I tried to reset PRAM without success. Consider that if I put the SD card on another Mac it works perfectly. Any suggestions? \n\nA: I would install the older OS to another USB drive so that you can verify that the new OS is really causing the issue and it's not a hardware failure.\nWhen you boot to the old OS (hold option key when booting to choose which OS of the ones connected) run diskutil list to check the filesystem on the SD card.\nIt's unlikely that it's a format that's no longer included in the new OS. It's more likely that you'll find the card itself faulty or the hardware has changed and needs to be cleaned (lint can obscure one pin connector) or repaired. You can also get a USB to SD card reader to avoid needing to reinstall the old OS just to eliminate the SD card reader as a potential source of the problems on the Mac with the new OS.\n\nA: I've just encountered the same issue, and after some research found that the problem is that OS X does not load the SD kext (Kernel Extension - a driver) for whatever reason. Loading it manually resolves the issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*Eject the SD card\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*cd /System/Library/Extensions\n\n*sudo kextload AppleSDXC.kext (enter your password for sudo access)\n\n*Insert SD card\n\n\nAfter this, my SD card appeared in diskutil list and in the GUI Disk Utility and was mounted in Finder. Annoyingly this has to be repeated after rebooting, or you can automate it.\n\nA: Remove the SD card, reboot the machine and don't put in the SD card until it is completely rebooted.

I am hoping that I might be able to recover them using my iCloud backup, but don't know how to do it. Please can anyone help? Thank you. \n\nA: This issue is most likely something to do with Gmail and it's syncing.

Plugged it in to wall all day and then found it to be warm and damp inside the back cover and still with the extremely low battery.  Now getting no response to wake up or reset.  Do you think my battery has gone bad?  \n\nA: It certainly is possible. Since your symptoms do match those of a defective battery, you should probably take it into an Apple Store to get it replaced for free (if it's under warranty), otherwise it'll cost some money, but not as much as a new iPad. It may just be a software bug, but the Apple Store should be able to help you. \nAlso, battery issues can be tested automatically online at:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/support/ipad/repair/\nChoose battery and enter your contact information and you will get emailed/messaged a test diagnostic.

I'm using Apple Numbers v 3.6.1 on OS X 10.11 to automatically fill all the info I need to generate a receipt each month.\n\"... \" & MONTHNAME(MONTH(TODAY())) & \" 1 − \" & MONTHNAME(MONTH(TODAY())) & \" \" & DAY(EOMONTH(TODAY();0))&\", \" & YEAR(NOW())\n\nIt should print:\n... December 1 − December 31, 2015  \n\nBut I can only get the localized name of month (Italian) instead of the English one.\nHow can I ask Numbers to give me the English name of the month?\n\nA: Without changing the localization language in your system, you could do something like this:\n\n*\n\n*Create a table in a separate tab and Lock/hide it later\n\n*Then, in English add the month names in order from January to December in one column.  (A1-A12) [Be sure to set the cells as Text so that they don't show the localized names]\n\n*Change your formula to refer to the correct month name based on the month number.  Lots of nested IF()'s but if the MONTH(TODAY) is placed in a cell in the utility table, that will make the formula a bit more manageable.\nThanks to the OP for suggesting it in the comments!\n\n*place this formula in a cell then reference that cell in your original formula\n\nOf course you can hard code the month names in the formulas, but then you would have to redo it in each instance if you changed languages.  This way you can just change the text in the reference table without breaking your formula.  Also, if you need the month name elsewhere, there is no need to re-enter the formula, just refer to the cell containing it.\n\n\n\nEDIT\nA simpler formula (takes getting used to, though) is to use INDEX(MATCH())\nI actually use this method in a expense sheet I keep for English and French.\n\n*\n\n*First I create a table with the numbers for each month and then text for each month in the target language.\n\n*Get the date\n\n*Use INDEX ( MonthTextLang, MATCH ( MonthNumber, NumberColumn ))\nINDEX ( \"English\", MATCH ( MONTH ( TODAY )), NumberColumn ))\n\n\n\nA: Make sure you are using the correct words in your script.

Every time I erase my MicroSD card, I need to change the format from ExFAT to MS-DOS (FAT). Is there a way to change the default to the latter, or better yet, to default to the current format of the drive I'm erasing?\n\n\nA: There isn't a setting to change, so you might instead script the diskutil command to do the erase using AppleScript or another scripting language.\ndiskutil eraseVolume disk12345\n\nThe eraseVolume command just wipes the volume and recreates an empty filesystem to match what was there. You could build a little window to ask for the volume or perhaps even list all the disks and then tell you to insert the drive to be wiped.\nYou also might use system_profiler SPCardReaderDataType or the similar SPStorageDataType or SPUSBDataType depending on how the cards you wish to erase are connected to the Mac.\n", "Q: How can I output music as mono audio to multiple (5+) channels and programmatically control each channel's volume? I'm trying to output 5 or more channels of mono audio to a receiver, but I want to play the same in the same room at different volume levels. I need to be able to control the volume of each channel independently and programmatically.\nImagine a single computer is hooked up to a 5 or 7 channel receiver in an open floor office and we want everybody to be able to hear the same music (in perfect sync). Since sync is an issue, something like Airplay isn't good and since we want nice speakers and have a single receiver, multi-cast wouldn't be ideal either.\nWhen the phone rings in a certain area of the room, we'll have a script to lower the music volume in that portion of the room. However, we need a way to actually change the volume and drive all the channels. Right now, we just have a single volume level in the whole room but want many speakers all around the room so sound is more balanced.\n\nA: You could try using the Apple Audio MIDI Setup (found in the Utilities folder in most version of the Mac OS) to drive your sound levels differently. This  will ONLY work if the Mac recognizes the output hardware as having discreet channels.  Many audio receivers do not expose the discreet channels to your computer. That’s what the receiver is for.\nIf the receiver does expose the channels in a way the Mac can see then you should be able to set the volumes each independently with the Audio MIDI Setup.\nYou could also try to use Soundflower (16ch) and see if that will drive your receiver and/or speakers.\nHere’s and example image showing Soundflower (16ch) configuration in the Apple Audio MIDI Setup interface.\n\nAlso here’s a thread over on Apple’s support side about using AppleScript with the Audio MIDI Setup app: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2582322?tstart=0\n", "Q: Why is the Force Touch \"taptic\" TrackPad not clicking/selecting on 2015 MacBook Pro? I have a 2015 MacBook Pro running El Capitan with the new taptic force touch trackpad thing. Which, I must add, is fantastic!\nHowever, this morning I started it up to discover it would not click/select anything. What is this madness? How do I fix it? How do I stop it happening again?\nThings that work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Typing with the keyboard.\n\n*Moving the mouse around.\n\n\nThings that don't work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Touch to click (I had enabled that setting)\n\n*Press to click (track pad makes a clicky sound but does nothing)\n\n*Deep press (track pad makes double clicky sound)\n\n*Two finger press (for right click)\n\n\nHave Tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restarting the Finder\n\n*Restarting my Mac\n\n*Making sure it is pugged in at the wall\n\n*Vigorously tapping the trackpad in frustration\n\n*Using expletive language\n\n\nUnfortunately, I had no success with the above.\nPreviously, there were no issues with the trackpad. This mac is relatively new, I cannot think of any installed software that could be causing this issue. Any help much appreciated. Thanks.\n\nA: My trackpad (MBP Early 2015) was working, but there was no haptic feedback, or any indication that force touch was working. Other functions (trackpad, single tap, scrolling, etc.) were working. Here's what my settings looked like:\n\nFor me, it was fixed somehow by an SMC reset with the charger disconnected, while powered on. Basically, I pressed Control + Shift + Option + Power button. The system instantly shut down without warning. Force touch and haptic feedback were back when the system turned on.\nDo I recommend this? No. It's an unclean shutdown. Did it work? Yes it did.\n\nA: Got this this weekend, I was starting to go a little cranky when I saw my 2015 MBP wouldn't click. Tried restarting, to no avail.\nAt one point, I unchecked 'tap to click', big mistake because I couldn't click anymore, so I connected a USB mouse to regain tap-to-click, but still no trackpad clicking.\nI came across this answer from user jbjose80 on Discussions.Apple, recommending instead of rebooting, to shut down and boot back up. Sounded silly, but worked like a charm. Phew!\n(Originally posted on Retina MacBook Pro (non-Force touch) trackpad can't \"click\" as usual, but that was the wrong model)\n\nA: Same problem, but the SMC reset (Control + Option + Shift + power button) fixed it. \n\nA: I tried some of the methods suggested here but none of them worked.\nThen I realized there's a toggle button on the trackpad, I turned it on/off and that worked for me. Note: I have an external trackpad.\n\nA: The issue was solved by connecting an external mouse via blue tooth and just clicking around the screen.\nThis mouse had previously been set up, so it only required turning on the mouse to connect. The MacBook's inbuilt TrackPad then started responding to clicks again and everything works as expected (presses, clicks, and deep clicks, etc).\nThe cause of this problem remains unknown, therefore I have no idea how to prevent it. Note: it has not happened again since.\n\nA: Sadly with 3 years of dealing with this situation with all possible manual methods and recently I have had time to contact Apple Care.\nAnd then they conclude that is the fault of the hardware!\nThe last thing that I can do now is to disable the Force Touch Trackpad apple that was first introduced on the Macbook Pro 2015.\nYou will not see the error can not zoom, back page ... Lost Force touch feature (or force feedback), although it is still better than the previous MacBook Trackpad, but the above shows it is the biggest disappointment for the Macbook Pro 13 user community - the Force Track Trackpad 2015 in general!\n\nA: My haptic feedback stopped working and I did all the recommendations (reset SMC, PRAM, etc.) and nothing worked.  Called apple support and no help either.  They sent me to apple store and after spending 2 hours there running some weird tests I was told \"sorry you should change your trackpad\".\nHow much?  $650. !!!!\nI came home and decided to purchase the trackpad and fix it myself but out of desperation picked up a paper and slide it through the trackpad sides and gently start moving the paper.  Some dust fluff started to come out and suddenly my trackpad started working.\nThat's it,  just a lousy dust\n\nA: I had the exact same issue which happened without any warning or damage to the computer. I tried restarting manually and updating software; it did not work. However, I came across this website and the option of the control + shift + option + power button worked beautifully for me. Weirdly, I had to press the option button on the same side of the control button. If I tried to press it on the opposite side the computer would not shut down or restart. As soon as it rebooted with the hard reset, the trackpad haptic click was working again.\n\nA: I have just had this problem.  I have a bluetooth trackpad that I occasionally use.  It was under a pile of books and so was being pressed. It took me 45 minutes to figure out why my internal trackpad and an external mouse wouldn't click after I logged in (but did work before I logged in).\n\nA: I had the above mentioned issue and tried all the solutions listed, all without result and almost issued a ticket with Apple.\nFinally I decided to drain the battery, I started Netflix and left the laptop running until it died. Left it overnight, plugged power in and my trackpad's haptic is working again !\nI hope somebody may benefit from this option\n\nA: Same issue here but I resolved it with a PRAM reset.\n", "Q: Please help me with iPhone updating problems I've been having My iPhone 4 is at iOS 7.

It locks up while testing Apple Hardware Test 3.3.1 -3A152 comes with my MacBook Pro 17\", 2008 on the included OSX 10.6.3 DVD/CD. When I use it on my not-booting Mac, AHT locks up and never finishes tests and therefore there is no result list.\nWished AHT would list tested hardware and show results as it goes - step-by-step.

I have a Gmail account an iCloud account and a POP account with an Australian ISP. I sometimes have to open the old Mail.app to find an older piece of mail and when I do this tons of duplicate emails start rolling into the program. It’s a waste of time going through and deleting them as I have already dealt with them in Outlook. Should I archive all the old mail in Mail.app and then not use that app again or is there a better approach to this?\n\nA: Why don't you move all your existing e-mails from Mail to Outlook, instead of having to switch between two applications to do it? This article suggests that Outlook might be able to do that directly from your hard drive.\nAs @Pratika Rana pointed out in the comments, you can also turn off autodownload of e-mails by account: in the Mail preferences (Mail -> Preferences... in the menu bar), select the account you want to modify and select the Advanced tab. The Include when automatically checking for new messages should turn off automatic downloading of new e-mails, while leaving your account active and existing e-mails untouched, while still giving you the option to download new e-mails manually if you go back to using Mail in the future.\n", "Q: Iphone 5s Activation no Sim card installed? hi i buy iphone 5s in uk but my mobile not Activate.

I don't understand why this happened because it had the lightning bolt there in the battery, indicating it was charging.\n\nA: It happened to me once. Your charger is an Apple charger? When I was using a fake charger it was a really problem for me, so my way to fix it was rebooting via LOCK + HOME buttons and then check if the iPhone was charging. It could be just a bug.\nIf it's still not charging, change your charger because it can be broke somewhere or getting voltage changes. Apple Support have all the graphics for voltage changes with fake wires or chargers.\n", "Q: Apple Music loved songs I tried to create a smart playlist with \"Loved\" criteria = true, but this smart playlist will only include the loved songs from my library. \n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a way to include also the loved songs from Apple Music that are not in my library?\n\n*Is there any other way to collect all the loved songs from all my devices into one playlist/album/whatever?\nI don't know why Apple makes this so complicated?!\n\nA: There is no way to achieve the Loved smart playlist without adding the song first to your library from my testing.\nI have just given a song Love on Apple Music and it did not appear in my smart playlist until I added it to my library. Even if it was added to a playlist but not actually to My Music it would not appear.\n\nA: *\n\n*No\n\n*No\n\n\nApple Music—for some unexplainable reason—does not enable you to make a playlist of your loved songs. It's a questionable omission, and an easy one to avoid for them, but no, you can not set up a playlist of only loved songs.

The OS is iOS 9.2.\n\nA: The question is, do you trust the person that maintains the wireless network? Do you trust the other people that are using the wireless network? There are all kinds of risks when you connect to someone else's network. For example, man-in-the-middle attacks, DNS hijacking, etc.\nI'm not saying you shouldn't use the shared Wi-Fi in a group home, but just be aware there are risks connecting to any network that you don't control.\nA security researcher, Troy Hunt, recently published a blog article on a related subject. He is explaining why he doesn't allow guests to connect to his home Wi-Fi, but the risks he mentions hopefully explain better some of the things that can go wrong with Wi-Fi networks. No, you can’t join my Wi-Fi network\n\nA: If you are using the shared Wi-Fi at home there isn't any risk (if you trust the persons in your home).\nThe only thing is that when connected, you are sharing the total bandwidth with the other users and therefore the single speed in terms of download and upload will be lower for each user.\n", "Q: Google Drive won't start, odd 'Butt' menu bar icon I just reinstalled OS X (10.11) and am now unable to get Drive working.\nWhen I start the application, a menu icon () appears, which seems to be the word 'Button' clipped short to fit, but I can only see the first three and a half letters, so it may be something else.\nThen.. nothing.

The last one to offer that was the Mac Pro which had no-tool, user swappable hard drive bays.\nYour 2nd option will tie your laptop to the network providing the NAS for full operation. You would want an iSCSI initiator for the fastest storage, but NAS would be just fine for large files and folders you access infrequently.\nI propose a third option: external storage. \nI taped a 1TB SSD to the lid of my MBP. Not that attractive but very effective. Thunderbolt is the fastest DAS (direct attached storage vs network attached storage) but USB 3 is no slouch either. \nBe sure to tape the connector and cables as well to prevent jiggle disconnects.\nI didn't care about the looks. Consider this a proof of concept (tape is enduring nearly one year :-) So there is enough room for improvement. But I'm very happy with this solution. I travel daily with this setup with all my music and stuff. \n\nPictures of opened lid\n\nA: If a 128 GB upgrade would be enough for now, and you don't regularly use your SD card slot, then a 128 GB Micro SDXC card plus a suitable adapter is probably the most cost-effective and convenient option. If you need more than 128 GB, buy 128 GB and wait for bigger cards to get cheaper ;-)\nAnother option would be to use a wireless external hard drive, some of which have rechargeable batteries so you can use them on the move - this is one more gadget to carry around, but doesn't need you to have anything physically plugged in to your MacBook.\nAn alternative approach, if it's music and photos or video that are taking up the space, is to look into how you could use cloud services such as iTunes Match or Apple Music, iCloud Photo Library, Flickr etc. to store your music and photos, and then keep only a subset actually on your device - possibly at lower bit rate or resolution than the originals to reduce the size.\n", "Q: Cannot use existng Time Machine Backup on OS X Server after changing password I'm backing up to a drive attached to an OS X Server via the Time Machine backup service. Recently I changed my password on OS X Server I had been authenticating with for the backup.\nSo, I had to remove the old drive and connect to the server backup location again, authenticating with my new password. However, it doesn't appear the my laptop is recognizing there is an existing backup because it shows \"Latest backup: None\". in Time Machine preferences after selecting the backup disk.\nI don't want to start my backups over. Is there anyway I can continue backing up to my existing server backup?\n\nA: For me, I had to delete the old password from the login / system key chain before it would let me connect again to my server.\nAlso, Time Machine won't show you the old backups until after it makes the first new backup, so you might need to clear the old password and then set up the destination again and then wait for the backup to finish.\nAt that point, the interface should show the old range. If it doesn't inherit the old backups, you have options, but there are some steps needed to get there first possibly.\n", "Q: Boot Camp script broke after El Capitan update I have a script that I call from Terminal to boot into my Windows partition:\n#! /bin/bash\nsudo bless -mount \"/Volumes/BOOTCAMP\" -legacy -setBoot\nsudo reboot\n\nAfter updating to El Capitan (10.11.1) I can’t use it anymore. The error message says something about being unable to set a disk property, so I’m guessing this is related to the security features that were added in this update. \n\nA: You can't set the bootable disk with bless if System Integrity Protection is enabled. This is because bless writes to NVRAM, which is prohibited by SIP. This is why System Preferences → Startup Disk is able to set the startup disk, but other binaries are not.\n\nTo disable System Integrity Protection, you can do the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Boot into the Recovery HD by restarting whilst holding ⌘R.\n  \n*Open Terminal (from the Utilities menu).\n  \n*Run the following command in Terminal:\ncsrutil disable\n\n  \n*Restart.\n  \n\nSource: Disable OS X El Capitan Rootless and permit write actions to System Integrity Protection locations\n", "Q: Synchronise folders on different Macs using rsync I am trying to synchronise two different folders using rsync. I have copied all the data worth 4Tb from a network share to an external hdd using rsync -v -r /source /destination. Now I need to run regular backup to sync both the locations. Can anyone suggest rsync command which I can use to synchronise both the folders.\n\nA: The best way is to continue to use rsync so as to maintain /destination synchronized with /source.\n1st run:\nrsync -avE /source /destination\n\nnext runs:\nrsync -avE /source /destination\n\nThe -a option = --archive == -rlptgoD.\nThe -E option means copy extended attributes and ACL, and is mandatory on HFS+ filesystems.\nWarning: the standard version of rsync on OS X, version 2.6.9 (see rsync --version) still\nhave problems with extended attributes.\nThese problems will be shown thanks to the -v option.\nA verification of the output of rsync is mandatory.\nThis version 2.6.9 is too old and causing too many problems.\n\nI advise any user willing to maintain in sync directories between\ndifferent Macs (or between a Mac and another Unix machine) to install\nrsync version 3.1.2.\nHere is the method I use:\n\n\n*\n\n*install MacPorts: MacPorts home page\n\n\n*\n\n*go to the Quickstart section, install Xcode \n\n*choose the right version to install (Mavericks, Yosemite or El Capitan)\n\n\n*Upgrade your PATH so as to find the port command in it\nfor example, I installed it in /local/bin and modified my PATH\nlike this:\nPATH=/local/bin:${PATH}\nexport PATH\n\n\n*Install rsync 3.1.2:\nport install rsync\n\nWith this version of rsync, the right options to use will be:\nrsync -avAX /source /destination\n\nand if you read me thus far, you are pretty good enough now to read\nman rsync\n\nto get the light from the source.\n\nA: June, 2022 Update\nAs @dan suggested in his answer, using the ancient 2.6.9 version of rsync is an exercise in frustration and confusion. If you use rsync on relatively modern versions of mac os, you will encounter issues with respect to preserving ACLs and Extended Attributes.\nYou can peruse the release history of rsync. You can review the changes for each release (currently ver 3.2.4 released April, 2022). You may also notice that version 2.6.9 (released 6 Nov 2006) was followed by version 3.0.0 on 1 Mar 2008. Ver 3.0.0 contained many significant changes, most notably:\n\n*\n\n*Enhancements for xattr & ACL options in support of OS X users, &\n\n*Adoption of GPLv3.\n\nApple's decision to \"freeze\" rsync at 2.6.9 - just as these OS X enhancements were added seems to speak of their priorities. Apple will not abide GPLv3 even when it has substantial benefit for their customers.\nUse rsync to preserve all macOS metadata\nIn the current version of rsync (ver 3.2.4), the following options have demonstrated their ability to accurately preserve extended attributes and ACLs across the backup-restore cycle:\n% rsync -rlAXtgoD --fake-super /source/ /destination\n\nHere's a summary of some useful options:\n#  -r                   recursive; recurse into directories  \n#  -l                   copy symlinks as symlinks  \n#  --acls, -A           preserve ACLs (implies --perms, -p)  \n#  --xattrs, -X         preserve extended attributes  \n#  -t                   preserve modification times  \n#  -g                   preserve group  \n#  -o                   preserve owner  \n#  -D                   preserve devices and special files  \n#  -v                   increased verbosity; may be repeated  \n#  -i                   itemize changes  \n#  --fake-super         store/recover privileged attrs using xattrs (for ACLs & XATTRs)  \n#  --dry-run            perform a trial run with no changes made\n\nDebugging rsync:\nrsync can create a mess if options are applied will-nilly. It's a very good idea to make a dry run, and review rsync's proposed changes before committing. rsync provides options that support that:\n% rsync -rlAXtgoDivv --dry-run --fake-super /source/ /destination\n\nThe -ivv options are useful for debugging, providing a detailed accounting of the changes. Using ivv with --dry-run will reliably inform you of what's going to happen before it happens.\nAddendum:\nThis GitHub \"recipe\" contains a couple of scripts and a procedure that may be useful for those who wish to  verify that rsync has faithfully replicated all extended attributes and ACLs.\n\nA: Easiest way to update rsync on MacOS Mojave as described at the following link.\nhttps://bayton.org/2018/07/how-to-update-rsync-on-mac-os-high-sierra/\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the terminal and paste the command:\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n\n*Now you are ready to install the new Rsync version, and can do so as follows:\nbrew install rsync\n\n*Once completed, you should sign out and back in to MacOS.\nWhen entering the command below, you will see now that you are using rsync 3.1.3 (at time of writing), instead of rsync 2.6.9. You are no longer running a 12 year old version of Rsync!\n<pre>rsync --version\nrsync  version 3.1.3  protocol version 31</pre>\n\nAs simple as that.\n", "Q: Siri can not activate some alarms on iPhone 6S Plus with iOS 9.2 When I use the \"Hey Siri\" feature to enable an alarm it usually works.

Or other means to accomplish the same?\n\nA: I've written a Safari specific browser extension to do just that called Hush. Since it uses the Content Blocker API it can only block scripts and hide elements, but can't click on accept/reject buttons for sites that force you do so before continuing.

I tried uploading all 11,000 items in my iPhoto to iCloud but I can't because I need more storage there. Which makes more sense, paying for additional iCloud storage for iPhoto or doing something else?\n\nA: I suggest you to pay the small fee to Apple. I don't think you'll need the larger tier. \nYou'll enjoy all the benefits of the integrated library between Apple devices. \nAlso if you rely on free service like google you have to deal with the fact that Google can scan your photos for marketing purpose, giving up your privacy. \nIt's up to you.\n\nA: You can use Google Photos. It has free unlimited storage, and also has an \"uploader\" application that you can leave running in background in your Mac computer.\n\nA: It turned out that when my iPhoto migrated to the new Photos app, OSX created a huge file, 44GB, called MyPhotoLibrarybackup or something like that.

It states that it has a self-assigned IP address and will not connect to the Internet. \nI've been on many forums, and found no solution. Wi-Fi normally worked before the clean install and it still works on my side system, Kali Linux, which I'm writing from right now. \nI've tried to get OS X forget the Wi-Fi and then input the password again, but nothing changed. I've tried to enter a valid IP that I know it's working (I got to it through an app which remembered my computer on the Wi-Fi back when it worked), but still no Internet for me. \nThe Wi-Fi has WEP encryption and I'm not able to access the router to change any settings, because the owner (which is not me) refuses to let me do some adjustments.\n\nA: A self assigned IP address suggests that your system did not receive an IP address from a DHCP or similar protocol.  As Otto Andy Heiskanen mentions, restarting the DHCP server (by rebooting the router) can solve this issue often.  However you mention your Linux environment does get an IP address, which could point at a different cause.  You also mention that you are not allowed to access the router's settings: are you able to physically access it to pull the power plug?\nIf you can't access it physically, I recommend you compare the settings in the Linux environment with the settings in OS X.  Is the Linux environment getting an assigned IP address, or is it a fixed IP address?  Perhaps your linux environment is using a MAC address that is different from your physical MAC address?  Maybe there is some newly configured MAC address filtering enabled on the router?\n\nA: Seems the issue is with the router. I have had this type of case before and rebooting router usually helps. If not, then reseting router is the next option.\n\nA: I have struggled this problem for a few days. It only happens on my home wifi. Finally, I reseted my router and it worked!\n", "Q: OS X El Capitan: man, command not found Today I was trying to update openssl in my MacBook Pro with El Capitan 10.11.2.\nI don't know where I made a mistake but it seems I have accidentally disabled man.

So the source for \"man\" is retrievable from https://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/man/ .  The latest version (as of this writing) is v1.6c. Provided you have at least the Command Line Tools installed (you can run xcode-select --install to get them if you don’t):\ncurl -LORf 'https://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/man/man-16.tar.gz'\ntar -xzvf man-16.tar.gz\ncd man-16/man\n\n# Undo an Apple patch that adds a dependency on 'xcselect.h',\n# which is something that Apple doesn't appear to distribute.\npatch -R -p0 <../patches/PR11291804-xcode.diff\n\n./configure --prefix=/usr/local\nmake\nmake install\n\nThat done, the man binary should be available at /usr/local/bin/man.

Can you see the entries in it in Keychain Access app?\nI'd suggest you create a new Keychain in the Keychain Access app and then try copying the entries over (you can just drag and drop them). You may find most can be recovered and you can replace the corrupted Keychain with your new one.\n\nA: Is this some sort of a permission thingie here after the upgrade? Could you please reboot into recovery mode and try \"Repair permissions\"? \n\nA: Open Keychain First Aid submenu from Keychain Access and try to select Verify option and then hit Start. If any error is detected, try Repair option.\n\nA: For people coming from google, this might be obvious, but make sure the keychain 'System' actually exists:\nOpen up Keychain access, and if 'System' isn't under 'Keychains' on the left, then add it by right clicking on that area and choosing 'New Keychain...'

I'm working on a friend's MacbookPro5,1 15\" from late 2008, which was overheating, so I knew from past experience, the thermal paste needed to be removed, and reappplied.  This was all achieved succcessfully.  The laptop powers on, boots up, and is running well.  \nThe issue is, the cable for the 2 fans (1 for cpu, 1 for gpu) have been re-attached via electrical tape.  I wonder how long this will last, thought.\nI have purchased Artic Silver's Thermal Adhesive, is this the preferred solution, for permanently re-attaching the cable for the fans, to the motherboard?\nAny insights you have are greatly appreciated!\nRyan\n\nA: Both fans use Phillips head screws to attach themselves to the logic board.\n\n\nA: Jesuschrist Ryan, electrical tape? This means you stripped or lost your phillips screws?\nOk, first of all pray to the hardware gods that your thermal paste was applied correctly (you may want to check your temps with iStats or any other App of your choice).\nIf you're determined to leave those fans sealed for better or worse, use epoxy. Trust me, any tape will detach and your fans will become a drone in your Mac.\nBear in mind that thermal paste needs an average of 200 hours use to set. Good luck and may Steve Jobs forgive your unorthodoxy.\n\nA: If you're using tape (that's some hot McGyver action!), I assume you lost or damaged those finicky little Phillips screws. Don't hack it together unless you expect this to be the end of life for this machine.\niFixIt (and probably a few other vendors) have replacement screw sets. I'm not sure if the fan screws specifically are in there, but it's worth a shot. If you (or your friend) intend to perform any future maintenance on this machine, it's good piece of mind to have those in your kit.\n", "Q: How can my iPhone status change to online if it was locked when stolen My iPhone 6s was stolen a few days ago, however because I was running out of data I switched off my mobile data before that happened. \nWhen I got home I tried to track my phone and lock it using Find My Phone, but it said my device was offline, I tried to activate Lost mode but it said it was pending and would be activated when it is connected to the internet.\nMy question is, if my phone was locked as per usual (i.e. requiring my thumbprint or 6 digit passcode) when the phone was stolen, and the thief doesn't know my password, how could they gain access to my Settings and connect to the internet, so the Lost mode can be activated?\n\nA: *\n\n*The iPhone when locked will join known WiFi hotspots that it's set to join when plugged in to power.\n\n*If it's connected to iTunes, it will communicate to the server if someone tries to erase or activate it.\n\n*If a working SIM with cellular data is inserted (or you turn data back on) then the lock/tracking can engage\n\n\nIf none of those three items happen, the lock may sit on Apple's servers until cancelled or they shut down / purge old requests. I would turn on your data if you can to get it back or tracking remotely the quickest.\nThe good news is it's locked to your account, so whoever buys it or tries to sell it won't get any value/satisfaction and your data is as secure as the passcode settings are (4 digits can generally be brute forced, erase after 10 and a longer passphrase/password is generally not crackable).

Isn't there a way to simply use a browser to read my email and see the contacts, like Gmail or Outlook?\n\nA: Yes - https://icloud.com has web apps for mail, contacts, calendar so you don't need an OS X or iOS device to use them. Several modern PC and Linux browsers are supported.\n", "Q: macOS app icon stuck on my screen I just tried to open Spotify's Mac app through the OS X LaunchPad, and when I clicked on the icon, the Mac app icon remains stuck on my screen.\nI've attached some screenshots to show you. I don't know how to get it down. No matter what I do to the screen, the icon is always stuck \"on top\" of it. \nHow do I make this go away? If you're curious, Spotify opened on the second attempt. The first attempt it just got stuck. \n\n\n\n\n\nA: Same thing!!\nVery simple solution: Just search look for the original icon in the launch pad and drag it!\nApparently this is a drag action that never completed.\n\nA: The easiest fix is to just open the app drawer, holding any icon until the move motion occurs, then move any application; it seems to fix it everytime it happens for me.  \n\nA: Turns out, I just had to reset the 'dock' process. I opened Terminal and typed\nkillall Dock\n\nand pressed enter. The screen flashed for a second, and everything came back with my stuck icon gone.\nIf that fails, the issue may be with Finder (this is the case with the similar issue of Stacks categories \"burned in\" to your desktop background). Running\nkillall Finder\n\nwill address that.\n\nA: What I do is pressing CTRL+OPTION+ESC then relaunch Finder app.\n\nWorks for me.\n\nA: I found an amazing solution for this and i am so happy because i suffer from this problem for few years now !!!!\nthe trick is like this: press F4 to show all apps, and drag one of the apps icon over the logo that is stuck on your screen, and voila ! it makes it gone ! hope it helps\n\nA: The same thing happened to me with Firefox recently. The way I got the icon to go away was to delete all desktop spaces except one. Hope it works for you.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with an app that won't to go away and was in the top of every window.\nI installed htop (brew install htop) and searched for a part of the app name (F3), which brings me another app inside the app's folder. \nJust pressed F9 and killed it. (Press q to quit htop)\nThe executable was not listed on Activity monitor, so htop helped me to find and kill it.\n\nA: Working solution for me:\nstart the application that stuck to screen in launchscreen.\n", "Q: How to manage iCloud storage? I don't understand ...\n\nApple emails my iCloud 5GB is nearly full. From the above screen, it's 833.7MB + 450.2MB, why only 118 MB is left? \nHow can I check how/where the space is consumed?\np.s.  Settings > iCloud > Backup is OFF\nHere is the screen from my MacBook:\n\nHere is the Photos app setting:\n\n\nA: @Tetsujin is on the right track - iOS 9 was released with some bed bugs that caused iCloud backups of iPhones and iPads to fail, and often left junk around in iCloud.  \nIn the bottom of your second picture this is confirmed in the graph - you can clearly see backup's (in yellow) are consuming the lions share of your storage.  The easiest thing to do is turn of iCloud backup on all your devices and then delete the backups if they still show up in the settings app before re-enabling iCloud backup.  Some people have had to open tickets with Apple to get them to clean out their backups.  Thankfully for me once I updated to the latest version of iOS 9 all I had to do was turn off iCloud backups and then turn them back on and my devices started backing up to iCloud again and my backup storage consumption on iCloud dropped dramatically. \nGood luck!  \n", "Q: Number 3.6.1: Cell value needs to be invisible, if the adjacent checkbox is checked I'm not sure if this is the right forum, but here goes:\nI would like to keep the cell value (E8), if the adjacent cell (D8) is false (checkbox is not checked), else insert zero or null.\nI just keep getting an error, because of self-reference (E8).\n(\"HVIS\" translates to \"IF\")\n\nI also thought about changing the textcolor using conditional formatting, but it seems that it's not possible to do that using other cells as the conditional factor by itself. It is however possible, if the cell value is compared to another cell, but i wouldn't know how to use that to achieve my goal.\nDoes anyone knows how to achieve this, without using AppleAcript?\nI need the spreadsheet to be compatible with iOS as well, which is why AppleScript is not an option.\nEDIT: I figured out a way around it by using conditional formatting.\nI made the text change to white (same as background), if the value is greater than G8. G8 already has a function that changes the value to 0, if the checkbox is checked.\n\nA: If I understand your question:\nInstead of referencing itself, reference the formula that created the amount.\nSo, E8 appears to be B8-F8, correct?  Then the formula for E8 can be:\n\n=HVIS ( D8;\"\";B8-F8 )\n\nThis will return Null or empty string without the self-reference error.\nScreenshot is using Numbers 3.6.1 US edition but the formulas should work if adjusted for your localized version:\n\n", "Q: I deleted .bash_history, now history isn't saved anymore (although I re-created it) I have freshly installed a new copy of El Capitan.

However, I have deleted all inbox, sent, trash, etc. There is nothing in Mail. \nHow do I get the storage in the usage section to empty this Mail?\n\nA: This issue might be graphical 'bug'. If you are sure that mail is empty, you can always try to reboot/hard reset device and if the issue is still there, then take a iTunes backup and restore device. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204184 should be good article for this troubleshooting step.\n", "Q: Can't see old time machine backups I've installed a new HDD in my iMac, so i reinstalled OS X. I used migration assistant to set back only the settings. I also wanted to set back some other folders, but since my new HDD was smaller than the original one I wanted to dive in this later on.\nNow I have setup time machine for my new installation of OS X (with the same computer name). Frankly I can't access the files/folders of the old backup anymore. In time machine the dates of the backups show up, but I can't move to them. Also migration assistant only shows the new backups and not the old ones anymore. I think the old backups are still there, since the time machine backup file is around 500 GB and the backups from the new installation are around 40 GB.\nIs there a way I can get to the old backups?\n\nA: I've had this happen to me when I've rebuilt our iMac. Basically the Time Machine context has become separated - unfortunately it's not just tied together by name.\nWhat I found immensely useful is this page which will step you through the process of reconnecting the existing context to your new Mac.\n[EDIT] The above link is dead, but it's still available here:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20170704160143/http://pondini.org/TM/B6.html\n\nA: Time machine can be problematic. A couple of things to try: \n\n\n*\n\n*open a folders that you can't access in finder, right click > get info, and check permissions. Does your user have read & write permission?  \n\n*make sure your new HD disk name is the same as the old one.\n\n*try to access through time machine or finder.  \n\n*give it time - there are references in the apple forums of backups not being browsable right away, but eventually becoming available. \n\n", "Q: Can't get past the system lock PIN code I locked my MacBook using Find My iPhone and now when attempting to start using it again, I cannot type my PIN into the unlock section.

Both just came up with a different password screen which I put the PIN into and then they went back to the PIN screen. I have no idea what else I can do.\n\nA: There are multiple options available.  \n\n\n*\n\n*You can purchase a EFI Rom chip for your particular model computer, attach it to the logic board and it will bypass the system EFI.  http://www.cmizapper.com/components/chips.html\n\n*You can attempt to rewrite the existing EFI chip  https://ghostlyhaks.com/blog/blog/hacking/18-apple-efi-bypass\n\n*You can attempt to brute force the password with an Arduino Teensy https://github.com/orvtech/efi-bruteforce or similar. http://www.cmizapper.com/products/brutus.html\n\nA: It sounds like your system has the firmware password set.\nYou will need to enter the firmware password first, before you can get back into your system and enter the recovery pin.\n\nA: Try blocking the MAC address (aka, Airport ID) at your router.  Seems that if the MBP can't reach the internet and Apple's servers, the lockout goes to sh!te.

I have purchased several apps.\nI was wondering, if I add the first email address now (one@whatever.com) as a secondary e-mail address to this two@whatever.com Apple Store account, so I could log into Apple Store with that aswell, would the account show purchases I've initially made on the previous Apple Store account - one@whatever.com?\n\nA: You cannot add any email address that is in use for any other Apple ID. \nYou cannot transfer purchases from one account to another.\nYou could set up Family Sharing - but all that would do would be re-expose the purchase history to both accounts.\n\nA: It would be helpful if you could describe why you have done the above.  Why not keep using the first one if you still want access to what you purchased there?\nBut to answer your question, you will not be able to see anything other than the purchased linked to the account you logged in as.  In order to gain access to previously purchased content, you need to log in with the associated AppleID that was used to purchase them.\n", "Q: What does the app name means above music player in Control Center \nMine is showing \"App Store\", when clicked, it brings me to App Store, but what is the reason of it showing up in Control center?\n\nA: The wording used is to represent the source of the audio content you are listening to, but it tries to be clever and give you more than just the app name.  Instead of Safari, it will scroll the URL of the page you are viewing.  Instead of Music, it will pull the artist/track name etc, and instead of App Store, it will display the name of the last app you were looking at (presumably you were watching a preview video for an app in the store)\n", "Q: Is there a good syslog viewer for mac?

I am not a tech geek and pretty average when it comes to that. Connected it and it appears just fine and any regular files are copied, but when I come to copy my Music folder and my iPhoto library it crashes in the middle and says there is an error. \nHow does this exactly work? I mean, will iTunes/iPhoto understand that it the directory is different now ? \nAnother thing I discovered is, that it takes so much time to copy the files, never calculates less than 5h to transfer 17 GB. \nCan anyone help me? \n\nA: First things first:  As I understand it, you want to put all your iTunes music and your photos onto your new 128Gb JetDrive rather than store them on your computer.  Yes, you can do this, and it should work just fine.\nTo your computer, your JetDrive is simply an additional drive in addition to what is already inside your computer.  I suspect your JetDrive is either defective, or it wasn't formatted properly.\nI suggest you begin by erasing/reformatting your JetDrive using Disk Utility.  (All the data on your JetDrive will be deleted, so plan accordingly.)  If you aren't familiar with Disk Utility, be extremely careful—you can easily do a whole lot of damage to the data on your computer using this utility.  I've never used a JetDrive myself, but it should have come with detailed instructions on how to do this.  If not, or if the instructions aren't clear to you, I recommend you get someone with OS X experience to personally help you do it step-by-step.\nIf after erasing your JetDrive, it still takes hours to transfer your data, you likely have a defective JetDrive.\nAs for how to get iTunes to use your new JetDrive after successfully copying the iTunes Media Folder to it, you set iTunes to use your new JetDrive & iTunes Media Folder Location instead of the one on your computer.  This option is located in Advanced Preferences of iTunes, in iTunes>Preferences...>Advanced.  There you will see the current iTunes Media Folder Location and a button to change it.\nYour photos work in a manner similar to iTunes, but instead of using iTunes Media Folder for its data, Photos uses Photos Library.photoslibrary.  Unfortunately, getting Photos to use a new library isn't as straightforward as is iTunes. After copying Photos Library.photoslibrary to your new JetDrive, you must then either delete or rename the old library.  Doing so will cause Photos to prompt you for the name/location of the library when it starts (since the one it is supposed to use cannot be found because you deleted or renamed it.)\nLastly, after you have successfully put your music and photos on your new JetDrive, be sure Time Machine is set to back it up from there.  You do back up your data, right?\n", "Q: View Shared Office 365 Calendar on iOS I'm trying to help someone who uses Office 365 at work with a Mac. Right now, she has to use the official Outlook app on all of her devices (MacBook, iOS, Apple Watch, etc.), but she'd like to be able to use the native Apple apps instead. This seems to work fine for everything except for shared calendars.\nOn the Mac Calendar app, you can set up delegate calendars easily, but I don't see a way to do that on iOS. Is there a way to view a shared (non-public) calendar on iOS?\n\nA: No - the native OS X and iOS apps do not understand delegate calendars. Microsoft implemented them as a non-standard calendar extending the basic CalDAV format, so you would need to wait for Apple to code to Microsoft's standard or use another app to view those. (I can't recommend any apps, but you might start with Microsoft's ones if you are OK using native calendars for all but the delegate ones).\n", "Q: Using an Italian Windows keyboard in remote management of iMac I'm using TeamViewer on a Windows computer to control an iMac. The keyboard on my side is this, but I set it so that it works like this one (when I push \\ I obtain `, when I push Shift\\ I get ~, and so on).\nAt the beginning I thought it was unavoidable, so I started to get used to these changes (hard to do, since I write in LaTeX and the backslash is the most important non alphabetical character). Accidentally I changed the settings such that the keyboard is mapped in the right way, but I don't know how. So far, it's fine; then I unfortunately (and accidentally) turned things back, so I think it's the moment to understand how to manage this settings.\nIn System Preferences > Keyboard I see there's only the Italian keyboard. Furthermore, even if I add and select other keyboards, I always get ~ when I press Shift-\\ (the original behavior).\nCould the problem concern being connected remotely?\n\nA: It was not a problem concerning TeamViewer, nor the preferences/settings of the Mac. Evidently I accidentally pressed Alt-Shift, thus changing the keyboard input method in Windows from Ita to Eng. I realized this by simply visualizing the keyboard on screen and watching it change depending on which window was active.\n", "Q: Greyed out AirPlay symbol in Safari We recently upgraded from Snow Leopard to El Capitan to use the Safari AirPlay feature for embedded HTML5 Videos.\nOn videos (e.g. YouTube) we see that AirPlay symbol but it is grey and clicking on it shows something like \"looking for devices\".\nThe strange thing is that in iTunes everything works fine. We can select our AirPlay speaker and successfully play music from iTunes.\nSo why can't I stream music from HTML5 videos to my audio system, when iTunes works perfectly?\nNetwork:\nComputer is connected via WLAN to an AirPortExpress. The audio system is plugged into the AirPort via this round headphones cable.\n\nA: You can only stream AirPlay video to a device capable of displaying a video signal.\nYou can stream audio to a speaker and video to an Apple TV but you can't just pull the audio from the video.\n", "Q: How do I zoom without a trackpad in Xcode Instruments Time Profiler? When using Xcode Instruments Time Profiler on my MacBook, I'm able to pinch to zoom in on the CPU measurements in the Swim-lane. However I cannot figure out how to do the equivalent on my iMac with no trackpad.\n\nHow can I zoom in on a Swim-lane without a trackpad?\n\nA: If your mouse has a wheel or touch - hold the option key and then use the scroll wheel / scroll gesture or control. \nIf you don't have that - you'll need to add a mouse with a wheel or add a trackpad to the iMac.\n", "Q: Can you take a iPhone 5c sim card and put it in another iPhone 5c? Can an iPhone 5c SIM card be moved to another iPhone 5c?\n\nA: Providing the iPhone 5c that you are moving the SIM card to is not locked to a different network, this is possible.\n", "Q: Why are .deb files used in iOS? If you jailbreak in iOS, you can install packages using .deb files. Being a Linux user I know Debian-based distros use that file type for apt. I know that iOS is not Debian-based or Linux-based, but it is UNIX-based. Why does iOS use .deb files when you jailbreak?\n\nA: Jay Freeman (\"saurik\") is the developer of Cydia and brought Debian APT to iOS.\n\nThe iPhone … is running a pared down Mac OS X with its standard complement of a FreeBSD-based userland over a Darwin kernel.\n\n\nFor distribution, I have chosen Debian's APT\n\nSource: http://www.saurik.com/id/1\nThese elements together delineate .deb files as the container for the package to be installed.\n\nIn the world of Debian APT/dpkg, anything you can install is a \"package\". These packages exist in the form of .deb files\n\nSource: http://www.saurik.com/id/7\ndpkg-deb allows these deb files to be installed and managed easily and with little overhead, which is very important for iOS devices.\n", "Q: How do I remove unused partition (El Capitan)? I have a partition that I no longer use. I've tried erasing with the disk utility GUI, but when I try to remove (with the '-' minus button on the partition view) this feature is disabled.

Macintosh H is the unused partition that I'd like to remove and add the space to BOOTCAMP \n\nA: You can't move the start block of a CoreStorage Volume Group (\"BOOTCAMP\" in your case) non-destructively (OK, there is a workaround: please check the Scattered Physical Volumes method at the end of my answer). The same is valid for non-CoreStorage partitions with on-board tools. AFAIK only iPartition and gparted work for the latter. Therefore you can't easily reclaim empty space with a lower start block and an arbitrary size and add it contiguously to existing CoreStorage or non-CoreStorage volumes.\nYou may either remove the partition Macintosh H or repartition the internal drive. I recommend the latter because removing one partition will not increase the size of the second partition!\nPreparation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Attach a backup drive and use Time Machine to backup BOOTCAMP.\n\n*Detach the backup drive\n\n*Restart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing alt cmd R at startup. Booting to Recovery Mode is not conducive because the Recovery HD will be removed in one of the steps below. And you can't remove a partition used as a boot volume.  \nThe prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.\nOn a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an Apple/Akamai server.\nI recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.\nAlternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan) or a thumb drive containing a full system (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan).

I need space on the phone so I tried deleting them. I can select them just fine but the trashcan icon is dull. Normally it is lit up and I can delete photos or videos, but now i can't. I've tried going on iTunes, clicking the phone, selecting the photo icon, unchecking the sync box, and it says that they are deleted but they are still on the phone taking up 6.7 GB of data. I still can't delete them. I can select but I can't delete, even on the PC. What do i do?\n\nA: I'm not a PC guy but usually your photos live in iTunes Media Library.\nWhatever method you can use to find it, you delete your photos from there.\nUsually just use your search function on your PC to find the iTunes folder, open it until you find the iTunes Media Folder and delete whatever files you don't need to have synced.\nAfter you delete your photos (Or just move them to another location if you're afraid you may loose them), you must sync your phone to iTunes again and this will refresh your iPhone's list of songs and photos, revealing more space.\nAfter this is done, find the option on iTunes to not sync your iPhone when connected and either manage your files manually or resync when your storage problem is fixed (a new phone with larger storage, for example).\nYour original photos are still in your PC, unless you deleted the originals.\n", "Q: Is it possible to sync the Do Not Disturb mode between Mac and iPhone?

How, from a Terminal, do I make a plain text file and a folder?\n\nA: A directory can be made using the mkdir command. To make a child directory of the current directory it's simply:\nmkdir somechild\n\nThis will create a directory (shown as a folder in Finder) named somechild.\nA text file can be created in a few different ways. The simplest being the echo'ing of text and redirecting it in to a file like so:\necho This is some text > myfile.txt\n\nThis will create myfile.txt and its contents will be the string This is some text.\nYou can also use a command line text editor such as vim or emacs or nano to start a new text file. The following start a new text file and open them in the editor for each of the aforementioned editors:\nvim myfile.txt\nemacs myfiles.txt\nnano myfile.txt\n\nThe nano text editor is probably the most new-user-friendly of those three choices.\n\nA: To create an empty text file, just use:\ntouch file_name.txt\n\nFrom man touch: The touch utility sets the modification and access times of a file. If the file does not exist, it is created with default permissions.\n", "Q: No display on external monitor I have a macbook pro retina 13 inch and I am trying to use a Dell monitor as an external display. I have an HDMI cable from the laptop to an HDMI to VGA convertor to the monitor. After some playing around, I finally got the macbook to recognize the external monitor. But, the external monitor still shows nothing. The mac screen changed to a weird square shape that I guess is supposed to be the Dell screen? I'm guessing there is some kind of display setting I need to toggle, but I can't find it. Also, the mouse can go way off the screen on the right side, but nothing appears on the monitor still. It is in \"Power save mode\". Any help is much appreciated!\n\nA: If your HDMI to VGA converter is not powered, that's your first problem - HDMI is digital only and VGA is analog - a pure cable solution won't work - you need actual electronics to convert the digital HDMI signal to VGA and that requires power.  If your converter is not plugged into a USB port it could be \"converter\".  \nIf that's not it (and it sounds like your Mac does think it is connected to a second monitor so your converter may be just fine) you could just be suffering from the extremely dumbed down Display System Preferences in the recent versions of OSX.  The monitor is in power save mode because your Mac is sending it a resolution/refresh combo that the monitor can't deal with.  Unfortunately converters like HDMI to VGA often wipe out the EDID information which can cause wacky results like your seeing (often an out of bound signal and the monitor sleeping instead of showing you what you want to see).\nThere are many utilities that will give you more direct control over your displays and resolutions, but my favorite is this free little gem - Display Menu:  http://displaymenu.milchimgemuesefach.de \nYou may have to fool around with resolutions and refresh rates to find the best one - or just look in the manual for the Dell monitor and find it's native resolution and max refresh rate and set it to it.  That should do it!\n\nA: Go to System Preferences -> Displays -> Arrangement\nYou should be able to see your macbook screen and your dell monitor there and arrange how everything is displayed. If you want two monitor make sure to uncheck \"mirror\" \n", "Q: Will changing your Apple ID password affect a pending remote erase request? I had my iPhone stolen a few days ago so naturally I tried to do a remote erase.  However, the device has been offline since it got stolen so the erase is still being requested.  I'm thinking of changing the password for my Apple ID but I'm worried that if I change my password, the stolen iPhone will become disassociated with my Apple ID (since the password doesn't match now).  Will this happen?  Or will the iPhone still receive the erase request once it comes online despite the password stored on the phone being an old password?\nThanks\n\nA: Changing your AppleID password is an excellent idea, but you want to place your iPhone into LOST MODE rather than to erase it:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201472\nHere is an excellent article on choosing a password, from Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science:  https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~help/security/choosing_passwords.html\nI have read quite a few articles concerning stolen iPhones.  Many experienced thieves start by putting the iPhone into Recovery Mode, which erases all the data, and makes it virtually impossible to locate by you or the authorities.  Once in Recovery Mode, the only way to reload iOS (and reactivate the phone) is with the correct AppleID and password of the registered owner (you).\nOdds are you'll never see your iPhone again, and some schmuck will buy it, only to discover it's unusable.\n", "Q: Bootcamp interrupted; now stuck on Windows boot looking for startup I have a MBP with Yosemite (10.10.5 I think). I was trying to install Windows 7 from a USB and cancelled it when it got stuck looking for a driver - I don't have any disk drive and that seemed to confuse it; there didn't seem to be an option to go back or cancel so I think I just powered down by holding down the power button.\nNow when I try to startup it seems to be stuck in Windows mode looking for a bootable device.\nIs there a key combination that will make it reset back to starting in Mac OS?\n\nA: To bring up the Startup Manager, press and hold the option key immediately after you turn on your Mac and hear the startup sound.\nFor additional information see: Startup key combinations for Mac and How to choose a startup disk on your Mac.\n", "Q: 9.2 iPhone family sharing I added my account to my uncles so now we're doing family sharing, I recently got an Apple iTunes card for 15$ and can't use it because when I try to purchase something it goes to his credit card info to verify the purchase through him but I have credit so what's going.

I use an Airport Time Capsule and have a wireless router. Which one should I use for Wi-fi and how do I know which one I am using now? Thank you.\nMacBook Pro 11,3 with Retina display; OS X Mavericks (10.9.5); Airport Time Capsule 802.11ac; Actiontec GT784WNV Router\n\nA: I presume you have Verizon (FiOS) for your service provider, as they use Actiontec routers.  Another router (such as an Airport Time Capsule) can be connected to your Actiontec router, but you cannot substitute another router in place of your Actiontec router.\nI recommend turning off WiFi on your Actiontec router, as it has known security issues which enable it to be easily hacked into.  For example, WEP cannot be disabled.  Your ATC can be used as a WiFi \"access point\" instead, providing superior security and speed.\nTo know whether you are connected to your ATC, you could try unplugging it to see if you still have access through your Actiontec.\nTo configure your Actiontec and ATC together, as I've described, is too complex to explain here, as you seem to be a novice user based upon your past questions.  You can be forgiven for not knowing the differences between modems, routers, gateways, LANs, WANs, etc.  Such things are complicated, and weren't designed to be user-friendly.\n", "Q: How to open path in Double Commander from Terminal If I type open $(pwd) or open /anypath/ I will get the path opened in Finder. How I can achieve similar results but with the path opening in Double Commander instead?\n\nA: By default Double Commander is programmed to open with two Tabs each set to the current location of the Double Commander.app application bundle.  If one then changes to a different location other then the default on one of the Tabs and then closes Double Commander and reopens it, it opens to the last location before being closed.\nHere's a way to open Double Commander to a specific path from the command line similar to opening Finder to a specific path using Terminal.  This covers the default of two Tabs.\nUse the following syntax in a Terminal:\nopen -a Double\\ Commander --args -path location ...\n\nExample:\nopen -a Double\\ Commander --args -path ~/Documents\n\nThis will open Double Commander to your Documents folder in the left Tab and the right Tab will open to the last location opened.\nIf you want to set the location of the both Tabs use: \nopen -a Double\\ Commander --args -path location location\n\nExample:\nopen -a Double\\ Commander --args -path / ~/Documents \n\nThis will open Double Commander to the root of the boot volume, typically Macintosh HD, in the left Tab and your Documents folder in the right Tab.\nIf there is a way to set just the right Tab while letting the left Tab default to the last saved location I do not know the syntax for it, if it's even doable.  I did try several attempts using different delimiters but none gave the wanted results in testing.\n\nUpdate to address the comment by s.newave:\nI'd add a function to your .bash_profile file as in the following example code:\nfunction odc () {\n        pkill doublecmd; open -a Double\\ Commander --args --no-splash -path \"$1\" \"$2\"\n }\n\nThen from the command line in Terminal you can simply use odc or e.g.: odc / ~Documents\nNote that if the Double Commander > Configuration > Behaviors > [] Allow only one copy of DC at a time, check box is not checked, you can use the following variant to open a new occurrence of Double Commander to the desired paths leaving other occurrences of Double Commander running.\nfunction ondc () {\n        open -n -a Double\\ Commander --args --no-splash -path \"$1\" \"$2\"\n }\n\nThen from the command line in Terminal you can simply use ondc or e.g.: ondc / ~Documents\nNote that in either case you can also pass a single argument as well, e.g. odc ~Documents or: ondc ~Documents\nThe function names odc and ondc stand for open double commander and open new double commander, respectively.\n", "Q: Will iOS backup include a paired Bluetooth keyboard? I have an iPad with a broken digitizer. This, of course, renders the iPad useless. Although I would still be able to use it for typing, etc, if only my Bluetooth keyboard was paired to it. But how to achieve that when the touch screen can't recieve input?\nSo I got an idea.\nCan I pair the keyboard with another iOS device, backup that iOS device to my Mac, and then restore that backup to the iPad? Will that include the paired keyboard? \nI am (barely) able to unlock the screen of the iPad, so I will be able to sync and restore it from the Mac.\n\nA: Bluetooth pairing matches two hardware devices, so that pairing records are irrelevant if re-loaded on a different bluetooth adapter (on the new iOS device). Good thinking to get around a hardware repair - if you could somehow turn on assistive touch and try backing that up, you might be able to navigate - but I'm guessing that still needs some amount of digitizer functionality to restore the backup in the first place.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202658\n\nA: I wouldn't expect network settings to be saved and transferred through backup, especially to two different machines, but I could be wrong.\n", "Q: Bluetooth audio choppy/skips on El Capitan I'm using the music receiver bluetooth TP-Link HA100 and when doing streaming from Spotify or iTunes the audio has clicks in and out and skips like a scratched CD.

The folder /Users usually contains all user folders of the (non-system) accounts configured in OS X and a Shared folder. The name of a user folder usually is identical with the short name of the user account.\nTo see/access /Users either open your boot volume or bring Finder to the foreground and in the menubar navigate to Go To -> Go To Folder..., enter / and hit the OK button (then you will see the folder Users) or enter /Users and hit the OK button (then you will see the content of the folder Users).\nIn /Users/username/sites/website1 username is just a place holder for your (OS X) short name. So in /Users open the folder with your OS X short name (your user or home folder is also indicated by its icon: a little house) and you are in your user folder.\nTo immediately jump into your user folder use the shortcut shiftcmdH in the Finder.\n\nA: There are several ways to navigate to folders in the Finder.\nMethod 1: Navigate to the folder\nOpen a new Finder window and use Cmd+Up arrow key to move up until you get to a common parent folder of the folder you want to find (so you will get all the way up to the computer).

When I made the Macintosh partition smaller, Disk Utility made a new unnamed partition of that 10 GB. This means there were a total of 5 partitions. In Terminal the BOOTCAMP partition was situated on number 5 and the unnamed new empty partition on number 4. I think the problem is that the system only can boot the first 4 partitions. I've deleted the new empty partition again and set the Macintosh HD at its original size, so BOOTCAMP is now again on #4;\nMBP-van-Daniel:~ daniel$ sudo diskutil list\nPassword:\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            418.4 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n   4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                81.0 GB    disk0s4\n/dev/disk1 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1\n   1:               Windows_NTFS My Passport             1.0 TB     disk1s1\n/dev/disk2 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        +10.5 MB    disk2\n   1:        Apple_partition_map                         32.3 KB    disk2s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Remote Desktop Conne... 10.3 MB    disk2s2\n\nIn my first post I had deleted the 10 GB empty partition already.

I have an external Firewire volume with some filesystem problems. One problem is that Disk Warrior can't fix these errors because there is not enough space left on this volume (in fact, it is completely full - 0 bytes empty, which I suspect is the reason for the FS-problems). Another problem is that this disk gets mounted readonly by the OS, hence I can't delete any files on it to make it possible for Disk Warrior (or fsck) to fix the file system. I have tried the commands in this question but they only generate an error message:\n% mount -u -w /Volumes/MyVol \nmount_hfs: error on mount(): error = -1.\nmount_hfs: Invalid argument\n\nI also tried mount_hfs with different options, but something like this\n% mount_hfs -o update /dev/disk3s3 /Volumes/MyVol\nmount_hfs: error on mount(): error = -1.\nmount_hfs: Invalid argument\n\nHow do I force mount this volume in readwrite mode so I can try to delete some of the files on it?\nAnd you don't have to tell me to backup and erase the volume.\nUpdate: I just found the hfs.util command and run it like this\n/System/Library/Filesystems/hfs.fs/Contents/Resources/hfs.util -M disk3s3 /Volumes/test writable\n\nbut it just responds with is \"usage\" page. On this usage page there is an example that looks like this:\n/System/Library/Filesystems/hfs.fs/Contents/Resources/hfs.util -p disk0s2 fixed writable\n\nCan't see any difference between that and my command..?\n\nA: I have to do the following from the command line to get a USB drive to mount read/write:\ndiskutil list\nsudo diskutil unmount /dev/disk2s1 <- (put your volume/partition in here)\ncd /Volumes\nsudo mkdir <FOLDER_NAME>\nsudo mount -w -t msdos /dev/disk2s1 /Volumes/<FOLDER_NAME>\n\nThis is with a FAT32 formatted USB stick. Not sure why, but my Mac will only mount these read only when they automount, only started happening recently. Reformatting does not resolve it, even formatting in a macOS native filesystem gives me the same issue. This is happening on multiple USB sticks after many reformats and reboots.\nThe problem is that I have to do that each time I remove the drive and want to plug it back in.\n\nA: I managed to delete some files to free up space on the device by connecting it to my NAS, where it was mounted as writable. Doesn't really answer my question, however it solved my problem. Now I am gonna try to fix the file system.\n", "Q: Personal hotspot problem: \"Set Up Personal Hotspot\" I am trying to enable my the hotspot from my iPhone 6. I am in the beta program (if that matters). \nI am on Verizon. \nWhenever I press, \"Set Up Personal Hotspot\" it brings up this message, \n\"To enable Personal Hotspot on this account, visit https://mobile.vzw.com/hybridClient/mvm/hotspot\"\nMy brother is on the same plan, and his works great. Same iPhone. Meaning our Verizon account is set up for hotspots. (Also, I checked on our account settings, and it is enabled.)\nI already rebooted the phone, and reset network settings.\nAny ideas why it won't turn on a hotspot? \n\nA: Apparently back when I had a flip phone I had asked that data usage be turned off. (So that I wouldn’t accidentally get charged when I pressed the “internet” button.) \nOne of those switches they turned off was the use of hotspot. \nI called Verizon and they simply enabled the use of hotspots again. \n\nA: All iOS devices will turn on tethering when they get the go-ahead from the carrier. There isn't any other switch than the one you see. \nYou could try backing up the phone, erasing all content and settings and making sure it's not the OS, but it's almost certainly something you need someone to verify your carrier settings. Calling Verizon support would be my first step. \n", "Q: Safari switching websites back and forth Sometimes, mostly in summer, Safari will start to suspiciously jump from one website to another. For example, on Google, when I click on a link of Wikipedia, it jumps to a weird \"tune up my Mac\" site. Then after about a minute, it switched back. Is it a virus or a settings problem?\n\nA: Sounds like you installed some software that came with a PUP that acts like adware. There are many of these that try to install unwanted programs during an install. They know that people just click OK while installing so they bundle them into the installer for another program. \nRead here and check out what programs you have installed over the past few weeks or months. Uninstall third party add-ones until it goes away. \n\nA: It's either a pop-up, which you get from an installed app, or adware, which you get from an installed app or a from your browser add-ons, or both.\nI recommend you get an adware remover just for starters. I hate browser hijackers.\n", "Q: How to share photos with iOS users if you don't own any Apple products I have a bunch of family members with iPads. I'd like to share picture streams with them.

After I deleted an application from my iPhone, is there a way to find how many times that application was deleted and reinstalled on my account?\n\nA: Shot answer is no.

That would be a very hard process, nearly impossible.\n\nA: In your iTunes account you can see Purchase History, including free apps. It won't show when it was deleted, and may not show re-installed apps.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204088\n\n", "Q: Disable Microsoft Office for one user I share a Macbook Pro with another user (we are both Admins).

I thought it is recognizing only my voice, but today I found out that is not true!\nIs there something I can do against this?\n\nA: As 9to5Mac says in the article iOS 9 includes ‘Hey Siri’ voice training to help Siri better recognize your voice…\n\nThis makes the addition of voice training particularly relevant. In previous OS versions, Hey Siri would just work if you toggled a switch in Settings. With the GM, the OS now prompts you to go through a few training exercises before the feature will be enabled. Some readers have claimed that this feature is like Voice ID, so that Hey Siri function will only respond when the true owner of the phone speaks to it. Whilst this would be a nice feature, we cannot reproduce this and believe it is only meant to improve general detection accuracy.\nIt is true that the iOS screens describing the feature are ambiguous. It says “this helps Siri recognise your voice” which could be interpreted as meaning your voice only. However, the statement is vague enough such that it could also mean overall improvements to Siri voice detection on the device, not specifically the current user.\n\nSo it's not necessary trained to recognize your voice, rather, it improves voice detection. There's no real fix for this as far I can tell, voice technology just hasn't come that far yet.\n", "Q: Pasting images into Pages document very cumbersome - Inline vs automatic Pasting images into a Pages document is very cumbersome, requiring each individual image to be re-set and location to be adjusted manually to 'Move with Text' and 'Inline with Text':\n\nCan image-pasting be made to default to that setting ?\nThanks muchly for anyone knowing of a (likely?) simple-yet-hidden solution.\n\nA: First make sure that the image you want to replace is defined as a media place holder.  To do this click on the image that you want to replace so that it is active.  Now go to format at the top of your screen and choose \"Advanced\" from the \"Format\" drop down.  You should see the following bold text with a check mark in front of it \"Define As Media Placeholder\".  If it is not bold with a check mark in front of it click on it so that it is.\nOnce the image has been defined as a media placeholder right click on it and choose \"Replace Image\".  You will be given a choice of file paths to choose your new image which should then replace the original image and keep its formatting.  This only hitch is that you might be limited to choosing only those images which have been saved to your photo stream. \n\nA: I find that if I position the cursor within the text, and paste an image, then the Object Placement is anchored within the text stream, and defined as Move With Text. This is in Pages 10.0, which is current at time of writing.\nThe same is true if I drop an image directly into a paragraph of text, or use the menu item Insert > Choose... at the cursor position. So that's half the requirement.\nThere doesn't seem to be a way to set the default Text Wrap style, nor to select all images at once (short of Command-clicking them all) and then setting the wrap style.\nHowever: one method that does seem to work:\n\n*\n\n*Paste all the images into a blank, 'spare' Pages document. All the images need to fit on one page, so make the page size very big.\n\n*If the document contains nothing else, you can Select All the images, and then define their characteristics in one go.\n\n*You can then copy and paste each one into your target document, and their Text wrap style will be preserved.\n\nFrom posts on other forums, e.g.: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7223123 , it does seem that this function does not 'formally' exist in Pages. The AppleScript Dictionary contains only one reference to text wrap, but in the context of tables, not images.\nUltimately, if this is a major impediment, you may be more productive in another application.\n", "Q: Time Machine Backup Failing with Error 11 I've been trying to run a Time Machine backup for the last couple of days (OSX 10.7.5 and Porsche LaCie 2TB); however, it has been constantly failing.

What was different about this was that the previous failures would tell me that it was backing up 40 GB, but then it would 40 GB and continue getting larger, unto about 130 GB, and then crash. This backup started by saying that it was backing up the entirety of my drive (roughly 400 GB). Much to my dismay, it got to about 40 GB, and then crashed with the error messages that I referenced. What can I do to correct these errors, and successfully backup my system? \n\nA: It took a while, but I found that I had some corrupted file that kept crashing the backup.

Truly vexing....\n\nA: You will need to go to Music, then select the drop down that says, \"Songs\" or \"Albums\" or whatever your current library view is. In the bottom of the drop down menu, switch off the option that says \"Only downloaded music\", then you can download the music that you're missing from there.

Similarly, SWITCH1 and SWITCH2 knows on which of their ports the computer with the MAC-address of wwwelc is connected. This means that it can send IP packets directly to the MAC address of wwwelc.\nWhen you power off the Mac Mini and some time passes, the MAC address will eventually be flushed from the caches on your switches and/or the ARP cache on the MBP.\nImagine that it is no longer in the cache on the switch. This means that the switch has no choice than to broadcast packets for that MAC-address to all its ports. This means the SWITCH1 will send the packet to both the Time Capsule as well as SWITCH2.\nThe Time Capsule receives the packet and acts as a router. It will try to route the packet to its destination. It finds that the packet is actually destined for something on the ethernet connection on which it came into the Time Capsule - i.e. it is not to be routed out with the WiFi or Internet connection ports.\nFor that situation, we have something called ICMP redirects. It is common to many routers from various producers - so it's not Time Capsule specific. \nThe Time Capsule sends out the ICMP redirect to be \"nice\". It is letting the sender know that it received a packet where the sender could actually have sent it directly to the next hop of the route without involving the Time Capsule. So it is letting it know that it could have saved a hop.\nI.e. the following conditions are met:\n\n\n*\n\n*The packet came in on the same port that it is going to be routed out of\n\n*The network (subnet) of the source IP is the same network as the next hop (i.e. the sender could just have sent it directly to that next-hop)\n\n*The packet is not source routed (i.e. the sender did not instruct a specific path to be taken)\nSo that's the explanation for what you're seeing. The Time Capsule receives the packet because the SWITCH or MBP doesn't know where to send the packet - so it broadcasts it. The Time Capsule is trying to be nice, saying that the packet could have been delivered in an easier way. And finally, the destination wwwelc is still down, so you're not going to get any replies from the destination of course.\n", "Q: El Capitan and memory Since installing El Capitan on my mid-2013 27\" iMac with 16 GB of memory I often get a \"not enough memory\" message particularly when using Word, but also some crashes when trying to print from Word or Adobe.  I was not having any of these issues before installing El Capitan.\nAny suggestions.\nThank you\n\nA: memory could mean two things. RAM memory will clear up after you restart. And physical memory is used to store things. \nYour Mac sounds young, so it might be a RAM memory problem. Try restart a few times.\nIf that doesn't work, type sudo purge into your terminal. That will manually free your RAM memory.\nLastly, there is a option to clear up NVRAM memory. If you clear NVRAM up, it will clear up your settings for system volume and mirroring and stuff. The way to do that is restart, after you hear the boot-up sound, hold down following keys: Cmd + option + p + r\nTo clear out physical memory, in the other hand, is simpler. Move things to usb and delete unwanted apps and plugins.\n", "Q: How do I transfer photo/video from Ipad2 to Windows XP computer? What driver when asks for new hardware found?

Wifi is a shared resource.  Cabled connections are not (and always better if you have a choice).\nAre you in a house or apartment?  How many of your neighbors are using wifi?  Are you using channel 1, 6 or 11 on 2GHz?  More importantly are your neighbors also using the same channel?  Do NOT use anything other than 1, 6 or 11 on 2GHz bands - all the other channels will overlap with 1 and 6 or 6 and 11.  5GHz channels do not overlap in the same way so it's less of a deal with 5GHz.  \nA quick way to see who is around you and what channels they are using is to use an app like http://www.netspotapp.com to do a quick survey and see what is going on around you.  \nThe more use of wifi around you, the more the ping times are going to vary.  If you don't have neighbors close by, how many other devices do you have on wifi?

My laptop wasn't fully charged yet and my battery actually started to drain even on a green light. At first I thought my charger was defective so I borrowed a charger but it still showed a green light. Using my charger on another MBP showed expected behaviors (orange for charging).\nI then turned my laptop off and tried to reset the SMC by holding down the left side shift control option and the power key, but to no avail. I have done SMC resets before, and I know that the LED Indicator light of the charger should change had I done it successfully. I am pretty sure I shut down my laptop properly.\nHas anyone encountered this situation before? Any help is very much appreciated. I would post more technical information about my laptop, however, I don't think turning it on is a smart idea as I don't think the battery is functional at all. \n\nA: Unless you have had the battery replaced in the last few years it’s most likely dead. You can use a couple of different apps(Battery Health, Coconut Battery), or even the built in System Info screen to see the charge cycles and condition of the MacBook's battery.\n\nI helped a friend with almost the same identical problem on a system of the same vintage, and it was the battery that was dead. No matter how many times he reset the SMC, it never helped.\nAs a side note, Apple recommends that you cycle the battery fully at lest once a month to avoid potential problems that can occur form charging the battery to soon in a battery discharge cycle.  So if you are always plugging into power when you have only 30% of your battery drained, you could be shortening the life of the battery.\n\nA: Press Option and click your battery, if your battery status is normal then your charger IC need replacement. I did mine few days ago\n\nA: This is an olde post I know but I have just had the a similar problem, and via trawl around the web came here and tried the suggestions above. Sadly they didn't work. However I also came across what did work for me.\nSimply unplug the power adapter from the mains for a few seconds; then plug and switch on. èt voila the charging process now starts OK - the green led on the mag connector switched to orange to show charging; which it wouldn't before.\nI had also tried the SMC as well; removing the battery first as that routine varies according to whether or not to the battery is removable. But it was unplugging the power adapter from them mains which resolved it all.\n", "Q: Can't login with Google using Internet Accounts I configured my Google account on El Capitan (OS X 10.11.2) using Internet Accounts and it worked fine for a while.

A second hit will close Launchpad again.\nYou can use either the left or the right command key as usual otherwise (e.g. open files with cmd+O or print cmd+P)\n\n\n*\n\n*Download, install and open Karabiner\n\n*Open in the menulet Karabiner -> Preferences\n\n*Open the tab Misc & Uninstall\n\n*Hit the button Open private.xml\n\n*Open the file private.xml with an appropriate editor\n\n*Enter the customized keycode\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<root>\n    <item>\n        <name>When you type Command_L only, start Launchpad</name>\n        <appendix>(Change Command_L lazy start Launchpad)</appendix>\n        <identifier>remap.command_l_lazy_to_launchpad</identifier>\n        <autogen>__KeyOverlaidModifier__ KeyCode::COMMAND_L, KeyCode::VK_LAZY_COMMAND_L, KeyCode::LAUNCHPAD, ModifierFlag::FN</autogen>\n    </item>\n</root>\n\n\n*Save the file\n\n*Open in the menulet Karabiner -> Preferences the tab Change Key\n\n*Hit the ReloadXML button\n\n*Enable the remapping.

After about 10 minutes of the fan blowing hot air out of the side of my Macbook Pro, I stop the update for fear of my expensive notebook burning up. How could a simple software update cause such a reaction? This doesn't happen all the time, just if I haven't updated Macports in a while.\n\nA: That behaviour is expected, as each updated port needs to be compiled for your system. Some ports are simpler and don't take much effort. Others are more complex and will cause your MacBook to heat up as it works (example: ffmpeg). \nGiven you say you haven't updated your ports in a while, likely there are quite a few ports that need updating. You can take a look at those with:\n\nport outdated\n\nFrom there, you can choose which ones you want to update, if you don't want to update all of them:\n\nsudo port upgrade PORTNAME\n\nAdditionally, you can see what MacPorts is doing by looking at the output in your Terminal. Typical steps where your MacBook may heat up are:\n\n--->  Configuring PORTNAME\n  --->  Building PORTNAME\n\nDo not be concerned about the temperatures. If they really become too hot, your MacBook will shutdown by itself to prevent serious damage.\n", "Q: Remote Access from Windows to Mac I am interested in using Xcode, but don't currently own a Mac and my dad owns many, but lives far away. What is the best way of remotely accessing his newest Mac running OSX 10.11 so that I can use it at the same time as him, and without an unreasonable amount of lag?\nI realise that this question has been asked before, but I can't find any answers from the last three or four years, so was interested if anything has changed. The best advice I can find so far seems to be using a program called Real VNC to connect via SSH, is this still true?\n\nA: Any type of VNC would be able to achieve this.  \nHowever, a far simpler solution would be to use TeamViewer which would be much easier to set up & avoid the need to provide a way to punch through the firewall from the outside, as it connects from 'inside' the firewall & is then 'invited in' by the remote party.  \nTeamViewer is free for non-commercial use.\n", "Q: Need to backup, but can't press 'Trust Computer' button because of cracked screen I recently bought an iPhone 6s and wanted to bring my data from my old iPhone 4 to it but I have the following problem.\nMy iPhone 4 has a cracked screen and the sensor is a little messed up. If I try hard enough I can do almost anything (more than 10 times! and by rotating the screen if it can be rotated such as when I use the keyboard.)\nI didn't have an iCloud account and used to backup with iTunes but after the screen was cracked I tried a couple of things and long story short I have no backups.\nI tried creating an iCloud account and my contacts got transferred to my new iPhone but I can't find a way to transfer my notes as well.\nThe reason I can't backup the phone is because of a little screen that comes up when connected to iTunes that asks you to 'trust' the computer. Somehow it's the only thing/position in the screen the sensor isn't working. Same thing happens on iCloud, there is another screen asking you if you're sure you want to stop using iTunes and use iCloud and I can't get through it either.\nI tried for hours.\nI really want to transfer my notes on my new phone because it's 5 years worth of them and I want to keep them with dates etc etc...\nAny suggestions would be welcome!\n\nA: The way I finally solved the problem was to use the iPhone's AssistiveTouch. It can be enabled at the control center and when using the two finger gesture I was able to \"click\" on the \"Trust This Computer\" button that was otherwise unreachable since that part of the screen was unresponsive. I hope this helps others struggling with the same problem!\n", "Q: How to 'upgrade' to Windows 10, on Virtual Machine I have Windows 7 on a virtual machine on my 2015 MBP. I want to try it on boot camp and upgrade to Windows 10, but Bootcamp won't allow anything below Windows 8. So it's not possible to 'upgrade'? Do I need to buy a new licence for Windows 10? \n\nA: Look, boot camp did allow Windows 7. It is just that it only allows 64bit. \nHere is how to upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10: Use Windows 10 on your Mac with Boot Camp.\nAlso, Virtual machine is like a computer!! Just follow the following guidelines: Upgrade to Windows 10.\n", "Q: EFI and SMC firmware updates - how to determine if the downloadable version is more recent? I have a 15-inch MacBook Pro late 2011. System Information gives me the following firmware versions:\nEFI Boot Rom Version: MBP81.0047.B2C\nSMC Version (system):   1.69f3\nApple provides the following web site for downloading firmware upgrades: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201518\nOn this website the following downloads are available for my system:\nEFI Boot ROM version: MBP81.0047.2AB (2015-001) \nSMC version: 1.69f3 (SMC 1.5)\nThe SMC version is the same as the one installed on my system, so no need to update anything.\nHowever, there is a discrepancy with regard to the EFI Boot ROM versions (installed MBP81.0047.B2C vs. MBP81.0047.2AB). How can I tell whether the ...2AB version is a newer version than the ...B2C version on my system? Will the upgrade programme check during the upgrade process?  I \n\nA: The updater program will check to see if you already have the latest version of the Firmware.  Taken directly from the Apple web page that you linked to:\n\nIf you try to use a manual updater that's not designed for your Mac,\n  or if it's not needed, the installer alerts you and the software isn't\n  installed\n\n", "Q: How can I make a Macbook Pro to recognise a connected mouse as a mouse? Apologies for the vague title. Please tell me if I've done something wrong with this post so I can rectify it.\nI have a Logitech MX Anywhere 2 mouse that works fine with my computer, apart from one thing. Even with the \"Ignore built-in trackpad when mouse or wireless mouse is present\" checkbox checked in Accessibility, my trackpad still accepts input even while my mouse is connected. I am able to move the cursor with the trackpad and the mouse at the same time, which I assume means that the computer is somehow not accepting the wireless mouse as a mouse. It is connected by Bluetooth and the options in System Preferences for mice still affect it. By the way, my trackpad turns off when I have any other mice connected.\nDoes anyone know how to get the computer to recognise the mouse for this option, or to otherwise spoof a connected mouse so that the trackpad will be deactivated? \n\nA: Have you tried resetting the NVRAM?\nSource:  How can I disable the trackpad when my mouse is plugged in on Lion? \nHow to rest NVRAM:  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063\n", "Q: Auto Delete Hidden File when USB Connected? I have a MacAir running El Capitan with all updates. I use a USB stick to move movies from Mac to Samsung Smart TV. The TV writes a hidden file \" .device_info_*** \" (long abstract filename). This file keeps details of movie folders in it... but does not update. So when I delete a movie... the folder stays hidden on the stick in this file and shows again when connected to the TV. I have created a work around by showing hidden files and deleting this file... the old folder info disappears when viewing on the TV and the TV writes a new file when USB is reinserted. But the whole process starts all over again. \nI want to have an auto script that deletes the .device_info_*** file every time the USB is connected to my MacAir - without any user interface or questions about \"are you sure, etc\" . The asterisks in my example are wildcards because the filenames created are different every time (after the .device_info_ part of the name). \nWhat script would do this? And can wild cards be used as part of the filename in the script? \nI am not a script writer but am pretty savvy.\n\nA: Here's a Keyboard Maestro script that deletes a file when a partition is mounted:\n              \nIf you want wildcards, it might be more useful to use a script action with rm:\nrm /Volumes/volumename/.file*\n\n", "Q: Why can't I find OS X Yosemite in the Mac App store? I need to install OS X Yosemite onto my laptop, but can't find it in App Store.\n\nA: Unfortunately the OS X Yosemite installer is no longer available on the Mac App Store.\nIf you have a paid Apple Developer account you can download it from https://developer.apple.com/downloads/\n\nA: user163914 is correct. I would have commented on that reply but lack of rep.. sigh.  I see Yosemite 10.10.3 build 14D131 (release date April 8, 2015)  available at https://developer.apple.com/downloads/  There are two files (the actual Yosemite update and a combo update file. Both are over a gigabyte in size, be warned)   but you only need one of them.  Note that it is the only Yosemite install version that comes up in the search.  Hope it helps though. \nApple dev accounts are free by the way, all you need to do is sign in with your Apple ID and accept the dev agreement. \n\nA: I tried myself, and I conclude that you cannot find it in the search.

When I add a source without a date to my Microsoft Word document in Microsoft Word 2015 (15.17.1) on OS X 10.11.2 and insert a citation, the inserted field states (Author, kein Datum) in German (kein Datum translates to no date). But I'm writing this document in English language and want the inserted field to actually state no date in English.\nIn the bottom line, Word states that the document language is English (UK) and my system language (System Preferences > Language & Region) is also English.\nHow can I change the language of the inserted field containing the citation?\n\nA: There is a rather inconvenient solution to this problem, but this seems to be the only currently available solution due to the lack of Mac OSX support of Microsoft Word features.\nAfter inserting the reference in German (or whatever) language, you can right-click it and choose Toggle Field Codes.... Then you will see the code of the inserted field. For German citations this is something like {CITATION ABC15 \\l 1031} where ABC15 is the unique name of the source and \\l 1031 refers to the language of the inserted field. 1031 is in fact German (Germany) according to Locale identification numbers for language-specific files.\nKnowing the unique source name, you can insert a field on your own from Insert > Field... > Citation and in the box below enter CITATION ABC15 \\l 1033 where 1033 now stands for English (US). Then the citation will be inserted in English (US) language. More information on the citation field can be found here.\nLooking at Microsoft Word 2015 for Windows, there you have the ability to change the language of every single source in the Edit Source dialog and also to gather its unique name from the Edit Source dialog.\n\nA: An easier approach (if you only have a few citations to change & you won't be modifying your text anymore) is to change the citation into a \"Static text\" and manually rewriting the citation.\n\n\n*\n\n*What you do is you find the citation that you wish to edit.\n\n*Click it once so that the the \"grey background\" appears behind the text and on the right side of the \"grey background\" a blue arrow also appears.\n\n*Click the arrow and a drop down list should appear.\n\n*Click \"Convert Citations to Static Text\"\n\n\nNow the Citation is free to be manually edited.\n", "Q: Stuck on Connect to iTunes boot logo and can't connect to iTunes My phone was/is jailbroken, and now I tried to update it from 8.4 to 9.0.2 to try and remove the jailbreak without restoring my phone. Then iTunes said there was an error. It did not say any code. Now my phone is stuck on this screen no matter what I try.\n\nA: iOS 9.0.2 is no longer being signed, so you are unable to restore to it.\nYou will need to restore to the latest version of iOS using DFU restore (connect to computer, hold power and home until the screen turns off and back on with the Apple logo, then let go of power but keep holding home).\nAlso, you should never use Update when a device is jailbroken regardless of iOS version.\n", "Q: Unarchive a file with a set of provided password list Is there a possibility like in jDownloader, where password protected files are automatically extracted by trying all passwords one by one which are provided by the user?\nSomething like this:\n$ unarchive foo.rar --password-list baz.txt\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Get unar from http://unarchiver.c3.cx/commandline\n\n*Extract the archive and put unar (and lsar) somewhere your shell can find it.\n\n*Run\nwhile IFS= read pwd; do\n    unar -p \"$pwd\" ARCHIVE\ndone < password-list.txt\n\n\nA: The solution from @patrix works perfect, except for the case, when the password is not available in the provided list, then the archive will produce a lot of 0 byte files.

I've been accomplishing this for the past year with the following setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Energy Saver > Computer Sleep & Display\nSleep are both set to Never\n\n*Unchecked Put the hard disks to sleep when possible.\n\n*Set a Hot Corner to Put Display to sleep\nThe issue is this has recently stopped working. When I put my cursor in my Hot Corner to turn my display off the display turns off but it also now stops my iMacro scripts from running. I'm not sure if the computer is actually going to sleep though as the display wakes up quickly with any interaction.\nSince this has stopped working I've been turning my brightness all the way down until the display turns off to run my scripts. The issue with this approach though is that the keyboard stays illuminated.\nHow can I turn off my display and keyboard illumination, while at the same time leaving my MacBook Pro running to execute my iMacro scripts?\n\nA: To answer your question, \"How can I turn off my display and keyboard illumination, while at the same time leaving my MacBook Pro running to execute my iMacro scripts?\", one way is to use the Function Keys.\nTo change the Display brightness use F1 and or F2 respectively to decrease and increase brightness.\nTo change the backlit Keyboard brightness use F5 and or F6 respectively to decrease and increase brightness.\nNote that if under System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard you have the \"Use all F1. F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\" check box checked then you'll need to also press the Fn key along with the wanted Function key to use the special features printed on the keys.\nSee Portables: Adjusting the keyboard backlight and OS X El Capitan: Adjust your display’s brightness for additional information and note that although the later document if for OS X El Capitan the brightness function keys for portable Macs are the same in earlier versions.

Any way to get around this?\n\nA: The fault when a computer asks for a DHCP address and then gets one lies with the other device not releasing that address when its lease expires or the router for handing out the lease improperly.\nThe number one cause of the router handing out wrong addresses is when you reboot the router.\nTo fix this - determine how long your lease is set using AirPort utility and change the range you are sending out addresses. For example - if you were sharing 192.168.1.1 change things to start sharing from 192.168.1.200 and up. Then once the lease time has passed after this restart - use a network scan tool to find all the devices that have not renewed and adopted 200+ addresses.\nThose are your problem children so you can either hand them a static IP or fix their software.\nOnce you have that, you can return to the range of addresses you wish to lease out.\nOr if you want to make a bigger change - switch the Airport to use 10.x or 172.x addressing and really break things for the non-compliant devices.\nNote - each device needs to release and renew their address after you reboot, so power off WiFi or restart everything - don't forget about all the printers, internet connected appliance, home automation lights and switches, etc... They tend to be forgotten. If you don't have a network scan tool, look into using http://brew.sh to install nmap. It's powerful and well updated and runs on many versions of OS X.\n\nA: The easiest way to fix this is set up DHCP reservations for your MacBooks.  Set them a ways away from the other devices in your network that routinely conflict with your MacBooks.  \ni.e. If there is another device on your network that ends in x.x.x.100 then set your MacBooks to start at x.x.x.200, then x.x.x.201, etc.  \nHow to set up reservations in an Airport:  http://www.macinstruct.com/node/553 \nThe newest airport utility is slight different but still essentially the same.  \nTypically a DHCP server will hand out IP addresses at the beginning or end of a range - I think the Airport does it from the beginning of the DHCP range, so I would set all my equipment towards the end of the range to help prevent this from happening.  \n", "Q: Tag selected files in Finder with single keyboard shortcut It's been well covered how to create a keyboard shortcut for the Tags... menu option in Finder. What I want is a way to tag selected files or folders with a single keyboard shortcut. The same shortcut should untag them.\n\nA: The solution is to use the OS X built-in Automator and the great tag command-line utility.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new Service that accepts selected files/folders from Finder (follow the steps here)\n\n*In Run Shell Script, select \"Pass input:\" as arguments and use the following code:\n\nTAG=\"Red\"\ntag=\"/usr/local/bin/tag\"\n\nfor filename in \"$@\"\ndo\n  if $tag --list --no-name \"$filename\" | grep \"$TAG\\b\"; then\n    $tag --remove \"$TAG\" \"$filename\"\n  else\n    $tag --add \"$TAG\" \"$filename\"\n  fi\ndone\n\nreplacing the value of TAG with the name of the tag you want to use and tag with the location where tag is installed (the one above should be default for brew).\n\n*Assign a shortcut to this service in the System Settings.\n\n\nThe script simply checks for each file whether it is already tagged with the given tag, and removes or adds the tag to switch it.

Another fact supporting this conclusion is that I have been able to backup to a USB external disk. On the other hand, 1) I have restarted the Time Capsule (which is supposed to fsck the hard drive) without any errors detected, and 2) another computer of mine is backing up wirelessly to this Time Capsule without problems so far (although, truth be told, I do get \"checking for runtime corruption on /dev/disks...\" messages in the backup log). So my questions are:\n1) How could I test if my problem is due to hard disk corruption?\n2) If the answer is \"yes\", is it simple to replace the hard drive inside the Time Capsule?\n3) If you think that the problem may be software related, what are your suggestions for troubleshooting/fixing it?\n\nA: When I had this problem I found it was due to permissions conflicts. Time machine worked after I repaired permissions but not using diskutil for the repair. \n", "Q: Connecting a hardrive to an ipad for iMovie Want to use my ipad for light movie editing computer.

This worked but i had to pay a few dollars a month, download the video files i wanted to splice and i could not work off line. \n\nA: You can not use an external hard drive in combination with iMovie on any iPad. \nIf you are looking to expand your storage space you can look into a Seagate Wireless Plus hard drive, but you will have to store the video files locally in order to edit them with iMovie.\n", "Q: Working with attachments **to** a PDF file in Preview I've got a PDF that has something else (actually, another PDF) as an attachment. Like most Mac users I use Preview by default to view PDFs, and Preview gives no indication that I can find that there is an attachment, nor can I figure out how to access the attachment now that I know it's there. I was pretty confused until I tried Adobe Reader which immediately makes it clear that there is an attachment. Am I missing something here or is Preview essentially ignoring attachments?\n\nA: Preview doesn't support this, but you can extract attachments on the command line using the popper tool pdfdetach.  To install poppler with Homebrew:\nbrew install poppler\n\nTo list attachments in a PDF file called doc.pdf:\npdfdetach -list doc.pdf\n\nTo extract attachments from a PDF file called doc.pdf:\npdfdetach -saveall doc.pdf\n\n\nA: Unfortunately Preview does not support or indicate PDF attachments in a PDF, or any file Preview can open. I suggest you continue to use Adobe Reader for Mac.\nYou can send your feedback about this to Apple here.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro keeps freezing randomly Since about two weeks ago, my MacBook Pro started freezing randomly.

I've tried symlinking /usr/local/Cellar/bash/4.3.32/bin/bash to /usr/local/bin/bash. I've closed Terminal.app. I've even logged out of Mac completely.

A couple of months ago, my Mac Book Pro wouldn't start up - it would make it halfway through and then power down. I took it to the repair store, and they said the hard drive was broken, and they needed to replace it. (Interestingly, they were able to transfer everything in my Applications/ folder to the new hard drive, and that was actually 85% of my content.)\nNow, my computer is having problems booting again. Sometimes it takes a long time, sometimes it doesn't finish booting at all. I was able to boot it into safe mode, and it seems to be working alright right now. What steps should I take now to deal with this problem and not make it any worse?\n\nA: Turns out, the bracket cable is broken. Nothing is wrong with the hard drive.\n", "Q: Bootcamp: Windows can't install This evening I decided to Boot Camp my laptop. I had done it before, a few years ago, but quite recently my laptop got an SSD instead of it's former hard drive, so I had to Boot Camp it again. Since it's been such a long time since the last time - almost four years - I don't really remember how I tackled problems with it back then.\nSo far so great. Everything seemed to be going smoothly at first; I did what Apple's guide told me, and it worked. \nMy mac restarted, I selected the partition it had to use, formatted it, the installation seemed to take off, but then I ran into a problem. \nI got an error that the process couldn't continue, due to a software or hardware change (it was in Dutch, so this would be a rough translation, not a literal quote) and it recommended I insert the windows installation disk and restart. But I can't. I inserted said disc, but nothing really happened.\nPressing escape didn't do anything and enter did not restart, but instead lead to the next screen that only gave me the options of starting windows normally, in safe mode, etc.\nI tried safe mode, but as Windows at this point wasn't actually installed yet, that caused things to circle back to the previous screen, the one with the first error. And from there I was completely stuck.\nSo, after having tried all that made sense without any response from the laptop, I held the power button until it went out. Restarting however, resulted in exactly the same situation. Power button. Rinse, repeat. \nI then went back to the OSX partition, which thankfully hadn't suffered from all this in any way, but I still have not been able to solve the problem, nor find a solution online (I'm probably wording my problem the wrong way, but I don't know how else to phrase it) so now here I am, mildly desperate.\nDoes anybody know how I would go about solving this? Or is there more information needed? If it's necessary, I could try taking a picture of the error screen (screenshots aren't exactly going to work at this point :')  ) but it is entirely in Dutch.\n\nA: With the Windows disk in, restart your Mac and as soon as you hear the startup chime hold down the option key and keep holding it down until you get a list of disks/partitions to boot from.  \nPick the Windows disk to boot off of it, then you should be able to point the Windows setup at the partition you created for Windows (be careful you don't over-write your Mac partition!) and install Windows.  \n", "Q: How do I start rows with 0 (not 1) or not count header rows in Numbers? I'm using the Numbers app to make a database or catalogue of stuff.  For example, a list of all wines I'll try this year.  And for each column, I'll have the name of the wine, a rating, the kind of wine, and a few other items.\nIf the first row of my spreadsheet is a header, and the first row is 1, then every item in the spreadsheet will be off by 1.  To me, this makes absolutely no sense.  Can I start the spreadsheet with the first row being 0 instead of 1?  Or, can I have Numbers not use a row number for the header row?\nIf I could name the columns, this wouldn't matter.  But since Numbers names the columns A, B, C, etc, I have to use a header row to name (or label) the columns, and this leads to the first actual item being in row 2 instead of row 1...  and this leads to every single sort being off by one, since the top item is a label in the header, which gets listed as being #1.\nUsing column A for an index won't work unless there's a way to lock the order of column A, because the index would get sorted each time any other column gets sorted.\n\nA: So, this is easy to solve in Excel...  I don't have access to Numbers at the moment, but I'll give you the solution I'm aware of and you can confirm whether it works in Numbers like it does Excel.\nYou can create a column with the following formula:\n=Row() - 1\nThis will always give you one less than the \"default\" row number, which is what you are looking for.   It also won't be affected by sorting.\nA complete reference of functions that are available in Numbers can be found HERE, including the ROW function.\n\n\nA: =row()-1 works but if you insert a line above your list it will need to be adjusted for each row added (for example, =row() - 2). I recommend:\n\n*\n\n*Start with typing the number 1 in a column for your list separate from the numbers on the side numbers (as recommended for the row function).\n\n\n*Then, in the box below, type = then click on the box where you put the 1 (right above) and then type  + 1 and then hit enter.\n\n\n*You can do this for each subsequent box or just click on the second box, use the copy function (ctrl c or command c if you use mac), and then use the paste function (ctrl v or command v if you use mac) in the box below. And repeat.\n\n\n*Then you can insert lines above your list and it will keep the numbers straight.\n\nA: =A2+1 works fine so long as you don't do operations such as Sort or cut and insert rows. Of course, even with =row()-1 or some variant thereof, you will have operations which will require you to fix the column using a fill down type operation. \nSo it really depends on what type of manipulation of your data your likely to do in the future as to which is easier. \nIf you use merged cells then the +1 method would be better since you might have two or three rows merged and the row()-1 method would key off the first row in the merged cell. \nDepending on how complex your header row is you could use a text box or other element which floats above the cells - and then make row one tall enough to contain your headers as well as your data - and then row 1 would be the first data row and your headers would also appear. Setting the text box formula to = would even allow you to have them be dynamic and easily referenced by pointing at the same source the text boxes point to. \n", "Q: Family member being asked to pay again for app I already purchased and shared with her?

A family group has the limit of six members. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201088 ; also from my experience all the elements of the family group have to be in the same country store.\nThe app has then to be selected using your Account in the Purchased section by your family members (as aidan posted).\nHowever, there are hidden caveats. Not all apps can be shared.\nAs it can be seen perusing this document, https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203046 an app can be marked as non-shareable and furthermore, an app bought by an Apple ID account for Students is not shareable to the family group.\nIn-App purchases are also not available for Family Sharing. From  http://9to5mac.com/2014/09/19/ios-8-how-to-set-up-and-use-family-sharing/:\n\nIn-App purchases are not supported by Family Sharing. So if your children are playing games with the pseudo-currency, or if they are playing games that require in-app purchases to get to the full version these you would be paying for twice. Most apps are now compatible for Family Sharing. However, developers do have the option to opt out of enabling their apps to be used with Family Sharing. When you are viewing the description of the app in the App Store, there is now a label that will say Family Sharing. If it says yes, that means the app is compatible with Family Sharing and can be redownloaded by other family members, before the existence of Family Sharing.\n\n\nA: I had the same issue, none of the apps that cost anything came up with family sharing, but if you manually search for the app in the search bar, then go through all the steps you would if you were to buy it again (obviously ensuring that your accounts are linked properly first) then after you’ve confirmed your payment it will prompt you about a family member having already purchased it and ask if you want to download it for free. Just click “OK” and the app will download without charging you.\n\nA: If Family Sharing is enabled, they should be able to re-download paid apps at no additional cost by tapping App Store > Purchased. \nIf they are on separate Apple ID's linked through Family Sharing they need to choose your account from the top right corner of the Purchased section in App Store. Then they should be able to download the paid app(s) at no additional cost.\n", "Q: Batch resize .svg files I have a folder (original_svg_files) with more than ten thousand .svg files in different sizes and I need to resize each one of them. The name should be the same with the original .svg file and the longest side should be 150px and I also need to keep the aspect ratio (constrain the proportions). \nI tried to use Adobe Illustrator to do that but can't figure out how since it supports only transformation via a percentage. I need to automate this process by the command line or Automator since what I am doing now is really time consuming!\nI am using OS X El Capitan version 10.11.1.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: Looks like the -fit option on this command line utility will do exactly what you want: \nhttps://github.com/vieron/svg-resizer \nIf you need help with brew, look here: http://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/installing-homebrew-os-x-yosemite-10-10-package-manager-unix-apps/ \nIf your not comfortable with the command line, don't let it intimidate you - it's really not that hard.  Post back if you get stuck or something just doesn't make sense.  \n\nA: I'm pretty sure you can use ImageMagick to do what you need. There is a homebrew package for Imagemagick (homebrew is the Mac equivalent of apt-get). So after a quick:\nbrew install imagemagick\n\nYou should be able to use the command line utilities for it. Looks like the convert command should do the resizing with the proportional scaling that you want.\nconvert oldimage.svg -resize \"150>\" oldimage.svg\n\nThis command says to shrink the image so that the longest side is 150. The rest is just using standard shell scripting to get the desired effect.\n\nA: Dunno if this works for mac shell too, but I wrote the following bash script based on the information on the Inkscape forum:\nBasically it takes all svg-files and searches for the svg's viewbox attributes, adding width and height and a group wrapper to resize/scale down the original elements.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor folder in $(ls -d [A-Z]*);\ndo \n  echo \"$folder\";\n  mkdir -p resized/$folder; \n  for svgfile in $(ls $folder/*); \n  do \n    echo \"$svgfile\"; \n    cat \"$svgfile\" | \\\n      sed 's/viewBox=\"0 0 161.9 162\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 161.9 162\" xml:space=\"preserve\">/width=\"41px\" height=\"41px\" viewBox=\"0 0 41 41\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 41 41\" xml:space=\"preserve\">\\n<g transform=\"scale(0.25)\">/g' | \\\n      sed 's/<\\/svg>/<\\/g>\\n<\\/svg>/g' \\\n      > resized/$svgfile;\n  done;\ndone\n\nYMMV depending on whether your svg-files are all using the same original viewbox, mine did.\n", "Q: Auto rotate photos and save them afterwards (perhaps using Preview?) So I was previewing some photos using Preview app and I notice that Preview (at least on 10.10.5 Yosemite) automatically fixes rotation issues on the thumbnail on the left.\ne.g. photo is upside-down when viewing it but the thumbnail shows it the right-side up. On preview, I still have to go through each photo and manually rotate them to make the changes permanent.\nDo you know of any freebie app (or not so expensive) or perhaps using Preview? I want the app to ignore pics that's right-side up.\n\nA: I came across a binary called \"nconvert\". I copied these to /usr/local/bin.

I keep getting this dialogue on a recently upgraded MacBook running El Capitan -- it doesn't matter how many times I enter my password, it just keeps opening and opening:\n\nThis is appearing when trying to launch the Private Internet Access VPN client.\nI've contacted their support numerous times and they just keep saying \"ask Apple for help\" (great..), but Apple has been unresponsive as well. I've been told it may have something to do with either \n1) corrupt disk permissions ( which I've repaired, did not help)\n2) corrupt keychain ( I rebuilt my keychain, did not help)\n3) corrupt admin permissions (wasn't entirely sure how to repair this one..)\nIf ANYONE knows how I can get this stupid dialogue to go away so I can connect to my VPN client it would be much appreciated!\nOn a previous OSX install I had the client working fine (in Yosemite). When I did a fresh install for El Capitan, I tried to install it via HomeBrew, but that is when it stopped working. I've since uninstalled it from HomeBrew and tried to install via the website package, but I just get this error over and over and over. No matter how many times I enter the password.\nEDIT additional information:\nThe client installs / runs fine if I create a fresh user account and install it there. This will not work for me -- I need it to run on my main (admin / primary) account.\nI've tried installing the client both via Homebrew (Cask package manager), as well as through the download link from the PIA website. Both have the same issue.\nI believe the issue began when I attempted to install through Homebrew -- I had had it installed the \"normal\" way in the past and it worked fine.

NOTE! If they don’t offer an uninstaller, DON’T just throw the app away. This will leave hanging bits that might be part of the problem. Use a tool like MacCleaner, CleanMyMac, App Cleaner, or App Removal.\n\n*Uninstall Homebrew. I’ve seen cases where Homebrew has left stuff in a bad state if the installation didn’t go right the first time. Simply uninstalling the app didn’t fix the problem for me, I had to get rid of Homebrew as well.\n\n*Run Disk First Aid and repair your Disk Permissions (sounds like you already know how to do this).\n\n*Now’s the tricky part, you need to check your Keychain for leftover bits. So first run Key Chain First Aid, just to make sure your Keychain is OK.\n\n*Next you need to search through your Keychain to see if you can find any keys, certs or passwords leftover from the VPN software you have been trying to run. So search on the name of the software, the IP or name of the server you are trying to access, or anything else you think is associated with the software. You will want to delete those keys, certs or passwords. BE CARFUL THAT YOU DELETE ITEMS YOU KNOW ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE VPN SOFTWARE. Otherwise you might create more problems for yourself.\n\n\n*Reboot your computer.\n\n*Re-download and reinstall the PIA VPN Software.\n\n*Reconfigure the software and try connecting again.\nHopefully at this point your system will be free of any previous issues, and the new install will get things working again.  If the problem STILL persists the only other suggestion I would have would be to rest your keychain. But I don’t recommend this unless all else fails.\n\nA: I encountered this exact issue on my second try at upgrading to El Capitan. On booting up, I encountered the \"network setup is trying to modify the system network configuration” dialogue that would not go away.  For this second attempt, I had created and used a separate USB boot install drive rather than install directly from from the internet.  \n(After my first attempt via the internet, El Capitan installed without problem, but hung when the startup reached 100%.  I suspect that the system was hanging before getting to the point of displaying the 'network setup' Username/Password message. I then reinstalled my Yosemite system from a backup.)\nWhen the 'network setup' Username/Password message noted by the questioner appeared, the two answers given here gave me the clue that I needed --- PIA was the likely culprit, so that I needed to remove PIA from the upgraded drive before booting up.  \nMy solution was then to boot from an external boot drive, then adapting to my situation the instructions for for uninstalling PIA that can be found at: https://support.privateinternetaccess.com/Knowledgebase/Article/View/52 \ni.e., \n\n\n*\n\n*Move the file \"Private Internet Access.app\" from the Applications folder into the Trash, then empty the trash.\n\n*Open Terminal from your Applications -> Utilities menu.\n\n*Type the following command, hitting Enter afterwards:  \nrm -rf ~/.pia_manager/\nFor booting from a separate drive, the '~' needs to be replaced by the path to that drive.  Also, precede the command by 'sudo'.  Take care not to accidentally hit 'Enter' before typing '.pia_manager/' !!  Possibly a boot into Safe Mode could have been used to achieve the same end.\nI have drawn this issue to the attention of PIA.\n", "Q: Is it possible to add an app to your wishlist in the desktop version of the App Store I love adding apps to my wishlist on the iPhone or iPad.\n\nI would only find it normal that the same thing can be done with the Mac OS X version of the AppStore.\nObviously, this feature should be located under the little arrow of the price tag, right under the app's icon:\n\nBut it's not the case:\n\nIt seems that gifting an app from the Mac OS X version of the App Store isn't there either.\nAs we can see in the 3rd image, it isn't on the right-hand side either.\nSo, am I missing something, or is the desktop version of the App Store a diminished version of the iOS's?\n\nA: You're not missing anything, it is as you suggest.

After a harrowing couple of days, I found this site and am hoping someone can help.\nI have a 2011 MacBook Pro which has recently started having problems booting. During a game session (SIMMS), it suddenly shutdown and refused to reboot, and since then I've been unable to use it at all. The MBP has a new install of El Capitan on it but it's been working fine for the last couple of weeks since the install.\nI tried Safemode, Recovery mode etc, but it wouldn't boot into any of these either.

This process went without a hitch.\nAfter loading it, I booted from the \"companion\" MacBook to make sure the OS was working OK, and it was!\nI restarted the \"Companion\" MBP and ejected the faulty MBP, and tried to restart it normally. No go, still wouldn't boot even with the new OS.\nI've tried a number of things to get it to boot, following this fresh install, but all that happening is that it'll get to the Apple Logo, try to boot, shutdown and then go around in circles.\nEventually it'll stop on the gray screen and the fans will startup and keep running.\nI'm at the end of my knowledge, so any advice would be welcome!\nThanks\n\nA: Have you had a luck with it yet? \nSound like it may be similar to mine.

It is also free & open source\n\nA: Update 2017-03-31:\nRogue Amoeba, the previous maintainers of the open source Soundflower project, has a new (paid) application called Loopback which seems to be easier and more dependable to work with than Soundflower. It solves some issues with Soundflower, like reenabling volume up/down via the Mac media keys. Again, it is a paid product with a trial mode. https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/\nSoundflower can still be found here: https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower\n\nSoundflower is a virtual audio device for OS X that can pass audio from applications to other applications. It does this by routing your audio output as an audio input to the system.\nStep 1\nAfter installation, a new device will be available in System Preferences > Sound. Go to the Input tab and select Soundflower (2ch) as the input device.\n\nStep 2\nIf you want to route the audio and hear it yourself at the same time, skip to Step 3.\nIf you're okay with not having to hear the output yourself, you can now go to the Output tab and select Soundflower (2ch). You are now routing your Output to Input, and will be able to record the audio playing to an application like QuickTime, Evernote or Just Play Record.\n\nStep 3\nIf you want to hear the audio while it's playing on your normal Output device (e.g. your Built-in speakers or attached headphones), you need to open the native OS X application Audio Midi Setup. It's located in your Applications folder under /Applications/Utilities.\nPress the + button in the bottom left corner, and press Create Multi-Output Device. Mark to use both your Built-in Output and Soundflower (2ch). Now you can hear audio as usual while routing the Output into your Input via Soundflower.\n\nNow that you have created a Multi-Output Device, go back to System Preferences > Sound and select it on the Output tab as in Step 2.\nTip: You can also change the Input/Output settings by holding ⌥ (alt/opt) and left-clicking the Volume icon in the OS X menu bar.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\nHOWEVER, while the above will work at times, I have noticed that the behaviour of Soundflower can be erratic from time to time. When originally composing this answer, I couldn't get it to work even though I hadn't modified the setup that was working the day before.\nIt has stopped working a few times before, and while I haven't exactly identified how to mitigate the issue, I have noticed that something of the following may have helped to get it working again:\n\n*\n\n*Check if the volume has been reset for the Multi-Output Device or any of it's sub-devices in Audio Midi Setup. Be sure to check all tabs (Input/Output) on both the aggregated Output device and and its aggregated sub-devices. There's quite a few tabs here, and the volume sliders on one of them may have been reset to zero. This has happened to me a few times.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Volume resetting to zero wouldn't have to be a big problem, if the normal volume controls (media keys and menu bar volume icon) worked as usual. But sometimes, the volume icon in the menu bar is grayed out and the volume can only be manipulated in Audio Midi Setup. I don't know why this sometimes happens, because when I use some other Multi-Output Devices I have created that also includes my other computer connected via Thunderbolt in Target Display Mode, I can magically use the volume media keys as normal. More experimentation is needed here.\n\n\nA: I might've found an easier way to set it up with loopback. Set input and output to Loopback Audio (in System Preferences/Audio) and then as in the picture in loopback itself.\nHearing the audio and can Shazam tracks at the same time.\n\n\nA: For Mac OS, alternatively, you can install BackgroundMusic which also allows you to control each Audio Application's output volume (which Windows 10 and Linux can do but MacOS cannot do on its own):\n\nAfter that, in PyAudio or SoundDevice, you can see additional devices:\n\nBackgroundMusic devices are dual input-output devices, i.e., they can be used as either input or output devices. Setting device index to the BackgroundMusic device will allow you to record from MacBook's speaker without microphone interference.\n\nA: Perhaps JACK Audio Connection Kit could be of some use here. It offers an OSX release.\n\nA: I just came across this new application - GroundControl CASTER.

When the new owner turns on the Mac, the Setup Assistant will guide them through the setup process.\n\n", "Q: Enable keyboard tweaks on apps which run as root I am using exKey and KeyShorcut Pro tweaks for customization of my iOS keyboard, on a jailbroken iPhone. I wanted to duplicate my Facebook app and used duplicatorstore.com to duplicate Facebook as it supports iOS 9.0.2. I installed 'Facebook 2' from this site.\nWhen I try to use 'Facebook 2' app, the iOS keyboard is shown like Cydia, iFile (exKey and KeyShorcut Pro features are not shown) and I must write my Facebook password every time I open the duplicate Facebook app. I want to use KeyShorcut Pro tweak with this duplicate Facebook app because I don't want to always write my long Facebook password and want to set it to a key shortcut.\nHow can enable keyboard tweak features on a iOS app which runs as root?\n\nA: Its not possible. Cydia Enable tweak already doing this. Just a problem. Not updated for 1.1.26 of Cydia version. \n\nA: This is not possible as tweaks run as the mobile user such that they can be controlled by Cydia Substrate. This means that if a tweak malfunctions, Substrate Safe Mode can disable the tweak.\nIt would be dangerous for a tweak with a large/non-existent filter list (i.e. available in many/all apps including the SpringBoard) to run as root which would prevent it being disabled. If such a tweak were to inject into SpringBoard and cause a crash, and not be able to be disabled in the event of the aforementioned crash, the device would need to be restored.\n", "Q: Unsuccessful

By all means get Word for Mac and use that instead.\n", "Q: Time Machine - move backup from local disk to network volume. Wrong case sensitivity? I am trying to move a Time Machine backup from a Firewire disk (called disk1) directly connected to a computer to a network share, that is, from a folder in/on /Disk1/Backup.backupdb to a sparsebundle/disk image (called dmg1) stored in the network share.\nFollowing some suggestions in a Time Machine FAQ I begun a new TM backup to let Time Machine create the needed disk image. As soon as the image was created I cancelled the backup.\nNext step was to mount this new image (the resulting volume is called Time Machine Backup, TMB for short) and delete the /TMB/Backups.backupdb directory. Finally I was supposed to copy /disk1/Backups.backupdb to /TMB/. Unfortunately, this last step fails with an error message The volume has the wrong case sensitivity for a backup.\nApparently disk1 is not case sensitive (which was/is the default) but for some reason Time Machine sparsebundles are created case sensitive = you can't copy an old local backup (Or can you? Finder prevents it but \"logically\" it shouldn't be a problem to copy files from a case insensitive volume to a case sensitive volume. The other way around should, however, not work.) to the disk image that is necessary to use if you want to backup to a network volume.\nThis must be a pretty common usecase, especially since Apple themselves sell a simple NAS (Time Capsule) for this specific purpose, so how is such a migration supposed to be done? The only/most common advice I found when I google for solutions is to start over, but then you waste quite a bit of space as well as lose readily accessible backup history. Not good.\n\nA: I ran into the same issues when following advice similar to the OP, specifically, to use Time Machine to start the backup to create a new sparse bundle on the network share, stop the back and copy Backups.backupdb to the newly created sparse bundle.\nMy solution is to mimic what Time Machine does to create the new sparse bundle with only one difference:  format with \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\", which is not case sensitive.  The major benefit to this solution, in addition to preserving old backups, is that this maintains all of Time Machine's expectations of a network share backup disk, and thus, hourly auto backups, etc. will work seamlessly without other scripts or workarounds.\nI've kept details and notes for myself in the \"Migration from External HDD to Samba\" section at:  https://gist.github.com/martian111/e0d9885004eb56fd6abf3d1ba7671737, but the TL;DR steps relevant to solving this question are (starting at where the OP left off when he/she encountered the error):\n\n\n*\n\n*If necessary, stop Time Machine backup and disable until migration is complete.\n\n*Create a new sparse bundle using \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" as the format and the same naming conventions as the unusable, case-sensitive sparse bundle created by Time Machine.\n\n*Use distutil to enableOwnership on the \"Time Machine Backups\" volume (after mounting the created sparse bundle).  (Ref: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/53243/174505)\n\n*In the Finder, move/copy the Backups.backupdb directory to the new volume after confirming ownership is enabled.  The Finder should prompt for admin privileges.\n\n*Unmount \"Time Machine Backups\" volume\n\n*Copy com.apple.TimeMachine.* metadata files from the sparsebundle directory created by Time Machine into the sparsebundle created above.\n\n*Delete the unusable, Time Machine created sparsebundle, and replace it with the one created here (changing the sparsebundle directory name).\n\n*Re-enable Time Machine's \"Back Up Automatically\".\n\n\nOnce the above is done, the next Time Machine backup should recognize the sparse bundle created and continue where the last backup left off.  Also, all historical backups are browsable when entering Time Machine.\nNote: My Mac's root volume is also not case-sensitive, so I assume this is safe for my setup.  \nNote 2: My Time Machine network share is a Samba/SMB share running in Linux.  The disks hosting the SMB share are encrypted with LUKS, and thus, I do not use Time Machine's encrypted backup feature.\n\nA: I recommend copying the data somewhere and following the instructions at the bottom of this page: https://web.archive.org/web/20170910134343/http://pondini.org/TM/18.html#id18\nYour assumption is that changing the structure around the files should leave the files intact, I think, and that's just not correct. It's like saying somehow that files can exist completely independently of the structure that supports them.. which isn't really true.  A car isn't a car anymore if you strip away the body and the transmission and some of the engine. Now, you can replace those parts with parts from another car, say, but the performance will be different. To that end maybe you could create a case sensitive partition and copy the files there, destroy the old one, re-create the old one properly and copy the files back, but I wouldn't risk it. Your data's worth more than that. You want to know without a doubt that if you need a backup, you can get it, and messing around this way might introduce doubt (as it should).\n\nA: Instead of using Time Machine to create the sparsebundle/disk image, you can create it using Disk Utility, (here's some information on how to do that: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/turn-nas-windows-share-time-machine-backup/) and in this way you control the case-sensitivity. So if you are copying from a case-insensitive drive you can set the sparse bundle to be case-insensitive as well. Then, when you copy your Backups.backupdb folder into the disk image, you won't get the error message.\n\nA: I think i found a very easy solution to a really hard problem (no need to re-format drives etc)\n\n\n*\n\n*go to the TM backup\n\n*select the folder that you want to copy\n\n*compress folder\n\n*compressed folder will appear on desktop\n\n*uncompress folder\n\n*copy it wherever you want\n\n", "Q: Monitor which folder has used the disk storage I got a mac air with only 256 GB storage.  Some apps must be using the storage and after deleting and moving everything I can (down to relocate mail and dropbox to external disk using symbolic links and their own folder), the storage is still kept on dropping. It lost quite quickly down to 0.01G per 15 minutes. Looking using du df or visual is hard to spot so far.\nIs there any way (shell script etc.) to monitor which folder is increasing in size over time? (Space approach)\nIf that is not possible, how about a script to monitor any directories that have been modified in the last 15 minutes? (Time approach)\nMany advice I found is only on one folder or one layer e.g. home/* but not the whole directory structure.

The most challenging step is creating the FAT formatted partition labeled BOOTCAMP. If something goes wrong, you are in danger of loosing data on your OS X partition.\n\nA: I was prepared to follow the instructions above, but noticed Boot Camp clearly said \"Install Windows 7 or later version\". So I tried it and everything worked perfectly.\nI installed Windows 10.1 on a mid 2011 iMac running El Capitan, using Boot Camp. The only setback was having to burn the Windows ISO to a DVD because it wouldn't let me install from a USB.\nI wonder if they updated Boot Camp Assistant since this question was asked.\n\nA: I have an 27' Imac 2011, which according to Apple is not supported for Windows 10 install.\nI just walked through the steps of Bootcamp 6.0.1, downloaded the Bootcamp support files, created the Windows partition in Bootcamp, inserted a DVD of the W10 x64 ISO that I downloaded from MS and followed the procedures.\nThe only problem I encountered (eventhough I was prepared for more..) was that I had to get a USB wired keyboard and mouse during the installation steps. However the install as such went smooth and when finalized the Bootcamp support drivers loaded nicely. I had to pair my Apple keyboard with the system. After that everything including sound, Bluetooth, graphics and what not worked like a charm.\nSince after build 1511 of W10 you don't have to upgrade from 7 or 8.1 to get a free upgrade, you can do a clean install instead and register with a valid 7, 8 or 8.1 license key, for me that worked great.\nSo when Apple states that my Imac 2011 is not supported for W10, I guess it's currently more of a statement than a fact. I guess they mean that they don't put any further additional efforts into keeping it compatible onwards whenever MS decides to change W10 system logic.\nHowever since W10 is really a polished W8.1, with basically the same \"under the hood\" logic, any Apple Bootcamp supported Mac up to W8.1  Mac's (like my Imac 2011) is perhaps likely to support also W10, even if Apple doesen't want to state that.\n", "Q: Why am I having to pay again to listen to songs I already paid for at the ITunes store?

When taking pictures using the front facing camera and a timer of an iPhone it automatically does burst mode.\nWhen viewing the photos in the Photos app, it somehow knows to group the burst photos together.\nIf I connect the iPhone to a Windows machine, they are not grouped in any obvious way.\nHow does iOS know the photos are grouped? Is it metadata in the files?\n\nA: All the photos that are taken in a burst sequence share a \"BurstUUID\" in their EXIF data. This is how applications know they are related.\nFor example I just took a burst of images, installed exiftool and ran exiftool -BurstUUID *.JPG against the directory with the burst images. This is the output.\n======== IMG_0076.JPG\nBurst UUID                      : 65A7DF0A-1F09-4600-917B-9572A16AD016\n======== IMG_0077.JPG\nBurst UUID                      : 65A7DF0A-1F09-4600-917B-9572A16AD016\n======== IMG_0078.JPG\nBurst UUID                      : 65A7DF0A-1F09-4600-917B-9572A16AD016\n======== IMG_0079.JPG\nBurst UUID                      : 65A7DF0A-1F09-4600-917B-9572A16AD016\n======== IMG_0080.JPG\nBurst UUID                      : 65A7DF0A-1F09-4600-917B-9572A16AD016\n======== IMG_0081.JPG\nBurst UUID                      : 65A7DF0A-1F09-4600-917B-9572A16AD016\n======== IMG_0082.JPG\nBurst UUID                      : 65A7DF0A-1F09-4600-917B-9572A16AD016\n======== IMG_0083.JPG\nBurst UUID                      : 65A7DF0A-1F09-4600-917B-9572A16AD016\n======== IMG_0084.JPG\nBurst UUID                      : 65A7DF0A-1F09-4600-917B-9572A16AD016\n======== IMG_0085.JPG\nBurst UUID                      : 65A7DF0A-1F09-4600-917B-9572A16AD016\n======== IMG_0086.JPG\nBurst UUID                      : 65A7DF0A-1F09-4600-917B-9572A16AD016\n   11 image files read\n\nFor another application on Windows (or any other platform) to recognise and show these images as a group it will need to be rewritten to recognise this new EXIF tag.\n\nA: Loved this post, I used it to make photos think my bursts weren't bursts. Useful when you've picked out all the photos you want and have to import them back in. This script (all it does is ensure all burst photos have a unique uuid) needs exiftools installed on a mac.

The only issue is that I am not at college every day. \nIs there a way I can schedule Do Not Disturb for certain days? (For example: Tuesday-Thursday)\n\nA: Sadly, on a non jailbroken phone you can only set Do Not Disturb to set hours, regardless of which day.  Therefore, every day gets the same hours.\nWhat would be nice, would be a system like the alarms where you can set multiple ones and have them repeat on choosable days, then you could set 2 DND period, one to cover weekdays, and one for weekends etc.\nI would recommend making a feature request at this link.\n\nA: The only way to achieve that is with a jailbreak. \n", "Q: Unable to import into Photos from iPhone over USB?

I would like to move/copy a large size of files from on hard drive to another. Do I need to verify the moved files to be on the safe side or is that over-kill? If not, what software should I use?\nOn Windows there is a software called Teracopy for this.\n\nA: This discussion seems to suggest that Finder verifies copied files when copying across media (but not otherwise). This means that you don't have to verify it yourself. The only problem is I can't find proof or official confirmation that this is true. So I wouldn't 100% trust it.\nIn any case, if you want to make sure manually, there are two kinds of tools you can use.\nOption 1: Use tools that tell you whether you copied successfully. This QA shows you how to use diff tools (command-line or GUI, your choice) to do it. stuffe's answer to your question shows a quick and dirty way to be reasonably sure the copy operation was ok: just check the total folder sizes.\nOption 2: Use rsync. Rsync is a tool that can find differences between the copy source and destination, and update the destination to reflect the source. It's different from cp -R because (1) it tells you if there are differences, so it kind of does that diff does and (2) it only needs to copy over the differences, which makes it faster when the destination is almost up to date.\nThere are three common ways you might want to use rsync:\n\n\n*\n\n*rsync --dry-run (aka rsync -n) to tell rsync to display what files need to be updated without doing anything. This is basically like diff.\n\n*Just use rsync to copy files over, and run it again to verify and fix differences.\n\n*Some people say that Finder copies faster that rsync. You can use Finder to do the initial copy, then use rsync once to verify and fix differences.\n\n\nImportant rsync flags to know:\n\n\n*\n\n*-v, verbose, makes rsync print what is being copied. This is good for the verification step, so you see what didn't get copied right earlier.\n\n*-a, archive, sets a bunch of other flags that tell rsync to preserve modification time, permissions, etc. If you only want to preserve a subset of file metadata, read the rsync man page to see which flags you want to set.\n\n*Some people are saying that the version of rsync included with Mac OS does not support copying HFS extended file attributes, which store things like whether the file extension is shown, \"Open with…\" settings\", spotlight comments, tags, etc. To get the latest copy of rsync, install Homebrew and brew install homebrew/dupes/rsync.\n\n\nA: rsync is the tool you want  it will do the verify whilst doing the copy and if you are interrupted it can be restarted\nNote that OSX's rsync is old and it you care about extended attributes you need a newer version\n\nA: Carbon Copy Cloner is fantastic software that will re-copy anything that failed.\nLink: http://www.bombich.com/\nAnd FYI, this is an easy to use front-end for the venerable rsync command line tool, plus some optimizations. Rsync has been around for 20+ years I believe.\n\nA: If the copy operation is successful, then there should be no need to verify.  However, a quick sanity check is to highlight all the files from the top level of the drive, and use Option+cmd+i\nDo this for source and destination, and check the number of files matches, and the total file size (doesn't matter if the size on disk differs, this can change depending on your drive configuration).\n\n\nA: I would suggest rsync, but since you said you aren't comfortable with the bash terminal, might I suggest Unison? https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/download.html\nIt's use case it to synchronise two directories that can be either local or remote. It uses rsync as part of it's back-end and is always careful to leave both directories in a safe state. \n\nA: I use RapidCopy for this - http://www.lespace.co.jp/file_bl/rapidcopy/manual/index_en.html\nHedge is also great - https://hedge.video\nUpdate: I used Teracopy when I was on Windows.\n", "Q: How do I disable iCloud without losing all my photos? I foolishly enabled iCloud hoping that I could sync photos between my apple devices. However, I do not want the same photos on all my devices and I do not want ANY at all stored long term in my cloud. I had hoped I could delete the ones that were not wanted from individual devices. Can I do this, and if so, how? I can't find any way of manually deleting them from the cloud without them disappearing from my phone, or from my phone without them disappearing from the cloud.\nIf this isn't possible, is there any way to delete my iCloud without deleting all my photos?\n\nA: In short, disabling iCloud should keep your photos on your device. To turn it off, navigate to \"System Preferences\" > \"iCloud\" and click the \"options\" button next to \"Photos\". Deselect \"iCloud Photo Library\" and \"My Photo Stream\" (as below).\n\nNote: On iOS turn this off under the iCloud setting, not the Photos & Camera settings.\n\nTo answer the question\n\n...is there any way to delete my iCloud without deleting all my photos?\n\nTurn iCloud Photo Library off. I have tested this on my Mac and all my photos are still there. You can not delete iCloud because it is a service, not a place or thing. Hence you just stop using it.\nIf the Mail Man stopped delivering letters, you still get to keep the ones you already have.\n\nCan I do this, and if so, how?\n\nBy definition synchronisation (sync) means to make the same. So iCloud will do whatever it can to make sure all your devices have the same content for everything. This is obviously not what you want.\nHowever, there are three main parts to iCloud photos, not just the syncing bit.\n\n\n*\n\n*iCloud Photo Library (the syncing one I assume you have enabled – a.k.a sync everything)\n\n*My Photo Stream (upload only new photos you have taken to all devices)\n\n*iCloud Photo Sharing (upload selected albums).\n\n\nThink of these as three different services. You want to enable iCloud Photo Sharing so that you may select only the albums you want to keep in sync. As far as I'm aware, iCloud Photo Sharing does not store pictures in iCloud like the photo library does. It says below, this is for sharing with other people, but you can just add yourself when sharing the album.\n\nTo share albums\nOn Mac, select an Album you which to share, then click the share button. Click \"iCloud Photo Sharing\", then the big plus to add the album. Now just add yourself as a contact in the \"invite people\" section.\nOn iOS, there is a little cloud symbol at the bottom of the screen in the \"Photos\" app labeled \"Shared\". If it is empty, it will guide you though it.\n", "Q: Unwrap Finder Folder I really like the (new-ish) Finder contextual menu option to move selected files into a new folder. I was wondering if the opposite exists too, where a folder is \"unwrapped\", where the contents are moved back to the parent folder.\nEx:\n\nSelect 4 files in Photos folder; Use \"Create folder with 4 Items\"; new folder created.\nRight-click the new folder; \"Unwrap Folder\"; 4 files returned to Photos folder, empty folder deleted.\n\n\nA: The 2 options are not quite the same, so I can't see anything like this existing.\nWhen you use New Folder with Selection (4 items) (for example) creation of the folder is a simple task, to create a new folder and request a name for it.\nBut once a folder is created, there are multiple results from a proposed \"unwrap\" command, depending on if you select all the files in the folder or not.  Let's say you select all the visible files with the mouse instead of cmd+a, but you miss one that's scrolled off the bottom:\n\n\n*\n\n*Should it abandon the attempt to unwrap, because there are unselected files?\n\n*Should it move the selected files back, and leave the orphan file alone?  \n\n*Should it move the selected files back a level, and then remove the folder regardless of the fact that it still has contents?\n\n*What if there are further subfolders?\n\n*What if files don't have permission at the next level back, say they were on the users home directory, or the root of the filesystem?\n\n\nThe choices in copying stuff back one level and removing their previous location is far far tricker than simply creating a new folder and moving the selected files inside.\nI'm sure that custom scripts can be written to provide something similar, but I imagine the use case it pretty unusual, as well as much trickier to implement in a way that won't confuse, as such it doesn't exist by default.\n", "Q: edit server in iphone exchange email We used to use Mobile Iron to configure our users' Exchange email on their iPhones.\nRecently it was decided to stop using Mobile Iron. I'm not sure how the rest of our IT dept managed the transition, made about a month ago.\nCurrently, an iPhone user's Exchange email server setting is incorrect, probably set to work with Mobile Iron.\nIs the Exchange email server editable in the iPhone Mail app? \nI can't seem to edit it.\n\nA: Generally speaking all exchange servers since (I believe) 2007 have an automatic configure function. So if your mail server is at mail.company.com the automatic configure URL will be autodiscover.company.com.\nAssuming your mail server was set up correctly along with the correct DNS entries, merely removing and re-adding that account from your iPhone should fix the issue. Assuming your IT department hasn't done something non-standard.\n", "Q: How can I prevent a user to use admin rights to work around restrictions? We just bought my husband a new Mac. \nCurrently, we each have parental restrictions requiring a password on our accounts when it comes to \"mature\" ratings on our iPhones and iPads (older generations) This holds us accountable for each other and prevents inappropriate \"adult\" material from being viewed:downloaded on our machines and causing issues in our marriage. \nHowever, with the new MacBook Air that we purchased, he is the administrator because it is his computer. We noticed you can't set up parental controls as the administrator. Is this correct? \nIf he were to set up another account as a guest, could he still use his iCloud under that setting? Could we lock the administrator account so that settings could not be changed? \nCould someone set the password for \"administrator\" to something we don't know and have him use an account as a managed user under his Mac? \nWhat is the best way to own the computer, be the primary user but also set self limitations? \n\nA: Well, somebody (aka at least one user account) needs to have full admin privileges on a Mac, there is no way around it. If you want to restrict the ability of an account, you will have to set up a dedicated user account (and define Parental Restrictions for it) and use this account for day to day work.\nYou would still need an admin account to install software etc, so you could for instance split the admin password in half, with each of you only knowing one part. Whenever an admin password is required, you both would need to sit in front of the Mac then and enter your respective half.\n\nA: Screen time can also be used to limit admin users and you can set a passcode to protect screen time settings, so that the settings cannot be altered unless you know the passcode, whether you are an admin user or not plays no role (no passcode, no change).\n\nA: Filter/Monitor this at the Network level\nIt may seem counterintuitive to recommend a non-Apple product on an Apple centric website, but the main issue you have here is a permissions issue.  Essentially, what one one administrator can do, another administrator can undo.\nBy taking this to the “network” level, you eliminate all the permissions issues, the configuration tasks for each machine.  You also have the added benefit of covering all connected devices regardless of operating system,\nFor instance, suppose one of you grabs the super cheap $50 USD Amazon Fire Tablet that goes on sale every year around Christmas and decides to covertly use it to browse those risqué real estate listings.   Apple parental controls will never catch this, but something running at the network level will because all traffic has to go through the network.\nThere are many products and services that can meet your needs here:\n\n*\n\n*Internet routers with parental controls and reporting capabilities\n\n*DNS (Domain) filtering services (cloud based) that allow you to configure what gets blocked with reporting\n\nThe Correct Approach\nI am the last person to offer relationship advice, but I do know there is no product on the market that can fix trust issues.  If there is a fundamental lack of trust between two people, the correct fix is to address that directly with the help of a professional.  The monitoring/reporting products and services can help validate that trust, but they won’t fix it.  I genuinely hope you can find a solution to the issues you face.\n", "Q: FileVault: How come a new user can log in without disk password?

However, the  folder that I was previously using is \"stuck\" as the Archive folder, and my efforts to set them to a new year (I use Archive/{year}) make no difference.\nIn El Capitan (10.11) it seems that they've changed how settings are stored so my changes to the ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/Accounts.plist appear to be being ignored.  I've had a good dig around the new(?) ~/Library/Mail/V3/ and resulting ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/ folders, to no avail.\nUnfortunately I'm poking around blindly, so I hoped that somebody here might help.\n\nA: Under OS X El Capitan (tested with Mail 9.2), you can set it directly within the Mail application:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select your new archive folder.\n\n*From the menu, choose Mailbox > Use This Mailbox As > Archive Mailbox\nIn German, it is Postfach > Dieses Postfach verwenden als > Postfach \"Archiv\".\nEdit: Apparently at Apple they realized, that the menu location in El Capitan wasn't ideal and so they changed it again.\nUnder macOS Sierra (tested with Mail 10.1), you can still set it directly within the Mail application:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the menu, choose Mail > Preferences > Accounts > Select your account on the left > Mailbox Behavior\nIn German, it is Mail > Einstellungen > Accounts > Links den betreffenden Account auswählen > Postfach-Verhalten.\n", "Q: Why does OS X want me to \"upgrade\" from El Capitan to Yosemite Beta 4? This is just silly:\n\nIf I try accepting (no, I wouldn't go through with it), it just says that the update is unavailable.  So why does it ask me to downgrade, and how do I get rid of this?\n\nA: The App Store can get confused for several reasons. I find it silly as well when it's confused but untangling things is a bit prickly and removes the humor in most cases :-(\nThe first and most likely is that somewhere on your filesystem an older version of the Yosemite installer exists and the store is seeing an \"update\" to offer. It's not really designed for the case where a downloaded app then installs the OS and clearly doesn't contemplate that the installer you \"update\" will in fact not run since downgrades do not happen by design on OS X.\nHere are some of the various situations where clearing caches might help as well if you can't find the app itself and compress/delete/move it to a folder where Spotlight does not index it:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I hide / remove updates from the Mac App Store?\n\n*Remove application from App Store's Update section\n\n*How to remove deleted app from OS X update list?\nMy personal favorite is to edit the App itself to remove the _MASreceipt files that indicate an app came from the Mac App Store itself:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I opt out of updates for one app when using the App Store?\n\n*Mac App Store - how to check which account was used to buy app\n\nA: This has been driving me nuts for 4 weeks now!

Is there a way to do this in one step, remembering the password for 60 seconds?\nThis is not a duplicate. I don't want to make my normal user a suoder.\n\nA: The passwords used for login and sudo may be the same, but the authentication mechanism behind is it different. So there is no direct way to avoid having to enter the password twice.\nThings you can do to overcome this (but with their own drawbacks):\n\n\n*\n\n*Add your current user to /etc/sudoers, so you can use sudo without having to login as another user. You would still need to enter your password whenever you use sudo\n\n*Enable ssh and add the public key of current user to the authorized ssh keys of the admin user. This allows you to log in as admin with ssh admin@localhost, without entering a password\n\n\n\nFor the second option, do the following once you've enabled ssh in System Preferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*As your normal user, run ssh-keygen (and just press enter on all questions)\n\n*Replace ADMIN with the name of the admin user and run\nssh ADMIN@localhost \"mkdir ~/.ssh; cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\" < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nThis will be the last time you'll need to enter the password of the admin user to log in\n\n*Run ssh ADMIN@localhost to log in as the admin user\n\n\nA: Once again open root shell, edit /etc/sudoers using your favourite text editor, and after entry %admin ALL=(ALL) ALL enter yourusername ALL=(ALL) ALL, where yourusername is your Unix-style user name (john or root rather than \"John Smith\" or \"System Administrator\").\n", "Q: Internet through a NAS and Time Capsule I have tried to use my Time Capsule as external storage and backup but finally realized it's not working very well.

That works well I think.\nMy question is, how do I connect my internet for best effect if I get a NAS? Modem > TC > NAS? Or how does it work?\nAdditional comments are welcomed!\n\nA: The NAS won't have any routing ability so it's pretty sure that it won't be directly connected to the modem.\nYour schema is what I recommend. I have exactly the same architecture with a modem, an Airport Express and a Synology DS215j.\nModem ---------------- TimeCapsule (as router) ------------------ NAS\n       WAN Interface               |              LAN Interface\n                                   | LAN / Wi-Fi\n                             Other devices\n\nYou may need to configure your TimeCapsule to make some Port Forwarding if you want to access to your NAS from outside of your network (I highly discourage that because of network security issues).\nThat all for me.\n", "Q: How can I delete photos from my iPhone and still retain them on my desktop? How can I delete photos from my iPhone and still retain them on my desktop (OS X El Capitan)? I am not sure if it is possible to delete from my iPhone once the photos are on my desktop.\n\nA: I suggest you to firstly disable My Photo Stream then sync your iPhone with your Mac library (using cable for instance).\nIn this way you can keep update the photos in your library by importing recent photos from iPhone and at the same time you can remove the pics from your iPhone without losing the copy pic in the Mac.  \n\nA: When using the iCloud Photo Library, all of your photos are synced between all of your devices.   You cannot delete on one, and keep on another...  basically, they all use the same library so they need to be in sync.\nThere are other options...  such as exporting the photos from the Photos app on the Mac, and then deleting the photos from the library all together...   but you cannot delete the photos on one device without deleting from all devices (when you are using iCloud Photo Library)\n\nA: This might not be the answer that you are looking for, but if you use the third party Google Photos app there is a feature to delete the local copy of a single photo(or group of photos) from your phone while still storing it in the cloud. Google Photos can also automatically download your cloud library to your mac's hard drive, which could help you keep them on your mac. Google Photos has drawbacks of its own, but it is a good solution to this problem.\n\nA: One suggestion I would have is to set up a shared feed (aka using the sharing button) and post any photos you want to keep to the feed, with you as the only recipient.\nYou can delete the photos off the phone -- the feed is unaffected.  The photos will come up in Photos in it's own section based  upon the name you called it.\nHowever, I'm not sure, whether photos Imported into Photos are subjected to being deleted if you delete from the phone.  As stated, Exported photos are ABSOLUTELY safe -- they are saved on your computer.\nThe only plus is, even if you mess up and do delete a photo you didn't want to -- it's a non-destructive delete -- you have 30 days to change your mind.\n\nA: If you have an iCloud account and have My Photo Stream enabled they should sync right to your iCloud. After they are synced to your iCloud, you can then transfer them throughout your computer so they will be saved to your computer directly and not your iCloud. You can then delete the ones off your phone. \n\nA: I had the same issue! My ICloud storage was full and I could not delete pictures from my iPhone or Mac without losing them completely. I figured how to clear up this issue, you have to remove your \"documents and Desktop folders\" from Icloud storage..on your Mac go to settings, iCloud,click options next to iCloud Drive, uncheck Desktop and Documents folder, this will remove everything from your desktop and in your documents folder so make sure you drag all of your important documents over to ICloud before you complete this step. Once the desktop and documents folder is removed from Icloud, drag all your important documents back to your desktop, add a \"photos\" folder to your desktop for your photos and Transfer all of your photos from your photo app on into your new \"photo\" folder. You can now delete pictures off of your iPhone and the photo app and still have them safe on your desktop. Hope this helps!!  \n", "Q: Lock Mac mini but keep secondary display running I am configuring a dashboard on a TV display to show latest sales stats, etc. and am running this off our existing build 'server', a Mac mini. The Mac mini is connected to a standard monitor and a TV using AppleTV.

I made sure this HD would and does work in Windows 10 by plugging it into another laptop I have running only Windows 10, and it worked fine there.\nWhen I plug it into my MacBook with Windows 10 running, it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shows the notification asking what I want to do with the HD, I close it.\n\n*Doesn't show a Windows Explorer popup appears with the contents of the HD.\n\n\nAfter this I go to Windows Explorer manually and try to open it.  2 things happen with this.\n\n\n*\n\n*I notice the drive is called \"Local Drive\" instead of its actual name, \"My Passport\" (named that because the drive is WD My Passport).\n\n*When I go to open the HD, it gives me an error I have never seen before, Invalid Parameters.\n\n\nWhen I first saw this I safely ejected the HD, and I got the BSOD with an error of KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE.  I guessed it was a problem with the safe eject feature, so I rebooted and ejected it without the safe eject function, and it gave me the same BSOD error.\nBefore anyone marks this as \"off-topic\", this is about Apple's drivers in Windows, not Windows itself, as the causes of the BSOD error suggest.  None of the Windows updates seem to fix it, and I seem to be unable to find any driver fixes from apple.\nUpdate: I can no longer even plug the HD into the computer, because when I plug it in it plays the little \"Device Connected\" chime, then the computer gives me the BSOD withe the same error.\n\nA: I managed to finally fix this.  All I did was reformat the External HD as the \"MS-DOS(FAT)\" filesystem through Disk Utility.\nI'm assuming it was an issue with the \"ExFAT\" filesystem, although I could plug it into 2 other Windows laptops in my house with ExFAT.\n", "Q: Time Machine preferences - time estimate wrong, progress bar doesn't show any progress When I start a backup (or when it is automatically started) I get some estimation about volume (394,2 MB of 2,58 GB) and backup time (e.g., \"5 Minutes\"). But even after hours this estimation does not change and the progress bar does not proceed.\nAny idea? Is there any way to check what really is going on between OS X and my Time Capsule?\n\nA: You can open a Terminal and run the command tmutil status or check Console to see exactly what your Time Machine is up to; you can have a look at James Pond's website for help in interpreting them.\nUnfortunately, Time Machine doesn't provide very detailed information on what it is doing, but this might give you a clue that gives you something to search for!\n", "Q: Keychain does not show passwords after El Capitan upgrade When I click on \"Show password:\" and enter password then click \"Allow\" button,\nthen my cursor just keep loading and password does not show.\n\n(source: shoespost.com)\nKeychain looks like it's frozen, only \"Deny\" button works which will close the window. Same problem with old and new saved passwords.\nThis happened two months ago after I have upgraded to OS X El Capitan.\nNew Keychain and reset did not help.\n\nA: I had the same problem when using my wacom tablet with the Keychain. When using an actual mouse the problem does not occure. I found the following post that explained this problem in detail:\n\nWith the 10.11.1 update, Apple introduced a \"security fix\" that disabled the ability for non-physical devices to interact with the Keychain. You can see the details of this \"fix\" here (scroll all the way to the bottom of the page and look for CVE-2015-5943 for a full description):\nAbout the security content of OS X El Capitan v10.11.1 and Security Update 2015-007 - Apple Support\nYou can confirm this being the issue with your machine if you view the system logs via the Console.app. When you click on \"Always Allow\", you should see the following in the logs:\n\nIgnoring user action since the dialog has received events from an untrusted source\n\n\nBasically, your click is being registered as a \"synthetic click\". In my case, this was because I was using Apple Remote Desktop (I also tested various other remote apps I use, like TeamViewer and iTeleport Connect, and all resulted in the same error in the logs).\n\nSo a solution to this problem is to use a physical mouse to interact with the Keychain.\n", "Q: Battery life of iPhone 4 reduced dramatically since iOS 7 Since I updated my iPhone 4 to iOS 7 (11A465), the battery began to drain really quickly, though the Bluetooth, GPS and the LTE are closed most of the time.\nIt makes me wonder whether there are operating system versions that are more economical with the battery usage.\n\nA: There of course are more power efficient operating systems for a couple of reasons.\n\n\n*\n\n*Some operating systems take alot of space for themselves to actually run the system\n\n*Apps might not always be turned off but suspended, leaving them running\n\n\nAnd one of the major battery eaters (not because of OS) is the screen. Turning down the brightness to half-way from full can save about 2-3 hours of battery (sometimes more).\nA good solution to the background app problem is exiting the apps by pressing the home button twice. You will see the apps you have active. You can swipe up to exit the apps, and home button or tap on an app to go back to it. However that no longer works.\n\nQuitting apps is not the way to do it. The old 'slide it off the screen' does nothing whatsoever unless an app is hung etc. Backgrounded apps set to no refresh was the replacement for that old voodoo, since iOS 7\n\n-Tetsujin\nBasically, that solution used to be a thing, but now background apps do not seem to be the issue at all anymore.\n\nJust as some extra information, Androids have custome ROMs (OS) that attempt on being more lightweight operating system clones of android. However custom ROMs have yet to exist on Apple phones\n\nSudden battery drain is also not only a software problem, but it could be a hardware problem too. To maintain battery health, make sure to charge with your native adapter (not other ones for different phones), as sometimes they have higher voltage, therefore harming the battery. If suspending apps does not resolve your battery problem, you might want to bring your phone for a battery checkup just in case.\n\nAnd finally, to answer your question with battery packs, there are some good ones. You can get ones in a separate \"power bank\", where you connect your phone and charge, or you can get ones that are built-in to the iPhone case, like in the example below:\n\nOf course, there are also iPhone 4 cases, not just iPhone 6 ones.\n", "Q: Do I really need one of those TAX IDS: SSN, ITIN, EIN?

I was about to try to disable SSDP service, which seemed to be the cause of lag of few of my friends, but I just don’t know how to, since its Mac.\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nA: I had a problem that presented very similarly to yours: excellent ping over wifi, except that every 6 seconds or so it would spike up to 100-200 ms. This was true regardless of the wifi network I was on, or the router hardware. I had no issue when connected via ethernet.\nMy problem ended up being related to a program which was regularly scanning for wifi networks. I found I could reliably cause my ping to increase in that same way by clicking on the wifi notification icon, which causes the OS to scan for new networks.\nI looked in my wifi log (/var/log/wifi.log) and found entries like the following:\nTue Sep 12 11:38:59.570 <airportd[75]> WARNING: Google Chrome (412) is not entitled for com.apple.wifi.scan, temporarily allowing request with background priority —— all entitlement requirements will be strictly enforced in a future release\nTue Sep 12 11:39:04.984 <airportd[75]> WARNING: jtmc (109) is not entitled for com.apple.wifi.scan, temporarily allowing request with background priority —— all entitlement requirements will be strictly enforced in a future release\n\nThe application 'jtmc' (a diagnostic app for the Jive phone system) turned out to be the culprit. After closing it and removing it from my login items, pings went back to consistent 1-2ms to the router.\n\nA: I had the same problem. The random latency ping spikes occurred when wifi was scanning for access points. It's even worse when many access points are in the neighbourhood.\nThe scanning happens when you click on the wifi icon to show the list of available access points, but this also happens when your location services tries to determine your location.\nGo to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Location Services and disable all apps that wan't to use the location services.\nThat's it.\n", "Q: Skype with both system and microphone audio in El Capitan I'm trying to use Skype for screen sharing with simultaneous audio from my microphone and the Mac system (for example a video or a game). \nUsing Soundflower, and in the Audio Midi Setup an Aggregate Device for input and a Multi-Output Device for output I've been able to get either Mac system audio or microphone (voice), but not both. \nIn some settings, both seem to be input, but only the system audio is output, or just a very quick bit of voice can be heard before cutting out.\nI'm stumped...\nHere are the Skype audio settings:\n\nAnd here are the Mac settings:\nFirst, Audio Midi Setup\n\n\nAnd Sound from System Preferences\n\n\nI have found some videos on YouTube that discuss this, like this one which I've followed, but still no luck. \nThanks.

I use my iPhone to take photos and video, then import them onto my Macbook using the new Photos app. \nNow I'm trying to find the original videos so I can put them on an external hard drive for a friend to edit. I notice that within the Photos app, if I control-click on my videos, there is no \"Reveal in Finder\" option. If I do \"Get Info\" and look at the filename, it says IMG_6517.MOV.

When I have ⌥ Option-⇥ Tabed away from it for working in another application, it will steal focus as soon as it has finished drawing its browser window. Instead of letting me decide to ⌥ Option-⇥ Tab back to it at my own free will, it hijacks the process and interrupts any work I am doing.\nI think this is an extremely annoying and intrusive behaviour and I would like to stop it. I do not want Google Chrome to always open in the background. It should just behave like any other app and not interfere with the choice I make by ⌥ Option-⇥ Tabbing to another application.\nI can replicate the focus stealing behaviour of Google Chrome in yet another way. When issuing the open command on the Terminal, the -g flag is supposed to tell the application to open in the background:\nopen -g /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/\n\nYet again, Google Chrome does not honour this choice. It begins opening in the background all right, but it steals focus as soon as it has finished drawing its browser window. Compare this to the normal behaviour of any other application:\nopen -g /Applications/Firefox.app/\n\nThis does exactly what it is supposed to do: The application opens in the background and stays in the background until I choose to ⌥ Option-⇥ Tab to it.

Only when I click Deny does the prompt seem to take on board what my choice is.  After I click Deny, the popup disappears, but always pops up once more, and only stays away if I click Deny again, as shown in the clip.\nIt's really distracting and irritating, especially given that I really do want SourceTree to be able to access that login information (SourceTree was the original program I inputted my login information for Github).\n\nA: I've received the answer to my problem from finchr's post at https://discussions.apple.com/message/29270520#29270520,\n\nIn my case the problem was with MagicPrefs, a utility that lets you define additional mouse and trackpad gestures.

I frequently program for Mathematica, and on my old 2007 MacBook Pro I usually got a feeling for inefficient code when it runs sluggishly (that's when I decide \"gee, I wrote some garbage code.  Maybe I should spend a couple hours fine-tuning it\").  However, on my new Mac, everything just runs zippy fast.  \nIs there a switch on the Mac that lets me slow down the CPU to, say, 1 GHz?\n\nA: If your concern is how efficient your software is, let me suggest a more engineering-oriented solution that will let you keep your MacBook running at full speed:\nUse the profiler built into Mathematica.  This will let you identify the parts of your computations that consume the most time without having to resort to seat-of-the-pants measurements that only work on slow hardware.\n\nA: I do not think it is possible to manipulate the minimum clock speed bar, simply because of the direct relation between power, frequency and the clock speed of a micro processor. Obviously the clock has a range, so for example for running simulations the system takes more power to run faster under the range, and then when you stop simulating you see the drop. \nA Solution: Alternatively did you consider, running the programs within MAC OS but on an virtualizer (e.g., virtual box)? You can then limit the number of cores/RAM dedicating to running the second OS. In that case, the programs can forced to be run much slower; because the virtualizer has much lower resource. This will give you much more flexibility and in case of a failure, you can go back and change the virtualizer settings. More interestingly, you can bring the packaged settings that run on the virtualizer to another machine and run it there as well, by having the virtualizer there of course. \n\nA: Unfortunately, no. You can't alter the clock speed on Macintosh computers. They don't have a BIOS in the same way that Windows motherboards do, so there's no way the user can change the clock speed or fiddle with I/O stuff.\nThe reason for this is mostly because on a Mac, you don't need to manually change these things. The hardware is already pre-built and the OS knows what hardware it will/can be attached to.\n\nA: Profiling, as suggested in Blrfl's answer, is the more appropriate way to identify whether or not your Mathematica code is efficient. However if you really want to slow down its execution, you may be able to do this by changing the priority of the Mathematica process. I haven't tried this but you may find helpful information or software among these links:\nIs there any way to set the priority of a process in Mac OS X?\nHow to permanently “renice” a process on Mac OS X (or iOS, etc)?\nAppriority (formerly Renicer) by Northern Softworks\nSome of those discussions are a bit old though, so you may need to experiment or search further to find what works on your Mac and OS X version. Also you may find the technique works more effectively if you set your Mac some other heavy processing task to run at the same time - converting a big video file, say.\n\nA: Yes, but it's not advised.  The clock speed is controlled by the OS and the processor itself due to a number of factors, including processor load, temperature, and power availability.\nIf you reduce the battery to 10-20%, disconnect any external power source, and heat the laptop up to its maximum operating temperature, 95F (35C), it will certainly enter a lower power state, including reducing the processor clock significantly. A small heating pad, such as those used for back pain, below the laptop may be sufficient, and during the winter may be very comfortable for you.\nHowever, it would be better to use the correct tools for performance tuning. Yes, you can simulate your old environment and thereby use your own internal clock, however the software you're using has clocks, timers, and other tools to understand the performance of your work.  Given that you may likely upgrade again in several years, or you may use different computers and computing platforms in the intervening time, using crutches like emulators isn't a good long-term solution.\nI suggest you instead make use of the built in tools.  Regular use will allow you to use them without too much additional effort, so that you can integrate them into your software on the fly.\n", "Q: How can I safely backup and remove Photos from MacBook (El Capitan)?

The logging system is capable of logging thousands of messages a second so ignoring the messages isn't going to do much but make that one file easier to look at. You might need to contact the vendor to get the application changed, but hopefully hiding the messages works for your needs since that's something you should be able to do easily.\n", "Q: USB Ethernet adapter not populating in settings To say that it isn't being detected seems incorrect.\n$ ioreg -p IOUSB -l -w 0\n...\n+-o USB 10/100 LAN@14200000  <class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x10000ee80, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (13 ms), retain 11>\n  |     {\n  |       \"sessionID\" = 176409708174141\n  |       \"iManufacturer\" = 1\n  |       \"bNumConfigurations\" = 2\n  |       \"idProduct\" = 33106\n  |       \"bcdDevice\" = 8192\n  |       \"Bus Power Available\" = 500\n  |       \"USB Address\" = 11\n  |       \"bMaxPacketSize0\" = 64\n  |       \"iProduct\" = 2\n  |       \"iSerialNumber\" = 3\n  |       \"bDeviceClass\" = 0\n  |       \"Built-In\" = No\n  |       \"locationID\" = 337641472\n  |       \"bDeviceSubClass\" = 0\n  |       \"bcdUSB\" = 528\n  |       \"USB Product Name\" = \"USB 10/100 LAN\"\n  |       \"PortNum\" = 2\n  |       \"non-removable\" = \"no\"\n  |       \"IOCFPlugInTypes\" = {\"9dc7b780-9ec0-11d4-a54f-000a27052861\"=\"IOUSBFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/IOUSBLib.bundle\"}\n  |       \"bDeviceProtocol\" = 0\n  |       \"IOUserClientClass\" = \"IOUSBDeviceUserClientV2\"\n  |       \"IOPowerManagement\" = {\"DevicePowerState\"=0,\"CurrentPowerState\"=3,\"CapabilityFlags\"=65536,\"MaxPowerState\"=4,\"DriverPowerState\"=3}\n  |       \"Device Speed\" = 2\n  |       \"USB Vendor Name\" = \"Realtek\"\n  |       \"idVendor\" = 3034\n  |       \"IOGeneralInterest\" = \"IOCommand is not serializable\"\n  |       \"USB Serial Number\" = \"84E714001EAD\"\n  |       \"IOClassNameOverride\" = \"IOUSBDevice\"\n  |     }\n\nBut, see screenshots below:\n\n\nI have no options to configure/use the device.\nIt is made by c2g\n\nc2g.com/uk/product/81672/usb-2.0-to-fast-ethernet-adapter\n\nA: You are probably missing a driver for the device. One is available here: USB 2.0 To Fast Ethernet Adapter -> Support. I don't know if it works though because the driver is very old (2008)!\n\nA: It appears to be a compatibility with el capitan. rolling back to yosemite I was able to use it, plug and play, no issues at all.\n", "Q: Changing corporate password From time to time my company requires me to change my password. We are mostly a PC based organization and everything revolves around Windows logon. \nThere are a few Mac users that are on their own. Macs can log in to various shared network drives, mail servers and LAN applications. But all of this just uses keychain. \nEverytime I'm required to change my password, updating everything on the Mac is a nightmare. There are always some hidden processes that retain older passwords and attempt to use them, resulting in corporate IT locking my account. \nI'm at a loss. Changing every entry in keychain still leaves old passwords somewhere and I don't know how to completely flush them out. I tried WireShark but couldn't find anything. \nWhat do people do about this to avoid being locked out?\n\nA: I've moved most of my password storage to 1Password app so that I don't need to mind the keychain when it makes more than one copy of a password. the benefit of that is I can have my passwords synced to iOS (and other OS) as well as save them periodically to a USB drive for disaster recovery.\nKeychain doesn't do any of these as well as a tool made for managing passwords. As a bonus, I end up making much more secure passwords programmatically rather than typing them by hand.\n\nA: I deleted all entries and then the keychain itself. This worked.\n", "Q: Permissions corrupted in OS X I have run sudo chown -R Ankur / by mistake and now some apps are not opening and there icons are also not visible. How can I fix this?\nHere are some snapshots:\n\n\n\n\nA: Short term, you can turn off Gatekeeper to allow the application you corrupted to run. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open system preferences\n\n*Select Security & Privacy\n\n*Select general\n\n*Select Anywhere\nThe system should have protected most of the command line tools, but I would see if you can make one last back up of the system and then restore the OS if applications installed by the system are messed up.\nSpecifically, my Macbook has 60 million files - so had I run that command, I would have a lot of work to do to ensure everything is correct and staring with deleting all apps I can easily reinstall and then reinstalling the system if I broke any system apps is far shorter a path to recovery.\nLuckily - all your personal files were already owned by your user, so this exercise in recovery will be to get copied of apps that are not unique to your system and at worst, you'll need to delete preference and configuration files and re-create them if they need permissions different than what you enforced on your system.\n", "Q: Where can I see the installed profiles in iOS9 Where is Settings > General > Profile in iOS 9?\nI was part of a testing-team for an iOS app and using testflight. Back then, under iOS 6, I had to install a profile on my iPhone. Now, years later, I am again helping out to test with testflight, and I am having problems with certificates. I just wanted to check which profiles are installed on my iPhone, however, the Settings > General > Profile menu is not here any more under iOS 9.\nHow can I see the profiles that are installed?\n\nA: You don't see a profile entry until the first one is saved. It's listed when it shows up immediately below the VPN entry, so be sure you scroll the content up so that VPN and below are visible.\nOther than that, you can tap through each profile and see details about what entitlements it controls and how it's authenticated and/or cryptographically singed in the same manner as before.\n", "Q: Move hard drive from macbook pro to macbook air I have a Macbook Pro with a 250 GB SSD hard drive (Macbook retina Mid 2012 i7) and a Macbook air with 120 GB SSD hard drive (Mid 2012 Intel Core i5).\nI would like to move the swap the hard drives if the hardware is compatible.\nIs this possible? Is it just a matter of opening the machines and swapping the hard drives?\n\nA: As far as I can see both MacBook's using different SSD's.

It does not recognize the USB as bootable. I tried with USB 2.0 as well as 3.0 with no change.\nWhen I hold down the option key while rebooting, it shows the USB as \"EFI Boot\" but clicking on it leads to the same error message.\nAny idea why this happens/how I can fix it?\n\nA: You can not use a USB flash drive to install Windows on a 2010 iMac. You need to use a DVD. You can install without a DVD or flash drive, but the procedure is difficult and requires installing third party software.\nThere are two methods to boot software on your Mac. The older (legacy) method uses the BIOS firmware and the newer method uses the EFI firmware. OS X and many Linux operating systems can be installed to boot using the EFI firmware. Many have attempted to install Windows to boot using the EFI, but doing so in my option is rather pointless. To get all of the device drivers to work properly, you need to install the proper \"Boot Camp Support Software\". This software assumes you have installed Windows to boot using the BIOS method.\nIt is my understanding the newer Macs do install Windows to boot using the EFI. All the 2010 models were not designed to do so. Also, the 2010 models were required to install Windows using a DVD. Apple changed the firmware to allow USB Windows installs around 2012, when they stopped putting DVD drives in Macs. To my knowledge no firmware upgrades were ever released to allow USB installs on 2011 or older Macs.\nIn the case, where you no longer have a working DVD drive, you can still install Windows directly from the ISO file. This requires installing a free copy of VirtualBox. This product can be used to prepare a partition for the installation of Windows. Once Windows is installed, you can remove VirtualBox, but since it requires very little disk space, you are better off just leaving a copy on your Mac.\nInstructions to install Windows 7 without DVD (Optical) drive or USB flash drive\nThe procedure can be found at the link below.\nInstalling Windows 7 Pro 64 bit without DVD or Flash Drive\n"]
