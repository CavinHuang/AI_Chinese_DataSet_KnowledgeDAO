["Q: iOS 11 autocorrect bug typing the letter capital I So for some odd reason it seems that some iPhones are having trouble processing the letter \"I\" and I was wondering if anyone knows the solution to this or if it's just a bug in iOS 11?\non some iOS 10 and iOS 11 devices, a question mark shows up or another symbol where they should be an I. Examples:\n \n\n\n\nA: This is described by Apple:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208240\nI think this must be a bug in the system for suggesting emoji in Predictive Text.

Google Drive recently became Google Backup and Sync, and this dialog started occasionally popping out of its menu bar item:\n\nI don't have a \"Boot OS X\" folder that I'm aware of, in Google Drive or locally. When I look at the settings for Google Backup and Sync, I don't see anything about this. I haven't touched the settings since it was Google Drive, so it's set to sync my Google Drive and nothing more.\nI can't tell what the files are from the little generic icons, and I can't figure out how to get a list. It's also not clear what device it's talking about, or what choice it's going to remember (since the options are essentially \"yes\" or \"later\").\nDoes anyone know what this dialog is about and what I might have done to cause it?\n\nA: Yes, you can have no \"Boot OS X\" folder now, but if you backup these files to cloud, there will be such a folder containing these files.\nThe most probably cause of this dialog is due to the update from old Google Drive to new Backup and Sync changed your source settings automatically though you didn't do by yourself. Thus, better check out your current settings to find out. If it is what i guess, then uncheck the related source folder will terminate such dialog.\nBest wishes!\n\nA: If you have an encrypted Time Machine backup disk, there is a hidden Boot OS X partition located on it that contains a recovery OS, allowing you to decrypt and boot from the backup in case you need to restore it from scratch. You can see this partition if you run diskutil list from the command line:\n/dev/disk3 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *4.0 TB     disk3\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk3s1\n   2:          Apple_CoreStorage Time Machine            4.0 TB     disk3s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk3s3\n\nTime Machine will occasionally mount this partition while making a backup.

However, the keyboard shortcut to make this happen just suddenly stopped working properly in Google Chrome.\n\nNormally, you just select some text with your mouse, then press the keyboard shortcut (which I have set to Option + Tab), and then the computer voice reads the selected text to you. \nThis keyboard shortcut still works in other applications like Finder and Firefox, but when I do so in Chrome it doesn't read the selected text - instead, it reads the <title>Web Page's Name</title> and that's it. \n\nIf I highlight the text, right click → Speech → Start Speaking, then it'll work like normal and read the text aloud. \n\nSo if that works, then why can't I use the keyboard shortcut to use text to speech anymore?\n\nA: Upgrade/Reinstall Operating System\nI recently installed MacOS Mojave and now the \"Text to Speech\" function works perfectly, just like it used to. \nWhile this didn't identify what was causing the problem, it did solve it.\n\nA: I have struggled with this problem for a long time but I have found the solution/problem. The text to speech function only doesn't work properly when the window isn't in fullscreen. If you click the little green dot and the left hand corner of the window you'll put the window into fullscreen mode. If the little yellow dot is not greyed out This means you are not in fullscreen mode. Looking at your screenshots It doesn't look like you're in full screen mode as the little yellow dot isn't greyed out. \nI appreciate this is not the correct place to post this, But if you rely on this function as i do this information could be life-changing.  \n", "Q: how to make different apps use wifi vs ethernet? I'd like to route some apps through WiFi and other apps through ethernet.  Given that OSX has a wide array of system tools and utilities as well as a rich ecosphere of apps, how can I make that happen?*\n\nA: \nI'd like to route some apps through WiFi and other apps through\n  ethernet.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the way it (networking) works.  You can't say that you want Safari to go through one network port and iTunes to come through another.  The problem with this lies in the fact the applications themselves don't make the network connection - it makes a call to the networking (Berkeley sockets) API that makes the connection and binds the process to the socket itself.\nIn the simplest terms, the flow looks like this\n\nWhen your local process (the application in question) wants to make a connection, it requests that a socket be created.  Part of that request includes the IP address, the connection is then made, and the app is bound to it.  The app then sends and receives data through that socket.\nThe key to remember here is that the application asks for a socket based on the network address.  Other than (assuming you're on a network with a single segment), you have only two routes:\n\n\n*\n\n*your local network\n\n*everything else (i.e. Internet)\n\n\nIf you have two interfaces connected to this single network, your routes will overlap and the interface with priority will be the primary.\nWhatever your application running, it's going to say, \"I want to go to foo.bar.com\" which will translate to an IP address and a socket will be created over the route that gets you there.  The point is, your app has no control over the matter.\nHowever, let's say you're connected to two different networks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ethernet (en0) -> 1.2.3.0\n\n*WiFi (en1)     -> 5.6.7.0\nIf there is a file server with an IP of 1.2.3.4, all traffic bound for that address will go through the Ethernet.  If your WiFi is configured for Internet access, all calls to 1.2.3.0 and every other address will go through en1.  Again, your app has no say in the matter and the socket will be made based on destination.\nCan an application use a specific network interfcace?\nYes, of course it can, but this is something done at the source level of the application because it's the one making the call to the API.  If you code it to use a specific interface, it will do so (it's not practical in any sense, but you have the ability).\nBottom line:  For an external application to re-route traffic based on the application you use, it would have to insert itself between the application and the protocol stack of the OS and that is just not going to happen.\n\nA: It depends on what apps we're talking about and what exactly you want to achieve. In some cases you can get by by using pf and policy-based routing (source routing) based on the source port or destination ports of your apps. However this is normally only possible with apps that are \"simple\" network wise (i.e. for example only connects to a single serveR).\nA generic solution does not seem to exist yet in a neatly packaged form you can just download and use without special expertise.\nIf you want to implement such a solution, you will want to use the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable when launching your apps to inject your own shared library into the process. That shared library should then override the bind() call to make sure that the process binds to the IP of either your WiFi or Ethernet interface depending on the app.\n\nA: The closest thing i can think of for this is called packet prioritization (so apps would not be on the same Ethernet connection interfering with each other)it is available in the motherboard \"Fatal1ty Z370 Professional Gaming i7\" but it is a $200 board and it is a hardware solution, I do not believe there is a software capable of this but i could be wrong i hope this helped.\n", "Q: Replaced CPU with i7, now 1 LED blinking I replaced the Core i5 2.7 GHz CPU in my iMac 27-inch (mid 2011) my with an i7 2600.\nOn boot I got a blinking single LED on LED1. Reading up that normally means insufficient power. The main fan would spin cycle up and down.\nI put the i5 back in and it boots fine. Things I'm not sure about:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm assuming the CPU is good, but can't be 100% sure\n\n*I didn't put the RAM back in when I tested the i7, but normally you'd get a long tone.\n\n\nAnything else I can try? I'll have another go when I've got more time and double check I've seated all the cable correctly etc.\nBig shame if it doesn't work - I was looking forward to the upgrade!\n\nA: Ok - so I took it all apart again. Reseated the i7 CPU and it all booted fine. \nRuns like a champ! Awesome upgrade :-)\n", "Q: Way to load an old windows hard drive in boot camp? I had a windows laptop that bit the dust, but the hard drive works fine (booted up in another pc that wasn't mine as an external disk with my SATA to USB 3 adapter).\nI'd like to use this drive on my iMac (2011 27 inch) without reformatting it and without having to go out and buy a new windows license key. Is there a way I could use the existing and functional license in boot camp, or better yet boot the OS from the drive?\n\nA: Windows licenses, unlike Mac, do not belong to the person but to the machine. They are not transferrable between machines.\nSometimes just changing a hard drive or graphics card would be enough to trigger the 'you appear to be using a different computer' warning, needing you to ring Microsoft to re-authorise.\nSo, aside from any actual surmountable issues of persuading Windows to run from an external drive [which only Windows 10 will do, iirc] or setting up a fresh Boot Camp partition then making a bare-metal backup/restore to it using Acronis [the only software I know of that can move a Windows install between different physical hardware & still have it arrive in a bootable state] - once it arrives it will not be licensed.\nYou could, I suppose, at that point buy a new license.\n\nA: With the 2011 iMac, you can not boot Windows from an external drive. Generally, this is true for any Mac that was shipped with a built-in optical drive.\nWinclone is a software package you can run under macOs to transfer Windows from an external disk to the internal disk. You have to pay for this software, but the vendor does offer to refund your money if the transfer fails.\n", "Q: iOS 11 and GPS accuracy on iPhone (6+) GPS on my iPhone 6+ has always been accurate. Amazingly accurate. Most of the time, it took only a few seconds to pinpoint my location on any app using GPS, Apple Maps, Google Maps... This has been the case for almost 3 years.\nUpdate to iOS 11, then up to iOS 11.2.1\nAfter the update to iOS 11 / 11.2, GPS is never accurate. The best it can get to is an approximate location of a radius of 20 meters. And often, the actual location is even outside that circular area. Whatever the app, same problem.\nTried to go in a very opened area, with no building, no trees... on a very blue sky day. Waited for minutes in Maps... same problem.\nTried the common fixes found everywhere on the Net\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset Network Settings (after each update, then have to enter all wifi passwords again)\n\n*Reset Location & Privacy\n\n*Location Services ON/OFF\n\n*Reboot ... several times\n\n*All apps have been updated to the last version (eg Google Maps)\n\n*Airplane mode ON/OFF ... \n\n*and of course, tried with wifi ON and OFF\n\n\nNothing has improved in the GPS department...\n(Unfortunately cannot restore to iOS 10 since I don't have a fresh backup of before the update)\nIs this a known issue for some iPhones (namely the 6 family)?\nAny other advice welcome.\nedit \nNo improvement with 11.1.2\nNov 28 update\nAs of today, everyone I know who has an iPhone 6+ on iOS 11+ and use GPS a lot has this problem. Did an app to calculate the best accuracy the device might have within 30 minutes, under a clear sky, out of town - GPS is always erratic, inaccurate. It's definitely an iOS / firmware issue.\nWent to Apple store and talked an hour with the manager, explaining the problem etc... Basically answers were\n\n  \n*\n  \n*there is nothing to do - your phone is defective and has to replaced with a new/used one [buy a new [678]+, or an X]  ...\n  \n\nDec 22 update\nIt seems the reason to this sudden trouble could well be due to Apple slows down iPhones as they get older. GPS is a complex mechanism, and forcing the CPU (and other components) to act differently, to slow down, and probably get less power, could have an effect on the GPS chip and behavior.\n\nA: Try updating to iOS 12. This should hopefully provide a fix for it. Also when you try to get your location try to wait a bit as accuracy improves over time. Make sure that you've set the date, time, and time zone correctly on the device in Settings > General > Date & Time. If possible, use Set Automatically.\n\nGPS accuracy depends on the number of visible GPS satellites. Locating\n  all visible satellites can take several minutes, with accuracy\n  gradually increasing over time. To improve GPS accuracy:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Make sure that you've set the date, time, and time zone correctly on the device in Settings > General > Date & Time. If possible, use Set\n  Automatically.\n  \n*Keep a clear view in several directions. Walls, vehicle roofs, tall buildings, mountains, and other obstructions can block line of sight\n  to GPS satellites. When this happens, your device uses Wi-Fi or\n  cellular networks to determine your position until the GPS satellites\n  are visible again.\n\n(Source)\n", "Q: Can you recover a deleted message or chain of messages from iPhone? I see all of these software that claim that they can recover messages deleted from your iPhone. Do they actually work? \nFor example, if I received 2 text messages from my friend and I immediately deleted them. Is it possible to recover them? \n\nA: If you have done an iCloud backup before those messages have been deleted then you can bring them back from iCloud backup with a restore from iCloud.\n\nA: Actually, there's a matter of fact you should not ignore: all the deleted messages will soon be overwritten randomly to make room for the new coming ones. If you really want to recover deleted messages from iPhone without backup, before you use any third party recovery software, you should turn on Airplane mode immediately to stop deleted messages getting overwritten.\nBy now some of those data recovery software do have an ability to recover deleted messages, but they can't be certain that their software can recover all your deleted messages. Some of them are free for try, like Gihosoft iPhone Recovery, which you can test by yourself.

Does iPhone X support Display Zoom like the iPhone devices before it that are larger than the iPhone SE?\n\nA: No\n\nNot yet. It’s a whole new UI so my guess is that has to be redone at the second scale still. Dynamic text is there and improved, though. https://twitter.com/roelvangils/status/925696251651330050\n\nhttps://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/925709868425793542\nThat makes sense to me because if a developer wants to support iPhone 6 sizes and larger then they already should have support for iPhone SE which is used when Display Zoom is turned on on an iPhone 6. There is no smaller version of the iPhone X with its notch and rounded corners, thus no Display Zoom. Next year we might have display zoom on iPhone X Plus. \n\nA: Updated 2020-09-18: YES, it does as of iOS 14 beta 3 (which also means iOS 14.0 and later). And it looks like apps should be updated to support that, otherwise top and bottom of the screen are not used (eg. in Twitter app).\nEarlier: A quick and dirty update after the release of iPhone XS [Max] / XR: looks like Zoomed View will be supported on XS Max and XR, but not on X nor XS.\nPlease feel free to update with more details as they emerge.\n\nA: It is not (yet) supported and there is a good reason. \nAn iPhone 6 in Zoom mode has a screen just like an iPhone 5. \nAn iPhone 6+ in Zoom mode has a screen just like an iPhone 6. \nAn iPhone X in Zoom mode would be another new screen size, with a new size of the notch. (The notch would physically be the same size, but because of zoom mode it would be fewer pixels). \nAt the moment there are still many apps that support the iPhone X, but in a slightly hacked way: If the developer didn't want to switch to a newer SDK, they could check the size of the phone, and if it is iPhone X sized then the developer assumes it has an iPhone X sized notch and an iPhone X sized area for the home button at the bottom. \nThese developers wouldn't think of supporting iPhone X in zoom mode, so things wouldn't work. Another problem is that as long as an app runs fine on iPhone 5, it will run fine on iPhone 6 in zoom mode, so I can test on an iPhone 5 which I need to test anyway. To test iPhone X in zoom mode, I have to switch zoom mode on which is a pain because it restarts all apps. \n", "Q: Viewer for HEIF/HEIC images in El Capitan or Sierra Is there any \"native way\" to view the new HEIF/HEIC format (or the viewer-application) in El Capitan or Sierra without upgrade of MacOS itself? It is not yet possible to upgrade yet to HighSierra for me, but I'd like to natively view images from iPhone 8 and up generation, avoiding conversions to JPG.\nThere been questions asked about convertors of .heic to .jpg, but I don't think it's reasonable to convert images (via the means of online convertors, specialized apps, Dropbox, etc.). Soon or later .heic support will become normal, and all the online services and applications will finish the transition, so obviously there will be no need to convert to JPG. \nThe question: Is there any way to install some kind of plugin or extension to MacOS to support HEIF/HEIC within the Preview App, or it may be there are good applications alike XnView or analogues, which support it out of the box?\n\nA: The current version of Graphic Converter (from https://www.lemkesoft.de, free trial available) supports HEIC format.  I did not try it in Sierra or El Capitan, but the description says: MacOS 10.9 or later.\n\nA: The current version of GIMP supports the HEIC format. You can download it from here.

This is to avoid hearing the startup chime really loudly the next time I start the machine.\nUsing the instructions provided in this post, I have created a RunAtLoad launch agent that calls the script shown below:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nset -o errexit\nset -o nounset\nset -o pipefail\n\nIFS=$'\\n\\t'\n\nonLogout ()\n{\n    osascript -e \"set volume output volume 0\"\n    exit\n}\n\ntrap onLogout SIGINT SIGHUP SIGTERM\n\nwhile true; do\n    say starting\n    sleep 86400 &\n    wait $!\ndone\n\nThe idea being that the script is called and made to sleep until it receives one of the trapped signals, at which point the onLogout function is called in order to mute the volume.\nCurrently it's not working as intended, the volume remains unchanged when I log out and log back in. However, I've found that if I manually unload the launch agent that launches the script (using a launchctl unload call), then it works perfectly. The system volume is muted immediately.\nInitially I thought perhaps the trapped signals weren't being received by the script when I performed a logout. But after adding some debugging code to the onLogout function as shown below, I have eliminated this as a possible cause. \nonLogout ()\n{\n    printf \"Before mute\\n\" >> ~/Desktop/log.txt\n    osascript -e \"set volume output volume 0\"\n    printf \"After mute\\n\" >> ~/Desktop/log.txt\n    exit\n}\n\nWhen I performed a logout, and logged back in, there was a \"log.txt\" file on the desktop with both of the Before mute and After mute debugging lines present.\nAnd I don't believe the reason is that the osascript call for performing the muting is somehow failing when a logout is carried out. Due to the set -o errexit line in the script, if any part of the script fails, then it should halt execution and exit immediately. This means that if the muting operation is failing, I shouldn't be seeing the After muting line in my log file. Indeed, when I tested this by replacing the osascript line with something I knew was guaranteed to fail, the log contained only the Before muting line as expected.\nI'm at a loss to explain what's going on. Clearly the onLogout function is being called correctly as explained above, but for some reason the osascript call seems to only run when I manually unload using launchctl. When I log out manually it just skips over it somehow.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: In Terminal, execute the following command to disable the chime completely until reenabled:\nsudo nvram SystemAudioVolume=%80\nIf this setting is not retained, try:\nsudo nvram SystemAudioVolume=%01\nsudo nvram SystemAudioVolume=%00\nor\nsudo nvram SystemAudioVolume=\"  \"\nTo reenable the chime:\nsudo nvram -d SystemAudioVolume\nInfo gleaned from:\nhttps://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-silence-the-startup-chime-on-a-mac--cms-21212\nhttps://www.howtogeek.com/260693/how-to-disable-the-boot-sound-or-startup-chime-on-a-mac/\n", "Q: How to ssh and remotely manage GUIs on my iMac with Remote Login/Management? I am having trouble being able to fully control my computer remotely. By fully, I mean being able to {manage files, access the terminal, access GUI, login} all while not allowing a local user to take over.\nI need to be able to control the screen, to run an installer program, for instance. The problem that I'm having with screen sharing and remote desktop is that the local user can see me log in then take control with the mouse. Then they are logged into my administrative account. They also cannot use their account while I'm logged into mine. How do I avoid this?\nAnother problem I am having is that while the remote computer can be accessed via a public ip and it is listed in Finder on the LAN, there doesn't appear to be a way to simply find the computer remotely via iCloud. Remote login is an example program that does this. Even if I kept track of where the computer was plugged in to the internet, the ip may change. Is there a way to find the computer based on the account instead of the network address?\n\nIn summary, I want to:\n1. Be able to run a GUI installer safely isolated from local users.\n2. Be able to ssh into the admin account safely isolated from local users.\n3. Be able to locate my computer to connect as dependably as \"Find my Mac\" does, using something dependable like my iCloud account instead of a network address that may change.\n\nA: Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) has a Curtains mode that blocks the local user from seeing what's happening on the screen. It may meet your needs.https://www.apple.com/remotedesktop/remoteassistance.html\n\nA: Instead of the proposed methods, you can log in while another user is logged in and start a new session instead of sharing the screen. This will not be visible or accessible to the local user. Use vnc://<mac name or ip> from the Connect window in Finder to connect to the system. I’m not sure if I can permanently upload an image, but the dialog shown will be asking you if you want to share the other user’s session or login to a new one as yourself. This only works if the local user is not the same as the user you are trying to login to.\n\nThis works much like fast user switching, but instead of switching accounts locally, you can use them concurrently, locally and remotely! This also means that you could walk up to the computer and log out the current user or return to the login window and you will see yourself listed as currently logged in. This also allows you to locally take over your remote session if you wanted to.\nRemote Access outside of the network\nIf you need remote access from outside of the network, it's a different deal. And if you don't know the address either, it's a problem too. The functionality you are proposing is usually used in business networks where there is a local administrative system in place. If you only have a single system somewhere remote (i.e. a single Mac somewhere in a house), you might be able to deal with it using iCloud, with the \"Back to my Mac\" feature. Another way would be port forwarding the VNC connection, but that leave a huge security hole, and is not recommended. You can also use SSH tunnels, meaning you only have to leave open the SSH port, and then in the command line you simply forward the remote VPN port over that secure connection, like this:\nssh user@mac-somewhere-else -L1234:localhost:5900\n\nThen, while you leave that open in the terminal, you use vnc://localhost:1234 in the Finder's Connect To dialog (Command-K) and this will use the SSH tunnel to the other Mac.\nHowever, if you are targeting many remote machines or mobile machines or systems that you cannot access directly, you will need a special agent installed that uses NAT traversal via a third party service. Previously mentioned tools do this, i.e. LogMeIn, TeamViewer and similar types. \nIf you have multiple remote networks to access regularly, consider using VPN connections. This allows you to connect to the network remotely and access the resources within. \nA third alternative for accessing remote networks is using a jump box or bastion host. It could be a simple Mac Mini that has a static IP address and SSH (or maybe even VPN) and you first log in to that and tunnel VNC to it. Next, on that Mac, you use the Finder's sidebar to automatically discover all the other systems in the network.\nTo have a better set of options to solve this, we will need more information on the use cases and what networks etc. you actually want to connect to.\n\nA: Answering your questions in order....\n\n\n*\n\n*Unless you are willing to pay for a premium application like ARD or LogMeIn, you won't get those features.\n\n\nAs mentioned in another answer ARD has \"Curtain Mode\" - \n\nFor those times when you want your actions to be hidden from the end\n  user, there’s Curtain Mode. This allows you to block the view with a\n  virtual curtain, while retaining full control of the screen. It’s\n  perfect for those working on public‑facing systems.\n\nLogMeIn has a blanking of the host screen feature:  \n\nProtect your data by blanking the host display during a remote control\n  session.\nLock the host keyboard and mouse to prevent anyone sitting at the host\n  machine from entering data during a remote control session.\n\nI personally use Teamviewer and while this option is available in Windows, it's not available on macOS or Linux.  Apparently it has something to do with how (easily) Windows handles DPMS (Display Power Management Systems) and how (badly) macOS/Linux implements it.\n(speaking from experience, ARD's curtain mode was \"iffy\" at best)\n\n\n*By default, you can ssh into any account (root being the notable exception) as long as you have Remote Login enabled.  You can log in while someone else is sitting at the machine without them ever knowing you were there.  This is by default.  If you need root access, create an \"admin\" account and su to root or issue commands via sudo.\n\n*To reliably find your computer, use DDNS (Dynamic DNS) and assign your computer a FQDN like (foobar.dyndnsprovier.com).  \nfreedns.Afraid.org provides a nice free DynDNS service that you can utilize to access your computer (or home network) even if your IP address changes.  In your case, you will need to execute a script via launchd (or chron) that updates the IP on a periodic basis.  Once you have that in place, you can access your computer by hitting up the FQDN (foobar.dyndnsprovider.com). The script and how to implement it on your machine is out of the scope of this answer.\nMAJOR Caveat:  If the machine is behind a firewall that you don't control and disallows SSH trafic or doesn't have it mapped to your IP or port, you are out of luck - this will not work.  Stick with LogMeIn or TeamViewer. \n", "Q: Location Services shown on menu bar even though all apps are disabled I have encountered a weird problem with my Macbook Pro (mid 2017/macOS Sierra 10.12.6).

It also of course numbers the movements.\nHere's the code for that:\ntell application \"iTunes\"\n    set sel to selection of front browser window\n    if sel is {} then\n        try\n            display dialog \"Nothing is selected…\" buttons {\"Quit\"} with icon 0\n        end try\n        return\n    end if\n\n    set c to (count of sel)\n    set songName to (get name of item 1 of sel)\n\n    set workName to display dialog \"Edit for Work name and then click OK.\" default answer songName --prompt for work name\n    set movementLength to display dialog \"Edit to everything except the movement name.

Using the above script, I have to select every single work, and trim it accordingly for work, and then for movement.\nWhat I would like to now create is a script that can do the whole process to multiple works at once, say, a whole album.\nIt would have to find every track that contained I. and set that as the starting point for the script I have outlined above, and also get the position of that I. and trim accordingly for the Work and Movement tags for that particular work - e.g everything before I. and the space preceding it would be set as the work, and everything after it would be set as the movement. \nI can see that this is what I have to do, but I'm too much of an AppleScript noob to actually implement it! For me anyway, the real challenge lies in determining whether a string lies inside of another string (e.g. check whether I. is inside song name) and finding its position inside of the song name. If I knew how to do those two things I could probably write the rest of the script!\nAny hints/ideas would be very helpful. And I hope my description makes sense.

Not even report an error.\nThe High Sierra icon with apparent stalled download indicator in my Applications folder\n\nIt does seem to start. I'm pretty sure I can see it when I run top in a terminal.\nMy machine is officially compatible. It's a mid-2013 11\" MacBook Air.\nIt doesn't have an SSD, just a USB 3 external hard drive. But this didn't stop the last few OS upgrades from working.\nI can't seem to find this specific problem mentioned anywhere on the net when I Google for it.\nIs this actually a known problem with a solution?\nUpdate\nI thought I should try to run it from the terminal and see if it outputs an error there. But it is not a regular executable file. It is some kind of magical directory in fact that is associated with the App Store. So I don't know of a way to launch it from the terminal. Doubleclicking on it does something in the background using the App Store, since the App Store does not open or tell me anything.\n\nA: Depending on when you downloaded the installer precisely, this answer may provide a clearer reason for the issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*I have noticed that their have been one or two system updates for macOS High Sierra in the past weeks. The fact that you are encountering this issue is most likely due to the fact that your version is older than the currently available and up-to-date one in the Mac App Store today.\n\n*Please try downloading the latest version.\nThen let me know how you get on with the install.

I recently bought my first Mac, after having been impressed with my iPhone 7 Plus for the past year. On my iPhone I can send both iMessages and text messages by switching on the \"Send as SMS\" option in Settings.\nOn my Mac the Messages app works great, except for when I want to send a message to a non-Apple user (most of my friends are on Android). When I try do do this I get an error like the one below:\n\n\nYour message could not be sent.\nPHONE_NUMBER is not registered with iMessage.\n\nI feel like I looked everywhere in System Preferences, but cannot find a \"Send as SMS\" option. Surely this is possible? How?\n\nA: Yes, it is possible! However, you do need to set things up first. \nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sign into iCloud on your Mac and iPhone using the same Apple ID\n\n*On your Mac open the Messages app\n\n*On your iPhone go to Settings > Messages > Text Messages Forwarding\n\n*You should now see your Mac listed - tap on the toggle to enable it. \n\n*You’ll see a prompt asking you to enter the code shown on your Mac. \n\n*Enter the code\n\n\nNow when you add a non-iPhone mobile number into Messages on the Mac it will be highlighted in green - this is an indicator that you are sending a text message and not an iMessage.\nNOTE: As all text messages sent from your Mac are now forwarded via your iPhone, they will count towards any associated costs for your mobile plan (if any).\n", "Q: Open website without actually opening it in browser from terminal Is it possible to open a website from terminal without it actually opening a new tab?\neg: open https://www.google.co.uk/ would open a new tab in the default application and go to that website. \nI just want a command which mimics that call to the website but not open a tab or show anything.\nReason behind this is that I'm trying to call a command on a website, but don't want anything to pop up, I just want it to call the command.\n\nA: Curl and Wget can be used to call a website, but if you are wanting to mimic some function on the website then these wont accurately mimic a user running a request in a browser.\nBrowsers have engines in them that process css, javascript and html that's why you have to use them.\nIf you want to use a website as if a user was using the site through a browser without opening the browser you should look into some headless testing frameworks such as PhantomJS, otherwise browserstack a browser testing platform has an api you can access, this will still open a browser tab but in a cloud vm somewhere so no on your actual machine.\n\nA: You can use curl\ncurl https://www.google.co.uk/\n\nand if you don't want the output\ncurl --silent https://www.google.co.uk/ > /dev/null\n\n", "Q: 3rd party SSD with High Sierra If I install High Sierra on a 3rd party SSD, will the main volume's file system be converted to APFS?\nThe hardware is a Early 2011 13\" Macbook Pro with a Crucial M4 SSD. \n\nA: \nIf I install High Sierra on a 3rd party SSD, will it be APFS?\n\nAn SSD is a drive regardless of who makes it and will be compatible APFS.\nIn this article, about SSD support for OWC (3rd party) SSDs, there are two main take aways:\n\n\n*\n\n*OWC shows up as both a rotational drive, which won't convert upon setup and as a RAID 0 array which won't convert at all.\n\n*A user in the forum confirms that the Crucial M4 in a 2012 MBP works without issue.\nSo, the issue is (IMO) not a High Sierra one, but one of the manufacturers in how they implement their SSD and present it to the OS.\n\nA: It's not clear from your question whether you want it to be APFS or not, but not all 3rd party SSDs have been compatible with macOS High Sierra's installer. Apple is aware of this and is working to address this in future updates, but it's unclear at this stage which SSDs will be supported or not.\nHowever, if you're hoping that your SSD will work with APFS then your best bet is to just try installing macOS High Sierra. If the installer detects a problem with the APFS conversion it will cancel the install.\nFinally, if you want to install macOS High Sierra and the installer doesn't allow this, then many users have found they can still install macOS High Sierra through a rather long-winded process.\nNOTE: I strongly recommend you have a reliable backup of your data before commencing the following process!\n\n\n*\n\n*Clone your current SSD to an external hard drive\n\n*Boot your MBP from the external hard drive\n\n*Now install macOS High Sierra to the external drive you've just booted from  \n\n*Reboot your MBP again from the external drive (so that you've now booted up in macOS High Sierra)\n\n*Reformat your SSD as APFS\n\n*Now clone your external drive to your SSD\n\n\nOnce you've finished you can reboot into macOS High Sierra from your SSD.\n", "Q: Unable to complete first backup to iCloud due to lack of space I have always backed up my iPhone through iTunes but I decided to use iCloud now as well. I only have the free iCloud plan with 5 GB of storage (of which 4.5+ GB free), and I'm attempting to backup an iPhone 7 with iOS 11.0.\nI tried enabling iCloud backup but I got back the message: \"This iPhone cannot be backed up because there is not enough iCloud storage available.\"\nAccording to this fairly old Ask Different answer and this Apple support document, there should be a \"Choose Data to Back Up\" option to allow me to disable specific items to backup (e.g. camera roll which should be enough to allow my backup to proceed). Unfortunately I can't see this option when following the Apple support document's steps for iOS 11. When going into Settings -> my name -> iCloud -> Manage Storage -> Backup, this is the screen that shows up:\n \nAccording to the support document I should now select the iPhone I want to backup, but as can be seen, there is no such option. I speculate this is because I never completed any backups at all. Thus I can't tick off items taking up lots of space to get the backup to complete for the first time.\nHow do I access the list of items to back up, so I can tick off some items to get the backup small enough to fit the available space?\n\nA: I also recently noticed that the backup \"choose data to back up\" section doesn't show up in iOS 11 unless you have an existing backup to select first, since the UI is tucked into the screen when you select a backup for a phone.\nIf you're willing to go forgo the 99 cent subscription fee for a month, you could increase your storage for iCloud, make a backup, see if you can refine the backup to fit back into the 5GB limit, make a new backup, and then bring your storage plan back down.\nI did the first few steps myself, and the backup refinement options do appear in the new backup. I've just been too lazy to followup and actually trim my backup to downgrade my storage plan.\nAlternatively, you could go into Settings > General > iPhone Storage, and see if you've got some easy targets using a lot of Documents & Data storage to delete to bring down the size of the backup. Only Documents & Data matters for third party apps, since the apps themselves are not backed up, only the app data (documents & data) is backed up. Also iOS itself is not backed up, only the settings and user data within.\n\nA: 5GB is likely not nearly enough to backup your iPhone, even if you chose not to backup any user added apps. It is very likely that the necessary files for iOS are too much for a 5GB backup.  iOS 11 is a 1.7GB download, which is surely compressed. While I doubt iOS backs up the core OS, there are personal settings, iCloud preferences, etc that need to be backed up that are not visible via the Backups app. Don't forget that iCloud spans all your Apple devices, so other devices might be contributing to the count. If you have contacts stored on your iPhone, they are in iCloud now, same for photos, calendars, etc. So they all reduce the room available for a backup.\nApple support says that the following are backed up under iCloud:\niCloud backups include nearly all data and settings stored on your device. iCloud backups don't include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Data that's already stored in iCloud, like Contacts, Calendars,\nNotes, My Photo Stream, and iCloud Photo Library \n\n*Data stored in other cloud services, like Gmail and Exchange mail \n\n*Apple Pay information and settings \n\n*Touch ID settings \n\n*iCloud Music Library and App Store content (If it's still available in the iTunes, App, or iBooks Store,you can tap to re-download your already purchased content.)\nWhen you do an over-the-air update, typically an iPhone will complain if there is less than 4GB free space, as it needs that amount for a on-phone backup/swap to install the new OS.\nIf you want to know how much space your backups take, open iTunes,Preferences, then Devices tab. Backups are listed here, and you can right click and select 'Get info' (on Mac) and it will give you the size of the backup. Note that most of these will be incremental. FWIW, i have a 128GB iPhone 6, and the backups are 40+ GB, with 8GB incrementals. Do note that iTunes backups are more complete than are iCloud backups.\n\nA: Check your iCloud storage as is and verify that you arent using any of that storage for photos (iCloud Photo Library). If you are, then like Kelly stated, I would go for the 99 cents a month plan so you can keep your photos and be able to backup with iCloud.\n", "Q: AppleScript auto-responder with incrementing number I'm trying to create an auto-responder that will respond to any email from a certain address with something like:\n\nThank you for your email.\n  Your number is #0000042.\n\nThe number should increment every time it sends one of these emails.\nAfter looking online at the expensive solutions it looks like my best bet is automating something with AppleScript - possibly saving the last number in a file and incrementing it.\nWhat would such a script look like?\n\nA: A simple way of implementing the auto incrementing would be to use an AppleScript property variable:\nproperty responseNumber : 42\n\nProperty values are \"remembered\" between calls to your script.  So, in your handler simply use:\nset responseNumber to responseNumber + 1\n\nHowever, the property value is reset whenever the AppleScript is compiled. So you would need to manually change the 1 in property responseNumber : 1 to the latest value when you changed the script. Using a file is therefore a more robust method and using a preference file to record the current property value means you can use built-in functionality.\nA basic AppleScript example (with no error checks nor testing, since I don't use Mail), to give you an idea:\nproperty responseNumber : 42\nproperty prefFileName : \"your.domain.in.reverse.emailresponder.plist\"\n\non perform_mail_action(theData)\n    my readPrefs()\n    tell application \"Mail\"\n        set theSelectedMessages to |SelectedMessages| of theData\n        repeat with theMessage in theSelectedMessages\n            set theReply to reply theMessage\n            set the content of theReply to \"Thank you for your email.\" & return & \"Your number is #\" & (zeroPad of me given value:responseNumber, minimumDigits:7) & \".\" & return\n            send theReply\n            set responseNumber to responseNumber + 1\n        end repeat\n    end tell\n    my writePrefs()\nend perform_mail_action\n\non zeroPad given value:n, minimumDigits:m : 2\n    set val to \"\" & (n as integer)\n    repeat while length of val < m\n        set val to \"0\" & val\n    end repeat\n    return val\nend zeroPad\n\non readPrefs()\n    -- Get the path to the property list\n    set plPath to (path to preferences folder as text) & prefFileName\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        set plContents to contents of property list file plPath\n        set responseNumber to value of property list item \"ResponseNumber\" of plContents\n    end tell\nend readPrefs\n\non writePrefs()\n    -- Get the path to the property list\n    set plPath to (path to preferences folder as text) & prefFileName\n    tell application \"System Events\"\n        set the value of property list item \"ResponseNumber\" of contents of property list file plPath to responseNumber\n    end tell\nend writePrefs\n\nSave this script in your ~/Library/Application Scripts/com.apple.mail folder and set-up a Mail rule to call it.\nYou'll also need to create the appropriate plist file in your ~/Library/Preferences folder with the following contents:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>ResponseNumber</key>\n    <integer>42</integer>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n", "Q: How do you know when Apple Music playlists update?

I see some items in Finder show up as bold and I wonder what that means. The example I have attached is somewhere under ~/Library. It's the most recent place I've seen this, not the only place. It also happens outside of ~/ and its subdirectories. It looks like a feature more than a bug. I wondered if it had to do with Git (maybe MacOS High Sierra shows Git statuses in Finder by default the way Ubuntu does), but no.

My video card is the Intel HD Graphics 4000 that came with the computer. \nWill I run into problems with this potential purchase and, if so, what sort of problem(s) and how much would they perhaps cost me to remedy? Thanks!\n\nA: According to EveryMac.com, the mid-2012 MacBook Pro can support an external monitor with a resolution of 2560x1600.\nThis means that your Intel HD Graphics 4000 chip is capable of supporting your monitor.  However, you should be aware that the HD 4000 uses shared memory (meaning it takes up to 1.5GB of RAM from the system).  \nPersonally, I would upgrade your memory to the maximum amount and again, according to EveryMac.com, you can upgrade it to 16GB of PC3-12800 SO-DIMM Memory.  This will ensure that your integrated graphics chip and the system has enough memory to deliver the best graphics performance it possibly can.\nAlso, regarding the monitor connection, I would avoid converting DisplayPort to HDMI and just stick with DisplayPort (go mDP to DP).\n", "Q: AppleScript: How to add currently-playing Apple Music song to a playlist?

I can definitely manually enter the script below to turn off air drop, but it would be great if I could just do this \"behind the scenes\" and 36 at a time. \nThe script that works is:\n defaults write com.apple.NetworkBrowser DisableAirDrop -bool YES\n\nI have limited knowledge of scripting/UNIX/ARD, but I'd love to learn. So far, all I've gotten is for terminal to open:\n    open /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app\nHowever, I cannot get the script/text to run. Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks,\n\nA: Don't bother with Terminal; ARD can run shell commands directly on the computers. Just select the computers you want to run it on, click the UNIX button in the toolbar (or choose Manage menu > Send UNIX Command). A window will open that lets you paste in the command/script you want to run, and select what user to run it as.\nBut it's a little more complicated than that, because you're changing a per-user setting. If you run the command as root, it'll only take effect if someone logs in as root, which (hopefully) nobody ever does. If you select \"Current console user on target computer\", it'll run as whoever's logged in at the moment, if someone's logged in. Do you have multiple users using the same computer and/or logging out between usages? If so, it's going to get set for some users but not others.\nI think this short script will work to set the setting for all current user accounts (everyone with a home directory in /Users) and also adjust the user templates so that new users will get this setting as well.

In the thread I linked to, the OP him-or-herself proposes a self-described “crude workaround” that involves copying the keychain.menu item from within /Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access.app/Contents/Resources of a machine running macOS 10.12, copying it over, and running it. This, it is claimed, reinstates the menu bar item.\nI held out trying this until the release of 10.13.1 in the hope that the disappearance of the Keychain Access menubar item was an oversight Apple would promptly rectify. Unfortunately that is not the case and as of yesterday's update the item is still missing, so I guess it's a deliberate decision on Apple's part. \nUnfortunately, the method proposed, as stated in that thread, does not work. \nWhen I read the proposed solution it was quite clear to me that it would entail disabling System Integrity Protection (SIP), as Keychain Access is rightly protected as it is is a key node on many paths of trust through the system. So this I did: I disabled SIP, copied over the menu item from an older system, and ran it, hoping for it to appear in the menu bar. Unfortunately this is not the case: it gets launched, but nothing else happens. I eventually tracked down this entry in the system log, despite SIP being disabled and reported as such by csrutil status:\nSandbox: mdwrite(507) System Policy: allow file-write-xattr/Applications/Utilities/KeychainAccess.app/Contents/Resources/Keychain.menu \nViolation:       System Policy: allow file-write-xattr /Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access.app/Contents/Resources/Keychain.menu \nMetaData: {\"build\":\"Mac OS X 10.13.1 (17B48)\",\"action\":\"allow\",\"target\":[\"Applications\",\"Utilities\",\"Keychain Access.app\",\"Contents\",\"Resources\",\"Keychain.menu\"],\"hardware\":\"Mac\",\"platform_binary\":\"yes\",\"profile\":\"unknown\",\"process\":\"mdwrite\",\"op\":\"file-write-xattr\"}\n\nAt this point I'm a bit at a loss to why SIP is still preventing this executable from running despite it allegedly being disabled, and how I can actually cause it to run. I'm clearly a bit out of my depth.\n\nA: I eventually tracked the issue down to an issue whereby the extended attributes (xattr) of the copied Keychain.menu item had were not identical to what they had originally been. Once I rectified that, the issue disappeared and the “crude method” does, indeed, work as advertised. \n", "Q: How to stop bluetooth from activating every time Mac wakes up? I have a Bluetooth speaker that I use occasionally, but not often.  A few weeks ago I decided it was time to upgrade my Mid-2011 iMac from Mavericks, to Sierra (not High Sierra).

Would the eGPU still be supported in that case? Would any extra steps be needed to set it up in macOS before running it in Ubuntu?\n\nA: If you install Ubuntu as a dual boot arrangement, both operating systems run independent of each other.

Could it be because one port is USB 3.0 and the other is (in my understanding) USB 3.1?\nUpdate 1: I have a Macbook Pro 13inch 2017 no touchbar and I used this dongle: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0749JXV6R/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\nUpdate 2 Just tried it with a different Macbook Pro (13inch, with touchbar), same issue persists. The hub only works with one of the ports as if the two ports are somehow different. \n\nA: The 13\" MacBook Pro has two Thunderbolt 3 ports with support for USB 3.1.  USB-C is the connector type.  There are no 3.0 ports at all.\n\nThe flickering you are experiencing sounds like a clock sync issue  (TDMS clock for the display, not the clock that keeps system time).\nFirst thing I would try is rebooting with the hub/dock connected to the port that's giving you trouble.  If the problem goes away, then you've narrowed down the problem.\nIf it remains, you may have a hardware issue.  Before taking it into Apple, however, it might be a good idea to try out a different video adapter. \n", "Q: “softwareupdate -l” on Mac terminal doesn't return anything I am trying to update my mac OS software to the latest version (10.12.6) from my current version (10.12.4) and unfortunately the app store 'updates' section freezes for me and I can't update it from there. I found another solution, which was to use the terminal to install the update.

This is above the original specs but due to a firmware upgrade some years ago, it now works with 4GB of RAM\nMy mbp reboots no more than twice a day, usually averaging once a day or day and half. \nI had a lemon of a battery before that swelled like crazy and bent the flimsy alumimum cover. I now have a replacement battery.\nMy theory is that the problem is down to one of 3 things but these are just theories I'm not mac expert. So I'm here to find out what likely is the real cause...\n\n\n*\n\n*contacts for the battery shorting out occasionally\n\n*faulty battery\n\n*RAM problems, unfortunately I never had any success before on any other computer with ram testers so i don't think running one is going to help here. They even say so on the internet, they can prove defective ram if they spot it, but if not - maybe it's defective, maybe not. That said swapping out the ram and testing each stick would mean I would need to run a week on each stick. Because it is basically guaranteed to fail in a week but a couple of days of uptime in inconclusive. I count uptime to include sleep mode.\n\n\nWhich brings me my \"smoking gun\" question... I believe this will pinpoint the problem once someone knowledgeable about macs and hardware reads this.\nThe reboot problem will occur even when in sleep mode. Or hibernating mode. Ok not sure about actual sleep but when you choose sleep and go to hibernating - i.e. it has to restore from disk later. Sometimes coming out of it will restore state, sometimes it will do a fresh bootup.\nAnd of course it can reboot at any time during normal operation. Reboot might be too strong a word, i think it just turns off.\nSo what does that indicate? would that be ram problem or a battery problem?\n\nA: Troubleshooting is often a process of elimination, so patience is often required. There's quite a few things you could do to try and narrow things down, because even from the info you've provided the cause could be RAM, your battery, or something else altogether.\nFor example, if it works fine in Safe Mode then it's more likely to be some sort of software issue/conflict.\nTo start with I'd do a NVRAM and SMC reset (in that order) as there's really no harm in trying that first. Before following the steps below, ensure you have no external hardware connected and that you're using the built-in keyboard.\nReset the NVRAM\nReset the NVRAM on your MBP as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your MBP reboots again and you here the startup chime a second time.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your MBP reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nReset the SMC\nTo reset the SMC on your model MBP, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MBP\n\n*Disconnect the MagSafe plug (power cable) from the computer\n\n*Remove the battery\n\n*Press the power button for 5 seconds and release\n\n*Put the battery back in\n\n*Reconnect the MagSafe cord (or power cable)\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button\n\n\nAfter resetting both the NVRAM and SMC, use your computer to determine if the issue still persists. If it does, I'd test your hardware as with Apple Hardware Test.\nRun Apple Hardware Test\nYour model MBP uses Apple Hardware Test. To use this, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MacBook Pro \n\n*Restart your MacBook Pro\n\n*Press and hold the D key before the gray startup screen appears.\n\n*After a while, Apple Hardware Test (AHT) will start.\n\n*When prompted, select your language and click the right arrow. \n\n*When the AHT console appears, you can choose to run Basic tests by clicking the Test button. However, I suggest you select the \"Perform extended testing\" checkbox before you click the Test button.\n\n*Your test results will appear in the window in the bottom-right of the console.\n\n\nNote 1: that the extended test will take some time. Take a note of the results and report back. \nNote 2: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.\nIf your MBP passes all hardware tests, then I'd try using it in Safe Mode.\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps to boot your MBP into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. can you use it without it restarting)\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restart your Mac as normal and test again\n\n\nIf you find that your MBP works fine while in Safe Mode, but not when booted normally, then let me know and I'll explain the process of identifying the culprit (it's likely to be a login item, corrupted font, or kernel extension).\n\nA: The mac usually reboots when encountering a problem. Like windows it restarts when the OS can't recover from it. Apple suggests that you keep your mac up to date to avoid anymore of these problems. \nApple suggests that also this occurs due to certain software. \nNot saying that it's kernel panic that's causing your mac to spontaneously restart but it's a possibility.\nI've encountered a kernel panic problem and I just went ahead and deleted somethings I've installed that looked like it was causing the panics since the problem occurred.\n", "Q: Sierra: Security Update 2017-001 Sierra broke my WiFi Today, I installed Security Update 2017-001 for Sierra 10.12.6 and my WiFi is unable to get a DHCP IP address off anything any more.

I tried setting up a new network location and connecting to a local WiFi access point but DHCP can't get an IP. I also reset SMC and NVRAM.\n\nA: I like to remove the network interfaces entirely if someone manually delete plist files or changes things in the library directly and then restart to give the system a chance to recreate the files if it can. Especially on Sierra and later since the preference files aren’t canonical in most cases and the settings persist in a database and get flushed back to disk periodically when the defaults system commits a change. \n\n\n*\n\n*Remove WiFi interface from all locations (if you have network locations)\n\n*Restart\n\n*Add in the wirelesss network connection in system preferences\n\n\nIf that doesn’t work, next is two items. You may want to check the network with another device or two - the Mac update could be coincidence and not causal. If the network is working, then you’ll want to look at things other than the core os. \nFirewall (little snitch), anti virus (eset or Kaspersky), vpn software and anything that adds extensions or network modifications. \n", "Q: Missing sound in videos recorded with iOS 11 iOS 11 finally has screen recording capabilities. It can record audio too (force tap on record button to enable). However, while the recorded videos play fine on the iPhone without any problems, when they're uploaded to YouTube or played with VLC the sound is missing. How do I fix it?\n\nA: Apparently, iOS 11 records a video with two audio tracks: the first one completely silent, while the second one is the real one.

So I was thinking: is it possible to broadcast the screen of my iPad? I am looking for an iOS only solution, but I can also connect the iPad to the mac...\nThanks.\n\nA: If you can use a computer what you can do is  connect the iPad to the computer through a USB cable then view the iPad screen using QuickTime. Then use screen sharing software so the person in the other place can view your computers which will have you iPads screen.\n\nA: Actually Zoom Meeting lets you share your iPad's screen by using Airplay and a special plugin that you can install on your Mac computer to share its screen. Zoom even lets you focus all guests screens to see your iPad screen instead of whomever is speaking.\nHere is their step-by-step guide to set that up.\nhttps://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201379235-Screen-Share-iPhone-iPad-Apps\n\nA: Unfortunately there is no native iOS only solution for this. As stated here and on other sites (with a little googling), OS X / MacOS does not act as an AirPlay receiver, only an AirPlay transmitter. For example, you can send your MacBook Pro screen somewhere, but your MacBook Pro cannot receive another screen. \nYou will either need third-party software like AirServer or Unicorns, an iOS app like Livestream, or an AppleTV. The AppleTV might be the easiest because of its HDMI port and ability to work with any screen that has an HDMI port. All AirPlay options will be limited to the range of the WiFi network you are accessing -- if you get too much distance between the iPad and the computer, it won't work.  \nYour question isn't clear whether you want live viewing or not, so if it does not matter and you're running iOS 11, another option would be to make a screen recording.\n\nA: I use teamviewer for giving tech support to my mother. They now have ios screen sharing, i have not tried it yet but i plan to. \nteamviewer ios screen sharing\n\nA: The best solution would be TeamViewer app which available for iOS and Mac and Windows. You can share your screen as well as do voice and text chat within it. You can even give control to the remote user if you want. There is virtually no lag at all.\nhttps://www.teamviewer.us/\n\nA: If you just want to see what each other are writing (and edit if you want as a bonus), you could check out Google Docs.

How can this be done?\nI've looked in the wifi settings on my mac and I can remove the network in the advanced settings, but that will remove it from my iCloud credentials and prevent my iPhone from connecting to it.\n\nA: There are several options that you can give a try on this post\nSelectively disable iCloud keychain syncing for WiFi passwords\n\nA: Although it may not have been possible three years ago, when you asked this question, a partial solution is available on macOS 10.14 and newer, and iOS 13 and newer (probably older versions).\nOn iPhone/iPad, deselect Auto-Join from the Wi-Fi network's Info page. I'm pretty sure you must joint the network to have this option. Then, even if the passphrase syncs, your iPhone should not join the network without manually selecting it.\n\nOn the Mac, de-select the Auto-Join check box next to the network name in Advanced Network settings, on the Wi-Fi tab (System Prefs-Network-Advanced-WiFi).

I have added the Google Photos app and sync'd all photos to it. I deleted photos from the native phone app. That freed up space but now I have an issue with my Messages app. It has several gigs of space taken according to the storage panel in settings. Message is the number #1 app using my storage, a few gigs! I went into Message and deleted all of the messages but it did not register that the space is saved, so it still lists it in the storage panel as using a lot of space. I have about 20 megabytes left on my phone.\n\nA: Go to Setting>Messages>Message History> Keep Messages> Choose 30 days.  It will delete the ones taking up your storage.  You can switch it back to Forever if you don't want your new messages deleted in 30 days.\n", "Q: Any way to use a VLOOKUP formula in Numbers to insert an image instead of text value? The intent is to create a sheet that references orders from customers with an image of each item ordered from my catalog of inventory.\nI need to create a spreadsheet that references item SKUs to display an image of a unique item. For example: 004 entered in cell A:1 should lookup 004 on sheet \"images\" and return the value in column 2 that matches 004. I have successfully created this formula using the VLOOKUP function.\nHowever, I want Numbers to populate the image in the resulting cell. The way my formula currently works it will only return the text in the cell. How do I get it to return the image value? If I delete the text out of the cell corresponding to 004 the result returned is 0 even though there is an image pasted into the cell.\nCurrent formula:\nVLOOKUP($A2,images::Table 1::A$1:B$10,2,FALSE)\n\nI had dragged images from the Finder into cells but it appears as though they only show up as background images in the cells or something like that.\n\n\n\nA: *\n\n*The images aren't the actual content of the cell, they're just cell formatting (background image), and formula cannot interact with formatting, only with cell contents.\n\n*Conditional formatting can only apply a restricted set of formatting options and unfortunately images are not one of these.\n\n*AppleScript does not provide the ability to set cell background images, only cell background colours (even though shapes and text items do have the ability for background images).\n\n\nTherefore currently this is not possible.\n\nA: Here's a hacky way to get this done:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take your images table and overlay it on the test sheet.  \n\n*Enlarge the row widths so they are all the same.  \n\n*Add a formula to the images table that checks the test sheet if the SKU is present.  This could be in a separate hidden cell or in the image cell itself with transparent text:\n\n\n*Filter the image table for True results\n\n\n*Hide all cells besides the Column B, (or use transparent results) \n\n\nKeep in mind that Test Sheet row A has to be sorted ascending for this to work with no duplicates. Alternatively, you can have multiple horizontal tables of overlapping rows one to test each SKU for a match. Finally, if you're at liberty to use cardinal numbers for SKUs you can substitute empty Row() or Column() to stand in for SKU references.\n\n", "Q: Unable to run vsftpd command I am using Sierra 10.12.6 and by using Homebrew, vsftpd is installed so that I can set up an FTP server my iPad can connect to.\nHowever, I can't run the command vsftd:  \nzsh: command not found: vsftpd\nBut when I try to install vsftpd again, i see that   \n*Warning: vsftpd 3.0.3 is already installed\nI can do man vsftpd and that works fine.\nI run which vsftpd at root, this returns vsftpd not found \nI went to the vsftpd config file and also set listen=YES\nSo how do I run vsftpd?\n\nA: vsftpd needs to be in your PATH\nIf it's not in your PATH, it will not run nor will you be able to find it with the which command.\nYou can add it two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Append your PATH to include the directory /usr/local/Cellar/vsftpd/3.0.3/sbin\n\n*Make a symlink to vstpd in your /usr/local/bin directory \n\n\nI would choose the second option as you have less items to modify (.bash_profile for example):\nsudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/vsftpd/3.0.3/sbin/vsftpd /usr/local/bin/vsftpd\n\nThat said...I wouldn't be using an insecure protocol like FTP to transfer files - scp is a much better option.

If a friend buys an iPhone X and creates/sends me an Animoji, how will it appear on my phone (if at all)?\n\nA: Yes. This site states that Animoji can be seen and heard on other devices because it's sent via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service).\nIn fact, people with an iPhone X can save their Animoji as a .mov file or as a sticker to use in other messages.\nI can verify this works.  I sent an Animoji to my wife who has an iPhone SE.  She was able to see and hear the message.\n\nA: Short answer:  Yes.\nAccording to Apple:\n\nYou can create your own Animoji and share it with anyone using an iOS\n  device, Mac, or smartphone.\n\nThe iPhone X can create the Animoji which can then share the animation to anyone running iOS, macOS, or a smartphone - ANY smartphone.  See this article for more details\nThe Animoji is saved as a .mov file which is sent via MMS and can be viewed by virtually any smartphone (not just iPhones). \n\nA: It will appear as a regular video file\n(Usually in a .vid or .mov file format that is accepted across all mobile & desktop platforms and Operating Systems.\n", "Q: Are all iPhones the same across carriers now? I know that several years ago, some iPhones had CDMA and others GSM, and others yet had both, depending on which carrier the phones were meant to work with.\nBut I read somewhere that nowadays, all of them come with extensive network compatibility. AT&T told me that their phones are locked but can be unlocked once fully paid off. So it sounds like there is a software lock but perhaps the hardware is universal.\nI am looking to buy a T-Mobile phone, get it unlocked, and then switch immediately to using another carrier.\nAre all iPhones the same now, in terms of communication hardware/software?\n\nA: No. In the US, CDMA models can work on GSM but the other way, not so much.\nWorse, in the US, Sprint and Verizon are not willing to bring aboard a device from the other carrier despite CDMA and GSM potentially being technically compatible.\nThe GSM phones when unlocked work across pretty much any GSM carrier.\nThe CDMA phones when unlocked also work across pretty much any GSM carrier or the specific carrier that the device was assigned to initially. (So I would generally be able to bring a Verizon iPhone from another person to my Verizon account)\n", "Q: Importing photos from iPhone to iMac. Can I get just edited, or just unedited and not both? I have an iPhone SE and a five year old iMac running El Cap. I use iPhoto on the iMac. Since the iOS 11 update, whenever I import photos I get both the edited and the unedited version of the photo on my computer. I used to just get one version. Here's an example of what I see now. I'm fine if it imports the unedited version since that is what I am used to. Is there a setting I need to change somewhere? Would prefer to do this without a 3rd party app since it's a fairly frequent workflow for me. Thank you!\n\nNote: I do not use iCloud for photos (terrible upload speeds) so this is just coming in via connected cable.\n\nA: I understand your frustration with this issue! When you edit a photo on iOS, it keeps the original and creates a text file with an .aae extension containing instructions of the changes/edits made to the original file. iOS renders the original file per .aae file which makes it look like it’s an additional image. The Photos & Lightroom MacOS applications do the same. \nI use the native MacOS application Image Capture to import my media. You can click on your device, select the photos you want and drag and drop them to whichever directory. This method also exports the associated .aae file separately as a text file.  If you happen to export a live image, this method will also extract the cover image as an image and the motion of the Live Photo as a video file. \nIf you want to extract/save an edited file, just make sure you share, copy or upload the edited file somewhere like your mail or messages. \n", "Q: Amazon FireTV without WiFi, MacBook Pro Internet sharing I've been struggling for a while on this, strange set of circumstances. \nI have a Amazon FireTV box that I cannot connect as university wireless does not support it.\nI'm looking for a way to set up Internet from my MacBook pro (the uni WiFi won't allow Internet sharing however - and no Ethernet in my room!). \nThe only way i've found is to share my iPhone's 4G but I don't want to do that because of data usage.\nAny way I can fix this? \nI have an iPhone, iPad, Macbook Pro, HDMI cables, USB cables but not WiFi that I'm allowed to share! \nAnything I can buy to make this work?\n\nA: Short answer: Not without getting you in hot water with your school/university.\nTechnically speaking, you could have a setup that consisted of:\n\n\n*\n\n*a WiFi router with a network specifically for your dorm room \n\n*Ethernet from router to MacBook\n\n*MacBook connected to Uni WiFi\n\n*Internet sharing routed from Ethernet on MacBook to MacBook WiFi\n\n\nWould that work?  Yes, your Amazon FireTV would connect to your dorm room WiFi that you create and traffic would be routed through Ethernet, through your Mac, to the Uni WiFi and out to the University's network.\nShould you do this?\nAbsolutley not.\n\n\n*\n\n*They can detect your WiFi network\n\n*The \"enterprise grade\" networking gear can detect that you are sharing the network connection\n\n*The traffic shaper firewall/appliance they are probably using will detect your (prohibited) network traffic\n\n\nThe key here to remember is:\nTheir network = their rules.\n\nYou can/will be discovered and your university \"career\" (IMO) isn't worth the risk.  \n", "Q: Why is the Arabic font on my iPhone different from what it is supposed to be? The default font for Arabic seems to have changed to \"San Fransisco\" in some update in the past, but my iPhone shows what I believe is the \"Nastaleeq\" font, which is supposed to be used for Urdu.\nThis is what it should look like (SF Arabic):\n\nThis is what it looks like on my iPhone:\n\nTo be clear: my device language is set to English, but wherever there are Arabic chracters they appear as in the second photo. It is quite hard to read this font, and I am puzzled as to why it appears for me, even though it is supposed to be SF Arabic.\nIs there a way to fix this/change the font?\nEdit: Here is an example from Safari:\n\n\nA: It seems I had my language preferences list with Urdu higher up than Arabic, so it used the Urdu font (Nastaleeq) wherever it saw Arabic text. Putting Arabic higher up in the list fixed the issue and made the font San Francisco.\nAs a side note, it is kind of a shame that it can't distinguish between Arabic and Urdu (seeing as they use the same alphabet), and yet it assigns a separate font to each of them and uses said font depending on its position in the language preference list.\n\nA: I can confirm that this messed up font is due to the iOS 11 update, as multiple users on the Apple forum have also been complaining about the Arabic font in iOS 11 being very bad.\nMaybe in the next update, Apple will take the complains into consideration and fix the font\n", "Q: Is there a way to rearrange home screens on iOS? I used to be able to arrange the home screens ( pages ) in iTunes prior to iOS 11. I could create new empty pages, ect. \nIs there a way to do this? For instance switch homescreen #2 for homescreen #3? \n\nA: Depending on your setup, you have two options.\n\n\n*\n\n*OPTION 1 - Use iTunes 12.6.3 instead. Refer to this answer for more details!\n\n*OPTION 2 - Use Apple Configurator 2. Download and install Apple Configurator.\n\n\nApple Configurator 2 provides much more advanced features in terms of managing your iOS devices. However, if you don't already have it installed, then the current version (v2.5) requires macOS Sierra 10.12.5 or later to run.\nOnce installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your iPhone via USB to your Mac\n\n*Launch Apple Configurator 2\n\n*Select your iPhone\n\n*Go to Actions > Modify > Home Screen Layout...\n\n*Your screens will appear\n\n*Click and hold the mouse pointer on the screen outline and drag it to change its order. So, using your example, click and hold the outline for screen 3 and drag it to the left of screen 2.\n\n*Click on the blue Apply button at bottom right.\n\n\nA: Configurator 2 not longer works. Certainly with iOS 13, it will let you change the order of apps and screens, but when you click Apply nothing changes on the device. AFAIK, Apple has been aware of this since September 2019 but have not fixed it.\n", "Q: Bulk printing of pdf files I have 884 copies of a document  that have to be printed soon. Each document has a QR identity code on each page, so it is not as simple as print 884 copies of a single document. We are using an canon image runner advanced 6255. The problem is that if I print any one of the documents from preview, it prints correctly. I have set the defaults for the printer using print using last setting, and also set the settings for the driver using the cups browser interface.\nIf I select several in the finder and use cmd p, the top of the QR code gets clipped off. I tried an automator script using three blocks (get finder specific item [folder] -> get folder contents -> print finder items) prints the QR codes correctly, but for some reason all of the ligatures (fi, …, etc) are dropped leaving blank spaces in the document.\nI also tried from the command line using lpr. This produces identical results to automator (QR codes are ok, but all ligatures are missing).\nAny ideas on a way to print the documents other than opening each one individually and typing cmd p and Enter?\nThanks.\n\nA: Since you're saying it prints from Preview correctly, then I'd actually combine all the PDFs into one single PDF and print the one document.\nTo do this in Preview:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Preview\n\n*Navigate to and select all of the PDFs\n\n*Go to View > Thumbnails\n\n*Click on one of the thumbnails \n\n*Use commandA (or just go to Edit > Select All) to select all of them\n\n*Now drag all thumbnails onto the first one (you'll see a green plus symbol) and let go of your mouse\n\n*The first PDF now becomes a single PDF with 884 pages\n\n*Select the first PDF\n\n*Now hold the Option key down and go to File > Save As to save your  PDF as a different name\n\n\nOnce you've done the above, I would quit Preview and reopen it again, but only to open up your newly combined PDF. Then do a test print, say for pages 1 - 5 to see if it's going to do what you want. If so, then proceed to print the entire document (or perhaps in batches of 50 or 100 pages at a time).\nNOTE: If you have trouble combining 884 pages into a single PDF, then maybe create 8 PDFs of 100 odd pages each.\n\nA: you can try printing from the terminal using the lp command. This would also allow you to use wildcards to print many files with one command. I print pdf's and they come out fine. You could check one to see if it prints properly.\n", "Q: How can I stop macOS re-installing default apps and data I've previously deleted when I update the OS? I normally tweak my iMac to the extremest way possible, including normally deleting useless system apps and certain processes and services. I did the same when I was running macOS High Sierra (10.13.0) and as soon as I updated to (10.13.1) all those system apps came back but only with greyed out icons and when being clicked they don't open because I have deleted supporting files and processes so now that these apps have come back, I am suspecting that the processes which I have deleted in the past might have also come back.\nSo how can I prevent apps and processes getting reinstalled every time a new version of macOS comes out?\n\n\nA: When removing \"parts of the operating system\" any update you get through the software update mechanism (AppStore) will re-install these apps and processes. Well, at least partially. Even so called ComboUpdaters were in fact delta updates relying on some previously installed base for many of the components supposedly contained in the ComboUpdater in full. \nThis results in a problem for those wishing to customise their installation: after removing parts Apple assumes are present some parts will only look like they are fully re-installed when in fact they are now 'present' but broken. This is what was experienced in the question when supposedly re-installed apps are now greyed out.\nThat leaves the customiser a couple of options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Leave the system in an Apple authorised state. This has to be decided on from the start, though. ComboUpdaters are no longer a reliable way to 'repair' such a state back into working condition and most backups from an extremist-customised system will be tainted. A re-installation might be in order to get back into that state.\n\n*Download the standalone updaters from Apple, while that's still possible. This is the usage/how-to request in the question. But it is a tough choice: In case of the macOS High Sierra 10.13.1 update that would be here. You might then use a  manual installation of individual parts of the updater package(s). This might be done with a programme like Pacifist. But this process is very time consuming, and error prone, at least. If there are firmware updates or some undocumented non-obvious scripts to be applied in this update this procedure reaches quickly its limits and it might even be almost impossible to replicate what the updater did. Errors will very likely accumulate along the way.\n\n*Re-delete or re-disable everything you previously disabled (that means you should prepare at least a script for that). This is clearly the best option if you start updating from a non-Apple approved state of system manipulation. If Chess and iCloud were useless before they are useless now, in their (half or cmpleely) broken state. Note that this answer does not discuss any SIP related issues, since that has be a non issue in the scenario given anyway. This adds just one additional step of after update maintenance.\n\nA: As you’ve correctly identified these apps are part of the operating system. As such, whenever the OS is installed, updated or upgraded they will be reinstalled etc.\nIn my opinion you’re best to just leave them be. In most cases they don’t take a lot of space and you’ll save yourself the headache of having to go through the process of removing them each time you update.\n", "Q: Can I change the default dialer on iPhone 5s with some other app on iPhone Is There any way to change the default iphone dialer with jio4gvoice app its annoying if someone calls me it pops up like a notification \nThanks\n\nA: If I understand your question correctly, then you want to use the Jio4GVoice app as your default phone dialler?\nAs far as I'm aware there's no way of doing this and, to be honest, you may not want to as this app isn't playing so nicely with iOS 11 (it doesn't seem to remain in the background properly as it used to under iOS 10). \nIt may be possible to make another app your default dialler by jailbreaking your iPhone. However, this is not something I would generally recommend anyway.\nIf you're happy with the app, then the best you can do is probably add it to your dock and hide the default Phone app from view. However, you'll find the default phone app will still be used when tapping on phone links etc.\n", "Q: Apple TV 3rd generation I bought an Apple TV but the remote didn’t come with it (used). I was told I could just use the Apple TV remote app on my phone. So I powered up Apple TV , connected it to router with Ethernet cable so it's on the same network as my iPhone. On the Apple TV remote app - it connects but wants a 4 digit code to be entered on the Apple TV. I can't do that with no remote and the Apple remote app gives no other options!!! How do I enter that code without the actual remote?\n\nA: Yes, there is a way out of this conundrum, assuming you have a bluetooth keyboard? It doesn't have to be an Apple bluetooth keyboard, any bluetooth keyboard should work.\nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disconnect the keyboard from the device it's currently being used with and switch it off\n\n*Switch on the Apple TV\n\n*Switch on the keyboard\n\n*Your Apple TV should recognise the keyboard and prompt you with a code\n\n*Enter the code using the keyboard\n\n*Once the keyboard is paired, you can use it to navigate through the Settings and add your Apple Remote app\n\n*Once connected and everything is okay, switch off your keyboard and reconnect it to its original device\n\n\nLet me know if you run into any problems.\n", "Q: TSplicedFont failed creating descriptor for El Capitan So I've bought used macbook air, wanted to format it to delete all traces of previous user.\nUnfortunately after trying to reinstall I get spammed with this error message:\nLanguage Chooser[416:4031] TSplicedFont failed creating descriptor for:\n\nand list fonts that are missing.\nI know that possible fix is to download system installer from app store, make a bootable usb drive and copy those missing fonts in there\nhttps://noto-website-2.storage.googleapis.com/pkgs/Noto-unhinted.zip\n\nbut I don't have access to app store so I can't actually make it.\nLeft installer for the night - nothing.\nWhat could I do?\n\nA: I've seen this before. From memory it was an issue for a lot of people when trying to install El Capitan from an external USB drive, rather than from the internal boot drive. For some users it would resolve itself by leaving it for a few hours, but obviously you've already tried that.\nThere's a couple of workarounds I've seen, briefly summarised below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download/install the Google Noto fonts - This was a simple fix for many users. Basically you download the Google Noto fonts and then manually install them onto the USB drive at the following location: \\System\\Library\\Fonts. I don't recall now, but you may need to actually create the Fonts folder in that location. Anyway, once installed, try installing again. (Note: you may need to\n\n*Install to an external drive first - This one takes a lot longer to do. Basically you install El Capitan onto an external drive first and then create an exact clone of it onto your internal drive. You can use software such as Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper! to do this.\n\n\nAnother option, although you don't specify which model of MacBook Air you bought, is to try booting up with the shiftoptioncommandR keys held down. This combination should reinstall the macOS version that shipped with your Mac, or the version closest to it that is still available. If that version is El Capitan, then you're set.

This apparently clears some caches and appeared to resolve my problem\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot the Mac\n\n*As soon as it reboots, hold the shift key until the login menu appears\n\n*Login to your normal account and use for about 5-10 mins\n\n*Reboot and login as normal\n\n", "Q: USB-C Charging Speeds / Charger Outputs I own a 2016 Macbook (with the USB-C charging) - at the time and in response to all of the reports of poor cables and poor chargers, I bought a meter so I could see what the throughput of my cables/chargers was. However, having run some tests I'm now not sure what to consider normal / what is harmless to the battery. \nFor all tests I used an original Apple C-C cable - though was able to replicate with two third party cables I own.\nI have the original Apple block charging at 14.3 V / 1.99 A and a third party block that charges the same.\nAnother third party block which advertises USB PD and 3 A is currently charging at 20 V / 1.43 A\nI've done some research online but I can't find any articles that indicate what a normal USB PD output is relative to the devices that connect to it and would appreciate any guidance / assistance. \nTL;DR: Have Apple charger which charges at one voltage/amperage. Bought several others advertised at PD which are higher voltage, lower amperage. Not sure what is 'safe', or 'fast', or does least overall damage to battery.  \n\nA: A good Multimeter is fantastic - I use one all the time - however it's not clear from your question just how you're using a Multimeter to take your measurements? \nConsidering we're talking about a fairly recent model MacBook Pro, I suspect you haven't opened it up to take these measurements. Instead, I recommend you download and install coconutBattery1. It provides a whole heap of information that you'll find useful, and from memory includes both Discharging and Charging measurements in watts!\nSome thoughts\nIt's not clear from your question why you're investigating all this? Unless you've actually got a problem you're trying to address, using the charger that came with your MBP should be perfectly fine. Also, in relation to you not finding any articles that indicate what a normal USB PD output is relative to the devices they connect to, that's because PD stands for Power Delivery and most of these devices are just designed to allow the power travel through them from the charger to the device being charged. \nIn other words, you can use a hub with a USB-C PD port with a 2017 MacBook Pro and also use it with a HP Elitebook and the voltage/watts will differ, depending on the device and charger.\n1 I am not affiliated with coconutBattery in any way.\n\nA: \nI'm now not sure what to consider normal / what is harmless to the battery\n\nIt doesn't matter. All modern battery powered devices including MacBooks have a charging controller (part of the SMC subsystem, for a lack of a proper word) that regulates the voltage.\n\n(This is a generic schematic for a power controller, not for a specific Apple product.  The premise and its function are the same).  \nThe point is, it's not going to dump raw power into your battery; it will reject voltage that's too low/high and turn on/off the charging circuit depending on charge status of the battery.  Additionally, the battery pack within the MacBook has a protection circuit as a safeguard against over/under voltage conditions.\n\nHave Apple charger which charges at one voltage/amperage. Bought several others advertised at PD which are higher voltage, lower amperage. Not sure what is 'safe', or 'fast', or does least overall damage to battery.\n\nThe USB 3.1 Power Delivery specification states that it will support up to 20V at 5A (100W).  That doesn't mean all power supplies will provide this.  The USB power delivery spec also states that a device will negotiate the power that get's delivered, meaning a charger that's capable of delivering 12-18V at 2A for a MacBook will have no trouble delivering 5V at 1A for a smartphone.\nHere are the rules of thumb:\n\n\n*\n\n*A charger with a higher power rating than your device can always be used.  Eg.  (85W MacBook charger can charge iPad/iPhone that requires 10W, but a 10W iPad charger can't/won't charge a MacBook that requires 85W)\n\n*Amps:  devices can only draw up to their rated amps.  A device that requires 1A will work fine on a power supply that supplies at least that.  It can supply more (i.e. 3A or 5A) but not less\n\n*Volts:  You must have the right voltage.  A device that requires 12V will not function with a power supply of 5V and will blow up on a supply of 24V.  Unless, you using a USB 3.1 supply and device; they will negotiate that for you.\n\n\nAs for your cables, they shouldn't matter.  Unless you have long runs (and by long I mean 5m/16 ft. or more) or it's super heavy (bigger than 22AWG) your cable should have not have enough resistance to even be a factor.\nThat said...I would stay away from no-name-brand or generic discount adapters and cables.  Their quality control is usually lax and you could do damage because they don't strictly adhere to spec.\n\nA: When I was charging my Macbook from a chunky Anker 26800 mah USB brick, it was like filling a swimming pool with a garden hose.  So like yourself, I started investigating the power situation in respect to both cables and the USB brick. \nTo determine what \"normal\" performance was to establish a baseline, I used the Jokitech USB Type C PowerMeter tester connected to the USB-C/Thunderbolt Cable which was connected to the 87 Watt Apple Power Adapter that shipped with my Macbook Pro 2018.\nThe Jokitech revealed that 19.8v was the baseline I needed to measure the cables' performance against.\nThe meter proved my suspicions that the USB cable I was charging my Macbook from a USB powerbrick with WAS indeed a \"garden hose\": This cable was performing at barely 5v\nI then swapped out the garden hose for the \"FIRE HOSE\" cable, a Anker USB-C to USB-C Thunderbolt 3.0 Fast Charging and Data Transfer Cable\nPictures of each cable will be shown first, followed by ones illustrating each cable's performance as displayed by the Jokitech meter while powering my MacBook using a Zendure X6 45 Watt Power Brick.  As you'll see, the Jokitech made it possible to clear-up the question marks about where the weak link in the power chain lie:\n\"Garden Hose\" Cable: Note USB 2.0 one end, USB-C on the other\n\n\"FIRE HOSE\" Cable\":\n\n\"Garden hose\"* with a USB-C adapter: struggling to make 5v\n\n\"FIRE HOSE\" cable performing at 19.7v:\n\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Touch Bar pops and right speaker gets disabled I have a strange issue with my MacBookPro 14,3 (Touch Bar), a 15\" model. \nWhenever there is a loud sound or a change in music dynamics (e.g., the start of a loud chorus in a song, an explosion, the “bonk” sound that macOS makes on bad input, …), the right speaker volume is lowered, and audio appears to be coming only from the left speaker. It then stays like that indefinitely.\nI can reproduce this issue with the system sounds preferences – at some point you hear the popping noise, the audio volume is lowered (and sound only comes from the left speaker), then I reset the audio sample rate:\n\n(One might notice a bit of a rattling sound coming from the right speaker, but I think this is a hardware problem.)\nIt's not a hardware issue per se, as I can fix this problem by resetting parts of the audio system. For example, when I open Audio MIDI Setup and change the sample rate, the sound returns to normal. I can also solve it by taking a pair of headphones and plugging them in and out for a second.\nI've had this problem both with macOS 10.12 and 10.13.\nNote that this problem does not occur when no audio is playing. It's therefore not related to the random clicking sounds that people sometimes describe. Installing the Antipop software doesn't help either.\nI will take the device to an Apple Store soon, but I thought I'd see if anyone else has come across this issue or might even have found a way to solve the problem?\n\nA: I had this issue on a 15\" 2017 MacBook Pro, three times over the course of roughly three months.\nApple issued two top case replacements, which includes both speakers–yet each time, a speaker would fail.\n\nApple finally issued a logic board replacement with a top case replacement. This, so far, has cured the issue.\n\nA: This was a very rare hardware fault that somehow was resettable by software or firmware.\nApple replaced the whole top case of the Mac, and now everything works again.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use Apple Watch with AirPods to detect a \"left hand double tap\" vs a \"right hand tap\"? The help instructions for AirPods say I can double tap either my left or right ear to perform an action.  \nApple Watch already has a setting for left hand usage vs right hand usage, and that is used by the accelerometer to figure out  when it should turn on the display.  To my mind, this feature could be extended to determine which hand is used to double tap a pair of AirPods...\nDoes the AirPod / Watch hardware support such a theoretical usage?\n\nA: I wanted to accomplish this with the iTunes version of the Apple Watch, but it only works if playing music from your phone, otherwise the watch can't program these tap options by itself.\n", "Q: How can I change AirPod volume with one hand? (while riding a bike) I need to adjust the volume of the AirPods while riding my bike.  This could be because the audio is now in \"loud commercial mode\" or because I need to pay closer attention to my surroundings. \n\n\n*\n\n*What is the quickest, most immediate, way of adjusting volume on the AirPods, aside from removing one from the ear?  (and pausing the audio)\n\n\nA: You can pause the audio by modifying the settings of the AirPods so that when you double tap on an AirPod, instead of activating Siri, it plays/pauses instead. This can be done in Settings > Bluetooth > AirPods. As for volume, I don't think there's a way. I personally have my iPhone mounted to my bike (with a Quad Lock case), and I control the volume with the iPhone volume buttons.\n\nA: The only way to change the volume with one hand is to use Siri.\nBut triggering Siri may cause you to miss something of the audio that is playing (especially when it's an audio book).\nI've configured my left AirPod to play/pause, and the right one to trigger Siri. So then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Double-tap left AirPod to pause.\n\n*Double-tap right AirPod to trigger Siri.\n\n*Say \"increase volume\", \"decrease volume\", \"volume to max\", or something like that to change the volume.\n\n*Double-tap left AirPod to play.\n\n\nBy default, both AirPods trigger Siri. You'll need to change the double-tap action for the left AirPod. See https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207009. \nNote: In the initial AirPod firmware, it was impossible to assign different actions to each AirPod.\n", "Q: Can I prevent music through an AirPod from pausing when a single pod is removed? Right now, when I remove one AirPod from an ear, the currently playing track pauses in the other ear.\nInstead, I want to continue playing the track.\nMy control over this using bluetooth settings is quite limited, so I'm hoping there is another location to investigate to disable this feature.\n\nA: Head into Settings > Bluetooth > AirPods > Turn Off Automatic Ear Detection feature\nWhen the automatic ear detection feature is turned off, audio will continue to play even fi you take the AirPods out of your ears.\n", "Q: Apple watch still paired to an iPhone I no longer have I used to have an iPhone from work and my Apple watch was paired to it.\nNow that I've bought a new iPhone and given back my old iPhone I am unable to pair my apple watch to the new phone.\nMy Apple watch says: \"wrong code, go to Apple Watch app and...\"\nThere is no chance to enter the code manually.\nBut in the App I can only start to pair a new device, but the watch is still paired.\nWhat steps do I have to do?\nMy Apple Watch is from series one and I don't know the software version nor how to determine it.\n\nA: One thing you can do, assuming you're not worried about losing the data on your Apple Watch, is to erase all content and settings on the watch itself. However, if you have no access to a backup, then you'll be setting the watch up from scratch as a new watch.\nIf you want to proceed, the process is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Settings app on your Apple Watch\n\n*Tap on General\n\n*Swipe up and tap on the Reset button\n\n*Tap on Erase All Content and Settings\n\n*Tap on Erase All\n\n\nOnce complete, your watch will be back to factory settings. You can now go through the process of pairing it with your new iPhone.\nNOTES:\n\n\n*\n\n*In your situation this is unlikely, but if you're prompted to restore from a watch backup, then select the latest backup you have. \n\n*Since you're not likely to have an iPhone backup, you’ll just have to set up your Apple Watch as new.\n[UPDATE]\nSince you've clarified in the comments that you can't actually even touch your Apple Watch screen without getting prompted about a wrong code, try these steps instead:\n\n\n*\n\n*Put the Apple Watch on its charger with the power on (so that it's charging) and keep it on charge for all of the following steps!\n\n*Press and hold the side button (not the Crown) until you see the Power Off slider\n\n*Press hard on the Power Off slider for about a second and then remove your finger\n\n*Tap on Erase All Content and Settings\n\n*Tap on Erase All\n\n\nOnce complete, your watch will be back to factory settings.

I find that Web apps slow down my workflow a lot.  If I leave browsers open I accumulate lots of unused tabs that slow things down a lot, and new tabs launch in old subject-specific browser windows.  OTOH, if I keep them closed (what I usually do) then I have to wait 10-15 seconds for the browser to launch each time, which is 2-3x the startup time of any reasonable app, and worse I usually must log in again.  How can I keep web apps from slowing me down?\n\nA: In general, this is an inherent flaw in all web apps, even the good ones and a fatal flaw in poorly designed web apps or web apps where your needs aren’t the main design goal. \nYou will want to shift your work to apps that can run native if efficiency is required. Offline and API access is generally far more efficient as you can work asyncronously or disconnected which decouples your interaction from the server code and processing with all network delays adding to your frustration. \nAlso, be sure you try browsers like safari that sharply curtail resource usage when off screen, background and minimized. Perhaps your browser can help with the 20 second startup delays and even that shouldn’t be a huge drain if you get proper work done once the app is runnning. \nLastly, a native app can be coded as a web app and still cause you grief. Some notable ones I've come across are the Atom editor, Slack app and other electron or node or react based apps that are glorified web view containers.\nHere's a very well thought out article from some very smart and well funded engineers on balancing the decision to build a pure native app (or building several iterations of the same app as your team learns how to engineer and expand the app) vs building a common core that will run across platforms or embed a web view.\n\n\n*\n\n*Growing Pains: Migrating Slack’s Desktop App to BrowserView\n", "Q: Mac os Sierra 10.13.1 : Unable to create an account I can't create an account on mac os sierra, when I add all informations (account name, password,...), all seems to go fine, then instead of creating an account I find that a \"Group\" is created!\nWhen I try to delete this group I can't\nPlease, Help!\n\n\n\nA: I found a solution finally, the problem was that my current user has no password set.

I thought this should have relationship with the APFS file systems?\nLooking for your help!\n\nA: So, looks like Bootcamp can't properly partiton your solid state drive.\nIf something doesn’t work, comment it so I can fix it.\n\nBefore continuing, make sure that you have a backup!!! I am not responsible for any damage caused by this guide. You have been warned.\n\nThese two steps are required for both methods, so do them.\nStep 1: Open Disk Utility inside \"Other\" folder in the Launchpad, or simply type Disk Utility inside Spotlight.\nStep 2: Select APPLE SSD SM02... (if you changed the name over the time, select your disk instead) from the list at the left, but NOT the containers, and press Partition located at the top.\nFrom here, choose one of these methods to continue. Method 3 is the best method if you only have one partition, but if you have more than one, such as Linux DualBoot, then go for Method 1.\n\nMethod 1 (Manually installing Windows 10, Better for your case)\n\nStep 3: A pie of your disk should have appeared now. From here, select your macOS partition and click + (plus) button. There is a new partition now. Arrange it's size either from the properties, or by dragging it from the borders. This is going to be your Windows 10 partition. Give it at least 40GBs of size and leave at least 10GBs of space for macOS. Name the new partition (not macOS partition) with a name that you will remember, such as BOOTCAMP, but make sure it is all in capital letters. Lastly set it's type as MS-DOS (FAT) and press Apply. You'll be warned that you are resizing your boot partition, just press OK.\nYou need a USB formatted as FAT32 with at least 8 GBs of free space to continue...\nStep 4: After you have created your Windows partition, download and install unetbootin from here. Then run it and select Disk Image option on the screen. Select ISO option from the dropdown menu next to Disk Image text if it is not already selected. Then press the button with three dots (...) and select your Windows ISO image (assuming you already have one). Lastly, select your USB from the dropdown menu next to Drive text and press OK. This will burn the ISO image to the USB.\nStep 4.1: To learn what your USB is called, open up a Terminal from Spotlight and type:\ndiskutil list\n\nThis will show you all of the drives connected to your computer. Your USB is something like /dev/disk1s1 or /dev/disk1s2 (but definitely not /dev/disk0). You can understand which one is your USB by searching for your USB's label.\nStep 5: Now open up the Bootcamp assistant for the last time. Once it's opened, select Action > Download Windows Helper Software or something like that. This will download Bootcamp helper. Select the target as your desktop and continue.\nStep 6: Once your bootcamp software is downloaded and unetbootin is done, copy the WindowsSupport folder from your desktop to the USB's root directory.\nStep 7: It's time to begin the installation! Reboot your MacBook and when it's powering on, press and hold Alt (option) key on your keyboard. Once a menu with boot options appear, select the EFI Boot or Windows option with a USB icon on it. This will start the installer. Give it a few minutes and once the button to begin the installation appears, press it. Wait for it to start. Once it started, select Special option. This part is important!!! A list of volumes should have appeared now. Select the partition you created earlier for Windows and click Format. When it's done, re-select the Windows partition and press Install. Now just relax and wait for it to finish.\nStep 8: After you fully setup Windows, select your USB from Windows Explorer and go to WindowsSupport folder. In that folder, run the setup program. Install it as a normal program and you are done!\n\nMethod 2 (Removing any partition other than your macOS partition)\nBe careful! Doing this will destroy any data on any other partition that is not macOS partition. I do not recommend this method since there is no way to know if Bootcamp assistant will be fixed or not. Also this method may not be helpful for you since you only have one partition.\n\nSometimes Bootcamp fails to partition the drive itself (which does this method automatically) and you need to do it manually to continue.\nStep 3: This step may be dangerous if not done properly, so be careful! A pie of your disk should have appeared now. From here, delete every other partition that are not your macOS partition one by one by pressing the - (minus) button. After you are done, press Apply.\nIf step 3 failed, try it again. It usually fails at first try.\nIf the only partition is macOS partition, try method 1 instead.\nStep 4: Now try running Bootcamp assistant again. If this method didn't fix your problem, try method 1 instead.\n\nMethod 3 (Converting APFS back to HFS+, best for everyone)\n\nStep 3: Backup your installation with Time machine (but not any other software). This is not optional.\nStep 4: Reboot your computer into recovery mode. To do this, press Command+R after you hear the startup chime.\nStep 5: You will be presented with a list of some utilities. Select Disk Utility.\nStep 6: In the disk utility, select “Macintosh HD” (or your system partition) and select Erase. Select Mac OS Extended (Journaled) as the type and select Erase.\nStep 7: Quit the disk utility. From the list, select Restore from Time Machine backup. Go through the instructions and restore your backup to disk.\nStep 8: After you restarted your machine, retry the Bootcamp Utility. It should work now. If not, try method 1.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Retina 15\" (Early 2013) randomly shuts down I've been having issues with my MacBook Pro randomly shutting down for about 2 weeks now.\nI tried taking it to a local Apple reseller and here's what they told me:\n\n\n*\n\n*The main cause of my problem was because I was using f.lux\n\n*They tested the battery and it apparently said that \"the battery\ntest failed\".

Best bet is to format it on the PC as Fat32 or even better exFAT on the Mac. \nBoth of those will give you read/write capability on both the Mac and PC. Just remember tho when you first plug it into the Mac wait for Time Machine to pop up the question about using the drive to do backups. Say no and it won't bother you again.\n", "Q: How to add a keyboard shortcut for Insert Equation for Word 2016?

I am supposed to, as part of troubleshooting my iCloud account error messages, sign  out of icloud then back in.\nI get the pop-up that logging out will remove all the Notes from my mac.\nWhen i log back in, will my Notes be restored to my mac?\n\nA: You should be fine. Refer to: If you sign out of iCloud to get a better understanding of what will happen with your documents and data (including photos. etc).\nHowever, if you're concerned and you have another device (such as an iPhone or iPad), you can ensure they are logged into your iCloud account so you can see/access the notes on those devices.\nAnd of course, it goes without saying that you should ensure you have a backup regime in place (such as using Time Machine).\n", "Q: Changing my administrator user's username has removed privileges I've taken over my wife's Mac mini running osx high sierra. \nI was in a rush and went into system preferences, clicked on the current user (advanced options), which was named 'user', which was also the administrator, and changed the name to 'grant'.

I fixed it by removing the iOS beta software profile by going to Settings → General → Profiles, select the Apple beta profile and hit remove.

It has a menu bar option in all OS X applications under Window>Focus Follows mouse that is easily accidentally selected.\n", "Q: High Sierra shows wrong disk usage for photos in information \n\nI installed high Sierra a few months ago and nowadays there seems to be a problem with System Information.app, it always shows the disk usage wrong like for example System 40GB but it shows photos to be 0KB even though I have 19GB worth photos and DaisyDisk reports correct disk usage. \nI have tried booting into safe mode and rebooting, this persists after restarts \nScreenshot:\n\n\nI have run this scan as root user not admin.\nso how do fix this missing photo sizing in system information.app?\n\nA: Most likely the space is taken by Time Machine. It keeps making local snapshots when the persistent TM storage is not available. The local snapshots can pile up to as much as 80% of disk space. After the next backup, or when the disk space runs low, the local snapshots are automatically removed by macOS. So this is not really a problem that needs a fix, the system will take care of it.\nThat said, I'd agree that the System Information app needs a fix on High Sierra. It seems to include the local snapshots into \"System\" category and therefore it appears as used space, while Finder counts the snapshots as \"purgeable\", including it into the \"available\" space. This inconsistency is confusing.\nDaisyDisk currently includes the snapshots into the used space (as opposed to Finder). Previously the snapshots could be revealed (./MobileBackups folder) when scanning \"As Administrator\", but starting from High Sierra and APFS, the local snapshots are saved outside the scannable area, so DaisyDisk simply shows a bigger \"hidden space\" segment. An update of DaisyDisk is said to be coming that will display purgeable space more consistently with Finder: https://daisydiskapp.com/manual/4/en/Topics/HiddenSpace.html?subtopic=StillHiddenSpace\n\nA: I had a similar problem just now: Finder, \"Get Info\", and Disk Utility were all reporting 18GB free on a 250GB SSD that should have had plenty of free space. Under \"About this Mac\"->Storage, it reported 130GB of \"System\" usage. None of the space was listed as \"purgeable\", and macOS started complaining about lack of disk space.\nI found a solution in this Apple discussion thread. In my case, the problem was fixed by going to Time Machine Preferences and removing an old backup drive (that had long ago died) from the list of backup drives. Immediately, the available disk space on my SSD started being reported correctly as 120GB.\n\nA: I recently ran into this - on my 500GB SSD, my free space was only 5% where I expected more like 75%.  I found an answer in a blog that worked for me:\n\nApple state that they automatically remove local snapshots when disk space is low, but their definition of low is apparently only 5GB of free space remaining – not really much free working space in 2017 when you might want scratch space of 22GB for 1 hour of 4k 30FPS footage.\nOn older MacOS releases, it was possible to disable the local snapshot feature entirely, this doesn’t seem to be the case with High Sierra – but it does appear to be possible to force an immediate purge of local snapshots with the following command:\n\nsudo tmutil thinLocalSnapshots / 10000000000 4\n\nFrom the tmutil manpage:\n\nthinlocalsnapshots mount_point [purge_amount] [urgency]\n\nThin local Time Machine snapshots for the specified volume.\nWhen purge_amount and urgency are specified, tmutil will attempt (with urgency level 1-4) to reclaim purge_amount in bytes by thinning snapshots.\nIf urgency is not specified, the default urgency will be used.\n\n\nA: I found that just opening the Storage Administration window (in System Information) fixed this.\nThis was important as I needed to restore my photo library from Time Machine and throwing the broken folder in the trash and emptying the trash did not release the diskspace.  Disk Utility said there were five snapshots on the disk which most likely was the culprit.\n\nA: You need to reindex your Spotlight cache. To do this\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences → Spotlight → Privacy\n\n*Click on the plus symbol and add your macOS hard drive you're having the wrong status/info problem\n\n*After adding your particular hard drive, quit System Preferences then wait for a few seconds.\n\n*Again open System Preferences → Spotlight → Privacy and this time remove your previously added hard drive.\n\n\nWhat this does is it reindexes and creates the .Spotlight-V100 files on your hard drive. There are also various sudo commands to perform this step but for now try this!\n\nA: I have Carbon Copy Cloner installed (https://bombich.com) and it has a feature called CCC Snapshots.

What is the primary reason for the cost difference between the two devices?\n For example, in my country the newest iPhone (iPhone 8) costs about $1,070 at the lost configuration (normal size, 64gb), while the newest iPad (Just the generic iPad, no cellular) costs less than half that at around $465. This is a significant difference.\nIt may seem rather naive to assume that the larger device would cost more. And I do realise that the current iPad has a slightly older processor than the iPhone. But the iPad does have both a larger screen and battery, amongst other costs. Is it based on the manufacturing price, or is it more to do with the market and how much people are willing to pay? \n\nA: There are a few factors to this.\nThe iPhone 8 has lot newer technologies inside it the the iPad 5.\n\n\n*\n\n*A11 Bionic CPU vs the A9 (used on the 6s)\n\n*True Tone display\n\n*3D Touch\n\n*Better LCD used for display (supports P3)\n\n*The iPad 5’s LCD isn’t even laminated to the front glass\n\n*and a lot more changes\n\n\nEven though the iPad 5 is released in Q1 2017. It is using technologies that dates back to 2015. A more fair comparison would be the new iPad Pro announced in WWDC17. Which costs similarly (just a little bit less than the iPhone 8).

I've been resetting the SMC in many macbooks in my job as a technician.  Yet, it's not entirely clear to me if the SMC is reset in this case:\nPlease let me explain myself properly:\nAccording to Apple's official article:\nHow to reset the System Management Controller (SMC) on your Mac - Apple Support\nin Macbooks with removable batteries (these are the older macbooks in which the user can push a clip or clips and easily detach the battery), the SMC reset is done by removing the battery and pressing the Power button for five or more seconds.\nMy doubt is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will the SMC reset if you disconnect the battery and press power for 5 seconds in newer Macbooks?\n\n*Will the SMC reset if you press the keyboard combination Shift-Ctrl-Alt and Power in older Macbooks with user-removable batteries?\n\n\nMy idea is that in both cases the SMC will reset.  But I'm not altogether sure, which has me repeating SMC unnecessarily in my daily troubleshooting.\nAny suggestion will be welcome. \n\nA: This answer is based on the datasheet from a similar power management controller unit, or PMU (what Apple calls SMC - they're the same thing) as datasheets for those chips are not available.\nI am using the datasheet from the TM4C1231C3PM which is approximate to the (Apple SMC) LM4FS1AH5BB  which are both made by Texas Instruments.\nThere are 6 conditions which will cause a reset:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power on reset (POR)\n\n*Brown out detection \n\n*Software initiated reset\n\n*A Watchdog timer reset\n\n*MSOC (system clock) failure\n\n\nThe POR will reset the SMC\nWait....but I turn on/off my laptop all the time.\nThis is the power on state of the chip, not the machine.  As long as power is applied, it will hold the settings which is why disconnecting the the battery resets the SMC.  This is the initial power up of the chip.\n\nThe internal POR is only active on the initial power-up of the\n  microcontroller and when the microcontroller wakes from hibernation.\n\nSo, to answer the questions...\n\nWill the SMC reset if you disconnect the battery and press power for 5\n  seconds in newer Macbooks?\n\nYes.  Removing the power and discharging any residual charge will reset the SMC.\n\nWill the SMC reset if you press the keyboard combination\n  Shift-Ctrl-Alt and Power in older Macbooks with user-removable\n  batteries?\n\nIt's impossible to know without actually testing them as datasheets for older SMC chips are even more difficult to source.  (IMO) it's unlikely since the desktops of that vintage didn't use the keypress and relied solely on removing power, the laptops did as well since they had removable batteries.

A similar post on Apple's forums said that the Photo Booth app was removed by this restriction.\nThis third-party article on an MDM tool says that the restriction removes the Photo Booth app:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Disable Camera\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*The camera will be completely disabled. This also remove the Camera, Photobooth, and Facetime apps on the home screen.\n  \n  \n\nIt would make sense that the restriction available in the UI flips the same bit as the MDM restriction.\n", "Q: Mac equivalent to iOS Colour Filters (Tritanopia) I have Tritanopia (Blue / Yellow) colour blindness.\nIn iOS I can use Settings > General > Accessibility > Display Accommodations > Colour Filters > Blue / Yellow Filter to boost the relevant colours on the display.\nI looked around but apart from applications hacks and messing with monitor calibrations I couldn't find anything easy.\nIs there an equivalent on Mac? \n\nA: I've used the xSCope app to do this using their loupe tool (so it's not for full screen use) for several years and it's a workhorse of other design and measurement goodness. You might check out f.lux as well but that seems to be more bio-perception for decreasing blue hues on a circadian cycle that tracks sunrise and sunset.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://xscopeapp.com\n\n*https://justgetflux.com\nI don't think this full screen feature is embedded in macOS High Sierra (yet) and it's not explicitly enabled on older Mac OS versions in as usable a format as iOS 11 does. Perhaps later in the year or next year this would come natively.\nIn the mean time, you could use a third party app or try setting a custom color calibration / display profile for some light correction. I don't think either of the above is as powerful as iOS accessibility, though.\n\n\nA: I know this question is old, but just in case someone else needs it, there is Screen Color Filter app available in iTunes store for macOS. Works similar to iOS Color Filters under Accessibility -> Display Accommodations.\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/screen-colors-filter-color-tint-dim-hev-block/id1177401419\n", "Q: How can I completely de-authorise my account from iTunes (mac)? I'm using a different apple ID now.  So I switched accounts like this:\n- I signed out of the old apple ID in System preferences > iCloud.  Then signed in with the new one.\n- I signed out of the old apple ID in App Store > Store.  Then signed in with the new one.\n- I de-authorised the old apple ID in iTunes > Accounts menu > Authorisations. Then authorised the new apple ID.\nI restarted the computer.\nHowever, even after authorised the new Apple ID, it's the old one that still shows up in iTunes > Account, on top, even though it has already been de-authorised:\n\nScreen Shot 2017-11-05 at 16.56.55.png\nnot only that, now, when I go to Account > View my account, I'm prompted for the old apple id and password, and if I use instead the new one, it won't go through, I'm prompted again for the new apple id and password.\nWeird!.\n\nA: Signing out of your account and deauthorizing a device are two different things.\nWithin iTunes you can actually sign in and out of multiple accounts. I don't mean simultaneously, just that you can sign into one and, if needed, sign out of that account and then sign in using another account.\nAuthorising a device basically tells the iTunes ecosystem that it's allowed to play your purchased music, videos etc and that's why there's a limit to how many devices can be authorised for any particular account. So, deauthorizing a computer/device is typically something you would do when you're going to sell it etc.\nIf you want to sign out of your old account in iTunes you should actually do that within iTunes. You may need to sign in again first and then sign out before signing in with your new account.\n", "Q: How do I correct errors in album/work/song/track in Gracenote after the CD is already imported into iTunes?

I don't find the submit on any other menu or screen except the import, which doesn't exist when not importing. \n\nA: Aha!  If I turn off the eject after import option (which the latest update turned off without asking me!), then the import window stays there and I can continue to edit and submit.\nOr, I can say No to the import, do my editing, submit corrections, then Import.\nThird option, re-insert the CD, make corrections, submit, re-import (it will ask me whether I want to replace the previously imported files).\n(Unfortunately, it won't let me edit some tags, but that's another question.)\n", "Q: Cannot change movement number or name of a classical piece in iTunes I just imported a classical CD into iTunes, and am trying to correct the information from Gracenote.

(instead of submit a report and get a stream of excuses from Apple).\nAmadeus and exiftool will allow me to set tags without iTunes running, and iTunes will show the changes when launched.  Are there specific tags for these three fields that I can set?\n\nA: Discovered that I can edit those fields in my library, but not in the import window.  And I can't get access to the file from the import window to change tags.  That is, “show in finder” is not on the context menu in that window.\nThus, I can make them correct in my library, but I can't send the corrections to Gracenote.\nWhile fiddling with this I also discovered that if I select a track in the import window and change tags, the changes do not “stick” if the import of that track has already completed.  For example, select all of them and fix a typo in the album name: I end up with two albums, one with the wrong name and the first few tracks, and my correction on the other tracks.\n", "Q: v4.services.acrobat.com and denying keychain How do I prevent the following dialog from appearing in Safari. I don't see why Adobe would need certain information. Since \"deny\" doesn't seem to impact anything, I would like to \"Always Deny\". I have already disabled the adobe plugins within Safari. I am observing this in the latest High Sierra. I have latest Acrobat, Illustrator and Photoshop installed through Adobe Creative Cloud.\n\n\nA: I cannot add a comment so I am posting this as answer. Can you share a screenshot of your activity monitor. Since plugin is requesting keychain access for Acrobat, Acrobat safari plugin process should show in Activity monitor. Also are you getting this even when not opening PDF?\nWhile opening PDF on Safari doesn't need any keychain access in itself, Acrobat services are available in browser too and since these are paid, it needs to check user login for which keychain access is required. Unfortunately Apple doesn't give a Deny Always.Check Here.\nYou can try adding safari plugin process to allowed application in keychain \"v4.services.acrobat.com\". The process is /System/Library/Frameworks/WebKit.framework/Versions/A/XPCServices/com.apple.WebKit.Plugin .64.xpc. Please note that this will actually allow access to plugin process and won't ask you again. Use keychain Access app, search for keychain item \"v4.services.acrobat.com\" and add this in allowed application. This is what Always Allow effectively does. \nIf you are not interested in opening PDFs on Safari, you can delete Acrobat plugins from /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/. Its named AdobePDFViewer,AdobePDFViewerNPAPI. Or move them to disabled. This would definitely fix it but you wont be able to open pdf on Safari using Acrobat.\n\nA: In my case-- every time I opened Acrobat it would prompt to allow access to v4.services.acrobat.com in my Keychain.\nMy solution was just to open Keychain Access app and delete all instances of v4.services.acrobat.com.\nHope this helps someone.\n", "Q: Can I get stable 4K 60Hz with two external displays without MBP screen on?

My os (macOS High Sierra) got corrupted and login screen doesn't appear.. if I reinstall macOS from recovery menu will my previously installed software and data be deleted?\nAnd if so how can I back them up on a hard drive, the data and the software are very important to me.\n\nA: Reinatalling the os alone does not erase data. But I do still recommend taking a backup by booting into recovery and click Utilities in the upper menu bar and then select terminal then type csrutil disable then type reboot then when your Mac boots up and when you hear the chime hold CMD+S then wait until the plain text is done loading then type mount -uw / then grab a pen drive to plug in to your Mac and take a backup of your Mac. Once you plug it in then wait for it to get recognised you should see a message suck as \"USBHUB\" like that once you see that type mkdir /usb then find the disk identifier of your pen drive by typing ls -la /dev/disk* you will find listings such as disk1 or disk1s1 your pen drive might be last disk listing. Once find that you might see disk3s1 or disk4s1. Then type mount -t msdos /dev/diskXs1 /usb (Note: X will be your disk identifier and if the file system o your pen drive is hfs or so make sure you replac msdos but if your pen drive is Fat or exfat don't change it. You might see some few lines such as kext like that if your disk was successfully mounted to make sure type ls -la /usb you should see .Trash and all the contents of your pen drive then type rsync -aH --exclude= ~/Library ~  /usb then it might take some time to take backup of your pen drive depending on the size of your home directory after it has completed type shutdown -h now. If you have any problem please do comment below.\n\nA: Reinstalling macOS from the recovery menu does not erase your data. However, if there is a corruption issue, your data may be corrupted as well, its really hard to tell. \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904\nI will take this time to remind you that the time for backup is BEFORE you have an issue, so hopefully you have a Time Machine backup or Carbon Copy Cloner disk around.\nTo gain access to the disk depends on what model Mac you have. An older Macbook or Macbook Pro likely has a hard drive that is removable, allowing you to connect it externally using an enclosure or cable. Newer Macbook/Macbook Pros and iMacs make it much more difficult, as their SSDs are not removable or very difficult to remove. I recommend you review the step by step guides at ifixit.com to see if you are brave enough.\nOtherwise, find a friend's Mac, and follow these Apple instructions to set your Mac in 'target disk mode' and allow the other Mac to access your files to copy them off. Again, the corruption might make this impossible.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201462\nOh, and backup your computer!\n", "Q: iPhone 7 Plus no longer opens apps after iOS update I updated my iPhone to the newest iOS update from Apple. Since then, when I open an app, a spinning circle appears for a while and then closes. \nI'm not sure if it's related, but my phone keeps prompting me that it can’t connect with iCloud unless I approve it with another device, but I don’t know how to do that.\n\nA: I haven't seen this exact problem, but if you don't authorize iCloud then this sort of thing can happen.\nGo to Settings and tap the first row to get into iCloud settings. There are multiple ways to approve your iCloud login. Try clicking \"Forgot Password\" and it will give you different ways to authenticate.\n\nA: The spinning circle could be due to software issues. A system restore (after a backup of course) should remedy the issue for you.\nBut before you do that:\nThe issue with verifying your device to use iCloud from another device is based on your security type. Whenever you use Two-Factor Authentication and you don't sign out of older devices that you no longer use, Apple assumes that you still have those devices. Or if you signed out of a device and then restored/reset it, Apple will assume the device is a new device and will ask for the old \"device\" aka old OS to verify the new OS to use iCloud. The only way I know to remedy this feature is to completely turn off Two-Factor Authentication until Apple makes this a much easier/tolerable issue. To turn off Two-Factor Authentication, go to www.appleid.apple.com (or www.appleid.com) and sign into your account. Once signed in, go to the Security tab -> click edit in the far right -> then turn off Two-Factor Authentication. You'll have to use Secondary Authentication as the primary security type for your account. All this means is that you'll need to use security questions and answers along with your password to protect your account.\n", "Q: Reset CPU fan speed I use smcFanControl to control the CPU fan speed, and now wish to reset it so that MacOS automatically adjust the fan speed. Even after using the Reset option in smcFanControl, the CPU fan speed is still fixed to the last value. \nHow can I reset the CPU fan settings?\n\nA: Solution #1\nRestarting the computer should reset the fans to the computers control. I would also recommend making sure its not in the startup applications so it doesn't turn on when you login, and possibly take control of your fans again.\nSolution #2\nIf that doesn't work try doing a SMC reset, this will almost surely reset the fans to system control. Again with this one, I would recommend you make sure it isn't in your startup applications.\nHow to reset the SMC\nRemove Start Up Application\nRecommendation\nIf you still want to use software to control the fan I would recommend using this software.

The windows all have titles indicating the problem space they're for, but sometimes something gets done in the \"wrong\" window.\nHow can a do a single search across all the windows? Is there an app out there that will read the saved Terminal contents, and write them as text?  Even better, is there source code for doing that?\nI have this AppleScript:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    set windowName to \"\"\n    set windowContents to \"\"\n\n    repeat with theID from 1 to (count windows)\n        set windowName to the name of window theID\n        log windownName\n        set windowContents to the contents of every tab of window theID\n        log windowContents\n    end repeat\nend tell\n\nFor which I get told:\nerror \"The variable windownName is not defined.\" number -2753 from \"windownName\"\nFinal end product will be writing \"The file is: \\n\", but AppleScript seems intent on keeping me from doing so\n\nA: Terminal tabs have two useful AppleScript properties called history and contents.\ncontents contains the text content of the tab currently visible in its pane (that is, any lines lying within the boundaries of the visible portion the window).\nhistory contains the entire history of the tab's contents, from the moment it came into existence to the moment the property's value is requested.\nThe AppleScript command to retrieve the entire contents (history) of all tabs across all windows currently open in Terminal is:\n    tell application \"Terminal\" to get the history of every tab of every window\n\nBut, as you discovered, history can contain an awful lot of text data, depending on how many tabs you have open and how actively they've been used.\nYour approach to dealing with this issue is a good one: looping through each tab/window individually and handling its contents one-by-one.\nYour current AppleScript only retrieves the contents of each tab, which is going to be a very small subset of the data contained by each tab (which may be sufficient for your needs).  If you need to deal with the larger quantities of data contained in each tab's history property, this might be a means of doing so:\n    set F to POSIX file \"/Users/CK/Desktop/Terminal.txt\"\n\n    set _f to open for access F with write permission\n    set eof _f to 0 -- Erase old contents\n\n    tell application \"Terminal\"\n        -- Loop through every window\n        repeat with W in (a reference to windows)\n            set [W] to W\n\n            -- Loop through every tab of each window\n            repeat with T in (tabs of W)\n                set [T] to T\n\n                set R to (a reference to history of T)\n                write R & linefeed to _f\n            end repeat\n        end repeat\n\n    end tell\n\n    close access _f\n\nThis should sequentially append the text history of each tab from each window to the text file specified at the top of the script.\n", "Q: Face ID Has Been Disabled I see a warning on my iPhone:\n\nFace ID Has Been Disabled\nA problem was detected with the TrueDepth camera.

Strangely enough my iPhone 11 had been working under similar conditions with no issues on iOS 13.7.2. Restarting the phone did not help. Adding a new face in Face ID did not help. The Apple documents then recommend visiting a repair centre which didn't sound like much fun or really necessary.\nWhat did work was removing Face ID completely and then restarting the phone in Airplane mode and re-adding Face ID.\nNote that I did not have to erase and restore my iPhone (a significant waste of time and energy).

The information on 1Password regarding using/sharing the application one purchased in AppStore is that it is possible. You are given a rundown on how to install on your other device. But it doesn't work because the menus that are mentioned don't exist in the Mac version.\nOriginally I bought the 1Password Pro App on my iPhone (7) and would like to synchronise the password information via Dropbox on my MacBook Pro.

My desktop folder has files in it, so deleting that and symlinking the other folder won't work.\nHow can I change the folder the desktop displays?\n\nA: The folder with the name Desktop in your user folder is a \"blessed\" folder. The content of this folder is shown on your GUI desktop.\nTo show the content of a different folder on your GUI desktop you'd have to rename the folder Desktop to an unused name and rename another folder to Desktop:\nsudo mv ~/Desktop ~/myOldDesktop && sudo mv ~/myNewDesktop ~/Desktop\n\nYou may encounter graphical issues with the file and folder names on your \"new\" desktop afterwards.\nIt is not advisable to \"enhance\" another default user folder like Pictures or Documents like this.\n\nIf you have to organize your workflow (or your files and folders) like this, your workflow or your notion of the desktop metaphor is broken. That's like moving around work desks rather than files in an office.\n", "Q: Mac HDD Partition has wrong size after removing Bootcamp Partition Today I wanted to get rid of the old Bootcamp partition of my Mac. I used disk utility to remove the partition, which worked well. However, it seems like Disk Utility failed to correctly extend the main (Macintosh HD) partition, which still has the old size of 260 GB (of 500 GB disk size).\n\nI tried to use the partition dialog, which initially shows this:\n\nAdding a new partition using + and then Apply fails with an \"internal error\".\nFirst Aid on the drive succeeds, but does not fix the problem. I already tried all these steps in recovery mode, which shows the same views and behaves exactly the same.\nIs there a way to fix the drive/partition?\nThe device in question is a MacBook Pro 15-inch Mid-2012 with macOS High Sierra v10.13.1.\n\nA: I'm wondering if selecting the \"View\" button, followed by \"Show All Devices\" might shed some light here?\n\nUsually when I have trouble partitioning and it involves the drive I'm booted from, I will start up from Internet Recovery Mode or (preferably, for loading times) a version of macOS I've previously installed on an external hard drive or USB. Regular Recovery Mode might be fine as well, but it's still booted from the hard drive you're working on.\nInternet Recovery can be started by holding the Option, Command and R keys while the computer turns on (you can let go once a globe icon or Apple logo appears).\nBefore you're starting up to do this, make sure you have a current backup!!! :)\nOne other thing I can think of that would stop you doing this is if macOS had to move the Recovery HD partition to be between your Macintosh HD partition and your Boot Camp Partition. It doesn't always have to do that, but if it does, you might have to manually delete the Recovery HD partition via Terminal and then expand Macintosh HD.\nI'd suggest you use Apple's \"Recovery Disk Assistant\" to make a Recovery HD on an USB or external Hard Drive before doing that, in case you need to reinstall later, cause I don't think you can put Recovery HD back on the internal drive without a Major OS upgrade (like 10.12 > 10.13) or a reinstall.\nIf you run:\ndiskutil list disk0\n\nin Terminal, it will give you a listing of all the partitions on the  first mounted disk. \nIf there is a volume labeled \"Recovery\", and then a unformatted amount after it, that's why you can't expand Macintosh HD, but if it lists empty space and then the \"Recovery\" after that, then you can probably just expand Macintosh HD with a external hard drive version of macOS or Internet Recovery.\nAnd again, Backup all your files first please!!!!\n\nA: I saw this today on an iMac; a 1TB drive had been partitioned into four 250GB partitions and only one was in use!  So I removed the three partitions that were not needed and Disk Utility confirmed the one left was 1GB.\nHowever, in Finder, it still showed as 250GB.  Even after a reboot.\nSo I'm still looking for a simple solution.\nHaving said that, this is likely to work:\nBackup the system to Time Machine.  Boot into recovery mode and then erase the 1TB.  It should now appear as 1TB in Finder.  Then restore from Time Machine.\n...but ideally, there ought to be a quicker solution.\n", "Q: British Mac Keyboard - § and ` key the wrong way around I'm running High Sierra 10.13 on a Macbook Pro Touchbar 2017 with British keyboard.\nWhen at the desk I use a Corsair K70 mechanical keyboard set as British Mac layout.

I've checked Keyboard preferences and its set as British Mac keyboard, but the layout image is wrong, this is what I get:\n\nWhilst this is what my friend gets, and what I would expect (this one also matches a UK Mac keyboard layout whilst mine does not):\n\nThe keyboard on the Macbook itself works fine with the correct keys.\nI think this may have gone wrong when I installed the latest macos update.\nThe options panel offers very little flexibility, I've tried swapping to a US keyboard and deleting the British layout then adding it again but no luck. Anyone know how to correct this?\n\nA: Your machine thinks your keyboard is of the ANSI type when it is actually of the ISO type.  According to the article \"Fixing Keyboard Type Problems\":\n\nSometimes a machine will forget which type keyboard is attached, with the result that certain keys get transposed from what the user expects. The fix for this is run the Keyboard Setup Assistant again. Sometimes there is a button for \"Change Keyboard Type\" visible in System Preferences/Keyboard. If not, you can try trashing the file /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist\n\n\nAnother possibility may be to open Terminal and type:\n\nsudo open /System/Library/CoreServices/KeyboardSetupAssistant.app/Contents/MacOS/KeyboardSetupAssistant\n\n\nSometimes, when JIS is involved on a laptop, one may have to follow the procedures in the SMC Resetting instructions.

In the upper left of my iPhone 6 (iOS 11.0.3), I was surprised to see \"T-Zero\" instead of \"AT&T\". I was in the Messages app when I saw this. It changed back to \"AT&T\" after I pressed the home button to return to the home screen.\nSo I googled \"t-zero network on my iphone\" and the search results reminded me that I have an app called \"t-zero\" installed on my phone. I use it all the time but I had forgotten it was called that. I opened it to see if the network would change but it didn't.\nDid the T-Zero app change my network? Can apps do that? Or is it an iOS glitch?\n\nA: That \"T-Zero\" that was displayed was not a change to your network.\nSince iOS 9, when you switch directly from one app to another, for example by tapping a link to the App Store from Safari, it will show the previous app in the top left corner where your network would normally be displayed.\nIf you tap on the T-Zero up the top left it will bring you back to that app. It's there for quick multitasking — it does not affect your network settings at all. It just covers the area where your signal would be displayed. If you navigate elsewhere (such as by going to the home screen), or remove the app from multitasking, your network status will be displayed in that area again.\nApps cannot change your network settings like that unless you're using a jailbroken phone.\n", "Q: XCode Server not sending email notifications to committers whether the build has passed or not I have set a bot with post integration \"Periodic Email report\" but no reports are arriving at specified email address.

It seems that I have to click many times to dismiss them one by one. \nHow can they be dismissed all at once?\n\nA: You should be able to show the notification center (top-right icon, looks like a list), which shows you your historic notifications grouped by day.  There's a little x at the top right of each group, which dismisses the entire day's notifications.\n[\n", "Q: Bootcamp partition (Win7) won't boot on MBP mid-2012 I am using OS X 10.10.5 (Yosemite).\nRan out of room on ~60 GB Bootcamp NTFS partition of 250 GB SSD.

I have no headphones plugged in. \nMaybe related, I am also unable to get a sound notification, and for all calls I can’t hear the voice. I don't use a Bluetooth headset and I've never changed any settings. \nI've had this iPhone for just one week. Is this a hardware or software problem? If software, how do I resolve it?\n\nA: Always a good place to start is to shutdown and reboot your iPhone. If that doesn't work then it's time to investigate further.\nIf a reboot has no effect, is it possible that your iPhone is connecting to some sort of Bluetooth device? It may not necessarily be a headset (I know you said you don't use one) - it could be a speaker, a receiver, headphones, etc.\nThe next time this happens, the first thing I would do is go to Bluetooth settings at Settings > Bluetooth and check to see if any devices are listed there? If you see anything you don't recognise or ever want connected, tap on the blue ⓘ symbol on the right of it and select Forget This Device.\nAnother troubleshooting step you can take is to disable Bluetooth altogether for a while to see what difference, if any, that makes. Once again, you can do this at: Settings > Bluetooth.\nIf none of this helps, you could check your headphone socket to make sure it's clear of any debris. You can also plug some headphones in and see how your iPhone behaves and then unplug them again. \nFinally, you do have various Reset options available to you at Settings > General > Reset. You could start with the Reset Network Settings option (note this will reset Wi-Fi networks and passwords, mobile network settings, VPNs, etc.).\nOtherwise you could do a full backup of your iPhone and then do a full reset of all content and settings (also available at Settings > General > Reset).

I’ve downloaded the Apple System Diagnostics disk image and when I mount it I see another two disk images. One is ASD OS 3S150 and the other is ASD EFI 3S150. What’s the difference between the OS and EFI versions?\n\nA: For starters, ASD stands for Apple Service Diagnostics, not Apple System Diagnostics.\nObviously I can’t comment on how you obtained the ASD files, but if it’s from a reputable source (i.e. from Apple or one of its authorised partners) then it should already contain some PDFs on the disk image to help guide you. So, if you haven’t got these PDFs I’d really be hesitant on proceeding.\nAnother factor is that there isn’t just one Apple Service Diagnostic. There are many versions and each one is only compatible with certain models of Mac computer, so you’d want to be sure you’re getting what you bargained for (although if it’s the wrong one, it should give you a warning that it doesn’t support the machine you’re trying to run it on - assuming of course it’s a genuine version). In your case, ASD 3S150 supports all of the mid-2012 models of MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. So, if the computer you’re wanting to test isn’t one of them, then you've got the wrong ASD version.\nASD EFI v ASD OS\nThe first and most obvious difference between the two is that ASD EFI runs without an operating system, while ASD OS runs on a limited version of macOS. With these factors in mind:\n\n\n*\n\n*ASD EFI is better at some hardware diagnostics because it’s basically run from firmware. For example, if you’re using ASD OS then parts of RAM are being used by macOS and therefore cannot be tested, while this is not an issue with using ASD EFI.\n\n*ASD OS is better for running more advanced testing processes because having macOS present allows for multitasking and a higher load on some hardware.\n\n*ASD OS also allows for testing certain aspects of the hardware that ASD EFI can’t. For example, with ASD OS you can run tests that require user involvement, such as testing the trackpad which requires the user to actually touch it during testing, or testing for the presence of high speed USB devices in USB ports which require the user to connect a device into the port, or for testing an IR port which requires the user to press a button on an Apple Remote, and the list goes on.\nThere are other differences, but the above sums it up nicely in my opinion.\nSometimes you’ll need to use both, and sometimes one is enough. For example, if someone is having an issue that I suspect is related to RAM, then I just run the ASD EFI version. If that finds a problem with memory, then there’s really no need to run the ASD OS version. Likewise, if someone is having problems controlling their Mac with an Apple Remote, I’d run the ASD OS version instead to test that the IR Port is receiving a signal when the Apple Remote is being used.\nIn a nutshell, both have a role to play. And, depending on the scenario, they can be used independently or in conjunction with one another.\n", "Q: Is there a 5-second rewind button on iTunes?

The shortcut also works for VLC.\nI also have KMPlayer and 5KPlayer installed as alternative players, and the shortcut is easy to remember:left/right arrow for 5 second rewind/forward. \n\nA: There is not a dedicated button for this, but you can make one for yourself fairly easily.\nOpen Script Editor.app and add this to it:\n-- iTunes rewind 5 seconds\ntell application \"iTunes\" to set player position to (player position - 5)\n\nSave it to ~/Library/Scripts/ (where ~ is your Home directory)\nThen you can use FastScripts to assign it a global keyboard shortcut.\n(FastScripts allows for 10 free keyboard shortcuts. If you need more, it's $10. Or you could use Keyboard Maestro instead.)\nIf you want to make a rewind button, it's the same idea:\n-- iTunes Fast-Forward 30 seconds\ntell application \"iTunes\" to set player position to (player position + 30)\n\nSource: https://www.sixhat.net/applescript-how-to-skip-30rewind-10-seconds-in-itunes.html\n", "Q: How to remove a partition with terminal?

The HDMI display is connected to an HDMI Switcher which I use to connect different input devices to the HDMI display, like a RPi. \nEvery time I switch the input devices through the switcher away from the Mac mini, macOS deactivates dual display mode - all windows move to the DisplayPort display. When I switch back input to the Mac mini dual display support is re-activated and all windows move back.\nIs there any way to change this behavior? I would like to keep dual display mode going on even after switching the display input. Is this possible?\n\nA: The behavior  you are seeing is because the switch you are using is completely disconnecting the signal from the Mac so macOS assumes (rightly so) that they monitor is gone and it needs to consolidate the windows.\nIt would be as if you physically removed the cable from the Mac mini and plugged it into your other device.  \nTo get around this, you need an active device like a KVM (keyboard video mouse switcher) which will maintain the signal(s).  \nThough a KVM might be complete overkill if all you really want/need to change video inputs.  What may be the best solution is get a monitor with multiple inputs and you just change it on the monitor itself.\n", "Q: Mac OS Sierra keeps crashing all of a sudden (panic) Not always, but usually when I try to wake my Macbook Pro up from screen saver it panics.

Is it possible to set up an auto-reply to an incoming text or iMessage, either on my iPhone (or the connected Message app on my Mac)?\nIdeally I'd like to customize this depending upon the sender.\n\nA: Apple does not provide this on iOS 11 or earlier since there are automation hooks to send a message, but not to be notified and act upon incoming messages. The Workflow app is the first place I look on iOS to see if there are hooks, but since Apple bought that company - we'll see what happens with iOS automation and iOS 12. I wouldn't expect this is the sort of automation that Apple rolls out first, but I could be wrong on that speculation.\nOn macOS - you might have more luck with AppleScript and the Script Editor - there is a standard message suite that used to work with IRC / chat for received messaged. I would start on MacOS to script something if you don't mind leaving your Mac logged in, not sleeping and handing off the reply ability.\n\naddressed message received ve : This handler is called for incoming\n  messages that are addressed to you. If the handler returns a text\n  value, it will replace the incoming message. \naddressed message received text : The text of the incoming message   \n\nfrom buddy : The buddy who sent this message\nfor text chat\nwith text : A text description of the event\n\n\nThe buddy object would let you link this to the send assuming this triggers for iCloud messages in addition to old text messages. \nThe Messages app dictionary has a send command that accepts text so you should be able to make a simple script to send a stock message to a specific contact. The dictionary also has an event handler suite where received messages can be processed - so you could also test that.\nI don't know of anyone writing up code, but the basics look to be there on macOS but not on iOS.\n\nA: Although this solution will NOT allow you to change your response based on sender to the extend your might like it, you can still adjust some settings.\nNote: This solution is more of a workaround. \nIn iOS 11, Apple introduced Do Not Disturb While Driving.  In Settings>Do Not Disturb you can specify who you want to auto reply to (No One, Recents, Favorites, or All Contacts) and what you would like to say. If you choose Favorites, you can add favorites my going into the Phone app, Tapping one Favorites, and pressing the Plus button in the upper right corner. Finally, in Settings>Do Not Disturb>Activate, select Manually.\nTo activate/turn on & off your auto replier open control center by swiping up from the bottom of the screen and tap the Car icon to turn on DND While Driving.\nThe message you specify will be sent to the contacts your specify.\n", "Q: Mac Chrome Scrolling issue (followed many guides, none have worked, video showing problem included)) Please reference the video below, I created it using three different browsers and showing my settings and scrolling inputs so that either the Dev team can use this information to apply a patch or someone can guide me to a working answer.  \nI have been searching for day trying to disable two finger swipe (Horizontal) in chrome so that the browser will not navigate forward/back.

I am unsure why but the incognito build seems to be lacking this functionality, as i cannot drag the page to the right (Scroll left past the left bound of the web page) to trigger the back functionality. \n\nA: After explaining my situation to my co-worker and explaining that I was not experiencing these issues in Incognito, he pointed out that extensions are disabled in incognito.  This was my issue, I had an extension that was added a long time ago that affected scrolling, and google synced it with my new install.   If you are having these issues in this day and age, be sure to disable your extensions at Chrome://extensions and see if this resolves your issue! :) \n", "Q: Get fan speed from terminal without spindump or third party software I was wondering if there was a way to access the computer fan speed through terminal.

However, for some unknown reason a few weeks ago, this stopped happening: Even though they show up in \"Audiobooks\" on iTunes, they WILL NOT show up in iBooks anymore—they still appear in the Music app, like a regular mp3. Nothing I have tried will force it to show up in iBooks again.\nEdit, to clarify: The problem is that I add an MP3 audiobook to my iPhone via iTunes in the normal matter, but it shows up in \"Music\" and NOT \"iBooks\" EVEN THOUGH I set the file type as \"Audiobook.\" iTunes—on multiple computers!—correctly shows the audiobook, but not on the phone. Furthermore, I deleted an old audiobook on the phone yet iBooks STILL shows it!\nThis is on iOS 10.3.3, iTunes 12.7.1.14, and reconfirmed on iOS 11.2.2, iTunes 12.7.2.58.\n\nA: If I am understanding you correctly, you have MP3s which are audiobooks which exist in iTunes on a desktop/laptop and you want them to sync to a mobile device and be automatically available in iBooks the way they used to be, is that right?\nApple recently changed the way audiobooks sync between iBooks and iTunes. This support document lets you know how you can sync these files using iCloud which seems to be the way they are encouraging people to do this sort of thing now. In short\n\n\n*\n\n*iBooks must be turned on in iCloud settings on your Mac and your device\n\n*in iBook's general preferences you have to makes sure \"Sync bookmarks, highlights and collections across devices\" is checked\n\n*Make sure you don't have \"Hide iCloud Books\" selected from within whatever Collection you are viewing in iBooks\n\n\nAnd then when you sync you should see these files as \"downloadable from the cloud\" (i.e. with the little cloud icon next to them) and then you can tap to download.\nI think this is sort of a nutty workaround for what used to just work but seems to be how Apple is trying to get people to do what you are tying to do here.\n\nA: I realize this is an older question but just had the same issue myself and figured out how to solve it. This was the first thread that showed in Google when looking for the answer. So for anyone who happens across this issue here is what you do.\nIf you are trying to sync an audiobook from your computer to your iPhone you no longer use the \"iTunes\" app, now known simply as \"Music\".  Instead, you have to open the \"Books\" app and go through the same process. From Books you can select \"File, Add to library\" and upload the files the same way you would have in iTunes.  After that, return to the iPhone sync settings and the audiobook should be listed for you to sync. You can add the files to the \"Music\" app and have all the same settings checked but for some reason they never show up in sync.  The key is to add them through Books.\n\nA: There's a workaround for this.  Once mp3's are added to your iTunes library & marked as audiobooks (through the \"media kind\" option via /right click/ -> \"Get Info\" [multiple files selected] or \"Song Info\" [single file selected]), you can sync audiobooks manually as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*plug your iPhone into your Mac\n\n*access the device through iTunes on your Mac\n\n*click on the Audiobooks tab under Settings, on the left-hand panel under the device name\n\n*in the resulting right-hand window, you should see the audiobook title, with an empty checkbox next to it\n\n*above that, at the top of the window, there will be an option to Sync Audiobooks, with two options underneath: All audiobooks & Selected audiobooks.  Check whichever you want.\n\n*Re-sync your iPhone\nThe audiobook should now turn up in your iBooks app under Audiobooks, same as before.  I hope this solves your problem!\n", "Q: If \"Reset Keyboard Dictionary\" does not reset some words, what supplies them? There are some previously unanswered questions about \"Reset Keyboard Dictionary\" (in Settings) not resetting the autocorrect for specific words. (In my case [iOS 11], the letter \"i\" converts to \"A\" and a unicode character... and by the way, a manual shortcut override appears to be the only fix.)\nSo if the issue is not caused by the Keyboard Dictionary, what other plugins could be providing this erroneous autocorrection? Do other apps contribute words to the dictionary? And is there any other way to remove them from the dictionary without wiping the whole phone?\n\nA: iOS comes with a built-in dictionary/replacements which can't be modified (without jailbreaking). This is why the workaround is to add a shortcut, because it's up to Apple to release a software update to resolve the issue.\n", "Q: Missing Lyrics option in Music app in iOS 11.1 I recently upgraded to iOS 11.1 and none of my songs are giving me the options to play lyrics. Has this feature been removed or the option to display them been changed?\n\n\nA: This is a known bug in iOS 11.1+ (11.2 and 11.2.5). There is an Apple Discussion with over 1250 users saying they are having that issue. I am not sure if there is an open Radar ticket for this bug.\nUpdate: Fixed in iOS 11.4.\n\nA: With the update to iOS 11.1 (I'm not sure exactly when this change landed), the Music app will now contextually show lyrics depending on if they are available.\nThey will show up directly above Up Next Category.\n\nA: You can find the instructions to view lyrics of the currently playing song in the Apple Support Article, View lyrics in Apple Music.\n\nOn your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Android phone\nWhile listening to a song, tap or swipe up on the player at the bottom of the screen to open Now Playing.

Apparently, CorelDraw software didn't provide MacOS support for nearly 15 years.\nI have tried the free Inkscape, but it didn't work for me. The file would open, but the content was not displayed properly. I am open to other suggestions in form of software.\nPerhaps there is a way to reliably convert the files to another format for which there is free alternative for MacOS that can be used to view the contents of the file. \n\nA: You can check out this free option: CDRViewer. It will allow you to open/view CorelDraw files.\nFor more advanced functionality, the same developers offer PrintLab Studio 3.\nYou can also visit the developer's direct website at: http://blue-tail.com\nNOTE: I have no affiliation whatsoever with the developer or this product.\n[EDIT]\nJust thought I should add that Adobe Illustrator has always been capable of opening CorelDraw files.

Right-clicking on the Finder background and clicking \"Clean up by name\" sorts them into the order \"1.0\", \"1.5\", \"1.6\", \"1.25\", \"1.56\", and \"2.0\". This is quite annoying, because that's neither in any lexicographic order (as I'd expected) nor in increasing numerical order, so it always takes a moment to find the right subfolder I want. What order does \"Clean up by name\" sort files into?\nOS X Yosemite v10.10.5\n\nA: Selecting Clean Up By Name sorts things by alphanumeric order1. \nUsing your example, you're actually mistaken in saying that the items aren't listed in some sort of increasing numerical order. The order you provided is:\n 1.0, 1.5, 1.6, 1.25, 1.56, and 2.0.\n\nHowever, the 4th and 5th values above can be interpreted as one point twenty-five and one point fifty-six. So, 25 is larger than 6, and 56 is larger than 25, and so on.\nBy way of comparison, MS Windows does the same thing.\nSo, why does this happen? \nWell, just like databases and spreadsheets, most operating systems use strings to store data, in this case filenames.  Normally this works pretty well, but in examples like yours it is counterintuitive and that's why many people end up using naming conventions that add zeros to a filename (for example, instead of 1.5 it'd be 1.50 instead).\nRecently I had to set up a workflow for an organisation that was going to produce an animation every Wednesday for the next three years. They wanted their files to be called NewsImage1, NewsImage2, etc. I had to explain to them it needed to be NewsImage001, NewsImage002 and so on so that by the time they were finished the animations would still be listed in order from NewsImage001 to NewsImage156. (If it were up to me the filenames would have used a dating scheme such as NewsImage201701 and so on, but alas it wasn't my call).\nThis sorting is also known to cause problems in certain industries, but as far as I know the only workaround in macOS is to add the zeroes to filenames as I've described above. In Windows you used to be able to manually edit a registry key, but I'm not sure that's still possible.\nFor what it's worth, I've always thought it should be an option in System Preferences somewhere, but I suspect it's not provided for compatibility purposes.\n1 By Alphanumeric I mean it's a combination of alphabetic (Latin) characters and numeric (Arabic) digits that also takes into account symbols (e.g. punctuation marks, mathematical signs, etc). So, ordering works on the basis of symbols/special characters first, followed by numerals in order, followed by letters in order. I do not recall the order of sorting for the special characters, but for numerals anything after a decimal point is a whole number as opposed to a fraction. By this I mean that 1.1 is lower than 1.2, however 1.15 is higher than 1.2 because the '15' in 1.15 is seen as fifteen and the '2' in 1.2 is seen as two (not as twenty).\n", "Q: Preview App bug - \"Highlight\" shortcut not working normally I'm not able to use \"Highlight\" shortcut. No matter I press control+command+h or control+command+u, it results in underlining text. Clicking the \"Highlight\" button also underlines text. I can highlight text using highlight with specific though. \nBut it's quite inconvenient that I am not able to use shortcut to highlight. How could I fix it?\n\n\nA: Try clicking the highlight button (while not having any text highlighted) and select the highlight colour. It'll show a check mark beside the one you choose. Then unclick it and try the highlight shortcut again and it should make the default that colour highlight.\n\nA: I just find you can select no text then change default highlight type. So it's not a bug and problem solved.\n\nA: There is no need to use any shortcut command ... its direct... just keep the highlight selected and u can highlight text by just double finger drag...\n \n", "Q: Does Macbook Pro protect itself from heat? Mine is a Macbook Pro 15-inch Late-2013.\nI read somewhere that the laptop protects itself from damage by shutting itself down when it gets too hot.\nMy laptop's temperature, currently at its highest is 95ºC.\nThe Apple website said that it's maximum operating temperature is 35ºC. \nI'm using Macs Fan Control, to tell me the temperature.\nhttps://support.apple.com/kb/sp690?locale=en_GB <-- where temperature is stated\n\nA: Short answer\nYes.\nLong answer\nBy Operating Temperature Apple are not referring to the internal temperature of the MacBook Pro. Instead, they are referring to the temperature of the environment in which you're using (i.e. operating) the MacBook Pro. \nThat's not to say you couldn't use your MBP outside on a hot 35ºC day, but you may run into problems and, if you do, that's when the System Management Controller (SMC) will kick in to protect your MBP.\nBy the way, your MBP temp of 95ºC is perfectly fine. MBP models usually range from about 40ºC (104ºF) to 100ºC (212ºF) depending on whether the CPU is idle or under load. The SMC is designed to monitor a range of sensors and to manage tasks such as fan speeds etc to ensure your MBP is protected from damage by overheating.\nIf you're interested, you can also refer to the Intel Mac Temperature Database to see the various temperature ranges reported by users. \n", "Q: How can I have 1805 threads when I only have 4 virtual CPUs? I was wondering if someone could explain to me how in my Activity Monitor it says that I currently have 1805 threads \nBut I only have 4 virtual cores on my computer (which means that I should only be able to have 4 threads). Does the thread count mean all the threads that are being handled by the CPUs when they are deciding which thread to execute?\nEDIT: The reason I think that there can only be 4 threads on my machine comes from this answer. I believe that my misunderstanding stems from the word 'thread' being used in a different context.\n\nA: In the old days - memory wasn't virtualized or protected and any code could write anywhere. In those days a one thread to one CPU design made sense. In the decades since that, memory first was protected and then virtualized. Think of threads as virtual cores - kind of a promise that at some time when your data and code was ready, that thread gets pushed (or scheduled as the PHD engineers and mathmeticians that do research on scheduling algorithms call it) onto an actual CPU to do actual work.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/%7Ercs/research/interactive_latency.html\n\nNow - due to the magnitudes of difference in timing - the CPU and cache operate so fast compared to getting data from storage or the network - that thousands of threads could come and go while one thread is waiting for www.google.com to deliver a packet or two of data so that's the reason why you see so many more threads than actual CPU.\nIf you convert the thread operations which happen on the black / blue time scale and convert them to one second = 1 ns, things we care about are more like disk IO take 100 microseconds are like 4 days and a 200 ms internet round trip is a 20 year delay if you're counting seconds on the CPU time scale. Like many powers of ten exercises, in almost all cases - the CPU sits idle for \"months\" waiting for meaningful work from a very, very slow external world.\nNothing seems amiss in the image you posted so perhaps we're misunderstanding what you are getting at by wondering about threads.\nIf you right click (control click) on the word threads in the header row at top, add the status of the app and you will see most threads are likely idle, sleeping, not running at any given moment. \n\nA: Scheduling\nYour 1,805 threads do not run simultaneously. They trade off. One core runs a bit of the thread, then sets it aside to execute a bit of another thread. The other cores do the same. Round and round, threads execute a little bit at a time, not all at once.\nA major responsibility of the operating system (Darwin and macOS) is the scheduling of which thread is to be executed on which core for how long. \nMany threads have no work to do, and so are left dormant and unscheduled. Likewise, many threads may be waiting on some resource such as data to be retrieved from storage, or a network connection to be completed, or data to be loaded from a database. With almost nothing to do but check the status of the awaited resource, such threads are scheduled quite briefly if at all.\nThe app programmer can assist this scheduling operation by sleeping her thread for a certain amount of time when she knows the wait for the external resource will take some time. And if running a “tight” loop that is CPU-intensive with no cause to wait on external resources, the programmer can insert a call to volunteer to be set aside briefly so as to not hog the core and thereby allow other threads to execute.\nFor more detail, see the Wikipedia page for multithreading.\nSimultaneous Multi-Threading\nAs for your linked Question, threads there are indeed the same as here. \nOne issue there is the overhead cost of switching between threads when scheduled by the OS. There is a significant cost in time to unload the current thread’s instructions and data from the core and then load next scheduled thread ’s instructions and data. Part of the operating system’s job is to try to be smart in scheduling the threads as to optimize around this overhead cost.\nSome CPU makers have developed technology to cut this time so as to make switching between a pair of threads much faster. Intel calls their technology Hyper-Threading. Known generically as simultaneous multi-threading (SMT).\nWhile the pair of threads does not actually execute simultaneously, the switching is so smooth and fast that both threads appear to be virtually simultaneous. This works so well that the each core presents itself as a pair of virtual cores to the OS. So a SMT enabled CPU with four physical cores, for example, will present itself to the OS as an eight-core CPU. \nDespite this optimization, there is still some overhead to switching between such virtual cores. Too many CPU-intensive threads all clamoring for execution time to be scheduled on a core can make the system inefficient, with no one thread getting much work done. Like three balls on a playground being shared between nine kids, versus sharing between nine hundred kids where no one kid really gets any serious playtime with a ball. \nSo there is an option in the CPU firmware where a sysadmin can throw a switch on the machine to disable SMT if she decides it would benefit her users running an app that is unusually CPU-bound with very few opportunities for pausing. \nIn such a case we come back to your original Question: In this special situation you would indeed want to constrain the operations to have no more of these hyper-active threads than you have physical cores. But let me repeat: this is an extremely unusual situation that might occur in something like a specialized scientific data-crunching project but would almost never apply to common business/corporate/enterprise scenarios.\n\nA: You don't ask the arguably more fundamental question, \"How can I have 290 processes when my CPU only has four cores?\" This answer is a bit of history, which might help you understand the big picture, even though the specific question has already been answered. As such, I'm not going to give a TL;DR version.\nOnce upon a time (think, 1950s–'60s), computers could only do one thing at a time. They were very expensive, filled whole rooms, and we needed a way to make efficient use of them by sharing them between multiple people.  The first way of doing this was batch processing, in which users would submit tasks to the computer and they'd be queued up, executed one after another and the results would be sent back to the user.  That was OK but it did mean that, if you wanted to do a calculation that was going to take a couple of days, nobody else could use the computer during that time.\nThe next innovation (think, 1960s–'70s) was time-sharing. Now, instead of executing the whole of one task, then the whole of the next one, the computer would execute a bit of one task, then pause it and execute a bit of the next one, and so on. Thus, the computer would give the impression that it was executing multiple processes concurrently. The great advantave of this is that now you can run a calculation that will take a couple of days and, although it will now take even longer, because it keeps getting interrupted, other people can still use the machine during that time.\nAll of this was for huge mainframe-style computers.  When personal computers started to become popular, they initially weren't very powerful and, hey, since they were personal it seemed OK for them to only be able to do one thing&nbdp;– run one application – at once (think, 1980s). But, as they became more powerful (think, 1990s to present), people wanted their personal computers to time-share, too.\nSo we ended up with personal computers that gave the illusion of running multiple processes concurrently by actually running them one at a time for brief periods and then pausing them.  Threads are essentially the same thing: eventually, people wanted even individual processes to give the illusion of doing multiple things concurrently. At first, the application writer had to handle that themself: spend a little while updating the graphics, pause that, spend a little while calculating, pause that, spend a little while doing something else, ...\nHowever, the operating system was already good at managing multiple processes, it made sense to extend it to manage these sub-processes, which are called threads. So, now, we have a model where every process (or application) contains at least one thread, but some contain several or many. Each of these threads corresponds to a somewhat independent subtask.\nBut, at the top level, the CPU is still only giving the illusion that these threads are all running at the same time.  In reality, it's running one for a little bit, pausing it, choosing another to run for a little bit, and so on.  Except that modern CPUs can run more than one thread at once. So, in the real reality, the operating system is playing this game of \"run for a bit, pause, run something else for a bit, pause\" on all the cores simultaneously. So, you can have as many threads as you (and your application designers) want but, at any moment in time, all but a few of them will actually be paused.\n", "Q: Popup screen becomes full screen when application is full screen I am using Eclipse.

I have a 2017 27\" iMac with a 4.2 GHz Intel Core i7. It's been having some issues lately where every now and then the entire system will gradually freeze, forcing me to hard reboot the computer. So to see if there's a hardware issue, I started running prime95 in stress test mode to see if any errors were detected.\nAfter running for about 20 minutes, I checked the core temperature readings for my CPU and they were all hovering around 95 C. Ordinarily I'd think that's way too hot but with the design of the iMac I'm not sure. I stopped prime95 and after my system was idle for a little while the core temperatures are now hovering around 60 C.\nIs that temperature too hot, or is this normal for an iMac?\nedit: After the system was idling all night the temperature went down to 45 C, which is of course a good idle temperature. So no worries there.\nedit 2: After doing more research I've discovered this is a widespread issue with the Intel Core i7-7700k, and affects all iMacs that have it. Apparently Intel claims its temperature spiking to 90 C during normal use and hitting 100 C during heavy use is normal. Seems wrong to me, but who am I to argue with Intel?\n\nA: Reaching a temp of 95°C is not surprising if the CPU is under heavy load for a prolonged period.\nPrime95 can be useful for determining stability, but I'm not particularly a fan of it as a troubleshooting/diagnostic tool. The reason it's popular  for stability testing is because users will overclock their CPUs and then need a way to test how stable they are afterwards. So, for me, prime95 is the wrong tool for the job you're trying to perform (but that's a personal opinion). However, if you're wanting to use it, then you need to run it for at least 3hrs. If your iMac continues to run it without error, then it's passed the test.\nIf you're particularly concerned about your hardware, I'd start with using Apple Diagnostics to test your machine.\nRun Apple Diagnostics\nFollow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your iMac\n\n*Restart your iMac\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. \nAssuming the iMac passes this without error, I'd be more inclined to test your hardware in Safe Mode to see if you can recreate the issues you're having. If you can't, then you know it's most likely a software issue relating to a login item, corrupted font, or kernel extension.\nFor more info on Safe Mode, refer to: Use safe mode to isolate issues with your Mac.\n\nA: I also have a 27\" 5K iMac, though mine is a Late 2015 model, so the generation before yours. I have the (at the time) top end 4.0GHz i7 6700K processor (it's officially 4.0GHz with \"turbo boost\" to 4.2GHz, but in practice according to iStatMenus mine never exceeds 4.0GHz). \nThe 4 cores' DTS temperature readings very rapidly reach their design maximum of 99 degrees C under full load. I mean within a few seconds. Then the CPU frequency automatically throttles back to prevent overheating. Because of this, I don't believe I am getting the full performance that this CPU is capable of (benchmark results are way below the same CPU's typical performance in a PC or Hackintosh). I think the iMac has completely inadequate cooling for these very high performance CPUs to run at full speed.\nThe following image shows the iStatMenus sensor list when my CPU is fully loaded on all 8 virtual cores. Of particular relevance are the \"CPU Core (1/2/3/4) - DTS\", which are all varying between 98-100C, the overall \"CPU Cores\" figure at 99C (I believe this is the one used to decide when to throttle back the overall frequency to keep it under 100C), and the Fan which is running at full speed. \n\nAnd here is Intel's own Power Gadget software showing how rapidly the temperature rises after the onset of load, followed shortly afterwards by the frequency being reduced to about 3.8GHz and remaining there.\n\nIn conclusion: Yes, it is normal for an iMac, but it's not ideal. These high-end i7s produce a lot of heat, and the iMac simply can't get rid of it fast enough. IMO it's disingenuous of Apple to sell iMacs with CPUs that they claim can run at 4+ GHz when in fact they can't for more than a few seconds because the cooling is inadequate.\nOn the matter of why your Mac is slowing down, I highly recommend full-time use of an on-screen sensor program such as iStatMenus. It enables you to keep an eye on what your Mac is doing at all times, and quickly identify the cause of any slowdown - often these can be due to I/O load rather than CPU.\n\nA: YES\n95° under load is reasonable given a few characteristics.\n\n\n*\n\n*100% CPU load generates a huge amount of heat\n\n*depending on how long it's at 100%, CPU can easily reach 90°+\n\n\nHowever\nTaking a temperature reading after a stress test will lead to misleading results. The CPU is still generating heat, so it may take a long time to cool down after a stress test.\n\nA: This app works great. You can set two temp points to keep your processor between the two ranges and avoid system throttling. You'd be surprised how ramping the fans up can improve temps and performance!

In settings \"security\" I can change the 'allow applications downloaded from' to \"verified sources\" ('anywhere' is not available at all) but when I jump back to main settings and again to this security it is changed back to \"App Store\". It doesn't saves my setting! \n\nA: I found the solution to this error (btw. the error message is \"____ file is damaged and can't be opened. You should put it to trashbin.\"):\nThe gatekeeper function on Sierra is a bit altered and the last option \"From any source\" is not available for security settings. So I had to run this command in terminal:\nsudo spctl --master-disable\n\nNow the option \"from any source\" is available for gatekeeper. After I selected this option the files became available again.\n\nA: I had a similar problem.  Apple had me re-install High Sierra, which fixed the problem.\n", "Q: sfltool add-item (to add Finder favorite) stopped working on High Sierra I just noticed my normal command line command to add an item to Finder's favorites doesn't work anymore.\nE.g. to add the Desktop to Finder's sidebar, I used to do: \nsfltool add-item com.apple.LSSharedFileList.FavoriteItems file:///Users/MyUserName/Desktop && killall Finder\n\nHowever, now, it seems it doesn't do anything anymore except showing the output:\nUsage: sfltool archive|list-info|list [options]\n\nI also noticed that the file extension of ~/Library/Application\\ Support/com.apple.sharedfilelist/com.apple.LSSharedFileList.FavoriteItems has changed from .sfl to .sfl2. \nDoes anyone yet know how to programmatically add a favorite item to Finder's sidebar in macOS High Sierra? \nPS: I did find some solutions using a Swift script, yet I'd rather be able to just use a simple command line tool as before..\n\nA: Apple officially killed it :(\n\nApologies, we do not plan to add back the feature. You will need to write a tool that does what’s needed.\n\nhttps://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=4985135170584576\n\nA: An optional replacement is mysides, which I can confirm works just fine on Mojave. However it's not (yet) installable via Brew, so limited programmatically, but I'll be seeing if I can change that today.\nUpdate: I went ahead and created a brew cask for it, which should suffice for making it completely \"programmatic\" once that is approved/merged. \n", "Q: Stop MacBook from installing applications for multiple user accounts I have multiple user accounts on my MacBook. At the moment all of my applications go to a root folder and then there are separate folders for my user accounts.\nI'm having a problem with application becoming corrupt because they are being shared between users.\nIs there any way to stop this functionality so user accounts have completely separate applications?\n\nA: Applications should be installed in the root /Applications folder by default.  This would not cause the \"executable\" to become corrupt when used by mutliple users, .  However if you want to install an application so that only one user can use it, said application should be installed under /Users/myuser/Applications\nSometimes during install you can chose where an application will be installed, other times installers will default to the /Applications  \nNote that there will be some applications that require that they be installed in /Applications and will not function properly if they are moved into other folders or sub folders.\nApple mandates that ~/Applications and /Applications be equivalent for the function of apps, but not all of them obey the rules or potentially are aware of them. Same with user folders being stored on another volume than the OS - that's supposed to be fully supported, but sometimes it isn't.\n", "Q: I dropped my iphone and now it smells weird My iphone 5 fell around 40ft down a stairwell, the screen got smashed and the touchscreen hardware appears to have partially popped out. The phone still works, but it has a very strong smell. Should I be concerned?\n\nA: Yes - moderate concern is warranted. Even from a fall from 3 feet / 1 meter, the lithium battery could get damaged and overheat and cause plastic to melt. A wire or board could short circuit as well. Worst case, you have a fire that ignites and releases not safe for human smoke and chemicals in addition to the idea you have a fire where you don't want one.\nYour drop was so far, it’s amazing anything works so please get it checked out or take immediate steps to prevent a fire. \nIf you can power it off and disconnect from any charger, that would let you know if it cools off and stops making odors. I would probably keep it in a safe place if you can't watch it or get it to someone that knows electronics / repairs iPhones.\nIt could be coincidence and nothing, but I'd rather not risk it not being able to see pictures or know what may have moved / broken inside.\n", "Q: iOS System Services > Time & Location uses excessive cellular data. Why? How to disable? Since iOS 11 update I noticed that my iPhone 6s started to drain cellular traffic very fast. Before, I was able to keep within 500 MB per month but now 1 GB is not enough. \nI looked at the settings and noticed: the traffic is mostly drained by the system services. And not by the analytics but by the \"Time & Location\". Surprisingly, isn't it?\nHere is the stats for last 10 days:\n\n\n*\n\n*479 MB totally\n\n*308 MB for system services\n\n*261 MB for time & location\n\n*26.6 MB for push notifications\n\n\nHere is some screenshots:\n\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\nThe first question is How the f.. they do it?\nI'll not be a lier if I say that I'm paranoid about this. Look, I spent only 171 MB for messengers, maps, social networks and browsing. Why time and locations use so much traffic? 261 (two hundred and sixty-eight) MB!!! What are they downloading? A sound recorded 24/7? Or videos a videos of me?\nTime is so simple to synchronise through the NTP. I can't believe that it can take more then a kilobyte. And there is no need to sync time more then once per month.\nLocation is simply provided by GPS. No cellular data required at all. But even if Apple want to track each my step it can't take more then 1 MB of text data per day.\nSo, it's a big mystery where is my traffic sucked in. Apple, please, collect your data using Wi-Fi.\nAnd the second practical question is about how to fix this trouble\nI noticed a similar question: Disable system services to save data\nI have disabled some of items in Settings > Privacy > Location Services > System Services. I don't want to disable the other such as \"Find My iPhone\" because I think they are important.\nI currently use a very simple solution: I'm turning of the cellular data when I don't need it and turn it on to check messages, for example. But if forget I can easily lose 50 MB for a night.\n\nA: Well @grgarside was right. The problem was not in the system itself but in a bike tracker app which use Location Services excessively. I figured it out by disabling Location for all the apps and then enabling them one by one. Now I think I need to contact the developer of that app and the question is closed.\n\nA: I know this was already answered but I wanted to post a solution I found (for another root cause). \nIn summary, I have a hidden wifi SSID saved on my iPhone.  I reset my network configuration on the iPhone and my data usage on location services dropped to normal ranges. \nMy theory is iOS will always search for saved hidden wifi SSIDs, even when you’re not in range. That is the nature of using a hidden SSID. Combine that with iOS using Location Services for wifi search and you may have some excessive data. \nIt worked for me, your mileage may vary, but here are the steps:\nMake sure you know all your wifi passwords before doing this. \n\n\n*\n\n*if your wifi router is using a hidden SSID, change it to broadcast (it’s actually more secure - google it)\n\n*reset the network setting on your iPhone (settings, general,reset,reset network settings). \n\n*setup your wifi again on the iPhone \n\n*Reset your cellular statistics and monitor over the next few days. \n\n", "Q: Force mounting an external disk that is not recognized I recently bought a 4 TB naked (no enclosure) external hard drive that I mount via a Newer Tech dock (the ones where you insert the naked drive like bread in a toaster) and is connected to my MacBook pro via FireWire 800.\nAbout a month later I wanted to use the drive and it would not mount.\nDisk Utility reports that it is \"Not Mounted\".\nWhen I connect the drive I get this:\n\n\nThe disk you inserted was not readable by this computer.\n\nSo I tried terminal commands like:\ndiskutil list\n\nwhich yelds this:\n\n\nI also tried:\nmount force /dev/disk3\n\nand got:\nmount: You must specify a filesystem type with -t.\nand then:\nmount force -t Apple_HFS /dev/disk3\n\nwhich outputs:\nusage: mount [-dfruvw] [-o options] [-t external_type] special node\n   mount [-adfruvw] [-t external_type]\n   mount [-dfruvw] special | node\n\nI also tried:\ndiskutil repairVolume /dev/disk3\n\nwhich gives back:\nError starting file system repair for disk3: Unrecognized file system (-69846)\n\nand finally:\nsudo gpt -r show /dev/disk3\n\nwhich returns:\n\nI am at a loss, can anyone give me some advice on how to mount this drive?\n\nA: Just when I was about to give up, format the drive and lose my data, somehow I was able to fix the drive so I am posting what exactly I did in terminal for the benefit of other people who might come across this post and have the same problem.

It happened without me knowing and I have no idea how to check what that is.\nCould you tell me what that is and if I can remove it using Terminal? Or without having to install other programs?\n\nA: While grg's answer is correct, I would like to point out that both the ‘Preboot’ and  ‘Recovery’ volumes may contain files that are no longer needed. This occurs when a volume containing macOS stored in the APFS container is deleted. The files stored in the hidden ‘Preboot’ and  ‘Recovery’ volumes, that are associated with deleted volume, may remain.  \nFor example, when entering the command diskutil list on my Mac, I get the following output regarding an APFS container.\n/dev/disk1 (synthesized):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +451.5 GB   disk1\n                                 Physical Store disk0s3\n   1:                APFS Volume Snapper                 291.9 GB   disk1s1\n   2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 47.1 MB    disk1s2\n   3:                APFS Volume Recovery                522.7 MB   disk1s3\n   4:                APFS Volume VM                      8.6 GB     disk1s4\n\nThe ‘Snapper’ volume contains macOS Mojave. The the volume UUID for this volume can be determined by entering the command diskutil info disk1s1 | grep \"Volume UUID\". The output is shown below.\n   Volume UUID:               47A8A135-5137-3651-90DB-5CE5C5D185C9\n\nEntering the command diskutil mount disk1s2 produces the following output.\nVolume Preboot on disk1s2 mounted\n\nThe command ls  /Volumes/Preboot/ produces the following directories (folders).\n47A8A135-5137-3651-90DB-5CE5C5D185C9    94C10540-E411-4520-B856-882C85E39002\n\nSince the directory named 47A8A135-5137-3651-90DB-5CE5C5D185C9 matches the volume UUID of the ‘Snapper’ volume, this directory should not be deleted. However, the directory named 94C10540-E411-4520-B856-882C85E39002 does not match the volume UUID of any volume in the APFS container and therefore can be deleted.\n\nA: A standard macOS startup APFS container does contain additional volumes to the volume with macOS installed on it. You can list these with diskutil apfs list. The standard configuration of such a container is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*disk1s1, the volume you boot from, mounted at /, shown in Disk Utility as Macintosh HD\n\n*disk1s2, ‘Preboot’, not mounted, hidden\n\n*disk1s3, ‘Recovery’, not mounted, hidden\n\n*disk1s4, ‘VM’, mounted at /private/var/vm, hidden\n\n\nThe last 3 are grouped as Other Volumes in Disk Utility. They're required by macOS and shouldn't be removed.\n", "Q: Macbook Pro stuck after I enter my password For last 2 days I am not able to login to my MacBook Pro. It was working fine and suddenly for no reason after I last shutdown my mac I am not able to login.\nThe mac starts up fine and goes to the login screen. After I enter my password the progress bar is stuck in 70%-80% and sometimes at 100%.\nI tried resetting NVRAM and SCM but it didn't help.\nI also tried following the steps mentioned in Justin Silver’s blog post but it also didn't help.\nAs mentioned in the post, I moved all the 3rd Party items from /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Library/Extensions to /Volumes/Macintosh\\ HD/Library/ExtensionsDisabled.

I even tried login in Single User or Verbose mode but I am not able to do so.\nCan anyone help me to fix this.\n\nA: I know this might not be an option for you is not really a solution... But what I did is to reinstall the OS by entering into Recovery Mode with Command + R right after pressing the power button, same as you would do with safe mode.\nI didn't lose my files by doing so, but it took 3 hours more or less for the installation to be completed. Let me know if you found another way.\n\nA: I found a solution for this problem by robertk1 and he writes the following:\n\nI would enter my password correctly and then the cursor would change to the spinning pinwheel and just sit there forever. The only way out was a power off reboot.\n\nThis is exactly what happend with my machine and it looks like it's same with yours. I hope this also works with FileVault enabled. There are two ways to solve this. With and without a guest account.\nIn case you do have access to the guest account follow these steps by hijoncon:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Login as guest\n  \n*Open Terminal (cmd + space then search terminal)\n  \n*Enter su your_account\n  \n*Enter your password\n  \n*sudo find /private/var/folders | grep com.apple.LaunchServices | grep csstore\n  \n*Remove every .csstore your find like this sudo rm /private/var/folders/cd/someLongRandomNameHere/someFolderNumberHere/com.apple.LaunchService-whatever.csstore\n\nIf you don't have access to the guest account you can try different ways to get into the machine (like SSH) robertk1 suggests:\n\nTo do this, you'll either need to be in a recovery console, or ssh\n  into the machine, or boot from an external drive, or otherwise somehow\n  get to a command prompt.\n\nOnce you are in the machine you can delete the files like described above in the last steps.\n\nA: Try this:\nFill the password as usual, but don't hit enter yet. Hold the options button and then click the login arrow button.\nI've been stuck for a while now, finally this solved, a method in which I introduced the options button. Hope this helps. \n\nA: You can still log into Safe Mode, even with File Vault enabled, and that’s exactly what I’d try next if I was you.\nThe only difference is that you’ll probably be asked to log in twice: once to unlock the startup disk, and again to log in to the Finder.\nFull instructions below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac \n\n*Restart your Mac \n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: Since you \nhave FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice). \n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. can you login okay?) \n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal and see if you can login now \n\n", "Q: Seamless title bar and terminal background?

It's very annoying to see while I'm using it. When the screen is turned off, I see it as in the picture below. But when it's turned on, I see it as very small water-ish drops.\nI tried to clean it using water, screen cleaner, and even alcohol, but it didn't go away.\nAlso that area doesn't feel as smooth as the unaffected area. So, I think it's on the outside of my screen not inside.\nHave you ever seen this before? Any suggestions on how to remove it without the need of replacing the whole screen?\n\n\nA: I've encountered something similar before and from the looks of it, the glass/plastic coating is etched.\nA user once tried to clean their screen with acetone (nail polish remover) and it physically damaged the glass coating.  In the pre-Retina days, the glass was replaceable so it wasn't a costly fix.\nUnfortunately, for the 2015 models, the glass and LCD are glued together so you will need to replace the entire assembly. \nIFixit.com has an excellent guide on replacing the display assembly.  It's not difficult, per se, it's time consuming and you must exercise a good bit of diligence (it's not something you going to speed through) when disconnecting the components as they can be damaged.  If this is not your cup of tea, have a pro do it for you.  Read the guide anyway, this way you know what to expect of the tech that does the work.\n\nA: I also experienced these stains on my late 2013 MacBook Pro. And I am upset to say that there's no solution to fix them.\nHave you ever heard of the Staingate incident? Strange kind of stains appear on the screens of particular models of mbp due to harsh cleaning, or simply just cleaning, or (the worst) doing nothing. Many users claim that these stains appeared on their mbp even if they don't clean their screens that much.\nFor some models, Apple offers a free screen replacement for mbp's even if their warranty is expired. You can ask Apple if your computer is eligible for that replacement program. (Mine was eligible, its warranty was over but they offered me a free replacement anyway.)\nUseful links:\nhttp://www.staingate.org \nhttps://9to5mac.com/2017/02/24/retina-macbook-display-staingate/\n\nA: Step 1.\nTake to Apple - they will replace IF you fall under 3 year (possibly 4 year window as I believe it was extended.)\nStep 2. \nFailing step 1. You can try / (go all in) with Listerine mouth wash - clear version is preferable. I've had some success today (not entirely successful but 87% better), still a bit more to go. \nFOREWARNING. \nThis will remove some/most/possibly? all the reflecting coating from screen.  Just power down mac. \nApply a tiny dab of clear Listerine to a baby clothe and rub rigorously. \nWARNING \nUsing a household clothe could result in scratches to screen.\nInvest in the softest baby cloth money can buy / or use the iPhone screen wipe you get with iPhone /iPad. You need to press hard / really hard / but not so hard that you damage the LCD crystals. It was the first time in my life where the whole wax on / wax off meant anything as the screen lamination is kind of waxy. rubbing back and forth. You need to dry it / wet it for it lamination to budge. For some users - it maybe too soon in the deterioration process. Be patient it's likely to take a few sessions. \nINSTRUCTION VIDEO \nWARNING - DO NOT TIP the bottle of liquid onto screen like this guy.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAKVTjjEmZw\nN.B.

Thanks for the support. \nNote: Upgrading to a later version of macOS is not an option in this case - please do not suggest this as a solution.\n\nA: You could install 10.8.5 clean on an external drive and just install the opera version you hope to use and test in a clean os. If that fails, you’ll know the program opera had a timer of sorts and can pursue disabling or modifying opera. \nIf it works, you can then migrate all your settings / apps / data (except opera) to the new os and test. Then restore that image over the broken internal install. \nSplitting the troubleshooting up will save you time isolating and testing without risking your current setup that you wish to remain without an upgrade for reasons. \n\nA: Interestingly enough the process of downgrading Opera stops only when you reach version 37 (from 42) which by the way doesn't feature a VPN. \nAlternatively, you could just re-install OSX 10.8.5 on an external HD (or a partition of the same HD) and see if Opera 42 is still not working. \n", "Q: I'm finding my iMac 21\" late 2015 to be unstable after upgrading to High Sierra If I leave my iMac for a while, it refuses to come out of sleep mode; the screen remains black, the mouse, once it unfreezes moves slowly and then the pinwheel appears forever. I'm forced to force power down (pressing the button). \nTo explain :\nI've just bought a reconditioned \"as new\" 21\" iMac which came with High Sierra, but unfortunately the setup was all in German despite my choosing the UK language.\nApple support advised me to erase and reload my OS X, but of course my last registered OSX is El Capitan. All went well with that and the migration of my files from Time Capsule backups, but I thought I should follow Apple support's advice and upgrade to High Sierra.\nIt hasn't really worked well since. It's sometimes very slow to respond despite it's fusion drive, while at others it works fine.\nAny ideas? I think I'd rather return to El Capitan which seemed to be okay...\n\nA: It's highly unlikely you'll have an instability issue on one OS and not the other. \nI'd focus on getting High Sierra installed and running since Apple will support that the best for you. Also - you could wipe and reinstall with no apps, no data - just use the brand new install for a day or three to be sure the system is stable. \nIf not - you'll know to seek a return / price adjustment from the seller or at least know you need to fix the Mac and it's not a software issue if you do a clean install and it's not working.\n", "Q: OSX High Sierra stop applications from auto launching This is driving me crazy!\nWhenever I reboot in OSX High Sierra all the applications I had open automatically reboot.\nIn Login Items NONE of these applications are there!\nHow do I stop this from happening?\n\nA: It's a standard feature & has been there for years. \nIt asks you as you shut down or reboot - just uncheck the box, it should remember.\n\n\nA: Apart from the checkbox mentioned in Tetsujin's answer make sure you don't have any unwanted startup items under\nApple menu > System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items.\nMake sure you select the unwanted auto-start item and click the - button since Hide will only hide the app from the Dock.\nAlso, if you reboot by typing sudo reboot from terminal, then apparently the setting for reopen windows is assumed to be true. In such cases, to avoid auto-starting the apps, after you have entered your password on the login screen, press the SHIFT key, then ENTER, and then keep holding the SHIFT key until the Dock is shown.\n", "Q: I need a list of MacOS app startup locations A year or so ago, I set up (under Sierra) a shell script I wrote to launch automatically using the conditions that it required \"network availability\" and was to trigger on external drive mounting by editing a plist file in Xcode.\nUnfortunately, I can't remember the name or location of this file and I need to temporarily disable the configured auto-launch.  Can anyone identify this file or at least provide me a list of app startup locations to check?\n\nA: If you are using launchd, the plist locations will be as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*${HOMEDIR}/Library/LaunchAgents - single user launch agent\n\n*/Library/LaunchAgents - all users launch agent\n\n*/Library/LaunchDameons - system daemons (runs as root)\n\n\nTo see what is being loaded, issue the command:\nsudo launchctl list\n\n", "Q: Custom keyboard layout problem High Sierra I have just upgraded my OS to macOS High Sierra.\nI have been using a custom layout for my Magic Keyboard. But after upgrading to the newer version is stopped working. \nI have installed the custom keyboard again using Ukele, but it doesn't work properly. \nHere are some weird problems I have encountered\n\n\n*\n\n*It shows the custom layout in top bar. However I am not able to select this layout. Also this layout is missed in the System Settings. \n\n\n*After rebooting, it may be able to switch to the custom layout and even work correctly, but after some time it may stop working, or there are a lot of duplicated layouts will be displayed in the Settings.\n\n\n*When switching to another input source using Cmd-Space it may show an empty list item without any title.\nI need to add my custom layout every time I reboot my laptop.\n\n\nPlease suggest how to fix this problem, I cannot work with the default keyboard layout.\nUPDATE \nSomething really weird is happening to new OS \nHere is duplicated layouts, and as far as they are same, I can't remove duplicates. \n\n\nA: Some things to try based on others who have had this kind of problem with other keyboards\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you do not have Siri turned on and that its keyboard shortcut is set to none.\n\n*If your layout is in Home/Library, try Library instead.  And vice versa, and try it in both at same time.\n\n*Disable any antivirus apps\n\n*Safe Boot \n\n*Set up new user account and see if it works when logged into that\n\nA: Ukelele is BUGGY software. I've had the problem you mention more than once, and the only answer was to forego the notion of creating an entire bundle and instead to create a layout only. You must be careful not to select the 'Name' option on the 'Keyboard' menu or the 'Rename' option on the 'File' menu. If you do, the keyboard will not install no matter what you do subsequently, up to and including loading and manually changing the content files. \nInstead, just use the 'Install' option on the file menu, and it will install the keyboard using the filename you chose when you created the keyboard file.\n", "Q: HomeKit \"Apple TV not responding\" I had a 4th Gen Apple TV setup as my HomeKit hub and was working fine. Lately I've noticed the Home App on iPod/iPhone says \"Apple TV not responding\". I've done all the tier-one support obvious things: Updated iOS and tvOS, cycled power on and off, signed out/in on Apple TV cloud login, etc.\nAbout at wits end, the Apple TV hub seems to be necessary for any newly added devices to show up on other home users (that I invited) iPhones. There will be unrest among the natives soon if I can't make this work.\n\nA: Quick summary: log in to https://appleid.apple.com/ and change your Apple Id from @me.com to @icloud.com\nI recently had the same issue (including homekit invites getting stuck as described in this issue HomeKit invitation stuck).\nYesterday I was finally able to resolve this problem after having tried all the obvious things as well (resetting devices, logging out/in of iCloud etc).\nTurns out the root cause was some kind of conflict between my Apple Id and iMessage.

So I have the 2015 \"13 MacBook so I read some articles to update firmware by holding the power button so i tried to try it for fun but I misunderstood the article and I held the power button while my mac had completed 1/4 of booting process. So I accidentally force shutdown my mac while it was booting. So should I worry about some firmware error or some sort of software error which I can't notice?\n\nA: Any forced shutdown can leave a file in a bad state. At boot, you would only corrupt a system file, so that's usually easy to reinstall the OS so I suppose if you care about user data - that's the best time to force a stop.\nHigh Sierra supports internet recovery and bootable install media, so the options to reinstall are much better than the old days where you needed a CD or DVD to reinstall and it took a long time.\n", "Q: Now that Inbox watch app is gone, how do I get Gmail notifications on Apple Watch?

With my Canon WiFi-enabled DSLR, while on location I'm able to wirelessly copy stills to my iPad Pro and view the shots on the iPad Pro.\nI'm trying to do same with my WiFi-less Canon DSLR.\nIs this possible by inserting the CF card in a card reader connected to \"Apple Lightning to USB 3\" accessory which is then plugged into the iPad Pro.\na) What is your experience with this setup?\nand \nb) What is another alternative?\n\nA: Apple says:\n\nAdd even greater capability and versatility to your iPad Pro by powering the Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter with a USB Power Adapter. Then you can connect USB peripherals like hubs, Ethernet adapters, audio/MIDI interfaces, and card readers for CompactFlash, SD, microSD, and more.\n\nIt sounds like using a USB card reader is supported. However, you may need to plug a USB-C power adapter in to your Lightning->USB3 adapter to get it to work. Thankfully there are USB-C battery packs if you want to stay mobile.\n\nA: I can't tell you how the setup would work with the CF in card reader connected to the iPad would work nor do I have that camera, but there are a few alternatives that might work...\n\n\n*\n\n*Moving the CF card to the WiFi enabled camera and forcing it to sync if you can\n\n*Use an Android phone or tablet that has OTG support (majority do) and using the adapter\n\n*Use a laptop or desktop if that's what it comes down to then you can transfer them to the iPad (possibly by email)\nIf the USB-lightning adapter supports USB storage devices, it should work fine with the CF card in the card reader\nHope this helped\n", "Q: Windows VM does not start in VMware Fusion after cloning old Mac to new hardware I had an old Mac with Sierra installed.

I can't resize an image by dragging and dropping in Notes. \n\nHow do I resize an image in Notes?\n\nA: This works for me (and doesn't require any screenshots):\n\n*\n\n*Right-click image. Select Open with Preview.\n\n*Select Tools in the menu and then select Adjust Size.\n\n*A menu should pop up allowing you to adjust the size.

This is not possible to set on iOS.\n\nA: This is now possible on iPadOS 16 and iOS 16. The image has to be on the drawing area for it to be resized.\n\nA: Try to open the image with Preview and zoom it. Then take a screenshot with Cmd+Shift+4. Then paste the screenshot back into Notes.\nIt seems Notes does not support image resizing at this time.\nIf you insert a photo to Notes, it is always too big.\n\nA: This is what I do:\n\n*\n\n*Cmd+Shift+4 to take a screenshot and open up Preview\n\n*Click Tools > Adjust size on the top menu, I find between 600 and 800 wide looks the best on Apple Notes\n\n*Select Edit > Copy and paste into Notes\n\n\nA: You can simply drag and drop the image into notes and resize as you want.

In the example below, the DaisyDisk alert style has been set to None:\n\nYou can also uncheck all the checkboxes for more granular control of when you see (and hear) notifications.\n\nA: You'll have to turn the notifications off within the client itself. \nHere is Newton's steps:\nhttp://help.newtonhq.com/article/how-do-i-configure-my-new-email-notifications/\n", "Q: How do I find out which folder an app is in in iOS 11? In older versions of iOS, if I searched for an app with Spotlight, it would tell me which folder the app was in. (E.g., this feature still works on my iPad, which is running iOS 9, but not on my iPod Touch, which is running iOS 11.)\nThis feature seems to have been removed at some point. When I search for an app under iOS 11 using Spotlight, it will find the app and let me run it, but it doesn't tell me which folder it is in.\nHow can I find out which folder an app is in now?\n\nA: \nJust search for it in spotlight. If there is only 1 app result it will show the folder. \n\nA: It works if you tap on it in the list of hits.  E.g if I search for \"Pages\", tap on my top hit in the highlighted list of hits, it shows me the app, Pages and to the right is the folder name \"Office\" (in my case).  Or \"Stocks\", tap the top hit, and I see the Stocks App, and it is in the indicated folder \"Little Used\".\nSource: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8102281 \nAlso confirmed on my own iPhone 7 Plus ios 11.3.1\n\nA: Spotlight search shows the folder name on iOS 12. \nThere isn’t a way to do this on device with earlier iOS just tapping the interface. \nI wish I could 3D Touch or force touch from Siri results to delete the apps or see the path to the folder and app. Either Apple hasn’t figured out how they want to design this experience or they believe people will either offload unused apps or use the list view to delete as a workaround.\nThe only other avenue to remove without locating an app is to search for apps in the storage section of the settings app and delete apps without using the springboard interface. \nIf you just want to launch the app, try Siri or perhaps a utility like workflow to open it procedurally or from the suggested area. \n\nA: They brought it back in iOS 13. But you have to have the search be specific enough that there is only 1 app result. Otherwise it will not show the folder. \n\nA: Often Apple Configurator 2 is good at doing such things, when you are able to connect your iPhone to a Mac.\nAfter connecting and selecting your device there are several actions provided in the menu. One of them is \"Modify\" -> \"Home Screen Layout\". You still have to browse all the apps to find the one you are looking for. At least you can do it on a big screen and after opening a folder you can see all pages at the same time.\nI know the pain. I've got almost 600 apps installed.\nThe most difficult task on the phone for me is how to delete an app that I know the name of. This can be done quite easily by selecting \"Actions\" -> \"Remove\" -> \"App...\" and entering the name.\n", "Q: Can't delete BOOTCAMP partition Bought a second hand iMac that had two partitions on the HDD. One for Mac, one for Windows. Using disk utility I erased the BOOTCAMP partition and formatted it to MacOS Extended (Journaled). All went well until I tried to remove the BOOTCAMP partition. The minus option is not enabled and I can't seem to fin any other way to delete it.\n\n\nThis is what I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot on recovery mode and try to delete using disk utility. (Same result)\n\n*Use Bootcamp assistant to remove the partition. Didn't work as windows is gone from that partition.\n\n\nHow can delete it? I want to have just one partition.\n\nA: I had the same problem using OSX Mojave and Apple tech support had me delete the 'OSXReserved\" partition using disk utility which then allowed me to delete the bootcamp partition. \n\nA: I found the answer in this Apple Support Communities thread.\nThis is what I did:\nIn terminal executed diskutil list and the output was\n#:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            542.3 GB   disk0s2\n3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s4\n4:                  Apple_HFS BOOTCAMP                449.0 MB   disk0s4\n5:                 Apple_Boot                         650.0 MB   disk0s5\n\nThen I executed the following commands: \ndiskutil eraseVolume jhfs+ BC1 disk0s4\ndiskutil list\n\nAnd the output was: \n#:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            542.3 GB   disk0s2\n3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s4\n4:                  Apple_HFS BC1                     449.0 MB   disk0s4\n\nthen:\ndiskutil eraseVolume fat32 BOOTCAMP disk0s4\n\nAfter that I opened Boot Camp Assistant and I was able to restore the HD to a single partition.\n\nA: The macOS operating system includes a disk utility command called diskutil. Also included is a Disk Utility application which can preform a subset of the functions offered by the diskutil command. (These functions are technically referred to as verbs.) The Disk Utility application also does not necessarily display all the partitions that actually exist on a drive. Often, posting just what is viewed from the Disk Utility application is not sufficient to diagnose and repair a problem with a drive.\nIn your case, you can not delete the BOOTCAMP partition because the partition is preceded by a partition that can not be resized. Well, you have not identified, in your question, which partition this is. In fact, the Disk Utility application may not even be displaying this partition. \nTo delete the BOOTCAMP partition using the Disk Utility application, you will need to first remove or HFS format the preceding partition. This is usually the partition immediately preceding, but not always.\nThe basic steps given below. \n\n\n*\n\n*Use either the Disk Utility application or diskutil command to identify the preceding partition that needs to be HFS formatted or removed. The diskutil command format is given below.\ndiskutil  list\n\n\n*Use either the Disk Utility application or diskutil command to remove or HFS format the preceding partition.\n\n*Use the Disk Utility application to remove the BOOTCAMP partition.\n\nA: How to re-partition a drive back to one partition:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log on to internet recovery for Mac\n\n*Go to the partition and choose 100% partition. \n\n\nA: I erased the disk from disk utility then opened boot camp assistant and it erased it properly and added the space to the existing volume.\n\nA: In my case, I had to use 'eraseDisk' to erase the disk. That allowed me to use Disk Utility to create a single partition for installing Monterey.\ndiskutil eraseDisk jhfs+ internal disk1\n\n\nA: Similar to @Carlos J's answer, here's what I found on a Apple forum thread:\nExecute diskutil list in Terminal, then:\ndiskutil eraseVolume free free disk0s4\ndiskutil apfs ResizeContainer disk1 0g\n\n\nA: The only way to do what you want with the Boot Camp partition is to do it with the Boot Camp Assistant!\n", "Q: How do I disable auto-turn-on Bluetooth after rebooting iPhone? Using iPhone 7+, iOS 11.1. Every time I reboot my phone, my Bluetooth automatically is turned on. This is NOT wanted and very annoying. I only use it with my remote shutter button when using my cam, which is rarely. How do I disable the auto-turn-on? \np.s. I obviously know how to turn it back off via control center. But the point is I shouldn’t have to turn it back off, and back off, and back off, and...you get my point. \n\nA: To stop the automatic enabling of Bluetooth on reboot, you must go to Settings > Bluetooth and shut off the Bluetooth radio completely.\nControl Center is but a command for our convenience, not ultimate control.\nI just tested this three times on my iPhone 7 running iOS 11.1.\n", "Q: How to stop transfer of files to iCloud I accidentally copied a very large folder on my desktop. I saw that iOS started copying my large folder to the iCloud\n\nI googled and found that if I removed the folder it should stop copying. So I went to the terminal and did a \"mv\" command to move the folder back to its original location \nBut iCloud is still copying that folder and the dialog above cannot be dismissed because the \"x\" sign at the end of the status bar is greyed out. I cannot stop this copy operation in any way.....\n\nA: Just in case if anyone is still looking for an answer on how to stop transfer of files to iCloud, here's a workaround - you can just delete the destination folder on iCloud and it will immediately stop the operation. Had to do that when I was trying to copy 67 GB. Not sure what to do if there's no destination folder (ie destination is root).\n\nA: If you just can't wait for it to finish (I would just ignore and wait), you could disconnect from the network and then restart.\nThe iCloud sync respects the local filesystem, so any change there should be immediate once the network / restart changes.\nYou can log into iCloud.com as well once you clean things up / re-enable the network and give iCloud upload process a few tens of minutes to react and clean up.\nI've had 10 GB go up one day, so as long as you aren't paying for the bandwidth and are close to an Apple data center (same half of a continent), 4 GB shouldn't take that long either to get uploaded and then delete.\n\nA: OK. I can see what is happening. even though the dialog can't be cancelled. The number of files is going down\n\nSo from 239K it has gone down to 126K. So I guess if I wait ... the number will drop to 0 and copy operation will stop.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro Thermal issues I’m having thermal issues with my MacBook Pro 17” late 2011 model laptop I7 2.5 quad core with 16GB of RAM.\nHas anyone had any thermal issues when running DAW software on this particular laptop?\nEvery software app I use: Protools, Logic, Cubase, Live, Maschine, Studio One, all crash if I'm not running an air conditioner in the room. Even then I can’t  use too many plugins.\nI think it’s the battery, as the bottom of the laptop gets very hot. I want to remove the battery, However I heard that my processor performance would be compromised.\nI was thinking of also removing the DVD drive to get more air into the computer.\nIf anyone can help with any suggestions or solutions, I would be humbled and thankful for your time and response.\n\nA: Spray compressed air back and forth into the exhaust vent in the back of the machine, where the display hinge is located. Do this while the machine is running so that the dislodged dirt will be immediately expelled by the airflow from the fans. Beyond this, nothing should be required.\n\nA: General: I wouldn't run software that \"digs\" deep like ProTools and others all together. Start them when really needed and Quit them after use: remove them from the LoginItems (with the minus sign underneath the list, then restart).\nBattery: in Utilities->SystemInformation select \"Power\" at the left, Then at the right look at \"Condition:\" should be \"normal\", and look at \"CycleCount:\" should less than 1000. Everything else than I said means replace battery\nIf you take out the battery and run on the charger only, performance is lower and the mac will get even higher.\n", "Q: How do I unhide the Mail preview pane? In my default view when using Apple's Mail on macOS, I used to see 3 coluns, from left:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mailbox\n\n*Inbox\n\n*Email\n\n\nI stretched the Inbox column / pane to width of the full window, and now have only 2 columns:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mailbox\n\n*Inbox\n\n\nI cannot \"pull back\" the Email pane with a mouse.\nHow can I restore the missing Email preview pane?\n\nA: You have moved the divider line to the right to set the email pane to zero width. You move it back the same way, but you have to move to almost full width for it to \"hold\", after that you can vary the width as you like.\nIt is the same in Classic View: if you do not move it up very high it will not hold.\n\nA: Note: while moving it to almost full width, it doesn't look like the divider is moving at all - the email panel will just suddenly appear when you've pulled it long enough.\n", "Q: Uninstall Insignia Adapter Drivers I recently bought a Insignia USB to Ethernet adapter  I proceeded to install the drivers and it has caused me nothing but trouble since. \nWhen I try to sign in to my profile, it opens into a window asking if I would like to use \n\n\n*\n\n*WiFi network (this option is not selectable)\n\n*Local Network \n\n*My computer does not connect to the internet  \n\n\nNo matter what option I select it states that a piece of software has not been installed and I need to try later after it is installed.

If it can't boot correctly, EmbeddedOSInstallService will attempt to fix it so your Touch Bar can function again, by copying a ‘known good’ OS from:\n/usr/standalone/firmware/iBridge1_1Customer.bundle\n/Library/Updates/PreflightContainers\n\nIf there isn't a good OS here, Setup Assistant will ask you to connect to the internet so one can be downloaded and EFI repaired.\nMake sure your internet connection is suitable per https://support.apple.com/kb/HT207567.\n", "Q: Possible to use Siri to trigger custom actions? These days, Macs have Siri.\nSiri even works offline for tasks like dictation.\nWhen Siri interprets audio into written words, can I somehow capture those written words, and trigger a self-defined action if a certain pattern is detected?\nFor example, if I say \"Hey Siri, run my backup script\", could a shell script located in my home folder then be executed?\n(Bonus question: If Siri cannot do this, is there some other free technology that can?)\n\nA: That’s one interesting idea. It seems to be possible by registering custom vocabulary in your app. Since there is SiriKit it should be possible. Besides people from Homebridge achieved the same you want with garage doors and so on.\nhttps://github.com/nfarina/homebridge/blob/master/README.md\nThings like custom vocabulary can be found here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/sirikit/registering_custom_vocabulary_with_sirikit\nSo if I understand the docs correctly you can specify \nIntentPhrases that allow you to react for a word shell for exemple\nBut I love the idea. First thing I will connect will be ‘fastlane’ and I will shout ‘deploy!’ \n\nA: While it seems possible through Siri, using the built in dictation commands seem easier to run a script.\nYou can see how here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/MacAutomationScriptingGuide/UseDictationtoRunScripts.html\n", "Q: How do diagnose network problems My MacBook Air has issues maintaining an internet connection at home.

On an OS level, the window server decides what is visible and the kernel schedules any request for GPU assets.\nSo, you choose which programs run and they send their commands to the driver and then you get a variable amount of work between vsync events when the display updates.\nWe get to control external refresh rates / the pixel specifications of attached displays and the number of connected displays.\n\nIf you are developing an app or just really curious, you can use Instruments in Xcode to inspect precisely gets done on the CPU side and the calls out to the GPU using metal in this example below:\n\nIt shows you the CPU calls that then get passed down to the Metal Application calls which then call out to the graphics driver both of which perform rendering passes. This graph is the result of one window to http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html in Safari on High Sierra later in the game when the screen is busy constantly. The color area is about 75 ms on the first image and if you zoom in to 3 ms or so, the CPU activity with the circled R are about 15 stack traces each so you can inspect the heaviest user of time in that moment. That's the lower image:\n\nEvan at this level of detail, measuring what's using VRAM isn't even considered something worth measuring since the constraint that matters is time to render and the VRAM is what it is so you reduce what you load in to the VRAM to get the renders you need between vsync events so that the frame rate is where you want it to be (as a programmer or as someone benchmarking a program).\n", "Q: Replacing Macbook Pro SSD with Macbook Air SSD Currently I have a Macbook Pro (mid 2014) with 120GB ssd. I am planning to buy a Macbook Air (say, early 2015) with 250GB ssd and swap these drives between laptops. I know they are both PCI based, but that doesn't mean much\nas the protocol could be SATA/NVM/Proprietary.\nMy concerns are:\n1. Will it work?\n2. Should I expect significant performance differences between these drives?\nI checked compatible drives for both laptops on ifixit:\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Store/Parts/MacBook-Air-11-Inch-and-13-Inch-Mid-2013-to-Early-2015-and-MacBook-Pro-Retina-13-Inch-and-15-Inch-2015-SSD/IF188-105-5 Air\nhttps://www.ifixit.com/Store/Parts/MacBook-Pro-13-Inch-and-15-Inch-Retina-Late-2013-Mid-2014-SSD/IF123-026 Pro\nI see that Air's SSD is compatible with Air models from 2013 to 2015, but with Pro models only of 2015 -- that seems weird and I expect that it's just a misleading description.

I am using macOS 10.13.1 and Safari 11.0.1, since I upgraded from 10.12 it's not possible to access https websites through IP address.\nFor example:\nI want access the config GUI from a router\n\n\n*\n\n*I open Safari go to https://​192.168.0.1.\n\n*Safari says: \"connection is not private\"\n\n*I click \"Details\" → \"Open website\" → \"Visit website\" then I have to enter the password from my local user.\n\n*The site reloads and again I can see the message: \"connection is not private\".\n\n\nIf I create a hostname entry in /etc/hosts like: 192.168.0.1 my.funny.router and go to Safari and open https://​my.funny.router the connection can be established after I clicked \"Details\" → \"Open website\".\nIs there a workaround? Can I disable that \"feature\"?\n\nA: The bypass can't be bypassed apparently. Note also that it may fail and keep requesting authentication if your hosts file entry has both short and FQDN specified. In that case you MUST use the FQDN. This is possibly because the Mac will append your local domain to any unqualified host names before checking for permission and (I am guessing) that a remote site identifying as your local machine domain (mymac.local for example) can't be added to the keychain. OR it might be that having ONLY a short host name in /etc/hosts would be OK but if you have BOTH long and short names specified then you must use the FQDN as that is the one that resolves in your host file. \n\nA: Well the only solution I have found for that issue is to serve the website in safari private mode. \nThan safari still complain that the connecton is not private but you can hit \"deatils\" and than \"open website\". \nWith this workaround its not needed to edit /etc/hosts\n", "Q: iCloud storage, Backup none of my photos are available anymore , they dont open properly (all blurry) and it says its because i dont have enough icloud storage, i went to check it through my iphone but it tells me \"unable to load storage info\" (i tried both on wifi and data) so i can do nothing about it. I checked with pc and i have 2GB free. I wanted to know how I can get my photos back or at least transfer them to my pc.\n\nA: Go to settings -> Tap on your name -> Tap on iCloud -> Tap on Storage or Manage Storage and then you'll be able to see how much \"iCloud storage you have available.\nYour iPhone storage is different from your iCloud. What you can do though is while you are in iCloud settings, go to Photos (in iCloud) then put a check next to \"Download and keep originals\". That will make sure the photos save in full quality. This will also eat up your iPhone storage depending on how many photos you have.\n", "Q: Stop Safari from asking to be default browser My default browser is currently Firefox.

Since I installed High Sierra I sometimes have to double tap Command + Space to open spotlight search bar. This problem is weird because it happens randomly. Say I just double tapped Command + Space, it won't happen again for a couple minutes.  \nI haven't setup any shortcut nor I use any app that steals this shortcut. I have no idea what is going on and it is really boring, cause sometimes I'm in a text editor, tap Command + Space, nothing happens but as I'm used to it, I start type right away and mess up my code.\n\nA: I had the same problem. Apparently, Siri is waiting to see if it's being called. In the Siri preferences, there's a setting for Keyboard Shortcut which is set to Hold Command Space by default. So sometimes you might be pressing a little longer but not long enough for Siri to kick in.\nChange this setting to Press Fn (Function) Space as shown in the screenshot.\n\n\nA: Look in SystemPreferences->Keyboard->Shortcut select Spotlight (while Textedit open) if there is a message that CMD+Space is \"used by another app\".\n", "Q: Has Unix directory usage or policy changed in High Sierra? I understand that macOS has its own policies about how various standard Unix directories are used, and that these are (or at least have in the past been) documented in the \"File System Programming Guide\". I'm about to update to High Sierra (from Sierra) and wonder:\n\n\n*\n\n*have these policies changed in any way between 10.12 and 10.13; and\n\n*does the update process force changes (e.g. by enforcing new policies or reimposing old ones that have been customized) in organization or existing permissions.\n\n\nFor example I see that it is no longer possible under 10.13 to chown /usr/local/, and wonder what other changes the update will make to these standard Unix directories in (a) structure, (b) permissions, or (c) my ability to change permissions or organize the directories.\n\nA: No super big changes on directories is my feeling / opinion.\nHigh Sierra changes very little with respect to SIP protection and you can easily use ls to read ACL and restricted status protecting from root / super user modification of files.\nEverything that was changed materially was versions before. High Sierra does introduce APFS and the concept of snapshots and radically more efficient storage and access speeds - but on the UNIX directory level - this is a snoozer of an upgrade.\nYour /usr/local change is the only one that's notable - you can't get rid of it* but you're free to roam within it and change things to suit your needs.\nApple provides additional details about SIP Protected directories.\n——\n* Of course, you can still get rid of SIP protected files / folders / directories by disabling SIP by doing the hokey-pokey of reboot, disable, reboot, change, reboot, re-enable, reboot (Assuming you want SIP in general but not for this one thing). But then, the next time an OS update comes, your work customizing the OS could (and eventually will) fail since the installer will then put the file back where Apple intended it to be - existing and protected by SIP.\n", "Q: Set maximum audio volume on macOS? I cannot recall precisely, but while attempting to type \"9\" or \"0\" or hit the Delete key or other keys in that area of the top row, I just fat-fingered my headphone volume to maximum on the touch bar. It greatly startled me and caused me to shout out loud at work.\nI love using the touch bar. I am never going to improve my clumsy hand movements. I require constant headphones at work to concentrate. I need my headphones plugging into my laptop so I can hear the occasional audio cue from other apps.\nHowever, I absolutely cannot let this happen again. I scared all my nearby teammates with my sudden loud shout. I had to assure them it was OK, explain what happened, and apologize for the disturbance.\nI recalled my iPod shuffle has a feature to limit the maximum volume on it, and I figured an even more feature-full OS would surely also have that feature, but I cannot seem to find it in System Preferences.\nAm I missing the feature? Is there a Terminal command I can type that limits the maximum volume to a lower level?\n\nA: If you're still on the hunt for such an application, I have great news. I wrote a simple status menu bar app, which lets you limit the main output volume of your Mac. The app is called Earsafe, check it out if you have time.\nAll the best!\n\nA: I had a similar issue and it was solved (not intentionally, just a happy by-product) by using a 3rd party media player.\nIn my case, I used Vox.  It has it's own volume control which I set at a level that no matter if the system is set to \"max\" it won't be any louder than what is set in the app.\n\nThe best part is Vox is free (as in beer). \n\nA: So this solves my clumsy typing problem, but it does not answer my question of limiting maximum audio volume.\nI went into System Preferences > Keyboard and tapped the \"Customize Control Strip...\" button. From there I dragged the volume slider from my touch bar to the \"Remove from touch bar\" area.\nNow I have greatly reduced my chance of accidentally engaging that control and then inadvertantly swiping right dramatically. And now that I think about it, I'll remove Siri from a nearby spot also.\n\nA: I had a similar experience after leaning on my headphone's volume control and pressing play. I made a small status bar app which allows you to set a volume limit: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/whisper-volume-limiter/id1438132944\n", "Q: How to delete emails stored locally on my MacBook pro?

The Mail app is about 40 MB and the restare the files locally downloaded from the Mail. How can I delete these files without affecting the original mails?  \n\nA: What email is the Mail app using? If its not iCloud then you can easily manage how much email is sent to your Macbook directly from the clients website (Gmail, Yahoo, Aol, & etc). If it is iCloud email, then you may want to manage whats coming in. You can also turn mail off and on under iCloud in system preferences.\n\nA: Open System Information from the Utilities folder in /Applications.

The unformatted HDD is nowhere to be seen.\nThe original drive was a 1TB Seagate; I see a slight discrepancy on the power specs, but not sure whether this has an impact.\nAnything else I should try? At the moment I don't have any means to independently verify the integrity of the new drive (external Caddy etc).\nUpdate\nBased on feedback here, I purchased an HDD caddy, which connected my new HDD to a working laptop via USB. I was able to mount and format the drive, and even proactively installed High Sierra on it. This at least confirmed the issue was not with the drive.\nSo then I proceeded to do a motherboard removal to get at the SATA cables behind it. I did not find any issues with the cables, but removed them, blew in them to clean them out, and reseated them before reassembly.\nUpon reassembly, the computer recognized the drive and booted at once into High Sierra - success!\nThe process was relatively painless, though not complete free of issues: I snapped a fan housing (when I dropped the fan), which had to be epoxied, and I busted the JST connector for the skin sensor 2-wire cable, which I managed to hardwire upon reassembly. Now, although the Mac works, the fans are on full-speed all of the time, making it sound like an industrial shop vac and pretty much useless in the office environment. Live and learn.\n\nA: If you place a totally uninitialized drive on macOS - it not only shows in Disk Utility and lets you partition it, but it prompts you to format the drive for use.\nSomething else is up in terms of firmware, cabling or perhaps settings on the drive itself. If Seagate tech support doesn’t have some obvious things to check - you’ll want to test it in another computer or on an external sled to be sure it’s working before returning it to the vendor.\nChances are it’s a cable that needs reseating on the logic board or on the drive itself. I know reseating the non drive end of the cable is a pain and replacing the internal SATA cable is a big pain - so try to test externally first if you can.\nYou probably know all the above since you mentioned independently verifying so here are some last ditch things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reset the NVRAM on the iMac (command option P R at boot)\n\n*Reset the SMC on the iMac (power down - disconect all power for 15 seconds)\n\n", "Q: Disable Force Touch from terminal using Bash or AppleScript Is there a way to disable (or do other things to) the Force Touch settings using either shell scripting or AppleScript?

I'm using windows if that affects anything.\n\nA: It seems that this is a tag within the file. If you are using Windows, follow this guide here. Per Mod request, I've put the instructions below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Begin by downloading MP3Tag, whether the most recent version or a portable version.\n\n*Open iTunes and find a song that you’d like to mark with an appropriate tag. Click the song once, so that it is highlighted, and then press “Ctrl + I.” The next window will have a button marked “File.” Under it you can see if the track is an AAC or MP3 (iTunes calls MP3 ‘MPEG audio’). Unfortunately, adding these tags to an MP3 file is not possible, so any track you wish to mark must be AAC.\n\n*Right-click the track and choose to “Create AAC Version.” In our case, we’ll use a copy of Hard-Fi’s “Suburban Knights.” iTunes will play a tone when the AAC version has been created, and it will appear alongside the original version in your library. Use “Ctrl + I” again to double-check which file is the AAC version if you are unsure.\n\n*Open MP3Tag at this point, and right click the song in iTunes to see a list of actions. Choose “Show in Windows Explorer,” then drag the song into MP3Tag.\n\n*Right-click the entry within MP3Tag and select the “Extended Tags” option. The tag is not part of MP3Tag by default, so you’ll have to add it via the first of the three buttons.\n\n*After clicking the first of the three buttons, another window will appear asking for two properties: the tag name and the tag value.\n\n*Call the tag “ITUNESADVISORY” (without the quote marks), and choose the correct value. Entering “0” will mean that no icon appears, just as before. Entering “1” will give the song the “Explicit” tag, and entering “2” will give it the “Clean” tag. Leaving the value blank will give no tag.\n\n*After modifying the details for the song, press “Ctrl + S” in MP3Tag to get a window informing you that the changes have been saved.\n\n*Remove the songs you’re changing from iTunes. As iTunes cannot register changes to the song, you’ll have to remove and re-add them. Make sure you choose to “Keep Files.”\n\n*Drag the modified tracks back into iTunes, and you’ll see the corresponding tag. Sync them with an iOS device and the same remains true.\n\nA: Do you use Apple Music?

The main purpose is to stream audio in two devices simultaneously. Is there a MacOS feature that would allow me to do this? \nAlso, I am not considering a Bluetooth splitter, for sound quality purposes. \nEdit: Upon further researching, I found this link on Bose forum (https://community.bose.com/t5/Headphones-Archive/Share-Audio-from-MacOS-Macbook-Pro-with-two-or-more-Bluetooth/td-p/46007). Looks like, creating multi-output device may be a solution? (at this moment I am not able to test this, since I do not have more than one Bluetooth headphones). Has anyone tried it this way? Does it work? \n\nA: Yes, you can do it: https://community.bose.com/t5/Headphones-Archive/Share-Audio-from-MacOS-Macbook-Pro-with-two-or-more-Bluetooth/td-p/46007\nHere are the steps I took:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect both headphones via bluetooth. Both should say connected on the Bluetooth setting page.\n\n*In Finder menu hit Go -> Utilities -> Audio Midi Setup\n\n*You should see both your headphones listed on the left here.\n\n*Hit the \"+\" button at the bottom left and select \"Create Multi-Output Device\" (You may rename the device if you wish)\n\n*Select your bose headphones from the list on the right to add to the Multi-Output Device.\n\n*Right-click on the Multi-Output Device you just created and use device for sound output and play alerts and sound through this device.\n\n*You may also select which device as your master device to sync across all your connected headphones. \n\n*I also selected Drift Correction for slave devices - I'm not 100% sure what this does but I think it makes sure that your devices stay in sync to the audio/video playing on your computer.\n\n*Watch away.

On both, I use a Thunderbolt 2 compatible adapter that connects to the firewire port and gives me an HDMI output signal.  Then I run an HDMI cable from there to an HDMI switch by Kinivo.  The output runs from there to an HDMI 1080p HDTV.\nOne uses a MacMini from late 2009 running El Capitan (10.11.6), which seems to be the latest I can upgrade it to.  That particular setup uses an Epson 1450 Home Cinema projector.  I've tested it with other HDMI TVs, though.  When I switch the HDMI switch to Output 1 (the MacMini), I see the MacMini display with no issue.\nOn the 2nd setup, I have a 27\" iMac, from late 2013, running macOS Sierra 10.12.6. (Haven't had time to update to the latest yet.)  It's the same setup, but, of course, to a different 1080p HDTV.  If I run the HDMI cable from the Thunderbolt 2 display adapter to the TV (and I've tested it with different TVs), I get a clear image and can use the TV as a 2nd monitor.  But once I run the signal from the adapter, through one cable, into the HDMI switch (same brand, same model, as the other one - ordered them together), on the HDTVs I've tested it on, I get \"Unsupported Signal.\"\nThe factor that changes is adding the HDMI switch.\nI also have an input on both HDMI switches from a DISH TV device.  In all cases, on both systems, when I switch to the DISH device as an input, everything is fine.  Inputs from blue ray players are fine.  But on this 2nd system, with the iMac, whenever the signal goes through the HDMI switch, the result is \"Unsupported Signal.\"\nCan someone give me an explanation of what is happening and if it's fixable.  What puzzles me is this happens on one switch and not the other.  (I'm hoping to swap out switches at some point to test them.)  I'm wondering if the output on the iMac could be different than the output from the MacMini.\n\nA: After suggestions in the comments, I tried an active adapter instead of a passive one.  While the adapter may have been flakey, for some reason, Amazon deliveries for the past week have been completely inept and I wasn't about to risk dealing with that again to return the adapter and get a replacement.  Instead I went to Best Buy and got a different HDMI switch.  I'm not going to link to it because, although it solved this problem, it had another issue.\nI'll be trying another adapter when it arrives and if that works, I'll post information on it.\nIn the meanwhile, I was using a Kinivo 3 Output HDMI switch.  While it handled the normal DVR and BD player video signals, it was not able to handle the video signal from either display adapter from my iMac.  Be aware of that issue if you are looking at that brand of an HDMI switch.\n\nEDIT: I have to add that, after experimenting, while I was using a switch that worked for my display adapter, I found an issue with the connector.  Bottom line: The connector had a very narrow \"fail range.\"  Most of the time it was plugged in, it'd work, but there was just one angle that would make it fail.  Of course that angle was the angle it was in when in the Kinivo switch, where the signal would not go through.  Once I swapped it with another cable, it worked fine.\n", "Q: iOS 11 & Apple Maps: Hide Search Box in Landscape Orientation I’m not sure what that box is called, but it’s the one with the search at the top of it, and the history below.\nIn Portrait Orientation you can swipe down on it and it reduces to a single search box. It’s annoying how much space it takes up, but at least it doesn’t cover half the screen.\nIn Landscape Orientation, I can’t see any way to reduce the search box, so that it always covers half of the screen. The main reason to use Landscape Orientation is to see more horizontally, not less.\nIs there any way to get rid of that search box?\nI have iOS 11.1 on an iPhone X, but the problem also occurs on iPhone 6 etc.\n\nA: I have this same issue. I have no solution, but believe this is a software issue that is exclusive to \"narrow\" iPhones (i.e., anything but the Plus) running iOS 11.\nI have been using both an iPhone 8 Plus and an iPhone X for the past week, and have noticed this issue only exists on the X. On the 8 Plus, I am easily able to close the search box in landscape mode. On the X, I cannot. I have tried deleting Maps and re-installing, but with no change. It's almost as if the bottom of the search box on the X runs off the bottom of the screen, and that's the problem.\nI've also tried a friend's 8, and an old 6, but running iOS 11, and both devices have the same issue -- can't close the search box in landscape mode. However, trying this on an iPhone 5 running iOS 10, and it's not an issue (in landscape mode, the box remains to the bottom of the screen, not the side, and compresses to the bottom).\nIt would be useful to hear from (1) people running iPhone SE or 5S using iOS 11 and (2) people running a 6/6S/7 under iOS 10 and see if this is an issue, to confirm my hypothesis.\n", "Q: Software Update badge won't go away After upgrading to 11.1.1 both the Settings->General menu item and the sub-menu for Software Update have a (1) badge which will not go away. Selecting the Software Update menu shows the phone software is up to date.\nIs there some update I'm missing, or way to clear this badge? \n\nA: This was fixed simply by upgrading to 11.1.2. The badge doesn’t return after re-checking for updates. It was only released in the last 24-48 hours and I upgraded to 11.1.1 pretty fast too, so pretty sure the badge was not originally showing for 11.1.2 availability.\n\nA: There is a time-consuming workaround with 50% success, meaning it removes the badge over the outside of the Settings app and the folder (if you place Settings in a folder) but keeps it inside Settings under \"General\" & \"Software update\". For me that was enough for my OCD.  \nHere's the steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are jailbroken just get a tweak, do not proceed!!!\n\n*Ensure the firmware you are on or want to be on is still signed - go to ipsw.me\n\n*Download the appropriate (still signed) firmware from ipsw.me\n\n*On the iPhone/iPad go to betaprofiles.com and download a tvOS profile OLDER than your current firmware/the firmware you want to stay on.\n\n*Install the tvOS beta profile and reboot.\n\n*Using iTunes, make a FULL and ENCRYPTED local backup, on your computer, using iTunes (do not forget your password! - Save it to the keychain)\n\n*Using iTunes, proceed to press \"Restore iPhone\" while holding the \"Alt (PC) or Option (Mac) Key\" down.\n\n*An iTunes window will open asking for the file to use.  Navigate to where you saved the firmware from ipsw.me and select it.\n\n*Proceed with the restore, and your iPhone will be wiped and the downloaded firmware will be re-installed.\n\n*Restore the backup you just took.\n\n*Enjoy no badge over Settings! \n\n\nA: I have that with Mail sometimes. Normally this should help: do a reset:\nfor older iPhones: press and hold the ON/OFF button (or the lower sound button) and the Home button, keep holding until you see the white apple logo appear. let go and let it startip.\n", "Q: 2010 MacBook Pro fan gets loud My 2010 MacBook Pro (running macOS 10.13 High Sierra) fan gets super loud when I open more than one app at once. (This has been happening ever since I had El Capitan installed.) However, it can go quiet over software - whenever I use Siri, it goes silent, but it goes back to loud as soon as I'm done speaking to Siri.\nIs there anything I could do to make my MacBook less loud?\n\nA: There are a few different solutions that I've personally done to fix my MacBook Pro with the same issue.\nSolution 1:\nIf you have the Dedicated nVidia Chip I'd strongly suggest installing gfxCardStatus (it's 100% free) and disable the dedicated card altogether. It drains battery, isn't very efficient, emits a lot of heat, and in my case, can cause Kernel panics leading to unexpected shutdowns.\nSolution 2:\nIn conjunction to solution 1, I'd suggest also installing Macs Fan Control. A lot of people will say you don't need it and it's true, but Apple usually doesn't ramp the fans up gradually as heat increases, meaning that your MacBook will run hot until it's too hot and the fans ramp up a lot. I'd rather the laptop be barely audible than cook my legs. \nSolution 3:\nI'd highly recommend re-pasting your MacBook Pro as the thermal paste will be dried up by now. In my case, the stock paste from Apple was disgusting; simply too much paste, and now too old.\n\n\n\nPreviously my MacBook would get up to 76C watching 720p videos in bed (not the best air circulation) with the fans maxed out at 6000RPM. Now, with liquid metal installed, it'll always sit under my custom threshold of 65C when watching videos with just the Intel chip enabled and is dead silent at <2500 RPM. This iFixit guide is what I used in order to do it myself on my 15\" MacBook Pro.\nAbout Siri: The fans ramp down when using Siri, was a feature added that silences the fan in order for siri to hear you better when activated.\n", "Q: Will my Google Authenticator codes work if I restore my iPhone from a backup? The latest iOS update (11.1.1) bricked my iPhone, and it appears that I will need to reset the phone to factory settings and then restore from my (iTunes) backup. I have a fairly recent backup available, but by far the most important thing that I need to be sure will continue to work is my Google Authenticator codes.\nI'm not changing devices, just reseting and restoring from backup to the same one. Will my Google Authenticator codes work if I restore my iPhone from a backup?\n\nA: For me, iOS 11.1 did not brick my phone. It made it unusable in a variety of amusing ways, but it didn't brick it.\nThe main issue I had was similar to yours - Google Authenticator had been completely wiped clean.\nThankfully, my iPhone backs up every night so I lost less than 1 days information (and no photos). This included restoring my Google Authenticator to a fully functional state - so the answer to your question is yes, your Google Authenticator information is stored in iCloud backups.\nIt also turned out that I had no recovery codes for my various accounts. I have 11 accounts in my Google Authenticator app - including Cloud Flare and Teamviewer. Neither of these apps have a backup 2FA method (like a text, a phone call or similar) - and Teamviewer do not offer any official support to free accounts. This meant I was locked out of my Teamviewer account permanently.\nI can't stress this enough: ensure you have your backup codes stored somewhere - somewhere safe:\n\nPersonally I've put them in my password manager, but the Notes app on your iPhone is also perfect for this - or print them out and file them somewhere you won't forget. I'm also considering disabling 2FA login to Teamviewer.\n\nA: I have verified that you can retain all google authentication codes by restoring from Itunes. So both iCloud and Itunes backups will work successfully.\n\nA: Restoring an encrypted backup from iTunes will NOT restore Google Authenticator settings. The restore will install Google Authenticator but with no settings -- it will be like a freshly installed copy.\nThis is based on my experience restoring a backup to a device of the same model after a replacement.\n\nA: The answer is NO. Google Authenticator does not save your settings, configured sites or whatsoever in the iTunes backup. If you restore your iPhone from backup, the Google Authenticator app will be blank.\nActually this is the desired behavior due to the verification workflow that relies on the actual device.\n\nA: Yes it's still working in 2021, Just restored my device from iTunes backup and Google authenticator restored properly with all information back to it's place, Thank God\n\nA: Just tried in iPhone ios 16\n\n*\n\n*restore backup in old phone WILL be able to recover google authenticator accounts\n\n*restore backup in new phone will NOT transfer google authenticator accounts\n\n*phone to phone (putting phone side by side) transfer will NOT transfer google authenticator accounts\n\n*restore backup in new phone, then phone to phone transfer to old phone will NOT transfer google authenticator accounts\n\n\nA: You can restore  Google Authenticator with all accounts ONLY on the device where you activate this accounts(by scanning QR). Because this accounts tied to your device hardware.\nMy story:\n\nI bought a new iPhone, made iTunes backup on my PC and fully reset and\n  cleared all settings and content from the old one. After restore the\n  backup on the new iPhone all accounts disappeared from  Google\n  Authenticator. But after I restored my old phone - all accounts\n  restored as well.\n\n\nA: Source:\nAccording to this Google Community answer, you should be able to restore from iCloud and it will work.\n\nIf you back up your information using iCloud, you can restore your iPhone or iPad from iCloud, and you’ll be able to use the previous version of our Google Authenticator app.\n\n\nA: At least currently, yes. I created an encrypted backup in iTunes, wiped my iPhone, and restored from that backup. I had my Google Authenticator codes on my phone again after the wipe. If your backup was not encrypted, I don't know if it would save the codes since it generally doesn't save passwords (in their vague wording).\nThis is only my experience. This is not documented anywhere, so proceed with caution. I only tried this after disabling 2FA on the sites I use it with.\n\nA: I was recently very stupid and forgot my iPad passcode, which meant after 10 attempts, the iPad was disabled and my only option was to restore the iPad from a recent iCloud backup. With great stress and apprehension, the device restored and on opening Google Authenticator, all of my 2FA codes were present and worked.\n\nA: Call me crazy, but I have a second device with Google Authenticator.  When I scan a QR code for 2FA for a site, I do it on both my iPhone and the second device (the generated codes are identical on both devices).\n\nA: I know this post is very old and I want to let you know that I tested iCloud backup/restore.\n\n*\n\n*It does backup for the APP only.\n\n*It does not back up the accounts.\n\n\nA: YES!\nIf you use the SAME phone, and restore from a backup from that phone.\nI just had this issue. I did a iPhone swap with my service provider (AT&T) and didn't realize until I got home that my new phone didn't have codes on Google Auth. I had already wiped my old phone and given it to the store.\nSo this morning I went back just as they opened and the kind team brought my old phone out from the back where it was prepared for shipment. They let me use it long enough to restore from the last backup I had made of it, export them to my new phone, and wipe the phone again.

Shutting down the machine from the command line with e.g. shutdown -h seems as if it would not be particularly graceful, but on a scale of \"Pulling the power cord out of the wall\" to \"Going through the standard shutdown procedure from the  Menu\", how graceless is shutdown -h actually?\n\nA: Absolutely prefer shutdown -h to pulling the power cord out of the wall. shutdown provides an opportunity for macOS to cleanly exit important underlying processes and flush file caches to storage.\nAvoid shutdown\nHaving implemented a gentle shutdown programmatically, experience taught us that you should try to avoid shutdown -h when you have logged in users and running graphical Mac applications:\n\nshutdown is a blunt tool that will in most cases shut down your Mac. It works at a layer below the Mac's user interface and is roughly the equivalent of force quitting everything.\nWith shutdown, Mac applications that would have quit nicely are not given the chance. In most cases using shutdown should be fine but care needs to be taken about denying applications of the opportunity to quit nicely.\n\n– Shutting Down Your Mac Safely, dssw.co.uk\nPrefer kAEShutDown\nIf you are able, follow Apple's advice in Technical Q&A QA1134 - Programmatically causing restart, shutdown and/or logout. This advice can be summed up as: issue an kAEShutDown AppleEvent to the system.\nBe aware that using only kAEShutDown has its limitations, these are discussed in How to Shut Down Your Mac Using AppleScript.\nBy AppleScript or Command Line\nYou can use an AppleScript snippet to issue the kAEShutDown using:\ntell application \"Finder\"\n    shut down\nend tell\n\nOr using the command line tool osascript:\nosascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to shut down'\n\nCounter to the macOS Approach\nIn terms of non-graphical processes, shutdown is reasonable. For anything graphical or at the user level, you should avoid it. Issuing shutdown is not appropriate for regular use on macOS; as an emergency measure it is fine but not as a pre-considered solution.\nUsers would quickly learn to avoid an application that simply issued shutdown instead of issuing the request through the AppleEvent.\n", "Q: After upgrading to macOS High Sierra, my Japanese and Chinese input methods disappeared How do I get them back?

If the servers don’t fix things at that point, you should contact support.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com\n\nThe important thing is to get your workout(s) in and then check back for the badge later. \nIn my case, both of the workouts above were more than 20 minutes and I tried the reboot trick to no avail. It’s clear from multiple failures it’s not us not meeting the goals for this badge and more that the badge issuance can be delayed and not be instant. \n", "Q: How do I add youtube support to Safari 11.0?

When my MacBook sleeps, and I try to wake it using the attached USB keyboard, the DisplayPort connected screen comes on, but the dock looses connection to the USB keyboard, all other USB peripherals. Also, I have a Sonnet Echo Express III-D connected to the Thunderbolt through port on the dock and it also gets disconnected.\nThe ports won't come back unless I disconnect the dock and reconnect it or restart the computer.\nI have contacted CalDigit support and they said:\n\nThe “put hard disks to sleep when possible” energy saver option\n  basically sends a “dead” signal to the TS3 when it sleeps as a poor\n  attempt to save battery (despite the TS3’s charging abilities). Since\n  the computer has manually initiated a shutoff, the TS3 is unable to\n  reconnect without a manual reboot- namely, your unplugging and\n  re-plugging of the cord.\nAt the present, we do not know of any plans on Apple’s part to update\n  their Energy Saver preferences to reflect the fact that our dock is an\n  approved charging source.\n\nThis did not solve the problem. Anytime the MacBook sleeps, the TB3 dock stops working and I have to reboot.\nAssuming CalDigit is correct in stating there is nothing they can do to cure this behavior, has anyone else been able to find a work-around for this or other TB3 docks?\nAt present, I assume my only \"fix\" is to never allow my MacBook to sleep. However, there doesn't appear to be a way to prevent macOS High Sierra from sleeping. Even with utilities like Amphetamine, the computer still sleeps but is woken immediately by the utility, causing the dock to disconnect.\n\nA: Given that the computer sleep seems to be the problem, I turned off the \"Power Nap\", and it seems to be working for me now.\n\n\n*\n\n*System Preferences > Energy Saver\n\n*Power Adapter tab\n\n*Uncheck \"Enable Power Nap while plugged into a power adapter\n\n\nThis seems to be preventing the computer from sleeping and my external monitor has been fine. Note that I still turn off the display after 10 minutes, so I don't think this is harmful to the computer.\nOf course, this setup is only when plugged in, which is the only time I care about the external monitor.\n\nA: I have the same problem and am getting the same response from CalDigit Support.  I'm on macOS High Sierra, MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports).\nSome apps will prevent your computer from sleeping, such as Amazon Music.  I find that if I leave that running, the computer doesn't sleep and this problem is avoided.  Preventing the computer from sleeping is definitely not a real solution though... :-(\n", "Q: How to use rsync via ssh with IPv6 LLA (link local address) addresses on OSX?

If I unplug them and plug them again in different ports only the hdmi works again, and the only way i found so far to make USB and Ethernet work again is rebooting the laptop.\nPS: I have have Sierra (10.12.6 (16G29))\n\nA: The first things I'd try is resetting both the NVRAM and SMC.\nBefore following the steps below, ensure you have no external hardware connected and that you're using the built-in keyboard.\nResetting the NVRAM on Late-2016 MacBook Pro models\nOlder Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). To reset the NVRAM on all Late-2016 MacBook Pro models (with and without Touch Bar) follow these steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then immediately press the commandoptionpr keys. \n\n*Keep these keys pressed down for at least 20 seconds!\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote 1: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nNote 2: These steps will also work to reset the NVRAM (or PRAM) for all Macs. However, the late-2016 and 2017 MBP models actually required the commandoptionpr keys to be held down for 20 seconds, while earlier Macs did not require this, but doing so does not cause any problems either.\nReset the SMC\nThere's a couple of ways you can reset the SMC on your MBP, however I prefer the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MBP\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button\n\n\nAfter resetting both the NVRAM and SMC, use your MBP to determine if the problem still occurs. Let me know how you go.\n\nA: There is no misbehavior on the part of the MBP; resetting SMC etc will not address this problem. \nWhen the MBP goes to sleep, the ports are powered off and communication stops as intended. When the computer wakes, RealTek ethernet chips are powered back on, but they do not resume communication. My work gave me an unbranded usb-c to ethernet adapter which uses a RealTek chip according to System Information > USB. If the computer sleeps, I can't get the connection back without unplugging the adapter, like you described. \nHowever, when I use a Lindy #43164 adapter (which uses an ASIX chip), my connection is fine after sleeping. If you are quite annoyed by this problem, I would recommend buying this adapter, or another which does not use a RealTek chip. (Sadly, RealTek chips are very common.) One downside of the Lindy is that it requires a driver. \nThis has been my experience on 2017 and 2018 15\" MBPs running High Sierra and Mojave. \n\nA: The USB drives on the Macbook don't support \"Charge While Sleeping\" feature. I've tested this out by leaving my iPhone charged while the Mac is on and then when I put it to sleep it turns the power off.\nSome Windows laptops support this but Apple hasn't as of yet. Maybe in the future. This is why you are having issues with your adapters. You can't force the USB-C ports to charge while sleep, that is a BIOS feature that is often built into the motherboard.\n", "Q: iPad out of battery and won't charge even if plugged in My iPad ran out of battery, was on charging whole night but still showing the “need charging icon” when I plug in.. Sometimes (I don't know whats trigger it) it displays charging icon, charges for 5 min, boot up with 2% then it shuts down and then does the same thing again. Last time I tired pressing home and lock button to keep alive the charging icon about 50 mins, boot up and the same thing happened again.\nI tried DFU, recovery and many more but can't enter..\nAny recent method?\nTried this: https://discussions.apple.com/message/25454333#25454333\nUsual behaviour:\n\n\n*\n\n*Need charging icon while plugged in charging.\n\n*After a while \"Need charging icon\" changes to \"Charging icon\"\n\n*It starts booing, shuts down and display \"Need charging icon\"\n\n\nAnd it's going on for a long time, I don't think the iPad could handle it if it really wasn’t charging...\n\nA: Sometimes lint or dust end up in the charging port of the ipad and the charging cables don't make contact properly (happened to me just one week after buying my iPad Pro and I was panicking). Try gently cleaning the port with a dry air pump or just a microfiber cloth, or even a toothpick.\n\nA: Because you have already tries the classic things, I would suggest that you either:\n\n\n*\n\n*have a damaged charge port\n\n*have a dead or dying battery\n\n*have damaged the charge circuit on the logic board.\n\n\nTake a magnifying glass and inspect the inside of the charge port and look for and damaged pins/contacts. To test the battery, use a battery utility, such as [http://www.coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/|coconutBattery] (for Mac) or [http://www.3u.com/|3uTools] (for Windows). It will tell you what the health of the battery is. Anything less than 70% of design capacity will require replacement. Finally, if you have been using non-original charging bricks (especially cheapo car chargers), you may have damaged the charge circuit on the logic board. This can be repaired but requires micro-soldering.\n\nA: Try shutting down your ipad using the sleep button, that worked for me once.\n\nA: I agree with @Minho.  the first thing I'd try with these symptoms, is to try a NEW or different Apple cable on a different power cube.  There are chips inside the cables themselves that can go bad, or stop working when they heat up. So, the cables can go bad, but still look brand new.  \nIf it's not the cable.  Since there is not enough power to boot the phone, it's in charge-only mode.  It will stay there until at least 5% charged, or there-abouts.  So, if there is a misbehaving app that's depleting the battery as fast or faster than the device can charge, it's not going to get out of it until we can get that app killed.  I've been in this loop before, it's difficult to get out.  I'm not sure if your device has actually gotten charged up enough to boot up completely, but if it ever gets to the home screen, I'd reboot it immediately, Home + Sleep button for over 5 Seconds.\nYou have mentioned DFU, so I'd send you to the Apple store.  They can help you, but I can't say if it will be free or not.\n", "Q: Insert references from Endnote into a Keynote presentation In PowerPoint for Windows it is possible to insert references directly from Endnote into PowerPoint.

See picture as example:\n\nHere is my ~/.bash_profile\n# Beautify bash prompt\nfunction parse_git_branch {\n  git branch --no-color 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \\(.*\\)/on \\1/'\n}\nexport PS1=\"\\e[1;30m\\u\\e[m in \\e[0;34m\\w\\e[m \\e[0;32m\\$(parse_git_branch)\\e[m \\e[0;37m// \\$(date '+%H:%M')\\e[m\\n$ \"\n\n# Extend PATH for Homebrew\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:$PATH\"\nexport PATH=\"$(brew --prefix homebrew/php/php70)/bin:$PATH\"\n\n# Alias definitions.\n# You may want to put all your additions into a separate file like\n# ~/.bash_aliases, instead of adding them here directly.\n# See /usr/share/doc/bash-doc/examples in the bash-doc package.\n\nif [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then\n    . ~/.bash_aliases\nfi\n\nIt is not a big issue, but somewhat annoying especially when working with tmux during ssh sessions.\nDoes anyone know what is causing this or how I might resolve it?\n\nA: This issue has been corrected in macOS Mojave 10.14.\n\nA: Definitely not the ideal solution, but try adding\nosascript -e 'tell app \"Terminal\" to set number of rows of window 1 to 100'\n\nto your ~/.bash_profile.\nThis runs an AppleScript every time you open a new tab. (This may not work for you specifically. I don't know enough about how tmux works)\n\nA: I was able to fix this, at least temporarily, by opening the Inspector via Shell -> Show Inspector, going to the info tab, and reducing the \"columns\" by 1.  Then I dragged the window back to the desired size and it seems to look proper now.  I had to do that for each tab.  It seems to need to be done again every time I restart terminal, which is monumentally annoying, but fortunately I don't close it all that often.  It seems to work, at least as a kludgy workaround.  Good luck.\n", "Q: how install postgres 9.6 and a corresponding PostGIS How do I install postgres 9.6 and a corresponding PostGIS on macOS Sierra using perhaps homebrew?\n\nA: Postgres.app\nThe easiest way to use Postgres with PostGIS on a Mac is Postgres.app. This is a special build of Postgres wrapped to act like a normal Mac app, including launch with a double-click. The latest versions come with PostGIS built in.\nInstaller by EnterpriseDB.com\nIf you want to a run a Postgres installation on your Mac in a manner similar to that on other Unix-like platforms (BSD, Linux, etc.), I suggest downloading a graphical installer app provided by the EnterpriseDB.com company as a courtesy to the community. Follow the macOS links from the Postgres site to the EDB site’s download page. Note that EnterpriseDB makes their own editions of Postgres with added value, in addition to providing the \"plain\" Postgres. \nSource code\nThe hard-core developer or DBA will download the Postgres source code and compile it herself. \nI've not had the nerve to try that. You may be motivated to do so either for fun or because you want to tweak some of the internal Postgres settings that are modifiable only during compilation and not at runtime. \nFYI: The core team creating Postgres provides only source code. Any app or installer you may obtain is the product of additional persons’ work. \n", "Q: How can I slow down scroll on mac more than the system preferences let me I've gone into system preferences and made scroll as slow as it allows me to, but it's still way too fast.\nI'm using a logitech mouse, but logitech's software doesn't seem to work.

If your able to get the devices serial number your best bet would be to file a police report at your local police station.\nIf it was stolen back in January odds are it has already been erased and/or resold. So even if there would’ve been a way to track it, you wouldn’t be able to anymore.\nEdit 1\nIf you enable 2 step verification, if the thief tries to log into you Apple ID on the stolen computer, it will show on your other devices an authentication code for that devices, aswell as the location of the device that is requesting permission.\nSo if the thief tries to log into your Apple ID and you have Two Step Verification enable, it will show you the stolen devices location.\nApple cannot track your device as it would most likely violate some privacy policy, though if you give them your consent they might be able to track your device.

But I cannot find any information on the web if it already possible. Can anyone that has Apple Watch confirm, that you can now track skiing activity, and if so, what exactly can you track? Does it offer similar capabilities as Slopes or Trace apps?\n\nA: There's still no ski tracking capabilities in any of the Apple Watch series. \nBut, all the data inputs needed are there. Barometer, motion tracking, heart rate tracking, location via GPS and cell tower trilateration, etc...\nAfter the initial announcement, Apple referenced that this feature would be available toward the end of 2017, probably before winter.  \nThe HomePod IPSW leak a few months ago provided some indication that Apple would add this feature to Workouts.  This screen grab shows there's references to skiing workouts already built into the firmware.\n\nFor now, you can use the myriad of different ski tracking apps out there.\n", "Q: Can I force AirDrop to work on High Sierra without WiFi hardware?

AirDrop continued to work just fine over ethernet. The lack of a Wi-Fi Card might be what is causing AirDrop not to enable it self in High Sierra. \nIs there any third-party app or system modification that performs the same functionality on 10.13?\n\nA: Please note that my answer has not been updated after it was made clear that the Wi-Fi hardware had been disabled/removed.\nYou can add AirDrop to Finder favourites by going to Preferences->Sidebar and ticking the box next to AirDrop.\nIf it's missing from there, you can reset the Finder settings by deleting the following files:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist\nLog out/reboot/force quit Finder to reload the settings.\nThe Apple support page says AirDrop is supported on 2009 and newer models\n\nA: EDIT: Below was in answer to the original High Sierra question, but it appears that the original question has changed when the hardware issue came to light.

I simply want to turn it off. Can anyone offer a suggestion on how to do this?\n\nA: Deleting your old email address off the ipad will not delete the account itself it merely removes the username / password from the iPad so it will not attempt to log in.

Do not place hard drives or other USB devices behind the rear of your Mac near at the hinge of your screen. The antennas for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are located there, and USB 3 devices placed there may interfere with your wireless connections.\nThe problem can stem from the radio frequency interference generated by the USB 3.0 hard drive. If you have external hard drive, you’ll need to remove them from around the vicinity of your MacBook’s hinge, where the Bluetooth radio is located. It’s best to relocate the devices further away if possible.\n", "Q: Automatically Inhibit sleep while transferring files over the network? I was transferring some files over the network and my macbook pro just fell asleep. I had the \"Wake for network traffic\" in Preferences>Energy checked. I am using High Sierra. It doesn't sound like Apple not to prevent sleeping while you are conducting an operation. This a bug or a feature? \n\nA: You can install 3rd part app Caffeine. you can turn it on to prevent your mac from sleeping. Other popular apps are Anti Sleep and Amphetamine. I'm pretty sure all 3 are free. Amphetamine is also available from the App Store. I personally use Caffeine and it works well. It adds a coffee cup icon to menu bar so you can easily turn it on or off.\nCaffeine may actually come with newer system upgrades so check your Applications folder.\n\nA: I am not sure how familiar you are with it, but the terminal command caffeinate will keep your computer from sleeping. This lets you add it as part of a script, and doesn't rely on third party applications (Caffeine just runs that command anyway, it's not adding any functionality that didn't already exist).\nThis way, you can activate it when transferring files, either manually or part of some automated workflow (eg. a bash script or with Alfred workflows, etc.) \n", "Q: A keychain cannot be found to store \"NETWORK.\" I just recently purchased a refurbished MacBook Air from Apple running Sierra. \nFor the most part it is functioning just how I would expect it to, except for the following: for certain networks (it appears to be limited to just wpa2 personal networks. wpa2 enterprise with RADIUS authentication connects automatically just fine) it will not remember the pass. \nI leave the network, rejoin, and get prompted with the message:\n\nA keychain cannot be found to store \"NETWORK.\"\n\nIt gives me an option to reset the keychain, which I would love to do (there are no custom CA/client certificates on here yet, just a stock certificate bank), but when it prompts me to put in my password, I can't type anything in the box. \nI have tried the solution listed here, but still get the same result.\n\nA: A restart after applying system updates fixed this issue.\n\nA: There might be some system update which must be waiting, try restarting the Mac.\n", "Q: Trackpad does not function after 8 hours of sleep Yesterday I left my MacBook to sleep for a long 8 hours and usually I wake up my MacBook by clicking the trackpad but today surprisingly the trackpad did not have that 'click' noise I could move the cursor around but I could not click on anything but after a restart the trackpad functioned correctly.

I always forget keyboard shortcuts to scripts I write (or sometimes the keyboard shortcuts I use don't work in a certain application). I'm looking for a service that I can remedy this by allowing me to use a certain hotkey, which brings up a window which allows me to write the first part of the name of one of my scripts (say, get_date, which just returns today's date in mm-dd-yy format), and it allows me to then invoke it for the functionality I need. I can't seem to find this, and I'm getting ready to embark on writing my own if I can't find one. Anyone know where to find something that I can use to do this?\n\nA: Alfred can at least get very close to what you want. You do need the Powerpack license to use workflows in it (~£19).\nIt is somewhat manual, but to me it doesn't seem too cumbersome...\nGive each script two triggers: Keyword trigger and Hotkey trigger and you can then write what the shortcut is in the subtext field of the Keyword trigger (for example). This way every time you use the keyword trigger ...probably because you forgot the shortcut, you still get a reminder of what the shortcut key combo is.\nBecause the keyword I chose was similar to the Date and time preferences, it shows up too, but Alfred does adjust the order based on use, so after first use, the script would show up above the preferences given that I've never opened date and time preferences through Alfred. You can also exclude files from showing up in Alfred. For example,\n I got a workflow that opens dropbox folder... so I excluded Dropbox.app from Alfred because it is set to open on startup so I have no need to open it through Alfred.\nObviously every time you change the shortcut, you have to edit the subtext too.\n\nIf you want to trigger automator workflow from alfred, I believe this is still the best method: link. It's been a while since I looked into it so there is a good chance my info on this is outdated.\n\nA: I think that FastScripts solves this, I've tried it before, maybe Alfred\n", "Q: Accidentally deleted /etc/paths I had recently messed up my $PATH variable so I thought if fixing it by removing the /etc/paths but I found out online solutions to fix the $PATH variable  by just editing the ~/.bash_profile so I moved the /etc/paths to the trash but then I accidentally emptied the trash so now its gone so now should I worry about some critical system apps to stop working if yes how should I fix this?\n\nA: The /etc/paths file is used as an initial value for the PATH variable.

Should I assume that it would still have iOS 9 installed when I get it out of the box?\n\nA: There is no way for anyone here to give you a definitive answer to that question. Although the iPad mini 4 originally shipped with iOS 9.0 (13A340), it also fully supports the latest iterations of iOS 11.\nIn a nutshell, you should not assume that the one you buy will have iOS 9 as the version of iOS it has pre-installed will depend on when it was manufactured. Because of this, if it is new, it's likely to have a version of either iOS 10 or iOS 11.\n\nA: If the unit is still factory sealed, you can look up its production week by serial number and extrapolate the iOS build currently on it from there. With that said, a unit with iOS 9 might be a bit tough to come by at this point. You might have better luck trying for iOS 10 instead, although it's not clear to me whether this is an option for you.\nRegardless, SarahB from /r/jailbreak outlined this process here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check on this Wiki the date, when the last non-jailbreakable iOS version was released.\nSo, for the iPhone 6S / 6S Plus this would be 9.1 which Apple released\non 21/10/2015 (US: 10/21/2015 or 21st of October 2015 :)\n\n*We have to check the week number of the given date. We learn here that 21/10/2015 occurred during week 43. We now know that every iPhone produced before week 43 comes 100% with < iOS 9.1 and can be jailbroken. There's a very high chance that even iPhones produced in week 43/44 will come with a jailbreakable firmware but go with a lower week if you want to be sure.\n\n*Now we enter the serial number  in this\nwebsite which\nwill reveal the production week number:\n\n\nHere's an example what it looks like for my iPhone 6:\n\nAccording to the wiki page above it has been originally shipped with iOS 8.0.x\nand can be jailbroken. Yay ;)\n\n\n*You now have to insist in the shop to check the serial numbers until you find the right one. This method works for iPhones / iPads and most likely for other iDevices too.\n\n\nI had walked through this process myself with an iPhone 6S Plus and can confirm it still gives valid information. An iPad Mini 4 would likely work as well.\n\nA: No, a new iPad will have a new iOS version, probably 11.\n", "Q: Is there an app for Mac to check app network activity?

I try to establish a serial connection with my MacBook (High Sierra 10.13.1) and need help.\nI have a Belkin F5U103V USB-to-serial adapter and want to connect to a HP ProCurve switch. I tried to follow several instructions such as this one or the installation instructions in the ZIP-archive of this driver but none of this worked.\nAfter the installation of the mentioned driver of my device, all of the instructions I found asked me to use the ls /dev/tty.*, ls /dev/*usb* or the ls /dev/cu.* command to find out the device which is associated with the usb port. This is the step wich fails for me.\nThe ls /dev/*usb* command does not return a result at all. The two other commands return\n\n/dev/cu.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port\n/dev/cu.SOC\n/dev/cu.MALS\n/dev/cu.iPhonevonFirstnameLastname-Wire\n\n(and the same name with tty. instead of cu. respectively), which means, that I am not able to find a serial device which is associated with the usb port.\nAfter the installation of the driver I had a \"USB serial controller\" in my network settings. When I change the modem to a \"Null modem\", set the baud to 9600 and try to connect, a popup appears that says that my device is not available.\n\nStrangely, when I try to connect to the switch via Serial App, I can see the USB serial port and it works perfectly to connect to the switch which means that the USB-to-serial device works fine generally.\n\nI want to open the serial port with the build in screen command preferably (screen <device> <baud>). What is the reason why I cannot find the device as mentioned in the instructions and how can I use the build-in tools to open a serial connection without 3rd party software?\nIf it is relevant, I have a MacBook Pro 2016 which means that I have USB-to-serial adapter which is plugged in into a USB-c-to-USB adapter.\n\nA: You need a specific driver for the USB-Serial device. MacOS support for these - especially in recent versions of the OS - is spotty, at best. You need to check even ones that claim MacOS support because their support might have worked up until about 10.6, when Apple started getting serious about kernel and driver security, sandboxing, etc.\nFWIW, USB-Serial devices based on the Prolific chipset seem to have most luck.\nSerial.app works because it uses its own driver, not the /dev device. For most uses, I'd say this app is required if you want to maintain sanity.\n\nA: A late entry to this question, but hopefully this will help someone: \nFor serial comms using a late-model Mac, my experience is that there are two things you should know: \n\n\n*\n\n*Tripp-Lite USB-C-to-DB9 cable \n\n*Jeroen's USB Serial Driver \nThese are not intended as \"commercial endorsements\"; I have absolutely no financial stake in either. They're simply tools that allowed me to get where I needed to be, and ended hours of failure and frustration. Everything else I tried was half-baked and not-ready-for-prime-time: Unsigned drivers, drivers that occasionally worked, drivers provided on mini-CD hard media (?! - didn't even know they made these any longer until I bought the Tripp-Lite cable), interface cables that \"just didn't work\", etc, etc, etc. If you're interested, there are a few more details posted on my GitHub page. \nAnd as far as CoolTerm goes: I used this program for years, and really liked it. Unfortunately, running it now (HighSierra 10.13.6) generates \"warnings\" that it's not optimized for Mac. I don't know if there's a 64-bit version coming or not. \nHope that helps. \n\nA: I've been using CoolTerm since 2014 to serial talk with the barometer chip hooked up to my Arduino. Straight USB, no USB to serial cord needed.\nPretty easy to set up, and plays nice with AppleScript.\nFree, so you've little to lose trying it.\n", "Q: Get list of networked devices via CLI I want to get all the entries I would normally get via Finder, but using command line.

The problem is you need to search for all the potential items.\nScreen sharing, AFP file sharing, SMB file sharing, etc...\nWorse, if you have Back to My Mac and iCloud connected devices, not all of them are local, but they are still discoverable from the command line:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to terminal login remotely (outside local network) to my mac at home via SSH + VPN?\n\n*Does Apple Remote Desktop connect to computers over the internet?\n\n*Screen Share connects to wrong device\nIf you wanted to pick apart all the ports / protocols you could use the Network Utility to port scan each device you see in you finder sidebar and look for the common ports that are listening.\nApple’s big list of ports and names is here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202944\nI think you’ll get good coverage if you start with remote control, file sharing (VNC/AFP/SMB) though.\n\nA: You can use two commands:  ping and arp to get the info that you need.\nping allows you to broadcast to your network and any device that on the network and capable of responding will reply.\nLet's assume your network is 192.168.1.0.  Broadcast your ping by using the broadcast address 192.168.1.255\n$ ping 192.168.1.255 \n\nThis will go on forever, so either ControlC or use the -t option to set  a timeout.  For example, for 20 seconds of pining...\n$ ping -t 20 192.168.1.255\n\nYou will get a bunch of responses; some of which  will be duplicate.  This will continue for 20 seconds then stop.\nNext, arp to find the names:\n$ arp -a\n\nallans-imac.home (192.168.1.12) at a8:20:66:40:5b:10 on en0 ifscope permanent [ethernet]\ngrace-pc.home (192.168.1.18) at 0:34:f6:5:f7:29 on en0 ifscope [ethernet]\ngrace-iphone.home (192.168.1.150) at b8:63:3a:14:3e:f7 on en0 ifscope [ethernet]\nnas.home (192.168.1.23) at 0:12:43:20:aa:3d on en0 ifscope [ethernet]\n\nThat's a truncated sample of the output from my network (names, MACs and IPs randomized for security).  As you can see, it includes the hostnames and MACs of devices I have on my network.  \nSleeping devices (like my HP printer and my MacBook Pro) didn't respond and aren't in the arp table.  Then again, they don't show up in Finder, either.\nWith the application of grep and awk, you should be able to extract what you need.\n", "Q: Spaces disappear (but not their application windows) when I unplug external monitors I use Spaces (aka Desktops) to organize my work--I have a Space for email & Omnifocus, a Space for chat & calendar, and a Space for each of my main projects, plus a couple of full-screen application windows which are of course their own Spaces. When I'm at my desk, I have two monitors plus the screen of my MacBook Pro, and I have certain Spaces on each screen. When I unplug my laptop for a meeting, of course all the Spaces move from the external displays to the laptop. That isn't a problem. What is a problem is that application windows have suddenly moved to other Spaces. It looks like the Mac has decided a couple of Spaces don't exist and shoved their windows into other Spaces.\nFor example, right now I have chat and calendar in Desktop 6, which is currently displayed on my laptop screen while I type this on one of the other monitors. Then I unplug the external monitors, suddenly only four numbered Desktop Spaces exist (plus both the full-screen application windows), and chat and calendar are part of Desktop 1 along with the windows that had already been part of Desktop 1. So basically the problem seems to be that some Spaces are dropped and their apps get shoved into whatever existing Spaces are available. What might be causing that and how can I avoid it?\nWhen I plug the external displays back in, suddenly I have six numbered Spaces again and windows that were originally together in one Space are together again, but the Spaces are numbered differently and some of them have moved from one screen to another. For example, chat and calendar (which were originally Desktop 6 and then got shoved into Desktop 1) are now Desktop 5, and they're on an external monitor instead of the laptop screen. In fact, every Space that used to be on the laptop screen is now on that external monitor, and vice versa.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why do Spaces disappear when I unplug external monitors, and how do I stop it from happening?\n\n*How can I get Spaces to return to the same monitors they were on before, when I plug those monitors back in?\n\n\nOther details:\n\n\n*\n\n*MacOS 10.12.6\n\n*External monitors are connected via CalDigit Thunderbolt 3 dock\n\n*System Preferences -> Mission Control has the following settings checked:\n\n\n*\n\n*When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application\n\n*Group windows by application\n\n*Displays have separate Spaces\n\nA: @vykor pointed me in the right direction: the behavior I was seeing is a side effect of the \"Displays have separate Spaces\" setting.\n\n\n*\n\n*Why do Spaces disappear when I unplug external monitors, and how do I stop it from happening?\n\n\n*\n\n*Why: because displays have separate Spaces, which means when there are fewer displays there are fewer Spaces. (One of those things that's obvious in retrospect.) \n\n*How to stop it: unchecking the \"Displays have separate Spaces\" setting does stop Spaces from disappearing, but the new behavior isn't any better for my needs: windows end up jumbled up on a single monitor when I reconnect the monitors, and all screens cycle through Spaces in unison making it hard to make good use of the screen real estate.\n\n\n*How can I get Spaces to return to the same monitors they were on before, when I plug those monitors back in?\n\n\n*\n\n*There doesn't seem to be a built-in way to do this, so the answer here seems to be to install a window management app such as Stay.\n\n\n\nI've turned \"Displays have separate Spaces\" back on, and I'm setting up Stay to have a configuration for the laptop display alone and for the three monitor setup, so that I can quickly restore my windows to my desired arrangement in either situation. I'm still working the kinks out with Stay, but I think that's going to be a good solution.\n", "Q: What is causing High Sierra to forget where my home directory is? The initial problem\nI have been encountering a sporadic problem where my Mac seems to \"forget\" where my home directory is.\nThe first clue (because this is something I do very frequently) is always that Google Chrome can't open a new tab. I get the \"oh snap\" error screen. This leads me to quit Chrome and restart it, which in turn leads to this error dialog, after which Chrome does not start:\n\nOther symptoms\nMany other things that require knowledge of the home directory also fail:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I open some Apple apps (e.g. Preview, Notes, Messages), I get prompted with a dialog that says it needs to repair my home directory and requires me to authenticate. Entering my password here causes /var/empty/Library's owner to be changed to me (which is bad in the long term, but allows some things to begin working).\n\n\n*\n\n*\n\n\n*Safari simply doesn't open when clicked --  it appears briefly in the dock and then disappears, with no Crash Report dialog (although I can't say whether the system in this state is aware of my preference to see those dialogs).\n\n*Even after \"repairing my Library\", many apps cannot open:\n\n\n*\n\n*Preview: a Finder dialog appears: The application \"Preview\" can't be opened.\n\n*Chrome: same error dialog as before, pictured above\n\n*Notes: the dock icon appears and then disappears.\n\n\n*After repairing my Library, some apps that couldn't open before now can, and many of these have forgotten my settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Safari (which I'm using now to write this question while I research)\n\n*BBEdit\n\n*Pixelmator\n\n*Notes\n\n\n*Some apps appear to be unaffected regardless of the Library permissions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Console\n\n*System Preferences\n\n*Keychain Access\n\n\n*I can't take screenshots unless I use Grab or hold Control to write the screenshot to the clipboard (because it doesn't have write access to /var/empty/Desktop, which is correctly owned by root). \n\n*In Open and Save dialogs, it doesn't show my home directory in the sidebar, nor any of the common destinations within (Desktop, Documents, etc). \n\n*When the screen saver activates, the system default (Flurry) appears instead of my usual (Classic pointed at a directory of photos I've selected).\n\n*Terminal uses default settings for color/font/etc instead of my customized settings.\n\n\nStill other things appear to be working fine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine\n\n*Spotlight\n\n*Hot Corners\n\n\nThis has happened three times so far since upgrading my work machine to High Sierra a couple days after it was released.\nThe research\nResearch seems to indicate that macOS doesn't think my home directory is /var/empty, but rather that it doesn't know that I have a home directory, and there's some fallback logic somewhere that causes the system to use /var/empty for any user who doesn't have a home directory. (Source: Is it possible to create a user without a home directory?)\nFurther research indicates that /var/empty exists as a \"security jail\" for users who shouldn't have access to anything (which is why it's bad to change permissions or symlink it elsewhere).

Once I've submitted this question, I'm going to try disconnecting/reconnecting my network cable and logging out to see if either of those help; I'll come back and edit this paragraph accordingly. Update: I disconnected and reconnected my network cable, then restarted Finder. Chrome works again, and all other symptoms appear to have been resolved as well!

I found several that seem to be errors caused by the problem, but none that appear to be the problem. I suspect this is caused by the fact that you can't scroll the endless stream of all messages from all subsystems back to earlier than whenever you opened Console, and there is also no apparent way to search more than one file at a time, unless you want to search the aforementioned forward-only stream. I didn't have Console running when things went south, so I guess I'm out of luck? (I'd very much appreciate any help/advice here.)\nI've seen a number of other cases where people have the same problem, going back as far as 2014 (10.9 Mavericks).

Those checkboxes are checked on my system, but I've never seen (nor declined) such a confirmation dialog, so I don't think that's the case here. Nonetheless, this is not a shared machine, and so those boxes are now unchecked.\n\n\n*https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=1239175\n\n\n*\n\n*There were never any replies to this thread, so I took a chance and asked this user if they ever found a problem.

It's a Jamf-managed device, and I authenticate to an Active Directory domain. My profile in the Users and Groups prefpane is labeled \"Admin, Managed, Mobile\". \nWe began using Jamf where I work right after I upgraded to High Sierra, so this could be a Jamf problem or a High Sierra problem (or, really, anything else).\nThere are numerous other Mac users, numerous other High Sierra users and numerous other Jamf users; to my knowledge, no other users are experiencing this problem. I am the only iMac user -- all other Macs here are laptops. (I struggle to imagine that my iMac is the problem -- just being thorough.)\nThis problem starts happening in the middle of a user session. Everything's fine, until suddenly it's not. As such, I don't think it has anything to do with login or Active Directory.\nWhat I'm looking for\nI'm looking for an answer which prevents macOS from getting into this state in the first place, and hopefully explains when and how it happens.\n\nA: Open a bug with Apple on this.  I have an open case, but they need to hear from more people on this.   I see this on rare occasion, but only on my computer connected to Active Directory with my managed, mobile account (so my guess is it's just another of the many AD bugs in 10.13 that remain unfixed.)\nI find that if I generate a sysdiagnose (to update my case), the problem goes away while the sysdiagnose is generating, too.\nBut, it's nothing I can force to happen, so I don't know what causes this.\n\nA: The long term answer is to not bind any Mac to AD and get a tool to loosely couple the user permissions and leverage kerberos to authenticate.\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Enterprise Connect - you pay for a professional services engagement to discover / configure and document the solution for your environment. https://www.apple.com/support/professional/\n\n*NoMAD and/or NoMAD Pro - https://nomad.menu - open source tools with paid support and consulting options as well from the vendor.\n\n\nBinding is painful, and that pain grows the longer you let it fester and constrict. Your question is solid and I hope someone has a quick fix for you, but I've seen several organizations walk (or run) away from the bind once they pilot NoMAD and commit to AEC or NoMAD at scale. Having JAMF Pro in place will really help you deploy either tool.\n\nA: I found the following to \"correct\" the issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences > Users & Groups\n\n*Unlock the pane\n\n*Right click on the effected user account > Advanced Options...\n\n*Next to Home directory: click Choose...\n\n*Click Open\n\n*Click OK\n\n\nThis seems to have re-written the home directory path and allowed functionality to return.\nIn my case, logging out and back in resulted in a black screen with a cursor - though after a soft reboot able to log back in, long progress bar then everything was back to normal.\nHope this helps! Good luck!\n\nA: Are you guys mapping UID's to different attributes? In the past when I've seen this in OS X / MacOS it's because we mapped UID's to a universal ID internally (it was the same across UNIX and AD) and it barfed when trying to do that translation. Users lost permissions to their home directories and showed the symptoms you're seeing in Finder, etc.\nIn Directory Utility you can see \"Map UID to attribute:\" in the Mappings tab under Active Directory.\n\nA: This happens to my work computer (AD attached) whenever Chrome needs to update and I quit and restart the application. I'm guessing that it's some kind of issue with the updater (which is basically silent) trying to rewrite to the user directory when uids and such are not locally managed.  \nWhat worked for me was simply to reset all internet connections; e.g., unplug ethernet and turned off WiFi\n\nA: FWIW, this isn't a Chrome issue. When this issue occurs, it affects other apps as well. Not to suggest this as a fix, but if you follow the Jamf Nation URL, you'll see my post at the bottom of the thread. We manage a rather large environment of Macs. We have a policy to un-bind a Mac from Active Directory, and another to bind a Mac to Active Directory. For some strange reason, unbinding then rebinding seems to \"fix\" the problem. I put \"fix\" in quotes because it is nothing more than a hail mary that probably has nothing to do with the root issue at all. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n", "Q: Is iPhone X availble in the USA I am living in Germany and want to know if is currently possible to buy iPhone X in the USA? If I visit an Apple Store tomorrow will I be able to get iPhone X or not? \n\nA: Yes, the iPhone X is currently available to purchase online and in Apple stores.  \nHowever, there's no guarantee that the store you visit will have the X in stock when you arrive.\nYou can try to order one thru the Apple US store site, select a pickup store, and then check the store stock (all thru the store site).  That's your best way of ensuring a store has stock when you place your order.\n\nA: The best way to find what iPhone is in stock at a particular store is iStockNow. I have found that they have a very up to date web site that is easier and faster to search than Apple's website or App store app. I have used it to find an iPhones the initial release week crush.

Can I upgrade the memory to 16GB?\n\nA: This term configurable refers to the fact that when you order a Mac from Apple you can choose to configure it with more RAM. You cannot do this after purchase yourself, as the RAM is soldered on during the manufacturing process.\nOther configurable options when buying a Mac usually include the size and/or type of storage, the processor you wish to have, bundled software, and so on.

I have a few apps, but most of my space is taken up by photos and videos. Now I do run low on memory, sometimes I have just 500MB left, but I just let it be. If I get too low, about 100MB, I free up some space (upto 1GB).\nI've noticed this a few times now: Sometimes I get a low storage warning, and I see that I have around 100MB left, but I wait till I have time to free up some storage. But after few hours, when I get time to free up, I see that my phone now has cleared up some storage on its own. Means I now have around 1GB free (for example).\nMy question is how was the storage cleared? What was deleted \"automatically\" by the phone to create space?\nUPDATE: When I said my phone cleared up space from 100MB to 1GB, that was an example of sort, it usually clears up around 300MB on its own. grgarside's answer(regarding clearing of cache) is the most applicable to my case and hence I'm marking it as accepted.\n\nA: Is your iCloud Photo Library on? If so, then iCloud could be backing up your photos for you and removing the copies of the older photos that are backed up, from the phone.\nYou can check that by clicking on Settings -> Your Name -> iCloud -> Photos and make sure that it is on. Click on Photos and check and see if Optimize iPhone photo storage is checked as well.\n\nA: While application Caches are indeed part of the cleanup process, an increase in free space this large is typically the OS deleting a pre-downloaded newer iOS update.  In your case, this would be iOS 11 (which is currently showing at 1.24 GB).\nYou can also manually remove an iOS update that has been pre-downloaded from within the Settings > General > Storage page if you need some quick space for taking photos or videos.\n\nA: Yes both Photos and Apple Music have an Optimize feature. In IOS 11 there is even a setting to offload is unused Apps.\n\nA: Personally i have also realised that everytime my phone goes low on memory, and it clears on its own, some functionalities like built-in dictionary will not work when i do look-up on words. probably because the system temporarily turns it off or deletes it to clear space. At once i had redownload the dictionaries but most times they start working well when i clear some space.\n\nA: App containers include a folder called Caches. This folder can be emptied by iOS when storage becomes low.\niOS chooses apps which you use rarely and apps which have large quantities of cache stored to be cleaned first. iOS shows the app name as \"Cleaning…\" briefly on the home screen when this process takes place.\nThere are other system caches which can be cleared too, but caches within containers are usually the largest and first to go.\n", "Q: VirtualBox 5.2 Won't Install on Mac OS 10.13 Trying to install VirtualBox 5.2 on a Mac running OSX 10.13.

I pretty much always have two different workspaces that have a window of Google Chrome open.\nEver since I updated from Yosemite to High Sierra, I've had this weird issue where, when I switch to one of the Chrome workspaces, it'll instantly jump to the other Chrome workspace (even though there's like 4 other workspaces between them).\nI can't seem to figure out the precise set of conditions that causes this; it's random as far as I can tell (although, infuriatingly, once it does happen, it'll probably happen again immediately after when I try to correct). It can happen whether I'm switching workspaces via keyboard shortcut or trackpad gesture, but I don't think I've ever seen it happen if I open Mission Control to switch workspaces. I've only seen it happen with Chrome, but then, Chrome is the only application that I ever have open in multiple workspaces.\nI've tried toggling the \"When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application.\" option in System Preferences->Mission Control, but it happens whether this is turned on or off.\nDoes anyone know what might be causing this and how I might fix it?\n\nA: Via @stickj in the comments way above, this seems to have worked for me:\nBy way of Apple forum: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4995042 \nDo this in terminal: \ndefaults write com.apple.dock workspaces-auto-swoosh -bool NO \n\nfollowed by \nkillall Dock\n\nThe latter restarts the Dock to apply the prefs change. Alternatively, reboot (though why when you can restart the service :)).\nThere is a caveat:\n\nThank you for this. But now the problem is that when you click on an icon in the Dock it won't take you to that app and when you have a lot of things open across different desktops it sometimes is hard to find the app you're looking for.\n\nOne person suggests:\n\nThere's a easier solution (if I'm reading the OP's post correctly). -- Go to System Preferences/Mission Control and uncheck the box that says \"When swithching applications, switch to another space with open windows for that application.\"\n\nBut this option actually seems to override that selection. (Toggling that selection does not change this option, this option does not exist until you've written to it).\n\nA: The only work-around I've found for this is to move the window that keeps stealing focus to another workspace. If I move it back to the previous workspace it will exhibit the same behaviour, so I need to delete that workspace and create it again, and then move the window back to it.\nUpgrading to 10.13.2 didn't fix it for me.\nUpdate: Upgraded to 10.13.3 and the issue is still there.\n\nA: UPD.: Nope, Apple's support is traditionally second to useless.

I have no idea why... there's nothing special about these emails, they're from a variety of sources, and those same sources sometimes come through normally, and sometimes not.\nWhat is causing only some emails, some of the time, from only this specific GMail account, to go to Recovered Messages instead of my normal inbox like they should?\nActually I did just notice something they have in common.  Every one of them would have fallen into a rule I've set up, to move the messages into specific folders.  But I have lots of other messages that would also have triggered the same rules, and were unaffected.\nAn additional piece of information - these messages apparently will not move to their correct places even if I apply my rules to them.  They appear to - they disappear from Recovered Messages but they will eventually reappear there again.  They span almost 24 hours from yesterday to today (November 13).  I have tried a rebuild, but it did nothing.\n\nA: Have you added and removed your GMail account recently?

The message and button remain... I've even rebooted. It's still there.\n\nA: This is a new feature in macOS High Sierra that blocks kernel extensions from 3rd-party developers until manually allowed via the Security & Privacy preferences pane. Note this is different from Gatekeeper — this blocks signed kexts until you allow them, and all unsigned kexts are blocked unless System Integrity Protection is disabled. Gatekeeper blocks unsigned apps from running until you allow them. Apple has some further details in TN2459: User-Approved Kernel Extension Loading.\nAccording to reports such as this issue thread for Karabiner, programs that might be intercepting or simulating mouse clicks such as MagicPrefs or VNC could be at fault. If you can temporarily disable those programs, and be in front of the machine rather than connected remotely via Screen Sharing or similar, it will work.\nAs a more complex workaround, you can disable System Integrity Protection for kexts with csrutil enable --without kext, then reboot to the regular OS and ensure the Android emulator is working, then (optionally but recommended) reboot to Recovery Mode again and re-enable SIP with csrutil enable.

I am a small business owner and I have been working and developing a property management system in Access 2017. It works great and I've invested years and sweat & tears over this system. I run Insightly, FileMaker Pro, JotForms and other Mac based business software platforms on my Mac with iOS Sierra. FileMaker Pro is the biggest pain when it comes to external connectivity where I have to use ODBC drivers that are propriety to the FMpro people and not generic like in normal Windows ODBC connections. Besides, nothing beats Access for ease of use, form design, database application design, etc without the need to learn ASP.net, SQL Server, programming, etc.\nAfter reading this and this, I am thinking the answer to this question is simply, \"No!

I know apparently it’s not a good idea to close apps on your iPhone to save on battery. I’ve read questions and answers like Does force closing apps have any benefit on iOS devices? but it still doesn’t quite gel with me. Sometimes I have found over 50 apps running, so not closing them makes no sense.\nMaybe I’m a bit of an old chook and you just can’t teach old dogs new tricks, but can someone here explain WHY it’s better to just keep all these apps running? And when I say “explain” I mean in layman’s terms so I can understand.\n\nA: You’re not alone. People are just used to their desktop computer habits, and it’s understandable they carry these habits over to their iPhones and iPads. \nHowever, let me try and explain this using an analogy:\nImagine it’s a hot day and you’re outside gardening. You get thirsty, so you go inside to the kitchen, grab a large glass, put some ice in it, and fill it with water. You then drink half of it and empty the rest in the sink before going back outside. Not long later, you get thirsty again, so you go back inside to the kitchen, grab the same glass, put some ice in it, and fill it with water. Again you only drink half of it and empty the rest in the sink!\nThe above workflow just doesn’t really make sense. Why wouldn’t you take the glass outside with you? And, you’re not only wasting water by emptying it, but you’re spending more time and energy getting that water again.\nLikewise, when you quit an app you’re actually using some battery power in the process of doing so (e.g. clearing it from RAM, etc) and then again later when you have to launch it again and load it back into RAM. \nSo, for a great majority of the time it’s best to leave apps open. Even though they’re open, they’re really just sitting in a type of suspended mode that isn’t using any battery power whatsoever. Yes, the app is still loaded in RAM and taking space, but it’s not actually doing anything - it’s just lying there dormant. And, because it’s not using any battery power in this state, there’s no advantage to quitting it from a battery conservation point of view - especially if it’s an app you know you’re going to be using again and again throughout the day.\nThere’s also really no advantage to force quitting an app because iOS itself will do this for you if/when it needs to in order to free up RAM. So if you have 50 apps open and they stay open, then iOS hasn’t been pushed to the extent of needing to close any of them to free up memory.\nNow, like anything, there are always exceptions to the rule (such as apps that have to perform background tasks). An example of this is one that plays music while you’re doing other things with your phone, or one that’s downloading content in the background, or one that’s counting how many steps you walk in a day, etc. However, iOS has an extremely efficient process for managing background apps/tasks and if you choose to quit these you’re basically saying you don’t trust the operating system to do its job properly.\nSo, feel free to quit your apps when you have to (e.g. because it’s frozen, etc), but don’t do it to conserve battery power. In fact, if you do, you’ll be achieving the opposite and using more battery power throughout the day!\nSummary\n\n\n*\n\n*You only need to quit apps if they're not working properly (e.g. an app has frozen, it isn't displaying properly, etc).\n\n*Apps listed in the App Switcher are not necessarily running - in fact most of them are not running at all.\n\n*Most apps in the App Switcher will be in a suspended state - this means they're not: visible on screen, executing code, using the CPU or GPU, or using the battery. However, they are still resident in memory until they are purged (if necessary) by the system to free up memory:\n\nSuspended - The app is in the background but is not executing code. The system moves apps to this state automatically and does not notify them before doing so. While suspended, an app remains in memory but does not execute any code. When a low-memory condition occurs, the system may purge suspended apps without notice to make more space for the foreground app.\n\nSource: See Table 2-3 within the first reference link at end of this answer. \n\n*The only apps actually running on your iPhone at any given point in time are the active app (i.e. the one visible on screen) and any others working in the background. (Note: There are some temporary exceptions to this in the case of apps that still need time to complete executing code they already started while they were active - typically this is only in the order of seconds but could theoretically extend to over a minute.).\n\n*In terms of apps running in the background, you can control which apps are permitted to do so (if they're open) by going to Settings > General > Background App Refresh. (Note: Just because you see an app listed here doesn't mean it will run in the background, but disabling it here means it definitely won't!)\n\n*If your iPhone is locked, then the app that was active (i.e. it was visible on screen) when you locked your device is now inactive. However, unless you've only just locked your iPhone and it's still finishing executing code or it's running in the background (e.g. playing music, etc) then it's not using the CPU, GPU or battery.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*For more info about the various states an app can be in, refer to Apple's App Programming Guide for iOS: Execution States for Apps.\n\n*For more info about apps running in the background, refer to Apple's App Programming Guide for iOS: Background Execution.\n\n\nA: The provided answers are accurate, I just want to clarify from an iOS developer’s point of view. \niOS is designed to manage as many things as possible so you (and developers) don’t have to worry about them. The end result is a somewhat consistent approach across applications, including those from Apple (even tho sometimes Apple itself cuts some corners).\nThat being said, the premise is: \n\n\n*\n\n*iOS knows more about memory than us. It knows how much it has, and how much it needs (to a certain degree). \n\n*iOS has full control over the memory; it has the final word on who uses what. \n\n*If iOS needs memory, it will find it, and this is usually done by killing other processes that have been idle for some time (and there are many rules behind the scenes, we don’t know them all, and we don’t really worry about them).\n\n*Everything a Processor (CPU) does, takes energy. Absolutely everything. Don’t forget computers are just very tiny electron containers that move them around in very tiny spaces. \n\n*When an app is killed, there are some agreed protocols (contracts) that define what needs to be done. iOS enforces and carries these protocols. But work must be done, it’s not free and certainly not always cheap (it really depends on what the App is).\n\n\nHaving said all that, one assumes most users close apps in the hopes to increase battery life, under the impression that, by closing things, then less energy is wasted in maintaining these apps running. \nThe truth is that, on iOS, this is almost never the case. When you press home, the app is suspended and it no longer uses resources that other app may need. If a new app (or even iOS) needs that memory, it will take care of it by itself, but only if it needs. \nYou closing the apps over and over, are forcing iOS to make that potentially expensive task of really unloading an app, saving its state and what not, with the added problem that when you re-open the app, all that stuff has to be reverted and, depending upon the complexity of the app, a lot of things must be read from the storage, up into the main memory of the phone, and so forth. All this extra work, could have been avoided if you simply let the app stay in its “suspended” state. \nHowever … \nIn some instances (and they are rare but not impossibly rare), you want to kill apps that are misbehaving. Examples are (but not limited to): Apps that deal with background audio, or asynchronous services like location (where the app asks for a location and iOS must go and ask around where it is, for example, by firing the GPS if needed), video streaming, etc. \nI’ve had countless instances of apps like Lyft, United Airlines, even Twitter, that end up in a broken state (or simply don’t properly work), either because you’re in a bad network (iOS has gotten really bad at recovering from some bad networks in the past 3-4 releases) or the network simply doesn’t properly respond. \nIn time, most of these problems tend to go away and the app starts working again; but if you really need the app to work now, then you have to go ahead and pay the price of having to kill it and restart it from scratch. You used more battery by doing that, but, hey, you needed it. \nAnd if this was confusing, I can give you a car analogy, because that’s what we tend to do all the time.\nThe Car Analogy\nI know that car technology has advanced and this is no longer a good example, but play with me here.\nFiring a Car’s engine used to use more fuel than just idling. When cars had carburetors instead of injectors, this was even worse; that’s why turning your engine off when you stop at a red light, can theoretically use more fuel than just idling for a minute. Newer cars have a much more efficient mechanism and can stop the engine, but stay in a semi-started state (let’s not get too into cars here).\nYou closing apps, is the equivalent of a person turning the car off at every stop light. As opposed to just letting it idle until you need it again, normally a few seconds later. \nThe analogy is not perfect, for the truth is, idle cars still use fuel, whereas suspended apps don’t; however, In the eyes of the phone, they are not using anything memory/battery related (as long as they don’t have background processing of any sort active, obviously). \nYou’re basically turning your engine off every time you kill an app, and you’re not letting the iOS “smart” mechanism of idling your engine take care of it, so when the light turns green, you can simply press the accelerator and the engine is running faster than if it would have been 100% stopped. Starting an engine from a stopped state, also uses more power than just fuel, you need to turn the starter so the engine can be cranked, fuel injected and sparks created, so… it’s a lot of work behind the scenes. Apps are like engines. :)\n\nA: *\n\n*If you force-shutdown an app entirely, then when you need to re-open it at a later time, the overhead associated with launching a new instance of the app is more CPU and energy intensive than just switching from one app to another.\n\n*When an app is just sitting there in memory, unless it is actually built to  run in the background, it is usually paused or killed and does not consumed any CPU cycle (usually). If it's a fairly simple app, then it will be just sitting there using memory. In such case, the app state is persisted somewhere else (on device storage in the case of Android) so that the app state can be restored later. To give you an idea, a rather long unsent message that I wrote in the Viber app in my phone survived a phone shut down due to battery depletion. After restarting the phone, then Viber, I found the message waiting for me to send it. Halleluja.\n\n*Depending on your memory chip, whether it contains zeros or ones will not make any significant difference in the power consumption. So keeping stuff in memory of not won't significantly make you save battery.\n\n*When an app is in super deep sleep (guys, please confirm this), only a reference to it will be visible in the app switcher as a snapshot of the last screen that was visible from it before going under. I am saying this because one day, I have decided to close all the apps in my iPad, and I was surprised by the amount of apps I had to close. It was more than 60 apps. These cannot be all held in the memory of the iPad. I saw some apps in there, that were used several months ago.\n\n\nAs an analogy ... with you car, if you need to make too many stops during the day and keep stopping and starting the engine, a time will come when the battery will be totally depleted. This can happen if the charging time while you are driving between stops is not long enough to restore the tremendous amount of energy that is sucked out of the battery every time you start the engine. Besides, it's not good for the starter and the overall gas consumption. That's why many delivery truck drivers will keep the engine idling during their short stops.\nThis analogy is IMO similar to the memory saving myth.\n\nA: Clean cut version: \nIt is better because the OS was designed to make it better to the point that the user would want to keep apps on (or in a \"suspended\" state) in order to gather more information on your actions[*] later if needed.\nLonger version:\nApps that are \"suspended\"  will have their state saved in memory so once you want to start them back up the proces of loading everything back will require less time for the procesor and almost no use of the storage unit...With this you can't know if your apps are doing some other things in the background which in a lot of cases they sit there collecting data on you.\n\n[*] To elaborate on the collecting data on you part... apps that are stored in memory can be either \"suspended\" or active in the background. You as the owner of the device can't know (if you don't possess the knowledge of and some other apps to actively scan CPU usage) what said app is really doing. From the point of view of security I'd advise to shut any app that you aren't going to use for the next 10 mins off.\nP.S. This practice is done on Android devices as well btw ...\n\nA: Just throwing a differing opinion out there for the sake of discussion. This concept has a certain degree of truth to it, but once you have a certain number of apps open, you're likely going to start seeing diminishing returns on keeping apps suspended. \nThe more apps you have open, the more ram is going to be getting used up, obviously. Typically each app in memory gets divided up as memory the app itself is actually currently using, memory that the app wants to have on hand, and memory the operating system actually allowed the app to use, which gives you the final amount of memory the app is allowed to use. The reason the app keeps a separate portion of this memory as memory it wants to use, is because the app may need to grow it's heap, but it doesn't necessarily want to do that right off the bat because it's bad for garbage collectors to have large heaps (large heaps = longer garbage collections), so the app will set aside a portion of memory not currently being used, but that can be used by the app exclusively if need arises.\nSay the OS allows my app up to 700mb, and the app set's aside 300mb of that memory for itself, leaving 400mb out there for my app to use if it wants, but then another app opens and needs some memory; the OS looks at all the different apps, and decides if it's okay to pull some memory from another app and use it for the new app, in this case it may decide to take 150mb from my apps allowed memory and give it to the new app, requiring the memory to be swapped around to give the new app memory to use (think of this as a reallocation of funds in a business) well, the more apps you have open, the more work the operating system has to do to actually decide which app's memory it can siphon off to give the new app memory. \nIn this sense, every app that get's opened and the suspended adds complexity to this process, making it more CPU intensive, and eventually requiring potentially more battery power to open future apps than the battery power saved by not closing other apps.\nNow mind you, none of that takes into consideration that unless you truly kill an app, there can be background services running that will eat up processing power, for example notifications set to notify you on a timer, etc. On the flip side, some apps don't use a true background service, and actually use push notifications from services like firebase, which don't require the app to be open at any point.\nAnother thing to consider, the more apps you continually open, the more fragmented that memory will initially be until the OS goes through and cleans up the memory to be more clean and laid out more efficiently, this itself also chews up processing power, and the more memory that is occupied by apps, the more intensive this process will be for your device.\nAll of this to say, leaving apps open is mostly more efficient, unless too many apps are opened, however I am not sure how many apps need to be open to get to this threshold, if the number exists.\nSources:\nSGen garbage collector for Mono:\nhttp://www.mono-project.com/docs/advanced/garbage-collector/sgen/\nOverview of memory profiler for both iOS and Android Xamarin apps, which shows the way memory is managed by the app (working set, private bytes, memory allocated, etc.)\nhttps://blog.xamarin.com/say-hello-to-the-xamarin-profiler/\n", "Q: Output format of the standard Mac OS Color Picker dialog (choose color) It is possible to create an AppleScript that calls for the standard Mac OS Color Picker dialog (choose color) and gets the output value after user picks some color:\nset the rez to choose color\nset the rezStr to rez2string(rez)\nset the clipboard to rezStr\n\non rez2string({r, g, b})\n    return \"(\" & r & \", \" & g & \", \" & b & \")\" as string\nend rez2string\n\nSo, selected color value will be copied to the clipboard.\nMy question is: can I control the output of this Color Picker dialog in AppleScript? By default it returns the color value in this format: (59432, 59441, 59428), which is a 16-bit high color, I believe.\nCan I specify somehow that I want to get a \"standard\" RGB (with 255 as a maximum value) instead? Or any other? Or 16-bit high color is the only supported output format for choose color? That would be a pity, because as far as I know there is no way to get proper RGB/Hex values from 16-bit high color as it would involve rounding and approximation. \nI mean, the very same standard Color Picker dialog that is called by choose color has RGB values (along with the Hex one) on its second tab (Color Sliders), so it is capable of returning values in those formats. But are those available to get in AppleScript?\n\nUpdate 1.\nI wrote a blog-post with more details about the problem.\nUpdate 2.\nAs Jon pointed out in his answer, the problem originates in the eye-dropper, so scripts are actually able to convert from 16-bit high color into \"normal\" 255-RGB and then HEX, but due to the fact that eye-dropper outputs incorrect value (from different color space, apparently), all further calculations are doomed.\n\nA: First, this is the script I use:\nset format to (button returned of (display dialog \"Select the format of the chosen color for the clipboard.\" buttons {\"Cancel\", \"HEX\", \"RGB\"} default button 3 with icon 1 with title \"Color Picker\"))\nset {r, g, b} to choose color\nset {r, g, b} to {_16_to_8(r), _16_to_8(g), _16_to_8(b)}\nif (format = \"RGB\") then\n    set the clipboard to (\"rgb(\" & r & \", \" & g & \", \" & b & \")\")\nelse\n    set the clipboard to (\"#\" & {dec_to_hex(r), dec_to_hex(g), dec_to_hex(b)})\nend if\n\non _16_to_8(n)\n    return ((n / 65535) * 255) as integer\nend _16_to_8\n\nproperty hex_chars : \"0123456789ABCDEF\"'s characters\non dec_to_hex(n)\n    if (n = 0) then return \"00\"\n    return (hex_chars's item (((n div 16) mod 16) + 1)) & (hex_chars's item ((n mod 16) + 1))\nend dec_to_hex\n\nThe issue you are seeing is specific to the color you chose ({236, 236, 236} / ECECEC) using the eye-dropper tool. The picker showed it as {236, 236, 236} but when returned via AppleScript, it was {59438, 59436, 59437} or something close where the RGB values are not the same (i.e., not a true gray). If you open the color picker and manually enter 236 for each of the RGB values (do not use the eye-dropper tool) and then return the color, it will return the RGB result as 3 equal values ({60652, 60652, 60652}) that will then be coerced properly by the script above.\nI believe there is a rounding issue with the color picker and the eye-dropper tool as it shows, by default, 8-bit (0-255) integers instead of floating point (0.0-1.0). When you pickup the color from your example image using the eye-dropper tool and switch to the grayscale slider, it will show as 91%. This is incorrect. The value should be 92.5% but the picker doesn't show floats, only integers in the grayscale slider (you can change to floats in the RGB slider section from the action button to the right of the slider type popup button). If you are in the grayscale slider section, manually enter 92.5 and then hit the tab key to have the value accepted by the picker then hit the OK button and again, you should see the proper results back in AppleScript.\nSo, if the result from AppleScript is not what you are seeing in the picker, just copy the HEX value from the picker's HEX field and cancel the picker by hitting esc or the Cancel button. If you want the RGB colors, run the script again but instead of using the eye-dropper tool, paste the HEX value in the Hex field and press tab to commit the entry then hit return or OK and the proper RGB values should be on the clipboard. A pain, no doubt, but if precision is important to you, perhaps the way to go.\nOff topic but using the code above, you can also convert ASCII to HEX:\nstring_to_hex(\"Convert to hexadecimal!\")\n\nproperty hex_chars : \"0123456789ABCDEF\"'s characters\non dec_to_hex(n)\n    if (n = 0) then return \"00\"\n    return (hex_chars's item (((n div 16) mod 16) + 1)) & (hex_chars's item ((n mod 16) + 1))\nend dec_to_hex\n\non string_to_hex(s)\n    set r to {}\n    repeat with c in s's characters\n        set end of r to dec_to_hex(ASCII number c)\n    end repeat\n    return r as string\nend string_to_hex\n\nUPDATE\nHere's a revised script that will look to see if the user canceled the color picker with the HEX code copied to the clipboard. If both of those conditions are true, then the script will use the copied HEX code to add the RGB or HEX code to the clipboard. An extra few awkward steps (select and copy the HEX string, then cancel the color picker) but perhaps feasible for your needs.\ntry\n    set format to (button returned of (display dialog \"Select the format of the chosen color for the clipboard.\" buttons {\"Cancel\", \"HEX\", \"RGB\"} default button 3 with icon 1 with title \"Color Picker\"))\n    set {r, g, b} to choose color\n    set {r, g, b} to {_16_to_8(r), _16_to_8(g), _16_to_8(b)}\non error e number n\n    if (n = -128) then --user canceled\n        set clipboard_string to (get the clipboard)\n        if ((clipboard_string count) = 6) then\n            set {r, g, b} to hex_string_to_dec(clipboard_string)\n        else\n            return\n        end if\n    else\n        log {n:n, e:e}\n        return\n    end if\nend try\nif (format = \"RGB\") then\n    set the clipboard to (\"rgb(\" & r & \", \" & g & \", \" & b & \")\")\nelse\n    set the clipboard to (\"#\" & {dec_to_hex(r), dec_to_hex(g), dec_to_hex(b)})\nend if\n\non _16_to_8(n)\n    return ((n / 65535) * 255) as integer\nend _16_to_8\n\nproperty hex_chars : \"0123456789ABCDEF\"'s characters\non dec_to_hex(n)\n    if (n = 0) then return \"00\"\n    return (hex_chars's item (((n div 16) mod 16) + 1)) & (hex_chars's item ((n mod 16) + 1))\nend dec_to_hex\n\nproperty hex_to_dec_chars : \"0.1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9AaBbCcDdEeFf\"\non hex_to_dec(s)\n    set s to s's items's reverse\n    set {d, p} to {0, 0}\n    repeat with c in s\n        set d to d + (((offset of c in hex_to_dec_chars) div 2) * (16 ^ p))\n        set p to p + 1\n    end repeat\n    return d as integer\nend hex_to_dec\n\non hex_string_to_dec(s)\n    if character 1 of s = \"#\" then set s to s's text 2 thru -1\n    set r to {}\n    repeat with x from 1 to length of s by 2\n        set end of r to hex_to_dec(s's text x thru (x + 1))\n    end repeat\n    return r\nend hex_string_to_dec\n\n\nA: I could not find the method to change the output of the ColorPicker, but you can convert the output by yourself with:\nset the rez to choose color\nset the rezStr to rez2string(rez)\nset the clipboard to rezStr\n\non rez2string({r, g, b})\n    return \"(\" & to8bit(r) & \", \" & to8bit(g) & \", \" & to8bit(b) & \")\" as string\nend rez2string\n\non to8bit(x)\n    return (round (x / 256) rounding down) as integer\nend to8bit\n\nIt uses rounding, so small values can be a little off.\n\nA: Since the AppleScript answer wasn't possible to achieve, I have an alternative.\nIf you want a stand-alone version of the native color picker that features easy access to copying color codes, I would recommend installing Hues 1.0: zachwaugh/hues: Hues color picker for Mac\nI'v been using it for years and despite having bought all the others on the market, I keep coming back to Hues (and Sip).

This tends to be in the Utilities folder of the Applications list. You should have a DVD of Windows 7 to get going with this since that Mac doesn't technically support Windows 8+. You'll want to start with 7 if possible since that way you'll get Apple's software support on the Windows installation. After that, you may be able to upgrade to Windows 8.1 or 10 but I've never personally tried it.\nNormally installation of Windows is not a big deal, but without a proper \"Apple Supported\" GPU you might run into problems where the machine attempts to reboot into Windows and either goes back to the Mac or gets stuck at a black screen. In general, try to keep the Windows 7 disc in the drive and give the Mac some time to boot into Windows before powering off; for some reason, it takes maybe 20 seconds or more for the Mac to boot into non-OSX and you can get anxious that nothing is happening. If you're adventerous, there are some guides on the internet which should be able to guide you through a disc-less installation process that leverages VirtualBox.\nOnce you've got Windows installed, telling the Mac to boot by default into Windows is trivial: go to the System Preferences, Startup Disk and select that you want the BOOTCAMP partition to be the boot disk.\nGoing back to OSX without an Apple GPU can be done one of two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have the Apple Boot Camp software for Windows installed. There is a tray icon which has a selector to allow you to boot back into OSX.\n\n*During the Mac's startup sound, hold down Command-PR (the P and R keys simultaneously). Wait for the startup sound to happen a second time. This zaps the PRAM which will cause the Mac to boot the first OSX partition it finds.\n\n\n*\n\n*both of these methods will probably require you to do the \"Startup Drive\" -> \"BOOTCAMP\" thing again in preferences.\n\n\n\nGot it working? Great! Now the one downside of all this: your GPU will always run at PCIe 1.1 speeds unless you do something to the card. With some specific models, there are people on the internet who have figured out how to physically modify the card to run at 2.0 speeds (The MacPro3,1 is PCIe 2.0 for the 16x slots). I think this may involve cutting a resistor or something; you're on your own here. The other way is that you (ta da!) flash the card with an Apple EFI.\nAll said and done, you can make your Mac boot into Windows by default and have a Windows machine in a Mac Pro. However, if you can find an Apple EFI for your GPU, I would strongly suggest doing it since it'll just make life easier.\n", "Q: Reinstall Apache? I have completely borked my Apache installation on High Sierra.\nI had a wonderful local development environment running prior to the update, and when I upgraded to High Sierra I attempted to force it to use PHP5 instead of PHP7 and in the course of doing so (and then trying to undo what I'd done) I made everything worse.\nRegardless of what I do with apachectl commands, I just get:\nAH00534: httpd: Configuration error: No MPM loaded.\nI have Googled that many, many times and am only finding Linux / Unix sites with information that does not apply.\nNo, I can't find any useful information by looking at the results of tail logs.\nNo, I do not have / cannot use any of the ~previous or backup or \"original\" versions of httpd.conf or associated files (extras/httpd-vhosts.conf, etc.) because I have managed to corrupt them as well.\nI also may have installed a second copy of Apache somewhere via Homebrew which is interfering with and / or causing the de facto High Sierra version to act wonky.\nIs there any way -- without completely reinstalling the OS -- to reinstall just Apache and get things back to a stable state?\n\nA: Okay.

After updating to macOS 10.13.1, my Login Items have vanished. Some users have reported this behavior in earlier betas, but this is the first time I've experienced it in a release.\nIs there a reason for this behavior. Is there a way to identify what items I had configured  so I can restore them?\n\nA: I have lost all my login items too after upgrade to macOS 10.13.1.\nYou could take a look the plist file at ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist, it may still contain names of login items, then add them back manually. I recovered mine in this way.\nI guess 10.13 has moved login items config to somewhere else but failed to migrate old ones.\n", "Q: Upgrade to High Sierra failed and I cannot restore backups from macOS Server I tried to upgrade a MacBook Air from macOS Sierra to macOS High Sierra. It rebooted and entered a black screen while the machine got very hot for about 30 minutes. I ended up turning off the machine and my drive was no longer bootable.\nBefore I did this, I made sure I had two backups on our macOS Sierra Server, configured with the Time Machine Server. We have a two Drobos attached to the server and our Macs backup to each Drobo in round-robin fashion.\nI also did a \"Backup with Consistency Check\" on each of the two drives and I did a \"Verify Backups\" and all was fine.\nSince I could not longer boot the MacBook Air and I was sure I had two good backups, I wiped the Mac and installed macOS High Sierra from the recovery partition. It installed fine.\nHowever, at the point where it asks if I wanted to transfer from a backup, I chose that option but macOS won't find the backups. I waited 8 hours, and still it didn't find them. \nSo, I chose \"Other Location\" and I specified the server and SMB share name, and it added it but then said the share was unavailable. I don't have the exact error messages with me, and I'll update my question later with the exact errors and possibly screenshots. \nI completed the macOS High Sierra installed, mounted and authenticated to the Time Machine server, and accessed the Time Machine backup sparsebundle. Then I launched the Migration Assistant. Again, it did not find the backups. Plus, if I add them, I get the same error (I will provide later).\nHow can I restore my MacBook Air from a Time Machine server backup? \n\nA: I ended up calling Apple support and they apparently don't know to restore a Time Machine backup from a Time Machine server either. So I took matters into my own hand:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copied sparesebundle from TM server to USB drive.\n\n*Attached USB drive directly to MacBook Air.\n\n*Mounted sparsebundle and started Migration Assistant.\n\n*Restore the data.\n\n\nAt first I tried to restore without mounting the sparsebundle and wile the computer name from the backup file will show, no backups show. You must mount the sparsebundle.\n\nA: You may need your Macbook to \"inherit\" the older backups if TM believes this is now a different machine, e.g. if its drive-name got changed during the broken HS install attempt or for whatever other reason. A terminal command, tmutil, can do a bunch of magic on TM volumes (or, as the Sorcerer's Apprentice found out, a bunch of shenanigans as well!

Only guessing (since I don't have the unit in front of me to test), I would say that it's the 12V power rail that supplies the display that's the source of the problem.\nTo further diagnose the problem, hook it up to an external monitor.  If the problem doesn't manifest on the monitor, the issue has to do with the display and not the GPU.  \nYou will need to take this in for service.  If you have Apple Care, this should be covered.

How can any user extract a backup file from a usb-connected iphone?\n\nA: The apps usually just initiate a backup themselves first, having their own implementation of the iOS backup protocol (or using libimobiledevice libraries). So, they're not really directly accessing the iOS filesystem via USB, they're making a backup in their own app data folder, and then accessing that.

The googling that I have done suggests that you copy individual pages onto your desktop, and then combine them all using Preview, but doing this with 136 pages seems like a terrible idea.  \nThe alternate method I have seen is to \"Print to PDF\" but print selected page ranges.

Thanks :)\n\nA: It's not clear to me what commands you actually entered into the Terminal, but based on the output, it looks like they were not entered correctly.\nbrew install upx\nThis is one command.  It instructs brew to install the command-line program upx.  It needs to be entered on its own line, after which you press enter.\nupx -d \"/Applications/Ableton Live 9 Suite.app/Contents/MacOS/Ableton Live 9 Suite\"\nThis is the second command.  It tells the program upx to do something to the file at the path specified, with the -d option switch.  It assumes your Ableton installation exists on that exact path /Applications/Ableton Live 9 Suite.app/Contents/MacOS/Ableton Live 9 Suite with that exact name.  I'm not familiar with upx, so I assume that you're using the correct syntax for that program's execution.\nThe $ in the command you copied are shell prompts, and not part of the actual commands.\n\nA: Based on what I could understand you managed to install homebrew properly based on the error output. Your problem seems to be what you entered into the terminal as commands.\nThe symbol in terminal commands $ is to refer to the start of a command and is not to be copied and used in the command.\nExample: $ brew install upx\nshould be entered: brew install upx\nWhat happened here is brew tried searching and installing a packaged called $ after it looked for upx and since it never found the package by the name $ , as it doesn't exist, it never installed anything.\nI'm not able to go through the package upx manual pages to figure out if your upx commands are correct, but if they are, what you need to do is the following to install upx via the brew command. Type or copy and paste each command and hit enter.\nbrew install upx\nThen enter this second command...\nupx -d \"/Applications/Ableton Live 9 Suite.app/Contents/MacOS/Ableton Live 9 Suite\"\n\nAnd all in one copy and paste if this confuses anyone (a ; means the start of a new, seperate command):\nbrew install upx; upx -d \"/Applications/Ableton Live 9 Suite.app/Contents/MacOS/Ableton Live 9 Suite\"\n\nAlso note: commands via the terminal are not code. They are individual commands that you type to be carried out on by one. The command exit exits the shell and won't let you input more commands without starting a new Terminal.app window/tab.

To what extent, if any, is Animoji dependent on the camera and sensor system specific to iPhone X? Would there be a noticeable quality difference if the Animoji software was available on other iPhones?\n\nA: My understanding is that Animoji requires ARKit. Since the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus rear camera supports this, it could be possible in theory to use these cameras to create Animoji. However, using a rear camera would be problematic at best, since you wouldn't be able to see yourself as you're creating the Animoji. And since ARKit is not supported on any front facing camera except for the one on the iPhone X, it is further problematic using the software on any other current model of iPhone.\nIt's also possible that since Face ID itself is not required while you're creating the Animoji, that the process may still use the map of your face initially created by Face ID when it's set up (this is pure speculation on my behalf). If that is the case, then creating Animoji on an iPhone 8 / 8 Plus would not be possible - at least not to the quality we see on the iPhone X.\n\nA: Animoji uses the FaceID hardware to look for features, motion, and keep everything properly mapped onto your face.\nThere's no reason it has to be that way, and it's perfectly possible to do similar things purely in software - as any number of chat apps demonstrate.\nI suspect using the hardware does indeed improve the mapping, but to what degree is anyone's guess.\n", "Q: Is there a plugin to create a folder and a file in it at the same time it terminal?

Is there a way?\nIn Settings, I can't find such an option and it won't show the percentage there too. Can it be done besides using 3rd party app such as System Status Lite?\n\nA: Currently, as of iOS 11.1, there's no way of showing the battery percentage by default.\nOne way to see the battery percentage is to pull-down slightly on the right 'wing' (with the battery icon).  Once the screen changes to the Control Center, you'll be able to see the battery percentage.\n\nAnother way to find this out is to just ask Siri.  You can say \"What's my battery life\" and the response will include the percentage of power remaining.  \nThe remaining way is to charge your iPhone.  When you charge it, the battery percentage is briefly displayed on the lock screen.\n", "Q: Firefox on macOS: Use native fullscreen on videos Is there a way to make Firefox use Mac's native fullscreen when watching a video (e.g. on Netflix)? The browser does go fullscreen, but it's not on it's own space on macOS.\nI'm currently using Firefox 57 and macOS 10.13.1.\n\nA: Unfortunately, that's not currently implemented in Firefox (see Bug 1403085).\nAs a workaround, consider putting Firefox itself into fullscreen mode by clicking the green button in the title bar before making a video fullscreen.\n\nA: This is now supported in modern builds of Firefox (appears to be implemented since version 70). However, it is not enabled by default. Go into about:config and set full-screen-api.macos-native-full-screen to true.\n\nA: Usually video players will have a full screen option you can toggle on/off.\nUsing your example of Netflix, you'll see this option at bottom right when you hover your mouse over the bottom of the video. \n\nIn the screenshot above, the icon at bottom left (immediately below the time remaining) is the full screen icon. Clicking on this will display the video in full screen.\nTo use a non-Netflix example, the screenshot below is taken of a YouTube video:\n\nLikewise, at bottom left there is an icon for viewing the video in Full Screen mode. When you click on this icon, you'll see a prompt appear at top like the one below:\n\nA similar prompt appears whether it's YouTube, Netflix, etc when playing videos in full screen mode.\nFinally, to exit Full Screen mode you can just click the icon in the same location at bottom right (or just press the esc key).\nThis behaviour (i.e. icons, prompts, esc key) is independent of the browser.

I'm running Sierra 10.12.6 on a 2015 MacBook Pro and I was wondering if anyone knew a way to trick the OS into thinking the battery is connected when it's actually unplugged. \nI'm sure you guys will want to know why in the first place...I keep my mac plugged for long periods of time and it's messed up my battery capacity ( down to 70% in just 300+ cycles).\n\nA: Your question assumes that something is wrong on the basis of your battery health only being at 70%. It's not clear how you're getting this figure, but a battery health of 70% after 300 cycles sounds perfectly reasonable to me if what you're measuring is the number of cycles remaining. Otherwise Battery Health is not usually represented by a percentage value, but in terms of Normal, Replace Soon, Replace Now, and Service Battery.  \nWhile it used to be in years gone by that Apple recommended allowing your battery to drain somewhat on a regular basis, this is no longer the case. In other words, keeping your MacBook Pro plugged into an AC power source for prolonged periods will not mess up your battery.\nYou may want to refer to what Apple has to say about their batteries for more information. \nIn summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple lithium-ion batteries use fast charging to reach 80% of their capacity and then switch to slower trickle charging to complete the charge.\n\n*Charge your MacBook Pro whenever you want. Many people believe you need to let them discharge 100% before recharging. This is not true.\n\n*Ambient temperature is one of the biggest factors in battery health/life. MacBooks are designed to work at their best when ambient temperatures are between 16° to 22° C (62° to 72° F).\n\n*It’s important to avoid exposing your MacBook to ambient temperatures higher than 35° C (95° F)\n\n*If you're ever going to store your MacBook for long-term without usage, it is best to store it totally powered down and at only about half charge.\n\n\nAlso, some of the latest research suggests that one of the most important determinants of what ruins a battery is time, and that's not something you can do anything about.\nFinally, there is no way of safely tricking your Mac into thinking that your battery is connected when it's not. It will cause other issues for your MacBook and, in the event of a power failure, you have no built in uninterruptible power supply.\n\nA: \nI keep my Mac plugged for long periods of time and it's messed up my\n  battery capacity ( down to 70% in just 300+ cycles)\n\nIt doesn't work this way anymore.  In this answer, I describe the two factors of what contributes to battery life:  time and cycles.\nIt is entirely possible to get a battery with diminished capacity with relatively few cycles on it - it's older than your machine.  You are proceeding under the assumption that the battery wasn't older, unused stock and/or the battery itself wasn't defective from beginning.  The bottom line is...it happens - you get faulty components.\nLeaving your Mac plugged in won't affect your battery because a cycle is one full discharge and recharge.  So, if it only discharges 5 percent then recharges, it will have to do this 20 times to count as a cycle.\n\nI was wondering if anyone knew a way to trick the OS into thinking the\n  battery is connected when it's actually unplugged\n\nCould you?  Sure, but you have several power rails you will need to supply voltage to in order to trick the SMC and charging circuits into believing a battery's connected.  This happens at the hardware layer long before firmware and especially the OS comes into play, so the hack will involve a fair bit of electronic engineering know-how.\n\nIt's by far cheaper, safer and more productive to get the battery changed out and be done with it.\n", "Q: Why is memory management in macOS more efficient than in Linux? I have been a Linux user for four years. Recently, I have been using macOS and I see it has very efficient memory management compared to Linux.\nFor example, here is a description of the documents/apps I have open on a Mac Mini i5 1.4 GHz 8GB RAM 500 GB HDD @ 5400 RPM:\n\n\n*\n\n*40 pdfs \n\n*Blender\n\n*PowerPoint \n\n*Photos\n\n*iTunes\n\n*12 Safari tabs\n\n*QuickTime video\n\n*Terminal\n\n*Maps\n\n*Sublime Text\n\n*Calendar\n\n\nWith these open the Mac showed 5.91 GB of RAM used. \nMy question is: What's different about the Mac that on Linux I can't even open half the apps with a machine with the same amount of memory and HD?\n\nA: Most of the efficiency comes from large blocks of read-only memory being shared between applications. Most graphical Mac applications use common frameworks. Where possible macOS only loads one instance of a framework into memory.\nFor more about macOS memory management and organisation see:\n\n\n*\n\n*How does memory management work in Mac OS X?\n\n*What's the difference between Real, Virtual, Shared, and Private Memory?\n", "Q: Keyboard backlight is on by default after High Sierra update Before the High Sierra update, when I used to boot my Macbook Air, the keyboard backlight was always off by default.

So if you execute the command shown below, the output will contain many printed lines. Most of these lines will show a path through a Data/Desktop symbolic link. Note, the -L option causes the find command to follow symbolic links.\nfind  -L  ~  -name  sample.txt  -print\n\nIf you execute the command given below, the same output will be produced, minus the lines showing a path through a Data/Desktop symbolic link.\nfind  ~  -name  sample.txt  -print\n\nThe output from the above command should contain at least the following line.\n/Users/YourUsername/Desktop/Dev/sample.txt\n\nA symbolic link is just a file containing a character string. Each directory entry for such files contains a flag indicating the file is a symbolic link. The character string stored in a symbolic link file can be printed by executing the readlink command. For example, you could enter the following command, on your computer.\nreadlink  ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.CloudPhotosConfiguration/Data/Desktop\n\nThis would produce the following output.\n../../../../Desktop\n\nSo when symbolic links are being followered and the file name\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.CloudPhotosConfiguration/Data/Desktop/Dev/sample.txt\n\nis encountered, the Desktop string gets replaced by the string ../../../../Desktop to produce\n~/Library/Containers/com.apple.CloudPhotosConfiguration/Data/../../../../Desktop/Dev/sample.txt\n\nwhich is equivalent to the\n~/Desktop/Dev/sample.txt\n\nfile name.\n", "Q: How can I get telnet on my macbook pro with High Sierra Telnet is not available on High Sierra.

I have to mention that it worked great on Sierra.\nI've checked the settings and I have \"open with same profile\" and \"open in same working directory\" checked. Also I've entered Recovery Mode and set the csrutil enable --without debug which Total Terminal needs starting from El Capitan.\nThe Total Terminal web page says it's not currently under development and High Sierra is not listed under Compatibility.\nIf anyone managed to find a fix around this, it'll be highly appreciated. If not, I'm thinking about switching to iTerm2. Apparently the developer of Total Terminal recommends doing so too.\n\nA: It's time to move over to iTerm2.  It's highly unlikely a fix will be found in the wild because it doesn't make sense to do so.\nIt's no longer under active development.  From the About page on their website\n\nSIP must be disabled to use.  (IMO), disabling SIP to get a non-critical app to function is not a wise path to pursue.  SIP adds a layer of protection to your system that isn't worth disabling for a terminal app.  From their web page specifically on SIP\n\nSystem Integrity Protection (SIP) is a new security feature introduced\n  by Apple. That's good, but unfortunately it prevents TotalTerminal\n  from augmenting Terminal. This article will tell you how to configure\n  your machine, so that you can use TotalTerminal.

Frankly, I'm going to stop\n  TotalTerminal development because I have personally switched to iTerm\n  2. It offers similar functionality to Visor and comparable features to build-in Terminal.app.\n\nTL;DR\nTotal Terminal requires you to disable  security.

I dot not have any sim from the USA and I am not planning to have one for using the iPhone X ever in the US. \nIs this important to activate the iPhone? \n\nA: The reason for this is that in the US carriers have and use slightly different technologies and different frequencies than their competitors. Though I believe T-Mobile and AT&T use similar technology and frequencies. Not sure abut the other two.\nI would suggest checking the website of the carrier you use at home and see what they use so you can select a phone that is the most compatible with their cellular network.\n\nA: Currently Apple only allows the sale of the iPhone X directly from their website to come with carrier locked versions.

Is there any way to fix this?\nOr, would going to the Apple Centre be an option, as it takes me a long time to get there since I work on a tanker ship. \n\nA: First, recovering your files may be impossible. You should immediately stop using the disk. The data may still be there, but marked as free for storing other files, so the longer you use the disk, the more likely it is that something will get overwritten by chance. There are services you can buy that will try to recover what's on your disk.\nOnce you get that sorted out, regarding the boot problem:\nAccording to this Apple Support article, it means the computer couldn't find a valid system folder to boot from.

Solutions offered there did not work for me.  I have an older MacBook Pro, Mid 2009, El Capitan 10.11.6. My problem is that I can only access the internet in safe mode. This occurred last week. \nIt is possible that it occurred as a result of  my installation of Apple Security Update 2017-4. My MBP is the only device in the house affected by this. iPads and another MBP are working fine.

Keith\n\nA: In a sense you have two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Option 1 - Cut your losses and do a fresh installation of macOS, followed by restoring your data from your Time Machine (or other) backups1\n\n*Option 2 -Continue troubleshooting your current installation\n\n\nThe first option will almost certainly resolve the issue, the second option may eventually resolve the issue.\nKeep in mind that if you continue troubleshooting, that this is a process of elimination and often requires patience. \nI assume you already know how to freshly install macOS and restore your data from a backup, so for now I'll focus on how I would troubleshoot this further.\nSince the problem is not present during Safe Mode then it's time to investigate login items, fonts, and kernel extensions. \nInvestigating login items, fonts, and kernel extensions\nLet's start with Login Items:\n\n\n*\n\n*Startup normally\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Users & Groups\n\n*Select the Login Items tab\n\n*Take a note of your Login Items \n\n*Now remove all of them by highlighting them and clicking on the - button below\n\n*Restart your computer\n\n\nNow your Mac will boot up without those login items loading. Test to see if you can connect to the Internet:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you can, you know one (or more) of the Login items were causing the problem. You can then add them back in one by one until you've identified the culprit. Problem solved.\n\n*If the problem does persist, it's either a problem with fonts you've installed yourself or with a 3rd party kernel extension. A little more info below:\n\n\nFonts:- You can remove any of the fonts you've installed yourself to see if this makes a difference.\nKernel Extensions:- You can open Terminal (found within your Utilites folder) and enter the following command:\nkextstat | grep -v com.apple\nThe above command will list 3rd party kernel extensions (you may need to stretch the Terminal window so it's easier to read). Look for anything you don't remember installing, or something that belongs to software you've removed, or just anything that looks out of place. Remember though, this is a list of 3rd party kernel extensions and therefore any of them could be causing the problem.\nIf you still can't connect once you've gone through the above process, I would suggest that continuing to troubleshoot this will cause more frustration and take more time than just cutting your losses and doing a fresh installation of macOS.\n1 I assume you have a backup regime in place. If not, start using Time Machine or some other backup software now!\n\nA: Thanks a lot!\nI tried all things to resolve the issue and your option-2 works for me!\nEverybody has to remember that Paragon or Little Snitch software might impact on your wifi connection.\nI deleted it and everything works fine!\nThank you\n", "Q: Unable to encrypt removable hard drive I have removable hard drive which I can't encrypt.\nI'm following official guide, but there is simply no encryption option in the erase menu:\n\nThere should also be an option called \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)\", but it is not in the list.\nTo be more specific I'm running the latest update of OS X High Sierra (10.13.1).

I tried all of these search terms, but none worked:\nChinese\nChinese*\nChinese (Traditional)\nChinese (Simplified) \nTraditional\n*Traditional*\nSimplified\n*Simplified*\n\nIt seems to me a major oversight/bug that Font Book's Smart Collection filter cannot search for a term that has spaces in it. (Or is there a way to \"escape\" a space?)\nSide note: In Yosemite, some of the Chinese fonts' Language properties have \"Chinese, Chinese (Simplified)\", so those will show up if you do a Smart Collection for \"Chinese\", but not \"Chinese (Simplified)\".

Still works.\n——-\nYes. This works with Sierra:\nFind the utility Keychain Access ( Applications > Utilities) and launch it. If the lock icon at the upper left of the window is locked, unlock it.\nEnter \"appleid\" (no quotes) in the search box at the upper right.\nFind \"appleid\" in the resulting list, and double-click it.\nA small window will appear, with tabbed choices for \"Attributes\" or \"Access Control.\" Make sure \"Attributes\" is selected.

But there're other ways out if you simply just wanted to regain access to your Apple ID.\nAbout \"Saved Passwords\" thingy\nIf you actually saved your Apple ID password into your iCloud Keychain (most likely pressed \"Remember\" when Safari prompted you to save password after successful login) — then yes, like any other saved password in iCloud Keychain, your Apple ID password can be revealed through Keychain Access or Passwords preference pane (after macOS Monterey). And the associated site should be idmsa.apple.com, www.icloud.com, etc.\nAnd because you saved your Apple ID password inside iCloud Keychain, just like passwords for any other sites, this will work no matter what macOS version you're rocking, you can even reveal your password on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, as they're iCloud-enabled.\nBut what if you didn't save your Apple ID password in iCloud Keychain? Then sorry, you're out of luck.\nResetting password through Trusted Devices\nYou can reset your Apple ID password through a trusted device signed in with your Apple ID. More details on Apple Support. But no, you still cannot reveal your current password.\nYour Mac doesn't store your Apple ID password\nUnless you saved your Apple ID password into iCloud Keychain, your Mac wouldn't store your Apple ID password in plain text, instead, it saves credentials and access tokens for a variety of services.\nIn modern information security architecture, saving password in the form of plain text is considered as a security hazard. In case of data breach, passwords will be leaked directly to attackers. Instead, your password will act as an \"original representation\", that would be transformed into different representations and forms for different services. So passwords only exist in your mind, not anywhere else.\nUnless you saved your password in iCloud Keychain, there'll be no way to reveal your Apple ID password, otherwise it would be a vulnerability. The whole Apple system (so do Google systems, and any other modern technology company) is designed to not save password in plain text. And in case you forgot it, you can always reset it, but not reveal it.\n\nA: I just tried 'idmsa.apple.com' as suggested by Adam as the key on my Keychain on my newly upgraded MacBook Pro 12.2.1 Catalina, and my password is there  (once you give keychain your local credentials).\nThe upgrade did a reboot and the splash screen wanted AppleID info and did not take the password I remembered (felt odd).

(without re-downloading from internet) (also resume app downloads) Apple has recently removed the functionality from Windows iTunes to backup apps locally. The only way they offer now is via internet - iCloud. I often have limited internet access so that option is not suitable. Also I feel much better when I can easily and reliably restore the iPad to when everything was functioning perfectly. For example, update an app to find out there's a bug or some new functionality that makes things worse in some way. With a local backup it would be easy to go back and forth between the versions, and you don't have to depend on anything. \nThe solution would most likely involve jail breaking and that's fine, but I couldn't find actual information on whether it is in fact possible on a jailboken iPad and if so how. Bunch of sites recommend third party software and when you go on their respective sites they say things like \"manage apps, backup app data, images etc\" iTunes already does all of this.\nThanks!\n\nA: This article from OSXDaily Get iTunes 12.6.3 with App Store for Mac and Windows suggests to download the special 12.6.3 version, which restores the previous lost functionality.\nDo not know if works without internet in your case.\nAlso, the newest version 12.7, when connecting the first time a device, asks if you like to restore the old feature - this was the behaviour in my case.\nDirect link to this version of iTunes download page: https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208079\n\nA: You mention backing up apps - actually, it’s not about the iTunes version but about the iOS version: since iOS 9, apps cannot be extracted anymore, and iTunes won’t back them up (it will back up app data though, as part of the standard iOS backup). If you’re interested in the subject, here’s a details post on our blog. \nThen there’s app download: iTunes dropped that in iTunes 12.7.\nWhen iTunes did this, we at iMazing figured we could try to jump in and restore that functionality for our users. Turned out well - iMazing is now able to download your apps straight from the App Store, no hacks, legit downloads. And it keeps every version you download so you can downgrade if needed. \nThese new app management features are 100% available in the free version. Here is how it looks in the app:  \nI won’t post a link here, but you’ll find us easily I’m sure!\nDisclosure in case it isn’t clear enough: I work with the iMazing team.\n\nA: Thanks Yoan for finding a solution! This is sort of part II to the solution and more details:\nTo recap: There's no proper resume functionality on iPad when downloading apps, and with limited internet (speed and/or bandwidth) downloading a 900MB out of a 1GB file and then having it display a message that it failed... well that just sucks. So with this version of iTunes on the PC, the resume works. You can pause it, and even reboot your computer and it'll still work. Plus there is checkbox to disable simultaneous download (there is none on iPad), which is super useful, because you can have 2 files fail at 50% without it, Vs one complete file with it on. Why would anyone want to download apps simultaneously anyway.\nDetails: \nOne thing you might experience with this version is, sometimes after restart of iTunes the files vanish from the download queue icon on the top right. \nThe files are downloaded into a temporary folder. The default location is:\nC:\\Users__your_pc_name__\\Music\\iTunes\\iTunes Media\\Downloads\nThe Folders inside are named after the app being downloaded, for example: BeatMaker 3.tmp\nDon't worry about its size as it doesn't reflect how much you've downloaded. It will be the final size of the completed file. The key thing here is to see that it's there. If the folder is not there, you can't resume (but this hasn't happened to me so far). If the folder is there, it means that you can still resume your file but need to \"nudge\" the iTunes a little bit. The way I found to do this is as follows:\nGo to the App Store and search for some free app, click on get. As soon as the file queues into the download the list of other apps you were downloading will show up there as well. And whatever was partially done will continue resuming from where it left off. Of course you can then delete that \"nudging\" app. I found this very small app which is about a mb in size that I keep downloading over and over :)  To delete apps from the queue highlight them and press delete button. Sometimes it deletes but after you restart iTunes suddenly shows up there. (Yeah Apple hates us PC users) So to remedy this, go back to that folder above and delete that .tmp Folder\n(A) When an app download completes the *.ipa files will go here:\n\nC:\\Users__your_PC_name__\\Music\\iTunes\\iTunes Media\\Mobile Applications\n\n(B) The list of local apps inside iTunes from which you click install/remove is maintained by this file:\n\nC:\\Users_your_PC_\\Music\\iTunes\\iTunes Library.itl\n\n(C) What to do if you've reinstalled windows or want to install a different version of an app than the one in the list, and which one is in the list anyway?\nSimply copying files into the folder in (A) above, will do nothing. The list will be blank. Likewise the list will contain the version of the app you've downloaded on iTunes last. One way I found is to erase the list entirely and repopulate it. To do this delete \"iTunes Library.itl\" file in (B) above.\nNow, goes without saying you should back that folder up before doing this. (deleting/copying it back seems to restore functionality)\nIt's fairly easy to populate the list once it's empty, fortunately:\nStart iTunes with iPad hooked up and go to the App list window. You see on the right side your Home Screens, but on the left side there are no apps in the list. Fire up the File manager and go to the folder in (A) above. Put the *.ipa files there first. Now simply double click on them or press enter, and they'll show up in the iTunes list. In fact you can highlight SEVERAL apps and hit enter to import them at once! Once they get inside the list, they come in with the \"status intact\". That is if the app is installed the button will say [remove], if an older version is installed it'll say [update] etc.\n", "Q: MacOS High Sierra 10.13 supplemental update not installing Since installing macOS 10.13.1 on a MacBook Pro (2.9GHz Intel Core i5) Adobe InDesign (CS3) has stopped working.

Is there a way that I can add two audio inputs, where one is the built-in internal mic, and another is a wired earphone mic plugged into the headphone port?  When I plug in the earphone/mic, I lose access to the internal mic.\nI found some tutorials introducing \"Aggregate Device\", but I can't make it work with those two mic's.\n\nA: You will need to use an external device one way or another if you want to either the internal mic or your headphone mic. Though, for decent recording I don't recommend either as they are (barely) designed for the most basic recording tasks.\nThe problem lies with the headphone jack.  There's a physical switch inside the port itself that disconnects the internal mic so, if you choose to use that port, the internal mic will get disabled.\nIf you want to aggregate two mics, here are some solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get two USB mics.  Any decent quality USB microphone will do.  You can then aggregate both into a single input.\n\n*Use a USB DAC. This is like a USB sound card for your laptop with both input and output.  You can use a mic with with a phono plug to a 2.5mm plug with the right RCA adapter which are very inexpensive.\n\n*Use a dedicated USB mixer. Personally, I wouldn't use anything \"built-in\" and instead opt for a mixer that allowed me to fine tune the gain on individual microphones.  \n\n\nI personally use the second option mostly as a USB DAC for connecting my Bose Wave radio to my iMac for quality sound, though I do use it on occasion when I want high quality recordings (either via microphone or line input)\n", "Q: OSX High Sierra - Files and Folders show as empty/invisible in Finder, but are still there I am running the latest version of High Sierra.\nBoth my user Library/Application Support and main Library/Application Support are completely empty when opened in Finder (see screenshot).\nI was asked to delete a configuration file for an app I use which was misbehaving (a security-related app–a VPN app), and discovered that I cannot view files in these directories.  \nYet, when I reinstalled the app, its configuration was still in place, meaning most likely that those folders DO still have their contents (which I have seen before) but they are being hidden from me.\nAlso I might add two things: \n1) When this started happening two days ago, not only was that one folder empty in Finder (but not in Terminal), but since then, NO new files/folders created show up in Finder, and \n2) If I kill Finder, and restart it, some of the new files show up.

I currently own a 2017 MacBook Pro (13\", four Thunderbolt 3 ports) and a Dell P2415Q. I'm strongly considering purchasing two more Dell P2415Qs so that I can have a triple-monitor setup, but I only have one free USB Type-C port when docked right now. I also know that the Dell P2415Q's daisy-chaining capability isn't supported by OS X.\nIs there a device I can purchase that will allow me to provide full charging power to my 13\" MacBook Pro and allow me to plug three Dell P2415Qs into it (at 4K@60hz), all going into the MacBook via a single Thunderbolt 3 / USB Type-C cable? (If not, can it be done with only 2 TB3/USBC cables?)\nMy specs are:\n\n\n*\n\n*13-inch, 2017 MacBook Pro with four Thunderbolt 3 Ports\n\n*3.5GHz Intel Core i7 CPU\n\n*16GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3 RAM\n\n*Intel Iris Plus Graphics 650 1536 MB \n\n\nA: Official Apple specs\nOfficially your MBP supports two external displays at up to a maximum resolution of 4,096 x 2,304 pixels at 60 Hz at millions of colours or a single external display at a maximum resolution of up to 5,120 x 2,880 at 60 Hz at over a billion colours.\nSo, running the two external displays along with your built-in display is officially supported.\nUnofficial real-life scenarios\nHowever, unofficially you can exceed this. More specifically I've seen a user connect three external displays while in clamshell mode. However, this did seem to result in the MBP's fans spinning at a higher rate when they were watching videos, playing games, etc. Not something I would really recommend.\nYour setup\nSo, I wouldn't recommend three external displays. But, as for your setup, you say that you only have one free USB Type-C port. So for you to do what you want may require you using your ports differently so that you have at least two displays connected directly, and another different display connected via an adapter and your other devices connected via a dock or hub.\n\nA: No. Thunderbolt 3 doesn’t chain video, just the thunderbolt data. What protocol you are feeding to the display and the diplay size will limit your options. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207448\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204154\nFor example, the LG 5k displays are thunderbolt and you get two, one on each side of the MacBook Pro. HDMI adapter might let you chain a second display from a primary display based on the quality of the hub and the resolution on both, but I am 90% certain that won’t work either. Plan on one display per physical port on the Mac. \n\nNow, some displays will mirror the same DisplayPort stream apparently. I haven't seen this but have no reason to suspect these reports aren't 100% correct.\n\n\n*\n\n*El Capitan and Daisy Chaining\n\n*Display Daisy-Chaining with High Sierra\n\nA: \nCan I connect three monitors and provide power to my MacBook Pro with a single cable?\n\nYes.\nThere are eGPUs capable of driving at least three 4K displays while supplying power to the MacBook on a single Thunderbolt/USB-C port.\nExamples of such products here:\nhttps://www.sonnettech.com/product/egpu-breakaway-puck/overview.html\nA PCIe expansion chassis with a graphics card or two will also work: https://eshop.macsales.com/item/AKiTiO/3N2AA0002Y/\nI'm seeing 60 watts supplied to an attached MacBook as quite common, if this is sufficient power to avoid needing a separate power supply on a second USB-C port depends on the model of laptop and computing load.  Taking some load off with an eGPU should help in lowering power consumption.  Finding an expansion chassis or eGPU that supplies more than 60 watts may be difficult.  I expect this to change as more MacBook models come out that consume more than 60 watts.\n", "Q: iPhone X Activity and Health app: Doesn't work - shows spinning wheel instead I just switched from iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone X.  I have Apple Watch Series 3.  Everything worked great until I switched to iPhone X.  Now the Activity app on the phone (not the one on the watch) just gives a black screen with a spinner in the center and never does anything.  Things I've tried/verified:\n\n\n*\n\n*I went to iCloud > Devices and verified that the old iPhone 7 Plus is no longer tied to my account.\n\n*Before I shipped the iPhone 7 Plus back I erased all content and settings.\n\n*I've tried resetting the watch and setting it up as a brand new watch with the iPhone X.\n\n*Everything is turned on under Settings > Privacy > Motion and Fitness.\n\n\nRunning iOS 11.1.1 and watchOS 4.1.  I'm stumped.\nWhat else can I try to resolve this?\n\nUPDATE: It appears the Health app on the iPhone X has the same spinning wheel that never goes away:\n \nAnother thing, not sure if it matters but want to give as much info as possible.  This iPhone X was restored from my iCloud backup of a iPhone 7 Plus that was part of the beta program.  It was at version 11.2.(something).  But I could not put backups from that version on my new iPhone X.  So I had to downgrade my iPhone 7 Plus back to 11.1, then do an iCloud backup, then I was able to activate/restore my new iPhone X from that.\n\nA: It really sounds to me like a connection issue, especially since we've established multiple apps being unable to read data from the Watch.\nI would go through the process of unpairing and then restoring your Apple Watch to see if that resolves the issue. See: How to unpair and restore the Apple Watch.\nIf that fails you can call Apple Support as they can actually run diagnostics on your Apple Watch remotely (you will need to have your iPhone with you as well in order for them to do this). It doesn't take long to do and will help identify if there are any hardware issues.\n", "Q: How to delete or lock any terminal command? like \"date\" for changing data through mac terminal? How to delete or lock any terminal command?\nlike \"date\" for changing data through mac terminal? \nexample,\nthere is a way to change system time through terminal like \n \"sudo date mmddhhmmyy\"\nor any other command like \"ls\"\nso my question is can we lock the commands so that even the admin cant run them through sudo. In other words no one can run \"date\" in my terminal\n\nA: As long as an admin user can use sudo you can't stop them from circumventing any locks etc. as long as the command itself is still in the system. Even deleting the executable will not help as it can easily copied from another system, or compiled from source (deleting something from bin and sbin will break system scripts anyway, so this is really not a valuable approach).\nIf you are worried about admin users changing the system date you might be better of in restricting the number of admin users, or modifying sudoers to grant access to specific commands only. How you do this depends on your specific needs so it's difficult to recommend any specific solution right now. This page might be a good place to start reading though.\n", "Q: iphone, itunes store app: how to view text hidden by \"...\" I just went to look at the next album by Tune Yards and I can see it says \"Pre Order: expected J...\" but there appears to be no way to view this text!\nAnyone know how to expand it or get it show the full text\nI've seen the non expandable \"...\" before and it's annoyed me enough over time to post :)\n\nA: One way to view the full text is to tap on the Share icon at top right of the screen and then tap on one of the options such as the Message icon. Doing this will create a new Message with the full text followed by the URL. You can then just cancel the message, or send it to yourself!\nObviously, this is really just a workaround I use because I haven't come across another way within iOS to view the full text.\n", "Q: Where does File Sharing store SMB passwords Because of High Sierra 10.13.1, I had to switch from AFP protocols to SMB.\nI only got this working by storing passwords in System Preferences > File Sharing > Options > Windows File Sharing\n(strange: for iMac to iMac file sharing??)\nNow I wonder: where are those passwords stored on my disk?\nThe dialog already says that this is less secure .......\n\nA: If you enable Windows File Sharing for a user in System Preferences > File Sharing > Options > Windows File Sharing the method to encrypt and hash the password is modified in the local node of the sharing host's directory service.\nThe file affected is /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/$user.plist. $user is the name of the user account you enabled in Windows File Sharing. If you enable several users all respective plists are modified.\nTechnical background: in addition to the existing authentication authorities another one (SMB-NT) is added. SMB-NT is considered weak.\nYou can get the current authentication authorities of a user by entering:\ndscl . -read /users/$user authentication_authority #replace $user with a valid short user name\n\nUsually you have to enable this for older Windows clients (Windows XP etc) only!\n\nA: Your passwords are stored in your keychain.\nTo see what they are open Keychain Access (Applications > Utilities > KeyChain Access).  Then click on \"Passwords\" on the right.  For instance, I use a Synology Diskstation for both AFP and SMB access.  Looking it up in KeyChain Access, I can see the account credentials stored.\n\n", "Q: iPhone screen degraded performance - evident when using Maps I have an iPhone 5s and I have the following issue: after a while, the screen gets progressively less responsive and horizontal and vertical stripes appear. Things are much worse if I use the phone while moving (especially when using Maps) than if I'm at home or at the office. \nIs this behaviour indicative of a screen problem or of something else like a motherboard fault?\nIn the attached pictures, you can see the typical striped pattern. \n\n\n\nA: I've seen a few iPhones with vertical lines over the years, but can't recall if I've ever seen one with horizontal lines.\nFirstly, just to get this out of the way, I assume this is the original screen? I have seen strange behaviour such as this when non-genuine screens have been used. If you have a non-genuine screen, this could very well be your problem.\nAssuming it is a genuine screen, the first thing to try (because it's easy to do) is a full reboot of your phone. By this I mean simultaneously holding down the power and Home buttons until you see the Apple logo on your screen.\nIf a full reboot doesn't work, then the next thing to try is to manually do a full backup of your iPhone (via iTunes on your Mac/PC) and then restore the iPhone from that backup. This process resets your iPhone to default settings and can erase any firmware glitches.\nFinally, if none of the above explains or resolves the issue, then it's going to be a hardware issue. This could be a faulty/damaged display, but may also just be a loose connection. You're best bet is to take it into Apple or some other repairer to look at.\n", "Q: iCloud drive sharing on Sierra (Add People) On High Sierra there is an menu option (share button) to add people for a file inside iCloud Drive. Not on Sierra. However, I am able to call it programatically. \nI have noticed that it is in sharing extensions but it is grey. What do I do wrong to have native Finder share + Add people?\n\nThis one can be triggered programatically. However, it has view bugs (can't click Share options). \n\n\nA: I was unable to find any official Apple KB article explicitly stating that High Sierra is required for sharing files with people on iCloud. I have the same OSX version and experience exactly the same problem. \nThere is a workaround, however, that is officially supported by Apple - you can use iCloud.com and share files from there (PH21250). While not elegant, it certainly gets the job done. \nPerforming Google query for this issue reveals that this feature is mentioned explicitly with High Sierra software (CNET or AddictiveTips). While this is not official evidence that High Sierra is explicitly required to support this feature, it may suggest that Apple is forcing users to update to the latest software to receive such feature.\n", "Q: Does FaceID consume a significant amount of battery throughout the day? The FaceID requires the TrueDepth camera to recognise your face, plus there's also one sensor which emits infrared rays to map your face. So my question is will both these things consume significant amount of battery from my iPhone X and will it be better to turn the Require Attention for FaceID off so that the battery consumption is reduced?\n\nA: No - I tested this for several days with Face ID on and with Face ID off and I can't measure anything even close to 15 minutes or more difference in run times / overall battery difference.\nMy intuition is that whatever processing power is needed to power the infrared is more than counteracted by saving time unlocking where I'm tapping out my passcode to unlock the phone as opposed to having no passcode.\nI disregarded entirely:\n\n\n*\n\n*not having a passcode / unlock\n\n*disabling attention\n\n\nMy passphrase is something I type out with letters and numbers and not a numeric only short passcode, so ymmv but I'd be surprised if you have measurable differences on your device and iOS 11.\n", "Q: Mac => Samsung HDMI - No Sound I have connected an HDMI cable between my Samsung Smart TV and MacBook Pro running Sierra.\nThe option for output displays lists my TV but it says “display port” where I believe it should say HDMIi. I tried a lot of the methods I found online with no success. \n\nA: I have the same problem and I guess it is due to the adapter. I worked around it by adding an extra cable from mini jack to stereo cinch just for outputting the audio. The mini jack audio output is located on the other end of you MacBook.\n", "Q: How can I delete something from the Apple Pay wallet How do I remove an old boarding pass for Amtrak?  Tried settings, tried the info button on the lower right corner, I just don’t see any option to delete. \n\nA: Make sure you are using the Wallet app while your device is unlocked. You cannot make any changes to passes, cards, etc, when you are accessing the Wallet with the home-button double-click when the device is locked.\n\nA: There should be a Remove option when tapping the info icon. \n\nIn the information one will see the Remove Pass option (May have to scroll):\n\n", "Q: Updating Mac app shared with Family Sharing prompts for family member's password I'm trying to update a paid app, bought by a family member but shared with family sharing, on the Mac App Store, and it prompts me for the password. The Apple ID is the family member's, and greyed out so I can't change it. I don't think we're supposed to share all our passwords in order to use Family Sharing, right?\n\nA: TL;DR - It's possible you have a problem with date / certificates or Apple messed up server side - contacting support to figure out a workaround is likely the \"answer\" and you probably didn't make this happen.\n\nThis is an aggravating bug and it has been around for quite some time (from iOS 9 to iOS 10 is when I first experienced it).\nI'm certain it's a bug since I never, ever have used the password for the other two members of the family that buys apps that I then installed using the App Store and my ID / password. Also - if this was broken for everyone, all the time, it would be explained in a KB article or fixed.\nI have yet to have anyone from Apple support end up with anything other then ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ and I have to delete the apps and reinstall them.\nI hope someone else can get more details or point out something I've missed and even better, I hope I can come back and edit this to say it's fixed when that day comes.\n", "Q: Is it possible to control dimensions of cropping an image? I'm looking for a tool that can help reshape images to specific dimensions, but I'm not sure if there's a term easy to search for tools that support that.\nPreview can resize images to specific dimensions, but at the cost of losing dimension ratio. However you can create a square here in preview to specify how to crop, then to zoom in our out of image to get the crop you want, however you cannot specify that crop dimensions, only the image dimensions.\nIs there a software or a key term for feature that can help you specify crop dimension? (not image dimension)\nExample: Here I have to carefully drag the border to make it a square, but is there a way to create a crop area with predefined dimensions?]\n\n\nA: Depending on your needs you might resize all images first, then specify the crop and potentially resize again after if needed. It's really up to your workflow which operation needs to happen in which order.\n\nPhotos manually (which also has a very nice square crop tool and can export and re-sample the image if needed). The next step would be to have  automator or AppleScript control Photos (or your editor of choice) to make entering specific dimensions easier. If you don't mind shell scripting, the tool I've used to script this for many images is https://www.imagemagick.org/\nYou can get it with https://brew.sh and install quite easily. You should spend 10 minutes installing brew and the command line tools (free) from Apple and skip installing Xcode unless you feel you want the whole developer toolset. That might take 30 minutes or more to install.\nThere are dozens of tutorials on how to do this - here are three:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.macworld.com/article/1153762/resize_images_automator.html\n\n*https://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/how_to_batch_convert_and_resize_images_with_automator\n\n*https://9to5mac.com/2016/04/27/how-to-quickly-resize-images-mac-using-automator-service/\n", "Q: How can I merge Notes from two Macbooks without using iCloud? I have two laptops and both have different Notes that are useful to me.\nNot wanting to share any such data with Apple, they are also not synced to iCloud.\nSo far, I found the path where they are stored:\n~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.notes\n\nAnd see that the \"DB\" behind this is sqlite.\nIs there any way to export all all the content in one directory and then clear all notes so the files can be re-imported?\nI could see perhaps altering a bit the sqlite DB (or merge the two) and then have my notes from both Macs in one place in the end but lack a starting point or guide. I know iCloud sync is the easy way, but consider confidential data from clients where we agreed not to store the data online or transfer / store it external to the Mac in question.\n\nA: You can use Exporter (free app from app store) to save all notes as text to a folder on your computer. Then import them into other notes. \nIt likely did work equivalent or extending on this reverse-engineering effort to get data from the database that backs the application:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://articles.forensicfocus.com/2013/11/02/analysis-of-ios-notes-app/\n\n*What format does the apple notes sqlite db date use?\nYou could also just set up an IMAP server (even on your Mac) to sync up and then merge down the notes. iCloud isn’t the only server that can sync notes.\n\n\n*\n\n*Sync Notes from Mac and iOS devices without iCloud\n", "Q: Why Does Photos Not Display All Pictures in Library? macOS 10.12.6, Photos 2.0, running on a mid-2010 Macbook Pro.\nI updated my Macbook Pro to Photos when Photos was introduced, and it has worked well for me. Two days ago, however, Photos began to misbehave by not showing pictures in the Photos Library which had been taken after August 2015. Until this occurrence, these pictures had displayed correctly. The Mac's OS is up to date. I repaired the Photos library, and restored the Photos library from a Time Machine backup, and restarted in Safe Mode. Photos continues to not display these pictures. My pictures are managed locally only; iCloud is not involved.\nI have a second Mac, a Macbook Air I use for travel. For a consistent user environment, the Air runs the same software as the Macbook Pro. Photos on the Air correctly displays the entire library of photos, including those taken after mid-2015. I copied the Photos Library from the Air (~/Pictures), and replaced the Macbook Pro's Photos library with the Air's file. With the Air's library installed, the Macbook Pro's Photos continues to truncate and doesn't display pictures from after mid-2015. I repaired this Library (launch Photos while holding command and option) but Photos' misbehavior on the Macbook Pro continued. Both computers' Photos are Photos 2.0, build 3161.4.140.\nWhat else might I try? Is there a cache to empty or a preferences file to trash?\n\nA: Solved. Photos was set to read a different Photos library, not the complete one I’d copied from the Macbook Air. Launching Photos while holding the Option key brought up the “Select Library” dialog. I reset the selection to the correct complete Library, and the entire suite of pictures immediately appeared.\n", "Q: How to downgrade to macOS Sierra without Time Machine I upgraded to High Sierra a week ago, my MacBook Pro 2016 (15 inch) is very slow now even in normal daily usage.\nI wanted to downgrade back to Sierra, but even tho my MacBook came originally with Sierra, I cannot find it in \"App Store > Purchases\", there is only Mavericks which I bought on my previous MacBook.\nIs there any way I can download Sierra from Apple? Is there any other trustable source?\nOr maybe I would see Sierra in App Store if I re-install \"OS X Mavericks\" again?\n\nA: I got it from this link.\nIMPORTANT:\nDO NOT downgrade using macOS Sierra (10.12 Installer) disk utility to Erase your disk, you HAVE TO use the Online Recovery tool (or High Sierra (10.13) Disk Utility) to Erase your disk from APFS back to HFS+ , then restart and use your macOS Sierra installer from USB.\nIf you use Sierra to Erase disk, you'll get stuck in a Reboot Loop which is what happened to me.\n", "Q: Dictionary App constantly downloading dictionaries I've been unable to use my Dictionary App for a few days, as it consistently says that it is downloading the dictionaries. I can't find out why it started downloading them again (it already had them), or how to check on the state of a download, or where it is downloading from. I am at a loss as to how to diagnose this. Any ideas?\n\nA: This kept happening to me too, again with the recent update to 10.13.4. In dictionary preferences, I had selected multiple dictionaries. Turning them off, restarting the app, and turning them back on resolved the issue. \n\nA: I've experienced this problem once in a while, and find that it's due to the DictionaryServiceHelper process freezing. To fix it, first I quit Dictionary, and then I open a terminal and type:\npkill -9 DictionaryServiceHelper\n\nYes, you really do need to send the dangerous SIGKILL (signal 9) in this case.\nIf you're not a command line person, you can alternatively open Activity Monitor, search for DictionaryServiceHelper, and force quit it.\n", "Q: How do I recover free space from my logical volume group?

The problem here is: the APFS container partition might have been smaller than the now available free space.\nThe good news is: the (former) size of the container is stored in the APFS superblock which shouldn't have been modified by creating a hybrid MBR.

I saw the answer for 10.10 and 10.9.  Sadly I just jumped from 10.8 to 10.11 and discovered that my beautiful and perfectly well-functioning (last night) display is not kaput (too dark).

ARGH!!!!\n\nA: Just found a simple way to do this that I already had available to me (simple for me, maybe or maybe not for others).  My mac mini is set up as a triple boot (Windows, 10.6, 10.11 [was 10.8 until last night]).  I have some programs that I still use that only work through 10.6 and some others times I need the newer 10.8 (and just got a newer iPhone and it needed a newer version of iTunes to allow backup which is what got me going on changing to 10.11 anyhow).  Anyway, setting the brightness in 10.6 and then rebooting into 10.11 works.  Obviously, not great if you have to quickly make it dimmer, but this solution is the best for me.

When you right click you get several options and bottom option is delete. It then asks you if you want to permanently book and it deletes it from iCloud as well.\n\nA: As of iOS 11 & OS X 10.13 (High Sierra), there is no way to permanently delete items from iBooks. The closest option is to hide them, where they can only be restored (unhidden) from iBooks on OS X.\n", "Q: Macbook photo storage for digital art, strategies? My wife is a digital artist and has a Macbook pro, iPhone, and iPad, and I am constantly having to clear disk space from the Macbook due to all of the selfies, snaps, cat pictures, and legitimate photos that she takes constantly.  I know I am not alone; these days, cameras are ubiquitous and the Apple product family has some of the best camera hardware and software, and the platform is widely used for digital art.\nHer Macbook has 256GB of storage, which is always nearly full; I run a cleaner on it periodically, and have her delete silly pictures she doesn't need, but we shouldn't have to deal with this - non-mac laptops can ship with far more space, and even the current (2017) most expensive Macbook only has 512GB of storage.  If I could tape a 1T usb stick inside the case, I would.\nI am looking for strategies to deal with this, other than enabling photo compression/resizing on the macbook (she needs to edit her legit photos).\nHer usage pattern is a single Photos library that is replicated with her iCloud account, which is fed with images from all of her devices.\niCloud clearly isn't cutting it, as it's an \"all or nothing\" proposition - I can't segment the library and only replicate certain types of pictures/directories to her other devices.  \nI am open to anything, and willing to pay for a solution if one exists.  I have a large NAS in the home, but she frequently works on-the-go. \n\nA: Actually, current 15\" model MBPs are configurable with up to a 2TB SSD, and the 13\" models up to a 1TB SSD.\nAs for your current setup, if your wife is often on the go then any online solution (be it iCloud or something else) may not really cut it. So, if it was me, I would just use an external USB drive. \nThis is portable enough to take on the road, and to keep connected when at home. Of course, you'd want to make sure that you configure your backup regime to include its data in your backups, but this is really the easiest way to increase capacity.\nAnother option is to rearrange your data generally so that you use your internal SSD mainly for your digital art, and use an external drive for any other large amounts of data (e.g. iTunes music library). Of course this is just a matter of prioritising what's more important to you.\nFinally, you may want to check what's using up space on the SSD. You may find that something unexpected is taking up a lot of space (e.g. com.apple.bird, etc). While you can try to determine this manually, an easier way to check this is to use software such as DaisyDisk.\nIMPORTANT: I assume since you have a NAS setup at home you've already got a backup regime in place. If not, organise one now!\n", "Q: Screensaver lost functions since High Sierra upgrade, can't wake screen with keyboard Since the High Sierra upgrade, I no longer can wake my screen with the \"esc\" key or by pressing any key or moving my mouse.

Is there a tweak for this so I can get back these functions that I used daily with Sierra? Thanks!\n\nA: Try turning ON the following setting:\n\nSystem Preferences > Mission Control > Displays have separate Spaces: ON (checked)\n\nThen log out and log back in again for it to take effect.\nNot really a solution—more of a workaround—since maybe you want that setting disabled.  But I guess it might be a bug in High Sierra, because I don't think the Mission Control settings should affect the screensaver...\n", "Q: Why Mac Terminal remembers two consecutive commands when they are same? I started using Mac recently and before I used to work on Ubuntu.\nSuppose I run these commands one by one on my terminal:\npython3 main.py\npython3 main2.py\npython3 main2.py\npython3 main2.py\npython3 main2.py\npython3 main2.py\npython3 main2.py\n\nNow suppose I want to run python main.py again, so I will click the up key. I will need to click up key only twice on Ubuntu but 7 times on Mac. \nIf two consecutive commands are same, then terminal should remember only one command instead of remembering two different commands.\nHow can I make this happen on macOS?\n\nA: Why does this happen?\nMacOS and Ubuntu are configured differently out of the box to handle duplicates in bash's command history. These configurations are stored in a number of so-called \"dot-files\". These take the form of ~/.bash* as well the system wide /etc/profile. All of these files might be customised to your liking and differentiate between interactive shells, login shells, remote shells etc. These files are read in a specific order and serve specific functions.\nHow to get the same behaviour on macOS?\nIf you want just this one, single customisation of \"ignoring exact duplicates of command lines\" you may go with something like Allan's answer, i.e. add a single single line to for example your bash_profile file. There is no \"the proper way\" but countless options.\nIn case this is not the only customisation for your bash then this might be not the best option:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*~/.bash_profile should be super-simple and just load .profile and .bashrc (in that order)\n  \n*~/.profile has the stuff NOT specifically related to bash, such as environment variables (PATH and friends)\n  \n*~/.bashrc has anything you'd want at an interactive command line. Command prompt, EDITOR variable, bash aliases for my use\n  \n  \n  A few other notes:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Anything that should be available to graphical applications OR to sh (or bash invoked as sh) MUST be in ~/.profile\n  \n*~/.bashrc must not output anything\n  \n*Anything that should be available only to login shells should go in ~/.profile\n  \n*Ensure that ~/.bash_login does not exist.\n  \n\nThat means, when things get more complex it is good idea to spread out the customisations into multiple files, each of them specialised and highly ordered in their contents:\nAll exports may reside in their own file for simplified oversight.\nCreate a file that is read by bash at the root of your user directory, for example called .exports that contains:\n# Omit duplicates and commands that begin with a space from history.\nexport HISTCONTROL='ignoreboth'; \n\nThis needs to be \"sourced\" so that the file is read by bash on interactive startup:\n\nSourcing files \n  If you have a lot of shell configurations, you may want to split them out into several subfiles and use the source builtin to load them from your .bashrc:\n  with adding source ~/.exports to it.\n\nAlternatively, to ensure the files actually exist before loading\nif [ -f ~/.exports ]; then\n. ~/.exports\nfi\n\nThe command . ~/.exports will source ~/.exports in the context of the currently running shell.\n\nThis is particularly useful for adding aliases, the separate file makes it easier to re-load them when you make changes.\n\n\nA: You need to add the HISTCONTROL environment variable to your .bash_profile.  In your .bash_profile add the following line:\nexport HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth:erasedups\n\nClose and restart your bash session and the dupes should be gone.  Alternatively, you could just execute that same line and it will take effect for that session (use it to test it out).\n\nFrom the manual page for bash(in Terminal):\n\nHISTCONTROL\n  A colon-separated list of values controlling how commands are saved on the history list. If the list of values includes ignorespace, lines which begin with a space character are not saved in the history list. A value of ignoredups causes lines matching the previous history entry to not be saved. A value of ignoreboth is shorthand for ignorespace and ignoredups. A value of erasedups causes all previous lines matching the current line to be removed from the history list before that line is saved. Any value not in the above list is ignored. If HISTCONTROL is unset, or does not include a valid value, all lines read by the shell parser are saved on the history list, subject to the value of HISTIGNORE. The second and subsequent lines of a multi-line compound command are not tested, and are added to the history regardless of the value of HISTCONTROL.\n\n\nA: To uniqely record every new command is tricky. First you need to add to\n~/.profile or similar:\nHISTCONTROL=erasedups\nPROMPT_COMMAND='history -w'\n\nThen you need to add to ~/.bash_logout:\nhistory -a\nhistory -w\n\n", "Q: Will migrating an SSD drive to APFS prolong its life? For Apple hardware that ships with SSD only storage, will switching the file system from HFS+ to APFS prolong the life of an SSD drive? \n\nA: \nWill switching the file system from HFS+ to APFS prolong the life of\n  an SSD drive?\n\nNo.  APFS was optimized for flash (NAND) SSDs.  In other words, it was designed to fully utilize the capabilities of an SSD to provide better performance.  It wasn't implemented to prolong the life of an SSD.\nIn most respects, the life will be shortened. Why?  Increased write operations for \n\n\n*\n\n*Encryption\n\n*Snapshots\n\n*Metadata\n\n\nNone of that matters however, because based on the calculated life expectancy of an SSD, you will run out of capacity, long before it dies from usage.  In other words, it's a moot point.\n\nWhat other advantages/disadvantages it might bring?\n\nThis is entirely opinionated question.  However, one thing to keep in mind is the initial premise of the answer - APFS was designed for SSDs. Meaning it wasn't designed for traditional spinning hard disks.  Quite frankly, I've never upgraded a file system and thought \"gee...this new feature is a disadvantage.\"\nSo, a better way to look at this is the advantages/disadvantages of running APFS on spinning disks versus SSDs.\nFor example, APFS on an SSD has encryption at it's core rather than another layer on top of the file system so, it's faster and more secure (advantage).  On a spinning drive, this results in more read/writes on the physical media meaning slower performance, higher overhead, and shorter lifespan (disadvantage).\nFor an indepth look from a ZFS developers perspective, see this article\n", "Q: How to remove Your carrier may charge for SMS Messages used to activate FaceTime This message keeps coming back:\n\"Your carrier may charge for SMS Messages used to activate FaceTime\"\nI managed to get rid of it before but when I change the SIM card it pops up again.\nIt's similar to \"Your carrier may charge for SMS messages used to activate iMessage\", which I got rid of this time but I don't remember how.\nHow to quickly ensure both these messages don't pop up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your carrier may charge for SMS messages used to activate iMessage\n\n*Your carrier may charge for SMS Messages used to activate FaceTime\n\n\nIdeally forever, but I'm ok with a quick solution that I can quickly find back here on Ask Different.\nOh and I want to keep Facetime enabled.

This story about a new Thunderbolt 3 dock from Promise Technology shows one of the two USB 3.0 ports labeled “USB 3.0 BC1.2”.\n\nSome searches show results for \"BC 1.2 port\" but I've not yet seen a definition or explanation.\n\nA: USB-BC stands for \"USB Battery Charging\" and it is an optional enhancement to USB ports allowing them to provide power to charge mobile devices, with or without a data connection.  In a sea of multiple standards for doing this, USB-BC is probably the most widely implemented and the most simple to implement, but it is fairly modest and its maximum power level - 5 to 7.5 Watts - is low by today's standard, relegating it to a \"lowest common denominator\" of charging standards.\nUSB ports were originally only intended for data and for a small amount of power, enough to power a low power device like a keyboard.  It was assumed that more power hungry devices like printers and hard drives would supply their own power.  At the time, USB wasn't designed with the portability of small laptops or mobile devices in mind.\nUSB ports can initially guarantee that they can supply only 0.1A of power to devices (0.5W).  This isn't very much, but if a device needs more, it can request more by sending a request on the data lines as it starts up.  The maximum a standard USB port can provide is 0.5A for USB 2 and 0.9A for USB 3.  With a working voltage of 5V that translates to 2.5W of power and 4.5W of power respectively, and even that is not guaranteed to be granted, as multiple devices sharing a host may need to divide this power between them.  The host keeps track of how much power each device has guaranteed to it.\nThis is not a great situation for devices that just want some power, and don't want to have to implement a whole serial communication on the data lines just to request it.  And even if the request works, it's still not much power.\nThe alternative to this is for the port to support one or more special charging or power delivery modes, implemented as extensions to USB.  These are commonly called \"fast charging\", but that name fails to convey that there are several different standards that are not compatible.\nNotable standards include:\n\n*\n\n*USB Battery Charging (USB-BC) (currently at version 1.2) - this is an official standard that provides for up to 1.5A on the port, and can be provided with or without a data connection.  It is typically implemented with a current limiter at the supply end and in practice the maximum current drawn under normal circumstances is nominally 1A (5 Watts).\nThese are by far the most common charging standard for dedicated USB chargers that don't otherwise specify a particular charging standard.  What's more, most of the more exotic fast charging standards can be easily made to be backwards compatible with USB-BC, meaning that your device will still charge at the standard USB Battery Charging rate as a fallback.\nNote that there are multiple modes of USB-BC - including modes in which the port is for charging only, and modes in which it can also use data at the same time.  The \"Dedicated Charging Port\" mode makes USB-BC very simple to implement in a charger device, with no need to be able to do any serial communication on the data lines, reducing costs.\n\n\n*Apple fast charging (12W) - A proprietary Apple extension to the above, allowing up to 2.4A (12W).  This is backwards compatible with USB-BC, and Apple devices like tablets can use it to charge a bit faster.  It is not possible to use data at the same time.\nYou'll often find cheap power supplies that claim to be able to supply 2.4A at 5V, and this is why: they support Apple's 12W fast charging standard, which is pretty simple to implement on a dedicated charging port, and is backwards compatible.  If you are implementing USB-BC and you know your power supply can provide the 2.4A, you may as well make it also compatible with this standard.  Non-Apple devices will usually just use it as a regular USB-BC supply.  In fact, it is so common for USB-BC supplies to implement Apple's standard that some people mistakenly conflate the two, thinking that USB-BC has a 2.4 Amp (12 Watt) mode.  It doesn't, it's just two different standards similar enough that chargers can easily support both.  (To technical people, the USB-BC dedicated port just needs to short D+ and D- to convey this to the device, while Apple's standard requires putting +2.7V on both D+ and D- - it's easy to do both at once.)\n\n\n*Other proprietary fast charging standards like Qualcomm QC 1.0-3.0, and more.  The more complex of these introduced special signaling on the USB 1.1/2.0 data lines to negotiate a particular voltage and current.  It was not normally possible to use data at the same time.\nQualcomm QC 4.0 is implemented on top of USB-PD (which is described below), requiring USB-C cables and connectors but achieving the impressive feat of backwards compatibility with USB-PD, USB-BC and previous Qualcomm QC versions.\nSome manufacturers rebrand proprietary fast charging standards, for example Samsung's \"Fast Charging\" is Qualcomm QC 2.0, and Samsung's \"Super Fast Charging\" is Qualcomm QC 4.0.\n\n\n*USB Power Delivery (USB-PD). This is a new official standard, to supplement USB-BC (it doesn't have to replace it, and power supplies may continue to allow both, on the same port).  Unlike USB-BC and the above standards, it requires features in USB Type C connectors and cables, so it's electrically not compatible with earlier USB cables or sockets.\nUSB-PD can support considerably more power than USB-BC, which allows it to be used on even higher power consuming devices such as laptop computers.  It can allow up to 144 Watts over a standard USB-C cable or 240 Watts over special USB-C cables that rated for 5 Amps.\nUSB-PD can happen simultaneously with data transfer, and is even quite independent of it: it doesn't require the \"data\" pins to negotiate power delivery but dedicated \"CC\" pins instead, the power itself is delivered over separate pins to the regular 5V supply pins, and power delivery can happen in either direction regardless of the data connection.\n\nA: Battery Charging spec\nBC 1.2 is an abbreviation for (USB) Battery Charging (revision) 1.2. I'm no USB specs specialist so I can link some abstracts/files only:\n\n*\n\n*USB Battery Charging (Wikipedia)\n\n*USB Battery Charging Revision 1.2 (PDF)\n\n*Overview of USB Battery Charging Revision 1.2 and the Important Role of Adapter Emulators\n\n*Overview of USB Battery Charging Revision 1.2 and the Important Role of Charger Detectors\nBasically it's a USB 3.0 port with some extra features to detect devices that can make use of charge currents beyond the standard 900mA.\n\nA: The TLDR on this is that sometime in the last 10 years the minimum spec on powered USB-A ports became 1.5 A, and maximum became 3 A, but 2.4 A in practice.  USB-BC is increasingly becoming a redundant a meaningless standard.  Being replaced by USB 3.x and USB-PD.\nFrom the beginning of USB people discovered that was trivial to get 5 V of power from USB ports by just connecting to the V+ and GND.  This was being used for more than it's intended purpose of providing power to parallel port adapters and the like.  To this end it became customary to allow 100 mA or 500 mA on systems are were \"asleep\" to allow keyboard wakeup, or all too often run novelty Christmas lights.\nWhat the USB groups came up with was the USB-BC standard for providing power to devices even though they might not he making a data connection connection to the host.  For USB 2.0 devices this had the benefit of increasing power to a device to the max of what USB 3.x allows.  This meant USB-DC devices might enjoy 1.5 to 2.4 amp power on the same old USB-A ports.\nA USB device that is plugged it is supposed to limit itself to 100 mA (150 mA with USB 3.x) until \"enumerated\" by the host.  After enumeration come a possibility to ask for more power in larger increments which may or may not be allowed because of a hub or other devices taking power.  Depending on the spec followed this might mean 900 mA or 1.5 amps allow.\nThis changed at some point with USB-BC.  USB-BC allows for two power levels for unenumerated or enumerated devices, 5 watts or 12 watts.  There's older pre-USB-BC that allowed for levels in between, like 9 or 10 watts but these fell out of disuse.  There's non-USB standards that will provide 18 volts, meaning non-USB compliant devices to use this power, otherwise it's just another 5 watt worthless supply.  It looks like USB-BC is getting slowly replaced by the more popular parts of USB-BC being incorporated into USB 2.0, USB 3.x, USB4, and USB-PD.  The biggest \"jump\" being USB devices can expect 1.5A power without all the previous power query steps from USB before.\nMost any USB-A \"wall wart\" made to charge or power a device will be rated for 5 W or 12 watt.  Most any UAB-A port on an PC will be rate for 7.5 W (1.5 A) and rate to 15 watt (3 A) on a first come first served basis)\nSuch \"odd ball\" chargers you find will provide only 5 watts to anything else it is plugged into.  USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports on computers have been able to provide 1.5 amps for some time now, at least ten years given how my Apple SuperDrive draws 1.5 amps from a USB 2.0 port and it was made in 2010.\nThunderbolt requires 15 watts, or 5 volt @ 2.4 amp out after the USB-C to USB-A adapter takes it's bit of power.  Us that instead of the USB-BC port, if one is not enough.\n", "Q: Open multiple urls from Terminal I can open one chrome window through\nopen https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\n\nI can also open multiple URLs by multiple lines\nopen https://www.youtube.com/\nopen https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\n\nThe following won't work though\nopen https://www.youtube.com/ && https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\n\nbut it works with\nopen https://www.youtube.com/ && open https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\n\nI want an elegant inline expression like\nopen ('https://www.youtube.com/','https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page')\n\nHow to do that?\n\nA: Just supply all of the URLs you want to open as arguments to a single open command:\nopen https://www.youtube.com/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\n\nThe open command has been written to handle this.\nThe reason it doesn't work with && is that in shell syntax, && is a delimiter between different commands, not between arguments to the same command. So it was trying to run https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page as a separate command, which doesn't work.\nMore specifically, && runs the second command only if the first command succeeds. There are a number of command delimiters you can use with different meanings:\ncmd1 ; cmd2    # Runs cmd1 and then cmd2 (just as though they were on different lines)\ncmd1 & cmd2    # Runs cmd1 and cmd2 simultaneously, with cmd1 in the background\ncmd1 | cmd2    # Runs cmd1 and cmd2 simultaneously, with cmd1's output piped to cmd2's input\ncmd1 && cmd2    # Runs cmd1, and then if it succeeds runs cmd2\ncmd1 || cmd2    # Runs cmd1, and then if it fails runs cmd2\n\n\nA: Assuming you’re using the default bash shell:\nfor fff in $(echo https://one.com/whatever http://two.com/something%20else )\ndo\n    open $fff\ndone\n\nYou don’t necessarily need the $(echo a b c) and could just paste in the words.

I have been looking into the feasibility of creating an app that mines crypto-currency. I have been searching the appstore for similar apps but none have come up where the miner is part of the app.\nDoes anyone know if Apple allows mining on device from an approved app?\n\nA: Section 3.1.5 Cryptocurrencies explains in specific detail what review guidelines affect mining apps on device as well as address monetary wallet apps.\n\nApps may not mine for cryptocurrencies unless the processing is performed off device.\n\nIn 2017 the guidelines were not as clear App Store Review Guidelines\nBack then, section 2.4.2 contained the following:\n\nDesign your app to use power efficiently. Apps should not rapidly drain battery, generate excessive heat, or put unnecessary strain on device resources.\n\nUse of that clause to reject any crypto currency mining, which would by definition be CPU/GPU intentive, was always possible and now that potential ban is explicit.\n\nA: Apple prohibits direct mining of cryptocurrencies on iPhone and iPad. The Cupertino-based company has updated its app developer guidelines. ... In the future, apps that mine directly on the devices will be banned.\nI've familiarized myself with an app and can only talk about it well. The app makes it possible to verify the transactions between cryptocurrencies in order to get a share of the falling fees. The app mints the XMRig (Monero) algorithm as it only uses the CPU because most of them are more likely to have a better CPU than CPU. You want it to be usable for everyone.But that doesn't work on iOS, but on macOS. A demo is running on iOS that shows the hash rate but still gives BItcoins for it.\nI do not notice any loss of performance or any loss of battery. In the battery category in the settings, I can see that the app uses approx. 1-2% of the battery.

I've got a MacBook Pro 13\" 2017 - two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports. It came with a standard USB-C cable to support power supply. If I plug this cable into both USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports the Mac seems to think it's connected to a power supply. IMHO it's dangerous for battery in laptop, but I have to ask: is it any risk? \nWhat can happen to my MBP if I plug this one cable between both of its USB-C ports?\n\nA: There isn't any risk in doing this, but it'd be a self-defeating practice. Basically, what happens to your MBP will depend on which of the following scenarios is true:\n\n*\n\n*If the MBP is not also plugged into AC power - In this scenario, it's not a good idea as the MBP will slowly lose power faster than it would if the cable wasn't plugged into both ports.\n\n*If the MBP is plugged into AC power - In this scenario, the MBP will automatically accept the charge from the AC outlet source, rather than any other source. In other words, plugging a USB-C cable between two of its ports will have no effect.\n\nAlso, according to Apple:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your MacBook Pro draws power from only one power supply, even if more than one is attached—so using multiple power supplies won't\nspeed up charging.\n\n*If you connect multiple power supplies to your MacBook Pro, the one that provides the most power will be used, regardless of the order in which you connected them.\n\n\nSource: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207256\nFinally, the MacBook Pro (15-inch, Late 2016 and 2017 models) and MacBook (13-inch, Late 2016 and 2017, Four Thunderbolt 3 Port models) can power two devices that use up to 15 watts, and two more devices that use up to 7.5 watts.

Your partition layout is non-standard:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple_KernelCoreDump (789.6 MB disk0s4): probably a leftover of a High Sierra Beta install\n\n*Recovery HD (598.9 GB disk0s3): ~920 times too large. The standard size in non-APFS systems is 650.0 MB.\n\n\nI recommend to backup your main volume (Macintosh HD) with Time Machine, completely erase the whole disk booted to Internet Recovery Mode and reinstall macOS High Sierra and migrate the backup (or restore the backup after erasing the disk).\n\nA second approach is to reboot (Revert Status: Reboot required!), decrypt the drive if necessary and revert to non-CoreStorage. Then verify disk and main volume:\ndiskutil verifyDisk disk0\ndiskutil verifyVolume disk0s2\n\nand repair if required.\nThen merge disk0s2, disk0s3 and disk0s4:\ndiskutil mergePartitions HFS+ \"Macintosh HD\" disk0s2 disk0s4\n\nThis will merge disk0s2 (your old Macintosh HD), disk0s3 and disk0s4 into disk0s2 while preserving the content of disk0s2. I never had a problem merging slices like this but it's always beneficial to have a working (Time Machine) backup of disk0s2 (your Macintosh HD) before merging partitions.\nIf this step fails to merge the partitions (e.g disk0s4 is \"in use\"), boot to Internet Recovery Mode and try it again.\nVerify disk and main volume again:\ndiskutil verifyDisk disk0\ndiskutil verifyVolume disk0s2\n\nThen download and reinstall the latest macOS High Sierra to recreate the recovery partition. I don't think that Recovery Partition 4.0.4 is compatible with High Sierra already.\nFinally enable FileVault again.\n", "Q: Calculating a custom total for a column on iPad mini and Numbers How do I make a formula to total (sum) a column using Numbers on iOS, but exclude negative numbers?

To add numbers in a range based on multiple criteria, try the SUMIFS function.\n\nFor example:\n=SUMIFS(A2:A10, A2:A10, “>0”)\nLooks at all values greater than 0 and totals them up.\n\n\nTo use formulas and functions in Numbers for iOS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the cell in which you wish to have the calculation.  (In the attached example, for instance, cell A11)\n\n*Type the equals sign character = or select circled equals sign icon.\n\n*Start typing the name of the function you wish to use, or tap the fx at the top left of the virtual keyboard to see a list of functions to choose from.\n\n\nFor more detailed information on how to use formulas and functions in Numbers for iOS, please see the official documentation here from Apple.\n\n\n", "Q: Copy selected files from a Time Machine backup to iCloud? My wife's 2011 MacBook Pro died.  It had a 512GB hard drive that had about 350GB of stuff on it, about 200GB of it is irreplaceable pictures and movies.\nShe will get a new computer, but with Apple's new 2TB iCloud service for $10/mo I think it makes more sense to keep all of these infrequently-used files in the cloud along with our other backups rather than on her machine.  She doesn't need more than 128GB of space on the new computer if I can keep this other stuff in the cloud.\nI have a Time Machine backup of her computer before it died, so I want to restore certain files from that backup and put them on the iCloud drive.\nI tried mounting the drive, navigating to the \"Latest\" folder and simply dragging the files to the iCloud drive.  This did not work, Finder told me that I did not have enough space on the iCloud drive (not true since I now have 2TB and it was copying about 200GB).  I tried copying smaller folders and files one a time, some of these worked, but some did not, like the iPhoto Library which is about 170GB for the one file (which isn't really one file but a directory).\nI started to copy the files to the cloud with the command line, by simply using \"cp\" (other options are rsync, tar, etc).  This works in the sense that it seems to copy the files, but I know that Time Machine backup files are \"special\" because they have internal links and versioning.  In my case I don't care about the history but really just want a copy of the latest version of these files.\nI am looking at the backup drive on another computer, an iMac.  I can browse through the files and Time Machine can restore them, but it would try to restore them to this iMac, which I don't want. I can also use Migration Assistant to do the same thing.  My iMac has 85GB available, not enough to restore everything.  It has a 500GB drive though, so I could probably do something like copy a bunch of stuff from the iMac to the cloud, delete it from the iMac, restore the backup to the iMac, copy that to the cloud, then restore the iMac's files from the cloud.  Or I could use an external drive to do something similar. But that would take many hours and I'd be worried about losing something.\nAlso given the irreplaceable nature of the files in the Time Machine backup I want to make sure I do this the right way.  Is there a way to simply restore files from the backup directly to the iCloud drive?\nEDIT: I just found \"tmutil\" which seems to be exactly what I need.  I tried to use that to restore the entire backup to the cloud.  It ran for a few minutes (nowhere near enough time to actually copy everything), reported that it restored everything, but after looking there wasn't anything actually copied. Why is that?\n\niMac$ tmutil restore -v Latest/Macintosh\\ HD/Users// \n  /Users//Library/Mobile\\ Documents/com\\~apple\\~CloudDocs/ \n  Total copied: 334453.70 MB (350700119382 bytes) Items copied: 562891\n\n\nA: Since you say that the 200 GB of pictures and movies are irreplaceable, I submit that it's worth the small expense of buying a 200 GB or larger external hard disk, so that you can first extract the files you want to keep to this disk and verify they are present and correct before trying to transfer them to iCloud Drive. \nI'm not familiar with tmutil but it sounds as if you should be able to access the files from the backup using Browse Other Backup Disks as described in various answers to this question:\n\nBefore going into Time Machine, open a Finder window and choose\n  \"Computer\" from the Finder's Go menu. (That's the key to being able to\n  browse another computer's backup drive.) Then hold the option key and\n  choose \"Browse Other Backup Disks\".\n\niCloud Drive used with the Store in iCloud option described here should be able to store your files in the way that you want but I don't know how it behaves if you try to copy a large amount of data (which is more than the free space on your local disk, if I understand correctly) in one go. You might have to copy the files in chunks that will fit on the local drive and wait for iCloud Drive to copy them and free up the space again before copying the next chunk. Alternatively you might want to look at alternative cloud storage services like Dropbox, where you can upload files through a web interface into a folder that doesn't automatically sync back to your local disk.\n\nA: was looking for the same thing and came across this on apple support:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201104\n\"You can store any type of file in iCloud Drive, as long as it's 50GB or less in size and you don't exceed your iCloud storage limit. \"\nthought I share for who ever comes by.\n", "Q: Is there a way to disable Facetime from starting? I don't use facetime. I'd like to disable it so it doesn't automatically start following system startup. Is there a way to do this? (MacBook Pro, High Sierra)\n\nA: I found this way to keep Facetime from running at startup.  Since it's a rather insidious program, you have to take much more drastic steps to force this program to play nicely.\nThere is a .plist file that can cause Facetime to run during startup.  Delete that file, and it should no longer start automatically.  It should still run normally if you want (by clicking on the app icon in the Applications folder).\nThe file can be found at:\n/Users/[account_name]/Library/Preferences/com.apple.facetime.plist\n...where [account_name] is your user name.  The easiest way to find it is through terminal as the Library/ directory is usually hidden in the graphical interfaces (Finder).\nJust delete that file and reboot.  I'm pretty sure nothing important is stored in that file, other than \"run me during startup!\"\nTested on High Sierra.\n\nA: Navigate to: System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> Login Items.\nOn this screen you can choose which programs will open automatically upon startup. You can remove FaceTime from this list to disable it opening on startup.\nYou can also add any programs you would actually like to start when you boot up.\n\n", "Q: Different contact db on one iPhone I've seen this question.

I copied the default keybindings file from Linux, which mostly worked, with the exception of Ctrl + C for copy. \nI can't figure out why Ctrl + C doesn't work, since Ctrl + X cut, Ctrl + V paste, etc. all work. It seems like only copying is broken. I also tried going into Preferences > Keyboard > App Shortcuts, and added a shortcut for Sublime Text with ^C mapped to \"Copy\". Unfortunately, that didn't work either.\nDoes anyone know why this is happening and how I can fix it?\n\nA: Update: I'm still not sure what the problem was, but deleting ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3 solved it. It looks like my default Sublime packages got screwed up to the point where it was somehow overriding all the user provided keymaps, among other issues. But now that I've regenerated the folder, setting keybindings works like normal.\nAs for why only Ctrl+C was affected and not Ctrl Z, X, or V, it's because Sublime has a default shortcut for Ctrl+C defined on Macs (cancel_build), but no shortcuts for Ctrl+Z, X, or V. Other shortcuts which clash with a predefined shortcut such as Ctrl+K were also broken.\n", "Q: MacBook randomly sleeps after waking My MacBook Pro often sleeps randomly after waking (the displays go dark and it either wakes itself up immediately after or has to be awoken by pressing a key).\nI have noticed this happening often right after I wake up the mac, but I believe it has also happened during normal use, for no apparent reason (no key is pressed at the time the computer goes to sleep.\nA few details about the MacBook:\n\n\n*\n\n*The MacBook is running macOS High Sierra 10.13.1;\n\n*The model is MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017);\n\n*An external Thunderbolt 2 display is connected via a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter;\n\n*I connect my iPhone through a USB dock which connects to the MacBook through the Thunderbolt display. I cannot confirm whether the phone was plugged in when the event happened.\n\n*I usually keep my MacBook connected to a power source during use, which means most if not all of these events have happened while plugged into power. These factors may not be related, however.\n\n\nI managed to capture the logs from pmset -g log which I think are around the event (I cannot be sure if these logs correspond exactly to the event but

resetting both the NVRAM and SMC.\nBefore following the steps below, ensure you have no external hardware connected and that you're using the built-in keyboard.\nResetting the NVRAM on a 2017 MacBook Pro model\nTo reset the NVRAM on all 2017 MacBook Pro models (with and without Touch Bar) follow these steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MBP. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then immediately press the commandoptionpr keys. \n\n*Keep these keys pressed down for at least 20 seconds!\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your MBP reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nReset the SMC\nThere's a couple of ways you can reset the SMC on your MBP, however I prefer the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MBP\n\n*Keep the power cable plugged in\n\n*Press at the same time shiftoptioncontrol (on the left side of the keyboard) and the power button and keep these keys down for at least 10 seconds\n\n*Let go\n\n*Turn your computer back on with the power button\n\n\nAfter resetting both the NVRAM and SMC, use your MBP to determine if the problem still occurs. Let me know how you go.\n", "Q: Unable to update Apple ID I use a gmail address as my Apple ID. I recently made an icloud address using my mac. Now I wanted to change my Apple ID to my icloud address today.\nI found these official instructions.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-in/HT202667\nI did whatever was mentioned there. I signed out Apple ID on my mac. I don't have any other apple device. And I went to the apple ID site to make the change but it only gives me the following error.\nYour Apple ID cannot be updated at this time. Please try again later.\nIf that matters, yes my icloud address is added as secondary address for my Apple account and I can login using this address. But I want this as my primary address not the gmail one. I have tried changing multiple times but nothing happens other than that error. Please help!\n\nA: I spoke to the customer support again. This time an attentive guy there was able to point out the issue that is happening with my account.\nApparently Apple has put some restriction on new iCloud email accounts and they cannot be used as primary Apple ID for first 30 days.\nThey have added the following note in the documentation page as well but it is written in fine text so it goes unnoticed. One has to pay attention to notice it. It says:\n\"If you try to change your Apple ID to an @icloud.com email address created within the last 30 days, you might be asked to try again later.\"\nI made my @icloud address 2 days back, so I guess in my case I have wait for 28 more days after which I hope I will be able to change my primary Apple ID address. Let's see.\n\nA: The problem that you have is that the iCloud address you created with your Mac is already an Apple ID in its own right!\nSo, instead of changing your old Apple ID to your new iCloud address, you need to think of it in terms of either only using your new iCloud Apple ID, or of using both with each one used for different purposes.\nFor example, you can still use your old one to remain signed in for your App Store purchases, but use your iCloud one for all your iCloud services, etc.\nAnother option is to just juggle between them if/when you need to.\nIn my case I have an iCloud Apple ID and my original Apple ID. My iCloud Apple ID is used for syncing Contacts, Calendar events, Reminders, Notes, Safari bookmarks/history, Find My iPhone, iCloud Drive and so on. My original Apple ID is used for iTunes and the App Store as I have a lot of purchases on that account, so it's just more convenient. However, if/when I need to, I can log out of iTunes or the App Store and then log in with my other Apple ID.\nAlso, of particular relevance to you, is the following statement by Apple:\n\nIf your Apple ID email address ends with @icloud.com, @me.com, or\n  @mac.com, you can only change your email address to another\n  @icloud.com, @me.com, or @mac.com email that's already associated with\n  your account.\n\nSource: https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT202667\nFinally, for a long time users have requested the ability to merge Apple IDs. Apple has never allowed this, so until they have a change in policy, there is no way around this.\n", "Q: A file viewer like in Total Commander / Krusader I use DoubleCommander, which is a decent 2-panel file manager.\nWhat I am missing is a viewer for the use case of peeking at a text file, especially logs:\n\n\n*\n\n*quick to load\n\n*handles large text files (GBs)\n\n*handles page up/down\n\n*allows find / next / previous / highlight\n\n\n*\n\n*remembers the searched strings\n\n\n*zoom, ideally with Control + mouse wheel\n\n*capable of closing with \"esc\"\n\n*capable of reloading the file on demand (F5)\n\n\n*\n\n*remembers the position over reloads\n\n\n*ideally, configurable key shortcuts\netc.\n\n\nIn short, something to quickly open the file, find a string, have it open, reload when necessary at roughly the same place. Developers will find this very familiar.\nIs there such app? Sublime it aint, File Viewer neither, jEdit neither, TextEdit neither... I've tried quite a lot of them but there's always some blocker.\nBoth Krusader and Total Commander have great viewers, so I believe Mac community produced one, too. (Not counting running Total Commander in Wine :)\n\nA: I found that the closest match is DoubleCommander. With some Mac quirks, as Mac lacks keys like Insert, PgUp/PgDn so it's impossible to map the actions to shortcuts I am used to. But still, it's a decent (cross-platform) two-panel manager.\n\nA: The Console.app is quite close. Except it doesn't support zooming and even I can't manage to set the font size. Not sure how that works on Apple, there's the font dialog but that doesn't change the text size.\n", "Q: How to get to Tweet in native iOS Twitter app from another app's webview? Often I'm in some iOS app (e.g. Facebook) and there's a link to some Tweet's URL. When I tap on it, it takes me to the web version of the Tweet inside a webview in whatever app I was in. Then if I want to like the Tweet, I have to login to Twitter again inside the webview even though I'm already logged in to Twitter in the native iOS Twitter app. Is there a quick way to get to the same Tweet in the native app?\n\nA: At least in the case of Facebook I found an easy way to do this, from the top right menu:\n\n\nA: You answered it yourself. Facebook has a link to open in twitter. So I'm not sure how handy my answer woulld be for all the different social media apps. \nFor the situation where the app only gives you a link, there's a great ios app called Opener (~$2).\nLink to their website, where you can find a list of the supported apps.\n\n\nMost of the time I use this for going back and forth between Youtube app and ProTube. ProTube is my main youtube app (because of picture in picture and background play), but for what ever reason it won't work with apple tv like 99% of the time. So sometimes when I've already started watching the video in ProTube and want to use apple tv, I end up using opener to open the video in Google's Youtube app which works fine with apple tv (for the most part).\n\n\n\n", "Q: How to install a FTP client from the command line on Mac?

Unfortunately, I don't seem to have it installed ...\nlocalhost:myproject davea$ ftp\n-bash: ftp: command not found\n\nand when I tried to install using \"brew install ftp\" I got the following error ...\nError: No available formula with the name \"ftp\"\n==> Searching for a previously deleted formula...\nWarning: homebrew/core is shallow clone.

If you have Sierra installed and are using either of these commands, you will need to make a copy before upgrading to High Sierra. \nYou would not necessary need Sierra.

The second is shown as family member for sharing.\n\nA: I have solved the issue (after a hour with Apple support, which was escalated to an Expert).\nThe short answer; I needed to log out of the Apple ID which I use for Contacts and Calendar, and log into the original \"Primary\" Apple ID.\nI could not do this, because \"it was already logged in\". This was \"resolved\" by deleting the ID in Internet Accounts.\nI could then login as the old Apple ID, enable sharing, logout, then login as my iCloud ID.\nIn the mean time I could not login because I did not know the answers to the \"Security Questions\", and was prompted to enter new answers (which seemed to be designed for an American teenager, not an ageing man who can't even remember his time at school).

I recently bought an Apple Watch Series 3 to track my exercise, steps and so on, and I’m trying to get it to work properly with MyFitnessPal, but something has gone astray.\nIn MyFitnessPal I’ve chosen my Apple Watch as the device to track steps. And, in the Health app I’ve given permission for MyFitnessPal to read Apple Watch data for Steps, Walking + Running Distance, and Workouts.\nThe problem is, whenever I look at my Diary in MyFitnessPal it never seems to capture the exercise I’m doing, and this is throwing out all my Calories remaining for the day. It does show an indication of my steps, but I’m not being allocated any calories for this or other exercise.\nI called Apple Support and they checked all my settings for the Health app and Apple Watch and everything is good. I contacted MyFitnessPal and as far as they can tell, I’ve set everything right within their app as well. \nSo why isn’t this working? Has anyone else come across this? Is there a fix? I’m desperate to get this working!\nThanks in advance for any and all help! :)\n\nA: This may sound silly, but since everything is okay according to Apple and MyFitnessPal, are you actually doing any exercise? Let me explain…\nIf you’re not telling the Apple Watch that something you’re doing is to be counted as exercise, then the data is probably not being recorded in the way MyFitnessPal wants in order to see it as exercise. \nSo, to solve this, try using the Workout app on your Apple Watch the next time you’re doing exercise (even if it’s just a walk) and see if that is recognised as exercise in MyFitnessPal. If so, you should then get credited the calories for the exercise you’ve done.\nAs for the normal everyday steps you’re doing from walking around etc, while MyFitnessPal is showing you an indication of these, it’s probably not going to count any calories associated with these steps as it's already factored that into its calculations for how many calories you should be doing on each day. \nWhat I mean by this is that when you set MyFitnessPal up you would have entered your Activity Level from one of four choices: Not Very Active; Lightly Active; Active; and Very Active. So the app has already factored that into its calculations. On the other hand, when you actually do some exercise, this will be seen as over and above what it’s already calculated. \nIn a nutshell, using the Workout app on your Apple Watch should track the data that MyFitnessPal will except as ‘exercise’.\n", "Q: How do Icon? files work and how to create your own I recently noticed that in folders with special icons (eg. on the desktop) have a file in them named Icon?

Consider the scenario of restoring a backup taken on an HEIF/HEVC capable device (e.g. the iPhone 7 or newer) to an older device (e.g. an iPhone 6s, running iOS 11).\nWill images and videos taken on the new device and accessed on the old one be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Not restored at all?\n\n*Restored, but not displayable (i.e. taking up space, accessible for sharing/uploading etc., but not shown in the gallery)?\n\n*Be fully compatible, and displayed/decoded in software?\n\n\nIs there a difference between images and videos? (I could imagine that images are decoded in software on older devices, for example.)\n\nA: There wouldn't be a problem with that. The older iPhone would be able to convert the image back to a readable format.\nMore info here.\nEdit: This will be an issue if trying to view the videos on a mid-2014 MacBook Pro or older. There is ways around it, but only the 2015+ editions can automatically convert them.\nI have recently found this out while trying to view videos from my iPhone 8 on my mid-2014 MBP.\n", "Q: Songs show up as individual albums in iOS Music app I manually manage my iPhone's music (iOS 11.1). I use music from my hard drive, not from my iTunes account. When I drag music to my iPhone, all metadata of my music shows up in iTunes (iTunes 12.7.1.14) correctly. But on my iPhone, an album is broken into individual albums. So a 12-song album is turned into 12 1-song albums. This is the case 100% of the time. Every time that I add any album to my iPhone, every song will show up as separate albums.\nAlso, the artist is missing from every song on my iPhone.\nI am 100% sure that my metadata in iTunes is correct. Artist, Album, and Album Artist are all identical down to the capitalization and everything is correct on the Sorting tab. The Compilation box is not in play here. I have verified my song metadata with a 3rd-party ID3 editor.\nThe only thing that works is to delete the music from the iPhone and then re-add the music. When I re-add the music, the music now is grouped together and labeled correctly on my iPhone.\nCan I fix this issue without having to delete and re-add the music onto my iPhone every time?\n\nA: Have the same issue. I figured out that adding first song of albums and then rest of the songs works. But also looking for better resolution.\n\nA: Probably found solution which works.\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag MP3 files into your device ( iPhone or other ) in iTunes.\n\n*Open music app on device and see each song as separate album.\n\n*Go back to iTunes and remove that songs from device.\n\n*Then drag songs back to device.\n\n*Now open music app and see only one album with all songs.\n\n\nTested on mac with iTunes 12.7.2.60 and iPhone 7 plus with iOS 11.2.5 beta.\n\nA: It fails to sort by album when adding songs directly to the iPhone, but I've noticed that it works properly when first adding them all to the library and then moving them to the iPhone.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add albums from your local storage to iTunes library.\n\n*Add albums from your iTunes library to your iPhone.\n\n*Songs are now sorted properly by album on your iPhone.\n\n\nA: You may have to individually tag those files in iTunes so that it wont show those songs as if they are albums.\n\nA: have had the same issue for some time, and has nothing to do with tags. like you, my music is all on an external. \ni've long since stopped using itunes, in favour of swinsian. much easier to use, sounds better, only apple won't allow non itunes adding of music. \ni used to open itunes, drag n drop to the phone icon, and all was good to go. not sure if it was ios 11 or some other update ... but now the songs are required to be in itunes first, from which you can drag onto the phone icon.\nso you are unable to drag music to the phone from a folder in the finder window. you must add to the itunes library first, and then drag over. hopefully this helps!\n\nA: I found a fix....

If you want to be certain before ordering a replacement battery or having it repaired, use a battery utility, such as coconutBattery (for Mac) or 3uTools (for Windows). It will tell you what the health of the battery is (Design Capacity).

It could be that socket or it could be the entire structure (at a minimum).  Also I would get an electrical socket tester and verify your wiring.  If anything is at fault, you run the risk of damaging your equipment to injury or death.\nYour best bet is to get an electrician to come in and properly ground your electrical system.\nShort of that, I would get a UPS (battery backup) and isolate your iMac from the outlet - this will at least give you a little bit of protection, though it won't do a single thing to protect your iMac in the event of a fault (and this is where it will get expensive).  \n", "Q: How can I make SwiftKey keyboard show up when replying to messages in lock screen?

It is only meant to\n  be installed on the macbook air. It seems like apple by mistake\n  included it on the Mac mini install DVD's.\n\nConfirmed by Apple (sort of):\n\nIf your Mac already has a built-in optical drive, or an external\n  optical drive connected, you won't see the Remote Disc feature appear\n  in the Finder or other apps.\n\nSince the first article mentions it appeared in 10.5.6 (or earlier), it seems odd that something Apple has called a bug would still be in 10.13.1.\nI know how to remove and re-create it, and it could be useful if my optical drive fails.  But I know several other ways of using remote discs.\nIs there any value to this if I do have a working optical drive?\n\nA: Well, if your Mac Mini is in a cabinet or otherwise not easily accessible, you could use another Mac's optical drive and access it on the Mini, but otherwise, I can't think of any.

Specifically, boot holding down the COMMAND KEY ( has the apple icon ) and V, to boot in verbose mode.  Then let the boot up fail where it might, and reboot in safe mode by holding down the SHIFT KEY.\nProceed by logging in, and then examine the startup logs — depending on your command line skills or lack thereof — via Terminal or the Console app which reside in /Applications/Utilities.  You might start with /var/log/system.log.  \nAs Gio correctly stated — often the trouble at boot up is caused by a kernel extension loading or the lack thereof.  \nLet us know if you are able to boot in safe mode, and what you find in the logs.\nRegards,\nF.\n", "Q: mac pc setup using two external monitors I have MacBook Pro late 2013 and PC with Windows 10.

It shows the spinning icon as if it was about to respring but turns off and the battery is dead.\nWhen I plug it in a power source, however, within a few minutes, it goes back to the battery percentage of before dying.\nWhy is my iPhone doing this?\n\nA: Having a trained repair person put a working battery in the device would let you know if the failure is simply due to battery / voltage or another hardware fault. Hard to tell without testing and doing the work, though.\nVoltage drops is what causes the unexpected power off so corrosion or a faulty device that over draws the current that can be supplied can cause this. Also, perfectly working electronics won’t work if the battery is failing / failed.\nApple service diagnostic can usually tell if the battery is healthy, but I don’t know if they offer that service on this old of equipment anymore.\n", "Q: how to make default torrent handler (.torrent files and magnet links) a certain Transmission Remote GUI URL? I've installed a Transmission daemon on one of my Macs.  I'd like to have all torrents and magnet links I open on my other Macs to be opened by the program at that-macs-url:9091 via Transmission Remote GUI.  How can I make this happen?\n\nA: *\n\n*Install https://github.com/transmission-remote-gui/transgui on every mac.\n\n*Launch it and input Remote host: that-macs-url, Port: 9091. I found out the hard way that a .local (mDNS) hostname will not work on macOS, due to bugs.\n\n*It's up to the application what happens when you click on a magnet link. In Safari nothing seems to happen for me for some reason*, but in Firefox I get the option to browse for an app. For torrent files my best bet would be to right click a torrent file → Show Info → Open with: and change all to open in transgui.\n\nDisable prompting for download options in transgui, and use transgui as the default app in your browser to quickly send torrents immediately to your server with a single click and zero context switching. Update: seems that I lost the feature of zero context switching at some point (transgui 5.16.0 on macOS 10.14.4). Transgui now always steals focus when opening magnet links.\n* I believe magnet:-links aren't strictly valid URIs.\n", "Q: 'iCloud Drive' missing from Finder (link broken?) in OS X El Cap I'm using Mac OS X El Capitan (10.11.6) on a Mid 2011 Mac Mini.  \nMy 'link' to iCloud Drive in Finder is missing or broken.

It is relatively difficult to uninstall because somehow it seems to come back and haunt you. More details at https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/discussions/28321/script-to-remove-carbon-black-protection-from-active-computer\n\nA: First thing I would determine is the CONTEXT the process is being launched in — either your user or system (root).  Pull up a user shell by launching Terminal.   \nlaunchctl list | grep -i confer \n\nAssuming the running process’ name is Confer, this should determine if it is being launched under user context.  If no output, then we need to look at the system context.\nsudo -s \n\nType your password to initiate a root shell.  \nlaunchctl list | grep -i Confer\n\nIf no output, then let me know — we’ll have to look at legacy startup items and verify that there is no kernel extension component.  We will also need to check the verboten directories used by launchd in /System for a renegade install.  \nWe will then hunt down the location of the file which causes Confer to launch, and then remove it from bootstrapped items and from user items launched at login.  If you wish to really remove this thing properly, then we will employ the package utility to delete every darned file that it might have reported to the installer via a package receipt.\nYou can see a list of files confer is using while it is running by:\nopensnoop -n Confer\n\nOr \nlsof | grep -i confer\n\nLemme know how that all works,\nF.\n\nA: I was able to uninstall the Confer app from safe mode. That's the good new I want to share first. \nComing to the app, not sure what exactly it does. Tried opening it and there was no response. Checked on google and learnt it was an app to record all our activities on screen not sure it may have captured from our camera too :( I was really concerned of this app and started to dig. Not too much time it took to uninstall the app. I checked on this website and the way of deleting was too much technical. I am not much familiar with Linux/AiX commands much of windows guy so I contacted the apple support. They gave few suggestions by killing the app from activity monitor and moving the app to trash but nothing worked. Then they suggested to restart in safe mode and follow the same process. Bingoooo, it worked. \nAdditionally I had Appcleaner app which cleared all the associated files along with it. So if you want to uninstall the app in a quicker way then go to safe mode, kill the process from activity monitor and move the app to appcleaner app and it will do the rest. Hope I was useful :) \n", "Q: Panic Medic Boot Appearing on Mac Since yesterday, my Macbook Pro early 2013 running macOS High Sierra 10.13.1 beta has been randomly shutting down. After shutting down, it would take several tries for it to boot up and login, but then it displays this error message every time I login (see picture attached). I already tried resetting both PRAM and SMC, but the problem still occurs. Booting into safe mode wouldn't work when I pressed shift after the boot chime sound came (safe mode worked before this problem). Is there a way to fix this?\n\n\nA: If a safe mode boot fails, you've got a damaged system.\nBoot to recovery, internet recovery or external bootable media and reinstall the OS on top of all your existing apps and data. This preserves all data that's there.\nIf you suspect storage drive problems, you might check your last backup against another Mac to be sure it's up to date and restorable and possibly seek data recovery if you can't afford to lose the data before reinstalling the macOS.\nI wouldn't do data recovery unless you have no backups and $300 or so for a professional service would be money well spent to safeguard your data. Most people recover from this with no data loss in about an hour or two after the reinstall starts,  but I don't want you to not have the chance to back up before using the drive more if you suspect problems with the hardware and not just a third party extension causing lots of crashes.\n", "Q: AppleScript runs, but does not seem to work I have an excel workbook open, with old file names in column A and new file names in column B. I am attempting to use the applescript below to rename my files. It runs without errors, but doesn't rename the files. Am I missing something? Any help is much appreciated.\nset theDirectory to \"/Users/admin/Desktop/test/copied images\"\ntell application \"Microsoft Excel\"\n    tell active sheet\n        tell used range\n            set rc to count of rows\n        end tell\n        set theList to get value of range (\"A1:B\" & rc) as list\n        repeat with theItem in theList\n            try\n                do shell script \"mv \" & theDirectory & \"/\" & quoted form of item 1 of     theItem & space & theDirectory & \"/\" & quoted form of item 2 of theItem\n            end try\n        end repeat\n    end tell\nend tell\n\n\nA: Why your script seems to run without errors\nYour script runs without errors because it swallows any error that may occur in the do shell script line.\nTemporarily remove the surrounding try and end try lines to un-mute the errors. This will likely lead to an error message that ends with No such file or directory.\nWhy your script does not rename files\nThe issue is that your script hands the value of theDirectory directly to the shell command without quoting it. Because that value contains spaces, the shell interprets the directory &[…]theItem part as two separate arguments, which causes mv to fail.\nSolution\nIn the do shell script line, replace both occurrences of\n\ntheDirectory\n\nwith:\n\nquoted form of theDirectory\n\n(Optional) Making your script more robust\nAdditionally, I suggest that you either lose the surrounding try/end try altogether, or alternatively insert an on error statement to handle possible errors that can occur in the do shell script part.\nWriting scripts that don’t swallow errors means you’ll save time in the long run.\n", "Q: High Sierra: Converted to APFS and Finder not updating available capacity I'm running OS 10.13.1 and I did a fresh install of High Sierra and imported my files, apps, etc via the migration assistant. I have an original Apple SSD installed.\nSince installing, the available capacity in the Finder is delayed in updating and inconsistent. Updating available space can take hours, days, or require a restart.\nCurrently the finder says I have 127.09GB (out of 500GB) available.\nDisk Utility has 123.03 available.\n\"About This Mac\" shows 93.67GB available.\nSystem Information shows 79.4GB available.\nAnyone else having these kinds of issues and is there a way to get available space to 1) be accurate and 2) update instantly?\n\nA: Since you asked if anyone else is having these kinds of issues, yes, I can share that almost a year later, on the current version of High Sierra, this is still a bug. You basically can't trust the available space number now. I'll leave open the possibility that someone has a workaround.\nIn my case, we moved 20GB of files off the boot drive and deleted another 10GB (emptying the trash immediately). The free space number didn't change (other than to actually decrease slightly. I fiddled with checking various things – Finder Get Info on the disk, also had the false number. Finally as I was staring at the number at the bottom of the Finder window (the status bar) it snapped from 47GB to 77GB before my eyes.\nI'll avoid giving my honest advice for how to get this basic feature working since it would not technically be an Apple-related answer so it might be ruled as off-topic.\n", "Q: Can't go fullscreen in any app For several weeks, I haven't been able to go full-screen in any app on my laptop.  I thought it was a Chrome problem with YouTube, because when I hit the full-screen button in a movie (bottom-right corner of the movie) it will expand to fill the browser window, but not the whole screen.  Then to restore, hitting Escape or the exit-full-screen button doesn't get the video to reduce down again.  Reloading the browser page works, though.\nHowever, it's not just a browser problem - I recently discovered that no apps (e.g. Finder, Photos, Terminal, Console) can go full-screen by clicking on the circular green button on the left side of their window bars.\nOn a random cargo-cult recommendation I saw here, I trashed my ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist file & restarted the Finder, but no differences are observed.\nWhen I hit the green maximize button in a Finder window, it seems to crash that window - I can no longer drag that window around & it doesn't respond to any clicks.  Other Finder windows stay fine.\nTo try to debug, I've poked around in various system logs, but I haven't found anything that looks relevant.  Maybe something to do with the WindowServer?\nI'm on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014), running Sierra 10.12.5.\n\nA: Tried a couple more things, and here's what worked: kill the Dock, then get it to restart.  I did this by doing killall Dock in the Terminal.  It didn't restart by itself, so e.g. Cmd-Tab didn't work to switch applications, my desktop had no background, and (of course) there was no Dock.\nI launched the Dock again by going into System Preferences & clicking on the Dock pane.\nWhy did I try killing the Dock?  Because I also noticed that Exposé/Mission Control wasn't working either.  Some searching led me to this question, which suggested restarting the Dock.\n", "Q: Is macOS known to completely crash due to a bad boot drive? I've got a mid-2013 11\" MacBook Air that I fixed up.\nIt had no SSD when I got it but I've been running it off an external USB 3 hard drive fine for about a year and a half including backpacking around the world for a year.\nBut in the last few weeks the whole OS has been prone to crashing. Sometimes after a couple of days uptime, sometimes after only a short time.\nI'm trying to narrow it down to a bad motherboard or bad hard drive.\nNormally I wouldn't expect a bad hard drive to crash the whole system but just report various errors and warnings from the OS. Or if it were to cause a crash I would expect the OS to detect it most of the time and display some kind of dialog on the screen before restarting.\nOften though it seems to crash when I'm moving the computer or the external drive or touch the cable. Most of the time moving it does not cause a crash though.\nI have tried both USB ports so I can rule out damaged ports. It could be something to do with the cable or the drive though.\nBut if anyone can tell me for 100% sure that a bad hard drive or cable is ever known to crash the whole OS I can try to find another drive to test.\nLikewise if anyone can tell me for 100% that a bad hard drive can never crash the whole OS I can focus my attention elsewhere.\nExtra info:\nOnce or twice after a crash it restarted with the flashing folder icon but started up fine next time. I never got any errors about the hard drive from the OS or any app. Checking the drive with the OS tools finds no errors. The drive has both Mac and Windows partitions and I've tested on both OSes. I haven't yet seen any problem using the drive on my Windows laptop but I mostly use the Mac now.\nThe only causal factor I can think of is that one day I put the Mac in my backpack with the external drive still attached. The Mac will sleep but not hibernate due to the OS design. I was jogging for an hour or two and when I opened my backpack the drive cable was no longer plugged in. Plugging or unplugging a USB device wakes a sleeping Mac and waking the Mac will cause the hard drive to start. Bumping or shaking a running hard drive can damage it. None of this should've had any effect on the rest of the Mac hardware I can think of.\n\nA: It's not really clear what you mean by completely crash or crash the whole OS, but yes a bad hard drive can cause a crash/freeze.\nIn your case there's a few things you can still try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try a new cable\n\n*Reset the NVRAM\n\n*Try booting into Safe Mode\n\n\nObviously I don't need to explain how to try a new cable, so I've included steps below for resting the NVRAM and booting into Safe Mode.\nResetting the NVRAM\nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your machine. Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out.\n\n*Press the power button and then press the commandoptionpr keys. You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work.\n\n*Hold those keys down until your Mac reboots again (i.e. a 2nd time) and you here the startup chime.\n\n*Let go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally.\n\n\nNote: When you log back in you may need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. could you boot your Mac okay, does it still crash?)\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal\n\n*Test your Mac again to see if it still crashes\n\n\nOnce you've booted into Safe Mode, let me know how you went and we'll go from there.\nIf by any chance you find your Mac doesn't crash while in Safe Mode, but it does crash when booted normally again, then we know the problem is basically software related and we can troubleshoot that further.\n\nA: Your internal hard drive is likely failing.\nThe Disk Utility will not reveal a failing hard drive, S.M.A.R.T. does that.\nDriveDx is a great tool to check S.M.A.R.T. status of your drive.\n(https://binaryfruit.com/)\nI would advise to backup your data as soon as you can.\n", "Q: How To Get Notes On Windows 10? I switched from my Mac to a PC that runs Windows 10 and have all my notes from the notes app on my Mac. How can I get all my notes? Thanks!\n\nA: If you mean the native Notes App, you can access your notes on icloud.com, unless you don't have them backed up. Then you have to log in. If you have two-factor authentication turned on, you'll have to use another Apple device you own.\nIf you've successfully logged in, you now should be able to access your notes from the \"Notes\" app on the website.\n\nA: If you have your notes synced via iCloud then you can access them using a browser at iCloud.com. \nIf your notes aren't synced via iCloud, then your options involve having to use your Mac to move them. Some options include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use your Mac to sync the notes via iCloud, and then access iCloud from your PC to view/edit your notes, or to copy them into one of the apps on your PC.\n\n*Use your Mac to copy/paste each of your notes into a separate file (e.g. using TextEdit or another text editor) and then saving them to a drive or an online service such as Dropbox and transferring/accessing them from your PC.\n\n*Use your Mac to share each of your notes via email and email them to yourself for accessing via your PC and then copying/pasting them into WordPad or whatever app you want to use\n\n\nAlso, you may be interested to know that you can also install iCloud for Windows:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is iCloud for Windows?\n\n*Download iCloud for Windows\n\n*Set up and use iCloud for Windows\n\nA: I just installed iCloud for Windows on Surface Pro and even though all the apps show up listed in the Windows Explorer iCloud app, Notes launches a browser with icloud.com in the address. It seems we aren't there yet for having a native running app for Notes. \n", "Q: Equivalent of Linux \"service\" command on Mac OS to stop a running process/service I want to stop a running driver on Mac OS then overwrite it with another version then restart. The files are overwritten to the same location.\nWhen I overwrite and reboot the new driver starts as expected, but I would like to be able to do this without the reboot. When I use \"ps -9\" to kill the processes they start up again. Is there a command similar to Linux \"service\" to control such processes?\n\nA: Just need some clarification on your question. How do you know this is a driver?\nProcess control is typically achieved with some variation of the launchctl command:\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-hk/guide/terminal/script-management-with-launchd-apdc6c1077b-5d5d-4d35-9c19-60f2397b2369/mac\nThe above link is pretty good at detailing the service list. Let me know if that helps.\nDriver control is a bit different. The driver equivalent on macOS is a kernel extension (kext). Are you able to try the following?\n# get root access\nsudo bash -\n# Attempt to unload kext\nkextload | grep -i DRIVER_NAME\n\n*if found*\nkextunload DRIVER_NAME\n\nThis should unload the driver. You can then force replace it in /System/Library/Extensions or whatever directory it resides in. Then do the following:\n# fix permissions\nsudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/name.kext\nsudo chown -R root:wheel /path/to/name.kext\n\n# Attempt to load driver\nkextload -v DRIVER_NAME\n\nSome more information would be key, but this is the general procedure I would follow. \nPROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!!\n", "Q: Restart AFP service in High Sierra I would like to restart the AFP service but I'm not sure how to do it anymore. In previous versions of OS X I would run serveradmin stop afp and serveradmin start afp, but serveradmin is no longer available in High Sierra.\n\nA: serveradmin is still available in macOS High Sierra.

I've cracked my new MacBook screen. A single staple that was lodged between hinges (not dropped damage). The screen is cracked and it wont display anything comprehensible. I've scoured the Internet looking for pricing ranges, from Apple Support to DIY screen replacement, no luck at all. \nI don't have AppleCare+. Just purchased it last month from Best Buy. Any advice would help regarding my options for me to save some money. \nSpecs: 13 inch, I5, 120GB storage, no touch bar. Priced around $1200.\n\n\nA: The Apple price depends how the repair is done. If you pay part by part or if you get tiered pricing. \nCall or engage Apple support and they can quote you the pricing estimates for sure no matter where you are in the world. The last time I checked, tier 2 covered the display assembly and all parts and testing needed to return it to full warranty status. \nYou could even then get AppleCare and possible AppleCare+ once you’ve paid for the repairs. \nCheck your insurance to see if they will cover some of the costs - most have a higher deductable than the cost of a new Mac, but it’s worth checking. \nLast time I sent in two damaged screens, the tier 2 costs in the us was about $750 for a 15 inch and $495 for smaller sized MacBook and Pro. This included all parts, labor, shipping and testing and they send a box to you so I didn’t need to deliver it or pick it up at any center. \n", "Q: Why can Perspective Warp cause my Mac to run out of application memory? I'm running Adobe Photoshop CC on a Mac with 32GB RAM. I have no performance issues other than Perspective Warp. Sometimes it works immediately, sometimes after a few seconds (while I wait for the revolving rainbow wheel to stop spinning) but it seems to take longer each time I use it within a session - eventually generating an 'out of application memory' message and freezing Photoshop. Restarting the Mac usually resets the function.\nCan anyone help, please? \n\nA: You don’t actually specify what model of Mac you have, nor what you mean by within a session. \nHowever, the perspective warp function is a rather CPU and GPU intensive task. How long it takes will depend on a number of factors, such as the complexity and size of the files you’re working with, the amount of VRAM your GPU has access to, and so on.\nAlso, if you’re trying to use the perspective warp function repeatedly during relatively short periods of time, you may find that your system starts heating up beyond acceptable limits and the CPU and/or GPU become throttled in order to protect them from damage.\nFinally, while you do seem to have a good amount of RAM (32GB is nothing to be sneezed at), the perspective warp feature is actually more demanding of the GPU and the amount of VRAM it has access to. So you may find that’s the cause of your memory issues, especially if you’re using perspective warp repeatedly within short periods.\n\nA: Tuning Photoshop to cover all the possibilities would take most of a one semester course for Mac, but you might be able to make great progress by watching your efficiency in the app before and during the operation you see causing a slow down. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/kb/optimize-photoshop-cc-performance.html\nDon’t try to change lots of things in the article all at once, instead make one or two changes and then test / document your results. Since you mention that it gets slower and slower over time, focus on the history state controls and the part that talks about purge. \nStart with giving Photoshop 1/4 of total RAM up to 6 GB max (if all you ever really want to do is photoshop) and then watch efficiency per window. If you see efficiency go down, experiment with bumping up the RAM reservation as needed. Saving RAM for the macOS usually is a winning decision - so take photoshop down to 1  GB if you can based on efficiency of your documents remaining high. \nMost times when I find Photoshop slow is due to someone giving all / too much RAM to this one app, starving everything else on the Mac access to that resource. \n\nA: Thank you both for your really helpful and timely responses. Together, you have helped me to find a solution. I worked through the Adobe help page link that Bmike gave me and eventually came to a section called 'Purge memory', giving me the path in Photoshop CC: Edit>Purge. This selection produced a pop-up menu, the last option being 'Video Cache. Noting Monomeeth's point about VRAM, I click on Video Cache. Problem solved - no more delays! Fantastic!\n", "Q: Remove macOS and Install Windows 10 Only How do I remove macOS completely from my MacBook Air 2015 and install Windows 10 only after?\nI have tried formatting my drive to GPT and tried booting a Windows Installation USB however I'm stuck at the installer not being able to find any drives.\n\nA: Download the Boot Camp drivers to a pen-drive, format the device using the Windows installer before installing. Run the bootcamp.exe once Windows is up and you'll have all the drivers you'll ever need. Make sure you get the right drivers for your device.\n\nA: Most people are going to assume that you are going the boot camp route. However, have you tried a fully UEFI Windows 10 install? Your update does not detail very much so it is important to possibly include pics since command line output will be limited preinstall. This is also treading along as unsupported but if you want to get your hands dirty it is an EXTREMELY good learning experience. \nI've managed to do this quite a few times (albeit keeping macOS without boot camp). Here is a rough outline of what you need to do:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Make sure your disk is labelled GPT. GPT is a disklabel not a formatting type. I believe you have done this, so it should be ok.\n  \n*Create a USB install of Windows 10 that is UEFI compatible. \n  \n*Insert the USB drive and hold down option. The bootloader should detect a Windows USB disk. Be sure to select the USB as the boot\n  medium.\n  \n*This step is highly dependent on what happens next. If your macbook does not boot into the windows install screen, then you need to figure\n  out why it can't load. Any errors would be helpful. \nIf you are able to get into the Windows install prompt, then you may\n  run into issues with the installer detecting the hard drive. You may\n  need to have a windows equivalent driver that you load via the\n  installer to ensure your hardware is supported. Again it is dependent\n  on what you see.\n\n  \n*Select the disk available. Format the drive/create partitions, allow install to finish.\n  \n*Reboot and let the installer finish the windows install.\n  \n*Install all boot camp drivers manually.\n\nLots of info is available. Most people will tell you to go the boot camp route, but I've found that the UEFI method results in MUCH quicker boot time. Let me know if you need anything.\n\nA: You must first use bootcamp with osx to create the partition. Once the partition is made and windows is working, then you can delete osx and allocate the memory to windows. You can see in the image below that only 200 is needed by the internal mac os (to boot the mac and so forth). Other than that, my bootcamp is the only os on the disk. Now I don't know what you'd do without a recovery partition if you wanted osx back for whatever reason. I don't see any reason to do so because having one os is much better than 2.\n\n\nA: I've just succeeded in replacing OS X with Windows 10 on a late 2018 MacBook Pro with the touch bar.\nNOTE: you'll need an external USB keyboard (and perhaps mouse) because MacBook's ones won't work before you install the drivers. Steps to follow:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Boot Camp application on OS X and download the Boot Camp Support Software, i.e. a package containing all the Windows drivers you'll need to install and smoothly run Windows 10. You can download that package via the Action menu entry in the Boot Camp application.\n\n*Copy the content of the package to the root of a FAT32 USB pen (a 8GB pen will do the job).\n\n*Create a bootable USB Windows installer. I made it on another Windows 10 machine, but I guess it's possible to make it on OS X too.\n\n*Insert the Windows installer USB pen and reboot the MacBook Pro. Hold down the Option key until a boot menu appears. Boot from the Windows installer.\n\n*Chose the Custom installation. You'll be asked to chose the drive where to install Windows to, but you probably won't see any storage device. Hence, insert the Boot Camp drivers USB pen and press Load drivers. There, you can browse the pen and select the Apple SSD driver (I don't remember what is the exact folder you have to select, but it's not hard to find out).\n\n*Once the driver is installed, you can finally see your hard drive partitions. I deleted the OS X partition and created a new NTFS one.\n\n*Complete the installation. Once Windows is booted, run the setup.exe executable in the Boot Camp USB pen. That will install all the needed drivers (network, keyboard and touch-pad, ...).\n\n*Enjoy.\n\nA: This answer is a modified version of my answer to a different question. It assumes you already have macOS installed and have a Windows ISO in hand.\n\nBefore continuing, make sure that you have a backup of your data! I am not responsible for any damage caused by this guide. You have been warned.\n\nYou need a USB formatted as FAT32 with at least 8 GBs of free space... Skip to step 2 if you already have an installation media.\nStep 1: Download and install unetbootin from here. Then run it and select Disk Image option on the screen. Select ISO option from the dropdown menu next to Disk Image text if it is not already selected. Then press the button with three dots (...) and select your Windows ISO image (assuming you already have one). Lastly, select your USB from the dropdown menu next to Drive text and press OK. This will burn the ISO image to the USB.\nStep 1.1: To learn what your USB is called, open up a Terminal from Spotlight and type:\ndiskutil list\n\nThis will show you all of the drives connected to your computer. Your USB is something like /dev/disk1s1 or /dev/disk1s2 (but definitely not /dev/disk0). You can understand which one is your USB by searching for your USB's label.\nStep 2: Now open up the Bootcamp assistant for the last time. Once it's opened, select Action > Download Windows Helper Software. This will download Bootcamp helper. Select the target as your desktop and continue.\nStep 3: Once your bootcamp software is downloaded and unetbootin is done, copy the WindowsSupport folder to your USB's root directory.\nStep 4: It's time to begin the installation! Reboot your MacBook and when it's powering on, press and hold Alt (option) key on your keyboard. Once boot manager appears, select the EFI Boot or Windows option. This will start the installer. Give it a few minutes and once the button to begin the installation appears, press it. Wait for it to start. Once it starts, select Custom installation option. This part is important!!! A list of volumes should have appeared now.\nStep 4.1: This will destroy any data on your other volumes! Delete all of your partitions one by one. Once there is only free space left, create a new partition and install Windows on there.\nStep 4.2: Wait for the installation to finish.\nStep 4.3: Once the computer restarts, hold the alt key and select Windows or EFI Boot option with a hard drive icon.\nStep 5: Once you fully setup Windows, select your USB from Windows Explorer and go to WindowsSupport folder. In that folder, run the setup program. Install it like a normal program and you are done!\n\nA: The way I did it was to do everything with bootcamp:\n\n\n*\n\n*Once booted into the windows install screen press FN-SHIFT-F10. This will open CMD.\n\n*Once CMD is open,  type diskpart into the console. This will send you to the disc command section.\n\n*Then type in list. This will show a list of disks ready to install on.\n\n*Now type in select disk 0 (Disk 0 is where Macintosh HD is stored.) \n\n*Next, type clean.  It will get rid of Macintosh HD, making it ready for the windows install.\n\n*You can exit CMD and continue with the install.\n\n\n(Note: if the install restarts and goes back to the first step of the install, you will have to type these commands in again. This happened to me, but I doubt it will restart back 3 times.)\n", "Q: Replacement for obselete OpenDNS Umbrella App on iPhone I have been a Prosumer OpenDNS Umbrella customer for years, but their App isn't being upgraded to 64-bit, so it won't work with iOS 11. It provides Umbrella's protections and also allows filtering by category of all internet traffic to/from an iPhone. This has saved me multiple times when I've mistyped web addresses and it reassures me that my child won't as likely stumble across inappropriate content.\nIs there another similar product to OpenDNS's prosumer Umbrella for iPhones? I've searched online and keep coming across OpenDNS Umbrella or simple VPNs that don't have the same filtering capabilities or that go overboard (in my opinion) requiring jailbreaking the iPhone so that it can \"spy\" on all of your users' iPhone activity for you. \nSimply blocking adult content in Safari is possible (as suggested here, go to Settings->General->Restrictions->Allowed Content->Limit Adult Content. But that only automatically blocks one category and doesn't necessarily block malicious sites and so many other features I like about OpenDNS Umbrella.\nI'm not a company, so I don't think I can use Cisco's other VPN commercial products to do the same thing. And if I could, it would cost a minimum of $380/year for a minimum of 10 users. Prosumer OpenDNS Umbrella has been only $20/year per user who can put it on up to 3 mobile devices.\ncross posted on Software Recommendations\n\nA: I’m using DNS Override and it is working well.\nWith it, you can choose one DNS provider for all WiFi networks your phone connects to as well as for cellular data. It is supposed to be compatible with services that allow you to block web content by category.\n", "Q: Sharing between Macintosh and Windows I have a Mac Pro and a Windows computer. They are on the same internal network (my home network). The local IP address of this Windows computer is 10.0.0.9 and its name is blender (I use this computer to run blender jobs). When I run ipconfig on this Windows computer it is confirmed that the local IP address of this computer is 10.0.1.9\nI use this Blender computer only for running Blender jobs. Therefore the Deadline application is used. I have a Deadline slave on the Mac Pro and a Deadline slave on the Blender machine. The Deadline repository and database is on the Blender machine. This used to be Deadline 8 and everything worked just fine. Recently I installed a lot of software updates and also updated to Deadline 10. \nAnd now suddenly I have this problem that the Deadline Monitor on my Mac Pro cannot access the Deadline database on the Blender machine. \n\nAn error occurred while trying to connect to the Database\n  (Blender:27100,10.0.1.9:27100). It is possible that the Mongo Database\n  server is incorrectly configured, currently offline, blocked by a\n  firewall, or experiencing network issues.\n\nAlso when I try to ping this blender machine (10.0.1.9) using the command ping blender the terminal response is ping: cannot resolve blender: Unknown host and also ping 10.0.1.9 does not work.\nThe C: drive of this Windows computer is shared with my Mac Pro. On my Mac Pro the blender machine is in the \"Shared\" list and I can see all the folders and the files of the Windows C: drive on my Mac computer. \n\nAs you can see the Blender machine is shared to the Mac Pro and on the Mac Pro I can see and access the Deadline folders. This is important because I use this Blender computer only for running Blender jobs. \nSomehow the sharing between the Windows machine and the Mac is not working, but I don't know why.\nI did run brew install mongodb (I hope I installed everything correctly) and I got this when run mongo\n\nBy the way, when I submit a Blender on my Blender machine Deadline executes the job without a problem and also the Monitor has no problems. So it seems that somehow I have a connection problem between my Mac and Windows machine (and it used to work fine).  \nI hope this helps. I am not a very technical person and I hope you can give me some detailed instructions on how to solve this problem or how to analyse this problem.\nTrying to follow up with this mongodb I did run mongo 10.0.19:27100\n\nI also have set the firewall OFF and then had another run \n\n\nA: Your error is pointing you correctly to look at firewall and networking.\nThis should be fairly easy to narrow down with some facts:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you don't have DNS - use IP addresses for all testing - fix the Mac and PC to specific IP\n\n*Ping works from Mac very reliably - you can use the network utility to ping by IP or host name.\n\n*Network Utility will also be useful to port scan the PC. You should be able to tell if the windows firewall is blocking your access \n\n\nMy hunch since I run mongodb all the time on Mac and PC is your firewall would be likely blocking access. The only issues I never have is wrong IP, wrong port, firewall blocking, mongo configuration.\nIf you are comfortable on the command line - get mongodb on the Mac from https://brew.sh and then run brew install mongodb so you can connect from the command line and see explicit details on what errors happen.\n$ mongo\nMongoDB shell version v3.4.10\nconnecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017\n2017-11-22T07:10:38.494-0600 W NETWORK  [thread1] Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1:27017, in(checking socket for error after poll), reason: Connection refused\n2017-11-22T07:10:38.501-0600 E QUERY    [thread1] Error: couldn't connect to server 127.0.0.1:27017, connection attempt failed :\nconnect@src/mongo/shell/mongo.js:237:13\n@(connect):1:6\nexception: connect failed\n\nSo in your case, use the command line mongo to attempt a connection to your server at 10.0.1.9:27100\n", "Q: security cms for S/MIME?

I found that Xcode on my laptop consumes much of its storage, so I am trying to delete unnecessary files in Xcode.\nThere are four directories under Application/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/. I feel that WatchSimulator.platform and AppleTVSimulator.platform are not necessary, because I use Xcode almost only for basic iOS development.\nI would like to know if I can delete those platforms directories directly?\n\n\nA: Xcode now shares the simulators with all users. So, you need to remove the simulators from the following folder:\n/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes\n\nFor example:\ncd /Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes\nsudo rm -rf iOS\\ 8.4.simruntime/\nsudo rm -rf iOS\\ 9.3.simruntime/\n\nCheers!\n\nA: You can easily remove all unavailable simulators with this command in the terminal:\nxcrun simctl delete unavailable\n\n\nA: Where Xcode stores simulators in 2019+ Catalina, Xcode 11.0\nRuntimes\n$ open /Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes\nFor example: iOS 13.0, watchOS 6.0 These take the most space, by far. Each one can be up to ~5GB\nDevices\n$ open ~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices\nFor example: iPhone Xr, iPhone 11 Pro Max. These are typically <15 mb each.\nExplanation\nSimulators are split between runtimes and devices. If you run $ xcrun simctl list you can see an overview, but if you want to find the physical location of these simulators, look in these directories I've shown.\nIt's totally safe to delete runtimes you don't support. You can reinstall these later if you want.\n\nA: To delete simulators by iOS version:\nIf you only want to remove simulators for a specific version, and you happen to have fastlane installed, you can launch an interactive ruby shell and run the following commands to remove all iOS 10 simulators:\n# launch the interactive ruby shell (irb)\n$ irb\n\n# require the device manager capabilities of fastlane core\nirb(main):001:0> require 'fastlane_core/device_manager'\n\n# delete all iOS 10 simulators\nirb(main):002:0> FastlaneCore::Simulator.delete_all_by_version(os_version: \"10.0\")\n\n\nA: Despite @fsb's answer allows to delete simulator \"instances\" the right way to free a massive space used by old simulator platforms not needed anymore is going to the following folder:\n~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS DeviceSupport\n\nand remove the folders corresponding to the simulator/platforms you don't need anymore.\nAdditionally, there is a very good article including this and other tips:\n\n*\n\n*Xcode users can free up space on your Mac\n\n*How to make Xcode take up less space\n\nA: *\n\n*to list all simulator devices xcrun simctl list devices or xcrun simctl list --json\n\n\n*to delete all simulator devices xcrun simctl delete all\n\n\n*to delete a specific device xcrun simctl delete <device udid>\n\n\n*to remove old devices for runtimes that are no longer supported xcrun simctl delete unavailable\n\nA: Yes, you can delete any simulator that you don't use.  I do this routinely when I stop supporting older iOS versions.\nIf you delete them and then you find that you need them at some point in the future, you can redownload them from Apple's developer site.\nThe best way to delete them is in Xcode.  Go to Window -> Devices and Simulators.  This will open a new window with all the devices you use in Xcode.\nAt the top, tap on Simulators and you'll see a list on the left-side.\nFrom there, find the simulator you want to delete and Cntl - click (or right-click) and select Delete.\nI do this with each simulator that runs in each iOS version that I no longer support.\nUpdate July 2020: There's a free utility in the Mac App Store named DevCleaner for Xcode.  This application can display and delete simulators and various caches.  I've found it be a very quick and easy way to regain space.  I'm not the developer or associated with this application in any way.\n\nA: In newer versions of macOS (e.g. macOS 13 - Ventura), you can clean up a lot of Xcode and Device Support files via \"System Settings\" (Preferences).\n\n*\n\n*Click \"System Settings...\" from the Apple menu in the top-left corner.\n\n*Select \"General\"\n\n*Select \"Storage\"\n\n*Click the (i) next to \"Developer\"\n\n*Select the rows (iOS Device Support versions, Xcode Caches, etc.) you don't need\n\n*Click \"Delete\"\n\nI was able to free up a lot more space using this Settings page. Just before I did this, I had run @beryllium's answer (i.e. \"xcrun simctl delete unavailable\" in Terminal), which also cleaned up a lot of disk space, so I'm not sure if the Settings page would have cleaned up those files too. To be sure, I'd recommend also running \"xcrun simctl delete unavailable\" in the terminal, after the steps above, to see if it frees up more.\nFor reference, I was able to clean up another 53 GB using the Storage settings page, after I had already cleaned up all the unneeded files under ~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices using xcrun.\n\nA: Beside the regular simulator devices in the known location (~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/), Xcode now creates automatically simulator devices \"behind your back\" for SwiftUI previews, Interface Builder, Playgrounds and Parallel Testing.\nThey also might take up some space after a while.\nSo it might be useful to delete them all using the commands below:\nxcrun simctl --set playgrounds delete all\nxcrun simctl --set previews delete all\nxcrun simctl --set interfacebuilder delete all\nxcrun simctl --set testing delete all\n\n\nA: Most of the disk space is used by just one subfolder under each *.platform folder inside Xcode.app, Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes (so eg /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/AppleTVOS.platform/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes).\nIf you just delete the *.platform folders then Xcode crashes a few seconds after launching, but removing just the Runtimes subfolder under them seems to be OK - for the version I have at least, 13.4.1.\nI did this:\nbackup=~/xcode-smallen\nsubfolder=Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes\n\nfor f in /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/AppleTVOS.platform /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/WatchOS.platform ; do\n  platform=`basename $f`\n  target=$backup/$platform/$subfolder\n  mkdir -p $target\n  mv $f/$subfolder $target\ndone\n\nand Xcode now only needs 11GB (7GB compressed) and it still launches and compiles projects just fine. So this seems to be the ticket for now.\n", "Q: Apple Mail hides mail received on multiple addresses Recently I've noticed that if I'm sent an e-mail on multiple addresses for which I have accounts set up in Apple Mail (macOS or iOS), the Apple Mail client will only display only one of these mails, and provide no access (other than explicitly selecting to view one account) to the others. Moreover I can't choose which account's mail is displayed (and it can be different on macOS and iOS). \nIs this the intended behavior? Is there a way to restore the normal e-mail client behavior of simply seeing all the mail I've been sent?\n\nA: Many common Apple mail issues can be fixed by rebuilding the Envelope Index.\nMAKE SURE YOU HAVE CREATED A BACKUP, FIRST.

I need to batch-process some (several hours of) audio files and get their frequency/amplitude data.\nI really have 10 folders each containing many wav files and I need the averages of each folder.

I need to do some performance testing, and I need the MacBook to behave at i3 or i5 speeds. Is this possible? If yes, how?\nI have the MacBook Pro Retina / macOS Sierra 10.12.6 / 2.2GHz Intel Core i7.\n\nA: It's not 100% what you're looking for (in that the controls are not fine grained enough to say \"make my i7 4770HQ perform like an i3 4150\"), but something that will tweak your CPU's TurboBoost settings can help.\nOne application that can do so is Turbo Boost Switcher - it may be worth giving it a try. Another way is to disable CPU cores using Instruments.app (part of XCode). You could try a combination of the two to slow down your machine, perhaps benchmarking as you go (eg, using Geekbench or similar) until you reach the desired level of performance.\n", "Q: Terminal > Window shows all tabs (High Sierra) I use lots of terminal tabs : I have 3 main 'groups' of terminals, with different profiles to allow me to know whether they are ssh's into remote servers (and then live or uat etc), as well as local terminals. \nIn older versions of OSX the 'windows' menu would show one entry per 'window' (i.e. 4 entries), with the name being the currently active in that window. Now it seems that the windows menu shows an entry 'per tab' thats open, i.e. for 4 windows with 4 tabs each, 16 entries.\nIt makes finding the right tab much harder: the question is, is this a configurable to put it back to the previous way? I looked in preferences and couldn't find, and my google-fu was poor.\n\nA: While this is not a final solution, I have found an interesting behaviour that may lead to a real solution if someone can figure out how terminal is doing this.\nUsing macOS 10.14.6, Terminal 2.9.5 (421.2), I get much the same results as all of the above except, if I am in mc [midnight-commander: stable 4.8.22 (bottled)] the window list shows entries like this: mc[user@mymachine]:/~path — mc ► zsh ► — 89x20 \nThis is of course the tab tile showing the active process name and directory.  And as we have all noticed, the tab title does not show the current path of the base shell…\nIt seems that Terminal is reading the mc processes' state including a path statement. Unfortunately, the shell, bash, zsh, etc, does not seem to pass on its current path, or at least Terminal is not acting on it.  A solution might be found either within Terminal, or the shell one is using.\nI hope someone may be able to dissect this behaviour and find a solution.\n", "Q: Double-click doesn't \"fill\" screen I have a 2017 MBP connected to a monitor with HDMI. On my laptop screen, when I double click the top bar of a window, it fills the whole screen up to the Dock. However, when I do that with a window that's in the monitor's screen, the window fills the screen vertically but not horizontally. Meaning I have to still manually resize the window.\nIs this by design or am I doing something wrong?\n\nA: Only double click show you all content.  Press shift + double click fill all display :)\n", "Q: How to have podcasts autoplay after the iOS 11 upgrade? So once a podcast ends, it doesn’t just automatically to the next episode anymore. Is there a way to get around this?\n\nA: Yes. On 11.1.2 (maybe earlier versions as well, haven't checked), you can create your own station and the app will play the next one in the list after the podcast ends.\nExample to autoplay all episodes of a single podcast:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the \"Library\" screen of the podcast app, choose Edit -> New -> Name it something. \n\n*Set Station Play to \"Oldest to Newest\" (to mimic play order of previous podcast app versions)\n\n*Set Include Episodes to \"All Episodes\"\n\n*Choose Podcasts -> the Podcast you want to auto-play.\n\n\nNow play your new station and autoplay next will work.\n", "Q: Managed, Mobile account on Mac not giving me the option to change password when Admin is unlocked? I'm trying to change/access mobile and managed accounts on a Mac network system. System Preferences won't give me the option to change a password of a mobile account. How can I view or change this password?\n\nA: A managed / mobile account is controlled from the directory so you can't change that password unless there's some sort of integration with a tool like Apple Enterprise Connect or Nomad (https://nomad.menu) where the tool calls to the Active Directory to make the password change.\nAll Mac accounts have their password encrypted and obfuscated, so you'd have a hard time cracking them.\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I recover a standard user's password using the admin password?\nBest bet is to get your admin staff to assist you in resetting the passwords or letting you be the administator of this Mac and set up local accounts.\n", "Q: Upon trying to login to an Active Directory, I am alerted with a window saying the account has expired. How can I enable it? Upon trying to login to an all domains in Directory Utility, I am alerted with a window saying the account has expired. How can I re-enable it or fix this problem another way? I am able to unlock it with my administrator password, but it will not work for all domains.\n\nA: You would need to use an app that connects to AD (ldap app of some sort) or remote into your domain controller using screen sharing or PowerShell to unlock the account.\nEven a tool  Apple Enterprise Connect or Nomad (https://nomad.menu) where the tool calls to the Active Directory only serves to change an existing account password and doesn’t have hooks to unlock a different account when you log in as a domain administrator account.\n", "Q: How do I delete a downloaded iOS software update on iOS 6? In general on newer iOS versions, you can delete downloaded software updates by going to Settings > General > Usage > Manage Storage > and then finding the update and deleting it from there. Here is an article outlining the process.\nHowever, it doesn't seem like this is possible on iOS 6. This leads me to my question: how can I delete a downloaded update on iOS 6? The iOS 8.4.1 update was downloaded to my iPhone 5, but I do not want to update to that version, accidentally or otherwise. I want to get rid of this update file from my device completely.\nWould resetting all contents and settings work? Is there a better way to go about doing this without needing to use such a strong method of resetting everything?\n\nA: The easiest way is to back up the iPhone via iCloud Backup. Then sign out of the iPhone, and then \"Erase all Content and Settings\". \nOnce the iPhone comes back on, setup the iPhone properly, then when you get to the \"Apps & Data\" screen, choose restore from iCloud backup, and choose the recent backup.\n", "Q: Get/Copy current Excel file's path When in Windows 10 or in Windows 7, if I have an Excel file open and I want to know the path to the file I can use the ‘open current file in explorer’ button and it opens that file in the Windows Explorer, where I can copy the path to the file.\nHowever, in Mac, I am not able to find any option like that unless I open Finder and find the current file's name, then right click and choose Get Info on the file there.\nI do not want to do a lot of work just to get the file path. Is there an easy way to do this?\n\nA: The Excel function \n=CELL(\"filename\",A1)\n\nwill give you the complete path to a file that has been saved. You can copy the result of the function and use Paste Values to retain only the text. \nIf the file has not yet been saved, the function returns a blank. \n\nA: You can 'option-right click' the file from finder and one option is to copy the file path to clipboard. This at least gives you access to the path.  \n\nA: This task is super simple with AppleScript in Excel from Office 2011.\n(I can't presently confirm it works with Office 2016.)\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n# Auth: Christopher Stone\n# dCre: 2017/11/28 15:34\n# dMod: 2017/11/28 15:39\n# Appl: Microsoft Excel\n# Task: Get the front document's container folder path & its full path.\n# Libs: None\n# Osax: None\n# Tags: @Applescript, @Script, @Microsoft_Excel, @Front, @Document, @Container, @Folder, @Path, @Full, @Path\n# Test: Tested only in Excel 14.7.1 (of Office 2011) on macOS 10.12.6\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\ntell application \"Microsoft Excel\"\n   tell front document\n      set docContainerPathHFS to path\n      set docFullPath to full name\n   end tell\nend tell\n\nset the clipboard to docFullPath\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nYou can get the path to the document's container folder or its full path.\nHere's another technique using UI-Scripting that works with most applications even if they're NOT scriptable.

As you stated, it can't be done the other way around.\n\nA: Well, as it turns out, while the TB3 cable will send some signals to the USB-C dock, it won't send a video signal on my CalDigit USB-C Dock.

Place that file somewhere into your PATH. Make sure to chmod 755 the script so it’s executable. For good measure, I’d recommend to also sudo chmod root:wheel it.\nFrom now on, you can invoke the script like so:\nopen_new_window https://www.apple.com/ https://www.apple.com/ https://www.amazon.com/\n\nIn case you don’t want to use a separate script\nUse the following variant for testing, or if you prefer a command line without a separate script:\nosascript \\\n  -e 'on run(theUrls)' \\\n  -e '  tell app id \"com.google.chrome\" to tell make new window' \\\n  -e '    repeat with theUrl in theUrls' \\\n  -e '      set newTab to make new tab ¬' \\\n  -e '        with properties { url: theUrl }' \\\n  -e '    end repeat' \\\n  -e '    tell tab 1 to close' \\\n  -e '  end tell' \\\n  -e 'end run' \\\n  https://www.apple.com/ https://www.apple.com/ https://www.amazon.com/\n\n", "Q: Close safari automatically Safari can ben opened from a terminal automatically\nopen -a safari\n\nWhen comes to close it, I have to press 'Cmd+Shift+W' or click quit option in dock\nIs it possible to quit safari automatically? like\nclose -a safari\n\n\nA: One of the Apple-supported ways to do it is the following AppleScript command:\ntell app \"Safari\" to quit\n\nUse the following one-liner to run the same thing from your shell:\nosascript -e 'tell app \"Safari\" to quit'\n\nOr, use the bundle ID if that’s more your thing:\nosascript -e 'tell app id \"com.apple.Safari\" to quit'\n\n", "Q: How to fix Users & Groups / Other Users?

I used Time Machine to migrate, so no configuration changed.\n\n*The F4 also does not work with on an external Magic Keyboard, indicating a software / mapping issue.\n\n\nI suspect that some change in High Sierra makes macOS not pass the F4 key on to applications, but I'm not sure.  I have checked that no system wide keyboard shortcut is assigned to F4. What else could I check?\nUpdate: The issue can be confirmed with the keyboard viewer, a program that allows to display all keys pressed. It clearly confirms that all keys except F4 are registered by the system while F4 is not.\n\nA: I have seen elsewhere that some key combos stop working until you reinstall iTerm2. If you have homebrew and cask installed, you can use brew cask reinstall iterm2.\n(I'm so unsure about the efficacy of this that I would have posted it as a comment, but I can't comment yet)\n\nA: I found a (weird) solution here.  This could be some arcane migration bug that is present in MacOS for very long time.  The linked thread is from 2011. Here is what worked for me.\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your keyboard shortcut preferences (i.e. write them down)\n\n*Delete the file ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist\n\n*reboot\n\n*Set up keyboard shortcuts in preferences as desired\n\n\nA: Apparently it's related to safari and / or chrome, and / or gmail / inbox \nhttps://discussions.apple.com/thread/7813416\na quick fix: +Q on safari and chrome, wait 30-40s, test it...\n\nA: I discovered the issue to be the Spotify app. Just add this to the stack of grievances with their app/service and lack of support.\nI still have Chrome open now, and about 30 seconds after quitting Spotify, F4 is working just fine again.\nI just went a step further and found a solution! I diffed the running processes listed in Activity Monitor both before and after running Spotify, and one process stood out: NowPlayingTouchUI. I did a force quit on that process in Activity Monitor, and F4 works again! However, as soon as the song changes, it comes back.\nFrom some other info I found online, I devised the following solution which fixes the problem by preventing this process from running.\nDisable SIP\n\n*\n\n*Restart the machine in recovery mode (cmd-R) on startup.\n\n*Click on the Utilities menu and select \"Terminal\"; if you don't see this, you need to restart and enter Recovery Mode again.\n\n*Type \"csrutil disable\" in Terminal, then press enter.\n\n*Close Terminal and select \"Restart\" from the Apple menu.\n\nMove the NowPlayinTouchUI LaunchAgent\n\n\n*After the system restarts, run Terminal again, and enter the following command, and press enter, and type in your password (if/when prompted) and hit enter again. This command will move the com.apple.NowPlayingTouchUI.plist file from the LaunchAgents folder to your home directory.\nsudo mv /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.NowPlayingTouchUI.plist ~\n\n\n\n*Lastly, just logout/login again for the changes to take effect.\nFrom this point on, NowPlayingTouchUI will no longer be launched, and your F4 key will continue working while using the Spotify app!\nIf you wish to re-enable SIP, just relaunch in recovery mode again, launch terminal, and enter the command \"csrutil enable\" and press enter, then restart.\nThis fix is confirmed working after a couple restarts of my MacBook Pro (macOS 10.12.6 Sierra) and Spotify (1.1.52.687.gf5565fe5).\n", "Q: How to install an old version of Opera? I've recently upgraded my MacBook Pro from 10.8.5 to 10.10.5 and \na) I want to install an older version of Opera (version 40)\nb) I want to eliminate the auto update issue.\nIssues:\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried downgrading Opera, but anytime I install an older version it autoupdates to the latest version without my consent. \n\n*I tried with an old .dmg I had saved, however the OSX gives me this message when I click on it:\n \nIf I let the system complete the verification I end up with the latest version of Opera. If I switch off the internet the process stops and I can't install a simple .dmg (it's as if OSX/Apple demands users to install only the software they expect/approve of).\nAny solution please?\n\nA: There are a few problems to consider here:\nThe screenshot in the question doesn't show the verification of the DMG on mount but the verification on application launch. Mounting a disk image is possible without internet connection.\n\n\n*\n\n*You need the actual application or the full installer\nLike many vendors you may end up with a tiny download that is only an installer stub that pulls in the actual installation data at runtime.\nThis can be circumvented by copying an old version of a fully installed Opera from a backup. The application is self-contained and will create all necesary support files on the fly when run.\nOr for a fresh installation: download the full installer DMG from Opera's servers:\n40.0.2308.90. (kudos to klanomath)\nThat gives you a drag and drop install from a DMG. \n\n*The verify process for newly installed applications on macOS is misleading us.\nObviously, parts of an application package are already executed while we all think macOS blocks all execution until the verification process is finished.\nIn this case Opera.app/Contents/MacOS/opera_autoupdate is run and auto-updates to the latest version while we still see the operating system verifying the application bundle.\n\n*The auto-update can be prevented\n\n\n*\n\n*3.1 by moving/deleting/disabling the binary above – before the first launch. (Giving you \"Checking for updates…\" under \"About Opera\" never finishing, otherwise it launches and behaves fine)\n\n*3.2 by blocking the auto-update-server via /etc/hosts – (untested: 127.0.0.1 autoupdate.geo.opera.com ?)\n\n*3.3 by setting a system-wide proxy or personal firewall that blocks connections to Opera's update servers (only). (Both 3.2 and 3.3 will give you \"An error occurred while checking for updates\" under \"About Opera\")\n\n*3.4 by launching Opera from the commandline with the switch --check-for-update-interval=0. (Cleanest solution but you need to do this every time or create your own launcher for it.)\n\n\n\nSince Opera seems to not have an option in the graphical settings panes to set auto update intervals: option 3.1 seems to be the easiest way to go.\nThis is for more recent versions of Opera. On an older version the official guidelines might still apply: Change auto-update settings.\nFinally: if an autoupdate already has taken place: Opera keeps the last two binaries downloaded in Opera.app/Contents/Versions. Simply delete the version you do not want in there before re-launching the application again. \n\nA: Try to find the version you need on their ftp : ftp://ftp.opera.com/pub/\n", "Q: Xcode - Can I develop for iOS 11.1 in El Capitan? I'm a software development student and I'm building an iOS app for a class.\nThe thing is I have a MacBook Pro Mid 2009 with El Capitan 10.11.6 (15G17023)\nand an iPhone 5s running iOS 11.1.2 (15B202).\nThe latest version of Xcode compatible with El Capitan (I think) is 8.2.1 and it is not compatible with my iOS version.\nThe app I'm trying to make does not require ARKit or anything that advanced and I would like to know if is there a way I can make this work with my actual devices?\nI really don't have the money to upgrade my MacBook for a newer one nor for an older iPhone.\nThanks a lot for your help!    \n\nEdit: I no longer have this problem but obviously the question will stay open because we haven't found a solution nor a proper answer.\nWhat I did was install This High Sierra Patcher and from there update Xcode and everything necessary to develop.\nI do not recommend this: you are making modifications to your computer that can result in unexpected behavior and you know, all that anti-piracy speech... and also Xcode runs terribly slow (there is a reason why this computer model cannot be updated anymore.)\n\nA: I hope you get a better answer, because this is not ideal but is all I have:\nYou could develop using the latest version of Xcode that will run on your Mac using the simulator for day-to-day testing. Then when you really need to test on a real device, upload a beta to the App Store, configure yourself as an Internal Tester and use TestFlight to download the app to your 'phone.\nEdit: This may also require a full developer account!\n", "Q: Hide Notification Center button from menu bar in High Sierra How do I get rid of the Notification Center button in the menu bar in High Sierra?\nIt's that one in the far right:\n\nI'd like the space it occupies to disappear too. Apparently it used to be possible to hide the icon but the space would remain.\nAlso, I want to continue using the Notification Center; currently I access it with a gesture on my trackpad.\nThe answers to Remove the Notification Center icon from the Menu Bar do not work for me in High Sierra.\n\nA: The Bartender app allows you to hide and rearrange menu bar icons - it may work for you.\n", "Q: How to hide Spotlight in menu bar but keep the ⌘Space keyboard shortcut?

The app is used to hide pretty much any menu bar icon, and has a lot of great features. It's kind of a \"must have\" for and Mac Power User. \n", "Q: Using cat output in osascript in terminal I want to display a notification using osascript in terminal, but the text I want to display is stored in a text file. How can I display that text in the notification?\n\nA: Basically you need to read the file content into a variable first. There are several ways to do this, one is\ntext=$(< TEXTFILE)\nosascript ... \"$text\"\n\n\nA: In the Bash shell, you can read in the text of the file using cat and shove it into a substitution.\nSomething like:\nosascript -e \"display notification \\\"$(cat /tmp/foo.txt)\\\" with title \\\"hello\\\"\"\n(Obviously put something in /tmp/foo.txt first, like echo \"Hello world\" > /tmp/foo.txt)\n\nA: Here is the complete soloution to my initial question I posted about:\nset listOfCommand to (read POSIX file \"path-to/command.txt\")\n  tell application \"Terminal\"\n    do script listOfCommand\n    delay 1\n    quit\n  end tell\nset listOfShows to (read POSIX file \"path-to/dump.txt\")\n tell application \"Safari\"\n    display notification listOfShows with title \"Downloads:\"\n end tell\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to tell if a unjailbroken phone has been jailbroken in the past?

I used the models in this website to test the performance of my computer to render 3D graphics, and I found that dragging a 3D model is very choppy in Safari, while in Chrome it’s much more fluid. I know little about how a computer works, but I’m curious about the reason for this difference.\nDevice information: MacBook Pro 15\" Retina, 2015\nmacOS version: 10.13.1\nEdits:\nIt turns out that the low performance of Safari in rendering 3D graphics has to do with the computer not being shut down for a long time. And suggested by Jake3231 in the comments, I used EtreCheck to check my computer. Here is the report:\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Overall, the Etrecheck report looks pretty good. I would suggest that you remove the adware it found, as that can sometimes affect performance. You could click the red \"remove\" button next to items that are labeled as adware.\nAn alternative way to remove adware is by downloading Malwarebytes for Mac. After you do that, I would also suggest you update Flash Player just to protect against malware that may reduce browsing performance, among other things.\nI would suggest that after this you also boot your Mac in Safe Mode. Once your system boots and displays a red \"Safe Mode\" label at the top right of the login screen, you can shut down and power on the machine. After that, hopefully things run a bit better. You can learn more about safe mode here: Use safe mode to isolate issues with your Mac\n", "Q: How to open port 9150 on a Mac so external devices can connect to it? On Localhost I can access and connect to port 9150, but on another devices on the network it cannot see the port and cannot connect to it. I've checked and there is no firewall on the network preventing the connection.\nIf it matters I have a proxy server running on that port that I need other devices to be able to connect to.\nI am running macOS High Sierra 10.13.1 on a MacBook Pro Early 2015.\n\nA: By default, your Tor client only listens for applications that connect from localhost (i.e. lo0 - 127.0.0.1). So the proxy is not bound to other interfaces like en0 or en1.\nTo set up a Tor proxy for apps on other hosts in the network you should follow the how-to:\n\nI want to run my Tor client on a different computer than my applications.\n  By default, your Tor client only listens for applications that connect from localhost. Connections from other computers are refused. If you want to torify applications on different computers than the Tor client, you should edit your torrc to define SocksListenAddress 0.0.0.0 and then restart (or hup) Tor. If you want to get more advanced, you can configure your Tor client on a firewall to bind to your internal IP but not your external IP.\nCan I install Tor on a central server, and have my clients connect to it?\n  Yes. Tor can be configured as a client or a relay on another machine, and allow other machines to be able to connect to it for anonymity. This is most useful in an environment where many computers want a gateway of anonymity to the rest of the world. However, be forwarned that with this configuration, anyone within your private network (existing between you and the Tor client/relay) can see what traffic you are sending in clear text. The anonymity doesn't start until you get to the Tor relay. Because of this, if you are the controller of your domain and you know everything's locked down, you will be OK, but this configuration may not be suitable for large private networks where security is key all around.\nConfiguration is simple, editing your torrc file's SocksListenAddress according to the following examples:\nSocksListenAddress 127.0.0.1\nSocksListenAddress 192.168.x.x:9100\nSocksListenAddress 0.0.0.0:9100\nYou can state multiple listen addresses, in the case that you are part of several networks or subnets.\nSocksListenAddress 192.168.x.x:9100 #eth0\n   SocksListenAddress 10.x.x.x:9100 #eth1\nAfter this, your clients on their respective networks/subnets would specify a socks proxy with the address and port you specified SocksListenAddress to be.\nPlease note that the SocksPort configuration option gives the port ONLY for localhost (127.0.0.1). When setting up your SocksListenAddress(es), you need to give the port with the address, as shown above.\nIf you are interested in forcing all outgoing data through the central Tor client/relay, instead of the server only being an optional proxy, you may find the program iptables (for *nix) useful.\n\nSource: Tor FAQ\nLocation of the torcc file: ~/Library/Application Support/TorBrowser-Data/Tor\n\nI didn't get this to work properly!\n", "Q: Can I transfer a call to another number mid-call (on my iPhone)?

I found that one screw \"hole\" was unlinked from board. So my heat sink is fixed with 3 screws. But it touches bottom plate when it fixed. So it is kind of tight to CPU anyway. It can be a problem though. But why stress tests passing then?! Read next.\n\n*monitor temperature (no overheating)\n\n*monitor battery (no problems)\n\n*run Apple Hardware Test (no issues)\n\n*look at Console App. Logs are not saying anything important or like.

A bit difficult for me now.\n\n*I have read in some places, that this problem doesn't appear in Windows in Boot Camp! I even downloaded Windows 10 to try, but not yet. Anyway I need my favourite macOS, not Windows.\n\n*Somewhere I read that it is some problem because of low voltage mode on CPU. It causes some 'unstable' regime in CPU and so system halts. It was only little info about that. It seems like real path to solution. But I don't know how to investigate this more.\n\n\nA little History\n\n\n*\n\n*2 months ago: I changed battery with one from aliexpress (china market). It was described as OEM Apple. It is quite the same and it detects with coconutBattery as Simplo manufacturer. I Googled and they say it is like OEM.\n\n*1 month ago: I have replaced my charger cord with one from fault charger. With MagSafe 2 connector.\n\n\nThe beginning\nI took my MacBook to the bed and it shut down unexpectedly. It was like screen gone black, but backlight on. Then fans went full throttle slowly. And then it shut down completely. I pressed power btn and it started as usual. No messages. No warnings.\nThen it worked for some time (maybe half an hour) and story repeated.\nI decided that it is overheating because of bed. Took it to the desk. And problem repeated in some time. I began to google this hard. And play with problem to nail it down. \nIn the process I found that it works fine in Safe Mode (almost, but I had couple of crashes even in safe mode) It works fine when I reinstall macOS. All long 2 hours of downloading and 1 of installing it worked. After long google I found that it works better with external screen connected.\nCurrent situation\nSo to recap. MacBook is failing almost always, except when I have external screen and video on it.\n\nA: Ok. Finally. I found somewhat like working solution.\nRealMacMods NoCrashMBP\nIt looks like a scam. Truly is. It is website with no links to, no citing in google. It is really looks like they want my 2.5$ and that's all. \nI decided to take that risk ($2.5 lol) Because only good solution I saw was to replace logic board, as many solutions in internet say. It is 500$. \nIt worked. I have to say it to everybody with the same problem. \nAuthors explanation is:\n\nAnyway, this issue is triggered when the CPU goes into an extremely low frequency/clock rate on one of the cores(that just can't handle it), when this happens the system somewhat silently crashes(that is to say, it writes no logs of the event, and no kernel panic takes place). This app/utility keeps it from ever going into that stupidly low frequency.  This actually happens natively on Linux and Boot Camp installations, but for some reason OS X tries to drop into that frequency every so often and the system is not at all stable there.   Absolutely no chance of damage, worst case you may see like 1% worse battery life, as i believe OS X is using that low frequency to squeeze a little extra battery life out of the older MacBooks.\n\nYouTube video of installation\n\nA: https://outluch.wixsite.com/rmbp-crash\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable SIP (csrutil disable from Recovery)\n\n*Move AppleThunderboltNHI.kext\n\nsudo mv /System/Library/Extensions/AppleThunderboltNHI.kext \\\n/System/Library/Extensions/AppleThunderboltNHI.kext.BAK\n\n\n\n*Reenable SIP (csrutil enable from Recovery)\n\n\nA: Ok.

Not GPU. One man tested with GPU loading firstly, but later found, that it is all about CPU. It is loaded - we are fine. It is in idle - we shut down.\nI tried to run yes > /dev/null & one time, but it loads my cpu a lot and fans go full throttle. Not fun. I will better look at fullscreen youtube video of beach while working. :D\nAnd tomorrow I will visit nearest apple service to talk a bit.

More specifically:\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Finder, press CommandK (or click on the Go menu and select Connect to Server...)\n\n*Now enter the server address \n\n*Click on the Connect button\n\n*IMPORTANT: If you're a registered user, when entering your login details you must ensure you enable the option for remembering your password in keychain\n\n*Once connected, go to Apple > System Preferences > Users & Groups\n\n*Select the Login Items tab\n\n*Now navigate to the mounted server (e.g. on your desktop) and drag it to the Login Items list\n\n*OPTIONAL: If you don't want the server window to open every time you startup, you can click on the Hide checkbox on the left of the server in the Login Items list\n\n\nNOTES: \n\n\n*\n\n*At step 4 the reason I say you must opt to remember the password is that macOS needs to remember this in order to be able to log in automatically!\n\n*At step 7, if you don't see the server mounted on your desktop, then go to Finder > Preferences > General and tick the checkbox for Connected servers.\n\n*Keep in mind that if for whatever reason your Mac can't connect to the server, this may in fact become more annoying then having to connect manually.\n\n\nIf your server doesn't mount on the desktop\nIf you can't get the server to mount on your desktop, try following these steps instead:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Apple > System Preferences > Users & Groups\n\n*Select the Login Items tab\n\n*Click on the + button at the bottom of the Login Items list\n\n*In the window that opens, click on the server in your left Sidebar (or navigate to it)\n\n*If you're not already connected to it, then connect to it through this window. (IMPORTANT: If you're a registered user, when entering your login details you must ensure you enable the option for remembering your password in keychain)\n\n*Once connected, navigate to and select whichever folder on your server you use the most\n\n*After a moment the add button will become active. Click on this\n\n*Now the folder you selected at Step 6 will be added to your Login Items\n\n*OPTIONAL: If you don't want the server window to open every time you startup, you can click on the Hide checkbox on the left of the server in the Login Items list\n\n\nTo show network mounted volumes (SMB, AFP, NFS, etc.) on your desktop, issue the following command in Terminal:\ndefaults write com.apple. finder ShowMountedServersOnDesktop —bool true\n\n\nA: I have found a different solution that allows me to automate the process even further. \nHere is the code I use:\ntell application \"Viscosity\"\n    set connectionState to \"dunno\"\n    repeat until (connectionState = \"Connected\")\n        if connectionState = \"Disconnected\" then\n            connect \"VPN_CONNECTION1\"\n            connect \"VPN_CONNECTION2\"\n        end if\n        set connectionState to state of connections where name is equal to \"VPN_CONNECTION1\"\n        set connectionState to connectionState as string\n    end repeat\n    tell application \"Finder\"\n        activate\n        if (count of windows) is 0 then\n            mount volume \"smb://username:password@IP_address/share\"\n            mount volume \"smb://username:password@IP_address/share\"\n        end if\n    end tell\nend tell\n\nThe above apple script will automatically startup my Viscosity VPN and upon a succesfull connection it will start to connect to my SMB servers. If you export the code to an application and then put it into your login items it will automatically connect everytime you startup.\nHope this helps anyone. \nKind regards,\nGranny\n", "Q: Suddenly can only manually mount disk images from Disk Utility I used to be able to mount disk images from the Finder via ⌘O, Double clicking, etc. but after using High Sierra for 1 day, it suddenly couldn't anymore in the middle of me using it.\nCan anyone help?

The lagging performance can be seen when I do something with Java VM especially Android Studio.\nUPDATE\nI connected my mac book over mini display to display port since HDMI does not support 60hz. Lag means when you scroll the code editor in Android studio, it is not very fluent.If i type something there is a small time gap till i see the letters appear on the screen.\n\nA: Scaling is your culprit. Anything different than 1080p or 4K is going to tax the GPU and cause lag. It's unfortunate. I think a solution which costs a lot more money would be to purchase a 5K monitor then run it at 1440p (the only acceptable resolution imho) This would be the default resolution since it's exactly half of 5K. 1080p is exactly half of 4K which is why the GPU doesn't struggle on a 4k monitor when run at that resolution. Of course 4k at it's natural resolution is far too tiny to be useable which I'm sure you found out. So 1080p and 4k are just not useable for a 27\" monitor. Purchasing a blurry 1440p monitor or a 5K monitor run at retina 1440p are the only options to get a lag free experience imho on a 27\" external display paired with a MacBook Pro.\n\nA: It's pretty weird that device with a cost of $2k+ is not able to handle 4K screen scaling... I am really disappointed and assume to buy a Windows Laptop next and forget about Apple infrastructure at all. @cyberfunk is right - screen on \"Default\" resolution (1080p) works much smoother.\nJust a note for other users if someone experienced the same issue I am on MacbookPro 2015 15\" highest configuration.\nA bit of my research history:\n\n*\n\n*connecting by HDMI the monitor lags so much. I realized that it's because of HDMI 1.2 cable can't handle 4k monitors.\n\n*connected the monitor using DisplayPort to MiniDisplayPort (Thunderbolt) and this worked much better - the visible lags without any processes has gone, but I still had a feeling I work on Pentium 3 machine doing some GPU and CPU expensive tasks.\n\n*changed resolution to \"Default\" 1080p solved the low performance on heavy tasks, but now 4k monitor just lost his initial designation because everything is too huge.\n\nThere are 3 ways to proceed:\n\n*\n\n*use it as it is\n\n*buy a 5K monitor where \"Default\" resolution will be 1440p which is most comfortable to use. But note that 5K monitors price is insane, easier to buy new laptop\n\n*sell your Macbook and forget about this problem.\n\nGood luck.

This happens the same whether I'm using the trackpad or a USB mouse.\nPreviously, I thought that the issue was isolated to a single application, WebStorm, and I thought that it was isolated to only hovering over hyperlinks, when the mouse cursor attempts to change to the hand icon. It would rapidly change between the hand and the text cursor and the mouse would get stuck there because it gets slowed and choppy while hovering over that text.\nHowever, I recently noticed this happen in Google Chrome as well. Specifically (and consistently), when you enter a password for a website and the \"key\" icon shows up in the address bar, it asks if you want Google Smart Lock to save the password...when hovering over the white space next to that text in the bubble, it does the same thing, switching between the arrow and the text cursor.\nI searched, but I can't find anyone else that seems to be experiencing quite the same issue. Others have reported issues with the mouse cursor, but not exactly the same problem I'm seeing.\nI may try and revert back to regular Sierra, but I wanted to see if anyone else is seeing the same thing or has any idea how to fix it?\nHere is a video showing the issue in WebStorm: https://imgur.com/m00slwn\nAnd here is a video showing the issue in Chrome: https://imgur.com/gsKM0mn\nThe screencast doesn't capture the mouse cursor rapidly changing, especially in the Chrome video, but it is much more drastic than shown in the video.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this is the same issue, but just in case it helps you or anyone many years later, this is what happened to me and how I solved it.\nI use a larger than default cursor from the accessibility menus because otherwise I can never find the darned thing. On my Macbook Pro (new machine) I have been frustrated by the mouse feeling like it is wading through treacle when I move it over an area with lots of links in Chrome.\nThe right hand side of a Stack Overflow post would be a great example as the cursor is changing from arrow->hand->arrow over and over again as you move the cursor across the related links. Compared to moving the cursor over the empty space next to it I would have to move the physical mouse 2-3x as far on my desk.\nI seem to have just solved this by changing the cursor scaling in the accessibility menu to a different (but similar, non-default) value.\nFrom interrogating the values with\ndefaults read com.apple.universalaccess mouseDriverCursorSize\nat the command line I have noticed that some values cause the problem and others don't. For example the default and max values of 1 and 4 do not cause a problem, and nor does 2. I did see the problem with 2.096360005605382 but its not just about being an integer as I didn't see the problem with 2.577354260089686.  I have no idea what this information means.  Perhaps some sort of cursor scaling performance bug with specific cursor sizes?\nAnyway this may be unrelated to your issue as your pointer does look about normal size in those videos, but you could try playing with this setting.\n\nA: FYI, I noticed this on macOS Monterey up to version 12.3. Rob Murphy's observation appears to be correct. If I change the cursor size in Accessibility -> Display -> Pointer, it appears to have resolved my issue.\nI had changed my cursor size in a previous version of macOS, so I'm not sure if something changed between releases but I know that when I started using Monterey, at some point I noticed this lagging behaviour when hovering over links in apps.\nIt now appears to be resolved after changing the size.\n", "Q: Copy voice messages from iPhone How can I copy voice messages from Phone (not text or log information) from an iPhone 4 to a computer so you can listen back to them?\nI am a songwriter and the only was I was able to save some songs on a moment's notice was to call myself up and leave them as messages which I have renewed, some for over a year.

However, if the original Magic Trackpad is anything to go by, you should get years of service from it.\n\nA: It's going to be a long shot, but:\n\n\n*\n\n*Sierra has been superb all along,\n\n*at some point it started pushing these \"Update to High Sierra\" forced notifications,\n\n*after a week of these problems started to occur - first the whole Mac became less responsive, then the Magic Trackpad issue occurred and for the last two days I could not use the Magic Trackpad at all - the cursor became jumpy, even when charging,\n\n*NVRAM and SMC resets didn't help, jumpy cursor in safe mode as well,\n\n*I never installed anything in the last weeks, especially the trackpad issues happened all of sudden,\n\n*installing High Sierra fixed all issues listed above.\n\n\nI can't help but think it's all not a coincidence.

This exact message would also pop up if someone would connect your iPhone to one of those devices that are used to gather content from them, ie, law enforcement.\nI don't believe you can set the iPhone to \"trust\" more than one device at a time.\n", "Q: How can i choose to boot from the second SSD harddisk for a mid 2011 iMac? I am planning to follow the instruction from MacSale to add an additional SSD to a mid-2011 27\" iMac (https://youtu.be/eFHvIrdm9So)\nIt will be placed under the optical drive.\n\nI want to make this drive the boot disk and do a fresh install of macOS to this drive. However the video did not touch on this area.\nBased on what I know, I think I can \n1) Start up the system after the installation is complete.\n2) After chime, I will use Command (⌘) – Option (⌥) – R combination to boot into internet recovery\n3) install macOS to the new drive\nHowever I am not sure how to permanently boot from the SSD drive.\nIn summary, my questions:\na) Is my plan  of 'internet recovery ' going to work?\nb) how to permanently boot from the SSD drive?\n\nA: In system preferences, there is a selection for startup disk. You should be able to select your new drive.\n\nA: Actually, High Sierra was built for what you want to do. This version of macOS introduces Apple File System (APFS) partitions. What you want is a single EFI and and APFS partition on each internal drive. You then construct a container which encompasses both drives. This container will know which of the two drives is the faster SSD. You then install macOS into this container. The installation process will also include the recovery volume in this container. The advantage to this approach is the software used most often will automatically be stored on the faster SSD. \nYou will probably want to first create a USB flash drive High Sierra installer. The instructions are given at How to create a bootable installer for macOS.\n", "Q: Can a thunderbolt 3 cable be used on MacBook 12inch for data transfer? I just got a new 13-inch MacBook Pro  with Touchbar and I need to transfer my data from my old MacBook 12 to it. While using migration assistant over wifi, it always has errors or got stuck so I'm going to try the target disk mode. I did some research and a YouTube video says I need to use Thunderbolt 3 cable, so I just went to a local hardware store to buy the cable.\nHowever, the stuff there told me a Thunderbolt 3 cable will have adaptability issue on my 12inch MacBook and recommend me buying a 5Gbps USB-C cable. Thinking I might use thunderbolt 3 in the future and their price difference is not that large, I will definitely choose a thunderbolt cable if it can be used. Speed is not an issue.\n\nA: I am answering my own question. Short answer: NO.\nI received my Belkin Thunderbolt 3 cable today (https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-USB-IF-Certified-Thunderbolt-Compatible/dp/B0725DW6D3/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1511766135&sr=8-4&keywords=belkin%2Bthunderbolt%2B3&th=1 the 1.6 foot one). By directly connecting my new MacBook Pro and MacBook 12inch, the new MacBook Pro still couldn’t recognize that 12inch MacBook. I did some more research just now, and on this page(https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201462 scroll down to the bottom), it seems that a USB-C 3.1 cable is the only way that does the work. The shop assistant was right.\nI am not sure if it could work with other situations, but unfortunately it doesn’t work with target disk mode. Btw, the cable doesn’t have any problem since my 12inch MacBook was charging when connecting to the new MacBook Pro.\n", "Q: iphone x camera files sizes I'm going to buy iPhone X and I wonder which size will be most appropriate, 64GB or 256GB.\nI'm not a big user of apps, taking pictures or video but because my iPhone 5S 16 gb is full right now I am afraid iPhone X will fill up in the years ahead.

After I log into my account I immediately see this message:\n\"routined wants to use the \"Local Items\" keychain\"\nI tried to use my Mac account’s local password, but the alert did not disappear.\nWhat is Routine? How do I resolve this?\n\nA: Did you change your password recently? Probable solution that worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the app \"Keychain Access\".\n\n*From the side-bar, go to \"login\".\n\n*Click on \"Edit\" menu from the menu bar and choose \"Change Password for Keychain \"Login\"...\"\n\n*Enter the old password of your user account in the Current Password field. This is the password you were using before the password was reset.\n\n*Enter the new password of your user account in the New Password field. This is the password you're now using to log in to your Mac. Enter the same password in the Verify field.\n\n\n\n*Click OK, and exit the Keychain Access program.\n\n\nIn my experience, this would happen if you recently changed your system password. Since your login keychain relies on the password to be able to access the credentials, it keeps popping you the question.\nSource: Apple\n\nA: I had this problem too.  This was my solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal\n\n*cd ~/Library/Keychains\n\n*ls   \n\n*locate the file that looks something like this: \n94ED610F-DD96-4ECF-A2BC-7D2F8651A464 (yours will be different)\n\n*rm -rf 94ED610F-DD96-4ECF-A2BC-7D2F8651A464 (whatever your file is called)\n\n*reboot your Mac.\n\n\nA: I just got this message today (I upgraded to High Sierra a couple weeks ago), and was also concerned about possible maliciousness.  I'm not sure why routined needs access to the Local Items keychain, but I figured I'd document here what I've figured out so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Selecting cancel doesn't seem to have caused any problems, so I'd recommend that, rather than risking opening up your keychain unnecessarily.\n\n*routined seems to be involved in tracking recent location information. \n\n\n*\n\n*I did just travel for the holidays, so something location based might explain why I'm only seeing it now.\n\n\n*Looking at running processes named routined and running strings on the binary didn't reveal anything malicious-looking (not a definitive examination, I know, but it's a start).\n\n\nOther than that, my research was unfortunately mostly a dead end.  All the links seemed to be references to the process's cache which includes tracking information, and all my google results seemed to be re-iterations (i.e. copy and pastes) from work by Sarah Edwards, who has a blog called Mac4n6.com.  She has a \"Contact Me\" page, and I've reached out with a query for more information on this topic.\nOther than that, hopefully someone more knowledgeable than myself will chime in.  The only advice I can glean from other similar issues with keychain prompting users like this is the unfortunately unhelpful advice to try restarting the computer, recreating the user account, or re-installing the OS, none of which actually address the actual issue.\n", "Q: How do I enable Time Machine local snapshots on an iMac? I have an iMac with a Fusion drive running High Sierra. Time Machine is enabled and backs up to an external disc.\nTime Machine takes daily local snapshots so that you can go back to a specific day, even if you don't plug in your backup disc every day.\nUnfortunately, this feature is enabled only on laptops, as the aforelinked page says.\nHow do I tell Time Machine to enable it on my iMac? I plug in my external disc only once a fortnight to backup, but I'd still like to go back to a particular day's snapshot, say if I overwrote a file.\n\nA: It seems that local snapshots are enabled automatically in High Sierra.\n\nThe text in the red box translates to \"local snapshots, as long as disk space is available\".\nI didn't find something from Appe on this, but this blogpost comes to the same conclusion.\n", "Q: Karabiner elements custom complex rule I have a busted close-bracket key on my keyboard. Previously, I had used Karabiner to map L-control+open_bracket to close_bracket using a custom rule I wrote in the xml-format used by karabiner.\nHowever, now that I've updated to Sierra, Karabiner is out, and Karabiner elements is in. Karabiner elements uses a JSON format. I tried to create a new rule and stick it in the JSON file:\n\"rules\": [\n         {\"manipulators\": [\n                {\"description\": \"bracket rule\",\n                        \"from\": {\"key_code\": \"open_bracket\", \n                                 \"modifiers\": [\"left_control\"]\n                                },\n                          \"to\": [{\"key_code\": \"close_bracket\",\n                                  \"modifiers\":[]\n                                }] \n                }         ]\n         }]\n\nHowever, this rule doesn't seem to work the way I'd like it to (it just maps open_bracket to close_bracket). \nDoes anyone have an insight into what I'm doing wrong here?\n\nA: Your sample appeared to be slightly different than other rules I've looked at.  Here's a version that works for me:\nfile: map_lctl_plus_open_bracket_to_close_bracket.json :\n{\n  \"title\": \"Map Lft-Ctl+Open-Bracket to Close-Bracket\",\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"manipulators\": [\n        {\n          \"description\": \"bracket rule\",\n          \"type\": \"basic\",\n          \"from\": {\n            \"key_code\": \"open_bracket\",\n            \"modifiers\": {\n              \"mandatory\": [\n                \"left_control\"\n              ],\n              \"optional\": [\n                \"caps_lock\"\n              ]\n            }\n          },\n          \"to\": [\n            {\n              \"key_code\": \"close_bracket\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nI wasn't able to determine any way to install the script other than through the \"Import more rules from the internet\" option, but I did figure out how to launch the importer on my own files.\nAssuming you copy the file into /tmp/map_lctl_plus_open_bracket_to_close_bracket.json, pasting the following url into Safari should launch the importer:\nkarabiner://karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/import?url=file%3A%2F%2F%2Ftmp%2Fmap_lctl_plus_open_bracket_to_close_bracket.json\n\nI have fully tested both the file content and the import url within this post, and all worked fine for me.\nGood luck !\n\nEDIT: Immediately after making this post, I think I found where the local filestore is for manually adding rules.\nhttps://github.com/pqrs-org/KE-complex_modifications#local-testing\nThis is the github repo for the rules on the \"Import more rules from the internet\" page.  It shows how to test the rules locally before submitting to the web repository.\nTL;DR:\n$ cp my_rule.json ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications\n\nThe site also confirms the karabiner://... technique I mentioned above.\n\nA: Your own code simply leaves out the key word \"mandatory\" in combination with \"left_control\" – so Karabiner EACH time is content to register only \"open_bracket\" to remap the key to \"close_bracket\".\nEDIT, … much later: you also need to code \"type\": \"basic\" in every manipulator !\nNote: there is a complementary key word \"optional\" that may be default in lack of \"mandatory\"…\n", "Q: iPhone stuck \"Removing iCloud Data...\" after iCloud sign out I have an iPhone 5C and have logged out of iCloud (in order to test in App Purchasing on an App under development).\nThe 'phone indicated \"Removing iCloud data...\", which seems reasonable, but it has been stuck like that for around 30 minutes now, which does not. There is not that much iCloud data on the 'phone.\nPressing Home closes settings and other apps can be run. But the logout process does not appear to be complete as the In App Purchase test does not ask for an account name, just a password. Reopening Settings just brings back the \"Removing iCloud data...\" indication.\nAny thoughts?\n\nA: After an hour I decided there was something clearly wrong, so this is what I did to resolve it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Powered down (long press on the top button, slide to power off),\n\n*Powered up and entered password,\n\n*Opened Settings (I appeared to still be still logged in to iCloud, but iCloud was off - it seems that things were just half completed in the original sign out),\n\n*Signed Out of iCloud again (this time it finished almost immediately).\n\n\nThe In-App-Purchase test then worked fine.\n\nA: What I did was to:\n\n*\n\n*follow what @Ali Beadle's approach\n\n*from another iOS device, go to settings and delete the iCloud Backup for this old device\n\nAfter 2) was done, the signing out is immediately done.\n\nA: If other answers do not work (it was stuck for me for many hours, with repeated attempts to restart and try again), then the only think to do is the following:\n\n*\n\n*Log in to the same iCloud account  in another device\n\n\n*from there to go to the iCloud settings where you should see a list of all the devices you are logged in to.\n\n\n*Select the problem device that is hung logging out and ask it to log out.\nThis seems to get the problem device logged out.\n\n\n*Now, back on the logged out device that was previously hung, try to reset (to factory settings). It will still prompt you that it is erasing data, but it finally seems to work.\n\n(note, if you can't get out of the stuck \"Removing iCloud data\" state before doing step 4, then simply 'kill' the system preferences app by double-clicking on the home button (or swiping up diagonally on face-id devices) and then swiping up).\n", "Q: How to disable file associations to an app before/after installing?

I'm using Internet Sharing to share an Thunderbolt Ethernet connection over Wifi. Is there any danger of IP address conflicts with the devices the on the parent LAN? \nCan devices on the parent LAN ping or directly communicate with the shared devices via their IP addresses? \n\nA: In general yes and no. With your example of Thunderbolt in and WiFi sharing it's more likely you are in the \"no\" camp.\nThe yes is you are bridging more than one device in on the network connection and this warning is provided by Apple in the help:\n\nWARNING: If your Internet connection and your local network use the same port (Ethernet, for example), investigate possible side effects before you turn on Internet sharing. In some cases, sharing your Internet connection disrupts the network. If you use a cable modem, for example, you might unintentionally affect the network settings of other ISP customers, and your ISP might terminate your service.\n\nThe no is when you share from one adapter to another you are being more safe since the DHCP/DNS effects of the added load on the main network since you are operating a new subnet and operating like a router as opposed to switching / bridging in all the connections to the main network.\nIn practice, you will get error messages and the network will fail should you overlap network segments and have IP conflicts. This is more likely if you specify static IP and netmask as opposed to letting DHCP handle things.\nYou'll also want to be sure you're using Private Network ranges (also known as non-routable or RFC1918) on IPv4. If you can move to IPv6 you will have more freedom and less chance of overlap but that's a bit more involved than a simple post here.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network\n", "Q: SUMIF statement with two different conditions (Text based and checkbox) How can I create a SUMIF statement with multiple criteria?\nI have a spreadsheets where I track hours for different clients in one table, and below this table I want to summarize in a summary table the hours per client if that work is finished and if it is billable.\nMy Statement would say, SUMIF:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Textfield ClientName = \"InsertClientName\"  \n\n*Checkbox for billable hours = TRUE  \n\n*Checkbox for finished work = TRUE\n\n\nSo in my imagination it would have to be:\nSUMIF(((ClientName=\"InsertClientName\")&(BillableHours=TRUE)&(FinishedHours=True));Hours)\nHow can I create a formula like this?\nI have browsed the Apple Help Forums and StackExchange, but they mostly show SUMIF Statements with one criteria, or people use IFAND Statements and every row to use that in their SUMIF Statement, but my problem is that I will at least need two criteria in my summary table All hours of ClientX where the hours are checked as billable.\nLooking forward to your answers.\n\nA: Just to make an official answer:\nUse the SUMIFS() function to use 2 or more conditions.\nFrom the documentation:\n\nThe SUMIFS function returns the sum of the cells in a collection where\n  the test values meet the given conditions.\nSUMIFS(sum-values, test-values, condition, test-values…, condition…)\n\n\nA: As pointed out in the comments, I missed the SUMIFS in the functions list because I was focusing on SUMIF. \nI am now using SUMIFS and simply attaching all criteria like in a regular SUMIF function and it works like a charm.\nExample: \nSUMIFS(Hours;Billable;true;Finished;true)\nMeaning: Summarize all hours If BillableHours-Checkbox is TRUE and if WorkFinished-Checkbox is TRUE.\n", "Q: \"QuickLookUIService\" Using Significant Energy After macOS High Sierra upgrade I noticed \"QuickLookUIService\" is always in \"Using Significant Energy\" list.

I am using an Element Case to protect but is this enough for the lens of the camera too? thx\n\nA: Most surface scratches on any camera lens don’t matter a huge amount due to how light focuses. That being said, you’ll want to not scuff too badly or crack the housing. Apple has had a long time to get the hardness right on the glass and cameras, so I would expect you’d have a low chance of issues - especially if you have a case.\nDrops to the body (to the ground from a table / case or not) and internal failure are much more likely to compromise image quality than a physical failure of the lens.\nAlso note - even without a case, the physica of the metal band surrounding the camera make it very hard to hit the part of the glass where the sensor / light enter. Nothing is going to stop an ice pick or diamond ring that targets “ground zero” on the cover, but most unintentional drops and scrapes should be away from the light path by design.\n", "Q: Meaning of AMD-Action:authenticate:SP I am trying to install macOS Sierra from the Mac App Store and can’t get through. \nI get a \n\nAMD-Action:authenticate:SP\n\nerror message.\nWhat does this mean?\n\nA: This is most likely a temporary glitch at Apple's end. \nI'm aware of a number of users who have received the exact same error message during the past few hours while trying to authenticate (i.e. login) with the Mac App Store.

The command diskutil list reports the following.\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *536.9 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Chicken                 150.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n   4:                  Apple_HFS Turkey                  150.0 GB   disk0s4\n   5:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s5\n\nBoth Chicken and Turkey have High Sierra (macOS 10.13.1) installed. I have downloaded the latest Windows 10 (Version 1709, OS Build 16299.15) iso file. Here is what I wish to accomplish.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Windows 10 Pro 64 bit.\n\n*Boot Windows using the EFI boot method.\n\n*Include a Microsoft Reserve partition before the Windows partition.\n\n*Include a Windows Recovery partition after the Windows partition.\n\n\nI would desire to preform the installation without any of the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*No third party software\n\n*No optical drive \n\n*No USB flash drive\n\n*No Boot Camp Assistant\n\n*Without disabling System Integrity Protection (SIP).\n\n\nI would prefer not having to boot to macOS Recovery via the internet, built-in recovery or an USB flash drive macOS installer. But, since macOS Recovery is not a third party tool, I am not opposed to its use.\nSo basically, I am asking how to install Windows when macOS is already installed, but the Boot Camp assistant will not assist in the installation.\n\nA: These are the basic steps needed to install Windows 10 for an EFI boot, when the Boot Camp Assistant will not create the necessary installation partitions.\nI have made the following assumptions.\n\n*\n\n*You wish to install Windows 10 an a internal drive. These instructions will not work for external drive installations.\n\n*Windows will be installed on the primary internal drive. In other words, the drive with the disk identifier of disk0. If you wish to use a different internal drive, you will need to substitute the appropriate disk identifier.\n\n*The drive has a \"Device Block Size\" of  512 bytes. You can determine the size by examining the output from the command diskutil  info  disk0. If the size is 4096 bytes, I will have to modify these instructions.\n\n*Your Mac model is one that Apple supports the installation of Windows 10 through the use of a flash drive.\n\nThe Windows specifications are given below.\n\n*\n\n*Edition: Windows 10 Pro\n\n*Version: 1709\n\n*OS Build: 16299.15\n\n\nNote: To get a better view of the images shown below, either click on an image or open an image in a new window.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Boot Camp Assistant to download the Window Support Software. Look for the \"Action\" pulldown on the Boot Camp Assistant menu bar. On my Mac, these files were downloaded to the ~/WindowsSupport directory.\n\n\n*Create empty space on a drive. This space needs to be outside any APFS or Core Storage containers. Since you already have 235 GB free space at the end of the drive, you can skip this step.\n\n\n*At the end of this free space, allocate about 10 GB for the installation files, followed by 600 MB of space for the Microsoft Windows Recovery Environment (WRE). I usually use the diskutil command to do this. Other combinations  of commands or third party tools can also be employed. The UUID for 10 GB partition should be EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7. The UUID for the 600 MB partition should be DE94BBA4-06D1-4D40-A16A-BFD50179D6AC.\nIn your case, the first step would be to absorb the free space into disk0s4. The command below would accomplish this task.\ndiskutil  resizevolume  disk0s4  R\n\n\nNote: This command will automatically relocate the \"Recover HD\" volume, below disk0s4, to the end of the drive.\n\nThe result is shown below.\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        +536.9 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Chicken                 150.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n   4:                  Apple_HFS Turkey                  385.4 GB   disk0s4\n   5:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s6\n\n\nNote: The resulting identifiers are not in ascending order. This happens occasionally when using the diskutil command. This can be corrected by restarting macOS. In this case, a restart will not be necessary.\n\nNext, issue the command below to create the desired new partitions. The \"Recovery HD\" volume, below disk0s4, will be automatically relocated upwards so the free space can be created between the \"Recovery HD\" and \"WINSTALL\" volumes.\ndiskutil  resizevolume  disk0s4  150G  3  \"Free Space\"  \"dummy\"  224800M  FAT32  \"WINSTALL\"  10G  %DE94BBA4-06D1-4D40-A16A-BFD50179D6AC%  %noformat%  600M\n\n\nNote: A FAT32 format automatically selects a UUID of EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7.\n\nThe result is\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        +536.9 GB   disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Chicken                 150.0 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3\n   4:                  Apple_HFS Turkey                  150.0 GB   disk0s4\n   5:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s5\n   6:       Microsoft Basic Data WINSTALL                10.0 GB    disk0s8\n   7:           Windows Recovery                         561.2 MB   disk0s7\n\n\nNote: The identifiers are not is ascending order. Again, a restart will not be necessary.\n\n\n\n*Format the 10 GB partition FAT32 with the label \"WINSTALL\". In your case, this was done in the previous step, so you can skip this step.\n\n\n*If the 10 GB partition is not mounted, do so now. In your case, the partition should already be mounted.\n\n\n*Mount the Windows iso file and copy the contents to the \"WINSTALL\" volume. In my case, the label \"ESD-ISO\" was used to identify the Windows iso. To perform the copy operation, you will need the enter the cp command from a Terminal application window. Below is the exact command I usually used. If necessary, make the appropriate modifications.\ncp  -Rv  /volumes/ESD-ISO/  /volumes/WINSTALL\n\n\nNote: This command will take a while to complete. Be patient!\n\n\n\n*Copy the Windows Support Software to the \"WINSTALL\" volume. Below is the exact command I usually use. If necessary, make the appropriate modifications.\n\nNote: The trailing / in ~/WindowsSupport/  is significant and must to be included.\n\ncp  -Rv  ~/WindowsSupport/  /volumes/WINSTALL\n\n\n\n*Use the command shown below to rename the AutoUnattend.xml file.\nmv  /volumes/WINSTALL/AutoUnattend.xml  /volumes/WINSTALL/NoAutoUnattend.xml\n\n\n\n*Next, you need to boot from the volume where the Windows installation files reside. Hold down the option key immediately after restarting on your Mac. Release the option when the Startup Manager window appears. Select the icon labeled \"EFI boot\". Next, select the arrow below the \"EFI boot\" label.\n\n\n*Open a Windows Command Prompt window, by following the procedure outlined in this step. Below is an image of what is initially displayed by the Windows 10 installer. Select \"Next\".\n\nIn the image shown below, select \"Repair your computer\".\n\nIn the image shown below, select \"Troubleshoot\".\n\nIn the image shown below, select \"Command Prompt\".\n\nThe result should be the image shown below.\n\n\n\n*Use the command diskpart to finish partitioning disk0. The commands you need to enter are given below.\n\nNote: Sometimes it can take a while for the diskpart command to produce the first prompt. Be patient.\n\ndiskpart\nselect  disk  0\nlist  partition\n\nFrom the output of the command list partition, determine the number for the partition with the type \"Recovery\". In this example, I will assume the number is 7. Your number could be different. The next command selects this partition.\nselect  partition  7\n\nThe next commands effect the \"Recovery\" partition. The proper attributes are set. Next, the partition is formatted NTFS and given the label \"Recovery\".\ngpt  attributes=0x8000000000000001\nformat  fs=ntfs  label=\"Recovery\"  quick\n\nThe next command lists the current volumes. Take note of the drive letter (Ltr) for the volume with label \"WINSTALL\". In this example, I will assume the letter is C. Your letter could be different.\nlist volume\n\nThe command below quits the command diskpart.\nexit\n\n\n\n*Disable the ability to boot from the \"WINSTALL\" volume. This can be accomplished by entering the command shown below. This will rename the folder containing the boot files. If the drive letter, for the \"WINSTALL\" volume, is not C, then make the appropriate substitute when entering the command below.\nrename  C:\\efi  noefi\n\n\n\n*Enter the command below to start the Windows installation. Again, if the drive letter, for the \"WINSTALL\" volume, is not C, then make the appropriate substitute when entering the command below.\nsetup  /unattend:C:\\NoAutoUnattend.xml\n\n\n\n*When the window shown below appears, select the \"Unallocated Space\" above the \"WINSTALL\" partition, then click on the \"Next\" button.\n\n\n\n*Continue with the installation of Windows 10. If the computer boots back to macOS, goto System Preferences and select Windows as your startup disk. Restart the computer to continue initializing Windows 10.\n\n\n*Proceed until you reach the screen where you are prompted for your region. For the 1709 version (OS build 16299.15) of Windows 10, your the screen will appear as shown below.\n\nFor other versions of Windows 10, the screen could appear different. As an example, the screen, for the 1507 version (OS build 10240) of Windows 10, would appear as shown below.\n\n\nNote: At this point, prohibiting your Mac access to the internet is generally a good idea. For example, unplug any ethernet cables or disable Wi-Fi access that does not require encryption.\n\nNext, press the control+shift+F3 keys to restart Windows 10 in Audit mode.\n\n\n*When desktop shown below appears, the Windows Support Software installer should automatically launch. If this does not occur, use the Windows File Explorer to open the Windows Support Software application named \"Setup\". This application can be found in the \"BootCamp\" folder on the \"WINSTALL\" drive. After the installer application completes, allow the computer to restart.\n\n\n\n*Next, boot to the Windows Recovery Environment. Basically, hold down the shift key while selecting to restart Windows.\n\n\n*Navigate to a Windows Command Prompt by following the instructions given below.\nIn the image shown below, select \"Troubleshoot\".\n\nIn the image shown below, select \"Advanced options\"\n\nIn the image shown below, select \"Command Prompt\".\n\nAfter a short delay, you should get an image similar to what is shown below. Choose the Administrator account to continue.\n\nNext, you should get an image similar to what is shown below. Select \"Continue\".\n\nThe result should be the image shown below.\n\n\n\n*Delete the \"WINSTALL\" partition and extend the \"BOOTCAMP\" volume to reclaim the free space. The procedure is given below.\nEnter the following pair of commands to start diskpart and list the current volumes.\ndiskpart\nlist  volume\n\nFrom the output of the command list volume, determine the number for the volume with the label \"WINSTALL\". In this example, I will assume this number is 1. Your number could be different. Also, determine the number for the volume with the label \"BOOTCAMP\". In this example, I will assume this number is 0. Again, your number could be different.\nThe next pair of commands selects the \"WINSTALL\" volume and then deletes the corresponding partition.\nselect  volume  1\ndelete  partition\n\nThe next pair of commands selects the \"BOOTCAMP\" volume and then extends the corresponding partition to consume the deleted space.\nselect  volume  0\nextend\n\nThe next pair of commands quits dispart and closes the window.\nexit\nexit\n\n\n\n*In the image shown below, select \"Continue\" to boot back to Windows 10.\n\n\n\n*You will return to the Administrator's desktop displaying the \"System Preparation Tool\" window. In this window, select \"Shutdown\" under the \"Shutdown options\", as shown below.\n\nNote: Your screen may also include a window labeled \"Boot Camp\", which  can be ignored.\n\n\nNext, select \"OK\" to shutdown the Mac. At this point, you have completed the installation of Windows 10.\n>Note: If you prohibited your Mac access to the internet in an earlier step, you may now want to allow access before turning your Mac back on. In other words, plug in the ethernet cable or turn the Wi-Fi back on.\n\nNext time you turn on your Mac, Windows will start in the \"*Out of the Box Experience*\" mode. This is basically the way a newly purchased PC starts up, when Windows 10 is already installed.\n\n>Note: When asked, be sure to select an Apple keyboard.\n\nIf asked, I can clarify any of the above steps.\n\nA: You can try running a virtual machine for windows. \nVmWare - https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html\nVirtualBox - https://www.virtualbox.org/\nThose two are the top virtual machines for running windows software on top of your Mac instead of using Boot Camp. I'm sure you can also run them off of an external drive as well. Keep in mind though that you will use up some resources depending on how powerful the Mac system is. I would try to map out these 2 softwares to only use at least 1/3rd of your system specifications in processing power and memory if you can. If you have a stronger machine, then you can get away with a 1/4th instead.\n\nA: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/424574/425311\nSee this link for step three APFS container scheme instructions.\n", "Q: Why my Only NAS is shown as NAS-2 in Finder I have been using my NAS named JBPersonalCloud for a while, and I always used Wi-Fi to connect to my home network. \nA few days ago, I connected my Mac to my home network via both Wi-Fi and Ethernet for a couple of minutes to test the Ethernet speed. But then I dropped the wire and remained Wi-Fi only. However, since then, Finder has started to show my NAS as JBPersonalCloud-2. But there is no second JBPersonalCloud, and I am using the original connection interface (Wi-Fi). \n\nI have tried to reboot the NAS, the router, and my Mac.But the -2 suffix still is there. Is there a way that I can change it back? Thanks!\n\nA: There is probably a “JBPersonalCloud” remnant in /Volumes directory. When you connect the NAS, the system sees that there is already a “JBPersonalCloud” and appends the “-2” for the newly connected NAS. \nDisconnect the NAS and delete the remnant with the Finder or Terminal then reconnect the NAS.\nFinder:\nSelect “Go to folder...”, enter /Volumes and tap “Go”. This will open the Volumes folder in a window where you can delete the remnant. Simply drag it to the trash (you may need to authenticate).\nTerminal:\nOpen Terminal.app and type\ncd /Volumes\nls -la\n\nThis will show you the list of drives that are currently mounted. If you see the remnant it can be deleted with...\nsudo rm JBPersonalCloud\n\nIt will ask for an administrator password.\n\nA: Sorry, it looks like I made an assumption there.\nThe name you see in the Sidebar is the name of the device as it is advertised on the network. When you had the device connected to both wired and wireless networks, it probably saw itself on the network and automatically changed the name to avoid a duplicate.\nTo fix it, you will need to go into the administration panel of the NAS and change the name back to JBPersonalCloud. If it appears correct in the admin panel, then change the name to something completely different, and then change it back.\n", "Q: Uninstall \"Logitech app for bluetooth keyboard\" completely on Macbook I installed logitch app for bluetooth keyboard months ago.\nAfter I uninstalled it from 'Application', it remind me to update every time I power on.\nHow to remove it?\n\nA: There are a few things you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder > Applications > Double check that the app is not on the list, if it is, delete it.\n\n*Press Cmd + Alt + Esc > Check if you find any suspect Logitech process running and kill it, then restart the computer\n\n*Reinstall the software and uninstall it again\n\n*Reinstall the software and uninstall it with AppZapper (appzapper.com)\n\n\nLet me know if any of these works.\n\nA: I assume you've just removed the application itself from /Applications, which means that any background apps installed as part of the package are still on the system. The easiest way to resolve this is to just reinstall the application and the use its uninstall option (assuming there is one).\nIf this fails\n\n\n*\n\n*check in your login items if something related to Logitech gets started automatically\n\n*look into /Library/LaunchAgents and /Library/LaunchDaemons for anything related to Logitech (probably called com.logitech.SOMETHING).

Due to issues not related to this question, I've decided to switch it off. Problem is - the server still appears in the Finder sidebar. The original server name was hostname-afp, and for a few weeks, the entry of that name was still visible in the sidebar. About a week ago, the name changed to hostname-2-afp, now it is hostname-3-afp. Where does Finder store the reference to that server, and how do I remove it? \nUnchecking the servers in the Finder preferences does not remove the server from the sidebar. Unchecking the Bonjour Computers does remove it, but I'd like to keep the Bonjour feature enabled, and re-checking Bonjour Computers makes the ghost entry reappear as well. Cmd-/Ctrl-/Whatever-Dragging the entry does nothing.\n(El Capitan / 10.11.6)\n\nA: You probably configured Avahi (a free zero-configuration networking implementation for Linux including multicast DNS/DNS-SD service discovery AKA Bonjour) manually to propagate the AFP-service running on your Linux server in the .local network.\nEven after disabling the AFP service on the Linux server, the Linux server's Bonjour name will still be registered then and thus shown in the Mac's sidebar.\nYou can check this by entering dns-sd -B _afpovertcp._tcp in Terminal.app on the Mac.\nSo remove the manually created config file (here: /etc/avahi/services/afpd.service) and restart the avahi service (probably sudo service avahi-daemon restart) to get rid of the non-existing AFP server name in the Mac's sidebar.\n", "Q: Time Machine restore stuck on “Preparing ” for more than 24 hours, how can I diagnose the nature of the problem? Recently I got myself into quite a pickle that eventually required I format my Mac’s dual-SSD RAID-0 array and restore from a Time Machine backup.\nUnfortunately Time Machine has spent the past 24 hours stuck on “Preparing [destination disk]” and shows absolutely no sign of progress. (The backup is hosted on a Time Capsule-emulating Synology NAS.) There is no information on what is going on behind the scenes, just a solid pulsing blue progress bar that doesn’t even initialize and start creeping rightwards. Before the process began there was some cryptic remark about encryption needing to be disabled subsequently re-enabled as FileVault once restoring is complete, and I authorized the request to erase the destination disk.\nQuite suspiciously it asks me to acknowledge disabling encryption every time I restart the process, which might imply that some latent form of FileVault is lingering, but I have erased the disk several times and each time explicitly instructed the system to format as JHFS+, unencrypted and case-insensitive. \n(Keep in mind that “disk” in this context actually means RAID volume, as the two physical SSDs each host slices of the unified striped RAID-0 volume.)\nI tried dropping into the Terminal because I vaguely remember the \ntmutil\n\ncommmand but it is not present in the barebones toolkit of the macOS installer.\nCan somebody help me figure out what is going on?\nThanks.\n(Tragic aside: while in a panic and desperately trying to unmake my unbootable APFS-formatted RAID array which I created and that got me into this pickle, I accidentally nuked my FireWire-attached CarbonCopyCloner backup, so I’m stuck using Apple’s blunt instrument with no information whatsoever.)\n\nA: I have since discovered that Apple has fully deprecated support for the APFS and that consequentially restoring from a network-attached device (as is my Synology NAS) requires re-sharing with the SMB protocol. \n", "Q: Terminal could not find command \"$ php -v\" I recently try to install ionCube loader and when I tried to check my PHP version via Terminal, it gave me an -bash: $: command not found.\nHow can I fixed that?\n\nA: The $ is just an example for the shell prompt in whatever instruction guide you are reading (used to indicate that you should run the command from your standard user account.

I just got one of the new 12-inch MacBooks and would like to wipe the storage drive. With a conventional SATA drive I'd use the \"ATA Secure Erase\" command which can be sent from a Linux environment using the hdparm utility.\nWith the new NVME drive this does not work. I found a Linux utility called nvme-cli but even with its format option it fails with an error INVALID_OPCODE(1) (looks like the NVME controller rejects the command).\nI've tried multiple permutations of the command and options, including targeting the raw NVME controller /dev/nvme0 or one of its namespaces instead /dev/nvme0n1, different parameters to the -s option, etc. I also bought Parted Magic which claims to be able to secure-erase NVME drives and unfortunately that fails as well.\nI'm currently just doing it the old-school way with shred which writes random data to the drive but obviously this isn't ideal as it's slow and shortens the live of the drive, so I'd love to know the proper method to use in the future.\nRegards.\n\nA: The proper / official / thorough way to sanitize an Apple SSD is to enable FileVault before you copy any data to it. When you shred the encryption keys - the data is cryptographically erased instantly.\n\nNote: With a solid-state drive (SSD), secure erase options are not available in Disk Utility.

This discovery came after my latest question: High Sierra's External Display bug heats Macbook's, damaged my Retina Screen, what can I do?\nI use my macbook on a stand with good airflow, after High Sierra, I noticed unusual high heating along with poor gpu performance, afterwards I noticed screen damage, and now, I discovered that my macbook is physically swollen, 2-3mm's I'm guessing\nThe issues could be unrelated to High Sierra, yet, it would be too big of a coincidence if it's not the cause, as things were breezy beforehand\nHere's a picture of the issue: https://imgur.com/a/feBG7\n\nThe trackpad area is swollen, the trackpad doesn't click any more, the battery reports \"Normal\" condition (Cycle count: 12), the lid doesn't close any more, but everything luckily works for now\nI assume it's the battery that's swollen, but even with the high heating I complain about, the GPU temperatures was 80C at most and enclosure temps weren't extremely high\nIt's a shocking issue for me, I'm wondering whether there is a solution other than buying a new Macbook, unsure how to approach the issue in general, and since I use the device daily, really don't want to part with it even for repairs or inspection, I'm located in Turkey\nAlso curious why I experienced these issues with High Sierra and whether anyone else has similar experiences\n\nA: Make a full backup and get it into a store/repair shop for inspection.\n\nA: It shouldn’t be shocking that this could happen. The software change is pure coincidence. When lithium batteries fail - they offgas and there are “airbags” to contain the gas but the case / trackpad will be deformed by this safety design. Overcharging is a safety issue - back up immediately - get it to service and stop charging the Mac. See the links back to 2007 - Apple’s newer batteries are far more resistant to this, but still the chemistry and potential to swell exist.\n", "Q: iPhone Case Manufactuerer - Unlabelled but have logo A family member has a really old iphone case that is pretty nice and I'm trying to find the company behind it.

Now I get this error message: The scanner is in use by application '(null)'.\nAnd I get it both from Preview as well as the stuff I used before.\n\n\nIs there a good way to fix this? I.e. without rebooting.\n\nA: I encountered the same question on my MacBook Pro.  I solved it by changing to another USB  port; I didn't have to restart.\n", "Q: Macbook keeps rebooting on installation USB after trying to reinstall - EFI partition empty I've got a 12-inch MacBook I would like to reinstall. Before doing so I've cleared the storage drive, reset the SMC and NVRAM. I've got a macOS High Sierra USB ready from which it successfully boots.\nThe issue is that after booting from the USB, partitioning the internal drive and going through the \"Install macOS High Sierra\", it reboots the machine (presumably to continue the installation) - the problem is the machine just starts from the same USB drive and brings me back to \"macOS Utilities\".\nI've tried this multiple times already and no luck. Restarted the machine, cleared NVRAM once again, etc. \nThe main storage drive is not in \"Startup disks\" after it restarts, which I'm not sure if it's the expected behaviour. If I shut down the machine and unplug the USB, it gives me the \"question mark folder icon\" which implies there's nothing bootable on the storage drive, as if the installer was failing at correctly putting the initial files in there.\nLooking into the EFI partition of the internal drive I can see there is absolutely nothing, which would explain what's happening - why doesn't the installer put anything in there though?\n\nA: Here I assume your internal drive is a single HDD or SSD. In other words, I assume you do not have a Fusion drive.\nWhile booted to the USB installer, open a Terminal application window.\nEnter the following commands to reinitialize your internal drive. Substitute the desired name for your installation volume for the name \"Tommy\".\ndiskutil  unmountdisk  disk0\ngpt  destroy  /dev/disk0\ngpt  create  /dev/disk0\ndiskutil  partitiondisk  disk0  apfs  \"Tommy\"  R\n\nExit the Terminal application and try installing macOS.\n\nA: This was possibly a bug in the installer not copying the files properly on a brand-new APFS-formatted drive (as the drive was completely wiped beforehand, including the partition table) - formatting the drive as HFS+ (which is not displayed in Disk Utility but can be done with the diskutil command) fixed the issue, and the partition got converted back to APFS during installation.\n", "Q: Updating SSL root certs on old Mac (running Lion) My father-in-law reported an \"Invalid SSL certificate\" suddenly started appearing on his online banking website.\nAfter verifying it's not a website issue (it loads correctly on other computers), I understood that the root certificate of the website certificate is not being trusted probably because too new and the Mac is not being updated anymore.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is my understanding correct?\n\n*If yes, is there a safe way to download new root certificates that are being added to recent Macs?\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, if the certificate is being accepted by other, newer machines, the issue it does seem likely that your father's machine isn't receiving updates to its root certificate trust store.  I wasn't able to  verify that Lion isn't receiving those but I think it's a fair guess.\n\n*Well, that's a harder question to answer.  If you look here and here, it does seem like it's possible to do, but you'd need to find the keychain files from a newer OS and pull them into Lion.  It's really just a guess as to whether the steps in that answer would work for you since it's 10.8.  I actually would advise figuring out which certificate shows up as expired on your machine (or which root certificate is missing/untrusted), and downloading that specific certificate and appropriately trusting it, first.  But if you want to, you could also backup your system and give that second answer a shot.  Hopefully you have access to a more recent macOS installer you can extract files from.\n\nA: Inspecting the certificate at https://www.intesasanpaolo.com, you can see that it uses the root certificate Chambers of Commerce Root - 2008. Upon inspecting the System Roots in Keychain Access on a Mac running Mac OS X Lion, this root certificate is trusted by the OS by default. This means that Safari should properly trust this website without prompting about an \"Invalid SSL certificate\".\nI would first verify that you see this certificate in the System Roots and that it has not been accidentally set to Never Trust.\nYou can also securely obtain the root certificate used by this website at https://www.camerfirma.com/clavespublicas. You specifically need the certificate\nChambers of Comerce ROOT - 2008 -> SHA1 78 6a 74 ac 76 ab 14 7f 9c 6a 30 50 ba 9e a8 7e fe 9a ce 3c\n\nDirect Link\nWhen you open this certificate, you can select to install it to the System keychain.

Is there a way to adjust MacBook Pro's Touch Bar brightness?\nMacBook Pro, 13\", 2016, macOS Sierra 10.12.6\n\nA: So far, I agree the answer is \"you can't\".\nHere's what I've been able to determine about how the touchbar brightness controlled.\nThe ambient light sensor for the keyboard and touchbar are located under the top cover. There are two of them – one located behind each (left and right) speaker grill. I believe, they've been located there as far back as there have been keyboard backlights on MacBooks.\nAn easy way to check this out for yourself (and characterize the behavior of the touchbar brightness vs ambient light) is to first, turn off \"Automatically adjust brightness\" option in the Display preference pane*, then, in a dimly lit room, shine a flashlight over either one or both of the speaker grills. There is a bit of a delay, but afterwards, you'll see the touchbar go to its full brightness. If automatic keyboard brightness is enabled, you'll see the keyboard backlight get brighter (though with less delay).\nBottom line, at least as of the latest Mojave beta and the latest 2018 MBP (15\"), there is no apparent way to control the touchbar brightness. Until I discovered this, I was a bit frustrated trying to control it via either the manual setting or whatever the system was trying to do when set to automatic control.\n*The reason that I suggest disabling the automatic control for the display is it will get rather bright in response to the flashlight being waved around and just confuse trying to see what the touchbar and keyboard are doing. The ambient sensor for the display is the one near the camera at the top of the display.\nEdit: Damn. I must've had the flashlight up too far above the top cover, and light was leaking to the sensor up in the lid. The TouchBar's brightness is indeed controlled using that sensor. I kind of shot myself in the foot by disabling the display auto adjust feature and thought there couldn't be any input from bezel sensor.\nYes, and the keyboard backlight too. But, I do know the original backlit keyboards did use sensors behind the grills. I've seen 'em. They're real. Really.\n\nA: You can't. It may automatically adjust based on external lighting conditions if the \"Adjust keyboard brightness in low light\" option is on in System Preferences>Keyboard, but I haven't experimented to confirm this.\n\nA: You can put a small sticker, or something similar, over the ambient light sensor on a Touch Bar equipped Mac to set the brightness to its lowest setting.\nNote that the ambient light sensor is the smaller circle beside the camera's circle. You can test it out by putting your finger over just the smaller circle and noticing the Touch Bar's brightness reduce.\n\n\nA: \nshine a flashlight over either one or both of the speaker grills.\n\nthis is unfortunately untrue from my own experimentation on a MBP 15,5 (2019 13\") the light sensor for keyboard and Touch Bar is located next to the camera on your display bezel. \nThere is no way to control the brightness of the Touch Bar, however, to make the thing more apparent you should reduce the brightness of your display and keyboard backlight. this will allow your pupils to dilate and let in more light. this only works in the dark though... \nIf I manage to find something that will help (In the form of a program) I will post it here as I would personally like to adjust the Touch Bar brightness independently of the display and keyboard, as sometimes I am in a dark room and have the display all the way up, so can't see the Touch Bar... \n", "Q: Media keys not working for iTunes (pause/play, skip buttons) I am being driven crazy by the fact that my media keys aren't working for iTunes. Such a pain! How can I fix this? I've tried the whole Chrome Extensions thing, that being I deleted all my extensions. Still, nothing has fixed this. Thanks to all who reply!\n\nA: This is an intentional change in macOS High Sierra. Rather than the media keys always controlling iTunes, they will now control whatever media is playing at a given moment.\n9To5Mac has detailed a way to change this behavior with a third-party application, macOS High Sierra Media Key Enabler for iTunes and Spotify:\n\nApple just released High Sierra and it brought good things and annoying things : they changed the behaviour of the media controller keys, they no longer control itunes, they control the video playback in safari. This pissed off a lot of people including me, so I just created a menu bar app to proxy media key events to iTunes/Spotify while Apple fixes this.

Two days ago, the Gmail connection failed (other accounts are loading normally).\nWhen I clicked on accounts offline in the top corner, it explained that the login to Gmail had failed, and I should re-enter my password. \nHere's the login screen it brought me to. \n\nThen I entered my password (which I've checked several times for correctness) and got a grey screen of death. \n\nThis has repeated many times over the past two days, even when left alone for several minutes to resolve the grey screen.\nOther attempts to re-enter the login information, for example through Mail → Accounts have led to the same result.\nWhat can I do to resolve this?\nEdit: Tried removing and re-adding the account. Now it freezes at the last step, after clicking done (shown with done pressed)\n\n\nA: For anyone having the same problem, it turns out that Gmail blocks out-of-date mail clients from connecting and isn't too keen on informing users when it decides to do this. The solution was to update my mail client by upgrading to macOS High Sierra.\n\nA: This has been happening to me ever since I updated to High Sierra. I had added 2-step verification to my Gmail accounts, but had to remove it. \nHoping that resolves the issue but not holding my breath.\n\nA: Weird. I just updated osx, and after that my mail would not connect to gsuite whatever I tried. In the end I tried another email client (spark) and that solved it. Well, seems like a good alternative anyways.\n", "Q: How can I let apps make changes using TouchID on MacBook Pro? How can I allow an app to make changes without typing in the password, but using TouchID on the Touch Bar instead?\nMacBook Pro, 13\", 2016, macOS Sierra 10.12.6\nExample:\n\nA: This is not one of the supported features of Touch ID on macOS - at least not yet.\nWith Touch ID on your MBP, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*unlock your Mac\n\n*make purchases using your Apple ID (i.e. from the App Store and iTunes)\n\n*use Apple Pay\n\n\nUndoubtedly as time goes by, more functionality will be added to Touch ID on macOS - but the ability to use it to allow apps to make changes to macOS isn't available yet.\n\nA: Not exactly the situation you asked, but this blog shows how to enable Touch ID to authorize sudo terminal commands. I've been trying to find the version of this command that enables the same thing for Application changes, but no luck so far.\nhttps://sixcolors.com/post/2020/11/quick-tip-enable-touch-id-for-sudo/\nFrom Dan Moren's blog above-\n\n*\n\n*First, open up Terminal. Navigate to the directory where the system stores the list of PAMs by typing cd /etc/pam.d/ and open the sudo file there in your favorite command-line text editor.\n\n\n*Once you’ve opened it, add the following below the first line (you’ll see the headers under which each of the entries goes):\nauth sufficient pam_tid.so\nThat line basically tells the sudo command that the Touch ID authentication module is sufficient to authorize the user, which is all you need to do.\n", "Q: How can I always allow TouchID to unlock MacBook? Sometimes, my MacBook Pro (2016, 13\", macOS Sierra 10.12.6) would not let me unlock it with TouchID, saying \"password is required to use TouchID\".\nIs there any way I could always allow TouchID to unlock my MacBook?\n\nA: No there isn't - at least not yet.\nThe Touch ID rules for macOS dictate that each time you boot up or restart, or if you log out, you need to type your password to log back into your user account.\nIn other words, once you're already logged in, you can use Touch ID when prompted for your password.\n", "Q: Strange graphics behaviour after rm -rf / I've received sudo rm -rf on my machine (MacBook Pro 2017 13\", Sierra). As it's expected, most of applications disappeared or stopped working.\nI had to reinstall MacOS completely from the recovery partition, and it helped, but since then I have some strange graphic bugs in some applications. Mostly, games -- Steam and League of Legends.

Any assumption of what could I loose with rm -rf that causes such behaviour AND is not fixed by system reinstallation, and how to restore it, would be greatly appreciated. I even tried upgrading to High Sierra, no difference. Before the sudo rm -rf both applications worked fine.\n\n\nA: The reason is my case-sensitive system disk partition. Even though it's officially supported, some applications tend to forget it and hope the partition is case-insensitive.\nFor most applications (including Steam and League of Legends) appropriate solution is to\n\n*\n\n*Create new case-insensitive partition, name it somehow, e.g. CaseNoSense\n\n\n*Transfer your application from /Applications/theapp.app to /Volumes/CaseNoSense/theapp.app\n\n\n*Move your application support folder to this partition: mv \"~/Application Support\" \"/Volumes/CaseNoSense/\"\n\n\n*Create symbolic link for the application support folder: ln -s \"/Volumes/CaseNoSense/Application Support\" \"~/Application Support\"\n\n\n*[Optional]  Create symbolik link for the application: ln -s \"/Volumes/CaseNoSense/theapp.app\" \"/Applications/theapp.app\"\nNow start the application, it might work as intended.\n", "Q: Intel management engine - is macOS vulnerable?

Though at this point I can't confirm or deny that macs run Intel firmware or not for ME, the other answers to this question seem to suggest that they do run Intel firmware.  \nI dare say that Apple machines are all vulnerable, and are affected in a much more dramatic way than other machines that already have patches available for download at the time of this post.  The reason is that many many macs seem have outdated Intel firmware, assuming they have it and the python scripts other people are using to check the version of their firmware's aren't erroneous, or alluding to custom Apple written firmware for the ME hardware that is present in the machine. \nKlanomath, your machine seems to be fairly screwed with an old as 9.5.3 version of ME firmware.  That 11.6.5 firmware on another machine is also clearly vulnurable as well, as per the intel audit, as seen here: \nhttps://security-center.intel.com/advisory.aspx?intelid=INTEL-SA-00086&languageid=en-fr \nYou need to update to 11.8.0 or up.

Especially because Intel ME allows for remote access even when a system is powered off, though that might only be with AMT software, which apparently Apple does not have. \n\nA: First: it's not macOS itself which is vulnerable in the first place but the firmware and related hardware is affected. In a second step your system may be attacked though.\nOnly some of the impacted processors are installed in Macs:\n\n\n*\n\n*6th and 7th generation Intel® Core™ Processor Family\n\n\nI checked some random firmware files with the tool MEAnalyzer and found at least some containing Intel Management Engine code:\nThis is the MacBook Pro Retina Mid 2017:\nFile:     MBP143_0167_B00.fd (3/3)\n\nFamily:   CSE ME\nVersion:  11.6.14.1241\nRelease:  Production\nType:     Region, Extracted\nSKU:      Slim H\nRev:      D0\nSVN:      1\nVCN:      173\nLBG:      No\nPV:       Yes\nDate:     2017-03-08\nFIT Ver:  11.6.14.1241\nFIT SKU:  PCH-H No Emulation SKL\nSize:     0x124000\nPlatform: SPT/KBP\nLatest:   Yes\n\nAn ME entry in Family denotes Management Engine code.\nIn an EFIFirmware2015Update.pkg 2 of 21 firmware files contain Intel Management Engine code which may be affected by CVE-2017-5705|5708|5711|5712.\nIn the macOS 10.13.1 update.pkg 21 of 46 firmware files contain Intel Management Engine code which may be affected by CVE-2017-5705|5708|5711|5712.\nOne source and a linked source therein state that \"Intel ME is baked in every CPU but according to The Register (0) the AMT part is not running on Apple hardware.\" AMT is also related to an older vulnerability and the Register link refers to this. Then the firmware may not be affected by CVE-2017-5711|5712 because AMT isn't present on Macs.\nBut some of the recent vulnerabilities don't require AMT.\n\nIn my opinion it's unclear whether Macs are affected by the Intel Q3’17 ME 11.x vulnerability - probably only Apple can tell. At least Macs are not affected by the SPS 4.0 and the TXE 3.0 bugs!\n\nA: Excerpt from INTEL-SA-00086: \"The attacker gains physical access by manually updating the platform with a malicious firmware image through flash programmer physically connected to the platform’s flash memory.\"\nUnless your Apple product is operating in a public lab where nefarious people may gain physical access to the device, you probably don't have much to worry about.

The machine in question is a mid-2010 Macbook Pro w/ the Intel Core 2 Duo (P8600 2.4GHz).\nI'm not entirely clear on whether or not the memory compression feature in OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and beyond takes advantage of compression instruction sets in the newer Intel processors. That being said, is it implemented completely in software and would work on all Apple hardware capable of running 10.9 and beyond, regardless of processor, or does it require a more modern processor with these instructions that speed-up the compression? An example of a compatibility issue with processors is the AESNI instruction set in the newer Intel architecture that greatly speeds up AES and hashing routines, but is unavailable in a lot of AMD processors and the Intel Core Duo series.\nAny information that can shed light on this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\nA: It is implemented completely in software, yes (for any meaningful definition of this). Obviously you will need a physical CPU to run the code in practice.\nThe feature does not require the AESNI instruction set. It only requires a x86_64 CPU (i.e. 64-bit CPU) which is anyways already a requirement for running Mavericks.\nYou can find the source code for the compression algorithm here:\nhttps://github.com/aosm/xnu/blob/9653931b282e653805655cc56831195d0fb162aa/osfmk/x86_64/WKdmCompress_new.s\n", "Q: Transfering small tidbits of information from Mac to iPhone You found that the book you were going to order online is in stock at your neighborhood bookstore (it's a near fantasy for your neighborhood bookstore to stock a book you actually want, but it's just an example!

As I understand it Time Machine will create the folder structure and create a copy of all of the files that are to be included in the Time Machine backup during the first backup. After that a hard link is created during every subsequent backup for files that have not been changed.\nThe question that I have is how files that have been changed since the last backup are backed up in the subsequent backup. I thought that it copied the entire modified file to the TM backup, but it appears that that isn't how TM works and I was hoping for some clarification.\nDuring a recent practice test that I took for ACSP 10.12 it asked if, for a 5MB file if it was modified such that the new version was 6MB, would the TM have a separate 5MB and 6MB file or would it backup the 1MB difference between the two files and just retain the 1MB addition in the most recent TM backup. I figured that, though it may take up additional space to have a separate copy of the 5MB version and the 6MB version, it would provide a safety net in the event that an early version were deleted or corrupted - effectively ruining every subsequent version of that file. But the practice test said that it just saves the 1MB difference.\nI was just looking for some clarification to help improve my understanding. Thanks in advance for any help!\n\nA: After the initial Time Machine backup of the entire volume, sans exclusions, Time Machine always backs up the entire file of each file that has changed or was created since the last backup, not just the changed part. \n", "Q: I want to update my iPhone 5s from iOS 9 to iOS 10, not iOS 11.

Is it possible to update to an earlier version of ios or do i just have to update to ios 11? Thank you!\n\nA: No, this is no longer possible. While you may have previously downloaded iOS 10, or may be able to download it through other online sources, installing it is no longer possible as Apple has stopped signing installations of iOS 10.\nTypically, when a new version of iOS launches, the window for installing the previous version of iOS is about two weeks. \n", "Q: disable single inbox for multiple MS Exchange email accounts in Mail app on a Mac A colleague added an extra MS exchange email account to her Mac Mail app.\nUnfortunately, the emails to this address are being saved into the inbox for the other MS exchange email account.\nHow do we separate the two inboxes please?\nThanks.\n\nA: You can view each inbox separately.

Is there any way to make my macbook pro pretend to be a headset for the PS4?\n\nA: It's possible to use your Mac as a speaker for other Apple devices (e.g. using software to turn your Mac into an Airplay receiver). However, there's no current way to turn it into a Bluetooth speaker for devices such as a PS4. \nI suspect this would be possible in theory, however there probably just isn't the demand. The reason why software exists to turn your Mac into a receiver for other Apple devices is that there is a lot of demand for this, especially from iOS users, so various developers have answered the call over the years.\n", "Q: How to \"repair\" a PDF that opens in Acrobat Reader but not Preview I have a PDF that won't open in Preview; it gives this error message:\n\nHowever, it will open in Acrobat Reader, but cannot be resaved, or saved with a new file name from Reader:\n\nAs I can see all the pages (or most of them at least!) from this PDF, there must be some way to get them into a file that Preview can open. I can do this by copying pages from Reader one-at-a-time, but the PDF has 500 pages.\nWhat is the easiest and cheapest way to export all these pages, and create a new PDF, from Acrobat Reader?\nEDIT: I'd rather not have to sign up for online Adobe services...\n\nA: I just had exactly the same problem. A filled-in PDF form from our tax service displays as follows in almost all PDF readers except Adobe's:\n\nNot one of the normal solutions works. Every single macOS-native save-to-pdf or print-to-pdf option from within Acrobat Reader fails with \"Saving a PDF file when printing is not supported.\"\nI ended up having to use PDF-XChange Editor in one of my VMWare Windows guest images to open the offending PDF 1.7 form and then to print to the \"Microsoft Print to PDF\" printer driver.\nA similar driver for macOS which could trick Adobe Reader into thinking that it was just a printer could also work, but I did not have more time to investigate other options.\nThere's NO reason for Adobe to make it this difficult to export a PDF form to read-only rendered version. Well, it could be because Reader has a truly subpar UI on macOS, so the company has to make use of alternative techniques to retain users.\n\nA: Try printing the PDF from Acrobat Reader and then choose to print to (save as) a PDF. Note - you should not choose Save from the File menu in Acrobat Reader, instead you must choose Print. When asked which printer to print to, you can select to open as a PDF in Preview instead.\n\nA: You could try the Ghostscript tools pdf2ps & ps2pdf from the commandline.  \n\n\n*\n\n*pdf2ps input.pdf output.ps to convert to a PostScript file\n\n*ps2pdf input.ps output.pdf to convert to a pdf file\n\n\n*\n\n*You can install Ghostscript with homebrew \n\n*or use MacTeX\nThe MacTeX way gives you a 3 GB installer that will install by default a ghostscript package & lots of other things like a TeX folder in your /Applications folder.

However, this may change in the future.\n\nThere's also a pstopdf tool installed by Apple that can convert PostScript to pdf. Sometimes the ps2pdf tools are unsuccessful and the pstopdf tool works.\nMy experience is:\nConvert pdf's with pdf2ps and convert the resulting PostScript file to pdf with pstopdf.

And if your MBP is still under warranty, I wouldn't think twice about calling Apple. They can assist over the phone and may even be able to run some diagnostics remotely. And, if necessary, depending on where you live they may be able to send someone out to you if it can't be resolved over the phone. The worst case scenario is you will need to bring it in to Apple or one of their authorised repairers.\n\nWhat are the most likely causes for this\n\nNow this is not so easy to answer, as there is a multitude of possible causes for this behaviour. However, there are a few things you can try yourself. See below.\nRun Apple Diagnostics\nFollow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the D key and keep it down until you see the Diagnostics screen appear\n\n*Wait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)\n\n*Once complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*a No issues found message\n\n*a brief description of any errors found plus further instructions\n\n\n*If the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are\n\n\nNote: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete. \nRegardless, take a note of what happens as this will be useful if/when you contact Apple.\nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*If there's anything you've identified that will normally cause a crash, then try repeating those steps while in Safe Mode to see if you can get your MBP to crash again. If there isn't, try using your MBP for long enough to see if you can get it to crash.\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal\n\n*Once again, test to see if your still crashes\n\n\nIf you find that your MBP works fine while in Safe Mode, but not when booted normally, then let me know and I'll explain the process of identifying the culprit (it's likely to be a login item, corrupted font, or kernel extension).\n\nA: I concur with monomeeth.  As for why a kernel might panic, here’s a few of my personal favorites:\n\n\n*\n\n*loading a kernel extension\n\n*unloading a kernel extension\n\n*attempting to divide by zero at the kernel level, not the user-application level\n\n*using the PF packet filter and sharing an internet connection to wlan ( worked under Sierra - not sure if high Sierra still vulnerable...)\n\n*tampering with kernel-reserved memory space ( explains the first two in this list )\n\n\nJust my two cents worth, there exist plenty of other ones...\nF.\n", "Q: Turn off Skype 8.11 chat notification sounds I upgraded to Skype 8.11 from 7.x and found that I am now getting audio notifications when I receive a chat message.

My Macbook is running macOS High Sierra, which is apparently buggy with Octane at the moment. \nI purchsed a WD easystore, partitioned it to be Mac OS Extended (Journaled), and put the macOS Sierra installer on it (I downloaded this from the App Store).

When I go to System Preferences > Startup Disk, it's not even there as an option.\nPlease help me - getting verrrry frustrated as I have no idea what I'm doing. Thanks in advance!\n\nA: Assuming that you don't have an additional thumb drive (according to Apple with at least 12 GB - I got it to work with a 8 GB thumb drive) I recommend the following method:\n\n\n*\n\n*erase and repartition your WD easystore to two Mac OS Extended (Journaled) partitions - a bigger one first with the name \"Sierra\" and the size (total_size_of_external_drive - 12 GB) and a much smaller second one with the name \"Sierra_Installer\" and a size of ~12 GB. The partition scheme has to be GUID! If your MacBook's main partition already has the name \"Sierra\"  choose another name for the first partition of the external drive. Below I assume the bigger volume on the external drive has the name \"Sierra\".\nExample: if your external drive has a size of 1 TB, then the first partition \"Sierra\" should have a size of 988 GB and the second \"Sierra_Installer\" partition one of ~12 GB.\n\n*re-download the \"macOS Sierra installer.app\" on your MacBook\n\n*open Terminal.app in /Applications/Utilities\n\n*enter the command:\nsudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Sierra_Installer --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Sierra.app\n\nhit the Enter key, enter your password (which won't be visible because it's masked), hit the Enter key again and let do createinstallmedia its job.\n\n*Quit Terminal after the job is done and any other app.\n\n*Reboot to \"Sierra_Installer\" (e.g. by choosing it in System Preferences > Startup Disk or by hitting the alt-key while booting and choosing Sierra_Installer)\n\n*After a successful boot of the \"Installer Boot Partition\" install macOS Sierra to the volume \"Sierra\".\n\n*After a successful installation configure Sierra.\n\n*Finally remove the partition \"Sierra_Installer\" with Disk Utility and resize the volume \"Sierra\" to the full size of the disk.\n\n\n\nThe method proposed by user3439894 in a comment to your question is preferred though: create an Installer Thumb Drive, boot to it and install Sierra to a single-partitioned external drive.\n\nA: Take a copy with Carbon Copy Cloner\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot MacOs High Sierra from Mac.\n\n*Format WD EasyStore to \"Mac OS Extended\" using Disk Utility.\n\n*Use a bootable backup software such as CCC5 to copy the drive you are currently booted from onto the WD Easystore\n\n*Restart, when you hear the startup sound hold 'alt' or 'opt'\n\n*Choose WD EasyStore as boot drive.\n\n", "Q: Replacing a cracked MacBook Retina Display with third-party hardware? I need to replace a cracked Retina Display on a 15″ MacBook (2015), but I do not want to buy Apple's expensive replacement parts. Is there third-party hardware that I could use? \"Retina Displays\" are simply high-PPI IPS or OLED displays, which many other brands of laptops also use.\n\nA: Apple doesn't sell replacement parts to users, only to their authorized resellers and service centers. However, some used Apple screens are available in the aftermarket, as, for instance from ifixit.com. \nI think your choices are:\nA) Have Apple or an authorized shop replace the cracked screen;\nB) Buy a used screen and install it yourself;\nC) Buy a used MacBook (perhaps you could find one with broken electronics, or a bad keyboard or inoperative logic board) and take your chances that its screen will be good;\nD) Find a non-authorized repair shop that can replace the screen (thus offloading the \"where to get the part\" challenge onto the shop, along with the risk that the \"new\" screen won't work); or \nE) recycle your MacBook and replace it.\n\nA: The Chinese batteries are fairly terrible. On the other hand, I replaced my girlfriend's MBP 13\" 2013 retina screen with a Chinese housing (top is plastic and not aluminum). Amazingly enough the screen colour-corrected (BasiCColor) better with the Chinese IPS screen than with the Apple original. She likes to keep a clear plastic cover on the top of her MBP. Under the plastic armour, it's impossible to tell that casing is not aluminum.\nBetter than new for less than $150. Don't give up on your vintage MBP 13 Retina.

However, it should only show up when your search is rather vague (i.e., searching for the word \"the\" would surely trigger Top Hits). The more specific your search is, the more likely your results will NOT include Top Hits. Be careful, though - sometimes trying to be too specific may yield no results at all! When I search my email, I try to use as few search terms as possible and always include words that are distinct to the content I'm searching for.\nI realize this probably isn't the answer you were looking for, but hopefully I've helped you minimize the likelihood of Top Hits showing up when you search your mail.\n", "Q: Modifier Keys not working for swapping Option/Command on external USB Keyboard I have been using the Modifier Keys option for a few years.

Doesn't matter if plugged into battery or not.\nTerminal has diagnosed the shutdown cause as -102 (there are also a few -128 causes). I can't find what this cause means, does anyone know?\n\nA: The -128 cause is fairly well known. It's not a precise indicator as there's a number of possible causes for this. However, the most common relate to:\n\n\n*\n\n*problems with RAM\n\n*that your battery is past its life cycle\n\n*the SMC initiating a shutdown due to a sensor reading (e.g. excessive temperature)\n\n\nNow, as for the -102 cause, I don't ever recall seeing that as a shutdown cause before. In fact, the only times I've seen a -102 error of any sort is either relating to Scrap Manager errors (which would be unrelated to your situation as it's related to carbon programming), or relating to a memory parity error.\nI would run Apple Hardware Test (AHT) to see if it finds any obvious hardware problems.\nRun Apple Hardware Test\nYour model MBP uses Apple Hardware Test. It would have originally shipped with AHT on a DVD, so you'd need to insert this into your optical drive and follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MacBook Pro \n\n*Restart your MacBook Pro\n\n*Press and hold the D key before the gray startup screen appears.\n\n*After a while, Apple Hardware Test (AHT) will start.\n\n*When prompted, select your language and click the right arrow. \n\n*When the AHT console appears, you can choose to run Basic tests by clicking the Test button. However, I suggest you select the \"Perform extended testing\" checkbox before you click the Test button.\n\n*Your test results will appear in the window in the bottom-right of the console.\n\n\nNote 1: that the extended test will take some time. Take a note of the results and report back. \nNote 2: If pressing and holding the D key at Step 3 doesn't work, or you can't find the DVD, then at Step 3 press and hold both the OptionD keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.\n", "Q: How to count files in a folder using AppleScript?

After that, some of my photos have been lost. How can I find them again and then restore them?\n\nA: Sounds like the photos you lost were stored in iCloud and not on your phone, so they disappeared when you turned off iCloud Photo Library.\nYou can either enable it again, or find them at www.icloud.com (click on the photos app once you login).\nThis can also be done in the desktop photos app if you have a mac.\nFrom there you can share these photos, maybe you could email them to yourself 1 by 1 and save them to your phone.\n", "Q: Shortcut for bullets/numbered formatting in Powerpoint for Mac The shortcuts page in the PowerPoint docs does not mention any shortcuts for formatting a paragraph as bullets/numbered - and how to then reset a paragraph back to normal/un-bulletted.\nI am guessing such shortcuts do exist .. does anyone happen to know them?\n\nA: Because PowerPoint brings up a dialog showing several options, it seems the best that can be done is to create a custom shortcut to the dialog then select the desired formatting. \n\nTo create a custom keyboard shortcut for PowerPoint:\nOpen the System Preferences either by searching Spotlight, clicking the  Menu, selecting from the dock or your favorite method of getting to it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Select Keyboard in the settings (Typically on the second row of icons)\n\n*Select the Shortcuts tab\n\n*Select App Shortcuts from the list on the left\n\n*Click the + button at the bottom\n\n*Change the Applicaton: to Microsoft PowerPoint.app using the dropdown\n\n*type EXACTLY as the command appears in PowerPoint's Format Menu. In this case Bullets and Numbering… ← Note that is not 3 dots but an ellipsis.  Type ⌥+; or use the Character Viewer if needed to get it.\n\n*In the Keyboard Shortcut input type the desired shortcut.  As an example: ⌃⌥B\nNow, back in PowerPoint select the paragraph and evoke the dialog with the shortcut.  Unfortunately, Microsoft does not allow (that I can find) keyboard navigation of this dialog to select the desired bullet style so one will have to use the mouse at this point.\nEDIT: Note that one can change Full Keyboard Access in the Keyboard settings.  Changing to All Controls may allow navigating using the tab key in the bullets dialog box.\nSee illustration below.\n\n\n\n\nA: AltHUTabEnter\nIt's clunky, but it works and it fits the hand surprisingly well.\nWorks in PowerPoint 2019 as well.\n", "Q: Convert a PC path to Mac path with AppleScript I am a lone Mac user in a company that uses PCs...I often get file paths that I need to manually navigate.

I would like to install a VirtualBox guest of macOS High Sierra on my MacBook Pro that is also running macOS High Sierra so that I can experiment with MDMs, etc. without rendering my primary laptop unusable.  I've created an ISO of High Sierra by downloading the installer from the Mac AppStore and running the following commands:\nhdiutil create -o /tmp/HighSierra.cdr -size 7316m -layout SPUD -fs HFS+J\n\nhdiutil attach /tmp/HighSierra.cdr.dmg -noverify -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/install_build\n\nasr restore -source /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app/Contents/SharedSupport/BaseSystem.dmg -target /Volumes/install_build -noprompt -noverify -erase\n\nhdiutil detach /Volumes/OS\\ X\\ Base\\ System\n\nhdiutil convert /tmp/HighSierra.cdr.dmg -format UDTO -o /tmp/HighSierra.iso\n\nmv /tmp/HighSierra.iso.cdr ~/Desktop/HighSierra.iso\n\nI've also created my VirtualBox guest on VirtualBox 5.2.0 r118431 with 8GB RAM and 2 processors.

However, I do not see that application in Applications folder. I am very new to Mac and may be I am missing something but to my knowledge, IF App is installed on the machine, then it has to be in Applications folder.\nIs there any reason under which it can not be in the Applications folder?\n\nA: An app can be in any directory. It is suggested to move them to the Application folder so they are easy to find.\nWhen you downloaded Slack it probably went to your download folder. Did you copy it from there to Applications? If so follow directions below. If not, it could still be in your download folder.\nThere are 2 Application folders. One is under your home directory and the other is at the root level. Slack should in the Application folder at the root level. From a finder window you can right click on the directory name at the top of the finder window. Click on Macintosh HD and that will display contents of the root directory. You should find the Applications listed there.\nFrom the terminal, cd to the root level and do an ls to see the other directories (folders).\n\nA: With any running application that shows in the Dock, you can press the command key and click the application's Dock Tile to have a Finder window open at its installed location, highlighting the app.\nIf you have Finder's Path Bar showing, (at the bottom of the Finder window), then you can see its path in relation to the volume it's installed on, which it typically the Macintosh HD in the /Applications folder.\nWithout Finder's Path Bar showing you can right-click (control click) on the folder name at the top center of the Finder window to show its path.\n\nA: This is not an “answer” per se, so much as an affirmation that I do not think you are hallicinating.\nToday, one of my coworkers installed a copy of our company’s software on his Mac.\n(I’m not going to identify the software here because that’s not the important detail. People have reported the same problem with Slack and JAMF, among others, so it seems to be some kind of caching thing with Finder itself, and not a bug with any of these particular examples.)\nSalient details:\n\n*\n\n*The software was installed via a .pkg installer, which wrote the files to the /Applications folder.\n\n*On opening /Applications in Finder, the software was not displayed; sorting the programs alphabetically, it definitely was not shown on the list where it should have been.\n\n*If you ran a ls -la /Applications in Terminal, the software was displayed.\n\n*If you ran a Spotlight search for the software, it would show up & launch, and it would run normally from there.\n\n*After a reboot, then the software became visible in Finder’s view of the /Applications folder.\n\nA web search for this problem has turned up a handful of hits (Apple Discussions, JAMF Nation), including this post, but none have been very helpful — with lots of people making vaguely accusatory “are you sure you looked in the Applications folder?” type questions and so on.\nIn this case, we are very sure indeed that we are looking in the right folder — we have a screen recording of the problem as it was happening.\nSo that’s my suggestion, such as it is — I’m not clear why this happens, but if you see this behavior, try:\n\n*\n\n*Relauncing Finder. (Minimal disruption, might work.)\n\n*Log out the macOS user account session, then log back in. (More disruptive.)\n\n*Reboot. (Most disruptive, but also most likely to succeed.)\n\n\nA: I appreciate all the good detail in the answers above. Unfortunately, none of them worked for me and even though I started using the app after installation after I closed it there was no sign of it in Finder or in the Terminal list.\nI still had the .dmg that had the installer package. Clicking that reopened the installer window with an image of the Applications folder and of the app I thought I had installed. I dragged the app image over to the Applications folder in that same window and the app loaded onto my list of apps in the Finder Applications folder.\nInitially, I just double-clicked on the app image in the installer window and it led me through some prompts that appeared to install the app properly.  Apparently, it wanted this drag-and-drop step because everything is fine now and the app is showing up in the Finder.\n", "Q: Where are widget screen positions (coordinates) stored? I keep a widget open on my desktop on my secondary monitor. Went away on vacation. No external monitor. The widget was \"trapped\" offscreen and active.\nI tried looking in the preferences file for that widget but only the preferences for the widget were stored, not any meta-preferences ABOUT the widget, in this case its X and Y coordinates on the screen. I was hoping the pref file would have that information and I could just reset to 0,0.\nIt seems like it must be stored somewhere as it keeps its position every time I boot. I just don't know where it is or where to look.\nDoes anyone know where this information may be stored? \n\nA: Dashboard widget positions are stored in /Users/USERNAME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dashboard.plist (where USERNAME is your username on your Mac) and can be accessed by using Xcode to edit or possibly even TextEdit. When you open the file, you're looking for the values under 'layer-gadgets' and then 'Item X' (where X is the widget's position number in the Dashboard layout).

Try a recovery tool such as M3 Data Recovery, a very good one (free if recovered data less than 100Mb, $70 if more). I saw other references to Disk Warrior, which costs about $170, but haven't tried that. Other free tools include ddrescue, which in my experience doesn't work consistently if at all.\n", "Q: Can I create an Automator application to start Tomcat when I need? I can start Apache Tomcat (installed via HomeBrew) in Terminal using\n$ catalina run\n\nBut it does not work in an Automator application Shell script using bash \nI tried to set up a bash Shell script in Automator like this: \ncatalina run\n\nWhen I run the Automator application, it won't work and shows -: catalina: command not found. \nWhat is the correct way to create an Automator application, or do I need to use AppleScript?\n\nA: When you run a shell command or script in Automator it is passed your system's default PATH, not the one in your bash profile. This is why bash cannot find the catalina command.\nYou should always specify the full path to the command in shell scripts. If it was installed via HomeBrew this is probably /usr/local/bin/catalina but you can confirm this by running which catalina in a terminal session.\n\nA: To actually answer the questions your asked:\n\n*\n\n*Can I create an Automator application to start and stop Tomcat when I need?\nYes\n\n\n*What is the correct way to do this, or do I need AppleScript or stuff?\n\n\n*And is it possible to do both start and stop in one Automator app?\n\n\n*What is the correct way to create an Automator application, or do I need to use AppleScript?\nSince there is usually more then one way to accomplish something, lets refrain from using \"...the correct way to...\" and show you some choices.\nIf you simply want to be able to toggle the state of Apache Tomcat, i.e, start or stop it, then the following command line can be used in a Automator Application workflow using a Run Shell Script action:\n\n*\n\n*In Automator, create a new Application workflow.\n\n*Add a Run Shell Script action.\n\n*\n\n*Settings: Shell: /bin/bash and Pass input: to stdin\nReplace the default code with the following line of code:\n[[ $(/bin/ps aux | /usr/bin/grep [t]omcat) == \"\" ]] && /usr/local/bin/catalina start || /usr/local/bin/catalina stop\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the Automator Application workflow.\n\nThis command checks to see if Apache Tomcat is running and if not, then starts it, and if yes, then stops it. It simply toggles the state of Apache Tomcat. It's a no frills solution.\n\nA more robust solution would be to use a Run AppleScript action instead.\n\n*\n\n*In Automator, create a new Application workflow.\n\n*Add a Run AppleScript action.\n\nUse the following example AppleScript code in place of the default code:\ntry\n    set isRunning to (do shell script \"/bin/ps aux | /usr/bin/grep [t]omcat\")\non error number 1\n    set isRunning to missing value\nend try\n\nif isRunning contains missing value then\n    display dialog \"                Click the Start button to start Apache Tomcat.\" buttons {\"Cancel\", \"Start\"} ¬\n        default button 2 with title \"Start Apache Tomcat\"\n    do shell script \"/usr/local/bin/catalina start\"\nelse\n    display dialog \"                Click the Stop button to stop Apache Tomcat.\" buttons {\"Cancel\", \"Stop\"} ¬\n        default button 2 with title \"Stop Apache Tomcat\"\n    do shell script \"/usr/local/bin/catalina stop\"\nend if\n\n\n*\n\n*Save the Automator Application workflow.\n\nThis also could be used in an AppleScript Application, created in Script Editor, by itself with no need for Automator. In either case when run you'll be presented with one or the other dialog boxes.\n\n\nThis gives you the opportunity to see whether or not it's running and cancel if you want instead.\n\nNote: With the exception of using a try statement and an on error number 1 statement there is no other error handling presented in the example AppleScript code. For additional error handling as may be appropriate/needed/wanted, the onus is upon the user to add appropriate additional error handling for any example code presented.\nAlso, the example code presented herein was tested under a clean install of macOS 10.12.6 with Command Line Tools (macOS Sierra version 10.12) for Xcode-9.1, Homebrew, JDK 9.0.1, and apache-tomcat-8.5.23.tar.gz installed. I see no reason why this would not work in macOS 10.13 as well.\n", "Q: Significance of IODisplayWrangler in power management assertions When I check my power management assertions (MacBook Pro running macOS Sierra), I see the following line:\n$ sudo pmset -g assertions\n...\nIdle sleep preventers: IODisplayWrangler\n\nWhat is IODisplayWrangler and what does it mean that it is listed as an \"idle sleep preventer\"?\n\nA: It turns out this part of the OS is open source.  (Link is for macOS 10.12.6, but other versions are available.)\nReading the code reveals that the IODisplayWrangler is a class that interfaces with the power management system in order to manage display brightness.  It detects user activity and uses this to determine when to dim, turn on, or turn off displays.  When the display is on, the class sets a kernel assertion that prevents idle sleep.  So seeing IODisplayWrangler as an idle sleep preventer is normal when the display is on.\nIn the developers' own words:\n/*\n    This is the Power Management policy-maker for the displays.  It senses when\n    the display is idle and lowers power accordingly.  It raises power back up\n    when the display becomes un-idle.\n\n    It senses idleness with a combination of an idle timer and the \"activityTickle\"\n    method call.  \"activityTickle\" is called by objects which sense keyboard activity,\n    mouse activity, or other button activity (display contrast, display brightness,\n    PCMCIA eject).  The method sets a \"displayInUse\" flag.  When the timer expires,\n    this flag is checked.  If it is on, the display is judged \"in use\".  The flag is\n    cleared and the timer is restarted.\n\n    If the flag is off when the timer expires, then there has been no user activity\n    since the last timer expiration, and the display is judged idle and its power is\n    lowered.\n\n    [...]\n\n    This driver calls the drivers for each display and has them move their display\n    between various power states. When the display is idle, its power is dropped\n    state by state until it is in the lowest state.  When it becomes un-idle it is\n    powered back up to the state where it was last being used.\n\n    [...]\n\n    We register with Power Management only so that we can be informed of changes in\n    the Power Management aggressiveness factor.  We don't really have a device with\n    power states so we implement the absolute minimum. The display drivers themselves\n    are part of the Power Management hierarchy under their respective frame buffers.\n*/\n\n", "Q: Updating OS X El Capitan to macOS High Sierra as a developer I'm working as a software developer and have a project that I've taken over from an old colleague which is developed on a mac with OSX El Capitan. \nI'm having some problems updating Xcode to the newest version and from what I've read I have to install a more current version of the OS, so I've downloaded macOS High Sierra. \nBefore I go ahead and install it I just wanted to ask someone who has more experience with this to avoid losing anything important.\nI've backed up the data using the Time Machine feature, I've done it twice just to check if it could and it looks like it works.\nIs there anything special that I should be aware of about the OS in general & as a developer that affects the update process?\nIs there any way to validate the backup just to make sure that nothing on it is corrupted?\nAny information is appreciated.\n\nA: First off, why do you need to update beyond El Capitan? Yes, it will be end of life in a little less than a year, but if your concern is just getting started with the development project, you don't need to update macOS. A project built on Xcode 7.x and El Capitan will work just fine on (High) Sierra.\nPutting that aside, yes, the latest Xcode will require the latest version of macOS. If you've done Time Machine backups of the box, then you shouldn't run into any issues with the OS and environment provided the backup is good (which you've indicated). For extra peace of mind, you could copy the project itself to an another disk or just make sure it is up-to-date with the source code repository (it IS in version control, right?!)\nA project created with Xcode for El Capitan will (I believe) work without modifications on Xcode for High Sierra. However, you'll need to update the project for it to take advantage of the features of the newer OS / frameworks (e.g. something like Siri integration wouldn't be available without re-targeting the project to a newer framework version). Just be sure that if you're going to move to the newer version that you stay mindful of what minimum OS X / macOS version you want to support; you can easily lock out anything older than High Sierra which might not be your intention. In general, you want to support the minimum OSX version that has the features you need, so perhaps Mavericks (10.9) or Yosemite (10.10) would be a good starting point, but I'd probably just leave it as it was set by the previous developer.\n", "Q: Charging a Macbook pro 15-inch (late 2016 touch bar) The original charger for my laptop model can output 87W. Sometimes I forget it at work and I use my Nintendo Switch Charger (Output: 15V, 2.6A = 39W) for emergencies.\nI was wondering if using a charger that may not be able to input the amount of power needed (for example maybe the laptop needs 45W so it will take the rest from the battery) could damage the laptops battery? \nExtra: If there is no problem, would that also hold for this power bank: https://www.amazon.com/AUKEY-30000mAh-Portable-Delivery-Nintendo/dp/B071CQYBSN\n\nA: Officially according to Apple: \n\nYou can use a compatible higher wattage adapter without issue, but it\n  won't make your computer charge faster or operate differently. Lower\n  wattage adapters don't provide enough power.\n\nThere is no mention of risking damage to the battery, but you may not be able to charge at all at lower wattages.\nAdditionally, you have to use a USB-C cable that is meant for charging. The Switch cable appears to be made for such.\nIn personal experience with MagSafe-powered MacBook Pros, the battery indicator in the menu may say \"Battery is not charging\", but I've noticed it stays powered on longer than just running off the internal battery alone. Your miles may vary.\nSource: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201700\n", "Q: Paragon NTFS app version problem, how to update? I have a little problem (not me, a friend).\nHe bought a 1TB HDD with some service files, including Paragon NTFS 11.3.11 (he bought this HDD with his Mac, which shipped with Mac OS X version 10.10 or 10.11). He has updated his MacBook to 10.12 and Paragon stopped working, so I think this is a version problem. \nThe question is, how can I update this Paragon software for macOS 10.12? Do I need to buy a new version of this app??? \nSamsung's services files do not have a serial number, only some Windows apps and Macintosh NTFS Paragon driver (Paragon 11.3).\n\nA: yes, you need to buy a new version of this ( paragon 15 ).\n\nA: You can also contact Samsung/Seagate, maybe they have an updated version of OEM NTFS for Mac for you.\n", "Q: Which cable should I choose to do data transfer between a 12\" MacBook and a 2017 MacBook Pro via target disk mode by Migration Assistant? This is a quick image showing my cables and MacBooks.\nI got a new MacBook Pro 13\" with Touch Bar (A1706) and now I need to transfer all my data from my old 12\" MacBook (A1534) to it. While Migration Assistant always generates errors over Wi-Fi, I see target disk mode could do the work.\nFrom this official article by Apple it says:\n\nTarget disk mode on MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports\nYou can use target disk mode to transfer data between MacBook Pro\n  models with Thunderbolt 3 and other Mac computers.\nTo use target disk mode between a MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt 3 and\n  another Mac notebook's USB-C port, connect the two computers with a\n  USB-C cable such as the Belkin 3.1 USB-C to USB-C Cable.\n\nSo I got this Belkin 3.1 cable. However, when I restart the 12\" MacBook into target disk mode and connect it to my 13\" MacBook Pro when Migration Assistant is searching for the source, nothing happens. \nBefore this I actually accidentally got a Thunderbolt 3 cable to try, and nothing happened either.\nSo even the official post is not telling the right thing? Or where did I get it wrong? Which cable should I get to complete the job? I'm so confused right now.\n\nA: After different kinds of attempts, I finally got it work by some sort of magic.\nShort answer: USBC 3.1 cable does work, but you have to first leave two MacBooks unconnected, and turn on each other separately. Leave the 12” MacBook stay there for several minutes, with or without power supply, then use the cable to connect. Wait about 5 minutes, the disk will show on desktop or in disk-utility app.\nHere’s how I found it working if you are interested:\nAlthough initially I could hear the charging sound from my old 12” MacBook when connecting it to my new MacBook Pro when 12” is on target disk mode, the disk never showed up on migration assistant, desktop or disk utility, for however long time I wait. Then I was thinking if the cable was the right cable, and that brought me to my original question. To troubleshoot the cable, I came up with another idea: I put the new MacBook Pro in target disk mode this time, and connected it my 12” MacBook, see if 12 inch can recognize the new cable. The reason I did this is because in my opinion, the new MacBook definitely can use this 3.1 cable, since it’s thunderbolt 3 port so it shoudn’t have downwards capability issue, but I am not sure if the USBC port on 12” could since it is still a USBC gen1 port and this cable is gen2.\nTo my surprise, about 2 minutes later the disk from my new MacBook showed up on my 12”, and I did a little file transfer successfully. So the cable is good, and there’s no reason it can’t be used reversely. I begin to make different attempts, by reversing the cable(although I know this shouldn’t be an issue for usb-c), and by booting each MacBook in different orders with cable connected or without.\nFinally, it led me to the result I described in my short answer. And I tried 3 more time, all work. Booting with the cable already attached will not give you any result, at least in my case. I waited the whole night long and I still didn’t see it was mounted when I woke up this morning. So if are you experiencing this issue, definitely try booting the computers separately without cable connected, and then connect it. And most importantly, you may have to wait(plus, I actually found this method by accident as well. After so many failures I was calling an apple care representative for help, and she put me on hold to find the infomrmstion on whether this cable would work or not. While waiting for her reply about 5 minutes later, the disk showed up! So I recalled what I did, and that is in my short answer) for several minutes. I don’t know the reason, and this could be very tricky as you may think this would fail again. But be patient and follow the steps and you will be good!\nEdit: I’m still keeping the thunderbolt 3 cable however, and I will try that with some updates later. I’m doing the migration now. Finger crossed!\n\nA: You don't use migration assistant in Target disc mode. U simple look for the old mac, same as connecting an external HDD. When you connect you will be prompted for the password that you use to login to the old computer and walla you now have access to your old files which you can transfer to your new computer. Using a USBC to THUNDERBOLT 2 (Mini DP) cable is the fastest method of data transfer. \n", "Q: Change APFS Volume to case sensitive I have a macbook pro with 1TB internal glued flash drive, of which around 600GB are full. \nI would like to change the volume format from APFS (case insensitive, encrypted) to APFS (case sensitive, encrypted). Is that even possible? \nOr should I make a second volume / partition with the right setting and try to move everything there? Is that even possible? \n\nA: I had a similar issue and this is how I went.\nWarning this involves a total reinstallation of your OS, wiping and partitioning your drives. With an SSD, it might be possible to push files into a new partition and by doing this repeatedly, squeeze your data into 3 partitions and then down to the desired two without wiping anything (maybe), but with billions of read/writes going over and over the same cells, such a method has the potential to noticeably age your SSD max life cycles. Backup, Partition and Restore has a much better outcome\n\nMy set up: iMac late 2012: macOs 10.14, 1TB HD, 1TB Time Machine, 0.6TB external HD, and about 45 GB synced in 315 GB in GDrive space.\nAll my personal documents are live synced to gdrive and also backed up to Time Machine. Some of my lesser projects are also synced to gdrive and also backed up to Time Machine.  I would strongly recommend you use multiple backup strategies for your most critical documents.  I only have a few files in my home directory, rather I have everything linked from the cloud in the Documents, Pictures, Music &etc directories.  All my big projects, archives, and video editing I keep in …/Shared as they are way too large to sync to the cloud.\nHaving said that, I followed the recommendations from Apple and other reliable gurus and accepted that APFS case sensitive is not recommend for applications. So I prepared to split my hard drive 100 GB for macOS ( / ) APFS regular and 900GB APFS case sensitive for /Volumes/Users.\nI was going to relocate my home directory and the Shared directory from /Users to /Volumes/Users/……\nDetermine how much you are going to need for your macOS drive, which mounts at /.\nFirst determine how much you have in /Users and the subtract that amount from the total usage on your 1TB. On my iMac, for 110+ apps all the libraries and system files and other normally hidden folders it was about 60GB total, so a 40% margin for growth was fine. Your situation may be different.\nOn my 0.6TB external drive I have kept a repository of all the dmg, zip, tar, and pkg files that installed programs on my Mac.  I have also kept a text file list of all the application in my /Applications and under /usr/local/Cellar & …Caskroom to aid in reinstallations where needed.\nNow with a full Time Machine backup of the entire SSD and extra backups, installation files, and lists, you are ready for a smooth transition. And you are covered pretty much if everything goes south too.\n\nWith an active internet connection, do the reboot Cmd-Opt-R iNet recover. Do a new install and partition the SSD  as desired, first partition APFS regular 10-20% of space (as you have pre-determined will be needed with growth room included) Make a second partition using all the remaining space (less if you have a plan for a 3rd partition for special use) using APFS case sensitive and name it \"Users\".   I would choose that name so as to reduce some possible confusion for certain programs looking for a relative path, but you could call it Data, if you wanted. Continue with the installation and set the first partition (I named mine \"macOS\") as the install destination drive.\nWhen installing use the same username/password for yourself, this will greatly simplify your efforts.\nAfter installation and rebooting login as yourself and then, if you don't know how to set up root as a user and login as root, create second user, anyname, as administrator and log in as them. COPY the nearly empty new folders from /Users over to the new volume, /Volumes/Users. Choose copy over move because in a worst case loss of your Data volume, you can still boot in as you with your permission intact. (Hint: once in awhile you might want to copy your hidden user setting file over to /Users/yourname—I use midnight-commander to do that. By using a second administrator, all of the files will be free to copy the can be copied.  Your admin identity is now safely in two locations.  You can logout and back in as yourself.\nYou are now ready to move your home folder assignment. In the System Preferences/Users & Groups, unlock the settings first. Remove the second admin you created and all their files & directories. Now right-click on your ID in the left-hand table and choose advanced options.  It is here you can \"move\" your home directory to the new one on the second, case sensitive partition, /Volumes/Users/yourname.\nOnce you have changed your home directory, you can reboot and and log in. /Users/yourname and …/Shared are now orphaned.\nHere is where you have to choose, speed OR security and reliability: Note you can not just restore as that will try to put everything back on the now much smaller first partition.\nA. the faster method:\n\n*\n\n*open two finder windows, one at / the other at Time Machine\n\n*press command-shift-. to see all the hidden directories\n\n*use finder to navigate to the last full backup on Time Machine\n\n*highlight everything in that backup EXCEPT /Users and copy all the folders over to root ( / )\n\nThis method holds the probable risk that your moved identity will not recognize most of the restored programs/have the right settings for them, and if you then go on to restore yourname from the Time Machine in the same way, you also won't have the right settings restored.\nB. the surer (slower) method\nNext, you should re-install all your previous programs. Once done, you should re–establish your email settings and other on-line accounts through System Preferences. If you archive your emails, like I do, you can't just restore them because the directories are no longer have the same names. However, you can import  them through Mail out of Time Machine under your old file structure, ~/Library/Mail/ into your \"new\" email. Once they are imported you can rearrange them as you like.\nImportant: do not re-establish your Time Machine drive as the current backup drive before you are satisfied that everything has migrated correctly, or the app will start dumping older files to make room for the \"new\" ones without ask you.\nNext, you can start restoring all your Document, pictures and such, and if you have used …/Shared to file all your project data, and however you have used it, those folders can all be dragged out of Time Machine and copied back to their original location.  I recommend this way as it will make sure that all of your permissions remain as before.\nWhen finish, your OS should be on a APFS case-insensitive boot partition and all your user identity and all your data should be on a APFS case-sensitive data partition.\nYou can go back into the Time Machine if you find some settings just won't work and look for the originals.\nIf all else fails, you can rewind it all back by restoring (with re-partitioning) from your original Time Machine backup.\nI was up and running in about 4 hours but I have a LOT of customizations and it was three more days before I was happy.\nBe patient and methodical and this should work well for you.\nRichard\n", "Q: How Do I Install Windows 10 To An External SSD Drive Under My Particular Config? I know there are a dozen other threads on this, and I've read through quite a few of them, but none of the methods outlined in the answers seem to work for me. \nI've got Parallels Desktop installed with a working Windows 10 installation running in it on my High Sierra boot drive, but I want to install a native Windows 10 partition under Boot Camp for various reasons. However my main hard-drive is a RAID 0 (Fusion Drive) configuration, and Boot Camp says that's a no-no.\nI've got this external Thunderbolt SSD that's 128GB that's just sitting there, waiting. But Parallels only sees it as a Network drive, and won't connect it \"directly\" to the Windows 10 virtual machine, so I can't do anything with it within Parallels. I have the Windows 10 install ISO, and I've written it to a 16GB Flash Drive. I think I can get it to boot, but Windows won't install when I have multiple thunderbolt devices connected, or even to an external drive at all, due to the way Windows installation works.\nI should add that I first tried to install Windows to a partition on my boot drive, but that didn't work. The partition I tried to create created for Windows to reside on was on the Fusion Drive; that is, that's where Disk Utility created it; it's residing on one of the external Thunderbolt drives I have connected to the Mac. (The Fusion Drive consists of the internal flash drive, plus three external Thunderbolt drives.) This did not work out.\nSo now I'm trying to install Windows to the 128GB external Thunderbolt SSD drive. Please help!\nHere are the outputs of my diskutil list and diskutil cs list commands:\nNemesis:~ andyhainline$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME

you can either pursue a third party tool or I can modify the instructions to install Windows to your internal drive.\n\n\nA: I wrote a blog post a while back, that might help LINK\n", "Q: Unable to boot into macOS or Ubuntu after dd and partition reduction I am on an early 2015 MacBook Pro with macOS Sierra, dual boot with Ubuntu 16.04. \nIn macOS, I did dd if=/dev/disk1s3 of=disk2s2(if i remember correctly). It succeeded and I proceeded to shrink the macOS partition using Disk Utility. That succeeded too. I proceeded to reboot and found myself unable to boot into any systems. Going into recovery mode, I am unable to restore from a backup or reinstall a new macOS.\nI see the partitions as they are supposed to be, though their health would be suspect. I have \n210mb EFI partition as /dev/sda1 FAT\n182GB macOS parition as /dev/sda2 ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff\n30GB free space partition as /dev/sda\n30GB Ubuntu PArtition as /dev/sda4 Ext4\n4GB Linux Swap as /dev/sda5 Swap\n\nWould anyone know how I could restore things as they are?

This only happens when the window is at the bottom of the screen. The window moves up vertically just enough so that it is not below/beside the dock anymore. It does not move horizontally. It also remains the same size.\nNo other apps behave this way, only Terminal. I am using version 2.8.\nTerminal did not behave this way in macOS 10.12 Sierra. It started behaving this way when I updated to 10.13.1 High Sierra.\nStep by step, this is what happens:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal.\n\n*Move Terminal window to bottom left or right corner of screen (flush with the edges).\n\n*Open new tab in Terminal.\n\n*Terminal window moves up so that it is higher than the dock.\n\n\nHow do I prevent #4 from happening? How do I prevent the Terminal window from moving by itself when I open a new tab?\n\nBefore\n\n\nAfter\n\n\nA: According to macOS, windows should not be behind the Dock. When the bounds of a window are updated, macOS moves any windows from behind the Dock above the Dock.\nThe window bounds update when you add a new tab, so macOS looks at those bounds and moves them such that they don't overlap with the Dock section of the screen. There's no way to change this currently.\nAs for why this happens in High Sierra and not in Sierra, I presume it's because Terminal now uses the unified tabs functionality provided in AppKit.\nTerminal has always had tabs, but macOS recently introduced tabs as part of the OS, for any app to use. I believe Terminal now uses this functionality for its tabs, which has caused this. You can test this by opening Terminal with multiple tabs and pressing ⇧⌘\\ for Show All Tabs — this is functionality provided system-wide by the OS, not by Terminal, for managing tabs including the tab bar.\n", "Q: How to decrypt the system keychain from another mac at the command line I just ran into a situation where a user with a Mac that had been hard broken by an interrupted update needed into their Time Machine backup outside of the normal recovery process. Unfortunately, they'd forgotten the password to do this.\nI have access to the filesystem on the broken Mac, and needed to recover their Time Machine password as well as anything else in the System keychain.\nDifficulty: The system keychain does not use a normal password, it uses random bytes. \nHow do you decrypt a system keychain?\n\nA: You need the following things:\n\n\n*\n\n*One dead Mac with a readable filesystem (called the Source machine from here on)\n\n*One new Mac or Linux machine (called the Target machine from here on)\n\n*The System.keychain file from the source machine.\n\n\n*\n\n*This file is located in either /System/Library/Keychains or /Library/Keychains\n\n\n*The SystemKey file from the source machine. This contains the actual password.\n\n\n*\n\n*Located in in /var/db/SystemKey\n\n\n*Internet access on the target machine.\n\n\nStep 1: Recovering the encryption key for the source keychain\nWe can't use SystemKey as is - it contains random bytes that can't be entered into a password dialog or command line. Even better, we need 24 bytes out of the middle of the file - after the magic number that indicates a key file, but before the checksum bytes.\nThe proper command to get the right hex key is:\nhexdump -s 8 -n 24 -e '1/1 \"%.2x\"' /path/to/SystemKey && echo\nExplained: Skip the first 8 bytes from the beginning of the file, continue 24 bytes after that, and use the format string to dump the data out on one line (it's a C-style printf string, if you're curious).\nThe && echo is so we get a single newline afterward so the output doesn't run into the beginning of your shell prompt after the command finishes.\nCopy this string aside. This is the decryption key for the keychain.\nStep 2: Dump the keychain using the password\nWe need a third party tool for this. We're going on the assumption that the dead Mac can't be booted in such a way that we can use its Keychain Access app normally.\nThat tool will be Chainbreaker - a python script. You'll need to install the hexdump library for Python. Run the following commands on the target machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo pip install hexdump\n\n*git clone https://github.com/n0fate/chainbreaker\n\n*cd chainbreaker\nNow we simply give chainbreaker the key you just found and the file:\npython chainbreaker.py -f /path/to/system.keychain -k (the byte string from step 1)\nYou'll see the plaintext password of everything in the system keychain. For my use case, I wanted the Time Machine password, and this will be represented in the output as a Generic password record named Time Machine. The plaintext password will be below. \nNow we can simply use the Finder to open the Time Machine .sparsebundle, give the password we dug out of the keyfile, and continue as usual.\n", "Q: Why do calendar notifications bring macOS Calendar application to the foreground? I've noticed that recently, maybe after some sort application or OS update, calendar notifications have been functioning normally in notification center BUT have also caused the calendar application (Calendar.app) to be brought to the foreground.

There are rainbow lines going across the screen in different directions. I sent it into my school's IT place and they were going to send it into apple with an estimated cost of $800 since it was a tier 4 accidental damage. However, a while ago, the corner was dented from dropping it (I had a case but the case did nothing). Will apple fix that while they are fixing the screen? Or will my screen not be covered because my MacBook has a dent in it? Will it cost anything extra? \n\nA: Any and all accidental damage (including that dent you're worried about) will be fixed when sent out to depot at tier 4 pricing. The glass, LCD, and housing will all be replaced- basically the whole top of the computer.\nThe only way it wouldn't get fixed is if the repair facility tech determines your computer \"beyond economical repair\" and that only happens if either a)every part in it is damaged or b) it contains some kind of biohazard (like insects, or bodily fluids) If that happens they just send the computer back not repaired at no cost. Basically on a 13\" computer 755+tax is the most you can pay so they should fix anything/everything that is wrong/damaged and if they don't you should complain/send it back.\nHonestly if you're close at all to an Apple store, display repairs are often significantly cheaper than flat rate tier 4 repair. When I left Apple in 2016 MacBook Air displays were around 425$ or so after labor, and 13\" MacBook Pro screens only a little more than that. Way cheaper than 755 if nothing else is wrong w/ your computer. An in-store repair would also include repairing the glass and dented housing because in-store technicians don't replace just the LCD, they replace the whole display assembly.\nSource: worked at the Genius Bar for 4+ years\n", "Q: \"show in finder\" open the file instead of opening the directory containing it the problem appeared after i tried path finder app, i didn't like it, i removed it using cleanmymac, than i used \ndefaults write -g NSFileViewer -string com.apple.Finder\nand\n rm Library/preferences/com.apple.finder.plist\nnow every time i click on show in finder, instead of opening the folder containing the file( the default behaviour of finder), it open the file, for EXP: if the file is a dmg it mount it, if it's a text file it open it on an editor, would any one have any idea how to reset finder\n\nA: I don't know if this will solve your problem but to reset Finder you should relaunch it.

I'll update this answer as soon as I hear of them. \nDownload the patch above. Leaving the rest of the post for history :-)\nThe CVE is CVE-2017-13872 and NIST will update the analysis in the near future.\nOriginal answer, relevant without patch\nFirst off, do not disable the root account via the GUI, having a \"disabled\" root account is the cause of the problem.\nYou shall enable the root user and give it a password. This is important, since the vulnerability is available remotely as well, via VNC and Apple Remote Desktop (to name a few)(another source). \nThere are two basic ways to do this; GUI and terminal.\nFirst off, GUI\nTo enable the root account, go to \"Directory Utility\", ie cmd + space and search. Press the lock to unlock \"admin mode\", then enable the root account through edit -> \"Enable Root User\".\n\nIt should ask for a root password, for now enter your normal password (so you don't forget it). If it doesn't ask for a password, use Edit -> \"Change Root Password...\" above.\nTerminal\nIf you are more of a terminal person, use the below:\nsudo passwd -u root\n## Enter passwords as needed.... \n## (if you are using the terminal you should know what you are doing...)\n\nThis is enough with a terminal, the problem with the GUI way is that we have to enable the account to set a password, which we don't have to with the terminal.\nNotes\nEven if you have a password set for the root account your computer it will become vulnerable if you disable the root account. The action of disabling the root account  seems to be the culprit. So I repeat, the root user should be enabled and have a password if using the GUI, whilst via terminal only using ´passwd´ is \"ok\" (although this state is unreachable via only the GUI). It seems that the \"Disable Root User\" in \"Directory Utility\" removes the password for the root account, in a sense giving you a password-less root account which is vulnerable.\nIt seems like trying to log in with \"root\" in a systems login-window enables the root account if it is disabled previously. Ie with a disabled root account you need to enter root twice in a systems login-windows to gain root access, and (according to my testing) on the first try the root account is enabled (with no password if not set via passwd), and on the second try you go through.\nIt seems that the issue has been in the open since at least 2017-11-13 (13th of November), when it is mentioned in the Apple support forum.\nPlease prove me wrong, I would really appreciate to be wrong right now.\nScary update\nAfter enabling the passwordless root account (i.e. through the system preferences panel and clicking a \"lock\" and entering \"root\" with blank password one, two or three times (number of times depends on initial state)) it is possible to log on to the computer from the main login screen using \"root\" and a blank password (!). SSH / Telnet does not seem to work, but Apple Remote Desktop, Screen Sharing and VNC are vulnerable.\nSo for networks admins it might be of interest to temporarily drop packets to the following ports:\n\n\n*\n\n*5900-5905(ish, to be ninja safe) to get the most common VNC ports. VNC starts at 5900 by default and enumerates upwards if you are using multiple displays (uncommon though). Screen Sharing and Apple Remote Desktop also seems to use these ports (list of Apple software ports)\n\n*3283 and 5988 for Apple Remote Desktop (list of Apple software ports)\n\n\nAdditional reading:\nA valiant attempt to reference other sources dealing with the issue.

Apple released a security update this morning.\n\n\n*\n\n*About the security content of Security Update 2017-001\n\n*Apple security updates\n\nA: If you can’t install the official patch or don't want to trust that it worked, then \nYou don't want to disable root user on High Sierra only.\nTo secure your Mac, enable root with a long secure password.\nWe are not changing this at work until the next full point release is out for macOS which would likely be 10.13.2\n\nUnless you take action, root user is disabled out of the box and this is bad if your Mac isn't patched correctly.\nIf you want, optionally harden the shell until Apple has an official patch or fix.\nHere is a great script to set a random root password and change / set the root shell to /usr/bin/false so that even if the password is guessed, the root shell can't log in:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/rtrouton/rtrouton_scripts/blob/master/rtrouton_scripts/block_root_account_login/block_root_account_login.sh\nIt basically does three key things:\nrootpassword=$(openssl rand -base64 32)\n/usr/bin/dscl . -passwd /Users/root \"$rootpassword\"\n/usr/bin/dscl . -create /Users/root UserShell /usr/bin/false\n\nThe UserShell create is if the shell is not set, and the full script checks for an existing shell and -changees it instead of -createing it. \nHow do I protect myself from the root vulnerability in macOS High Sierra?\n\nA: You need to log in as the root user and change the password to something strong. If it actually creates a new account (as opposed to enabling the already existing root account) you should delete that account first.\n\nA: Apple just released an update to fix the issue.\nSecurity Update 2017-001\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208315\nAlso to prevent unauthorized access to your Mac computers, you should enable the root user account and set a password specifically for the root user.\nhttps://support.apple.com/en-ph/HT204012\nIf your root user account is active already, make sure that you change the password just to make sure that the blank password vulnerability isn't set.\n\nA: No! Do not remove the root account!\nFirst of all, root has been present in all versions of macOS, Mac OS X, Mac OS, and even ancient versions of the operating system. macOS did not recently create this account because of a vulnerability. It merely exposed it by accident.\nRemoving root would be a very bad idea, and let me tell you why.\nIt would completely cripple macOS, since there would be no account with enough privileges to run critical services (such as WindowServer, which runs the GUI). There are safeguards in place to prevent clueless users from removing root, and you should not attempt to bypass them.\nLet's find out who runs the very first processes in the system, the most important processes (using Activity Monitor):\n\nHey, it's our friendly neighborhood root again! The first process (with PID 0) is actually controlled by the kernel, and will probably have full permissions anyway, but its child process, launchd (responsible for starting services such as the login window and window server itself) is started with the privileges of root. If root didn't exist, this process would have never started, or would have no permissions.\nSecuring the root account\nOther answers have provided a patch released by Apple that should fix the issue. However, if you are unable or non-willing to install it...\nIt works because macOS re-hashes the entered password as an \"upgrade\" because the disabled account (root) was incorrectly detected as having an old hash.

The only way to wake the computer when this happens is to do a long press on the power button (to turn off the computer) and then to do a short press on the power button (to turn it back on). When the computer comes back on it shows the \"You shut down your computer because of a problem\" error dialog. If I am using the computer and then I shut it and do not open it for awhile, I will sometimes hear the computer make the startup sound and the Apple logo on the back of the screen will light up while the laptop is closed. \n\nA: The first thing I would try is resetting the System Management Controller.\nReset the SMC\nOn your particular Mac, the steps to follow are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your MacBook Air\n\n*Unplug the power cable from your MacBook Air\n\n*For 10 seconds, press and hold at the same time the shiftcontroloption keys (on the left side of the built-in keyboard) and the power button\n\n*After 10 seconds let go of all keys and the power button \n\n*Plug in the power cable\n\n*Turn your MacBook Air back on with the power button.\n\n\nOnce you've done this, test your MBA by using it as normal to see whether this was enough to rectify it.\n\nA: The first thing to do it probably identifies the cause of the shutdown.

I would prefer a link to a downloadable spelling dictionary (Japanese websites are okay). \nIf there are no ready to use Japanese spelling dictionaries, I would be glad if you could point me to a good step-by-step tutorial for making one.\nP.S. I already acquainted myself with everything the official Apple website has to offer on the topic. I checked OpenOffice and LibreOffice for Japanese spelling dictionaries and could not find anything that I could make work. I also tried to look for a solution on Japanese and English websites but so far I did not have any luck.\nAnd of course, I did not forget to make sure that my computer is plugged in, turned on, logged into my account, and connected to the internet.

You'll notice a blue Reset Statistics option. Below this check the Last Reset date to see if it coincides with when your data went to zero.\n\n\n*\n\n*If it does, you have your answer. It's likely you've accidentally tapped on Reset Statistics, or that perhaps someone else did.\n\n*If it doesn't, then it's impossible for anyone here to give you a definitive answer as to what happened.\nAs for how it's supposed to work, there's no time limit as such.

I need to restore it to factory settings, but cannot access recovery mode with my Windows keyboard. I've tried Alt+R, Ctrl+R, and Start+R, but nothing. Is there any way to access recovery mode with a windows keyboard?\n\nA: OS X Recovery was introduced with OS X Lion. At best, your eMac supports 10.5.8 Leopard. If you want to install from scratch, you'll need either the original install disks or a system installation disk.\nYou can bring another bootable OS X drive that runs a supported OS for that hardware and get to things like terminal / Disk Utility as well but this hardware pre-dates recovery on the firmware / OS level.\n", "Q: How do I exit private browsing mode in iOS but retain all of my private tabs?

I'd prefer to install macOS with as vanilla/default a configuration as possible.\nIf anyone else has experience getting macOS to boot in VMware, let me know how the VMX configuration can be improved, or if some kind of SMC toggling intervention is necessary to get the thing to boot better. I've already tossed so many hacks and workarounds into the mix that I'm starting to run out of ideas :P\n\nA: After some more tinkering, I realized that packer was supplying a sloppy configuration to VMware Fusion, compared to how VMware Fusion prefers to configure macOS VM's.

I tried various softwares but nothing worked. Is there a way I can get back those photos or does iTunes took a backup before the restore?\n\nA: The main thing to note is...\nRestore does not merge old & new data. It replaces one with the other.\nAt restore, any information currently on the device will be erased.\nThis applies to any device, phone, computer etc. On a computer with a regular hard disk, forensic software may be able to recover some lost data. On a flash-based storage device, let alone one like an iPhone which uses hardware encryption, this data is gone forever.\nThis can be something of an issue if you have important data & need to restore from an earlier backup.\nFor photos etc, the simplest way to be able to re-merge afterwards would be to save them in Photos, or use Image Capture etc before restoring the older backup. You could then use iTunes to re-add them afterwards, in effect as 'new' data.\n", "Q: Why are some characters being replaced with boxed question marks on High Sierra?

I would like to use the Macbook as a library for both phones, but keep different photos on each phone.\nHow do I do this without losing any photos now?\n\nA: You need to set up separate Apple Ids for each user, possibly using Family Sharing to share purchases and other things.\nA simple iCloud id, which is what you have, assumes you want everything syncronised between all your devices.\n\nA: Another solution is to turn off iCloud Photo sharing on the 5c (Settings > iCloud); this will break the 5c's connection to synchronization of the two phones and the Mac, so that only the Mac and the 6s will synch. The 5c will ask if you wish to keep or discard the photos that are already on it. Photos subsequently added to the Mac or the 6s will not appear on the 5c.\n", "Q: Issue with Move to iOS android app to migrate to iphone I'm trying to migrate some data from an old Samsung phone running Android 4 to an iPhone 5s running iOS11.\nThe issue I'm stuck with is that when I setup the iphone and select move data from android, it gives me a 6 digit code, but on the Android device is expecting a 10 digit code.\nIs there anything that can be done?\nAny help would be great.\nThanks,\n\nA: I think you found a solution in meanwhile.\nAnyway I faced the some problem yesterday and I even contact Apple to get some information.

High Sierra I am unable to sign in or out on iCloud or the App store. Whatever app I am using (Sys Prefs, App Store) loops endlessly. I can quit Prefs, but have to force quit the App Store. iMessage operates but all messages are marked as undelivered. Virtually all documents stored in iCloud drive do not appear in the Finder, but are available through the web (iCloud) interface. All of this works fine in my test account, so it's not a S/N issue, but switching everything to the test account is not an option.\nI have deleted assorted caches and prefs.

Currently it's running Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and I'm not seeing any encrypt options anywhere (right click in Finder, disk utility, etc...). How can I encrypt this drive in place without having to erase all the data first? I could restore the data from a Time Machine backup but that sounds very tedious and time consuming. If there is a faster way I'd like to attempt that first. \n\nA: Normally the option to encrypt the drive can be found by right clicking the drive's icon in finder and selecting 'Encrypt \"DISKNAME\"'. You will not see the encryption option if the disk is using Master Boot Record or Apple Partition Map as the partition scheme. \nThis is because High Sierra encryption actually converts the Mac OS Extended (Journaled) to Apple File System (APFS), and this cannot be done on a Master Boot Record or Apple Partition Map partitioned drive.\nYou can check the disk partition type in Disk Utility.\n\n", "Q: Macbook charge cable doesn't work in my macbook. Macbook #2's cable works in my macbook. Why isn't my macbook able to charge with my cable? So, I've been having an issue on and off for a year or two where my macbook airs magsafe charger wouldn't actually charge my device, and I'd have to reset the SMC 10+ times to get it to recognize my charger.\nI've recently gotten access to a second macbook (pro) so I was curious if that charger would work for my macbook air. Lo and behold, it works immediately after plugging it in the first time. So, the other macbook charger works for both that macbook and mine. My charger works for the other macbook, but in mine it takes a bunch of resetting to get it to work.\nWhat could be causing this weirdness?\nNot sure if it would help, but here's a pic of my magsafe port (there is no removable debris, it just appears to be discolored and scratched a bit):\n\n\nA: I would suggest swapping the chargers and avoiding the problem.\nThe original charger may not have been the correct rating - had this before where they charge but so slowly or not at all.\nMacs and chargers do check what they are connected to so smaller chargers don't try to charge the larger batteries as the chargers have different ratings 60W, 85W etc...\n", "Q: High Sierra root vulnerability: how to check if someone logged in remotely? In macOS High Sierra, where can I find the IP addresses that logged in to my Mac through Screen Sharing or ssh?\nThat would be useful in light of the recently discovered root login vulnerability.\n\nA: As @Melvin points out, a patch was just released. But to the question at hand, the easy is answer is no, they were root on your machine. It is compromised, period, by definition you cannot trust anything on it if you suspect it was compromised. \nTo further elaborate, if someone got root access remotely to your machine, you would never ever be able to se the traces of that if they know what they are doing and clean their tracks. \nThis was not \"somebody got the key to the boss's office and messed around a bit in there\", this is \"somebody got the master key, unlimited funds and an unlimited contruction crew with unlimited time at hand\". If you suspect you where compromised, format and reinstall. \nTo answer the question in layman terms (i.e. how would someone without the prereq skills of cleaning tracks probably leave tracks).\nLets start with ssh, for a full discussion see this question. In short search for ssh or sshd (the \"server\" part of ssh) in \"Console.app\" or by terminal:\ncat /var/log/system.log | grep sshd\n\nThe problem with sshd is that normally nothing is really logged (security concerns AFAIK).\nThe same problem exists with VNC / Screen Sharing and Apple Remote Desktop / Remote Management, see for example this, this and this, that normal accepted connections are not logged. Only refused ones. Refused ones would probably come from \"screensharingd\", so search for that in the \"Console.app\" or terminal\ncat /var/log/system.log | grep screensharingd\n\nExcept this what other tracks could easily be found? I would look through users and make sure they are only valid users and that no permission levels have changed etc. \n\nI would also check if any remote services are enabled. See picture below. Of interest are \"Screen Sharing\", \"Remote Login\" and \"Remote Management\". cmd + space -> \"sharing\" is the easiest way to get there.\n\nA: I have not been able to exploit this vulnerability remotely, however I was able to while logged on and trying to escalate my privileges in System Preferences using \"root\" with no password.  \nTo detect this, scan the logs of the desired machine with the following command in Terminal.\nsudo log show --style syslog | fgrep \"authenticated as user root (UID 0) for right\"\n\nThe output of this command will show you the UID of the user that was logged on when this vulnerability was exploited, and the time.  Take the time and look for ssh or remote connections around that time frame.\nUpdate, to search for logins via the root account, use the following command in Terminal.\nsudo log show --style syslog | fgrep 'loginwindow' | fgrep 'root'\n\n\nA: There is no easy and trustable way to get the IP address of your attackant unless he made very stupid operations (like ftping from his real attack computer another tool).\nTripwire\nThe only serious way to detect such an attack or any future attack through another MacOS X vulnerability is to install and use tripwire. tripwire is a modification logging software coming from the Unix and security field. (You can install it with Macports).\nIf you previously installed tripwire you would be able to detect such a successful attack in either of 3 ways depending on the level of skillness of the attackant.\nHigh level attack\nYour attackant know tripwire and know he can’t tamper with its database.\nHe removes all your accesses or fully erase your filesystem to avoid being tracked back.\nMedium level attack\nYour tripwire installation was removed and your access maintained. You will detect this attack by the removal of tripwire.\nLow level attack\nYour attackant doesn’t know tripwire and all his modifications, even the removed log tracks, will be registered.\n", "Q: Assigning global keyboard shotcuts for cross-application behaviour? On PC: To open Chrome, the command was Win+3, a new window was Shift+Win+3.\nIt just occurred to me how much I relied on this. How can I have something as beautiful and simple as this on Mac? It should try to open the most recently active window, but should avoid changing Spaces as that is super disorienting. It shouldn't disorient.\nCan I write a custom macro? Or program? Or command? Or ANYTHING to have this work on Mac?\n\nA: macOS should get you up to speed a lot quicker.\nSee macOS Sierra: Create keyboard shortcuts for apps for creating custom keyboard short cuts:\n\nYou can create keyboard shortcuts only for existing menu commands. You can’t create keyboard shortcuts for general purpose tasks, such as opening an app.\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Choose Apple menu > System Preferences, click Keyboard, then click Shortcuts.\n  \n*Select App Shortcuts on the left, click the Add button , click the Application pop-up menu, then choose a specific app or All Applications.\n  If you want to set a shortcut for a menu command that appears in many apps, choose All Applications.\n  \n*In the Menu Title field, type the menu command for which you want to create a shortcut, exactly as the command appears in the app, including the > character (type ->), ellipses (type three periods without spaces or press Option-;), or other punctuation.\n  \n*Click in the Keyboard Shortcut field, press the key combination that you want to use as the keyboard shortcut, then click Add.\n  \n\n\nA: While you know how to assign new shortcuts for opening the app I have a solution to open new \"Chrome\" window if it is not present on current Space or activate the \"Chrome\" on current space.\nThis AppleScript will prevent you from switching the spaces:\nif application \"Google Chrome\" is running then\n    tell application \"System Events\" to set CurrentSpaceWindows to windows of process \"Google Chrome\"\n    if CurrentSpaceWindows is {} then\n        tell application \"Google Chrome\"\n            make new window\n            activate\n        end tell\n    else\n        tell application \"Google Chrome\" to activate\n    end if\nelse\n    tell application \"Google Chrome\" to activate\nend if\n\nYou can now assign a global shortcut to run this script and get what you want (If I understood you correctly).\nI personally prefer to use BetterTouchTool to assign keyboard and other shortcuts. You can directly assign a shotcut to run this script.\n\nEDIT: add a posibility to run it from an Automator.\nIn order to run it via Automator Service, you have to create it like so:\n\nPlease note, that I've left the whole part:\non run {input, parameters}\n\n<- Here goes the Script\n    return input\nend run\n\nLater go to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy and add Automator to the Accessibility section like this:\n\nThen it should work as expected, I've tested it and it works.\n", "Q: Check whether macOS host is affected by serious vulnerability that enables access to the root superuser Is it correct to assume that (prior to applying Security Update 2017-001) a host running macOS 10.12.6 (Sierra, i.e. not High Sierra) is not affected by the serious vulnerability that enables access to the root superuser if the following command returns non-empty ShadowHashData?\nsudo plutil -p /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/root.plist\n\n\nA: According to Apple's support document on Security Update 2017-001 macOS Sierra 10.12.6 and earlier are not affected by the vulnerability:\n\nNot impacted: macOS Sierra 10.12.6 and earlier \n\nIf you want to use terminal to find out if you're running 10.12.6 you may want to use the command \nsw_vers -productVersion\nor refer to the question How to find out Mac OS X version from Terminal? on superuser.\n", "Q: Where to install Kibana (and tools like it) I'm following the guide Install Kibana with .tar.gz, and not sure where I should put it on a Darwin/OS X system. I know I can probably put it where I want, but wondering if there is a designated/standard place on my system for such tools. On this tutorial, they use Yum which puts it into a Yum repo, but I'm not sure if that's what I want to use. My Elasticsearch is installed at /usr/local/elasticsearch-6.0.0 with a symbolic link to it at /usr/local/elasticsearch.\n\nA: On macOS the canonical place to install Unix software is /usr/local/, with the usual set of bin, lib, etc etc. beneath it. Going with this your installation of elasticsearch would seem to be bit odd but that is probably easy to fix.\nYou could also go with Homebrew which allows an easy installation of a lot of Unix software (and which uses /usr/local as a base as well).

Similar to others, I experience the issue where Force Click does not work to bring up the look up window, even in native Apple apps such as Safari. However, in a secondary user account, Force Click works as expected, while the System Preferences pane looks exactly the same.\nWhere does macOS (10.13.1, in this case) store the preferences for force touch and how to reset them?\nMight this be related to the fact that sometimes Cmd+Ctrl+D does not work in my account (despite there not being a conflicting entry in Keyboard→Shortcuts)?\nAs far as I'm aware I don't have 3rd party programmes modifying trackpad/keys.\n\nA: All your settings are stored in something called the defaults system, which at its core is a bunch of .plist files in your Library folder: ~/Library/Preferences/whatever.plist.\nYou can actually change them with the defaults command in Terminal, although it's generally a good idea to quit the relevant app first. Changing system settings will probably not take effect until you log out. For more information, run man defaults in Terminal.\nTry this command:\ndefaults read -g | grep trackpad\n\nThis should show your trackpad-related settings. I don't have a Force Touch trackpad, but here's  what I get:\n\"com.apple.trackpad.forceClick\" = 1;\n\"com.apple.trackpad.scaling\" = \"0.6875\";\n\"com.apple.trackpad.scrolling\" = \"0.3125\";\n\n\nNow for some troubleshooting.\nBefore going any further, it's a good idea to duplicate your global preferences file, ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist, in case you lose some settings you want to keep.\nTo see if one of these preferences is the problem, try doing this with each preference in turn that you got from the previous command:\ndefaults delete -g com.apple.trackpad.forceClick\n\nreplacing with the proper one, of course. You'll probably have to log out and back in to see the changes.\n(An important note: Terminal commands generally don't ask for confirmation before doing things.

Let me know if you know of anything similar.\nWhat I have tried\n\n\n*\n\n*Resetting Keyboard Shortcuts.\n\n*Toggling every Accessibility feature on and off again.\n\n*Changing Input Sources (keyboard layout).\n\n*Replacing batteries in the keyboard with a fresh pair of Duracells.\n\n*Remove pairing from MacBook and force re-pair.\n\n*Rename keyboard.\n\n*Boot my MacBook from a Linux USB. Keyboard is acting the same.\n\n\nOther info\n\n\n*\n\n*The issue has persisted through the upgrade to macOS High Sierra, but wasn't as bad before.\n\n*I do have a custom keyboard layout (made with Ukelele), and the issues started some time after that. However, I have tried switching and removing my custom keyboard layout (so none other than the default layout is enabled), makes no difference.\n\n*There seems to be nothing wrong with the built-in keyboard, it acts completely normal while the wireless keyboard is freaking out.\n\n*The only other bluetooth device I am using simultaneously is the Apple Magic Mouse - no issues there.\n\n*I have never spilled anything in the keyboard, or done it any harm - other than typing a lot, and hard.\n\n\nOther symptoms\nTyping the @ symbol (on my EU keyboard that's Alt + ') suddenly stopped working. Nothing happened, but without the Alt modifier, the ' key worked fine. And the Alt modifier was working fine with other keys as well. Sometimes the Audio Preferences randomly open up... \nThen one day I was typing my password, and not being able to log in. Seems my P has magically started turning Caps Lock on and off.\nLately the keyboard's ESC key is working again, and it feels like the keyboard is either working 100% or acting crazy 100%. Meaning, in the beginning of this post my S key would append - and SPACE a z when typing, and seconds later I can type a full sentence with no interference.\n\nA: Since your built-in keyboard seems to work fine, I'd try to reset both the macOS Bluetooth Device List and Bluetooth Controller. \nIMPORTANT: This will reset all connected Bluetooth devices, including your Apple Magic Mouse, so your wireless keyboard and mouse will need to be reconnected.\nBefore commencing, you will need to have the Bluetooth icon showing in the menu bar. If it is not there, open System Preferences > Bluetooth and enable the option Show Bluetooth in Menu Bar.\nResetting the macOS Bluetooth Device List and Bluetooth Controller\nFollow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down both the Shift and Option keys and at the same time click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar. Once the menu is showing, release the keys.     \n\n*From the Bluetooth menu, choose Debug > Remove All Devices\n\n*Hold down both the Shift and Option keys again and at the same time click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar. \n\n*From the Bluetooth menu,  choose Debug > Reset the Bluetooth Module\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Setup your keyboard again\n\n*Setup your Magic Mouse again\n\n\nLet us know whether this helps.\n", "Q: File sharing broken after installing Security Update 2017-001 I've spent all day so far trying to resolve this. File sharing just doesn't work any more!\nI am now fairly certain that installing Security Update 2017-001 for macOS High Sierra to fix the “root” vulnerability problem (see: https://www.imore.com/macos-has-root-bug), is the cause of my file sharing problem! C'mon Apple, where's your quality control!\nDoes anyone know how I can fix this?\n\nA: Apple has already issued a quick fix to this.

You don't need to use the populate function; just add your services al la carte as needed.\nThat said, before you can modify a location, you have to switch to it first (make it active):\n$ networksetup -listlocations             <------ Lists all locations configured\n$ networksetup -getcurrentlocation        <------ Currently selected location\n$ networksetup -switchlocation location  <------ Sets current location\n\nUsing your two locations (Home and Work), switch to the location you want then add/modify/remove the service(s) in question\nFor example, to create a \"TestLAN\" service using the Bluetooth PAN hardware device on the Home network, use the following:\n$ networksetup -switchlocation Home\n$ networksetup -createnetworkservice TestLAN \"Bluetooth PAN\"\n\nAdditional commands you may wish to explore with networksetup are:\n-listallhardwareports\n-listlocations\n-listnetworkserviceorder\n-listallnetworkservices\n\nHowever, most importantly, you should explore the man page for more details.\n", "Q: macOS not allowing me to reallocate free space!

I've tried putting it into DFU mode but nothing was displayed on the screen.\nAre there any other ways to fix this?  If not, should I considering replacing some parts (like either the battery or the charging port)?  \n\nA: You should try to replace the battery possibly. Otherwise take it to the official Apple Store & ask them what to do. If you want to do every possible solution non-money wise. Clean out the power port, Use an official iPhone charger to charge it & try a hard reset/restart. If none of those work yeah take it to an Apple store and they can take a look at it and tell you what to do and whats wrong.\n", "Q: How to remotely connect to a laptop's local users directory? besides opening ssh-  is there a way to connect and read local users defined in a machine?\nEdit - further info.\nMy goal is to actually run an analysis on my network - to find out which local accounts reside in which machine.\nthe thing is that not all machines have ssh opened.\nAll the machines are part of my domain, and i have an administrative user and password in order to connect to the machines.\nThanks\n\nA: You can get a list of all macOS-accounts with\n dscl . list /Users | grep -v '_'\n\ndaemon, nobody, and root are system-defined accounts.

This hasn't happened in a long time but since I live near a border I thought it plausible and just tried to go to the settings to change it manually.\nThat's where I discovered two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*My usual carrier is not appearing on the list, but the foreign one is appearing twice.\n\n*Even if I try to change to another carrier, the name (top left) doesn't change.\n\n\nNow since that time I used my iPhone in other places and there is no change at all, the carrier name doesn't change.\nI switched back to automatic selection, and noticed that it seems like the only thing wrong is the displayed name of the carrier. That is because I have roaming off and I was still getting 4G. Yesterday I used 4G like usual and on my carrier's website I could verify that this was counted as normal data usage and not roaming.\nI have of course tried to restart the device but it didn't change anything. Since then I've installed Beta 5 but the problem persists.\nWould anyone have an idea of what I could do? I thought of contacting my carrier but I think this is mostly a software problem.\n\nA: A hard reset (Settings -> General -> Reset -> Erase All Contents and Settings) solved the issue. I made a backup before and used it to restore my phone after the hard reset, which did no recreate the carrier issue.\n", "Q: Removing a device from Find iPhone I used to have both my phone and somebody else's registered on my Find iPhone in my iTunes account. That person and I have since parted ways on bad terms. I changed my passwords to make sure that person cannot temper with my account. That person's phone, however, has stayed in Find iPhone for me to see. I tried to remove it (only possible when it is turned off), but it reappeared. \nThe only option I seem have is to remotely erase the iPhone. Will the other person have any means to see that I remotely deleted it? Or will it just be erased? Follow-up: If they restore from backup, will they appear in Find iPhone again? I need a way to get rid of that phone from my account.\nDisclaimer: I do not, under any circumstances, want to talk to that person.\n\nA: Remotely wiping a device, as long as you don't set a lock screen message, will look just like a regular wipe of the phone. However, the person with the phone will have to enter your Apple ID password to use it again.\nThe reason the phone keeps showing up on Find My iPhone is that your Apple ID is still on the phone, to remove it, all you need to do is wipe it then select remove from account. The person with the phone will not need to enter your password to use it again.\n", "Q: Difference between macOS login root and Darwin Terminal root The recent major security flaw in macOS 11.13.[1,2] has turned the usual advice of not enabling the root account on its head. But it has left me a bit confused about exactly what root account is being discussed.\nThe Darwin shell has a root account listed, and has many files and directories listed as owned by root, but macOS has no login account enabled for root.\nWhat's the difference between the root account listed as an existing owner for files in the Terminal, and the (disabled) root login account?\n\nA: The root user (UID 0) exists in every Unix or Unix-like operating system. Every process of a Unix operating systems must run as a valid user/UID, independently of system processes, daemons, services or user-initiated applications. Every basic system-process runs under UID 0 (root), and every system-relevant file is owned by that user. For reasons of security, some processes are running as different \"users\" with lesser privileges than the superuser root. Such users are there for the solely purpose to start services, such as a webserver, a database, the window server and so on. This means, not every user configured on Unix (or macOS) is a \"real\" user. In fact, most of those system-users can not log-in interactively.   \nFor example a webserver (nginx, apache, ...) will be started by a script running under UID 0 (=root). The webserver-process afterwards drops the privileges to a specific UID (in this case, it could be the user www). www is not a real user and cannot be used to log in to the system interactively.\nThere are two ways to \"deactivate\" a (system) user:   \n\n\n*\n\n*set the user shell to /bin/false (or any non valid-shell)   \n\n*disable the users's password, setting it to an invalid, empty or specific value.    \n\n\nOn macOS AFAIK a non-valid user has an empty password and a specific property set on the local OpenDirectory server.   \nUsually, for a request like \"is this a valid user\" the OpenDirectory service in macOS does a simple check on the requested user and returns true (user can log in) or false (user cannot log in).\nIt seems, Apples bug was not to check user's validity but to set it to enabled. On already enabled accounts this had no effect, but disabled accounts  became valid, enabled accounts. And since a disabled user has no password, an empty password was accepted as a valid option to log in as superuser/root.\n\nA: File ownership does not require that a user can login. Files that run the operating system are typically owned by root and are placed by an installation process that requires some form of authentication. Also, the operating system uses other users that run processes beside root. These user usually have their shell set to /bin/false ,cannot login, and may produce files owned by themselves.\nTo list users on your system and their shell:\ndscl . list /Users UserShell\n\nTo find files on your system not owned by root or you:\nsudo find -x / ! \\( -user root -o -user \"$(id -un)\" \\) -exec ls -ld {} +\n\n", "Q: Changing macOS Calculator to degrees mode?

EtreCheck hasn't flagged anything as a problem. I've been running Virtual Box since long before the problem started, and I didn't upgrade it around the time the problem started. The Intel HAXM might have been installed or upgraded around the time I started having problems, but I'm only about 20% confident in that. I'm pretty sure I had the same issues with it removed.\nI don't see anything obvious in the logs, but there are also a lot of log entries and I'm not entirely sure what to look for. \nMy battery is reporting \"Service Battery\" (cycle count = 895) and it definitely doesn't last as long as it used to (probably 3-6 hours at best).\nI've done SMC reset, and NVRAM reset.

Set startup disk from System Prefs, and that resulted in the same black screen/no boot. Held power down to force off, then held option to get disk selector, but only got the internal drive showing (the USB activity LED did light up during the startup). I selected that and got the usual progress bar then the login screen, but after logging in everything froze and the screen went black again. That's something new.\nUPDATE 2: And now Startup Manager won't load anymore.\n\nA: It appears it was a hardware issue... I hope. Machine is currently with Apple having the logic board replaced. I recently discovered that the discrete GPU was not showing up under System Report, nor could gfxCardStatus detect or force it to be used. It seems my machine was one of the \"very few\" impacted by the nVidia chipset issue affecting machines from about 2011-2013, and apparently OS X is resilient enough that it just carries on in the face of soldered-on hardware suddenly disappearing, and doesn't consider that something worthy of bothering the user with.\n", "Q: iPad app to take notes in mathematics I would like to take mathematical notes with my iPad so that at the end of the process I would have a PDF file of A4 pages.\nDo you have any idea?\nPS: I have tried Nebo but it is too complicated to type a whole page of mathematics.\n\nA: I would recommend Noteshelf 2 or GoodNotes.

I do not want to turn off spellcheck entirely. I still need to verify that what I have written is correct. I just need to combo my preferred languages.\n\nA: The best you can do for apps that use the Apple facilities is to go to system preferences/keyboard/text/spelling/setup (at the bottom of the list) and check the boxes for only those languages you want to check, and then set it to \"automatic\".\nHow well it works for your particular requirements can only be determined by testing.  As far as I know, multilingual only works with languages for which dictionaries are provided by Apple.\nSome apps like MS Word have their own spellcheck systems.\n", "Q: root entries in last command I ran the last command in my terminal on my macbook pro high sierra and in the output where entries for the root user.

If your optical drive is not longer available, virtual machine software such as VirtualBox can be substituted, but the installation process becomes significantly more complex. Usually a USB drive can not be used to install any version of Windows on such Macs.\nThe good news is your machine probably can run Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10. If Apple does not support a new versioner of Windows, generally the older drivers can be used to install Windows. I have the current version of Windows 10 running on 2007 and 2011 iMacs.\nAlso, you probably will need to install Windows to boot using the legacy BIOS boot method. The primary reason for this has to due with the Windows Support Software provided by Apple. The drivers included are designed for a BIOS boot and therefore can cause problems if one attempts as installation using a EFI boot method. \n", "Q: How to limit system processes cpu usage?

You can also edit the priority of a currently running process by using renice.\nhome:~ user$ yes > /dev/null &\n[1] 2492\nhome:~ user$ renice -n 20 2492\n\nThis will change the priority of the already started process. It is worth pointing out that the yes process still runs at 100%, as this is not really throttling it. Rather, nice makes it so that if multiple programs are competing for resources, the yes program will slowdown and leave your more important tasks alone.\nYou can see here for more discussion of setting priority on Mac.\n\nA: An application I have found useful is Turbo Boost Switcher.\nIt prevents the CPU from going over the base clock.

My menubar turns all sorts of states on external monitors.\nI have a 3-monitor-setup on an iMac 5K. I use two external Dell displays to the left and right of the built-in screen. On my right display, when it is inactive, the menubar turns completely transparent, except for the status icons. On my left display, everything stays normal, whether active or not. On my main display the menubar turns opaque white (including status icons) when inactive.\nHere's a screenshot of the situation on the main monitor with white top bar: \nAnd here it is on the right-most-display (icons blurred for privacy): \nSeveral reboots and even a macOS update (it happened on 10.13.0, too) didn't fix it, neither did manually killing SystemUIServer. What can I do?\nInstalled tweaks affecting the menubar (no difference when disabling): Bartender, BetterTouchTool\nOS: macOS High Sierra 10.3.1 (17B1003)\n\nA: I had this same issue. Using dark mode my screen would appear with the whiteout menu bar on my macbook pro when switched to working in my 2nd monitor. It appears there was a colour profile issue in Settings>Display>Colour Tab. I changed my colour profile to a generic colour on both displays then back to my chosen profile. So far this seems to have fixed the issue. \n\nA: I had this issue after changing the colour profile of my Macbook and external display from Native to sRGB. Moving back to native or another wider colour gammut profile seemed to resolve the issue for me. Glad I found this as it was really bugging me for weeks.\n\nA: I noticed that only 2 of my 4 desktops had the white menu bar; I just deleted those desktops.\n\nA: I was able to resolve this by going into Settings > General and toggling \"Use dark menu bar and dock\" off and back on. \n\nA: I believe the issue is surrounding the color profile utilized by OS X.  I (for example) use Flux and right now I have 2 LG Ultrafine 22\" plugged in and I was getting this white bar.  I ordered new cables, I reversed them I went thru a few trials and errors.  It kept coming back!\nI then turned to the color profile.\nSystem Preferences -> Displays -> Color\nI figured this out due to having a Samsung CF791 Ultrawide too and its color setting was horrible.  Default it was purple instead of blue and I had to switch it to sRGB IEC61966-2.1.  At that point I saw the white menu bar wasn't coming back.\nSo try out changing your color profile.  I still periodically will see a white menu bar on boot on one monitor but when it click it it goes away and doesn't come back.\n\nA: I found that the only way to fix this is to turn Dark Mode off in the general menu under system preferences.\nBut I like Dark Mode sooo....\n", "Q: How do I listen to podcasts on my Apple Watch? I have a few podcasts which I want to listen to on my Apple Watch. I know that it’s possible to transfer music from an iPhone to an Apple Watch, but there doesn’t seem to be a similar option for podcasts.\nSpecifically, I’m looking for a way to have my podcasts play from my Apple Watch’s speakers, rather than playing from my phone’s speakers.\nHow can I listen to podcasts with my Apple Watch?\n\nA: Apple doesn't yet support this out of the box, so you've essentially got two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Option 1 involves using iTunes on a Mac/PC to change the metadata of your podcasts and adding them to a playlist and syncing this across\n\n*Option 2 is somewhat easier but does mean having to use third party apps\n\n\nOption 1 \nThis is the longer option, but does mean not having to pay for any third party apps.\n\n\n*\n\n*On your Mac/PC, open iTunes \n\n*Find the podcasts you'd like to listen to on your Apple Watch\n\n*Select the podcast and press commandI (Note: You can select multiple podcasts if you want)\n\n*The Podcast Info window will appear (Note: If you selected multiple podcasts at Step 3, you will first be asked if you're sure you want to edit info for multiple items)\n\n*Click on the Options tab\n\n*Change the media kind field at the top from Podcast to Music\n\n*Click OK.\n\n*Create a playlist specifically for your Apple Watch\n\n*Add your podcast(s) to this playlist \n\n*On your iPhone open the Watch app\n\n*Make sure you have My Watch selected at bottom-left\n\n*Swipe up and tap on the Music option\n\n*Tap on the + Add Music option\n\n*Select the playlist you created at Steps 8-9\n\n\nNow you have a native way to play podcasts on your Apple Watch. My belief is Apple will create a Podcasts app in a future version of watchOS, but until then this is the only Apple way to listen to podcasts.\nNOTE: The above steps also work for Audio Books, but not those that have Digital Rights Management (DRM) protection (such as Audible books, etc).\nOption 2\nWatchPlayer transfers podcast episodes directly to the Apple Watch so they can be played without an iPhone. \nOvercast used to provide this functionality, but for some strange reason this feature was removed before the Apple Watch Series 3 went on sale. My hope is that they'll offer this functionality again soon, especially since the Apple Watch has really started to mature as a product and the LTE models don't need an iPhone around while you go for a run etc.\nAnd of course, there'll be other apps as well that offer this functionality.\nNOTE: I am not affiliated in any way with either WatchPlayer or Overcast.\n", "Q: How to type monospaced numbers using system font in macOS?

Recently my Mac is showing up some weird messages such as \"Month 13 is out of bounds\".\n\nHow do I fix this error I can't go to ant apple authorized repair centre because it is very far away from an Apple centre\n\nA: I had the same issue with extremely high UserEventAgent CPU and memory usage starting at the beginning of December 2017. Console showed the \"month out of bounds\" error as described above.\nI tried disk utility \"first aid,\" reboots, safe mode (to clear system cache), clearing NVRAM and SMD, nothing helped. I did notice that the CPU and memory usage didn't spike in safe mode.\nLike @tgray and u/kidtexas, at some point I figured out that if I disabled all my custom launchd plists that the problem didn't occur.\nI eventually wrote the little script below to help me debug which plist was causing the issue. It ended up being a plist that runs on the first of every month:\n<key>StartCalendarInterval</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>Day</key>\n    <integer>1</integer>\n    <key>Hour</key>\n    <integer>03</integer>\n    <key>Minute</key>\n    <integer>00</integer>\n</dict>\n\nMany of my plists use the StartCalendarInterval key, and using the script below I could show that they didn't seem to cause the spiking RAM and memory issues, so it's not entirely clear to me why one specific plist cause the problem. Regardless, this is how I sorted it out.\nI strongly recommend readers look through the script to try to understand what it does instead of just copy and paste. Specifically, as written this will only work for plists in ~/Library/LaunchAgents (not /Library/LaunchDaemons and others), and it intentionally only tests plists whose filename and <key>Label</key> follow the specific pattern: com.USERNAME.my_plist_name[.plist]. Before running it, I used a one-liner to bootout all of my plists: for plist in com.\"$(whoami)\".*.plist; do launchctl bootout gui/\"${MYUID}\"/\"${plist%.plist}\" || true; done, and then verified they no longer appeared under launchctl list results.\n#! /bin/bash\n# https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/307512/month-13-is-out-of-bounds\n\nset -euf -o pipefail\n\nMYUID=\"$(id -u)\"\n\npushd \"${HOME}\"/Library/LaunchAgents\n\nwhile IFS= read -r -d '' plist; do\n  echo \"${plist}\"\n  stats=($(ps ux | grep -v grep | grep UserEventAgent | awk '{ print $3, $5}'))\n  cpu=\"${stats[0]}\"\n  vmem=\"${stats[1]}\"\n  echo \"CPU use and virtual memory size while disabled: ${stats[@]}\"\n  launchctl bootstrap gui/\"${MYUID}\" \"${plist}\"\n  sleep 5\n  stats=($(ps ux | grep -v grep | grep UserEventAgent | awk '{ print $3, $5}'))\n  echo \"CPU use and virtual memory size while enabled: ${stats[@]}\"\n  echo \"Change in vmem: $(( \"${vmem}\" - \"${stats[1]}\" ))\"\n  echo\ndone < <(find . -iname \"com.$(whoami).*.plist\" -print0)\n\npopd\n\n\nA: This error is logged on iOS 11 and on macOS 10.13 for sure and I'm not seeing it cause any specific function or problem on any platform.\nI'll link to the main question here about \"does macOS log too much\" since that's an opinion and impression that is worthy of discussion. Some people might feel better if there were no messages unless a really serious condition needs action. Others want even more detail so they can know what's happening / learn / measure. So, it's going to be a tradeoff how these are issues / categorized / used.\n\n\n*\n\n*Fresh macOS install: Console.app displays errors/faults.

I had the same issue yesterday, and after a restart, the computer was rendered almost useless due to this error. For some reason, the computer can't deal with this month and throws errors wherever there are databases or plists.\nTo fix this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Activity Monitor and force quit two processes: lsd, UserEventAgent\n\n*Open System Preferences and navigate to \"Date & Time\"\n\n*Uncheck \"Set date and time automatically\"\n\n*In the calendar, select a date prior to December 2017 and press Save\n\n*If UserEventAgent or lsd continue to cause problems, then force quit them again after setting the date.\nOther people here have this problem\nWhy?\nIt seems to me, UserEventAgent was attempting to use two plist files:\nSystem/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.UserEventAgent-Aqua.plist\n\nand\nSystem/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.UserEventAgent-LoginWindow.plist\n\nWhen it tried to use the plists, it got an error:\nMonth 13 is out of bounds\n\nI'm not sure what actually happened within UserEventAgent, but it's obvious that when it gets the error, it cannot deal with it and causes high CPU and RAM usage.\n\nA: Like others, I was having high CPU usage and huge RAM usage from UserEventAgent (see my comment above).  Changing the date to November and force quitting UserEventAgent fixed things.  This all started on Saturday after I rebooted.\nFix\nI figured this out for me.  Hopefully for others with issues, this will work for you.\nThe issue was a LaunchAgent plist I have in ~/Library/LaunchAgents.  It's a simple plist file that calls StartCalendarInterval, which is a valid key for launchd plists.  The LaunchAgent job calls a shell script that copies some files to a backup location on the first day of the month.  The job is not being called at all - I think it is launchd checking the loaded jobs against the Calendar which is causing the issue.  As soon as I unloaded this plist and moved the file out of the directory, UserEventAgent was fine (after a force quit).   The second I loaded the plist (launchctl load xxxx), UserEventAgent went nuts.\nStartCalendarInterval is a valid key for launchd as seen here in Apple's docs.\nSo for anyone having issues, check your LaunchAgent directories and looks for the StartCalendarInterval key (or any other calendar related key).  I did not have any issues with the time based interval plists.\nNote: This doesn't fix the 'Month 13 out of bounds' errors, just the crazy UserEventAgent behavior.\n\nA: After reporting this to Apple and scaling the escalation chain, I was told this should be fixed in macOS 10.13.3.\nApparently, this is caused by an application calling the Deprecated NSDate procedure ‘descriptionWithCalendarFormat’. \nYou can read more at https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/88417.\nIn some cases, editing or removing certain plist files will prevent programs from calling the deprecated procedure, but the real fix is an OS update.\n", "Q: High Sierra quicktime player does not support H.265 videos?

What does this accomplish? It's been suggested that for extra security I should set the shell for root to to /usr/bin/false. Does it still make sense to do that?\n\nA: Basically bash and sh are two different shells, have a look here. Maybe an Apple employee liked sh more than bash and changed? :-)\nThis question and answer discuss login shells in some details. But the short answer is yes, it always makes sense to put the login shell for root to something non-existing. \n(Technically it is not always, but in those cases you hopefully don't have to ask that question :-) )\n", "Q: Mail.app Won't Change Message Font Size macOS Sierra 10.12.6, Mail.app 10.3, \nI can change the size of the message list font in Mail > Preferences > Fonts & Colors, and the change is reflected in Mail.app's message list. However, changes to the message font are not reflected by a change in the message display. \nThis behavior appears on two computers, a Macbook Pro 7,1 (mid-2010) and a Macbook Air 6,1 (mid-2013). Both computers' software is updated. In all other respects, both computers operate correctly.\nIs there a cache or plist to clear or something else to do to allow the message font size to change? \n\nA: Reviewing this thread in Apple community discussions, it seems that:\na) incoming email font/color/size is determined by what the sender specified;\nb) the receiver's message list display is determined by what's set in the receiver's Mail > Preferences > Fonts & Colors > Message List Font; and\nc) the receiver's reply (or new message) font/color/size is determined by sender's settings in Mail > Preferences > Fonts & Colors > Message Font\nWhat I'm looking for — that a received message be displayed in a font larger than what's specified by the sender — is apparently not available short of Applescript or add-on app.\nSigh. \n", "Q: Could the High Sierra root bug have been exploited over SSH? I'm sure we're all familiar with the recent security issue in High Sierra/OSX 10.13. It is well known that remote access can be gained using Screen Share, but I've not seen anything definite regarding the feasibility of a similar exploit over SSH, so:\nCould this bug have been exploited over SSH, either with the default settings or after changing them?\n(that is, attempt to log in over ssh as a nonexistent root user, thereby creating the root user in the same manner as when exploiting in person)\nMy thinking is that this shouldn't be possible by default, as the default sshd_config PermitRootLogin is probably set to no, but I've seen comments that suggest it is possible sometimes, which strikes me as being much more serious.\nI don't own a mac, so I'm not able to verify for myself.\n\nA: The login mechanism for SSH and for Aqua are two entirely different things.\nsshd is the OpenSSH daemon (what allows you to log in via SSH) is sourced from BSD.  This vulnerability doesn't exist there.  \nAdditionally, the default configuration for OpenSSH is to disalow the root user to login whereas this bug/flaw allows you to log in as root with no password by simply pressing a button twice.\n", "Q: MBP USB-C charger can't keep up when busy. Is that normal? I have a Macbook Pro 15\" (2016 with Touchbar).  The 87 W USB-C charger doesn't keep the battery from discharging when the CPU is working hard (baking lighting for Unity in this case).  This limits the amount of time it can work at this level to maybe an hour until the battery runs out.\nIs this normal, or is my power adapter or some other part of the charging system under-performing?\nThe Activity Monitor graph shows the CPU about 80% utilized.\n\nA: Yes - when the GPU is full power and the CPU is committed, you could drain things faster than the charger can provide. I’ve not seen it often, but you are certainly able to run things past what most chargers can provide.\nNow if you can get this without any external displays connected and when the integrated (logic board) GPU is running and not past 75% CPU load, I would suspect you either have a bad cable, bad adapter or less likely need a repair on the Mac.\nNow - one hour battery is clearly an issue. This draining should be slow and run several hours if you are running mostly on wall power and only a little on draining the battery.\nThink if you were flying a plane and refueling - you should be topping off slowly or perhaps burning more than you can take in in some cases but you should be able to drain both your tanks and the refuel volume in an hour.\nGet the Mac to service for a diagnostic on power with that specific adapter if that’s the case.\n", "Q: Why are zip file sizes different in finder compared to Google or Amazon Drive? I was wondering why file sizes of my zipped archives (.zip) are inconsistent. A file that shows in the finder (macOS) as 9.17 GB shows up as being 8.54 GB on an Amazon Drive (same thing with Google Drive).\n\nA: This is because Apple uses base-10 instead of base-2 to display file size. Base-2 will consider 1GB to equal 1,073,741,824 bytes, where a base-10 system, like Apple's, will consider 1GB to mean 1,000,000,000 bytes. In fact, the base-2 and base-10 prefixes are different, using the term gibibyte and gigabyte to represent GB, respectively (GiB can be used to unambiguously denote gibibyte).\n9.17 Gigabytes is 8.54 Gibibytes, so the zip files are actually the same size.\nFurther reading:\nhttps://blog.macsales.com/1852-snow-leopard-changes-they-way-we-look-at-gigabytes-and-megabytes-and-kilobytes-as-well\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibibyte\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte#Consumer_confusion\n", "Q: DELL U2515H-display and Mac Mini (Late 2011) We're trying to get a DELL U2515H (2560 x 1440) running on a Mac Mini (late 2011).

But today (December 2) as I was doing my usual stuff it started behaving very strange. \nEvery 10 seconds or so a black screen with loading spinner appears, after spinning a few seconds it asks me for my passcode. As I type it everything seems to be ok, but then again loading spinner appears.\n\n\n*\n\n*I tried restarting but it doesn't help.\n\n*I reset the settings but still the problem persists.\n\n\nDid anyone encountered this?\n\nA: Update to iOS 11.2 if you have a backup or can connect to iTunes and update over USB.\nTry to turn off app notifications if you can get to settings and disable them one by one in between \"resprings\"\nOnce local notifications are off, you should have a stable phone to then make a backup or plan for an update / patch or remove the offending apps.\n\nApparently this is happening for many people in Japan since midnight. Reports from Australia as well seem to indicate this started December 2. Turning off all notifications on apps (one by one, as fast as possible in 30-40 seconds until the next restart) seems to have helped many. Others report moving the time back helps this but breaks other functions so this might be a time based bug on iOS 11.1.2 and earlier\nhttp://did2memo.net/2017/12/02/iphone-ios-11-auto-restart-bug-en/\nThe initial analysis is that a local notification where the app sets a daily meditation or daily writing reminder is causing the home screen to “respring” when the time to present the notification arrives or when the processing starts on 2 December. \n\nIf you have an App Store app installed that sends local notifications, once you hit December 2, 2017 local time, your iPhone could begin to crash.\n\nhttps://www.imore.com/iphone-crashing-dec-2-heres-fix\nIt seems prudent to connect to a computer to back up if you can or initiate an iCloud backup now.

My 2007 Mac Mini is used as a TV media device, for watching free-to-air TV channels and Youtube. It cannot be upgraded past 10.6.8.\nI read somewhere that older OS X can be vulnerable to unnoticed outside hacking, cannot find the reference anymore. Is this so? Is there a way to detect?\n\nA: Yes, there's a variety of exploits available. Though there's no one complete list, there's certainly a variety (see this one), including Shellshock, a remote exploit in Bash, and SeaPea, a root exploit. Apple will not patch these issues, as Snow Leopard is no long supported in any capacity.\nWhile if you're careful, Snow Leopard isn't the end of the world, if you're concerned even remotely about security, given your use case of TV and YouTube, it probably makes more sense to just load up Windows or Linux and roll with that.\n", "Q: How to use UNetbootin properly?

Then this screen appeared : \n\nTo be honest, I didn't got any ideas what to do. Is there any commands to run in this window ?\n\nA: Unetbootin wasn't designed with Windows in mind, and while it does support it, it doesn't install necessary drivers required by Apple laptops for Windows by default. It's highly recommended to use Boot Camp instead.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Start up your Mac in macOS.\n  \n*Use the compatibility tables to make sure you have a Mac that supports the version of Windows you're installing.\n  \n*If your copy of Windows came on a DVD, you might need to create a disk image of it to work with Boot Camp.\n  \n*Connect a 16GB or larger USB flash drive that you can erase.

There has been a large amount of confusion around Security Update 2017-001, especially due to rumors of the fix being reverted when running macOS version 10.13.1.\nI am looking for a way to be fully sure that my Mac is protected. In this question I'll detail the steps I followed in trying to ensure that my device is secure, and note the conflicting information I have found which points to no precise answer.\n\nLooking at the end of Apple's support page related to this update, I see:\n\n[If] you see MRTConfigData 1.27 in the Installations list under\n  Software in System Report, your Mac is also protected.\n\nUnder Software in System Report, the latest version I see of MRTConfigData is 1.26 dated December 1, 2017.\n\nThe second part of this paragraph also notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Terminal app, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder.\n\n*Type what /usr/libexec/opendirectoryd and press Return. \n\n*If Security Update 2017-001 was installed successfully, you will see one of these project version numbers:\nopendirectoryd-483.1.5 on macOS High Sierra 10.13\nopendirectoryd-483.20.7 on macOS High Sierra 10.13.1\nRunning the above command correctly lists PROJECT:opendirectoryd-483.20.7 on my machine, which is indicated by Apple as the correct version.\n\nIf I attempt to reproduce the original bug by going to Preferences > Users & Groups, then clicking the lock icon and trying to log in as root using an empty password multiple times, the login dialog does not let me through.\nThe fact that I won't be allowed to log in as root no matter how many times I try gives me an indication that the issue might indeed be solved, but I   am still receiving conflicting information about this from my system.\n\n\nIn Directory Utility, when I open the Edit menu, I see the option Enable Root User. This tells me that the root user is currently disabled, which as far as I know is one of the conditions for triggering the bug: the root account gets enabled once you attempt to log in with it once, and then works without a password.\n\n\nLastly, what is most suspicious is that in Directory Utility, when I search for root in Directory Editor, the root user account is listed with a password of *. Unless it is a placeholder for any password, this looks suspiciously similar to a one-character (or even empty) password. I am confused whether this means that a password for this account is set at all.\n\n\nHow can I conclusively determine whether the root account issue is fully solved on my computer?\n\nA: You can't at this point. The security patch only runs once and Apple hasn't released a new full point installer that guarantees you're patched.\nWhat you can do is set a secure root password and watch for log in attempts and successes and disable sharing until Apple releases a full OS point release with no need for a Security patch to be put on top of one or more unpatched full point releases.\nMy answer here stands:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/307244/5472\nIf you can’t install the official patch or don't want to trust that it worked, then \nYou don't want to disable root user on High Sierra only.\nTo secure your Mac, enable root with a long secure password.\nWe are not changing this at work until the next full point release is out for macOS which would likely be 10.13.2\nI reason that since this was a race condition and Apple pushed the patch so quickly - we're pretty sure it's solid, but what if you got the patch before you upgraded to 10.13.1 and now it needs that patch a second time or what if the installer didn't really do it's job. Low chance either happened, but only you know how bad a breach would be on your computer with someone having total control.\n", "Q: How to send encrypted email using Mail app?

Optionally add more email addresses, separated by space, which you may want to use the certificate for\n\n\n*On the last dialog Specify a Location For The Certificate, you can select Login\nStep 4: Alice creates a certificate for Bob\nNow Alice repeats step 3 to create a certificate for Bob, then exports his certificate in .p12 format, gives it to him, and Bob imports it into his keychain. \nNote: This is the easiest way to create Bob's certificate, yet not the recommended way. This is because Alice creates Bob's private key, so Bob has to trust Alice. Actually Bob would use the Certificate Assistent on his computer to Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority. \nStep 5: Alice and Bob send each other signed messages\nAlice sends a signed email message to Bob, and Bob sends a signed email message to Alice. If all went well, the signatures will display as trusted because both trust the CA certificate. \nStep 6: Alice and Bob can exchange encrypted email messages\nBoth can reply to the signed message using encryption with the reply message.\n\nA: This is not going to be easy. Depending on why you want to use encrypted email, it might be far easier to look over the threat model and say - get an app like Signal that handles the encryption decisions and you know you are sending encrypted information only using that app.\nMessages is also a viable encryption option for many people but I chose Signal since it has windows / linux / android clients and mail is typically chosen when you need to have as wide a client OS profile as possible.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://ssd.eff.org/en\n\n*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_%28software%29\nUnless your users of encryption are more trained than the EFF link above requires you to be to use Signal - jumping to secure email seems a far more lofty goal and not something you could drop in a \"three paragraph here's how to secure email on macOS and the mail app\" answer could do justice.\nNow, if mail really is needed, here is a service that has a bridge App to ease the workload of getting PGP to mail apps easily. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/06/protonmail-bridge-outlook-thunderbird-apple-mail/\n", "Q: Elgato Eve is connected on Home app of iPhone but not on iPad I have Elgato Eve Thermo.

The error message says problems were encountered when attempt to create the folder for the backup.  I looked at a list of folders and files on the backup drive and discovered a \"package\" from a few days ago with an inProgess extention.  I tried to drag it to Trash without luck. Then, reading a suggestion (by @grgarside) to another  user with - seemingly - the same issue, I went to Terminal and executed the suggested tmutil listbackups command, but the inProgress package did not appear in the resulting list (perhaps because it's a package rather than a file?)\nDespite its path not being listed, I continued to follow the suggestions of @grgarside and executed the sudo tmutil delete /path/to/backup.inProgress command (replacing \"path/to\" with the path shown on my backup drive), but the result was this: No such file or directory (error 2)\nAny suggestions?  Please note that I'm a total novice.  I had never heard of sudo nor tmutil until reading this thread.\n\nA: Don't remove that is my advice. Apple protects the Time Machine space from anyone making changes so you need to break those locks first, then you need to unlink every single file in that directory and then delete them.\nThe system is designed to reclaim that folder the next time a backup starts, so you aren't saving yourself any time and just doing what the system will do but slower.\nI would make a decision - do you need the backups on that drive. If so, restart the Mac and then let it take a day or several to get the next backup set.\nIf not - set aside that drive and connect a new destination if you need a quick backup. Time Machine can handle multiple destinations so you can get your next backup done, then let it chew on fixing the interrupted one.\nOr - wipe that drive using Disk Utility / remove all backups of that machine using the tmutil delete to remove the machine backup and not just one interval.\nSince you're still learning of sudo - please don't use it unless you know you have a good backup and that backup isn't connected to the Mac when you run sudo and you have time to do a full erase of the OS and then full restore from your backup.\nOnce you're set with a good backup - here's the tutorial on sudo and sudo tmutil delete\nHow can I manually delete old backups to free space for Time Machine? \n", "Q: Can I still boot into Single User Mode if I disable the shell for root?

Then I reinstalled Mac OS X. Then I realized that I didn't really want to deal with a new install, so I thought: OK, I'll try restoring from backup and see what happens. So I restored that last Time Machine backup I performed before booting into recovery mode. Been running for the past 30 minutes with no copy/paste hiccups. Will report back in a few days either way.

I am going mad trying to find the correct keyboard shortcut based on which window I have in the foreground for Copy (or Cut) and Paste.\nWith some Google searching I learned I can go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> App Shortcuts and map Ctrl + X/C/V to Cut, Copy, and Paste respectively. However, this disables Command + X/C/V, which is required if you want want to Copy (or Cut) and Paste using keyboard shortcuts in Google GSuite Sheets.\nIdeally, I would like to use Ctrl + X/C/V  or Command + X/C/V to Cut, Copy, and Paste, but I don't know how to set this up on macOS Sierra.\nI spend much of my time in these problems to access different Windows environments:\n\n\n*\n\n*Jump Desktop\n\n*Microsoft Remote Desktop\n\n*Parallels\n\n\nI prefer to someone map the keys at the macOS level, instead of inside these problems.\nCan someone tell me how this could be done?\n\nA: You don’t specify what software you’re using to create your virtual machines, but usually you’ll have an option in its settings to allow the VM to recognise both the command and CTRL keys interchangeably for the Cut/Copy/Paste keyboard shortcuts.\nFor example, if you’re using Parallels Desktop, you can customise your keyboard shortcuts by going to the Parallels Desktop menu in the Mac menu bar and navigating to Preferences → Shortcuts and selecting your VM from the list.\nSo I would check your VM configurations to see if you’ve got the option of doing this. Doing so means you can’t go wrong in your virtual machine.\nIn terms of the macOS side of things, you can refer to Karabiner (or, more specifically for macOS Sierra, Karabiner Elements) for some advanced  keyboard shortcut functionality.\n", "Q: Create a text encoding conversion service in Automator I was trying to make a Finder service to easily convert text encoding of some files.

Thank you\n\nA: Are you using an Apple original or MFi certified charger and cable? The charging circuits built into Apple iDevices can be damaged by cheap chargers. They will give the appearance of charging, what we call \"fake charging\" but not really charging at all. This usually requires a logic board level repair.\nHowever in your case, it may just be a dead battery as the iPad mini is an old device and the battery may have just up and died after you let it deplete down to near 0%. You shouldn't worry about getting your butt kicked...these things happen. You should tell them the battery appears to be dead and if they never had it replaced, they should consider bringing it into a repair shop for a battery replacement.\n", "Q: There was an error in Security & Privacy preferences I head on to Security & Privacy on Filevault and try to encrypt my disk.

Adding \\ from seems to break things.\n\nA: This post is old, but I struggled with it, so I thought I'd help.  The reason the \"\\ from\\ Google\" doesn't work is because that is not what the process is, there is no \"from Google in the process name.

I have watched some tutorials and for the most part, I think I know what to do on the hardware side of things but I have two questions for the software side after the disk has been successfully installed. \nQuestion 1. Can I use the recovery menu (accessed by hitting command + r on boot) to both format, and install a version of MacOS? \nQuestion 2. If so, do I need to initialize the disk before installing it? Or can I literally unbox the SSD, install it in my MBP, and then format/install MacOS via recovery?\n\nA: What you do depends on how you want to setup your Mac. More specifically, do you want to just do a totally clean installation of macOS, or do you want to migrate your existing setup (including users/data) across to the SSD?\nRegardless, you will need to format the SSD first. Probably the easiest way to proceed is to connect it to your Mac via an external enclosure and then use Disk Utility to format it. \nIf you haven't got an external enclosure (or another way to connect the SSD), then you could insert the SSD into the MacBook and opt to run macOS Recovery from the Internet. To do this, hold down OptionCommandR (or, if that doesn't work, try ShiftOptionCommandR). \nNOTE: If you proceed this way then:\n\n\n*\n\n*It may be worth you testing to make sure you can boot into macOS Recovery from the internet prior to going to the trouble of physically installing the SSD into your MacBook.\n\n*The only way to migrate all your data is if you have a Time Machine backup on an external disk (i.e. if you don't have a TM backup and want to keep your current setup, then you will need to either make a TM backup first, or have a way of connecting the SSD or the internal drive to your Mac for migrating the data across).\n\n\nRegardless, once booted into macOS Recovery, run Disk Utility to format the SSD.\nOnce it’s formatted you can install macOS, but how you proceed will depend on how you want to setup your Mac.

On the personal one there is the the following problem that doesn't happen on the work one: on the Updates tab of the App Store, the update dates are wrong for most apps. For example, Skype for iPhone right now shows 2 days ago, but when clicking on that app, it shows 2w ago and it was indeed updated about 2 weeks ago (typically I update the apps as soon as updates show up). \nThe Date & Time are Set Automatically on both phones, the city is found correctly by the location services (Setting Time Zone is allowed). The phones are on different operators, but I don't think that they use the operator time for setting the date and time.\nWhat is most baffling is that it happens only on one phone, although both are on the same account. Any idea what may be going on and how to fix it besides trying to reinstall the phone from scratch?\n\nA: Not to take away from Allan's or drivec's answers, as I do think they have pieces of the puzzle, but the real answer is a little more complicated. \ndrivec is correct about a 'bug', but the bug is actually an interaction issue between iOS 11 and the iOS App Store. \nThis bug presents itself by listing apps as having fresh updates, when many of them do not!\nExample\nI have an iPhone 6s, as does my wife. I also have a number of apps I've developed, available on the App Store. As you would imagine, I have these apps installed on my iPhone, as does my wife. \nNow, here are the interesting things: \n\n\n*\n\n*During the last couple of weeks, in the Updates tab within the App Store app on my iPhone, I've seen a number of my apps listed at various stages. Now, these apps have not been updated since Feb/Mar/Apr of this year!!! \n\n*My wife's iPhone does not list these apps as having updates available, even though the same apps are installed on her phone. So, I got update notifications for apps I know have not been updated, and my wife hasn't received the same notifications.\n\n\nThe first time this happened I was rather confused, to say the least. I looked at my apps on the App Store and they still showed me as the developer, and they still showed the correct version numbers and in the Version History the correct timeframe of when the latest version was released. But, if I go back to the Updates screen, it'll show 2 days ago, or a date from last week, etc. \nI reported this to Apple and they are aware of it (having received reports from other developers). And it is something they're working on.\nFinally, Allan is also correct because the dates shown on the Updates page does indicate the date the updates were installed, while going into the App's individual pages and looking at the version history shows the date the app's latest version was released. \nHowever, because of this bug, what is happening is that people are installing updates when in fact there is no need to do so, but when they do the dates appearing on the Updates tab change to the more recent date, even though the exact same version of the app may have been released months or even years earlier. And, since this bug is not necessarily presenting itself on all iPhones, or even with the same apps on different iPhones, it's only adding to the confusion.\nNOTE:\nWhen speaking with Apple about this, they informed me that they were updating apps so that they're signed with Apple's latest signing certificate. However, in those cases, Apple was pre-populatng the \"What's new\" text with the following text:\n\nThis update is signed with Apple's latest signing certificate. No new\n  features are included.\n\nSo, if apps are listed as having updates available, and the above text is shown, then they're not being affected by the bug I refer to here in my answer. However, it is possible that perhaps they're appearing in the Updates tab because of the certificate signing, and for some reason the \"What's new\" text isn't pre-populating correctly.\n\nA: I believe you are confusing the installation date with the release date.\nFor example, I have two apps for which updates were both installed on the same day (Nov. 30th) but different dates (days) on which they were released.  The two apps are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Microsoft To-Do\n\n*JetBlue \n\n\n\nHowever, if I go into the individual pages, Microsoft's shows 5d ago and JetBlue's shows 6d ago. Two apps;  updated at exactly the same time (Nov 30th) but with different \"dates\"\n\n\nNote:  I would provide more examples, however this is a new phone and I don't have an installed and updated App more than 8 days old.  However, as I was writing this answer, and checking the updates under the App Store app, an update for Netflix came in.  As Netflix is not critical, I will delay the update a few days to test and verify this premise.\n\nA: Based on what I am seeing, this is a bug in iOS 11 and has no clear user-facing fix or workaround. You should file a bug report here. If you are using a public iOS beta, follow the bug reporting channels provided by Apple.\nPreviously, iOS 10 allowed you to clear the App Store cache by tapping one of the App Store tabs 10 times in quick succession. This no longer functions in iOS 11.\n", "Q: MBP won't startup, disk is full I've used Migration Assistant to move my old user account from Windows to Mac. After a while the disk on my Mac being full. Now the Mac won't startup\nI've tried to enter in Safe mode, but it doesn't start.\nI've tried from Recovery mode>Terminal but there is follow error: no space left on device.\nI haven't another Mac, only a PC.\nHow I can access to Mac disk and delete some files?\n\nA: The first thing to do is backup your data, although if you were migrating from the PC to the Mac, then you've probably already got an original copy there anyway.\nIf you have a backup, then probably the easiest thing to do is create a bootable external drive, boot your Mac up from that, and then delete files from the internal drive.\nIf you have an external USB hard drive, you can start up from macOS Recovery to format it and install macOS. More specifically, you have the following macOS Recovery options:\n\n\n*\n\n*commandR to reinstall the latest macOS that was installed on your Mac, without upgrading to a later version \n\n*optioncommandR to upgrade to the latest macOS that is compatible with your Mac\n\n*shiftoptioncommandR to reinstall the macOS that came with your Mac, or the version closest to it that is still available\n\n\nBroadly speaking, follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot up into macOS Recovery using one of the options above\n\n*Use the Disk Utility option to erase/format the external USB drive (NOTE: This means you will lose all data on it. Another option is to use a USB Thumb Drive of at least 8GB in size, although this will probably be a lot slower).\n\n*Once it's formatted, install macOS. (This will take a while).\n\n*Once complete, boot up from the external drive by holding the option key during startup and then selecting it to boot off.\n\n*Once booted up into macOS from your external drive, your Mac's internal drive should be accessible as if it's an external drive.\n\n*Delete files from the internal drive. (Note: You will want to ensure you have at least about 9GB of free space in order for macOS to function properly. However, my recommendation is that you generally was to have no less than about 15% of your drive's capacity free).\n\n*Make sure you don't forget to empty the Trash (Finder > Empty Trash...)\n\n*When you've freed up enough space, go to Apple > System Preferences > Startup Disk and make sure you've selected the internal drive as your startup disk\n\n*Shut Down your Mac (Apple > Shut Down...)\n\n\nBarring any other issues, you should now be able to boot up from your internal drive. \n\nA: There might be a simpler way just boot off your mac to single user mode by holding CMD+S at start-up chime hold it till you see plain text  then type mount -uw  then type cd /Users/homedirectoryname/. Then suppose you want to delete a file in desktop named cat.txt then type rm -R desktop/cat.txt and and if you want to delete a file named John folder which has spaces then the path to the folder will be John\\ folder. It is actually a bit tuff but all the best. And if you want to delete all the png or jpg files in a folder     . Then type /Folder/*.png and if you are wondering what * is it means all the files under a directory so when you type *.png or *.jpg it means delete all the files with extension .png. Same applies for any extension. Oh after finishing type exit this will boot to your system.\n", "Q: How can I stop my Mac from automatically upgrading to High Sierra? As per the title. If I have a Mac running Sierra, what can/should I do if I don’t want to be upgraded to High Sierra?\nI’ve already unchecked “Install macOS updates” in System Preferences:\n\nbut I’m wondering if there’s anything else I should be doing. (Or can do, because I’m not sure I trust that checkbox.)\n\nWhy?\nThis weekend, one of my Macs got unexpectedly upgraded from Sierra to High Sierra, but I don’t remember asking for the upgrade. (I say “upgraded”, what I mean is “freeze, crash, then reboot twice”. Is this a new installation procedure?) A bunch of stuff is now broken, yay.\nI’m downgrading to a backup taken when my Mac was on Sierra. When I’m back up, I want to ensure I don’t get another unwanted upgrade.\nNormally I would just follow a policy of “don’t hit the upgrade button”, but this weekend’s experience suggests that’s no longer enough. :-/\n\nA: I'm not aware that anything has changed in terms of macOS upgrades. \nThe only Mac I have with macOS High Sierra actually shipped with it, while all the others regularly inform me of the upgrade, but none have actually been upgraded to macOS High Sierra. The ones that support macOS High Sierra but haven't upgraded are either running El Capitan 10.11.6 or Sierra 10.12.6.\nSo, based on your settings, you should be fine.\n\nA: Apple has decided to automatically download the macOS High Sierra installer onto Macs running El Capitan or Sierra, a support document states the following:\nIf you’re using OS X El Capitan v10.11.5 or later, High Sierra conveniently downloads in the background, making it even easier to upgrade your Mac. When the download has completed, you receive a notification indicating that High Sierra is ready to be installed. Click Install in the notification to get started.\nIf you want to install High Sierra later, just dismiss the notification. Install it at any time by opening the file named Install macOS High Sierra from your Applications folder, Launchpad, or Spotlight. Or delete the installer by dragging it to the Trash. You can always get it again from the App Store.\nHow to Prevent macOS High Sierra from Automatically Downloading\n", "Q: What is the loopback interface lo0 on Macs? What is the loopback interface lo0 on Macs? What's the use of it? Does it have any vulnerabilities? \n\nA: Loopback is a virtual interface that is an integral part of all TCP/IP network interfaces on all generally available operating systems. From Wikipedia:\n\nAny traffic that a computer program sends to a loopback IP address is\n  simply and immediately passed back up the network software stack as if\n  it had been received from another device.\n\nSince loopback interfaces don't send data anyplace but back from where they came you will not generally find ways to hack a system using loopback. That does not mean it can't or has not been done but it is not something to generally worry about.\n", "Q: How do I measure Heart Rate Variability? Intermittently, and with no pattern I can discern, my Watch measures \"Heart Rate Variability\". But I don't see a way to measure this on demand, and I can't find any apps that measure it directly (those that do use the camera and not Watch, and don't share with Apple Health).\nHow can I preform a HRV measurement on demand with Watch?\n\nA: Looking at the history of HRV measurements in my Health app, they seem to correspond to times I've used the Breathe app on my phone. \nIt seems that doing a Breathe session will do an on-demand measurement of HRV, and this agrees with a post in the forums on MacRumors.\n", "Q: Apple Watch 3 - How to track movement in tennis? I have both an Apple Watch and iPhone. When I play tennis, my iPhone lays on the table. What setting do I need to set, in order for the watch to track my movement?\nCurrently it tracks the movement of the iPhone, so during my training, it stays at 0KM for the whole time. It works like this regardless if I use Endomondo or the Workout app.\n\nA: we have also developed a smartwatch app for the tennis players - BestShot\nIt tracks both the tennis swings and the health data, combining it in a game performance scorecard, which can be accessed on a phone companion app. We have been working on it for a year and we are now testing it with a few tennis players and coaches. Hopefully you will find it useful too.\n\nA: One option could be to use the Other workout in the Workout app on Apple Watch. This is generally acceptable for workouts that are not already available in the Workout app, but you can also label the workout as tennis. This excerpt from the Apple Watch User Guide explains how to label a workout —\n\nStart a workout with the type Other. When you’re done, swipe right, then tap End. Tap Name Workout, tap the type of workout you’ve finished—tennis or Tai Chi, for example—scroll to the bottom of the workout summary, then tap Done.\n\nYou can also use an app called TennisKeeper, which offers an Apple Watch app as well. Though I have never used this app, its page on the App Store advertises Apple Watch integration —\n\nThis app reads your fitness data and writes your tennis activity as a Workout to Health.

I had some issues on my machine and had to reinstall macOS High Sierra from the recovery partition. Not sure if the setup didn't complete, or maybe it just didn't work as I expected, but I ended up at a login screen with no users on the machine. So I set a password for root from single user mode and then logged into Finder as root, and now I'd like to re-create my previous user from the existing home directory.\nSo on this machine there's still a /Users/username folder with all my stuff I want to use. If I simply make a new user called username and point it to that folder, will it work or will it erase that directory? Should I make a user with a different name, and then simply copy the contents over (while logged out of the new user, from a root terminal), or make a new user and then change the home directory to it? Maybe something involving the dscl  utility?\nAs long as I can preserve all the user-installed applications, settings, keychain, etc., I'm happy.\n\nA: Well, I backed up my home directory and just went for it, and it turns out all you have to do is go through the normal flow to add a new user in Users & Groups, and then when it comes time to select a home directory, choose the one you already have. It'll ask you this:\n\nJust select \"Use Existing Folder\" and everything ~just worked~. Didn't lose any data and all my settings and sessions and everything were back when I logged in as that user.\n\nNote - I wasn't sure if permissions were going to line up, but they did. However, I might have gotten lucky. Before creating this user, when I did a directory listing in my old home directory, instead of the user name it showed the owner as just the ID, 501. After I created the user, the new user had ID 501 and so permissions all lined up. I'm not sure if the wizard was smart enough to select an ID for the new user based on the existing home directory, or if 501 is the default ID for the first non-root user. YMMV - if your existing home directory has a different ID or if you already have a non-root account on that machine, and it's not being clever about choosing the ID, you might have to chown everything, or create the user manually with with dscl tool and give it the ID you want.\n", "Q: How does one convert a dmg inside a DVD to individual videos or watch the dmg DVD file in an iphone?

One solution could be to have some app that access the DMG through dropbox/icloud and then open it with the app. Does that exist?\nWhat I thought was more sensible was since some of these are lessons divided into separate videos, to convert the DMG to individual mp4 or .mov files which are easily watchable in the iphone. Is that possible?\n\nA: DMG is a disk image file format.\nDisk image files behave like a physical disk. In so doing, the operating system interprets them in the same way as if you had just inserted a CD-ROM, USB drive, etc into the computer. \nSo, to play DVDs you've converted to a disk image such as .DMG, you'll need to do two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Expand the disk image so that the 'DVD' becomes available\n\n*Open the DVD with some sort of 'DVD player' software (because what the operating system sees is a DVD)\n\n\nIn other words, an iOS devise like an iPhone is not going to be able to play a DVD. So, backing up your DVDs to a disk image file is a great way of preserving/backing up your DVDs for future access, but it's not a way to actually play your DVDs without the appropriate operating system and software. You could certainly expand the .dmg disk images and then use a DVD Player app on a Mac to view the DVD, or burn them to a DVD to make them available to a physical DVD player.\nIf your intention is to be able to play them on an iPhone or iPad (or any other smartphone/tablet) what you'll need to do is rip the DVDs to a video file format (e.g. .mp4, .mov, etc) and then transfer these files to your device. Depending on the file format you use, you may also need to install 3rd party app to be able to play them.\nSome further reading:\n\n\n*\n\n*For more info on DMG files you may want to read my answer here.\n\n*Possible to rip a DVD as an iTunes film? \n\n*Tiger DVD Ripper\n\n*How can I rip my DVD to play them on my TV?\n\n*Is it possible to connect an external CD/DVD drive to an iOS device?\n", "Q: Most optimal way of recovering files from a non-bootable MacBook in Recovery Mode Let me first mention that a related question and answer is given in Backup to External in Recovery Mode (Terminal or Time Machine) . For the sake of completeness, I will tell the complete story about my recent nightmare. \nSome days ago, I was trying to update my MacBook Pro (13 inch version from 2011) from Sierra (the latest version of it) to High Sierra. However the installation failed and I received a message that I should restart my computer. By clicking the (unique) option \"Restart\", I ended up with a prohibitory sign after some time. \nI tried to use First Aid on Macintosh HD from Recovery Mode. It failed miserably and the details contained a bunch of \"Missing thread record\" followed by some numbers. The final message after the failed process was the following \"First Aid process has failed. If possible backup the data on this volume. Click Done to continue\".\nI tried to access the Internet Recovery Mode following the advice of the Apple support. It failed giving the error -2002F. \nMy third attempt was to use the Single User Mode in order to apply the fsck command. However I could not even start to write in the terminal since it was going crazy in a loop by giving the message that the Root could not be found (the number of the error if relevant was probably 19). After some time, everything stopped and the background got white, while the letters got black.\nAs I understand, now my only option is to backup through Recovery Mode following the options mentioned in the above cited question and, then, erase my Hard Drive through Disk Utility. If I have any other available options, please, let me know. \nThe problem is that I don't have an external hard drive and also I don't have another MacBook. I will try soon to borrow an external hard drive from a friend. \nNow, I shall ask my questions.\n1) Suppose that I can have access to another MacBook. By using First Aid through another MacBook in my Hard Drive in the Target Disk Mode, would I obtain a better result? In other words, does the First Aid of Disk Utility acts differently when applied through another MacBook than when applied through my Recovery partition (assuming that my Recovery partition is fully functional)?\n2) Suppose that I transfer my files to an external HD through any of the methods in the above cited question and, when trying to access the transferred files, discover that they are actually corrupted. Would they also be corrupted if I have instead performed the transference by using another MacBook and the Target Disk Mode?\n3) More generally, what would be the better method of recovering my files that would optimize the amount of fully functioning files recovered?\n4) In general, when such failures in installation occurs, what folders and files are likely to have been overwritten or erased? More precisely, what folders are modified by updating from Sierra to High Sierra when the installation completion is successfully achieved?\nI ask these question because I may be able to get my hands in an empty MacBook if I pay someone, therefore I would like to know beforehand if such action would indeed be optimal. \nThanks in advance.\n\nA: There's a fair bit to your question, but...\nOn one hand you tell us that you don't have an external hard drive or another Mac, but then you say you may be able to get your hands on an empty MacBook if you pay someone.\nSo, if you were going to be spending money, it'd be best spent on an external hard drive. Not only could you use it to get yourself out of this jam, but then you'd be able to use it as a Time Machine backup drive or even a temporary boot volume for your Mac.\nNow to address your four questions:\n\n1) Suppose that I can have access to another MacBook. By using First\n  Aid through another MacBook in my Hard Drive in the Target Disk Mode,\n  would I obtain a better result?\n\nNo. You should have an external hard drive anyway, so while this is certainly one way to go to transfer your data, it still leaves you with no backup regime once you're back up and running. And, if you're thinking of doing this as a way to try and fix your existing drive, you may in fact hasten its untimely end. Basically, your priority should be to backup your data to another drive. Proceed on the assumption that your current drive will die very soon.\n\n2) Suppose that I transfer my files to an external HD through any of\n  the methods in the above cited question and, when trying to access the\n  transferred files, discover that they are actually corrupted. Would\n  they also be corrupted if I have instead performed the transference by\n  using another MacBook and the Target Disk Mode?\n\nThe method you use to transfer your data will not change the data itself. In other words, if your data is corrupted, then it's corrupted.\n\n3) More generally, what would be the better method of recovering my\n  files that would optimize the amount of fully functioning files\n  recovered?\n\nBased on the info in your question, we can only assume your hard drive has started to fail. The first thing to do is not to overuse it at this point - as we have no idea how much life is left in it. In other words, you may only get one shot at this, if you're lucky. If you're really lucky, you will be able to recover all your data. Your hard drive may last one more minute, or it may last another week. We just don't know.\nSo, to maximise the amount of data you save, the absolute best option would be to buy an external hard drive and then to selectively backup your data in order of importance. The reason this maximises things is that you're selectively recovering what you want, whereas making a full backup will also backup an awful lot of stuff that isn't important. This is okay (in fact preferred) if you know the drive will last long enough to do this, but if you don't know how long the drive will last, then selectively backing up your data is a much better approach.\nIf you're not familiar with or comfortable using Terminal to selectively transfer your data, then getting access to another Mac is the best way to achieve this. Ideally you would have the other Mac and an external hard drive. That is, put your old Mac in Target Disk Mode and then connect it to another Mac to browse your data and copy it across to the external hard drive. But if you can't get both, then temporarily transferring your data to the other Mac is your best bet until you can also get an external hard drive to put your data on.\nHowever, keep in mind that assuming your internal hard drive is dying, you will need to replace that as well, although with an external hard drive you could first install macOS on that and then transfer your data to it as well. This way you could use your old Mac for a while by booting up from the external drive. \n\n4) In general, when such failures in installation occurs, what folders\n  and files are likely to have been overwritten or erased?\n\nThis is impossible to answer as there is no way to know at what point of the installation process it failed. However, it's unlikely your user data would have been overwritten. Basically, unless you had formatted the hard drive, a macOS upgrade is only going to change system files, default apps, etc. It is not going to change your documents, media, downloads, etc.\nA final word / recommendation\nHaving gone over both of your related questions I get the sense you need to perhaps make a choice between spending some money on getting access to another Mac or on buying an external drive.\nIf I was in your situation I would do as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Purchase an external hard drive of higher capacity than your internal drive\n\n*Connect the external drive to your Mac\n\n*Boot up your Mac in macOS Recovery mode\n\n*Access Disk Utility and then format/erase your external hard drive\n\n*Proceed to install macOS onto your external drive\n\n*Once completed, your Mac should be booted into the new installation from your external drive. If not, restart your Mac and press the option key until you see your drives on the screen Then select the external drive and boot from that.\n\n*Once you're logged into your Mac, go to Apple > System Preferences > Startup Disk and make sure that the external drive is selected as the default Startup Disk\n\n*Exit System Preferences\n\n*You'll also notice in Finder that you can see the internal drive as if it's an external drive\n\n*Now you can do one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*use Migration Assistant to migrate your data from the old drive\n\n*manually copy your data\nNOTE: Once your data is copied across, you can use your Mac by continuing to boot from the external drive. However, this is not really a long-term solution as you'd be better to replace the internal drive on your Mac at some point or, when finances allow, upgrade to another Mac.\n", "Q: Use screencapture with PHP exec I can't get screencapture to work work when triggered with exec() command.\n$output = exec(\"/usr/sbin/screencapture -R 0,0,450,150 hehe.png\".\" 2>&1\");\necho $output; //  in /System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/ImageIO\n\nI am not sure what the $output message is trying to convey.\nphp.ini disable_functions is empty.\nI have a feeling that this is a osx problem.

OSX has no problem if you run your script manually, but if it is triggered as a response to a GET or POST request, than it raises the red flag.\nTo solve this 3 steps are needed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add permission to the user that is running httpd (and php) to execute sudo launchctl without password. In my case it is daemon. I got it from Activity Monitor. Edit /etc/sudoers with\ndaemon ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/launchctl\n\n\n*get the PID of loginWindow. you can use ActivityMonitor for that.

The only thing that fixed the issue for me was this link. https://www.davidschlachter.com/misc/kernel_task\nIf for whatever reason the link doesnt work, this is from the page.\nThrottling is implemented as a kernel extension, which Rhys Oxenham suggests disabling by removing the plist in its Resources corresponding to the Mac's model. However, the list of Macs identified by plist files has not been updated for some years. Our 2013 MacBook Air (MacbookAir6,2) is absent. The X86PlatformPlugin.kext (also in the plugins folder of the IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext) has other Macs identified by their motherboard (see comments on this post). In my case, I tried disabling both the ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin.kext and X86PlatformPlugin.kext extensions, but this had no effect.\nWhat did end up working for me was to disable the parent kernel extension IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext. So far I've not noted any adverse effects. Obviously I don’t take any responsibility for damages if you try this and have problems.\nHere's what I did:\nFirst, I had to disable SIP (since we're running OS X El Capitan) by booting into recovery mode (booting while holding command-R), opening the Terminal (under the Utilities menu), and running the command csrutil disable (more details on StackExchange).\nFrom there, I booted into single user mode by holding Command-S when booting. After mounting the file system (fsck -y; mount -uw /), I made a backup copy of the IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext extension using rsync:\nrsync -av /System/Library/Extensions/IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext /Users/Shared/\n(To restore the extension from the backup, I would use rsync -av /Users/Shared/IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext /System/Library/Extensions/)\nI then deleted the extension and rebooted:\nrm -rf /System/Library/Extensions/IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext; shutdown -r now\nAfter booting, the fan still runs at full speed, but the throttling is gone\n\nA: I found this: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207359\nSo the kernel_task daemon “takes” cpu cycles to prevent other tasks to generate heat.

I used an app that said it has 900+ charge cycles.  I find I have to charge it constantly because it doesn't hold its charge very well.\nI know a Macbook and iPhone are not comparable but this link says after 1000 charge cycles for the Macbook, it's time to replace the battery so I'm wondering if there's a similar rule of thumb for an iPhone too (specifically iPhone 5s)\n\nA: Your answer can be found here: Battery Service and Recycling.\n\niPhone Owners\nYour battery is designed to retain up to 80% of its original capacity at 500 complete charge cycles.\nThe one-year warranty includes service coverage for a defective battery. If it is out of warranty, Apple offers a battery service for $79, plus $6.95 shipping, subject to local tax.\n\nMy personal experience is that replacing the battery at about 700-800 cycles is a must. But obviously it depends on how the phone is used.\nAnd yea, I'd say the cycle count is kinda irrelevant. Cycle count gives you a good idea of what state it is in... But when you are the one who uses the device, you should know when you've had enough.\nI've always used those 3rd party phone repair shops, where the battery replacements tend to be relatively cheap.\n\nA: Not to sound flippant but it really is, when you want to. If the phone is not holding a sufficient charge for your use then it is time to get it replaced.\nIt might be cheaper to get one of those cases that have a battery in them that would give you more usage time, but again that is a personal preference.\n\nA: As Joonas suggests, the cycle count is not totally relevant. What's more important to look at is the design capacity of the battery. To do this, use a battery utility, such as [http://www.coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery/|coconutBattery] (for Mac) or [http://www.3u.com/|3uTools] (for Windows). It will tell you what the health of the battery is.

I just purchased a iPhone 8 and I was trying to charge it using my Qi charging base that I used on my former Nexus 6. The base worked fine on the Nexus 6 but on the iPhone, it squeals (not sure whether it is the iPhone or the base, but it sounds more like the base) and stops charging regularly. The charge level does go up during this process, but it is so irritating that I have to stop as I also fear damage to the iPhone. I used both the Nexus 6 and the iPhone USB power adapter and the result is the same. For me it seems that the iPhone pulls more power than the Qi base can support. It there a way to reduce the power drawn by the iPhone via wireless charging?\nThe Qi charger is a Itian model A2.\nEDIT:\nI found a solution to stop this Qi charger from squealing. I added a small padding on the bottom where the iPhone sits (around 1 cm or half inch) and the iPhone now is aligned well against the coil, which has stopped the squealing and charges at the expected rate.\n\nA: It could possibly be that the Qi base isn't actually a certified Qi product. As far as I can tell, the only certified Qi charger from Itian is the K10. In addition, lack of Qi certification can mean incompatibility with some Qi devices, and at worst, potential damage to the device.\n", "Q: EE blocked my stolen phone's sim, will this prevent Lost mode from taking effect? I had my iphone 6s plus stolen in a nightclub at the weekend, I activated lost mode straight away but the phone was offline. I then phoned EE to report the theft and they blocked the sim, but I've since realised that the phone has to connect to the internet in order for Lost mode to take effect and lock my phone and enable tracking to occur, so have I played into the thief's hands by having the sim blocked?\n\nA: If you phone was stolen (and you didn't just lose it) you did the right thing having the sim blocked because it would also work in any other phone - once in possession they would be able to remove the sim, insert it into any other device and you would then be liable for any costs which occur.\nAssuming that your phone was protected with a passcode, anyone trying to switch on the phone would not be able to access its content or reset the phone to keep for themselves or sell on. \nHowever, due to the difficulty thief's have trying to re-enable locked phones, its most likely that your phone will have already been taken apart and sold for its parts. \nIf however you had just misplaced the phone and it was in fact not stolen, then with the phone being offline already, there would again be very little else you could have done anyway. You can still put it in lost mode, lock it, or remotely erase it. The next time your device is online, these actions will take effect.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro early 2011 hangs at “white screen” I tried the following, but at each one except the single user mode, it is stuck on the white screen. This problem occurred after I shut down the MacBook Pro using power button after the screen froze \nI tried booting from external USB, CMD+R, CMD+OPTION+R, OPTION, \nWhile it is stuck at white screen it overheats, and sometimes restarts\nI cannot reinstall MacOS or enter recovery or internet recovery or even erase the hard disk because it always ets stuck at the white screen.\nIs there any way to fix it using terminal at single user mode?\n\nA: Unfortunately it is almost certainly the discrete GPU on the main logic board that is failing here, not some kind of OS issue. This symptom is the most common way this issue presents in the 2011 models, especially considering the fact that your machine isn't able to boot to recovery, but does not display any boot error messages (like the ? folder or prohibitory symbol). \nThe 2011 MacBook Pros had a repair extension program from Apple for this issue free of charge for a couple years. Unfortunately, it ended a while ago. \nYou can salvage the data in target disk mode https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201462 if you have another mac to connect yours to. You could also just remove the hard drive and connect it to another computer with an enclosure to recover data if that's what you need from it.\nI know that there are definitely repair shops that do component level repairs on the failing GPU, but it would not be free. That said, Apple no longer fixes the 2011 models at all, even if you were to pay, so an independent repair shop would be your best bet anyway if you really wanted to get this computer fixed. \n", "Q: Can I maximize windows on a second monitor? I recently added a second monitor. I want to be able to keep a window maximized on this screen. Clicking the maximize button when in this monitor causes the alert sound to play and the window does not maximize. \nHow can I maximize a window on the secondary display?\n\nA: For some reason I am now able to maximize windows on my second display.\nThe only change I made was to try it with Finder per @drivec's comment about stock apps vs. other apps. \nThe direct answer to my question is: Yes you can maximize windows on a second display. \nI have no idea why it did not work earlier.\n", "Q: Simple solution to create a zip for Windows users without __MACOSX or any other \"period\" hidden folders I've seen questions: \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I create a zip archive for Windows and Linux users?\n\n*How to remove __MACOSX folder in a list of zip files (not a single zip file)?\n\n*How can I batch zip multiple folders without _macosx files?\nThis question is different.\nI'm asking for a way to create a zip without the .DS_Store or  __MACOSX for less sophisticated Apple computer users who have to coexist with Windows users who cannot accept a zip with the .DS_Store and __MACOSX. \nI've discovered these are called Mac resource forks.\nLike I said, for less sophisticated Apple users, so no command line codes please.\n\nA: Without having to use terminal,\nyou could try Folderwasher, which is an app that creats a zip without the .DS_store file. You can drop the folder onto the application and it compresses it.\nAlternatively, you could try Keka, which also has an option to exclude the .DS_store file.

I shared an iCloud note with somebody else to work on it together. I sent a link via E-Mail which points to iCloud.com. The other person opens the link, signs into iCloud and then the note is opened in the web app.\nWhile the Apple online help is not very clear about the abilities I expected the note to at least synchronize with the other persons Notes app on macOS (the other person is signed on to iCloud on macOS and notes synchronization is turned on). But not even that. Am I missing something or is it really only possible for the sharing person to edit in the macOS app?\nI tried the same with a Numbers spreadsheet which is saved in iCloud, too. Sending the link via iMessage results in the same problem.\n\nA: Solution: Upgrade to a macOS version which introduced the support to do so. According to the About collaboration for Pages, Numbers, and Keynote article on the Apple Support pages \"A Mac with macOS Sierra and Pages 6.3.1, Numbers 4.3.1, or Keynote 7.3.1 or later\" is required.\nIn my case the macOS upgrade from El Capitan to High Sierra provided the desired feature. I simply did not think about the only recently introduced software support.\n", "Q: Use target mode to pull data from a hard disk encrypted with FileVault? I got this message on a MacBook Pro 2012: \n\npath /system/installation/packages/osinstall.mpkg appears to be missing or damaged\n\nThe first thing to do is to safe data. The hard disk is encrypted with FileVault.\nIs it possible to plug it to another MacBook Pro (running High Sierra or El Capitan) and pull the data?\n\nA: Yes, \nBoot the Mac you want the data from into target disk mode, https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201462. Connect the two Macs and wait. You should be prompted for the file vault password. After you enter the correct file vault password wait some more. After a few minutes the other mac's drive should mount on the desktop. Now copy over any files you want to keep.\n\nA: The accepted answer is correct, however here are the steps without having to leave this forum.\nConnect the two computers with a FireWire or Thunderbolt cable.\nOn the Mac you want to use as the disk in target disk mode, do one of the following:\nIf the computer is off, start it up while pressing and holding the T key.\nIf the computer is on, choose Apple menu  > System Preferences, click Startup Disk, then click Target Disk Mode.\nWhen the computer has started up, a disk icon appears on the desktop of the other computer.\nTransfer files by dragging them to and from the disk.\nEject the disk by dragging its icon to the Trash.\nWhile you drag, the Trash icon changes to an Eject icon.\nOn the Mac you used as a disk, push the power button to shut it down, then disconnect the cable.\n", "Q: Windows FAT32 file system is unreadable I know there is no difference between MS-DOS FAT32 and Windows FAT32 file system and there are only FAT16 and FAT32 but Disk Utility identifies FAT differently and in my case USB drive with Windows FAT32 is unreadable. The latter was created in Ubuntu when I wanted to make GParted live USB using: \nsudo dd if=/path-to-gparted-live.x.y.z-w.iso of=/dev/sde bs=4M; sync\n\nbefore that USB drive was formatted in disk utility to MS-DOS FAT32.\n\nand here is the picture of it after creating live USB in Ubuntu:\n\nWhy macOS doesn't read Windows FAT32? \n\nA: You are copying a file to a block device. Let us consider the two.\nA file is usually stored in a file system. The file is broken up to equal size blocks and generally stored non contiguously. The file system contains a table that links the blocks together.\nBlock devices also contain equal sized blocks. When the block device is an actually a physical device, such as a USB flash drive, these blocks are stored contiguously. Since the blocks are contiguous, there is no need for a table containing links.\nNow, there are virtual block devices that are not physical devices, but rather are actually files themselves. Stored somewhere in these files is all the information needed to represent a physical block device. Also, these files may contain additional information needed to describe the physical device. An iso file is this type of file.\nBlock devices generally contain a table which define contiguous blocks called partitions. Not all block devices have such tables. File systems are usually stored in these partitions. Again, not all files systems require a partition container and partitions do not contain file systems exclusively.  \nInitially, the 16GB USB flash drive contained a partition table. This table had an entry that allowed for a FAT formatted file system to reside contiguously on most (if not all) of the remaining blocks. \nThe command you entered completely overwrote this partition table and partially overwrote the file system. In other words, the iso file was copied sequentially to the flash drive starting a the first block of the drive.\nThe end result? Well, the disk utility (actually macOS) thinks there is at least one partition on the USB drive and that this partition should contain a Windows_FAT_32 file system. Of course, this is wrong, but this what was interpreted from results of your dd command.\n", "Q: External monitor not working when in closed clamshell mode I have a mid-2015, 15 inch MacBook Pro, connected to a Dell P2715Q with a Display Port to mini-DP cable. With the lid open, I get both displays working.\nI used to be able to close the lid and it would switch to just using the external monitor, but I have changed something in the settings so that when it is closed, the display is black.\nI am using SwitchResX, to change the resolution, and I think I changed the colour from Millions to Billions, which broke it.  I now can't change it back as it is only broken when the lid is closed.  I want to have just the single monitor.  How can I change the settings back to normal so that it works properly?\nThe MacBook Pro is plugged in to mains power, and is connected a USB Keyboard and Bluetooth Mouse.\nI use the exact same setup at work, with identical Keyboard and Mouse, but a different monitor, and that works fine.  It appears that the configuration for the monitor in open clamshell mode is different to that in closed clamshell mode, and I'm trying to find out how to re-configure the closed clamshell mode when it does not display anything with it closed.\n\nA: To reset the external monitor settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*remove the Folder ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/\n\n*remove the SwitchResX Preferences\n\n\n*\n\n*fr.madrau.switchres.* \n\n*fr.madrau.switchresx.*\n\n\n*reset the NVRAM but holding down Cmd-Alt-P-R on startup.\n\n\nAfter that, I was able to use the external monitor on its own.\nI didn't actually remove the folders.  I moved them to a different, temporary location, but they are not in the same location.\n\nA: I had the same problem:\nChanged refresh rate to 144 Hz while in clamshell mode --> Blackscreen.\nBut everything worked fine when I opened the Laptop. The problem is that the settings can only be changed back if in clamshell mode because they are stored separately. But how to change them back if the screen is black?\nSolution: Team Viewer.\nConnect your laptop to the monitor. Get an iPad or second PC and connect via team Viewer. Close Laptop. Now you should be able to see the settings for clamshell mode. Just change them back and everything works fine again.\n\nA: Check your display and energy saver settings. \nAnd then just make sure that you are following each step in this article so that we can properly troubleshoot the issue. \nhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201834\n\nA: i had the same problem but i wasn't using any resoliution programs like SwitchResX.\nRemoving the \"ByHost\" folder and than resetting NVRAM worked for me too.\ni am using an 16\" macbook pro 6C base model with AOC 24v2q monitor.\nthanks for the solution.\n\nA: I used teamviewer and run it on the macbook and remote control from external ipad or something and it worked.

I am planning to invest in an external 144 Hz display for smooth game developments, now as far as I know macOS outputs video at 60 Hz so if I buy an 144 Hz external display will my MacBook be able to output video/operate at 144 Hz screen refresh rate?\n\nA: Yes, it should work out of the box given the right cable and a new enough MacBook (some MacBooks will need a 3rd party patch.) If you're still having issues (which you shouldn't), you can try using SwitchResX to force the monitor to work at the correct settings.\nHowever, you indicated that screen tearing was the issue you wanted to solve. Faster refresh rates won't solve screen tearing, only Vsync (which hurts performance), FreeSync (which requires an AMD card, specialized monitor, and Linux/Windows) or Gsync (which requires an Nvidia card, and more expensive specialized monitors.)\n\nA: In my case i only get 120hz, i'm using a Macbook pro 2017, a Samsung Odyssey monitor with hdmi 2.0, but MacOSX only shows 120hz in screen options.\n\n", "Q: Some purchases NOT showing up on my Apple TV (4K) Numerous shows that I have purchased are NOT showing up on my Apple TV.

How come they can be recovered? I am trying to delete some photos from my daughter's Photos Library/Hard Drive. What I have done so far is that I have moved the photos to the trash and emptied it. \nNow the problem is, deleted files/photos can be recovered using any Recovery Software out there in the market. (According to my husband)\nI am confused. If someone deletes/erases a whole internal drive - how come the deleted files are recoverable?\nMy daughter’s computer is a 2014 iMac running El Capitan and it has a 500GB SATA hard drive.\n\nA: The files on the hard drive are all around and the system keeps pointers that point to the files. When you delete the file, you really only delete the pointer and the data is still there, but you can't find it with normal tools. The operating system will eventually overwrite that data with new data.\nThis is where data recovery comes into place, there are tools that allow scanning of the drive and recovering the files (restoring the pointers). \nOne way of avoiding that is to overwrite the place where the actual data resides multiple times. Again there are tools for that. \nBefore El Capitan you could securely empty the trash right in the menu, but that option is gone because it did not work as it should. In newer versions this could be done from terminal like this: diskutil secureErase freespace LEVEL /Volumes/DRIVENAME. Source: Does FileVault 2 also encrypt my free disk space?\nYou can delete files that way with this command srm -v /path/to/file/to/securely/delete/example.png. Still, good tools could recover files deleted like this.\nUnfortunately the only real solution is secure wiping the full drive and overwrite it with random 0 and 1. One time is enough. This process deletes everything on the drive and takes a lot of time to complete.\n\nA: Emptying the trash doesn't erase the space the files occupied on the disc: it just marks that space as available to be used again.  If the space hasn't been reused, the data is still there and can be found by software that looks through the available space of the drive looking for, e.g., fragments of photos.\nErasing the space would take time so, since most data isn't sensitive, it's usually better to just leave it there rather than really erasing it.  It also allows people to recover from oopses.\n\nA: Monomeeth's answer already explains how deleting and recovery work.\nI'm going to attempt to explain why they work that way.\nComputers today are fast, but that wasn't always the case. Conceptually speaking, the latest greatest OS X (software that all apple computers have that makes them work) has a lot in common with earlish Unixes from the 1980's (think software for old refrigerator-sized machines that only universities or huge companies had).\nOverwriting data on a hard disk is expensive (takes lots of computer resources). The difference between deleting the pointer (think library catalog entry) to where the data is and the data itself (think collection of encyclopedias) is (depending on the size of the data) the difference between running to the house next door (seconds) and running around the entire planet Earth (years)... or to the moon and back (centuries)... or to the next star system (you get the idea). It's hard to explain to a non-technical person just how big the difference is.\nEven though computers run much faster than people, and modern computers run much faster than early computers, the difference is still significant.\nThat also plays in to the social factors: people want their computers to be fast. They also want to be able to recover files if they accidentally delete them. There's also the inertia of the fact that filesystems have almost always worked that way, and it would take a lot of programmers a lot of time (read: very very expensive) to change it.\nAll of that adds up to your current mac \n(and every other computer) working more-or-less the way Monomeeth's answer describes.\nFor more info see this question and my answer to it. \n\nA: This answer belongs in Parenting SE, but since the question is here, I'll put the answer here too.  It does not address OP's actual hardware question.\nFollowing up a comment.  The technical answers cover it.  You can erase the images, and there are apps that will write gibberish over the files before erasing them making recovery unlikely without really high tech skills.\nHowever any kid with the brains God gave to turnips will learn from the first experience, and hide things from you.\nThis is one you don't win by setting rules.  You win this one by convincing her that she doesn't want this sort of thing on her computer.  Discuss the content that troubles you.  Far better for her to be open, and to talk about this, then for her to be secretive about it.  Overall this process starts years earlier.  Gaining trust at this point is tough.\n14 is a difficult age.  We all made dumb choices at that age.  I always felt I could talk about anything with my parents.  They pointed out possible downsides to things, but told me that I was allowed to make my own mistakes.  I made a few.  But not as many as most of my classmates.\nOr you take the computer away from her.\nWays your child can circumvent your attempt to control the contents of his/her devices:\n\n*\n\n*Passcode the device.\n\n*Encrypt the hard drive.\n\n*Partition the hard drive and make the extra partition encrypted.\n\n*Partition the hard drive and normally leave it non-mounted.\n\n*Create a hidden folder.\n\n*Create multiple photo libraries.\n\n*Keep stuff on a thumb drive. On the thumb drive you can do any combination of 1-6.\n\n*Create a new user account and require login.  Do not show login items on opening screen.  Use one account for school, and the other for clandestine stuff.\n\n*Store stuff in the cloud.\n\n*Store stuff in a archive that spotlight (or equivalent) doesn't search.\n\n*Create a new email account on a public server.  Mail stuff as attachments to that account.\n\n\nA: Short answer\nBy moving a file to Trash and then emptying the trash, or by doing a quick format of a traditional hard drive (i.e. not a solid state drive), you're actually not deleting files. Instead, all you are doing is deleting the information about those files. This means the operating system has absolutely no idea those files exist, let alone where on the drive they exist.\nLong answer\nOkay, let me explain this by using an analogy.\nImagine you’re at a library and this particular library contains 100,000 books. All these books are indexed in the library’s catalog. This catalogue is accessible via a computer that allows you to search by title, author, date, etc. Most importantly, each index tells you exactly where that book is located. This makes it easy to find what you’re looking for when you need to. You simply conduct a search of the catalog and it’ll tell you exactly where that book is (i.e. what section, row, and shelf it’s sitting in).\nOne day, someone accidentally deletes the record of a particular book from the library’s catalogue. The book itself is still there, sitting in exactly the same spot. But no-one knows it’s there and/or where it is!\nThe next day, someone breaks in and steals the computer containing the library’s catalogue. All of the books are still there, but if you walked in and wanted to find a particular book about Steve Jobs, you’d have no idea if that book is in the library and, if so, where to find it!\nNow imagine that your hard drive is that library. It contains 100,000 files (documents, photos, videos, music, etc). \n\n\n*\n\n*When you move a file to the Trash and then empty it, it’s akin to someone accidentally deleting the record of a particular book from the library’s catalog.\n\n*When you erase a hard drive, that’s akin to someone stealing the library’s entire catalog.\nSo, using our analogy, the books are still on the shelves. They haven’t gone anywhere! But if you wanted to find that one book you’re looking for, well, you’d have absolutely no idea where to look. \nLikewise when deleting files or erasing a hard drive. Your computer has no idea whatsoever what data is on that hard, or where it is. So, as a user, if you navigate around the hard drive you won’t see those files because your Mac isn’t aware of them and therefore isn’t displaying them. They effectively don’t exist. \nBut, if you were to use data recovery software, then that’s akin to a library hiring someone to go in and walk up and down every row of bookshelves and opening each and every book and taking notes of their titles, authors, location, etc. The data recovery software has no idea what’s on your hard drive initially, but it will interrogate every block of space to actually see what’s there and can then recover it. In other words, it’s making what’s already there visible again.\nWhen you empty the trash or erase a hard drive and then start saving new files to your computer, over time macOS will just overwrite the previous data because it just doesn’t know there’s any data there. It just sees it as free space and therefore available to write new data over. That’s why recovering data is always more successful soon after you’ve deleted something, because there’s less chance it’s already been overwritten.\nIf you want to be fairly certain those intimate photos aren’t recoverable, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Secure erase the hard drive (since you’re on El Capitan, read this question and its answers How to get the \"securely erase\" function of Disk Utility on El Capitan & Sierra)\n\n*Manually fill the empty space of the hard drive with other data, preferably large files (e.g. a whole heap videos) and then when it’s full, delete this files. In this way, the blocks containing the previous photos should be overwritten with other data.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: If your daughter has Time Machine backups, then all those intimate photos will almost certainly be in those backups as well.\nA final word...\nAnother option users can take is to encrypt their Mac startup drive. This will secure your data because everything on the disk is encrypted. If you delete files, these will be unrecoverable or, more to the point, they can be recovered, but they're encrypted and therefore inaccessible to anyone who doesn't have the right credentials (e.g. login password, recovery key).\nFor more info on how to use FileVault refer to: Use FileVault to encrypt the startup disk on your Mac.\n\nA: Your storage device is like a big book with a directory. Information is stored on some of its pages and the directory will have a corresponding pointer that leads towards those pages. When you delete something, the pages are left intact, but the directory that leads to it will be marked as empty. When you flip through those pages yourself you'll see the data you've \"deleted\".\n\nA: The basic idea of a hard drive is that you the hard drive is made up of a bunch of pieces that can be put in two different states. It a sense, your hard drive contains billions of switches that can be flipped to one side or the other. When you open a file, your computer looks at the appropriate switches of your hard drive, sees what state they're in, and processes that information to create what you see on the screen. The computer keeps track of what files are saved in what pieces, and every time you save a new file, it looks for a set of switches that aren't used yet. If there aren't any free switches, then it tells you that you can't save the file. \nWhen you move a file to the trash, that tell the computer that you don't need the file anymore. So the computer then goes to its record of what files are stored where, and deletes the record that stores that file's location. Now that file's location is no longer listed as being \"used\", and if the computer needs to save a file somewhere, it can use that space.\nSo when you move a file to the trash, the switches that represent that file aren't changed. All that changes is that their location is not marked as \"used\". Now, you may be wondering \"Why aren't those switches changed?\" And the corresponding question is \"Why would they be?\" One configuration of switches is just as good as another. The computer could go through and \"reset\" all the switches, but there's no benefit from a computational point of view. Storing a file after switches have been \"reset\" is no faster than saving a file with switches in a random configuration. Any time you spend resetting the switches is just wasted. From a computational point of view, there's no such thing as \"deleting\" a file, there's just writing another file where the first file used to be. If you want to make a file unrecoverable, you have to write something else to the part of the hard drive where it's stored.\n", "Q: Exit Man opened from the touch bar So in terminal there is a fun feature now, as you can open a man page of the current command by using the touchbar. I failed to close the man page though. The usual q did nothing as well as esc or CTRL-C.

If you then press q it doesn't close the manual but it will switch it back to END. Press q again and it should exit you out.

After installing High Sierra, whenever I lock and close my MacBook Pro (2015), all my programs have quit once I open it again. Chrome will often show an \"unexpectedly closed\" message, which seems to indicate that it was not a graceful logout but a sudden forced quit of all programs.\nIt doesn't happen if I lock the computer and immediately unlock - only, apparently, if I close the laptop and come back after a while (sometimes as little as 5-10 minutes).\nWhy would this be happening?\nHigh Sierra also freezes for around 5 seconds when I try to Lock the computer before actually locking, which is extremely slow and did not happen in Sierra.\nI tried to ask this on Apple forums and got the message: \"You are not allowed to create or update this content.\"\nAdditional info:\n- I'm running latest version of macOS (10.13.1).\n- When I unlock the Mac after this kind of mass-crash I often get the Optimizing Your Mac notification\n- It just happened to me again after closing the laptop for about 2 minutes\n- Twice today, instead of a mass crash, the Mac has just displayed a black screen (though the keyboard lights are on) and I was forced to restart.

I replaced the old one with a new one.\nFirst I tried to reinstall macOS with my Time Machine backup, but it failed. Then I tried to install a fresh copy from Internet Recovery Mode, that failed too. My last resort was to make a bootable USB on another Mac and install it that way. At first it seemed to work, but when it boots the drive does not show up as bootable.\nI tried running Apple Hardware Check, but could not access it. It just showed a folder with a question mark.\nIs there anything left to do?\n\nA: Alright, I found out what the problem was. I was talking to a local IT-guy, he said, that SSDs from than manufactor, ADATA, wouldn't work with macOS.\nSo the only solution was to buy another one.\n\nA: I would use that other Mac to make an OS installer. There are utilities that will take an installer and write it to a USB drive (8GB or greater) so that it can boot from that drive and install macOS. There is also a terminal command that will do the same thing. A little Google-fu will point you to those procedures.\nNote that installing macOS on a drive and then putting that drive in another Mac does not always result in a drive that is bootable on both. Installers, however will boot any Mac that is capable of running that version of macOS. That is the path I would take\n", "Q: Macbook Power Adapter Prongs Burnt I was travelling in China with my Macbook and USB-C Power Adapter. While plugged in at a hotel, the prongs of adapter got burnt.\nIs it okay to just replace the prongs, or is it likely that the adapter's circuits have been damaged?\nThere is no other visible damage to any other part of the charger.\nShould I just replace the whole adapter to be safe?\n\n\nA: Taking a close look at the adapter, you will notice there is evidence of melted metal on the second prong most likely caused by arcing.\n\nWhat this tells me is that there was a short from the hot to neutral which (should have) tripped the breaker.  What caused it?  Any number of things from faulty wiring to a surge with enough voltage to cause the electricity to \"jump\" from one conductor to the next.\nIs your adapter safe to use?\nYes, provided it works.  Adapters are designed to isolate the high(er) voltage mains AC from the lower, cleaner, usable DC voltage.  If anything was damaged due to a surge, the adapter simply won't work (most likely the internal fuse would be blown).\nBottom line... you can plug it in and it won't hurt your Mac.  You can even used the charred AC plug connector and it will still work.  Unless the prong is broken, or so physically deformed that it's causing a short, there's nothing to worry about.\n\nA: If there is no damage to the body of the brick and it appears to be functioning normally, I would personally be okay just replacing the prong portion.\nThat said, Apple may be interested in trading out the entire power supply free of charge. They care a ton about product safety. They may be interested in dissecting it to determine if it was a manufacturing defect. You can find Apple support contact information here.\n\nA: TLDR: Wrecked by series arcing, from inserting in loose socket. The pins are scrap now.  Don't use AC sockets that are loose.\nThis is due to series arcing: power was flowing through the adapter normally, but making poor contact.  AC mains voltage electricity was able to leap across the very small gap between pin and socket.  This arcing acted exactly like arc welding (was arc welding) and gouged and pitted the metal, and made smoke/soot (probably from the poor grade of plastic of the Chinese socket).  This worsened the contact and worsened the arcing.  Arcing like this makes an impressive amount of heat - which dips the voltage to the appliance, which on a switching power supply increases current further, lather rinse repeat.\nThe part with the pins is scrap, since the arc damage will cause its contact with other plugs to be unreliable, which in turn could cause even more arcing.  It won't hurt your Mac, but it might start a fire which would definitely damage your Mac. I would not attempt to dress the pins with a file, as they are plated, and you are exposing the underlying brass, which would then oxidize, worsening contact further.  The rest of the charger is fine, you can get \"just the little clip-on plug device\" by buying any genuine Apple iPad charger, which use the same clip-on.  I get mine on eBay for $12.\nOr, look at the socket on the power block - that is IEC C8.  It can mate with any common \"IEC C7\" appliance cord. When I had a Macbook PS that had a cord instead of a pin-frob, I left the cord behind and just grabbed a local C7 cord.\nThe lesson to learn here is don't use AC power sockets that are loose.  If the contacts don't grip the plug securely, it is defective and don't use it.\n\nThis sort of thing is why UL and the other national testing labs (CSA, TUV, BSI etc.) have very high standards for manufacture of sockets and plugs. Both in terms of contact design and quality, and also the plastics used must resist and not accelerate fire, and not emit toxic smoke if charred by external fire. Such standards do not always exist in the third world, or are not enforced.\nThe pin location of this arcing is highly unusual.  That is not the normal contact point for a UL-listed or CSA-listed NEMA 5-15 socket, which is on the 2 faces of each pin.  I suspect you were dealing with one of the infamous Chinese \"everything sockets\", which make contact with every kind of plug, but very poor contact with any of them.  This could not handle 0.5 amps - certainly 16A is out of the question.  As such, UL and the major NRTLs will never approve \"everything sockets\". They cannot be made safely.\n\"Dual sockets\" such as British shaver sockets are possible.\n", "Q: Is it okay to use non-OEM USB-C cable and/or adapter for Macbook Pro? Is there anything special about the Apple USB-C cable, other than its quality, that would prevent me from using a USB-C cable from another brand?\nAnd the same question for the wall adapter.\n\nA: A USB-C cable is a USB-C cable.  There's nothing special about it with the exception of quality (which you already mentioned.)\nAs far as adapters go, there are \"genuine\" adapters which are actually OEM'ed by a 3rd party company with Apple's blessing and then there are the myriad of knock-offs you can find on Amazon and eBay.\nIf you are using the USB-C charger/port to charge your device, technically speaking, any cable/adapter will do.  That said, when you purchase said cable/adapter, look for quality products, not the cheapest you can find.\nWhat to look for...\n\n\n*\n\n*A USB-IF compliance. This means it was tested to meet a certain set of standards.\n\n*USB certified Charger Logo.  This means that the charger is USB-IF compliant.\n\nDoes this mean that the no-name or off-brand products are bad?  No.  It means that the manufacturer has taken the time and cost to certify their products to a certain level of quality and performance.  (IMO) Saving a few dollars on a cable/charger is simply not worth it when attaching it to a $1000+ Mac that I use for daily work.\n\nA: The only thing that's 'special' about them is they are MFI-certified from Apple.  This means that Apple ensures it will work with all their devices.  Third-party accessory makers can also have their products MFI-certified by following the guidelines that Apple publishes.\nThe question of 'quality' is subjective in that what I think it means might be different than what you think it means.  I spent a lot of money on my Apple products so I will only buy MFI accessories (they could cost more money than non-certified products).\nIn this manner, any USB-C cable will work but it's up to you to decide if a higher-quality cable will give you the peace of mind that there's less a chance that the cable will fail or cause other problems for you.\n", "Q: System Administrator Profile shows up after auto-lock High Sierra I have a MacBook Pro running High Sierra.\nSometimes when I let my computer auto-lock itself, (like closing the lid for a while) when I come back the user is not the profile I was using, but says System Administrator and has the default grey silhouette icon.

I have a question. I'm developing an app for iOS. I don't have a subscription of Apple Developer Account(I'm thinking about buying that but I'm hesitating because I don't know whether my app will work or/and be published). \nAre there any reliable and legal ways for my friend to install it on his iPhone without jailbreak, AppStore or any warranty void itp.? Is Cydia Impactor safe under above conditions? Is Apple going to make trouble when they detect that an app was installed with this tool?\n\nA: A person can deploy apps to their own iOS devices using Xcode without a developer account, and without breaking/modifying the OS.  All one needs is an Apple ID, and a Mac running a recent version of Xcode (7.3.1 or later).  This is an Apple approved method of installing apps (designed for educational purposes).  Xcode will generate the needed personal provisioning profiles automatically.  \nYou can search for instructions online (here are a few examples: Xcode 7 develop for iOS without developer account and http://blog.ionicframework.com/deploying-to-a-device-without-an-apple-developer-account/ )\nApps installed using personal provisioning will be time limited (expire in somewhere around one week to one month).\n\nA: You do not need to pay for an Apple Developer Account in order to build an app. Only to publish it on the store. You can deploy test builds to your own personal device, or the simulator, for free.\nDeveloping your own app without an Apple Developer Account has been a thing for a few years now.\n", "Q: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `\"' and unexpected end of file errror I searched a lot of similar error on Bash_Profile, but no one seems to look like mine..

He wants to change the \"work iPhone 6 and iPad Air 2\" to a new Apple id not associated with his personal Apple id (icloud ??). I am trying to help, but I am not familiar with Apple iPhones etc. He uses his personal email for his Apple id for all of devices, but separate email addresses. \nHow do I change his work devices without losing contacts, pictures etc. I am not sure if all devices are uploading information into the iCloud - (how can I find out?).\nI am so frustrated with reading so many things on the internet, I am scared to try to accomplish this for him. He doesn't have a clue on any tech things, so he is of no use to me to help. \nAlso, he wants to change his personal iPhone 5s to an iPhone 6 Plus (without losing his stuff). \nI think I need some really good to help me to accomplish this without losing any contacts, photos, etc. Can someone help me? \nThanks in advance!  \n\nA: Sure I can help, but this will take time to cover all of the bases. I'll keep updating this answer as I update it. I'll even comment when I update it.\n1st thing 1st you want to make sure that all of his devices have a backup. While this may seem tedious it's a crucial step in migrating and changing accounts and devices. We want to do this 1st so that nothing is accidentally lost, locked or disappeared. You can either do an iTunes backup over the computer, although I personally recommend an iCloud backup since its 1 less device that you have to open and use, and you can do it right on the iPhone/iPad as long as it has WiFi access and is charging/has a decent amount of battery life.\nTo backup to iCloud, 1st make sure that he has iCloud on in settings (Settings -> Click his name -> Click on iCloud -> Scroll down to iCloud Backup (if he's logged in he should see it) - Click on iCloud backup and then make sure its on (green) and then Backup now (unless he has a backup and its recent with no changes made on the device's information - aka: contacts, messages, photos, etc). The other way (for older devices) is to go to Settings -> iCloud and then iCloud Backup.\nIf thats done with all of his devices then the next step is to copy all photos on these devices to a PC. It's easier that way rather than to deal with iCloud. If his iCloud photo library is on (Settings -> Click his name -> Click on iCloud -> Click on Photos -> Make sure iCloud Photo Library is on aka green) then he may not have direct physical access to his photos since the cloud has already begun uploading them. If there are photos that he can't access from his device but they are on the iCloud, there is a way to also download them from a computer. He will need to know his Apple ID email (usually in settings -> click his name -> email thats under his name) and password.\nIf you aren't familiar with extracting photos from these iPhones/iPads leave a comment and then we can discuss those matters.\niCloud Backup - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203977\n\nOnce the iCloud backups and the photo extraction is done, then you are ready to check his accounts and see if he has a Gmail, Yahoo, AOL email (basically 3rd party client that hosts their own web-based email). If he does then usually that email has his contacts saved to it. He can always check by signing into the email address on the web and then checking contacts. If all of them are there great, then we can move on to the next steps. If not then we need to make sure contacts is on in iCloud so that they are all backed up. There is a way to download your contacts list from iCloud on the web. If you need that pointer, let me know. Once those contacts are confirmed/backed up then we can move forward.\n\n", "Q: How to stop file vault decrypting and re enable encryption?

Recently I started to shoot movies and use FCPX to edit etcetera. My question is when going to About this Mac > Storage > Manage > Reduce Clutter> Review Files > Large Files… Much to my frustration I find oodles of QuickTime movie files. I’d like to delete them and regain the almost 300 GB of storage that’s being used up. But I’m worried they would no longer be stored in my Photos application (where I imported or dragged and dropped everything I’ve filmed). Why do they end up saved in that documents file and is it safe to delete them. A related question, when I delete downloads, if I’ve saved them in photos or in pages, will those be gone from those places or will they remain?\n\nA: This largely depends on how you have photos imported to the Photos app. Photos > Preferences has an Importing checkbox. If this checkbox was ever disabled when you imported photos, you may not have all photos in the library itself and may exist in other places on your computer.\n\nIf you are not using iCloud Photo Library, consider selecting the image or movie in Photos, and using File > Show Referenced File in Finder. This will allow you to see exactly where the file lives.\nYou could export all your movie files from Photos and move them to a different hard drive or cloud storage solution, or delete the movies in Photos and replace them all with the Importing checkbox selected. You should export originals via File > Export > Export Unmodified Original for x Videos.\nI also recommend making sure you have good backups via Time Machine or another service. If you make a mistake when deleting files, you can recover files.\n", "Q: Delete unused Today Widgets I'm trying to remove unused Today widgets from the Notification Center panel, although it's not clear on how to get rid of them (delete permanently).\n\nThe unused items show up after clicking the \"Edit\" button at the bottom of the Today Screen, but the only thing that the +/- seems to do is either add it to the panel or put it in a pile of unused widgets.

Reach out to your Apple sales contact and work with Apple Professional Services or Apple Enterprise Support to create things and make sure you aren't covered with a tool / program to mass enroll or have your user base self-enroll in an efficient manner.\nI've had good success getting our needs met across three organizations of differing sizes by reaching out to Apple for this need.\n\nA: You are going to have a hard time doing this, even if you got a working script for it. There is no way Apple would allow this from the same IP address before they blacklisted your ip. You're going to need a professional on this one. Just for starters, your going to need to buy a proxy service to keep your accounts on seperate IP's. Furthermore, you will need to do something similar with a paid \"Burner\" phone service that gives you temporary phone numbers in order to verify an account/accounts. Lastly, your going to need prepaid credit cards for each ID you register, as you cannot use the same payment method for 100k accounts. There are probably many other extra steps you need to take in order to pull something like this off, but I'm not Edward Snowden.

My Macbook Pro will only boot into recovery after upgrading Disk Utility from the App Store. In the Disk Utility in Recovery Mode, my disk can't be checked for errors and it cannot unmount. (I believe it also recognizes the existence of the filesystem but cannot verify it or something similar) I have taken the hard drive out of my device and used a disk enclosure and can view my files. How can I copy these files to another HD/SSD and boot from it (successfully) into macOS? I have a file encryptor that encrypts some of my files so I'd need all my app/file data to remain when I copy the files and boot the drive.\n\nA: Have a look at Carbon Copy Cloner: https://bombich.com/, it allows you to create bootable copies of your internal HDD.\n", "Q: `createinstallmedia` fails to create bootable volume for some Macs I’m using the createinstallmedia utility to create a bootable volume on an external 4TB USB drive. This drive has 6 partitions (some encrypted) on it, all of them are JHFS+, 1 is being used as the boot volume.\nThe drive successfully boots a MacBook Pro 2015. When holding down the option key during startup, I can see the external drive and successfully boot from it.\nIf I try to boot a Mac Mini 2012 using the same process, I don’t see the external drive. If I try to set the startup volume using System Preferences > Startup disk, the drive appears as an option, however upon restart, it fails to boot from the external volume.\nHere’s the odd bit. If I format the drive as a single 4TB volume, use createinstallmedia to make it bootable, it will boot the Mac Mini 2012. If I then resize the drive using Disk Utility, create some partitions, both normal and encrypted, it still boots the Mac Mini. If I then use createinstallmedia again over the top of the existing boot volume, it no longer boots the mac Mini. It will boot the Mac Book Pro.\nI have a limited knowledge of bless, but tried bless --folder \"/Volumes/EXT/System/Library/CoreServices\" --bootinfo --bootefi as per the man page. No Success.\nI also tried reducing the amount of partitions, from 6 to 5. That ended up booting the Mac Mini. Curiously, adding the 6th partition back again gave a successful boot, where the previous 6 partition configuration failed.\nIdeally I’d like to be able to easily use createinstallmedia to create an install drive for different versions of macOS, 10.11, 10.12, 10.13, across different hardware, from this 4TB drive.\nHas anybody else come across these kind of issues with booting from a 4TB drive?\n\nA: I just experienced a similar, though non-identical, issue with my own 2012 Mac Mini which failed to start-up from a bootable High Sierra installer on a 64GB multi-boot flash drive. The drive is formatted with bootable installer partitions for 10.6/10.8/10.9/10.10/10.11/10.12/10.13/blank. I, too, was able to view all the partitions as start-up drive options, but the Mini refused to actually boot from any of them. And recovery mode’s reinstaller was forcing the internal start-up SSD to reformat as AFPS, which I did not want. I put the Mini in target disk mode & connected it to my MacBook Air & the Air to the flash drive & used Terminal on the Air to install HFS+ High Sierra on the Mini. So, my take is that the issue is likely not related to details of the boot drive or its partitions but to something innate in the 2012 Mac Mini, itself.\n", "Q: I cannot connect to (specifically) google.com with any app using cellular data All other websites work and can be quickly accessed, even youtube.com will load. google.com will simply not load at all when I try to connect to it over cellular data.

Google Chrome 45 was the last one that could do it. Since then its been removed as an option. \nPerhaps reaching out to Google Support and giving them something to pass on to the devs for Chrome for Mac could inspire something. \nUntil they replace it, I recommend using a 3rd Party option since they work with nearly every platform and device type.

itself; any updates will require the credentials of the original owner... so trash it all & start over. Secondary benefit is you can be absolutely certain nothing can then spy on you. \nSee - Apple KB - What to do before you sell or give away your Mac\nAs the original owner failed to complete Steps 1 through 5, you can ignore & start from Step 6.\nYou would also benefit from having a more modern OS on there too.\n", "Q: Pages cannot open file File I had to force quit Pages as it was not responding (apparently my computer ran out of application memory and almost all applications stopped working).\nAfter restarting (which involved force quitting all those applications including pages), some (but not all) of the files that were open in the previous session cannot be opened. The error message I get reads\n\n\"File\" can't be opened right now.\nPages couldn't read the file.\n\nThe file exists and was apparently modified at a time after I worked on it last but well before the restart.\nIs there a way to re-claim the file or at least the text in it?\nEdit. It does not appear that the file is damaged, because even if I recover a previous version from backup, Pages cannot open that either (nor does it want to open a copy). So, it appears that the file is somehow locked.\n\nA: As it happens, the problem was very similar to another problem with preview I had previously, only that the error message was not claiming a permission issue.\nThe solution was, consequently, equally similar to that of the problem with preview:\n\n\n*\n\n*I removed the sub-directory ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iWorks.Pages/Data/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.iWork.Pages.savedState\n\n*I quit Pages and re-started it.\n", "Q: How to encrypt outgoing connections from a local device?

It depends on the VPN provider though whether they allow all kind of traffic though, some of them block/throttle torrents for instance. A VPN also doesn't protect you from ISPs throttling all VPN traffic by default.\n", "Q: Export Apple Mail Database for import into Outlook 2016 for Windows I have to migrate to Windows PC for the first time. All my work is email oriented and I have tons of emails on my Apple Mail email client and also I have saved a lot of them on my hard drive as .mbox files after exporting them from Apple mail. \nSo how can I export all these files from Apple Mail and import into  Outlook 2016 for Windows?\n\nA: If you have already exported your apple mail database as .mbox files then there is no other way but to use an email conversion tool that will convert the .mbox files into .pst files in order to import them into outlook 2016 for windows. One application that I am aware of is apple mail to pst converter: http://applemailtopst.com/buy-apple-mail-to-pst-converter/, that has the capability to convert the apple mail files directly from apple mail and that too on mac. \nI got this information from their website and in order to confirm its proper functioning, you can download its trial version which is free of cost.\nI hope this helps\n\nA: The only way I have been able to get Apple MBOX files to Outlook on Windows was to use a conversion tool.\nStellar Phoenix makes a MBOX to PST conversion  tool that I have used previously and it worked perfectly.   The price is quite reasonable at $39 and they offer you the ability to preview the conversion to ensure it will work for free.\nHowever, please note that the last time I used this was for a 2013 conversion.  Since then I personally, and advise my clients, friends, and family to use a cloud based email solution (like O365 with hosted Exchange) so you avoid this problem in the future.\n", "Q: How to automatically copy new photos from an iPhone to a Windows PC when plugged in? I prefer backing up and syncing my photos locally vs using iCloud and as such I have been trying to automate the process of locally syncing newly taken photos on an iPhone to my PC but have not been able to find any obvious solutions. One of the additional challenges is i'm looking for a solution that would work for sometimes alternating imports of two (or more) different iPhones.\nPreferred Solution Should:\n\n\n*\n\n*Automatically copy any new photos (and video) from the Camera Roll to a pre-configured folder after the phone is plugged in\n\n*Keep the original filenames as they are on the phone\n\n*Keep photos from different phones separate (ideally just sync them to a different folder)\n\n*I'm looking to sync from iPhone -> PC only as i can already sync edited photos and albums from PC -> iPhone via iTunes\n\n*Use native/free/scripted functionality\n\n\nI can live with:\n\n\n*\n\n*Having a couple of mouse clicks to start or approve the transfer\n\n*Doing the transfer over WiFi instead\n\n*Don't mind if the folder structure from the phone is replicated or the photos are copied flat\n\n\nCurrently i manually do a copy via Windows Explorer and just tell windows to not copy any existing files but this is not very efficient and i have to remember to do it every time i plug the phone in.\nClosest solution i have found that doesn't quite work for multiple devices is to use the Import functionality in Windows Photo App. This is also the listed method for importing pictures on the Apple Support Page\nA non free solution i think may work is to use something like MTPDrive which exposes the phone as a drive  and then script a SyncToy/copy script when the drive is available. \n\nA: The Windows Photos App solution will be the most efficient for you. It'll offer exactly what you requested and you can be assured that it'll not mix up photos or have duplicated copies since its intelligent enough to label these photos. \nOr you can use the file explorer. \niMore has a great breakdown of the steps you should take if you want to save your photos.

It wasn't a widely accepted standard so even when it was current, adapters were already difficult and expensive to source.\nWhat you need to get connected is to go from USB-C DisplayPort to Dual Link DVI.  This will require two adapters:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB-C Display Port to DisplayPort female adapter\n\n*DisplayPort to DL-DVI (powered)\n\n*A USB-A port to power the adapter (can be a wall charger)\n\n\nYou have to do this multi-step connection because USB-C to DL-DVI adapters are impossible to find.  The good news is that the USB-C port on MacBooks have the native DisplayPort signal so you aren't really converting anything - just the physical interface.\nThe active DisplayPort to DL-DVI is required because DP and DL-DVI are two completely different signals; a passive rearrangement of signal wires don't work here.  The active adapter \"recreates\" the signal being sent to the Cinema Display.\n(IMO) I wouldn't spend the money on this solution to get a Cinema Display working on a new MacBook.  The tech, while still good is obsolete and the active adapter isn't cheap.  I would sell the monitor to someone with an older Mac that can support this type of display and use the money you would've spent on the adapter with the proceeds from the sale of the Cinema Display on a shiny, brand new monitor (like a 4K or 5K).\n\nA: Same here - MacPro 6 Core 2013 and Cinema Display 30\"\nWorked well in low resolution while installing OSX, after switching to 2560x1600 all OK until restart.\nShows three states coincidentally:\na grey glowing screen \nmoving colored blocks\na normal screen\nSolution:\nThe D500 graphics in my MacPro 6 Core 2013 has this three states to talk to the monitor.\nIt choses what it likes after reboot.\nUse the shortcut to get the screen in sleep mode to switch modes until a normal screen displays\nCTRL + SHIFT + EJECT\n\nA: I found one of these displays locally in good condition for only 200 bucks, so I had to solve exactly this problem.\nFirst, specs - it's this exact model:\nhttps://everymac.com/monitors/apple/studio_cinema/specs/apple_cinema_display_30.html\nMy laptop is a 13\" 2017 MacBook Pro w/out touch bar, so only the 2 USB-C ports on one side.\nThis combination of dongles works, and provides full (2560 x 1600) resolution:\n$60: Monoprice Mini DisplayPort/Thunderbolt Plus USB To Dual-Link DVI Adaptor (106904)\nhttps://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B004C4SEH6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\nplus\n$20: USB Type C Adapter, AllSmartLife USB C Type to Mini DisplayPort/Mini DP Adapter Cable With Aluminium Case Support 4K resolution for Apple New Macbook, ChromeBook Pixel - Grey\nhttps://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B017TZTMBG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\nI hope this helps!\n\nA: I have the exact same problem and after much search, came to this solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dual-Link DIV to DisplayPort using Apple's connector\n\n*DisplayPort to USB-C using this connector Which is a  USB-C to Mini-DisplayPort and Charging Port Adapter {Amazon.com}\n\n\nKeep in mind that the Cinema display also needs a USB-A connection (I'm guessing to provide power to some internal circuit for link negotiation?), so you'll need a separate adapter from USB-C to USB-A.\nI'm also an amateur photographer and shoots with a Canon 5DsR, editing my photos using an AdobeRGB LG 4K display (10-bit color to support AdobeRGB). I've also tested the DisplayPort adapter on this display and it works flawlessly.\nOn a side note - reason why you'll need a separate adapter for USB-A instead of having the USB-A built-in to the DisplayPort adapter is that only way for USB-C to support DisplayPort data-rate is using Display Protocol, which turns a bi-directional USB connection (10Gbit/direction) to a uni-directional output port (20Gbit total). If you work out the math: 3840 * 2160 * 10-bit color per channel * 3 color channels (RGB) * 60 Hz = 15Gbit/s.\n\nA: Apple does not make an official adapter for your hardware combination.\nThis active adapter worked for me: Club 3D CAC-1510 USB Type C to DVI-D Dual Link Active Adapter, 3840 X 2160 @ 30Hz, 2560 X 1600P @ 60Hz, Deep Color 12 Bit\n\n\n*\n\n*Computer: Apple MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports)\n\n*Monitor: Apple 30\" Cinema HD\n\n*Resolution: 2560x1920\n\n\nAlso read https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mchl86d72b76/mac for instructions to change the resolution once the dongle is connected.\n\n\nA: I have confirmed that the following setup works for native 2560x1600 resolution:\n\n\n*\n\n*Apple Cinema Display 30\" (Dual-Link DVI)\n\n*Apple Dual-Link DVI to Mini DisplayPort Adapter\n\n*$15 Amazon unbranded USB-C to Mini DP Adapter\n\n*USB-C MacBook or MacBook Pro\n\n\nThe key seems to be to continue to use the OEM Apple Dual-Link DVI to Mini DisplayPort adapter that you formerly used to connect Macs with ThunderBolt 2. If you're using that component, any cheap DisplayPort to USB-C adapter should enable full resolution.\nI will continue to do some testing and improve this answer. End goal will be to have a single USB-C cable connected to the laptop that delivers:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cinema Display 30\" @ 2560x1600\n\n*Cinema Display USB ports\n\n*Cinema Display FireWire ports (stretch goal)\n\n*Laptop wall power via USB-C\n\n\nA: I just had to create an account to share my success. I am posting this from a 2016 MacBook Pro 13\" connected perfectly at 2560x1600 to my CinemaDisplay 30. I used these two adapters from Amazon (totaling $13 and change):\nUSB C to Mini DisplayPort\nXVZ USB C to USB Adapter\nAnd then an \"Apple Mini Display Port to Dual-Link DVI Adapter\" that I've actually had laying around for like 10 years in a box. The part number is A1306. A quick eBay search shows them selling relatively cheap, so it might be a more economical solution than the $100-150 active dual-link DVI adapters posted earlier in this thread.\nApple A1306 on eBay\nBest of luck getting your USB-C devices connected to your CinemaDisplay 30!

When I restored from iTunes backup, my Google Authenticator is blank. \nI have lot of sites configured and I am not sure what to do now. Any help? I did download the backup codes from Google and it gave 10 codes. How do I used the codes for other sites like coinbase, Amazon, etc.?\n\nA: You can't restore the Google authenticator, you must reinstall it.\nIf Google Authenticator is anything like Microsoft's authenticator, it is tied to the device, not just the account.  This is how Google knows it's actually you because you are using a device that you have in your posssession (it wouldn't be secure if you could use it on any device anywhere).\nWhen you restored, you restored the Authenticator tied to your old device and since the devices are technically different, nothing comes up.  This is expected behavior as the app intentionally doesn’t include data in an encrypted backup to allow your tokens to transfer with the rest of the device backup like Apple keychains and health data and other iOS saved passwords and settings. \n\nA: Unfortunately, Google Authenticator doesn’t offer a restore option. Not all services offer backup codes. If you have backup codes from Google you can use them only to restore an access to your Google account. If you haven’t downloaded backup codes from other services you should restore an access to your accounts with the help of Support Team. Contact the Support Team of each service you protect with Google Authenticator, they will help you to restore an access to your accounts. After this, you’ll be able to issue tokens on your new iPhone.\n", "Q: Safari see times in history I use Safari on my MacBook.\nI'm disappointed the History page doesn't show times a site was loaded.\nHow can I view the times that a website was visited?\nOther answers on this site don't work for me on High Sierra, the path ~/Library/Caches/Metadata doesn't exist.\n\nA: On High Sierra the path is: ~/Library/Safari/History.db\nI believe it's a SQLite database.

I have an iPhone 8 and I would like to use it to answer calls of my older Android phone, which I still keep and I have another line on it. How could I pair my iPhone to the other phone to use the iPhone as a Bluetooth headset?\n\nA: This is not something you can do, at least without jailbreaking it.\n", "Q: Bluetooth connection to Sony Bluetooth Headphones (Macbook Pro 2014 / iPhone 6s) I've purchased set of Sony Headphones (WH1000XM2). \nThey are great, but I can't figure out how to have two simultaneous connections with my MacBook and iPhone.  The headphones will connect to either individually but not at the same time.  I want to have it that I can listen to music on the Mac, and answer a call on the phone when it comes in.  I have tried this with a PC and iPhone and it's fine.\nI believe I need to create a A2DP connection on the Mac, and a HFP connection on the iPhone. That's based on the info here - http://helpguide.sony.net/mdr/wh1000xm2/v1/en/contents/TP0001513163.html\n \nI've downloaded Apple's Bluetooth Explorer and tried various settings related to \"Disable Hands-free profile\" and \"aptX\" but nothing works. I’m at the stage where I’m testing random permutations as I don’t understand the options.  \nDoes anyone know if this can be done?  Headphones will be going back if not.\n\nA: That's not the way Bluetooth works.  While you can connect multiple devices (multiple BT profiles) you can't connect them simultaneously.\n\nI want to have it that I can listen to music on the Mac, and answer a\n  call on the phone when it comes in.\n\nThis is where Apple's Continuity comes into play.  You can have your BT headphones connected to your Mac and simultaneously make/receive phone calls and have them come through the headphones (or via the internal mic and speaker if you want).\n\nA: I have the same problem and I'm working on it. it was about 2 month. But I have not been successful.  At the same time, 2 iphone or android are connected. But it's not a MacBook. This is due to the MacBook. What we need to find is that the Mac computer only makes the A2DP bluetooth connection. But I have tried hard, but I have not succeeded.\nI could not find any solution. I found a workaround for making phone calls and listening to music at the same time.\n1- I connected my headset to a computer with a microphone AUX cable.\nhttps://www.aliexpress.com/item/BASEUS-Brand-1-2M-AUX-Audio-Cable-With-MIC-3-5mm-male-to-male-extension-AUX/32696482589.html\n2- I installed the Hands Free 2 program and connected it via Bluetooth.\nhttps://www.tunabellysoftware.com/handsfree2/\nNow I can answer calls from my computer while listening to music.\nit's a temporary solution but it's working for now.

When I put my AirPods in my ears, I can hear a ping sound, indicating a successful connection to my iPhone. My friend who also has AirPods is sensitive to moderately loud sounds, and this sound is too loud for them. Is there a way to reduce the volume of this sound, or disable it?\n\nA: Try skipping the connect sound by playing something on the phone music or youtube video first before connecting your AirPods to the bluetooth.  I also find the connect sound a bit too loud in my ears. Hope this helps before Apple introduce the feature to adjust the volume of the connect sound. :)\n\nA: No. The system tracks the AirPod volume and the system volume separately so you can keep the phone loud and the AirPods low after they pair, but the connect sound that happens when the AirPods detect they are in your ear canal are set in firmware and not user adjustable. \nUnless you can place one in your hand and trigger the connection/proximity sensor this would need a setting to be added to the firmware or software. \n\nA: Disable automatic detection of ears on your Airpods - you won't hear the chime when putting them in ears : )\nHope it helps !\nAlso with this trick when taking them out of the case - wait for them to be connected to your device before putting them in ears\n", "Q: Does Amazon Prime video support Dolby Vision on Apple TV? Amazon Prime video came to Apple TV today. Amazon Prime video supports Dolby Vision, but does it support it on Apple TV. I ask because Amazon Prime video doesn't support all Dolby Vision capable devices.\nIn my case I have an Apple TV 4K.\n\nA: As of now, it does not. Amazon Prime Video on Apple TV 4K will send HDR10 content, which can be converted to Dolby Vision on the Apple TV itself, or sent directly as HDR10 if the \"match content\" setting is enabled on your box. Amazon Prime on Apple TV also annoyingly streams 2.1 PCM audio instead of 5.1, though Amazon says this is temporary, and that Dolby Digital Plus audio is coming soon to Apple TV 4K. \nFor full compatibility, take a look at the supported devices / formats page on Amazon's website: \nCompatible Amazon Video devices and the features available on each device.\n", "Q: macOS not allowing to change the sequence of partitions from command line! This is the Disk List for my iMac.\n\nI am trying to merge the partitions macOS and macOS 2 using diskutil mergePartitions now the problem is on running this command macOS will keep data on the first partition which is macOS and will erase everything in between the first and last partition (Last partition included), now the last partition is macOS 2.\nI want to preserve the last partition which is macOS 2 and delete every other partition so I thought why not include the last partition as the first partition (Which I want to preserve the data on) and include the first partition in the last parameter - which will be deleted. \nHere's where the issue occurs macOS doesn't allows me to change the sequence of the partition\nSo I am stuck with merging partitions from command line\nI don't want to use disk utility to merge partitions cause last time when I used it to merge partitions some free spaces were created and were not going away until and unless an entire disk format was performed!\nOne more thing macOS is the first volume on the disk so removing it from dusk utility using the partition option will not happen\n\nA: Since the volumes are about the same size, you can use the Disk Utility application to \"Restore\" the macOS volume from the macOS 2 volume. You basically will then have duplicated macOS 2. You then can delete disk0s4 and expand disk0s2 to recover the free space.\nAll these operations can be performed using the Disk Utility application.\nIf you are wish to use the command line, then here is the command to clone the volume labeled \"macOS 2\".\nsudo asr restore --source \"/Volumes/macOS 2\" --target /Volumes/macOS --erase\n\n\nNote: The above command also clones /dev/disk0s5 to /dev/disk0s3.\n\nThe command to delete /dev/disk0s4 and expand /dev/disk0s2 is given below.\ndiskutil mergePartitions FREE \"\" disk0s2 disk0s4  \n\n\nNote: The above command also deletes /dev/disk0s5 and relocates /dev/disk0s3 to be below the expanded /dev/disk0s2.\n\nThe clone/restore operation could be done while booted from /dev/disk0s5. The merge operation could be done while booted to /dev/disk0s2.\n\nA: You can't expand disk0s4 to lower blocks numbers with on-board tools! To \"expand\" disk0s4 you would have to remove disk0s2 , add a new partition with the same size and type as disk0s4 directly following disk0s1 all with gpt, dd disk0s4 to disk0s2, delete disk0s3 and disk0s4 with gpt and finally expand disk0s2 with diskutil into the unallocated space between disk0s2 and disk0s5.\nInstead of the last two steps you can also use the diskutil mergePartitions ... command.\nAll that booted either in Internet Recovery Mode or an external drive with macOS installed.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Internet Recovery Mode or an external boot drive (if you aren't superuser you have to prepend sudo to gpt ... and dd ... commands. \n\n*Get an overview and check disk and volumes (repair if necessary) :\ndiskutil verifyDisk disk0\ndiskutil verifyVolume disk0s2\ndiskutil verifyVolume disk0s4\ndiskutil list\ngpt -r show disk0\n\n\n*Remove disk0s2:\ndiskutil umountDisk disk0\ngpt remove -i 2 disk0\n\n\n*add a partition with the same size as disk0s3\ndiskutil umountDisk disk0\ngpt add -i 2 -b 409640 -s 485642672 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC disk0\n\n\n*copy disk0s4 to disk0s2:\ndiskutil umountDisk disk0\ndd if=/dev/disk0s4 of=/dev/disk0s2 bs=4m\n\n\n*merge disk0s2-disk0s4 and rename macOS 2 to macOS:\ndiskutil mergePartitions HFS+ \"macOS\" disk0s2 disk0s4 \n\n", "Q: Siri - Change language without completing the setup I was playing with Siri and somehow I came up with the idea to change the language of Siri to Japanese, then I tried going through the set up (I managed to do so in Russian & totally forgot that Japanese is way different than English/Russian), but because my Japanese is non existent  I cannot complete it.\nNow I don't have the option of changing the language and I cannot read the following text.\nCan I reset the settings without resetting the phone itself?\nEdit: So I cross posted this question on reddit.com.

The app does not run on iPad, so I would like to mirror my iPhone screen on the iPad.\nCan this be done?  If not, any suggestions. \n\nA: Note that the iPad contains a (1X/2X) emulator for all iPhone apps (except those that specifically require telephony).  So just run the iPhone app on your iPad.  No iPad code, storyboards, or iPad specific or Universal settings in Xcode are required to do this.\n\nA: I do not believe there is a way to do this without an intermediary device. If you have a Mac, you can connect your iPhone to your computer via Lightning cable and open QuickTime Player and select File > New Movie Recording. When the window opens, press the carat/arrow next to the record button to select your iPhone. You can fullscreen this window and it mirrors your iPhone's screen.\nIf you really need to have it on your iPad, you could do a VNC screen share the above from your Mac to your iPad.\n", "Q: How do I distinguish between identical phones that can't turn on? I have 2 identical looking iPhone 7s which are I am not sure came with which sim tray, and that won't turn on.\nHow do I distinguish between them to determine which one is covered under Apple care?  I don't want to bring the wrong device in.\nEdit: I do have the orginal sim trays but I am not sure which goes with which.\n\nA: There is a cable at all Apple Stores that can obtain the serial number from the great majority of no power iPhones when connected to a specific application. Not all no power devices are able to connect, but upwards of 90% do, in my experience.\nThe only real issue I can foresee is that technically speaking you should only bring one device per appointment. That said, I really can't imagine anyone refusing to even check the serial number on two phones in one session, especially since you're only planning to get service on the one that is in warranty.\nOh, and be prepared for the no power iPhone to be gone for 10 days or longer undergoing screening before replacement if you ship it from an Apple Store. You can blame years of rampant warranty fraud for that.\nIf the technician is able to obtain the serial number of the device that has AppleCare for you, you would actually actually be better off getting service through AppleCare over the phone once you have that serial number. They can ship you the new phone while you wait for the device to get through screening at least. Unfortunately, they do put a hold on your credit card, but if the device passes through screening, you are, of course, not charged.\nIf you can't get to the stores, you get one shot as a consumer seeking warranty service to identify an iPhone 7 or later that won't turn on when connected to power or a computer.\nThe one item that's externally serialized is the SIM tray.\nIf you don't have confidence which tray belongs to which phone or it’s lost, Apple or an authorized tech may need to disassemble the device if they need to establish the serial in question before offering warranty service eligibility.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204073\nOlder iPhone had them engraved on the case as well, but that could wear out, so all Apple warranty providers are well trained in how to help you establish eligibility for repair if need be. It might delay the repair, but you won't lose service due to this alone in my experience.\nA long shot might be if you know the phone number for the phone, the carrier might have records of the IMEI / MEID / CDN / ICCID that would help Apple locate your serial. Again, this like the packing slips or packaging or receipt won’t help you if you don’t know which phone is which.\n", "Q: Restoring a Time Machine backup to a machine with a password on the drive I've inherited an older Retina Macbook Pro from a deceased relative. I don't know the password for their user account, and I would like to make the machine usable.\nI have a Time Machine backup from my own MBP, however when attempting to restore it, I'm asked for the disk's password: \nI also can't mount the disk using Disk Utilities, as it again asks me for a password to unlock the disk.\nI don't mind losing data, I just want the machine to be usable again. What are my next steps?\n\nA: Go back to the screen that lets you see the initial screen if there isn't a Utilities menu where you can access Disk Utility.\nAt that point, you want to fire up Disk Utility and eject the backup disk (or start over without the backup drive connected) and erase the target drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/PH22241\nThis will wipe all data and the OS off that drive but it won't ask for the password since you aren't reading the data - just making a new blank filesystem on top of the old one.\nThen you can proceed to boot and choose the blank drive to restore.\nA full guide is available from Apple on how to erase and install an OS.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25649\nJust remember to not erase your only copy of bootable macOS or have a plan to make a bootable drive if you need one.\n\nA: I don't know how you might bypass the password on the Retina's disk. \nHowever, you could consider bypassing the Retina's disk entirely by replacing it. With a new (or at least blank) HD or SSD in the Retina and a bootable macOS installer on a USB stick, you could boot from the USB stick, then format the new disk, and proceed to your restore. \n", "Q: After re-assembly, iMac 27\" fans blowing at full speed all the time After disassembly and reassembly to fix an HDD cable issue, my iMac is now a blowhard - the fans are going at full tilt from about 30 seconds after boot. I don't believe the device is overheating - I surely messed up one of the temperature sensors upon reassembly.\nMy question - beyond carefully checking each JST connection and making sure I've re-attached all the sensor cables on the motherboard, is there any way I can control the fans via software? I believe I have more-or-less permanently damaged the skin sensor - so can I disable that through software configuration or a 3rd party utility?\nUPDATE\nIt's not the HDD / SDD temp sensor, by the way, since it's not the HDD fan that's spinning that hot, but it certainly is one of the other sensors. The ODD fan's RPMs are strangely high, but it's the CPU fan that's out of control. Mac's Fan Control is definitely doing the job for now (I'm using the CPU heatsink temp as my RPM controller). I'll need to get in there and determine which of the sensors is the one acting up.\nI wonder whether I can tell which sensor is acting up based on either A) the list of sensors appearing in the Mac's Fan Control sensor list (or, more precisely, the sensor that's NOT appearing in that list) or B) the temperature of a given sensor that's way out of whack.\n\nA: Yes, there is a 3rd party app called Mac's Fan Control which allows you to adjust the speed of your fans. It gives you the current speed of your fans and has different options for setting the speed. You can set a variable speed which forces the fans to go faster as temperature goes up - as they are supposed to do. \nthere is also an app Temperature Gauge 4.1 that lets you monitor the temperature of different areas of your Mac and the fan speeds.\n\nA: The thermal sensor is indeed responsible for this and the issue (if we can even call it one) has been around for a long time. Two or Three years ago, I upgraded my iMac from the original HDD to a speedy SSD and had to find out the hard way.\nIt quickly became apparent that the thermal sensor causes this to happen and I had to find a way to reduce the screaming 6300ish RPMs of the internal fan down to the usual 2000-3000 RPM range.\nAfter searching the internet for software, I came across a lightweight application called SSD Fan Control that comfortably resides in my Applications folder and doesn't require my attention except for cases where the iMac clearly requires a little more airflow. However, because it is located in one location (contrary to a laptop), I am able to estimate its airflow requirements very easily.\nOther options such as Mac's Fan Control have more customisation options but for me, lightweight was key. Furthermore, it was important to have it set up once and not be bothered by it. SSD Fan control has never given me a popup, ads or asked me to upgrade to a new version. I, therefore, strongly recommend it and swear by its easy to use and efficient design and practicality.\n", "Q: How to launch pf at startup? I am looking for a pretty elegant way to launch the pf - a.k.a. Packet Filtering - process at startup. Using the launchctl or the pfctl commands, root privileges are required and so it is useless to add them into .bash_profile. Are there alternative solutions to this issue?\n\nA: By default pf is silenced at startup, a launch daemon com.apple.pfctl.plist exists though in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/. To enable pf while booting you would have to add an -e switch in the plist.\nSince all files in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ are protected by SIP in macOS 10.11 and later you have to disable it first.\nThen, after booting to the main system, edit the launch daemon plist:\nsudo nano /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.pfctl.plist\n\nand replace\n  ...\n  <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>/sbin/pfctl</string>\n    <string>-f</string>\n    <string>/etc/pf.conf</string>\n  </array>\n  ...\n\nwith\n  ...\n  <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>/sbin/pfctl</string>\n    <string>-e</string>\n    <string>-f</string>\n    <string>/etc/pf.conf</string>\n  </array>\n  ...\n\nReboot to Recovery Mode and enable SIP again.\n\nA: It is possible to launch processes at startup using daemons. You can create a daemon - or even edit an already existing one - respectively adding or modifying a .plist file inside /System/Library/LaunchDaemons or /Library/LaunchDaemons.\nIn my case, running macOS Sierra, a daemon for pfctl was already located inside one of those folders but it was set up without the -e option; consequently, at startup the daemon was launched without any effect.\nThe issue has been solved adding that mentioned option, plus something more despite it is not properly necessary:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n  <key>Disabled</key>\n  <false/>\n  <key>Label</key>\n  <string>com.apple.pfctl</string>\n  <key>WorkingDirectory</key>\n  <string>/var/run</string>\n  <key>Program</key>\n  <string>/sbin/pfctl</string>\n  <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n  <array>\n    <string>/sbin/pfctl</string>\n    <string>-e</string>\n    <string>-f</string>\n    <string>/etc/pf.conf</string>\n  </array>\n  <key>RunAtLoad</key>\n  <true/>\n  <key>StandardErrorPath</key>\n  <string>/var/log/pfctl.err</string>\n  <key>StandardOutPath</key>\n  <string>/var/log/pfctl.out</string>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\n\nA: \nAre there alternative solutions to this issue?\n\nYes*, in System Preferences / Security & Privacy / Firewall Options..., check \"Enable stealth mode\" and turn on Firewall.\nSomehow this enables PF. You can check by running sudo pfctl -s info.\n*Tested on High Sierra and Mojave\n\nA: If you don't want to mess about disabling System Integrity Protection (SIP), you can simply copy the existing file /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.pfctl.plist to the unprotected user area /Library/LaunchDaemons giving it a slightly different name eg. /Library/LaunchDaemons/my.netfilter.pfctl.plist.\nThen make your edits, I changed the Label name to match the filename and added the -e option as described in the other answers.\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n<dict>\n    <key>Label</key> <string>my.netfilter.pfctl</string>\n    <key>Disabled</key> <false/>\n    <key>RunAtLoad</key> <true/>\n    <key>WorkingDirectory</key> <string>/var/run</string>\n    <key>Program</key> <string>/sbin/pfctl</string>\n    <key>ProgramArguments</key>\n    <array>\n        <string>pfctl</string>\n        <string>-e</string>\n        <string>-f</string>\n        <string>/etc/pf.conf</string>\n    </array>\n</dict>\n</plist>\n\nAfter reboot check it's running with pfctl -s all.\nTested on Mojave.\n\nA: Enable PF via Console\nHere is how to enable your Mac Packet Filter (PF), and have it turn on automatically after each reboot.

Though, when I run the script, I would like the service to ask me for a variable and then input it into the \"start numbers at\" box.\nIs there a way to do this? Thanks.\n\nA: Checked \"Show this action when the workflow runs\". \nThis allows me to choose what number to start at.\n\nA: This is a good idea.  \"Rename x files\" does indeed appear in my Finder (MacOS Catalina 10.15.7), but seems to be of limited use: there doesn't seem to be a way to preserve the original name nor control the number of digits in the sequence number (using the \"Format\" option, all the files come out like 1 File.jpg instead of 01 Start the engine.jpg). To make this Automator workflow appear in Finder's File > Services context menu, had to a) save it in ~/Library/Services, and b) save it as type Quick Action (using File > Convert to).  NB when you do that, the name still ends in .workflow despite now not being a \"Workflow\". \n", "Q: How to automatically run apps in iphone? I want to open the YouTube app on my iPhone 7 at 8 am every day and open the first video in the list. How can I accomplish this?\n\nA: Using the example in your question, if you're wanting this to happen automatically without some sort of user intervention, then I doubt this is going to be possible. This is because of security restrictions in place to protect your privacy, data, etc. For example, being able to open the YouTube app would require the iPhone being unlocked, so it's not something that can be set to just happen at 8am every day with or without you.\nIf you're talking about a way to quickly do this sort of thing with a single tap of a button, then you may want to check out Apple's Workflow app.\nIt does take a bit of exploring and getting used to, but once you create a workflow it can be launched from the Today Widget or even be exported as a standalone app on your home screen, amongst other options.\nI don't think the exact example you give in your question would be possible, at least not yet, but Apple is working very hard on increasing the functionality of both Siri and Workflow to incorporate better integration within and between apps. It's a case of 'watch this space'.\nBut, even with the current version, I've seen people achieve some pretty cool workflows, so it may be possible to do what you want if you find the right app. By this I mean that there's a Workflow Action Extension that allows workflows to be run from other apps - so if you could find an alarm app that uses this extension I suppose in theory you could use that to trigger your workflow automatically because it'd be an alarm going off.\nFinally, if the example you gave in your question is actually all you're wanting to achieve, there are many 3rd party alarm apps that play YouTube videos at the allocated time. You could check to see if any of these will play whatever video is first on the YouTube list.\n", "Q: Stop latest upgrade from installing I  downloaded by accident the latest update by Apple, currently running 10.13.1. \nI can't upgrade to 10.13.2 due to a problem with the GPU which makes it impossible to boot up. \nRight now it's asking to restart in order to install it.

There is enough room!\nOn the time machine backup, that is how it is stored.  Both drives are backed up and all my data is there.\nI want to remove the SSD from the iMac and just have the single large HDD.  When I restore from the TM backup the home folder is just a symlink to a folder that does not exist.  This is expected.\nI have manually removed the symlink and replaced it with an actual folder, but trying to copy the backed up 'home' folder is not working out so well.\nI want to just \"move\" the contents of /Volumes/iMacHDD/iMac to /Volumes/iMacSSD/User/iMac. This would make the backup like it came from a single drive.  So when I restore to a single drive everything would be there.\nroot privileges is not enough to modify the TM drive.  How would I go about converting the symlink iMac to a hard link? or is there a better option?\nAny attemp to modify (via rm cp mv) results in a \"this is not allowed/you can't do that\" error. (I don't recall the exact wording)\nEDIT: \"error\" messages\nrm iMac = rm: iMac: Permission denied\nsudo rm iMac = rm: iMac: Operation not permitted\n\nA: After a lot of searching and messing around I found the answer.... thanks to this post\n/System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/Helpers/bypass will allow you to make changes.\nBUT....  I could not perform a mv so I resorted to using rsync right on the TM backup and ignored most of all my files.  This in turn allowed me to restore to a slimmed down backup.\nAfter this I tried using Time Machine to copy the rest of my files back to my home folder, it kept failing.\nIn the end, enabling guest login and using rsync got me what I wanted.\nIf I had to do this again I would do it this way;\n\n\n*\n\n*Do the restore as per normal, the login WILL FAIL! this is because\nyour home folder is a broken symlink.\n\n*Boot back into the recovery/install disc and use terminal to rm the symlink and mkdir your home folder of the same name. (you may need to chown this to your user) ** if you can also use rsync from this terminal, skip the Guest step and use rsync now.  I could not**\n\n*Do a regular boot, once logged in, turn on Guest login, logout and back in as Guest\n\n*Open terminal and su to your user.\n\n*Use rsync directly to the TM volume and restore all your home folder.\n\n*Check and make sure permissions are correct, reboot!\n\n*Everything should look just as it did before you removed your first/second HDD.  Turn off Guest login.\n\n\nNever symlink your home folder!  While this worked fine, it made recovery a PIA! rather, symlink your individual folders like Documents, Music, Photos, Movies, etc.  It doesn't look as clean, but in the end, it is safer.\nIf my \"data\" drive had gone down, I would have had the same issues as I did with this.

Windows also stores boot software in this partition. \n\n*disk1s2 is used by macOS. The partition is not used by Windows.\n\n*disk1s3 is used by macOS. The partition is not used by Windows.\n\n*disk1s4 is used by Windows. The partition is not used by macOS.\n\n*disk1s5 is used by Windows. The partition is not used by macOS.\n\n\ndisk1 is virtual and exists because you are using core storage. \ndisk2 is the USB macOS installer.\nThe rest of the disks and partitions only exist because you are booted to the macOS installer. You should not try to delete these partitions.\nBasically, the installer creates virtual disks in your computer's volitile RAM memory. These disks are used for temporary file storage. For example, compressed files stored on the USB drive are decompressed and stored on these disks.\nYou should be able to delete disk0s2 and disk0s3 without affecting Windows. If for some reason Windows will not boot, then you will need to create a bootable USB Windows Installer to fix the problem. If necessary, you can do this from macOS. I would avoid deleting the macOS volume. Instead I would do the following.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to the USB macOS installer.\n\n*Open the Disk Utility application.\n\n*Erase the macOS volume using the format \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\". This  should:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove Core Storage  on partition disk0s2.\n\n*Remove the \"Recovery HD\" volume on partition disk0s3.\n\n*Create a  \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" volume on a new partition.\n\n\n*Exit the Disk Utility application.\n\n*Restart and boot back to the USB macOS installer.\n\n*Install High Sierra on to the new volume. This should also create a new \"Recovery HD\" volume.\n\n", "Q: AppleScript - How to set variables for an undetermined number of list items? I'm new to AppleScript. I'm trying to create a script which takes the list items from a previous Automator workflow action and convert them into variables.\nThere will be an undetermined number of list items (well, between 1 and 40 each run).\nThis works for a determined number of list items, let's say three.\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    set value of variable \"F1\" of front workflow to item 1 of input\n    set value of variable \"F2\" of front workflow to item 2 of input\n    set value of variable \"F3\" of front workflow to item 3 of input\n\n    return input\nend run\n\nBut if there are only two list items generated from the previous workflow action, we run into problems.\nSo, I updated the script using if to try to get around this issue.\non run {input, parameters}\n\n    if item 1 exists then\n        set value of variable \"F1\" of front workflow to item 1 of input\n    end if\n    if item 2 exists then\n        set value of variable \"F2\" of front workflow to item 2 of input\n    end if\n    if item 3 exists then\n        set value of variable \"F3\" of front workflow to item 3 of input\n    end if\n\n    return input\nend run\n\nWhen I run this, only the first variable F1 populates. The others are left blank/do not populate. I'm not sure how to move forward with this?\nCan anyone tell me if I'm on the right track, or if there's a better way to do this?\n\nA: Variable declaration must be made before run time. The following example AppleScript code, run in Script Editor, is to demonstrate a way of doing it:\nset input to {\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"}\n\nset F1 to missing value\nset F2 to missing value\nset F3 to missing value\nset F4 to missing value\n\ntry\n    if item 1 of input is not missing value then\n        set F1 to item 1 of input\n        log \"F1 is: \" & F1\n    end if\n    if item 2 of input is not missing value then\n        set F2 to item 2 of input\n        log \"F2 is: \" & F2\n    end if\n    if item 3 of input is not missing value then\n        set F3 to item 3 of input\n        log \"F3 is: \" & F3\n    end if\n    if item 4 of input is not missing value then\n        set F4 to item 4 of input\n        log \"F4 is: \" & F4\n    end if\nend try\n\nlog \"F4 is still: \" & F4\n\nThe log result is:\n(*F1 is: one*)\n(*F2 is: two*)\n(*F3 is: three*)\n(*F4 is still: missing value*)\n\nObviously the log command is being used to show that the variables were assigned a new value, except the last one because the input list only had three items in it. You'll need to built this out for however many variables could be needed, as you can't add them after execution of the code has started. You mentioned \"between 1 and 40 each run\" in your OP.\nYou'd remove the log commands for the real code  within each of the if statement blocks, besides the variable assignments, as appropriate at that point in the execution of the code, if any.\nNote that by wrapping the code of the group of if statement blocks, that sets the new value of the variables based on the value of the list item, in a try statement when there are less items in the input list, it doesn't throw an error that would halt execution of the code, and continues with the remaining code. \nThe value of the variable is initially being assigned missing value, however \"\" (double-quotes) can be used instead as well. I like to use missing value at times as it can be easier to read the code.\nNOTE: The example AppleScript code above it just that, and is coded as is to demonstrate a way of assigning the variables a value from a list. Which is what input is in the context of e.g. on run {input, parameters} of a Run AppleScript action in an Automator workflow. Depending on what the source of the input is and what will be done with it, you may need to add e.g. as string or as text or other coercion as appropriate as/if applicable, in this case after item n of input, e.g. set F1 to item 1 of input as string.\n", "Q: Apple Setting App Complication When I needed storage I did something under the storage section in settings to undownload the apps I haven’t used in a while and if I want to go back into the app after so many days then I have to redownload it but after so many days it undownloads after I downloaded it.

For example, tell the system when at home the TB Display is on the left and horizontally oriented, but at work it is on the right and vertically oriented, etc..\nIs there an app or AppleScript technique that manages this?\n\nA: I wrote a tool called displayplacer that does exactly this. It will let you set up profiles for changing the resolution, rotation, and positioning of your monitors.\nFor example, here's my 4 monitor setup profile: displayplacer \"id:A46D2F5E-487B-CC69-C588-ECFD519016E5 res:3840x2160 hz:60 color_depth:8 scaling:off origin:(0,0) degree:0\" \"id:F466F621-B5FA-04A0-0800-CFA6C258DECD res:1440x900 color_depth:4 scaling:on origin:(-1440,1437) degree:0\" \"id:4C405A05-8798-553B-3550-F93E7A7722BB res:1440x2560 color_depth:8 scaling:off origin:(3840,-363) degree:270\" \"id:18173D22-3EC6-E735-EEB4-B003BF681F30 res:1920x1200 color_depth:8 scaling:off origin:(960,-1200) degree:0\"\nIt's also available via Homebrew brew tap jakehilborn/jakehilborn && brew install displayplacer . On MacPorts, a ticket 65216 requests adding it to MacPorts.\n\nA: The best I've been able to find that does this is SwitchResX, To get what you're asking for, I believe you would set up a display set for your home and work environment. SwitchResX also advertises that it can be controlled via AppleScript.\n", "Q: Exposé App Focus Loss issue macOS Sierra (10.12.6)\nWhen I enter Exposé using any method, I select my desired window and it comes to the forefront, but then focus switches back to my previous app no matter what.\nExample:\n\n\n*\n\n*Doing something in Safari\n\n*Use Exposé to switch to Email (not app switcher)\n\n*Email comes to the front (or un-minimizes)\n\n*Safari comes back to the front\n\n\nThis also happens if I switch between windows of the same app. Meaning, if I switch from one email window to another email window via Expose, Safari again takes focus.\nIt's a simple bug with Exposé not giving focus to the correct app, but this all works perfectly on my other computer running Yosemite.\n\nA: This is a bug that occurs when the app in question is assigned to \"All Desktops\".\nHere's a work-around: right click the App in the dock and select Options > Assign to > This Desktop or None.\n\n", "Q: iOS 11 mail - manual fetch gone? Except for my iCloud account, which gets very little traffic, I only use POP3 email.

I use \"My Photo Stream\" to sync new photos into the Photos app on macOS. I just learned live photos are synced as still images via the stream.\nWhen I want to reimport those live photos they are hidden under thousands of already imported photos.\nIs there a way or a tool to easily reimport those live photos to complete my library on macOS?\n\nA: I ran into the same problem, luckily I had not deleted the files from the camera roll of my iPhone.\nPhotos.app will recognize the Live Photos as duplicates when already imported by Photo Stream as still photo.\nThe good thing is that you can reimport those \"duplicate\" Live Photos in Photos.app and they will not duplicate but will be replaced with the correct Live Photo version. Use \"Import Selected\" button.\nThe problem now is that manual selection of thousands of photos is not an option.... so I reimported the whole camera roll by dragging a frame over all the already imported files, including all duplicates (still photos and Live Photos) into the Photos.app. You will get an error message that \"Duplicate bursts are not supported“, if you also have duplicate bursts to import,  but that is even better in this situation avoiding unnecessary dupes. The rest of the duplicate still photos then can be filtered out using third party software like Duplicate Annihilator or PowerPhotos.\nIt is really stupid that the Photos.app is not giving an option to just replace the still versions of the Live Photos during import... would make our lives easier.\nDon't forget to disable Photo Stream to not run into this issue again!\nAnd make backups before messing around with your Photos.app Library!\nUPDATE\nI yesterday checked my iCloud settings on iPhone running iOS 12.2 and discovered, that somehow Photostream was active again. I am not sure how that happened. Had to go through the whole process again. I will now check after every iOS and macOS update if settings changed...\n", "Q: Is FileVault insecure by default with EFI auto-login enabled? This question really stems from the fact that I'm perhaps unfamiliar with the true function of FileVault. As far as I can tell, there's a way to force a pre-boot login screen... which means that, by default, FileVault logs in automatically at boot? Otherwise, the OS wouldn't be able to start. \nSo if FileVault automatically logs in to start the OS, does the encryption serve any function at all? I created a standard User to test this and was able to view all my files without entering any Administrator password – the only files I couldn't see were due to not having permission to view files from other users (which is standard protocol regardless of encryption, if I'm not mistaken). \nCan anyone explain the function of FileVault to me? I'm starting to wonder if I'm using it to serve a purpose it wasn't intended to serve.\n(For reference, I'm running macOS High Sierra)\n\nA: FileVault2 is full-disk encryption. At pre-boot you can enter the recovery partition or boot from another disk, but not your FV disk without the decryption key (derived from your password). A firmware password takes care of being able to get into recovery or other boot disks, by the way.\nThe usefulness of FV is, if someone gets ahold of your data, it's useless without that decryption key, in this case coming from your password. Now once the disk itself is unlocked, there are accounts on that disk and each one may have stronger or weaker security, but it's a different layer now. Kind of like breaking into a bank with multiple doors; the firmware is one door, the file vault is another door, then you reach the user's doors.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: dtrace/dtruss command to see what files a command tries to open?

See here: http://dtrace.org/blogs/brendan/2011/10/10/top-10-dtrace-scripts-for-mac-os-x/\nIt's been a long time since I used it; the Sierra/High Sierra equivalent is fs_usage, so maybe you have access to that too.

I have a 13\" Late 2011 MacBook Pro with the following specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*2.4 GHz Intel Core i5\n\n*4GB RAM\n\n*240GB SSD\n\n\nI just put in the SSD and did an internet recovery, which installed Lion 10.7.5.\nFrom a performance perspective, should I just leave it there? Or will I get any kind of benefits from upgrading to the latest (or a later) macOS?\nMy concern is I upgrade and then everything is much slower due to the machine not being able to handle the system requirements.\n\nA: \nFrom a performance perspective, should I just leave it there? \n\nNo.  For two reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are running a 7 year old OS that is no longer updated since about October 2014.\n\n*4GB RAM is rather inadequate considering today's use cases.\n\nOr will\n  I get any kind of benefits from upgrading to the latest (or a later)\n  macOS?\n\nThe benefits will be numerous.  The most obvious would be increased application compatibility (i.e. Office 2016 and Phoshop CC just to name two) and increased security with System Integrity Protection (SIP).  \nYour performance is mostly determined by hardware and you've already taken steps to increase speed with the addition of an SSD.  Increasing your RAM will have an immediate effect by reducing/eliminating the need for swap space.  While you SSD is amazingly fast compared to the HDD it replaced, it's still not as fast as system memory.\nYou may find this answer relevant:  My Mac is getting really slow, what should I do?\nPersonally, I have upgraded 2009, 2010 and 2011 MacBook Pros by maxing out the memory and upgrading to at least El Capitan all with excellent results.  There are no loss of performance with the upgrades.\n\nA: Every machine is a bit different, but I would say that your computer will be able to handle it, especially since Apple hasn’t marked it as obsolete yet.

I start the mac up, wait and at about 40% the loading bar stops my mouse appears for a moment (i can move it) and dissappears as a rotating transparent loading circle appears, and then it stops, the mouse cursor appears again, dissappears and the circle loading bar becomes whiter and keeps loading again, this over and over again slower and slower. When i try Safe mode the same thing happens.\n\nHowever when i start the mac in recovery mode (command /R) the mac runs perfectly but then disk utility, disk verification and repair disk preferences don't do a thing when i reboot afterwards. I've also checked the file system, reset nvram and the smc and nothing happened but the screen became brighter and the boot sound got louder.\n\nI've also tried to reinstall yosemite to 10 but the same thing happened after installation, but there was no apple logo. Then when you try and reboot it, apple logo appears and the same thing happens, smd you still can get into recovery mode.\nIt was working fine until now except i couldn't update or download anything from the app store.\nI really need this so if any of you experts have any question please ask.\n\nA: Maybe you have a problem with the internal private ram used by the system so it cant’ boot up. You can try this manipulation (2 or 3 times to be sure).\nIf it doesn’t work, try booting your Mac without extensions (as explained here).\nIf it still doesn’t work maybe you can try to install macOS from the recovery partition to an external hard drive and then boot up by maintaining alt before the Apple logo. If it works maybe you have a problem with your hard drive or the partition table (GUID) and if it doesn’t work it’s most certainly a hardware problem.\n", "Q: What is rapportd and why does it want incoming network connections? I've just updated to the latest MacOS 10.13.2 and after restarting, my machine asked me to allow incoming network connections for \"rapportd\".\nAfter blocking it and checking in the firewall config, I can see that this is an executable in /usr/libexec/rapportd which was created on my machine on the 1st of December.\nThat's a day after I installed the security update 2017-001 (for the second time; autoupdate didn't seem to notice that I'd manually updated it), and I haven't installed or updated any other software recently / around that time. Google Chrome updates whenever it feels like it, so this could be related to a Chrome update (no idea when it last updated).\nThe internet suggests this is related to some banking protection program but that doesn't seem to fit here, and from a vague text-edit inspection of the binary I can see that it references /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Rapport.framework/Versions/A/Rapport (a framework created on my machine back in July and updated in October) which makes me think this is likely to be a new 1st-party OS daemon.\n\nWhat does rapportd do?\n\nA: Type man rapportd in Terminal. \nThis is the output:\nNAME\n     rapportd -- Rapport Daemon.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     Daemon that enables Phone Call Handoff and other communication features between Apple devices.\n\n     Use '/usr/libexec/rapportd -V' to get the version.\n\nLOCATION\n     /usr/libexec/rapportd\n\n\nA: From my own pain^W experience I can tell that this service is needed at least for text message forwarding (relaying) to work.\nHaving it blocked with Firewall, for e. g., puts a big bold ban on \"Text Message Forwarding\" item in iPhone's settings.

The man page states that it is a:\nDaemon providing support for the Rapport connectivity framework.\nChecking the code signature with codesign -dv --verbose=4 /usr/libexec/rapportd shows it is signed by Apple and in a SIP-protected location (unless you turned off SIP), this appears to be legitimate Apple software. The man page implies it's related to communication, though I've yet to find any real documentation on it.\n(Thanks to John Keates for the code-signature tip.)\n\nA: In addition to what already has been posted, /usr/libexec/rapportd is code signed by Apple and linked against a PrivateFramework (which Apple doesn't allow for others and therefore doesn't sign for others), and in a SIP-protected location.

They are each currently hooked up via DP -> Mini DP to my 2015 MBP (personal). They support HDMI.\nThe ask:\nWithout making my monitors incompatible with my 2015, I would like to be able to use one USB-C connection on my 2017 to drive both 1080P displays and charge.\nThe failed idea:\nI figured I could use the HDMI ports on my Dell monitors, hook them up to a dongle/dock and be done with it. But I can't seem to find any dongle with two HDMI outs. I found the Dell WD15 had one HDMI and one Mini DP, but evidently even using a HDMI -> mini DP and HDMI -> HDMI connectors I would only be able to mirror the two external displays.\n\nWhat is the solution here?

If you can not do this, let me know.\n\n*I appears you created a FAT formatted fourth partition labelled \"BOOTCAMP\". I do not know what procedure you used do accomplish this. However, a FAT format for this partition caused the Windows installer to incorrectly believe you have a MBR partitioning scheme.

First, delete the fourth partition. Next, select the free space.

The following procedure can be used to fix this problem.\nSince the Windows Boot Camp software can detect bootable \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" volumes, the follow instructions create such a volume. Instead of placing macOS in the volume, a third party boot manager, called rEFInd, will be substituted. This boot manager will then be configured to silently boot the macOS stored in the APFS container. Finally, macOS will be instructed to not automatically mount this new volume at startup. \nBelow are the steps. The commands need to be entered into a Terminal application window.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create the new volume.  The diskutil command, shown below, shrinks the APFS container (170000M, i.e. 170 GB) by 300 MB (169700M) and creates the new 300 MB \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" volume labeled \"Macintosh HD via rEFInd\". \nsudo diskutil ap resizeContainer disk1 169700M JHFS+ \"Macintosh HD via rEFInd\" 0\n\nAfter the command completes, restart the Mac.\n\nNote: If you get an error message which includes the phrase \"perhaps caused by APFS Snapshot usage by Time Machine\", then see the question: 200GB unused, but can't change APFS container size due to minimum requirement.\n\n\n*Download the rEFInd Boot Manager software from this SourceForge web site. Enter the following commands to install the software to the \"Macintosh HD via rEFInd\" volume.\ncd ~/Downloads/refind-bin-0.11.2\n./refind-install --ownhfs /dev/disk0s3\n\n\nNote: The error message Could not set boot device property: 0xe00002bc was expected and can be ignored.\n\n\n*Configure the TextEdit application. Open TextEdit, then navigate to the \"Preferences...\" window. Uncheck all the \"Options\", as shown below. When finished, quit TextEdit.\n\n\n*Use the command below to navigate to the folder containing the refind.conf file. \ncd \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD via rEFInd/System/Library/CoreServices\"\n\nMake a backup copy of this file.\nsudo cp refind.conf refind.conf.orignal\n\nAdd write permissions to the CoreServices folder and the refind.conf file.\nsudo  chmod  a+w  .  refind.conf\n\nOpen the file in the TextEdit application.\nopen -e refind.conf\n\n\n*Add the following lines to the end of the refind.conf file.

I am downloading AVI files from a German \"online\" video recording service. These files don't work with quicktime, but using the Elmedia video player (via app store) does the job. \nNow I would like to \"cut\" those videos (basically selecting the real content of the videos, as they always contain additional 5 minutes before/after the actual recording).\nI installed avidemux (using *brew cast install avidemux), and the tool installs. But when I open these AVI video files ... it seems that the buttons to select A/B boundaries for cutting are simply disabled. And on top of that, audio isn't in sync when avidemux is playing my AVIs - so I doubt that avidemux cutting the video would give me a correct file in the end.\nAs mentioned: quicktime refuses to play my avis,so this existing question on how to trim using quicktime doesn't help me.\nThus: are there other tools for Mac Os that work better?\n\nA: You could just put them into iMovie and trim the beginning and end and export them.\nI tried using iMovie with .avi files before posting this answer, so I know it works.\n\nA: After checking the various solutions, I guess I will stick with\n\n\n*\n\n*Elmedia video player\n\n*and ffmpeg\n\n\nIt is a bit cumbersome: as you first have to use the video player to find start/end timestamps for cutting. As soon as you got those numbers:\n ffmpeg -i IN.avi -ss 00:05:48.0 -to 01:35:10.0 -c copy OUT.avi\n\nwhere -ss gives the start time stamp and -to the end point (and because both timestamps apply to the IN stream, no manual subtraction is required). \nUsing this command, it takes about 3 seconds to reduce a 1.2 GB file to 920 MB.\nThe big advantage: just two small tools require installation + super quick time for actual cutting.\n\nA: Filmora Video Editor have a free trial and accept many input format like MP4, AVI, FLV, MKV, M4V, MOV, MPG, MPEG, VOB, DAT, TS, M2TS, WMV, ASF, DV, DIF, NUT, H264, NSV, PSP, 3GP, EVO, RM, TP, TRP, DVR-MS, etc.\nanymp4, have a free version with this features: convert MOV/MKV/AVI/WMV/FLV/VOB/SWF/M4V to MP4 and Adjust video effect, rotate, flip, add watermark, clip and merge, etc.anymp4.com/app-store/free-mp4-converter \nLast but not least FFmpeg, a free software that run via command line, you can trim or convert and save the video at the same quality\n\nA: I attempted using Ghost Cat's answer but was receiving the following error:\nCould not write header for output file #0 (incorrect codec parameters ?): Operation not permitted\n\nThis is what ended up working for me:\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -ss 00:05:42.0 -to 00:07:39.0 -c:v libx264 output.avi\n\n", "Q: Can I use the music from Clips in iMovie?

On iPhone, how do you back up only your telephone contacts and not your photos or other stuff without paying for the monthly iCloud subscription?\n\nA: Assuming you are talking about backing up through iCloud, you can exclude the data of specific apps from a backup; the Apple Support article “Manage Your iCloud Storage” explains this in more detail. I am not entirely sure, but I believe you can also exclude the photo library from this list as well, assuming you are not using iCloud Photo Library. Most apps don’t put that much data in a backup, so you should be able to stay within the limits of the free 5 GB iCloud subscription by excluding the few exceptions.\nAnother option is to not use iCloud for backup at all, as explained in the article “How to back up your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch”, you can make a backup on a Mac or Windows PC through iTunes.\n", "Q: MS Word and document Advanced Properties Where can I find document Advanced Properties on Word (ver 15) for Mac?\nThere is no such of option like File->Properties\n\nOn a PC version is under \n\nFiles -> Options -> Quick Access Toolbar -> All Commands -> Advanced\n  Document Properties\n\nbut in Mac version I don't see that kind of a command in \"All Commands\" options.\n\nA: In Office 2016 for Mac, it's File > Properties.\n\nThis window is nearly identical to the window in the link.\n\n", "Q: Is it possible to connect a 1080p Thunderbolt 3 display to a Thunderbolt 2 port? I have a Thunderbolt 3 device that is a 1080p LCD monitor. When the device is connected, System Profiler lists its monitor as using a DisplayPort connection, as well as a few USB 2 devices since this device has touch screen capabilities. It has no external power source -- it's typically powered over its Thunderbolt 3 connection when connected to an actual Thunderbolt 3 port.\nI'm wondering if it's possible for me to connect this device to a Mac with a Thunderbolt 2 port and use it as a monitor? In theory this is possible since Thunderbolt 2 supports DisplayPort and could provide more than enough bandwidth and power for a 1080p LCD monitor. It would be nice if this device's USB 2 capabilities worked as well, but not a big deal if they don't. Basically, I'm not sure any such adapter exists for this sort of thing, or if it would work for my particular needs.\nIs this possible? For example, can I use the Apple Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter + a male-to-male Thunderbolt 2 cable to accomplish this? Or maybe just a male-to-male Mini DisplayPort cable?\n\nA: No, that is not possible.

The hotspot worked fine with IOS 10.  After upgrading my iPhone to IOS 11, the personal hotspot now exhibits the following behavior: It lets one or more devices connect to the personal hotspot but will not forward DNS requests to the internet.  All web pages show \"unable to connect\".  If I had a browser open to web pages prior to connecting the computer to the iPhone's hotspot, those webpages can still be browsed because the system cached the IP address of the site's domain.\nThis happens regardless whether I connect via wireless, Bluetooth, or USB.   If I turn off the personal hotspot and turn it back on, all devices easily reconnect, but the behavior repeats: no DNS requests go through.  It does not matter whether the tethered device is a laptop, tablet or IOT device.  The behavior is the same.  \nI've done all of the usual folk-remedy \"fixes\" like restarting the phone, resetting network settings, recreating the hotspot name & password, and so forth with no change.  I've hard-coded google's DNS servers into the DNS settings of the IP4 and IP6 network settings into the laptop with no success.  \nAny point in the right direction would be appreciated.\n\nA: I have a similar problem with my Android phone, the working fix that I googled up was to edit manually APN settings and assure that \"APN type\" for APN used for data traffic reads \"default,supl,dun\". (It had been \"default,supl\")\n", "Q: How long should you wait before force shutting down your mac in case of a stuck upgrade/update? Its been a while since my macbook pro started updating, and it is stuck. \nWondering if I should shut it down or leave it a bit longer? \nThe progress bar is stuck and there is no remaining calculated ( calculating time remaining ... )\n\nA: I would wait as long as possible. When you force shut down a computer that’s in the middle of an update, you’re likely going to have to do recovery and reinstall the OS. I did hear of one case where that wasn’t necessary, but usually that’s the case.\n\nA: The length of time you should wait is proportional to the time since your last backup.\ni.e. if you backed up an hour ago, you can be as impatient as you like.\nIf it was last month, or never... more patience is warranted\n", "Q: HTML videos not playing on Sierra 10.12.6 I'm using rMBP 13\" mid-2014 and I'm NOT updating to High Sierra, but even good old Sierra is not as stable as older versions of MacOS.\nSometimes I can't play videos, I press play and nothing happens, YouTube, Vimeo, Netflix, everything is down. Usually restarting browser(s) helped and normally it happened only in one browser at a time but a few minutes ago I had to restart my Mac, because every single browser I have (Chrome, Opera, Safari, Firefox) couldn't play a thing and restarting them did nothing.\nIs it a known issue? How to fix that?\n\nA: The first thing I'd probably do is start your Mac in Safe Mode and test to see if you can play videos fine? \nBoot into Safe Mode\nFollow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fully shut down your Mac\n\n*Restart your Mac\n\n*Immediately press the Shift key and keep it down \n\n*Let go of the Shift key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice).\n\n*Take a note of what happens (i.e. can you play videos okay now?)\n\n*Exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal\n\n*Again, take a note of what happens (i.e. can you play videos okay now?)\n\n\nOnce you've booted into Safe Mode, let me know how you went and we'll go from there. Primarily we need to establish if everything works okay in Safe Mode or not. If so, we need to then establish whether videos can play okay when booting normally afterwards. \n", "Q: Manually delete unused languages from macOS Yes, I know there are apps like Monolingual, Mackeeper, iCleanLanguage etc. that can do that for me but I would feel more comfortable doing it myself if it is not too much of a hassle. How can I do that?\nAlso if there are other files I can manually delete to free up space - please let me know. \n\nA: The language files for each application are stored in\nAPPL.app/Contents/Resources/LANG.lproj\n\nRemoving them for non-standard applications is easy (especially from Terminal), for standard applications you need to disable SIP first.\nThe space gained by removing them may be small though, they use about 1.3 GB in my Applications folder with about 350 applications installed. Also you need to redo this with every upgrade. You probably gain more by removing a few unused non-standard applications.\n\nA: Like @Tom & @patrix said, doing this manually is both easy and tedious, especially when doing it with Finder.\nUsing Monolingual is quite safe in my opinion and much easier than doing it 'yourself'.\nHowever, if you want to attempt this with a commandline:\nsudo find / \\( -name *.lproj -and \\! \\( -name English.lproj -or -name en.lproj -or -name en_AU.lproj -or -name en_CA.lproj -or -name en_GB.lproj \\) \\) -exec rm -rf {} \\;\n\nThat should work, if you do not re-type it, but copy and paste it. But it is only an example: it might thoroughly break your system since some parts of applications may be non standard, have these parts code-signed also etc. It might be a good idea to modify the example to star the search not at the root level but only in /Applications.\nUsing a specialised application usually avoids breakage on that level, since most better applications for that action employ blacklists that avoid touching known problem parts. Monolingual never gave me any problems and gained significant space.\nKeep in mind that this requires more so than other actions that you have a backup ready; and in operating systems >10.10 Yosemite that SIP is disabled.\nSince it crawls all over your filesystems it will be a wise move to unmount all other volumes before hitting return on that one.\nLet me warn you once again: a specialised application for this task will be much easier on your mind: If something does go wrong you know who to blame: the developer and yourself.\nWhile removing the language files is one step to take on a space constrained filesystem, there are other steps to take, maybe preferentially. Increasing HFScompression is one, deleting seldom used applications the other possibiliy to look at.\n", "Q: Music player for iTunes library I have a music collection composed of music from my CD's and iTunes purchased music. This collection is stored in iTunes. Is there a 3rd party music player that will play this collection? If so, how does one import the iTunes music into the 3rd party player. \n\nA: most music players, you have to go into the settings and there should be a setting where you point the app to the folder where your music is stored. the same as you do in itunes settings in the advanced tab. look for that. its got to be in the settings somewhere. you could also just try to open the music app, and drag the music folder into the player screen. also the same as itunes.\n", "Q: LaunchDaemon loading but not starting I created a LaunchDaemon to automatically start a mining client when the computer boots.

I have had some errors on my laptop's hard drive. I bought an SSD and had to install Mac OS Lion from Internet Recovery. I see ads for a free Mac OS High Sierra upgrade, but it says I need Mac OS 10.8 or later (I have 10.7.x installed). How can I get back to Mac OS High Sierra?\n\nA: You should be able to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch the Mac App Store app\n\n*Select the Purchased tab\n\n*Look through your purchased items to find OS X Mountain Lion (Note: There's nothing stopping you from also selecting either OS X Mavericks or OS X El Capitan)\n\n*Now click on the Download option on the right of the listing\n\n\nThis will download the OS X installer allowing you to upgrade from OS X Lion.

I've got an iPhone 4 that has no mobile plan or phone number, but I've got a Google Voice account. I know I can use the Google Voice app to communicate over SMS, but is it possible to configure the built in Messages app to use the Google Voice number?\n\nA: in android, i know you can set the google voice, and/or hangouts(which is better version of google voice), to divert all texts to the native sms app. but i dont think you can with apple messages. they are so strict and guarding of using imessage for anything else but apple use, so i seriously doubt it. but try hangouts. its just like using a normal phone. and you can check the settings in it and see if it'll do it. yup. you can even facetime in hangouts! haha.\n", "Q: AppleScript to save current Safari window in webarchive format? Without using GUI scripting, how can I use AppleScript to tell Safari to save the current browser page to a file in webarchive format?  The following produces an error \"The document “...” could not be exported as “foo.webarchive” (where \"...\" is the title of the current web page, whatever it may be):\nset the_filepath to \"/tmp/foo.webarchive\"\ntell application \"Safari\"\n    activate\n    save document 1 in the_filepath\nend tell\n\nI've tried variations on this, such as different file name extensions (e.g., .html) to see if anything works, but an error always arises. I've tried different ways of specifying the file name, but that also produces errors (of a different kind).  I've tried using save ... as \".webarchive\" instead of the simple save above, but that produces a different error about \"document 1 doesn't understand the save message\".\nThe AppleScript dictionary for Safari 11 has this description:\nsave v : Save a document.\n  save specifier : The document(s) or window(s) to save.\n    [in file] : The file in which to save the document.\n    [as saveable file format] : The file format to use.\n\nThis implies that it should be possible to save the current web page in a specific format understood by Safari (such as, hopefully, webarchive), and that I simply haven't figured out the right syntax.\n\nA: I have created a bundled script that saves the current tab to the desktop as a webarchive. Credit to newzealandpaul for his webarchiver shell command that powers this script. You can tweak the code to fit your specific needs, but this should do what that code in your question is trying to do.\nHere is the bundled script: SaveWebarchive\nThis works with the webarchiver command bundled;\nset fileName to \"foo\"\n\ntell application \"Safari\" to set targetURL to (URL of document 1) as string\nset commandPath to POSIX path of (path to resource \"webarchiver.command\")\ndo shell script \"\" & commandPath & \" -url \" & targetURL & \" -output ~/Desktop/\" & fileName & \".webarchive\"\n\nNote that the downloaded script may have the Script Editor interface showing the Log over the entire window.\n", "Q: How to auto-copy photos taken with camera?

Sometimes I want take photos of lecture slides on the projector screen and paste them on my one note.\nSince my iPad is 12.9” large it’s weird to hold it up to take a photo.\nSo, I'll take a photo with my iPhone, copy it from the photo library then paste it on my iPad using Universal Clipboard on iOS 11.\nBut, if there were an app that automatically copied the last photo I took with my camera to Universal Clipboard, then I could directly paste it without going back to the camera app to copy the image.\nIf anyone knows of any app that has this functionality, let me know.\nThanks\n\nA: This can all be done in OneNote without having to copy paste. However, this requires a Microsoft account to sync.  Be sure to install OneNote also on your iPhone.\nTransfer photos to a note\n\n\n*\n\n*Open OneNote on the iPad, open a note or create a new one.\n\n*Open OneNote on the iPhone, navigate to the same note.\n\n*Keep both open during the lecture.\n\n*On the phone when it is time to snap a photo, tap on the note were you wish to insert the photo.\n\n*There is a camera icon above the virtual keyboard - Take photo.\n\n*Tap the check mark to accept [Top right of screen].\n\n*The photo will automatically appear in the note on the iPad.\n\n\nViola!\nCamera Icon location in OneNote for iPhone:\n\n\nTake Photo Dialog:\n\nInserted photo on iPhone:\n\nUpdated automatically to iPad [note the time stamp on the note is the same as on iPhone]:\n\n\nA: not sure if it works the same on ios, but google keep is pretty awesome. it syncs across all devices. saves links, webpages, pictures, text, pretty much everything. so you could start a note on your ipad, save it, and as soon as you save it, it should show up on your phone, where you can easily add a photo to it. save it, and go back to the ipad. and by the way, saving it just means you hit the back arrow and go back to the main page of keep. and all you have to do to get back to that same note is just click on it again. oh, and i never used it, but i hear evernote is good.\n\nA: The other answers suggest using a built in \"take a photo\" in an app that also supports syncing. This is a smart way to do it. I'll also mention Bear, which is not free like Evernote, but relatively cheap and also supports this workflow.\n\nTo give more options for people who maybe don't want to do it that way for some reason... I did want to mention Workflow app, which would get you at least some of the way there no matter what apps you use (maybe).\nYou could make a workflow consisting of these actions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Take photo\n\n*Share\n\n\n*\n\n*The workflow would look something like this\nWhen the workflow runs, it opens the camera, waits for you to take a photo and then moves on to this screen\nFrom there, you could do many things: Copy to clipboard, save the image, upload to dropbox, airdop, add to various applications, etc. \nThe Share action was just a broader example... Some of the things you can do from that Share prompt, exist as actions in the Workflow app. Which means it's more automatic (or fully... it kind off depends) and you can chain them. \nAs an example, there is \"Save File\" action that you can use to save straight to Dropbox and iCloud Drive (which means you could even chain it and upload to both of them). \n\nAs it is, the workflow doesn't copy the photo to the clipboard or save it in the photos, but those actions could be added into the workflow. \nThose two actions go by names: \"Copy to Clipboard\" and \"Save to Photo Album\". I've not used it, but these pre-made workflows say it supports universal clipboard..\n\n\nThe workflow could be triggered via:\n\n\n*\n\n*Today widget\n\n*Home screen\n", "Q: Disk Utility in High Sierra 10.13.1 partitioning fail Before moving to Mac Sierra, main media disk was portioned in two volumes;\nMain with OS space 200GB, Subsidiary with 800 GB.\nI wanted to delete the subsidiary to merge it again with the Main, and then resize the Main to 400GB, and the remaining 600GB to a new volume.\nIt didn't work:\nmain stayed, the previous Sub volume of 600 disappeared completely and was in hidden modus added to the Recovery HD.\nNow we have the following status:\niMacvanFreddy2:~ freddyvandercruyssen$ diskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            201.2 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             798.8 GB   disk0s3\n\n/dev/disk1 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *15.5 GB    disk1\n   1:                       0xEF                         4.1 MB     disk1s2\n\n/dev/disk2 (disk image):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        +536.9 MB   disk2\n   1:        Apple_partition_map                         32.3 KB    disk2s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS StellarPartitionManager 536.9 MB   disk2s2\n\ndiskutil list\n/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0\n   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            201.2 GB   disk0s2\n   3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             798.8 GB   disk0s3\n\n/dev/disk1 (external, physical):\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *15.5 GB    disk1\n   1:                       0xEF                         4.1 MB     disk1s2\n\nwhat commands to enter to resize the HD recovery disk, and to regain the rest of the volume in a new part\n\nA: You have to remove the recovery partition - it's probably broken; at least it's consuming 80% of your disk.

Obviously, the sender could have done me a favor by compressing the files before sharing. But not everyone takes the time or even knows how to.\nTo save space in my inbox, I can either delete the message or if I'd like to keep it for later reference I can (with the message selected) click on \"Message\" in the menu bar followed by \"Remove attachments\".\n\nHowever, what if I'd like to keep a compressed version of the files for later reference as well? Is there some way to do this?\n\nA: Within mail? No. You'd have to create a filing system outside mail and drag your attachments into that.\nIf you do that I recommend dragging the email into that too, otherwise later you'll lose the context. Also, that makes it easier to search for what you're looking for.\nRemember: file with easy retrieval in mind. Assume you won't be sure exactly what you need, when you filed/received it, who sent it and where you filed it. In other words, try to lose all context that gives the file any meaning now and build that meaning and context into the filing system. If you can figure out what would make it easy for you to find that file in those circumstances, you're off to a good start.\n\nA: if you download the file to a folder, right click on it, and there should be an option to compress it. if it doesnt give that option, make sure you have an app installed that does some kind of compression. i have an app installed called \"the unarchiver\". so maybe thats why it shows up on right click. but i think mac has built in zip software. \n", "Q: How to backup Time Machine's backup to a cloud? I want to make any possibility of losing files on my Mac completely obsolete.\nTime Machine is awesome, but saving files to single physical hard drive is, well, not safe at all. So, I guess, what I need is to back up Time Machine's backup to a cloud and make sure that my files are being stored in more than one copy in different locations. Then possibility of losing files is too insignificant to bother ever.\nAnd the second thing is encryption. Time Machine backups are not encrypted! Why, Apple? So, I need to encrypt it before saving to the cloud. This, probably, makes it even more complicated, as now i have one huge file instead of bunch of smaller independently synched files.\nAre there ready-to-use solutions? This problem seems quite important, so probably it's solved already, right? Though, I haven't found anything.\nAmong possible solutions, i see this one:\nBackup data to a Time Capsule and backup Time Capsule to Google Cloud Storage using Syncovery, as suggested here. Though, I'm not sure how easy it will be to setup backing up from Capsule to the cloud.\n\nA: You should use multiple levels of backups, not a series of backups.\nThe difference being with a \"series\" of backups (backup of a backup of a backup etc.) you run the risk of backing up garbage if there is a failure making subsequent backups worthless (think of a failed bulb in a string of Christmas tree lights).\nIt's also important to note that backup is a strategy, not a product you buy.\nHaving multiple levels of backups works by taking different paths to securing your data.  The key here to recovery is to not get your system back up and running, but being able to get back working as quickly as possible.\nTo illustrate the difference and the usefulness of this strategy, think about what you would do if something catastrophic happened (your Mac physically blew up) and you couldn't get another Mac for a week, but had access to a PC.\n\n*\n\n*Time Machine backup for the whole system\n\n\n*Documents & Data\n\n\n*Replicated to on site NAS\n\n\n*Synced with OneDrive cloud service\n\n\n*Application settings (Preferences, templates, etc.)\n\n\n*Synced to iCloud drive\n\n\n*Replicated to on site NAS\n\n\n*Synced with OneDrive cloud service\nAs for the NAS, (I personally) use one with a with RAID one for hard drive redundancy with multiple USB hard drives for backing that up.   How is this configured?\n\n*\n\n*NAS with RAID HDDs\n\n*\n\n*USB backup for whole system\n\n*USB backup for incremental daily backups\n\n*Synchronization with additional cloud service (OneDrive, DropBox)\n\n\n\nWhat does all of this accomplish?\nLet's take a look at a single document (maybe a payroll spreadsheet):\nDocument -> Time Machine\n         -> Sync to OneDrive\n         -> NAS -> RAID Array\n                -> NAS backup to USB drive\n                -> Selected volume backup to USB drive\n                -> Selected volume sync to OneDrive\n               \n\nWhat this means is that your document is in many places with three different paths minimizing the chance of data loss if any one path fails. Also, by not depending on Time Machine as the only backup strategy, you can get back working if you are in a situation where you have no access to an equivalent or newer Mac.\nDoes this work?\nAbsolutely.  I run at least 3 VMs on my iMac and when the spinning hard drive crashed, I had everything back up and running on a PC that I had in the garage within 30 minutes; I didn't have to rush obtaining the replacement parts.\nCould I have used dedicated for pay services?  Certainly, but if you depend only on what's out of the box with these services and not strategically implement their services, you may end up with backups of data that are of no use.\n\nA: Don't backup a backup. It's not only complex at times, it also assumes that backup is a good one, which you shouldn't assume.\nI like to follow the 3-2-1 guideline: 3 backups, 2 media, 1 (at least) off-site.\nThis kind of falls under the \"3 backups\" category. If you have time machine, find a different backup format to store things in.\nSome options: you could look into traditional Linux-style backups, with utilities such as dd or tar. I personally recommend Carbon Copy Cloner (here: http://www.bombich.com/); some people prefer SuperDuper! (here: https://shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html) more.\nThere's also cloud backup solutions like CrashPlan (here: https://www.crashplan.com/en-us/business/) or BackBlaze (here: https://www.backblaze.com).\nYou can combine them sometimes too; going back to the more traditional Linux style, there's a service called tarsnap (here: https://www.tarsnap.com) which accepts backups in the tar format.\nOnline backup services typically cost $10-$20/mo, whereas software like Carbon Copy Cloner and SuperDuper! cost a one-time fee for a license, and the software is used to create the backup (and update it periodically) onto a local hard-drive.  I highly recommend having two hard-drives that you rotate as often as you can, and one of them is stored offsite.\n\nA: Allan's answer is a very good one.\nA less complicated option is just to have three separate backup drives, connecting two at any time.  Keep one somewhere else, and periodically rotate.  If one drive fails, you still have two.  If the house burns down, you still have the remote one.\nI have been considering using a one-TB cloud service to keep a sync of /Users but haven't actually tried it yet.  Might not work, since some of the directories in ~/Library are SIP-protected.\n", "Q: Keyboard Layout after startup reverts to \"ABC - Extended\" when using FileVault I am an ordinary QWERTZ keyboard user.

Thanks for the help!\n\nA: if you want them to be safe for sure, just drag them into a new folder. but i dont thing it will erase them, because they are stored in icloud, and when you stop them on the iphone, it asks if you want to delete them, and i would imagine it would also ask on your MBP if you decided to stop syncing them. so to be clear, dont delete them by hand on your phone. go to icloud, where it lets you pick what to sync, and turn off photostream. it will ask if you want to keep photos on your device or delete them. it will delete on your phone but not in icloud. case in point, i just reset and deleted everything on my phone to get ready to sell, and all of my photostream pics are still in tact on my MBP. so that would make sense. \n", "Q: Mac often wouldn't sleep nor show screensaver If I manually &Lt;Menu → Sleep&Gt; or &Lt;Screensaver settings → Preview&Gt; it will work, but it wouldn't do sleep/screensaver with the set hotcorner nor automatically.\nEvery now and then I'll have this issue.

(Older/slower machines) I have an old Mac, where if an App take some time to load (slow HD), the spindump kicks in, completely disabling the machine for close to 10 minutes.\nThere is one post on the web warning that killing spindump can cause some corruption, so, better safe then sorry.\nWould be great if there was a way to not run spindump on specific Apps, or give them more time before declaring them as 'unresponsive', but I doubt there is.\nIs it safe to just kill the process? Is there a safer way (like asking its parent to to so)?  \n\nMinor update:\nSeems that the same App that triggered the spindump, no longer does so. It still takes the same time to load, but that no longer triggers spindump.\nIf you're in a similar situation, it does quiet down eventually (as apposed to launch on every stall). It has happened about 3-4 times (one for each spinning ball), each time it took around 3-8 minutes to calm down and release the RAM.\n\nA: If you have a backup of the Mac and know you can restore / reinstall and not lose data - sure kill spindump and see if it helps. Killing apps usually just corrupts the files it writes to and spindump just writes diagnostic logs, so it's about one of the safest things you could choose to kill abruptly on the Mac.\nSince spindump is there to report on badly performing programs, perhaps looking at the logs or just not using the app that triggers it would be the way to go. here is an expert explanation that both the tailspin and spindump processes need to be removed. Keep in mind, this removal may only lasts only until the next macOS update gets applied.\nThis concludes the \"I know my Mac is slow - can I disable spindump entirely or cause it to run and exit in 10 seconds.\" scenario since I can see an app that performs so badly, that it forever will queue up a new spindump process or have spindump never reach the point where it thinks your Mac is healthy enough to stop collecting signs of a temporary problem.\nIn almost all cases - high frequency / count of spin samples is a reason to hunt down these slow processes and setups and look for long term solutions. In your case, a slow HD is a likely sign that it's relocating blocks and about to fail, so I would make plans to be sure your data is protected - when the spinning drive fails it could be costly (several hundreds of dollars) to recover.\n\n*\n\n*Be sure you have a backup\n\n*Be sure your volume is journaled to minimize repair or rebuild time if killing an app causes file loss or interrupts a write\n\n*Start removing or triaging bad apps and take notes on what works and what doesn’t to reduce spin events.\n\n\nA: It's probably safe to even disable them if you are not interested in the generated system analytics. Full procedure to do so is documented on Disable tailspind and spindump to Speed Up your Mac. In a nutshell:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable SIP\n\n*Unload/rename LaunchDaemon for spindump\nsudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.spindump.plist\nsudo mv /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.spindump.plist{,.bak} \n\n\n*Do the same for com.apple.tailspind.plist\n\n*Enable SIP\n\n\nYou probably need to redo this with each macOS update.\n\nA: For Big Sur [Beta] the trick seems to be\nsudo launchctl disable system/com.apple.spindump\nsudo launchctl disable system/com.apple.tailspind\n\nAccording to the comments on that MacObserver post and on this Reddit post: https://old.reddit.com/r/MacOSBeta/comments/hqeak2/tailspind_and_spindump_cpu_usage_and_workarounds/\n\nA: First, I think disabling those routines is a temporary fix. When I ran Activity Monitor I saw that spinddump and tailspind were taking up a fair amount of CPU time, as measured by elapsed time run. I did the removal as documented below, but the machine still wasn’t running like I thought it should. Mail was crashing, safari took too long to load, and other things. So I set up a second time machine backup overnight, and with two backups on separate physical drives went ahead with a restart in Recovery Mode, did a disk reformat of the main drive, did a new install of the OS, then imported user files from one of the Time Machine backups. Now all is good. Even though Spindump and tailspind were reinstalled they don’t run anymore and things are running like they should. All that said, disabling spindump and tailspind so you can get functional enough to make a second Time machine backup and do a clean install may make a lot of sense for you.\nThe above are great answers. I'm adding this because people coming here who are running Catalina need some additional steps found online but with some effort.\nWith Catalina parts of the system have become readonly even for root, so a couple of extra steps are needed. The steps are to Disable SIP, remount /, killall Finder, turn off and rename spindump and tailspind, reenable SIP.\nFirst, follow Dave Hamilton's great explanation of turning off SIP found in his great spindump/tailspind writeup, then substiture the following instead of his instructions on doing the plist modifications:\nsudo su\nlaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.spindump.plist\nlaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.tailspind.plist\nmount -uw /\nkillall Finder\ncd /System/Library/LaunchDaemons\nmv com.apple.spindump.plist com.apple.spindump.plist.bak\nmv com.apple.tailspind.plist com.apple.tailspind.plist.bak\n\nGo back to Dave Hamilton's description and enable SIP.\nI already contacted Dave Hamilton, and he appreciated the note that he needs to update is nice writeup to deal with the change Catalina brought.\nMy mac went from unusable to near normal with these changes.  I'm running a Mac mini (Late 2014) 2.6 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5 with 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3. After the initial improvement there were still problems, so, as I explained above, I did a clean install first having two backups on separate physical drives. My conclusion is that if you are at the point of seeing tailspind and spindump running a lot you may need to consider doing a clean install of the OS.\n", "Q: Search directory of .psd files for specific text? I have a directory of hundreds of Photoshop files (.psd) and need to locate files by searching for a string of text that exists within a file.\nUsing Finder to search for \"Contents\" doesn't seem to work.\nIs there an app to accomplish this?\n\nA: I have no idea if this will work because I don't know how PSD files store text, but try this. Open terminal (applications/utilities), type cd <space> and drag the folder containing PSDs onto the terminal; the folder path will be filled in. Hit enter. You are now \"in\" that folder in your terminal.\nNext, do grep -i \"some string here\" *.\ncd tells the system to change directory. grep is a command line utility that opens a file and searches for a string. -i is a flag that tells grep to ignore case sensitivity.

Before the update I had about 30 GB of space lost. But after the update it seems that some of the disk space is \"lost\" or got filled with some random crap.\nThis is a screenshot that shows the information about my Macintosh HD (the text is in german):\n\nAs you can see the overview tells me, that there are about 28.38 GB free space with the information, that 21.36 GB can be deleted.\nSo my first question is what can be deleted? After some googling I found out, that these are files that were not really needed because they can be downloaded or found somewhere in the cloud. But at the moment it's not clear to me which files are really meant.\nI first recognized the problem when I wanted to download the latest version of Xcode and the AppStore.app told me that there is not enough disk space and I've to clean up my disk.\nI've then also checked the complete usage of my disk:\n\nAs you also can see, the app shows me that the system requires about 88.14 GB disk space, which cuts me really off. For what is this disk space needed?\nI've checked my personal data and as you can see I've only a few programs installed and the needed disk space of my personal data is also really low:\n\n\nThe most space is taken by all the developer tools. My personal data like images, etc. were stored on a SD card.\nWhen I run df -h in iTerm2 it tells me that in fact only 6.4 GB are left on my disk and it also shows me that there are many TimeMachine backup snapshots left on my disk. Normally TimeMachine stores the backups on an external usb hard drive:\n\nSo my question is, how can I get my disk space back and why is the system using so much space?\n\nA: I had a similar problem. I ran 'dd' to fill up the SSD and then deleted the files afterwards:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/zero.1.out bs=1048576 count=10240\nI created a few of those (10GB each and some larger - 30 GB) until the SSD was nearly 100% full.\nI then deleted the files with: rm /tmp/zero.*.out\nFinally: df -h /\nnow reports the correct allocation with one oddity:\nifree read 9223372036854041010 which seems incorrect.\nDisk Utility (First Aid) was not picking up any issue although the reported available space was clearly off by 50 GB (almost 50% of the entire capacity of my SSD partition).\nHope this helps.\n\nA: The first step in disk space questions is to power down the mac and then restart to another OS (bootable installer, internet recovery, recovery HD) and run Disk Utility. This verifies that the accounting is correct and you have good foundation to then remeasure and then take action.\nIn your case - the snapshots don't take any substantial space since that is all added up in the white diagonal line shaded part. A small fraction and you can get that exact value hovering your mouse over it just to the left of the white space on the right.\nNext - system allocation in yellow covers all the user data for other users on the Mac - you might need to log in to each user one by one to pick apart how much space each user's home folder takes or resort to a tool like DaisyDisk to really read as an administrator how much space is in each home folder.\nApple's tools work well in many situations, but yours not so much. You did all the things proper in looking at app sizes, user data, etc..\nNext steps for you is to use Finder and turn on Calculate all sizes in the View menu - Show View Options - Command + J \n\nThen start taking note of which folders on the computer are large and diving in to them. \nOr get a third party tool. \nOr use some command line options like ncdu or just du and appropriate invocation of admin/root privileges using sudo du\n\nA: I have same problem. I would get the app DaisyDisk and run it on your Mac. It displays an image map of your disk drive and makes it very easy to spot which folders/fines are taking up so much space. I ran it and found out my system folder was only 9 GB, not 89. The app is available from the app store for $9.99. If you go to their website, here they have a free trial app. \nThere is a similar app, GrandPerspective, which is free.\n", "Q: How to merge two partitions on external hard drive when the \"partition\" option is greyed out?

Choose any of the two disk names, like:\n diskutil list MacBackup\n\nThis returns something like\n   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *320.1 GB   disk3\n   1:                 DOS_FAT_32 MULTIMEDIA              160.0 GB   disk3s1\n   2:                  Apple_HFS TIMEMACHINE             160.0 GB   disk3s2\n\nIn the IDENTIFIER column, get the disk identifiers for both disks, here: disk3s1 and disk3s2\n\n\n*merge the two disk partitions by \"mergePartitions  [format] [new disk name][disk identifier 1]  [disk identifier 2]\". If you want to use the \"MacBackup3\", you would then enter:\ndiskutil mergePartitions JHFS+ MyMedia disk3s1 disk3s2\n\nThe first disk [disk identifier 1] is the only one that diskutil tries to preserve the data for. If it can't because the disk has no resizable data format, it will give a warning message:\nThe chosen disk does not support resizing.\nDo you wish to format instead? (y/N)\n\nCaution! If you enter \"y\", your data on [disk identifier 1] will be deleted. This is the last chance to abort by \"N\".

How do I erase the data on my phone this way? Thanks. \n\nA: It's sad you learned a lesson the hard way.\nBecause the phone had no passcode, the thief (or anyone else who happens upon it) can see contacts, photos etc. When you get a new phone, it is highly advised that you add a passcode. The time and inconvenience of unlocking when you use the phone is worth the security. \nAs for the stolen device, It is recommended that you should at least change your Apple ID password.  Instructions can be found here at Apple Support.  I is unlikely that the thief will guess your old password, but if the current password is weak or can be easily guessed (or worse, you have it plain to see in the Notes app) he could do even more damage to your personal data.  If you have any other Apple device that uses your Apple ID this could be a serious problem.  He could even purchase apps at your expense, change the password himself and lock you out.\nIf you are still concerned and you have your original proof of purchase, a call to Apple Support may be an option.\n", "Q: Macbook air won't turn on So the apple service nearby told me I have to replace the motherboard. But sometimes my macbook could back normal. Yesterday after being kept in my backpack for hours outside in a sunny day, my laptop was so warm and I pressed the power button and it turned on! Now after being turned off and kept in the air con room it went dead again. If anyone knows how to fix it please help\n\nA: it sounds like a hardware problem that Apple has diagnosed for you.  The way to fix it is to get a new logic board as they suggested, or a new machine.  The only other way to fix a hardware issue is to find someone with a reflow station and serious hardware skills, but that's beyond the scope of this website!\n", "Q: Could not create a Preboot Volume for APFS install So I have this issue when trying to reinstall macOS in the recovery, but when I tried to reinstall \"Could not create a preboot volume for APFS install\" comes up.\nI came across this solution which requires you to completely wipe your drive but I don't want to do that since that would mean my BootCamp installation would also have to be gone.\nIs there a way to fix this issue without completely wiping my disk?\n\nA: If somebody face the same issue please consider to visit this link.  https://www.belightsoft.com/products/resources/apfs-bootable-clone-with-command-line\nI faced this issue when i converted HPS+ to APFS manually via DiskUtil.

I have an iTunes Store account which has all my purchases over about ten years. For reasons we won’t go into, this isn’t my iCloud/Apple ID account I use for everything else at Apple. So I have signed into iCloud with my @me account on all my devices, but I always have this separate account signed in to App Store, iTunes Store, and Apple Music.\nI want to be able to activate Family Sharing on the former account, so my family can view my purchases. I can’t seem to find a way to start this process from anywhere other than the iCloud menu.\nIs there a way I can set up Family Sharing without signing into/using iCloud?\n\nA: There are many people [including me] in this situation. Usually because the original iTunes account was set up before iCloud existed, so the email address is not an Apple address.  \nThis, in itself, doesn't make it any different to any other iCloud account & you can treat them in the same way.\nSet up Family Sharing on your current @me account & set that as family organiser. Send an invite to the other @dot.com account as another adult, & the same for the rest of your family [adult/child as appropriate]\nPurchases will then be available to all members.\nI have a recollection of, when trying to send the invite to my own @dot.com from @me, that the rescue/recovery address couldn't be the same, or the invite would never arrive. I remember having to temporarily juggle the addresses until I'd got it working, then change them back.\n", "Q: Why is my 2010 MacBook Pro not detecting RAM? I recently acquired a 2010 13\" MacBook Pro. The computer beeps every 5 seconds (indicating no RAM is installed). I have tried installing four different compatible SODIMMs in both slots but nothing works. None of the slots work! Because both slots are not functional, the computer is useless. What could be causing the problem? What part of the slot might be damaged? I have tried adjusting the four screws surrounding the RAM slot with no luck. Suggestions?\nFar fetched but has anyone had success with reflowing the RAM slot?\n\nA: Verify that all the RAM you're trying is actually good, by installing each the SODIMMs in another machine. If the RAM is recognized, then it's OK.\nIf the RAM is good, then the memory modules are not being electrically connected to the motherboard in the Macbook (either because of a RAM socket problem, or a bad electrical connection(s) between the socket and the board), or there might be a failure within the electronics on the board.\nIf the RAM is good, the repair sounds like something that'd require professional attention. The Macbook may be considered \"Vintage\" or \"Obsolete\" by Apple; more information is on Apple's page here. If the machine is Vintage or Obsolete, Apple may decline to repair it and may further decline to provide replacement parts. \nHowever, you may be able to find a non-Apple service provider who can examine and perhaps repair the fault(s), as repair may require no parts, or parts which can be sourced other than from Apple.\n\nA: If you have a working screen, clean housing and working keyboard, it may be worthwhile to replace the motherboard as 2010 units with broken screens are available for very little money at this point. I've replaced 2011 motherboards, screens and keyboards affordably and am still using my 2011 17\" matte as my primary road warrior.\n", "Q: Is there an app to control preferences/desktop/dock based on an environment I use my laptop for personal use and work.

It shows only one fan.\n\n\nA: Found some photos of disassembled MBP 2016 (13\") on the internet.\nLooks like there is only one fan so I should not worry.\n\n\nA: You should get the app Temperature Gauge which will display the temperature of different parts of your Mac. It also gives the fan speed of all the fans. \nThere is also an app Macs Fan Control which lets you manually control the fans speed. Maybe changing fan speed will enable it to work normally if malfunctioning.\n", "Q: Should I ignore this disk error?

So should I worry or should I do something about it?\nAny ideas?\nEDIT: Thanks for all your answers but I don't know how but the problem has fixed itself:\n\n\nA: You should never ignore disk errors. Assume it's dying; make backups, you can never have too many. I use time machine and carbon copy cloner, but do what suits you. I also use disk warrior sometimes to buy some time if I think a disk is going. But don't kid yourself, that drive is probably not healthy and it wouldn't be good to fool yourself into thinking everything will be fine. It may be, but it also may not be; if you have important files, act accordingly, and while hoping for the best, plan for the worst.\n", "Q: Disable HiDPI resolution My macOS High Sierra install keeps switching to 720p HiDPI in stead of running at the native 1440p.\nWhen I click on the 1440p setting it shows me the correct res but it switches back after about 1 second.\nWhen I reboot my Mac I also log in with the correct res but it changes to HiDPI after ~5 seconds.\nThe monitor is from Asus, 27\" 2560x1440.\nI tried changing the res with SwitchResX and jhford's screenresolution utility.\n\n\nA: I found a way to disable this behaviour through the this command:\nsudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver DisplayResolutionEnabled -bool NO\n\nA: If it's a VMWare one, when its active go to VM/settings/display/ then uncheck the \"Automaticaly adjust user interface in the virtual machine\" setting.\n\nA: high sierra gives you the option to let the system switch between the two gpu's automatically depending on what it decides is the right one for the situation. you can disable this by going to system preferences - then to energy saver. in the top left corner is a box you can tick or untick with the option to let high sierra decide to use automatic graphics switching or not. hope that helps. \n", "Q: Move to a larger drive My wife got me an external SSD for my bday.

I'd like to move to the new drive and use the old one for backups.\nGiven that the original user folder is not on a boot drive, can I simply copy the contents over? Is there anything else I need to do, like set the permission or anything?\nMost guides say you should do this with Restore in DU, but the Restore... menu items is greyed out when I tried it.\n\nA: I'm not sure about if you can just copy over. Why is your user folder on a separate drive?? Anyway. I do have another suggestion. I got an ssd drive to use for my main drive, cause it's like ten times faster. I then ordered this thing that is basically the same shape as a cd Rom drive, but it holds a laptop hard drive. I removed the cd Rom drive and replaced it with that, which holds a terabyte drive. I partitioned it in half. 500gb is for my time machine backup, and the other 500gb is for extra storage. Or \"external\", without being external.

Alternatively, look at the source code and write some 20 lines of Qt code using the same approach.\nProof of concept in PyQt5:\nfrom PyQt5 import QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets\napp = QtWidgets.QApplication([])\nw = QtWidgets.QWidget()\nw.setWindowTitle('Textbox to image')\nfont = QtGui.QFont()\nfont.setFamily(\"Herculanum\")\nfont.setBold(True)\ntextbox = QtWidgets.QTextEdit(w)\ntextbox.setFont(font)\ntextbox.resize(280, 40)\ntextbox.setText(\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr\")\ntextbox.grab().save(\"image.png\")\n\nResult (png):\n\nThat, with custom distortion is how I actually created a large ML dataset for OCR from custom fonts.\n", "Q: How to restore Quick Look for plain text .txt files? I was recently installing/uninstalling/re-installing some third-party Quick Look extensions (brew cask install qlstephen among others).  When all the dust had settled everything worked well except Quick Look for .txt files no longer works (I get the default Dear Kate letter).  Quick Look for .rtf files works fine.\nBy the way, the qlstephen extension is working OK for files without file extensions.  I suspect that problem arose during the uninstalling/re-installing of everything.  I'm running High Sierra.\nAny suggestions for getting Quick Look working for plain text .txt files?\n\nA: To see what application can handle a Quick Look view try in the terminal: qlmanage -m plugins.  \nThis will show a list in the form filetype -> provider, where filetype is in the form com.company-name.filetype like com.apple.mail.email.\nThe filetype-part shows the full path to the Quick Look plugin.  \nSo in total it shows a line like\ncom.apple.mail.email -> /System/Library/QuickLook/Mail.qlgenerator (3445.5.20)\n\nThis shows that email is handled by the Mail.qlgenerator.\nYou can filter the long list down with grep:\n\n\n*\n\n*text files: qlmanage -m plugins | grep -i \"text\"\n\n*plain text files: qlmanage -m plugins | grep -i \"plain-text\"\nIt is possible that more than one generator is available for a particular filetype.\nAccording to qlmanage -h there is the -g option:\n-g generator    Force the generator to use\n\nThe general usage of qlmanage is qlmanage [OPTIONS] path...\nHowever I've never used this -g option.\n\nA: The solution that actually worked for me without uninstalling QLColorCode was to re-install highlight :\n\nbrew reinstall highlight\n\nI got a lead on this issue : No preview of file content just an icon...\n", "Q: The iPhone cannot be backed because there is not enough iCloud Storage for that Where can I determine what apps make the incredible size of backup?\n\nAs you can see there is almost 30GB free space, but I cannot perform a backup because there is not enough space on iCloud.

You can then check how big the backup is. I noted you have 128GB on your phone. If only a fraction of that is used it could be a lot. After your backup, you can reduce your icloud storage back to 50 GB to end the $1 per month charge. \n\nA: To determine what is being backed-up to iCloud:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the screen shown in the question, [Settings > Apple ID, iCloud > iCloud]\n\n*Tap Manage Storage\n\n*Scroll down to Backup and tap\n\n*Select the desired device from the list [iPhone]\n\n*Give the phone time to calculate the sizes of the backups\n\n\nFrom there you can see what Apps are backing up data from the largest to the smallest backup size.\n", "Q: Mac Sleep Wake Failure I've got an iMac running High Sierra, and over the last couple of months it has developed a problem where it spontaneously reboots itself about once a day.\nThe reboots always occur when the iMac is asleep and the pattern is always the same.

As a first try at AppleScript I'm looking to automate a find command and some follow actions that would normally be user input.\nUltimately I want to automate adding lyrics to my iTunes library.  My first challenge is to tell Safari to search a webpage for a phrase, click on the link, and then copy the plain text on the page that comes up to the clipboard and then paste it into Text Editor.  \nI'm not sure how to tell Safari to command + F, paste a phrase from the clipboard, and then \"click\" the highlighted link.  \nI don't need a full script, but help getting started at a minimum\nHow would I do one or more parts of this automation?  \n\nA: Your first AppleScript!  Amazing...  And an ambitious project to start with, but I can see its value.\nMy answer won't write the script for you, but I will give you tips about how to approach your problem differently and achieve what you want a little more easily.\nTo answer your specific queries first:\nTelling Safari to Cmd-F\n    tell application \"Safari\" to activate\n\n    tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"f\" using command down\n\nPaste a Phrase From Clipboard\nSend a Cmd-V.  You might need a small delay between the two keystroke commands.\n\"Click\" the Highlighted Link\nYou can't.  You won't be able to identify what's highlighted via a Cmd-F search with any great ease (possibly through GUI scripting, but that'll be a mess).  I'll come back to this shortly.\nA Different Approach\nWorking backwards, let's assume you've obtained the text you need to paste into TextEdit.  Don't paste it.  Set the contents of a new TextEdit document to the contents of the clipboard:\n    tell application \"TextEdit\" to set text of (make document) to the clipboard\n\nIn order to set the clipboard to the contents of a Safari web page, use this command:\n    tell application \"Safari\" to set the clipboard to  ¬\n        (text of current tab of front window) as string\n\nAnd this brings us back to clicking on the link...\nIf you literally want to click a link on a webpage, one method would be to make sure Allow Javascript from Apple Events is checked in Safari's Develop menu, and run a do JavaScript to pick out the link containing the relevant search item and click it:\n    tell application \"Safari\" to tell document 1 to do JavaScript ¬\n        \"Array.from(document.links).find(a => a.href.includes(\\\"cjk\\\")).click()\"\n\nThis only finds the first instance of the search time, which I have inferred is sufficient given that your method of doing a Cmd+F search seemed content to accept the first occurrence as the only one of importance.\nHowever, I think the whole process could be streamlined and made much more robust by using Automator to help us out.  It can extract all URLs directly from a webpage (all you have to do is feed it the URL of the webpage in question).  Then you can filter these URLs to search for specific text.  Once you have the URL you desire, instead of clicking on it, Automator can download its contents as text and insert it straight into a new TextEdit document.  I do believe that next to no AppleScript would be needed, although you can supplement it with some AppleScript to fine-tune things here and there as required.\nWithout your webpage in question, I can't devise the workflow specific to your application.  However, that would also deprive you of the joy of doing it yourself.  But using this Stack Exchange webpage as an example, the following workflow isolates the URL of your user profile (the link to which is at the bottom of the question you asked), downloads the text from your profile, and turns it into a new TextEdit document:\n\nHopefully, this is enough to get you well on your way to achieving your goal.

If so could someone explain or direct me to a resource/guide?\nI think the last time I tried to remove macOS I couldn't boot Windows anymore.\n\nA: If you make a significant hardware or software change, then Windows may fail to boot. In these cases, you need to rebuild the bcd file. The software to do this is included in the Windows installation files. So you need to boot to a Windows installer to run these commands. The procedure depends on how your Mac is configured. \nSome items to consider are given below.\n\n\n*\n\n*Does Windows boot using a legacy BIOS or the newer EFI.\n\n*Can you boot Windows from a optical drive, flash drive or other method.\n\n\nIt would be best to have a way to boot to a windows installer, before removing macOS.

The only place it will come into play is when you are transferring data files over your network.\nIf this is of concern, the answer is simple:  wired is always better.  With wired Ethernet, you're not sharing bandwidth like you would with WiFi.\nThat said, if you aren't transferring files over the network and all the work will be done locally, it won't matter if you are going WiFi or hard wire.\n(IMO) I would hard wire both my iMacs to the network and use the WiFi for convenience like your daughters' MacBooks, iPhones and iPads.

The SSD is still not visible.\nHow can I fix it?\n\nA: I find out the following solution at the end\n1) Run PRAM by holding Option+Command+P+R at boot\n2) Boot into macOS from  the original harddisk\n3) A message should appear and say there is an uninitialised harddisk\n4) Use the disk utility to format the harddisk. In my case since the OS is still at Sierra, only HFS+ options are available.\n5) Reboot and select the usb installation image of High Sierra\n6) The SSD drive is now visible to the installer. Proceed with installation.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install 2 windows under 1 mac? I don't want to use virtual machine software because of performance issues.\nSo I want to use Mac and has Mac OS. And from time to time use Windows, but I want to install 2 Windows (because I need to use 2 versions of Microsoft Office).\nDoes anyone know if it is possible with Boot Camp? Is there any other solution?\nI am considering buying the newest Mac Pro with 512 GB of internal storage.\nPS: I don't need to run these OS simultaneously, Mac == restart ==> Windows 1 ==> restart ==> Windows 2 ==> Mac will be fine.\n\nA: The answer is Yes, you can install macOS and two copies of Windows 10. They can  all be on the internal disk, but that might be a little tight with only 512 GB. This would not leave much space for your own files. I suppose if you ran out of internal space, you could add an external disk for your additional personal files. Apple's macOS can fairly easily installed on any combination of internal and/or external disks. Windows installation can vary from simple to extremely complicated.\nInstalling one copy of macOS followed by a single copy of Windows 10 on the first internal disk is fairly simple. Once macOS is installed, the Boot Camp Assistant can setup everything for Windows and the pass the installation to the Windows installer to complete the task.\nPutting two copies of Windows on the internal disk would result in the partial loss of the use of the Boot Camp Assistant. You would use the Boot Camp Assistant, followed by the Windows installer, to install the first copy of Windows 10. You would be unable to use the Boot Camp Assistant to install the second copy of Windows. This would require you to manually partition the drive. There also would be some copying of files to their initial locations. The good news is that the Windows installer can still be used to install the second copy. The procedure for the second copy would be similar to the answer to this question. The necessary changes to the procedure are itemized below.\n\n\n*\n\n*In step 11, choose the \"Recovery\" partition with the lowest number..\n\n*Before executing step 14, any \"MSR (Reserved)\" type partitions that exist after the \"WINSTALL\" partition need to be deleted. The image below is an example of such a case.\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*In step 20, choose the \"BOOTCAMP\" volume with the drive letter (Ltr) C.\n\n\nWith external installations of Windows, you loose the use of the Boot Camp Assistant and the Windows installer. You end up typing in all the commands needed to install Windows. In other words, you can run windows from external disks, you just can not use the graphical Windows installer to help you do so. An example, of one such install procedure, is given at this link.\n", "Q: Delete own user from Mac OS I was wondering if it is possible to delete my one and only user account because I am creating a script to add and remove users on my Mac.\nI have this command here:\nsudo /usr/bin/dscl . -delete \"/Users/ali\"\n\nI'm a little bit worried to test that because I don't want to delete my only user with all my files so is it possible?\n\nA: The command sudo /usr/bin/dscl . -delete \"/Users/ali\" will remove the user ali  from the local Directory Services database.\nAfter login out you won't be able to login with user ali again. The user folder of ali won't be deleted.\nTo delete the folder /Users/ali and its content an additional command is necessary.\n\nThe user ali can be recreated though by booting to single user mode and using the remove .AppleSetupDone file trick in a two-stage process.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new admin with a different name than ali (e.g. ali2)\n\n*After the configuration is done create a new admin with a different name than ali (e.g. ali3)\n\n*Logout as ali2 and login as ali3\n\n*Modify ali2 (e.g. name/user directory/user id etc.) with Users & Groups PrefPane/Directory Utility.app/command line to restore the previous entries of ali.\n\n\nThis won't work if your main volume is encrypted with FileVault2!\n\nIt's absolutely not recommended to test user creation/deletion scripts like this on your production Mac. Download VirtualBox, create a virtual machine running macOS and test your scripts inside there.\n", "Q: MacOS - Enable SSH server on different network interface I enabled \"System Preferences\" -> \"Sharing\" -> \"Remote Login\". The dialog is telling me\nTo log in to this computer remotely, type “ssh user@10.11.12.13”.\n\nAnd this works fine on the 10.x network. However, I have two network adapters in the system, and I want to connect via SSH on the other network. How do I make the SSH Server open port 22 on all network interfaces?\n\nA: I think this message should be reworked since the sshd daemon listens on all network interfaces and this just tries to show the same IP address as the default IPv4 route to the internet as one address that could be used.\nYou should be able to ssh in on all IPv6 and IPv4 addresses on the Mac irregardless of what this message says.\nUnless you've modified your sshd configuration or network firewall, this should work out of the box. If you port scan one of the addresses to find it's not listening - then check firewall before you check the ssh configuration.\nAlso, the system logs can show you that ssh is listening and processing connection attempts, but this probably is just an imprecise message causing you to worry needlessly.\n", "Q: Make Hard Drive appear as Bootcamp for Parallels Parallels Dekstop 13.0.1 BE won't let me add a Physical Internal HDD to the VM system.\nThere is a SATA HardDrive in my system with a GPT partition table and a big (2TB) NTFS partition. I use it when normally booted in a Microsoft Windows installation located in another drive. The disk contains some user files and a few apps. There is no OS installed on it. The hard drive is recognized and works as expected under macOS too.\nPlease note: macOS (10.12.6) is installed on a third disk. I also cannot update: I had to downgrade because High Sierra breaks compatibility with some stuff I have and I don't like the root login without password thingie.\nMy VM is actually a proper Windows 10 installation on an SSD which Parallels sees as Bootcamp and it works fine both natively and in the VM. In the VM settings though if I try to add a HDD it asks me what kind of drive I wish to attach. I can either create a new/use an existing virtual drive or use a \"real\" Hard Drive (Bootcamp). Problem is, only the SSD is seen as an available disk (the one with Windows installed on it) while my 2TB data disk does not appear.\nI guess that is because it's not a Bootcamp/Windows hard drive, only a common disk with some files on it. I tried moving my pre-owned license and installing Paragon NTFS on this machine. Again, the Drive works as expected, I can view/move/edit/create/delete/rename files on it but Parallels still won't let me select the drive as an additional disk for my VM?\nTL;DR and core question\nWhat can I do to make my internal disk appear as a Bootcamp hard drive (preferably without actually installing Windows on it)?\nOr, if impossible, how can I at least convince Parallels that my HDD is eligible for use as a VM drive?\n\nA: A late reply to this, hopefully you have already found a solution.\nJust because I was having a similar issue getting my Windows install on an external SSD to recognise the internal SATA drive in the iMac. For me it was because the AHCI/SATA controller would fail with an error 10 and after much testing with driver updates etc I believe I found a solution.\nThe problem for seems to be do with how the drive is formatted / partition table as whenever I do so with Disk Utility then Windows fails to load it. However this was not the case when the bootcamp partition was on the internal drive or even when Windows booted from the external drive but still had a Windows partition on the internal one.\nAs Windows setup can see the internal drive during installation then you could use this format a partition created as FAT32 in OS X, which is pretty much what Bootcamp creates. That or just use the Bootcamp Assistant to create the partition and instead of going through with installing Windows stop after the part where you format the destination as NTFS.\n", "Q: The machine is laggy and the SMC reset is not working Recently my 2015 MacBook Pro started to lag a lot, especially the graphics.

This was extremely useful for deleting all linked events from without having to hunt them down one by one. This would be required if one of the events became disassociated from the rest of the repeating events because a change had been made to it, like time of day.\nHas anyone figured out how to replace this removed \"feature\" - the debug menu?\n\nA: One out-of-the-box method is to drag the event to the desktop, creating a .ics file. When you have a QuickLook of the .ics file by pressing the space bar, a preview of the recurring event will come up with the event's start date in the title bar.\nWorks with Big Sur.\n\nA: OK!

However, after pasting in multiple elements I find that the paragraph style is different in multiple cells of the table.\nI would just set all those styles back to e.g. \"Table Style 2\", however that style is missing from the drop down menu. I can select the \"Body\" style of course, but the font size seems larger than \"Table Style 2\".\nIs there a way to reset or paste in the table style without having to copy / paste all the text?\n\nA: Text from the clipboard can be pasted without its original formatting.\nTo do so:\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the cell you wish to paste information to\n\n*From the Menu Edit > Paste and Match Style [ ⌥⇧⌘V ]\n\n\nThis will preserve the styling in the table, regardless of the style from the source copied from.\nThis will save you from having to try to restore the original table's formatting.\n\nIf you've already copy/pasted everything without regarding the style then you can create a new table and copy/paste all the elements into it using the \"Paste and Match Style\" method described above.\nYou may have to resize the table before or afterwards (if you create a smaller table then the size is adjusted automatically to the right number of rows and columns).\n", "Q: Does macOS treat input from voice dictation the same as it would from a keyboard? I have a lot of typing that I need to do and would like to use voice dictation. However, it doesn't seem to \"type\" consistently across applications.\nI've had success with the feature on a few native applications such as MS Word, gVIM and macOS Notes. I've noticed that it often will not be a consistent stream of \"typing\", rather it will sometimes burst several words out and then backspace and correct once it determines a better interpretation based on after-the-fact context. For example, if you say \"3:26 PM\" it will start bursting \"three twenty six\", backspace and replace it with \"3:26 PM\" because it eventually realized you were dictating a time of day.\nIn particular, I'm trying to use this on a Citrix Receiver session to a remote machine. It seems that the \"backspace and replacement\" adjustments it does do not make their way through to the remote session and I would see something more like \"three twenty six 3:26 PM\".\nI would suspect that it doesn't register key press events since you're not physically pressing keys, but it would appear that Citrix isn't looking at \"key PRESSES\" anyway given that some input does work. However, I am curious how exactly it is interfacing with the software expecting input? Perhaps corrections aren't simply \"backspace\" operations but more \"remove previous word\" operations that some combination of keystrokes would do?\nDoes anyone have an idea here?\n\nA: The short answer to your question is it's complicated...\nDepending on how the application was developed it might use any number of different APIs from Swift, Cocoa, Carbon.\nIf your application uses Apple's standard user interface elements like text fields, then it likely has a way to put the text directly into the field, however Apple has probably added functionality to support other software by simulating keypresses.\nHow well this is supported depends on the application developer.\nAs an example an application like Citrix likely doesn't use any standard UI elements because it's got no text box to type into, instead it shows an image of a computer and records where you click on that image, sending that to the other computer, similarly it has to record your key presses, but evidently it's not doing that very well.\nMicrosoft Word is likely a very old code base that has grown from the days of Carbon which may explain why it's not working as expected, and I don't know what gVIM but I think you mean MacVim but as it's a port from another project it may not have been tested for this properly / it's not on their list of priorities.\nFor what it's worth I have had similar issues using software like TextExpander and Dash which auto complete sentences in Terminal, and using Apple's own remote desktop software like Citrix, so I think this is to be expected.\n", "Q: Is there a way to see System Information before first user is added?

In my mind, that would lead to green-level memory usage, but would go to red every time said application did its business.\nI'd like to avoid having performance hits like these, but I'm more interested in understanding the way the OS works.

I would check for Chrome updates.\nThe reason I suspect Chrome is two-fold: one is that I have personally experienced Chrome's resource usage going off the charts, and also because in your screenshot, the 'Force Quit' dialog shows Chrome as being paused - I initially just assumed that was because it was 'the' offender, and that lined up nicely with the theory I already had about Chrome - but in retrospect it could have been not because it was 'the' offender per-se, but the next biggest user of system resources after the kernel itself.\n", "Q: Error: SHA256 mismatch with brew install I tried to install an application with homebrew:\n$ brew install poppler\n\nAnd then towards the end of the installation, I notice the following error:\n==> Downloading https://github.com/GNOME/gobject-introspection/commit/4a724ac699f0c34fba2fb452cfadea11540325e8.patch\n######################################################################## 100.0%\nError: SHA256 mismatch\nExpected: 047c350bad2d222f1037c3ce1889444ebc1095df76120188037c4eb2900848c4\nActual: 928403cf8eb092c664791f5e08cff1199ac9e945d8d5fd21c455c688efbc6dd5\nArchive: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/gobject-introspection--patch-047c350bad2d222f1037c3ce1889444ebc1095df76120188037c4eb2900848c4.patch\nTo retry an incomplete download, remove the file above.\n\nWhat happened here?

I had macOS and Windows 10 installed through Bootcamp on my Macbook Pro (late 2013) and everything worked fine.

First download the 64-bit Windows 10 iso from this Microsoft web site. This can be done while running macOS. Next you will need 16 GB or larger flash drive. For your model Mac, I believe the Boot Camp Assistant will aid in the creation of the Windows installer flash drive. If not, let me know.\n\n*If the root folder of the flash drive contains the file AutoUnattend.xml, you will need to rename the file to NoAutoUnattend.xml.\n\n*Boot to the flash drive.

Note the following regarding fdmillion's answer to this question\n\nUser fdmillion's answer requires a Mac that can BIOS boot from an USB drive. The only 2011 Macs which can BIOS boot from an USB drive are the MacBook Air and Mac mini models. No Mac models older that 2011 can BIOS boot from an USB drive.\nStaring in 2015 Apple starting omitting BIOS code from the firmware which ended the ability to BIOS boot from any type of drive.\n\n\nApple does not support Boot Camp Assistant installations of Windows 10 on 2011 and earlier iMac models. The exact list of supported Mac models is given below.\nThe following Mac models support 64-bit versions of Windows 10 when installed using Boot Camp.\n\nIf you have one of the models listed below, then you should use the Boot Camp Assistant to install Widows 10.\n\n\n*\n\n*MacBook Pro (2012 and later)\n\n*MacBook Air (2012 and later)\n\n*MacBook (2015 and later)\n\n*iMac (2012 and later)\n\n*Mac mini (2012 and later)\n\n*Mac mini Server (Late 2012)\n\n*Mac Pro (Late 2013)\n\nI have read where others have successfully used the Boot Camp Assistant to create a Windows flash drive installer. This was accomplished by first editing a .plist file contained within the Boot Camp Assistant software. I have the following problems with doing this.\n\n*\n\n*The Boot Camp Assistant software has to be hacked in order to create the Windows installer.\n\n*The resulting flash drive installer defaults to a Windows installation that uses the EFI boot method. Apple did not officially start supporting this method of booting Windows until after the 2011 model year. I have always assumed the Windows Support Software, supplied by Apple for my Mac, was designed only for the legacy BIOS boot method of installation.\n\n\nI have no problems EFI booting the USB Windows installer, but I still want to install Windows to use the BIOS boot method.\n\nHere is what I wish to accomplish.\n\n*\n\n*Install Windows 10 Pro 64 bit. I have downloaded the latest Windows 10 (Version 21H1) iso file.\n\n*Install Windows 10 into a newly formatted volume. I do not want to first install an earlier version of Windows and then upgrade to Window 10.\n\n*Boot Windows using the legacy BIOS boot method.\n\n*Use only one partition on the first internal drive (disk0) for the Windows files.  The single internal disk in my Mac uses a 512 byte sector size.\n\n*Install Windows using the latest version of macOS. Currently, this would be High Sierra (macOS 10.13.6).\n\nI would desire to preform the installation without any of the following.\n\n*\n\n*No third party software\n\n*No optical (DVD) drive\n\n*No Boot Camp Assistant\n\n*Without disabling System Integrity Protection (SIP).\n\nI would prefer not having to boot to macOS Recovery via the internet, built-in recovery or an USB flash drive macOS installer. But, since macOS Recovery is not a third party tool, I am not opposed to its use.\n\nA: Installing Windows 10 without DVD or Third Party Tools\n\nNote: This version of my answer uses the 21H1 version of Windows 10. The previous version of this answer, which used the 1709 version of Windows 10, can be found here. Also, if installing the 1903 version of Windows 10, then you should read this question.\n\nThis answer applies to Mac models where the following is true.\n\n*\n\n*An optical drive and/or Windows installation DVD is unavailable. Such cases include when the optical drive has been removed or is broken. Also, when a Windows iso file is available and the Mac has a working optical drive, but no blank DVD can be obtained.\n\n*Windows 10 needs to be installed to boot using the legacy BIOS method. This generally includes Mac models that where shipped with an optical drive.\n\n*Your Mac is capable of 64 bit EFI mode booting from a properly created USB flash drive Windows 10 installer.\n\nNote: Unless apple officially supports Windows 10 on your model Mac, there is no documented way of knowing if your Mac can 64 bit EFI boot from a USB flash drive Windows 10 installer. The only way to know is to build such an installer and try booting.\n\nThe Windows specifications are given below.\n\n*\n\n*Edition: Windows 10 Pro\n\n*Processor: 64 bit\n\n*Version: 21H1\n\n*OS Build: 19043.928\n\nThe specifications for my iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2011) are given below.\n\n*\n\n*Identifier: iMac12,1\n\n*Processor: 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5\n\n*Cores: 4\n\n*Memory: 16 GB\n\n*Graphics: AMD Radeon HD 6750M 512 MB\n\nThe macOS is version 10.13.6 (High Sierra).\nBelow, are the basic steps needed to install Windows 10 for an BIOS boot, when the USB flash drive Windows installer boots in EFI mode.\nI have made the following assumptions.\n\n*\n\n*Apple has not supplied the drivers for a 64 bit Windows 10 installation. A common misconception is that the latest Windows Support Software from Apple should always be used to install Windows 10. This is wrong. Microsoft Windows is designed to use legacy drivers when current drivers are not available or nonexistant. You should use the latest Windows Support Software that apple has released for your model Mac. I assume this is what you get when the latest Boot Camp Assistant application available for your Mac is used to download the Windows Support Software.\n\nNote: I actually have a 2007 iMac running Windows 10 Pro 64 bit. The software was installed (from a DVD) on a freshly formatted partition using the Windows Support Software designed for a 32 bit Windows 7 installation.\n\n\n\n*Windows will be installed on the primary internal drive. In other words, the drive with the disk identifier of disk0.\n\nNote: Windows can be installed on drives other than disk0, but this may also require a 500 MB \"System Reserved\" boot partition on disk0. In any case, the procedure to implement this situation is beyond the scope of this answer.\n\n\n\n*Windows will be installed on the 2nd, 3rd or 4th partition of the drive.\n\nNote: Windows can be installed on partitions greater than the fourth partition. Again, the procedure to implement this situation is beyond the scope of this answer.\n\nBelow are the installation steps.\n\nNote: To get a better view of the images shown below, either click on an image or open an image in a new window.\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the latest Windows Support Software for your Mac. For the 2011 iMac, this software can be found at Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621. On my Mac, these files were downloaded to the \"BootCamp5\" folder stored in my \"Downloads\" folder.

Look for the \"Action\" pulldown on the Boot Camp Assistant menu bar. On my 2011 iMac, these files were downloaded to the \"WindowsSupport\" folder\" stored in my home folder. When installing Windows 10 on my 2011 iMac, this download can be substituted for the Boot Camp Support Software 5.1.5621 download.\n\n\n\n*Create a ExFAT formatted volume labeled \"BOOTCAMP\" on the 2nd, 3rd or 4th partition of the primary disk. If this volume already exists, then erase the contents.\n\n\n*Make sure the drive is using the GPT/MBR hybrid partitioning scheme. See my answer to the question \"How to convert a drive from the GPT format to the hybrid GPT/MBR format when using High Sierra (macOS 10.13.2)\" for a procedure that accomplishes this task.\n\nUser Semi has noted that the Boot Camp Assistant (BCA) will correctly GPT/MBR hybrid partition the drive. So, you may be able to the the BCA to partition the drive, then use the flash drive to install Windows.\n\n\n\n*Use the Disk Utility application to erase a 16 GB or larger flash drive. Choose the parameters shown in the image below.\n\nBy default, the macOS High Sierra Disk Utility application is set to \"Show Only Volumes\". To insure the flash drive device presents itself in the Disk Utility sidebar, you should set the Disk Utility to \"Show All Devices\". This can be accomplished by selecting Show All Devices from the View menu in the top left corner of the Disk Utility window.\n\n\n\n\n*Mount the Windows iso file. In my case, the label \"CCCOMA_X64FRE_EN-US_DV9\" was used to identify the mounted Windows iso file. If you encountered a different label, then make the appropriate modifications to the instructions given in the rest of this step.\nUse the Finder application to perform the following operations.\n\n*\n\n*Copy the contents of the mounted Windows iso file to the volume in the Windows partition. The mounted Windows iso file is the \"CCCOMA_X64FRE_EN-US_DV9\" volume and the Windows partition contains the \"BOOTCAMP\" volume.\n\n\n*Copy the contents of the mounted Windows iso file to the flash drive. The mounted Windows iso file is the \"CCCOMA_X64FRE_EN-US_DV9\" volume and the flash drive is the \"WINSTALL\" volume.\n\n\n*Copy the Boot Camp Support Software or the Windows Support Software to the flash drive. On my 2011 iMac, The Boot Camp Support Software was downloaded to the \"BootCamp5\" folder stored in my \"Downloads\" folder. The Windows Support Software was downloaded to the \"WindowsSupport\" folder stored in my home folder. The flash drive is the \"WINSTALL\" volume.\nThe image below shows the contents of the \"BOOTCAMP\" volume.\n\nThe image below shows the contents of the \"WINSTALL\" volume.\n\n\n\n*Next, you need to boot from the flash drive. Hold down the option key immediately after restarting your Mac. Release the option key when the Startup Manager window appears. Select the yellow USB external drive icon labeled \"EFI boot\". Next, select the arrow below the \"EFI boot\" label.\n\n\n*When a window similar to the one show below appears, open a Windows Command Prompt window by pressing shift+F10.\n\nThe result should be similar to the image shown below.\n\n\n\n*Use the commands diskpart and bootsect to make the \"BOOTCAMP\" volume BIOS bootable. The commands you need to enter are given below.\n\nNote: Sometimes the diskpart command can take a while to produce the first prompt. Be patient.\n\ndiskpart\nlist disk\n\nYou should see output similar to what is shown below. If there is a * character in the Gpt column for the Disk 0 entry, then you have not successfully converted the internal drive to use the GPT/MBR hybrid partitioning scheme, as described in step 3. If there is a * character in the Gpt column for the Disk 1 entry, then you did not select \"Master Boot Record\" as the scheme in step 4.\n  Disk ###  Status         Size     Free     Dyn  Gpt\n  --------  -------------  -------  -------  ---  ---\n  Disk 0    Online          565 GB      0 B\n  Disk 1    Online           14 GB      0 B\n  Disk 2    No Media          0 B       0 B\n\nIf no * characters appear in the Gpt column, then proceed and enter the command given below.\nlist volume\n\nFrom the output of the command list volume, determine the number (###) for the volume with the Label \"BOOTCAMP\".  Also, determine the drive letter (Ltr) for this volume. In this example, I will assume the number is 1 and the letter is C. Your number and letter could be different. The next command selects this volume. If you determined a different number for the \"BOOTCAMP\" volume, then make the appropriate substitution.\nselect  volume  1\n\nThe next sequence of commands mark the volume active (bootable) and then quit diskpart.\nactive\nexit\n\nThe next command writes the boot code to the MBR and the \"BOOTCAMP\" volume. If you determined a different drive letter for the \"BOOTCAMP\" volume, then make the appropriate substitution.\nbootsect  /nt60  C:  /mbr\n\n\n\n*You need to finish the installation of Windows 10. Enter the command shown below to quit the Windows Command Prompt window.\nexit\n\nPress Escape or click the red X button to close the Windows installer. If the popup shown below appears, then click on the Yes button. Immediately, hold down the option key while the Mac restarts. Release the option key when the Startup Manager window appears.\n\n\n\n*Select the internal drive icon labeled \"Windows\". Next, hold down the control key while choosing the circular arrow below the \"Windows\" label.\n\n\n*Continue with the installation of Windows 10. When asked: \"Where do you want to install Windows?\", proceed as follows. First select the \"BOOTCAMP\" partition. Next, click on the Format button, then the OK button. Finally, click on the Next button.\n\n\n*Proceed until you reach the screen where you are prompted for your region. For the 21H1 version (OS build 19043.928) of Windows 10, your the screen will appear as shown below.\n\nFor other versions of Windows 10, the screen could appear different. As an example, the screen, for the 1507 version (OS build 10240) of Windows 10, would appear as shown below.\n\n\nNote: At this point, prohibiting your Mac access to the internet is generally a good idea. For example, unplug any ethernet cables or disable Wi-Fi access that does not require encryption.\n\nNext, press the control+shift+F3 keys to restart Windows 10 in Audit mode. If you are using a wireless keyboard, then you may have to utilize the On-Screen Keyboard. See Ease of access on the lower left of the screen.\n\nNote: An unusually long amount of time must pass before the Boot Camp installer and/or desktop appears.\n\n\n\n*If the Boot Camp installer automatically launches, then your screen should appear similar to the image shown below.\n\nIf this does not occur, use the Windows File Explorer to open the Boot Camp installer application named \"Setup\".\n\nNote: If you use the Windows File Explorer to open the \"Setup\" application, then you might have to select \"Run as administrator\".\n\nThis application can be found in the \"BootCamp\" folder on the \"WINSTALL\" drive. Install Boot Camp by following the displayed steps. After the installer application completes, allow the computer to restart.\n\n\n*You will return to the Administrator's desktop. If you are using a wireless keyboard, check to see if the keyboard is paired with the Mac. If not, then add the wireless keyboard to the existing Bluetooth devices.\n\nNote: When pairing my Apple wireless keyboard, I needed to hold down the power button on the keyboard before trying to add the device. I released the button, when the keyboard was discovered by the Mac.\n\n\n\n*If you prohibited your Mac access to the internet in an earlier step, you will now want to allow access. In other words, plug in the ethernet cable or connect by Wi-Fi.\n\n\n*Run the Apple Software Update application and install all updates.\n\nNote: When first executing \"Apple Software Update\" you may be asked to update \"Apple Software Update\" itself. If you happens, you should uncheck all other updates and just update \"Apple Software Update\". Otherwise, you may get an error message saying another update can not be installed. I my case, there were two updates of the \"Apple Software Update\" to download and install.\n\n\n\n*(Optional) Download and install Windows updates, including perhaps any optional updates. You may want to skip this step for now if you believe the updates will be large in number and/or size. However, skipping this step may result in some hardware drivers not being updated.\n\nNote: If the Restart now button appears while downloading and installing updates, then this button should not be selected until all displayed updates have finished installing or reached a status of \"Pending restart\".\n\n\n\n*From the Windows Start menu, select to restart the Mac. You will return to the Administrator's desktop. If the \"System Preparation Tool\" window is not displayed, then open the sysprep application found in the C:\\Windows\\System32\\Sysprep folder. In this window, select \"Shutdown\" under the \"Shutdown options\", as shown below.\n\nNote: Your screen may also include a window titled \"Boot Camp\", which  can be ignored.\n\n\nNext, select \"OK\" to shutdown the Mac. At this point, you have completed the installation of Windows 10.\nNext time you turn on your Mac, Windows will start in the \"Out of the Box Experience\" mode. This is basically the way a newly purchased PC starts up, when Windows 10 is already installed.\n\nNote: When asked, be sure to select an Apple keyboard.\n\nIf asked, I can clarify any of the above steps.\nAdditional Notes\n\n*\n\n*When the window below appeared, I clicked on the Go button.\n\nNext, I check off Enable AMD Video Quality features in supported video player applications, as shown below.\n\nFinally, I clicked on the Apply button, then closed the window.\n\n\n*This problem occurred when using a wireless keyboard and mouse. The Device Manager window is shown below. Here, there appears to be problem with a Bluetooth HID device. I am not sure, but I believe this device is not needed.\n\nThis same device appears under on the \"Bluetooth & other devices\" under \"Settings\", as shown below.\n\nI clicked on the device to make the Remove device button appear, as shown below.\n\nI removed the device.\n\n\n*This next problem did not occur when I installed Windows 10 using the above instructions, but has occurred during previous Windows 10 installations. While answering questions, the message below appeared with the error code OOBEIDPS.\n\nSomething went wrong – But you can try again\n\nAccording to the Microsoft website Windows-based computer hangs during OOBE setup tasks, the solution is to do the following.\n\nTo resolve this issue, disconnect from the Internet. After you've completed all the steps in the OOBE, reconnect to the Internet.\n\n\nA: I just came across this same issue when trying to repurpose my old MacBook Air 2011. I experienced a known issue whereas when you install Windows in UEFI mode, the Intel video drivers will crash the system - they'll black out the screen, and if you force a reboot, you'll get stuck at the Windows logo and boot never completes. I gather it's something to do with Apple's UEFI implementation. The solution is to load Windows in BIOS mode.\nThe problem is I'd already wiped MacOS from the machine, and had no intention to reinstall it, not to mention I want the entire drive to be Windows. The solution is to use Rufus on Windows to create your Windows install USB, and brigadier to download the Boot Camp support software and drivers. You can do all of this from a Windows machine.\n\n*\n\n*Acquire a Windows 10 64-bit ISO image.\n\n\n*Using a USB drive of minimum 8GB in size, write the image using Rufus to the drive in MBR mode. You should be able to leave the other options alone.\n\n\n\n*Use Brigadier to download the correct Boot Camp software for your machine. You can use EveryMac or any similar database to find out the exact Mac model number, and pass that to Brigadier, e.g. brigadier -m MacBookAir4,2.\n\n\n*Put the downloaded Boot Camp software on the USB drive so you have easy access to it after installing.\n\n\n*Put the USB drive in your Mac and boot up while holding down Option. You should see a gold USB drive icon with \"Windows\" below it if this worked correctly. Hold down Ctrl and click the circle below the USB device icon.\n\n\n*Install Windows. You should not need to pre-partition the drive at all, you should in fact be able to just let Windows partition the drive for you as usual, since Windows will detect that you booted from legacy BIOS mode and should create an MBR partition table for you. However, if you want to clean off anything on the drive, you can use diskpart to clean the physical drive's partition table (hit Shift+F10 as soon as the installer boots to get a command prompt).\n\n\n*After the files are copied and the machine reboots, go through the initial setup as usual. You might notice your screen is running in a lower-res mode - this is a good thing, because it means you're actually running in BIOS mode.\n\n\n*Install drivers. So far, I'm stuck against a wall with the \"Your computer must be running Windows 7\" error, even after setting compatibility mode on the Boot Camp installer. I haven't figured this part out yet, but I can manually install drivers from the Boot Camp folder as necessary.\nAt least for me, this seems to have eliminated the problem of the display drivers crashing the system, and I can just use the ones from Windows Update without any issue.\nHope this helps someone!\nEDIT: I did find a method for resolving the Boot Camp installation issue. I'm working on documenting it, but it involves using Microsoft's Orca (download linkeditor) to edit the BootCamp64.msi file to allow it to install on a later version. In short, in LaunchConditions, change the version from \"NTVersion=601\" to \"NTVersion>=601\". With that, I was able to install the full Boot Camp suite, including the control panel. Everything works except that I don't get the OSD displays for changing volume and such, but I do get the Apple volume change clicks. Also, brightness doesn't work, but I am able to adjust it in Display settings, so it's just that the brightness keys aren't reaching the OS. You could maybe use Autohotkey or something to substitute some other keys, or maybe even the actual brightness keys themselves, as brightness keys. (I'll update this post with a link to the docs once I finish testing and experimenting to make sure it works.)\n", "Q: Safe to remove - .rnd and .CFUserTextEncoding As a cleanup routine, I remove files from ~/Library/Logs and ~/Library/Caches directory.\nI also remove ~/.Trash and ~/.DS_Store\nMy question - Is it safe to remove ~/.rnd and ~/.CFUserTextEncoding?\nWhat are these files/folders for?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*.CFUserTextEncoding is used to store defaults for language and encoding\n\n*.rnd is used as entropy bytes to aid in randomness algorithms\n\n*.DS_Store holds your Finder preferences for viewing that folder\n\n*.Trash is the terminal version of your macOS trash can\nDeleting files you don't understand is generally considered a really terrible idea.

[MacOS 10.13.1]\nI'm organising some files and have two Finder windows open so I can move files from one to the other.\nSince the filename doesn't always describe the contents of the file, I am renaming many of these files after reviewing them and before I moving them.  Renaming the file in Finder window #1 causes the file to be automatically be placed in its correctly sorted position in the file list.  Whilst I understand the behaviour, it then forces me to scroll down to find the file I want to move. This is getting rather tedious for the number of files I'm dealing with. \nHowever, what is really irritating me is that after I drop the file into a folder displayed in Finder window #2, Finder window, #2, updates its view to match what Finder window #1 is showing.  This forces me to perform a scroll operation in Finder window #2 to return to the location I was at, before I can move the next file. This is a really frustrating behaviour that is demolishing any sense of efficiency in doing this task.  \nI'm aware that Mac OS has a save-as-you-go behaviour designed into it, which occasionally is useful, after all it's not that often that my hard disk crashes or I loose power to my PC.  \nNevertheless, is there a way of turning off the behaviour described above, or opening a Finder window that only responds to its own user interactions?\n\nA: Sort differently. If you sort by say, file size, the sort order won't change with the file name. I also enable \"date added\" or \"date created\" because those are not the same as \"date modified\". You can do grouping and sorting through the view menu.\n", "Q: What happens if you restore your keychain from a TM backup? Does anyone know what happens or what I should expect if I restore all contents of ~/Library/Keychains from a Time Machine backup? I'm trying to assess the risks of doing this.\nThe reason I am asking is my iCloud keychain, which contains about 8 years of pretty important \"Secure Notes\", disappeared a few days ago. I believe the reason for it disappearing is that its local copy became corrupt (there is now a files at ~/Library/Keychains/[redacted_guid]/keychain-2.db-\nkeychain-2.db-corrupt and it was created around the time I noticed problems). I have tried restoring just the ~/Library/Keychains/[redacted_guid]/ folder, but that didn't fix the problem.\nA reasonable next step is to restore the entire folder, which I hope has a working db and valid links to it. But I am afraid this will make things worse. Currently, my system is working fine. Using my user password, I can unlock my computer from a sleep and I can unlock the secure parts of System Preferences. I can see things going bad fast if I screw up my primary login keychain.\n\nA: Answering my own question -- because I simply ran out of time: my need for my secure notes outweighed the risks.\nI restored an earlier copy of my entire ~/Library/Keychains folder from a pre-corruption Time Machine backup. This did not restore the \"iCloud\" option in my Keychain Access \"Keychains\" panel, but the secure notes all reappeared under \"Local Items\". After restoring the items, I was able to lock and unlock things in System Preferences, and I was able to log-out and log-in to my computer (after making copies of all the secure notes, and so far I can't say I see any obvious problems.\nSo in my case, the answer to my question is: it didn't do anything bad, though it will (of course) reset any passwords you may have changed since the backup.\n", "Q: How to fix Private Internet Access' kill switch?

I know I can do this by Shell > Export Text As... but is there a command (Bash) to do this?\n\nA: This can be done with the standard unix command script(1) though requires running a subshell under the current shell. That is, start a terminal, and run script, issue whatever commands need to be logged, then exit from that shell:\n$ script\nScript started, output file is typescript\n$ uptime\n11:30  up 22 days, 16:15, 1 user, load averages: 1.43 1.37 1.38\n$ exit\n\nScript done, output file is typescript\n$ \n\nThen in the output typescript file there should be a record of the shell session run under script(1).\nBut wait, there's more! With expect one can also save a session and possibly replay it. This requires installing expect from a ports system (Fink, Homebrew, or here MacPorts) which should install autoexpect:\n$ port installed | grep expect\n  expect @5.45.3_0 (active)\n$ which autoexpect\n/opt/local/bin/autoexpect\n$ autoexpect $SHELL\nautoexpect started, file is script.exp\n$ uptime\n 6:47  up 23 days, 11:32, 1 user, load averages: 1.37 1.39 1.33\n$ exit\nautoexpect done, file is script.exp\n$ \n\nDoing something useful with script.exp in turn probably requires knowledge of expect and TCL, so this is a more advanced option. (expect in particular has a log_file option that can be toggled to save everything, but then you'd be writing everything in TCL and not bash...)\nOtherwise the terminal itself must save the session; iTerm.app probably has more options for this (Session -> Log -> Start) than Terminal.app.\n", "Q: “Your Apple ID has been disabled” My friend has an iPhone 6S+ and he can’t install or update any apps or music etc. he gets the message in the title.

The day after I returned the Choetech Thunderbolt Power cable that I bought for $63 on Amazon and went back to the original Apple supplied cable (which seems a little looser in the LG).\nThe problem started happening a couple of months ago (I bought the same Macbook 13,3 with the LG in December 2016. Had the LG replaced because of screen issues a short time later.)\nThe restart only occurs early in the morning, but I frequently (5 times a week?) have to jiggle the cable to get the display to come on, which is one of the reasons I bought a replacement.\nI have pretty much the same dump as you show.\nFlummoxed!\n", "Q: Can I load an iPad with content without using an Apple ID (prize for conference)? Here's the scenario:\nA client is having a conference and wants to give away a brand new iPad (not yet purchased).\nThey also want to pre-load the iPad with a bunch of their content (audio and video) and give the iPad away to one lucky attendee.\nThe Content:\nAs far as I'm aware, the content (audio / video) does not exist in any app on the iTunes store, but rather I'd take the audio and video files the client wants to pre-load and load them via my computer.\nThe problem:\nI haven't owned an iPad in a long time, but I remember that in order to put content on the iPad you need an Apple ID, or you have to tie the iPad to approved computers and sync via iTunes.\nSince we won't know who the winner will be, and won't be able to tie the device to their Apple ID / Computer, is it even possible?\nBefore asking this question here, I went down to an Apple Store and talked to a Genius, and the suggestion was to just use iTunes because you can set an iPad up without an Apple ID...but that still poses the problem with the approved computer thing...if I use iTunes, then it's tied to my machine...which I don't want.\nI also don't want to de-authorize the iPad and lose content if I do get it loaded.\nI know that iOS 11 has Files now, so I was curious about that route -- but it seems again that it has to be tied to a specific pre-existing account to use -- even if it's not an Apple ID.\nThe Question:\nAssuming it is possible, how can I pre-load an iPad with content to be given away at a conference in such a way that neither the content, nor the iPad itself is tied to my accounts/computer?\nI'd like to, if possible determine if it's possible the iPad gets purchased.\nIf I had an iPad, I'd just try these options out, but since I don't (and the iPad hasn't been purchased), I'm hoping that someone else has come across this specific use-case and has figured out a solution.\nMake it a great day!\n\nA: There is no way to load apps/content onto an iDevice without using an AppleID. You should give the prize iPad away untouched and give the winner an Apple gift card to allow let them purchase the apps and content they want. After all, the iPad belongs to the prize-winner.\nThis is what we've done at my place of employment in similar situations.\n", "Q: Can I delete photos on the old phone after I transfered them to a new one? I just got new 6s and signed in with my iCloud from my old 6. The pictures were transferred from my old phone to the new. If I delete the pictures off my 6s will is also delete them off my original  device? \n\nA: Yes.\nIt looks like you're using iCloud to sync your pictures across your devices.  iCloud is a sync solution, meaning that it keeps all your data in sync across every device you're signed in with your Apple ID.\nIf you delete them from your old iPhone, you're actually deleting them from iCloud.\nAll you need to do is sign out of iCloud from your old iPhone 6.  This will remove all your synced data (not just photos, in case you are syncing other content).  If you plan on selling your device, you can then erase all the content and your pictures will still be in iCloud.\n", "Q: I purchased iTunes music and no longer want the subscription. How do I cancel my subscripition? I no longer want my subscription of iTunes music - how do I cancel my subscription?\n\nA: You can do this from your Account page in iTunes. Apple has a support page on this, see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039\n", "Q: iOS 11: How to prevent an app from opening in slide over mode? I am reading my emails and want to open a link. This link is automatically opened in my browser in slide over mode.\nI have an IPad Pro 10.5 and when used in portrait mode, the slide over app is tiny and make webpages unreadable.\nMy question then is: how can I still use multitasking (which is useful by itself if I control how to use it) but prevent an app from opening other apps in slide over mode.\nAlternatively, is there any way to make a slide over app the main app? Can I make my browser fullscreen with an occult gesture I couldn't manage to find?\nMy best workaround right now is to manually open from the dock the app that is in slide over so that I can see it fullscreen (and it doesn't even show in the recent app list!) or to just turn off multitasking, which I'm inclined to do.\n\nA: I finally found a way to get rid of that small window and make links open in a full browser.\nI was using Google's Inbox to read emails and Chrome to open the links. As the OP was describing, clicking on a link opened a small Chrome window and because Inbox does not support Split View, the small window was not resizable. It turns out iOS remembers the size and state of the last time Chrome was opened in multitasking mode. \nI had to start some other app that supported Split View (like “Reminders”), pull up the dock, drag the Chrome icon to the top of the app, essentially kicking in Split View. Then I resized the Chrome window to be full screen. \nThis way, now when I click on a link on Gmail or Inbox and select Chrome to open it, it comes in full screen.\n", "Q: What are the Ubiquity logs on my Mac? In the \"~/Library/Logs\" folder, I discovered a folder called \"Ubiquity\", but I have no such app named \"ubiquity\" on my MacBook Pro.\nI Googled and also searched here (Ask Different), but all references to \"ubiquity\" seem to relate wifi or iCloud syncing, and my MBP has had issues with both, so I am curious what Ubiquity is.\nFWIW: I began looking into the Logs folder because a message popped up to warn me of junk files that I should remove-by upgrading some software. There is indeed a huge number of files, but Ubiquity is the only name I didn't recognize and can't associate with any software.\n\nA: Ubiquity or Ubiquitous Data File is how iCloud shared documents get synced between your various devices and the cloud storage servers Apple runs. It’s a legitimate part of the macOS, but that doesn’t mean that the files you saw were legit as sometimes scam software like malware reuses a “safe” name to “hide in plain sight” so that someone would find my answer here or Apple’s documentation and conclude all is fine.\nThe most likely situation for you is all good, but we’d need to look at the detailed file to know for sure.\n", "Q: Does replacing an iPhone/iPad battery reset the battery stats? I have purchased a refurbished iPad. It is from a Apple-certified repair shop, but I understand this is not the same as Apple refurbished.\nOn a MacBook with an internal battery, I can see in System Information that the battery still has its own firmware and serial number. Is it similar for iOS devices? Does the device know if the battery has been replaced and will this reset battery stats such as loadcycles?\nThe battery appears to have ~200 loadcycles and only 80% capacity, indicating it is not in good condition. \nHowever, I have noticed that the charge level regularly goes above 100% when finishing the charge, which might make sense if the charging firmware was \"surprised\" by a new battery.\nMy Google-fu was unable to find any battery benchmarks for the iPad 4. (Retina iPad 2012), which I might use to compare the battery's actual performance. I get about 15 hours of screen on time, which seems good.\n\nA: The battery contains the \"battery info\", not the logic board. So if you put a new battery, what the logic board reads is based on the current battery only. \nCapacity and Charge are two different things. You're battery can be at 80% of it's design capacity but will still charge to 100% (of said capacity). It's just that a fully charged battery that is at 80% of Design Capacity will not last as long as a new battery that is at 100% Design Capacity. \nAs far as your battery, it is at the lower limit. 80% of Design Capacity is okay but as you use the battery and as it ages, it will continue to degrade. The difference between an iPad and an iPhone is that we typically don't use the iPad all day so even if the charge is low a few days later, we just charge it when were not using it. On an iPhone, it is constantly in use (various radios) so we quickly notice reduce battery lifespan. \nTest your battery over time and when it gets below 70%, you may consider having it replaced but it will really depend on how you use your iPad on a daily basis more than anything else.\n", "Q: Why do I keep getting a request to install JDK on mid 2015 MacBook Pro After updating to  OS 10.13.1 I got messages to update JDK, I have gone to the website, downloaded then installed the update. I then have the website run a check to see if I have the latest update. The site says that I, indeed, have the latest. But every time I boot up the Mac I get the message to update.  I seem to recall this issue with an earlier update a couple of years back and don't remember how to resolve it. \n\n\nA: You may need to download legacy Java that apple doesn't automatically ship anymore. That said, if you think you know which application may be what's requiring this, it may be a good idea to get rid of it if you don't need it. If you do need it, this should be the right download: https://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572?locale=en_US\n", "Q: Recovery Mode: FireVault psswd unrecognised and CoreStorage not found Need some urgent help with my unruly Mac (faced with the prospect of erasing my hard drive after 150 days without backup...)\nHere is the problem that I have. My Mac got quite slow and I restarted it and upon the restart I got a prohibitory sign, which is like a crossed out circle. I read that the solution to this would be reinstalling the OS in recovery mode (Cmnd+R) which I tried to do. The problem is that my hard drive is encrypted using Fire Vault so I need to unlock it before the OS can be reinstalled on it. Unfortunately, there is a known bug where the Fire Vault password is not recognized in recovery mode (I know a 100% it is the correct one, but the mac just rejects it). Again, upon googling I found that the solution to this problem would be to go to the Terminal from recovery mode and unlock the disk from the Terminal.\n(here is the thread where I found the solution https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3348646 )\nNow I tried to follow the directions in the thread which are:\n\n\n*\n\n*find the core storage UUID by doing diskutil coreStorage list\n\n*using the UUID of the locked HD, type in \"diskutil coreStorage unlockVolume \"\nNow the current problem that I cannot solve arises when I type in diskutil coreStorage list. I get the error \"No CoreStorage logical volume groups found\" which means that my CoreStorage has been removed.\nThis is where I am right now, and I could really use some help of someone who knows how to work with these things. As far as I understand, I either need to make my encrypted HD a core storage unit OR to find a way to unlock it without making it a core storage unit. I am scared to do either though because browsing through help files didn't give a simple answer and I am worried I will do something irreversibly bad.\nThank you very much!!\nAttached is the output of diskutil list\ndiskutil output\n\nA: If you have access to another mac, a potential way to be able to back up your data is to boot in target disk mode https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201462. This will mount your internal HD on the host mac like it would a normal external HD and the OS will immediately prompt you to unlock it using your FileVault pw. I have encountered basically this same bug you are describing in the past and have had success unlocking with this method, even if it fails from recovery. \nIf you don't have another Mac handy, you can also reset your FileVault pw (I understand that you know it, but this method may still get you back into the machine) by opening terminal from the utilities menu in recovery (or internet recovery, whichever) typing resetpassword, hitting enter and following the prompts. However, if you don't have your recovery key or apple ID access set up this method won't be much help. Good luck!\n", "Q: MacOS Sierra - Automator/Shortcut to disable proxy? Our company policy allows us to use the company laptop for personal matters, but of course, the proxy prevents us to visit some sites like Netflix etc. So I frequently disable the proxy - I'd like to have a shortcut or a more convenient way, than actually digging through the menu every time. I tried Automator, but it doesn't seem to recognize my click on the \"Advanced...\" tab in the settings, so it crashes at that step:\n\nIs there a way I could set Automator or a keyboard shortcut up to disable the proxy easily? Thanks!\nUPDATE:\nI tried networksetup -setwebproxystate Wi-Fi off, but it doesn't seem to do anything. After running the command, the proxy setting is still the same:\n\n\nA: Instead of using Watch Me Do for scripting System Preferences UI interactions, add a Shell Script action with the following:\nnetworksetup -setautoproxystate Wi-Fi off\n\nwhere ‘Wi-Fi’ is the name of the network service you are modifying, shown selected in the left sidebar when viewing the Network preference pane.\n\nA: Rather than scripting the switch, why not create a network location (essentially, another set of network settings) with proxy on vs. off. Once you have multiple locations set up, a Location submenu appears under the Apple menu that lets you switch.\nTo create a new location:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open System Preferences.\n\n*Select the Network preference pane.\n\n*From the Location pop-up menu, select Edit Locations.\n\n*If you want to create a new location from scratch, click the Add (\"+\") button under the location list. If you want to start from a duplicate of your existing settings, select the current location, choose Action menu (gear icon under the location list) > Duplicate Location.\n\n*In either case, give the new location a distinctive name (e.g. \"Office w/proxy\") and click Done.\n\n*Click Apply. (Network Prefs requires you to \"Apply\" changes before they actually happen. I've seen glitches where it fails to properly remember changes to new locations if the new location isn't actually fully created yet.)\n\n*Edit the new location with whatever settings (e.g. proxy) are needed.\n\n*Click Apply again.\n\n*Open the Apple menu, select the Location submenu, and admire your shiny new network settings switcher.\n\n", "Q: Why does `g++ --version` say LLVM/clang? I ran the following to see what version of g++ I had:\n$ g++ --version\nConfigured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1\nApple LLVM version 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.38)\nTarget: x86_64-apple-darwin16.7.0\nThread model: posix\nInstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin\n\nI thought g++ was a different compiler to clang/LLVM. Can anyone clarify what the above means?\n\nA: In modern versions of macOS, g++ is just a little shim that points to the relevant part of clang in whichever version of Xcode you have installed.\nHistorically g++ was the C++ compiler that was part of the GCC compiler distribution, but Apple stopped distributing that with the operating system when they moved over to LLVM.\nIf you want to use the GCC distribution you can install it through homebrew.\n", "Q: Safe to unplug external HDD that has spun down? I often can hear that an external HDD has spun down, and figure it would be safe to unplug since it won't be writing any data.\nAm I wrong in this assumption?\n\nA: Your best bet is to always eject (or unmount) the drive. \nBasically, failure to unmount before disconnecting the device can result in loss of data and/or a corrupted file system.\nIf the external hard drive has in fact spun down, then unplugging it (accidentally or otherwise) is less risky than it would be if it hadn't spun down, but this won't remove the risk entirely. For example, in your question you refer to the fact that often you can hear that an external HDD has spun down, but this is prone to errors in judgment.\nAlso, not all external drives are the same. Some are USB powered, some have their own dedicated power source, some don't even use USB. What I'm getting at here, is that the only rule that can safely be applied to all external drives is to eject/unmount them first prior to unplugging them!\n\nA: Yes, it is. After ejecting the disk I would recommend turning off the power switch if it has one. If not, go ahead and unplug it.\n", "Q: Does AppleScript's do shell script log in history? I frequently use the do shell script command in AppleScript (AS) to return some information, including encrypted text.\nOne such example is:\nset encrypted to (do shell script \"echo 'my secret text' | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -a -pass pass:Pass123\")\n\nIf run in Terminal, this command logs in the history and can be viewed by typing: history, then pressing the Return key.\nProblem:\nThe above example includes the plain text password as a parameter, and it shows in the history (when run in Terminal), from where it can easily be copied and used to reverse the encrypted string, no knowledge required.\nAppleScript's log do shell script \"history\" command returns no data. Likewise, running the history command in the terminal - after the example encryption was run through AS, it also does not display the AS terminal command in this history. All in all, it leads me to believe that the AS command was obviously executed through a different shell. Knowing that the shell differs for every user (ie. my account cannot see the terminal history of another account), the question follows.\nQuestion:\nDoes that mean there is no record of the AS command in any of the histories and logs kept by macOS at any time? Or is it burried somewhere accessible where it can be read, interpreted and hence the encryption reversed?\nThough perhaps thought-provoking and open to opinion, I think it is within the answerable realm of questions. I am interested in the answer from a security point-of-view and hope to get a clearer picture of if / how / where terminal logs AS commands - like Terminal does with the history.\nThanks everyone.\n\nA: If you run the following do shell script command in Script Editor:\ndo shell script \"set\"\n\nShown farther below is what's returned.\nAs one can see, there are no history related shell variables set and as such, to make a longer story short, there is no command history being saved.\nIf you want to read further, have a look at the HISTORY section in the bash manual page,\nAlso may be of interest, other command history Shell Variables e.g., HISTCONTROL, HISTFILE HISTFILESIZE, HISTIGNORE, HISTSIZE, HISTIGNORE, HISTSIZE and HISTTIMEFORMAT.\n\nAlso of note, when a Run Shell Script action in an Automator workflow is run, the same applies there as well, for the same reason as with the do shell script command in Script Editor, no history related shell variables are set.\n\nOutput of the set command from an AppleScript do shell script command:\nApple_PubSub_Socket_Render=/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.HPRIi1Tsop/Render\nBASH=/bin/sh\nBASH_ARGC=()\nBASH_ARGV=()\nBASH_EXECUTION_STRING=set\nBASH_LINENO=()\nBASH_SOURCE=()\nBASH_VERSINFO=([0]=\\\"3\\\" [1]=\\\"2\\\" [2]=\\\"57\\\" [3]=\\\"1\\\" [4]=\\\"release\\\" [5]=\\\"x86_64-apple-darwin17\\\")\nBASH_VERSION='3.2.57(1)-release'\nDIRSTACK=()\nEUID=501\nGROUPS=()\nHOME=/Users/me\nHOSTNAME=mes-Mac.local\nHOSTTYPE=x86_64\nIFS='   \n'\nLOGNAME=me\nMACHTYPE=x86_64-apple-darwin17\nOPTERR=1\nOPTIND=1\nOSTYPE=darwin17\nPATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\nPOSIXLY_CORRECT=y\nPPID=4330\nPS4='+ '\nPWD=/\nSHELL=/bin/bash\nSHELLOPTS=braceexpand:hashall:interactive-comments:posix\nSHLVL=1\nSSH_AUTH_SOCK=/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.WQb3vmbYE7/Listeners\nTERM=dumb\nTMPDIR=/var/folders/w0/lht0h70x06b8hdb5lx474pkc0000gn/T/\nUID=501\nUSER=me\nXPC_FLAGS=0x0\nXPC_SERVICE_NAME=0\n_=sh\n__CF_USER_TEXT_ENCODING=0x1F5:0x0:0x0\n\n", "Q: MacOS High Sierra crashes after a while Every time I start my MacBook, everything works fine.\nFor around 3 minutes.

The last loaded kext has nothing to do with this, I've disabled a few of the \"last loaded kext\"s and they didn't seem to do anything.\nCan someone help me figure out what's wrong? \n\nA: Sounds like you're on the right track with how you've started troubleshooting. Without knowing exactly what you've already tried, and for the benefit of others, I've outlined how I would normally proceed (keeping in mind that troubleshooting is a process of elimination and does require patience!).\nSince you've already established the problem is not occurring when booted into Safe Mode then it's time to investigate login items, fonts, and kernel extensions. \nInvestigating login items, fonts, and kernel extensions\nLet's start with Login Items:\n\n\n*\n\n*Startup normally\n\n*Go to System Preferences > Users & Groups\n\n*Select the Login Items tab\n\n*Take a note of your Login Items \n\n*Now remove all of them by highlighting them and clicking on the - button below\n\n*Restart your computer\n\n\nNow your Mac will boot up without those login items loading. Test to see if you can use your Mac without it crashing:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you can, you know one (or more) of the Login items were causing the problem. You can then add them back in one by one until you've identified the culprit. Problem solved.\n\n*If the problem does persist, it's either a problem with fonts you've installed yourself or with a 3rd party kernel extension. A little more info below:\n\n\nFonts:- You can remove any of the fonts you've installed yourself to see if this makes a difference.\nKernel Extensions:- You can open Terminal (found within your Utilites folder) and enter the following command:\nkextstat | grep -v com.apple\nThe above command will list 3rd party kernel extensions (you may need to stretch the Terminal window so it's easier to read). Look for anything you don't remember installing, or something that belongs to software you've removed, or just anything that looks out of place. Remember though, this is a list of 3rd party kernel extensions and therefore any of them could be causing the problem.\nIf your Mac continues to crash once you've gone through the above process, I would suggest that continuing to troubleshoot this will cause more frustration and take more time than just cutting your losses and doing a fresh installation of macOS.\n", "Q: Can I use the Dvorak layout on Japanese keyboard on macOS? Recently I switched to Dvorak, but found out that although my Chinese layout also switched to Dvorak, the Japanese layout didn't.\nI deleted the Japanese layout from the list on the System Preferences, but got no luck.\nWhy is the Japanese keyboard doesn't switch to Dvorak layout as well, and how can I, if possible?\nI use High Sierra.\n\nA: You can choose the layout you want for Japanese inside the preferences for that keyboard.\n\n", "Q: Using Migration Asst, have gone from Mac 1 to Mac 2, but now Mac 2 back to Mac 1? I had to send MacBook Pro #1 out for repair and used Migration Assistant to temporarily work on a loaner (MacBook Pro #2).\nNow #1 is back. Do I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use M.A. to go from #2 to #1, hoping it magically merges and resolves the differences in my user account existing on #1?\n\n*Reformat and reinstall the OS on #1, and use M.A. to go from #2 to #1?\n\n*Some other optimal solution?\n\n\nA: Assuming that you did a full migration from MBP #1 to MBP #2, then I'd probably go with your second option (although that may depend on how long MBP #1 was away for and how much work you've done since).\nThe only downside of this approach is that some 3rd party software may need you to reactivate them in order to use them. It's not really a problem, just may add a little inconvenience if you happen to be in that situation.\nSince you asked, there are indeed other solutions, such as cloning the drive from MBP #2 to MBP #1 using software such as Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper! You can also use Disk Utility to do the same thing.\n", "Q: How to use time machine to recover a deleted pdf in iBooks? I just accidentally deleted a pdf in iBooks on my MacBook, and I'm trying to use time machine to recover it. I learnt from the following question that I can only get access to the folder storing all my iBook files using terminal:\nWhere are my iBooks stored in macOS Sierra?\nHowever, it seems that I couldn't use terminal when using Time Machine to restore old files. Is there any way to get around this?\nI'm running macOS High Sierra.\n\nA: You should be able to restore the PDF from the backup using the command-line technique I posted in How can I restore iBooks stored in iCloud from a Time Machine backup?\nFind the most appropriate backup:\n$ tmutil listbackups \n[...]\n/Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/macbook/2017-12-11-123506\n/Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/macbook/2017-12-12-212807\n/Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/macbook/2017-12-13-224355\n\nCheck if your missing PDF is available:\n$ ls '/Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/macbook/2017-12-12-212807/Macintosh HD/Users/USERNAME/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~com~apple~iBooks/Documents/file.pdf'\n/Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/macbook/2017-12-12-212807/Macintosh HD/Users/USERNAME/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~com~apple~iBooks/Documents/file.pdf\n\nThis assumes you know the name of the file, but if not you can omit the file.pdf and you'll get the full listing for the directory.\nRestore the file to your Desktop:\n$ tmutil restore '/Volumes/Time Machine Backups/Backups.backupdb/macbook/2017-12-12-212807/Macintosh HD/Users/USERNAME/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~com~apple~iBooks/Documents/file.pdf' /Users/USERNAME/Desktop/\nTotal copied: 7.89 MB (8270868 bytes)\nItems copied: 1\n\nThen you can add the PDF to iBooks again as normal.\n", "Q: Possible to reconstruct sparsebundle from bands folder only? I have an encrypted sparsebundle from mid-2013. I am aware of the encryption type (AES-256) and the passphrase used to create the sparsebundle.\nUnfortunately, dropbox has somehow deleted all but the bands folder of this sparsebundle. Is it theoretically possible to recover the data from this sparsebundle without the Info.plist and token files? I have bands 0 and 1.\n\nA: To follow up on this - no, it is conclusively not possible to repair an encrypted sparsebundle without the token file. The token file contains the initialization details and salt for the encryption algorithm, which is just as essential as the passphrase for decrypting the data. \n", "Q: Hide a file extension by editing the file name in High Sierra Before upgrading to High Sierra (i.e. when using Yosemite/El Capitan/Sierra) I constantly hid file extensions by hitting enter and manually removing the file extension from the file name. After upgrading to High Sierra, I noticed this no longer applies. Instead, I have to go to the file info via cmd+I and manually check Hide extension.\nAs for Finder preferences, Show all filename extensions is de-selected.\nHow can I restore the previous behavior, which is very comfortable to me?\n\nA: As others have commented, you weren’t hiding the file extensions, you were deleting them from the file name itself.  This will impact how the file functions.  But, if you haven’t had a problem so far, great.  Just avoid doing it from now on.\nAs you’ve noticed, there is an option in the information pane to hide the extension.  Oddly, I can’t explain why you’ve only noticed this now.  It has been there in earlier versions for quite some time.\nThe only way I’m aware of to get rid of file extensions is to make sure the Finder Preferences option you mentioned is unchecked, then batch select all the files of concern to you and hit ⌘+Alt+I to bring up a single information pane summarising all the selected files.  The checkbox to hide extensions can be checked and it will be applied to all files in your selection.\nWith the global preference set not to show file extensions, my feeling is that new files created will, by default, not have their extension visible.\n", "Q: How to disable \"x days since last backup\" reminders in High Sierra Since I updated to High Sierra (Version 10.13.1 to be exact) the \"x days since last backup\" reminders have returned, showing up every day or so in the top right corner of the screen. I checked, and the Back Up Automatically box in System Preferences is still unchecked.\nIs there any way to make the reminders not appear again? \nI'm not interested in backing up using Time Machine tool I've had poor success restoring my computer with it one previous time.\n\nA: I had the same problem - you have to have your back up disk installed / mounted.  Then 'Select Backup Disk' from System Preferences / Time Machine, choose to 'Remove' - this way you force it to forget the disk and so it no longer reminds you about 'XX days since last backup'.\n\nA: Turn Time Machine off in System Preferences and you shouldn’t get bugged about it again.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use my Mac to mine Bitcoins? So Bitcoin seems all the rage, but it’s way too expensive for us mere mortals. Who can afford a bitcoin, right? But apparently bitcoins are produced by mining them and mining them involves a computer processing mathematical calculations. So I wonder, can I use my Mac to mine bitcoins?\nI have one old iMac sitting in a corner that I figure I could leave powered up 24/7 to do nothing else but mine Bitcoins. Is this possible? Will the benefit outweigh the costs?\nIt’s a 21 inch mid 2010 iMac with a 3.6ghz i5 processor and has 16gb RAM. \n\nA: Short answer\nIs it possible? Yes.\nWill the benefit outweigh the costs? No.\nLong answer\nWithout going into a lot of detail, and at the risk of oversimplifying things, in the early days mining bitcoins was easier than it is now. And, as time goes by, it will continue to get harder.\nAnother contributing factor is that the kinds of calculations needed to mine bitcoins are actually better suited to GPUs instead of CPUs (i.e. a graphics card is better at processing these than a CPU is). So, using your iMac as an example, the best GPU your model shipped with was a Radeon HD 5670 that had 512MB memory and while this may have been okay to mine bitcoins in 2010, it would take so long to do now that the cost of electricity would outweigh the value of any Bitcoin you’d be able to mine (as it now takes a lot longer to mine and the cost of power only goes up).\nThis brings me to the other factor. There is a real cost in mining bitcoins, starting with the cost of electricity. You’d need to have your Mac working overtime on the calculations 24/7 for literally months to try and obtain a single bitcoin. Trust me, the cost in power will be a lot higher! That is why many bitcoins are now being mined in bitcoin farms in China (i.e. air conditioned buildings with many devices on 24/7).\nTo my mind, the only way it’d be worth doing on a Mac would be if you were going to have access to one of the new iMac Pros (about to ship in the next couple of days) and it was configured with a Radeon Pro Vega 64 graphics processor with 16GB of HBM2 memory, and you had it running 24/7 at a workplace (i.e. so you’re not paying for the power) and assuming you didn’t have to pay for the iMac Pro itself. But of course that’s not a realistic scenario, and unless your employer was also on board, may risk termination of employment!\nInstead, if you want to get into mining, look at a dedicated machine designed for this purpose. Below are some examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*AntMiner S7\n\n*AntMiner S9\n\n*Avalon6\nNOTE: I am not affiliated with any of the products listed above, nor have I any experience with them whatsoever!\nAs you can see, the above items are not cheap. And, on top of that you need to factor in the cost of running them (i.e. electricity, air conditioning, etc)  where you live. So, my advice is forget about using a Mac (or any PC), do your research, and perform the calculations necessary to determine the costs to you and the likely return.\nA word on the lottery analogy\nAs mentioned by various people via the comments below (and those already migrated to chat), many see bitcoin mining as being akin to buying a lottery ticket. While I understand the analogy (i.e. because the odds of success are extremely low, and because someone could mine bitcoins for a whole year with no success while someone else could be successful after only ten minutes), this analogy is actually somewhat misleading.\nWhen someone buys a lottery ticket they essentially end up with a ticket containing random numbers in the hope that those numbers get selected. Now the odds of those numbers getting selected will depend on the lottery you're playing. However, bitcoin miners are not rewarded for essentially doing nothing, because the very act of mining bitcoins is in fact providing a record-keeping service for the overall bitcoin cryptocurrency and payment system. Bitcoin miners (if lucky enough) may get paid (i.e. rewarded) with newly-created bitcoins for this service. Likewise, even the term mining is somewhat misleading. Miners typically produce something, but bitcoin mining doesn't actually produce anything. For more information refer to Bitcoin and Beyond: The Possibilities and Pitfalls of Virtual Currencies.\nNevertheless, using the lottery example is useful to convey that (1) the odds of success are extremely low and, (2) you may get lucky instantly (and therefore the return on investment is excellent) or over the longer-term you'll spend a lot of money for very little gain.\n", "Q: Spotlight calculator always scientific notation? How do I get the spotlight calculator to always use scientific notation?\nThis is how it looks by default:\n\nBut I would rather that the answer above was displayed as 2.07935e-10\n\nA: Looks like you'll need to force a result too big or small to be shown in decimal format.\nSo multiply everything by 1e100 to force scientific format, and then just subtract 100 from the exponent that appears:\n\n", "Q: Safari - Reload Page from Origin, does what exactly? If you hold cmd and click View -> Reload Page From Origin what does that do exactly and how does it differ from a standard reload?\nI'm guessing it reloads the current page without using cache? But i'm not sure. I hope some one can confirm this.\n\nA: This loads the page and any same-domain resources requested by the page without using the cache. Resources located on other domains may still use the cache. You can completely bypass the cache using the Network tab of the Web Inspector as just ⌥⌘R is insufficient.\n", "Q: Apple Music \"Content not authorized\" error Yesterday I started my free trial of Apple Music and downloaded about 200 songs on my iPhone through Wi-Fi and it worked fine (with Wi-Fi turned on). Today I went for a walk and I could not play the downloaded music offline. Once I turn off both Wi-Fi and Cellular network I get an error: “Cannot Open: This content is not authorized”. Neither of songs downloaded to the phone works. However, if I turn my Wi-Fi back on, everything works perfectly fine. Does anyone know how to deal with it?\n\nA: In Settings > Music, is the \"iCloud Music Library\" toggled on? I would start with checking that first.\nIf it's already the case, I would recommend signing out and back in with your Apple ID in Settings > iTunes & App Stores.\nI'm subscribed to Apple Music, and had a similar issue recently after changing phones. Something wrong with DRM I assume, so authenticating again should be enough to solve it.\n\nA: By the way, the problem have been solved. The last thing I did was downloading U2 - Songs of Innocence Album to my phone. It was purchased from iTunes several years ago. Probably that helped with authenting again as Léopold suggested. \n", "Q: Adjusting the volume of a specific audio device from the command line I'd like to adjust the volume of a specific audio device from the command line in OS X. All examples of this that I can find are for the active audio device using osascript, which doesn't appear to let you specify specific hardware.\nI'm specifically looking to adjust the volume of something that /isn't/ the active output device, the same way I can manually do so by opening Audio MIDI Setup, selecting \"USB Audio Device\", and dragging the sliders.\n\nA: There is an NPM package with a CLI to do this: https://github.com/karaggeorge/macos-audio-devices\nBefore I found it, I have also found following, which still can be suitable if Node.js can not be used for some reason.\n\n*\n\n*There is a tool, likely not actively developed, to do this exactly: https://github.com/jonomuller/device-volume-adjuster.\n\n*There is a chance to adjust (get/set) volume of active output via AppleScript: osascript -e \"output volume of (get volume settings)\" to get and osascript -e \"set volume output volume ...\" to set.\n\n*There is a tool, under active development, to switch devices: https://github.com/deweller/switchaudio-osx.\n\nSo likely the proper solution could be to use (1), but it can require bringing (1) project back to life. May be it will work or build without any problems, I did not try.\nAnd the tricky solution, which sgould work without problems, but at the cost of temporary audio silencing, can be combining (2) and (3): use (3) to get active device, then to cwitch to another, then (2) to adjust volume, than again (3) to return back to initial device.\n", "Q: Unable to modify files directly even after changing permission Background:\nI have added an additional SSD to my iMac and made it the startup disk.

Old drive is still 'Mac OS extended (journaled)'\nGoal:\nI want to fix the permission of my files on secondary hard drive such that I can easily manipulate my old files\nWhat I have done:\nI used Cmd+I to bring up the Info dialog box, and give antkong (Me) the read & write permission. Then I used 'apply to the enclosed items...' option to apply the new permission to subfolder and files.\nIt seems to work for me because the stop badges (minus in a red circle) on subfolders are gone.\n\nProblem:\nI tried to delete some files in one of the subfolder. I still get prompted for the sudo password\n\nI expect that I can manipulate files as if I am the owner.\nWhy this happens? How can I fix this issue?\n\nA: The simplest method would be to check \"Ignore ownership on this volume\" \nGet Info on the drive itself rather than an individual folder.\nYou should see the checkbox at the bottom, available once you unlock the admin padlock.\n\n", "Q: Wifi network selection window won't close The network selection window that opens when you click the WIFI icon >> Join Other Network >> Show Networks, is stuck open. Clicking \"Cancel\" doesn't close it.\nHow could I fix this without restarting my mac? What process is responsible for that window? Can I (force) quit that process? Does it automatically restart, or do I have to manually restart it?\n\nA: You can use UIElementInspector (more info here) to find out a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff for individual windows or other elements of the macOS user interface.\nThis shows that the dialog you are referring to is part of SystemUIServer. You can simply Quit (no need to Force Quit) the SystemUIServer process using Activity Monitor.app and it will automatically restart thanks to launchd.\nSystemUIServer is responsible for the right side of the menu bar (menu extras/menulings) and a few other things.

The last files I interacted with are usually the ones I want to find quickly, but the column view in Finder only lets you sort by one criterion; (date added, date modified, date created etc.) at a time.  \nThe problem here is a file that I recently modified won't be at the top of the \"date added\" list, and one I just downloaded won't even show up on the \"date last opened\". I'm still coping with the loss of recent files thanks to High Sierra update.   \nIs it possible to sort columns by two criteria at the same time? For example, sort downloads folder by date added OR modified?   \nA decent example of what I'm looking for would be similar to the dropbox mobile app, where it sorts by date added, but recently opened files go to the top of that list. \n\nA: Yes for some categories. At the top of the finder window, towards the middle, is an icon that lets you choose how to sort window. If you choose date added it will sort on that and divide the window into groups based on date added. You can then go to the column headers and click on the size, for example. Finder maintains the groupings but sorts on the size within each group.\n", "Q: Localhost to custom page I am running macOS 10.12.5 and I am setting up a localhost and everything looks correct.  I used brew to install Apache (httpd), MySQL, and PHP.

This might have caused Apache to not load your config and serve the default virtualhost instead.\n", "Q: Prevent Mac WIFI from being deleted when I delete from iPhone When I add a WIFI network to my MacBook Pro, it is automatically synced with my iPhone. This is OK on some networks, but if I am using my laptop at a company that blocks certain ports, such as those for external email (e.g. Gmail), I don't want this to be blocked on my phone too.\nSo, I removed the WIFI network from my iPhone so I can get my email, but now my MacBook has also removed the network, which I need to do my job.\nIs there a way to prevent this from occurring? That is, can I have a WIFI network on my MacBook Pro and not have it on my iPhone?\n\nA: This exact issue has also been a thorn in my side, as I frequently do not want my iPhone on the office Wi-Fi network for one reason or another.\nA loophole that has been working for me lately (your milage may vary) is to forget the network in question from the iPhone, and then rejoin on the Mac. Its probably a bug, but I've found that I get several hours with the iPhone on cellular and my computer still on Wi-Fi this way. The phone does, unfortunately, rejoin the network once iCloud Keychain figures out what is going on and syncs up.\nThe only permanent solution I have found so far is to disable iCloud Keychain completely on the iPhone. That way, since the iPhone will not share passwords with your other devices, when you forget the Wi-Fi network on the iPhone the Mac will be unaffected.\nSince I quite like iCloud Keychain and use it frequently, I find this a less than satisfactory answer. However, it will result in the desired outcome here.\n\nA: In iOS 11 you can disable Auto-Join.\n\n\n*\n\n*Tap Settings > Wi-Fi.\n\n*Tap i next to the network name.\n\n*Make sure that Auto-Join is off.\n\n\nJoin Wi-Fi networks automatically https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204497\n", "Q: Some contact names missing from Messages, but initials still visible?

I've restarted my machine and of course Alfred 3.  This is the error I get in the debug panel:  [ERROR: action.script] osascript: no such component \"JavaScript\".\nI'm on OSX 10.12.5\n\nIf it helps, I actually submitted the question to Alfred first and they sent me here, see the original Alfred forum post:  https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/11058-osa-script-failing-for-javascript-all-the-sudden/?tab=comments#comment-57404\n\nA: For those who may experience this issue in the future, I was able to resolve the issue by deleting the /Users/your short name/Library/Preferences/com.apple.ScriptEditor2.plist file and rebooting.  I can only assume this file must have somehow become corrupted and it kept the JXA option from being accessible as a script type.\n\nA: TL;DR: If you've ever installed the 3rd-party Script Debugger app, delete the ~/Library/Components/Script Debugger.component folder it installs. This may immediately fix the problem (no reboot required).\nThis problem arose for me upon updating from Monterey to Ventura (13.2.1). Its manifestation was that my Alfred workflows using osascript failed to run. To diagnose that, I tried running them in Alfred's workflow debugger, and the \"no such component\" error appeared.\nJohn Schulz's solution—deleting ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.ScriptEditor2.plist—did not solve the problem for me. (I'll note that in other forums users have had success with this, but not all, so it's evidently a valid solution in some cases.)\nTo diagnose the problem, I listed the languages available to osascript:\n$ osalang -L\nasDB lns  cgxerv-h  AppleScript Debugger (AppleScript Debugger Scripting System)\nascr appl cgxervdh  AppleScript (AppleScript.)\njscr appl cgxe-v-h  AppleScript (AppleScript.)\nscpt appl cgxervdh  Generic Scripting System (Transparently supports all installed OSA scripting systems.)\n\nNote that jscr should be identified as JavaScript, not AppleScript. With that hint, more searching led to a suggestion to see if the language list changed with sudo. It did:\n$ sudo osalang -L\nPassword:\nascr appl cgxervdh  AppleScript (AppleScript.)\njscr appl cgxe-v-h  JavaScript (JavaScript)\nscpt appl cgxervdh  Generic Scripting System (Transparently supports all installed OSA scripting systems.)\n\nNote that jscr is correctly identified as JavaScript.\nWith this clue, further searching led me to this Apple developer community thread: osacompile: no such component \"App… | Apple Developer Forums. Multiple users there found that deleting a component folder installed by the 3rd-party Script Debugger app solved the problem.\nSpecifically, delete the ~/Library/Components/Script Debugger.component folder.\nWhen I did that (I also completely removed Script Debugger), osascript correctly identified its JavaScript component without requiring sudo permissions:\n$ osalang -L\nascr appl cgxervdh  AppleScript (AppleScript.)\njscr appl cgxe-v-h  JavaScript (JavaScript)\nscpt appl cgxervdh  Generic Scripting System (Transparently supports all installed OSA scripting systems.)\n\nMy Alfred  workflows immediately worked again (no reboot required).\nNote that a user in that Apple developer thread reported that launching Script Debugger after deleting the component recreated the component, but did not retrigger the bug. That user speculates an old version of the component had been left in place, with Script Debugger now replacing it with a fixed version.\n", "Q: Is there a way to remove custom ringtones from an iPhone without using a Mac or PC? This question has good answers on how to remove ringtones that one may have installed using iTunes on a Mac or PC.\nHowever, it appears to be possible for iPhone users who do not have a Mac or PC to create and install custom ringtones using the iOS Garageband app (see here and here).  Is it possible to remove those user-created custom ringtones from an iPhone (without having to find a Mac or PC with iTunes)?

The TV has HDMI ports and USB ports insofar as I can tell.\nThe laptop can't run AirPlay insofar as I can tell - it's running OS X Lion and is too old to upgrade.\nIs a USB/USB cable the recommended way of connecting the two devices in this case, or are there reasonably priced adapters to convert FireWire 400 to HDMI or something to that effect?\n\nA: \nIs a USB/USB cable the recommended way of connecting the two devices \n\nNo, not if you're trying to get the display of the laptop onto the TV. A USB port doesn't carry monitor signals.\n\nare there reasonably priced adapters to convert FireWire 400 to HDMI\n\nFirewire is also not a monitor signal. It can be used to transfer video information but afaik it's a completely different format to HDMI. I've not seen a device that converts firewire video to HDMI.\nFrom your given ports the only way I'm aware of connecting your laptop to your tv would be with a VGA to HDMI adapter. VGA to HDMI adapters do exist at a reasonable price point, eg. https://www.jaycar.com.au/vga-to-hdmi-with-audio-adapter-usb-powered/p/AC1719?utm_campaign=redirect&utm_source=AC1639r&utm_medium=web\nMaybe if you post the model of your laptop someone could confirm if it has a displayport capable of being adapted to HDMI. Not all displayport sockets can be converted to HDMI, even if the socket is electrically compatible with the adapter they still need to output the correct signal. \n\nA: Your Macbook should have a Mini-DVI port on it. What you need is a Mini-DVI to HDMI adapter like this one and then you connect with a normal HDMI cable.\nEdit: Note that this will not give you audio over HDMI. You will need to source the audio from your headphone jack and route it in some other way.\n", "Q: Reduce the storage space taken up by \"System\" on my iPhone 6s without restoring and setting up iPhone as new I have an iPhone 6s with iOS 11 and I have just noticed that a large amount of my iPhone's storage space being occupied by \"System\" (12.27 GB). \nI have tried the answers for the iPhone 4 explained in the question Why is so much \"Other\" space occupied on an iPhone 4? (except for factory resetting and setting the iPhone up as new as I need to keep my app data) however those did not solve the problem on my iPhone 6s. I have tried restarting and syncing with iTunes, but neither solved the problem.\n\n\nA: No need to backup or restore anything !\nI just spent some time with a good Apple Care advisors : this problem is caused by iCloud Drive. If you deactivate it, no more problem. It worked for me.\n\nA: This is a software issue. What I suggest is backing up your iPhone with iCloud backup (Settings -> Your Name -> iCloud -> iCloud Backup -> Backup Now - Unless it has already recently backed up), then make sure you get your wifi password and Apple ID password.\n***If your Apple account sends you verification codes all of the time you need to add another number to your account in Settings -> Your name (or iCloud) -> Password & Security -> Edit to add trusted phone number (you wont be able to get the code when you sign back in)>.\nAfter you've backed up. Sign out of iCloud, erase the iPhone (Settings -> General -> Reset -> Erase all Content And Settings) and then set up the phone, but restore from the iCloud backup. You'll need wifi, Apple ID account login (and a verification code from another trusted number if your account sends you verification codes). Once thats done the phone will look the same, messages, apps, photos, notes, calendar events, etc.\n\nA: The simple way to check is to have a backup of your data and then use settings to erase all content and settings.\nThat will restart the device. When it restarts - then check that no iCloud or other cloud data or accounts remain.\nIf you still have system large, then you need to do the thing you didn't want to - restore the device externally. If it does work, then add back your cloud accounts and then check that system didn't grow.\nOnce you're good there, you can either erase one final time and restore the backup or skip to go without your backup once you see what comes down from the cloud and what was lost when you did the first erase all content.\n\nA: So I found this to work.\nOpen settings\nGot to iCloud\nThen back up\nClick back up.\nWait for the back up to finish.\nThis will free up a couple of GB\n\nA: Try the following (taken from here)\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Settings > general> system storage > \n\n*Note the space used by certain messaging apps \n\n*Open Whatsapp > setting > manage > clear \n\n", "Q: Macintosh HD drive listing as Recovery Partition and it is not available to boot I just wanted to merge 2 NTFS drives because I want to increase size of my BootCamp partition.

My Macintosh HD (371GB) drive listed as \"Recovery Partition\"\n\nHow can I repair my main disk...\n\nA: Generally, the first step, in reconstructing messed up the partition tables, is to dump the current contents.\nIf running High Sierra (macOS 10.13), you would need to boot to internet, internal or USB based macOS Recovery. The following commands would partially dump the contents of the GPT and MBR partition table.\ngpt  -r  show  /dev/disk0\nfdisk  /dev/disk0\n\nThe partition tables can then be repaired by using a variety of tools. A well known third party tool is gdisk. \nSince you can only boot to Windows, the gpt and fdisk commands would be unavailable. There are third party Windows equivalents named readgpt.exe and readmbr.exe that can dump the contents of the partition tables. The syntax for executing these commands is shown below. \n\nNote: These commands have to be run from a \"Administrator: Command Prompt\" window.\n\nreadgpt  -t0\nreadmbr  -t0\n\nAdditionally, the following command will dump the GPT attributes.\nreadgpt  -a0\n\nThere also a Windows version of the gdisk command. Below is the syntax for executing this command from a \"Administrator: Command Prompt\" window.\ngdisk64  \\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE0\n\nIf you have trouble using the gdisk command, you can post the partition table information in your question and ask for help.\n", "Q: How can I stop Parallels Desktop from listing Apps from a VM available in Spotlight?

As an Automator script (which has to be callable from the Terminal, else that defeats the purpose somewhat)?\nAll things being equal, would slightly prefer a javascript flavor of the Automator script over AppleScript.\nenv:  MacOS Sierra\n\nA: Before I continue, allow me to apologise: I know you expressed a slight preference for Javascript over AppleScript.  However, my Javascript is pants, whilst I already know how to accomplish it using the latter, and it definitely provides one way to obtain image data from the clipboard straight from the command-line.\nThe following one-liner (spread over four lines just for ease of reading) will take the image from the clipboard and save it to a file with the name set as the current date and time, located in your present working directory:\n    osascript -e \"tell application \\\"System Events\\\" to ¬\n        write (the clipboard as JPEG picture) to ¬\n        (make new file at folder \\\"$(pwd)\\\" with properties ¬\n        {name:\\\"$(date +%Y-%m-%d\\ at\\ %H.%M.%S).jpg\\\"})\"\n\nIf you choose to use this method of mine, I suggest creating an alias/function to wrap it up inside of, which you can then just call by typing the function name +/- a parameter if you wanted to specify the filename manually (with a small tweak to the final part of the above command where the filename is declared).\nEDIT: I went ahead and wrote a shell script that does all this for you:\n    #!/bin/bash\n    # Filename: SaveMyScreenshot (executable)\n    # Author: CK 2017\n    # ----------------------------------------------------\n    # Takes a screenshot to the clipboard then saves the\n    # clipboard image to a file in jpeg format.\n    #\n    # Usage: SaveMyScreenshot [[path/]filename]\n    #\n    # If no filename is specified, the image will be saved\n    # to the present working directory and named using the\n    # current date and time.

Don't forget to comment out or delete the line in the script that takes the screenshot (screencapture -c).  I believe you have your own, preferred method of obtaining your screenshot, and I only put this in for my own testing purposes and for completeness in case anyone else might find this answer useful in a more general context.\n\nA: screencapture is a CLI tool built into macOS for taking screenshots, in /usr/sbin/screencapture.\nTo take a screenshot and save it to screenshot.png:\nscreencapture -x screenshot.png\n\nTo screenshot a region, you can use -R, where x,y are the coordinates of the top-left and w,h is width and height of the capture.\nscreencapture -x -Rx,y,w,h /path/to/capture.png\n\nTo interactively choose a region, use -i\nscreencapture -i screenshot.png\n\n\nA: Edit: Per comments, this answer didn’t work. Looks like the last time someone asked this someone else wrote a utility for it:\nWhat's the quickest way to get a graphic on the clipboard saved to disk? specifically this answer\nOriginal answer follows\n\nThere should be a terminal command \"pbpaste\" which you can redirect to a file.

The progress bar for recovery and safe mode looks the same as the normal progress bar—not sure if that's normal for Sierra but it seems strange, as if it's not really booting into safe mode or recovery mode.\nResetting NVRAM (Cmd+Option+P+R) and SMC (disconnecting power for 30 seconds) didn't help.\nBooting while pressing Option gets me to the partition selection. There, I can choose between my normal boot drive (256 GB SSD with the OS), my Windows 8 partition and the recovery partition. Booting to Windows results in a black screen right before the login screen would normally appear. Booting to the recovery partition results in a white screen.\nBooting in verbose mode (Cmd+V while booting) rushed through a wall of text seemingly normal before getting stuck on white screen again when—I would assume—the login screen would have shown normally.\nI was able to enter Apple Hardware Test once by pressing D during boot, but it appeared to be stuck after a while, so I didn't let it finish. If I'm holding down D now while booting, the machine enters Internet Recovery Mode, same when I hold down Cmd+Option+R. Entering Internet Recovery Mode produced the -6003F and -6003D errors once each. After that it got to the progress bar and the estimated time remaining, but appeared to get stuck (time remaining was 24 hours and not moving, same for the progress bar). When I tried again, it got stock on the \"Starting Internet Recovery / This may take a while\" screen (unless it might take an hour in which case I might have ended it prematurely).\nI was able to start the machine up in Target Disk Mode (T during boot) after connecting my MacBook via Thunderbolt 2. I was to able to completely mirror both, the iMac's SSD (OS disk) and the HDD. No files seem to be corrupted.\nCurious detail 1: When trying to boot either normally, into safe mode or into recovery mode and the white screen interrupts the progress bar, in that moment the screen brightness is slightly dimmed.\nCurious detail 2: The chime sound was notably quieter for all the boot attempts until I reset the NVRAM. The first of the two chime sounds that play during that procedure were still quiet, the third one was at normal volume again.\nCurious detail 3: All built-in LEDs of my Matias Tactile Pro keyboard (1. caps lock, 2. the key that would be num lock on a Windows keyboard and 3. F14) light up for a few seconds immediately after turning on the iMac. After a few seconds they turn off again. When the iMac was operating normally this never happened.\nQuestion: Is it safe to assume that something inside is fried and there'll be no way around a visit and repair at the Apple store?\nEdit: I guess one remaining option is trying to boot from a flash drive. Will try that if it turns out that Internet Recovery really is stuck when I check its status again tomorrow.\n\nEdit 2: As per klanomath's suggestion in the comments, I tried booting the iMac from the MacBook's OS disk via TDM and vice versa. When the MacBook is in TDM and I select its OS disk as the disk to boot the iMac from, it does the progress bar into white screen charade on the iMac. When the iMac is in TDM and I try to boot the MacBook from the iMac's OS disk, the MacBook's screen stays dark after the chime sound. It doesn't even get to the disk selection screen while holding Alt. Also, it takes considerably longer (12 to 20 seconds roughly) for the chime sound to play on the MacBook after turning it on when the iMac is connected via Thunderbolt while the iMac is in TDM. Without the two being connected (or when the iMac is turned off), the chime sound plays after maybe 3 to 5 seconds after turning on the MacBook. \n\nA: It's very likely to be the video card. There was a repair extension program (since expired) for the AMD GPUs in 27\" 2011 iMacs. They will boot to the Apple logo/progress bar and then hang at a white screen or pink/green lines.\nIf you're near an Apple Store at all you should take it in or at the very least call Apple and do some troubleshooting. Stores in most of the US (except California, where the timeframe is quite a bit longer) will not carry parts for the 2011 iMacs much longer, likely stopping as soon as a few weeks from now since its been about 5 years since they were discontinued in all markets.\n", "Q: How do I uninstall the command line tools for Xcode?

If you desire merely a working Chrome, reinstall it and hope that all will go better.  \nIf you want more than that, then let us explore what tracing and profiling can tell us.

One of the steps in the migration said \"identifying incompatible software.\"\nSome applications have a gray slashed circle over them, while others (like OmniGraffle 4) just crash instantly on launch. \nWhat causes some applications to be preidentified as incompatible while other simply fail to work?\n\nA: \nWhat causes some applications to be pre-identified as incompatible\n  while other simply fail to work?\n\nIt all depends.  Some binaries are compiled with a flag that indicates which is the minimum OS version it will run on.  There's also the Info.plist that contains minimum OS versions.  Finally, the application itself can check to see if it will run on a particular OS version.\nUnfortunately, older apps like OmniGraffe 4 which was released back in 2005 probably don't use any of the version checking (and is incompatible) which is why it crashes when launched.\n", "Q: How to restore deleted files from an internal HDD which has just undergone a full disk format?

This should fix the problem.\nIf that doesn’t work, I’d suggest trying a Chrome reinstall.\nIf a Chrome reinstall doesn’t do it, I’d try reinstalling macOS.\n\nA: Here is how to fix it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Finder, go to Applications, locate Google Chrome, then right click and choose Get Info.\n\n\n*Click on the icon at the top left\n\n\n*Press Cmd+C and then Cmd+V (Copy then Paste), it may ask your pw to make changes.\n\n*Exit get info window, and restart google chrome. It should be back to normal.\n\n", "Q: Strange characters in Console .awd reports Anyone knows what causes this behavior?\nIn Console > system reports all .awd reports have characters like this\n— ÕÖÖ,$90F31FE5-04CE-99A7-86EA-0E99D6B9ADA8 (í0�:\nMacmini6,2B16G1036ZUser`êhz áŸˇåÖ,(ÅÄ$0îäÄ† ÜŸˇåÖ,z- àŸˇåÖ,(¢Ä$0yíÇ†áŸˇåÖ,ÄÄ� �(�0�8ÅÇÑ¯@�zû ö€ˇåÖ,(âÄ$0t Ä†ãô€ˇåÖ,…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ…ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ �(�0�8\n@HéPZ�FÄ�à�ê�ò�†�®�Ä�à�ê�ò�†�Ä�z- ∫ˇåÖ,(¢Ä$0yíÇ†∫ˇåÖ,ÄÄ� �(�0\n8ÅÇÑ¯@zw Ä¯ÆÈÑ,(Ñ‡05äÄ† Ä¯ÆÈÑ,⁄Ä†   Ä¯ÆÈÑ,�ÍÄ†Ä¯ÆÈÑ,�¿`Ë-ﬁ@¢Ä†2(0�R���·øAR\náÄ���\nÔNøAXÄ¯ÆÈÑ,`�hpx�Ä�\n\n\nA: This behavior is caused by the Console app attempting to read the .awd binary data as text.

I really like Time Machine for local backups, but I'd also like to have a cloud backup of everything on my local disk.  What's the best way to get full, versioned incremental backups of my machine, to the cloud?\nThe obvious solutions do not fulfil this seemingly simple goal:\n\n\n*\n\n*BackBlaze is convenient and works well but doesn't back up anything outside of /Users/—and even then has undocumented exclusions such as not backing up empty directories, symlinks, etc.\n\n*iDrive also has various (but at least better documented) mandatory exclusions including /System and /etc.  They advertise disk image backups, but this is a Windows-only feature; when I contacted iDrive support they suggested I use the iDrive app to backup my local Time Machine drive.  That would work but means I have to carry around an extra hard drive (or NAS box!) just to do cloud backups, which is lame.  (iDrive is also a resource hog, making my system unusably slow when it is running, even when it's not saturating the network connection.)\nIdeally I'd just like to configure TimeMachine to backup to a cloud-provided network share, but I suspect that this might be terribly slow (and prone to corruption due to network disconnects) even if I could find a provider offering SMB-mountable cloud storage.\nIs there a solution that provides Time Machine levels of convenience and protection without needing a local disk?\n\nA: CrashPlan (here) or self-host and use Arq (here).\n\nA: ChronoSync supports Amazon S3 and Google Cloud services.  And the developer claims that support for Backblaze and other cloud services, is coming soon.\n", "Q: No developer folder I bought a new MacBook Pro and installed Xcode but I don't have the developer folder.

That seemed to let me get around the \"Unknown Error = -2,147,414,007\".\n\nA: I received this error on one of my users computers after he updated to Mojave against my suggestions. \nThe end result for the certificate issue was keeping my user from connecting to our employee wifi. \nI followed Danis's instructions from 12/15/17 but the terminal commands didn't work and my company uses a certificate from a CA server, so the details were a little different. I did enable the root user though. \nFinally I deleted our employee wifi out of the network settings, manually rejoined the Employee wifi and changed the security settings back to EAP-TLS, choosing the correct certificate, and it connected. \nI wish I had recorded my steps better for this but I'm assuming Apple updated some of their network security and it was the wifi connection settings that actually did the trick.  \n\nA: Disclaimer: Keychain Access is rarely behaving as expected.\nAdmittedly, the following answer is a workaround as it creates both a CSR and a new set of associated keys.\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Keychain Access, unlock it, select Login (but do not select anything else)\n\n\n*In the Keychain Access menu\nCertificate Assistant ▶︎ Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority...  \n\n\n*Pick the email address to be associated with both the CSR and the key pair.  \n\n\n*\n\n*The key pair will be named in Keychain Access according to the Common Name  \n\n*Tick Let me specify the key pair information (which you will do in a subsequent dialog)\n\n\n\n*Save the Certificate Signing request\n\n\n*Specify key size & algorithm\nRSA 2048 bits\n\n\n*Check your new set of keys in Keychain Access\nNotice that the Login section now contains a new pair...\n\n...and that you didn't encounter the “Unknown Error = -2,147,414,007” on creating certificate with Certificate Assistant.\n\nA: For MacOS Big Sur, I can confirm that following honey_badger's comment on the question works.

Here's his comment:\n\nPerforming all the steps in section 1 of GDB Permissions Darwin resolved the issue for me on macOS Catalina (Version 10.15.4) for GDB 9.1.\n\n\nA: Before you create a certificate, you should unlock the lock on System.

I want to buy and external monitor for my MacBook 13 inch 2015. What I want is the monitor to have the same clarity as I have on my Macbook.   \nI am not very familiar with the resolutions, I just know I want \"retina\" clarity. \nWill any 4K will do ? Or do I need a 5K monitor ? \n\nA: To get the same clarity as a 13.3 inch MacBook with 2560‑by‑1600 native resolution, you would need 227 PPI (pixel per inch).\nPPI is simply calculated using:\n\nwhere p = pixels and i = inches.\nFor example, consider a 24-inch monitor with resolution 4096x2160 (4K). This monitor has about 193 PPI, which is still not as dense as a retina display, however the difference would be negligible to the naked eye.\nTo be pedantic, you would need a resolution of 5120x2880 (5K) on 24-inch (~245 PPI) or 27-inch (~218 PPI) monitors to be better or near retina clarity\n\nA: 720, 1080, 4K or 5K are all measures that imply the \ntotal pixel count of the display. \nRetina is a marketing term that describes a pixel density that is high enough that an average user in normal conditions cannot see the individual pixels. \nThe short answer is you can go 4K up to about 25\" but by the time you get to 27\", the pixel density of a 4K monitor starts to get too low to be considered retina. 25\"-27\"+ you need to start looking at 5K monitors to get retina pixel density. \nI use a 24\" LG Ultra HD (24UD58-B) and I smile each time I sit at the computer because it looks so good and the price was right. \nHope that helps!\n\nA: You have a 2015 MacBook Pro 13\"\nFrom the specs listed here we can see that the built-in display is a 2560 by 1600 pixels with 227 pixels per inch. It is listed as a Retina display.\nYour MacBook has a high pixel density, but is not itself 4k or 5k.\nYour computer can support one display via the Thunderbolt 2 port.\nIt can support one external display via the HDMI port.\nHere are the limitations:\nIt can support a single display up to 3840x2160 via Thunderbolt 2 and a single 1080p display at up to 60 Hz, 3840x2160 at 30 Hz, or 4096x2160 at 24 Hz via HDMI.\nGiven that information, you could support a 4k monitor. You cannot support a 5k monitor.\nPersonally, I would not dwell too heavily on all of this technical information.\nFirst, choose the size monitor you are most interested in. Go to a store and decide on a 25\", 27\", 30\", etc. Whichever feels right. Then once you've nailed that down, purchase a QHD (2560 x 1440) or 4K monitor. I have personally used a QHD (2560 x 1440) monitor with a 2015 and 2017 15\" Retina MacBook Pro and it works great with both. Visually, the external monitor is very similar to the actual built-in display of the MacBook.\nHere's a list of 4K monitors that are similar to the actual 4K Mac monitor.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How to make Alfred switch to currently open Chrome instead of opening a new window?

It turned to be fixed with a Chrome update.\n\nA: Hmm.

First, because trying to work with partially-downloaded files is a good way to get yourself into trouble. Depending on how the programs you want to use on the file work, they may or may not cope with having the file modified as they're trying to use it. A media player, for example, might check the file's integrity before playing it, and refuse to play a damaged file. Or it might note the file's length (when it opens it) and assume that's the length it'll always have. Or it might read the entire file into memory (as it exists when opened) and then play that without going back to see if it's gotten longer. Or... lots of things might go wrong.\nThe other problem is that that .download file is not actually the partially-downloaded file. It's a Finder package: a folder with hidden contents that the Finder treats as a regular file. You can see its contents by Control-clicking (or right-clicking) on the .download file, and choosing Show Package Contents from the shortcut menu. Inside it, you'll see an Info.plist file with information about the download (you can select it and press Command-Y to see the info in XML format). You'll also see the partially-downloaded file, under its regular name.\nIf you really want to do something with the partially-downloaded file, that file inside the .download package is what you want, and it's already going to have the correct name. But again, I don't recommend this for the reasons in the first paragraph.\n", "Q: \"Open with\" equivalent on Mac I have a very simple problem and I thought the solution would be simple.

As we all know, the MacBook and MacBook Pro do not have Ethernet ports.\nApple makes a Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter (which requires no driver), but with the change to USB Type-C, this is no longer an option without an additional adapter.\nNow Apple sells a USB-C Ethernet adapter made by Belkin, but according to the reviews it appears it requires a 3rd-party driver. I've also looked around on Google about this and other adapters, and I'm getting conflicting information on support for Ethernet over USB without 3rd-party drivers.\nDoes macOS have the ability to support USB Ethernet adapters without 3rd-party drivers, or is searching for one a wild goose chase?\n\nA: Yes - the vast majority of ethernet adapters work - especially USB-C since they are generally very new, a little more pricey and use fairly standard types of control chips and usb chips.\nThe Belkin you listed is both plug and play when the OS is booted, it also works at netboot from the hardware / EFI / firmware so it's truly driverless on the new Mac.\n\n*\n\n*https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HJKF2ZM/A/belkin-usb-c-to-gigabit-ethernet-adapter\nI personally am liking the Belkin adapters and all the thunderbolt 3 dock stations from the likes of OWC / Belkin / Elgato as well. Tripp lite and some others are on the market - but I've not had great durability of Tripp in a work setting, so the cost savings there aren't panning out over time over the higher end products for us. Light home use might be perfectly fine with less pricey adapters so YMMV.\nAlso - a general guideline if Apple is selling the adapters in their stores - they are likely best of the best. If they are selling them online, chances are they are best of the best or at least very good fit and need no drivers either.\n", "Q: Mac app icons became blank I don't know exactly when, but some of my app icons became blank and some keep toggling between normal and blank.

I've made a macOS thumb drive with the newest version but I haven't done this on mac before and I don't know how to restore the data.

There are some apps that allow logging in via Touch ID (for instance banking apps).\nI know that it is relatively secure to use this feature as long as no-one has illicit access to my fingerprints, and the device is not physically accessed.\nBut what if the database of the application gets compromised?\nWhat kind of information will be leaked? What sort of actions could be taken having this information? Does iOS protect this information from being leaked? Is this documented somewhere?\nI can guess that the application will not be given direct access to the finger-print photo, there should be some kind of hash which doesn't allow restoring the original finger-print. In the ideal case, iOS would not even allow the app to access a hash, instead it would provide some way of authorizing.\n\nA: The application does not have access to the fingerprint data stored on the device. The API provided by Apple tells the app if the auth process was successful by a simple yes/no value. No hash is provided. Here's the documentation.\nAlso the fingerprint data is stored in the device's \"Secure Enclave\" and is not accessible. \n\nThe Secure Enclave is part of the A7 and newer chips used for Touch ID. Within the Secure Enclave, the fingerprint data is stored in an encrypted form which - according to Apple - can only be decrypted by a key available by the Secure Enclave thus making fingerprint data walled off from the rest of the A7 Chip and the rest of iOS.\n\nSource: The iPhone Wiki\n\nA: Yes - it's totally safe.\nYour Touch ID data is stored locally on your device and isn't accessible by Apple or any other 3rd parties.\nWhen you use Touch ID for a 3rd party app for example, it will authorise your access locally and the app will not see your fingerprint data, only that your iPhone has authorised it.\nI personally use Touch ID for my PayPal app as well as a few other trustable services.\n(If you're worried, maybe don't use it for companies you don't fully trust - even though it's physically impossible for them to see your Touch ID data.)\n\nA: Yes, it is perfectly safe to use Touch ID on iPhone.\nApps that uses Touch ID does not have access to your fingerprint, nor any hash generated from your fingerprint. The app does not actually process the fingerprint matching itself, rather, it calls the Touch ID API (system) which will then send the result back to the app. So, all the app will receive is either true or false, depending on whether it is successful.\nThus, the app does not need to have access to any kind of hash and the whole Touch ID process is done by your iPhone's system (iOS), similar to how you unlock your phone with Touch ID.\nAs 9to5mac explains:\n\nWhen a developer wants an app user to authenticate, they don’t get involved in the nitty-gritty of how that authentication is performed. They just use code that asks iOS to do it for them – what Apple calls the Local Authentication framework.\n(emphasis mine)\n\nAnd AppleInsider explains:\n\nApple has kept Touch ID secure by not providing apps access to any of the fingerprint data stored on an iPhone's secure enclave. The prompt that appears is the same as the one Apple already uses to authorize iTunes and App Store purchases.\n(emphasis mine)\n\n", "Q: I want to add the home directory to the favorites directories, how can I do it?

I'm an avid Excel user and recently I've had to figure out how to use Numbers. So far I've been able to replicate all the Excel functionality that I use in Numbers... except for one thing. \nIn Excel I can add the following formula...\n=IF(A1=\"\", \"\", IF(B1=\"\", NOW(), B1))\n\nThis formula says when a value in added to cell A1 populate cell B1 with the current date. To get this to work you must turn on an Excel feature named iterative calculation (Options==>Formulas==>Enable iterative calculation).\nI use this when I'm building an Excel task journal and I want to auto-populate the date. \nThe important thing about this formula is that the date value is not updated another change is made. \nHow can I do this in Numbers? How can I auto populate a date value in column \"B\" when a value is set in column \"A\"? It's important to keep in mind that once the date is set I don't want it to change.  \nHere is my attempt at translating this formula in Numbers...\n=IF(A2=\"\", \"\", IF(B2=\"\", NOW(), B2))\n\nI get an error message in Numbers...\nThis formula can't reference its own cell, or depend on another formula that references this cell.\n\nThanks\n\nA: Unfortunately, even if you were able to reference your own cell in Numbers, there is no assignment operator. \nMeaning that there would be no way to override the current value of the cell. \n\nA: I offer this answer only because at least it provides a workaround, albeit a slightly manual one.\nAssuming that B1 is the cell that needs to have the date and time auto-populated when cell A1 is filled in, enter this formula in cell B1:\nIF(ISBLANK($A1),\"\",NOW())\n\nNow, when the time comes that cell A1 is filled in, cell B1 will auto-populate with the date and time.\nHowever, to prevent cell B1 from updating if/when cell A1 is edited again, you now need to do as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*After B1 is populated, select cell B1\n\n*Use commandC (or go to Edit > Copy) to copy the cell\n\n*Use shiftcommandV (or go to Edit > Paste Formula Results)\n\n*Now the formula in cell B1 is replaced with the calculated value only, thereby meaning it will no longer calculate in future\n\n\nNOTES:\nIn case this is useful for anyone else trying to come up with an answer, I also thought of:\n\n\n*\n\n*using an AppleScript script to replicate the above, but then realised that using a script would be no quicker that just using the Copy/Paste functionality within Numbers. \n\n*creating an Automator service and then allocating a keyboard shortcut to that, but that too would be no quicker as you'd still need to select the cell, so using the built-in shiftcommandV shortcut is no slower than using a customisable shortcut.\nRegardless, someone more adept at AppleScript may think of a more elegant solution that works with Numbers to achieve the OP's goal.\n", "Q: Apps won’t download or install on iPhone My iPhone won’t download apps from the App Store. They say loading under them and it never starts downloading or installing. At first I thought this was a problem with my internet but I tried downloading small apps (around 70-100 MB) with data and on different WiFi hotspots but I still had the issue. What is this problem and how can I fix it?      \n(iPhone 6S with iOS 11)\n\nA: Restart the iPhone 1st. Most of the time that encourages it to look for the network. How you know if it works is if 1 app is updating. If you have folders you'll need to look for that app and see if its in a pie like circle and is moving. If non of that occurs then delete the apps and then reinstall them (I'd do a backup 1st). If you cant reinstall them then sign out of iCloud and then sign back in. Reseting network settings is a good idea as well but you will need to know your password for wifi.\nIf none of that is beneficial then the last resort is to back up your iPhone with iCloud backup (Settings -> Your Name -> iCloud -> iCloud Backup -> Backup Now - Unless it has already recently backed up), then make sure you get your wifi password and Apple ID password.\n***If your Apple account sends you verification codes all of the time you need to add another number to your account in Settings -> Your name (or iCloud) -> Password & Security -> Edit to add trusted phone number (you wont be able to get the code when you sign back in)>.\nAfter you've backed up.

You can add an address and ship it to that location. \nIf you can't locate it, call Apple Support and they can assist you very easily with a screenshare.\n\nA: I don‘t think you can do this with iPhoto/Photos.

The Macbook pro is a late 2013 and it's like a $500+ repair. Do you think it's worth replacing or should I just buy a new machine? Also, is the CPU the same as the logic board?\n\nA: It's worth paying $500 to fix a 2013 MacBook Pro, because you should be able to sell it for more than $500 if it's in working order.

The back of my iPad says A1395 16 GB, which means it's the \"iPad 2 (Wi-Fi)\" from 2011 according to Apple. It's running iOS 9.1.\n\nA: The only practical thing that might help is if your battery is failing - putting in a new one might pep up the processor.\nThe actual browser is going to be hard to make faster and jailbreaking and running another OS is going to be likely far less optimized than iOS 9 is already for that architecture.\nYour main help for browsing websites quickly would be to select websites that don't use javascript much or block that from running and consume text / html / light css.\n", "Q: In itunes connect, can the app seller be different than the name on the associated bank account?

Make sure this is correct to avoid any issues with your payments. If you’re not sure what name your bank has on file, check a recent bank statement or ask your bank.\n\nMy only recommendation would be to have a written contract with your friend lining out whatever agreement you have with them. Your entering banking information to Apple is a legal agreement, so you'll have a hard time getting any money back should you ever expect that once Apple pays the bank account you elected. As long as you control the account, you can update the bank (subject to 24 hours or more delay of course when you elect a change) but you'd likely not be able to claw back or get relief if you don't intend for them to get all the proceeds.\nYou would certainly be in hot water once the taxes are due on these funds since you are the seller no matter which bank receives the funds.

MacOS 10.13.2 (17C88)\nBackupdb is three times the size of the used space on the internal drive.\nWhen there are lots of hardlinks in something (as there are in TM backups), does 'du' count every link, or does it count the actual file once?\nIt seems likely that it is actually reading the files and counting bytes, because it takes a LONG time for large files.  And a hard-link could point to a directory outside of the one being measured.  (But that shouldn't happen when measuring the entire backupdb.)\nOther questions discuss reasons 'du' and 'df' might differ, but the ones I've read so far have reasons other than hard-links.\nI expect a Backupdb to get larger with every backup, but I'm trying to figure out how much space I need to relocate it.\n\nA: From man du:\n\nFiles having multiple hard links are counted (and displayed) a single time per du execution.\nDirectories having multiple hard links (typically Time Machine backups) are counted a single time\n       per du execution.\n\nFrom man df:\n\nThe df utility displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on the specified\n       filesystem or on the filesystem of which file is a part.\n\nSo assuming both man pages are correct neither utility should count hard linked things twice.\n", "Q: Keyboard Shortcut For Replacing File Within Finder? Lets say that I just captured a screenshot called \"screenshot.jpg\" and I have a folder of screenshots called \"screenshots\". \nScreenshots\n └ Work.jpg\n └ School.jpg\n └ Misc.jpg\n\nI want to take this recently captured screenshot and replace the \"misc.jpg\" file within the screenshot folder. What is the best way to do this? I know that I can rename the file to the name of the file currently within the folder, copy+paste it into the folder, and then choose \"replace file\" option when prompted, but this isn't ideal. Is there a keyboard shortcut or other quick way to perform this action?\nNote: This is just an example use case. It would be ideal if I could use a quick method regardless of filename or filetype.\n\nA: This little AppleScript will take a screen shot and overwrite whatever file you currently have selected in Finder.  \n    # Check that precisely one file is selected \n    set F to the selection of application \"Finder\" as list\n    if (count F) ≠ 1 then return beep\n\n    set F to F's first item as alias\n\n    # Perform a screengrab straight to the clipboard\n    # then overwrite the file above with the image\n    # data from the clipboard\n\n    do shell script \"screencapture -c\"\n    set screenshot to the clipboard as JPEG picture\n\n    write screenshot to (F as alias)\n\nIt doesn't move, copy, or delete; simply overwrites it.  So, bear in mind, this means the created date will remain the same, which potentially could see you generating a new screen shot writing it to an image file created two years ago.  (The modified date gets updated as you would expect.)\nAs someone suggested, this sort of thing would work well as a service in Finder, to which you could assign a shortcut.\nI went about creating one:\n\nThe script is very similar to one above (and appended to the bottom of this answer in a code block for you to copy/paste).  It has some error handling and notifications thrown in, given that this is going to be a service and it's good to make it a robust one.  It also doesn't take any screen shot of its own accord, as a screen shot taken when the service is activated would necessarily have Finder in focus, which might not be the screen shot you want.\nTherefore, this service assumes that you have taken the screenshot yourself already, and its lying in wait on the clipboard.  Finder already has shortcuts that allow screenshots to be sent straight to the clipboard, so there's no need to do anything extra.\nI saved the service as one called Replace Image File, as you'll notice the input is specifically image files in Finder.  Therefore, the service won't be accidentally triggered if, say, an application file were selected.\nIt now turns up in the pop-up context menu whenever I right-click on an image in Finder:\n\nNext, I went into System Preferences to assign a keyboard shortcut:\n\nThis shortcut shows up in the Finder menu under Services:\n\nI chose ⌃⇧⌘R because it's reasonably difficult to press accidentally, but it's pretty adjacent to the default shortcuts for sending a screenshot straight to clipboard, namely ⌃⇧⌘3 and ⌃⇧⌘4, meaning the physical manoeuvre between taking a screenshot and triggering the service a convenient one to make.\nHappy to say that, in testing, it worked splendidly, so I may just keep it for myself as I can see it being fairly useful.\nFinally, here's the code block for the Automator service workflow:\n    on run {input, parameters}\n\n        # Make sure precisely one file is passed to the service\n        # Otherwise terminate with a beep\n        if (count input) is not 1 then return beep\n\n        # Error catching in the event that the clipboard\n        # does not contain image data \n        try\n            set ImageData to the clipboard as JPEG picture\n        on error errMsg number errNo\n            # Terminate script with a notification\n            return display notification ¬\n                \"No image content found.  Unable to proceed.\" with title ¬\n                \"Replace Image File\" subtitle ¬\n                \"Error: clipboard content is the wrong data type\"\n        end try\n\n        # If the script reaches this point, all must be\n        # well so we can try and overwrite the input file\n        try\n            write ImageData to input\n        on error errMsg number errNo\n            return display notification ¬\n                \"Unsuccessful overwriting.\" with title ¬\n                \"Replace Image File\" subtitle ¬\n                (\"Error \" & errNo as text) & \": \" & errMsg\n        end try\n\n    end run\n\n", "Q: Meld: How to open /usr [Mac OS 10.13.2, Meld 3.19.0]\nAfter choosing either File or Folder comparison, when I click the button to choose a file/folder and select the root folder (label of the drive mounted as /), the selection of folders is limited to:  \nApplications\nLibrary\nmounts (I've changed permissions for this)\nSystem\nUser Information\nUsers\n\nHowever, because none of the other folders are listed, I cannot select /usr.

(Sprint) I'm trying to sell my phone on eBay but they returned it and said the issue was that the ESN was locked. What does that mean and how can I fix it?

In the macOS Photos app, select one or more photos and then choose > File > Export > Export 1 Photo. A popup dialog appears with options for the exported image:\n\nAccept the defaults then choose Export, at which time a second dialog appears asking where the images should be stored. This also applies if you use the keyboard shortcut shift-command-E.\nThis is a bit of a pain when exporting lots of images in a session, especially since I always take the default options on both dialogs.\nAre there any options or tricks for avoiding these dialogs, or at least removing the first dialog (perhaps via a default export setting)?\nAs an example, in Adobe Lightroom there is the ability to create an Export Preset, which doesn't require any confirmation or interaction. Lightroom can also Export With Previous which also doesn't require further confirmation after the first time it's used. Is anything like this available in macOS Photos?\n\n\nA: As I mentioned in a comment, anytime I have something repetitive to do, I script it in one form or another, and this is how I handle your scenario.\nIn Automator, create a new Service workflow with the following settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*Service receives no input in Photos\nAdd a Run AppleScript action.\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace the default code with the following example AppleScript code:\nset thisLocation to (path to desktop)\n\ntell application \"Photos\"\n    set theseItems to selection\n    if theseItems is not {} then\n        -- # Remove the '--' from in front of 'with' to export the original files.\n        export theseItems to thisLocation -- with using originals \n    else\n        display dialog \"No files were selected to export!\" buttons {\"OK\"} ¬\n            default button 1 with title \"Nothing To Do\" with icon 1\n    end if\nend tell\n\nSave the Automator Service workflow, e.g.: Export Selected Files\nAssign a keyboard shortcut for it, in:\nSystem Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services > General\n\n\n*\n\n*Example: Export Selected Files       ⌃⌘E\nNow in Photos, after having selected the file(s) to export, press ⌃⌘E and the selection is exported to the Desktop. No need to deal with multiple dialog boxes as when pressing ⇧⌘E.\nObviously this is just example AppleScript code and while thisLocation is set to the Desktop, nonetheless it can be set wherever you'd like, where the folder already exists. It just has to be in the form of an alias if not using any of the folder constant path to (folder) locations e.g.:\nset thisLocation to alias \"Macintosh HD:Temp:\"\nAlso, on a side note, Automator offers a number of different actions for Photos and those along with other actions provided can make for nice solutions to some repetitive tasks.\n\nNote: As stated, this is just example AppleScript code and can be modified as needed beyond modifying the value of thisLocation, as wanted, e.g. adding with using originals at the end of export theseItems to thisLocation, or other code as wanted. The onus is upon the User to add any error handling that may be appropriate and or necessary.\nWhen using a Run AppleScript action in Automator, you may find it handy to test your AppleScript code in Script Editor, where you'll have access to the AppleScript Dictionary for Photos, in the Library available from the Window menu, or press ⇧⌘L in Script Editor.\n\nA: Perhaps not the best answer, but in case there are no better alternatives...\nI just drag them to the desktop [or open folder] which saves the current edited version, no dialog required.\nMulti-selections work, as well as single items.\n", "Q: iOS 11: Voice Control doesn't get turned off completely I recently updated my iPhone 6s from iOS 10 to iOS 11.2. \nTogether with the update the device started really annoying me by turning on Voice Control on headset button press. It gets turned on approximately in 30% of the cases. May be it reacts on a longer presses, but anyway I'd better turn this off. \nI used to use this button to play/pause music and it worked perfectly with iOS 10. I also didn't change my habits - I press it in exactly the same way like I did it before. \nVoice Control itself is turned off on my device. I used the \"Turn off Voice Control on your iPhone\" article from the apple documentation to ensure I did it properly.\nThere is also quote in the documentation:\n\nIf you're using a headset, and it unexpectedly activates Siri or Voice Control, make sure that your headset is fully inserted into the device.\n\nBut it is not my case - the headset is fully inserted. I'm also using the headset provided with the device.\n\nA: Disable \"Siri & Dictation\" in restrictions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to Settings > General > Restrictions.\n\n*Enable restrictions and set a passcode if you haven't already. Otherwise, enter your restrictions passcode. \n\n*Disable \"Siri & Dictation\".\n\n\nA: I had the same problem with iOS 12 / iPhone X. Every time I tried to start/stop my music, Siri was activated when I pressed the headphone button a millisecond longer then normal. I even deactivated Siri in my settings!\nSo I activated Siri and noticed, there was another language/voice set than the one who appeared when I pressed the button. \nThe solution was to deactivate Siri with the exact voice/language setting, which was used when Siri showed up the whole time. \n\nA: I get this issue as well, but only with certain earbuds. I’m pretty sure it’s an issue with the headset or earbuds and there’s nothing you can do on the phone to fix it, currently.

Edit: it's visible in Finder, hence a different problem than described in other questions.\nEdit: When I try to boot to Win from Startup Disk, the computer froze on first attempt. On second attempt, it displayed \"no bootable device - insert disk and press any key\".\nI run OS X 10.13.2. Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!\n/Johan\nEdit: the disk is a \"fusion drive\".\nEdit: As a (at least temporary) solution, would it be possible to roll back the system using Time Machine, to before the High Sierra uppgrade?\nEdit: I solved the issue by simply removing the bootcamp partition, starting from scratch with a new Win 10 installation. However, the Win installation failed several times. The installer wouldn't accept the bootcamp partition. After some googling I did a PRAM-reset, which did the trick. I don't know if this was caused by my original problem with the missing partition.\nThanks for the replies and suggestions, guys!\n\nA: I do not yet have enough information to diagnose your problem. However, I can offer an solution to one possible scenario that fits what you have posted.\nI assume you started with a previous version of Windows, say Windows 7. At some point you upgraded to Windows 10. If this is true, the you would have been using the legacy BIOS boot method, which requires a hybrid GPT/MBR partitioning scheme.\nIt is possible the macOS upgrade converted a Hybrid partition scheme back to a pure GPT scheme. In this case, you problem is a duplicate of How to convert a drive from the GPT format to the hybrid GPT/MBR format when using High Sierra (macOS 10.13.2).\nBefore implementing any solution, I would start by determining whether your Mac is trying to boot Windows using the legacy BIOS or the newer EFI boot method.\nThis can be done by executing the following steps.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open \"Startup Disk\" under \"System Preferences\".\n\n*Unlock if necessary.\n\n*Select the icon labeled Windows. Do not restart the computer.\n\n*Quit \"System Preferences\"\n\n*Open a Terminal application window.\n\n*Enter the command given below.\nbless  --info  --getBoot  --verbose  2>&1  |  grep  -i  legacy\n\n\n*If you are using a legacy BIOS boot method, then the output should appear similar to what is shown below.\nLegacy mode suppported\nBoot option is a legacy device\nSearching for legacy type 'HD'\nLegacy mode suppported\nLegacy mode suppported\nMatching legacy device 'disk0s4'\nLegacy boot device detected\n\nIf you are using the newer EFI boot method, then the command will produce no output.\n\n*Repeat steps 1 through 4, except select icon with label indicating the volume you have currently booted from. \nIf you post the output from the the command shown in step 6, I can update my answer with a better explanation on how to proceed.\nAlso, the output, from the command given below, can help diagnose your problem.\ndiskutil  list\n\n\nA: Yes - you certainly can roll back with a bootable installer.\nYou could make two (or more partitions) on an external drive and run the createinstallmedia and have a Sierra installer, High Sierra installer and boot to either - erase your drive (disconnect all backup drives so you’re sure you don’t erase your backup) and then install Sierra.\nWhen the setup assistant runs - try restoring your latest backup - in general that’s not supported, but I’ve had luck with it on Sierra/HS upgrades lately. If you want to be 100% safe and supported, choose a backup from Sierra to restore to Sierra, though.\n", "Q: iCloud says \"Password is wrong\", but I think it's correct iCloud says \"Password is wrong\", but I think it's correct.

Time Machine backups are saved to an external hard drive.\n\nA: Those are APFS local snapshots that use copy on write, so they take no space overhead to a first approximation. \nI wouldn’t even bother removing them unless you have measurable file extent fragmentation since you can roll back changes like software updates with these as well as the system cleans them automatically if you run into storage pressure and the external drive connects to get a second backup after a few days time. \nIf you want to force one backup and then force deletion of all the snapshots here are the commands. I would be sure the first one completes without error, though.\ntmutil startbackup --block\ntmutil listlocalsnapshotdates / | grep -v dates | xargs -I date tmutil deletelocalsnapshots date\n\nNote: the tmutil startbackup reports success on the command line (exit 0) no matter what, so be sure you see actual data copies and not zero values and a pop up error in notifications if you are logged in to the Mac console.\n", "Q: Can I release our iOS app on Christmas iTunes Connect says:\n\nMake sure your apps are up-to-date and ready for the winter holidays. New apps and app updates will not be accepted December 23 to 27 (Pacific Time), so any releases should be submitted, approved, and scheduled in advance. Other iTunes Connect and developer account features will remain available.\n\nIf I have the app already approved by Apple before the deadline, can I still release it on Christmas if I use the \"manual release\" or \"automatically release no later than\" option?\n\nA: This could be a question that no-one here can answer unless they've previously tried to do this over the Christmas period, so my suggestion would be to call the Apple Developer Program Support number for your country. \nTo find the number, refer to: https://developer.apple.com/contact/phone/\nI just feel this is the best way for you to get a definitive answer. \n\nA: The answer is yes, you can still release an app during Apple’s holiday time. I have done this and it worked.\n", "Q: Enable Apple Music on iTunes I'm unable to activate Apple Music on iTunes 12.7\nWhen I go to Preferences -> General There is no Show Apple Music option.\nApple music works fine on my iPhone.\nHow do I enable Apple Music on iTunes?\n\n\nA: The solution was to go to Account on the top bar and then click Authorisations-> De-Authorise This Computer and Authorise again.\nAfter this the Apple music will be shown in iTunes Preferences.\n\nA: First be sure you are logged in with the same Apple ID on both devices.  Then go to iTunes > Music, and click on \"For You\"  You can then either choose \"Try it now\" (if you do not have a subscription) or \"Connect\"\n", "Q: When I'm texting, sometimes the receiver's email shows up Whenever I start a text, my contacts list shows email addresses instead of phone numbers.

Some are iMacs, some are MacBook Pros, some are Mac Pros. \nI have one install that I love. Has every piece of software, every driver.  And its stable. It’s an iMac. I’d like to clone an image of that HDD to other computers.\nDo MacOS installations configure to the specific machine it’s on, or does it install a nearly identical version of the OS on every machine and adjust drivers depending on what’s attached?\nHow modular is the OS after it has been installed?\nWill that actually work?  Will that be stable?\n\nA: Short answer\nGenerally what you want to do should be fine, however there are some considerations (see long answer below).\nLong answer\nIn years gone past macOS installations were configured as part of the installation process specifically for the hardware it was on. However, for quite some time now this is no longer the case. So, doing what you want should be largely possible, although you may have some minor issues that are inherited. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have seen situations where the computer name doesn't reflect the actual computer of the installation, although this doesn't pose any actual problems as numerals are typically appended at the end to distinguish between computers on the network\n\n*some software may not work initially as the software is simultaneously installed on multiple machines and therefore exceeding the software license\n\n\nAnother factor to consider is that not all versions of macOS will run on all Macs. For example, let's say the installation you love is on a 2015 iMac that's running El Capitan 10.11.6. If you clone this and then try to use it on a 2017 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, it won't work because Macs cannot run on any version of macOS that is earlier than the version that shipped with the Mac originally. This is managed via the firmware and there's no getting around it. \n", "Q: How to edit the Plist so as to remove all reference to wireless cards and drivers if it involves no risks? I need to start a new, totally new wireless config.  My 17\" MBP 4,1(1261) wireless died. Card removed was 3 wire but new one has only 2.  ifixit.com says connect black, then blue, and grey does not get connected. \nEl Capitan does not see that card at all even after resets of all 3 types with battery out.  Since, I've used at least 3 different USB adapters; now, I just want to start clean.  \nAnd this OS install was a clean install on to a 1 TB SSD which runs fast with the full 6GB RAM. \n\nA: Removing the plist is not going to solve the issue.  The 3 wire versus the 2 wire are for the WiFi and Bluetooth antennas, and have no bearing on whether or not your Mac sees the hardware.\nIf you go into System Information (About this Mac > System Report) then scroll down to WiFi, it should give you information about the WiFi adapter.  If it doesn't, it's not being detected and no amount of jiggering with plist files will fix it.  It's time to look at either the new WiFi card is defective/incompatible or the mPCI slot on the logic board is faulty.\nGiven that you are attempting to fix a 2008 MacBook Pro, I wouldn't spend too much time trying to repair a WiFi adapter or deal with a potentially bad mPCI slot..  Instead, get a USB WiFi adapter like the DLink DWA-171 which supports 802.11ac and is fully Mac compatible (I'm using it on a 2009 MacBook Pro as I type this).  \n", "Q: Adding a Time Machine destination fails with OSStatus error 17 I'm trying to add a specific, external server as a Time Machine destination. It's not discoverable via Bonjour (always at least, I want to use time machine backup over the internet) so to get it to show up in the Time Machine preferences I have to connect to it. I can then add it from Preferences. The weird thing is if I try and add the other destination which is visible via bonjour it works just fine, despite being able to mount the share normally in Finder.\n\nA: Digging through the console I found this telling error:\nNetAuthSysAgent already_mounted: share <TIMEMACHINE> already mounted\n\nTIMEMACHINE is my share name in this case. As the error suggests, Time Machine is trying to mount the share again which it can't do because it's mounted already. But wait! If I disconnect from the share will leave my list! \nHere's where some weird UI trickery comes in:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect to the share using Finder\n\n*Open Time Machine preferences, click 'Select Disk', and then double click the disk at your desired address (in my case I wanted my FQDN). You should now be at the authentication prompt.\n\n*With the authentication prompt still open, go back to Finder and eject the share\n\n*Sign in to the waiting prompt\n\n\nand the disk should be added!

About a week ago, I suspected that my Mini had been infected. So disconnected the Time Machine to preserve my backups, switched to the MacBook and when I had the time, downloaded the installer and tried to install High Sierra. \nI created an external bootable media by downloading the installer on my MacBook, plugged in an external HDD and ran sudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MacInstall\nI got to the screen with the utilities, started Disk Utility and erased my Macintosh HD and replaced it with APFS.  But of course, it's not a solid state drive, so that failed. I erased the disk again, and reformatted it as HPFS, journaled.  \nThis time, I get 'an error occurred while preparing the installation. Try running this application again'. \nI have downloaded the installer a second time, and tried again. Same result. I checked the date and it is correct. I even tried resetting the NVRAM. No luck. At this point, I have a Mac sitting here like a brick, that I can't use. \nCan someone recommand how to get round this? \n\nA: The most likely error is that the disk isn't partitioned correctly. If you have a bootable installer or can connect it in target disk mode - try erasing the entire physical volume again.\n\nIn the image above - you want the top item selected and not the volume under the physical drive. I like to click erase and then not make any changes from the defaults - leave the name Untitled or whatever the default name is - not Macintosh HD.\nThen when the installer runs, you might need to look at the install log (press command 3 and command L when the install starts) or we'll need to chase down where or if your installer is saved to disk after the install aborted.\nIn some newer hardware - you need to be connected to the internet with no firewalls so the installer can go get the components for the hardware - perhaps that step is failing and the install log would likely show that.\nHere is Apple's full steps on the erase - so choose it over my steps above if mine fail you.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904\n", "Q: Where are the install logs for macOS bootable external installer With the more recent macOS installers, using createinstallmedia to make bootable installers is widespread practice now. \n\n\n*\n\n*https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372\nWhen we take that drive to a Mac to erase it and install a clean OS - do the installer logs with any errors get saved to the external or internal disk or do we need to inspect/ save / send them to Apple before we quit the installer?\n\nA: The macOS install log is always on the target drive in /var/log/install.log.\n", "Q: How to change your primary device for receiving the verification code?

When I search for them to send a text message they are there but their names disappear. They are not, however, in my contacts list. Anyone know how to fix?  I've done a reboot but it didn't help.\n\nA: Not much you can do if they were exchange contacts. The messages will still be there because they were created before you removed the account that stored all your contacts. You could probably re-add the exchange account, and see if you can mass-move the contacts to your iCloud group in contacts - probably best to try this on a mac if you have one. \n\nA: Add that exchange account back, you saved those contacts to it. \n", "Q: AppleScript: if selection empty, select all I've made many AppleScript module for TextWrangler but this time I face a \"stupid\" problem:\nThe idea: if nothing is selected in the text, set the selection to all the text.\nI've made many tests, without any succes.

When nothing is selected, I enter the if block, but this give me an empty selection. \nAny idea how I can grab only the selected text when there is something and perform a select all and copy that if no text is selected?\n\nA: The reason you get an empty selection, i.e. when nothing is selected and set my_selection to (get selection) returns, e.g., insertion point before character 1 of text document 1, the if statement block fails with the\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    keystroke \"a\" using command down\n\nportion of the code because TextWrangler doesn't have focus.\nThe keystroke command goes to whatever has focus, so before you have System Events keystroke something, activate the target first, e.g.:\ntell application \"TextWrangler\"\n    activate\n    -- delay 1 -- # Uncomment and or adjust the value of the 'delay' command as/if necessary.\n    set my_selection to (get selection)\n    set nb_mot to count words of (my_selection)\n\n    if nb_mot < 1 then\n        tell application \"System Events\"\n            keystroke \"a\" using command down\n            display dialog \"Select all\"\n...\n\n\nThat said, you can omit the activate command and use the following example AppleScript code:\ntell application \"TextWrangler\"\n    set my_selection to selection\n    set nb_mot to count words of my_selection\n\n    if nb_mot < 1 then\n        set my_selection to characters 1 thru -1 of text document 1\n        set nb_new_mot to count words of my_selection\n    end if\n\n    set var_1 to (replace \"(\" using \"(\" searching in my_selection options {search mode:literal, starting at top:false, wrap around:false, backwards:false, case sensitive:false, match words:false, extend selection:false})\nend tell\n\nNote for clarity, I've remove the display dialog and delay commands along with all of System Events code, and other unnecessary code, as the following line of code is all that's necessary if the nb_mot is < 1:\nset my_selection to characters 1 thru -1 of text document 1\n\nThe Event Log and Result of this example AppleScript code is:\ntell application \"TextWrangler\"\n    get selection\n        --> insertion point before character 1 of text document 1\n    count every word of insertion point before character 1 of text document 1\n        --> 0\n    get characters 1 thru -1 of text document 1\n        --> characters 1 thru 499 of text document 1\n    count every word of characters 1 thru 499 of text document 1\n        --> 70\n    replace \"(\" using \"(\" searching in characters 1 thru 499 of text document 1 options {search mode:literal, starting at top:false, wrap around:false, backwards:false, case sensitive:false, match words:false, extend selection:false}\n        --> 3\nend tell\nResult:\n3\n\nAs you can see it replaces the three ( in:\nset var_1 to (replace \"(\" using \"(\" searching in my_selection options {search mode:literal, starting at top:false, wrap around:false, backwards:false, case sensitive:false, match words:false, extend selection:false})\n\n\nA: This works for me using the latest version of Sierra\nproperty currentSelection : \"\"\nproperty selectAll : \"\"\nproperty oldClipboard : \"\"\n\ncopy (the clipboard) to oldClipboard\n\ntell application \"TextWrangler\"\n    set currentSelection to contents of selection\n    if currentSelection is not \"\" then\n        set the clipboard to currentSelection\n    else\n        tell its document 1 -- assuming the document in question is document 1\n            select every text\n        end tell\n        set selectAll to contents of selection\n        set the clipboard to selectAll\n    end if\nend tell\n\n", "Q: What is MobileAccessoryUpdater and why it runs on my MacBook?

After upgrading from Sierra to High Sierra, the Mac had difficulty finishing Time Machine backups to the Synology NAS.  Ultimately the Mac itself would not reboot and the hard drive was wiped with Sierra reinstalled at the Genius Bar.  (I was confident I had backups via the NAS).  When I tried Migration Assistant I notice that the backup is \"Amanda's Macbook Pro.purgeable\". \n\nThe backup is encrypted (as I had set up.)  I enter the encryption code and get the error \"Some backups cannot be opened.\"  Then I notice that it says there are \"no volumes found in backup\". \n\nI then leave migration assistant and go into the backup folder on the NAS.  I find the folder \"Amanda's Macbook Pro.purgeable.sparsebundle\". \n\nIn it there are a number of files and a very large \"bands\" folder. \n\nThe whole backup folder is 800+ GB which is about right for my MacBook Pro, so I know the information must be in there.\nI make a copy of the entire backup folder to a separate drive so that I have a backup of the backup that is untouched.\nI tried using the Terminal commands that many have outlined and had success with.

I had to manually disconnect the user and then everything worked when I tried again. But I think it should work by restarting the NAS as well.\nI hope this can help...\n\nA: Since Apple does support network file shares for time machine. I’d push the Synology support harder. You could also find someone to assist given how detailed your notes are - someone that does t ch work might be able to sit with you for an hour or so and collaborate and see if your backups are viable for a restore. \n\nA: Trying to restore or migrate, I got this: \n\n\"Some backups cannot be opened.\"\n\nSo I connected the Synology drive as a remote drive (afp://serverName/folder), and when exploring, saw a .inProgress folder.

I received the message saying it is almost full and checking iCloud discovered there is less then 1GB free.\nI would like to know which are the biggest files/folders, so I can move them elsewhere. I tried to find folder size in the following way:\nMy-MacBook-Pro:com~apple~CloudDocs me$ du -h -d 1\n184M    ./SomeFolder\n1.4G    ./AnotherFolder\n5.5G    ./Me\n4.4M    ./.Trash\n 16K    ./Downloads\n7.0G    .\n\nBut, due to the mechanics of iCloud (I think) some files are stored on iCloud only, and so I'm failing to get the full size of everything.\nHow to proceed?\n\nA: You can see the file sizes in Finder! If you select iCloud Drive in the sidebar and get info on an item (select item and press cmd+i), it will show how much space it takes up in iCloud and how much space it takes up on your disk.\nTo make it easier to find the largest folders, make it show in List view, press cmd+J to open the View Options panel and enable \"calculate all sizes\". This makes it list sizes for folders as well as files, so you can see at a glance which folder contains the most space and even sort by size.\nNote, though, that this will only show you the files in iCloud Drive; your space may be used up by other features like email or photos, if you enabled iCloud Photos.\n\nA: Well, you could go to System Preferences > iCloud > Manage, and see which files take the most space.\n\nA: I understand what you mean. The problem is that iCloud drive is not a good representation to understand what you have on iCloud unless you sync everything. \nTo understand what you have on icloud alltogether it's best to go to icloud.com\nFrom here you can access the diferent folders that are created by the different applications and devices. The problem is that Apple does not provide sorting options or list views making it difficult to use. You either do manual or use icloud for Windows and do all the managing there. Granting you all kinds of additional options for sorting and managing that Apple on Mac or their website doesn't provide. \n", "Q: iTunes suddenly will not let me add manually album art I am running High Sierra, updated, with iTunes 12.7.2.

When I added the artwork it never showed up in the end.\nLater I have found out, how to solve this problem: \n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the download of the song (you don't have to remove the song from the library, just the download via the context menu)\n\n*Upload the artwork again.\n\n*Before you save it, click on the artwork tab and select the image. It should then be bordered blue.\n\n*Now click save and the artwork should be saved now and also syncs to all the other devices.\n\n\nI know that this question is a little bit older, but I hope to help other people with the same problem.\n", "Q: How can I view message timestamps in iOS 11?

It's alright if you don't have the answer, but don't mark it resolved just for the sake of it. Leave it up in case someone else knows the answer.\nFirst of all, that script fails to connect most of the time. Secondly, I need a way to stop non-administrators from connecting to ALL networks other than the ones I've white-listed. That solution has you list the 'bannedList' of networks one by one. And it doesn't mention how to force non-admins to connect through the script rather than just using the regular WiFi list or network preferences.\nI refuse to believe there is no solution to such a trivial network security question. Especially since it was so easy on Windows. \n\nA: If it's running High Sierra you can turn off auto-join in the system preferences > network > airport panel.\nEDIT: question was unclear.  Here's another answer that might be better for the question-asker.\nYou can create a 'Profile' to install on the system.\n\n\n*\n\n*Buy Server.app on the App Store.\n\n*Learn about Profiles and how they work.\n\n*Create a profile with a restirction that prevents the user from accessing the 'network' control panel.\n\n*Make sure the WiFi network(s) it's OK to connect to are already set up - the credentials will be stored in the System keychain, so all users will be able to access them.  If the administrator has connected to networks that other users shouldn't - you'll need to 'forget' those networks or move them from the system keychain to a user one.\n\n*Install the profile in the users' account, and make sure to disable the WiFi menu while you're at it, so the only way to change networks - other than the command-line if they figure out how - is through the Network control panel, which is now disabled.\n\n", "Q: Creating a new file from a rectangular region of a PDF file I want to create a new PDF file from a rectangular region of an existing PDF file, old_file.pdf.

The command shown is actually the ucomm (accounting) keyword as the system can't find the actual arguments.\nTo remove the process the process that calls it has to read its exit code, however there has probably been a failure and it won't do that, so you have to kill the parent process.\nps -ajx will show the status and parent - note that Apple/BSD changed the parameters of ps in Tiger   and ps -aux does not work ps aux sees a hack as that is what everyone uses.

I then created an install USB for windows 10 on my USB drive. When booting and holding the option key, I see three options: Mac, Windows and the USB drive. If I select Windows it just boots as usual ignoring the USB drive. What happens if I select the USB drive? Will it install window 10 onto my windows bootcamp partition (as I want) or will it try to install it on the USB drive?\n\nA: It has been a while since I use windows 8.1, but I believe you can mount the Windows 10 iso. From there you can just click on the setup application and upgrade to Windows 10.\nSome comments on what you are attempting.\n\n\n*\n\n*I understand you dowloadeded a windows utility to create the bootable USB. You make not mention copying the Windows Support Software to the USB. This is required.\n\n*You see three options: Mac, Windows and the USB drive. The correct answer is \"EFI Boot\". I assume this is what you meant by USB drive.\n\n*The Boot Camp Assistant creates the partitions necessary for the installation of Windows. You make no mention of creating space for the Windows partitions.\n\n*All Microsoft \"Media Creation Tool\"s are incompatible with Apples way of installing windows. In other words, you should not use a Microsoft \"Media Creation Tool\" to create the USB Windows installer. You can use a Microsoft \"Media Creation Tool\" to download the Windows iso file.\n\n*Your Mac already contains all the tools needed to create a USB Windows installer from an Windows iso file. You should use the Boot Camp Assistant to download the Windows Support Software, but from there you can create the USB installer without the aid of the Boot Camp Assistant.\n\n*Actually, you can install Windows 10 without using any USB drives. A procedure for this is given here.\n\n\nIf you do not have working Windows 10 iso file and you have activated your Windows 8.1 installation, then you can upgrade to Windows 10 for free.

I've come to realize it spikes when using 3 displays (2 external 1080p and laptop's retina screen). If I close the laptop and only use the 2 external displays, CPU usage instantly drops. And then, if I open it again, rises up and kernel_task can report over 150% CPU usage and transitions, typing, everything becomes laggy. This can happen even on a fresh boot.\nI'm clueless, since 3 displays should be effortless on the GPUs task and by no means take over the CPU. I read kernel_task might spike in order to prevent other processes to hog the CPU and overheat. Even then, closing the screen interrupts no CPU consuming processes, so that shouldn't calm kernel_task down. And the laptop should be even hotter while closed than open.\nIs there a step that might help resolve the slowdown?\n\nA: I don't know why I didn't try this earlier, but a SMC Reset did it. \nSo I guess sensors were a little off and that was it? Any additional technical details is still much appreciated.\n\nA: Restarting SMC chipset helped fixing it.\n\n*\n\n*Shut down Mac\n\n*Hold. CTRL+OPTION+SHIFT+POWER button for 10 seconds\n\n*Start mac\n\n\nA: The answer from Kuldip was the correct answer for me, but without explanation, I wouldn't have tried it.

Is there anyway to undo this action or restore the deleted conversation in iOS 11?\nThe conversation still exists on my iPad but I would like to have the full conversation on my iPhone too. \n\nA: Well, there is no real way of restoring it with one click. You could restore your iPhone with the latest backup file. So if you backed up your phone after you had that conversation, you could restore that back up, and you would have your conversation back. However, if you added any new things to your iPhone after your latest backup, they will be erased.\n", "Q: MBP 15\" not sleeping when closing lid My MBP 15\" (end 2016) on macOS Sierra 10.12.6 have a strange behaviour when I close the lid.

Few weeks ago, on an Apple 21.5” iMac Desktop Computer (4th-Generation, late 2013), I installed the just released macOS High Sierra v.10.13.1. I’ve recognized that on November 29, 2017, Apple Released a Security Update for macOS High Sierra and installed it on the iMac in the background (without consent). During the next weekend I’ve Shut Down the computer, then turned it off with the power button and unplug the power cord overnight. When I reconnected the power cord and turned on the iMac with the power button on the next morning, I could see the log-in screen, enter the password, and then a muddy picture with a unusually slow moving progress bar, which run (filled) completely, but the screen did not progress, as typically, to open a functional Desktop (picture) with the Dock. After waiting for about an hour, I’ve tried to Force Shutdown the computer by pressing and holding the power button, then restart the iMac with the power button, but only got the same muddy picture with the slowly moving progress bar, which, again, after running till the end, the computer did not progress to opening a functional Desktop with a Dock.  \nI restarted several more times, unsuccessfully, then I contacted Apple Support and talked on the phone to few advisors (Case ID: 100370008105). In order to correct this situation, together, or I myself, did several times the following:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Manual restart \n\n*Start up in Safe Mode \n\n*Reset the System Management Controller (SMC) \n\n*Reset the Nonvolatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM)\n\n*In Single-User Mode, a “senior” advisor from Apple Support wanted me to run the following commands (without further explanation):\nmount -uw /\nrm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone\nreboot  \n\n\nHowever, after the log-in screen asking for the password, we have always ended up at the following GRAY SCREEN: user account picture, user account name, and progress bar (initially “filling” fast until the middle, and then slowing down, “filled” completely, till the end, after about 20 minutes). But NO visible progress to open the Desktop with the Dock (when waiting for several hours).\nGRAY SCREEN\nSince I could not recognize whether the computer could communicate with the original wireless keyboard and mouse in Bluetooth, I’ve replaced them and connected an Apple wired keyboard and mouse to the iMac.  \nStarting up from macOS Recovery, I’ve been able several times to  \n\n\n*\n\n*“Install the latest macOS that was installed on your Mac, without upgrading to a later version” using Command (⌘)-R  \n\n*“Upgrade to the latest macOS that is compatible with your Mac,” macOS High Sierra v.10.13.2, using Option-Command-R  \n\n*“Install the macOS that came with your Mac, or the version closest to it that is still available” using Shift-Option-Command-R\n\n\nOptions 1 and 2 download and installation had always run (apparently) without problems, until I’ve ended up, again, at the same GRAY SCREEN.

My problem is, that I cannot open my Photos library with Sierra since I've opened it with High Sierra, it says that I need to update my Photos app.\nIs there a way to update this app without changing the OS? \n\nA: No - you'll need to restore the photo library and associated files back to a time before the migration / upgrade happened. The database schema and many other items like face recognition databases are one way forward upgrades.\nIf you don't have a backup, you would need to install High Sierra on an external drive - open the Photos library and then try syncing it back to iCloud (unlikely to work, but maybe try on a small library first) or export all of the photos to the filesystem and then walk away from the library.\nWhen you go back to Sierra you'd need to make a new library and then import the photos from the filesystem.

After installation is complete, you can continue to deploy apps with iTunes.\n\nAlso, this \"special\" version of iTunes includes compatibility with iOS 11, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X and supports both Windows and Mac.\n", "Q: Putting display to sleep with AirPlay crashs apps in macOS High Sierra I use AirPlay everyday and put my display to sleep if I leave my desk in macOS Sierra.\nHowever, putting display to sleep with AirPlay crashes all the apps after upgrading to macOS High Sierra.\nI tried finding errors in console log message, but it was cleared after I woke my Mac. I can't find the details in console log messages.\nHow do I resolve this issue?\n\nA: I have had the same issue, but it got fixed after upgrading to macOS High Sierra 10.13.4.\nI use AirPlay daily at work to connect to AirServer running on a Windows PC that has an external monitor attached, so that I can have a second external monitor on my MacBook Air. And when I walk away from my desk, I either Lock Screen with the Command + Option + Eject shortcut or using hot corner to put the display to sleep with password protection. When I would come back, I would have to login again and all apps were restarted. No kernel panic, but the OS itself appears to crash.\nI discovered that the WindowServer itself that was crashing. Opening Console.app, and looking under \"System Reports\" in the sidebar, I found crash reports for WindowServer at the exact times that I had locked my Mac. I sent the crash report to Apple yesterday via their feedback form, but then I also decided to upgrade to 10.13.4 to see if there's any chance the problem had been fixed already, even though there was no mention of it in the release notes.\nAnd after a bunch of testing today, it looks like the problem has been resolved. I've now connected to AirPlay as usual, and locked my screen multiple times both with the Command + Option + Eject shortcut and using a hot corner to put the display to sleep, and in both cases, the Mac was able to wake up, and I could log back into my running system, with all the apps still running, as expected.\nWeirdly, I'm experiencing different behaviour now depending on whether I lock via the keyboard shortcut or via the hot corner:\nKeyboard shortcut: Disconnects from AirPlay display altogether. On wakeup, Mac will auto-unlock via the Apple Watch, although it takes a bit longer. I have to reconnect to AirPlay display.\nHot Corner: Doesn't disconnect from AirPlay (at least not immediately, it just shows a black screen). On wakeup, I'm presented with the login screen asking for my password, but the Mac does not auto-unlock via the Apple Watch. I don't however have to reconnect the AirPlay display.\nI'll send the feedback for the aforementioned issues but the crashing appears to have gone.\n", "Q: How to unhide files on Mac?

Hours of searching various forums have produced glimmers of hope, but nothing works.  \nFirst - mea culpa - I have only myself to blame.  Short Version: I wiped my (time machine) external backup drive due to problems it was having.  Before I could create a new TM backup, I left for a couple of days, came back and my startup disk was full and my Mini (mid-2011, Running Sierra) wouldn't boot.  So now I have no backup to restore from.\nTried recovery mode, disk won't mount.\nTried Target mode - no way no how.\nI've read where some people went into Single User mode and used the command line to delete some files they don't need.  I've gotten as far as the command line.  tried all the fsck stuff - nothing.\nTried /sbin/mount -uw / (as per this thread http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=554227) but I'm getting a long error message that ends in:\nmount_hfs: error on mount (): error = -1\nmount_hfs: Invalid argument.\nI've tried various rm commands, but keep getting various slaps on the wrist that end in \"Read-only file system\"\nFor obvious reasons, I'd like to try to clear enough of the clutter on this drive in hopes of rebooting and then wiping out all the clutter I should have gotten rid of a while ago before going nuclear on it and risking losing everything.  I feel like I'm so close, but can't get past this pesky read-only issue.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Please note I'm not a power user-and had never typed anything into a terminal command line before I ran into this problem and started searching - i.e. I'm competent enough to follow directions very well, but only if they're dumbed-down a bit. (After all - I was dumb enough to let this happen in the first place!)\n\nA: The error your getting when typing in the command means that the command you typed in has invalid arguments. That means that you didn't type the command correctly. \nThe reason it's not letting you modify the hard drive is because the drive is only mounted in read only mode.\nMount hard drive for read and write in single user mode\n/sbin/fsck -fy \n\nThen run:\n/sbin/mount -uw\n\nIf it says something like invalid command try the commands without \"/sbin/\" at the beginning. \nAfter your able to mount the disk erasing the files the other website recommended.\nAlso you mentioned you couldn't boot into recovery mode, but have you tried to boot into Internet Recovery Mode?\nHow to boot into Internet Recovery Mode \n\n\n*\n\n*Hold Option-Command-R or Shift-Option-Command-R on startup until you see a spinning globe\n\n*Connect the device to Internet if prompted to do so.\n\n\nHope this helps and good luck on recovery your data\n\nA: I have the same problem on a 2014 iMac running Mojave.  Its 3TB fusion main drive filled up as I was downloading a 5 GB file.  The write failed to complete and immediately the disk became read-only.  \nNow no command in disk utility or in single user or recovery mode can escape read-only mode, so no repair or reformat or OS reinstall is possible.  I see no sign of hardware failure, so I suspect this is a software bug in the filesystem (though this seems to happen in HFS as well as APFS).  Apparently writing a large file (> 2 GB) can cause this, especially on a fusion drive.\nMy last attempt to fix this will be to reset the fusion drive ('diskutil resetFusion'), but I suspect I'll have to physically replace the drive -- this time with a pure SSD.  I'm done with fusion drives.\n", "Q: Unable to run xcode-select --install I am on a MacBook Air running macOS High Sierra 10.13.2\nWhen I run xcode-select --install to re-install Xcode developer tools, I am prompted to this\n\nI choose install option which opens the agree terms prompt\n\nagree terms and this appears \n\nand nothing happens for 30 mins, so I tried to stop and it didn't work, I tried the quit option from the dock which didn't work either.

Opsec I'm in a tough situation and am hoping you can help me out.\nAs a student in California, USA, our teachers sometimes require us to sign on to the school's wireless network.\nSupposedly, they have an application where they can not only listen to each device's incoming/outgoing traffic but also view our screens in realtime (sort of like a VNC client).\nFor obvious reasons, this drives me insane. Other than using Chrome extensions such as HTTPS Everywhere and turning on FileVault (Full disk encryption), what else can I do? I know the VNC client likely runs off of  some malware installed on my computer (without my permission, of course). Where might this sofware be hiding and/or be found?\nI'm running High Sierra 10.13.2.\nPS: Would running a system such as Tails be a good idea? (tails.boum.org).\nThanks again!\n\nA: The only way they are going to be able to watch your screen is if you have installed something specific to allow them to do so or they have a password and you have screen sharing (and or remote management) turned on.\nSo turn off screen sharing (System Preferences > Sharing. Uncheck screen sharing and remote management) and change your password and any other passwords on the system in System Preferences > Users & Groups.\nThis all presupposes this is YOUR Mac and not one provided by the school. If it is provided by the school they likely have it locked down so you can't make those changes because the computer does not belong to you.\n\nA: Installing a fork of Linus of completely unnecessary. There are many things you can do on you Mac to secure it if you think your school is monitoring it(even though it’s highly unlikely)\nDisable all forms of remote control/monitoring\nThe first thing you’ll want to do is disable all ways the school could monitor your computer. These include VNC and SSH.\nTo disable VNC and SHH go to System Preferences -> Sharing, then uncheck remote management, Screen Sharing(VNC), and remote login(SSH).\nThis will prevent the school from controlling/monitoring your computer IF they manage to acquire you username and password.\nUse a VPN to encrypt internet traffic\nIf one of your concerns is that the school is monitoring your internet traffic, you can use a VPN to encrypt you internet traffic until it is outside of the school network. You can do this using a service called a VPN(Virtual Private Network). With a VPN, your computer will encrypt all internet traffic when sending it, and it will only be decrypted once the VPN server which is outside of the school network receives you computers internet traffic. This will prevent the school from viewing your internet traffic(both inbound and outbound traffic).\nThe first way to get a VPN could bring paying a monthly subscription for one. You can usually find one for fairly inexpensive online, I would suggest checking reviews on a service before using it though.\nThe second way would be to host your own VPN server at your house.  All you’ll need is a  old Mac, internet and $20. I found this link from Life Hacker explaining how to make the server and how sign up for a DDNS service so you can connect to the server. It also includes everything you need about port forwarding on your router.\nNote: A VPN will only protect WAN traffic, it will not protect any LAN traffic. Using a VPN will also cause errors when your computer tries to communicate on the LAN network.\nInstall a anti malware program\nOne of your concerns was the school installing spyware on your computer and using it to monitor your computer. One of the best ways to prevent this would be installing a anti malware program on your computer and running a full computer scan. This will check your computer for malware, and after it’s done scanning it will monitor it for malware. I recommend using one called AVG. I personally use the free version which works fine on my personal laptop. I will add that it is very unlikely that the school installed malware on your computer as that can be very complicated to do.\nAll this advice and different methods are only if your the owner of the computer and it’s not a laptop given to you by the school for the year. If it’s a school computer it most-likely has settings in place to prevent from disabling settings and adding a VPN. They will also most-likely have settings installed so they can control and view the computer.\nHope this helps you with securing your laptop\n", "Q: Internal microphone only works when Siri is activated - MacOS 10.13.2 https://imgur.com/a/jNpvW (video of the bug)\nInternal microphone works only when Siri is activated.\nI started noticing this after installing Boom 2 (I think), which I've uninstalled now and the problem still persists.

Writing pages in and out is really time consuming and is not as fast as using RAM\nI try to compare with my Ubuntu 16.04 distribution at home which doesn't swap unless the memory is full. But maybe the 2 OS have different behaviors, though they are both UNIX based.\nI also printed out the output of the vm_stat command to check if there were any difference, because maybe htop is not reporting it accurately.

There's no loss of computational power involved in that.\nYou seem to have jumped to the conclusion that macOS is using swap, when it could as well be using free memory based on the htop screenshot. You cannot make that conclusion from a simple sample of the memory usage.\nIn reality, you could have been running programs that were using a lot of RAM forcing macOS to swap memory to disk. Then you quit some of those programs (or they deallocated a chunk of RAM). Then if you take a htop sample now, you'll see that RAM usage is low (lots of free RAM), but you're also using lots of swap. \nBut that is not a problem - in fact it is intended to be this way!\nIt wouldn't be wise for macOS to start swapping in those pages that have been placed on disk. It will do this when they're required (i.e. used by programs), but until that happens, it could be that those pages would never be used - and thus time spent swapping them in will be lost.\nYou write that in comparison to your Ubuntu PC you observe a different behaviour. You should know that you can actually change that behaviour. On Linux you can use sysctl to set the vm.swappiness variable. It will change how aggressive the OS is in swapping things out to disk.\nYou also ask why your macOS system does not use fixed size swap as Ubuntu does. In fact, Ubuntu also supports dynamic sized swap using the \"swapspace\" command. You can set minimum and maximum sizes, and it will dynamically add/remove swap space as needs change.\n", "Q: MacBook Pro 2016 won't charge even on power adapter I'm using the CalDigit USB-C Dock and the Mac said it is using the power adapter, but my battery is slowly draining:\n\nI did an SMC reset and reset PRAM (NVRAM) but still won't charge.\nWhy isn't my Mac charging?\n\nA: As it turns out, the USB-C I was using is bad.

Any idea what to do without reformatting and loosing the data on the stick? Is there any option to manually mount the filesystem as exFAT using command line?\n\nA: Each partition on a drive is assigned a type. The type indicates what the partition will contain. Usually, but not always, this is a file system. The mapping from a partition type to a file system is not always one-to-one. For example, both the ExFAT and NTFS files systems map to the same partition type. Therefore, Windows generally does not look at the partition type, but rather looks at the content of the partition to determine the file system.\nIn your question, the output from the diskutil command shows the ExFAT formatted partition to be Apple_HFS. What should have appeared is Microsoft Basic Data. Therefore, the partition table has partition type error. Microsoft Windows will not care, but Apple macOS does.\nAlthough, you do not show this in your question, the GUID for this type of partition is 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC. The correct value should be EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7. You could goto back to your machine running Windows, open a Administrator Command Prompt Window and enter the following commands. This will correct the error in the partition table.\nBelow I assume the USB stick (flash drive) is disk number 1. If not, then make the appropriate substitution. The detail partition command should show the incorrect partition type value of 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC.\ndiskpart\nlist disk\nselect disk 1\nselect partition 2\ndetail partition\nhelp set\nset id=EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7\nexit\n\n\nNote: If you are clever, you can cut-and-paste from the output of the help set command to enter the set id=EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 command. If not, then type carefully. \n\nIssues Regarding Using Windows Partitioning Tools on a Mac Computer.\nBelow has been referred to as THE GOLDEN RULE.\n\nNever use the Windows diskpart or diskmgmt.msc commands to change the partitioning on a Mac computer. \n\nNote: The diskmgmt.msc command displays the \"Disk Management\" window. An example is shown below.\n\nOriginally, Mac computers could only BIOS boot Windows. In order for this to occur, a hybrid MBR/GPT partitioning method was employed.  The Golden Rule was created because of this hybrid arrangement. Essentially, the diskpart and diskmgmt.msc commands would ignore the GUID partition table (GPT) and only update the MBR partition table. This could (and often did) lead to corruption of the partitions stored on a drive.\nEventually, Apple adopted the newer EFI boot method for Windows. When this method is employed, the hybrid MBR/GPT partitioning scheme is not used. Instead a a pure GPT scheme is employed. One would think this would negate The Golden Rule, but for a different reason, this rule lived on. This reason has to do with bugs introduced by the installation of Apple's Windows Support Software.\nWindows Support Software, among may other things, allows Windows read-only access to certain Mac formatted partitions, such as \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\". Since the Windows software can now read these partitions, the software believes the partitions are Microsoft type partitions. When running Windows partitioning software, this can cause many possible side-effects. One is the replacement of the correct GUID partition type with Microsoft's partition type GUID of EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7. So it seemed, The Golden Rule still applied.\nRecently, cases have been found where The Golden Rule can be broken. In other words, there are cases where the diskpart command can be used to edit a drive partition table when a pure GPT scheme is employed. \nOne such case is when the Windows Recovery Environment is used. This environment can be entered by holding down the shift key while selecting to restart Windows. When you navigate to a Command Prompt window, you can access the diskpart command. This command, when entered here, is unaffected by the Apple's Windows Support Software. Basically, the Windows Recovery Environment loads the Winre.wim image file, which was unaltered when the Windows Support Software was installed. This image file contains a copy of the diskpart command which can be executed safely.\n\nA: Thanks David Anderson for your detailed answer! It points me to a solution on MacOS.\nMy situation was the same with Arne's, except:\n> sudo fdisk /dev/disk2\n/dev/disk2 (external, physical):\n#:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER\n0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *123.0 GB   disk2\n1:           Linux Filesystem                         123.0 GB   disk2s1\n\nI previously formatted my drive on Linux and then on Windows. Guess Windows did not write the partition type. Let's do it for her on MacOS. First let's find out how our GPT table's laid out:\n> sudo gpt -l /dev/disk2\n         start       size  index  contents\n          0          1         PMBR\n          1          1         Pri GPT header\n          2         32         Pri GPT table\n         34       2014         \n       2048  240252895      1  GPT part - 0FC63DAF-8483-4772-8E79-3D69D8477DE4\n  240254943         32         Sec GPT table\n  240254975          1         Sec GPT header\n\nWe want EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 a.k.a. Basic Data Partition to replace 0FC63DAF-8483-4772-8E79-3D69D8477DE4 a.k.a. Linux Filesystem Data.\nThere are 3 numbers to take note of from the output. What the numbers are depends on what was printed on your terminal. Do not copy mine. Do not lose them until you're done.\nLook at the line that says about your partition. The 3 numbers are:\n       2048  240252895      1  GPT part - 0FC63DAF-8483-4772-8E79-3D69D8477DE4\n        ^        ^          ^\n       start    size      index\n\nFirst remove the wrong partition. It does not remove our actual data. In this command we use the number index, in my case 1:\n> sudo gpt remove -i 1 /dev/disk2\n/dev/disk2s1 removed\n\nAnd then we add the correct partition. In this command we use all the 3 numbers: start, size and index. In my case they are 2048, 240252895 and 1. Replace with yours where appropriate. \n> sudo gpt add -b 2048 -s 240252895 -i 1 -t EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 /dev/disk2\n/dev/disk2s1 added\n\nDone! Now MacOS sees it as an exFAT partition. Finder happily mounts the partition. Yay.\nReference on GPT GUIDs on Wikipedia:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table#Partition_type_GUIDs\n\nA: When you try to mount it through Disk Utility, it decided to mount as Apple HFS automatically based on the observation it made, which it indicates your drive to be a MacOS Extended file system drive instead of Microsoft Basic Data - ExFAT.\nI’ve encountered similar problems when I formatted my drive on Windows and then became unrecognizable / unmount-able, to manually mount a partition as specific file system, the following command line will do the trick:\n# replace the last part with your own drive’s identifier\nmount -t exfat disk2s1\nman mount # for more info about ‘mount’, you can check out the man page\n\nFor another, one thing that I would personally suggest is to never try to check and repair a “corrupted” exFAT formatted drive (formatted with Mac) with Windows’ chkdsk command line even if you think your drive is corrupted, and that should go with the GOLDEN RULE that @David Anderson mentioned about, chkdsk really annoyed me a lot because it damaged 3 of my USB drives while I was entrusting it to fix the drive with all the data on it...\n\nA: I had the same problem.

My method of communication is dictation, so the microphone is critical. It works on my synced iPhone 6.\n\nA: Backup the iPhone and then restore to factory. Then as you set up the iPhone restore the backup.\nIf the issue persists. Restore again and then dont restore the backup, set up the phone as is. If it works then your files have corrupted the audio. If it doesnt work, then it needs to be repaired. Take it to the Apple Store for repairs.\n\nA: My iPad Pro's microphone recently stopped working almost completely – \"almost\" because you could still recognise loud sounds in a recording, but it was effectively unusable. The \"Hey Siri\" setup process wouldn't work etc.\nThe cause turned out to be mechanical: there was dirt stuck in the tiny microphone hole. I carefully dug it out with a needle and the microphone returned to its original performance.\nThe microphone's location depends on your iPad model. On my 9 inch Pro, it's a tiny (almost invisible) hole exactly in the middle of the top frame (the one with the power button).\n", "Q: Hardware Router For macOS I \"think\" I understand that all firewalls are software. However, I am splitting the monthly internet bill with a roommate who has the ISP modem/router in his room. I would like add (if possible) more security measures. (I cannot get my own ISP in my room; as the house is designated as a “heritage house” and the landlord won’t agree to any “drilling”).\nI have my macOS firewall turned on to “block all incoming connections”. I also use Tunnel Bear VPN. \nAre there any recommendations (hardware or software) available considering my situation?\n\nA: If you want more security than what you have now, you could add a hardware based router/firewal between your roommates Internet connected network and  your \"network\"\nWhat you would be doing is connecting your WAN port of your router to your roommates LAN.  This will create a \"double NAT\" network, where your roommate becomes your ISP. \nThe benefit this has over a highly configured firewall is that the router will immediately block all incoming traffic (by default) on the roommates LAN but allow you egress to the Internet. \n", "Q: Safari wont open web pages (maybe other browser either) so I recently upgraded to High Sierra (formating the entire HDD of my MacBook Pro)\nEverything worked alright for a week or two but two days ago browsers stopped working.\nI usually use Firefox as my default browser but it  started throwing some weird message I have never before seen so I uninstaled and open Safari trying to redonwload it.

There are Dock alternatives however, some which support multiple Docks and others that support just more organization. Compatibility is very much dependent on your version of macOS.\nOne alternative that seems to work with macOS High Sierra is uBar.\n\nA: I'm not really trying to answer the question, I'm just trying to give alternatives, so that you could maybe fix the underlying issue another way.\n\nI'm thinking, even if it was possible to do what you want, maybe folders would be a better solution. If that sound like a good idea, check out Station:\n\n\n\n\nI feel Station is probably the thing that solves your problem with the Dock, but just in case, here's some more thoughts on the matter:\nHow about application launchers? They could offer some help...\nI personally only have open apps in the dock and I use different ways to launch applications, but most often I use Alfred. If application launching is all you want to do, Spotlight can nowadays do it pretty well. Default shortcut for Spotligh is cmd+space.\nThe way I would open application using Alfred is this... \nLet's say I want to open Photoshop:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl + Space opens a little windows, much like Spotlight, where you can write\n\n*I start writing Pho... and at that point it already thinks I want to open Photoshop so then I launch it by pressing enter.\n\n\nIf I want to open Illustrator I do the same thing except I write Ill and press enter. \nI find this way more handy than drowning my dock in application icons.\n\nI'll mention this just for fun... It is relevant, it's just maybe a bit of an overkill for most people. So, Elgato Stream Deck is basically... a macro keyboard with lcd screens on each key meant for streamers. I bought one for myself for general productivity stuff... You can assign keys to open applications and trigger hotkeys, which I would say are the two main things you can do with it in terms of the Actions it can perform. It also supports infinite nested folders, which is amazing. Well it might be a bit silly and expensive for most people, like I said, but it's an option....\nThis is not my picture, but it think it shows the potential of this thing being an application launcher.\n\nA big hurdle for me and my use case with this thing is that it doesn't support launching scripts, so for most of what I have done with it, I've had to use the \"trigger a shortcut\" action and then I've made Alfred workflows to launch scripts using that same shortcut. So basically when I press a key in ESD, it sends a set shortcut combination to the OS, Alfred detects it and triggers a script... \n", "Q: What are the consequences of having a work and personal iPhone with the same Apple ID? I'm considering having both a work and personal iPhone.\nThe phone numbers will be different, but I'd like to use the same Apple ID for convenience.\nBut I'm concerned about possible cross-pollination. Presumably text messages will be separate, but things like apps and photographs will be the shared. Perhaps iMessage texts too?\n\nA: You can use the same Apple ID and as you wrote, apps, music, books and so on are shared between devices.\nRegarding Photos, you can turn on/off syncronization (Settings -> [your name] -> iCloud -> Photos, then turn on/off iCloud Photo Sharing)\nRegarding iMessage you can turn on and/or off this feature from your phone (Settings -> Messages)\n\nA: \nBut I'm concerned about possible cross-pollination.\n\nCorrect. \nYou either have to live with the fact that things like the Keychain (usernames/passwords/certificates) get shared between your work and personal device, or you make the decision to not sync them, losing that convenience factor.\n", "Q: Synology NAS (DS218+) and Full Disk Encryption (FileVault2)? I’m wondering, if there is a way to enable Whole Disk Encryption on a Synology NAS (in my case DS218+). \nEvery topic regarding encryption on a Synology NAS addresses “Folder Encryption” rather than encrypting the whole disk. Since I am going to put all my personal stuff - including sensitive information - on the NAS to keep my Desktop and Laptop (Apple OS X) in sync, I need to encrypt it.\nAs I see it, the easiest way would be to encrypt the whole disk using Apples File Vault2. Is it possible or will I have to find another solution rather than using a (Synology) NAS?\nAppreciate your help!\n\nA: \nEvery topic regarding encryption on a Synology NAS addresses “Folder\n  Encryption” rather than encrypting the whole disk....As I see it, the easiest way would be to encrypt the whole disk using Apples File Vault2.\n\nYou can't use Apple's \"whole disk\" encryption on any NAS device because if you were actually able to, the NAS won't be able to access it.\nWhen you are connecting to a NAS, you are mounting a shared volume (not a disk); even if that volume happens to spans the whole disk.  Synology's built in folder encryption is designed specifically to address this.\n", "Q: Apple Mail local vs. server folders: advantages? Can anyone explain what would be advantages/drawbacks if one uses local vs. server folder, like Draft etc.? Thanks!\n\nA: Local folders remove mail from the server, so if you're limited on space on the server then you can store messages locally. Almost always this isn't an issue, and as mail in remote folders is still downloaded for offline use, you're not gaining anything for offline access there.\nChoose a remote folder so you can access the mail from anywhere, unless you have a really specific reason otherwise.\n", "Q: Homebrew always updating before installing packages On macOS Sierra every time I run brew install Homebrew tries to update itself, and it takes around 10s. \n\nI found this waste of time frustrating, compared to Ubuntu command apt install, which straight installs the required package. Is there any particular reason for this difference? Or any way to at least increase the times before the update. Because by default it is several times a day.\n\nA: You can set an environment variable to turn this behaviour off. From the man page for brew:\n\nHOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE\nIf set, Homebrew will not auto-update before running brew install, brew upgrade or brew tap.\n\n", "Q: Create apple script which auto names files with info from clipboard when a key combination is pressed I work with file sets all beginning with the same number, but with variations, e.g. 0545038773.jpg, 0545038773_right.jpg, 0545038773_left.jpg, 0545038773_TOP.jpg, etc \nI'd like to assign the, _left, _right, _TOP, etc. to specific key combinations like Command or Option and 1 pressed at the same time, OPT3, OPT4, OPT5, etc.\nIdeally, you'd copy the first part, 0545038773 from wherever, then when you select the file and press the key command, OPT+1 for example, the script highlights the name field, places the copied info from clipboard, 0545038773, then appends the _left, or _right, depending on which key combo is pressed. \nAny help would be appreciated. I had something that did this for PC but I don't have access to the script anymore to try and start translating any of it.\nEven the first part would help. Select file, press key command, naming field then highlights, pastes from clipboard.   Thanks.   \n\nA: This is a problem of two halves.  The second half is easy:\n    tell application \"Finder\" to get the selection as alias list\n\n    tell result\n        if (count it) is not 1 then return\n        set TheFile to its first item\n    end tell\n\n    tell application \"Finder\" to set the name of TheFile to ¬\n        [the clipboard, \"_left\", \".jpg\"] as text\n\nThe core line of code you want here is the penultimate line set name of TheFile to..., where TheFile is a variable that points to the currently selected item in Finder, and you simply need to change the appending text item as you see fit.  The first few lines simply deal with getting the selection from Finder and making sure only one file is selected.\nThe first half of your problem is solvable but at varying degrees of investment versus reliability.\nDo you use any automation software, such as Alfred, Better Touch Tool, Keyboard Maestro or FastScripts ?  All of these let you create hotkeys that trigger a macro to do whatever you want (in this case, run the script above).  This would be my recommended method of doing things, but they are all paid-for applications.\nThe other way is to create a service in MacOS (using Automator).  Once you’ve done that, you can go into System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services, find it in the list, check the box, and assign a shortcut to it like the ones you mentioned.\nFrom then on, whenever you press those shortcuts, the service runs and executes your AppleScript.\nHope this helps.

They recommended backup, erase and restore.\n\n*Also take a look as this user suggest the issue is iOS 11 - https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8101649\n\n*I downloaded app that show battery capacity status - it is 1400/1570mAh 89%, this means its not a battery issue.\n\n\nEDIT 12/25:\n\n\n*\n\n*Went again to apple store to ask to try replace battery and see if that help. They did full test again, and said it seem like software issue, all hardware is in great condition. And they recommended reset without restore. We did full reset and I did not install any apps, and the issue is still not resolved.\n\n\nEDIT 1/18/2018:\n\n\n*\n\n*I bought a new battery from iFixit. It did not resolve the issue. I did notice that switching to low battery mode does help reduce the random shutdowns, but not completely resolve it. I guess my solution is switch to android device.\n\n\nI believe that if apple would allow switch back to iOS 10.3.3 , then that would probably have resolved it. I assumed the latest iOS would be better, but probably not for older models.\n\nA: Your issue could be one of two things: the battery or an issue with your OS. \nYou said you have already had your battery tested, but battery apps aren't very accurate and different tests at the Apple store will show different results. \nStart by calling (or chatting with) Apple support. Do this on a different device. Ask if they can remotely run a Mobile Resource Inspector test. This will test many different components in your phone and is how they diagnosed my battery issue.\nIf they determine it is not a battery issue, do a FULL restore. You'll need a computer with iTunes for this.\n\nAs always, make sure all of your data is saved. You will not restore from a backup, so save it another way.\n\nStart by putting your phone in recovery mode.\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down your iPhone.\n\n*Press and hold both the Home and Top buttons until the connect to iTunes screen appears.\n\n*Connect to iTunes.\n\n\niTunes will show a popup asking if you'd like to restore or update. You'd like to Restore.\n\nYour computer will download a completely new copy of iOS 11 - that's what makes this different than doing this on an iPhone.\nIf your computer takes longer than 15 minutes to download the update, you'll need to put your phone in recovery mode again. Press and hold the Home and Top buttons at the same time to do this.\n\nWarning: Restoring your phone this way will require your Apple ID password unless you didn't have Find My iPhone enabled. If you do not remember your Apple ID password, you should reset it at iforgot.apple.com\n\nIf none of this fixed your phone, I'd recommend talking to Apple Support about your issue over the phone. (Over-the-phone support is generally faster than live chat)\n\nA: My recommendation is to contact Apple Support by phone and inform them of the issues you're having. Describe to them the process you went through of backing up, erasing, and restoring multiple times. Inform them of the Apple Store full diagnostic that said the hardware was functional.\nLike you said, doing a full software reset (without restore) should have eliminated all software issues. This means that there could be a possible hardware issue with your phone that isn't being detected by their systems yet, similar to the recent issue with iPhone 6s batteries.\nIf this ends up being the case, they may send you a replacement phone at no charge.\n\nA: It is most likely your battery causing this issue. Your battery capacity deteriorates over time. You might want to consider replacing your battery. It will resolve this issue, speed your iPhone, and prolong its life. It is very common to have this issue with iPhone 5s.\n\nA: If you have a Mac computer, you can download the coconutBattery app and test the battery yourself. I did that and it indicated my battery was not charging all the way. Download the app to your computer and then connect your phone via cable. Then run the app.\nAlso, go to settings/battery on your iPhone and see if it gives you a message about your battery.\nThe Apple store is probably right but it doesn't hurt to monitor your battery yourself.\n\nA: UPDATE: installed iOS 12 beta, phone worked for short while, and is now a brick. My colleague have the exact same model, he did not upgrade beyond 10.3.3 and his phone is still working fine. \nI believe this is a bug with apple software, and that they do not care much if the software support older models. Here is the message from apple showing no support for model 5s:\n\nPreventing unexpected shutdowns\nAbout a year ago in iOS 10.2.1, we delivered a software update that\n  improves power management during peak workloads to avoid unexpected\n  shutdowns on iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and\n  iPhone SE. With the update, iOS dynamically manages the maximum\n  performance of some system components when needed to prevent a\n  shutdown. While these changes may go unnoticed, in some cases users\n  may experience longer launch times for apps and other reductions in\n  performance.\nCustomer response to iOS 10.2.1 was positive, as it successfully\n  reduced the occurrence of unexpected shutdowns. We recently extended\n  the same support for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in iOS 11.2.\nOf course, when a chemically aged battery is replaced with a new one,\n  iPhone performance returns to normal when operated in standard\n  conditions.\n\nI also tried replacing the battery via iFixit, it did not help at all.\nReferences:\nhttp://appleinsider.com/articles/17/12/29/ifixit-matches-apples-29-battery-swap-cost-covers-pre-iphone-6-devices\nhttps://www.apple.com/iphone-battery-and-performance/\n\nA: When you backed up, erased and restored did you restore your backup? If so then thats the issue. Some of your data in that backup is corrupted. \nTry to restore with iTunes and then set up the iPhone as new this time and see if it still restarts again. It shouldn't, but if it does then you need to contact Apple support for further support.\n", "Q: OneNote's box-outlines and text caret randomly become unresponsive on Sierra and High Sierra When you hover your mouse over a \"box\" in OneNote, it should look like this:\n\nInstead, randomly, the application stops responding with the box outlines (my mouse is in the same place both above and below, i.e. where the caret is):\n\nThe box outlines don't matter that much, actually. It's the fact that the caret disappears, so you have no visual cue as to where you're typing, and also that when you Backspace, you start deleting from some other place (the previous line, I think).\nNo amount of clicking anywhere else in the application (menus, other notebooks) or clicking out and back fixes the problem. It's really frustrating!\nIs there a workaround?\n\nA: I found a consistent workaround for myself:\nThree-finger-swipe up (or any equivalent, to see your Spaces), select any other application, and OneNote should be normal again when you come back.\nThis issue may (or may not) be occurring due to using multiple desktops (Spaces), and possibly due to having multiple OneNote windows open (on different desktops).\n", "Q: How to remove Malwarebytes from Mac? I would like to remove Malwarebytes from a friend's macbook. \nThere is nothing in \n\n\n*\n\n*Applications Folder\n\n*/Library/LaunchAgents (or in /System/Library/LaunchAgents)\n\n*/Library/LaunchDaemons \n\n*/Library/StartUpItems (or in /System/Library/StartUpItems)\n\n*System Preferences > Users & Groups\n\n\nand yet, it is still in the top bar:\n\nAlso, please somebody tell me, whether it is a normal program or a virus, because my friend didn't ever want to install the program and it should not be so hard to uninstall a program ever.\nSome websites suggested installing CleanMyMac3, but I don't want to install any more software unless I am sure that it is okay, because I also read some bad reviews about CleanMyMac.  \n\nA: I recently accidentally installed this app. Then, I carelessly deleted the app without thinking about its associated Library files and menu bar icon.\nIt is likely your friend did the same thing and is now stuck with this useless menu bar quick access icon. In that situation, the uninstall directions won't work because the app is deleted.\nThe easiest way (and only way I know of) to remove this is to re-install MalwareBytes, open the app, and then go to Help > Uninstall MalwareBytes.\nThis will remove the app and all its associated files ... and that menu bar icon.\n\nA: I think the simple answer is to reboot. \nIt sounds like you manually deleted it from the Applications directory and the other locations you checked instead of using the uninstaller. I did the same thing in the past. To run the uninstaller, you would have to install it again. However, if you just reboot it is almost certainly not going to start the toolbar thing again because you already checked a bunch of startup locations.   \nThen there would be no need to purge the remaining files but if you really wanted to you could just search for them\n$ sudo find / -name '*malwarebytes*'\n/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/.../malwarebytes.rb\n/Library/Application Support/Malwarebytes/.../com.malwarebytes.mbam.telemetry \n...\n/private/var/folders/8m/.../C/com.malwarebytes.mbam.frontend.agent\n\nand/or directly delete them\n$ sudo find / -name '*malwarebytes*' -delete\n\n\nA: MalwareBytes is a fully legit malware removal tool. In fact I would avoid CleanMyMac entirely! MalwareBytes is really good. And it doesn't have any sneaky installers like MacKeeper does. What I'm saying is someone definitely installed it on your friends computer.\nWhen fully installed, it has an 'uninstall' option to completely remove it. You can also have it installed but hide the MenuBar item if you so choose. I regularly install and run MacKeeper on my client's computers. People install all sorts of junk on their computers these days. \n\nA: here it is!\nSimply open Malwarebytes and select \"Help\" on the Menu bar, you'll see it there :) \n\nA: I have Malwarebytes and there is an app for it in my applications folder. Maybe you missed it when looking. To remove it I would get an app like AppCleaner. When you move app to trash, AppCleaner will pop up to delete other files related to app. If you don't have an app, how did Malwarebytes get installed? Malwarebytes has been recommended by many sources and has a good reputation and is not a virus. Many apps store files in various locations on your drive. Appcleaner finds these and deletes them.\n", "Q: coconutBattery indicates iPhone 6 problem My iPhone 6 with ios 11.2.1 seems to lose charge too quickly. I connected my iPhone to my iMac and ran the app coconutBattery. the app reports the charge on my phone and the charge capacity. It also reports the design capacity. There is a bar graph which shows a red bar indicating charge current is at 42%. It seems even when my phone is completely charged, it reports full charge capacity is 819 mAh whereas design capacity is 1810 mAh or 42% as reported. This would explain why iPhone discharges so quickly. My question is, is there anything I can do to fix this?  I have included the coconutBattery window.\n\n\nA: The issue here is that coconut battery shows that the design capacity is 45% and that app is probably correct.\nThis means that the battery is dying and needs to be replaced. \nThis can be done by Apple or a third party. \nThis question happened to be the first I read  on the way home after getting my battery replaced at an Apple Store. They need the phone for 2-3 hours. So book an appointment on line or as I did turn up and see if they have a spare slot, they will message you when they do (in my case after an hour). It cost £79.\n", "Q: Night Shift & Flux not working on MacBook Air 6,2 (early 2014) since macOS 10.13.2 Hope anyone might have an idea how to troubleshoot this problem:\nSince I updated my MacBook Air 6,2 (early 2014) to macOS 10.13.2 both Night Shift and Flux have completely stopped working. Meaning no matter how often I start or restart or (re-)install Flux (or change any of the settings), or no matter how often I change the Night Shift switch, I am not getting any kind of red shift whatsoever anymore.. Both used to work fine before.\nI've found a lot of discussions online regarding similar problems but all seem to boil down to either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Too old hardware, which shouldn't be the case for a 2014 MacBook Air.\n\n*Deleting ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagementagent/backgrounditems.btm as discussed here.\n\n\nI tried the solution mentioned by point 2 but unfortunately it didn't do anything for me. \nDoes anyone know a way to pinpoint more closely what might be the cause of this problem?\n\nA: Go to the 'Display' tab and check the 'Scaled' option instead of 'Default for display' (or vice-versa). Then, simply select whichever text option fits you better.\nOnce you select one, the display will reset automatically and you'll be having the correct display profile along with Night Shift working again.\nAdded the solution to Apple forums as well.\n\nA: In my case, simply restarting my computer fixed this issue. Both F.lux and the Invert Screen option that I sometimes use at night (part of Accessibility features) were not working after upgrading to High Sierra. So, I suspected this issue was larger than just F.lux. I initially opened the above path but that led to an empty folder (there was no backgrounditems.btm file). As the suggestion involves both deleting backgrounditems.btm and restarting, I opted to see if maybe the latter would suffice and it did. In case it's helpful, I'm on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013).\n\nUPDATE: F.lux and Invert Screen still work but now every time I connect or disconnect my laptop to an external LED Cinema Display or projector, the invert screen option gets triggered and must be manually un-inverted. Not a big deal but clearly a bug in High Sierra. \n\nA: I had to do 2 things to get Night Shift working (macOS 10.13.6):\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure system services have location permissions enabled: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > bottom left corner, click the lock to unlock, enter password > Privacy tab > right pane, scroll to the bottom to System Services > click \"details\" button > check everything > done\n\n*Turn on your WiFi: System Preferences > Network > highlight \"WiFi\" in left pane > click gear icon at the bottom of left pane > choose \"Make Service Active\" > right pane, choose \"Turn WiFi On\" > connect to a WiFi network\n\n\nI found both of above was needed. I had disabled by WiFi adapter/service because I have my iMac hard wired with ethernet. It looks like MacOS needs the WiFi to find your location. I stumbled onto this when I was editing my time zone: System Preferences > Date & Time > Timezone > checked \"set timezone automatically using location\" and it had a message to enable WiFi to determine location.\nAs an aside item, you may want to re-order your adapter/services so ethernet is a higher priority than the WiFi so you utilize the fastest connection: System Preferences > Network > click gear icon at the bottom of left pane > choose \"Set Service Order\" > drag ethernet to the top of the list.\n", "Q: entering data in Numbers When I hit Return after entering a number in a cell, the cursor automatically drops down to the next row under the cell.  How can I disable that, so it stays on the cell I entered and I can move on my own to wherever I want to make my next entry?\nI use the num pad when entering into a spreadsheet and it is habitual to hit \"enter\" after inputting numbers into a cell, then arrowing to wherever I need to go next (often to the next column rather than the next row.) There was a way to disable the automatic movement in Excel, but I've not been able to find a way to disable in Numbers.\n\nA: Not exactly what you've asked for, but try pressing Command+Return while the cell is still in edit mode, instead of just Return.

If not, is there anyway to set up shortcuts? \n\nA: This post from Stack Overflow has an answer that seems to outlin the only way to do it (as far as I know): bash - Manipulate OS X windows with script - Stack Overflow. \nI've not been a big fan of the split view, because that \"locks\" you into fullscreen mode, which I am also not a fan of. I know people who accidentally started using fullscreen mode when the green ball behavior changed and so they basically keep opening new windows because they get lost in what is already open, which leads to a crazy amount of fullscreen spaces.\n\n\nMy recommendation would be to use a third party window manager. The only difference is that third party window managers can't adjust the split by dragging the point where the windows meet, but otherwise I'd say they are way better. Third party window managers don't work in fullscreen mode, for obvious reasons.\n\n\n*\n\n*Spectacle - Free \n\n\n*\n\n*Probably the best free one.\n\n\n*Moom · Many Tricks - $10\n\n\n*\n\n*Probably the best paid one. I use this one.\n\n*Basically does everything that Spectacle does, but has some added functionality and I'd also say it's more flexible...\n\n*Doesn't have preset shortcuts, but you can set those yourself and is perhaps more flexible than a lot of other ones in terms of what you can do.\n\n*Zoom button hover positioning. Hover over the green plus to get a context menu with the custom positions, layouts and the resize grid.\n\n*Snap to screen edges (kinda like in Windows). You can for example drag a window to the left side of your screen and drop it to resize it to the left half of the screen.\n\n*Grid based positioning/resize. It works by selecting the area you desire to fill in the screen by using a grid.\n\n*You can save layouts. Which basically means that you save the position of specific windows. Then you can you can \"restore\" that layout via shortcut or from a context menu.\n\n*Chaining. If you give multiple \"actions\" the same shortcut, they become chained. To be honest I haven't really had a need to use this. I tend to just have my shortcuts close to each other so I can quickly do different things, like for example: first shortcut to move the window to a different screen and then second shortcut to position it to the right 1/2 or something.\n\n\n*Mosaic $~13\n\n\n*\n\n*I also own this, but I tend to use Moom for no particular reason, other than the fact that I've set the shortcuts in Moom and I mostly use shortcuts, so...\n\n*This is fairly close to Moom in functionality but there are small differences. I just wanted to mention it because I can see some people liking this more than Moom.\n\n*Drag feature that is a bit more flexible than the one in Moom. If dragging windows is your thing, Mosaic is definitely the go to app. Moom doesn't really let you customize those enough to compete with Mosaic in that area.\n\n*Mosaic layouts are just a single position each, so it's not the same as layouts in Moom, which are multiple window position/size snapshots.\n\n\n*\n\n*Also groups may sound at first like snapshots or something, but you can just group layouts, and you can then show them in different situations.\n\n\n*\n\n*For instance, Mosaic has similar window drag functionality as Moom, except you don't need to drag the window to screen sides. You could make it so that you see group A when dragging a window, but show group B in the touchbar.\n\n\n\n*Touchbar support. I'm not sure if Moom or Spectacle support that.\n\n*Remote mobile app, so you can adjust window positions from a phone or a tablet. These always sound cool at first, but I'm not going to leave a phone screen open for a full day at work, you kidding me? And if I have to then open the phone/app to do window management on mac... That just isn't worth it. Better to just use shortcuts or dragging or what ever. I do understand that some people might want to would want to use it..\n\n\n\n\n\nI tend to always set these as my basic shortcuts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Cmd+Alt+← = 1/2 vertical left side of the screen\n\n*Cmd+Alt+→ = 1/2 vertical right side of the screen\n\n*Cmd+Alt+↑ = Maximize - Fills the whole screen.\n\n*Cmd+Alt+↓ = Move to the next screen (Moom can retain the last position/size, which is nice, especially if your screens have different resolutions).\n\n*Cmd+Ctrl+← = 2/3  vertical left side of the screen\n\n*Cmd+Ctrl+→ = 2/3  vertical right side of the screen\n\n*Cmd+Alt+Ctrl+← = 1/3  vertical left side of the screen\n\n*Cmd+Alt+Ctrl+↓ = 1/3  vertical middle of the screen\n\n*Cmd+Alt+Ctrl+→ = 1/3  vertical right side of the screen\n\n*Cmd+Alt+Ctrl+↑ = Center \n\n\nA: macOS Catalina 10.15 onwards\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> App Shortcuts\n\n*Click on the '+' icon\n\n*Set the fields to tile a window to the left or right.

So, I followed Kewal's method but used the menu titles \"Move Window to Left Side of Screen\" and \"Move Window to Right Side of Screen\" (which are hidden menu options that just snap the window to either side, like in Windows/Mac + Better Snap Tools).  (I also added a \"Revert\" to return the window to its original size+position.)\n\n\nA: As others answered, one way is to set up keyboard shortcuts through System Preferences. In my experience of trying them on, they are limited as well as sometimes buggy.\nOne good free, open-source application to set keyboard shortcuts is the Rectangle App. This is based of the now no longer maintained Spectacle App. This app has convenient default options for moving current window to left, right, top, bottom, top-left, etc.\nSee the screenshot below for the default options of Rectangle App.\n\n", "Q: What is the difference between downloading and installing software from AppStore and Terminal For example, what is the difference between installing software (could be operating system update or any other software) from AppStore or from Terminal using softwareupdate command.

Are there some files or registry settings I can check for?\n\nA: The ‘Boot Camp drivers’ are two main things: Boot Camp Control Panel (for adjusting Mac-relevant Boot Camp settings) and drivers for hardware components. This is why Boot Camp refers to the ‘drivers’ as ‘support files’ because there's a little more than just drivers for Windows.\nWindows 10 can automatically install a few of these hardware drivers, such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi without the need to run their installers provided by Boot Camp (occasionally even newer versions are available outside of the Boot Camp drivers). Whilst these drivers are installed as part of the Boot Camp support files, identifying whether they are part of the Boot Camp drivers is an effort in futility.\nThe Boot Camp control panel can be found in the notification area if running, or in the Start Menu or Program Files folder. You can see if the software is installed in Programs and Features in Windows.\nWithout knowing why it's useful for you to know whether Boot Camp is installed, it's not really possible to say where to look, as there are too many independent components which make up the Boot Camp Windows support software.\n\nA: There are several ways\n\n\n*\n\n*Look for the Boot Camp icon in the system tray. It's a gray diamond and when you hover your mouse over it it says Boot Camp\n\n*Open Control Panel, there should be a Boot Camp icon\n\n*Open device manager, there should be several devices listed that show up as \"Apple [name of device]\"\n\n\nAlso note that if you have one or more unknown devices (they'll have little yellow triangles on them in Device Manager) it could be that one or more Apple drivers are not installed, and/or damaged and need to be reinstalled. Run Apple Software Update from the start menu and it should find updated Boot Camp drivers.\n\nA: The command below will list of 3rd party drivers in the Windows drivers store.\ndism  /online  /get-drivers  /format:table\n\nAmongst these drivers are the Apple's Windows Support Software drivers.

I get different results for my IP when I type google \"What is my IP\" and when I type in macOS' terminal ifconfig |grep inet\nWhy are these results different on macOS version 10.13.2 High Sierra?\n\nA: Unless your computer is directly connected to your ISP via the modem, your computer's IP address is actually assigned by your router (either provided by the ISP or yourself). The IP address you see when you go to a whatsmyip website is the public IP address that the ISP has assigned your router, which is the only IP address devices on the internet can talk to when trying to talk to a device on your network. Using a technique called Network Address Translation your router allows multiple devices (e.g. your laptop, your phone and your PlayStation) to share that single public facing IP address from your ISP among each of the devices.\nLikely your devices connected to your internal network have IP addresses like 192.168.XXX.XXX or 172.16.XXX.XXX - 172.31.XXX.XXX or 10.XXX.XXX.XXX. These are Private IP addresses reserved for internal networks and are not usable on the wider internet.\n\nA: The one you get from Google is your external address - your public one, which is actually assigned to the WAN (external) connection of your router by your ISP.\nThe one from ifconfig is your internal, private address - which is assigned from the LAN (internal) interface of your router.\nYou can use the caching utility to find your external, public IP address:\nAssetCacheLocatorUtil 2>&1 | awk '/This.*public/{sub(/\\.$/, \"\"); print $NF}'\n\nYour router uses a structure known as NAT (Network Address Translation) so that packets destined for you are sent to the right computer, without exposing your internal address to the outside world.\nWikipedia link to Network Address Translation - which, honestly, you don't need to know & understand ;)\n\nA: I loved the method using AssetCacheLocatorUtil, so I improved it just a bit by extracting only the IP from the string:\nAssetCacheLocatorUtil 2>&1 | grep public | grep This | awk '{match($0,/[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+/); ip = substr($0,RSTART,RLENGTH); print ip}'\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to add Word files with custom icons to the Dock? Many users will have a few files they access so often they serve a direct link in the MacOS dock. To quickly differentiate between different Word files with the same standard icon, the best way is to use a custom icon (bottom right). This is easily done by copying and pasting a new icon in the Get Info window. The problem is, these icons constantly get deleted by Word (bottom left) when you change the file, making a stable non-default icon impossible (Mac Word 2011 & 2016 on MacOS 10.11).\nDo you have a way to create a dock link to a Word file with a custom icon and have it survive the next round of editing?\n\n\nA: Here's my admittedly inelegant work-around for this problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the icon of the Word file.\n\n*Create an alias. It will inherit the icon of the original.\n\n*Change the name of the alias. I added a space. This will break the icon inheritance.
