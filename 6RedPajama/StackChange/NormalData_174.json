We see two significant issues with the current model - no internal firewalling within an environment, and the inability to expose ports to systems outside the environment selectively.\nWithin an environment it appears that all machines can access any port on any other machine in that environment.  For example, looking at the security groups in a Juju environment deployed on AWS, each instance launched by Juju is in a juju- security group with all UDP and TCP ports open to that security group.  This means that if an attacker compromises any system in the environment they can probably go anywhere.\nAlso, the only way to expose ports outside of the environment is to expose them to any external system - there is no way, for example, to restrict access to a set of IP addresses.\nBoth EC2 and Openstack support internal firewalling and selectively opening ports, and other orchestrators such as Chef and Puppet support these features, so it would be good if Juju could as well.\n\nA: So, you're right.  We could be tighter on security than we are right now with respect to how we handle ports.  We are aware of the issue, but unfortunately it's not on our list of things to address for the next few months.  I've filed a couple bugs to keep track of these issues, so they don't fall through the cracks.  It's possible they could get picked up as tasks to complete in the near term, but I can't say for sure.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju-core/+bug/1321407\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju-core/+bug/1321408\nIf you'd like to talk more about your use cases and what you'd like to see implemented for Juju, I encourage you to post to the Juju mailing list - juju@lists.ubuntu.com\n", "Q: Will there be armel images for 14.04?

Cmd, ⌘, Windows-key). I'd like the order to be Ctrl, Super, Alt instead, and so I have proceeded to remap them.\nThere's a rub, tough, because I regularly attach an external keyboard which has the keys in the correct order already. If I swap the keys here, they end up wrong.\nSo I want to remap/swap the keys for apple keyboards specifically. As a substitute for this, I'd gladly accept remaping the keys for the specific keyboard stuck in my laptop only (as opposed to all apple keyboards automatically).\n\nAfter researching this, I have ended up with a solution that is only half working.\nI am running the following script on login (~/.kde/Autostart/custom-remap.sh), which attempts to remap the keys for my internal keyboard only:\n#!/bin/bash -e\n\nDIRNAME=$(dirname $0)\n\n# Use xinput to target a specific keyboard only:\nAPPLE_KEYBOARD_ID=$(\n    xinput list |\n    grep 'Apple Internal Keyboard' |\n    sed -n 's/.*id=\\([0-9]\\+\\).*/\\1/p'\n)\n\n# Apply mappings from xkb/symbols/custom\n# Maps ctrl, win and alt-keys to be in PC standard positions\nsetxkbmap -device $APPLE_KEYBOARD_ID -print |\n    sed 's/\\(xkb_symbols.*\\)\"/\\1+custom(apple-keyboard-swaps)\"/' |\n    xkbcomp -I$DIRNAME/xkb -i $APPLE_KEYBOARD_ID -synch - $DISPLAY\n\nThis relies on the following file, xkb/symbols/custom:\nxkb_symbols \"apple-keyboard-swaps\" {\n    key <LWIN> { [ Alt_L ] };\n    key <LALT> { [ Super_L ] };\n\n    key <RWIN> { [ Alt_R ] };\n    key <RALT> { [ Control_R ] };\n};\n\n\nThis solution sometimes works perfectly, sometimes has no effect and recently it seemed like a hybrid result took root in my system: Neither of the Alt or Super keys would work properly, they seem to act a little bit as both.\n\"Sometimes\" is really ill defined. I can get into either state after a reboot. Attaching/detaching my external keyboard might trigger a state change. Other times, seemingly at random, the state will switch while I'm using the computer. Running the script multiple times does not seem to affect the state (if it doesn't take the first time, it doesn't take the n-th time either).\n\nHow can I achieve the relevant remapping and have it working reliably?\n(I am currently running Kubuntu 14.04, but it acted similarly under Kubuntu 13.10)\n\nA: I also wanted to do swap cmd and alt keys only on my MacBook Pro, but not when I have a normal external keyboard plugged in.\nFrom the directions here, the following \"just works\" on 14.04 (and likely 13.10): \n\n\n*\n\n*Add options hid_apple swap_opt_cmd=1 to /etc/modprobe.d/hid_apple.conf, creating the file if it doesn't exist\n\n*Rebuild initramfs with sudo update-initramfs -u -k all\n\n*Reboot\n\n", "Q: How to make a python script a command? I'm trying to make a python script into a command, eg: google's ipaddr.py (http://code.google.com/p/ipaddr-py/). I want to be able to type ipaddr and it puts out what I want. Is this possible? I've tried making it executable with chmod +x, then moving it to /bin and it still says:\nNo command 'ipaddr' found, did you mean:\n Command 'ipmaddr' from package 'net-tools' (main)\n Command 'ibaddr' from package 'infiniband-diags' (universe)\nipaddr: command not found\n\n\nA: \nSince ipaddr.py is library for inspecting and manipulating IP address,\n  the first thing you'll want to do is create some objects. You can use\n  ipaddr to create objects from strings, integers or other ipaddr\n  objects.\n\nCheck the following wiki page for examples:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/ipaddr-py/wiki/Using3144\nDepending on your needs, installing the python package from pypi system wide and creating a python script (to later put in /usr/bin) is probably the best option to get a command line utility using ipaddr.\n\nA: I am not familiar with ipaddr, so I can only answer in general, with the title of your question as a starting point:\nLooking at the command you use (in your post) you do not use the extension .py. If you do not use it in your command, you should remove it from the script itself as well (and make it executable indeed). I looked into the name of the script, it is ipaddr*.py*. \nAnd: if you want to invoke the script outside $PATH, you will have to add the path in your command as well.\nresuming:\nRunning a script outside $PATH:\nInvoking a script with language extension -> script name should include extension:\n    python /path/script_name.py (works if script is either executable or not)\n    /path/script_name.py (works only if script is executable, mind the shebang)\n\nInvoking a script without language extension:\n    /path/script_name (only if executable, mind the shebang)\n\nRunning a script in $PATH can be done with language extension, but is considered bad practice, so -> script name should not include extension, run it by the command:\n    script_name (works only if executable, mind the shebang)\n\nOf course, before you rename or move a script to another directory, you should make sure the script is not importing anything from the directory where you are moving it from, and the script itself is not invoked by other scripts.\nTo make it more complicated: if the script is part of a more comprehensive structure in its own directory, but you still want to invoke it separately by its name, you can create a link to the script in ~/bin (ln-sf).\nSo in this particular case: move the script to ~/bin, make it executable, remove its language extension, log out and in, and run it by its name. That is, if the file is / would be a runable script as your question suggests.\n", "Q: Overwritten system files I need help to work out what damage I have done to my Ubuntu server.\nI ran a poorly coded script which has overwritten 26 files on my Ubuntu server.

I don't think their presence will cause any issues, they will likely just be ignored. I could tell you with more certainty if you show the current contents of your /boot.\nThe files in /dev and /run are completely irrelevant since these directories contain special files that are created on boot or upon device connection. Anything you create in those directories will not survive a restart anyway.\nThe files in /sbin might be more of an issue. If you have actually overwritten the files there with ones coming from your Pi, they will almost certainly not run on your Ubuntu because the Pi is a different architecture (ARM) so they will have been compiled for the ARM and will not run on amd64 or i386 or whatever you have on your machine.

It runs fine, except that I have to use the software regularly, and it asks me to enter the password every time I want to use it. I changed the permissions on /usr/local/celtx so that I could use it without gksudo. After that, the software opened without me having to enter the password, but my work wouldn't get saved. It gives me the following error message when I try to save it:\n Celtx was unable to save your project: [Exception... \"Component  \nreturned failure code: 0x80520015 (NS_ERROR_FILE_ACCESS_DENIED)  \n[nsIZipWriter.open]\"  nsresult: \"0x80520015  \n(NS_ERROR_FILE_ACCESS_DENIED)\"  location: \"JS frame ::  \nchrome://celtx/content/save.js :: archiveCeltxProject :: line 1568\"   \ndata: no]  \n\nAny idea about how to fix this?\nLol yeah I changed that to my actual user name.

Changing the permissions of system folders is never a good idea. Instead, set up sudo to let you use this command with no password. Run sudo visudo and add this line:\nyouruser ALL=NOPASSWD:/path/to/celtx\n\nSo, assuming your username is bob and the celtx executable is in /usr/local/bin, you would add this line:\nbob ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/local/bin/celtx\n\nNow you will be able to run sudo celtx without being prompted for a password, If even writing the sudo is too much, just add this line to your ~/.bashrc:\nalias celtx='sudo celtx'\n\nYou can now simply run celtx and you will actually run sudo celtx without entering a password.

I want to make the switch from W7/Ubuntu dual boot to (K)Ubuntu as my only OS when 14.04 is released, but I'm unsure about how to partition my HDD. The general consensus for a good desktop PC partition scheme seems to be around 15--20 GB for  /, 1.1*RAM for swap and the rest for /home (...right?). \nI will be working with some big data sets that I'd like to keep separate from my system. For that reason I thought about keeping /home small and creating a fourth data partition where only work related stuff goes. A few questions about that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there a good reason not to do that and instead keep all my data in /home? I probably won't be jumping distros or something; this is for my work PC and I will likely stay on a 14.04 LTS for a long time.\n\n*If it's a good idea to have a separate data partition: How big should /home be if I don't store any data there? Or should I not make it a separate partition at all then?\n\n\nPlease tell me if this is a stupid idea. I just didn't find myself working in /home at all (mostly on network or on a data partition that I shared with Windows). But then again, /, swap, /home and /, swap, data doesn't seem to be much different apart from the fact that I don't have any linux configuration files floating around in my data backups.\nHere is a somewhat related question, but they don't go into detail whether or not this is a good idea anyway.\n\nA: Go for whatever you like. \nI have my data on a /discworld partition because at work I need more than 1 operating system (RedHat, CentOS, SUSE, Ubuntu, SCO) and it is a lot easier to have all my software in that partition (I use separate /home's per install and symlink the directories to my partition). \nThe data is also on a 2nd disc so I can pull it out of the system and insert it elsewhere. \nFor a single OS it does not really matter. Nowadays installing Ubuntu can be done without loss of /home (even if it is not in a separate partition).\nIf you do not hibernate/suspend you can even go without a swap (my notebook has an ssd as 1st disc and boots in 15 seconds so I just turn it off when I do not need the machine). \n\nPlease tell me if this is a stupid idea. \n\nThere are no stupid idea's when it comes to partitioning. Just what I or others believe to be sane does not make your idea stupid. Just different. Some methods we all agree on are dubious but then again... \nExample: a partition for /var is not really needed for most of us. When you use MySQL /var is going to be filled with larg(ish) files so it can run full. But you can also put the SQL database elsewhere. So it might look weird at first but it is also a valid argument to store the SQL database elsewhere (like in a user partition).\nAny setup will have its flaws and good points. Just make sure your setup ticks all your good points.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 on Amilo LA1703 after istalling graphics doesn't start?

I would like to maximize windows vertically by double clicking on the horizontal boarder like in Windows. Is there a way to get this behavior in Gnome Shell? \nThanks in Advance\nEdit: I forgot to mention that I mean double click.\nLike in this Video\n\nA: TL;DR There is no way to use the border of a window. You can only use the title bar. Open a terminal an use this command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences action-double-click-titlebar toggle-maximize-vertically\n\n\nCheck the settings with:\ngsettings get org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences action-double-click-titlebar\n\nOr you can try the other options:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences action-double-click-titlebar OPTION\n\nOPTION – Current valid options are 'toggle-shade', which will shade/unshade the window, 'toggle-maximize' which will maximize/unmaximize the window, 'toggle-maximize-horizontally' and 'toggle-maximize-vertically' which will 'minimize' which will minimize the window, 'shade' which will roll the window up, 'menu' which will display the window menu, 'lower' which will put the window behind all the others, and 'none' which will not do anything.\n\nA: Not for the border, but for the titlebar. gnome-tweak-tool will let you do this:\nhttps://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/gnome-tweak-tool/\nFor example:\nWindows > Titlebar Actions > Middle-Click > select [Toggle Maximize Vertically]\n\nA: Here's an alternate approach: If you middle click the square (orange x, grey -, grey square)   \n\nthen the window will maximize vertically. I've done that a few times on accident.  Glad to finally figure out what random key stroke caused that. \n\nA: I use a keyboard shortcut.\nGo to Settings, Keyboard, Shortcuts, Windows. Then change 'Maximize window vertically'. I use Ctrl+↑.\n", "Q: (Re)mount all network drives from fstab From Gentoo, I remember a separate /etc/init.d entry for mounting network drives (i.e., separate from local drives).

(sudo mount -a -t cifs -o remount works as well, for remounting after permission / password changes.)\n\nA: You're looking for the -t flag for mount. From man mount:\n   -t, --types vfstype\n   [...]\n\n   More than one type may be specified in a comma  separated  list.\n   The  list of filesystem types can be prefixed with no to specify\n   the filesystem types on which no action should be taken.   (This\n   can be meaningful with the -a option.)

I am current using Ubuntu 13.10 dist and I'm very happy to use Unity than Gnome shell. Now I would like to remove gnome shell completely and install Cinnamon desktop(I just want Unity and Cinammon in my selection) into ubuntu Dist. What is the safety way to do that?\n\nA: By default your ubuntu has unity unless you removed it.\nfor removing gnome\nsudo aptitude remove gnome-shell\n\nand then you may need reboot or just logout and login by unity desktop.\n\nA: The latest versions of cinnamon conflict with gnome packages which is presumably why you want to remove gnome. I don't have gnome installed to check this but on my Debian, installing cinnamon automatically removes gnome. So, almost certainly, running this will be enough:\nsudo apt-get install cinnamon\n\nTest it first by running it in simulate mode:\nsudo apt-get -s install cinnamon\n\nThat will show you the packages that will be installed or removed. There should be along list of gnome packages that will be removed there.

Then, consider migrating your WUBI install to an ordinary system.\n", "Q: Deleted CA Certificates in Firefox I was very silly and deleted all my default CA certificates in Firefox. (I'm using Ubuntu). How do I get them all back?\n\nA: You can create a new a new temporary profile and then copy the cert8.db file from the new profile.\nTo create a new profile you may need to start firefox with:\n\nfirefox -ProfileManager\n\nand then click \"Create profile\". Then start firefox once with the new profile to have it create the profile's files. \nAfter that exit firefox and then copy ~/.mozilla/firefox/[new profile directory]/cert8.db to ~/.mozilla/firefox/[old profile directory]/cert8.db. The profile directories' names end with the name of the profile, so that's how you can know which is the new one and which is the old one. \nFinally switch to your old profile (you may need to start with the -ProfileManager option again) and you should have the default CA configuration.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, so I made a script to recreate the certificates only with pages I like, or dislike, but have to use, as say google:\naddress=www.google.com\nfirefox $(openssl s_client -showcerts -connect $address:443 </dev/null 2>/dev/null|openssl x509 -in - -text |grep \".crt\" | sed -e 's/.*URI:\\(.*\\)\\n*/\\1/') \n\nor\naddress=www.google.com\nfirefox $(openssl s_client -connect $address:443 2>&1 < /dev/null | sed -n '/-----BEGIN/,/-----END/p' | openssl x509 -in - -text | grep \".crt\" | sed -e 's/.*URI:\\(.*\\)\\n*/\\1/')\n\nand reload original page.\nOr in a more elaborate bash script:\n#!/bin/bash\nif [ -n \"$1\" ]; then\n  address=$1\nelse\n  address=$(whiptail --inputbox \"Enter a URL of the page with an unknown issuer (without https://):\" 8 78  --title \"Add a new certificate into Firefox\" 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3) \nfi\ncrt=$(openssl s_client -showcerts -connect $address:443 </dev/null 2>/dev/null|openssl x509 -in - -text |grep \".crt\" | sed -e 's/.*URI:\\(.*\\)\\n*/\\1/')\necho \"Attempt 1: $crt\"\nif [ -z \"$crt\"  ];then \ncrt=$(openssl s_client -connect $address:443 2>&1 < /dev/null | sed -n '/-----BEGIN/,/-----END/p' | openssl x509 -in - -text | grep \".crt\" | sed -e 's/.*URI:\\(.*\\)\\n*/\\1/')\necho \"Attempt 2 (from crl): $crt\"\nfi\nif [ -n \"$crt\" ];then \n    firefox $crt\n    exit\nelse\n    echo No success in finding of crt file.\nfi\n\nThe main task is to extract from URL (say https://www.google.com) so called \"Authority Information Access\" where there is exact URL of crt file, which can be imported into Firefox. This is the easiest way which I have found. \nThe GUI way how to do the same:\n\n\n*\n\n*firefox/preferences/privacy&security/ViewCertificates/CertificatesManager/Servers/addExeption\n\n*Write the URL into the location: https://www.google.com\n\n*Then click: GetCertificate\n\n*Button: View/Details/AuthorityInformationAccess/\n\n*There are the URL of certificate in the Field value:\n\n*CA Issuers: URI: http://pki.goog/gsr2/GTSGIAG3.crt\n\n*OCSP: URI: http://ocsp.pki.goog/GTSGIAG3\n\n*Copy the address crt file: http://pki.goog/gsr2/GTSGIAG3.crt\n\n*and open it in firefox window\n\n*reload original URL\nI do not why, but sometimes firefox imports a crt file and sometimes it just downloads. So I have to import it via this GUI method.\n\n\nWell, the script is faster, but 8 hours of my life, so I hope it will simplify your life... :-)\n", "Q: LDAP authentication: not able to login through GUI but able to login from console I am building a LTSP environment with LDAP authentication.

I.e. by inspecting files etc rather than booting from one.\n\nA: First mount all the ext4 partitions inside /media directory.Then run the below commands.\nI assume, you have 3 ext4 partitions,\n sudo mkdir /media/part1\n sudo mkdir /media/part2\n sudo mkdir /media/part3\n\nCreate directories on/media to get you partitions mounted.\n sudo mount /dev/sdaX /media/part1      \n sudo mount /dev/sdaY /media/part2\n sudo mount /dev/sdaZ /media/part3\n\nMount the partitions on it's corresponding directories.\n cat /media/part1/etc/issue | cut -d' ' -f1,2\n cat /media/part2/etc/issue | cut -d' ' -f1,2\n cat /media/part3/etc/issue | cut -d' ' -f1,2\n\nOutput of any one of the commands from above will give you Ubuntu xx.xx.

How can I play music on my speakers while I use my headset for video chat applications like Skype?\nShouldn't this be possible via this PulseAudio sound server that Ubuntu uses?\n\nA: Routing sound to different sinks with PulseAudio\nYes this is possible, but you need more than one soundcard (PulseAudio calls these sinks) for this to work. Don't worry, if you have something like a headset that is connected via Bluetooth or USB, then this also counts as another soundcard. \nUsing the PulseAudio GUI\nWhile you can configure PulseAudio from the terminal with pacmd (manpage), you don't need to! There is a GUI application called PulseAudio Volume Control that offers this functionality.\n\nUsing plugins for applications\n\n\n*\n\n*If you are already using VLC, you should check that vlc-plugin-pulse is installed.

I tried to copy and paste on the terminal, but it wouldn't work.\nIn other words, I need that same answer but more comprehensively explained and easier to understand since I don't get what to do with the code provided! Please note, I have few skills with computers. Thank you very much! :)\n\nA: Desktop files contain a command to open an application. It is not much more than a textfile, with the extension \".desktop\". Although you can store these files anywhere, and run it as a standalone link to an application (that is: if you make it executable), the default locations are: \n`/usr/share/applications`\n\n(globally) or \n`~/.local/share/applications` \n\n(locally).\nWhat you need to do is paste the text in your post into an empty textfile (open gedit), and change the line:\nExec=sh -c \"cd /home/USER/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files/FOOBAR_FOLDER; wine foobar.exe\"\n\nWhat do you need to change?\nExplanation of the sections of the line:\nExec=\n\nThis means: what comes after this will be executed if the desktop file is invoked. That is actually what would make the application start if you would run it in a terminal.\nsh -c \"cd /home/USER/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files/FOOBAR_FOLDER;\n\nthis is telling the shell to go into the directory where the application is located (the backslash in /Program\\ Files is to escape the space in the name of the Program Files folder, telling the shell not to stop at the space). \nYou should replace USER with your own username, replace FOOBAR_FOLDER with the name of the application folder. If you don't know, open your home directory, press ctrl+h to make the .wine folder visible (if it isn't already), and browse into the directory ~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files to see the name of your application folder.\nwine foobar.exe\n\nThis tells the shell to run foobar.exe with Wine. Replace foobar.exe with the actual application_name.exe.\nFinally, your Exec= line should look something like (if RedNotebook is your application for example):\nExec=sh -c \"cd /home/antortjim/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files/RedNotebook; wine rednotebook.exe\"\n\nThen, after you have changed the line Name=Foobar into a more appropriate name, save the file as (for example) rednotebook.desktop\nIf you want to use the file as a starter on your Desktop, save it there as renotebook.desktop and make it executable. If you want to run it from Dash, move it into ~/.local/share/applications. After log out and back in, it will be available in Dash. You can lock it to the launcher then.\n\nA: A .desktop file is a text file. You have to open a text editor, like Gedit and paste the content and save it.\n", "Q: Start services only when really required I use my desktop box as dev \"server\", so I have installed mysql+apache+whatever. This causes boot to last longer, also memory consumption is high since I have all this services running.\nDoes a software exists which can start a given service only when its port is accessed?\nSay: start apache only when there's a request on localhost:80 and so on.\n\nA: You could probably use knockd to do it if you really wanted to.  I also have quite a few daemons installed for various uses, and I tend to just disable them starting on bootup and manually start them when I need them.  The command to do so would be:\nsudo update-rc.d $serviceName disable\n\nand then the obvious\nsudo service $serviceName start\n\nwhen you actually want it running.\nThe knockd conf I can think of off the top of my head would look something like:\n[ApacheHTTP]\n    sequence = 80\n    seq_timeout = 10\n    command = /usr/bin/service apache2 start\n    tcpflags = syn\n    cmd_timeout = 10\n\netc, etc for all of the services you want.  This will not automatically stop them, however.  You can add a line that says 'stop_command = /usr/bin/service apache2 stop' if you want, but this could shut it down without you wanting to.\n", "Q: Wanting to set up a VNC connection between my Linux Laptop and Windows desktop So I recently received a new laptop and loaded up ubuntu on it.

I cannot seem to figure out how to set this up though, and any pointers would be much appreciated. I already downloaded a VNC server on my Windows 7 box, but I would like to be able to connect when not in the same wireless network (if possible).\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: To do this securely, you have at least 3 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*VNC over Secure Shell (SSH)\n\n*Real VNC Personal edition ($30) which has security options\n\n*Remmina Remote Desktop Client\n\n\nVNC over Secure Shell requires the most work of you. You'll need to setup a SSH Server, VNC server, and forward the port on your router to the SSH server.\nReal VNC Personal edition is apparently much easier since the security is built in.\nRemmina Remote Desktop Client allows you to connect directly to your Windows 7 PC using RDP (assuming you're running Win7 Pro or higher; Home edition doesn't have RDP.)\nHow you do each one is a whole post in and of itself, but you can Google the answers pretty easily.

I am trying to install Ubuntu 13.04 on my laptop using a LiveUSB, which I created in the conventional way given on the Ubuntu official site.\nThe problem is that even after changing the boot order to USB Stick in my BIOS, my system doesn't boot from the LiveUSB. It boots directly from the HDD, due to which I don't see the grub menu and system is automatically booted in Windows 8.\nI tried the same USB on a different system (my assembled desktop which doesn't support UEFI), and it works fine there.

Grub will automatically be updated and see the new kernel, and make it the default boot entry, but without the initrd, it won't work.  The solotion is simply to select the older kernel from the grub menu until you can clear out some free space in /boot and generate the new initrd ( and run update-grub ).\n", "Q: Why has Wubi support been withdrawn? Why has Wubi support been withdrawn from Ubuntu 12.10 onwards? Does Ubuntu 14.04 have Wubi support or not? \n\nA: Wubi is still available for newer versions, including 14.04. Go to this page: http://releases.ubuntu.com/   and choose the version you want. In the list of files at the bottom, the very last one will be wubi.exe. Grab that file and run it.\n\nA: Wubi is officially supported for Windows XP, Vista and 7.  It allows Ubuntu to be installed and uninstalled in a safe, easy way as with any other Windows application.\nNow that Windows 8 came in play, Wubi does not work with Windows 8 default boot-loader.

Okay guys, this is an experimental question warning!\nI often confuse cat and ls when quickly working on the console. Not because I forget their meanings, no. Just because I type without deeply thinking about the command - it just comes automatically. I am sure everyone knows what I am trying to explain: you don't have to think what to type if your task is to list, say, a text file - or a directory.\nNow, why two different commands?\nThings would be more fluently if there was a command that lists a directory if the target is a directory and that lists the content of a file if the target is a file.\nDoes such a command exist?\nI know there are editors (e. g. vim) with the ability to list a directory. But this is not what I want, as I want to stay on the console. Second, after opening a file through the vim directory listing there is no way back - at least none that I know.\nIf there is no out-of-the-box solution I will try to make a small bash script (wrapper) to cat and ls. But this is not preferred, because when working with many different systems it has to be placed on each of them...\n\nA: Simply put this function is your .bashrc:\ncatls()\n{\n  [[ -f \"$1\" ]] && cat \"$1\" || ls \"$1\";\n}\n\nIt will cat regular files but call ls for directories\n\nA: Hate to necrobump and unable to just comment; but fix for when nothing is passed.\ncatls() { [[ -f \"$1\" ]] && cat \"$1\" || ls \"${1:-.}\"; }\n\n", "Q: Weird Wireless Issue on 12.04 I am having this weird issue with my wireless card (Intel Centrino Wireless n130).\nIf I restart the computer via the  interface when it restarts it doesn't seem to recognize my wifi card. However when I press the power button to restart my computer it works! I honestly can't figure out why. However once I do have it working it works perfectly fine :S just having a problem at startup it seems. I want to fix the program so that I'm not pressing the power button to turn on/off and restart my computer constantly.\nI am new to Ubuntu so please be gentle. Lol\n\nA: Problems with Wireless cards are common, due to the large number of cards.\nAs you are using Ubuntu 12.04, this version permits you upgrade your kernel to the\nones used by the new versions of ubuntu, such Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander). So you\njust need to install the new kernel from the command line:\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-saucy\nThis will install the kernel version 3.11. Normally installing the new versions of the kernel sanes the problems with wireless cards.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How do you fix a gcc compile 127 error? sudo apt-get install g++ doesn't work *emphasized text*when I try to run a program I get the following error.\nubuntu@ubuntu-VirtualBox:~/Desktop$ make\ng++ -Wall -Wno-switch -I. -g   -c -o pass.o pass.cpp\nmake: g++: Command not found\nmake: *** [pass.o] Error 127\n\nI couldn't get gcc 4.8.2 installed because it said it couldn't find it.

I'm developing a file sync daemon on Ubuntu as a hobby project, and I'm thinking I might want to develop a graphical front-end at some point which will let me control it. How can a GUI control and communicate with a daemon program?

It's quite a stable system (especially with the persistent option set), and generally runs without any issue. However, from time to time the connection from our ISP to our office drops out, and this disconnect is long enough to prevent the VPN tunnel from staying open.\nI've set up a simple script to detect if the firewalled database is still available over the VPN and, if not, it attempts to reopen the VPN.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nDATE=`date`\n\nHOST=10.1.2.1\n\nPING_RESULT=`ping -c4 $HOST`\n# gets the percentage of lost packets\nPING_LOSS=`echo $PING_RESULT : | grep -oP '\\d+(?=% packet loss)'`\n\necho \"$DATE : Loss Result : $PING_LOSS\"\n\n# if 100% packet loss on the ping - assume connection lost\nif [ \"100\" -eq \"$PING_LOSS\" ];\nthen\n        echo \"$DATE : Connection Lost\"\n        pon VPN_TUNNEL\n        echo \"$DATE : Restarted Connection\"\nelse\n        echo \"$DATE : Connection OK\"\nfi\n\nI've saved the script as /root/cron/pptp-monitor and set the permissions as -rwxr--r-- root root\nThe script works great when run manually (using sudo) - but the cron I've configured doesn't work properly:\n*/5 *     * * *     root   [ -x /root/cron/pptp-monitor ] && /root/cron/pptp-monitor >> /var/log/pptp-monitor.log 2>&1\n\nThe monitor script runs - I see the log entries every 5 minutes - but the pon command doesn't actually seem to fire off.\nIn the syslog, I see this every 5 minutes:\nApr 17 08:45:01 bombur CRON[774]: (root) CMD (  [ -x /root/cron/pptp-monitor ] && /root/cron/pptp-monitor >> /var/log/pptp-monitor.log 2>&1)\nApr 17 08:45:14 bombur pppd[784]: pppd 2.4.5 started by root, uid 0\nApr 17 08:45:14 bombur pppd[784]: Using interface ppp0\nApr 17 08:45:14 bombur pppd[784]: Connect: ppp0 <--> /dev/pts/0\nApr 17 08:45:14 bombur pppd[784]: Modem hangup\nApr 17 08:45:14 bombur pppd[784]: Connection terminated.\n\nThe lines \"using interface ppp0\" to \"connection terminated\" are repeated 10 times before exit - indicating that the tunnel is trying to reopen unsuccessfully.

This means that you have both an intel / nvidia graphics chipset, that work together in certain ways to save power. It could be that your linux OS cannot find the nvidia chip , and hence cannot render anything on screen.

When I reboot the machine I get a kernel panic 3 out of 5 times, sometimes multiple times in row, but then it will eventually just work.\nThis is the error that I get:\nTarget filesystem doesn't have requested /sbin/init.\nrun-init: opening console: No such file or directory\nKernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init! exitcode=0x00000100\n\nWell, obviously /sbin/init does exist as sometimes the system loads without any issue with no changes to anything whatsoever.\nMoreover the machine is brand new and memtest suggests there's no issue with the RAM itself.\nHere is how my setup was prepared:\n\n\n*\n\n*I've compiled Ubuntu-3.11.0-18.32 kernel with built-in aufs and squashfs support on an external 64-bit Ubuntu server 12.04 VirtualBox VM.\n\n*The kernel was installed on target machine and I've made a squashfs out of a copy of the filesystem with -always-use-fragments option.\n\n*I've installed Debian's live-boot-3.0.1-1 scripts in order to be able to boot the squashfs to RAM. The grub menu entry looks like this: \nmenuentry 'Ubun2RAM' --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {\nlinux   /boot/vmlinuz-$(uname -r) BOOT=LIVE boot=live toram=filesystem.squashfs rw quiet splash apparmor=0 security=\"\" $vt_handoff kernel.panic=1\ninitrd  /boot/initrd.img-$(uname -r)\n}\n\nThis is based on the Ubun2RAM guide available at http://roadha.us/2013/01/resilient-ubuntu-boot-to-ram-usb-stick/, the main difference being that in my case the \"thumb box\" and \"target\" is one Ubuntu server installation.\nI've tried to either find out what's causing the kernel panics or to force the system to restart upon encountering one by passing kernel.panic=1 as a boot parameter or by putting the same into /etc/sysctl.conf.The problem is that I can't view any logs from a failed start-up attempt (as the system boots into RAM) and the system never reboots after a kernel panic occurs (despite having configured it that way, or so I thought).An ideal solution would be to get rid of the kernel panics, however I'd be satisfied with having the system reboot when a kernel panic occurs.\nAny input is appreciated.MJD\n\nA: I've managed to figure this out.\nApparently the old drive on which I've stored the filesystem image sometimes isn't ready when an access attempt is made (and I found out about that by accident). I never expected a live-boot version marked as 'stable' to not have the functionality to wait for the drive to become ready, but that appears to be the case. Fortunately I found out that there's a 4.x alpha branch and updating to 4.0~alpha21 solved my issue.\nI also made sure that the problem wasn't associated with my kernel and got the exact same result with 3.11.0-20.34 kernel sources compiled on the machine in question.\n", "Q: Manage Certificates in Google Chrome When managing certificates in Google Chrome settings->certificate manager->my certificates tab says:\nYou have certificates from these organizations it also wants me to import a certificate.

I suspect you were missing a few (like 8080, which is commonly used).  You can use a tool like netstat to see which ports you are using at any given time.  I think \nnetstat -u\nnetstat -t\n\nmay do it, but there is probably something better out there!  Be careful what options you pass to netstat because it also lists internal sockets.  Above, the -u is for udp and the -t is for tcp ports.\nYou may also try searching to see if someone has created a ufw application profile and set ufw to allow the specified profile using\n    sudo ufw allow Name\nFinally, if something breaks, you can check your ufw logs to see what you need to add to make it work.  Just keep in mind that other programs may need other ports.

So my plan is to shrink my c drive and create an unallocated space. My question is can I use something else option now? Can I delete that unallocated space and create new drive to install Ubuntu? \n\nA: You don't delete unallocated space, its space thats empty. The reason you can't create a new partition is because you reach your 4 primary limit or 3 primary 1 extended limit on MBR. It would be easier for use to see your drive format, Open cmd and type \"diskmgmt.msc\" then post a picture.     \nI'm going to guess your layout since there usally similar. There could be a 199mb \"SYSTEM\" partiton, then windows, then recovery, and last tools. You could convert the tools into a logical partiton, then shrink the windows partiton and move it behind the tools. Last you would create a new partition, in which you would install ubuntu in. Ease Partiton is free and makes things alot easier (note: it can't read ext4). As always Backup your data!\n\nA: The four-primary-partition limit exists for the Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning system, but not for the newer GUID Partition Table (GPT) system. Most computers sold with Windows 8, and some sold with Windows 7, particularly since mid-2011, use GPT. So do Intel-based Macs. Thus, it's possible that you're concerned over nothing.\nIf your disk uses MBR, then you'll have to either delete one of your four existing partitions or, as Aaahh suggests, convert one from primary to logical form. Most partitioning tools can't do this conversion, but some can. In the Linux world, AFAIK only my FixParts (part of the Ubuntu gdisk package) can do the trick, at least directly. There are caveats, though; see the FixParts documentation for details. I've heard that some Windows tools can do it, too, but I don't know details about them. If you do such a conversion, you've got to be careful about which partition you convert. Most importantly, you should not convert the Windows boot (usually C: in Windows) partition to logical.\n", "Q: Uninstall Ubuntu 13.10 I downloaded Ubuntu 13.10 so that I could remove the administrator password on my laptop since I forgot it.I was in \"try Ubuntu\" mode while trying to recover/reset the password, but I kept running into issues. \nI hit \"Install\" the next time, went through the steps up to the part where it didn't give me an option to install alongside Windows Vista.

For example, I just installed Kile (publishing program) from the Software Center, but I can't find a link/tile/icon/shortcut to open it. Thanks, to whomever can help.\n\nA: In Ubuntu you can easily find GUI programs that you installed from the Ubuntu Software Center by searching for them in the Dash as you mentioned in your question, but if you can't open the Dash or if the program you installed was not a GUI program, you can also find the executable file for the program from the terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n*Typing the name of the application in the terminal will usually open the application for you.  \n\n*If that doesn't work you can find the package name of an application, if you have it installed, from the terminal using dpkg -l | grep <substitute-search-term-here> and then open it by typing its package name. For example, to find the package name of Chromium if you have it installed type:  \ndpkg -l | grep chromium  \n\n...which will return results including:\nii  chromium-browser  \nChromium browser  \n\nThe package name of Chromium browser is chromium-browser, so to open Chromium from the terminal you would type: chromium-browser\nThe dpkg -l | grep chromium command doesn't work for applications that have a completely different package name like the Files application in Ubuntu which is provided by the nautilus package. In this case run the following command:\nlocate -b '.desktop' | xargs grep -ls '^Name.*=Files$' | xargs grep '^Exec.*'\nThe application name Files in the above command is case sensitive, and so is any other application name that you replace it with.\nIf you know only the name of a file from an installed package, you can find the name of the package that installed it using this command:  \ndpkg-query -S <filename>\n\n\nA: Press Alt+F2, and just type the name of the program.\n\nA: If the package is properly installed, dpkg-query -S $(which totem)\nprovides results in the form package: full/path/to/program as shown in the example below. Just replace totem with the name of the program you are looking for.\ndpkg-query -S $(which totem)\ntotem: /usr/bin/totem\n\nThe $(which program) uses the output of which as a parameter for the dpkg-query which in my experience provides much cleaner output than many of the alternative methods. Compare to dpkg-query -S totem and the even less accurate apt search totem\nIf you haven't installed the package or something is broken with the installation and you don't get the expected results you can always get info on what package contains a program (or file} using Ubuntu Packages Search\n\nA: You can list all your installed applications using:\napt list --installed\n\napt list is similar to dpkg-query and also accepts globs for matching package names, as can be seen in man apt:\nlist\n    list is somewhat similar to dpkg-query --list in that it can display a list of packages\n    satisfying certain criteria.

To that end, I installed wicd, which seems to be great for configuring the network. However, booting the machine is taking forever because of the infamous \"Waiting for network configuration\" issue.\nI've already changed my /etc/network/interfaces file and changed references from eth0 to wlan0, to no avail.\nWhat strikes me is that I'm seeing something like:\n...\nWaiting for network configuration...\nWaiting 60 more seconds for network configuration\nContinuing without network configuration\n...\n* Starting network configuration daemon wicd         [OK]\n...\n\nCan I start wicd before waiting for network configuration?

Since it is a private server, I originally created a CA, then used the CA to sign the server certificate.  The CA cert is properly installed on my client system, the server key and cert are installed on the server.\nNow, I have created a CRL and divined that the CRL need not go on the server (except to distribute far and wide if I had any other users), but does need to be installed on my desktop machine so that OpenSSL won't accept the original key.  So, I copied the CRL file into /etc/ssl/crl.

This strikes me as the kind of thing that has to be trivial for end users who know nothing in order to ensure internet security.\n\nA: To use OpenSSL s_client with CRL verification you have to do various undocumented things, which I've described in https://superuser.com/questions/742231/s-client-not-failing-on-revoked-certifcate/742289#742289.\nApart from that I don't know if any application using OpenSSL does CRL checks at all, because I think you have to explicitly enable these checks in the API and then put the CRL at unexpected places.

So that the interface can be designed by click and drag. Is there any plugins for eclipse or any existing ide to do this?\n\nA: Bash is a Shell. A shell is a command-line interpreter, an interface for you to call other programs/commands. That's why it is called Command Line Interface or CLI. So, a shell scripting language provides constructs that facilitates this interaction (sometimes some CLI tools via builtin), but rarely provides any GUI tools to build graphical interface. It's not a full-fledge language with its own graphical components. You can use these shells to call other CLI tools (most commonly) and sometimes a GUI tool (like zenity). \nSince Shells never provide GUI building support, there can be no question of having a GUI building tool for them.\nYes, as I already have said, you can use zenity or other similar tools to bring GUI components, but those are all third party libraries called from bash, not bash things themselves (Zenity is a GNOME tool).\nCheck this answer to a similar question here on Unix SE site.

This is a bug in LightDM and a bug report has already been filed.\nThe reason why you end up with this failsafe X is because the pantheon-greeter you installed along with the elementary desktop is now not available and LightDM is not able to identify an alternative greeter.\nAs a workaround, you can edit the LightDM conf file and correct the error.\nRun the following command in a terminal:\n     sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n\nand change the line\n     greeter-session=pantheon-greeter\n\nto\n     greeter-session=unity-greeter\n\nand save it.\nAfter changing the file, reboot and you will now be greeted with Unity greeter.\"\nIf this workaround does not do the trick for you, my suggestion is to install the following packages in the terminal console (press Ctrl+Alt+F1 and login with your username and password):\n     sudo apt-get install mdm\n\nMDM is a very friendly login greeter app with a highly customizable interface. You will be prompted when installing mdm to choose your default display manager, and you can choose mdm instead of lightdm and press ok to finish installing MDM. If, for any reason, you want to revert your display manager back to LighDM, you can do so by running the following code in the terminal console:\n     sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\nYou should also install a decent video driver for your video card from the official support page for Radeon cards. They have drivers for both 32bit and 64bit Linux/ Ubuntu, and you can install them easily with just a few clicks.\nYou can also install:\n    sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop\n\n    sudo apt-get install xfce4*\n\nReboot and when you get to the MDM greeter, you can choose to boot into the xfce session, and not the gnome session or unity. This way you'll be able to get to a graphical desktop session, install your video driver and maybe fix the issues you're having with unity greeter so you be able to login into a Gnome session too.\n", "Q: Software manager I am using Ubuntu 13.10 on my NEC-Powermate vl280 along with win 7.

I am new to Ubuntu. what can I do to fix it?\nI tried to install vlc by running the this command sudo apt-get install vlc in the terminal and it worked. but what about the software center?\n\nA: Use Synaptic Package manager and see if you can install software that way. It is possible Synaptic is not present on your system so you'll have to install it. To do so, press Ctrl+Alt+T, to open a terminal, and type in the terminal this code:\n sudo apt-get install synaptic\n\nEnter your password when prompted and wait for the results. If synaptic it already installed, you can open it by typing sudo synaptic in the same terminal. You can still use Software Center to install software. With Synaptic, install a lightweight version of the software center called lubuntu-software-center. Install it and test it to see whether it works better than ubuntu software center. If it does not, then you can use Synaptic to install all the software that you need. Make sure that you also enable the Canonical partners and Independent repositories in synaptic by going to Synaptic menu - Settings - Repositories - Other Software. After you check Canonical partners and Independent close the window and reload your software list with the Reload button from Synaptic.\nOne other way to install software in ubuntu is to install aptitude package with this code in a terminal:\n sudo apt-get install aptitude\n\nYou can use aptitude in a terminal emulator the same way you use apt-get typing a code like:\nsudo aptitude install <package name>\n\n", "Q: No wifi with xubuntu 12.04 on Dell Inspiron 8600 I've just installed Xubuntu 12.04 on an old Dell Inspiron 8600 laptop, because of the lack of a pae, and everything works fine except wifi.\nI've followed the instructions on the Wifi help page and have installed the b43legacy driver as directed, but it's not working. \nI've tried removing the bcmwl driver package, but it's not installed. \n\nA: Your device does not require b43legacy.

I was upgrading from 13.10 to 14.04 (dev for now, stable in a few hours) using do-release-upgrade and encountered the following problem:\nCan not upgrade \n\nYour python install is corrupted. Please fix the '/usr/bin/python' symlink.\n\nI solved the problem after messing around a bit, so I'd like to share my solution here. Hope this could help someone.\n\nA: My problem turned out to be solely due to an altered /usr/bin/python symlink as suggested in the error message. I was using update-alternatives with /usr/bin/python so it was pointing to /etc/alternatives/python. Turned out that do-release-upgrade is really strict with this symlink and merely selecting python2.7 with update-alternatives isn't enough, so I ended up forcing it to its original state:\nsudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python\n\nAnd that solved the problem.\nIf this doesn't work for you, then I guess you have a genuinely corrupted python install. I'd suggest\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall python\n\n\nA: In Ubuntu 18.10 there is still the same issue. \nThe /usr/bin/python is linked to an older version. Even later than 2.7 are available but this super-smart process is asking (in 18.10!) for P 2.7. So I gave it and it was accepted. \nThis solved it for me:\n1) delete /usr/bin/python doing sudo rm  /usr/bin/python\n2) Create a new link sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python\nIn 18.10 I could NOT use sudo update-alternatives --remove-all python  or sudo apt-get install --reinstall python . \nWorks for me. Hope it helps you,  too. \n\nA: If you run into this regarding /usr/bin/python3 then:\nsudo update-alternatives --remove-all python3\nsudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.6 /usr/bin/python3\n\nMake sure to symlink python3.6 and not 3.7. At least that was required when upgrading Ubuntu 18.10 to 19.04. \n\nA: For Ubuntu 19.04 the default python version is 3.7 . I got same error while upgrading to Ubuntu 19.10, and, the following helped:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall python3\nsudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.7 /usr/bin/python3\n\nIn case you have very serious problems with your python package, the only way left is to force remove it, and then reinstall it:\nsudo dpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq --force-depends python3\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\n\nA: this one is correct:\nsudo update-alternatives --remove-all python\nsudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python\n\n", "Q: Flash Player Web Page Issue I am using Ubuntu 13.10.

To install Flash player plugin for Firefox in Ubuntu you have to open Synaptic package manager, and type in the search field these keywords: flash player.\nTo open Synaptic, press Ctrl+Alt+T to open a terminal window, and in that window type this code:\n  sudo synaptic\n\nEnter your password when prompted for it and wait for the application to load. Do not close the terminal window. If synaptic is not present on your system, you need to install it by running this code in the same terminal window:\n  sudo apt-get install synaptic\n\nAfter you open Synaptic Package Manager, go to Settings - Repositories - Other Software and check the Canonical Partners and the Independent repos. Close the window for repositories and reload your software sources with the reload button from Synaptic menu. \nNext you can type in the search field flash player as keyword and after getting the results look for and install the following packages: adobe-flashplugin and adobe-flash-properties-gtk.

I also know that the ODAC supports I2S.\nThe question I have is, which do I have to select to get I2S output via USB? I know that the ODAC does NOT support S/PDIF so it is very strange to see it there. Is Ubuntu displaying I2S as S/PDIF incorrectly? Or does the Analogue Output actually mean I2S? Or would selecting the Analogue Output process the sound through my laptop's DAC and bypass the external DAC?\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\nA: As discussed in What does USB DAC \"Analog Output\" mean?, I suspect that Analog Output means that the OS will first pass the digital stream to the inbuilt, computer DAC device (i.e. sound card), and then the analog stream will be passed on to the USB device for amplification and further to your headphones/speakers. The improvement in quality (versus the computer DAC) will be minimal, and will come only from the external DAC amplifier. \nDigital Output means tha the OS fiddles not with the digital stream and passes it directly to the external DAC device for conversion to analog, amplification, and then to your headphones/speakers. The quality should be much better, and will depend on the quality of the external DAC (since the inbuilt DAC will be completely bypassed). \nSo for best quality you would choose the Digital Output port. \nSee also: \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I enable digital output on a FiiO E7 without ending session?. \n\n", "Q: Where to place my local website starting with the 2.4.7 version of apache2? I recently installed Ubuntu 14.04, then I installed lamp-server and placed my webpages in /var/www directory, but when I opened localhost in the browser there was nothing.\nI think that happened because Zend updated Apache.\nWhatever the reason may be, I want to know where to keep my php files so that I can access them from my browser.\n\nA: The apache2 version that was published when the Ubuntu 14.04 release was made is 2.4.7 and starting with this version it seems that, for security reasons, the new root directory for the server is:\n/var/www/html\n\nSo, from now on, this is where you must place the files for your (local) website. You should not have this problem again with the future updates.\n\nAnyway, if you want to change this directory with another one, you have to modify (as root) the following line from /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf file (sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf):\nDocumentRoot /var/www/html\n\nto\nDocumentRoot /path/to/another/directory\n\nAfter this, for the new changes to take effect, you have to restart the apache server using the following command:\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\n\nA: Instead of modifying /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf back to the old version, I prefer keeping default package files unmodified.\nA reason for this is that so it wouldn't break during the next upgrade again which might reset the 000-default.conf file.\nBesides, such modifications are not done just to annoy us, the modification was done for a good reason, as this bug report in Debian explains.\n\nOur webservers [sic] set the default document root to /var/www, whereas\n  site-local administrators tend to use /var/www/example.com. This has\n  security implications if visitors access the default document root,\n  bypassing the /supposed/ document root of example.com. That's\n  problematic if sensitive data is placeѕ outside the supposed\n  document root (e.g. consider a hypothetical\n  /var/www/example-com-db.conf configuration file).\n\nA better solution would be to move the sites files from /var/www to /var/www/html/.\n# 1. move all files excluding the `html` directory\nsudo mv /var/www/[!html]* /var/www/html\n# 2. Move the hidden files as well which are skipped in previous command\nsudo mv /var/www/.[!.]?* /var/www/html/\n\nAlso, another possible solution is to create another Virtual Host and disable the default one with the command sudo a2dissite 000-default\n", "Q: Serial port emulator or simulator I am running Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS on a PC with no serial ports.

I haven't seen an update on the status of removing Python 2 from the CD images, and this page has last been updated late 2013.\n\nA: For 14.04: server and desktop images\nThe situation is:\n\n*\n\n*there is no python2 on the server image\n\n*but python2 is part of the the desktop image\nThe logic\nI quote:\n\nIt is a release goal for Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) that we ship only Python 3 on the touch, server, and desktop images. Don't worry, Python 2.7 will still be available in the archive, and more specifically 'main' for now.\n\nPython 2 is removed from the server images, you are absolutely right! For the server, don't worry python2 is still in the repos and can thus easily be installed.\nNow the migration to python3 is not completely finished for the desktop (which involves more python packages than the server).

Randomly picking a few:\nlibreoffice-*\npython-*\nxfce4-* \n\nThe list is huge. A considerable number of system parts have been uninstalled. Now this seems like a serious deviation from what I expect when I run apt-get install.\nWhat is going on?\n\nA: Take a look in /var/log/apt/history.log to see what exactly has been removed. Then, just reinstall these packages.\n\nA: The problem is the following (from man apt-get):\n\ninstall\ninstall is followed by one or more packages desired for\n         installation or upgrading. Each package is a package name, not\n         a fully qualified filename (for instance, in a Debian system,\n         apt-utils would be the argument provided, not\n         apt-utils_0.9.12.1_amd64.deb). All packages required by the\n         package(s) specified for installation will also be retrieved\n         and installed. The /etc/apt/sources.list file is used to locate\n         the desired packages. If a hyphen is appended to the package\n         name (with no intervening space), the identified package will\n         be removed if it is installed. Similarly a plus sign can be\n         used to designate a package to install. These latter features\n         may be used to override decisions made by apt-get's conflict resolution system.\n\nSo, adding a hyphen to the end of a package name means \"remove that package\". Specifically, in your case, it would remove these:\nNote, selecting 'libgtk2.0-doc' for regex 'libgtk2.0'\nNote, selecting 'libgtk2.0-cil' for regex 'libgtk2.0'\nNote, selecting 'libgtk2.0-bin' for regex 'libgtk2.0'\nNote, selecting 'libgtk2.0-common' for regex 'libgtk2.0'\nNote, selecting 'libgtk2.0-0' for regex 'libgtk2.0'\nNote, selecting 'libgtk2.0-cil-dev' for regex 'libgtk2.0'\nNote, selecting 'libgtk2.0-0-dbg' for regex 'libgtk2.0'\nNote, selecting 'libgtk2.0-dev' for regex 'libgtk2.0'\n\nIn other words, you removed the entire gtk2 library set, and a lot of programs depend on gtk2. As a result, a lot of programs were removed.\nSo, no, this is not a bug. It is, admittedly, surprising behavior if you don't know about it but it is documented and intended. \n", "Q: How to remove a lot of packages installed at a particular time? Here is the situation: say, at 17:00, I installed a lot of packages, I can see them in the ubuntu software center history. Also I can see them in the dpkg log file using the method provided by this thread. My question is: how can I delete them easily. There are so many, I can't delete them one by one in synaptic.\nThe thread I linded may have explain the method. However, I can't see the time specified in the command, for I don't want delete any other packages installed at other time.\n\nA: Try this command,\nawk '$1~/yyyy-mm-dd/ && $2~/hh:mm:ss/ && $3~/install/ { print $4}' /var/log/dpkg.log | xargs -I{} sudo apt-get -y remove {}\n\nExample:\nawk '$1~/2014-04-17/ && $2~/15:55:03/ && $3~/install/ { print $4}' /var/log/dpkg.log | xargs -I{} sudo apt-get -y remove {}\n\nThe above command will remove all the packages which are installed on 2014-04-17 at the time 15:55:03.\n\nA: /var/log/dpkg.log lists all install commands with time stamps, just do a grep.  Also, /var/log/apt/history.log lists all apt-get activity, including packages installed or removed in one go.\n\nA: If you installed that through apt, you can use /var/log/apt/history.log. It's structure is as such:\nStart Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\nCommandline: apt-get install package1 package2 package3 . . .\nInstall: library1 libary2 package1 package2\nEnd-Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\n\nKnowing that we can use awk to search for particular date and time, descend one line bellow that, get rid of apt-get install line, leaving only the list of packages. For instance, here's a sample command:\nawk -F':' '/2015-06-05  16:02:43/ {getline; gsub(\"apt-get install\",\"\"); print $2}' /var/log/apt/history.log\nYou can add pipe to xargs apt-get remove to remove those packages.\nawk -F':' '/2015-06-05  16:02:43/ {getline; gsub(\"apt-get install\",\"\"); print $2}' /var/log/apt/history.log | xargs apt-get remove\n", "Q: Subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 247 for gconf2 When I want to install any package I am getting this:\nroot@kd32206:~# apt-get install nginx\nReading package lists...

I am able to choose Secure boot or not, but I haven't found any EFI options in the BIOS. The HDD is recognized as \"UEFI: ADATA SX900\" by the BIOS. The original Win 8 HDD that the shipped with the PC was replaced by a brand new SSD 128 GB disk prior to the Ubuntu install.\nRegression:\n\n\n*\n\n*I got 13.10 to boot after hours of trial and error with boot-repair and trying different BIOS settings. After upgrading to 14.04 I encountered this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/1289977 which I tried to fix with boot-repair. Repeated the same steps that got it working in 13.10, but no luck. I am back to: ...No boot disk has been detected...\n\n*Fresh clean install of 14.04 on a wiped SSD, Ubuntu defaults for a single OS boot results in ERROR: No boot disk has been detected or the disk has failed..\n\n*I have tried both Secure Boot On and Off, no difference.\n\n*As before, boots fine with the help of Supergrubdisk.\n\n\nA: It should be booting OK now. My suspicion is that you've got a buggy firmware that refuses to boot anything but Microsoft's EFI boot loader. The workaround to this is to rename your boot loader to use either the default filename (EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi) or the name used by Microsoft's boot loader (EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi). You can rename either GRUB or rEFInd to one of these names, since you've got them both installed. The rEFInd documentation covers this in more detail here:\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html#naming\nYou can do the same thing from the \"Advanced\" menu in Boot Repair; however, that tool is reporting problems with the version of GRUB, which makes me a bit wary of continuing to use it -- it could be you're running into a bug that could end up preventing it from doing what it should, and that might even make matters worse.\n\nA: Answered by OP in original question:\n\nFinally got it to work! I am not quite sure what does it, but after\n  installing Gummiboot AND updating Grub2 it suddenly started to\n  recognize my .efi files. According to efibootmgr I now have three\n  entries: BootCurrent: 0001 Timeout: 1 seconds BootOrder:\n  0001,0004,0005 Boot0001* UEFI: ADATA SX900 Boot0004  Windows Boot\n  Manager Boot0005* Gummiboot\nI also tried to set BootOrder to Boot0004 and it worked. Removed the\n  Ubuntu (originally created by the Ubuntu install) and since then it\n  seems to work repeatedly. I don't get any boot menu though, it boots\n  right into Ubuntu following a brief purple frame showing up around the\n  edges of the screen.\nI would like to mark this as \"Solved\", but as I am not quite sure what\n  did the trick it might not be all that helpful to others.\n\n\nA: It's a little difficult to understand your question, but it sounds to me like you may have installed Ubuntu on your SSD while your harddisk was attached, adding the boot loader to the harddisk rather than the SSD. Then you've removed the harddisk for the BIOS to load from, so you can't boot from the SSD. If this is the case, I recommend simply reinstalling from the 14.04LTS image with only the SSD connected. The default is to install the boot loader to the first disk, because that's usually the disk BIOS tries to boot from. \n\nA: Install Gummiboot and update Grub2\nrecognizes .efi files as a result. efibootmgr shows three entries:\nBootCurrent: 0001\nTimeout: 1 seconds\nBootOrder: 0001,0004,0005\nBoot0001* UEFI: ADATA SX900\nBoot0004  Windows Boot Manager\nBoot0005* Gummiboot\n\nNext set BootOrder to Boot0004.\n", "Q: Clementine refuses to play m4a, wma and wav I installed Clementine and I'm happy with it's user interface and certain features.\nUnfortunately, it refuses to play wma, wav and m4a files.\nAs far as I know, I do have all the gstreamer plugins installed and the same files play well in Rythmbox, VLC and gnome-player.\nI was getting gtreamer is missing a plugin error message.

What am I missing here?\nThank you :)\nNote: Softphone1, Softphone2 and SIP-Server are running on KUBUNTU and the DHCP-Server VM is running on UBUNTU.\n\nA: After some more research I found the answer by myself.\nIn VirtualBox, the additional ethernet adapters that are connected to the \"Internal Network\" have to have the same name if they are on the same subnet.\nFor example in my case subnet 20.0.0.0 that includes Softphone1(eth1) and DHCP-Server(eth1) is connected to the \"Internal Network\" neta. In both VMs network settings in VirtualBox the name for the Internal Network has to be the same, so the clients can reach each other. They are now virtually on the same network. Now I am able to ping from the DHCP-Server to the Softphone and vice versa.\nI hope someone can profit from my problem and solution.\n", "Q: Apache unmatched sub domain being caught by a random domain Hi there as the title says for some reason my apache is catching all random sub domains to a specific domain and I can't work out why.\nI have a few sub domains at the moment, bgp.example.com login.example.com www.example.com but if i type random letters: akegmeakgmaekm.example.com it always seems to default back to bgp.example.com even though in my config files I have a 000-default file which serves an error page.\nIf you go to say ekmgakmgkem.google.co.uk it instantly serves a \"this page cannot be found\" error or similar if your isp has set it up that way. \nbgp.example.com is actually a control panel and I don't want just any randomly typed subdomain to end up there and I would like apache to just to 404 or something similar to google.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Apache uses the following process to find the best-matching virtual host:\n\n\n*\n\n*Find a list of virtual hosts that match the IP and port, use wildcard if none are found.  In your case, a wildcard is set in the default virtual host.\n\n*Figure out if we're going to use IP-based or Name-based virtual hosts.  If only one IP and port option matches, IP-based is used and that vhost is selected.\n\n*If IP-based matching could not be used (because there is more than one vhost on that IP and port), get the list of vhost candidates (by IP and port) and try to match the ServerName and ServerAlias directives with the Host HTTP request header.\n\n*If no best match could be found in 3, default to the first vhost found on that IP and port.\n\n*If no IP and port match were found, try to match a wildcard vhost, such as 000-default.\n\n\nBased on your symptoms, I would guess that you are using Name-based virtual hosts, and Apache is never getting down to step 5 because it uses the best IP-based match in step 4.  You should be able to fix this by setting an explicit NameVirtualHost with IP:Port in 000-default and a server name that appears first alphabetically.\nYou can find more details about Apache's vhost selection process here.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu 12.04 have a sounds folder to help set my email notification? Does Ubuntu 12.04 have a stock sounds folder with some sounds I can use to  set my email notification and other kind of notifications?\nI am looking for something centralized, like in /usr/share not a custom one in my own home folder.\n\nA: A lot of sound files are found in /usr/share/sounds . Therefore one can use it to change default system sounds(email notification sounds in this case). One has to remember that sound files in the folder are in .ogg format and therefore the sound files that one is going to set up instead of the default system sounds must also be in .ogg format.\n", "Q: Dual boot with mouse support on OS selection I have dual booted in the past, so I am quite clued up with installation and using Grub2.

The keyboard that I am using is a Genius Imperator. Is there an implementation that will accept mouse input, as in a GUI of sort for OS selection?\n\nA: There is a grubmouse project that lets you partially use your mouse in grub menu. I tried it but couldn't manage to use it. If you want to give it a shot, here is the project:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/byteit101/grub-mouse\nGood luck!\nNote: I don't  accept any responsibility from breakage of your system.

I had the same problem with Samsung printer ML-1670, which stopped working since I installed Ubuntu 14.04 and thought it was a problem specific to this Ubuntu release, but it is not.\nAs you can see here, this is a problem caused by the latest version of the Samsung Universal Linux Driver (ULD) V1.00.21, released on 12 March 2014. \nWhat you have to do is simply download the previous version of the Samsung ULD (V1.00.06 of 6 August 2013) which can be found here, under the section \"Driver\". Don't worry that this is not your exact printer model, as ULD is a package which includes all Samsung printer drivers.

But where is this menu shown ?\nShould  I use a utility to run the 'ubuntu-13.10-desktop-amd64' file instead of extracting using WinRAR?\nWill I then be able to see the 'dash/menu'?\n\nA: It seems like you do not have Ubuntu installed on your machine, you only have the ISO file downloaded to your computer. The dash is a part of Unity, and is only accessible once you install Ubuntu. If you want the flash drive without the mess of having another operating system installed, I suggest you use a VirtualBox guest and create a startup disk that way.\n", "Q: Encrypt file with .asc extension from Nautilus Is it possible to encrypt file with .asc extension directly from Nautilus?\nI tried with Seahorse add on but its always encrypting with gpg extension. \n\nA: You can use Nautilus-Actions Configuration Tool and create an action to do this.\nFind the application in Software Centre \nFrom Gnome Terminal type:\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-actions\nnautilus -q\nnautilus-actions-config-tool\n\n\nThen add you action like this:\n\npath = /usr/bin/pgp\nparameter = --recipient \"\" --armor --encrypt %f\nNow when you right click on file, you'll see this\n\n\nActual Result (even if not GUI, because I don't have nautilus-actions-config-tool installed) : \n\n\nA: You can create a file .asc with GPG on older versions. Now, you'll have to rename the extension. So, create file.pgp, and mv file.pgp file.asc to rename it. \nThat should be it. \nIn here, it's also said that you can do that : \n1) First make sure you don’t have a key already:\ngpg --list-keys\n\n2) If you didn’t and need to create a key then run:\ngpg --gen-key\n\nIt might hang for awhile while generating enough random entropy.

The Ubuntu UI Toolkit provides a default theme, but there is no setting to use a different theme. A different random theme might entirely change how the UI functions, as well as looks, and might not work well on touch based devices.\nHowever, in your app, you can specify some different colors for things. You'll notice for example that the Calendar, Calculator, Music, and other apps do not all have the same colors for everything, but the layout and functionality is generally consistent, and they do look like they all belong on the same system. That is how Ubuntu for phones is designed to be.\nApps are confined, so the user won't be able to change the background color in your app, unless your app specifically provides some way to do it.\n", "Q: sudo update-manager -d non-gui only alternative sudo update-manager -d checks if upgrading to the latest devel release is possible (source: man update-manager).\nBut it opens a visual application (windows, buttons and so on).\nIs there any command alternative that does the same thing but in terminal only (without launching any window)?\n\nA: do-release-upgrade is the command recommended for server updating, I expect it to work for you.\n", "Q: Error while attempt mount /boot/efi I have installed virtualbox on my ubuntu, and I have made a virtual drive for windows, and now every time I boot ubuntu it say:\n        Error while attempt mount /boot/efi\n\nPress s for skiping mounting or m for manualy recovey\nand I tried to mount the /boot/efi in gpart editor but can not, and i also tried reinstalling ubuntu and kubuntu in tty by typing:\n         sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\n         sudo apt-get install --reinstall kubuntu-desktop\n\nand i have tryed enter this sudo blkuuid, and then I know it is a file you have to edit whit gedit, and which one is it grub.cfg, and nothing work can some please help.\n\nA: I just want to share my solution as I just fixed same problem for me.

Upstart? Both? Are they compatible? If not, how do we handle the transition period (which I suppose would take a couple of years.. )\nI'll be glad for advice and best practice about this.\nThanks!\n\nA: In case anyone is wondering here is the blog about the announcement that Ubuntu will follow Debian's discission on changing from upstart to systemd.\n\nThe thing is: if you code something and want a larger user base than Ubuntu users it might already be wise to always include a systemd script. Redhat, SUSE, Gentoo, Arch already (can) use systemd. \nIf Ubuntu is the sole target you could stick with upstart and deal with systemd when the time is there to worry about systemd. That is going to take at least 6 more months so there is plenty of time. \nAnd if you are lucky someone creates a conversion tool to automatically create a systemd script from an upstart script. \n\nBasically: what ever you want do that ;-)\n\nA: It's a hard one to answer because the developers have only just decided on their broad strategic approach to the shift to systemd.\nThis discussion took place at the Ubuntu Developer Summit last month, but I'm afraid I can't find a link to the video debate.\nIt looks like they are going to try to convert the work currently done by upstart into systemd tasks, almost like a wrapper to upstart. But that's just the first step to make sure that users aren't disrupted by the changeover, which is going to be done over quite an extended period of time, bit by bit.\nAs far as I understood the discussion systemd scripts will work normally, and upstart tasks will be made to work with systemd, so perhaps you would be better doing it all as a systemd task from the start.\n\nA: Make your daemon so simple you can write both an upstart job and systemd service in 10 minutes! But yeah, I would say both. If you give me an example of how to start up the swamp daemon, I could write the Upstart job for you.\n", "Q: SublimeText turns into black hole with Unity/nVidia/Xinerama I recently upgraded to 14.04, and after a little bit of fighting, I got my 4-monitor setup \"working\".

I'd like to upgrade my server from non-LTS (Saucy) to the new LTS (Trusty Tahr). \nIn other words, once Ubuntu 14.10 will be out (next scheduled release after 14.04), I would like to remain on the LTS branch and not go to 14.10.\nIs there anything special I should do (or should not do)? \nIs this just a matter of not running sudo apt-get dist-upgrade once 14.10 will be out, or will config files need to be adjusted?\n\nA: Once you upgrade all you need to do is make sure you're being notified of LTS releases only. You can do this by checking the file /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades:\n[DEFAULT]\n# Default prompting behavior, valid options:\n#\n#  never  - Never check for a new release.\n#  normal - Check to see if a new release is available.  If more than one new\n#           release is found, the release upgrader will attempt to upgrade to\n#           the release that immediately succeeds the currently-running\n#           release.\n#  lts    - Check to see if a new LTS release is available.  The upgrader\n#           will attempt to upgrade to the first LTS release available after\n#           the currently-running one.  Note that this option should not be\n#           used if the currently-running release is not itself an LTS\n#           release, since in that case the upgrader won't be able to\n#           determine if a newer release is available.\nPrompt=lts\n\nEnsure Prompt= is set to lts.\nRunning sudo apt-get dist-upgrade will never upgrade you to the newer release unless you manually change your /etc/apt/sources.list or if you do a do-release-upgrade, so you should be good to go. \n", "Q: How do I configure MAAS to control virtual machines with virsh?

I.e. we will sell the application itself and we would use the Ubuntu as a host only without any changes of the OS.\nCan I distribute this virtual machine to our customers without sharing the source codes? \n\nA: This question is too broad to answer easily. Here are a few things complicating it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Some applications included in Ubuntu require you offer source code. Some do not. So this depends specifically on the package list included in the virtual machine itself.\n\n*Some licenses require that all applications that include it's code must be released under the same license. If you use this code in your web application, then your license is already determined for you. For instance, if you use a GPL-licensed code in your application, your application itself would be GPL and you would be required to release your source code.\n\n*Generally speaking, Ubuntu itself contains mechanisms by which to retrieve source code, such as dpkg.

So if you can't answer but have an good article on how does the profiles/sessions work in Unix/Linux/Debian/Ubuntu (if the same) and/or how to make changes to the login/logout events, I'd be happy with that.\nEdit: I made additional tests that further indicate it's a matter of time\n\n\n*\n\n*wmctrl -c firefox; sleep 0.5; sudo shutdown now -r works fine 100%\n\n*wmctrl -c firefox; sleep 0.2; sudo shutdown now -r works fine 50%\n\n*wmctrl -c firefox; sudo shutdown now -r works fine 10%\n\n*sudo shutdown now -r& wmctrl -c firefox never seems to work...\n\n\nSo as a workaround, how can I write wmctrl -c firefox; sleep 0.5 in a file that resembles .profile or bash_logout but for session logout?\n\nA: Apparently there is no dedicated file to write to like there used to be. It was the /etc/gdm/PostSession under Gnome but isn't available since apparently Unity. And placing a script under /etc/rc0.d/ and /etc/rc6.d/ will not work since they are only executed after Xserver is shut down.\nHowever there is an event called gnome-save-yourself fired when gnome has been demanded to log out. I is what gedit for instance will implicitly call. And Seamus Phelan made a python script to listen to the event and run your script when caught.\nHere's the link to the solution : Script Execution at user logout (non root user)\nFollow instructions and then all you have to do is place your script that may look like this: \n#! /bin/sh\n#Requires wmctrl\nwmctrl -c firefox;\ngmusicbrowser -cmd \"Quit\";\nexit 0;\n\nwhere the option -c gently closes Firefox as does -cmd \"Quit\" for gMusicBroswer.\nBoth Firefox and gMusicBrowser need to be closed properly which they do not.\nA probably better way would be to check the use of SIGTERM, SIGKILL and kill timeout in Ubuntu and the programs but I don't know enough about it.\n", "Q: Why use a named pipe instead of a file? I recently read about named pipes, and I couldn't understand why they exist.\nI've read somewhere that using a named pipe is less time-consuming than using a file.\nWhy is this so?\nThe named pipes also have to be stored in memory (and maybe swapped, just like files).\nAs far as I can see, they must get an inode which must be referenced by the current directory, just like files.\nAlso, they must be removed by the programmer, just like files.\nSo where does the advantage lie?\n\nA: Almost everything in Linux can be considered a file, but the main difference between a regular file and a named pipe is that a named pipe is a special instance of a file that has no contents on the filesystem.\nHere is quote from man fifo:\n\nA FIFO special file (a named pipe) is similar to a pipe, except that it is accessed as part of the filesystem. It can be opened by multiple processes for reading or writing. When processes are exchanging data via the FIFO, the kernel passes all data internally without writing it to the filesystem. Thus, the FIFO special file has no contents on the filesystem; the filesystem entry merely serves as a reference point so that processes can access the pipe using a name in the filesystem.\nThe kernel maintains exactly one pipe object for each FIFO special file that is opened by at least one process. The FIFO must be opened on both ends (reading and writing) before data can be passed. Normally, opening the FIFO blocks until the other end is opened also.\n\nSo actually a named pipe does nothing until some process reads and writes to it. It does not take any space on the hard disk (except a little bit of meta information), it does not use the CPU.\nYou can check it by doing this:\nCreate a named pipe\n$ mkfifo /tmp/testpipe\n\nGo to some directory, for example /home/user/Documents, and gzip everything inside it, using named pipe.\n$ cd /home/user/Documents\n$ tar cvf - . | gzip > /tmp/testpipe &\n[1] 28584\n\nHere you should see the PID of the gzip process. In our example it was 28584.\nNow check what this PID is doing\n$ ps u -P 28584\nUSER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND\nc0rp     28584  0.0  0.0  29276  7800 pts/8    S    00:08   0:00 bash\n\nYou will see that it is using no resources. 0% CPU usage, 0% memory usage.\nVerify hunch regarding file space usage\n$ du -h /tmp/testpipe\n0   testpipe\n\nAnd again 0, nothing. The testpipe could be used again if needed.\nDon't forget to kill gzip, using kill -15 28584. And remove our named pipe using rm /tmp/testpipe\nExample Usages\nYou can redirect almost everything using named pipe. As example you can see this one line proxy.\nAlso here is one more nice explanation of named pipe usage. You can configure two processes on one server to communicate using a named pipe instead of TCP/IP stack. It is much faster, and does not load network resources. For example your Web Server can communicate with the database directly using a named pipe, instead of using localhost address or listening to some port.\n\nA: It is true that you won't use system memory but the fact you don't use cpu in your example is only because you don't read the pipe so the process is waiting.\nConsider following example:\nmkfifo /tmp/testpipe\ntar cvf - / | gzip > /tmp/testpipe\n\nNow open a new console and run:\nwatch -n 1 'ps u -P $(pidof tar)\n\nAnd in a third console:\ncat /tmp/testpipe > /dev/null\n\nIf you look at the watch cmd (2nd term) it will show an increase in cpu consumption !\n\nA: Here is a use case where named pipes can save you a lot of time by removing I/O.\nLet's suppose you have a BigFile, for example 10G.\nYou also have splits of this BigFile in pieces of 1G, BigFileSplit_01 to BigFile_Split_10.\nNow you have a doubt on the correctness of BigFileSplit_05\nNaively, without named pipes, you would create a new split from BigFile and compare:\ndd if=BigFile of=BigFileSplitOrig_05 bs=1G skip=4 count=1\ndiff -s BigFileSplitOrig_05 BigFileSplit_05\nrm BigFileSplitOrig_05\n\nWith named pipes you would do\nmkfifo BigFileSplitOrig_05\ndd if=BigFile of=BigFileSplitOrig_05 bs=1G skip=4 count=1 &\ndiff -s BigFileSplitOrig_05 BigFileSplit_05\nrm BigFileSplitOrig_05\n\nThat may not seem at first sight a big difference... but in time the difference is huge!\nOption 1:\n\n\n*\n\n*dd: read 1G / write 1G  (1)\n\n*diff: read 2G\n\n*rm: free allocated clusters / remove directory entry\n\n\nOption 2:\n\n\n*\n\n*dd: nothing! (goes to named pipe)\n\n*diff: read 2G\n\n*rm: no allocated cluster to manage (we didn't actually write anything to the filesystem) / remove directory entry\n\n\nSo basically the named pipe saves you here a read and write of 1G plus some filesystem cleaning (since we wrote nothing to the filesystem but the empty fifo node).\nNot doing I/O, especially writes, is also good to avoid the wear of your disks. It is even more interesting when you work with SSDs since they have a limited number of writes before cells die.\n(1) Obviously, another option would be to create that temporary file to RAM, for example if /tmp is mounted to RAM (tmpfs). Nevertheless you would be limited by the size of the RAM disk, whereas the \"named pipe trick\" has no limits.\n\nA: You can let a program lie still and listen to a named pipe for some outside event. As soon as the outside event occurs (f.ex. arrival of some new data)\nthis could be detected by some other program which in turn opens the pipe for write, writing the relevant event data to the pipe. When the close statement is issued, the listening program will receive the stream of data through the pipe via a read statement, and is ready to process what it has got. Don't forget tor close the pipe after reading the content. \nThe listening program could also return results of its processing via the same, or via another named pipe. Such inter-program communications is very\nconvenient at times.\n", "Q: I had 2G of RAM and I upgraded to 6G and it only sees 3G I did some searching, and I have a processor that supports pae.

For instance, if your file is 4byte integers, you'd use od --format=dI.  \nIt depends on what type of variables the \"up to 12 parameters\" are, and how much space (how many bytes) they take up in the file, and the \"endian-ness\" of the data (is a 4 byte integer stored as 4321 or 1234 in the file?).\nIf the file is too complex for od, you could look at Perl's unpack function, with perldoc -f unpack, or the Python struct module.\nThe real way to understand the format is to look at the program that created the file, or the documentation, or ...., track down the programmer and inquire.\nThanks to @steeldriver\n", "Q: How do I install Foldit.tar.gz (specifically)? NOTE: THIS IS NOT A DUPLICATE QUESTION. It is specific to Foldit.tar.gz and installing this game is done uniquely. There is an askubuntu page answering the question, \"How do I install a .tar.gz (or .tar.bz2) file?\", but those instructions are for that generic file type. They don't work with this particular game, and in this explanation I've resolved that.  Also, I'm an absolute beginner, running Ubuntu 13.01 for only about 2 months now. I'm only barely familiar with the console at this point. Please bear with me. However, what I offer is the simplest and most concise solution to this problem you will find (out of the first 50 or so google results that come up).\n1- From your Downloads folder right click the downloaded file \"Foldit.tar.gz\" and select the option to extract it into any folder you choose. I picked /Public/Foldit in my home folder.  \n2- The next step is easiest done from the console. Type in \nsudo apt-get install xclip\nwhich enables you to cut and paste within the game. (It should run without this feature, if you don't want it.) Then type this in to start it \nsudo xclip  \n3- Next type in sudo apt-get install libglut3 which is a prerequisite not mentioned on the fold.it site nor in the readme file. (I asked them to change that, but who knows.) If that command didn't work, like it didn't for me, then go to this page to download the libglut3 package, ubuntu packages, which I was then able to install via the software center. There, you should be all set.  \n4- Before you try to start the game, make sure you're on-line so it can download all the updates and puzzles. The readme file says, \"To start the game, run Foldit from this directory.\" So go into the folder where you put the original download extracted, and double click Foldit. If it doesn't work completely for any reason (like it didn't for me), restart ubuntu, and try this step again. For me, Foldit wouldn't load up some of the puzzles, but on my 3rd try, it worked perfectly and has ever since.\nDon't you love it when you wind up answering your own question? Thank you to everyone that showed and interest and/or helped me. \n\nA: thank you,\nlibglut3 doesn't exist (anymore?), install freeglut3 instead... and it worked for me!\n", "Q: Can't close all programs and continue the upgrade I have decided to upgrade to ubuntu 14.04 today as it is supposed to be the 1st official release date.

My machine was disconnected for a couple of weeks. Am now connected, and Update Manager has 23 updates waiting. But I get a warning \"The action would require the installation of packages from not authenticated sources.\" \nI've tried several, single updates, and so far all have this warning. E.g., for just the SSL development libraries, header files and documentation, the \"Details\" panel shows: \nlibssl-dev\nI see that a very similar question at my update manager say \"Requires installation of untrusted packages\" was answered in terms of terminal commands. \nWhat is happening here? If I go the command-line route, must I abandon the Update Manager permanently?\n\nA: \nThe action would require the installation of packages from not authenticated sources\n\nThat could mean you have missing authentication keys. To check, open system settings - Software & Updates. Then go to Other Software tab. Uncheck any sources you don't use. Then you need to make sure you have a key (Authentication tab) for each for each source. If you are missing any keys, that is probably the source of the error. You would then go to the corresponding PPA website, click the verification signature, click it again, save the page as a text document. Then go back to the Authentication tab and import it. \nAfter those steps, close Software & Updates and launch Software Update again.\n\nIf I go the command-line route, must I abandon the Update Manager permanently?\n\nNo, it will still be available. The Software Updater gui will automatically refresh if you modify any sources or applications.\n", "Q: Disabling animations to speed up a system My laptop is quite old and slow.

I became unhappy with it and so I un-installed it. \nTo un-install it I re-logged in to the unity workspace stuff and removed all the KDE packages. \nWhen I restarted my PC the ubuntu loading screen would show and then the screen would go blank, since I assumed that this means that the computer is not hung up and working I pressed  Alt-Shift-F5 to open the shell. I couldn't find a way to make the greeter show up. I checked whether or not it was installed, and it was installed. \nSince I couldn't find a solution to it I loaded the LiveUSB and reinstalled Ubuntu. But this time I couldn't use the already set up account (abc) again when it asked me to make an account, so I made a new account abc_new\nAfter installation the login screen came up just fine but I was expecting account abc to be part of the list of logginable accounts. But its not there. \nI want to know how to make it show up so that I don't have to reinstall all the other software I had installed already?\n\nA: If your reinstall of Ubuntu from the LiveUSB included a format of your hard drive, and if you don't have a backup stored somewhere other than the hard disk you reinstalled to, your old account and software are gone. If that is the case, you will need to create a new account and reinstall your software. You can read your /etc/passwd file to see if your old account is listed. If the account name is not in the passwd file, then the account doesn't exist in your newly installed Ubuntu.\n$ cat /etc/passwd\nor \n$ less /etc/passwd\n", "Q: Do I need to enable TRIM if I have a non-Intel/Samsung I read in one of the webupd8 articles that TRIM support, which was introduced in Ubuntu 14.04, by default only works for Intel and Samsung SSDs. What about other? I am using Dell XPS 13 Dev Edition laptop and the SSD is from a different manufacturer, so does TRIM work by default as well or I have to manually make a cron job file?\n\nA: Everything is already installed.\nThe command to activate trim 1 time:\nsudo fstrim -v /\n\nIt will take a while and then show the results. Example:\nsudo fstrim -v /\n[sudo] password for rinzwind: \n/: 93184647168 bytes were trimmed\n\nAnd it is set up by default to run once a week for -supported devices-:\n$ locate fstrim\n/etc/cron.weekly/fstrim\n/sbin/fstrim\n\nIf you check the cron job it is all explained:\n$ more /etc/cron.weekly/fstrim \n#!/bin/sh\n# call fstrim-all to trim all mounted file systems which support it\nset -e\n\n# This only runs on Intel and Samsung SSDs by default, as some SSDs with faulty\n# firmware may encounter data loss problems when running fstrim under high I/O\n# load (e. g.  https://launchpad.net/bugs/1259829). You can append the\n# --no-model-check option here to disable the vendor check and run fstrim on\n# all SSD drives.\nexec fstrim-all\n\nIf the manual method works, you can add --no-model-check to the command at the end (exec fstrim-all) for it to activate.\n\nThe link in the file is an interesting read. It also has a method to check if your disc is bugged. A lot of the cheaper SSDs are faulty and could destroy data. \n\nAnd to top it off: this is a list of compatible hardware (PDF download) including SSDs.\n\nThere is another method where you add discard to your fstab for permanent trimming. Benchmarks (German) favor fstrim over discard.\n\nA: You can also force the TRIM (on filesystem like ext4/xfs) adding discard to the options of /etc/fstab entry. For example mine is:\n/dev/sda3   /  ext4    errors=remount-ro,discard  0       1\n\nIf you use cryptsetup (for dmcrypt) you can also add discard in /etc/crypttab to force TRIM.

If you don't have any recovery discs you can create them within Windows just do a search [Windows + S] at the desktop for recovery disc.  You will need 3 blank DVDs FYI.

With the new LTS 14.04 (beta 2) I found the alternate installer missing which complicates installation on a RAID1 a lot. Textbased installation doesn't work because it fails to autmatically setup Wifi.\nMy question is: How do you install Ubuntu Desktop on a software RAID 1 with encryption?\nHere's what I tried:\nIdea 1. Install on first hard disk and create RAID afterwards\nDidn't work because \"Disks\" warns about erasing everything.\nIdea 2.

What should I do?\n\nA: From here: \nhttp://ewen.mcneill.gen.nz/blog/entry/2014-07-17-mininet-on-ubuntu-14.04-in-kvm/\n\"WRITE SAME failed. Manually zeroing\"\nIf you get reports of \"WRITE SAME failed. Manually zeroing\" logged to the console, they seem to be caused by this patch to the SCSI disk driver in Linux 3.7+ (and a later patch which enabled WRITE SAME via the disk mapper path from Linux 3.10 onwards), which enables use of the SCSI \"WRITE SAME\" command (write multiple blocks with the same content -- Linux seems to use it mostly for ensuring blocks contain all zeros).\nThe patch defaults to using 0xFFFF (65535) blocks for WRITE SAME, except for certain classes of disks (ATA, USB, and Firewire) which are known not to implement the feature (and will use more if SCSI READ SUPPORTED OPERATION CODES reports more). It appears that particularly for certain virtualised disks (eg, KVM, perhaps only older KVM installs -- my host machine still runs Ubuntu 10.04 LTS), this results in assuming WRITE SAME functionality will work even if it is not supported. (Various people have found this problem, in various kernels; it looks like there is a patch to disable it if it fails)\nThe work around where it is being inappropriately used is to manually set max_write_same_blocks to 0 for the underlying SCSI devices in the /sys file system -- this needs to be done each boot. The affected SCSI devices can be found with:\nfind /sys/devices -name max_write_same_blocks\nand something needs to write 0 into the file; on machines with systemd people are using /etc/tmpfiles.d to do that. For Ubuntu 14.04 it looks like the simplest solution is to create a simple script called \"disable-write-same\", (in /usr/local/sbin), that finds all the max_write_same_blocks files, and echos 0 into them -- then add a call to that to /etc/rc.local. (For good measure run the script immediately, to avoid rebooting.)\nETA, 2014-07-31: I also found I needed to do the same thing when installing under VMWare Fusion.\n\nA: Whatever happend, the only consequence was the promised graphical interface didn't come up. I started it manually and that was about all.\nSo actually there was no problem, just a confusion. Maybe it helps someone.\nI guess, this problem was related to using \"easy install\", which I'll avoid in the future.\n\nA: I had the same problem and the solution was to download the VMware Tools during the installation as suggested through a pop-up dialogue which appears shortly after starting the Easy Install (it even mentioned that VMware Easy Install will fail when not doing this).\n", "Q: Browsing is painfully slow Either it's Firefox or Chromium - browsing is painfully slow for some reason. It just takes lots of time to do anything: open a tab, load a website, etc. My internet is really fast and other programs run fast, but the browsing is really too slow. What can I do?\nbtw, I ran htop, it shows that these 2 browsing programs take lots of CPU, sometimes over 100%.\nAlso, the same thing happens in Xubuntu and Ubuntu.\nI have 3GB RAM. And previously it worked much better.\n\nA: Have you cleared your browser cache(s)? For Firefox, there are instructions on the Mozilla website. For Chrome, you can find instructions on Google's chrome page.\nTry that, then either log out and in, or reboot, and see if it helps. If it does help, then you might want to reduce the limit of your browser cache size. In Firefox, you type \"about:config\" in the address bar, and then set the value of \"browser.cache.disk.capacity\" to the smaller value you want to try. \n\nA: A good way to diagnose what might be happening is to temporarily create a new user, log in as the new user and run the browser. If you don't experience any performance issues, you know it's a (user) local issue related, for instance, to misconfiguration or corrupt/invalid cache.\n", "Q: Running Apache as FTP users I have an Ubuntu server. Apache, MySQL and VsFTPd are running on it and it hosts more than one web sites. Every web site owner has an FTP user to upload files. However, Apache is running as www-data, as default. Thus, the files uploaded using Wordpress and cache files created by caching plugins of Wordpress are owned by www-data. In order to upload files one must make his folder's permission 777, which is not safe.\nShould I make Apache run as separate users for each customer?\n\nA: IMO you are best off using one of two options. First would be some sort of virtualization, for example lxc , openvz, or KVM. This option gives the most separation.\nYour second, and perhaps better option, is to use a feature called \"home directories\". \nsudo a2enmod userdir\n\nRestart apache2 daemon with following command\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nCeate folder “public_html” in the home directories, then set permission public_html folder to 0755\nmkdir ~/public_html && chmod 0755 ~/public_html\n\nConfigure your vitrual hosts to use /home/user_name/public_html as the web root.\nSee:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP#Virtual_Hosts\nhttp://kimbriggs.com/computers/computer-notes/linux-notes/apache2-public_html-virtual-directories.file\nhttp://joao.machado-family.com/2013/06/04/ubuntu-13-04-apache2-setup-public_html/\n", "Q: How to get/enable the new locally integrated menus (LIM) inside of the windows titlebar?

You can then sort out things like large, irrelevant dirs or subdirs: ~/.thumbnails, ~/.mozilla/firefox/*/CACHE ... - There is certainly more config data elsewhere; but not much more.\n\nA: as I can't comment, I'll try and address what seems to be the problem.\ndid you C^c anything on the install? as it seems that one of the updates crashed unexpectedly. (could not get lock).\nThe course of action I would recommend would be to first check that no update managers, or rogue threads are trying to update your system. ps -e | grep apt. kill anything that comes up.\nSecond, you'll need to delete the lock file for aptitude removing the lock file should solve this rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock.\nAfter this, try running apt-get update && apt-get upgrade. This should hopefully get you back to were you were.\nEDIT\nIt seems that the first error you're coming across is related to the package manager. Broken Software Index Repair. Try going through that and see if it unlocks, and resets your application database.\n\nA: Try this solution that was originally posted by \"Bruno Pereira\"\n\nRemove your /var/lib/dpkg/lock file and force package\n  reconfiguration.\nsudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nIt should work after this.\n\n", "Q: Apache2 cannot find sites after update after I updated my server 1 hour ago to 14.04 LTS I can't find/load the sites hosted on that server.\nI use apache2 and haven't really configured anything else than 2 enabled sites on it.

If you already have Ubuntu installed on a standard LVM-on-LUKS, this is as easy as:\nsudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda4 sda4_crypt\n\nor whichever partition is the encrypted LVM PV. This should automatically create the LVM LVs in /dev/mapper/.\nStart ubiquity with manual partitioning, and use the existing partitions; keep /home etc. as they are, and reformat the root partition in the LVM.

They 'would not' help me fix this, after I paid $59.99 for their product (which I purchased to run disc software for school). CrossOver is a joke and their tech support is laughable.

After running\nsudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev\non ubuntu 14.04 amd64 desktop (Trusty Tahr), I found that all the libs are installed into\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/\ninstead of\n/usr/lib/\nAlthough all the headers are still installed into\n/usr/include/\nWhy does this happen?\n\nA: The library packages have been made multiarch, meaning that you can simultaneously install both the amd64 version and the i386 version on an amd64 computer. If you want to install the i386 version of a library, suffix the package name with :i386. (For example, sudo apt-get install libboost-system1.54.0:i386)\nLibrary packages are shifting towards becoming multiarch, so that it is a little easier to install packages from other architectures and run programs compiled for other architectures.\n\nA: This is by spec. The headers are still an unresolved issue in the spec. and considered out of scope as noted in the source under the heading of Unresolved Issues\n\"Design\nFilesystem layout\nIn order to seamlessly accommodate more than one ELF ABI on a system, the library for each (soname,ABI) pair must have a unique path on the filesystem. The FHS attempts to address this for the amd64 case by requiring that /usr/lib be reserved for 32-bit libraries, with 64-bit libraries located in /usr/lib64. This design has a number of shortcomings:\nThis is not forwards-compatible with any future ABI changes, which would require further design work and further modification of packages to handle the addition of new paths. (Indeed, this is already a concern for the MIPS architecture which has three distinct ABIs in use in parallel.)\nThe amd64 architecture must be special-cased in the library packaging, as the only architecture that uses /usr/lib64 instead of /usr/lib. (Two pre-existing 64-bit Linux ports, Alpha and IA-64, also used /usr/lib for their 64-bit libs.) This is unnecessary added complexity.\nIt does not address emulation use cases, such as qemu, which could integrate much better and more efficiently with the system if the packages for a qemu arch were co-installable. \nThe current design used by Debian and Ubuntu also fails on a key point where the FHS layout does not:\nThe path for x86 and x86-64 libraries varies depending on whether the system is natively 32-bit or 64-bit, so translating paths at install time is insufficient for the general case because some libraries need to embed plugin paths in the binaries themselves. \nMultiarch seeks to address all of these issues, at the expense of a one-time transition, by migrating libraries to subdirectories that include the architecture triplet as part of the path:\n/lib/i386-linux-gnu\n   /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\n   /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu\n   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\"\nsource\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 get Windows 8 to show up I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on what used to be Ubuntu 12.04.

Here a list of all important discussions I've found so far.\n\n\n*\n\n*https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/chromium-browser/+bug/1307648\n\n*http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=363921\n\n*http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=360388\nEDIT:\nJust as an info I just tried installing chrome (not chromium) and the keyboard issue seems to be resolved (https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/).\n\nA: Firstly i was turning off ibus but next i found permanent solution on lubuntu 14.04:\npreferences->languages and there turn input method from IBUS to none, and that did the trick.\n\nA: I think this is a conflict with IBus, in Lubuntu in your indicator applets, right click the IBus applet and quit it, then KB input in chromium should work.\n", "Q: (Ubuntu 14.04) High Quality .OGV conversion to either .AVI or .MP4 Unfortunately, none of the solutions found on this post helped:\nRELATED: Video converter: ogv to avi (or another more common format)\nI have a High Quality animation (specifically, from Diablo 3) on .ogv format and I need to be able to convert it to a more common format which can be used on video editing tools, more specifically, Cinelerra which just closes on attempts to open .ogv files, returning as error:\n\nAborted (core dumped)\n\nMy idea is to simply swap the format without losing quality. In order to do so, I used avprobe to check the video's information in an attempt to copy it's configurations over to my encoding. The output from avprobe is as follows:\nInput #0, ogg, from 'Cinematic_1_Intro.ogv':\n  Duration: 00:02:42.79, start: 0.000000, bitrate: 4489 kb/s\n    Stream #0.0: Data: skeleton\n    Stream #0.1: Video: theora, yuv420p, 1280x544, 14 fps, 24 tbn, 24 tbc\n    Metadata:\n      ENCODER         : ffmpeg2theora-0.28\n    Stream #0.2: Audio: vorbis, 44100 Hz, 5.1, fltp, 192 kb/s\n    Metadata:\n      ENCODER         : ffmpeg2theora-0.28\n      SOURCE_OSHASH   : f29728676ce32de9\nUnsupported codec with id 0 for input stream 0\n\nFor conversion, I'm using avconv with the following parameters:\navconv -i Cinematic_1_Intro.ogv -c:v libx264 -acodec libmp3lame -vol 360 Cinematic_1_Intro.mp4 -r 14 -crf 0 -b 4489k -s 1280x544\n\nI've also tried swapping the framerate to 24, same results. Here is a screenshot of both videos:\nhttp://postimg.org/image/63sxjp3tf/full/\nNote that the image is from a dual-monitor setup with both on 1920x1024, so it may take a while to render.\nOn the right we have the original video and, on the left, the converted one. As you can see, the quality is horrible and the colors are all wrong.\nSo, what else can I do? I've tried every single thing I could find on the internet and I simply cannot convert this and maintain the quality. I've even tried ffmpeg and mencoder with all the suggested parameters on the related post, but I also couldn't get it converted with enough quality.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I suspect that if you really want to import your video into another application for editing you would be better to use a lossless video format such as HuffYUV or FFV1 or even lossless h.264 using -qp 0 rather than -crf 0 as you have done. Depends which Cinelerra likes the most.\nFor lossless h.264 try the following and see if it is any better than your own results:\navconv -i Cinematic_1_Intro.ogv \\\n       -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -qp 0 -vf scale=\"1280:trunc(ow/a/2)*2\" \\\n       -c:a libmp3lame -qscale:a 3 -af 'volume=1.5' -ac 2 \\\n       Cinematic_1_Intro.mp4\n\nA lot of this syntax comes from the current FFmpeg and I have not tested on an older avconv, in particular the scaling and volume changes where I have attempted to reproduce some of your settings...\n", "Q: What does 'without password' mean in sshd_config file? I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my server and I was setting up all my config files when I came across this in my sshd_config file:\n# Authentication:\nLoginGraceTime 120\nPermitRootLogin without-password\nStrictModes yes\n\nThis made me very worried. I thought that it was possible that someone could be logging into my server as root without a password.\nI tried connecting to my server as root via:\njohns-mbp:~ john$ ssh root@192.168.1.48\nThe authenticity of host '192.168.1.48 (192.168.1.48)' can't be established.\nRSA key fingerprint is 40:7e:28:f1:a8:36:28:da:eb:6f:d2:d0:3f:4b:4b:fe.\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes\nWarning: Permanently added '192.168.1.48' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.\nroot@192.168.1.48's password:  \n\nI entered a blank password and it didn't let me in, which was a relief. So my question is: what does without password mean and why is this a default in Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: In newer versions of sshd (OpenSSH 7.0 and above, released on 2015-08-11) \"without-password\" has been changed to  \"prohibit-password\".\nBoth version work, probably best to use \"prohibit-password\" if you can: it explains itself better.\nSource:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*sshd_config(5): PermitRootLogin now accepts an argument of 'prohibit-password' as a less-ambiguous synonym of 'without-password'.\n  \n\n\nA: Note that there are legitimate reasons for logging in via root (but using cryptographic keys and never a password). A typical example is remotely syncing two servers (to have one of them being used as fail-over). Because the structure must be identical, often a root password is required.\nHere is an example using unison for the synchronisation.\n\nA: Actually this setting does pretty much nothing if you are using PAM authentication. At the bottom of the sshd_config configuration file you will find:\n# Set this to 'yes' to enable PAM authentication, account processing,\n# and session processing. If this is enabled, PAM authentication will\n# be allowed through the ChallengeResponseAuthentication and\n# PasswordAuthentication.  Depending on your PAM configuration,\n# PAM authentication via ChallengeResponseAuthentication may bypass\n# the setting of \"PermitRootLogin without-password\".\n# If you just want the PAM account and session checks to run without\n# PAM authentication, then enable this but set PasswordAuthentication\n# and ChallengeResponseAuthentication to 'no'.\n\nThe default setting on Ubuntu is to use PAM authentication:\nUsePAM yes\n\n\nA: From the man page:\n\nPermitRootLogin\nSpecifies whether root can log in using ssh(1).  The argument must be “yes”, “without-password”, “forced-commands-only”, or \"no”.  The default is “yes”.\nIf this option is set to prohibit-password (or its deprecated alias, without-password), password and keyboard-interactive authentication are disabled for root.\n\n\nIf this option is set to “forced-commands-only”, root login with public key authentication will be allowed, but only if the command option has been specified (which may be useful for taking remote backups even if root login is normally not allowed).  All other authentication methods are disabled for root.\nIf this option is set to “no”, root is not allowed to log in.\n\nThus, prohibit-password allows root login only with public key authentication. This is often used with shell scripts and automated tasks.\n", "Q: Why do Ubuntu & Lubuntu 14.04 have different support periods? This doesn't make sense. I rather have LXDE as my desktop so I use Lubuntu.  But why is Ubuntu 14.04's LTS support period 5 years when Lubuntu 14.04's is only 3 years?  Do they not use the same repositories and therefore get all the same security updates?  This just doesn't add up!\n\nA: Ubuntu Flavors such as Lubuntu are build by volunteers and as such supporting releases for users is dependent on the amount of volunteers available. \nBeing relatively new (2001), Lubuntu did not have an LTS release at all for 12.04. This time around Lubuntu feels like they can support their users for 3 years. \nYou're right that they use the same repositories, but support will depend on the package. So if you use say, Firefox, then you're probably good as that package is widely used and support is shared with plain Ubuntu. \nAs with all open projects one of the best ways to help is to volunteer!\n", "Q: Install something without make install I have been struggling for few days trying to install a software. I'm not actually working on Ubuntu but I think the steps to do are the same. Working on a gentoo (The operating system of the Robot NAO) distribution with no gcc and no make installed and no easy way to install them by myself. I want to install portaudio and the pyaudio library for python. All I have is a virtual machine emulating the robot where gcc and make are available. ./configure and make work well on the virtual machine. Then I copy the folder with the generated binaries to the robot but can't run make install due to the missing make. I was able to manually install pyaudio by putting the .py in the right location but portaudio (pyaudio depends on it) is more tricky. Now, whenever I try \"import pyaudio\" I have an error message asking for installing portaudio first. I tried to open the makefile and follow what the install section is doing with no success. I also searched for all files called portaudio after installing portaudio on the virtual machine and copied them one to one to the robot. Still getting an error when importing pyaudio. Does somebody know how to do an install manually?\n\nA: You can usually do this by passing --prefix=/path/to/empty/folder to configure.  This will put the installed components into your previously-empty folder in the correct structure once you run make install.  Then, you can copy all the contents of this folder onto your target system.\n", "Q: 14.04 Udisks2 Not Auto-Mounting External Drives I've upgraded from 13.10 to 14.04 via command-line when my system froze, had to do REISUB and dpkg --configure -a to recover from crash after rebooting.\nNow everything seems to work except automatically mounting external thumb drives and external hard disk drives.

The only way around it that I found was following a tutorial that had me boot into the Live USB, install an application that did a guided repair of the MRB - it looks to have installed that on my backup drive (/dev/sda - WD 350Gb HD).\nI've installed the 14.04 Release today on /dev/sdb, but to boot it, I need to boot /dev/sda which has the MBR (ie. /dev/sda needs to be first in the BIOS boot order).

Now I am trying to install WINE but I get the message:\nnvidia-libopencl1-331 has to be removed before installing WINE (translated from Dutch). Is this a bug? Or should I proceed removing this package?\n\nA: I received the same message after updating to 14.04 as well, and I'm just as curious to know why the nvidia-331 update package must be removed for WINE to work. In my case, this is not even an option, as it would break my current setup with switchable graphics. Hopefully, more information regarding this will emerge sooner or later.\nFor now, however, there are some workarounds.\nIt seems that only WINE 1.6 asks for removing the \"nvidia-libopencl1-331\" package. WINE 1.7.16, on the other hand, installs just fine, without the need for removal.\nThough, if needed, it is possible to get WINE 1.6 working using PlayOnLinux. This without having to remove the mentioned package as well.\nFor now, this should hopefully be enough to get the desired Windows applications to run.\n\nA: The problem here is two packages are installing the same binary file '/usr/lib/*/libOpenCL.so' without declaring a breaks/replaces or conflicts relationship between them, and so apt-get does not know to remove the other.\nThis either needs to be fixed in nvidia-cuda-toolkit or ocl-icd.\nocl-icd is shipping this file in ocl-icd-libopencl1 instead of ocl-icd-opencl-dev, which is against Debian policy, see https://bugs.debian.org/679228\nnvidia-cuda-toolkit lists 'nvidia-opencl-dev (= 5.5.22-3ubuntu2~ppa1) | opencl-dev' among its dependencies, so as a workaround, we can help apt-get by installing ocl-icd-opencl-dev to provide opencl-dev, but we need to do it in the correct order:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit #Need to get 250 MB of archives; 774 MB of additional disk space will be used\nsudo apt-get install ocl-icd-opencl-dev #this will remove nvidia-libopencl1-* and nvidia-opencl-dev\nsudo apt-get install wine #Need to get 121 MB; 342 MB of additional disk space will be used.\n\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ocl-icd/+bug/1247736/comments/7\nhttps://www.kubuntuforums.net/showthread.php?65230-WINE-after-Internet-Upgrade-Path&p=349746\n\nA: I just installed upstream Wine and upstream nVidia in 14.04 from these two PPAs and they didn't appear to conflict, which is a good sign:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-wine/+archive/ubuntu/ppa\nhttps://launchpad.net/~mamarley/+archive/ubuntu/nvidia\n\nA: First time I tried this, Google Earth repeatedly crashed on trying to run it.  Google Earth requires very advanced video card features, like OpenGL, rendering, shaders, Directx9 capability, all of that.  This is how I ended up with a Nvidia graphics card.\nSo I reinstalled nvidia-340 (331 is no longer the current version, though it is the current version that installs from the driver manager in Mint), then ran the entire fix above.  Somehow the other net result of the above is taht Wine was effectively not installed at all, and I hadn't followed the step of reinstalling Wine.   \nNow Google Earth works.   \nAll is not perfect, however.  Tour guide pictures won't open in Google Earth.  They also won't open when I reverted to teh system graphics driver.  I cannot say if they opened before I installed Google Earth, since I hadn't tried it. (with the Intel onboard controller Google Earth wouldn't even start). However the discussion above suggests that if reverting to the system driver didn't solve the issue than I think that probably installing Wine didn't cause it.   \n", "Q: Steam is extremely slow to load the first game It takes almost 4 minutes to start a game (Dota2) and another 3 to start a match after accepting a match. this always happens only on my first match.

I would log into Ubuntu and the mouse would disappear, right click wouldn't do anything, and all of the other remedies that I saw posted didn't have any effect.\nWhat worked for me: \nI did a clean install Ubuntu 14.04 32-bit edition instead of the recommended 64-bit version. It works great now!  \nAnother user mentioned that a bit more background on this may be helpful. Here goes, a post under the question: 'what-are-the-differences-between-32-bit-and-64-bit-and-which-should-i-choose' talks about some key differences 32 bit and 64 bit and an obvious one is compatibility... 32 bit is generally more compatible with everything. \n\nThe practical problem: not everyone has a AMD64 compatible CPU.\n  Promoting 64-bit over the standard i686 version would lead to more\n  user frustration. Therefore for the next few years, it's less\n  confusing to present the 32-bit version to the average user. It's not\n  exactly a problem for anyone in the know, since the 64-bit version is\n  readily available. And we amd64 users don't have any disadvantage from\n  that situation, except for the initial download. All packages are\n  available in both architectures.\n\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/7084/284653\nNot saying for sure that the mouse pointer disappearing was due to an architecture issue but it does seem to fit for this instance.

Will I have to download the whole package from the beginning? As I was a windows user, I saw that this is not the case with windows. It keeps downloading files and when downloading is complete it asks the user to install them.\n\nA: From what I know the update process is as folows:\n\n\n*\n\n*The update manager downloads all the files\n\n*The update manager applies all the changes and installs all the files\n\n\nIn other words, if your connection is interrupted, nothing will change to your system because the first step is not finished. Step two is executed if and only if step 1 was successful.\nThis is the upgrade manager you'll see. Note how first the new channels are fetched, then the new pacakges, only then to proceed to install them.\n\nJust before the actual fetching of the packages starts, you will get the following dialogue box which confirms my answer:\n\nNote: You should not be worried so much about your connection, but about making sure your power source stays alive. If you switch off your computer or your power source whilst the update is ongoing, then your system will be messed up.\nAlso as a general note: always keep two external backups of all your files before you upgrade and do not upgrade a production system without having a large amount of time and knowledge about what to do if something in the upgrade did not go as expected.\nFor the rest, welcome to 14.04.\n\nA: About the downloaded files, they will be saved when the connection lost. You can redo the upgrade and this time it will resume the downloading.

Installing mtp-tools package will solve this error and makes your mtp device to get connected.\nsudo apt-get install mtp-tools\n\n\nA: Resolved this issue by upgrading to Android 4.4. Now, when I plug in the device, I get an \"Android\" device in Nautilus, which has two separate drives available, my internal and external SD card. There are no interface actions on the phone needed to connect the device. I actually can't tell if it's connecting using MTP or USB mass storage or what, but so long as it's working, I'm not too concerned about it.\nMedia files don't have preview icons, but can be opened and viewed without any errors.\n\nA: On my galaxy s3 (android 4.4), I changed my settings from Media Device (MTP) to Camera (PTP) and I was able to view my Pictures and others files just fine. \n\nA: You'll be happy to know the previous set of USB utilities is still there to use. This is a work around rather than a permanent fix. RC\n\n\n*\n\n*On your android phone, go to Application->Settings\n\n*In there, go to Wireless and Network and select USB Utilities\n\n*Click on Connect Storage to PC, before you connect a USB cable\n\n*A message should pop up: Connect USB cable to use mass storage\n\n*Now connect the USB cable to computer\n\n*The green android robot should be displayed with an option button for \"Connect USB storage;\" click on that.\n\n*The green robot turns orange and now you can access the files on the internal storage and SD card of your phone.\n\n\nsource: http://catlingmindswipe.blogspot.com/2012/05/how-to-connect-android-samsung-galaxy.html\nMy tests indicate that installing PCManFM from Software Center will also allow you to access your files on the device in the way it worked in years gone by.\n\nA: This may work with 4.1.2 as well.... cannot confirm\nStorage [Tip] Re-enabling Mass Storage Mode Android 4.2.2\nJust wanted to share some tips to those who wanted to re-enable the Mass Storage Mode on their Android 4.2.2\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect your phone to a computer (The device will be connected in MTP mode as default)\n\n*Reboot your phone while connected to the computer\n\n*Wait until you see the USB icon on your Notification Bar\n\n*You will now have an option to select Mass Storage henceforth\n\n\nsource: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2350542\n\nA: I have got a Galaxy S6, and I saw the same issue in Ubuntu 15.10 when accessing the files on the device (Failed to open input stream for image).\nHowever, I was able to copy the files to my laptop and viewing them there, without altering any settings on phone/computer.\n\nA: Having run into this problem many times, my feeling is, that it appears to happen more often with Samsung phones than with Huawei phones. I have not tested with others.\nThe problem is by my analysis, that Samsung allows exactly one MTP session after an USB cable has been connected and the user authorized file transfer. However, Ubuntu (and Kubuntu as well) apparently close and re-open the MTP session after already a few seconds of inactivity, or they try to use parallel MTP sessions (like one for directory listings and one for actual file transfer etc.). But the new MTP session is not authorized and boom, there is the error message, and the Samsung phone will even close the already authorized MTP session.\nThe best workaround is to use mtp-tools to permanently mount the android device. For reference see basically: https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/MTP/\nSo I typed in a terminal window:\nsudo apt-get install mtp-tools\nsudo apt-get install jmtpfs\nmkdir ~/samsung\n\n(This needs only to be done once. On older Ubuntu versions, install package mtpfs instead of jmtpfs)\nThen each time you want to connect the phone, connect the USB cable, unlock the phone, then on the phone bring up the message list by sliding down from the top, and look for the entry \"Android system - USB for nnn\". Tap that item, so that an overlay window opens, that lets you set the USB mode. Explicitely select \"file transfer\". If file transfer is already selected, select something else instead, then bring the window up again, and select \"file transfer\" a second time. Yes, having to use this window twice smells very much like a Samsung bug.\nSometimes, especially after failed mount attempts, the phone also brings up an \"allow phone data access\" dialog, that only allows \"yes\" and \"no\" as answers. Using that dialog works, too.\nAfter all this preparation, just do:\njmtpfs ~/samsung\n\nAnd voilá, your long sought after files appear in your ~/samsung directory, and more important, stay there until you disconnect the USB cable or power off either the smartphone or the computer. It doesn't even hurt, if the phone locks its display or turns off the display, as long, as it is not completely off. But don't try to click on the icon for the phone in the Ubuntu/Kubuntu file viewer. That will attempt to open a second MTP session and could actually kill the first MTP session, too. Instead, access the aforementioned ~/samsung directory.\nTo unmount the phone later, just type:\nfusermount -u ~/samsung\n\n", "Q: Broken gnome-keyring file and google-chrome hangs After few weeks of uptime yesterday I rebooted my laptop.\nAfter that, I discovered that there is no password in gnome-keyring. gnome-keyring segfault and didn't work.

How is an LTS to LTS upgrade different than a Standard Release to Standard Release upgrade? Are fresh installs usually preferred to guarantee a stable environment?\n\nA: Any upgrade is a risk. Things can break in between. Power failure can be an issue. So purely based logics going from LTS to LTS is less risky than going LTS->NON-LTS->NON-LTS->NON-LTS->LTS. \nThe whole idea of using an LTS is to not upgrade in between LTSs. You get a lot of stability in exchange for not getting the latest software out-of-the-box.\nAnd yes; if possible I would always go for a reinstall. A reinstall has a side-effect: it will remove all packages you installed and that you never used.\n\nA: Because short term supports contain many broken packages and removing or adding them may cause serious complication in package dependencies.\nA user like me who likes to try things and always install packages from less reliable sources tend to get a lot lot of broken packages or even break good packages over time.\nSo it is always recommended to upgrade between LTSs\n", "Q: How to speed up VirtualBox Ubuntu 14.04 (disable visual effects, ...)

For example paplay:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade; paplay /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/stereo/message.ogg\n\nFurthermore, if you want to play a sound if the command was successfully completed and another sound in case of an error, you can use something like:\ncommand && paplay $(locate dialog-information.ogg) || paplay $(locate dialog-error.ogg)\n\nA: Try the below command on terminal,\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && aplay /path/to/Sound/filename.wav\n\n/path/to/Sound/filename.wav - path to your .wav file.\nThe sound wiil be played only if both the commands are executed successfully.\n", "Q: After install Ubuntu 14.04 not starting First I installed windows 7 about 6 months, then I installed Linux Mint 16 yesterday, and today I installed Ubuntu 14.04.\nI tarted it from a USB key, after the installation the PC restarted, I clicked on Ubuntu but it failed.\nPlease see the picture below:\n\nWhat can I do?\n\nA: It seems like you may run into a recognised problem - see this answer which explains how to progress when stuck at the initrafms prompt. \n", "Q: How to restore the new 14.04-lockscreen I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 but since some weeks I'm stuck with the old 13.10 lockscreen design for some reason. \nI already tried compizconfig-settings-manager but it doesn't offer me any option for changing the lockscreen design and even resetting Compiz and Unity with \ndconf reset -f /org/compiz/\n\ndidn't help.\nAre there any other ways to get the new lockscreen back?\n\nA: I had the same issue because of the on-screen keyboard.

A \"clean\" installation is also easier, and will ensure that your new Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (\"Trusty Tahr\") installation doesn't have any left-over \"junk\", which could slow things down or take-up valuable space.\n", "Q: Why do I have two bluetooth icons after the Ubuntu 14.04 upgrade?

So I created a swap file as described here and that solved my problem. I'm not getting the warning anymore.\n\nA: If you have enough physical memory installed, you could try fllowing:\n\n*\n\n*close all your vms.\n\n*In VMware Edit->Preferences->Memory->Additional Memory, chang \"Allow some/most virtual machine memory to be swapped\" to \"Fit all virtual machine memory into reserved host RAM\"\n\n\nA: While the above solution looks adequate, I was confused with the fact that I had included a 10GB swap partition during installation of 14.04.3. After looking at /etc/fstab I noticed that the line for the swap partition had been commented out during or after installation.\nThis page (could not mount /dev/mapper/cryptswap1) suggests this is a bug related to encrypting the home directory. I reformatted the partition as swap with GParted (because it was not recognised as such by the system), and verified the UUID (which had changed) with the command:\nsudo blkid\n\nThen I edited the line in fstab to include UUID of the swap, and uncommented it. After restarting my machine the system in general, as well as VMWare Workstation 12 Player, successfully recognised the swap partition.\nThe VM is now much faster. This could explain why things were running very slowly with an older version of the VMWare Player - perhaps the same version that didn't complain about absent swap space.\n\nA: This is what I did.

Then I configured burg with burg-manager, launching it, \"restoring burg to MBR\", then changing themes ecc\n\nA: You installed that from a PPA (n-muench/burg/ubuntu) that was intended for older versions of Ubuntu. It seems the PPA maintainer has not made an version for Trusty available in the PPA. Go to Launchpad.net and contact the PPA maintainer directly.\n\nA: What's happening is that the burg PPA has not been (yet) updated for Trusty (14.04):\n\n", "Q: NetworkManager tray (nm-applet) is gone after upgrade to 14.04 Trusty I upgraded from 13.10 to 14.04 and now the nm-applet no longer shows in the system tray.

When I run nm-applet manually in the terminal I get the following output:\n** (nm-applet:7419): WARNING **: Couldn't connect to accessibility bus: Failed to connect to socket /tmp/dbus-gBrnqcTAVj: Connection refused\n\nI tried multiple system trays: i3bar (my default), trayer and the xfce4-panel. Other tray apps work in all three of them (like dropbox). The network manager itself works, as it connects to known networks and outputs notifications.\nDoes someone know how to fix this?\n\nA: I had the same problem, but i just kill 'indicator-application-service' and icons network, bluetooth and skype appear again. I use xfce on amd64.\n\nA: You could use the indicator plugin instead, but you may see frequent crashes. The  crash is caused by the Applications Menus indicator. Add the indicator plugin and, before it crashes, right click on it, choose 'properties' and tick the 'hidden' checkbox next to the 'Application Menus (Global Menu)'  indicator. Then restart the panel with 'xfce4-panel -r'\nInstead, I fixed nm-applet by changing the 'Exec' line in /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop to 'dbus-launch nm-applet'\n\nA: It turns out that to see the nm-applet icon, you have to install package \"xfce4-indicator-plugin\" and add \"Indicator Panel\" to the panel.\nThat adds a whole bunch of icons that you probably don't want, and that ignore your theme choice.  But at least you'll have the nm-applet icon again.  For a while.  The indicator-panel dies every few seconds for me, and when it does stay running long enough for me to try configuring it, the configuration panel doesn't work either.\nYour mileage may vary - try the \"Indicator Panel\" and see if it works for you.\n\nA: I found the solution to this problem here: http://linuxg.net/how-to-fixrestore-the-missing-network-manager-from-the-unity-top-panel-on-ubuntu-13-04-raring-ringtail-and-ubuntu-12-10-quantal-quetzal/\nQuoting their site: The fix for this issue is simple, first stop the network-manager service, like this:\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/network-manager stop\n\nDelete the /var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.state file:\n$ sudo rm /var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.state\n\nTurn back on the network-manager service:\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/network-manager start\n\n\nA: I have the same issue and came across this solution: \nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2014/04/fix-lubuntu-1404-network-manager.html\nHope this helps!\n\nA: I blatantly stole the answer from one of the comments to http://www.webupd8.org/2014/04/fix-lubuntu-1404-network-manager.html as Adz linked to and Eric Carvalho suggested be included in an actual answer. So, now we have the answer here in AskUbuntu. This is what I did.\n\nDimitrios Charalampidis\n  This fix does not work for everybody... if that's the case for you, too.. then try this: go to menu >Preferences > Default applications for LXSession, select the autostart tab and scroll to find Network. Uncheck it and recheck it, then go to your home folder and press ctrl+h to show hidden files and folders, go to .config/autostart, there you will find a Network.desktop file right click on it and select Leafpad, it is likely that under NotShowIn section it includes LXDE just delete it, save the file and exit, then log out and login again this will fix the issue.\n\nFor those that came looking for the actual answer on that website, here it is.\n\nLubuntu 14.04: fix 1\nTo fix the Network Manager not showing up on the panel issue, from the Lubuntu menu select Preferences > Default applications for LXSession, then click on the Autostart tab and under \"Manual autostarted applications\" type \"nm-applet\", then click the \"+ Add\" button on the left:\nNow log out, log back in and you should see the Network Manager icon on the panel:\nfix somewhat via lffl.org\nLubuntu 14.04 / Xubuntu 14.04: fix 2\nIf the above solution didn't work for you in Lubuntu 14.04 or if you're using Xubuntu 14.04 and you're having this issue, here's another solution. Basically, the solution below is for those who must run \"nm-applet\" as root to get it to show up in the pane - we'll be using dbus-launch to launch nm-applet at startup.\nTo get the Network Manager applet to work properly in either Lubuntu 14.04 or Xubuntu 14.04, run the following command:\n  sudo sed -i 's/Exec=nm-applet/Exec=dbus-launch nm-applet/' /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop\n  The command above replaces \"nm-applet\" with \"dbus-launch nm-applet\" in the nm-applet autostart desktop file.\n\nUPDATED\nOk, I also followed the advice from here:\nhttp://www.bauer-power.net/2014/05/permanent-fix-for-missing-network.html\n\nWhat you need to do is edit /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop with your favorite text editor. I like nano, so I ran the following from the terminal:\n  sudo nano /etc/xdg/autostart/nm-applet.desktop\n  Go down to the Exec line and change the entry from nm-applet to dbus-launch nm-applet.

Having run into many snags and stability issues when upgrading (update-manager -d) from just release to release (For example: 13.04 - 13.10), I soon learned and have been told that it is always more reliable to just do fresh installs.\nHowever, when it comes to LTS to LTS upgrading (update-manager -d), I was told by a #ubuntu op that this is AS RELIABLE as doing a fresh install. I have a hard time understanding how that can be. If just release to release is prone to instability, what makes an LTS to LTS upgrade any different? How can it be as reliable as a fresh install?\n\nA: the short answer is no. An upgrade is always a risk of something going wrong. You should always backup your files before you do an upgrade. \nAn LTS to LTS or normal to normal release doesn't really matter it's still the same risk of something going wrong. \nthe tip that LTS to LTS would be more stable has some truth in it. It's true that the LTS release is more stable than the normal releases if you have semi-new hardware that's well supported.\nIf you have the newest hardware then it wont be fully supported (in most cases) which will result in a more unstable system. \nBut a new LTS system is still a new Ubuntu version and is as unstable as any new release. which means bugs and problems can occur just as often as with any other upgrade. Therefor it's not more stable to upgrade to. \n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 NFS v4 mount error incorrect mount option was specified I am trying to mount a nfs folder over network from NFS Server to NFS Client.\nMy NFS Server configuration looks like this\n/mount     192.168.145.128/255.255.255.0(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) 127.0.0.1/255.255.255.0(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)\n\nI have installed all required packages ( nfs-kernel-server nfs-common) on my server.\nI have also restarted the server using the option:\nservice nfs-kernel-server restart\n\nAt client end, I check the folder list that I can mount using\nshowmount -e 192.168.145.131\nExport list for 192.168.145.131:\n/mount 127.0.0.1/255.255.255.0,192.168.145.128/255.255.255.0\n\nBut when I try mounting the host folder, I get the following error:\nmount -t nfs -v 192.168.145.131:/mount mount/\nmount.nfs: timeout set for Fri Apr 18 17:34:44 2014\nmount.nfs: trying text-based options 'vers=4,addr=192.168.145.131,clientaddr=192.168.145.128'\nmount.nfs: mount(2): Invalid argument\nmount.nfs: an incorrect mount option was specified\n\nThis is my dmesg output:\ndmesg | tail\n[24930.733208] NFS: bad mount option value specified: vers=4\n\n\nA: I was getting the incorrect mount option error after I upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04.

In previous versions of Ubuntu, picking one of the default wallpapers meant that you saw it on the login screen as well.\nI am now on a clean install of Ubuntu 14.04, the LightDM wallpaper appears to be set at /usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png.  It is ignoring anything else.\nI tried setting a wallpaper by right clicking the desktop and choosing one of the default set (e.g. the one corresponding to /usr/share/backgrounds/Forever_by_Shady_S.jpg).  I then rebooted, but the LightDM wallpaper is still the default purple one.\nI had a look at the log file at /var/log/lightdm/x-0-greeter.log:\n[+0.10s] DEBUG: background.vala:483: Regenerating backgrounds\n[+0.10s] DEBUG: background.vala:68: Making background /usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png at 1920x1200,1440x900\n\nThe wiki page appears to be out of date as it is pointing to configuration file locations which no longer exist in 14.04.\nI did manage to find some potential config files at /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/ but the files there don't contain any specific path locations, so I am not sure how to proceed.\nI am aware of LightDM's pickiness - so this is about the default wallpapers that come with Ubuntu, all have read permissions globally and aren't encrypted or on separate drives.\n\n\nA: How to Change the LightDM wallpaper\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu Tweak\nFirst Install Ubuntu Tweak Click here to download the .deb  and install it though Gdebi, Ubuntu Software Center, ect...

Otherwise, the package system doesn't know that the file in that location is yours and it will get overwritten whenever the package is updated. Although ubuntu-wallpapers changes infrequently, it's likely to change when you upgrade your system to a new Ubuntu release.\nUsing dpkg-divert is simple:\nsudo dpkg-divert --local --rename /usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png\n\nThis renames the file with a .distrib suffix, and you're now free to add your own version of the file. Package updates will affect the .distrib file and not your replacement.\nI set the background I wanted using a symlink:\nsudo ln -s autumn-dusk.jpg /usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png\n\nIf you want to use one of your own files, just make sure it's accessible to other users. All the parent directories need to have read and execute permissions. You can check this with:\nsudo -u nobody file /usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png\n\nIf it's not accessible, you'll get a Permission denied message from file.\n\nA: I had a similar situation like you, but solved in a real simple way. For me, I successfully changed the background of lightdm to some custom wallpaper after a clean install. Then today, I changed it to another wallpaper and it failed and showed the default purple one. \nSo, I checked the x-0-greeter.log and found out that it tried to load my wallpaper but failed because the greeter had no permission. Then I checked the permission of the wallpaper image, and for some reason the permission setting for 'Others' was set for 'None'. I changed it to 'Read-only' and then greeter can now successfully load the custom wallpaper.\nPerhaps that might be the reason for your case too.\n\nA: In my case this Ask Ubuntu answer solved the problem.\nThe org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.background setting had been disabled but I could not determine why. Once I checked this checkbox in dconf-editor and changed my wallpaper, it was reflected on the login screen.\n\nDconf-Editor: ORG/GNOME/SETTINGS-DAEMON/PLUGINS/BACKGROUND\n\nWe can get the value of the above setting by running this command:\ngsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.background active\n\nWe can change this value with the command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.background active 'true'\n\n\nA: I simply copied my wallpaper on top of /usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png and it worked without problems.\n\nA: I just solved this by copying my background image into the folder /usr/share/backgrounds (with a pkexec nautilus -- lazy me, or in a better way with sudo cp /path/to/image.jpg /usr/share/backgrounds). After that, I changed the background image from Unity in a regular way. You have to do this last change for any of the desktop manager you have on your system. Also, I think image has to be outside of the user's folder.\nIt worked for me.\n\nA: Using Ubuntu Tweak did not work for this on my system.\nI solved this problem by following this ubuntuhandbook.org tutorial.\nThe image should be in /usr/share/backgrounds. You need to use sudo to write files at this location.\nAfter placing my image in that directory, I rebooted my machine and saw my image at the login screen.\n", "Q: Upgrading from 13.10 to 14.04 broke Grub I have a dual boot Ubuntu + Windows 8 on an UEFI system.

Please note that the Live CD must be the same as the system you are fixing - either 32-bit or 64-bit (if not then the chroot will fail).\n2) Open a terminal (Applications > Accessories > Terminal).  \n3) Determine your normal system partition - (the switch is a lowercase \"L\")\n\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nIf you aren't sure, run  \ndf -Th  \n\nLook for the correct disk size and ext3 or ext4 format.  \n4) Mount your normal system partition:\nSubstitute the correct partition: sda1, sdb5, etc.  \nsudo mount /dev/sdXX /mnt  \n\nExample: sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt \n5) Only if you have a separate boot partition:\nsdYY is the /boot partition designation (for example sdb3)\n sudo mount /dev/sdYY /mnt/boot \n6)\nMount the critical virtual filesystems:\n sudo mount --bind /dev  /mnt/dev\nsudo mount --bind /dev/pts  /mnt/dev/pts\nsudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc\nsudo mount --bind /sys  /mnt/sys \n7)\nChroot into your normal system device:\n\nsudo chroot /mnt \n8) If there is no /boot/grub/grub.cfg or it's not correct, create one using\nupdate-grub \n9)\nReinstall GRUB 2:\nSubstitute the correct device - sda, sdb, etc. Do not specify a partition number.\ngrub-install /dev/sdX \n10) Verify the install (use the correct device, for example sda.

(How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?)\n\nA: I have had the same problem. My guess is that, since I have two hard drives, the system is trying to start from the wrong drive where an old version of GRUB is installed. My solution was to start Ubuntu with a USB stick (it does not matter which version). Once you start, these commands will do it, run as root:\nmkdir /tmp/drive\nsudo mount /dev/sdX1 /tmp/drive\nsudo mount --bind /dev /tmp/drive/dev\nsudo mount --bind /proc /tmp/drive/proc\nsudo mount --bind /sys /tmp/drive/sys\nsudo chroot /tmp/drive\ndpkg-reconfigure grub-pc\n\nWhere sdX1 must be the drive where your system is installed. When you run the last command you should select the sdX drive, though I guess running it multiple times will install the new version of grub on each drive and give you some piece of mind.\n\nA: Had the same error \"symbol 'grub_term_highlight_color' not found\", stuck at Grub rescue. Tried boot-repair (recommended option), but didn't work!\nSolution: Downloaded bootable boot-repair.iso (http://sourceforge.net/projects/boot-repair-cd/) and made a bootable usb disk. Booted from it and connected to internet and started \"Recommended Repair\", then followed the instructions in a few steps (deleted/uninstalled grub and then re-installed a new version), which worked for me! I guess in your case grub should be uninstalled and then re-installed on sda8 instead of sdb1.\n\nA: I had the same error upgrading from 13.10 to 14.04. These instructions looked a bit daunting for me. \nI ended up creating a bootable USB drive with Super Grub Disk on it.\nhttp://www.supergrubdisk.org/\nBooted from that. At boot told it to detect installed OSs. It found my Ubuntu 14.04 install so I told it to boot that. Booted up no problem.\nI already had Boot Repair installed on my system.\nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/boot-repair\nRan that and accepted the default changes.\nShutdown. Took the USB drive out of the slot, pressed power and waited with held breath.\nSystem booted normally! Problem solved.\n\nA: My guess is youu have stale EFI files in your EFI partition. There is a launchpad bug specific to the EFI situation which I suspect addresses your case. It worked for me after all the other suggestions didn't. The fix is to update EFI files manually. Below is a walk-through. Note that you'll need to substitute your EFI partition in place of /dev/sda1.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to live CD\n\n*Open xterm\n\n*Use parted to determine your EFI partition: sudo parted -l (substitute for /dev/sda1 in next step)\n\n*Mount your EFI partition: sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\n*Update the Boot EFI file: sudo cp /mnt/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi /mnt/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi\n\nA: Use the boot-repair CD to fix grub errors: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair#A1st_option_:_get_a_CD_including_Boot-Repair\n", "Q: rvm /usr/bin/env: ruby no such file error I've installed rvm + ruby systemwide.\nwhich ruby\n/usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.1/bin/ruby\n\nand:\n/usr/bin/env: ruby: No such file or directory\n\nEverything else works fine, putting direct path of ruby in my executables work fine.\n\nA: The PATH is what the env program uses to search for your executables. You can change this per-user (in the $HOME/.bashrc). In order to do that, run nano $HOME/.bashrc and go to the last line, add a new line\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.1/bin\n\nTo change it at a system level you sudo nano /etc/login.defs and change this line\nENV_PATH        PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games\n\nto\nENV_PATH        PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games:/usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.1/bin\n\n\nA: I realize this is a somewhat old question, but I spent a day+ trying to nail this problem down, and I found what I think is a solid best practices type of solution -- use the rvm wrappers.\n/usr/bin/env ruby gives you the capability to use the Ruby version of your choice so you don't have to edit the executable shell scripts (in /bin) with a hard coded directory path to make them work (I've seen this as a suggested fix elsewhere).\nAs noted in the answers above, the key is the $PATH setting in /etc/environment, but I came up with a different solution.\nRVM gives us a symbolic link directory of all the installed ruby versions and aliases at /usr/local/rvm/wrappers/. \nIf you set your $PATH var to use the wrapper directory associated with the Ruby version you want to use e.g.\nPATH=\"/usr/local/rvm/wrappers/ruby-1.9.3-p547:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\"\n\nYou will have set the RVM environment such that /usr/bin/env ruby_command will work.\nAt least this resolved this problem for me. I hope this helps someone out there save some time.\n\nA: I recently faced this issue and took a different approach, so thought of sharing it. This happens when the ruby file is not present in the directory mentioned. So create a symbolic link to the ruby file in the directory and your error should be fixed.\ncd /usr/bin/env\nln -s /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.1/bin/ruby\n\nA: I got the same error\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby  in top of my script leads to\nrvm /usr/bin/env: ruby no such file error\n\nif I execute the script.\nMy solution was as simple as hard to find:\nThe encoding of linefeeds in my script /sourcecode editor was set to \"windows style (CR + LF)\".\nAfter switching it to \"unix style (LF)\" and saving my script again, the error is gone.\nSeems the Carriage return (CR) sign was left behind the \"ruby\" so theres no ruby filname.script but ruby\\R filename.script which leads to the error.\n", "Q: Flash and Java plug-ins in Chromium lost after upgrade to 14.04 I've just upgraded 12.04 to 14.04.

Back in the previous releases, I used the compiz plugins \"window decoration\" and \"window rules\" to have a transparent, sticky, unmovable gnome-terminal acting as a wallpaper. The trick was to create a profile with a permanent title (transparent) and then use the filter title=transparent and !title=transparent in the different plugin rules.\nThe result looked like this:\n\nAfter the upgrade, I've noticed that the window decoration rule no longer applies. Aparently, window decorations are now managed by the unity plugin and not the gtk-window-decorator, which I suppose was necessary to create the locally integrated menus. Now the terminal looks like this:\n\nIf I try to force the \"window decoration\" plugin, it asks me to disable the unity plugin, and then all the desktop crashes. So my question is if there's a workaround to force compiz not to use decorations on this specific window. Maybe with some sort of parameter when launching the terminal.\n\nA: An oldie but goody that still works to deal with window decorations is devilspie\n\nhow to\nInstall devilspie:\nsudo apt-get install devilspie\n\nThen create a new folder in your home folder:\nmkdir ~/.devilspie\n\nCreate a new file in this folder called terminal.ds and paste the following:\n(if\n    (is (application_name) \"Terminal\")\n    (begin\n       (undecorate)\n       (geometry \"1024x300+4+450\")\n    ) )\n\nThe key part here is (undecorate) to remove the window decoration for the terminal application.\n(geometry) is used to control the location and size of the application, in this case 1024 in length, 300 pixels high and placed in the position 4 x 450\nWhen testing, edit the file, then run devilspie to see the changes enacted.\nWhen you are happy, just put nohup devilspie & as a startup application to run on login.\nObviously you'll lose the titlebar if you intend to use locally integrated menus.  If you stick with global menus then this works very well.\nMore information about devilspie can be found here.\nfinally\nDont forget that you are still able to move the terminal window around the screen - just use the shortcut key Alt+F7 to enable the window move capability and drag the mouse point around to position the terminal.\n\nJust in-case you are not already aware of the option - to set the transparency of the terminal, use edit - profile preferences and select the Transparent Background option\n\n", "Q: Use Eduroam to connect to PEAP and MSCHAPv2 I'm been using Eduroam on my Ubuntu-client for the last three years now, and with every new version, there is harder and harder to connect to Eduroam (my university network). \nUp until now it has worked with just using PEAP and MSCHAPv2, with my university credentials. this time though after endless hours, it's still not willing to connect.

Next you should repair your windows installation with your Windows DVD, using the Repair your computer option, and after you finish with this one, you can download Boot Repair CD iso image and burn it on a regular CD or put it on USB key via Unetbootin. I assume you're using Windows 7 ?\nNext you should restart your computer with Boot Repair CD in tray and after it finishes loading you can choose the 'Recommended Repair' option to finally fix your dual-boot configuration and be able to boot into both Windows and Ubuntu.\nIf grub does not see your Windows OS after running sudo update-grub, it could be because you installed grub on the Ubuntu partition, and you should do the same steps, namely repair Windows mbr with your bootable Windows DVD, and then use Boot Repair CD to fix your boot problems.\nAlmost forgot to mention that you should download the 64bit iso image for Boot Repair CD if you're using a 64bit system, and the 32bit iso image if you're using a 32bit OS.\n\nA: I am not sure but this video in the link below may help you.\nhttp://m.youtube.com/#/watch?list=PL99ADC865431A3C3E&v=_lL2xc1P8yM\n\nA: I upgraded from 13.10 to 14.04 and lost Grub.

I realized that though I configured my Dell Inspiron 6000 500M Ram to boot from USB, when I selected \"Install Lubuntu\" I would get to an install step where it asked me to mount the CD-Rom. As I was using a USB I was forced to abort the install. Instead I burned a Lubuntu 14.04 LTS alternative iso CD and installed from it.

As you have already seen, you sometimes need to use sudo to perform certain actions (this requires password); alternatively, you can become \"root\" to perform actions without needing to use sudo.\nHave a look at the Ubuntu documentation on \"root\" and sudo (which includes a link for information on adding users) and/or Wikipedia on sudo if this is new to you.

And after upgrading and after booting the only thing that happens is that screen doesn't show ubuntu logo for booting and that at some point it turns off. Also then I hear ubuntu sound when it comes to login screen. The screen doesn't turn on after that. (Also I have to tell you that I tried to install ubuntu 14.04 from USB and that there was the same problem. It asked me what I want to do (Try or install ubuntu) and it doesn't matter what option I selected the result was the same.)\nThen I decided to try some stuf. First I tried to bootup with Ubuntu with Linux 3.11.0-19-generic. And it went well. The screen was working and everything was fine. Then I decided to try to hook my desktops screen on laptop via HDMI and right away it worked. Both screens were on and I had two screens. So I went in System Settings -> Displays and there saw 3 screens. Built-in Display, my secondary desktop display and unknown display. In 13.10 I had to turn of Unknown Display because all the workspaces were size of built-in display + Unknown Display so I didn't saw my edges.\nNow that I know that my graphics drivers work and everything is fine, I tried default booting in ubuntu. Still connected to my desktop display via HDMI it started booting and booted. But the problem was that only desktops display was working. Laptops display was off. So happily I again went into Display settings only to notice that I only get two displays. Desktops and some other with strange unfamiliar name: Chi Mei Optoelectronics corp. 15,6\" (I will add screen shots :) ). This other screen was on and should somewhere work but not on laptop. As far as I can remember Laptops screen was always named Built-in Display (in 12.04 and 13.10).

In general, you should always use the most recent kernel, which is the one with the highest version number.

You can tell this from the fact that it is the only other screen, and it is 15.6\". The fact that it is not being detected as the \"Built-in Display\" is probably a bug.\nI suggest that you download the latest Ubuntu image (ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64.iso) and boot from it with your external monitor disconnected. Check whether your internal display works. Then connect the external monitor and enable it in the display settings. This will eliminate the possibility that your problems are being caused by any old config files from Ubuntu 13.10 that are still present on your system.\n\nA: It sounds like a backlight issue. You may try this fix.\n\nA: Don't know if your problem is same as mine. I had this problem of screen going black whenever totem was launched. I changed the launcher placement to the one which matched with my desktop (mine is Lenovo 20'') and totem then stopped blacking the screen.\n", "Q: Alternative to the CLI command \"more\" I have search google over and over looking for an alternative to the command more.

We currently have a single Samsung 840pro SSD hooked up to the first SATA channel. We want to double the storage and bandwidth by adding another 840pro to the other SATA channel and striping our reads/writes with RAID0.\nI checked the block diagram for the motherboard, it appears the southbridge has enough bandwidth to support this setup. We'll benchmark this to make sure, and add a controller card if necessary.\nFirst, our current SSD we don't have discard in the fstab, we simply run trim as a daily cron job. The command is fstrim -v / 2>&1 | logger -t trim. Will this work in a RAID setup?\nSecond, stripe size seems like a critical decision with an SSD. I've read this should be 64kb per SSD due to erase block size... leading me to think that 128k is the minimum correct stripe size. Eh?\nThird, we planned to have the raid partitions use the entire SSDs. I suspect we no longer have to worry about partition alignment, since any partitions(swap) will be on top of the virtual raid device. My other thought is there may have to be a boot partition, since it's unlikely we'll have RAID0 support at boot. If this is the case, how do we align the boot and the main partition for this particular SSD?\nAnswers to any of these questions or advice, caveats etc is much appreciated.

There are a lot of links in this post, follow them and upvote them to give the authors the relevant kudos.  \nIt is often suggested to remove or purge all of your PPAs when doing a version upgrade; I often have a lot of troubles remembering which PPA are installed and which packages are \"owned\" by a particular PPA --- you sometime install a PPA but that does not mean that you have installed all packages from it. \nFor the list of PPA there are quite a lot of good scripts around; and for discovering the packages really installed from a PPA you can use apt-cache policy or similar commands. \nBut --- what about a one-stop script to list all your installed PPAs and all the packages you have installed from them? \n\nA: The following script will give you a list like the following: \nPPA:tualatrix/ppa\n--->  ubuntu-tweak\nPPA:otto-kesselgulasch/gimp\n--->  gimp\n--->  gimp-data\n--->  gimp-help-common\n--->  gimp-help-en\n--->  gimp-help-en-gb\n--->  gimp-help-es\n--->  gimp-help-it\n--->  gimp-plugin-registry\n--->  libgimp2.0\n--->  libopenjpeg-dev\n--->  libopenjpeg5\n\nScript following (copy it to a file and make it executable):\n#! /bin/bash\n#\nlist_all_packages_repos() {\napt-cache policy $(dpkg -l | awk 'NR >= 6 { print $2 }') |\n  awk '/^[^ ]/    { split($1, a, \":\"); pkg = a[1] }\n    nextline == 1 { nextline = 0; printf(\"%-40s %-50s %s\\n\", pkg, $2, $3) }\n    /\\*\\*\\*/      { nextline = 1 }'\n    }\n\nlist_packages_of() { #1 is the tmpfile, $2 is the ppa regexp\n    grep \"$2\" \"$1\" | awk '{print \"---> \", $1}'\n}\n\n# cache all packages files now \n\ntmpfile=/tmp/list_pcks.$$.txt\nlist_all_packages_repos > $tmpfile\n\n# listppa Script to get all the PPA installed on a system ready to share for reininstall\nfor APT in $(find /etc/apt/ -name \"*.list\"); do\n    grep -o \"^deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/[a-z0-9\\-]\\+/[a-z0-9\\-]\\+\" \"$APT\" | while read ENTRY ; do\n        USER=$(echo \"$ENTRY\" | cut -d/ -f4)\n        PPA=$(echo \"$ENTRY\" | cut -d/ -f5)\n        echo  PPA:$USER/$PPA\n    list_packages_of \"$tmpfile\" \"$USER/$PPA\"\n    done\ndone\n\nrm \"$tmpfile\"\n\n", "Q: Can't run Vidalia due to an AppArmor policy error I installed Vidalia , and added a user to debian-tor group.\nBut when I run it , it gets me error:\n$ vidalia \n\n(process:5691): GConf-WARNING **: Client failed to connect to the D-BUS daemon:\nAn AppArmor policy prevents this sender from sending this message to this recipient, 0 matched rules; type=\"method_call\", sender=\"(null)\" (inactive) interface=\"org.freedesktop.DBus\" member=\"Hello\" error name=\"(unset)\" requested_reply=\"0\" destination=\"org.freedesktop.DBus\" (bus)\n\n(<unknown>:5691): GLib-GIO-ERROR **: No GSettings schemas are installed on the system\nTrace/breakpoint trap (core dumped)\n\nHow can I solve it?\n\nA: I tried it:\nsudo ln -s /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.vidalia /etc/apparmor.d/disable/\nsudo apparmor_parser -R /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.vidalia\nsudo /etc/init.d/tor start\n\nOk , now vidalia works fine:\n$ vidalia\n\n", "Q: HDMI Audio crackling only in Google Chrome I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 64bit and it's awesome.

He got some nasty viruses on it and we can not bypass the password (he got one of those \"your computer appears to have been hacked\" phone calls and let them onto hix box) they locked the admin as well, and we can't find syskey (a couple people have tried this before I was asked to fix it). So I figure the best thing to do would be to just back up all of his documents to an external hdd, and give him a fresh install (unless someone has a better idea). Anyways his tower won't let me boot from USB for some reason (i've tried everything I know of to get it to and it just won't), so I created a Damn Small Linux cd to boot live, since apparently Ubuntu is now too big to fit onto a CD (I swear I have a v10 floating around somewhere, just can't find it sadly). From googling it seems lots of people have done exactly what I want to do, so it is more than capable of transferring files to an external from a xp partition. \nAs I am a newb when it comes to this stuff I learned I can't use NTFS with DSL, so I used the bootable usb on a laptop and partitioned it as FAT, which finally allowed me read/write access (it would read-only as NTFS just wouldn't let me write). \nSo now my question is, the external is a formatted, wiped clean.

I'm now comfortably running 14.04 with all my data back and all is well in the world. I'm just having some really weird post install issues with 14.04 that I'm having trouble finding information on:\n1.) Reboot from terminal is not functional - As in the command \"sudo reboot now\". I had to add the reboot=pci flag to /etc/default/grub and run sudo grub-update to make regular reboot work, but reboot now currently hangs on a black screen, and when I press the power button, shuts down the computer, not restarts it. It's not that big of a deal but it's still weird.\n2.) When I launch GParted, it hangs on \"searching /dev/sda partitions...\" forever. This was previously working on 12.04 and I would like it to work on 14.04. I have tried uninstalling and re-installing it.\nThanks!\n\nA: Common causes of \"searching ... partitions...\" taking an long time are:  (1) A floppy device is enabled in the BIOS, but there is no physical floppy device,  (2) A partition contains a highly fragmented FAT16/32 or NTFS file system - fix with defragmenting first.\n", "Q: Unable to setup Jekyll In Ubuntu? after upgrading to 14.04, Ruby was downgraded to 1.8.3 so I tried to upgrade using the following commands.\nsudo apt-get install libgdbm-dev libncurses5-dev automake libtool bison libffi-dev\ncurl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable\nsource ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm\necho \"source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm\" >> ~/.bashrc\nrvm install 2.1.1\nrvm use 2.1.1 --default\nruby -v\n\nAfter that i ran \nsudo gem install jekyll\n\nIt was installed sucessfully but, I am not able to use it is says\nbash: /usr/local/bin/jekyll: /usr/bin/ruby1.9.1: bad interpreter: No such file or directory\n\n\nA: Install ruby1.9.1-dev for Jekyll\nsudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1-dev\n\nIf you have other version of Ruby, remove it first.\ni.e for Ruby 2.0\nsudo apt-get purge ruby2.0*\n\n\nA: It appears that ruby might not be installed at the searched location.

While trying to fix the graphics, I managed to break the X session.\nNow, after typing my password in the unity-greeter, the items disappear and I can only see the desktop background and the pointer. This happens for every user. I can still log in in tty's. How can I solve this?\nAlso, I cannot seem to be able to install nvidia-current as it tries to install nvidia-304 and it depends on old video-abi libraries. Is there a way to tell the package manager that nvidia-current should use a newer version?\n\nA: I was using a custom theme with my older version(12.04) so i reset it to the default. first i tried switching to the Ambience(default) theme. you may try thst through right clicking and selecting \" Change Desktop Background. through there you can get into some settings menus.\n-or-\nyou can reset Compiz. You'll need to do it though outside of Unity. Log out, switch to a console (CTRL+ALT+F1) and then delete your Compiz settings and cache:\nrm -r ~/.cache/compizconfig-1\nrm -r ~/.compiz\n\nLog out of the console, switch back to the GUI (CTRL+ALT+F7) and log in. Compiz should fall back on it's defaults, and you'll have your desktop back, minus any customization you may have done. \nI rebooted and everything worked... better than it did. still a few issues but not related to this one. also this is my first answer post, be gentle.\n\nA: OK, I managed to fix my problem following this procedure.\nI booted Ubuntu in advanced settings and first repaired all destroyed/corrupted packages. I had a total of 700 MB of corrupted packages to be fixed from a crash during the 13.10->14.04 upgrade. Afterwards i booted into the root terminal.\nI then went ahead to remove all proprietary drivers by\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia* bumblebee*\n\nAnd then went ahead to install the opensource 'nouveau'-drivers which in general are not recommended (performance wise), but since i don't need any extensive 3D graphics on my work computer and all other drivers failed to work for me, this was the only solution.\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dri xserver-xorg-core xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\n\nAfter trying to fix my issues in various ways i wanted to make sure that i didn't screw up the Unity and Ubuntu packages, so i reinstalled those\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop unity\n\nI rebooted my computer and everything has worked ever since. I'm not sure if its my computer or the drivers, but i was not quite satisfied with the speed of Unity/Compiz, so i installed the Compiz Config Settings Manager and changed visual effects from \"Good\" to \"Fast\"\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\n\nA: If you gave up then you cannot confirm if this solution works for you or not. But I will post anyway in the hope that somebody else may benefit from it.\nShort version:\nPlease, try renaming the directory /home/[user_name]/.config/dconf to /home/[user_name]/.config/dconf.original\nDo it from a text terminal or if you can use gui (more of this latter) do it from a different session than the user session being fixed. Then login again as the affected user. Did the problem solve?\nLong version:\nMy system has 4 users. Two users are members of the admin group and can use the sudo command. I upgraded from 13.10 to 14.04. After some time using 14.04 the second admin user started to have the same problem, from login at the greeter to a background image with a mouse pointer and nothing more, no menu bar at the top of the screen and no unity launcher to start programs, also CTRL+ALT+L didn't work anymore, to close the session go to another tty and use sudo restart lightdm was necessary.\nThe affected user can use Gnome 3 without problems, only Unity session was affected.\nAs all others users could login using Unity or Gnome 3, It was obvious that something got corrupted in the side of the affected user. I wanted to fix that session without having to delete the user and recreate It. So I renamed his .config directory in the hope that inside It a configuration file was causing all this. And It was exactly that. The next login attempt into a Unity session was OK (but all programs reseted to their defaults). If I put the original .config directory in place, problem reappeared. Then I started to work in the .config directory, first I renamed half of its subdirectories (there were about 40 subdirectories), and in the first attempt I'd hit the group that contains the culprit. Then I'd put in place half of that half, and problem reappeared. Then I renamed half of that last group and... I think you already know how this goes on.\nUsing this method I eventually hit the culprit. Rename dconf directory solved the problem.\n.config/dconf contents (actually a single file) does not necessarily have to be corrupted. Maybe it is not corrupt (at the filesystem level, my filesystem is clean) but contains invalid data that ended there because of some bug in who knows which component of the system.\nAlso I noted in your case all users are affected, so this may not be the solution to your problem. But I think that It's possible that all users experience this at the same time and still may be caused by the same file (at each user .config directory).\n\nA: This bug depends on several factors, including Video card and custom config files. For example, some users have solved the issue by doing one or several of the following \"solutions\" (Not all work for everyone, some users even need a combination depending on how the session was configured and hardware used):\nFix 1 - Compiz Problems (OpenGL module not loading, Unity plugin not loading) \nsudo rm -fr ~/.cache/compizconfig-1\nsudo rm -fr ~/.compiz\n\nFix 2 - Session not loading (Guest session loads fine)\nsudo rm -fr ~/.Xauthority\nsudo rm -fr ~/.config/autostart\n\nFix 3 - Session not loading (Guest not loading)\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop unity compizconfig-settings-manager upstart\n\nFix 4 - Launcher / Top Panel not loading (Nvidia cards)\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa -y\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-340\nsudo reboot\n\nFix 5 - Clearing Unity\ndconf reset -f /org/compiz/\nsetsid unity\n\nFix 6 - Clearing the Cache\nsudo rm -fr .cache/*\n\nWARNING - This will clear the cache for all apps inside of the .cache folder.\nFor most of these cases, if the session opens and you still can not see the top panel or the launcher, try opening a terminal CTRL+ALT+T and typing ccsm (Assuming you already installed the compizconfig-settings-manager package) then enable the OpenGL plugin and the Unity Plugin. If the driver is working well, this should enable both panels in a couple of seconds. There are even some cases where the Unity plugin in the compiz config settings manager is simply not enabled.\n\nA: This is what fixed my problem.  Once you are booted up to the blank desktop... press CTRL + ALT + F1.\napt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\napt-get install unity\napt-get purge nvidia* bumblebee*\napt-get install nvidia-prime\nshutdown -r now\n\nWhen the computer came back, my login screen was in high-def resolution.  I entered my password.  WAIT for a minute, there is a startup delay and BAM desktop appeared and popups whre there, little slow on the start up.\n\nA: I had the same problem!\nI purged the fglrx\nsudo apt-get purge fglrx-*\n\nI also clear the compiz and cache\nmkdir ~/backup\nsudo mv ~/.compiz ~/backup\nsudo mv ~/.cache ~/backup\n\nafter rebooting and logging in, wait a while. It eventually appeared.\n\nA: Starting from June 3rd, 2014 I had this problem on several computers with Intel VGA and none of the proposed solutions has solved the problem.\nAfter several days of researches and attempts I found to be caused by the package xserver-xorg-video-intel found in Xorg-edgers PPA.\nTo solve the problem, simply run these two commands:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\n\nand then reboot.\n\nA: Something like:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\nshould reconfigure X.  \nOnce you can login, you should just be able to download the driver directly from nVidia's site and install it that way. \n\nA: The problem is update gnome-session.\nAfter reboot run these two commands:\nopen command line CTRL+ALT+F1\nSign in\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gnome-session\nreboot your system\n\nThe problem is solved\n", "Q: Cannot upgrade from Kubuntu 13.10 to 14.04 The upgrade tool start.

Is there a way to introduce a persistent memory onto this?\nThe other question I have is, if I do the Unetbootin method, usb-creator, or pen drive linux, am I able to update my flash drive OS and keep it updated or will I have to get updates every time?\n\nA: For your first question: Yes. The easiest is probably to use Unetbootin or usb-creator. For Unetbootin, turn the \"Space used to preserve files across reboots (Ubuntu only)\" option to something more than 0. For usb-creator, the slider near the bottom is the measure. If you prefer to roll your own grub config, the boot option is \"persistent\" and there must be a file or partition somewhere with a filesystem on it called \"casper-rw\".\nFor the second: Treat it like another computer. When you boot it up, install the updates, just like you would any other computer. You will need ~1-4GB of space for persistence for it to work, or else you will run out of space (you will eventually anyway, just be prepared).\n\nA: You can do a few Full installs to separate partitions on the pendrive with various o/s and each will retain modifications.\nIf you want to do a few persistent, (Frugal), installs, the persistence mechanism needs to be different, as with Ubuntu, Puppy, Debian, etc.\nDo not try to share a casper-rw file between different 'buntus, things will go really wonky.\nSuggest only include the word \"persistent\" in the menuentry of the one 'buntu in grub.cfg you want persistent.\nLet me know if you need clarification.\nI suggest not trying to do a software update with a persistent install, when you fill casper-rw the drive will not boot.\nAlso you can not upgrade the kernel of a persistent install.\nI use the MultiBootUSB script to boot multiple o/s iso's on USB using grub2.\nI have had both Ubuntu and Puppy working persistently. Had no luck with Debian persistence.\n", "Q: laptop fails to suspend or hibernate (wakes up after 2-5 seconds without user interaction) This all started happening after upgrading to 13.10, now I am running 14.04 and still have the same issue.\nWhen I close the lid or I do sudo pm-suspend the laptop goes into suspend for 2-5 seconds and awakes by itself.\nSame happens if I try to do hibernate.\nI have a gut feeling that something is awaking/taking the cpu out of suspend mode but I cannot figure out what.\nAny help troubleshooting this annoying issue?\nEdit: \nThanks to @Fabian , I was able to figure out that it looks like the ethernet card is misbehaving and even after I set the card to not wake up on lan (either doing acpitool -W 3 or echo disabled > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:19.0/power/wakeup or echo IGBE > /proc/acpi/wakeup, the laptop keeps waking up and showing this when I do acpitool -w\nDevice  S-state   Status   Sysfs node\n---------------------------------------\n1.

So, it must've been something related to hardware.\nTo automate it, I've created two simple suspend/wakeup scripts (tested on the above mentioned hardware, Ubuntu Trusty 14.04): sudo gedit /etc/pm/sleep.d/99_e1000e_remove :\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# Remove e1000e kernel module prior to suspend\nrmmod e1000e\n\nand\nsudo gedit /etc/pm/power.d/99_e1000e_probe :\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# Modprobe e1000e kernel module after resume\nmodprobe e1000e\n\nScripts should be executable (sudo chmod +x /etc/pm/sleep.d/99_e1000e_remove /etc/pm/power.d/99_e1000e_probe). \nNotes: \n\n\n*\n\n*I assume the scripts are pretty safe to use even when it does not\naddress your problem.  \n\n*I'm not using LAN wakeup, so I don't know how\nit behaves with the fix.\n\n\nA: The following worked for me:\ncat /proc/acpi/wakeup\n\nLook for any items with status enabled that look like they don't belong there (for me, anything except LID0). Then disable them by saying, for example:\nsudo sh -c \"echo XHC0 > /proc/acpi/wakeup\"\n\nCheck that the corresponding entries have indeed been disabled, send the laptop into suspend and hope for the best :)\n\nA: I have kernel 13.13 and Intel Z77X based motherboard, and following command works for me:\nsudo sh -c \"echo EHC1 > /proc/acpi/wakeup;echo EHC2 > /proc/acpi/wakeup;echo XHC > /proc/acpi/wakeup\"\n\n\nA: This worked for me (taken from another thread on askubuntu):\nUbuntu 14.04 wake up immediately after suspend\n\nYou can try to disable it with a Upstart script every startup\n  automatically:\nCreate a file etc/init/disable-XHC.conf\nContent:\nstart on started dbus\nstop on stopping dbus\n\nscript\n   sudo -u root sh -c \"echo 'XHC' > /proc/acpi/wakeup\"\nend script\n\n\n\nA: The systemd solution is to create an instruction for systemd-tmpfiles to write something to a file when it is invoked.\nCreate a file in /etc/tmpfiles.d, e.g. /etc/tmpfiles.d/disable-network-wake.conf, with the following content, depending on what device you want to disable wakeup for.\nw /proc/acpi/wakeup - - - - XHC\n\nSee also systemd-tmpfiles(8) and tmpfiles.d(5).\nRef: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd#Temporary_files\n", "Q: Packard Bell TS11HR touchpad scroll gesture doesn't work I've installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my PackardBell TS11HR.\nScrolling by dragging right side bar on touchpad doesn't work while two-finger dragging does work.\nIs anything wrong with touchpad drivers?\nIs there any thing I can do?

I want to delete that and make \"collinblatt\" the default.\n\nA: You are making a thinking - error ;)\nI assume you have two collin- user accounts: collin-blatt and collinblatt.\nIf you login as collinblatt, the home icon will be on the collinblatt folder, if you login as collin-blatt, it will be on the collin-blatt folder. That has nothing to do with a presumed \"default home directory\"; it is always on the current user's home folder.\nIf you indeed have two user accounts, move your important files to the collinblatt folder and login as collinblatt, remove the collin-blatt account. \nIf you created the folder:collinblatt manually, remove it, create a new user account (with administrator's permissions) collinblatt, login into the new account, copy the files into the new user's home directory and remove the collin-blatt account from your new account.\nThe only thing you have to keep in mind is that if you have internal references inside your collin-blatt folder, they will have to be edited, since your username is different. Therefore I would not copy the contents of the folders 1:1, but just move the files.\n\nA: These are terse instructions on purpose, because they are in the category \"do that only if you exactly know what you are doing\". So you are not supposed to cut and paste them...\nIn Ubuntu systems, a normal user(1) 'joe' has as home directory '/home/joe'. You can change that so that user  'joe' has as home directory '/home/jack', but you can find problems onward --- you have been warned. \nTo do that, logout from your user 'joe'. Log in with another user (an administrative one), and from a terminal do \nman usermod \n\nand study it, especially the flags -m and --home. If still convinced, do\nusermod --move-home --home /home/jack joe\n\nwith the obvious sudo in front of it. \n(1) notice that this is not true for system user, like 'root'.\n\nA: I will explain the full steps for modifying the home directory defined as $HOME for let us say user elise. The default directory of this admin user was set by the System install of Ubuntu and is /home/elise as seen from the Terminal cmd. line:\n$ echo $HOME\n/home/elise\n\nNow I want it to be /home/ubuntu-xenial/elise. I use this in order to properly upgrade to a newer release of Ubuntu, as you can perform this way, a fresh install and later move the hidden files from your previous home directory following an automatic install of all packages installed in the previous Ubuntu release.\nTo check the user modification use:\n$ sudo grep -E --color 'elise' /etc/passwd\nelise:x:1000:1000:Elise,,,:/home/elise:/bin/bash\n\nFirst you cannot modify a logged user. So if you don't have another admin user you will have to create one. We will create here a tempuser with a home directory to properly login, using useradd, so we will use the -m, --create-home option. As seen in the manpage there is a long and abbreviated command name, here are both (Use only one):\n$ sudo useradd --home-dir /home/tempuser --create-home --shell /bin/bash --groups sudo tempuser\n$ sudo useradd -d /home/tempuser -m -s /bin/bash -G sudo tempuser\n\nThen we create a password for tempuser:\n$ sudo passwd tempuser\n\nType in a new password for the temporary user when prompted.

Yesterday I installed the latest Kubuntu release 14.04. So I meet a little problems with the media conversions. The old FFmpeg is finally replaced with avconv which is in the libav-tools library. Till now i was using ffmpeg and every mp4 or flv to mp3 conversion was very fast. For example if one file around 5mins length was converted for ~20secs, now the same file is converted ~3-4-5 times slower. I read everywhere, but could not find where is the problem.. Is there any cure about that?\nBest regards :)\n\nA: So the answer is in one simple parameter -vn which disable video recording for the output which is actually unneeded when making conversion from mp4(probably every video file) to mp3.\n‘-vn (output)’ \nDisable video recording.\nIn my case I'm using Download Helper for Firefox. I made custom mp3 conversion where added this parameter there and now everything is even faster than ffmpeg.\n\nA: It would be well worth experimenting a little with the avconv -threads option. For example when transcoding from mp4 to mp3 file, as you mentioned, try something like the following:\navconv -i input.mp4 -threads auto -vn -c:a libmp3lame -qscale:a 3 output.mp3\n\nThe -threads option also accepts an integer so you could experiment a little with this. If this makes no difference the eventual answer is probably that your copy of FFmpeg encodes faster than your copy of avconv.

I wanted to dual boot mac os x with ubuntu 14.04 desktop 64-bit, so I set up a secondary partition using disk utility (not bootcamp assistant as it wants a windows 7 disk). I rebooted, booted from the ubuntu dvd I burned (there are two options in the boot menu, the EFI version called \"EFI boot\" and the BIOS version misleadingly called \"windows,\" I chose the EFI one), and first thing I do is check disk for defects, and there aren't any. So I reboot and start up the installer, but the Ubuntu splash screen comes up garbled and it stays there forever. (I've waited 2 hours, I don't think the live cd is supposed to take that long to start). So I noticed there was something wrong.\nOne potential solution I found was installing refit on the mac os x partition. So I did. I started up the efi boot loader from the Ubuntu disk using refit instead of holding down option on startup (needed to refresh a couple times for refit to see the dvd), same result. Another solution was booting with nomodeset. This time it didn't get stuck at the splash screen, but a completely black screen (no blinking cursor either) after being at the boot screen for a while. It could be a video driver problem, but how, if I've booted with nomodeset?\nI've also tried the \"64-bit mac\" version that they offer on the download page. That version doesn't have an efi version, only bios, but it boots exactly the same way (either stuck on the boot screen or a black screen).\nI don't want to try the 32-bit version as it could be much slower and also won't recognize my full 8gb of ram. (edit: tried it, still boots to a black screen)\n\n4/23 update: After commenting the answers I got, I should mention that on my macbook pro I have downgraded the efi firmware from 1.7 to 1.6 because I replaced the hard drive myself (the original one died), and the 1.7 update makes hard drives you replaced yourself become so slow they're unusable because they're \"unsupported\". For this reason I also can't install anything newer than mac os x mountain lion 10.8.3 on my mac, even if it would work normally (it would throw looping errors similar to the ones I mentioned in a comment), in fact I'm stuck on lion 10.7.5. The solution I found on the internet about this only works for seagate hard drives, and I have a western digital. \nIf I upgrade the efi firmware again, I could finally install Ubuntu, but it would be slowed down to a crawl (random hangs every 10 seconds or so), so it's not worth it. I'd rather just buy a new $300 non-apple laptop and put Ubuntu there. Thanks everyone who answered, but I'm open to trying something else to get it to work, if anyone has a potential solution.\n\n2017 update: I bought a newer computer, but I kept this older macbook as a secondary one. To make it faster, I replaced the hard drive again, this time to a SanDisk SSD plus, and despite it still being unsupported by Apple, it works perfectly with the old 1.6 EFI firmware. Not only does Ubuntu work fine, but so do newer Mac OS versions (up to 10.11 El Capitan officially, even 10.12 Sierra if you use dosdude1's patch). The old Apple EFI firmware caps the SATA speed at 1.5 Gbit/s, but with a solid state drive this computer works very quickly, so I won't attempt updating it. \n\nA: Have you tried replacing or pulling/pushing/checking the HDD cable?\nIt's a common failure in macbooks from around 2009.\nI've had 3 macbooks with this failure in my company (and there is not so much macbook there...)\nThe problem is exactly the same as you describe. Computer way sloooow, and some hangs. Ata errors also, due to timeouts in bus.\nThe easiest way to make sure if this is the problem is putting your internal HDD in an USB enclosure and boot. If computer is faster through USB (reasonabily faster) than through ATA, you found it. You have then to replace your internal ATA cable (try cleaning and reconecting first). ebay could be your friend here as it's not very cheap...\nAbout your problems due to WD disk instead of Seagate... I've never had any problem replacing macbook disks with any particular brand. In fact I'm used to buy WD and hitachi because they seemed to me that they last for long (But I've used samsung, toshiba...)\n\nA: I recommend adding Refit as it suggested. I have never found a workaround to using refit when dualbooting a macintosh computer. Install refit on your computer and restart the installation process.\nI recommend inserting the disk and then shutting down.\nUpon booting hold the option key and you should be able to select the ubuntu disk image.  Install as usual but make sure to do the proper partitioning.  I can link you if necessary to the instructions for partitions (it has been a while since i used a mac).  \nLet me know where that gets you (sorry I don't have the reputation to only commment, so I will try to guide you through the process)\n\nA: Unfortunately, Apple seems to delight in making changes to particular Mac models that require completely changing everything one needs to do to install anything but OS X on the computer. Chances are it's such model-specific issues that are causing you problems. You might have some luck with a Web search on \"Ubuntu\" and some variant of your model number. When I did this, I found these instructions -- but they apply to Ubuntu 10.04, so they may not be relevant for 14.04.\nYour symptoms are also quite similar to ones reported on many recent PCs. There's a huge question/answer set on this site devoted to this problem, so it's worth checking that out.\nIn some cases, it's necessary to install in BIOS mode to work around this type of problem, but I'd try sticking with an EFI-mode installation initially. This will enable you to avoid using the flaky and dangerous hybrid MBR that's required for a BIOS-mode boot on a Mac.\n\nA: I got the Ubuntu 14.04 installed on my Macbook Pro Mid 2009 (13\").\nWhat I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installed a rEFInd (http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/using.html);\n\n*Downloaded a Ubuntu 14.04 ISO (Normal 64bits ISO, not the +mac) and did a bootable usb drive;\n\n*Boot up the Mac, selected the usb (at the rEFInd screen), and started the installation.\n\n\nI think the problem is in the ISO with +mac.\n\nA: I was able to get 14.04 LTR installed on my Macbook Pro 5,3 last night. A few days ago I installed 12.04.4 LTR (64-bit Mac (AMD64) desktop CD) because I knew it would be fully supported. I did it from a USB drive using this method. In my case I didn't have an OSX installation so I booted an OSX Lion install disk and used the terminal there to convert and copy the Ubuntu installation to the USB drive as described in that guide. After having everything up and running I seen this guide on upgrading to 14.04 and decided to give it a whirl and to my surprise it actually worked. Hope this might help you in some way. \n\nA: Look for the usb repair tool from osx, can't remember the exactly, but you should find it. Erase the disk, and then install mavericks from appstore. (download).\nThat way i got mavericks on my 2009 whitemacbook 5,2.\nMaybe from the repair tool (disk repair?) you can make new partitions easier, and make one for ubuntu. Perhaps bios is the right version to boot? not sure\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 VLC has no interface I am on a fresh install of ubuntu TT 14.04, I installed the VLC-player. (tried via software center and console) \nThe problem is that when I try to run VLC the icon will appear in tray and dash, but no window opens up. Console says:\nmax@schleptop:~$ vlc\nVLC media player 2.1.5 Rincewind (revision2.1.2+git20140414+r54518+18+11~ubuntu14.04.1)\n[0x1fbd058] main libvlc: Running vlc with the default interface.

When i use 'super+s' short key, i noticed that i have dual screen and Vlc Player starts to work on the other screen. In the screen settings, i checked 'reflect screen' option. Now Vlc Player works normal. \n\nA: I was following sefaustun's suggestion, when I found a second \"unknown monitor\" in my screen settings; all I had to do was to switch it off and vlc got back working as usual. (I'm using ubuntu 14.04, the basis is the same as lubuntu, so it should work fine in your case too)\n\nA: I believe this is a bug. However, this happens to me whenever I try to use a skin in VLC Media Player. I select the skin file in VLC Media Player's settings, save, restart VLC Media Player, and then VLC Media Player appears in the tray and in the dash, but after about half a second it disappears almost as if it closed itself.\n\nA: In Software Updater ==> Settings ==> Additional Drivers try to use another graphic card driver.\nI don't know why, but for me worked very well.\nHope it will also work for you\nRegards!\n", "Q: Show CPU usage using a command I want to see CPU usage.\nI used this command :\ntop -bn1 | grep \"Cpu(s)\" | \n           sed \"s/.*, *\\([0-9.]*\\)%* id.*/\\1/\" | \n           awk '{print 100 - $1}'\n\nBut it returns 100%.\nWhat's the correct way?\n\nA: I found a solution which works nicely, here it is:\ntop -bn2 | grep '%Cpu' | tail -1 | grep -P  '(....|...) id,' \n\nI am not sure but it looks to me that the first iteration of top with the -n parameter returns some dummy data, always the same in all my tests.\nIf I use -n2 then the second frame is always dynamic.

I pass through purple screen, and then I get black screen with flashing white underscore on left hand side. Keyboard shortcuts are not working and the only way to get to desktop mode is booting into recovery mode (holding shift when booting etc.). In recovery mode I run:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia*\n\nand that is the only way to get a \"normal\" desktop environment. I put a quotes on a normal because computer is running slow and I can't set proper resolution.\nAlso, I've tried to install drivers via ubuntu GUI interface (proprietary, tested drivers), but with no luck.\nI am using Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: I've finally solved my problem!\nFor people who have the same problem like I had, here is the solution:\nI recommend to make a fresh install of your system, if you already have an issue with drivers.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot up Ubuntu and make sure you're connected on the internet.\n\n*Open a terminal with Ctrl + Alt + F1\n\n*Login and here is what you have to type in terminal:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\nsudo apt-get install linux-source\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo reboot\n\n\n*After reboot, repeat step 2. You'll need here an internet connection, again. Run these commands:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\nsudo reboot\n\nIt is very important to run nvidia-xconfig! If you don't run it, you'll crash your system!\nAfter you've done this, you'll have a working nVidia graphics driver. Cheers!\n\nA: I'm on a HP 8710p and upgraded to the nVidia drivers a while ago. Now I run into black screens during boot, seemingly randomly.\nDobroslav's accepted answer - reinstalling the nVidia drivers and recompiling the kernel - seemed to solve the problem at first, but later I ran into a black screen again.\nI searched around and found that this theory might explain the problem. Because twice in a row, things seemed to work directly after installing the new nVidia driver, but after the next reboot the black screen was back. Then on the next reboot, all was fine again. This would match with the theory that on reboot, the kernel module gets recompiled, but X already gets started before that happens, and so the module is not loaded - but on the next reboot it will already be compiled, and things work as normal.\nSo I found a workaround to the problem: whenever I get the black screen, I get rid of it by restarting X using these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal with Ctrl + Alt + F1\n\n*Login and type in terminal:\nps a | grep X\n\n\n*One of the lines will contain '/usr/bin/X' and start with a number, then 'tty7'. Eg. '2261 tty7'. Remember the number, which is the process id of the X server, and type:\nkill <number>\n\nIn my case, I then see an nVidia screen and directly after that I see the X login prompt come up. It's not a solution, but it's an acceptable workaround for me for now - at least I don't have to reboot or work with outdated drivers. I hope it helps someone else.\n\nA: I fumbled around with Nvidia drivers and this black screen issue for two days. And I fell into this pit because of the 14.04 upgrade from 12.04. Grrr!\nThe original issue I was trying to resolve was the high cpu utilization of firefox, compiz & Xorg which made the graphics fairly unusable. After attempting to resolve that issue by upgrading the Nvidia driver, all went south and the black screen of death ensued.\nHere's some commands that speak to my desktop configuration in case that helps...\n\"lshw\" command produces:\ndescription: Mini Tower Computer\nproduct: OptiPlex GX270\n\n\"lspci -vnn | grep -i VGA -A 12\" command produces:\nVGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation NV18 [GeForce4 MX 440 AGP 8x]\n\n\"wmctrl -m\" command produces:\nName: Metacity\nClass: N/A\nPID: N/A\nWindow manager's \"showing the desktop\" mode: N/A\n\nAt the end of the day, I'm not 100% sure what worked as I fumbled around so much. Here's what I think did it.\nUse the following to get rid of all Nvidia bits and rely on the default driver Nouveau.\nsudo apt-get purge \"nvidia *\"\n\nThen opt for using Metacity instead of Compiz. Those are the two salient changes I made and the result is a much improved graphics experience with acceptable cpu utilization when doing something such as video streaming from CNNx. Firefox still shows high cpu utilization in \"nice top\" but that doesn't seem to impact the graphics and especially the video streaming.\n\nA: Had the same issue and this is what worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*install synaptic\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n\n*within synaptic, find the latest Nvidia driver by typing \"nvidia\" then search and checking version number (in my case v331.38)\nnvidia-331-updates\n\n*after synaptic has done its thing, in a terminal:\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\nNow I get a perfect boot and am using driver v331.38, not the latest but the latest certified by canonical.\n\nA: The following thing worked for me.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\nsudo apt-get install linux-source\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: After trying many solutions and recommendations, I still was not able to resolve the black screen on boot issue. I will say though, 14.10 in-place upgrade resolves the problem. I have not done any more investigation, but this might mean that possibly updating the kernel version may fix it if you stay on 14.04.

Exactly as this bug but I'm using Unity not KDE: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kde-workspace/+bug/1243733\nApparently, no keyboard shortcuts work when assigned to the Print button. The button itself is working, as I can assign by pressing it.\n\nA: Ok, got it figured out.\nThe problem appears to be specific to some laptops (such as HP Pavillion dv6-6051er in my case) which use other keycodes for the Print button than the standard 107 which on desktops is both Print and Sys_Req.\nStart by xmodmap -pk | grep Print.\nIn my case, it returned:\n107     0xff61 (Print)  0xff15 (Sys_Req)    0xff61 (Print)  0xff15 (Sys_Req)    \n218     0xff61 (Print)  0x0000 (NoSymbol)   0xff61 (Print)  \n\nSo my Print button was 218 (yours can be different).\nWhat's needed now is to assign Sys_Req to 107 so that Print is only linked with 218.\nExecute xmodmap -e \"keycode 107 = Sys_Req\".\nTry to make a screenshot with Print. If fails, go System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Screenshots and re-assign the Print button to screenshots. Must be ok now.\nTo save the custom keyboard mapping, in the same session export current settings to an .Xmodmap config file, for example (saves in your home directory):\nxmodmap -pke > ~/.Xmodmap\n\n(Or you can just create an .Xmodmap file and only write the required tweak there, for example: keycode 107 = Sys_Req)\nA brief xmodmap manual is here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xmodmap\nThe last step. Launch Startup Applications in Dash and add the following command to auto-execute xmodmap on login:\nxmodmap /home/YOURUSERNAMEHERE/.Xmodmap\n\n(Make sure you write the full path; you can alternatively auto execute smth like xmodmap -e \"keycode 107 = Sys_Req\", too)\nOver.\nPS. using xmodmap in Unity is a bit of a hack as its native keyboard layout manager is xbk but it appears more difficult to tweak and documentation is lacking.\n", "Q: can't log into ubuntu after rsync restore of home folder I have recently reinstalled ubuntu/lubuntu 14.04 onto my wife's Packard Bell Dot S netbook after an unsuccessful upgrade from 12.04. I followed this by restoring the home directory from a backup using rsync. I used the \n\n--archive\n\noption which is supposed to keep permissions and ownership information. I can log onto my account but not hers. When I log on it immediately goes back to the login screen. I tried to change the ownership of all my wife's files in her home directory from my account but even this did not help. Why does this occur and how can I get to log into her profile. I must add that the install was successful as I could log into her account prior to the restore using rsync.\nI followed the exact same process for the install and restore on another computer and there is no problem.\n\nA: There is one file in particular to look at: ~/.Xauthority in her home directory.\nNote that its a hidden file.\nLog in to your account, go to her home directory and mv .Xauthority .old_Xauthority.\nLog out and have her log in.\nman xauth to learn more.\n\nA: I had the same problem on a Fedora system, but the root cause may apply to Ubuntu or other Debian systems depending on their configuration.\nAfter some analysis, I found a major possible cause: file contexts.\nIf you clone a home folder using rsync --archive, there are several things that do NOT get copied. Hard links, ACLs and XAttrs are mentioned in the help. File contexts are not copied either.\nBy default, all home folder entries are type user_home_t. Some hidden files like the .Xauthority have more restrictive types like xauth_home_t.\nHowever, the copy created by rsync will most likely be to a non-home folder and thus all the copied files will be labeled to the unlabeled_t type.\nThis means that, depending on the protection level in your system, even if the owner is set correctly (which the --archive option does), the files may be locked because of the file context.\nYou can verify this easily with this command:\nls /home//* -Zd\nThis will show the file contexts.\nFixing the file context should be easy.

I downloaded application which I did not add repository for (chrome or maxthon) and installed it via Software Center / dpkg (without adding the repo).\nDo those apps get updated automatically?\n\nA: Deb packages directly downloaded and manually installed will not usually get updated as most of the time they don't even exist in the Ubuntu repositories.\nHowever for Chrome, it's a bit different as during the package installation (even with a low-level package manager like dpkg -i) a new entry is created in /etc/apt/sources.list.d to set up the update process:\n$ cat google-chrome.list\n### THIS FILE IS AUTOMATICALLY CONFIGURED ###\n# You may comment out this entry, but any other modifications may be lost.\ndeb http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main\n\nFinally it only depends on the package itself but consider Chrome as an exception. \nUsually when I need to manually install deb packages using dpkg it's because it need to install new package versions on older releases and I know that they won't get any (backport) updates. It's rare and should be reserved for experienced users.\n", "Q: How can I show all non-minimized windows? I am running Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 with Unity.  It has some great keyboard combos for navigating about my various windows.  Super + W shows all open windows. Alt + Tab lets me scroll through applications.  Alt + ` lets me scroll through just the windows for a given application.  It's a great tool set when you have too many windows and not enough screen real estate.  However, what I'd really like is something like Super + W that excludes minimized windows.  Don't get me wrong, seeing the minimized windows is great sometimes, but sometimes they create screen clutter.\nI have some applications that I'd really like to just minimize to the tray (I know that's a Windows concept that I'm not sure translates entirely to Ubuntu, but bear with me) because I'm not actively using them.  I only have them running to get notifications (Geary email client, Skype, etc.), but they don't support sending to the tray, so I have them minimized.  That's more or less okay, but then I have 4 extra windows cluttering my screen when I Super + W.\nAnyone know a way to exclude these from Super + W?  Or make applications go to the tray and keep running when you close their window?\n\nA: I solved this by editing the window matching field in the CompizConfig Settings Manager. I don't think it's installed by default, but it's easy to find in Software Center. Once you have the Settings Manager, go to:\nWindow Management > Scale > Behaviour > Scale Windows\nThis field accepts a string that conforms to Compiz's WindowMatching syntax. You can edit it to declare which windows should be included when the Scale plugin activates. Here's the string I used to exclude minimized windows:\n(Toolbar | Utility | Dialog | Normal | Unknown) & !state=hidden\n\nA: Another option that seems to work for me, for the record, is to open Unity Tweak Tools (in the repository if you don't already have it) and go to the settings for the switcher, where there's an option to enable or disable switching between minimized windows. Unchecking that box appears to also affect the window spread. \n", "Q: OpenSSL remains vulnerable after update to 14.04 We have an AWS server running OpenVPN which was built using Ubuntu 13.10. After the announcement of the Heartbleed vulnerability, we updated the server. This morning, we upgraded the server to 14.04. The current output of \"openssl version -a\" is:\nOpenSSL 1.0.1f 6 Jan 2014 \nbuilt on: Mon Apr  7 21:22:23 UTC 2014 \nplatform: debian-amd64 \noptions:  bn(64,64) rc4(16x,int) des(idx,cisc,16,int) blowfish(idx)  \ncompiler: cc -fPIC -DOPENSSL_PIC -DOPENSSL_THREADS -D_REENTRANT -DDSO_DLFCN -DHAVE_DLFCN_H -m64 -DL_ENDIAN -DTERMIO -g -O2 -fstack-protector --param=ssp-buffer-size=4 -Wformat -Werror=format-security -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions -Wl,-z,relro -Wa,--noexecstack -Wall -DMD32_REG_T=int -DOPENSSL_IA32_SSE2 -DOPENSSL_BN_ASM_MONT -DOPENSSL_BN_ASM_MONT5 -DOPENSSL_BN_ASM_GF2m -DSHA1_ASM -DSHA256_ASM -DSHA512_ASM -DMD5_ASM -DAES_ASM -DVPAES_ASM -DBSAES_ASM -DWHIRLPOOL_ASM -DGHASH_ASM OPENSSLDIR: \"/usr/lib/ssl\"\n\nI verified the fact that the server is still vulnerable using the following:\n:~$ openssl s_client -connect openvpn.example.com:443 -tlsextdebug 2>&1| grep 'server extension \"heartbeat\" (id=15)' || echo safe\nTLS server extension \"heartbeat\" (id=15), len=1\n\nAttempts to run \"sudo apt-get install openssl\" return that the current version is already installed. What are the best options to resolve this issue? Does it appear there was a problem during distribution upgrade; i.e. is the 14.04 OpenSSL package actually outside the danger range? Or is there a possible issue with the repository itself?\n\nA: As @david6 pointed out, the version of OpenSSL might still appear to be a vulnerable version. This is because Ubuntu, as many other distros, backports security fixes rather than updating to a whole newer version of the software (and possibly picking up new features and their attendant bugs along the way). So, just because you're running a \"vulnerable version\" of OpenSSL doesn't mean you're running a vulnerable version of OpenSSL. \nHowever, if the available Heartbleed audits indicate you're still vulnerable, you're still vulnerable. \nWhat I think is going on is that you've updated the package, but you haven't restarted the services that use OpenSSL, so they are still holding on to the older version that they loaded at startup.\nThere are two easy ways to fix that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot the server.\n\n*Identify and restart the affected services. An easy way to do this is with, checkrestart from the debian-goodies package. It should identify the affected services and even tell you what init scripts will restart them:\n$ sudo apt-get install debian-goodies\n$ sudo checkrestart\n\n\nA: You are right to be concerned.\nHowever, to no longer be vulnerable to OpenSSL / Heartbleed on Ubuntu, you just need to be using an updated compile of the OpenSSL library.\nThe command openssl version -a should show that new date: 'built on: Mon Apr  7'\nActual examples:\n(1.) Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (64bit, desktop) - upgraded from 13.10\nOpenSSL 1.0.1f 6 Jan 2014\nbuilt on: Mon Apr  7 21:22:23 UTC 2014\nplatform: debian-amd64\n  :\n\n(2.) Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (64bit, desktop) - NEW install\nOpenSSL 1.0.1f 6 Jan 2014\nbuilt on: Mon Apr  7 21:22:23 UTC 2014\nplatform: debian-amd64\n  :\n\n(3.) Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (64bit, server) - fully updated\nOpenSSL 1.0.1 14 Mar 2012\nbuilt on: Mon Apr  7 20:33:29 UTC 2014\nplatform: debian-amd64\n  :\n\nNOTE:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu maintainer have a lengthy testing cycle before they will 'replace' a library with a brand new version (with differing features). The simple fix for this bug was to either add bounds-checking logic (for the heartbeat function) or to compile with a flag (pragma) to exclude the heartbeat functionality entirely. These two options will not adversely impact any other applications or services.\n\n*If you had installed a version of OpenSSL v1.0.1 (or v1.0.2 beta) from source, or download a binary (for Ubuntu) from somewhere, then you would indeed be vulnerable unless you were using v1.0.1g (or the compile option had been used to remove 'heartbeat'). Only use trusted sources.\n\nA: Upgrade to the latest and you'll be okay if you are running on Ubuntu for CVE-2016-2107:  see https://forums.openvpn.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=21699&p=62376#p62376\nIf you dpkg the current openvpn_as server you can see it's updated for openssl past the bug:\njonathan@Jonathan-Les-MacBook-Pro:~/Downloads/openvpn/usr/local/openvpn_as/lib/pkgconfig$ cat openssl.pc\nprefix=/usr/local/openvpn_as\nexec_prefix=$\n{prefix}\nlibdir=${exec_prefix}/lib64\nincludedir=${prefix}\n/include\nName: OpenSSL\nDescription: Secure Sockets Layer and cryptography libraries and tools\nVersion: 1.0.2h\nRequires: libssl libcrypto\n\nFor CVE-2016-2107 in https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160503.txt:\n\"OpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2h\"\nWe upgraded to the latest and are A-OK now\n", "Q: Screen truns off when I lock, but doesn't lock. \"Lock\" settings grayed out I'm on trusty and I can't lock my computer by any means.

I've got external audio card Audiotrak Maya U5. It always worked fine until new Ubuntu. Music randomly get muted and there's no visible changes in sound settings or anything.\nI mean, it even doesn't look like it's muted, the sound just doesn't work. What I have to do then is to close the music player, wait a minute and run it again to get my sound back.\nWhat could be the problem? Thx a lot!\nPS sry for my poor english.\n\nA: I just had the same problem. Pulseaudio tries to be smart and mute music when you get a phone call - but you know what happens when programs try to be smart.\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit this file as root: /etc/pulse/default.pa\n\n*Find these two lines:\n###Cork music/video streams when a phone stream is active\nload-module module-role-cork\n\n*Comment out the load-module:\n#load-module module-role-cork\n\n*Stop pulseaudio with pulseaudio -k, then start it again.\nYou may have to restart your audio applications, but it should stop muting your music.

Thanks.\n\nA: I was able to get this working. I had similar errors as you using Workstation 9.0.2. I then installed 9.0.3, and the only module that failed to build was Virtual ethernet. I then used the patch for the vmnet module found here: VMware modules & kernel 3.13\nIt is intended for Workstation 10, but it also worked for me using 9.0.3. I actually used the patch linked near the bottom of the page: vmware 3.13. The patching actually failed (I'm not sure why, I didn't dig into it) but I was able to manually make the changes from the patch and that worked fine.\n\nA: I can confirm that this patch though it refers to VMWare Player, worked for me with VMWare Workstation 9.0.3 on Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit.

I got it to work with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS a few weeks before the official release date. After updating on April 17th I can no longer get it to work:\nORIGINAL POST:\nI installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS a few weeks before the official release and set up multiple google chromium profiles. Using \"StartupWMClass\", I managed to get each profile to have a separate version of the chromium icon in the unity launcher (same icon, separate appearance in the launcher). After the official release of 14.04 I updated all packages (including chromium) and ever since my additional chromium profiles no longer get their own icon location on the launcher, but group together with the main chromium icon.\nhere's what I believe to be the essentials of my setup:\n\n\n*\n\n*Under ~/.local/share/applications/ I have my *.desktop files, containing among others the lines\n\n*\n\n*Exec=chromium-browser --user-data-dir=/home/<mydir>/.config/chromium/Profiles/<profile-name> --class=<profile-class-name> %U\n\n*StartupWMClass=<profile-class-name>\n\n\n*Under /usr/share/applications/ I have the default chromium-browser.desktop file created upon installing chromium, containing among others the lines\n\n*\n\n*Exec=chromium-browser --class=Chromium-browser %U\n\n*StartupWMClass=Chromium-browser\nAdding --class=Chromium-browser to the Exec= line of the default installation .desktop file used to do the trick so that each profile including the default profile would be associated with their own icon on the launcher. After the update I am no longer able to get this to work. \nI tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*closing all chromium windows, \n\n*unlocking from launcher any remaining chromium icons, \n\n*using the unity search to start the default Chromium Web Browser, \n\n*locking the appearing icon to the launcher\n\n*using the unity search to start an additional, custom Chromium profile\n\n*--> the window of the additional chromium profile is associated with the the icon started for the default chromium profile. They use the same launcher icon.\n\n\nI tried restarting compiz, logging out and even restarting my computer.\nAny tips on what I might be missing?\np.s. One thing that confuses me is that the launcher I created for Google Calendar with File -> Create application shortcuts... works as expected (uses it's own, different icon), and doesn't even make use of the --class=<profile> argument I thought was necessary...\n\nA: I came up with this abomination (personal opinion...

I just recently installed Ubuntu 13.10 alongside Windows 7 and aside from having to tweak the nomodest setting from the Ubuntu setup screen, the installation was smooth.

In Windows 7 I can browse the web fine, just not in Ubuntu. Any ideas as to how I can fix this? Thanks in advance!!\n\nA: You might have to install the driver from Realtek in order to make it work. Some network adapters have special functions or configurations that require the OS to use a specific driver (like for extra frequency ranges).\nIn the case of your network adapter, Realtek provides a driver for Linux-based operating systems like Ubuntu; and since you are using version 13.10, you need to download the version for Linux kernels above 2.6.24 from this page: http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&PFid=48&Level=5&Conn=4&ProdID=272&DownTypeID=3&GetDown=false&Downloads=true#RTL8188CE\n(It jumps to your adapter automatically, but it takes a few seconds for the page to load completly)\n", "Q: Accidentally deleted all my partitions after Ubuntu 14.04 installation I had a serious problem during my Ubuntu 14.04 installation. I had a Windows 7 partition and a separate partition to install Ubuntu, where I already had Ubuntu 12.04 installed. \nDuring the Ubuntu installation, I was asked if I wanted to either \"Upgrade Ubuntu\" or install it fresh new. When I chose to install it (which would delete the existing Linux installation along with all its files), I thought it would delete files only on the existing linux partition. However, for my surprise, it deleted all the existing partitions and created a single one for the new Linux install.\nI had some backup of my data, but some very important documents were lost due to this repartitioning and formatting of my hard drive.\nI know that there was a way to avoid this during installation, but it did not seem very intuitive to me. In previous versions it was easier to install Ubuntu alongside with Windows without risking all my data.\nSo, what I want to know is... Is there a way to recover my data, even if the partition has been deleted and reformatted? The partition I want to recover data from was NTFS.\nI am aware that I may not be able to recover everything, but I want to try to recover as much data as I can. I read testdisk might be useful... but I don't know how it could be used in recovering files from a partition that has already been formatted.\n\nA: testdisk is a great tool.

Compiz in earlier versions of Ubuntu took around 60-65 MB of RAM.\nIn Ubuntu 14.04, it is taking around 205-201 MB.\nAnd Nautilus took 35 MB of RAM in earlier versions, it is taking a minimum of 65 MB.\nMy total RAM usage since 13.10 was around 500-600 MB.\nIt has been increased to 1.2 GB of usage since the installation of 14.04\n\nA: I believe I just had the same problem and have now resolved it for myself. I believe that this issue is swap related.\nI have also recently reinstalled 14.04 on whole disk and was previously using 13.10 successfully and well. I too noticed my that my ram was mostly staying around 1.2GB of use, just as stated in the person's question. I strongly suspect that the person probably used whole disk encryption which is a part of the Ubuntu install which likely caused this issue.\nMy symptoms were that occasionally Ubuntu would become almost complete unresponsive even with a typical light amount of open programs and activity, which had been performing acceptably on my old Ubuntu install. At first I thought it was Firefox or Software Center related.\nDell Optiplex 780 (small form factor/sff)\nPentium(R) Dual-Core CPU E5300 @ 2.60GHz × 2\nMemory 2GB (plan on upgrading to 8 or more very soon)\nVideo Intel® Q45/Q43\nI noticed in the System Monitor program, that in the resources tab it showed swap as \"not available\" (or something along those lines). This was a fresh install of 14.04. I used whole disk encryption, and decided it was probably related to that. I checked for the existence of my swap partition in the Disks program, and saw that the swap partition did exist at least and seemed appropriate. It was called: /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-swap_1 which is correct.\nI also confirmed it's existence in terminal with:\nsudo fdisk -a\n\nI did some googling and decided it may not have been activated as swap, even though the space was created, so I deactivated swap:\nsudo swapoff -a\n\nThen I told it to recognize that space as swap:\nsudo mkswap /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-swap_1\n\nThen I turned swap on:\nsudo swapon -a\n\nI then received a message about cryptsetup swap blah blah blah, which is appropriate, but I did NOT receive a message regarding /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-swap_1, despite having received one before I did these steps.\nI reopened System Monitor and saw that it does indeed now recognize and use my swap space.

I've upgraded Xubuntu in the past with no issues, but when upgrading last night from 13.10 to 14.04, I found myself stuck at the grub rescue prompt. Given that I haven't encountered this issue before, I decided to try the Boot Repair utility as is detailed here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair. I needed to go with the \"2nd option\" noted on that help page, because I had no way to create a Boot Repair CD. \nHere's what I did exactly:\nOn my laptop I went to xubuntu dot org where I downloaded the Live Xubuntu ISO. If you have a writeable disc drive, I'm sure you can create a LiveCD with this ISO file (presumably you could create a Boot Repair CD, too), but my laptop has no optical drive.\nSo, I then created a bootable LiveUSB of Xubuntu 14.04. The instructions I followed to create the LiveUSB can be found here: http://blog.tinned-software.net/create-bootable-usb-stick-from-iso-in-mac-os-x/ (keeping in mind my laptop's Mac OS required the \"sudo\" command to write to the formatted USB, as detailed in the comments of that post).\nWith the finished LiveUSB of Xubuntu in hand, I rebooted the grub error computer, changing the boot menu to recognize the LiveUSB, which loaded the Xubuntu Live.\nI chose \"Try Xubuntu\" when the LiveUSB asked me to try or install. This loaded a Xubuntu session showing all my partitions as desktop icons.\nI opened a terminal and ran the following as detailed in the above-linked Boot Repair help page:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo sed 's/trusty/saucy/g' -i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yannubuntu-boot-repair-trusty.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\nI followed the instructions in the Boot Repair utility, which were fairly self-explanatory. Boot Repair recognized my partitions and ran its process, but finished with an \"error\" Ubuntu Pastebin address. I copied that down, but it seemed that the error was linked to extra drives on the machine that have no OS. Regardless of the error, Boot Repair still gave the option to reboot, so I did.\nI obviously made sure my boot menu pointed to the correct drive, and voila! Grub recognized all my partitions again as it was supposed to. I loaded up Xubuntu, and it looks like 14.04 runs just as it should now that the Boot Repair has done its work. Additionally, I can load Windows 8.1 just fine. \nHopefully my notes are of some usefulness. I'm grateful for Boot Repair and for all the dedicated troubleshooters out there! \n\nA: First boot from live ubuntu cd or Live ubuntu flash drive and connect to internet. After that go to termianl by ctlr+alt+T and just use the command below,\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo sed 's/trusty/saucy/g' -i /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yannubuntu-boot-repair-trusty.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\nThis actually fix any problems I have with boot.

The first try got the same crash result - but then I entered the BIOS Setup Utility, accessed the \"Advanced\" screen, and changed the \"Init. Graphic Adapter Priority\" from having Onboard in the last place to have it on the first place.  This way there are no glitches, the nVIDIA monitor is left without image, but the VGA monitor displays the desktop all right.  So, it is a problem strictly related to nVIDIA GeForce FX 5500 drivers.

I just performed a clean install (not an upgrade) to Ubuntu 14.04 (64-bit, PC desktop ISO) on a PC that previously had Ubuntu 12.04 installed. Upon trying to restore my \\home directory from a Samba server via Deja Dup, I got the error message:\nRestore Failed: Software caused connection abort\nFurther investigation lead me to find that this is just a symptom of a larger problem. On my home network I have three Samba servers. Any attempt to use Nautilus to copy and paste any content between shared folders on those machines and local folders results in the same error message.\nThere have been two other threads exploring this same error message, plus one additional post with no replies.\nThe first thread - limited to SSH problems - was resolved by eliminating redundant IPs on the network. That is not my problem. It's a small home network, all IPs are accounted for. And this problem began immediately upon installation of Trusty Tahr. Minutes before it all worked well under Precise Pangolin. Also, my router reserves IPs by MAC address, so though I'm using DHCP on my Trusty PC, it's getting the same IP. No conflicts there. Finally, I reinstalled 12.04 as a test, and the problem went away. So IMO it's not an IP problem.\nThe other thread deals with file access issues. To test that possible problem I created a new local folder and chmod'ed 777 permission to myself. Then attempting to copy files between that folder and the SMB servers, I got the same error.

Try a live boot from CD or USB and see if it runs smoothly; if so, it will run better when fully installed.\nIf it is too slow, then try Xubuntu or Lubuntu, or better yet just stick with Ubuntu 12.04 as it still has several years of support left.  Honestly 14.04 isn't that much different than 12.04, so you will not be gaining much by pushing your system to run the newest releases.  \nYou might want to wait a few weeks (or months) for all the bugs in 14.04 to be worked out anyway.  \n\nA: Yes, that will install and run just fine, barring any other issues such as a weird graphics device. I've run Ubuntu on far, far less powerful computers. \n", "Q: Installing SOGOU 搜狗拼音 SOGOU (搜狗) is a popular Chinese input software.

I wonder, isn't still there  an easy way to create a desktop shortcut in Ubuntu 14.04 (or Unity)? There is no context menu on desktop doing this. \nSo I tried the following: I looked for an app I want to create a shortcut for in the dash, then I tried to drag it to the desktop. And guess what? I got the error: \n\n\nA: The above answers all assume that the desktop file is in /usr/share/applications, but sometimes it is not the case. So I posted my answer in case these answers do not work.\nUsually when running the application or package you have installed, the icon of the application will appear in the launcher. That is to say, ubuntu has already automatically created a desktop file for the application. All you need to do is to find it and copy it to the desktop. More often than not it is in /usr/share/applications, as assumed by all other answers to this question, but sometimes it is in ~/.local/share/applications, or elsewhere you have no idea about. In the following I will add an icon for Qt Creator which is not in /usr/share/applications by default to the desktop to illustrate this method.\n(1) After installation of Qt, run Qt Creator.\n(2) Locate the path to the executable. This can be done by search the list of System Monitor in the Processes tab for the particular process for that application and view the process property.\n(3) Record the path, say, /home/zh/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/bin/qtcreator for Qt Creator. Search the disk for desktop file containing this path using command sudo find / -name \"*.desktop\"|xargs grep /home/zh/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/bin/qtcreator. You will get \"/home/zh/.local/share/applications/DigiaQt-qtcreator-community.desktop\".\n(4) Copy that desktop file to ~/Desktop, then you are all set.\n\nA: *\n\n*Right click the file you want a link to in your file manager.\n\n*Select \"Create link\" from the context menu.\n\n*Move that link wherever you want it. \n\n\nIn the case of application launchers, they're placed in /usr/share/applications/. The procedure is identical. We have several shortcut editor applications if you want advanced functionality, but I suspect the method above should suffice? \nWhen we discover bugs in Ubuntu and we would like them to be fixed, we report them to the developers. This is done on http://Launchpad.net. \n\nA: Try to press Ctrl and Shift (I have used left ones) together when drag'n'dropping app or folder to desktop ;-)\n\nA: I find this works:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Nautilus\n\n*Navigate to /usr/share/applications\n\n*Right-click on the application you want to use and select copy\n\n*Click on your desktop and select paste\n\n*Right click on the icon that has just been created and select properties\n\n*On the Permissions tab check Execute then click Close\n\n\nDone!\n\nA: An totally non-obvious way to create a shortcut anyway:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Nautilus, navigate to \"Computer\" (or press  ctrl+L, type / in the address bar and press Enter).\n\n*Open the folder usr.\n\n*Open the folder share.\n\n*Open the folder applications.\n\n*In that folder, select the program of your choice (for example, Gimp). Drag it to your desktop folder (in Nautilus) or copy & paste it.\n\n*Profit from a desktop shortcut. Since you made a plain copy of the application launcher, it may break in a future update. If you cannot immediately find the program in /usr/share/applications, look in subdirectories or ~/.local/share/applications/.\n\n\n\nIt is ridiculous how involved the steps are just to get a desktop icon for an application. The following approaches were tried and did not work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Drag from Dash to desktop: throws an error.\n\n*Right-click on the icon in the Dash: opens a second information canvas, but still no option to create an icon.\n\n*Start the program, right-click in the launcher: still no option to create a canvas.\n\n*Open the \"Desktop\" folder in Nautilus (located in the Home directory), drag the program from the Dash to the file browser to the desktop: same error as dragging from the dash to the desktop.\n\n\nI am a KDE user, but recommended a peer student to try Ubuntu (with Unity). Hopefully this is the last surprise, but I have my reservations about that.\n\nA: I was facing the same problem but mine was matlab app. This is how I did it.\n\n\n*\n\n*open nautilus and click on computer\n\n*copy /usr/share/app-install/\"application name\" \n\n*paste it to your desktop\n\n*right-click it and go to properties and click on the permissions tab and check Allow executing file as program.\n\n\nNOTE: replace application name with the of the application you installed.\nhope this helps.\n\nA: I like this procedure: Desktop shortcut to create a new desktop shortcut doesn't do anything\nShort answer:\nsudo apt install --no-install-recommends gnome-panel\ngnome-desktop-item-edit ~/Desktop/ --create-new\n\nthen put your name and command in dialog to create on desktop your brand new launcher!!\np.s.: first command is not necessary if you already have gnome-desktop-item-edit\np.s.2.: other answers created software links and/or copied files as .desktop files, this approach will create a brand-new .desktop file\n\nA: You can navigate to \n/usr/share/applications \nwith Terminal then enter \nsudo nautilus .\n\nIt will open a file explorer with admin right.

A simple sudo apt-get install dh-make should fix the issue.\nHow to know:\nchmod 744 debian/pxpress/switch*\ndh build\nmake: dh: Command not found\nmake: *** [build-arch] Error 127\ndpkg-buildpackage: error: debian/rules build gave error exit status 2\n\ndh build starts creating a debian package with the debhelper scripts, all these scripts are appended with the dh_ string. In this case, dh called a helper called dh_make to build the debian package.\nAnother cue you have is this line:\ndpkg-checkbuilddeps: Unmet build dependencies: debhelper (>= 7) dh-modaliases execstack\n\nYou need debhelper, dh-modaliases and execstack to build the package. debhelper suggests dh-make, and suggestions are normally installed.\n\nA: \nInstall your driver though  Software center.\n\nUbuntu software center > Edit menu > Software sources > Additional Drivers\n\nOR\nrun these commands in your Terminal:\n\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-generic\nsudo apt-get install fglrx\n\nThen you will be able to use Catalyst Control Center.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty doesn't utilize hot corners after rebooting Everytime I reboot, I've to turn off and on hotcorners from unity-tweak-tool.

Should I remove all but the Ubuntu desktops and the KDE desktop which I prefer?  If so, how do I handle any shared applications such as the VLC media player?  \n\nA: No, there's no need to do that. Having more desktops installed means you'll get slightly more updates to download. You'll also get more apps than you need that will appear in menus, but if you don't find that particularly annoying, there's really no need to. \nI have at least five desktops installed and I switch between them all the time. Apps are completely independent on the desktop. You don't even need to have a desktop installed in order to use VLC, for instance although that'd be slightly uncomfortable in most cases. :)\nIn fact, from time to time, I've mixed elements from different desktops at the same time, such as in this case, where I run Unity with two monitors and added a panel from Xfce on my second monitor (the bottom panel). That's fine. \n\n", "Q: remove 12.04 which installed by wubi and install 14.04 I have windows seven also I installed Ubuntu 12.04 with Wubi. I haven't had any problem with my 12.04. Now I downloaded 14.04 32 bit and I make my flash boot able with this guide also I uninstall my 12.04 from add or remove program !! (...Wubi make this ability ) Now what next? When I start my computer still I see grub (But I think I should not see that because I uninstall that from win 7 ) also what I should do with my boot able flash- which I installed 14.04 on that- in order to install that. Note My aim is to format windows 7 and 12.04 and just have 14.04 on my computer.\n\nA: Solution:\n1) Back up your data\n2) Place Ubuntu 14.04 on flash drive, hard disk, cd, etc using unetbootin or YUMI\n   (preferrably YUMI)\n3) Select your device from boot menu\n4) Run and select \"Install Ubuntu\"\n5) Select \"Erase disk and install Ubuntu\"\n\nA: or you can also upgrade it to 14.04 \nfirst upgrade to 13.04 than 13.10\nafter tat you would be able to upgrade it 14.04 \n", "Q: How do I get rid of this Anthy toolbar? I toggle between writing in Japanese and English on my computer, usitng Anthy and iBus. I just recently installed Ubuntu 14.04 on two computers, and set up my language input options the same as I have for years, and for the most part it works fine and I have all the functionality I wan\nThe only problem is that on one of the computers, my laptop, whenever I switch to Anthy to input Japanese, this floating toolbar pops up just under where I'm typing'\n\nI can' find any option for getting rid of this thing. It doesn't show up on my desktop computer, so I know it doesn't have to be there for Anthy to work.\nHow do I get rid of this toolbar?\n\nA: Go to Setup - IBus-Anthy either via the third button on the bar you want to get rid of, or via Dash > Text Entry > [single click] Japanese Anthy > [click on settings bottom right].\nYou can choose what parts of the menu should display next to your cursor, when Anthy is active, in the settings's General tab under Menu visibility on Status Icon. Uncheck all boxes (in your case Input mode, Dictionary mode, Preferences - Anthy) and the menu should disappear.\n\nA: If you go to System Settings -> Text Entry and select Anthy, you can click the toolkit icon to reach the Anthy Setup dialog. Possibly (I don't really know) it includes a way to disable it.\n\nA: The currently accepted answer (Earthliŋ's) is not correct - or at least not accurate anymore in 2017.\nWhether or not the popup (misleadingly called the \"property panel\" by IBus) appears is not controlled by IBus-Anthy but IBus itself. The Menu visibility on Status Icon checkboxes in IBus-Anthy only controls what appears on the popup. Unchecking them all creates a zero-width popup, that seems to have the unfortunate side effect of breaking keyboard input conversion (e.g., zenkaku/henkaku) altogether.\nThe actual solution to OP's problem is simply to open IBus Preferences (right-click on the IBus task bar panel icon), and at Show property panel: to select the Do not show dropdown option.\n", "Q: kdeconnect not working in Ubuntu 14.04 kde-connect is available to install from software center in Ubuntu 14.04\n \nbut it's not showing up in the menu or search.

Both computers and both operating systems work fine with Bluetooth linking to a Bose mini soundlink speaker for playing music.  I use a USB bluetooth dongle for the link and all works well.\nHowever, with a much newer laptop, a Toshiba Satellite Pro C50-A-1K9 running the 64 bit version of Ubuntu 14.04 LTE I cannot get bluetooth to work despite using the same dongle and the same speaker.  The first time it finds the device, attempts to pair, but asks that a particular 4 digit code be entered from the device.  This is of course impossible as the Bose mini soundlink speaker does not have a keypad!  Further attempts to search for bluetooth devices after this first time find nothing.  If I then go back to the old notepad computers they also cannot find the device at all with either Windows or Ubuntu 14.04 32 bit.  I strongly suspect that the 64 bit version of Ubuntu 14.04 LTE has sent a code to the speaker which prevents it linking via bluetooth thereafter.\nIf anyone else has the Bose mini soundlink speaker and needs to overcome this problem, then\n\n\n*\n\n*perform a factory reset on the speaker by first turning it on then holding down the bluetooth button for about ten seconds when the speaker beeps and will now work again with the old computers and windows 7 or Ubuntu 14.04 LTE 32 bit.\n\n*avoid using bluetooth with Ubuntu 14.04 LTE 64 bit version until such time as a very skilled programmer finds the bug!\n\n\nA: There is an issue with USB 3.0(xhci) and the Atheros bluetooth devices.

I've tried a number of different methods, but they all seem to fail in some way or another.\nFirst of all, I don't have a native Ubuntu computer; I have a netbook with 1gb of memory that I can boot in to Lubuntu from a live CD, as well as a Windows PC. I don't want a live installation of some sort; I want it to act like a normal installation, just it should be completely independent of it's host. I was thinking of trying to run a VM using the drive as it's hard drive and installing it like that, but the Lubuntu-able netbook doesn't have enough memory. My PC could do it, but I usually use Hyper-V for virtualization, and from what I remember I could never get it to register a USB drive in the VM.\nBasically, is there a way to install Lubuntu to a specific drive and make sure it doesn't touch any other devices? If not, what's the best way to accomplish this with the equipment that I have available?\n\nA: The easiest way to install Lubuntu on any USB pendrive is to boot your Lubuntu Live CD/DVD, enter the live session, and use the Installer icon present on the desktop. Make sure first that your Internet connection is up and running.\nAfter you get to the window with the 3 options for installing Ubuntu/Lubuntu, choose the 3rd one which says Something else. This way you'll be able to access the partition table for both your hard disk and the USB pendrive. Choose the medium where you want to install Lubuntu, which of course has to be the USB device, and after that delete your entire USB partition if you haven't done it already.\nNext you should create 2 new partitions on the USB pendrive: the first one will be the root partition formatted as linux ext4 with foreslash / as startup or mounting point, and the second one has to be a small Linux swap partition (around 1-2 GB in size). After you are finished with partitioning the USB select the root partition and press NEXT to start installing Lubuntu on the USB pendrive. DO not leave any free space on your pendrive, be it raw free space or fat32 formatted free space!!!\nMost important thing is to choose to install the bootloader on your USB and not on your HDD device. While still facing the partition table for your USB, select from the drop-down menu at the bottom of window to place bootloader on the USB pendrive. Make sure you select the entire USB and not your new root partition for installing the bootloader / grub. This way your new bootable Lubuntu usb pendrive will be 'completely independent of it's host'.\nI strongly recommend you download and burn on a CD/DVD Lubuntu 12.04.4 LTS iso image or Lubuntu 13.10 because lots of users have experienced nasty errors when trying to install this new Ubuntu 14.04 and all its derivatives, Lubuntu 14.04 included.\nOn a last note, to be able to boot from USB you have to either change your BIOS settings to do so or you can just press your default BIOS key for the boot menu (which is usually F12) and select to boot from the USB pendrive. I prefer to press F12 to get to the boot menu because I find it more convenient for me.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 installer not detecting Windows 7 I already have four primary partitions I recently downloaded Ubuntu 14.04 Trust Tahr and created a bootable USB stick with the .iso image on it. When I choose the USB stick as the boot device it takes me to the Ubuntu installer GUI. However, once it gets to the actual installation step, it says \"This computer currently has no detected operating system\" So I did some searching around and only found some questions that had complicated answers about partitions, etc. Partitions are new to me, and I only have a basic understanding of them.\nSo could someone please provide a fairly simple answer? I'd really appreciate it. I've been looking forward to getting Ubuntu for a long time and am anxious to get this working. Thanks!\n\nA: you may have too many partitions..  Windows 7 'Disk Management' utility is somewhat lacking in its ability to create partitions.\nMore specifically it will insist on creating 'Primary' partitions and after creating the 4th primary partition it will only allow 'Dynamic' volumes to be created.\nHowever the total number of partitions that can be accessed by Windows 7 is limited only by the number of available drive letters (C to Z) after subtracting the drive letters used by one or more CD/DVD/Blue Ray drives. You must also keep at least one free drive letter available for and external USB drive or flash drive.\nAny partitions that do not have a drive letter assigned will be hidden from Windows Explorer.\nIf you create an 'Extended' partition the you can create addtitional 'Logical drives' however a third perty disk management utility may be the best solution for accomplishing this.\n", "Q: Lubuntu 14.04 cannot try Lubuntu without installing-error messages I have Lubuntu 13.10 installed. Works great. I downloaded Lubuntu 14.04 and burned to disc.\nTo test I tried the option to try Lubuntu without installing.\nI got several error messages which I did not understand.\nThe first error message contained the following:\n\"Kernel Panic-not syncing\"\nThere were other error messages that followed plus a lot of codes.\nThen the last error message contained the following:\n\"drm_kms_helper: panic occurred  switching back to text console\"\nI had to cold reboot. Nothing worked. Computer completely froze including t\nhe keyboard, mouse and I could not even eject the disc until the cold reboot.\nThis did not happen with 13.10 which installed smoothly with no problems 6 months ago.\nSounds to me like a kernel problem although I would think it would work just to try Lubuntu without installing. I remember trying a pre-release Kubuntu 14.04 and I was able to try it without installing just fine.\nIs there a fix or should I attempt to download the image again and re-burn to disc.\nPlease advise if possible. I was very suprised it did not work considering Lubuntu 13.10 and a pre-release Kubuntu 14.04 worked.\nThank you in advance for any assistance.\n\nA: After you downloaded Lubuntu 14.04 did you perform an MD5Sum?\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM\nThe hashes have to match and perhaps yours don't.  If they do not, download the ISO again.\n", "Q: How to install Juniper VPN on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS? Could you please help me ?\nOn my old Ubuntu 13.10 I was able to run Juniper VPN (on Firefox only) using a workaround which requires you to install the missing 32libs and IcedTea (32bits).\nHowever, I recently upgraded from Ubuntu 13.10 to 14.04 (both 64 bits) and my Juniper VPN does not work anymore because it fails during startup showing the following message:\n\"Please ensure that necessary 32 bit libraries are installed. For more details, refer KB article KB25230\"\n\"Setup failed. Please install 32 bit Java and update alternatives links using update-alternatives command. For more details, refer KB article KB25230\"\nFor some odd reason, it seems the 14.04 upgrade do not work anymore with the openjdk-7:386 and consequently the Juniper VPN as well.\nAny ideas ?\nThanks\n\nA: I just set up a VPN connect to juniper using MadScientist's msjnc script that wraps around a binary (ncsvc) from the juniper linux client .jar \nThe ncsvc binary does not require java at all, so this is somewhat the neatest solution I could find.\nThe script can be found here:\nhttp://mad-scientist.us/juniper.html\n\nA: You could try the suggestion in this post: Juniper setup on 12.04\nUpdate for 14.04 Trusty Tahr (64-bit)\nFirst run with Network Connect on 14.04 resulted a failure and Network Connect just complained about missing 32-bit libraries. My NC version is 7.4R6. I did have all the libraries installed and openjdk-7-jre:i386 installed.\nDigging a little bit deeper revealed that Network Connect is using update-alternatives listing to decide if 32-bit jre is installed.\n/usr/sbin/alternatives command not found\nCommand = /bin/sh -c /usr/sbin/update-alternatives --display java 2>&1 | grep -v \"/bin/sh:\" | grep ^/ | cut -d \" \" -f 1 | tr \" \" \" \"\n\nHowever it's looking update-alternatives from /usr/sbin/ and there seems to be no symlink pointing to the right directory like 13.10 had. So adding symlink to /usr/sbin/ helped.\n$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/update-alternatives /usr/sbin/\n\nJust for completeness, as well as having to install a 32-bit JRE, I also had to follow the info here: http://itfuzz.blogspot.de/2013/11/juniper-network-connect-and-ubuntu-1310.html and run this command on 14.04:\nsudo apt-get install libstdc++6:i386 lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0 libxext6:i386 libxrender1:i386 libxtst6:i386 libxi6:i386\n\nI must already have done this on 13.10 as it worked then, but on 14.04 the Network Connect window just closed. This fixed the problem.\n\nA: Due to some wrong upgrades, I couldn't launch vpn.

This release includes a new light-locker, a great improvement if you ask me. The thing is that whenever I try to lock the session or when it locks automatically after some time, it stops (or pause) playback of music, for instance (I have just noticed this while having some music played in the background on youtube). \nWhen I unlock the session it resumes playing instantly. I've looked for some options in the settings, but didn't see any. Also, I found this bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/light-locker/+bug/1296456 which if I understand correctly fixes this situation in version 1.4.0. Sadly, this is the version xubuntu 14.04 ships with, but the problem still exists. What should I do ? \n\nA: I had the same issue. I went to the Light Locker Settings and in \"Automatically lock the session\" I changed it to \"When the screensaver is deactivated\". Music is now still playing when the screen goes blank. Seems though that it now takes longer to return to the lock screen.\nUPDATE: Seems like I need to do two touches/keystrokes to activate the lock screen. When I click the mouse once, the musics stops, and it needs one keystroke more before the Light Locker appears. Annoying.\n\nA: Here is what xubuntu.org has to say about this:\n\n[...]\nCurrently, when locking, it is assumed you are either:\n\n*\n\n*in a public space of sorts (the desktop at home hardly needs locking) and have walked away from the machine\n\n*using a system with more than one user\n\nStopping/pausing playback in both of these scenarios make sense.\nHowever, this might be an annoying change for users used to having\ntheir music playback continue even when their session locks. If you\ndon’t like this behavior, there are basically two solutions:\n\n*\n\n*Set light-locker to lock the session “When the screensaver is deactivated”\n\n*Switch back to using xscreensaver\n\n*Add your user to the audio group on your computer and  music playback will continue also with light-locker\n\nThe first option is a good workaround, because it means that your\naudio-playback will continue when the screen has been blanked.\nHowever, when you wake up your computer, e.g. by touching the mouse,\nit will pause the music until you log into your session again. The\nthird solution is mentioned last, because it is not advised to add a\nuser to the audio group (read The Audio Group wiki page for a\ncomprehensive explanation). However, as long as you are on a\nsingle-user system, this might still be an option for you. [...]\n\n\nFigure 1: Light-locker, by default, will lock out sound.\nFor those who choose workaround 2, here is how to remove light-locker and install good old xscreensaver:\nsudo apt-get purge light-locker light-locker-settings\nsudo apt-get install xscreensaver\n\nAfter installation, a \"Screensaver\" icon will appear in the \"Settings Manager\" menu. Clicking it allows to configure xscreensaver.\n\nFigure 2: XScreenSaver\n\nA: I also encountered the same issue with Linux Mint using XFCE desktop. What I did is to replace light-locker with cinnamon-screensaver (which is nicer than xscreensaver and gnome-screensaver).\nsudo apt-get remove light-locker\nsudo apt-get install cinnamon-screensaver\n\nThen edit the for-loop in the file /usr/bin/xflock4 to add the command that triggers cinnamon-screensaver like below:\nfor lock_cmd in \\\n    \"cinnamon-screensaver-command -l\" \\        # this is the added line\n    ....\n\n", "Q: Intel HD graphics settings if you got any laptop has an intel cpu in last 3 years in it you have a gpu from intel such as hd graphics 1000 or 5000, there is a program called intel hd graphics settings in windows, can you give me a replacement for that in ubuntu 14.04 lts?? i'm using samsung chronos/ativbook series 7 and can't use my secondary tv properly, i can't see unity and status bar, it's like 1920x1080 cropped into 1600x900\n\nA: Even though no one answered, i found a solution by trial and error, if your tv/monitor has screen settings (most of them has) found picture size than select \"screen fit\".\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 no cursor after fresh instalation So I'm having a problem after installing Ubuntu 14.04 on my HP Pavilion dv6-3160sp.\nThe problem is that after the booting to ubuntu the mouse/cursor simply vanishes, and also if I try like right click it doesn't do anything, so it's not \"invisible\" I think.\nBut when I was \"Trying Ubuntu\" before installing I didn't find any problem, the cursor was normal.\nThe iso that I'm using it's the official \"ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64\".\nI tested with the touchpad and a normal mouse, with no results.\nI tried to use the command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.cursor active false\n\nbut nothing worked.\n\nA: I had a similar problem - after a kernel update, the display comes up fine and the cursor is invisible though it does work - I can move things around if I'm very careful.\nThis was solved by simply logging out and back in.\n\nA: I was having a similar problem after switching users.

Click it and disable it.\nI found the solution from the following:\nMouse cursor flickering and disappearing\nWhile I am using 14.04 and the above link is for 13.10; it worked for me! ;)\n\nA: Do following steps: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal (Using the Dash or by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T)\n\n*Update apt with the command:\ndconf reset -f /org/compiz/\n\n\n*After that, run the following command to restart Unity:\nsetsid unity\n\n\n*To get back the default set of icons released Unity pain, run the following command, and then close the current session and log in again:\nunity --reset-icons\n\nNow your desktop Unity and the effects of compiz should be back to the original settings.\n\nA: In certain cases, this issue seems to be related to a lightdm bug.

But after installing it (I did a \"choose something else\" option for my instal and re-used my old /home which is on a different partition).\nAnd my partial solution for this at the moment is to boot via \"advanced options\" at the grub prompt and then from advanced options choose \"regular boot\" (or something like that - forget exact wording). Booting warns you about some graphics drivers might need a full graphical boot and then you get to the log-in screen.

I have already read some questions and answers here and on the internet, but I wasn't able to solve my problem. I think it is related to having installed both ubuntu-desktop and kubuntu-desktop.\nI have installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my laptop and also kubuntu-desktop. I mostly use the KDE sessions and hence I'd like all default applications to use KDE's programs, at the very least when running a KDE session.\nCurrently when I try to open a folder via Firefox's Open containing folder... Ubuntu's File application is launched. I'd like to see Dolphin instead.\nI thought that firefox used xdg-open to open external files but this doesn't seem the case since:\nxdg-open ~\n\nOpens Dolphin in a KDE session.\nIn summary:\nHow can you specify exactly which application is used when clicking on Open containing folder...?\nNote 1:\nI have already set Dolphin as default:\n$xdg-mime query default inode/directory\ndolphin.desktop\n$cat /usr/share/applications/defaults.list | grep inode\ninode/directory=kde4/dolphin.desktop\n\nAlso in system preferences I have selected Dolphin as default file manager.\nNote 2:\nI have already tried to reinstall firefox in a KDE session (hoping this would trigger some re-configuration):\nsudo apt-get remove firefox\nsudo apt-get purge firefox\nsudo apt-get install firefox\n\nthis doesn't change anything.\nNote 3: I noticed the mimeinfo.cache file which contains:\ncat /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache.backup | grep inode\ninode/directory=nautilus-folder-handler.desktop;baobab.desktop;kde4-dolphin.desktop;kde4-gwenview.desktop;kde4-kdesvn.desktop;nautilus.desktop;\n\nHowever I have tried mving it (and restarting), but nothing changed.

Ubuntu 14.04 brings a lot more eye candy to the table, but it's my educated guess that accelerated drivers are not enabled in any of the releases you have tried. It's just that the graphical problems are much more apparent when using the most graphically demanding one. But let me explain:\nI have an Asus eee PC 1015cx, which uses the Intel Atom Processor D2xxx/N2xxx Integrated Graphics Controller Video. And yes, that's the same driver that the x101ch model uses as well. \nAfter initially receiving it with a Windows7-Starter (ugh), I quickly decided I'd rather work with Ubuntu. But it wasn't that easy. After some digging, I quickly discovered that to enable my video drivers I needed to install the cedarview-graphics-driver (among a few related packages)\nThe problem with CedarView drivers is that they are close-source, but not only that - they are not actively developed or supported by intel anymore. And that brings a few limitations to the table, namely:\n\n\n*\n\n*It doesn't support kernels newer than 3.2. There are attempts to patch this sort of thing, but I haven't tried them.\n\n*It does't work with newer versions of xserver.\n\n\nIn other words - your only option is to install Ubutnu 12.04.01. As of 12.04.02 and later releases of Ubuntu, they all use a newer xserver versions that will not work for you.\nI will add one reservation I have - after installing Ubutnu 12.04.01 and the required drivers, updating the kernel didn't cause any trouble, nor did installing a pae kernel as the first link warns agains, so I'm guessing this is mostly an issue with xserver, though your mileage may vary.\nOne last thing - if you're afraid of installing an old version, keep in mind that 12.04 is a very solid LTS release, and it will remain supported until 2017.\n\nA: Asus 1015CX 2GB RAM.\n\n\n*\n\n*Had installed Kubuntu 12.04 - was working ok .\n\n*Installed Lubuntu 14.04 - working nicely.

Although the answer is a bit extensive, it is straightforward to setup.\nHow it works\nIf you click on the icon in the launcher, the script looks up if the VPN connection is up or down. In either case, it switches to the other option and the icon in the launcher will be replaced accordingly. After 10 seconds, the script checks if connection was actually established. If not, it changes the icon back to the correct one. You can change this \"time out\" set in the headsection of the script (wait = 10). (do not touch the other definitions, unless you know what you do)\n \nA few remarks:\n\n\n*\n\n*First and most important of all: running a script that asks for administrator's permissions, from a local directory, is a potential security risk by definition. You will not check the code of your script everytime you run it, and if someone with malicious intentions would be able to change the code, anything could happen. I would suggest to run the script from a secure location if you have (or should have) any doubts on who is doing what on your computer.\n\n*To make it more smooth qua interface, I used gksu in the commands you provided, instead of sudo. gksu is not installed by default, you will have to install it.\n\n*The script looks into what the shell returns on the command \"route\". As an identifier, I used <OpenVPNserver>, since that was the simpelest and most obvious string to look for. If the setup would be used for other types of connections, it will not be sufficient.\n\n*To replace the icons in the launcher, according to the state of the connection, the script reads the current launcher's content. If you use 13.10 or 14.04, it should be fine, but the outcome of the gsettings -\"call\" looks a bit different on older Ubuntu versions, and will not work properly.\n\n*Before the scrip changes the launcher, a backup (script) of the current launcher is created as /.restore_currentlauncher.sh. Although in the years I used it, I never needed it, it is good to have.\n\n\nHow to use:\nThe icons:\nRight-click on the icons below and save them as toggle_officon.png (the white one) and toggle_onicon.png (the green one).\n\n\nThe script:  Copy the (all) text below, paste it into an empty file and safe it as toggle_vpn.py\n#!/usr/bin/python3\n\nimport subprocess\nimport getpass\nimport time\n\n# time to wait, to check if connection was established (set correct icon)\nwait = 10\n# identifying difference on route command\nrunning_id = \"<OpenVPNserver>\"\n# location of the launcher restore script\nbackup_copy = \"/home/\"+getpass.getuser()+\"/.restore_currentlauncher.sh\"\n# name of the desktop file if connection is down\nmention_ifdown = 'application://VPN_off.desktop'\n# name of the desktop file if connection is down\nmention_ifup = 'application://VPN_on.desktop'\n\n\ndef check_ifrunning():\n    # check if connection is up or down\n    get_routeinfo = subprocess.Popen([\"route\"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\n    output = (get_routeinfo.communicate()[0].decode(\"utf-8\"))\n    if running_id in output:\n        return \"running\"\n    else:\n        return \"not_running\"\n\ndef read_currentlauncher():\n    # read the current launcher contents\n    get_launcheritems = subprocess.Popen([\n        \"gsettings\",\n        \"get\",\n        \"com.canonical.Unity.Launcher\",\n        \"favorites\"\n        ], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\n    return eval((get_launcheritems.communicate()[0].decode(\"utf-8\")))\n\ndef set_current_launcher(current_launcher):\n    # before editing the launcher, create restore script\n    backup_data = read_currentlauncher()\n    with open(backup_copy, \"wt\") as create_backup:\n        create_backup.write(\n            \"#!/bin/sh\\n\\n\"\\\n            \"gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites \"+\\\n            '\"'+str(backup_data)+'\"'\n            )\n    # preparing subprocess command string\n    current_launcher = str(current_launcher).replace(\", \", \",\")\n    subprocess.Popen([\n        \"gsettings\",\n        \"set\",\n        \"com.canonical.Unity.Launcher\",\n        \"favorites\",\n        current_launcher,\n        ]) \n\ndef set_icon(change_mode):\n    # defines the appropriate icon in the launcher\n    state = check_ifrunning()\n    if state == \"running\":\n        if change_mode == \"set_current\":\n            iconset = [mention_ifup, mention_ifdown]\n        else:\n            iconset = [mention_ifdown, mention_ifup]\n    elif state == \"not_running\":\n        if change_mode == \"set_current\":\n            iconset = [mention_ifdown, mention_ifup]\n        else:\n            iconset = [mention_ifup, mention_ifdown]\n    # set the defined icon\n    current_launcher = read_currentlauncher()\n    if iconset[0] in current_launcher:\n        pass\n    else:\n        index = current_launcher.index(iconset[1])\n        current_launcher.pop(index)\n        set_current_launcher(current_launcher)\n        time.sleep(1)\n        current_launcher.insert(index, iconset[0])\n        set_current_launcher(current_launcher)\n\ndef toggle_connection():\n    set_icon(\"set_alter\")\n    runcheck = check_ifrunning()\n    if runcheck == \"not_running\":\n        subprocess.call([\"gksu\", \"/etc/init.d/openvpn\", \"start\"])\n    else:\n        subprocess.call([\"gksu\", \"/etc/init.d/openvpn\", \"stop\"])\n    time.sleep(wait)\n    set_icon(\"set_current\")\n\ntoggle_connection()\n\nThe Desktop files \nThe VPN_off desktopfile: copy the text below, enter appropriate paths to both the icon and the script, save it as VPN_off.desktop in ~/.local/share/applications \n[Desktop Entry]\nName=VPN_off\nExec=python3 /path_to_script/toggle_vpn.py\nIcon=/path_to_icon/toggle_officon.png\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nNoDisplay=true\n\nThe VPN_on desktopfile: copy the text below, enter appropriate paths to both the icon and the script, save it as VPN_on.desktop in ~/.local/share/applications \n[Desktop Entry]\nName=VPN_on\nExec=python3 /path_to_script/toggle_vpn.py\nIcon=/path_to_icon/toggle_onicon.png\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nNoDisplay=true\n\nIf you did the actions above, drag either one of these desktop files on to the launcher (you might have to log out and in) and it should work!

People used to recommend making swap double or triple your RAM capacity, but that was back when ram was measured in MB ;)\nYou won't be using your swap unless you used up all your RAM, which isn't all that likely. I have 8Gb of RAM, and even with Virtualbox using 4 of them, + tons od¡f apps in the background,  (Firefox, Thunderbird, Ktorrent, Libreoffice, etc.), some of them fairly memory hungry, I've never reached anything near 8Gb, so my 4Gb swap aren't particularly being put to good use...\n\nA: I shrinked as much space as I wanted and then while installation made 3 partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*First partition of size 50 gigabytes, type Ext4 and mounted it to /\n\n*Second of size 16 gigabytes, type SWAP (16 gigabytes is probably far more than I need)\n\n*Third of size what was left, type Ext4 and mounted it to /home\n\n\nAnd that is it.\n\nA: I was unsuccessful setting up a dual boot with Windows 8.1 that came pre-installed on my Acer.

I trashed windows trying to install Ubuntu, and I trashed Ubuntu when I tried putting windows back on it.  \nI discovered that I could install windows on my smaller drives and have a spare one loaded and ready to plug into my desktop if I should decide to get rid of it. \nI ended up installing Windows on the 1TB that came with the computer, and Ubuntu on a 230GB HDD I pulled from a laptop.  I use an external HDD for data.  \nI see you have about 280GB for Ubuntu, about the same as me.  I partitioned mine as follows: \n380MB /boot, 24GB /, 8GB swap (At the end of the drive) and the gap of 200GB was partitioned for /home.\nYou can share the NTFS partitions with Linux for your data if you like. \nI really recommend that you find another HDD to boot Ubuntu. You can still dual boot, but you choose your boot from the BIOS instead of Grub.  Also, with my system, the OS that came with the computer, it will always wipe and use the entire HDD to reinstall windows 8.  \nAs for the swap, I found I had accidentally left swap off for a while.  It didn't pose any problem until I overloaded the system with graphics I tried to edit.  Otherwise, I didn't miss it.  So if you have 8GB or more RAM, I wouldn't use swap unless you run some intense software.\n", "Q: No window manager after Ubuntu update (e.g. 13.10 to 14.04) Machine is a single boot Linux.\nAfter upgrading from 13.10 to 14.04 today, my son's account starts without a window manager. He has his desktop icons and can click them but no menu and no launcher. I can start applications from the desktop icons but they start without window decorations.\nThe funny thing is that on my account on the same machine there is no problem. I log in and everything looks right, just like it was in 13.10. I tried to kill compiz on my session and got a similar effect.

Luckily I had an old backup and restoring got my window manager back. I learned in this process that it's not just compiz but also unity and ubuntu-desktop - if either is uninstalled, I get the same problem.\nUnfortunately the restore operation is not a real remedy - when I log out and then login, the new session still starts without a window manager... I have to redo the restore to get it back.\nSome more information:\n\n\n*\n\n*The window decorations, menu bar and launcher just appear at some point during the restore.\n\n*I created a new backup (after restoring) and tried to restore it instead of the old one - this doesn't do the trick. Even though the contents should be identical, the window manager doesn't appear unless I restore the old backup.\n\n\nAnother update: I found a crash log in /var/crash/_usr_bin_compiz.1001.crash - a large file with lots of library names listed, then a base64-encoded core dump... I can upload the text part if necessary.\nUpdate: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/1292396 describes a similar problem. The solution suggested there is to delete /home/user/.config/dconf/user. This solved the problem of my account, but my son's accont (in which the original problem appeared) still doesn't have a window manager even after applying this in his account.\nUpdate March 4 2016: same issue after updating from 15.04 to 15.10, so it's not version-specific. Using Corey's answer below solved the issue quickly.\n\nA: We had a similar issue and went through removing (renaming) some related files for the user.  It was eventually fixed by removing (renaming) compizconfig-1 in the .cache directory for the affected user.\n\nA: I tried this, but in the end I can't tell exactly what worked, I believe that purging+reinstalling nvidia could have been it.\nAlso after reading your post I reinstalled compiz-core (sudo apt-get install --reinstall compiz-core) and ran it on a terminal in the graphic environment (compiz --debug), that might have been what regenerated the correct configuration.\nBy the way, in order to get a terminal in the graphic environment I did the following:\nin Ctrl+Alt+F1 term export DISPLAY=\":x.y\" where x and y are numbers, in my case 0.0, then run gnome-terminal or xtrem. The terminal wont have border until you run compiz on it (closing it or the terminal will crash your graphic enviroment).\n\nA: My OS is Ubuntu 16.04, regularly updated last month, until this week when my issue came out :\nBlack screen after boot but able to log on user session on virtual console (Ctrl + alt + F1), tried then startx to obtain a diminished, useless graphical interface.\nTo solve this, all it took was a \ncd .config/dconf/\nrm user\n\n", "Q: AV-H830 TV Tuner installation error I have a problem with installation drivers for my TV Tuner AverTV Hybrid Volad HD H830.\nAfter running the script, I get this output:\n/lib/modules/3.13.0-24-generic/build found.\nVerifying archive integrity...\nExtracting archive...\nRunning installer...\nStart to compile objects...\nFailed to compile objects\ncp -f prebuild.bak prebuild.o\nmake -C /lib/modules/3.13.0-24-generic/build  O=/lib/modules/3.13.0-24-generic/build SUBDIRS=`pwd` modules\nmake[1]: Wejście do katalogu `/usr/src/linux-headers-3.13.0-24-generic'\n  CC [M]  /tmp/avm-install/installer/KernToDemod.o\nIn file included from /tmp/avm-install/installer/CLGDT3305.h:11:0,\n                 from /tmp/avm-install/installer/KernToDemod.h:4,\n                 from /tmp/avm-install/installer/KernToDemod.c:1:\n/tmp/avm-install/installer/osdep_dvb_2.h:4:26: fatal error: dvb_frontend.h: Nie ma takiego pliku ani katalogu\n #include \"dvb_frontend.h\"\n                          ^\ncompilation terminated.\nmake[3]: *** [/tmp/avm-install/installer/KernToDemod.o] Błąd 1\nmake[2]: *** [_module_/tmp/avm-install/installer] Błąd 2\nmake[1]: *** [sub-make] Błąd 2\nmake[1]: Opuszczenie katalogu `/usr/src/linux-headers-3.13.0-24-generic'\nmake: *** [default] Błąd 2\n\nI have read, that I need to install V4L.

If I set hotkey to something else in Keyboard > Layout it's working: I can change my layout, but if I set it to Alt+Shift it's not working at all.\nWhat are those different methods of keyboard input configuration?

Once you find out the abbreviations, you can change the layout in Terminal using the setxkbmap -layout command, appended with the region's code, whenever you want, but with each reboot it will default back to whatever you chose in your startup script.\n\nA: IBus is the modern Unix/Linux keyboard input method.

If that was not the case then we should consider this a bug of the respective application.\nThis may not be so clear if we wanted to play with unstable pre-release versions, or if we need to remove an application and it's dependency again, as we may not be able to foresee unwanted side-effects. In addition in case we are not very organized we may forget about an application we had installed but never used. This usually is not an issue as applications only need little space on our system.\nMore serious are issues from changing values of system-wide configuration files, as these may not be reset so easily.\nTo avoid having my main productive system cluttered with many applications I don't really need, or ending up with an unstable system on installing alpha or beta versions of applications I do all this testing in a virtual machine:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to install Ubuntu on VirtualBox?\nBy this we can easily revert back to an earlier snapshot, or to our vanilla backup installation. We can isolate a single new application installed in a vanilla installation, and we can also test various release or flavours of Ubuntu from a virtual machine.\nThe only drawback of a VM is the somewhat slower performance, some hard-drive usage, and rare bugs of the virtualization software we can not tell apart from real bugs of an application.\n", "Q: Installing monodevelop from PPA on Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty) I've just install Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty) to give a test run as I need to use monodevelop I've also decided to install that too.

I hope this has helped, so you can ENJOY using LINUX as much as I do.  \n\nA: I had this problem on 14.04 with a similar setup. I also, at some point, had a problem of text editing delay from one of my monitors. \nI had two video cards: one with 1 DVI port, and the other with both a VGA and DVI port.\nIn the end, I determined my problem was that I was mixing video cards: I was using two DVI ports from two different cards.

Move the green monitor, select the Unknown monitor and disable it.\n\nA: I don't have the same problem but a similar one.\nIn my case the display is touchscreen, I solved disabling the touchscreen as input:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo gedit /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf from the terminal\n\n*Add Option \"Ignore\" \"on\" at the end of touchscreen section (inside it)  \n\n*Reboot\n\n\nA: Have the exact same issue.

I'm trying to figure out how to enable mouse acceleration in Ubuntu 14.04.\nI have an XPS 15 9530, which has a built-in touch-pad (which appears to be recognised, as seen in the screenshot below), but I also have a Microsoft Touch Arc mouse, which works, but doesn't have any acceleration, meaning it's very slow to use.\n\nIs there some way I can enable acceleration?\n\nA: I use below command for that purpose\nxset m 50 1\n\nWhere m stands for setting the \"mouse\" and the first integer represents the \"acceleration\", and the second represents the \"threshold\".\nThe  acceleration  can be specified as an integer, or as a simple fraction, but the threshold is just an integer.\nThe pointer will go acceleration times as fast when the device travels more than threshold mickeys in 10 ms, including a  small transition range.\nFor more information, you can refer to the xset manual.\n", "Q: Flash not supported on webapps On Ubuntu 14.04, you cannot see flash contents using a webapp such as youtube or grooveshark.\nI installed flashplugin-istaller and pepperflashplugin-nonfree and I can see flash contents on both firefox and chromium\n\nA: For Youtube, search for \"Browser\" in Dash and open https://www.youtube.com/html5 then press \"Request for HTML5 player\".\nFor Grooveshark the only way is to change link \"http://grooveshark.com/\" with \"http://html5.grooveshark.com/\" in grooveshark.user.js file located in \"/usr/share/unity-webapps/userscripts/unity-webapps-grooveshark\"\nP.S.

I used 12.04 LTS upto 12.04.4 LTS. Then I upgraded it to 13.10. Yesterday, I upgraded from there to 14.04 LTS, through 'SOFTWARE UPDATER'. Open this from DASH.

PLease help me with this I cannot install ubuntu now except for using the windows installer and I don't see install anongside windows 7 option in the setup.\n\nA: You have a Logical Disk Manager (LDM), aka \"dynamic disk,\" setup. This is a proprietary Windows partitioning system that's applied atop conventional partitions. You can't install Ubuntu to an LDM disk, at least not easily or with the standard tools. Your best bet is to undo the LDM configuration and return to using conventional partitions. Some proprietary Windows programs, such as EaseUS Partition Master and Partition Wizard, are supposed to be able to do this conversion, but I've never used either program, so I can't really vouch for them. Backing up your important data before such a change is a worthwhile precaution.\nIn the future, do not use the standard Windows tools to create new partitions; they're known to convert from standard to LDM configuration without warning, and so are quite dangerous in a dual-boot setup. It's OK to use the Windows tools to shrink an existing Windows partition, but don't create anything new in its place; instead, use Linux tools or third-party Windows tools for creating new partitions.\n", "Q: No sound with HP 500-016 running Ubuntu 14.04 I have searched quite a lot looking for a solution.

Note that the partitioning system is entirely distinct from the filesystem, which is what's important in accessing the files on the disk. Try typing the following command:\nsudo blkid /dev/sdb?\n\n(Change /dev/sdb to whatever the disk identifier is. This will be helpful in identifying the filesystem(s) used on your disk's partition(s). (Note also that the ? is a wildcard; the intent is to apply blkid to every partition on the disk; I'm not asking a question in that command.)\nIf the filesystem is damaged, you may be able to repair it with the Linux fsck command in Linux or OS X or CHKDSK in Windows, depending on what the filesystem is. If the filesystem is badly damaged, you may need to resort to PhotoRec or something similar to recover individual files.\nThe complete output of the gdisk -l command might have been helpful, although what you've shown indicates that there is at least one partition on the disk. It's conceivable that it had two or more but that one partition has been completely wiped out, though, so showing the complete output, with partition tables, may be worthwhile. Edit your question, and add four spaces to each line of program output to keep the site from reformatting the lines and rendering the entire output illegible. (I've made this edit to your original gdisk output.)\n\nEdit: It looks like you've accidentally overwritten the contents of your external disk with an Ubuntu 14.04 installation image, thus severely damaging the original filesystem. Chances are you won't be able to recover everything from that disk, but PhotoRec (referenced above) may enable you to recover something.\n", "Q: debuild: no upstream tarball found What is the correct naming convention for a patched package?\nI am trying to put together a version of exiv2 with patch to add an extra schema.\nhere is what I have done so far:\n$ sudo apt-get build-dep exiv2\n$ cd src/exiv2\n$ apt-get source exiv2\n$ cd exiv2-0.23-1ubuntu2\n ... apply patch\n$ dpkg-source --commit\n$ dch -i\n    exiv2 (0.23-1ubuntu2-DwC1) trusty; urgency=medium\n$ debuild -S -sd -k1230CB40\n\nBut I then get an error message:\n\nThis package has a Debian revision number but there does not seem to\n  be an appropriate original tar file or .orig directory in the parent\n  directory; (expected one of exiv2_0.23-1ubuntu2.orig.tar.gz,\n  exiv2_0.23-1ubuntu2.orig.tar.bz2, exiv2_0.23-1ubuntu2.orig.tar.lzma, \n  exiv2_0.23-1ubuntu2.orig.tar.xz or exiv2-0.23-1ubuntu2.orig)\n  continue anyway?

Per Debian policy the upstream version can contain . + - : ~ but the debian revision can only contain + . ~, so everything before -DwC1 is considered part of the upstream version, and so it is looking for an original tarball with that version.\ndch gives a clue about this when you added that entry:\ndch warning: your current directory has been renamed to:\n../exiv2-0.23-1ubuntu2\ndch warning: no orig tarball found for the new version.\n\nUsually when I do a ppa upload of a package I will bump the ubuntu version and add something like ~ppa0 and usually the target release, say ~trusty. So for instance 1ubuntu2 to 1ubuntu3~ppa0~trusty. The extra strings with ~ will cause the version to compare less than 1ubuntu3 so if the package is updated in the main repositories the user will get the newer version.\nReally though all you need to do is drop the hyphen from your version, so 1ubuntu2DwC1 would work, or maybe 1ubuntu2.DwC1.\n", "Q: Has Nvidia 331.38 support for optimus?

The available solutions i have looked at include Frapix, fluffy tapeworm, BuGLE, and mumble. I have only found moderate success with the last option (mumble) i can start a program with the mumble-overlay command after navigating to the proper folder. And as far as i can tell everything is up and running fine however when i launch rust.x86 it fails to get past the grey screen with facepunch logo(I can see the frame rate overlay). So i am left only with programs that need to be compiled. And while i am not computer illiterate i am not proficient enough with linux to compile a program(not for a lack of trying). \n(game in question Rust by Facepunch hosted on steam for linux which runs fine without the overlay) \nThe game does not have an internally programmed frame monitor and is natively run so wine and play on linux tips and tricks will not help.\n\nA: If you use steam you can enable this option in the steam overlay settings and it should work with any game that works with the steam overlay.  It lets you choose what corner of the screen you want the counter to be in and I recommend using the high contrast color setting so that you can easily see the fps counter at all times.  \n\nA: Install and run Steam, configure its overlay to show the FPS counter and load it into your application by running it with the following environment variable applied:\nLD_PRELOAD=\"$HOME/.steam/steam/ubuntu12_32/gameoverlayrenderer.so:$HOME/.steam/steam/ubuntu12_64/gameoverlayrenderer.so\" ./game\n", "Q: Multi display issue with Ubuntu GNOME 14.04 Fresh install of Ubuntu GNOME 14.04 with 3 displays (fglrx driver).\nI can correct the screens order in System Settings / Display but it is not saved when I close the session and reopen it.\nScreens order in GDM is also wrong. Copy/pasting the .config/monitors.xml file into /var/lib/gdm/.config/ doesn't change anything.\nDoes anybody have an idea ?\n\nA: Looks like a bug to me. If you'd like to see it corrected I would suggest that you mark on the official report that this bug affects you. \n\nA: I have the same issue\nseems like gnome-settings-daemon is not loading monitors.xml at  startup\nmy work around is to run this command\npkill -9 -f gnome-settings-daemon\n\nas a \"Startup Application\"\ni have documented this in my ubuntu 14.04 update and problems post\nnot sure if there is a better solution\n\nA: There is one more workaround:\nLink to article\nIt basically says that ~/.config/monitors.xml is not applied on startup. So the author created a script which basically does something like this:\nxrandr --output LVDS --pos 1920x0 --output CRT1 --pos 0x0\n\n...and adds this to Gnome startup programs.\n", "Q: Forgot ubuntu passwords and would like to start fresh I installed ubuntu on a Windows Vista laptop last year, didn't use it much and now am trying to update to newer version and run other updates that it lists, but it asks for my password and I have no idea what it is.  I do not have any files to save as I just used it for internet access so would like to just completely start over, install latest version and not setup passwords, any guidance for someone that is really just savy enough to install a printer driver.\n\nA: You pretty much answered your own question here \"I do not have any files to save\".\nI too recommend you download the latest iso for 14.04 and burn it to a cd or usb stick.\nBtw if you previously installed Ubuntu, then I would say you are a bit more savy than if you were only able to install a print driver (which is very easy in Ubuntu).\n\nA: Look at the following link: Lost Password CLICK HERE\nIf you indeed want to start fresh then I would suggest that you download the newest most updated version of Ubuntu which is 14.04 and create a new password/account all together.

Then there were several error messages concerning fontconfig \"...out of memory\". At one of these error messages the system froze, not even the mouse pointer was moving anymore, nor ctrl-alt F2 was working.\nAfter hardware reset, at boot the system complained about not being able to identify the hardware and only showed a box \"what do you want to do\".\nWhat can I do? Does an install from CD make sense? And which one, 13.10 or 14.04?  \n\nA: At this point it is better to try a fresh install of 14.04 from a DVD or Live USB drive. After booting to ubuntu 14.04 from DVD dont forget to backup your files in the home directory. \nI recomment 14.04 because it is an LTS. Much more error free, fast and also a way better in performance than 13.10. \nHere is some instructions after Installing Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: I first downloaded a copy of 14.04 LTS. Made a bootable USB with this. Tried it on my computer with 13.10. It worked fine in all aspects, including auto-configuring of internet. Then I opened 'Software Updater' and followed it. The upgrade was seamless with all my apps, including ppa-s, but except Google Earth. \nI suggest you take backup of all data. Write a bootable DVD of 14.04 LTS. Install afresh.

Recently, I installed 14.04 LTS, and in 14.04 I was unable to install Fogger.\nI added the ppa from Terminal: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:loneowais/fogger It added, but updating shows an error and Fogger is not installing in 14.04.\nI really liked Fogger, and I don't want to use webapps as alternatives.\n\nA: I was playing around with making web app like I used to do with prism.  \nI just read about fogger today.  I installed by downloading the deb for latest version.  I installed with gbebi.  But had to run sudo apt install -f after that to get completely installed.\nIt is also possible to create a .desktop file and have it execute\nwebbrowser-app --chromeless --maximized http://www.yoursite-url.com\n\nIf you want to be able to mouse-up on bottom of window for path... back... etc, remove --chromeless from execute line.\nThe \"chrome\" of this app only displays temporarily so the chromeless aspect is likely not necessary for the most part.\n\nA: To answer the first question:\nSadly, Fogger is Dead and it died around the time of Ubuntu 12.10. \"loneowais\", abandoned the project pretty much immediately after the Ubuntu App Showdown was over.\nSource: I was a part of the FogApp Authors and wrote multiple FogApps in the project.\n\nwebbrowser-app is a great suggestion and I'd also like to point out that it supports the \"--fullscreen\" option to start in not just maximized but completely fullscreen, which is cool for some scenarios.\nwebbrowser-app also \"--app-id=\" which is a controller for Sessions, it allows you to give a unique identifier to create a persistent session for the identifier and if you reuse that identifier again it will return with that session. This feature allows you to have multiple instances of the same webapp logged in with multiple different accounts. This would be really cool for say someone who has many different Gmail accounts.\n\nThere are some more options to create Web-App Desktop Applications as well.\nEpiphany, aka GNOME's Web, has support for Web-App Desktop Applications including multiple sessions.\nMidori has support for Web-App Desktop Applications including multiple sessions.\n\nA: The solution is much simpler than what everyone is making it look like. Add the PPA as usual, then go to your Software Sources app and manually edit the end of the URL path after deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/loneowais/fogger/ by replacing ubuntu precise main (or whatever PPA you choose, I recommend choosing the closest up-to-date one) to your version of Ubuntu, which is Ubuntu Trusty.\nYour end result should look like this:\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/loneowais/fogger/ubuntu trusty main\n\nThere you go! Now just perform a sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install fogger and we should be good to go! :)\n\nA: Update:\nSince Fogger ☁️ is no-more, why not try an alternative?\nI recommend trying Nativefier, which runs in Node.JS - a JavaScript program library on top of an open-source Chromium browser - packaged in one. \n⚠️ Use of Nativefier will require some Terminal input, but it's just a few commands and can be learned easily using their Readme on the GitHub page below:\nhttps://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier\nInstructions for download and install of Nativefier is on the site above too, of course. \n", "Q: How Do you set up numlockx at startup in ubuntu 14.04 In ubuntu 13.10 in order to install numlockx you had to run:\nsudo apt-get install numlockx\nAfter you install numlockx you had to run:\ngksudo gedit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\nAt the end of this file you had to enter greeter-setup-script=/usr/bin/numlockx on\nIn 14.04 when you run gksudo gedit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf it opens up a blank file....\nHow do i set up numlockx in 14.04?\nI have also tried to follow this answer but that did not work either.\n\nA: Try adding this line:\ngreeter-setup-script=/usr/bin/numlockx on\n\nto the file /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-unity-greeter.conf.\nhowever this file will be overwritten when the unity-greeter is upgraded.

For making these I followed the next steps:\n(Previously I had encrypted the disk with LUKS following this post http://www.marclewis.com/2011/04/02/luks-encrypted-disks-under-ubuntu-1010/)\nCheck the UUID\nsudo blkid \n/dev/sda1: UUID=\"b3024cc1-93d1-439f-80ce-1b1ceeafda1e\" TYPE=\"crypto_LUKS\"\n\nMake a keyfile with the right passphrase and save it in my HOME (which is also encrypted).\nsudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/home/[USERNAME]/.keyfiles/key_luks bs=1024 count=4\nsudo chmod 0400 .keyfiles/key_luks\n\nAdd the key\nsudo cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sda1 /home/zeugor/.keyfiles/key_luks\n\nNew entry in /etc/crypttab\nhddencrypted UUID=b3024cc1-93d1-439f-80ce-1b1ceeafda1e /home/[USERNAME]/.keyfiles/key_luks luks\n\nUpdate the initial ramdisk\nsudo update-initramfs -u -k all\n\nThen, to test it, I used the follow command to start cryptdisks:\nsudo cryptdisks_start hddencrypted \n * Starting crypto disk...                                                       \n * hddencrypted (starting)..\n * hddencrypted (started)... \n\nTo check hddencrypted was mapped:\nls /dev/mapper/\ncontrol  hddencrypted\n\nCreate a mount point\nmkdir /mnt/hdd\n\nNew entry in /etc/fstab\n/dev/mapper/hddencrypted /mnt/hdd ext4 defaults 0 2\n\nValidate fstab without reboot:\nsudo mount -a\n\nMount the encrypted partition on boot\nNow I have mount it in/mnt/hdd as I proposed. But I wold like to make this automatically after reboot. But before I can log in, I get this error:\nthe disk drive for /mnt/hdd is not ready yet or not permit\n\nAll this makes me think that /etc/crypttab can't access to the keyfile which is located in my HOME (other encrypted partition). I don't know the order which the system follows to unencrypted and mounts the units. My HOME should be unencrypted before my HDD for giving access to read the keyfile.\nI would appreciate any insight as to why this happens.\nUPDATE:\nIf I locate the keyfile in /boot (no encrypted), instead of in my /home/[USERNAME] (encrypted) the /dev/sda1 and update the entry in /etc/crypttab is perfectly mounted on boot time. \n\nA: Does it work if you replace \"defaults\" in fstab with\nrw,suid,dev,exec,auto,user,async,relatime\n\n(According to the mount man page, it's the same as \"defaults\" except for \"user\".)\n\nA: A key file in the /boot directory can be read by any other operation system booted on your machine that is able to mount the filesystem on that /boot is located. Thus, encryption is not really effective. This argument applies to all key file locations on unencrypted file systems. \nTo avoid key files on unencrypted file systems a password can be used for decryption. Create a strong password for the device. Then, change the line in /etc/crypttab to\nhddencrypted UUID=b3024cc1-93d1-439f-80ce-1b1ceeafda1e none luks\n\nand keep the entry in /etc/fstab unmodified. Ubuntu 14.04/16.04/18.04 asks you for the password on startup.  \n\nA: Make sure the hddencrypted partition is listed after the home partition, in both /etc/fstab and /etc/crypttab.  As the crypttab (5) manpage states:\n\nThe order of records in\n         crypttab is important because the init scripts sequentially iterate through crypttab doing\n         their thing.\n\nAlso you could try adding the noearly option to the latter partition in /etc/crypttab:\nhddencrypted UUID=<...> /home/[USERNAME]/.keyfiles/key_luks luks,noearly\n\nIn a normal situation, you could indicate that the home partition must be mounted first by adding it to     CRYPTDISKS_MOUNT in /etc/default/cryptdisks, but since it is itself encrypted, I have a feeling that would not be a good idea.\n", "Q: Steam Alternative to Dota 2 Installation I connect to internet via proxy which has blocked Steam ports and I want to install DOTA 2 to play offline.\nIs there an alternative installation procedure to Steam by which I can install DOTA 2 on my Ubuntu 14.04?\n\nA: If the proxy has the ports blocked there is little you can do about it if you don't own it.\nAlso, DOTA2 has no offline capabilities that I'm aware of, since most of the calculations are done serverside, and yes, even the bot matches are done 'online', so to speak.\nYou should probably take it to the dev forums, where there are people who can help you with this DOTA2 related issue.\n", "Q: Kdocker doesn't appear in notification area in Ubuntu 14.04 Running kdocker and then clicking on a window hides the window, but no icon appears in the notification area in Ubuntu 14.04 in either Gnome Flashback (Metacity) or Xfce-session.\nIf I find kdocker's process ID and kill it, I get the hidden window back.\nThis looks like a bug.

So, does my 6-yr old Core-2 Duo 32-bit processor system work best with the 32-bit distro, or will the 64 bit version work?\n\nA: I would recommend reading For better performance should I install 32-bit or 64-bit? and I installed a 64-bit OS in a 32-bit processor\nBut the truth is, if you do not have the following hardware specs ready, 64 bit is not for you yet:\n\n\n*\n\n*CPU is 64 bit capability\n\n*Motherboard that supports 64 bit (It should if the CPU is 64 bit)\n\n*At least 4 GB of RAM. IF you have less than 4 GB it is recommended to stay on 32 bit because 64 bit will not have a optimal performance.\n\n\nTo test this out, simply insert the Live Ubuntu DVD/USB on your computer and see if it runs. If it runs and you see the desktop, then you have a 64 bit capable CPU. If you get a architectural error then you can only use the 32 bit version of Ubuntu.\nAnother way to check this is to run the lscpu command. Here is what mines look like:\ncyrex@cyrex:~$ lscpu\nArchitecture:          x86_64\nCPU op-mode(s):        32-bit, 64-bit\nByte Order:            Little Endian\nCPU(s):                8\nOn-line CPU(s) list:   0-7\nThread(s) per core:    2\nCore(s) per socket:    4\nSocket(s):             1\nNUMA node(s):          1\nVendor ID:             GenuineIntel\nCPU family:            6\nModel:                 60\nStepping:              3\nCPU MHz:               800.000\nBogoMIPS:              6811.87\nVirtualization:        VT-x\nL1d cache:             32K\nL1i cache:             32K\nL2 cache:              256K\nL3 cache:              8192K\nNUMA node0 CPU(s):     0-7\n\nIf you see the line that says CPU op-mode it shows that it supports 32 bit and 64 bit. The Architecture line shows what Ubuntu arch I am using at the moment, which would be the 64 bit one.\nLastly, I am sure (I might be wrong so please correct me) that all Core 2 Duo are 64 bit capable. I just checked all Core 2 Duo Processors and none of them were 32-bit only. I checked all 2006, 2007 and 2008. So if you could add what model your CPU is, it would help more.\nIf I am correct, then for your case I recommend 64 bit. You have 4 GB of RAM and a good CPU for Ubuntu 64 bit.\n\nA: You cannot install a 64-bit Operating System (or any other 64-bit software) on a 32-bit processor (System). While 64-bit processor supports any 32-bit application, reverse is not true. Hence you can run any 32-bit application(i386) on a 64-bit processor/System (amd64) but not the other way around. 64-bit Operating-Systems/Aplications are made specifically only for 64-bit processors.\nThat leaves you with no choice but to install 32-bit distro/version of Ubuntu IF you have a 32-bit processor.\nI remembered Core 2 duo to be 64-bit and Wikipedia page 'Inter Core Family' confirms it\nYou can also check typing in terminal:\nlscpu\n\nand check CPU op-mode entry, if 64-bit is supported then it will be mentioned there,\nArchitecture:          x86_64\nCPU op-mode(s):        32-bit, 64-bit\n\n", "Q: Question about manual partitioning for Dual boot system I recently bought a new laptop, and I am trying to dual boot my system with windows 8.1 and ubuntu. My installer doesn't recognize the windows 8 partition on my hard drive, so it doesn't give me the option to install alongside windows. I can see a large partition that is supposed to be my windows partition in the installer, but it doesn't recognize that it is windows. I have turned off secure boot and fast start-up, but there is no difference. I am thinking about manually partitioning my hard drive in the Ubuntu installer. I have two questions:\nFirst, I am planning on partitioning it with 16 GB swap, which is the amount of ram on my laptop, and about 20 GB for a '/' root logical partition. Is this a good setup for the installer? \nMy second question is about the grub menu. If I do the manual install, will grub recognize my windows partition even though the ubuntu installer doesn't? Meaning when I see the grub menu, will it just list /dev/sd# or will it say Windows like before, or maybe not even show it at all?\nLaptop specs:\nHP Envy 15t-j100\nIntel i7-4700MQ\n16GB RAM\n1TB HDD\n\nA: I say that 8 GB of swap would be enough.\nI recommend reading this post: askubuntu.com/questions/49109/i-have-16gb-ram-do-i-need-32gb-swap.\nYes, GRUB will recognize a windows partition and add it to the boot menu. If it doesn't you can edit grub and add Windows to it. Read this post.\n\nA: The failure to recognize Windows in the installer is a bug in the installer, not a bug in GRUB. In theory, GRUB should detect Windows just fine once you install via the \"Something Else\" option in the installer. That said, I can't make any promises; GRUB can be pretty finicky about starting Windows on EFI systems, so you might run into some unrelated problem.\nPersonally, I'd shrink the Windows partition by much more than you're suggesting and set aside more space for a shared-data partition. This will minimize the risk of accessing the Windows partition from Linux (since you won't need to do it), while still enabling you to share data between the two OSes.\n(Actually, that's a lie; I wouldn't use Windows more than two or three times a year, so I'd give most of my space to Linux.

You would have to execute gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power idle-dim-time [seconds] (possibly as lightdm as this is the user who runs the lockscreen) however this key doesn't exist anymore.\nA possible workaround Khurshid mentioned is to install XScreenSaver (and set the timeout from there):\nHow can I change or install screensavers?\n\nA: This extension, \"unblank\", appears to work, I have only had it working for a minute now but my test shows that it keeps the display from turning off after pressing super + L.\nhttps://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1414/unblank/\n\nA: I have a fresh installation of Ubuntu GNOME 14.04 on a new machine I got, and I have set the power to dim after \"inactive for 30 minutes\"\nWhen I lock the screen it does not turn off for 30 min. However, if you don't manually lock the screen, it will turn off when your power settings have reached their limit (i.e. 30 min set time)\n", "Q: Problem after close the lid of my laptop I am using xubuntu and I upgraded from 13.10 to 14.04 today. \nNow, when I close my laptop and I reopen it it show the login screen (as normal). When I enter my credentials, it show a black screen. I must to push the start button of my computer to show the login screen again and reenter my credentials.\nI see my desktop but I think it restart the session. All my applications are close.\nWhen I put my laptop in standby with the menu, it works perfectly.\nIs there a solution?\n\nA: A bug has been filled; check this link, and as you can see from that link, the bug is now labeled as \"Fix Released\". If it still isn't included in any automatic update, post number 91 has directions that fix the issue.\nAlso, some report that if you disable \"Lock on suspend\" in the \"Light Locker Settings\" screen, and then manually lock the screen from the terminal with:\nlight-locker-command -l\n\nand then suspend by closing the lid, it resumes fine.\nAlternatively you could change back to xscreensaver.\n\nA: I ran into a similar issue. I can't remember where I found this solution, but someone mentioned that it was a conflict between xfce's power manager and systemd.\nThe person suggested the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open /etc/systemd/logind.conf in your editor of choice\nsudo vim /etc/systemd/logind.conf\n\n*Adding the following line    \nHandleLidSwitch=ignore\n\n*Save and exit\n\n*Restart\n\n\nAnyhow, It worked for me. Hopefully, it works for you as well!\n\nA: I had the same issue. It was fixed by opening Xfce Power Manager and changing When laptop lip is closed from Lock screen to Suspend for On battery and Plugged in options.\n", "Q: Install from Ubuntu Software Center web button When I click Install from Ubuntu Software Center from web it asks to chose an application. Where do I find Ubuntu Software Center app?\n\nA: A couple of useful tips could help with this and similar questions.\nIf you look in the folder /usr/share/applications you will see a series of .desktop files.  You should hopefully see something that you would recognise in terms of the application name.\nIn this case - the desktop file is ubuntu-software-center.desktop\nHave a quick look inside the file (it is a text file) and you will see a line that starts Exec= - that command line is where your application is located.\nIn this case - /usr/bin/software-center\nAn alternative is to use the following technique:\ntype which followed by the first few characters of the software you are attempting to locate - e.g. soft.  Then press Tab.  Hopefully you'll see the name of the application you are attempting to run.  Pressing return after which software-center will give the same value as the Exec= statement above.\n\nA: I usually just have it use xdg-open for most everything, since this will know what to open the files in. \nSo just navigate to  -> File System -> usr -> bin -> then find xdg-open\nor /usr/bin/xdg-open\nFind it once and you can use it for a variety of files.\n", "Q: black screen / low graphics mode on logout If log out from session, get black screen and the \"low graphics mode\" dialog, sometimes with cursor, sometimes without.\n14.04 with latest fglrx.

Checked here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1918649 - but didn't see an appropriate lightdm.conf option.\n\nA: This will not be a solution to your question nor a very satisfying workaround, but I have the same issue since Ubuntu 14.04 and find that when I log out while using integrated graphics (Intel HD 4400) Ubuntu turns to low graphics mode, but when switching to discrete graphics (Radeon HD 8670M) log out works fine.\nI use proprietary drivers (fglrx) for the discrete graphics card and catalyst control centre to switch between both GPUs. When I log out while using the discrete GPU, the screen flickers a bit (it looks like something is happening to screen resolution) before it brings me to the login screen, but it works.\nUpdate:\nI removed fglrx and set my laptop to use only the integrated GPU in BIOS. Now I can actually log out when using the integrated GPU. There is no possibility left to switch to the discrete GPU however.\nIf the same is possible on your machine (setting it to integrated graphics only) you can get low power consumption back.\n\nA: Do not know if this answer is still valid after all that time but I was suffering the same problem (Dell Inspiron 15R, ATI Radeon HD8xxxM series, kubuntu 14.04.1 - 64 bits).\nThe flaw disappeared after installing the 14.6 beta driver from Ati.

Try using sudo like this:\n$ sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.0.3:/tank/documents /Users/me/Remote\n\n\nA: To answer your question though, \"Operation not permitted\" is what you will see when there is already a mount attached to the named folder \"/Users/me/Remote\"\nUsing the Finder instead works fine, because it will instead mount the remote under /Volumes and not introduce that conflict.\n", "Q: No Printer Driver for HP 3510 in Lubuntu Have just installed Lubuntu 14.04 and I am experimenting with it.

Everything was working fine. After a few days an update notifier came out to install kernel 3.13.0-24 (and bunch of other stuff) and suddenly when I try to login it gives me an error that it had to start in low graphics mode. Before that I saw a line that said \"NVidia is tainting kernel\" or something like that.\nI went into recovery mode and purged all nvidia content (purge nvidia*) but now the resolution is 640*480 and I can't change it, also poor graphical performance.\nIt seems that the new kernel is somehow incompatible with any NVidia driver. I tried all other versions (337, 318, 310) but to no avail.\nAnyone have any idea about this problem?\n\nA: I am using the 3.13.0-24-generic 64-bit version with the 337.12 Nvidia driver. Today I changed to the 334.21 Nvidia version. All is good. This means that we know the 337/334 versions of Nvidia do work with the 3.13.0-24-generic kernel version.\nWhat I suggest is to first troubleshoot some of the problems mentioned in How do I install the Nvidia drivers?\nSpecially the part about looking for any left over nvidia configuration files (Maybe /etc/modprobe.conf). If the purging worked correctly you should have loaded Ubuntu using the Nvidia nouveau driver which supports resolutions higher than 640. Of course, I am assuming you don't have an Nvidia 8xx or one of the latest 700 series which still have some minor issues with Nouveau.\nCheck to see if no Nvidia config files were left behind and use only the Xorg PPA because the Nvidia package from the Nvidia site has other ways of installing (and leaving) packages.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 QtCreator Qt5 examples missing After upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04 I removed the official qtcreator in order to install the modified version from the software center because I'd like to try the SDK.\nFortunately, the docs are now included in the official installation.

It still says Off (DynOff) and I guess that it means the card is not powered and that this is automatic. \nHowever, if you still want to roll things back to the manual settings, you have to modify grub.  Use sudo to do the following: \nopen in any editor the file /etc/default/grub  and find the line \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\n\nthere should be values like \"quiet splash\" in this line; just add radeon.runpm=0 so it looks something like this: \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash radeon.runpm=0\"\n\nsave the file and run \nsudo update-grub\n\nthen reboot. after rebooting, the behavior of cat /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch should be like in older ubuntu version. then you can run \necho OFF > /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitheroo/switch\n\nto see if it works - as you used to do before. if it works, add this line to /etc/rc.local just above exit 0. \ni tried it on my machine and it basically works... but i think that DynOff is doing exactly the same. my computer is not overheating with both configurations. \n\nA: Try this and confirm in comments if this works...\nhttp://www.mostthingsweb.com/2014/07/disable-radeon-power-management-newer-linux-kernels/.\nFor me, during first reboot it gave a low graphics mode.

Add resume=/dev/sda6, so the line\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"nosplash enable_mtrr_cleanup=1\"\n\nwill now look like this\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"nosplash enable_mtrr_cleanup=1 resume=/dev/sda6\"\n\nSave the file and run this to enable the new configuration:\nsudo update-grub2\n\n", "Q: trouble booting 14.04 from USB I'm trying to upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04 and am encountering problems.\nI'm working from 12.04.

I've reformatted the USB drive.  I've re-downloaded the iso file.  Keep getting the same results. \nFrustrating because it worked fine when I loaded 12.04 using this same procedure on the same computer (Toshiba Satellite with AMD 64 processor). \n\nA: I would perform a MD5 check to make sure the .ISO file you are downloading is good. The procedure is here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM   (do the manual procedure its fast and easy).\nThe 14.04 MD5 value is here:\nhttp://releases.ubuntu.com/trusty/MD5SUMS\nI have never installed using a usb, and have aways used a DVD disk. It's really easy if it's an option for you. If using a USB is important to you, take a look here to make sure what you are doing is the same as the 14.04 bootable USB procedure: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick \nLastly, make sure that your bios boot order allows your boot device to be the highest in the list; or manually select where to boot from when your PC starts.\nIf it worked on a 12.04 install, it is a good sign! Just keep digging, you'll get it.\n\nA: Got 14.04 on the system without having to re-install using USB stick.\nFound this link with instructions on how to upgrade directly from within 12.04.  \nHere are the steps:\nMake sure all updates are installed.\nOpen a terminal screen\nType  sudo update-manager -d \nAn update window pop-up window should appear with an option at the top to upgrade to 14.04.\nWorked perfectly for me.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS how to avoid windows going off the current workspace Sometimes open windows go out of the bound of the current workspace without any keyboard shortcut used and it is very annoying since the title bar may be inaccessible at times.

I am using a 64-bit 12.04 bootable usb thumb drive (which I have used to boot from many times before).\nMy Bios boot settings are:\nCSM -> Enabled\nBoot Mode ->Auto\nBoot Priority -> Legacy first\nQuick Boot -> Enabled\n\nand under Primary Boot Sequence, all the USB devices are before the hard drives. When inserting the thumb drive and starting the machine, it starts into Win8, as if nothing has happened. When switching the Boot Priority to UEFI first, the same thing happens. Interestingly, when I disabled Quick Boot the PC would beep on booting, and then proceed to boot in Win8 as normal. Any ideas?\nthanks!\nNikos\n\nA: First, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO INSTALL LINUX IN BIOS/CSM/LEGACY MODE ON A SYSTEM IN WHICH WINDOWS IS BOOTING IN EFI/UEFI MODE!!!! In other words, setting \"CSM\" to \"Enabled\" and \"Boot Priority\" to \"Legacy first\" is the wrong thing to do! I realize that a lot of sites advise doing this, but they're wrong. Using a BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode boot will clear an initial hurdle, but it will put up two or three more down the road, so it creates more problems than it solves. People who advise doing it the hard way don't realize what they're doing because they do eventually clear those later hurdles, but they don't associate them with their initial mistake. (That said, there are some cases where using a BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode installation is the way to go, but they're the exception, not the rule.)\nYou should probably disable the \"quick boot\" option; this option often skips some or all of USB initialization, which renders USB devices unbootable. That's probably the immediate cause of your problem. Speaking of \"quick boot\" options, another one is at least as important: There's an option in Windows called \"Fast Startup\" or \"Hybrid Boot\" that you must disable, as described here.\nOn some computers, you may need to hit a function key (or sometimes Esc) just after powering on the computer in order to get a boot menu that enables you to boot from an external device. Unfortunately, the key you use to get this menu varies from one computer to another.\nFor more in EFI-mode booting, I recommend you read at least one of the following pages:\n\n\n*\n\n*My page on EFI-mode Linux installations\n\n*The Ubuntu community wiki on the same topic\n\n*Adam Williamson's blog on how EFI works\n", "Q: Local cloud system as the Ubuntu One Service will be finished soon, I'm searching for alternatives. I got aware that I don't really need to give my files to an internet service like Dropbox. So I want to setup a local cloud system to sync some files between the computers in my little office. Maybe in the future I will want to sync to my own webspace via ftp.\nI have tried out Unison, but as I see, it wont do the work automatically and silently in the background every 5 minutes.\nIs there an application to setup a local cloud system like Ubuntu One?\nGreetings\n\nA: I have used CrashPlan for quite awhile. If you just want to create a private local cloud, it cant be beat! If thats is your plan, it is totally free and unlimited. \nBut crashplan also provides a service like dropbox for a very affordable fee. I use both so that I have double protection. \nThere is also OwnCloud, but as far as I understand (I may be wrong) you have to have a web server for it.

Put one channel (left or right) in half the other channel.\nIf I understand correctly your problem, it can be because when the 2 channels of the mic are in the same level, they cancel each other.

Maybe I'll try dual booting next.\nReally would appreciate any help to get my Epson ME-301 scanner to work\n\nA: If you want to connect over wi-fi, you might try the instructions here. \nSpecifically, after installing the Epson drivers, you should edit /etc/sane.d/epkowa.conf to include network devices (there are instructions in the file). Then you should be sure to comment out the conflicting \"epson\" and \"epson2\" lines in /etc/sane.d/dll.conf\n", "Q: How can I find out which cards are supported by the fglrx driver? I want to know where I can find out which is the current fglrx-updates driver in the repo. I own a Radeon R9 270 and I need to know if it is supported since Trusty 14.04. Thanks! :)\n\nA: Here's the link I found from the unofficial AMD Linux community. \nHere's the list on Wikipedia. \nYou can also search about your driver on the AMD website, see if works for Linux. \nThe unofficial AMD Linux community hasn't provided an installation tutorial on Trusty Tahr yet. I'm kind of itchy about trying the 13.10 installation method.\nFrom my own experience with Precise and Saucy, the current release 13.12 didn't work very well on both platform but the 14.3 beta worked sort of fine for me, but still caused some crashes when I was using VLC.

I wanted to install Ubuntu 12.04 along with it and installed it (from USB).\nActually, I created a separate 40GB disk partition for Ubuntu.

I am using watchdog, a python package to monitor changes in the file system. The code works fine on Mac but it seems that the delete event is not monitored correctly in ubuntu. If I do a rm instead of move the file to trash, watchdog is able to detect the change. I am wondering whether there is a difference between moving to trash and rm command on the terminal in ubuntu that might lead to this behavior. \nThank you very much!\n\nA: In layman's terms, \nrm unlinks the file.\n\"moving to trash\" is something equivalent to mv file ~/.local/share/Trash in terminal, which means the file was moved from one directory to another directory. \nP.S.: This question came up as the first result when I did a Google search for \"ubuntu rm trash difference\".

I guess grub felt like remembering my previous boot settings after installing Ubuntu. \nSolution:\nFrom Terminal do \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\n*Look for this line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"acpi=off noapic nolapic nomodeset\"\n\n*Replace it with something likeGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"acpi=on\"\n\n*ctrl+o To save and ctrl+x to exit nano\n\n*Next we have to update grub with the new settings sudo update-grub\n\n*Reboot the system.\n\n\nAfterwords Netflix-Desktop, among other things, should work.\nAlso as a reminder you should first install the Nvidia drivers before anything, if you have a 580GTX. Otherwise nouveau will crash on you.\n", "Q: Should I use nvidia graphic card to watch movie? I'm always watching movie with VLC media player, but I'm afraid that it will hurt the laptop motherboard intel graphic. Should I use build in graphic card to open VLC media player to reduce the laptop burden? \nFor example, optirun VLC on terminal instead.\n\nA: If it has hardware decoding, try using it. I do not personally have that card, so I can't give you specifics. I would check if there are any \"additional drivers\". It is unlikely that watching too many movies will hurt your laptop, but if it has you worried find an application that can display your cpu temp. If the fans are all cranked up and you crash when while doing something cpu intensive, that would be a sign it is over heating.\nMy desktop gtx660 runs saucy and tahr excellent. It has opengl and lots of supported hardware decoding. So yes, use a recent nvidia card if you can.\n", "Q: Linux application to install Windows on a USB drive There are everal applications which can install MS Windows on a USB drive, but all of these applications should be installed in a Windows environment.

You can access a TTY by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1; TTY is just a terminal. You can return to the graphical desktop by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F7.\nOtherwise you can use kernel interupts to safely shutdown the computer:\nCtrl+Alt+Print Screen+R,E,I,S,U,B (Hold down Ctrl, Alt, and Prnt Scrn then press REISUB in that order with about a second pause between each letter)\nThe keyboard has to be plugged into the computer you want to shut down. The command above will restart the computer. Unfortunately, it's not so easy to just power-off this way. Hit the power button after the computer restarts to keep it from rebooting all the way.\n\nA: Alternative terminal command which will shutdown computer \nsudo shutdown -p now\nnow can be replaced with +m, where m is the number of minutes to wait until shutting down and hh:mm which specifies the time on the 24hr clock when your computer will shutdown.\nReplace -p with -r to reboot instead of shutting your computer down.\nCtrl+Alt+t might open you an terminal if you are unable to access one.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 mouse and window focus issues So I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 tonight and I'm having this weird issue with my mouse and window focus.\nI can't seem to click on any Unity Launcher icons. More over I can't click on unfocused windows to bring them to the front. It doesn't work. \nI don't know how better to explain this. It is seemingly random when I can click on something inside a window. I can't even click on the \"X\" button to close or the title bar to move the window around most of the time.  What's causing this behaviour?\nI really want to start using Ubuntu as my main desktop but I've always had weird issues like this when I would test out a release. In a VM I don't have problems but after a real install I get problems. \nEdit: Some more information, my mouse is a USB RAT5 gaming mouse. Not that I think it's the physical mouse that's broke...and the pointer doesn't freeze or anything.  I just can't click on anything the majority of the time.\n\nA: So I kept looking around and the problem seems to have been the type of mouse I have. I found a thread on the Ubuntu forums by a user with a similar mouse having a problem that sounded like mine. In the thread it was suggested to (create and) edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf files with the following:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"Mouse Remap\"\n    MatchProduct \"Saitek Cyborg R.A.T.5 Mouse\"\n    MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n    Option \"ButtonMapping\" \"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2 9 10 11 12 0 0 0\"\nEndSection\n\nAnd then I restarted my computer.\nI have RAT5 gaming mouse and the use from the thread has the RAT7 gaming mouse.\nIt has been a day since I implemented the fix and there have been no problems. Didn't bother looking into why it was buggy but I know the above configuration fixed it.\nThread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2152976\n\nA: A search for a similar problem brought me here. Left mouse click doesn't work anymore, neither on the mouse itself nor on touch pad. In my case it is a matter of a bluetooth mouse. \nMy solution was to remove the mouse from the list of paired bluetooth devices (Dash → Bluetooth), switch off the mouse and re-pair it after a reboot.\n\nA: I had this on 16.04 with a laptop and a USB mouse connected. USB mouse didn't work. Clicking once on the laptop's touchpad got the mouse's buttons to work again.\n\nA: I found a solution to similar focus problem. A part of it was that mouse focus remained locked to one window but keyboard focus was in another. I fixed it by running:\nsudo apt install wmctrl\nxfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/click_to_focus -s true \nwmctrl -R WindowName \nxfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/click_to_focus -s false\n\nHere are the links to original answer and bug report.\n\nA: I had this problem with a wireless mouse on an Asus laptop.  My touch pad, that I prefer not to use, was actually doing the same.\nI tried a bunch of things, but in the end what fixed it was to unplug the usb receiver for my mouse, and plug it back in.

Maybe the installed source files aren't set up right in software center?  IDK.\nPS> I am not sure the exact chipset, trying to get that figured out.\n\nA: OK so here's how I fixed this.\nFor anyone wondering, this is for when your fresh Ubuntu install can't access the internet (Bleh)\nEssentially the problem is that Ubuntu did not install the driver package.\nSo it's a straightforward problem, but a wee bit complicated to fix.\nSo, first, \nI read this thread here.

Depending on the client, it may also say:\nSocket failed: Connection timed out or \nSocket failed: Connection failed\n\nthen bring up busybox or go into a kernel panic.\nHow can I debug this?    \n\nA: I had same issue and for days couldn't debug it. As last resort I compared working LTSP in Ubuntu 12 with broken LTSP in Ubuntu 14. There was one difference in nbd-server configuration with nbd authentication.\nFile:  /etc/nbd-server/conf.d/ltsp_i386.conf\nNonworking config:\n[/opt/ltsp/i386]\nexportname = /opt/ltsp/images/i386.img\nreadonly = true\nauthfile = /etc/ltsp/nbd-server.allow\n\nWorking config:\n[/opt/ltsp/i386]\nexportname = /opt/ltsp/images/i386.img\nreadonly = true\n\nThen: service nbd-server restart\nIt has been working for couple of days without issues.\nUPDATE: \nThe above procedure may not solve your problem (as it turned out, my problems are not solved either). I'd like to share with you some Tips that could help you debugging your problems. Still.. I'm sure that the nbd-server is causing the issue.\nOn the LTSP server do a command: netstat -c  or netstat -c | grep nbd . Watch what happens with the nbd connections. When client connects to nbd, the port is being opened (let's say XYZ). The connection gets status ESTABLISHED. Then reboot the client and pay attention at nbd tcp connection. It doesn't close at client shutdown. So when the second time the same client boots, the same nbd port (XYZ) is assigned to the client but that port is already taken by the clients first boot cycle. This is the reason for yout socket failed erros. For NBD specifics read:  http://nbd.sourceforge.net/ . I doesn't know why default configuration of nbd-server in Ubuntu 14 acts like this. In Ubuntu 12 default configuration was fine (i have working LTSP deployment on Ubuntu 12 for 8 months now). But theres an alternative of NFS.\nNBD differs fundamentaly from NFS. Ubuntu uses NBD, but Debian still uses NFS stating it is more stable and reliable. I have no errors with client booting on Debian LTSP server with NFS. \nSo my advice to you is either: 1) use LTSP with Debian with default NFS or 2) use LTSP on Ubuntu but switch NBD to NFS.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 looks too slow I installed Ubuntu 14.04 x64 on my PC.\n\n\n*\n\n*E5500 Dual core 2.8Ghz Processor,\n\n*4GB RAM,\n\n*GT610 1GB Graphic card,\n\n*80 GB Hard Disk (for Ubuntu), 500GB Hard disk (Windows 8)\n\n\nEverything is slow.

Install Windows\n2. Install Ubuntu\nThe GRUB bootloader detects other OS at install.\nAlso make sure if you are installing from USB make sure the bootloader doesn't get installed on your USB stick.

Almost seems like a driver issue with my graphics card. I can't even launch a terminal. I can however hold ctrl/alt F1 and access terminal that way. Any help is much appreciated. Thanks.\n\nA: I'm an Ubuntu newbie moving over from Windows XP!\nI just upgraded from Ubuntu 13 to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 32-bit, laptop with dual monitors.\nWhile doing the upgrade my system got stuck on the black Ubuntu logo loading screen for an hour or two. I eventually had to do a hard shutdown.\nRestarting the computer, I as able to get to the Ubuntu OS, I could see my desktop background and was able to use my wireless mouse to move the cursor between the two screens. No launcher, no GUI. Again, I was only able to do a hard shutdown\nI was able to login using recovery mode and could use my laptop as usual (dual monitors, internet etc) but extremely slow.\nThe next day, by accident, I started up the laptop forgetting to plug the power board into the power supply. It started up and loaded Ubuntu 14.04 perfectly!!\nI plugged it in, my 2nd monitor turned on, and was mirroring my laptop. I opened up System Settings, and instantly my 2nd monitor remembered my previous settings.\nIt works great now, but starting up with the 2nd monitor turned off is just a work-around for now. \n\nA: This just happened to me. Now, if you use ubuntu 11.10 or before, it is very easy to change but if you have ubuntu 12.04 or later, finding out how to do this is a nightmare. All you have to do is get the launcher image. to do so, enter\ncd && wget -O Ubuntu.po http://drive.noobslab.com/data/Mac-14.04/change-name-on-panel/ubuntu.po\n\nNow you have to copy the image to /usr/share/unity/5. enter\nsudo nautilus\n\nand copy the launcher_bfb.png to usr/share/unity/5\nlogout login and done! :D\nand Also if you find a launcher image for ubuntu 12.04 then please post the link. Thank you and your welcome ;)\n\nA: I had the same problem, also with mint17 (a little different). After install both systems, first on mint changing the viedeodriver to nividia 3.04 mint was fine.\nSecond starting vom boot menue ubuntu 14.041. boot grub rescuce, then resume. ubuntu came up correct after login. (IF you make ashutdown the problem persist.) Repeat it twice.\nThe next trial like above I made the change of the grafikdriver like it did it on mint and all updates. Now ubuntu works nomally. So my conclusion is, that the grafikdriver on the orginal ubuntu-system ist the problem. Many of my friends have this problem to. \n", "Q: QML: How do you toggle boolean? In QML, how do you toggle boolean non explicitly?\nFor example:\nWhenever a button is pressed, a boolean property will simply switch to its other value. \nIf false, it will be come true. \nIf true, it will become false.\n\nA: Using just JavaScript:\nOnClicked {\n    checkbox.checked = !checkbox.checked\n}\n\n\nA: I don't know if there's a magic method for QML/Qt, but I usually just use a \"toggle_it\" function in python that looks something like:  \ndef toggle_it_cb(the_bool):\n  the_bool = not the_bool\n  return the_bool\n\nmy_bool = False\nmy_bool = toggle_it_cb(my_bool)\nprint(my_bool)\nmy_bool = toggle_it_cb(my_bool)\nprint(my_bool)\n\nIt could be done better if it were a class attribute.  No need to return to assign, etc.  \nAlmost every language ever has a negation operator (usually !() or similar).\n", "Q: Unity notifications messed up after installing Gnome I made a fresh installation of Ubuntu 14.04 and then decided to try Gnome and installed its packages. I didn't like it and came back to using to Unity.\nAfter this experiment the notifications became messed up. For the text messages they appeared in the plain text mode without any borders, in a plain rectangle in the different part of the screen. Also the notifications of the change of volume and brightness are also gone. Where can I restore them? I checked the content of:\n/usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Notifications.service\n[D-BUS Service]\nName=org.freedesktop.Notifications\nExec=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/notify-osd\n\n\nA: It seems there is no priority or a single setting point to set which freedesktop notification daemon to run. I got such problem with XFCE installed on Ubuntu 14.04.\nUnity notification launch xfce4-notifyd (XFCE styled notifications) as it was  the default.\n\n\n*\n\n*Check for available notification services, example:\n$ grep -r org.freedesktop.Notifications /usr/share/dbus-1/services/\n/usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.xfce.xfce4-notifyd.Notifications.service:Name=org.freedesktop.Notifications\n/usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Notifications.service:Name=org.freedesktop.Notifications\n\n\n*Disable non needed ones, leave only the one you want, add a name extension suffix .disable:\nsudo mv /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.xfce.xfce4-notifyd.Notifications.service /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.xfce.xfce4-notifyd.Notifications.service.disable\n\npkill xfce4-notifyd\n\n\n*Check\nnotify-send test\n\nIf there is no Gnome service file /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.gnome.Notifications.service. Try adding notify-osd to start up applications. See How do I start applications automatically on login?. DBUS will try to launch the service only if there is no process already took that bus address ownership (org.freedesktop.Notifications).\n\nA: You shouldn't really be using unity notifications with GNOME anyway. GNOME has it's own notifications system. You need to use that.\nThe concept is that you either use:\n\nGNOME\nUnity\nKDE \nXFCE \nLDXE\n\nAlthough there is a little crossover here and there, the messaging systems tend to be built into the compositor most of the time.\nEDIT: this is not exactly an answer but it was too long for the comment, sorry. I had not realised I already posted one.\nIn short. There's not enough information to make it possible to help at the moment. It could be anything really.\nDo you know how to get a stacktrace with gdb? It's worth getting one and posting it in a paste to here so people can take a look at the problem.\nIf you are not sure how to use gdb a quick check of the logs is to run:\n/var/log | grep -rn \"(EE)\" \nthen try the same replacing \"(EE)\" with with \"(WW)\" and failed should mean something useful comes up for one of these. Then it will be easier to answer the question.\nYou may also wish to check synaptic package manager under 'broken' packages just in case something comes up there\nEDIT:\nIt is still hard to tell without knowing more of the problem but, what it seems like is that you are still missing some sort of dependency. So, in that case try this:\nsudo apt-get build-deps unity\n\nand other unity related stuff you need (sorry I don't use unity so I would not know the usual list a person normally installs to complete the environment but at a guess I'd say there's an associated control center, compositor, display manager: things like that).\n", "Q: how to fix: no unity, no launcher no dash in ubuntu 14.04 I have two computers.

I have already updated nvidia drivers. tried reinstalling unity and desktop but no effect. I even tried sudo dconf reset -f /org/comiz/ but the outcome was Unable to launch D-Bus without X11 $Display. \n\nA: I would like to thank all people who gave me suggestion. I used all of them. But sorry to say nothing actually worked. It appears that there is the problem with upgrade itself. Ultimately i created a live usb. Surprisingly my system which has nvidia graphics card and 8 gb ram with intel cor i3 processor booted without the nvidia drivers. I created the 64 bit version and did a fresh install using this stick. And now i have a perfectly running system without using any extra drivers. If anyone has data locked in ubuntu partition then i would suggest that you do a fresh install with the option of retaining the existing operating system. this would install the new ubuntu on a partition carved out of existing ubuntu partition. the data would now be available just as another mount. you can extract the data and then go to the disk manager to delete that partition. be clear that deletion of that partition would break grub. for repairinggrub you need the boot-rejpair tool . This question has been answered on this forum.\nPlease excuse me for my lack of technical language. I am a simple user who has learnt ubuntu through forums like this only.\n\nA: This is an incomplete answer, but may help you or others.\nI had the same problem and did a fresh install after backing up my data. But when enabling the newest nvidia driver I begun to see some problems with openGL. So I think that if you switch back to Xorg tempromerly or the older nvidia drivers you may be able to bring yourself back, if you haven't messed up too much.\n", "Q: Themes and wallpapers are different in login screen and user screen!

So I guess I will go ahead for now and run 13.10 as VM in virtual box, but I have a question regarding the installation: when the install gets to the part that inquires about on what disk to select there are 4 options. The first offers to \"erase disk and install Ubuntu\" and the last allows the user to do \"something else\" as shown in this link:\nhttp://www.wikihow.com/Image:Install-Ubuntu-on-VirtualBox-Step-30.jpg\nI created the virtual disk 'xubu13-10.vdi' on partition 'sdb7' so I assume the first option, \"erase disk and install Ubuntu\" refers to 'sdb7'. When I select the \"something else\" option, only 'sda' is listed, and I cannot seem to select anything else, like sdb and sdb7 in particular. This looks sort of scary since I do not want the install to do anything on 'sda' whatsoever.\nThe confusion for me arises from the fact that when I last installed xubu, 10.04 I think, that 4th option to do \"something else\" allowed the user to manually select the partition on which to install, allowing one to be crystal clear about where xubu would be installed. I guess if someone could just verify that the first option, \"erase disk and install ubuntu\" will erase only the partition, sdb7, I selected when setting up the 'vdi' then I am set to go.   \n\nA: By creating a .VDI file you had created a virtual container to hold your virtual machine's OS. \nThis container will be presented to the Ubuntu installer as a hard disk ready for formatting and installing the OS. Because you likely only had attached one virtual drive to your machine it is presented as /sda to your virtual machine's Ubuntu.\nOn installation the VDI-file only will be partitioned and formatted. Only if you had attached a real partition to your virtual machine you need to worry about data on that partition. This is a more complicated process. It will not be done by default from a GUI-supported installation of a virtual machine in Virtual Box.\nAlso see How to install Ubuntu on VirtualBox?\n", "Q: Toshiba Satellite P850 FN-Keys not working I could solve several other issues with my laptop thanks to this forum.

First download dconf-editor:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-editor\n\nThen open DASH and look for dconf. \nAfter opening go to: org -> gnome -> nautilus -> preferences\n\nAnd here you can change the enable-interactive-search option. In my case I disabled the option because is more intuitive. I simply start typing and I am done with it.\nAs you can see from this way, it is the same thing as the terminal:\ngsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.preferences enable-interactive-search false\n\nI should also mention that you can \"Double Tab\" your way using the terminal line. What I mean with this is if you type:\ngsettings\n\nand then press SPC and then TAB you will be greeted with the options for gsettings, one of which is the set option used:\n\nif we used the set option and press SPC then TAB we will keep on getting all options related to what the actual configuration of that configuration database is.

Luckily, the developers have retained this - but you'll need to delve into the terminal to re-enable this capability through the following terminal entry\ngsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.preferences enable-interactive-search false\n\nNaturally - if after experimenting you want to go back to the tried and trusted 12.04 capability you can reset via:\ngsettings set org.gnome.nautilus.preferences enable-interactive-search true\n\n", "Q: How to have a clean *ubuntu and Awesome WM?

The former driver was rejected as not compatible with the 64-bit. I found that other driver and when I wanted to install it in the terminal with sh I was called first to stop the x-server. It cannot be installed with running x-server.\nSo how do I install them?\n\nA: You can download the driver for your video card for Ubuntu 64bit from here. Assuming that you are using Ubuntu 64bit now. If you installed Ubuntu 32 bit, there is 331 version of the same driver for Ubuntu 32bit. Save your driver somewhere where you can easily access it, like your user home directory or inside a newly created nvidia  directory in your user home directory.\nTo be able to install your nvidia driver you have to remove your previous video driver with this code in a terminal window:\n    sudo apt-get remove nvidia* && sudo apt-get autoremove\n\nAfter you finish with this one, you should also blacklist the nouveau driver by editing this file with either:\n    gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf\n\nor\n    sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf\n\n…and add these lines at the end:\n    blacklist nouveau\n    blacklist lbm-nouveau\n    options nouveau modeset=0\n    alias nouveau off\n    alias lbm-nouveau off\n\nIf, by any chance, there is no blacklist-nouveau.conf present in /etc/modprobe.d/, you can save your file as blacklist-nouveau.conf when prompted.\nAnd you can also disable the Kernel Nouveau by typing these lines in a terminal window:\n    echo options nouveau modeset=0 | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/nouveau-kms.conf\n\nand after that\n    update-initramfs -u\n\nNow you can reboot your computer, and when you get to the login prompt, press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to exit to the terminal console. Login with your username and password.\nGo to the directory where you saved your nvidia driver using the command cd in the terminal console. Eg. cd nvidia considering that you are already in your user home directory after you login. You can use command dir to be able to see your exact driver's name.\nTo stop your display manager or the X server, you can type in the console this code:\n   sudo stop lightdm   or\n\n   sudo lightdm stop\n\nIf you are not using lightdm as your default display manager (DM), replace lightdm with your default display manager, which can be either kdm or gdm or whatever your display manager is.\nYou should get a message in the terminal console saying --> lightdm stopped/waiting\nAnd now you can finally install the nvidia driver using a code similar to this one:\n  sudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64.....run    (for Ubuntu 64bit)  \n\nor\n  sudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86.....run    (for Ubuntu 32bit)\n\nIf you don't type the exact name of the driver, you'll get this message: NVIDIA-Linux... could not be found and you should type again the code for installing the driver.\nNvidia installer automatically installs the driver, and at the end it will ask you whether you want to save your new X configuration. Press Yes. After reboot and getting to your desktop and changing your NVIDIA settings as you please you should open a terminal window and type in this code:\n  sudo nvidia-xconfig\n\nto save your new nvidia configuration in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.\nNote\nYou might need to install some extra software packages if nvidia installer gives an error and prompts for missing dependencies:\n    sudo apt-get install dkms fakeroot build-essential linux-headers-generic\n\nBut you need to install all these missing packages only if nvidia-installer can't do the job by itself.\nIt can happen that after reboot your system shows a black screen or enters the low graphics mode. To fix this you should exit again to the console terminal, login with your username and password, and use the code provided above  sudo nvidia-xconfig and also make use of the following tutorial. It is meant to fix the greeter assuming that they haven't fixed this bug in Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: Since most of these answers are outdated...  Here is modern way to install the nvidia drivers for Ubuntu (for 14.04 and newer):\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the graphics-drivers ppa\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n*Install the recommended driver\nsudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall\n\n\n*Restart your system\nsudo reboot\n\n\nTo select a different driver, or if the above doesn't work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the graphics-drivers ppa\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n*Purge any existing nvidia related packages you have installed\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia*\n\n\n*Check which drivers are available for your system\nubuntu-drivers devices\n\n\n*Install the recommended driver\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-361\n\n\n*Restart your system\nsudo reboot\n\n\nA: I'm using geforce gt820m. \nI have tried almost all the suggestions above, but none worked for me. However, combining what I learned from above with other many online resources like here, This is how I went about mine.\nYou'll eventually end up with something like this, should you follow these steps.\n\nFirst of all, reset everything to default. How?\nUninstal any nvidia things\nsudo apt-get --purge remove nvidia*\n\nBlow xorg Edgers ppa away\nIn your \"Other Softwares\" tab, uncheck the Xorg Edgers PPA, to look like in below image. That ppa caused me so much pain than good.\n\nThen allow the packages to be updated when prompted to or let ...\nsudo apt-get update\n\n...do the rest.\nIts about time\nGo back to additional drivers, and you should see only one Nvidia binary listed (at least for my card, that's what was listed, instead of the two that showed when the xorg edges ppa was active )\nWhat was/is the difference? The drivers showed by the xorg edgers ppa are open source. The one which now shows has the indication proprietary. In this case, proprietary rocks, so please go with it, unless you wanna mess your head around for the next hours without success.\nSwitch from the x.org x server to the nvidia binary and apply. It should take a bit of time to apply (it took a bit of time on my end here, and I realized it downloaded some packages in the process). Restart your computer when its done.\nTroubleshooting\nIf you added anything different from the default to either /etc/default/grub or have made changes to /etc/X11/xorg.conf , please reset them to their defaults. You should be smart to know what you added and take it away.\nAfter reverting all your changes to these two areas, please update these:\nsudo update-initramfs -u\nsudo update-grub\n\nThe above two commands will ensure the changes you made to the above file, especially the one in /etc/default/grub is applied on next reboot. Failing to apply the update commands kept me stuck with whatever changes I made to the grub file, even after reboots.\nFor the xorg.conf file, you can delete it from that folder (you're free to make a backup of it)\nIf you are not seeing a good resolution, be sure to do \nsudo nvidia-xconfig\n\nRestart your PC then.\nIf you're feeling excited, you can delete nouveau from your PC by simply\nsudo apt-get remove xserver-xorg-video-nouveau\n\nI won't recommend you remove the nouveau, but I did though :P\nDoing the steps above got me up and running again with nvidia driver after several hours of try and error. \nAny Issues?\nYes. For some reasons I do not know yet, running many applications causes the PC to freeze. Ctrl + Alt + F1 gets me the chance to re-spawn the lightdm, but why the freeze happens is a mystery for me now. Any assistance is much appreciated.\n\nA: You can install additional drivers for nVidia graphics adapters (and for other hardware) with ubuntu-drivers-common (formerly jockey). Apparently hardware detection and driver management is now done through a command-line interface:\nsudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall\n\nFor details see https://askubuntu.com/a/9465/175814.\n\nA: I have had a lot of issues with NVIDIA and Ubuntu 14.04. But eventually, I managed to install it. I have Acer Aspire laptop with Nvidia GeForce 820M.\nHere how it goes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install nvidia-331. I did it through Synaptic Package Manager. But I guess \n\n\n\n$ sudo apt-get install nvidia-331\n\nwill work as well. I did NOT perform sudo apt-get install nvidia-331-updates. I did NOT perform any additional disabling of the nouveau driver.\n\n\n*\n\n*Then I rebooted the system.\n\n*I have downloaded cuda_5.5.22_linux_64.run from NVidia web page and extracted to separate files: \n$ chmod 755 cuda_5.5.22_linux_64.run\n$ ./cuda_5.5.22_linux_64.run -extract=/home/user/Downloads/cuda-5.5\n$ ls \ncuda-linux64-rel-5.5.22-16488124.run    NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-319.37.run cuda-samples-linux-5.5.22-16488124.run\n\n$ sudo sh cuda-linux64-rel-5.5.22-16488124.run\n$ sudo sh cuda-samples-linux-5.5.22-16488124.run\n\n\n*Then I compiled 1_Utilities/deviceQuery and it worked. And then I compiled the 0_Simple/matrixMul and it worked as well. Be sure to set $PATH and $LD_LIBRARY_PATH.\nI have tried to follow the same path with cuda 6.0.

I got stuck with it because for some reason, in ubuntu gnome 14.04.1 amd64, installing any nvidia proprietary driver has the result of gnome shell being unable to load successfully. Although, if you use optirun glxspheres64 or primusrun glxspheres64 the fps is very low, in games it appeears to be vary robust. I play NFS World and WOT and the performance is quite better than using nvidia 331 with bumblebee.\n", "Q: SSH Permission denied (public key), but root ssh works I'm trying to setup ssh access for a user account that I created with chef on a DigitalOcean Ubuntu 12.04 server.

However, after I put my Ubuntu credentials into it, it keeps showing up.\n\nA: After I read that signon-ui is a package related to Online Accounts, I removed all my accounts from Online Accounts. There were only two accounts, and both are Yahoo accounts. After that, those annoying dialogs dissapeared.\nI stored those accounts in Online Accounts for Empathy. So I think I can't use Empathy.\n\nA: I have also found a fix for this. In my case, it was also a Yahoo account in Online Accounts which was the culprit.\nSymptoms of a faulty Yahoo account in Online Accounts manifest as the following:\nWhen you go to System Settings > Online Accounts, click on your Yahoo Account in left column, then click on \"Edit Options\", there will be NO information displayed - window will be blank instead of the expected username & password fields.\nTo fix a faulty Yahoo account in Online Accounts you need to delete the account and re-add it:\nGo to System Settings > Online Accounts, click your Yahoo Account in left column, click \"Remove Account\", then click \"+ Add account...\"\nThe username & password fields will display as expected and you can fill out your account info.\nCongratulations, the \"Enter your credentials\" popup is now gone when you reboot.\n", "Q: \"dpkg: trying to overwrite '.../gsettings/gnome-settings-daemon.convert also in package gnome-settings-daemon\" when upgrading to Trusty While upgrading to 14.04 I ran into a dependency issue gnome-settings-daemon-schemas which blocked the upgrade.

Not only had to remove the Gnome repository I manually added to stay on the bleeding edge, but also purge all the Gnome packages that could have gotten in the way (i.e. came from that repository) and then, after apt-get update installed gnome-shell version from the Trusty repos, which of course, brought in all its dependencies, including gnome-settings-daemon-schemas.

My upgrade from 13 to 14 was a resonable success with no issues that I could tell. \nI have even tried a suggestion on a website to download the package and edit something called the Package CONTROL File however I have had no success. \n\nA: The closest match to the missing libqt5core5 package in Ubuntu 14.04 is libqt5core5a (Qt 5 core module). The libqt5core5 package in Ubuntu 13.10 has the identical package description: Qt 5 core module. libqt5core5 and libqt5core5a are approximately the same size and they also have the same dependencies. The names of the installed files for libqt5core5 are the same (except for version numbers) as their counterpart matching installed files in libqt5core5a.

So when you type java -version, it is looking in the JDK folder.  Note that java is actually inside $JAVA_HOME/bin.   That's why it can't find it.\nThat's the explanation.\nThe fix is to either add it to the $PATH properly:\nexport PATH=$PATH:JAVA_HOME/bin\n\nor to run update-alternatives and add the JDK path to the system's java alternatives.\nFor example\nupdate-alternatives --install \"/usr/bin/java\" \"java\" \"/home/myuser/sandbox/java/7u55/jdk1.7.0_55/bin/java\" 3\n\n\nA: First, you have a typo in export line. It should be \nexport PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin\n\nNo space, add a $ character before JAVA_HOME, add /bin\nHowever fixing above line may not fix your problem in installing java. The easiest way to install java is by using webup8 ppa: \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer\n\nAfter the last command, the script will automatically download the jdk from Oracle website and install it for you.

I know, I know, it's not a powerful card, but with the Gallium driver it seems like I won't be able to play any games. And don't get me wrong, I don't want to play AAA games, I was hoping to play Team Fortress II and that kind of stuff...\nNow to get to the point.\nI've downloaded the latest display driver (13.1) for my card from AMD site. I've tried running the .run file in terminal, and when I chose to install the driver, a message popped out saying that one or more packages required for installation have not been found. \nThen I did the following:\nsudo sh (drivername).run --buildpkg Ubuntu/trusty\n\nAfter that, I installed the .deb package that was generated (don't remember the command).\nBefore the reboot, I entered\naticonfig --initial\n\nAfter reboot, I was not logged in my account, instead I was at the login screen.

I have the server connected to my main network router via WiFi, and I have a switch connected to the server by wire where I've plugged in some clients. These clients are to be able to play the music stream from the multicast source.\nWhen I configure the network in this respect, I find the wireless network crumbles. I think this is because the router gets loaded, because the same thing happens when I connect the server playing the multicast stream to the router by wire.\nSo, instead of crowding my main network, I would like to create a separate, wired network with the server that keeps the multicasting separate from the main wireless network. However, the added complication is that the server needs an internet connection to be able to receive the music stream which it will then multicast.\nI've managed to configure a DHCP server on the home server, and have connected clients get assigned IP addresses properly, but it then blocks access to the web. In other words, any requests that would need to go via the home server's wireless link don't get sent there.\nIs there a way to selectively decide which DHCP server to use (either the home server or the router)?\nOr can anyone think of a better way of doing this altogether?\nI've got isc-dhcp-server installed and running.\nHere is /etc/network/interfaces:\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# the network for multicasting\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\n        address 10.0.0.1\n        netmask 255.255.255.0\n        gateway 10.0.0.1\n        broadcast 10.0.0.255\n\n# the web connection\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet dhcp\nwpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf\n\nAnd /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server:\nINTERFACES=\"eth0\"\n\nAnd /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf:\ndefault-lease-time 600;\nmax-lease-time 7200;\noption subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;\noption broadcast-address 10.0.0.255;\noption routers 10.0.0.254;\noption domain-name-servers 10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2;\noption domain-name \"musicnet\";\n\nsubnet 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {\n        range 10.0.0.10 10.0.0.100;\n}\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nA: Turns out I just had to remove the lines\n        gateway 10.0.0.1\n        broadcast 10.0.0.255\n\nfrom /etc/network/interfaces.

Just as the title says, I'm using a wireless Logitech keyboard, and I want to ensure that my keystrokes are in fact encrypted. On Windows, I could do that very easily by using the Logitech SetPoint software, pressing a key sequence (Ctrl+Alt+F12), pressing the Connect button on the keyboard, and typing in an encryption key that's displayed on the monitor. Set and done!\nHow do I do the same on Ubuntu Linux?\nHere is a screentorial on Windows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: There is a graphical tool called Solar. It can also show many details of logitech devices. If it shows you an unencrypted connection, you can (if your keyboard is supported) use it to pair them properly.\nPlease check first if your keyboard is supported. There is a list and instructions on the website. Generally, Solar supports all unifying reciever devices and some of the others.\nhttps://pwr.github.io/Solaar/\n\nA: Go through the pdf document , you will understand how a wireless keyboard works and what all security feature are built to the wireless devices to avoid eavesdropping. \nhttp://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-dc-08/Moser/Whitepaper/bh-dc-08-moser-WP.pdf\nAnd about the encryption software logitech setpoint , when checked there's no support provided by the logitech to my knowledge, but as a alternate you can  use a HIDPoint (freeware).\n\nA: \nI guess one either has to use wired keyboards on Linux or not give a damn about wireless security of keystrokes.\n\nYou're heading in the wrong direction. I remember this feature from older keyboards I used during the 2000s and I thought this didn't survive the migration to Sepoint, I'm surprised to see that it did. (I also remember issues with older Logitech drivers in conjunction with Creative soundcards on Windows and each company blaming the other in their respective forums, gotta love those constructive days.) Anyways who claimed that this encryption from the late 90s or early 2000s is state of the art and secure?\nIf you worry about security look at the current state of the art: Logitech's unifying technology and Bluetooth starting with 2.1 seems to be safe, but encryption on some older Microsoft devices has been cracked.\n", "Q: i cant update 13.10 to 14.04 i try to update my os today 13.10 to 14.04 and i have this error\n\nThird party sources disabled \nSome listings have disabled third file souces.list.

Of course, it would be nice if all of the hardware works (i.e., webcam, etc.) but if they don't, I'm not too worried about it.  What I am worried about is a computer which can't even accept Ubuntu (i.e., grub won't correctly install).  I heard that there was a period where computers were being manufactured which contained Windows and nothing else could be installed on top of.\nI'd like to dual boot it (i.e., with Windows), but if that isn't possible, that is fine.\nAnyway, does anyone know what is this limitation called so that I can search for it with Google?  Or does anyone know off-hand if the current laptops (i.e., running Windows 8.1) can accept grub?  I vaguely recall that this was a problem with Windows 7-era computers, but I am not too sure.\n\nA: \nI heard that there was a period where computers were being manufactured which contained Windows and nothing else could be installed on top of.\n\nThe terms to do a keyword search for this are lock-in, UEFI lock-in and locked bootloader.\n\n...if the current laptops (i.e., running Windows 8.1) can accept grub?\n\nYes, most current laptops can accept GRUB, but there are a few laptop models which can't accept GRUB. There is a bug surrounding the UEFI implementation on certain laptops which caused them to be bricked after installing a Linux distribution in UEFI mode. That's how important it is to check the laptop model's compatibility with Linux before you buy. For more information about how to install Ubuntu as a dual boot OS on a Windows 8 laptop see: Installing Ubuntu on a Pre-Installed Windows 8 (64-bit) System (UEFI Supported).\n\nOf course, it would be nice if all of the hardware works\n\nYou can make a bootable USB from the Ubuntu installation ISOs, and then try out an Ubuntu live session instead of installing Ubuntu to check if all the computer's hardware devices work as expected in Ubuntu. Running an Ubuntu live session will not install anything on the computer's hard disk.\n\nA: You could have a look at sytstem 76 computers. They come preinstaled with ubuntu and you could buy windows 7 and 8.1 and install it alongside.\n\nA: I would recommend looking at Dells XPS 13: you can get them preloaded with Ubuntu (or install it later without any problems) and it's a really great peace of hardware (Mark Shuttleworth himself is using one).\nIn terms of current (UEFI) Notebooks: you will have to google for the name of that model + Ubuntu to get information about compatibility.\n\nA: I'd check out the linlap.com site for user experiences on installing Linux on a laptop.

All one need do is install Synaptic Package Manager, possibly by using the default package manager. Then, in the search box, type exfat. When I did this, only two items came to view in the list: exfat-utils and exfat-fuse. Now, put a check mark in both of these boxes by clicking with the mouse pointer (actually, I ticked the top one, and I got a message that both are required. When I closed the pop-up message, both boxes were ticked for me). Then, click apply. When the installation completed (very quickly and easily), I then opened my file manager. In the upper left I clicked the micro SD card that was previously not mountable. Immediately, the contents of the card displayed for the first time, since formatting the card to exFAT. I only had a test text file in it at the time, to help me determine what was going on. Now, everything is perfect, and I don't have to manually do anything (like mount and unmount). It is all automatic, like with cards formatted to FAT32. VOILA !!!   All is well, now. Enjoy !

Then it slowly fades in. Totally destroyed my confidence in Ubuntu as a viable alternative to WinXp. This has been an ongoing thing with Linux actually being a operating system for normal people and not just for geeks. Until A normal non geek can actually just install a working version without having to resort to the command line to actually get stuff to work. It will not be used by anyone other than the geeks that like to play around with the OS. I wanted to give this system to a NORMAL person ( non geek) but now - I will just have spend another couple of hours trying to reinstall the older v12 or to go back to Windows because they don't have the technical know how to jump through the hoops to get Ubuntu to actually work. They don't want to 'play' with the OS, they just want to run fairly standard programs.\n\nA: Ubuntu is likely not the best solution for an older computer as Unity, it's desktop environment is primarily designed for more recent computers. Xubuntu is the better solution for older computers, it used XFCE which is a much lighter desktop environment. It can be found at http://xubuntu.org.\nFor reference, Ubuntu, Ubuntu Gnome and Kubuntu generally are not suitable for older systems as Unity (Ubuntu), Gnome (Ubuntu Gnome) and to a lesser extent KDE (Kubuntu) desktop environments take up more system resources. Where as Xubuntu and Lubuntu will usually run well as XFCE (Xubuntu) and LXDE (Lubuntu) take up far less system resources but are not as flashy either.\nMy suggestion is that is your system supports PAE then Xubuntu will likely be ideal. If the Xubuntu liveCD will not boot, your system likely does not support PAE so try Lubuntu.\n", "Q: Am I running 32-bit or 64-bit? I know this question has been asked a number of times, but my system seems to contradict itself…\nFollowing the answer to this question, I have run the following:\n$ uname -a\nLinux manaha 3.13.7-x86_64-linode38 #1 SMP Tue Mar 25 12:59:48 EDT 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n$ file /sbin/init\n/sbin/init: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=0xc0d86a25a7abb14cad4a65a1f7d03605bcbd41f6, stripped\n\nSo, while uname seems to suggest 64-bit, /sbin/init suggests 32-bit.  What's happening here?\n\nA: In computing, the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) is a common standard file format for executables, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps. In your question /sbin/init: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object identifies ELF as the format for a 32-bit shared object from a shared library. Your operating system is a 64-bit OS that has a 32-bit shared object somewhere in it. There is no contradiction in this.\n\nA: While the uname command tells you something about your system, the file command tells you something about a file. So the file command says \"init\" is a 32-bit file and the uname command says you have a 64-bit computer. I hope this helps.\n\nPlease point out any mistakes I made as fast as possible, just in case it causes any harm.\n\nPS did you read the other answers to the post you're linking to?

It also reminded me to disable SecureBoot in BIOS.\nI disabled SecureBoot, but nothing had changed.  Windows still booted, just like before.\n\n*I booted from the live cd again and opened my grub file.\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nThe grub file came up, I added a # in front of GRUB_HIDDEN-TIMEOUT=0, saved, and in the terminal wrote:\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis comes backs:\n/usr/sbin/grub-probe: error: failed to get canonical path of '/cow'.\n\nAnd that's as far as I've gotten.

You could also use SuperGrubDisk\nhttp://www.supergrubdisk.org/wizard-restore-grub/\nI'm no expert but I suspect that EFI blocked Grub from being put on the MBR.\n\nA: use advanced options(at left bottom) in boot-repair not the recommended\nopen advanced options in boot-repair\nin advanced options=>main options (no changes needed)\nadvanced options=>GRUB location (select \"place grub into\" select \"sda\")\nadvanced options=>GRUB options (select \"Purge grub before reinstalling it\")\nadvanced options=>Other options (unselect the \"Repair Windows boot files\" & \"Check internet connection\"if they are selected)\nthis might overwrite your windows boot-loader with grub, then u can select the OS from grub boot-loader\n\nA: Login as usual into your account and then type this in terminal\n(for terminal press Ctrl+Alt+T):\nsudo update-grub\n\nAfter this you'll find in the last line the name of the other OS (In your case Windows 8)\nAfter this, restart as usual and you'll find the dual boot menu.\n\nA: If you have Ubuntu properly installed (I run Xubuntu): when you start and you get to the Windows login screen, press SHIFT and hit \"Restart\".\nThis gets the machine to restart and to look for alternative options.\nSelect the \"boot from media\" option and Ubuntu should be there to be selected even though your disk or pendrive are no longer plugged in into the machine.\nWorked for me with Xubuntu 12.04 and Windows 10.\n\nA: If your bios is a UEFI bios then I would make sure to check in the BIOS that it set to boot to your GRUB efi file.\nThere should be a menu where you can pick what to boot to from your boot partition. Inside the boot partition should be a folder called GRUB. In that folder should be an efi file that will boot to GRUB.\nGood luck.\n\nA: Well actually that happened to me too when I installed Ubuntu with \"something else\" option . The thing that worked for me, Ubuntu is installed you just need to go to the boot menu (you can possibly access this menu by using F12 and choose UEFI boot mode)\nNow under boot device menu choose the option as Ubuntu.\nNow restart and it should work fine.\n\nA: Ashton,\nYou haven't been around for 3 1/2 years so you will never read this answer. It is for everyone else that finds this question. There are seven answers so far none with any up-votes.\nYou turned off secure boot after running boot-repair. You were supposed to turn off secure boot first and then run boot-repair. That is why it didn't work.\n", "Q: Putting Ubuntu on a Tablet Without USB I recently purchased an ASUS VivoTab Windows 8.1 tablet and, being the Linux enthusiast that I am, decided to install Ubuntu on it. Unfortunately, there are no USB or DVD drives, so I don't know what I'm supposed to install Ubuntu off of. I've already tried to format a MicroSD like an Ubuntu Live USB, but I can't seem to get the BIOS to let me boot off of the MicroSD. Any suggestions? I just need to install Ubuntu without using any kind of external drives. Alternately, I'm up for suggestions on the possibility of creating a Live MicroSD. Thanks.\n\nA: Use a Micro USB to USB cable/OTG should do the trick, plug the USB drive into it with Ubuntu or other distro 'burnt' onto it and it should be able to boot from it.

As stated, the fix above didn't work; after reboot, nothing happened. I even tried running crontab as root, but that did nothing.\n\nA: Ok, I think I solved the problem.  I'm going to leave my previous non-answer in place because I believe it has useful information.  Or at the very least it has keywords which will help people find this answer.\nThe problem was that noclobber was set in rc.local, so it wouldn't add disable to gpe10.  I solved that by adding two lines to rc.local.

Is where any way to \"cheat\" ubuntu into allowing me to use it?\n\nA: The / is a reserved character to indicate directories. A block for this is even included in our kernel. More details on stackoverflow. You can use another char that -looks- like a / though. From comments in the link:\n\nThere are plenty of other suitable candidates: ⁄ is U+2044 FRACTION SLASH; ∕ is U+2215 DIVISION SLASH; ⧸ is U+29F8 BIG SOLIDUS; ／ is U+FF0F  FULLWIDTH SOLIDUS, and ╱ is U+2571 is BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT DIAGONAL UPPER RIGHT TO LOWER LEFT. All would work admirably! \n\n\nA: You probably don't actually want to do this. As other people have said, / is the directory name separator (i.e., it separates directory names in a path). So if you think that you actually want / in a directory name because something is telling you to do it, you're probably misreading the instructions and/or the instructions are wrong. All the answers telling you how to 'fake' it are telling you how to do something you don't want to do, and won't help you anyway: even though a character might look like a forward slash, your OS won't treat it as one for the same reason that it treats 1 and l and I differently.\nAs 3Doubloons said in a comment, if documentation mentions a folder named mods/, what it actually means is a folder named mods. The fact that it's not finding it is an entirely separate issue.\n\nA: No. / is directory separator, like \\ and / in Windows.\nHowever, if you really want to use /, you can use similar characters. In my opinion, U+29F8 (BIG SOLIDUS) looks like a slash, and you can copy it from here. You can also modify the file system directly, but this is not recommended, and probably would confuse operating system a lot, because it would introduce ambiguities (is /bin/bash the file in current directory, or path to standard interpreter?).\n⧸\n\nThe best way however is avoiding / in file names. There are other characters you can use. For example, you can write & instead of / in certain cases (files/directories vs files&directories). This will make things less confusing.\n\nA: You cannot use / in a folder's name! There's no way Linux could make the difference between a subfolder in folder and single folder.\nRead more:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/1976007/what-characters-are-forbidden-in-windows-and-linux-directory-names\n", "Q: Guake behavior for other apps I use and love the guake terminal emulator, so I wonder if it is possible to get the toggle behavior to work for other applications.\nFor example I want to press F11 and my current running gVim instance should pop in in a defined location (or fullscreen).

I can not make it work nor find an official confirmation of compatibility. Oracle Java 7 plugin works fine with Firefox but fresh Chromium browser installation does not even list it at chrome://plugins\n\nA: They've dropped NPAPI plugin support in the latest version of Chromium, which means that it can't use the Firefox version of Flash or Java, which is also an NPAPI plugin. It does support PPAPI plugins, though. Flash has a PPAPI version, but Java doesn't, yet. \nChrome browser (not Chromium) still supports NPAPI, though. You can use Oracle Java and flashplugin-installer with it just like you can with Firefox.\n\nA: Linux NPAPI support is dropped in this and future versions of Chromium, it's not possible to install Java browser plugin until PPAPI implementation of Java plugin is released by Oracle or third party.\nCurrent version of NPAPI Oracle Java plugin can be used in Firefox at the moment and that is the only alternative I have found so far.\n", "Q: Mysql on Ubuntu 14.04 problem with AppArmor permissions for data directory I've been using MySQL with a different location for the database date since Ubuntu 12.04 and had no problems.\nMy configuration was like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Data in /home/db/mysql\n\n*Link in the default location sudo ln -s /home/db/mysql /var/lib/mysql\n\n*Added /home/db/** rwk, to /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld\nIt worked great until Ubuntu 14.04.

So many that I've lost the count. Anyway I have installed the three versions that I mentioned above and they all have the same issue and it is that the graphics are SUPER SLOW. Yet on Ubuntu 12.04 and even with Windows 8 the performance is smooth. I've learnt from what I've read so far that it is due to the graphics card or something because they appear not to pick up or to recognize my graphics card and they're using this: Gallium 0.4 on llvmpipe (LLVM 3.4, 128 bits)\nThis netbook has a closed-source driver which is the cedarview-dm or something like (I don't remember very well) I have an Asus 1015cx with a Intel® Atom™ CPU N2600 @ 1.60GHz × 4 processor. I need help. How do I solve this? It's just that everything runs very slowly. Thanks\n\nA: The Atom™ line of CPU's with the integrated Cedarview graphics are rather pathetic in terms of performance. I've used my Acer D270 netbook with 15.04 and it functions but I've never enjoyed the experience. (I'd rather use an I3 any day of the week). I would agree with @bodhi.zazen that moving to lubuntu or xubuntu would provide a far more acceptable experience. Since it's a netbook with integrated graphics upgrading the graphics card isn't an option in this case.\nSources: Experience,\nARK\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 boot hangs at \"EXT4-fs: mounted filesystem without journal\" I have just made a new Ubuntu 14.04 installation on a new SSD Drive for my server.\nPreviously I had a Ubuntu 12.04 installation that worked fine, but I have now changed harddrive to an SSD.\nThe installation process completes without any problem.

It's not from FFmpeg! This makes some users unhappy and some users feel misled.\n\n*The fake version (and also avconv) is buggy and lacks many features.\n\n*FFmpeg development is very active.\n\n*Compiling gives you the choice to customize the build the way you want it and to suit your needs. For example you can encode with libfdk_aac which is a great AAC encoder.\n\n*All of the guides, articles, and tutorials in the FFmpeg Wiki are for ffmpeg from FFmpeg and not guaranteed to work with any third-party counterfeits.\n\n\nIf you want some benefits of using a recent, real ffmpeg without needing to compile then you can download a static build from the FFmpeg Download page. No installation necessary: you just download, exract, and run. It has most of the useful features, but lacks x11grab support (for screen grabbing) and also lacks a few useful encoders.\n\n2) Have I spoiled everything with my unsuccessful compilation?\n\nNo. The guide is meant to be non-intrusive and non-interfering.

Running PHP scripts in user directories is disabled by default.  You will run into this problem if the script is in the public_html directory in your home folder and you are trying to access it from http://localhost/~your_username.\nTo fix this, open up /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php7.2.conf.

Using the mysqldump command is generally preferred, as it outputs to a text file using SQL which can be imported and executed cleanly by the new version.\nBetween 12.04 and 14.04, you probably won't see too many issues, but more dramatic changes can sometimes be a problem.

It allows you to increase it's size(ie, occupying the unallocated space).  \nNote: Backup your important datas before proceeding the above and also make sure that all the partitions are unmounted.\n\nA: I have done this with no problem, however the usual precaution is to backup everything first.\n\nA: Using a LiveCD is safer. I agree with C.S.Cameron that you should have a backup, because working with filesystems and partitions can destroy data.\nChanging the size of a partition is only part of what you need to do in order to make this space usable. \nOnce you expand the partition to use the unallocated space, you need to resize the filesystem (the ext4 aspect of this) to also include the new space. Fortunately, ext4 can be resized online.\nAfter you've expanded the partition, close gparted and open a terminal.\nsudo resize2fs /dev/sda3\n\nThis should tell your ext4 partition that it's bigger now, and allow it to use the new space.\nFor good measure, I'd reboot.\n", "Q: Error sending USSD Ubuntu 14.04 GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.UnknownMethod: No such interface 'org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.Modem.Modem3gpp.Ussd' on object at path /org/freedesktop/ModemManager1/Modem/2\n\nmodem manager GUI work properly in ubuntu 13.10 after upgrade to ubuntu 14.04 Can't send USSD.I have a huawei E158 usb router and ASUS N53T laptop, Help me to solve this problem.\nwhen i install ubuntu resevied this message! but i have latest bios \n\nA: Try updating the firmware.

Why can't APT install more than one application at a time? Why does it need to exit before installing the next.  I know with MS Windows you can install how many application at once.  This problem is not unique to Ubuntu but to all distros, that I have notice.\n\nA: That's because each package has specific details about how it can be installed.\nPost-processing for a package sometimes has follow up (symlinking, documentation generation, et cetera). Such processing may pre-depend on other processes having completed.\nThis isn't a Linux flaw. It's a \"computation\" flaw.

Windows is not immune from this.\n\nA: Both dpkg and RPM can handle more than one application install at a time.

That was ruled out because sometimes this happens just after it boots up.\nThe restarts are not bothersome enough to buy a new laptop nor are they too occasional to not consider it.\n\nA: Are the restarts truly \"random\"?\nI generally avoid laptops because I tend to do CPU heavy things like compiling source code, transcoding video, or light gaming which can sometimes tax the ingrated video chipsets on many laptops.\nIn nearly all of my experience with laptops, I came to find that I could usually hear my fans spin on before the \"random\" poweroffs.\nSystems are generally designed to power off when they reach high temperatures to avoid damaging the processors, the thermal paste on them, or the board they're seated on.\n", "Q: Ubuntu desktop settings menu replaced with one from ubuntu touch?

Ok I made a mistake. I was investigating on how to make it so that I could listen to music or watch videos when I wasn't using qjackctl after being connected to the computer. This is the youtube video I found jack and pulseaudio together as friends-linux. The problem that I ran into is he doesn't go into how to restart pulseaudio, he just says to do it. And so I did some more research on how and came up with this for the terminal:killall pulseaudio. Following this I typed pulseaudio  check. Now I no longer have a volume symbol in the top right of my computer and I cannot hear anything. Additionally, qjackctl and zyanaddsubfx no longer work.

Beginning Ubuntu user here.  I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 32-bit on an old Dell computer to replace Windows XP.  I like the interface, but I notice that it responds very slowly.  I suspect this is due to my older graphics card.  Is there a way I can disable some of the animation in the interface, or is there a version of Ubuntu that is less graphics-intensive?\n\nA: Considering that the machine was running Windows XP previously, you are probably looking for a \"lighter\" flavour of Ubuntu. It is possible to disable some animations and effects from Unity/Gnome, but depending on how old is the PC, it might not be enough to make it usable.\nXubuntu - XFCE Desktop Environment\nLubuntu - LXDE Desktop Environment\nThe XFCE environment has a good compromise between usability, performance and customization, when compared to Unity/GNOME. LXDE is another good alternative, that is somewhat \"lighter\" than XFCE, but it also lacks some customization and usability when compared to the former.\n", "Q: How do I bring back the initial 'stats page' (message of the day) after an upgrade to 14.04 server?

Is this safe? I like to keep all my servers running only the most stable versions of any operating system, so obviously I only run the LTS versions of Ubuntu.\nI currently have a few servers running Ubuntu server 12.04 LTS. I'd like to upgrade them to 14.04. Is it safe to jump versions like that, and how can this be done?\n\nA: It is generally recommended (read safer) that users of Ubuntu LTS wait until the first point release, due in July, before upgrading.\nTo upgrade from Ubuntu LTS on a server system (and Desktop too) before then, follow the steps listed below:\nEnsure you're up to date with latest updates for Ubuntu.\nBackup!

The upgrade was successful, but the issue is that nothing happens now when I click on \"LogOut\", \"Shutdown\", \"Suspend\" from the top  right power icon  (not sure if this is the proper name); \"Systems Settings\", on the other hand works and launchs the associated window. Not a big issue, though, since I can logout and shutdown from a terminal, but I'd like to know why is this not working and how can it be fixed. Any ideas on how to solve this? \n\nA: As Sylvain Pineau pointed out, it seems that you this bug affects you.\nThe best way you can enable shutdown/logout/suspend in the cogwheel menu is disabling starting cairo dock at startup and then manually starting it(you can type \"cairo dock on the dash and then click it to start cairo dock).\nAnother workaround for the moment until the bug gets fixed is using a keyboard shortcut to shutdown. For that open System settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts and set a \"Custom Shortcut\" as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click on +\n\n*Type \"Shut down\" ahead of \"Name\"\n\n*Type\ndbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.login1 /org/freedesktop/login1 \"org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.PowerOff\" boolean:true \n\nahead of \"Command\" and click \"Apply\"\n\n*Click on \"disable\" in front of the shortcut created and press the keystrokes you want to be set for shutting down, if they are already used, you'll be warned, if not you can use that keystore for shutting down without having to enter the password as you now do using sudo pm-poweroff.\nFor a list of other commands for rebooting, suspending and hibernating refer to this question:\n\n\n*\n\n*What command is executed when shutdown from the graphical menu in 14.04?\nYou can similarly create shortcuts for other commands.\n\nA: No need to remove cairo-dock from start-up applications, find cairo-dock.desktop file ~/.config/autostart and add this code,X-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=20\nSteps to solve easily (tested in Ubuntu 14.04)\n\n\n*\n\n*run gedit without root\n\n*click open file menu and press Ctrl+H\n\n*open file ~/.config/autostart/cairo-dock.desktop\n\n*add this\n\n\nX-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=20\n\n\n*\n\n*save and close\n\n*reboot your unity/gnome\nDelay time more than 20 works fine. \nsoure here\n\nA: In 14.04, such actions should use /org/freedesktop/login1 provided by systemd-logind. try to reinstall the indicator-session package.\nOpen a Terminal an type:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get purge indicator-session\nsudo apt-get install indicator-session systemd-services\n\nindicator-session roles are described here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SystemMenu\n\nA: Instead of Removing cairo dock from Startup Applications, you can also change when it starts up... I have found that 60 seconds (on my laptop at least) is sufficient time to allow for the system to start properly prior to starting cairo dock.  the following in the Command field will allow for delayed startup.  \nsh -c \"sleep 60; exec cairo-dock -o\"\n\nYou can play with the sleep time to minimize it based on the speed of your system :)\nThis allows the system to startup and the shutdown etc options still exist\n\nA: I saw this problem on different machines after upgrading from 12.04 to 14.04.\nTo fix I had to issue \nsudo pam-auth-update --force\nRelevant bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/policykit-desktop-privileges/+bug/1240336\n", "Q: How can I delete ubuntu from usb installer?

Have installed Ubuntu 14.04 on a virtual machine using VM Virtual Box.  Have installed all the updates from both Virtual Box and Ubuntu.\nProblem: While in Ubuntu's desktop and other Ubuntu initiated programs, the window is reduced to about 3x4 inches showing in the middle of the rest of my regular Virtual Box window.  I am seeing only the upper right hand of the screen output of what I would normally see.\nI've seen How do I install Guest Additions in a VirtualBox VM?\nBut, none of these answers works in 14.04.\n\nA: On virtualbox you have to install \"Guest Additions\". There is no need to set a resolution via Ubuntu settings. With your guest window in the foreground select from the top menu:\nVirtualBox -> Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD image\n\nIn Ubuntu open a terminal, navigate to cd folder (usually /media/VBOXADDITIONS*) and run \nsh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\n\nNote that you should have a working compiler gcc/g++\n\nA: I had the same problem. I fixed it by installing the guest additions as explained in the other answers and jacking the amount of video RAM in the settings as shown. \n\nA: I had the same problem as you. I did these steps, maybe helps you too:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System settings → Software and Updates → Additional drivers\n\n*Use x86 virtualization solutions...\n\n*After that reboot your VirtualBox\n\n\nMy VirtualBox is working perfectly.\n\nA: After having first tried installing the Guest additions, which didn't work, I found another solution elsewhere: linuxbsdos.com.\nUse Xdiagnose from the Dashboard. Search for and launch Xdiagnose, then enable all the options under the Debug section. Click the Apply button, then close the window and restart the system. \nThat's what finally did the trick! Now I get 1024 x 768 resolution instead of 640 x 480.\nI never uninstalled the Guest additions, so it might be I needed to take both these measures.\n\n---------- EDIT ---------\nI have come to realize that the solution described above is just a fallback, in case installing the Guest Additions failed for some reason. I have finally managed to successfully install them, and can now choose from a bigger range of resolutions in the display settings. Here is how I did it, after having tried all of the above.\nOne thing I had already tried earlier was\n\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-x11\n\nThis is not enough in itself, but might be a necessary prerequisite for the following steps (of which some might not be necessary...).\n\n\n*\n\n*Update Virtualbox to the latest version (currently 4.3.24)\n\n*In Terminal in the Guest system type:\n\n\n\n    sudo apt-get install dkms\n    sudo apt-get install build-essential module-assistant\n    sudo m-a prepare\n\nIf you have no top menu in the Guest system, it's because you're in scale mode which causes it to be hidden. In that case, press \nHost + C to toggle scale mode (where Host is Right Control by default)\n\n\n*In the Guest system, go to the top menu, and click Devices->Insert Guest Additions CD Image. This should mount the CD image.\n\n*In my case, Autostart worked, and the installation started with a prompt. If it doesn't autostart, you can do the following\n\n\n\n    cd /media/<username>/VBOXADDITIONS_4.3.10_93012\n    sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\n\nJust be sure to replace <username> by the logged in user's username.\nAnd then a restart, as JTIM pointed out...\n\nA: You basically need the Guest additions, log into the Virtual Machine to install the following packages:\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms\n\nFinally restart the VM to complete the installation.\n\nA: Developing from this answer, and in fact pretty well explained also in this other post. (I really tried everything else posted here but it does not seem to work on my Windows 7 system)\nPreliminary steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have installed the latest version of Virtual Box(*). Be careful that if you ask Virtual Box to update to the latest version it might very likely declare being updated even if a newer version exists!\n\n*It might be a good idea to start from a clean distribution, creating a new virtual machine, install there Ubuntu (I allowed downloading updated packages from the network during installation), and cloning it before proceeding, so that if you have troubles you can avoid restarting from the very beginning. \n\n*Install build-essential and linux-headers-generic packages. Apparently, it's also reccomended to install dkms, as \"Running DKMS in the guest OS will keep Guest Additions installed after a guest kernel update\".\nHow to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start your virtual machine\n\n*On Virtualbox menu -> Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD image...\n\n*From Ubuntu you should see a popup, allow the CD autorun to install the program. For me, like many times before, it said he could not find Linux headers but, this time, in the end everything went fine.\nIf the autorun does not work,  open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), navigate to folder (usually /media/VBOXADDITIONS*) and run \nsh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run\n\n*Shut down and then start again your virtual machine\n\n(*) If, like me, with the new version of the Virtual Box you have trouble with network, take a look at this video (In short: use Bridged network, and select \"allow VMs\")\n\nA: Sometimes, simple solution could be:\n\n\nA: I remained stuck for several days in low screen resolution in a Ubuntu 14.04 guest running on VirtualBox 4.1 on Debian Wheezy.

Before we proceed we may want to consider the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*A new installation may be faster than performing an upgrade.\n\n*A dynamically growing disk file will considerably gain physically allocated space during a distribution upgrade (because of package cashing and reorganizing).\n\n*A brand new distribution release may not yet be fully supported by Virtual Box.\n\n*Best advice is to wait with a distribution upgrade until a new Virtual Box update had fixed possible issues.\n\n\nThe developers of Virtual Box do a tremendously helpful job in making this software compatible with almost any operating system. This however is a process needing considerable effort.\nTherefore we can not expect that Virtual Box will be up-to-date exactly at the release point of any new Ubuntu release. At present Ubuntu 14.04 is not yet officially supported from the Oracle Virtual Box download choices. This usually will take some time. Until then we may likely still be able to run Virtual Box but it may need another update of the Virtual Box software until issues and bugs from integrating with a new distribution are being fixed.\n", "Q: installing the Lubuntu 13.10 elementary Lubuntu icon set in Lubuntu 14.04 I noticed the 13.10 elementary Lubuntu icon set is missing from Lubuntu 14.04.

Or just changing LANGUAGE.\n\nA: I was having thins problem on KDE Neon (a ubuntu derivitave), using e_CA.UTF-8 and fr_CA.UTF-8 locales, and the Canadian multilingual keyboard. Launching Libreoffice from the command line gave me these warnings:\nI18N: Operating system doesn't support locale \"\"\nI18N: Operating system doesn't support locale \"en_US\"\n\nI don't have any idea what the en_US locale has to do with accented characters, but building the en_US ISO-8859-1 locale fixed the problem for me (I had only built en_US.UTF-8). To do this, run dpkg-reconfigure locales and select en_US ISO-8859-1 as well as any other locales you are using.\n", "Q: After upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04, my shortcuts keys and media keys no longer work I just upgraded from 13.10 to 14.04 (GNOME interface) and none of the shortcut key combinations or Fn+F(#) controls seem to be working any more (not even the default ones, like Ctrl+Alt+T for terminal). Additionally, I have an HP wireless keyboard with extra media control and volume toggle buttons. These no longer function either. Going to Settings->Keyboard->Shortcuts and attempting manual changes doesn't work.\nWhat changed in 14.04 to cause this? I never had any problems at all with Saucy! I didn't change my keyboard configuration or anything like that, and when I tested the keys with showkey they all worked, so something got lost with the keyboard mapping when the upgrade happened. \n\nA: Killing unity-settings-daemon and running gnome-settings-daemon worked for me \n, or running:\ngnome-settings-daemon --replace\n\nBut it's not a persistent solution. It affects all keyboard shortcuts set via \nSystemSettings...→Keyboard→Shortcuts.

Something happened at this process, so gnome3 didn't work properly. I could control my background light, but without OSD, volume buttons, other fn-keys didn't work and Ctrl+Alt+T didn't open the terminal. So I decided to upgrade gnome-shell to 3.12, I realised, that my main gnome3 ppa's were disabled (which is normal while upgrading Ubuntu) so you could also try enabling those by typing:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3\n\nafterwards, to update gnome3 type:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nIf you want to try gnome 3.12 add the main repository but afterwards also add the staging by typing\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3-staging\n\nand type:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nafterwards.\nReboot and everything should work!\ngood luck!\n\nA: On Xubuntu 14.04 I had to (re)enable gnome-settings-daemon to get the media keys working again.\n\nA: I don't have the gnome environment installed, but still ran into the same symptoms. I'm not certain why, since my install has been working fine for a few months, but just today all the shortcuts in the \"Keyboard settings\" ceased to work. As is hinted at briefly at the bottom of this thread, there seems to be a bad gnome configuration. I tried removing my ~/.gconf folder (after making a backup first!) and logging out/in, and that fixed my problem. The full steps to fix were:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up your home folder by pressing the Windows (or meta) key or by clicking on the first icon in the doc, then typing Files and opening the Files application.\n\n*Show hidden files and folders by pressing Ctrl+H.\n\n*Find the .gconf folder and rename it to .gconfg.bak.\n\n*Hide hidden files and folders again by pressing Ctrl+H.\n\n*Log out of your account and back in. while many of your settings will be back to default, your shortcuts should work again.\n\n", "Q: Desktop icons not showing up in xubuntu (and I cant right click on the desktop) In xubuntu, my desktop icons have dissapeared.

In both cases logging out and back into guest session shows the full desktop with panel and folders etc.\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: I found a simple fix for this particular problem on another forum. The fault seems to lie in personal settings for lxsession which are no longer available in the upgraded version.\nFrom the blank desktop open a terminal. (Ctrl+Alt+T)\nType in\nlxpanel  \n\nPress enter.\nThis should restore your panel so you can open your home folder.\nPress Ctrl+ H to show hidden folders.\nOpen the .config/lxsession folder and delete the Lubuntu folder. Logout and back in, the Lubuntu folder will be re-created with default settings and your desktop should be back. This worked in both instances for me.\n(Apologies for any formatting errors, still an amateur at this).\nEdit: I may have used the incorrect terminology with regards to upgrading. In both instances I installed from disk and selected the option of installing the new OS over the old while keeping settings and home folder.\n\nA: Please note:\nYou can't (or are not supported to) upgrade from 12.10 to 13.10, or from 12.10 to 14.04 LTS.\nAnything could break, or produce subtle errors you do not notice initially. What you have attempted (assuming you gave accurate details) is definitely NOT recommended.\nThere is no certainty that your fix (suggested here) addresses all issues.\n\nUbuntu is ONLY supported when EITHER upgrading to the next release (while the old is still being supported), OR from LTS to next LTS release (again, while the old LTS is still supported).\neg. 13.10 to 14.04 LTS, and 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS\nOtherwise, you should do a clean install of the NEW release, after first backing up your data (and any applications settings).\n\nA: If you encounter this when upgrading from Lubuntu 18.04 to 18.10\nIn my case, the session manager screen would show options for \"LXDE\", \"LXDE-Qt\" and \"Lubuntu\" and all except \"LXDE\" would result in a blank desktop with just some icon titles (no icons even) and no panel.\nIt turns out this was because, for some reason, the upgrade did not install the lxqt package, so I could fix it as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*If your graphical desktop environment does not work at all, go to a virtual terminal and log in: press Ctrl + Alt + F1.\n\n*Install the package:\nsudo apt install lxqt\n\n\n*Log out and in again from your graphical desktop environment, or restart your computer.\n\n*Since the original LXDE desktop environment has been replaced with a Qt-based version in Lubuntu 18.10, we can uninstall the old one to get rid of that legacy \"LXDE\" option in the session chooser menu of the session manager screen.\nsudo apt remove lxde-core lxde-common\n\n\nA: I fixed this problem by removing all files and folders in my home folder ($ cd ~/) that start with \".\". I think this is a problem with some configuration file from the previous installation, but as I don't know which file is, I moved all of them to a temp folder.\n\nA: I had the same problem recently after installing Lubuntu 14.04 LTS on my ASUS EeePC 701. The \"scenario\" was the almost exactly the same as described here (got a logon screen but then I arrived at a totally blank desktop, just the wallpaper + mouse pointer showing and no panels at all) but in my case it was all due to total lack of available storage on the built in flash drive. After exiting to the command line and deleting files to get some free disk space, it all booted up like expected at next restart. So, if there is a risk that there might be a shortage of disk space, a disk cleanup might (at least temporarily) solve the problem.\n\nA: Since the same happened to me after upgrading from Lubuntu 12.04 to Lubuntu 14.04.5 and I ran into the same problem as user111667, I tried their fix and it worked out okay.\nFor those who cannot figure out how to do this from within the Lubuntu desktop session, here is how you could do it via the shell only:\nLog in from a shell (e.g. use Ctrl + Alt + F1 with your account data). in the shell, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to your home directory (usually, this step could be skipped directly after the login)\ncd\n\n*Move/Backup the Lubuntu lxsession settings outside the .config directory\nmv .config/lxsession/Lubuntu broken_lxsession_Lubuntu_settings\n\n*Logout from this session\nlogout\nGet back to the graphical user interface by using  Ctrl + Alt + F7(usually; if the interface does not show up, try different numbers). Logging back in should give you back your old interface (including some minor changes as no frontend team ever resisted the urge to swap around some graphics...). When you are satisfied with this, you may (graphically :D) delete the directory broken_lxsession_Lubuntu_settings in your home directory.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04: nvidia drivers cannot be installed I have an Asus laptop with a nVidia card. lspci tells me:\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GF119M [GeForce 610M] (rev a1)\n\nI did a fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (64-bit edition).\nBy default, Ubuntu 14.04 uses the nouveau drivers, but they don't work very well (blinking cursor, slow 3D display, etc.), so I would like to install the proprietary nvidia drivers.\nI go in System Settings > Software & Updates > Additional Drivers.

For example \"server-run.sh\", \"server-stop.sh\", \"server-do-something.sh\". And I want to run file \"server-stop.sh\" from anywhere. I could add this bin folder to path but \"run\" and \"do-something\" files also will be available and I don't want to pollute my console. Also I don't want to add this file to /bin folder, because it could change. Maybe link. Can I somehow add only \"server-stop.sh\" to path?\n\nA: The best way is to add a symbolic link to this file in the /usr/local/bin directory:\ncd /usr/local/bin\nln -s server-stop.sh /path/to/your/folder/server-stop.sh\n\nIn this case, you are adding a link to the original file, so you can always change the original file and you command will always be working.\n\nA: Creating links in /usr/bin works, but unless you want the scripts to be available for all users, I would prefer to create the links in ~/bin, with the same result, but not touching the global system. Furthermore, OP has not mentioned where the scripts are stored. creating a link globally while the scripts are stored locally is bad practice, so alltogether I would suggest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a local directory ~/bin.\n\n*Remove the language extension from the scripts (unless they invoke each other), make them executable (see further below).\n\n*Create links to the scripts from ~/bin (ln -sf).\n\n*Log out and back in.\n\n\nEither with or without language extension, the script would work perfectly well. However, there are some arguments to use the script without language extension:\n\n\n*\n\n*For reasons of clarity, it might be preferable to name the link to the script similar to the script itself. keeping the language extension would then be less convenient when invoking the script.\n\n*Although a bit overdone in cases of user-written scripts, according to lintian conventions, scripts (or links to scripts) in default searchpaths should not have a language extension. \n-\n\n\nA: I would use the bash built-in command hash to remember the location of the server-stop.sh script:\nhash -p /path/to/folder/server-stop.sh server-stop\n\nJust add the above line to your .bashrc file.\nYou can now use server-stop everywhere in your bash shell/scripts.\nSee help hash:\nhash: hash [-lr] [-p pathname] [-dt] [name ...]\nRemember or display program locations.\n\nDetermine and remember the full pathname of each command NAME.  If\nno arguments are given, information about remembered commands is displayed.\n\nOptions:\n  -d        forget the remembered location of each NAME\n  -l        display in a format that may be reused as input\n  -p pathname   use PATHNAME is the full pathname of NAME\n  -r        forget all remembered locations\n  -t        print the remembered location of each NAME, preceding\n        each location with the corresponding NAME if multiple\n        NAMEs are given\nArguments:\n  NAME      Each NAME is searched for in $PATH and added to the list\n        of remembered commands.\n\n\nA: Perhaps an alias is what you are looking for. Open your ~/.bash_aliases file and add the following to the end of the file(the file may be empty depending upon whether you have added an alias previously):\nalias server-stop.sh='/path/to/your/server-stop.sh`\n\nPros:\n\n\n*\n\n*This will only add server-stop.sh as you intend to\n\n*This won't change your $PATH variable\n\n*Other users of your system are unaffected\nCons:\n\n\n*\n\n*You will have to change the alias once you change the path where server-stop.sh is located(I don't think that will be required very frequently)\n\n*This will work only for bash shell, you will have to see what other shells use for alias.\n", "Q: Is is possible to change Super + T to terminal?

And I was trying to create a bootable usb for my DELL XPS 15z. After successful creation of usb with usb-creator-gtk I plugged in bootable usb stick to DELL laptop.\nThe error message was \"Operation System not found\".\nI tried several things but could not make it.\nWhen I check from working Ubuntu, I can see that usb is bootable and has files for installation.\n\nA: Here is a solution I tried and apply.\nProblem definition:\nFirst of all to point problem I should say. I was having dual boot Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 13.10.\nAfter installing Windows 8.1 everythings seems to be ok. One bloddy monday morning with unknown mistical reason Windows 8.1 stopped working. The error was \"unmountable_boot_volume\". I could not understand what happened. Six months no problem with SSD disk. But a monday morning it stucked on this error. And there is no solution for it. Everybody said just \"Format it!\".\nThen I decied to move Linux Ubuntu 14.04, no dual boot. And the problem was as is written up.\nSolution:\nDELL XPS 15Z (L511Z) comes with PXE network boot.\nI've installed TFTP and BOOTP service to another well working Ubuntu 14.04. Then boot the DELL and finally installed Ubuntu 14.04.\nConclusion:\nNever use a Windows! as a Operating System.\n\nA: The Dell XPS 15z was one of the early devices with UEFI, I think it has bugs in the firmware, the latest UEFI BIOS was A12. However, it doesn't support booting GPT from what I found, so this can be a reason for the \"Operating system not found message\" so you might need to ensure any USB created is legacy MBR.\nFurthermore, I have had issues with USB booting generally even when they are legacy MBR formatted and supported, the only way I found to resolve that was to clear the CMOS, you have to disconnect the battery then the CMOS battery and leave it for around a minute, then plug in the main battery and CMOS again.\nOn booting up it will warn you about the RTC being reset and you'll need to go into the setup to set the date/time again and commit the changes which will stop it from bleeping and this cleared USB boot issues.\n", "Q: 14.04: re-enabling unity style notification in unity after xubuntu-desktop install?

In 13.10 Dolphin \"Find\" work flawlessly, however since upgrading to \"Trusty\" \"Find\" returns no results at all.\nIt appears this is a problem which may not be resolved until KDE 4.14.  Note the latter part from the following extract:\n\"....A major new improvement is the introduction of KDE’s next generation Semantic Search. This makes search faster, saves memory, improves stability, and generates more reliable search results. And it could use a good testing.\nVarious applications use the search abilities, most notably Dolphin and KDE PIM (see the next section). Also tagging (Gwenview!) and KRunner (Alt-F2 run command dialog) can use some attention.\nSome of your existing data will need to be migrated from the current Nepomuk backend to the new 'Baloo' backend. Running the nepomukbaloomigrator should take care of that. The old Nepomuk support is considered “legacy” (but it is still provided). The programs that have not yet been ported to the new architecture have Nepomuk integration disabled. One significant regression is file-activity linking, which will not work until KDE Applications and Platform 4.14. If you rely on this feature, we recommend not upgrading at this time. For the final release, distributions might choose to optionally have the old search (Nepomuk) available.  ....\"\n...\"\nAbove extract taken from:  http://dot.kde.org/2014/03/12/applications-413-coming-soon-help-us-test \n\nA: I have had multiple installs of Kubuntu on multiple devices, and file search never worked.

Some applications have some actions bound to change of focus, for example twitter (in browser) closes reply text input field when losing focus, etc. So ubuntu's native keyboard switcher isn't suitable for me, until fixed.\nX has builtin switching mechanism, and it is much better, in addition to that it does not involve focus switching, it switches immediately (gnome switcher also sometimes lags).\nHow can I set up xkbmap options so settings will remain after reboot and will not be reset by Gnome?\nWhat I've tried:\nFirst, just executing setxkbmap:\nsetxkbmap -layout \"us,ru\"\nsetxkbmap -option \"grp:caps_toggle,grp_led:scroll,compose:ralt\"\n\nBut it works only:\n\n\n*\n\n*For current session\n\n*Until Gnome will overwrite it (for example touching something in gconf's org.gnome.desktop.input-sources triggers reset).\n\n\nSecond, adding xkb options to Xorg config:\nAnother option is to add following to xorg config:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n        Identifier \"system-keyboard\"\n        MatchIsKeyboard \"on\"\n        Option \"XkbLayout\" \"us,ru\"\n        Option \"XkbModel\" \"pc105\"\n        Option \"XkbVariant\" \"pc105\"\n        Option \"XkbOptions\" \"grp:rctrl_toggle,grp_led:scroll\"\nEndSection\n\nXorg understands that during startup:\n[    33.791] (**) Option \"xkb_rules\" \"evdev\"\n[    33.791] (**) Option \"xkb_model\" \"pc105\"\n[    33.791] (**) Option \"xkb_layout\" \"us,ru\"\n[    33.791] (**) Option \"xkb_variant\" \"pc105\"\n[    33.791] (**) Option \"xkb_options\" \"grp:rctrl_toggle,grp_led:scroll\"\n\nBut switching configuration still resets later, likely by gnome.\nThird, gconf\n\nI have xkb-options and sources set in org.gnome.desktop.input-sources, but Gnome still sets xkb to single English layout:\n$ setxkbmap -print -verbose 10\nSetting verbose level to 10\nlocale is C\nTrying to load rules file ./rules/evdev...\nTrying to load rules file /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev...\nSuccess.\nApplied rules from evdev:\nrules:      evdev\nmodel:      pc105\nlayout:     us\noptions:    grp_led:scroll\nTrying to build keymap using the following components:\nkeycodes:   evdev+aliases(qwerty)\ntypes:      complete\ncompat:     complete+ledscroll(group_lock)\nsymbols:    pc+us+inet(evdev)\ngeometry:   pc(pc105)\nxkb_keymap {\n    xkb_keycodes  { include \"evdev+aliases(qwerty)\" };\n    xkb_types     { include \"complete\"  };\n    xkb_compat    { include \"complete+ledscroll(group_lock)\"    };\n    xkb_symbols   { include \"pc+us+inet(evdev)\" };\n    xkb_geometry  { include \"pc(pc105)\" };\n};\n\nFourth, another option in gconf\n\nSetting org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.keyboard also does not work for me.

I'm extremely new to Ubuntu,\n\nA: You have two main options:\n\n\n*\n\n*The bad one: use something like pscp which allows you to send the password. From man pscp:\n\n  -pw password\n      Set  remote password to password. CAUTION: this will likely make\n      the password visible to other users of the  local  machine  (via\n      commands such as `w').\n\nThis will require you to have the password in the crontab file, which is a simple text file and that is not a good idea. On my Debian, with pscp 0.63, the password is actually masked in the output of w and ps &co but based on the man page quoted above, you cannot assume that will always be the case.\n\n\n*The better one: setup passwordless ssh for the user who needs to run the scp command. If you don't want to do that for your regular user, just create a new user and run the crontab as that user. \nAlternatively, you can set it up the other way around. Instead of having a user on machineA copying a file from machineB, have a user on machineB copy the file to machineA instead. \nYes, you can do this with an expect script but the same security issues will apply if you want to include the password in the script.\n", "Q: Error executing Xilinx ISE Design Suite .bin file I'm trying to execute a .bin file, specifically \"Xilinx ISE Design Suite\", and I get this error message:\n./xsetup: 12: [: 64: unexpected operator\n./xsetup: 37: [: unexpected operator\n./xsetup: 23: ./xsetup: /tmp/selfgz10129/tps/lnx32/jre/bin/java: not found\n\nWhat can I do to fix this?\nThanks in advance\n\nA: This error is because you try to install on unsupported operating systems.

Most users opt to use the discontinued rEFIt or its updated fork, rEFInd, to manage such installations, although it can be done in other ways, too.\nUbuntu does not support installation in EFI mode on 32-bit computers; however, there are 32-bit builds of GRUB in Ubuntu, and other tools (including rEFInd) can boot Ubuntu in EFI mode on 32-bit Macs. See, for instance, my Web page on how to set this up, although that's a bit old. Also, be aware that I've had problems with EFI-mode booting Ubuntu 14.04 in EFI mode, whereas 12.04.1 works much better. I suspect that some kernel compile options have changed in a way that negatively impacts EFI-mode booting, but I haven't yet investigated this in detail.\n", "Q: Precise to Trusty Upgrade?

I don't really want to run four upgrades to get to the current version though...\nEDIT 2 This link is very useful to understand the upgrade on Ubuntu. The answer is basically that there won't be any notification until the first point release (14.04.1), but users who wish to bypass this and install the new LTS without having to wait can run sudo update-manager -d. Remember to backup your system beforehand to protect your data against screwups.\n\n\nA: Try sudo update-manager -d from command line \n\nA: I don't think you'll get it until the first point release, and it's probably worth waiting for LTS to LTS upgrades.\n", "Q: in installing Ubuntu facing problem with following message \"serious errors were found while checking the disk drive for /\" As i installed latest ubuntu 14.04 in my windows 7 'D' drive after reboot it showing following message\nserious errors were found while checking  the disk drive for / .\ni re installed ubuntu for confirmation but still facing same problem.\n what to do now ??\n\nA: My guess is that GRUB is looking for your / partition in the wrong place, or failed to install at all. In order to diagnose your problem, you will want to use boot-repair. Since you have an Ubuntu LiveCD/LiveUSB, it is most convenient to run the utility from there.

If you are having trouble finding your Dash, try typing just Ctrl + Alt + T.\n\n*Enter the command, sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update. Be sure to follow this with a carriage return (Enter) so it can execute.\n\n*Enter the command, sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &) after it finishes executing, and be sure to execute this one as well.\n\n*Select \"Recommended Repair\".\n\n*When the repair is finished, copy down the URL you are provided with. If your repair does not work, this will be necessary for further troubleshooting.\n\n*Reboot your computer normally (i.e. not to your installation media).\n\n*Now, you should be able to boot to Ubuntu.

The USB will need an EFI partition (FAT32, 300M, flagged bootable) with the bootloaders grubx64.efi and shimx64.efi in /EFI/Boot, with the bootloader to run (shim for secure boot, grub for non-secure) renamed to bootx64.efi.  You could have both boot mechanisms, like the live media does.  You can just copy the bootloaders into the EFI filesystem if you want (or if the installer does not put them into the right place (and on removable media, that is likely, using the /EFI/ubuntu directory just like on the hard disk).\n  Once you get grub running, then you will need to deal with any video problems.\nSome old UEFI machines with H2o may have problems with secure boot, but those issues in the Toshibas have been fixed 18 months ago, so always good to use the current firmware from the vendor.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, none of the Bios options would boot the usb.  However I discovered by chance that there is a boot menu option before you get into Windows, perhaps you might need to set the delay in the Bios (?) so you see this.

So what are you actually using, a file or a partition?\nIf you are using a file, how are you trying to increase the file size? To my knowledge these files are created by allocating a file in the filesystem with zeros, mounting it as a loopback device and formatting it with a filesystem. I don't know of a way to increase/extend such files without destroying the filesystem. The only solution I can think of is creating a new file with the desired size, mounting it, formatting it and copying the contents over.\n", "Q: Why is my Apache not working after upgrading to Ubuntu 14.04?

To start apache in Ubuntu, run the following command:\nsudo apache2ctl start\n\n\nApache configuration are split into multiple files, one of those files are environment variables. When you are running just apache2, these variables are not set.\nThe apache2ctl script will load the variables (and do some other stuff as well when needed) before starting apache with apache2 -k start.\n\nA: I had this problem even though apache was working for me. I simply wanted to do a quick\n$ /usr/sbin/apache2 -V\n\nto find the value of SERVER_CONFIG_FILE. Because that's not the way to start apache2 any more it fails with the errors the OP posts. A quick and dirty workaround is simply to set the envvars that are missing first:\n$ source /etc/apache2/envvars\n$ /usr/sbin/apache2 -V\n\nThis sets the APACHE_LOCK_DIR variable and all is well (-D SERVER_CONFIG_FILE=\"apache2.conf\").\n\nA: Edit the configuration: sudo leafpad /etc/apache2/apache2.conf:\n# Include the virtual host configurations:\n\n#before upgrade = \nIncludeOptional sites-enabled/*\n#after upgrade = \n/IncludeOptional sites-enabled/*.conf\n\nor remove file.\n\nA: I had this problem : The cause is in the file\n/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf \n\nwhere the root have changed:\nbefore upgrade = /var/www\nafter upgrade = /var/www/html\nSo edit to modify this file\nsudo gedit /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf\n\nAnd restart apache\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\n\nA: augustin's answer worked for me when all my virtual hosts disappeared following a server upgrade from 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS.  I would upvote it if I had the reputation to do so.\nThe following command will add the .conf suffix to all symlinks in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled that don't already have it:\nsudo find /etc/apache2/sites-enabled -type l ! -name '*.conf' -exec rename 's/$/.conf/' {} \\;\n\nIn addition, there has been a change from using the Allow from/Deny from syntax to Require in the mod_authz_host module (here is the link for the 2.2 documentation).\nThe following command will edit the common usage of Order allow, deny followed by Allow from all to be Require all granted instead:\nperl -0777 -pi.bak -e 's/Order\\s+allow\\s*,\\s*deny\\s*\\n\\s*Allow\\s+from\\s+all/Require all granted/sg' /etc/apache2/sites-available/* \n\n\nA: Symptoms and solution\nIn many Q&A web sites or forums, people confuse symptoms and actual causes. I just upgraded a ubuntu server from 13.10 to 14.04.1 and ran into the exact same symptoms described by the OP, including:\n1- apache apparently not working.\n2- apache configuration variable undefined.\n3- the syntax error mentioned by the OP.\nThe problem is that not all of these symptoms are actually germane to the actual problem and they only serve as a distraction to those who try their best to help. \nDifferent root problems may cause administrators to come to sites like this one with roughly the same description: \"I upgraded the OS and now apache is not working...\"  \nOne specific cause\nHaving all the exact same apparent symptoms as the OP, I was attracted to this question. Unfortunately, the only answer that contained a valid hint to the real root cause of my problem was downvoted (-1), posted by user1469291 with a rep of 1!!\nSo I searched further other web sites until I found a clear explanation of the problem (and thereby of the solution).  \nThe solution that follows may not solve the OP's real problem, but I'm sure that it'll help others who may be attracted to this question for the same reasons as I was.  \n/etc/apache2/apache2.conf\ncontains: \n# Include generic snippets of statements\nIncludeOptional conf-enabled/*.conf\n\n# Include the virtual host configurations:\nIncludeOptional sites-enabled/*.conf\n\nwhich means that only site configuration files in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ ending in .conf will get loaded. Older symlink in that directory will be ignored. \nIt used to be simply sites-enabled/*. That's why all my virtual host configuration files that I simply named ww1.example.com, ww2.example.com, etc, used to work but suddenly and initially inexplicably stopped working after the upgrade.\nSo, either change the directive above and reload apache, or, like I did, manually remove all the older symlinks in sites-enabled/, rename all the files in sites-available/ to add the suffix .conf and then re-enabled each site individually.  \nIn addition, the default directive in apache.conf are stricter: \n<Directory />\n  Options FollowSymLinks\n  AllowOverride None\n  Require all deny\n</Directory>\n<Directory /var/www/>\n  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks\n  AllowOverride None\n  Require all granted\n</Directory>\n\nSo if you host your virtual sites in /home/user/somewhere, make sure to override the directive appropriately.\n\nA: In fact, the docroot does change between precise and trusty from /var/www to /var/www/html.\nIt is poor that the do-release-upgrade script does not regress the docroot back.\nA) Either is valid, but html is more conventional. CentOS is influential in this regard.\n   The \"it works\" page is more mature now too.\nB) You do not have to use /var/www/html, but if you do...\n\n\n*\n\n*you need to migrate your content or alias it (not recommended).\n\n*you need to update anywhere the old location is referenced.\n\n*especially backup/restore/customisation scripts.\n\n\nC) And it may be easier to build from the ground up and migrate.\nD) This symptom will occur if you \"sudo apache2 -k graceful\" out of the box on Trusty, upgrade or not due to envvars not being in scope ?. Use \"sudo apache2ctl start/stop/restart\" instead.     \n\nA: In my case:\n\n\n*\n\n*The html subfolder at /var/www/ already existed but still I was getting the error: AH00526: Syntax error on line 74 of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf\n\n*I had already decided to host my websites in my user root e.g. /home/{user}/sites/ instead of the default /var/www/html\n\n*I am using Apache 2.4.7 (You can check your version with apache2 -v)\n\n\nHow I solved the problem in five easy steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In /etc/apache2/apache2.conf I added the following after line 169:\n<Directory /home/{user}/sites/>\n    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks\n    AllowOverride None\n    Require all granted\n</Directory>\n\n\n*I made sure my Virtual Host configuration named website.conf at /etc/apache2/sites-available was copied from the default 000-default.conf, and looked like:\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost\n    ServerName website.dev\n    ServerAlias www.website.dev\n    DocumentRoot /home/{user}/sites/website\n</VirtualHost>\n\n\n*I reloaded my site (sudo a2dissite website && sudo a2ensite website) and my server and the initial error was gone. WOOHOO! But a new one emerged: \"AH00035: access to / denied (filesystem path '/home/{user}/sites') because search permissions are missing on a component of the path\". This I solved in step 4.\n\n*The new problem was due to permissions, so I just set each of the directories leading up to the website folder to chmod 755. Every single one! The home folder, the {user} folder, the sites folder, and even my website folder\n\n*After refreshing my browser at website.dev everything loaded fine!\nP.S. I had already setup website.dev in my /etc/hosts file.\nBonus Tip: To check permissions of a particular folder you can use the command stat -c %a /path/to/file/or/folder. To check permissions of every part of a directory use namei -m /path/to/final/folder.\n", "Q: League of Legends error on Ubuntu 14.04 I installed LoL on ubuntu 13.10 and it was working properly.

I will think about that.\n\nA: On 64bit installation you will experiencing big differences in memory usage ( especially for app like chrome, firefox, mysql and java apps ).\nThis is a is well known side effect of 64bit OSs anyway 64bit brings also some other advantage.\nHere it comes x32 ABI: a kernel feature that is meant exactly to limit this issue.\nWhat is x32 ABI:\naccording to this pdf it provide great memory advantage compared to a 64bit normal OS (even 40% enhancement).\nNow if I 've understood x32-ABI requires:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Linux Kernel 3.4 compiled with CONFIG_X86_X32=y \n\n*Gcc 4.7\n\n*Binutils 2.22\n\n*Glibc 2.16\n\n*Recompiling all system libraries, required by an application, with gcc -mx32\n\n\nHow To try it\nNew kernel have the required flag by default so you need only the packaged compiled in the right way ( here Gentoo for sure rules ;)\nOn Ubuntu I'm not sure there any repository/ppa for this, anyway Debian and Arch have some solution:\nDebian \n\n\n*\n\n*Instruction about how to set up a chroot enviroment and run X32-ABI on debian:\nhttps://wiki.debian.org/X32Port\n\n*x32 packages are hosted here: http://ftp.debian-ports.org/debian/pool-x32/main/\n\n*Info about x32 Debian port http://debian-x32.org/\nArch\n\n\n*\n\n*Here a repository with many X32 packages (such as chromium, mysql):\nhttps://github.com/fantix/ArchLinux-x32\n", "Q: How to view Berkeley DB contents?

Why is everybody keep mentioning to disable Fast Boot on Windows 8 if you have installed alongside Ubuntu? Is it something that is recommended only for UEFI machines or is it a suggestion for Legacy BIOS machines as well? Is it because it makes the Windows partition inaccessible from Linux or there is another more serious reason to disable it?\n\nA: Fast boot explained with an image:\n\nDuring fast boot the system loads the hiberfile and does not use the files on the filesystem. \nSo the biggest problem, and the worst problem you can have on a computer, is data loss: if you create a shared NTFS data partition the hibernation may maintain the file structure so if you try to save a file from Linux into the NTFS partition it will get lost on Windows reboot as it only remembers the old file structure. See this Ubuntu Forums thread for more information.\nThat alone is reason enough to never touch fast boot in a dual boot setup.\n\nTwo relevant discussions from Super User:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hibernating and booting into another OS: will my filesystems be corrupted?\n\n*What do I have to take care of when hibernating both Ubuntu and Windows (dual-boot environment) Make sure to take note of this answer by Gilles.\nIn general: if a disc is mounted when using fast boot, Windows puts this disc and its content in a hiberfile. Any changes made to the system are gone when the hiberfile is restored. This includes mounted external discs. Ubuntu will refuse to mount a disc that has a hiberfile. \nOne of the bad messages you see in these topics is getting a \"disc has errors\" when booting Windows.\n\nA: Fast boot in Windows 8 is a way to boot the system faster because the needed data to boot (Drivers, User session, etc..) are stored in a hibernation file (hiberfile) and are loaded when the boot process begins, saving the user between 40% and more boot time.\nSince Hibernation mode is a way to \"freeze\" whatever you were doing before shutdown and loading it again when you start the computer (this includes opened apps, sessions, drivers, the last office doc you were editing...) it creates a problem when you want to copy stuff from Ubuntu to Windows after a hibernation, or \"fast boot\" as it is called on Windows 8 because anything that changes between hibernating and booting again is lost.\nBasically, if you shutdown Windows 8 (hibernate mode) and then go to Ubuntu and try to copy something over to Windows 8 like an mp3 file (assuming Ubuntu does not throw any warnings about it being in hibernation mode), when you boot Windows 8 again, the mp3 file will not be there because it was not frozen during the shutdown procedure you did on Windows 8 before going to Ubuntu. Since the mp3 file was not there BEFORE shutting down Windows 8, it was not saved in the hiberfile and thus will not be restored after you do a Fast boot to load Windows.\nThere are however 2 ways to disable this so you can share files between both systems as described in Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\n\nA: With fast boot enabled, windows locks down the drives. I had trouble installing Kubuntu  on my new laptop because of this. I got around it by opening partition manager while running off of the Live USB and shredding the windows partitions. Worked for me because I wanted to get rid of windows altogether, but would be a problem if I had wanted a dual boot system.\n", "Q: Installing ubuntu 14.04 I want to install Ubuntu 14.04 on my new laptop, but when I download 64 bit desktop version. from Ubuntu site the ISO file is \"ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64\",\nis that OK? I have Intel i-7 processor.\n\nA: Yes, that's fine. All new Intel and AMD processors suppot the AMD64 instruction set. Generally AMD64 just means 64 bit and will work on any modern processor.\n", "Q: Using KDE - Application Menus Missing in Qt Apps I have multiple desktop environments installed on my Ubuntu 14.04 installation, and am primarily using KDE (today).  Here's the problem I've noticed.\nWhen I've been building some newer versions of Qt-based applications from their git repos, specifically Qt Creator and Tiled, everything builds fine.  However, when I run the compiled program, there are no application menus in their window.  I do not see this same problem when using older, pre-packaged debs for the same applications.\nI've completely removed/tested/re-installed appmenu-qt to no avail.\nI've checked the application config files, and find no MenuBar entries.  I even added/tested MenuBar=true and MenuBar=Enabled, with no change.  And, like I said, the prepackaged versions showed their menus - so this shouldn't be the problem anyway.\nIf I change the Application Appearance | Style | Fine Tuning settings for the Menubar style to be a Top screen menubar or Titlebar button menu, I can see and access the menu as expected.  When I change the setting back to \"In application\", the menus are gone again.\nI have all the prerequisite Qt dev libraries installed, and received no errors or warnings when configuring/qmaking or compiling the apps.\nDoes anyone have any idea why the appmenus wouldn't be showing up in the application window?\n\nA: This sounds like https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/appmenu-qt5/+bug/1307619. Another work-around is to unset QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME in your environment.\n", "Q: What To Do After Creating Bootable USB For the first time i have installed Ubuntu on my laptop but when i booted my laptop it was not showing options to select between the two OS i.e i have installed Windows8 on laptop and created bootable USB stick for Ubuntu and then restarted my computer and changed boot device to USB and selected to use first device (HDD) for getting it started (linux) then i connected to internet,would it automatically upload any of my document from HDD ?????\nhow to install various software(application) to Ubuntu like vlc, etc.\n\nA: \nI have installed Ubuntu on my laptop but when i booted my laptop it was not showing options to select between the two OS.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Ubuntu and then run sudo update-grub command on the terminal(ctrl+alt+t).\n\n\n\nhow to install various software(application) to Ubuntu like vlc, etc\n\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install applications in Ubuntu?\n\nwould it automatically upload any of my document from HDD ?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*No, Unless you enabled online storage services.\n\n\nA: I think you shound part your DD using gparted after creating your bootabel usb stick, but before you need to save all your important infos somewhere else because there's a big chance you lose everything in the process of parting your DD, (disque dure in french I don't know what it is in English), when parting you'll need 3 sections : linux, Windows and système d'exploitation DATA.\nyou'll also need the command chkdsk.\nI suggest you to take this infos and Google them and check tutorials till you understand what you'll need to do and why.\ngood luck.\nif you've already sorted this problem out feel free to share your version of the story may help other people.\n", "Q: How to install KDE along Unity? I have just installed the latest Ubuntu 14.04 and I would like to install KDE along side my Gnome/Unity that I have now. How can I do this?\nThanks!\n\nA: You can install kde 4.12 easily on ubuntu 14.04 , open terminal :\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop\n\nEnjoy using KDE\n\nA: Good answers here, but when installing you'll be asked a question in a terminal about choosing between lightdm and kdm. Either works well and lightdm should be selected by default, just press [ENTER}.\nReboot/logout, and when you go to login again, you'll see a \"gear\" icon next to your password window.

My system's current partition setup is like this: SYSTEM 200MB primary, C: 670GB primary, 28GB unallocated (for Ubuntu), and HP_TOOLS 100MB primary. So here's what I'm going to try to do. In Ubuntu installation with the \"something else\" option I will create a primary ext4(or 3?) partition out of the 28GB of free space. Then, since I now have four primary partitions, I will create a logical 4GB SWAP area inside the ext4(or 3?) area. So the end result should be that along with the SYSTEM, C:, etc. I will have a 24GB partition for Ubuntu and inside that a 4GB logical SWAP partition.\nWill this work?\n\nA: Make that 28GB as extended(logical) partition you can't have 4 primary partitions. You already have System,C,HP tools as primary partitions so if you create 24GB primary you cannot create a swap partition. So make 28GB unallocated to extended partition and split it into 24 and 4 GB partitions and install ubuntu.\nYou cannot create a partition inside a primary partition, the partition should be converted into extended(logical) then split into partitions and all the split partitions will be logical partitions.\nAlso you can create swap partition anywhere you like.\nI hope this helps\n", "Q: Accessing menus in Rhythmbox on Gnome I have two machines running Ubuntu - one has Gnome Ubuntu, the other Xubuntu. Both have been recently upgraded to 14.04. On Xubuntu, Rhythmbox has both a menu and a sort of \"settings\" button on the upper right-hand side. On Gnome Ubuntu (since either 13.10 or 13.04) neither is visible - and, in fact, I don't know how to access the things that used to be there.

The reason why I ask, is that often languages define the same terms differently, and QML is fairly unique in some regards.\nA brief explanation or analogy is preferred, where as more extensive and detailed explanations should be linked as further reading.\nThanks\n\nA: *\n\n*Components are reusable, encapsulated QML elements with well-defined interfaces.\nComponents are often defined by qml files.\nThe Component element allows components  to be defined within QML items rather than in a separate file. This may be useful for reusing a small component within a QML file, or for defining a component that logically belongs with other QML components within a file.\n\n*Elements (or types) are the predefined bricks provided by Qt Quick (or provided by the Ubuntu ui toolkit).\nElements are declared with the their name and two curly braces. Elements may be nested in elements, thereby creating a parent-child relationship between the two elements.\nTo see the standard QML elements listed by functional area, visit this page.\n\n*Objects are just instances of a QML type.\n\n*Attributes\nEvery QML object type has a defined set of attributes (id, signals, properties, methods). Each instance of an object type  is created with the set of attributes that have been defined for that object type.\n\n*Property\nA property is an attribute of an object that can be assigned a static value or bound to a dynamic expression. A property's value can be read by other objects. Generally it can also be modified by another object, unless a particular QML type has explicitly disallowed this for a specific property.\n", "Q: Upgrading Ubuntu slows Laptop down I've a question considering upgrading Ubuntu to the new version.

My Ubuntu gets very slow because of too many apps, but when i check the system monitor, Ram use is 80% but swap is less than 5%. How do you let ubuntu use the swap more effectively?\n\nA: swap area is used in a smart way: the OS decides how to use it, when you have many apps running and you use most of them at a time simeltaniously they need to be in RAM to be ready, but swap area is something like a garage. the programs which are not used at time are parked there and when you need them the Kernel will load them into memory, if your memory is going to filled up completely the Kernel move some of apps to the swap area and moving this data is time consuming. how ever if you have a fast disk such as SSD you will not notice these movements.\n", "Q: How can I access my windows 7 drives in Ubuntu?

The issue is I have a lot of them, and I need to recreate them with the right UIDs and groups… here starts the nightmare...\nThanks for your help. \n\nA: Use a conventional backup tool like tar or dump.\nThe main reason for doing an image type backup ( which you can do with clonezilla ), is that it can image the entire disk, including the boot loader, saving you the trouble of having to restore that as a separate step when restoring the backup.  Since you plan on only backing up the one partition however, that negates this advantage.\nOther advantages of using tar include:\n\n\n*\n\n*You don't have to unmount the partition to back it up\n\n*You can do incremental backups instead of having to repeat the full backup each time\n\n*You can extract specific files you may have changed or deleted from the backup, rather than having to restore the whole thing\n\n\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem for more information.\n", "Q: How can I lock my screen without turning off the monitor?

It works for me all the time:\ncat /var/log/installer/media-info \n\nOutput (my system) Correctly tells that I am running Kubuntu\nKubuntu 14.04 LTS \"Trusty Tahr\" - Beta amd64 (20140326.2)\n\n\nA: The following if will show you if you are running Unity or not:\nif [[ \"$(ps -ef | grep unity | grep $USER | grep -v grep)\" =~ \"unity\" ]]; then \n    echo \"I'm running Unity\"; \nfi\n\nIn the same way you can check if you are running GNOME or other flavors. The important thing is what (part) name of the process you use for first grep. You must distinguish a specific process which run all the time only in the flavor about which you are interested.\n\nA: If your aim is to make some desktop settings defaults for all users, it's much easier to let the OS do it for you, using Gsettings schema overrides. For example, create /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/99_my-settings.gschema.override containing your settings like this:\n[com.canonical.indicator.datetime]\nshow-week-numbers=true\n\n[org.gnome.desktop.calendar]\nshow-weekdate=true\n\nUse Dconf Editor or CLI tools to check the correct schema (in square brackets) for each setting. You can group several settings under each schema. Finally run this to make them defaults for all users:\nsudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas\n\nThis way you won't even have to run any scripts, as each desktop environment finds its new default settings when starting. Also, users will be able to personalize them without a sneaky startup script changing them back again.\nHere's some more info: https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/glib-compile-schemas.html\n", "Q: Flash Player for other browsers How can I get flash player for other browsers in Ubuntu?

Instead it prints show all the files in the current directory.\n\nA: Not all programs take input. The ls command can take a directory or a file as an argument (e.g. ls /etc) but you can't pipe (|) to it. So, the first command is the same as doing:\n$ find ~/Downloads -iname *btsync*\n$ ls -al\n\nThe pipe is ignored because ls has no way of reading from the standard input. xargs, on the other hand, does something completely different. It reads standard input and then runs the command you give it on each line of the input. From man xargs:\n\n  This manual page documents the GNU version of xargs.  xargs reads items\n   from  the  standard  input, delimited by blanks (which can be protected\n   with double or single quotes or a backslash) or newlines, and  executes\n   the  command (default is /bin/echo) one or more times with any initial-\n   arguments followed by items read from standard input.

What does that mean? It means that support is available long-term. And support, in this context, means that updates are made available to fix bugs. These updates do not (generally) supply new features: they just fix bugs. Some of those bugs are critical, and it is important that you apply the fixes when they become available.\nThe updates are divided into two categories: “Important Security Updates” and “Recommended Updates”. Generally, when recommended updates become available, you won’t be notified (this depends on your settings, but that’s the default). When important security updates become available, you will be notified, and, at this time, will also be notified of any recommended updates you may choose to also apply. If you’re a normal desktop user, your best course is probably to simply take the lot. Very few will have any noticeable effect, but they do keep your computer more secure.\nAn upgrade, on the other hand, means moving to a new release of Ubuntu. The move from Ubuntu 13.10 to 14.04 is an upgrade. This update will come with a slightly different look and feel and a few new features. (Ubuntu is fairly stable these days, so there are fewer major differences between releases than there used to be.)\nIf you were thinking of moving from 13.10 to 14.04 LTS, you should. Ubuntu 13.10 is is not a long-term support release, which means that it is no longer supported, which means that updates are no longer available to fix security-critical bugs. (In fact, currently, the only supported Ubuntu releases are LTS releases.)\n\nThe practical upshot of all that is, whatever version of Ubuntu you are on, you will get updates. You should apply those updates when they are offered to you. It really is very low hassle.\nWhen your version reaches end-of-life** you will also be offered an upgrade to the next version.\n\n* It doesn’t help, perhaps, that apt-get also uses these two words, but uses them completely differently. apt-get update means “check the repositories for what new updates are available”, and apt-get upgrade means “apply any available updates”. Do not let this confuse you: words can have different meanings in different contexts, and as long as they’re clearly defined, this is not a problem.\n** If you’re on an LTS release, you’ll also be offered an upgrade when the next LTS release comes out. You are, however, under no obligation to take it. Long-term support releases really are long term. Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Server Edition is still supported till next year. More recent LTS releases support the desktop edition for that long too.\n", "Q: upgrading from Ubuntu 14.04 to Kubuntu I have an issue with installing KDE on my Ubuntu 14.04.\nI executed\napt-get install kubuntu-desktop\n\nAnd tried to remove unity \nsudo apt-get autoremove --purge unity unity-common unity-services\nunity-lens-\\* unity-scope-\\* unity-webapps-\\*\ngnome-control-center-unity hud libunity-core-6\\* libunity-misc4\nlibunity-webapps\\* appmenu-gtk appmenu-gtk3 appmenu-qt\\*\noverlay-scrollbar\\* activity-log-manager-control-center\nfirefox-globalmenu thunderbird-globalmenu libufe-xidgetter0\nxul-ext-unity xul-ext-webaccounts webaccounts-extension-common\nxul-ext-websites-integration gnome-control-center gnome-session\n\nNext I chose KDM as default desktop manager.\nBut now every time I logging in on KDM login screen all I see is empty default KDE wallpaper.\n\nA: I installed some of removed tools, then switched to lightdm.

I have just updated my Xubuntu 13.10 to 14.04. Did not change anything. Suspend-to-RAM (standby) and hibernate both worked well in 13.10.\nNow hibernate does not work any more (suspend-to-RAM still works). The machine seems to suspend to disk, but after a restart, I just get a blank screen and the hard drive is running.\nWhat can I do?\n\nAfter two months of investigation (no one could solve the problem so far), I found that under the newest Debian (XFCE) with kernel 3.2.0 hibernation works correctly. The same holds for Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE-201403), which is based on Debian.\nHibernation does not work under the newest Linux Mint 17 \"Qiana\", which is based on Ubuntu, nor under the newest Fedora 20, nor under Xubuntu 14.04. They all have a kernel version around 3.13.0.\nSo my conclusion is that there is something wrong or misconfigured with the newest kernels, and since the distributions that are not directly based on Debian use the newest kernels, their hibernation does not work correctly, whereas the Debian kernels do work.\n\nA: I found that, in Lubuntu anyway, if you open synaptic and search term 'hibernate' there is a package simply called hibernate.  Just install that and instead use it, not pm-hibernate.  Works great, even better.\n\nA: I was just having an issue with my hibernation in Linux Mint 17 Cinnamon and came across this link. The article provides four potential reasons for hibernate not working and their solutions. For me, the wrong UUID was listed in /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume.\nI have multiple swaps on my hard drive for other distributions, and the UUID displayed in the file did not match the UUID of the swap partition I set to mount at startup for Mint (though I did not have to add the UUID into grub, as it said I would). \nTry the solutions from the site and see if they help you.\n\nA: I had a similar issue when I upgraded from Linux Mint 16 (based on Saucy) to Linux Mint 17 (based on Trusty). Suddenly my suspend, hibernate and shutdown functions all failed to work properly.\nI tried many different possible solutions based on a lot of searching wikis and forums, but in the end the only thing that worked was upgrading my laptop's BIOS.\nMake sure you have a backup of your files and possibly your MBR/EFI partition data before doing this. I thought I was going to lose all my data after the BIOS upgrade, but luckily I rescued it all.\nI have a Lenovo Z70 laptop. After upgrading BIOS and rescuing my partitions, suspend, hibernate and shutdown all worked perfectly again. I am running a 3.17 kernel though, not the stock 3.13 that came with Qiana. But I don't think the kernel was the problem, it was the BIOS.\n\nA: Well, after waiting for more than 6 months, the updates I got seem to have solved the problem. Hibernating works now.\nThe only drawback is that after suspending to ram, the sound does not work, though it can be re-enabled by hibernating followed immediately by a wake up. \n\nA: Try ubuplex solution. Worked for me in Linux Mint 17 Quiana (based on 14.04):\nsudo apt-get remove pm-utils\nsudo apt-get install hibernate \n\nEDIT: With this solution hibernation only works if I use \"sudo hibernate\" command. Badly unninstalling pm-utils makes \"Hibernate\" button (in power off dialog) unusable.\n\nA: Also had a similar problem with Qiana Mint. The best I could manage after following many of the above was one hibernation - the second would freeze.\nvar/log/syslog yielded an error on restart concerning \"rsyslogd-2039\".\nHere's the link \nhttp://kb.monitorware.com/kbeventdb-detail-id-6904.html\nFollowing that method produced different problems. I finally settled on changing the last line from\n\n *.=notice;*.=warn |/dev/xconsole\nto\n *.=notice;*.=warn |/dev/null\n\nThat just left the networking problem - sometimes reconnected, sometimes not. I put these lines in a script on the Desktop\nsudo service network-manager stop\nsudo rm /var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.state\nsudo service network-manager start\n\nWorked for me - if anyone can see why, I'd like to know.\n", "Q: Opening files created in windows 7 I have nvq work i done on windows I have now put them on Linux what app do i need to read them please.

It aborts half-way through with the error message there is too little space in the /boot folder. It recommends emptying the trash and running apt-get clean. I emptied the trash and ran apt-get clean, but this apparently accomplished nothing. Same problem. Inspecting the /boot folder seems to show there are a lot of older files left over from interim updates, but since I don't know what may be vital, I haven't attempted deletion. Is apt-get clean broken? And if so, is my only recourse a clean install? That would be annoying. \n\nA: Basically, each time you upgrade the kernel, it doesn't remove older versions.  This is a good idea since sometimes, you might want to go back to the older version.  However, it is unlikely you will want to go several versions back.  So, yes, those are safe to remove.\nAlok's link is fine.  I personally use Ubuntu Tweak, which has an option to clean up old kernels.  Any of the options are fine, but you might feel \"safer\" with Ubuntu Tweak, even though it does the same thing as what Alok's link does but puts a fancy GUI up front.\nPS:  apt-get clean is not broken.  It clears out the local repository of retrieved packages but not the /boot directory.  You need enough space in the boot directory for the new kernel in 14.04.  Actually, the problem you are experiencing isn't because of 14.04.  The next time you upgrade the kernel in 13.10, you would have the same problem.  It's just by coincidence that you're seeing /boot used up when upgrading to 14.04.\n", "Q: Trouble downloading packages When I try to download any of the following package, it shows error.\nsudo apt-get install libelf-dev\nsudo apt-get install tcl-dev\nsudo apt-get install tk-dev\n\n\nReading package lists...\nBuilding dependency tree...\nReading state information...\nE: Unable to locate package tk-dev\n\nand so on. \n\nA: If apt-get install Unable to locate package, It means that package you are installing may not available on PPA according to your /etc/apt/sources.list\nThen You should add appropriate PPA (For Finding PPA Refer Website: http://www.ubuntuupdates.org/ppas)\nThen sudo apt-get update and then sudo apt-get install [pkg-name]\nFor More Information About How To Add PPAs Visit: Ubuntu Help \n", "Q: Installing a partition of Windows 8 alongside Ubuntu I originally had a laptop with Windows 8, but I wiped it and installed Strictly Ubuntu. However, I am realizing that there are some tasks that are better suited towards Windows. I was looking to Dual boot and install Windows 8 on a small partition alongside my Ubuntu, however, I would rather not lose GRUB, and last time I dual booted, I seemed to have messed up the boot order in my BIOS. So do you ladies and Gentlemen have and advice to me on how to successfully complete this task? Perhaps a tutorial you know of. I have seen many that are suited towards installing Ubuntu after Windows is already present, but I was hoping for the inverse. \nThanks everyone!\n\nA: I would recommend reading Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI to give you an idea about having both together, especially the boot repair part. But the quick and easy steps, taking into consideration you already have Ubuntu installed and want Windows 8 now (Which means there is no need to worry about UEFI, Secure Boot and other issues) would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*With the LiveUSB of Ubuntu, use gparted to shrink the Ubuntu space in order to create empty space to install Windows. I am assuming Ubuntu took the whole drive. I recommend doing it this way since the Windows 7 and 8 partition tool in their installer has had several problems messing up the Ubuntu partition. After you have the space needed for Windows 8 you can keep on reading.\n\n*Install Windows 8 like you normally would. Select the empty space and all the steps that are shown in the installer.\n\n*Since you installed Windows AFTER Ubuntu, the boot part of Ubuntu will not work. To fix this, simply plug the LiveUSB of Ubuntu again, this time as I mentioned in the link above in the troubleshooting section, open a Terminal and type the following:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair   \nsudo apt-get update   \nsudo apt-get install boot-repair   \n\nNow run boot-repair\nBoot Repair will mention that you have some GRUB error, just click on Apply so boot repair fixes everything. Now reboot and you should see Windows 8 and Ubuntu side by side on the same GRUB menu. I again mentioned gparted and doing the partition with the LiveUSB or LiveDVD because it is really fast, saves you some issues that could appear when using the partition manager of the Windows 7/8 installer and it is easier.\n", "Q: just guest session available, can not login I'm desperately trying to login into ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

So I found out that I need the mastrokamux plugin for gstreamer which is in an apparent \"good\" category (not sure how to find out what plugins I may have already or how to get new ones).

I have a quick question relating to $# in the shell scripts.\nSo, I can use $# at the command line to check the number of a shell script arguments given by the user.\nExample:\n#  ./shellScript varONE varTWO\n#  $#\n>  2  <--  so output 2 here reflects varONE and varTWO\n\nIs any command I can use for read command?\nFor example:\n#!/bin/bash\nread -p \"please input value\" var1 var2\necho $#  <--  however here will return 0 even user input two values at command line\n\nIs any other command I can use here to return 2 so that I can perform a check on the user's input variables? Like:\n[ $# -lt 2 ] && echo \"failed\"\n\n\nA: The best way to check if you have received a value in your varTWO is to check if varTWO is empty as follows:\nread varONE varTWO\nif [[ $varTWO = '' ]]; then\n    echo \"failed\"\nfi\n\n\nA: Special Shell variable $# return the number of positional arguments given to this invocation of the shell. \nif you want the arguments passed to the script are exactly 2:\nif [ $# -ne 2 ]; then\n    echo \"failed\" \nfi\n\n#check if args are correct here...\n\n\nA: The short answer is that you can't. You need to tell read how many arguments it should expect, it will only read as much as you tell it to. If you give it just one variable name, it will read everything into that variable. If you give it more than one, for example 3, it will read everything until the first space (or tab, or newline or anything else you have set in $IFS) into the 1st, everything to the next into the second and the rest of the line into the third. To illustrate:\n$ cat file\none two three four five\n$ while read line; do echo \"$line\"; done < file\none two three four five\n$ while read first second rest; do echo \"First: $first, Second:$second Rest:$rest\"; done < file\nFirst: one, Second:two Rest:three four five\n\nSo, read will read as many variables as you give it. If you can have variable length input, you will either need to test each to find out how many were passed as explained in @Jobim's answer, or you can use arrays.\nAs explained in help read:\n\nOptions:\n-a array         assign the words read to sequential indices of the array\n              variable ARRAY, starting at zero\n\nThis means that you can store the input values in an array and then get the length of the array with ${#ArrayName[@]}:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nread -a values -p \"please input values: \" \necho \"You gave ${#values[@]} value(s)\"\n\n", "Q: problems with Realtek RTL8188ee on 14.04 I am having a wireless issue with my mothers laptop, just installed Ubuntu 14.04 because I'm tired of removing malware from her laptop and now the wireless card wont work.\nthis is the first time I've ever had  problem with this and I'm not finding anything for 14.04, the card is the Realtek RTL8188ee, the computer is a Toshiba Satellite  C55-A, it works hardwired to my router and with a cheap no name 802.11g dongle I had lying around.\nthing is it was connected during the initial installation, but after it rebooted it stopped working and can't figure it out\n\nA: Larry Finger, kernel maintainer, has a github repository with an improved driver.

This is explained in the snapshot below:\n\nThe description of the actual partitions are as under:\nC:    NTFS   90GB   (running Windows 7)\nD:    NTFS   80GB\nG:    NTFS   80GB\nH:    NTFS   130GB\nFree space: 85.66GB\n\nUbuntu is unable to identify these partitions.\nI have been dual booting Ubuntu and Windows for a while now and installed different versions of Ubuntu over Windows at least a dozen times, but never faced this issue. Until recently, I was running 13.10 and upgraded to Trust Tahr. That's when the problems began. The upgrade was successful, but once I rebooted I wasn't able to log into Ubuntu (probably due to a change in the boot loader from Legacy to UEFI, which I am certain grub was supposed to handle, but whatever!). One thing led to another and a re-installation attempt led to me having a single OS on my laptop(Tahr) and me losing all data. I removed Tahr, re-installed Windows 7 Home Premium and created the partitions. But now, I am unable to get Ubuntu to identify the partitions and the right amount of free space.\nGiven below are snapshots that show the error message I get when GParted tries to detect my partitions. I am certain something is wrong with my partition table, but I do not know what it is or what the message really means. But this might be why Ubuntu is unable to detect my partitions.\n\n\nWindows 7 (Home Premium) Disk Management Tool Snapshot:\n\n\nA: You have two issues.\nWindows only boots in BIOS mode from MBR(msdos) partitioned drives. It looks like drive was originally gpt. And when you install Windows in BIOS boot mode it does not correctly convert to MBR, but leaves a backup gpt partition table.\nWindows only boots from gpt drives with UEFI, so if you want to convert to gpt partitioning, you have to reinstall Windows in UEFI boot mode, if your hardware is also UEFI capable. \nYou can remove backup gpt partition table with fixparts. The Linux will  see it as MBR without issue.\nFixParts is the easiest way to remove the stray GPT data. GPT fdisk (gdisk or sgdisk) can do it, but the procedure's a bit more involved.\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/fixparts/\nBut it also looks like you have used all 4 primary partitions. You have to convert one primary to an extended partition, so you can create as many logical partitions as you want inside the extended. Do not create partitions with Windows as it will convert to dynamic partitions which does not work with Linux at all.\nMy laptop already has 4 primary partitions: how can I install Ubuntu?\nMy disk already has 4 primary partitions, how can I install Ubuntu?\n\nA: I had a similar problem with Vista and eventually resorted to using Windows own built-in partition manager on the basis that they probably know best about their own file systems.\nTo find the well-hidden programme type partition in the search box.  The latest version has options to swap between MBR and GPT and vice-versa so I think if a simple disc check does not reveal any error then (double)swapping to reinstate the appropriate tables may help.\nForgive me if this is too simple or you have already investigated this potential solution but I have overlooked the obvious many times in my career in computing.\nedit:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log in to Windows\n\n*Click the Start or Windows symbol\n\n*Type \"partition\" in the search box (without \"\")\n\n*Click on Mini Tool Partition Wizard (Home Edition on mine)\n\n*When loaded the Operations column has \"Convert $1 to $2\" option\n                                             where $1 & $2 = MBR OR GPT\n                                             depending on your current system\nOR\n\n*Click on Disk from top bar\n\n*The two operations are shown with the available one clickable and the unavailable one greyed\n\n*Carry on from there\n\n\nI have not used this on W7 or W8 but as it is a Microsoft provided programme they would offer support to anyone with a registered MS installation.\n\nA: I would try, after making a backup of the system :),  to use Testdisk and see if it can recover your partitions. It has worked for me in the past with deleted or wrongly formatted partitions. You can install it in the live system.\n\nA: If you a truly looking for a dual boot solution with \"with minimal hassle\" I submit that you could simply use the wubi installer. \nThe WUBI installer is on the 14.04 ISO and works with windows up to 7.\nJust pop the disk in while running windows 7.\nSee Windows installer for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS onwards\nMany of my clients have found this an effective way to use Ubuntu when they were either unable or unwilling to dump Windows entirely. \n\nA: Go to ubuntu start (at the top right) and search for disks. Open disks and create a partition over there or if you already have one format it. Ignore any errors. (This step is via Try Ubuntu mode).\nNow you can see the partitions which you created while selecting partitions.\nNOTE: Always backup each piece of data while doing anything. \n\nA: First change hard disk connector (in my case from connector2 to connector1).\nSome SATA ports have different controllers on the motherboard. Often times\nthese extra ports are for eSATA, SATA3, SATA6, etc. When these ports are\noperating in new-ish modes then it is possible that Ubuntu wont understand\nhow to use them. So by switching SATA ports and changing the bios modes (of\noperation) to the most universal (AHCI or so) often solves these types of\nproblems\nSecond free some space in your hard disk and let that space be clean\n(unallocated space). Now try to install Ubuntu again and I believe that it\nwill detect all the partitions and the free space as well. Use the tool\nthat is provided with the installer (under the \"Something Else\" option)\nto create the partition that you need to install Ubuntu.\nThe solution that I have presented is working for me and is based upon the\narticles in these links (that you can check for more details):\nlink1\nlink2\nHope this works for you\nJaMmedSyS\n", "Q: Failed to download repository information-xubuntu I just installed Xubuntu and i get this from the software center :\nFailed to download repository information.

I installed Windows7 and Ubuntu. Using fdisk, I get four partitions. What does each partition mean? Which one is Ubuntu? Which one is Windows7?\n\n\nA: sudo fdisk -l lists all the partitions on all your storages partitioned with msdos partitioning label.\nI think that,\n/dev/sda1 is active primary partition.\nThis partition has Windows 7 boot loader.\n/dev/sda2 is primary partition formatted as NTFS.\nThis partition has Windows 7.\n/dev/sda3 is primary partition formatted as swap space.\nThis is a swap space used by Ubuntu.\n/dev/sda4 is primary partition formatted as a linux file system(ex: ext2/ext3/ext4...).\nAs result,\n/dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 is used for Windows 7,\n/dev/sda4 is the /(root filesystem) for Ubuntu,\n/dev/sda3 is swap space for Ubuntu. Swap space is a space on a hard disk used as the virtual memory extension of a computer's real memory.\n\nA: sudo fdisk -l lists all the partitions on all your storage devices connected and recognized.\nYour /dev/sda2 is Windows 7 and /dev/sda4 is Ubuntu. You can infer that from the type and size of the blocks as follows:\nWindows 7 needs NTFS and you have only two partitions that are NTFS partitions. Now, windows will need more than at 102 MB for its partition so, /dev/sda1 cannot be the C: drive, it is the boot loader for Windows 7.\nNow /dev/sda3 is the swap partition and ubuntu needs ext partitions for it, so the only partition that remains is /dev/sda4.\nIn summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda1 is the Windows boot loader\n\n*/dev/sda2 is the Windows C: drive\n\n*/dev/sda3 is the swap partition\n\n*/dev/sda4 is Ubuntu's / folder \n", "Q: How to automate sudo password How do you input sudo password automaticly when prompted? I can do this in a script by typing: echo PASSWORD | sudo -S Command, but how do I do that always when prompted?\n\nA: You can modify the sudoers file (using visudo) and use the \"NOPASSWD\" option to not prompt for a password. From, here page; e.g. man sudoers and searching for NOPASSWD -\n\nNOPASSWD and PASSWD\nBy default, sudo requires that a user authenticate him or herself before running a command. This behavior can be modified via the NOPASSWD tag. Like a Runas_Spec, the NOPASSWD tag sets a default for the commands that follow it in the Cmnd_Spec_List. Conversely, the PASSWD tag can be used to reverse things. For example:\n\nray     rushmore = NOPASSWD: /bin/kill, /bin/ls, /usr/bin/lprm\n\n\nwould allow the user ray to run /bin/kill, /bin/ls, and /usr/bin/lprm as root on the machine rushmore without authenticating himself. If we only want ray to be able to run /bin/kill without a password the entry would be:\n\nray     rushmore = NOPASSWD: /bin/kill, PASSWD: /bin/ls, /usr/bin/lprm\n\n\nNote, however, that the PASSWD tag has no effect on users who are in the group specified by the exempt_group option.\nBy default, if the NOPASSWD tag is applied to any of the entries for a user on the current host, he or she will be able to run ''sudo -l'' without a password. Additionally, a user may only run ''sudo -v'' without a password if the NOPASSWD tag is present for all a user's entries that pertain to the current host. This behavior may be overridden via the verifypw and listpw options. \n\n", "Q: Lost Windows 7 boot entry after installing Grub customizer The title says it all. I installed grub-customizer, made some changes to the GUI, and lost my Windows boot entries. I've tried running sudo update-grub, but it didn't detect Windows. How can I recover the boot option?\n\nA: You should repair your windows installation with your Windows bootable DVD, using the Repair your computer option, and after you finish with this one, you can download Boot Repair CD iso image and burn it on a regular CD or put it on USB key via Unetbootin. I assume you still have the installation disc for WIN7?\nOh, useless to say that you should get rid of 'grub-customizer' as soon as you can.\nBoot Repair CD comes in 2 versions, one is for 32bit OS and the other for 64bit OS. So if you installed Win7 64bit you'll be needing boot-repair-disk-64bit.iso image, and the 32bit iso image for Win7 32bit. \nAfter you make sure that you can boot into Win7, you can place your new Boot Repair CD in tray or use the USB version and restart your computer. Allow the CD to load its system, and choose the Recommended Repair option once you are in the live session with Boot Repair CD.\nAfter you restart your computer again and, hopefully, boot into Ubuntu you should run the sudo update-grub command so Ubuntu be able to list your Windows in the boot menu.\n\nA: IRST metadata from Windows was causing conflicts after grub settings were updated.

I already had Win8 installed and have Ubuntu installed, and when booting I am given the option to boot either Win8 or Ubuntu, but when I click Ubuntu it gives me an error \"\\NST\\AutoNeoGrub0.mbr\". I then mounted Boot Repair to a USB flash drive and tried to run it, but it had to abort and gave an \"EFI detected\" error. The link that Boot Repair gave is here http://paste.ubuntu.com/7302051/.\n\nA: Boot Repair should have no problems with your setup, although you should be careful to boot your emergency disc in EFI mode, since Windows is installed in that way. Your Boot Repair output indicates that GRUB is installed in BIOS mode, and there's no evidence of an EFI-mode installation of GRUB, so my suspicion is that this is the root of your problem. I therefore recommend that you first attempt to get your emergency system booted in EFI mode by fiddling with your boot-time options. Check for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi; if it's present, you've booted Linux in EFI mode, and if it's not, you probably haven't.\nIf you have problems with that, you could try my rEFInd boot manager instead. Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version from its downloads page, prepare a medium with it, and boot to it. If the rEFInd menu appears and enables you to boot either Ubuntu or Windows, boot to Ubuntu and install the Debian-package version.\n", "Q: Bash script callable from home but not scripts directory I'm having a very weird error when trying to make a script callable.

To save anyone else who has this problem a google search.\nsudo mount /srv/projectname/ -o remount\n\nreloads the edited fstab, and everything works again.\n\nA: The file permissions say that it is executable, yet the file is not executable. There are three reasons why this can happen.\n\n\n*\n\n*You didn't dig deep enough into the file permissions — there is an access control list that makes the file non-executable to you. You can see a file's ACL with the command getfacl /path/to/file. This is not the case here since ls -l shows that there is no ACL on the file (there would be a + at the end of the permissions, e.g. -rwxr-xr-x+).\n\n*The file is stored on a volume that is mounted with the noexec option. This option is implied by having users in an fstab line (if you want to make a filesystem user-mountable and to allow users to execute files on it, use noauto,users,exec). This mount option causes all regular files to be non-executable regardless of their permissions.\n\n*The file is a script that references an interpreter that isn't executable in its shebang line, or a dynamically-linked binary that references a dynamic loader that isn't executable. This isn't the case here given that copying the file results in a file that you can execute (and /usr/bin/env is executable anyway).\n\n\nBy a process of elimination, the file is on a volume mounted with the noexec option.\nThe only workarounds are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't mount the volume with the noexec option. This option has no security implications (unlike nosuid and nodev, which do). It is mostly useful for filesystems with no notion of execute permissions, where you get to choose between making everything executable or nothing.\n\n*Copy the file before executing it.\n\n*Use a bind mount or bindfs to create a view of the filesystem where executable files are executable.\n\n*Invoke the interpreter or dynamic loader explicitly, e.g. here bash helloworld.sh. This doesn't execute helloworld.sh, it excecutes /bin/bash which reads from helloworld.sh.\n\n", "Q: lxc trusty (ubuntu 14.04) network interface is not starting My host environment is Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

This is a manual fix for the problem:\n\nifup eth0\n\nGuide: https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/lxc.html\nIs this a bug in the template?\n\nA: EDIT: Nevermind, I now think it was because I had used LWP, and it had mangled my config files. I'm leaving the below info, just in case it was both things.\nTLDR: are you dealing with clones of an image? \nIf so, make sure you start up the base image (the one created with lxc-create, not lxc-clone) at least once before you clone it. \nI was experiencing a similar bug.\nOn 14.04 host, using 14.04 containers.\nI'd snapshot a container, and the first time I ran it, the network would work.\nHowever, if I stopped the container, and then started it up again, the network wouldn't come up: the only way to make it work was to do ifup eth0.\nWhile troubleshooting, I went back to my original image, the first one created with lxc-create. You see, I hadn't started it up: as soon as I created it, I made a snapshot clone to work on, so that I'd always have a nice base image. I noticed, when I ran it, that it's network came up correctly no matter how many times I restarted the container.\nAfterwards, every snapshot clone I made off the image worked correctly as well. Meanwhile, the clones I had made before (without running the based container once) continued to not function correctly.\nMy guess is that there is some initial config that is ran the very first time a newly created container is ran, and this initial config doesn't work correctly if the first run is done as a clone. This is all conjecture though.\n", "Q: tqslcert won't load my tq6 certificate I have installed Ubuntu on my XP workshop desktop PC. I installed Trustedqsl from the Ubuntu software center.

I upgraded from 13.10 to 14.04 yesterday, and it appears that something has changed concerning how screen dimming works during fullscreen video playback.\nThis problem does not occur during video playback from my HDD, as the computer does not lock itself while I am doing that.  This issue only occurs when streaming videos over the Internet.  Formerly, in 13.10, the screen would dim, which was a good warning for when I needed to remind the computer I'm still there.  However, the screen no longer does this.  Instead, it immediately locks itself at the predetermined time.\nThe screen dims normally when I am not watching a video fullscreen.  Is this an issue new to 14.04 or is it something I switched in my computer somewhere?  I checked the settings, and the dim screen option is still on.\nThank you for any assistance.  I realize that I can just set the computer not to lock itself, but I'd have to set it for half an hour, and I don't want to forget I did so, and leave the computer vulnerable that long.\n\nA: The package Caffeine solves this exact problem.\nIt installs an indicator at the top right portion of the top menu, where time and battery is located. And you can enable it before playing full screen videos and during that time, it will not dim. After watching the movie or video, disable it again, to get the dimming functionality back.\nIn order to install Caffeine:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:caffeine-developers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install caffeine\n\nIt will start automatically after rebooting the machine, or start it from your dash.\n", "Q: What happened to my midi device files?

This is pretty bad form as the bstack / bstackhoriz patch doesn't directly modify dwm.c by default (it puts it's two layouts in their own file), so patch was written by someone who took the initiative to put bstack and bstackhoriz into dwm.c. This means that the patch will NEVER apply against a clean dwm build.\nLong story short - you can completely ignore that offset's error. You can just run make and will have uselessgaps in your tiled layout. \n(A word of warning as well: That patch assumes topbar to be True in config.h. If you have topbar set to False, you'll see strange problems wherein the uselessgaps are exactly right on all but the bottom of the window.

This makes the following scenario possible: If R has root access, and B wants to change A's password, B would ask R to do so. While the /etc/passwd file shows that R can modify it, since the capabilities of B are the ones being passed in and show otherwise, the action won't take place.\n\n\nAm I missing something? If not, I don't see the purpose of ACLs if capabilities will always provide the same information but with higher integrity.\n\nA: I am not sure what you are asking and you are sort of mixing root power with DAC and ACL.\nBy definition, with root or physical access, you can access any file or change any users password or make any system change you wish. You can not limit root with DAC or ACL. You can limit root with tools such as apparmor or selinux or limit access with encryption tools.\nFor example, if you use encrypted home directories, root can not access the data, even if the password is changed with the command passwd.\nacl are used to give finer grain of control to files to users without giving root access. With standard DAC you have only 3 options, user, group, and other. On a multi user system you can use acl to allow as many users as you wish to access files.\n", "Q: backup from 13.10 fails to restore in 14.04 I had 13.10 and I did a backup with deja-dup of my music, videos, and document folders and saved it to an external drive.

I'm ok with it not working for now since I haven't stored files in the protected 'Vault' folder yet, however it would be nice to use such. WINE is having problems running this software. Any suggestions?\n\nA: I know it won't help you with any files you've written from a Mac or Windows computer, but you might consider using the ecryptfs system, in the ecryptfs-utils package.  There is even a PAM module which uses the passphrase you provide to log in to encrypt the passphrase used for encrypting the files and filenames on your USB drive.  Basically, using the standard ecrypt system, you could mount your USB drive at $HOME/.Private and then use the ecryptfs-[u]mount-private utilities to (u)mount your crypted USB drive.\nAlso of note, yeah....this wouldn't help if you wanted those crypted files to be able to be read on a Mac or Windows 'puter.  Sorry.\n\nA: You need to go into winecfg using Wine Tricks. Once there, head to the Drives tab click \"Auto Detect\". Once that is done, plug your USB in and see if your USB is detected. If not, manually set the location of your USB.\n\nA: I don't believe SanDisk secure software works with Linux. SanDisk's software is the only way to utilize the built in hardware encryption. So you're stuck with ether using the encryption and only using the drive with Windows or Mac OS machines. Or using an alternative such as VeraCrypt, but without the hardware encryption benefits. Nothing's lost from a security point of view, just encryption speeds may be slower.\n", "Q: How to integrate Pidgin with Ubuntu \"Online Accounts\" (14.04) The title says it all.

Since the “/var/lib/dropbox’ folder is in the root directory, it will need superuser permission for Dropbox to be able to access it.\nHowever, that is not the main cause of the problem.

Here is a quick summarization from Digital Ocean.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use swap on whats called a swap file instead of a swap partition so you will need to create a swap file on your Ubuntu partition (after installation of course). You create a blank un-formatted swapfile by opening terminal (Ctrl-Alt-T) and typing:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1024k\n\n\n*Make sure to replace 1024k with how many megabytes large you want your swap file to be. Ubuntu usually makes this the size of you RAM so if you had 4 gigs of ram you would type 4096k. Also note typing sudo basically tells Ubuntu to run the dd program to run as root in other words the administrator.\n\n*Now we need to format the swap file so it is a proper swap file by typing:\nsudo mkswap /swapfile\n\n\n*Now if you have no errors your should be able to activate it by typing:\nsudo swapon /swapfile\n\n\n*If no errors occur at all we need to make sure to enable it at bootup. Now this involves editing a config file called fstab which can mess things up if you do not put the following information in correctly. You can open the fstab file by typing:\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\n\n*You can move the cursor with the arrow keys and type to edit the fstab file. We want to paste this line at the end by moving the cursor down to the end and by right clicking on terminal and pasting this:\n/swapfile       none    swap    sw      0       0\n\n\n*Now before we finish we need to set the swappiness value so Ubuntu knows when to store memory in swap. We are going to set it to 10 in this case by typing:\necho 10 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/swappiness\n\necho vm.swappiness = 10 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\n\n\n*And set the permissions so that no one but root (the administrator) can read the swap file for security purposes (optional but recommended).\nsudo chown root:root /swapfile\n\nsudo chmod 0600 /swapfile\n\nNow restart to see if Ubuntu boots and swap should be set up now!\n", "Q: How to download all files from Ubuntu One?

I was attempting to install an ubuntu liveusb to my external hdd, but in the process I messed up my internal setup. The external one works ;)\nIt's a dual boot system, and it originally came with win8 plus a whole bunch of Lenovo/windows recovery partitions. It has a 24gb SSD hybrid as well. I had secureboot disabled before, and installed ubuntu 13.04, and recently upgraded to 14.04. It was working fine until my little misadventure. All of my boot flags seem to be constantly changing now, too. I'm not entirely sure why.\n\nOutput from boot-repair (which wouldn't allow me to choose /dev/sda2 or /dev/sda11, only sda8 (which is my home partition?). I tried it anyway. It said it succeeded, but didn't do anything obviously.\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/7303953/\n\nMy (many) partitions are as follows:\n/dev/sda1 -- WINRE_DRV (1000mb ntfs, flags: hidden, diag)\n/dev/sda2-- this was my original EFI partition I think (was originally labelled as SYSTEM_DRV and was formatted as fat32, but now it's an unrecognized filesystem).\n/dev/sda3 -- unknown, msftres ??\n/dev/sda4 -- Windows8 OS (68GB ntfs, flags: msftdata)\n/dev/sda11 -- I created this as fat32 with the 'boot' flag, in the hopes of creating another efi partition and moving it over, but it doesn't seem to be recognized by boot-repair.\n/dev/sda5 (350mb, ntfs flags:hidden, diag) -- No idea what this is.\n/dev/sda6 (20GB ext4, flags: hidden?) -- my system partition for ubuntu. Not sure why it now has a 'hidden' flag.\n/dev/sda7 -- 4GB swap\n/dev/sda8 -- my home partition for ubuntu (75gb ext3, flags: msftdata)\n/dev/sda10 -- 290GB ntfs shared data partition (flags: msftdata)\n/dev/sda9 -- Lenovo recovery (10GB ntfs, flags: hidden, diag)\n\nSomething is seriously screwed up here. I'd really rather prefer to not reformat. I've read most of the articles regarding UEFI and GPT, etc, but I can't seem to fix my problem, and actually just seem to be making it worse.\nIt's also possible that the livecd grub isn't using the right files? It tries to install with i386-pc, when I thought i should be using something like x86_64-efi-signed or something.\nCould someone please help walk me through this?\n\nEdit:\nOk, so I downloaded and installed rEFInd to windows and made a bootable USB with that, which allowed me to boot into my actual Linux OS and not a LiveCD. From there I was able to use boot-repair properly to install grub (to /dev/sda11) and to boot /dev/sda6.\nThe problem with boot-repair before was that it didn't detect my EFI partition so it was trying to install non-efi to my /dev/sda6 (likely because I was doing it from a livecd). It seems to be an issue with the grub which comes with ubuntu14.04 though, that it doesn't have EFI support or something?\nAnyway, now I have EFI on /dev/sda11, but I have two unknown partitions (sda2 and sda3). What was sda3 in the first place? And what can I do with sda2 and the files on it (like for Lenovo recovery stuff)? Can I just delete those partitions, or will that cause more issues?\nFinally, is it just a matter of running windows recovery now? I imagine that will break my ubuntu and grub again.\nThanks!\n\nA: First, you're missing an EFI System Partition (ESP), which is used to hold EFI boot loaders. Most computers that ship with Windows 8 use /dev/sda2 as the ESP, and your /dev/sda2 is about the right size for that; but your /dev/sda2 holds a Linux filesystem and has no EFI boot loaders. My hunch is therefore that you've accidentally trashed your ESP, rendering the computer unbootable.\nRelated to the first point, you don't seem to have any EFI boot loader programs on either your hard disk or your SSD.\nYour /dev/sda11 is about the right size to be an ESP and does have a FAT filesystem (which an ESP must have), but it's marked as a BIOS Boot Partition.\nAs a first step, you must create a proper ESP. There are two relatively easy ways to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adjust the type code on /dev/sda11. In GParted, you can do this by removing the \"bios_grub flag\" and setting the \"boot flag.\" In gdisk, you'd do this by setting the type code to EF00.\n\n*Adjust the type code on /dev/sda2 and make it FAT32. In GParted, you'd do this by setting a \"boot flag\" and creating a FAT32 filesystem on it. In gdisk, you'd set the type code to EF00 and then use the separate mkdosfs utility to create a FAT32 filesystem on the partition.\n\n\nOnce that's done, you can begin recovery. In theory, you can use Boot Repair to do the task, at least for Linux; but as it appears it led you down the wrong path before, you might want to do something different:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download and prepare a bootable USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Boot with rEFInd. It should show you at least one option for booting Linux.\n\n*Boot to Linux.\n\n*Open a Terminal window.\n\n*Edit your /etc/fstab file to mount your ESP (/dev/sda2 or /dev/sda11) to /boot/efi.\n\n*Type sudo mount -a.\n\n*Type df -h and ensure that there's a line for /boot/efi, showing the correct partition mounted. If not, go back to step #5.\n\n*Download and install the Debian-package version of rEFInd.\n\n\nAt this point, rEFInd should enable you to boot Linux. Your Windows installation will remain unbootable, though, until you run a Windows recovery tool. You should be able to download something from Microsoft's site to repair the Windows boot loader, but I don't happen to have a URL or instructions handy. I recommend you ask on a Windows site if you have problems with this part of the task. Note that after you're done, the Windows boot loader will be set as the default, so you'll need to change that. You can either follow steps 2 and 10-11 in this procedure or use the USB flash drive to boot to Linux and then re-install rEFInd from there. Alternatively, you could repair Windows before you repair Linux, but you'll need to fix the ESP before you do either OS-specific repair.\n", "Q: Ubuntu won't login after installing nvidia drivers yesterday i installed ubuntu 14.04 without any problems.

Ubuntu Server 14.04 installation fails without internet connection. Also, tried the minimal installation using F4 function key in the starting by choosing minimal install.

As you can see in the link below \nhttp://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2014/01/disable-disk-caching-prevent-data-loss/\nWrite caching basically caches the data before the OS can write to the device, any then writes it together. It makes the system fast since you have less number of writes to the device, however it is risky since a power failure will result in the loss of the cached data. \nYou have turned off the write-cache hence all your writes are directly being written to the drive and thus you have high write througput.\n", "Q: Binary requires older version of a shared object I was given a binary to execute, but running ldd ./name_of_binary gives\nlibABC.so.1 => not found\n\n(I replaced the library name with 'libABC' because I'd like a general answer)\nI have libABC.so.2.

You could download the old package, install it into a nonstandard directory (like /opt/ or ~/libs/):\ndpkg -i --instdir=/opt/ ABC-1.deb\n\nthen add that path to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH:\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"/opt/lib/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\"\n\nIts possible that just installing into root will work (in which case you can do this), but there will probably be a conflict with the newer version. And may cause issues.\nsudo dpkg -i ABC-1.deb\n\n", "Q: Told command dpkg cannot be found On issuing the command sudo dpkg -i (package name) at chronos@localhost ~ $, I get the response sudo: dpkg: command not found. Anyone know why?\nI'm trying to load version 3 of network-manager and three related files to correct a known problem accessing wifi in 12.04 on some Toshiba computers, so Ubuntu is offline. \nI've downloaded the four files, but I'm unclear on where they should be stored in order for dpkg -i (package name) to find them. Could I pursue the installation via apt-get if dpkg is actually missing? If so, what would be the correct command syntax?\n\nA: The original poster, Graubart, was able to solve their own problem. The Ubuntu system was being chrooted into from another, non-Ubuntu system. But the dpkg command was accidentally being issued outside of the chroot. By chrooting into the filesystem in which Ubuntu was installed, Graubart was able to run dpkg with no problems.\n\nOkay, I discovered why I couldn't find dpkg--it's in chroot, and I was\n  in chronos@localhost. Switched to chroot, and there it was! Typical\n  greenhorn error, I suppose.\n\n– Graubart Apr 24 '14 at 3:18\n\nA: sudo dpkg -i *pkgname* is used to install deb file. if you have deb files downloaded then run this command. try to search the hardware driver in hardware  manager. \napt-get install command search the software manager which is hosted on launchpad, whether this software is available on software channel.\nfor example:\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\nif it is available in software channel, it will install without any problem. \nfirst of all please tell do you have the deb files? is yes then try:\nsudo dpkg -i <filename>\n\nelse search the driver in hardware manager. And if still you didn't get the driver install, please reply the model name of your system and wifi model build in the system. so that I can tell you how can you install the drivers.\n\nA: It is unlikely that dpkg is missing from your system. If such a thing were possible, you couldn't download and install dpkg without dpkg! What is the result of:\ndpkg --help\n\nIf it outputs text about how to use the command, then the command is present.\nIt doesn't matter where you downloaded the deb files as long as you navigate the terminal to that location first. For example, suppose you downloaded the files to your desktop. Then in the terminal:\ncd ~/Desktop\n\nNow list the contents of the directory:\nls\n\nAre all the debs shown?\nnetwork-manager-3.99-00-ubuntu.deb\nsome_other_file-ubuntu3.deb\netc.deb\n\nIf so, install them:\nsudo dpkg -i network*.deb\n\nYou can use the wildcard * to keep from typing the entire file name. You can also do:\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb \n\ndpkg will attempt to install all of them at once and notify you if you have any missing dependencies.\n\nA: Try running the command:\n:~$ locate dpkg\n\nwhich should be found in /usr/bin/ as /usr/bin/dpkg. I only say this because: if the output from running any command tells you the command cannot be found, than you do not have that command installed.\nThe output of running a dpkg command where the dpkg binary cannot locate\nwhere the .deb archive is would be something like this:\ndpkg: error processing archive packagenotfound.deb (--install):\ncannot access archive: No such file or directory\nErrors were encountered while processing:\npackagenotfound.deb\n\nso if the output looks similar to what I have posted the dpkg utility is installed and you need to change directories to the directory where the .debs reside and continue as you previously did.\n\nA: Try su -l (enter your root pass), then cd to the dir where you deb file resides and then try again dpkg -i instertyourdebname.deb.\n", "Q: Bluetooth high quality support gone in ubuntu 14.04?

Type sudo update-grub. Ubuntu will now generate a new /boot/grub/grub.cfg file for you.

There is a problem in the mount point name of my hard disk. I had a partition name stuff and for some reason after upgrading the distro it changed to stuff1 automatically. This is creating problems when I try to use KTorrent. It says that the disk containing the data is not mounted. When I try to use the move data option by right-clicking any torrent, it says that I do not have the required permission to access the disk. \nMeanwhile all my data is present in stuff1 as it was in stuff but I don't know how to resolve the issue.\n\nA: Changing your mountpoint needs three actions: changing the entry in /etc/fstab (be careful), creating the directory where it should be mounted (if necessary, but in your case it possibly exists already), and you will probably want to change the partition label as well (if necessary), to have the right name appear in the devices overview in nautilus.\nNo need to say that you ALWAYS need to make backups before you change anything. \nif it is a data only partion:\n1. Edit the existing entry in fstab\nRun in terminal:\nsudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nLookup the entry with mountpoint: \"stuff1\", change it to \"stuff\" (check first if there is no entry with \"stuff\" already), do not touch the rest. In the line, you can see in what directory the partition is mounted (the section that ends with \"stuff\").\n2. Create a directory to mount into \nCreate (if necessary) in the same directory a folder named \"stuff\", but as said, it probably exists already\":\nsudo mkdir /path_to_stuff/stuff\n\nOn next restart, you will find your documents in \"stuff\".\n3. Changing the partition label:\nThere is a chance that you need to change the partition label. You can check that by looking in the device overview in nautilus. If that is \"stuff\" already, skip step 3. If not: the best is to do it with Gparted, which you will have to install. Open Gparted. In the partition overview, right-click on the partition with label \"stuff1\", choose \"unmount\". When it is unmounted, right-click again and choose \"label\". Rename it to \"stuff\". After renaming the label of the partition, close Gparted and run:\nsudo mount -a.\n\nProbably you will also have to rename the nautilus bookmark: open a nautilus window, from the menu, choose Bookmarks > Bookmarks. Rename the bookmark.\n", "Q: Why is GiB used insteed of GB I don't know where to ask this question so I posted it here.\nI see that in Ubuntu the sign for Gigabytes, Megabyte etc are used as GiB, MiB etc. So my question is: What is the reason for using i between GB.\n\nA: 1KB = 10^3 = 1000,\n1KiB = 2^10 = 1024\n1MB = 10^6 = 1000000,\n1MiB = 2^20 = 1048576\nand so on ;)\n\nA: An KB is actually 1024 B. However, some people (like hard disk manufacturers) use 1 KB = 1000 B, because K means 1000 (like KG, KM) or in case of hard disk manufacturers because their hard drives appear to have more space (or that's what I would do). If you see KiB it is always 1024 B.\n", "Q: Guest Additions not working I am having really annoying problem and have spent hours trying to fix.

Ubuntu ships with a memory test that is access through the grub menu.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/MemoryTest\nIt could a loose connection in a chip or something, and when your computer warms up the the circuitry changes.  \nAlso, how does apt-get update and apt-get upgrade work for you?  What is the command that you ran aptitude with?  \n", "Q: How to get a timestamp on rsync output I have an hourly crontab job\n@hourly rsync -avc --delete /DirA/ /DirB/ >  /home/job.txt\n\nHowever when I check the logbook I see no timestamps. How can I get timestamps in the log so that I can be able to see when error occur?\n\nA: Try this:\n@hourly (date; rsync -avc --delete /DirA/ /DirB/) &>  /home/job.txt\n\nNote that I used &> /home/job.txt which redirects both the standard output and the standard error to the log file. That way you will also see any errors produced. Then, I use the date command to generate a timestamp before running the rsync. Placing the commands in parentheses makes the two run in the same subshell and allows the redirection of both commands' output at once.  \n", "Q: 14.04 alt key conflict after changing HUD and Window menu shortcuts In 14.04 I changed the keyboard/shortcuts settings so that:\nLauncher/\"Key to show HUD\" is now ALT Z \nHowever, when I press ALT, the application menu shows up.

In my case the easiest way is through terminator (which is an alternative terminal application). Just surround your active terminal with other terminals:\n\nOr you could do it session-side with a multiplexer like tmux. I don't have any experience there so you'll have to play on your own.\nOr you can add padding to your terminals.

I have one folder within my Dropbox directory, and a link to that folder, also in my Dropbox directory. I use the files within my Dropbox folder on a laptop and a desktop computer.\nI thought that since both the symlink and the folder it points to are both within the Dropbox folder that they would operate as usual.\nHowever, after I use the folders on one machine, when I return to the other, the symlink will be replaced with a copy of the contents of the folder it originally pointed to.\nDropbox is completely defeating the purpose of having a symlink. Is there a way I can force Dropbox to preserve the symbolic link relationship between the link and the folder?\n\nA: I'm not sure this can be answered definitively as Dropbox might change everything or nothing tomorrow. I am neither Dropbox or the omnipotent entity that drives them.\nThat said, symlink resolution is a feature that allows people to sync things that aren't actually within their dropbox folders. This is handy if you want to back something up without actually moving it. Given that's how it currently works and is how people are using it, I think it highly doubtful they'll change that behaviour...\nSince writing this, I've found a dozen or so threads and questions around the internet that all seem to agree.

I am converting mp4 to ogg for many videos with ffmpeg but at some point during this process, my computer is shutting down.\nAny idea why or how I can prevent this?\n\nA: I'd be treating this as overheating. Open a terminal, install lm-sensors and watch the output while you encode:\nsudo apt-get install lm-sensors\nsudo sensors-detect  # say yes to everything\n\nwatch sensors\n\nSo do some encoding now. I predict you'll see the temperature on the CPU rocket (check your CPU's specifications for safe operating temperatures). If that can happen, your computer's current cooling solution just isn't good enough. It might just need a dust or it might need a better heatsink/fan.\nThis is stuff you can DIY but if you haven't done it before (or you DIY'd the current solution) it might be best to talk to a professional before you melt your CPU and/or motherboard.\n", "Q: installing iTunes Hi guys I’m newbie in Ubuntu world!\nSo guys I’m running Ubuntu 14.04 / 64bits, and I installed iTunes 64 bits version 10.7.0 using wine!\nWhile trying to run iTunes I always get this error:\nItunes was not properly installed.

How do I make Ubuntu choose wifi connection over wired connection when both are connected to internet?  I edited the Ethernet connection to route using the preference \"Use this connection only for resources on this network\", which other people have reported having success with as a means of getting WiFi preferred, but it doesn't work for me. The issue persists. Ethernet is still being preferred for internet, and WiFi gets ignored. \nanother thing, is it possible to use wired connection as fail over connection to wireless? \n\nA: You can change metric. \nroute add default dev eth0 metric 20 When you change metric you default route to wless0 will have less metric and traffic will go via wless0. When wless0 is down you default route to wless0 will be deleted from routing table and traffic will go via eth0. After when you wless0 is again up, default metric will be less then 20 on eth0 and traffic will again go to wless0.\nAlso you can edit /etc/network/interfaces and set metric permanent for interface.\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nnetmask xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nnetwork xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nbroadcast xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nmetric XXX\n\n@gunjan parashar Elaborate:\nNetwork service route packages on several parameters. First of that is that packet is for local net or not. For this decision network service use netwotk mask from nic setup. If packet is not fol local net, pc will sendit to default gateway.\nIf you have 2 interfaces in the same subnet / local network and the same gateway for both interfaces, pc must use some \"parameters\" for routing decision. Parameter for routing is metric. Practically less metric is better route and pc will send packet to gateway based on that. In case that you have same metric and same gw and both interfaces on local net, traffic to gw will not working because pc can not make routing decision.\nWhen you change metric, practically you say pc \"Link over eth0 is worse. Use wlan0\" But when is wlan0 down, any connection is better then no connection and pc will be use \"worse\" connection. When you wlan is again up automatically will be with better because default metric parameter is less then metric parameter configured manually on eth0.\n", "Q: How to fix: Epson wireless networked printer aborts after printing half a page Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS\nEpson Stylus TX550W multifunction printer (copies, scans, but no fax): The first time I managed to discover the printer on my wireless LAN.

I'm using PostgreSQL 9.1 on Ubuntu 12.04. The development machine has 2GB RAM and it's a Centrino Duo.\nThe Backup command is pg_dump and takes less than 5 seconds to run from the terminal.\nBut my restore is done like this:\n/usr/bin/psql --host localhost --port 5432 --username \"postgres\" --quiet \"dbHRS\" < \"t2\"\n\nThe text file \"t2\" has around 5000 lines of inserts. But it takes around 2 minutes to complete.\nWhy does it take this long? Is there something I can do to make it faster?\nADDITIONAL INFO:\nThe Backup was done like this:\n/usr/bin/pg_dump --host localhost --port 5432 --username \"postgres\" --role \"mizk\" --no-password  --format plain --data-only --inserts --column-inserts --verbose --file \"abc\" \"dbHRS\"\n\nSo the file abc contains JUST A SET OF INSERT QUERIES. That's ALL. No stored procs, no triggers...\nI cannot accept the slowness to restore. What's strange is that when I copy-paste the text file's contents into a query window on PG-Admin, it's pretty fast. Just a couple of seconds. So I think it's got to do with the way the psql command works. Maybe I'm wrong.\n\nA: Not knowing exactly what's being done, I can only speak generally:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reads are simply reads from memory or disk.\n\n*Writes have to check constraints, action triggers and then write to disk. Usually within a transaction that needs to be setup, actioned committed and then cleaned up. And then there's cache invalidation.\n\n*Most disks (and their filesystems) read much faster than they write.\n\n\nI'm not surprised a restore takes longer than a backup but if you really think it's erroneously long, benchmark your queries and work out what the problem is.\n\nA: As Oli mentioned, writes take more time. A real world example is a database I had to migrate for a customer. It was quite large, and took about 24 hours to run the complete dump.\nImporting took about 3 times as long, however. With your test computer, it sounds like a desktop machine, meaning only one hard drive (with no RAID). If you continue to experience issues after benchmarking your queries, you may see what kind of hard drive is in the machine. Faster rotational speeds will be better in this application, so if you have a 5400 RPM drive, adding a drive specifically for SQL is an option. If you have a 7200 RPM drive, it is a little better, but you may still want to upgrade.\nDepending on the size of the database, they make some small capacity SSD drives that are not too costly. If you set your SQL to run on that, it should improve performance. Along with that, your current set up most likely has the OS and the database on the same hard drive. Splitting those up should increase performance.\n", "Q: Wireless networking not working after resume in Ubuntu 14.04 [Update]:\nThe same problem exists in Kubuntu and is solved in the same

Go to software (software sources) and the tab all the way to the right should say something like \"additional Drivers\".  See if anything is available.  Otherwise, give use the output of 'lspci' so we can see what chipset you're using and try to figure things out from there. \n", "Q: Can I use Ubuntu for Clojure development I want to learn Clojure and I want to use IntelliJ and the Cursive plugin.\nCan I easily install all of these ?\nRoelof\n\nA: Yes, you can (or in the case of Cursive soon be able to) instal these.\nClojure is available in the Universe repository, which should be enable by default. The most recent version available is 1.4, available in 13.10 and 14.04.\nsudo apt-get install clojure1.4\n\n12.04 has version 1.2.\nsudo apt-get install clojure1.2\n\nThe most recent version of Clojure is 1.6. If you really need the newest version, you can download a binary in a jar file, which you can easily run from your home directory. It is also available in the official repositories from 15.04 onwards.\nIntelliJ Idea is a commercial product, but Community edition is free. Even through it is free, it needs to purchased through the Software Center.\nOne note of warning, when starting IntelliJ you are likely to see a warning message saying that it should work with OpenJDK, but that it expects Oracle Java and that using OpenJDK is unsupported.\nAccording to the Cursive website , is not yet available. It will be also be a commercial product, but they say it will work with the IntelliJ Community edition.\n\nA: It is not useful or necessary to load Clojure jar files as these will be loaded on demand by leiningen.\nTo get leiningen it's easier to get the lein script from the leiningen site. This will also help you get an up-to-date version of Leiningen.\n\nA: You only need to install the java JDK and Leiningen\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk leiningen\n\nMy setup is as following:\n:~ > java -version\njava version \"1.7.0_65\"\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 2.5.3) (7u71-2.5.3-0ubuntu0.14.04.1)\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.65-b04, mixed mode)\n\n:~ > lein -v\nLeiningen 1.7.1 on Java 1.7.0_65 OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM\n\nIf you want to use Clojure 1.6, use a project.clj file like this\n(defproject MyAwesomeProject \"1.0.0-SNAPSHOT\"\n  :description \"FIXME: write description\"\n  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure \"1.6.0\"]])\n\nCursive is not yet available so you have to use something else.\nMy choice of IDE is Counterclockwise. \nIt uses Leiningen to manage the dependancies so you have virtually nothing to do. \nWhen Intellij IDEA will have the Cursive plugin, you will be able to switch easily.\nIf you wish to update the dependancies manually, cd to your project directory and do \n:~/Clojure/MyAwesomeProject > lein deps\nCopying 18 files to /home/francois/Clojure/MyAwesomeProject/lib\n\n\nA: Clojure CLI provides a simple way to run Clojure code and start a Clojure REPL (a lighter alternative to Leiningen)\nDownload the Clojure install script for Linux and run the install:\ncurl -O https://download.clojure.org/install/linux-install-1.11.1.1208.sh\nchmod +x linux-install-1.11.1.1208.sh\nsudo ./linux-install-1.11.1.1208.sh\n\nChange the version number of the script when a new release is available.

I was running Ubuntu  12.04 LTS for 64 bit systems on a dual boot custom computer with Windows 7. It was functioning normally for at least 3 days before I noticed that Youtube videos were flickering on my screen in Chromium. My first thought was to update flash, and since flash comes with the latest version of chrome, I tried updating my Chromium installation. At first I tried using the Chromium Updater Extension, but it didn't solve the problem. It was somewhere around this time that Chromium stopped opening completely. I then tried uninstalling and reinstalling Chromium, but it still wouldn't open. I tried running the program from the command line, but got a message involving \"libudev.so.0\" being missing from the operating system. I believe after this I had to leave so I shut down the computer.\nThe next day, I tried loading the Ubuntu installation, only to see that it was stuck on the purple screen. After waiting a while, I tried restarting it and loading it again. This time, it only booted to a black screen with a blinking line at the top left of the screen, much like a terminal window. I tried removing all the non essential USB devices but it still wouldn't boot. \nI did attempt to use the Boot-Repair Graphical Tool, but it said that it encoutered an error and gave me this link: http://paste.ubuntu.com/7306456/ .

Any idea what is causing ubuntu to break the boot loader so easily. What am i missing ??\n\nA: I have had the same problem with different HW (acer travelmate 115). I was quite desperate and then found a discussion. The problem was with switching on (booting) and off. I had tried the different ubuntu versions. Finally, I just changed the method of booting in Bios and since then, it worked smoothly without any problem.

You destroyed the permission structure of your entire filesystem. Some of the other answers can get sudo working, but ignoring the whole problem is inviting a later disaster.\nYou could try to mirror the owners off another install but there are cases (/var/ for example) that are highly dependant on what you've actually got installed. If you want to get a scale of the problem, I've actually had a crack at helping somebody fix this sort of issue before. The fix is manual, long and could easily leave your system insecure or broken.\nPicking through that mess is going to take considerably longer than a clean install.\n\nThis has had a couple of drive-bys from folks that don't understand the seriousness of the situation here. To them it looks like a big pile of unnecessary work, the sort of thing a rogue plumber or mechanic says to shake you down for a bigger job.\nIf you've only changed the permissions on /usr/bin/sudo, by all means, just fix that. But this question is about a total system change. Every file (save the runtime-only ones) are now owned by the user. Everything the user runs (eg browsers, browser exploits) could then overwrite system files, spy on you, extract any data. This needs to be corrected. Per above, this is difficult. The easiest way is a reinstall.\nSo please, don't be lazy about this. Filesystem permissions help keep you safe, fix them.\n\nA: The above methods didn't work for me, because I couldn't \"log back in as root\" (unknown password)\nBut I got a root shell by editing\nvi /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n\nautologin-user=root\ngreeter-show-manual-login=true\n\nAfter rebooting I was finally able to run\nchown root:root /usr/bin/sudo && chmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo\n\n\nA: Unfortunately, if you do not have a full backup, probably the best thing you can do at this point is to reinstall.\nConsider that you have changed all the files ownership to the same user, completely messing the security paradigm of your system....\nIf you search this site there are a lot of similar problems with chmod, as for example How can I recover from chmod -R a-wrx / command?\n\nA: *\n\n*go to recovery mode by keep pressing Esc while booting the system.\n\n\n*select root option in long list you can see after entering into recovery mode (it is actually root shell)\n\n\n*type command - mount -o remount / (Or in recovery you can click on grub option. This helped me get read-write permissions on the file system. This basically updated the read/write mode on the file system since the command wasn't working for me initially)\nIt will remount your file system in read and write mode.\n\n\n*command - chown -R root:root /usr\nthis command will change ownership from \"user\" to root again recursively\n\n\n*now still i had problem with sudo command, so I again followed step 1,2,3 and executed chmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo\nNow I really think that re-installing would have been really a \"nuclear option\"\n\nA: As you'll read on this answer on SO, this problem is not as hard as people are making it. You can get the sudo command working again without a reinstall by following these simple steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Log out as the current user, then log back in as root.\n\n*Execute chown root:root /usr/bin/sudo && chmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo\n\n*Log out as root, then log back in as the current user.\n\n\nThis does the trick and is much quicker and less painful than the \"nuclear option\" recommended in other answers.\nIf your root password is not set, you can boot in Recovery Mode to set it.\nNote that this will resolve the titular error /usr/bin/sudo must be owned by uid 0 and have the setuid bit set but if like the OP you did more than mess up the permissions of the /usr/bin/sudo file, a more \"nuclear\" option may in fact make more sense.\n\nA: I was not able to edit lightdm.conf file under running system.

But don't panic recovery is quite simple.Create a new volume of the root disk with the latest snapshot then dettach the old volume and attach it to the instance with the same disk name.With 5 minutes downtime you can login to the server again.\n\nA: I have changed /usr/lib/ to root owner but but sudo only executes with root login in the terminal. \nstep one: su root\nstep two: cd /usr/lib\nstep three: chown -R root:root sudo\nand that is it.

I have Elementary OS luna (12.04 based distro) distro installed on my dual boot (Win 8.1) laptop. I booted up a live USB of 14.04 but unfortunately I don't get a straight up simple option of replacing the eOS set up completely. So I guess I have to manually install in under something else install option.\nHow do I go about this as I don't want to mess anything up.\n\nA: You are right with 'Something else' option. But you will have to boot the live DVD or the USB version with Ubuntu 14.04, and after you are in the live session you can setup your internet connection and start the installer from the live desktop.\nOnce you are facing the window presenting those options for installing Ubuntu, you choose the last one Something else and press Next to get to your hard disk partition table. You need to format to Linux ext4 that partition where you previously installed Luna OS, and preserve the Linux swap area assuming it is still present in your list. \nOr you can delete the partition where you installed Linux before and create a new partition formatted as Linux ext4 choosing the foreslash / as mount or startup point for this partition. You also need a small linux swap partition (1-2 GB) but I suppose it is still there from your previous installation.\nAnd when you are done, you can select your newly formatted linux ext4 partition and press NEXT to begin installing Ubuntu. During installation you will have to provide the installer with your desired keyboard layout, your location (for setting up time and date) and some username and password.

This may change as F2FS gains popularity and features. For now I would use ext4 for installation and booting, F2FS seems like a reasonable choice for storing a database...\n", "Q: Nvidia GPU not upto satisfactory level after 14.04 upgrade Before upgrading from saucy to trusty, I was happily using nvidia drivers for my GeForce GT 635M GPU.

Office is another space consuming application. That said, 29GiB for just Windows and Office is a bit too much so maybe check if you have other software installed that are using your space.\nUse Windows Disk cleanup and select C drive then select clean up system files too that may free up some space in your C drive\n\nA: Use Gparted live CD to make sure that you have deleted all previous sectors of your hard drive.

Anyway, thank you all.\n\nA: For those who already have the guest extensions and additions , you should go check for additional drivers and install the proprietary video driver for virtualbox , then reset your machine\n\nA: I had this problem as well running a newly installed version of VirtualBox (VirtualBox 6.0). I tried installing the aforementioned packages but had no luck. My solution was simpler than I had anticipated. While the machine is powered off, go to:\nSettings (of the VM) > Display > Graphics Controller > and select \"VBoxVGA\"\nVirtualBox had set this option to \"VMSVGA\" by default for me. Fortunately, I noticed this subtle difference when comparing the settings between some of my virtual machines.

I also faced the same problem in older virtualbox version running Ubuntu 14.04 as guest OS.\nTo install guest additions, follow this answer.\n\nA: If that happens once you have the guest additions installed, it may help reconfiguring DKMS\ndpkg-reconfigure virtualbox-guest-dkms\n\nIt happens to me every time Kernel is upgraded and the above provides the solution.\n\nA: I know its an old thread, but I recently had the same issue on an Ubuntu host+guest setup and figured I might be able to help someone in my same boat.\nI had previously installed Guest Additions via sudo apt install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso, and would get the issue where I can either have resizing without 3D acceleration through VBoxVGA, or 3D acceleration with no resizing with VMSVGA (and no imcompatible settings message).\nI uninstalled the additions with sudo apt remove virtualbox-guest-additions-iso && sudo apt autoremove, then rebooted. I then installed Guest Additions the intended way, by inserting the ISO and installing the .run file, and viola, I now have auto resizing display with VMSVGA and 3D acceleration.\n\nA: I tried so many things and as someone's hint to the SMVGA'S drivers root rights driver in a folder VBoxClient I did not have I just...\n...ran the app out of terminal with sudo...\n...leading to the demand for a boot from CD which I aborted.

What should I do?\n\nA: It sounds like Compiz (and possibly lightdm) aren't starting properly.  \nDrop to a TTY and do 'sudo service compiz start' or try 'sudo service lightdm restart'\n", "Q: GPU temp in conky How do mesure gpu temp in conky.  \nFound this code:\n${voffset 7}${goto 40}${voffset -4}Gpu: ${font Droid Sans:style=Bold:size=8}${execi 60 nvidia-settings -query GPUCoreTemp | perl -ne 'print $1 if /GPUCoreTemp.*?: (\\d+)./;'}°C${font}${alignr}Motherboard\n\nBut this onely gives the result 0 rpm.\nso what to do\n\nA: If your version of Conky has not been installed with --enable-nvidia the easiest syntax would involve the following:\n${execi 60 nvidia-settings -query [gpu:0]/GPUCoreTemp -t}°C\n\nThis would vary of course if you had more than one GPU installed. To see all of the available settings and GPUs run the following:\nnvidia-settings -query all > all_nvidia_settings\n\nand then open the file all_nvidia_setings with gedit...\n\nA: Try this instead:\n${your offset}${your color}${nvidia temp}°C\n\nFor some reason the resulting display will look like this: 45A°C.

I am using a Toshiba Satellite L750 with Qualcomm Atheros AR9585 and my wi-fi was hardware blocked. So I did what was said in that forum. I simply rebooted and immediately I pressed my wi-fi activation keyboard combination (FN+F8) and the led for wi-fi turned on and so my wi-fi was hardware unblocked. \n\nA: I've got the similar problem with ath9k driver.\nI solved this problem with a  workaround that I found here.\necho \"options asus_nb_wmi wapf=4\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/asus_nb_wmi.conf\n\nThis command that I've inserted above change the default behavior of ath9k.\nAfter this change I noticed a strange things because network led indicator says that I'm offline, but I can go online through my wireless network card.\nI hope this could help you.\n", "Q: Is there any way to install Empathy 3.12 on Ubuntu 14.04?

fine on the version supplied with 12.04).\nVersion 3.9.4 carries some fixes to the contact list sorting, so I was hoping that at least this version (which was released in July) would come with the new

I wanted to adjust these new entries by editing /etc/default/grub, but it seems some settings are ignored or overridden by the update-grub and grub-mkconfig scripts. Specifically these lines:\n\nGRUB_TIMEOUT=2\nGRUB_OS_PROBER_SKIP_LIST=\"469841589841479F\"\n\nI did remove the GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0 line as the documentation said it was deprecated and replaced it with:\n\nGRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=\"hidden\"\n\nAfter running either script, the resulting grub.cfg file does contain:\n\nif [ \"${recordfail}\" = 1 ] ; then\n  set timeout=-1\nelse\n  if [ x$feature_timeout_style = xy ] ; then\n    set timeout_style=hidden\n    set timeout=2\n  # Fallback hidden-timeout code in case the timeout_style feature is\n  # unavailable.\n  elif sleep --interruptible 2 ; then\n    set timeout=0\n  fi\nfi\n### END /etc/grub.d/00_header ###\n\nSo the timeout option is used here. The problem seems to be later with the /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober section. Before I had the second hard drive, there were obviously no entries from that. Now that there is, this gets added to grub.cfg:\n\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober ###\nmenuentry 'Windows 7 (loader) (on /dev/sdb1)' --class windows --class os $menuentry_id_option 'osprober-chain-CA0E41BE0E41A3F3' {\n\n[snip]\n}\nmenuentry 'Windows Recovery Environment (loader) (on /dev/sdb2)' --class windows --class os $menuentry_id_option 'osprober-chain-469841589841479F' {\n\n[snip]\n}\nset timeout_style=menu\nif [ \"${timeout}\" = 0 ]; then\n  set timeout=10\nfi\n### END /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober ###\n\nSo, not only does it not ignore the partition I told it to, but the os-prober part of the script will not allow me to set a timeout of 0 AND forces a menu(I'm used to just holding down the left shift key when powering on if I ever want to change boot options).\nA second or two timeout delay is only mildly annoying, but having a menu forced when I explicitly don't want one, and this menu including a partition that should never be listed is much more so.\nShort of editing grub.cfg every time, or tweaking /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober (which may get overwritten during an upgrade?) is there a fix for this?\nThanks!\n\nA: Grub checks GRUB_OS_PROBER_SKIP_LIST against EXPUUID not UUID, so the \nproper format for GRUB_OS_PROBER_SKIP_LIST is UUID@/dev/???? for example:\nGRUB_OS_PROBER_SKIP_LIST=\"A3F5-6DF3@/dev/sda1\"\n\n\nA: How I cleaned up grub.cfg\n0- when a new [Linux] distribution is installed grub-mkconfig will use /etc/grub.d/10_linux to implement the Linux kernel and recovery menuentries. \n    OS-Prober will [/etc/grub.d/30_os-prober] use 30_os-prober to find other OS [Operating Systems]\noften the start up menu may have unwanted, superfluous or even dead entries. ( a dead entry in my boot menu started me on this quest.) \nI looked at /boot/grub/grub.config to familiarize myself with menuentries.\nto remove the unwanted entry I did the following as root:\n1- the dead entry was found by 30_os-prober. I copied the entries [made by 30_os-prober in /boot/grub/grub.cfg] I wanted to 40_custom.\n2- I put GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=\"true\" in /etc/default/grub \n3- I tested the new configuration in a boot backup directory. \n    sudo grub-mkconfig -o menu-test.cfg [the filename is arbitrary] \n4- when the test file looked the way I wanted it:\n    sudo update grub\nthe next time I booted the unwanted entry was gone but those I wanted were at the end.\n\nA: The best way to find the UUID is this way:\nsudo grub-probe --target=fs_uuid --device /dev/sda6\nFinding the UUID with blkid will not work for Mac OS X partitions.\n\nA: If os-prober returns an error checking partitions (e.g zfs) see this fix\n", "Q: Cannot mount second drive at \"/\" I have a second drive that I want to be mounted at the root. The drive contains the following folders:\n/home\n/shared\n\nI want those two folders to be accessible at \"/\". I can mount the drive at /media/disk1 but that does not solve my problem.\nI tried the following command but it doesn't work:\nmount /dev/sdb1 /\n\nI have no errors but the folders do not appear on /\n\nA: What you seems you want is a \"union\" mount, which can't be done in Ubuntu (at least not with default tools; follow the above link you are adventurous). In general there is still no official union-mount solution in Linux (2014-04-22); there are out-of-tree filesystems like AUFS and work-more-or-less-in-progress on UnionMount.  Valerie Aurora has a (slightly outdate) page about it. \nWhat you can easily do is mounting the disk at, for example, /mnt/disk1 and then symlink the directories where you want them: \nln -s /mnt/disk1/home /home\nln -s /mnt/disk1/shared /shared \n\n(again, you should not have an existing /home or /shared folder, confusion and/or errors would appear otherwise).  \nAnother way to do these kind of things is a \"bind mount\". It's very similar to symlinking directories, but can cross \"chroot\" boundaries. You can find more info in this page and in this other one. \nUpdate: the overlayfs file-system has been promoted to standard kernel for version 3.18. So now there is an official union-type solution for linux; userspace utility to simplify its use will surely follow. \nFor now, documentation is in the kernel tree at Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.txt.\n\nA: You have to create the folders there, for example if you want the A drive there or a folder there, type:\n mkdir -p ~/    \n\nwhere    ~/  is the directory after /, so / is the directory the file is being created in! \nYou can make any directory with this -- just instead of ~/, type the directory you want the file to be created in. For example, for a file being made in /usr/abc/, type    mkdir -p ~/usr/abc/.  Hope this helps!\n", "Q: system settings not showing all settings This is a weird problem I am having after installing ubuntu 14.04.

I can put in my suggested amount but the \"Shrink\" button is greyed out. According to what i read on a few post it's because i already have 4 partitions?

Thanks \n\nA: I do not believe it is currently possible to modify currently mounted partitions.  \nThe easiest way to do this is to use the gparted tool on a live cd (or usb) to manage the partitions without mounting them.  \nBe aware, however, it is much easier to install windows 8 first, then install Ubuntu.  This way Grub will pick up both OS'es without you having to figure out how to manage your MBR.  \nThis also has the added advantage of being able to resize your live active partition in Windows 8 without the need of a live cd.  This is possible using Windows 8's Disk Management tool. \n\nA: As lbaile200 said, Gparted will work great to repartition your drive.

Because of this, it was moved from\nuniverse (unsupported free software) to multiverse (unsupported non-free software).\nFrom Ubuntu bug #1164654:\nPlease move the virtualbox package from universe to multiverse in raring.\nSInce virtualbox 4.2 building the BIOS image requires a non-free compiler (Open Watcom).\nUpstream provides pre-built BIOS images which is used instead.\n\n\nA: I have just added VirtualBox 4.3.10 from the Ubuntu Software Centre as normal on my laptop, it was missing just after Ubuntu 14.04 LTS was released but is there now. I did also download it from the Oracle site for my desktop (where I use it most) and had to use the info for installing on Ubuntu 13.10 (which worked OK) when Ubuntu 14.04 LTS was released.\nI think it may just have been delayed until after the release date. Both installations work OK.\n", "Q: Attempting to setup Ubuntu 12.04 SSH Server: -bash: /etc/hostname: Permission denied Attempting to setup an SSH-server running Ubuntu 12.04. Went to \"HowToForge\" to scout for potentially advanced or knowledgeable advice upon how to accomplish this, then I ended up running into a problem; off of one of their \"Perfect Server Setup\" how-to's, naturally taking advantage the distro mentioned above. Regardless, I am hitting a point where the instructions want me to echo the following command to /etc/hostname:\necho server1.example.com > /etc/hostname\n\n...then the following error is thrown:\n-bash: /etc/hostname: Permission denied\n\nGreat, don't know why, I should have administrative privileges. Then I tried to see whether /etc/hostname is writable via lsattr, and I get:\n-------------e- /etc/hostname\n\nLast time I checked, this implied that my file was not immutable. \nIn either case, what is happening, and what am I doing wrong? Want to setup a \"secure\" server, and all I read are a bunch of snarky comments online that grant little to no assistance for my needs; or anyone else's for that matter. Too many elitist mentalities bouncing around I guess. In either case, I would absolutely appreciate it if anybody could shed some light on this dilemma. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: You'll need administrative privileges to edit a file which is not owned by you. To execute the command echo server1.example.com > /etc/hostname, you will have to do the following:\nsudo -i\n\nenter your password if you are the administrator or if you are not, ask the administrator to enter the password\nand then\necho server1.example.com > /etc/hostname\n\n\nA: For scripting purpose, you could use tee to have the administrator rights to write the file:\necho server1.example.com | sudo tee /etc/hostname > /dev/null 2>&1\n\n\nA: Try:  \nsudo echo server1.example.com > /etc/hostname\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04: very slow UI in Oracle VirtualBox Short summary: 14.04 is much slower than 12.04 even with more RAM assigned.\nI'm using latest VirtualBox 4.3.10 on Mavericks 10.9.2. How can I make it faster?\n\nA: Also, I found the following helped for me. Enable the use of the Host IO cache for the SATA controller for the virtual disk.\n\nA: Enable 3D acceleration from virtual machine setting worked! I haven't tried that because in 12.04 I didn't have that selected so I thought it should work without it.\n\n\nA: Watch out for the \"Execution Cap\" setting under the processor setting for the virtual machine. I stumbled upon a user having it set to 1% when it normally should be at 100%.\nYou can find it under 'System'->'Processor'->'Execution Cap'. It's a slider.\n\nSorry for my ugly theme.\n\nA: Run Oracle VB\nSelect your VM on the LHS\nSettings -> Display - > Video tab, \"Enable Features:\" and check the Enable 3D Acceleration box\nClick OK\n\nA: Disabling the background blur of the search panel with the Unity Tweak tool also improves the speed of the Ubuntu UI. \n\nA: I have Variety installed from the PPA's and discovered it was slowing VirtualBox to a crawl at times.

I use NoMachine to remote control the machine.  When I do so, the Unity/Gnome interface doesn't see any monitors connected, so I can only use 800x600 when connecting with NoMachine.  If I plug in a monitor, I can set the resolution to whatever size the NoMachine window is on the remote computer.\nIs there a way to create a \"fake\" monitor device on Ubuntu so I can set a desktop resolution in Unity/Gnome?\n\nA: Found a way to do it without requiring a dummy plug: Ubuntu Headless VNC VESA 800x600 Resolution Fix ~ Andy Hawkins @ June 12, 2011\nBasically install a dummy driver:\nsudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-dummy\n\nThen write it in the /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/xorg.conf (or possibly /etc/X11/xorg.conf) file (create one, if it does not exist):\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier  \"Configured Video Device\"\n    Driver      \"dummy\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier  \"Configured Monitor\"\n    HorizSync 31.5-48.5\n    VertRefresh 50-70\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier  \"Default Screen\"\n    Monitor     \"Configured Monitor\"\n    Device      \"Configured Video Device\"\n    DefaultDepth 24\n    SubSection \"Display\"\n    Depth 24\n    Modes \"1024x800\"\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nThen restart the computer.\n\nA: For me no one of the above solution works. To add a new device/screen VIRTUAL1, what has worked for me is :\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the packet xserver-xorg-video-dummy\n\n*Update xorg.conf\n\n\nAll details are here : Add Fake Display when No Monitor is Plugged In\nInfo : for me, it works in editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf instead of /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/xorg.conf\n\nA: I'm on Ubuntu 18.04, this is how I solved it:\nI've created the virtual display using the answer to this question: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/378373/add-virtual-output-to-xorg\n\nCreate a 20-intel.conf file:\nsudo vi /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf\nAdd the following configuration information into the file:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier \"intelgpu0\"\n    Driver \"intel\"\n    Option \"VirtualHeads\" \"2\"\nEndSection\n\nThis tells the Intel GPU to create 2 virtual displays. You can change\n  the number of VirtualHeads to your needs.\n\nThen I made a shell script (don't forget to set executable) and put that in Startup Applications:\n#! /bin/bash\n\n/usr/bin/xrandr -d :0 --output VIRTUAL1 --primary --auto\n/usr/bin/xrandr --newmode \"1600x900_60.00\" 118.25 1600 1696 1856 2112 900$\n/usr/bin/xrandr --addmode VIRTUAL1 \"1600x900_60.00\"\n/usr/bin/xrandr\n\nThat way, VIRTUAL1 is set as output and connected. At boot, a new mode (found using \"cvt 1600 900\") is being created and appointed to VIRTUAL1. \nOnly issue with this is: dock is missing at reboot... Haven't solved that yet.\n\nA: Specify the resolution on a Ubuntu 14.04 desktop without a monitor connected:\nFrom the xrandr man page:\n--fb widthxheight\n   Reconfigures the screen to the specified size. All configured \n   monitors must fit within this size. When this option is not \n   provided, xrandr computes the smallest screen size that will \n   hold the set of configured outputs; this option provides a \n   way to override that behaviour.\n\nTherefore use the command after connecting:\nxrandr --fb 1280x1024\n\n\nA: Consider Xvfb which is probably least likely to mess up the display when you actually plug in a real monitor\nThe following commands will start lightdm on a fake display with ID 1 and resolution 1024x76\nexport DISPLAY=:1\nXvfb :1 -screen 0 1024x768x16 &\nsleep 1\n\n#exec gnome-session & # use gnome-session instead of lightdm\nexec lightdm-session &\n\n\nA: Hardware Solution\nThis is a hardware solution/workaround which may work for some graphics hardware/driver. Also could be better, if you need to plug physical monitor frequently, so you don't have to restart X Server like with dummy/vesa/fb driver (static configuration).\n\n*\n\n*Either you buy a Dummy VGA (or DVI analog) plug or some calling it Dummy Dongle.\n\n\n*Or just build it, use 3 resistors of around 75 Ohm (a standard) at the VGA output: 1→6, 2→7, 3→8.\n+/- 10 Ohm may work without any problem. Some cards work with just one resistor. (Like my Intel, 2→7 or 3→8, will detected as a monitor). By the way, this is standard impedance which implemented in the VGA monitors.\nReference: How to create dummy plugs for your graphics cards.\nUsers who are curious to read more about monitor & its resolution detection, I would recommend reading about VESA DDC & EDID too.\n\nA: This works as an additional monitor/display once there is an existing one\nI think I may have spoken too soon. I was able to create a \"virtual\" display by adding a new mode to one of the disconnected displays listed in xrandr using\n\nxrandr --addmode VIRTUAL1 1024x768\nI then simply enabled the display like you would normally:\n\nxrandr --output VIRTUAL1 --mode 1024x768 --left-of HDMI3\nFurthermore, combined with x11vnc -clip, I am able to use this to convert my android tablet to a second monitor.  The perfomrance is pretty crappy at the moment, unfortunately, but that's whole other area to be explored.\n\nhttps://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1410831#p1410831\n\nA: John Chapman's answer didn't work for me.

When I make the connection, I have a few seconds of full-bandwidth communication, followed by the connection completely failing to send or receive packets (the card usually makes a soft sound from the antenna, under both OSs, which cuts out, along with actual networking capabilities on Ubuntu). Network manager and WICD both report the card as still connected, with reasonable signal levels (around -40dBi, which is not a problematic level for this card on Windows). The loss of communication happens replicably and reliably, although occasionally I manage to transmit and receive a few stray packets. The indicator light on the card flickers constantly and abnormally quickly after the connection is lost.\nI've tried to connect to both my WPA2 and (with consent) a neighbor's WEP access points (mine being Netgear, and theirs being Belkin), with the same result of losing the link after roughly one second. Ethernet is un-affected. This card is being used with the rtl8187 kernel module. I'm using a clean, fresh installation of Trusty x64.

Now, I ran into the same issues you did with these commands and it appears to be an issue with the version of partclone that we are using.\nIt appears that both Partclone v0.2.70 and Partclone v0.2.69 are not compatible with the back-ups I had made with Clonezilla v3.5.1.\nHowever, installing an old version of Partclone, namely Partclone v0.2.58, allowed me to restore the backup image I had created using the same command as above.

While dogonthehorizon's answer might give you the desired results in the end, you would also have to deal with fixing dependency issues when trying to install an older build of partclone.\nInstead, stop using partclone.restore, it is considered deprecated. Use partclone.ext4 as the maintained alternative in combination with the options --restore --restore_raw_file (short notations: -r -W) instead. Here 'ext4' should be replaced with the appropriate file system ('ext3', 'ext4', 'ntfs', etc).\nI have not experienced any incompatibilities this way, where I restored a version 0.2.58 ext4 file system clone with version 0.2.78.\nWith the example of the OP:\nsudo cat /dir-to-images/sdb1.ntfs-ptcl-img.gz.* | sudo gzip -d -c | sudo partclone.restore -C -s - -O /dir-to-new-image/hda1.img\n\nYou would get the following when not using partclone.restore any longer but partclone.ntfs for ntfs instead:\nsudo cat /dir-to-images/sdb1.ntfs-ptcl-img.gz.* | sudo gzip -d -c | sudo partclone.ntfs -C -r -W -s - -O /dir-to-new-image/hda1.img\n\nOr the following for an ext4 file system backup:\nsudo cat /dir-to-images/sdb1.ext4-ptcl-img.gz.* | sudo gzip -d -c | sudo partclone.ext4 -C -r -W -s - -O /dir-to-new-image/hda1.img\n\nNotice the file system indications ('ntfs' and 'ext4') in the original .gz files.\n\nA: i was getting an error when trying to loop mount an image i restored using partclone.restore. my original backup was created with clonezilla, i backed up a partition to an image. \nEXT4-fs (loop0): bad geometry: block count 14648437 exceeds size of device (14215168 blocks)\nso i used the following command to truncate it \ntruncate -o -s 14648437 sda2.img\nyou'll need sudo IF the img is owned by root and or in a folder owned by root.

(EFI Partition, FAT32, VFAT) I just installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS today, I found that the EFI partition type showing on Ubuntu is VFAT, but I always heard the partition type for EFI partition should be FAT32. I  returned to Windows 8.1 and seeing the paritition type for EFI is FAT 32 on it.\nSo my questions are:\nWhat is VFAT?\nWhy is ubuntu showing the EFI partition as VFAT, while on Windows 8.1 it is FAT32?\nDid Ubuntu formatted the EFI partion?\nDoes this have any implication on Windows 8.1?\n\nA: FAT has been expanded over time in two orthogonal ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*FAT pointer size -- FAT filesystem pointers come in 12-, 16-, and 32-bit sizes. The smaller sizes are useful on smaller media (like floppy disks) but impose media size limits. FAT32 is the least limiting in this respect; it can handle up to 2TiB partitions (or 16TiB for disks with 4KiB sectors). The FAT size is fixed when the filesystem is created, and it's not easily changed after the fact. Some tools report the FAT size of existing partitions, but others don't.\n\n*Long filename support -- FAT was originally used by DOS (and variants of it by other OSes in the 1980s, and even in the late 1970s), and had a limit of 8-character filenames with an optional 3-character extension (so-called 8.3 filenames). With Windows 95, though, Microsoft introduced a way to store longer filenames on a FAT filesystem in a backwards-compatible way. This technique is called VFAT. Note that VFAT is not specified at filesystem-creation time; it's activated (or not) by the OS that accesses the filesystem. In Linux, this is done by specifying the msdos (8.3 filenames) or vfat (long filenames) filesystem type code to the mount command. A filesystem that's been used only by DOS can be accessed later as VFAT and long filenames added; or a disk that's been used with VFAT long filenames can be accessed without long filenames (but filenames will be shortened).\n\n\nVFAT is compatible with any FAT pointer size, so you can have VFAT-12, VFAT-16, or VFAT-32. These terms are pretty rare, though; perhaps because the bit-depth is independent of the filename length, the bit-depth is often combined with \"FAT\" to identify that detail, whereas \"VFAT\" is generally used alone. All of this was pretty well-understood by computer-literate individuals in the mid-to-late 1990s, but the details have been forgotten (or never learned) since then.\n\nA: FAT is a filesystem. VFAT, FAT16, and FAT32 are merely versions of FAT that have been extended to include new features. Some software on Ubuntu detects FAT32 partitions as VFAT (likely because the program isn't aware of FAT32), but as long as it's actually formatted as FAT32 you won't have any problems with Windows 8. If you install a program like Gparted on Ubuntu it will show the partition as FAT32 rather than VFAT. It all depends what program you use on Ubuntu, and what filesystems that program supports detecting.\n\nA: VFAT is FAT32. There's nothing wrong with it showing as VFAT in Ubuntu (or any other Linux). If you plug in any USB flash drives, SD cards, etc… they will also show as VFAT, unless you've formatted them to something other than what they came as.\n", "Q: USB Hard drive Not displaying Ubuntu I have a 2TB Verbatim USB 3 hard drive that was working fine one evening and not at all the next day. I cannot view or mount the partitions. Running \"lsusb\" shows that the hard drive is plugged in but the drive is not listed when I run \"sudo fdisk -l\".

You can open Software Sources or Synaptic, and go to Settings - Repositories - Other Software. Enable/check 'Canonical Partners' and the 'Independent' repos and reload your Software Sources list. You can try using Software Center after that.\nSpeaking of Software Center, I never use it, I prefer to use Synaptic and the terminal window.

I do use the search field in Software Center sometimes to learn more about new software but I usually install the software via Synaptic.\n", "Q: Why I cannot open my disk please I had windows & Kali linux (dual boot)\nthen I took off Kali linux Parition so I delete it but I Made a mistake ... and PC won't boot \"Rescue grub error\" or something ... \nbut I installed Ubuntu & removed Windows and all . \nAll is running fine but I just can't open one of my disks , this is the error : \nError mounting /dev/sdb5 at /media/imad/Disque local: Command-line `mount -t \"ntfs\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=0077,fmask=0177\" \"/dev/sdb5\" \"/media/imad/Disque local\"' exited with non-zero exit status 14: The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).\nMetadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.\nFailed to mount '/dev/sdb5': Operation not permitted\nThe NTFS partition is in an unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown\nWindows fully (no hibernation or fast restarting), or mount the volume\nread-only with the 'ro' mount option.\n\nI asked this question before but no one had an idea , help please .\n\nA: The most likely explanation is that you had hibernated your Windows install instead of shutting it down. The normal solution is to simply boot into Windows and then shut it down cleanly but since you have uninstalled Windows, that's not an option.\nSo, your other choice is (from man ntfs-3g):\n   remove_hiberfile\n          Unlike  in  case  of  read-only  mount,  the read-write mount is\n          denied if the NTFS volume is hibernated.  One  needs  either  to\n          resume  Windows  and  shutdown  it  properly, or use this option\n          which will remove the Windows  hibernation  file.  Please  note,\n          this  means  that  the  saved Windows session will be completely\n          lost. Use this option under your own responsibility.\n\nSo, just add the remove_hiberfile option and try to mount it again:\nsudo mount -t \"ntfs\" -o remove_hiberfile /dev/sdb5 \"/media/imad/Disque local\"\n\nor\nsudo ntfs-3g -o remove_hiberfile /dev/sdb5 \"/media/imad/Disque local\"\n\nThat should mount the drive correctly and since it will delete the hibernated session file, it should mount normally from now on.\n\nA: Your question is why you cannot mount the file system. The reason is that it wasn't properly unmounted. This usually happens if you don't shut down Windows the correct way, don't use \"Safe removal\" before you disconnect the disk, or you're using Windows 8, which doesn't shutdown properly (by design) unless you deactivate \"Fastboot\". \nIt's a very common issue with Windows systems. \n", "Q: How to install Teamviewer on 14.04?

If you want to use it with Ubuntu/Linux, you need to install Wine and start this app using Wine. The official page will provide you with a download link for a Linux version of StackTracker but there is no Linux package in there only a fake link. I may be wrong but I was not able to find any package built for Linux in there.\nStackTracker can be found and downloaded on this page, and it won't require users to actualy login or enter a password or things like that. The application displays a task tray notification when someone has posted an answer or a comment to a question you are tracking on any of the StackExchange sites. Clicking the notification will open the corresponding question in your browser.\nAlready tested it in Windows and also in Linux (via Wine), and it works fine. It uses very few resources if any.\n", "Q: Tap-to-click not working in Lubuntu 14.04 I have quite a strange problem.\nMy sister upgraded her Lubuntu yesterday to 14.04 and everything went alright. After some reboots though (she said she hadn't done anything except for messing with the look and feel settings) the tap-to-click on the touchpad suddenly stopped working. Scrolling works alright.\nWhat I've done:\n\n\n*\n\n*Checked the mouse options. Everything was fine.\n\n*Logged in as guest. Tap-to-click worked just fine.\n\n*Put in the line Option \"TapButton1\" \"1\" into the inputclass section of 50-synaptics.conf. After rebooting/logging out nothing has changed.\n\n*Tried synclient tapbutton1=1. That works in the current session.\n\n*Put in the xorg.conf folder a new configuration file.\n\n\nStill, I wasn't able to fix the problem permanently.

And awkwardly this worked, now my touchpad and external mouse are working just fine.\nI don't know if this will solve your problem, because like i said is an awkward solution/process for an awkward problem...\n\nA: Since you found a command that works in the current session synclient tapbutton1=1\nAdd that command to /etc/rc.local and it should execute each time you re-boot.\n\nA: Anyone new comer might want to follow this answer: https://askubuntu.com/a/971519/905106\nIn my case installing both libinput and synaptic worked.\nThere might come a time when you happen to remove any of the above package and your touchpad or Keybord stops working , so then you need to go root shell in recovery from grub menu, then install those packages. Make sure your network cable/usb thethering is plugged in beforhand.\n\nA: Had the same problem after upgrading to ubuntu 14.04 (xubuntu actually). I've installed a touchpad utility from synaptic package manager. Upon opening it the tap to click option had been disabled, I've enabled it and it now works.\n\nA: Had a similar issue.

Also, is there any other way of emulating Windows 7 in Ubuntu that might work better (excluding WINE)? Thanks!\n\nA: VirtualBox Gaming is in general not a good experience.

I have installed VLC Media Player using Synaptic, which uses the official Ubuntu repositories. VLC Media Player works fine, until I attempt to use a skin. I go into VLC Media Player's settings and choose the skin file like I am supposed to. I restart VLC Media Player, but something interesting happens. It shows in the taskbar as if it is opening, but the GUI doesn't load. Then within one second, VLC Media Player disappears from the taskbar, as if it closed itself or crashed. Sometimes when this happens, I get a window that says \"Lubuntu 14.04 has experienced an internal error.\" Then it asks me to send the bug report, which I usually do, but that doesn't have anything to do with VLC Media Player. My question is: What is wrong? Is this a bug? Have I done something wrong? (I don't think so though, because I had no problem using skins in Lubuntu 13.10 Saucy Salamander.) What can I do to fix this?\n\nA: My wife had a similar problem after upgrading Lubuntu to 14.04 on her laptop. Under Lubuntu 13.10, she had all the skins (available for download from VLC's website) to choose from and changed skins frequently. I have no idea which skin was being used when Lubuntu was upgraded, but interestingly, the VLC icon that flashed on LXPanel for a moment was the \"santa-hatted\" one from Christmas. Subsequent times my wife tried again to start VLC from a desktop shortcut (5 different shortcuts to playlists we'd set up for her months ago) and got nothing. VLC wouldn't start.\nThere is probably a faster or easier solution for this/these problem(s); but the following is what I did to fix VLC back up to the way it was for her before:\n\n\n*\n\n*To work with the files as root (as PCManFM no longer includes the option in a drop-down), go to Menu --> Accessories --> LXTerminal (or Ctrl+T) and type: gksu pcmanfm\n\n*Provide your password, then go to View --> Show Hidden (or Ctrl+H)\nDouble-click the .config folder, select (single-click) the vlc folder inside, hit Shift+Del and confirm (Enter or click the \"Yes\" button) you want to permanently delete the vlc folder.\n\n*Click the back icon \"<\" and double-click the .local folder, then double-click the share folder inside and select (single-click) the vlc folder inside, hit Shift+Del and Enter\n\n*View files (change from Places) as Directory Tree, navigate to /usr/share, select (single-click) that vlc folder, hit Shift+Del and Enter\n\n*\"X\" out of PCManFM and back in LXTerminal, type: sudo apt-get remove vlc\n\n*Leave everything else it suggests that you also remove and just remove the one vlc package. As soon as it is done removing VLC, type: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install vlc\n\n*\"X\" out of LXTerminal and go to (your default) Web Browser, type in http://www.videolan.org/vlc/skins.php and click the \"here\" hyperlink where you see \"Download all the skins at once here (37MiB).\"\n\n*Click the radio button to Save File and Enter (or click the \"Okay\" button).\n\n*Go to File Manager (PCManFM), double-click the Downloads folder, right-click (F12) vlc-skins.zip and choose \"Extract Here\" from the drop-down menu. Scroll down to find the (probably still-selected) vlc-skins.zip file and hit Shift+Del and Enter to delete it.\n\n*Click one of the skins, then hit Ctrl+A to select all, right-click (F12) one of them and choose \"Cut\" from the drop-down menu.\n\n*Click the back icon \"<\" and double-click the .local folder, double-click the share folder inside and double-click the vlc folder in that. Right-click (F12) in an empty space, choose \"Create New... --> Folder\" and name it skins2\n\n*Double-click to enter the skins2 folder you just made, right-click (F12) an empty space and choose \"Paste\" from the drop-down menu.\n\n*Right-click (F12) one of the skins and choose \"Copy Path(s)\" from the drop-down menu.\n\n*Go to Menu --> Sound & Video --> VLC media player\n\n*Go to Tools --> Preferences (or Ctrl+P) and under Interface Settings, Look & Feel; select the radio button for \"Use custom skin.\"\n\n*Click in the \"Skin resource file\" text box and right-click (F12) or Ctrl+V to paste. Enter, or click the \"Save\" button.\n\n*Go to Media --> Quit (or Ctrl+Q). Go back to Menu --> Sound & Video --> VLC media player\nThe skin you copied the path to should be on VLC now (and changeable) and whatever files, playlists and/or shortcuts you had set up before to work with VLC should work again as well.\n", "Q: Wireless Won't Connect in 14.04 I'm still very new to Ubuntu and I need help resolving an issue with my wireless.

For initial set-up you may find Percona's my.cnf generating tool useful. This tool will help generate a my.cnf file that will be much more optimised for your specific server capabilities and your requirements.\nDo not replace your existing my.cnf file with Percona's one if you have already loaded data into the database. Some of the changes that will be in the file will be incompatible as they alter how data is stored on the hard disk and you'll be unable to start MySQL.\n\nSource\n", "Q: Uninstall Copy.com from Ubuntu 12.04 I have installed the cloud storage program, \"Copy\" and want to uninstall it.

(You don't need to use sudo if no other user accounts on your system are using Copy)...\nsudo rm -rf /home/<user>/.config/autostart/CopyAgent.desktop\n\n\n*Log out and log back in.  This will shut down the running copy process so it does not re-create the files you are about to delete in step 3.  (You can also just kill the \"CopyAgent\" process using System Monitor if you don't want to log out.)\n\n*Execute the following for each user, if necessary.

I have an HP xw4400 workstation that I'm trying to install Ubuntu on. I have tried the 14.04 installation CD and a 12.04 minimal install disc neither of which seem to work. I want to focus on the 12.04 minimal cd install for this question.

What do I need to do to get this to work past this point. \n\nA: Welcome to Ubutnu if you already have a OS(Windows) running try opening the CD from Windows, this might be a problem with the CD Burning or the DVD reader. If it taking time opening the CD in windows that means while booting CD is not getting enough time to boot. for this you need to try multiple times to booting from CD.\nif it opened fine in windows then it might be problem with Burning the CD.\n", "Q: Internet disconnects by itself and never reconnects unless system restarted I am using Ubuntu 13.10 and a wireless internet from a modem \"Reliance Netconnect\" for the internet.\nI've installed Ubuntu two days back along with my Windows system.\nSo here's a detailed summary of what happens:\nI open my computer, the internet connects after I go to the top-right corner, select the signal logo and click on the \"Reliance connection\" (the only connection for internet on the PC).\nIt connects immediately and says \"You're registered on the home network.\" and the internet works fine. However, each time I've opened my computer and connected, there's this problem: it automatically disconnects after a while (which is around 5-10 minutes I think).\nLet me rephrase: it connects all fine and then disconnects by itself after a while of usage.\nNow comes the main problem. NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I TRY TO CONNECT IT THROUGH THE SAME SIGNAL LOGO, IT JUST WON'T CONNECT EVER.\nIt only works when I open it again later and because now I know that rebooting does the trick (well it merely refreshes everything), I reboot to reconnect to internet.\nNow, as anyone would tell you, rebooting is not a viable alternative to reconnecting.\nWhat's surprising is I Googled it and not many people have this problem. On two separate threads, people first asked for full details about their modem and networks, drivers, etc. but weren't able to help at all.\nI am writing this long piece because I am using my Windows at the moment. Please help me. I don't want to come back to Windows. Ubuntu is so awesome. Everything else is so attractive and I've set up fine. Just this problem is forcing me to leave Ubuntu - or any Linux for that matter. Please.\n\nA: I didn't find any answers for this, thus no solution, but there seems to be a quick trick that I recently found.\nI thought I may share this so that people experiencing the problem will be partially helped at least.\nAfter you're done on your computer, disconnect the internet from the 'Signal' or networks menu on topbar. In the end of the same list, there will be Edit Connections/just Edit. The first step isn't necessary, but recommended.\nClick on the Edit/Edit Connections. A window will open, titled Network Connections. Under Mobile Broadband segment, you'll see the connections you've made. Delete them all. ALL. (Not the Ethernet ones, that's unnecessary.)\nSo, basically, before shutting down, if you delete all your connections (now I only have one, because I make one each time I log on), next time you open the computer and create a fresh connection, your internet won't disconnect like that.\nNote that you have to create the new connections from Settings>Network>Mobile Broadband dialog boxes, not through the same Network Connections window that you accessed from the network menu in the top bar.\nOnce you do this, and make a new connection every time (with username and password if needed), your internet will remain connected as long as the computer runs.\nYou can disregard the following part.\nSuppose you don't do it, now what happens is this:\nThe existing connection remains on the system. Probably because your mobile broadband dongle/modem are older and/or slightly incompatible with Ubuntu, the connections don't refresh and there seems to be some sort of problem in the system in reconnecting ONCE THEY DISCONNECT.\nThe old connections remain there and may connect on new session/startup, but they randomly disconnect for IDK why and then cannot be reconnected because of bad configuration that you cannot change with regular tweaks. \nEven if you delete your connections and make a new one on a session which has booted with some/one connection(s) already there, it doesn't work.\n", "Q: Is it possible to use wine to run window games that is already installed on a external hard drive (and to install future software on the external)? I would like to know if it is possible to run Windows games that are already installed on an external hard drive and have it load up though wine?  Or do the games need to be installed by wine first before i can play them?\nAnd also i like to know how to tell wine to install any future Windows software that does work on wine to install them on a different drive than hard drive inside my computer? \nand if the answer to the first question is the 2nd one. what will happen to the one already on the hard drive if i manage to get wine to install it there?\n\nA: Depends on game. Most modern games require proper installation in the registry so it would be better to first install the game through Wine.\nBut if you know what keys game uses, you can easily import them inside Wine registry. It is simple ini-like text file $WINEPREFIX/system.reg and $WINEPREFIX/user.reg.\nTo use multiple drives, you have to tell Wine where are they located. This can be done in Wine configuration.

When it wakes up it shows the screensaver until I press a key or move the mouse then it asks me for my password. All that is working beautifully. The issue is that when I open the lid, for a second or so I can see what is on the desktop, all the open windows, etc. Then it does a fade into the screensaver. The expected behaviour is that I see a blank screen, or the login prompt, immediately.\nI've removed the screen saver (set it to be a black screen) but that made no difference.\nIs this something that can be configured?\nSystem details: Lenova E540, Mint 16, Xfce 4.10.\n(In contrast, my Ubuntu 10.04 notebook did not have this issue: when the case was opened it always showed a blank screen. However I always had to suspend from the power control menu, as closing the case was unreliable as a way to get it to suspend, so maybe that was why??)\n\nMore Notes:\n(Thanks to Nattgew for finding a related bug report.)\nThere appears to be a distinct difference between closing the screen, and going to the power manager and choosing suspend.\nClose screen: screen visible when opening, then it goes to screensaver, then I have to type password to login. Wifi net connection is preserved.\nExplicit suspend: wifi is disconnected. When I resume the screen is visible, it doesn't go to screensaver, it doesn't ask password. It needs to reconnect to wifi.\n  --> FIXED THIS BIT. launch xfce4-session-settings, go to last tab (\"Advanced\") and mark \"Lock screen before sleep\" checkbox. You also have to check the checbox that says the same thing in Power Manager preferences!! (Source.)   So, now I've fixed this, both ways of suspending show the screen fading away into the screensaver, then prompt for password. However the explicit suspend is still the only one that disconnects wifi.\n(Using pm-suspend from the commandline works just like going to the power manager menu.)\n\nA: This seems to be present in a lot of distros. This is a workaround I'm using for Cinnamon on Debian, but it should be possible to do something similar with other distro/window manager combinations:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use dconf-editor to change the button-suspend action at org>cinnamon>settings-daemon>plugins>power to 'nothing' (you could also amend lid-close-ac-action and lid-close-bettery-action as well if you're using a laptop).\n\n*Save the following script to a convenient location:\n#!/bin/bash\ncinnamon-screensaver-command -l\nsystemctl suspend\n\n\n*Use the System Settings app to create a custom keybinding for the sleep key that points to the script.\nAfter this it behaves as it should. You can see the lock screen pop up briefly before it goes to sleep, which is reassuring.\n\nA: It turns out the key is that it is a screensaver \"problem\", nothing to do with power management, suspend or resume!\nSo, go to Screensaver preferences, then the advanced tab. In the bottom-right is \"Fading and Colormaps\". Uncheck \"Fade to Black when Blanking\".\n(I also have Grab Desktop Images unchecked, though I personally use the \"Blank Screen Only\" screensaver, so that is academic.)\nThis solution works equally well with lid-closing or using pm-suspend or using the suspend button from the power management menu; and equally well with opening the lid, or pressing the power button to resume. In a couple of my tests I did see the screen flash on briefly after a resume, when using power button to suspend and resume; one of those times it effectively crashed xfce, perhaps as I was testing too quickly. However using the lid-closing/lid-opening technique it has been always behaved correctly (so far).\n", "Q: How to open a file as you type out its directory?

I want to know if I can open the file with something like this:\ncd ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/test\\ x/**command goes here**/armored.jpg\n\nThanks\n\nA: You can do this:\nxdg-open ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/test\\ x/armored.jpg\ncd means change directory so essentially terminal is expecting a path-to-directory where you want to change to.\nxdg-open opens a file in default applications but as it opens a file it expects path-to-file, you can also use xdg-open to open directory in nautilus(if it is your default file manager) in GUI.\n\nA: You should be running the command and passing the path to the file as an argument.  Your commands would work if you rearranged it like so:\nxdg-open ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/test\\ x/armored.jpg\n\nThe first word you use in the terminal is the command you are trying to run (which can be a program, built-in, function, etc) and all the other words are passed to that program as arguments.  In this case, you're telling xdg-open to display your JPG, so you'll put the command first, and then the path to the picture.\n\nA: You can use the double ampersands. Like:\ncd ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/test\\ x/ && xdg-open armored.jpg \nThis will execute the first command, and move to the second if the first is successful.\nor you could do:\ncd ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/test\\ x/; xdg-open armored.jpg\nWhich will run the first command, and then the second, whether the first fails or not.\n\nA: cd ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/test\\ x/ xdg-open armored.jpg\n\nIf you run this command, terminal considers the whole after cd as a directory and it breaks if it contains any spaces and discards the part after space.In this case, the above command will get you only into the directory ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/test\\ x. If you really want to open the file using xdg-open then your command needs breaking like below.\ncd ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/test\\ x/; xdg-open armored.jpg\n\nThe terminal parses the second command(ie, after ;) whether the first command succeeded or not.\nExample:\n$ cd ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/test\\ x/; xdg-open armored.jpg\nbash: cd: /home/avinash/Pictures/Wallpapers/test x/: No such file or directory\ngvfs-open: armored.jpg: error opening location: Error when getting information for file '/home/avinash/armored.jpg': No such file or directory\n\nor\ncd ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/test\\ x/ && xdg-open armored.jpg\n\nThe terminal parses the second command only if the first command would ended in success.\nExample:\n$ cd ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/test\\ x/ && xdg-open armored.jpg\nbash: cd: /home/avinash/Pictures/Wallpapers/test x/: No such file or directory\n\n", "Q: HP Office Jet 8600 scanner support I recently upgraded an older Windows 7 computer to Ubuntu 14.04, and added a new HP OfficeJet 8600 all-in-one printer.

Possible priority values are between -20 and 19.  You will have to make sure you replace the Synergy above with the correct path to launch it.\n", "Q: How to get the sendto mail recipient in Xubuntu 14.04 to use Geary email client?

While opening Gparted, it shows a 1TB unallocated space in the hard disk.\nI format again the whole hard drive and make new partition table with Windows 7 bootable USB drive and leave a 200Gb unallocated space. But it failed with the same option.

Ubuntu does not deal well with GPT as I understand.\nThere could be some solution for your problem on this link. I have an older computer so I can't say it will work or not for you.\nIf it does not, you can use gdisk which is designed to work on GUID Partition Table (GPT) disks, and automatically convert your partition table from MBR to GPT format thus restoring your original disk configuration. It would be better to ask a pro to help you with this one, do you still benefit for support from your manufacturer? This won't be easy if you try do it yourself.\nOr you can use FixParts to replace your GUID Partition Table (GPT) with a Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table type. I am not sure at all if the download links provided on that page are still working for FixParts. There is a complete tutorial on how to use FixParts but the download links work some time and other time they do not. You can download Fix parts for Windows as I understand you have Win7 installed on your computer.\nIt is important to understand that you cannot use both methods, you have to either fix your partition table with GDISK or with FixParts but you cannot test them both. So it is up to you, and I strongly recommend you ask someone, a friend with good computing skills or a proffesional, maybe your computer manufacturer for advice. Tell them you want to install Windows and Ubuntu, and that you want to use a multiboot configuration on your computer.\n", "Q: suspend is not working after updating to Ubuntu 14.04 from 13.10 I am not able to put my laptop to suspend(sleep) mode,If I click on suspend it just locks the screen and nothing happens ?\nI updated my previous version of UBUNTU from 13.04 to 13.10 then to 14.04 \nAny Idea why this is happening or any work around to fix the issue ?\nI am using DELL VOSTRO 3400 with 64 bit OS\n\nA: You're possibly seeing this bug: Black screen after login from suspend in Xubuntu 14.04.

I upgraded to Ubuntu Server 14.04 expecting the default apache installation would use the new event MPM, but instead I find the old memory-eating prefork.\nI've successfully set up event MPM in Arch Linux, but I'm failing to do so on Ubuntu. I keep getting:\nApache is running a threaded MPM, but your PHP Module is not compiled to be threadsafe. You need to recompile PHP\n\nI' ve already installed php-fpm, and configured apache2 to use it, but since the config files for apache2 are different on Ubuntu, i'm not quite sure whether i'm doing it on the right place.\nAny idea on how to make PHP thread safe so I can use apache2 event-mpm? (without having to manually recompile php, of course)\n\nA: You can install multiple ways for Apache to communicate with PHP in parallel. Maybe you have (still) the old mod_php installed, additionally to fastcgi/php-fpm. \nYou can see which modules your Apache has loaded at runtime with\napache2ctl -M\n\nIf needed, use sudo to get root privileges. If you see php5_module (shared) among the modules your Apache is currently using, the old mod_php is still installed and blocks you from using mpm_worker or mpm_event.\n\nA: To disable event MPM, you can do sudo a2dismod mpm_event and after that to enable prefork, you should do sudo a2enmod mpm_prefork.\nFinally restart apache:\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\n\nA: For me following fully work on debian: \n\n\n*\n\n*Disable prefork, enable event: a2dismod mpm_prefork && a2enmod mpm_event\n\n*remove mod-php5: aptitude remove libapache2-mod-php5\n\n*Be aware that you have each php_ Option in your VHost encapsulate by <IfModule mod_php5.c></IfModule>, otherwise apache won't restart\n\n*do service apache2 restart\n\nA: This worked for me.\nFirst check if you have this package installed:\ndpkg -l | grep libapache2-mod-php5\n\nIf you have it just remove it:\napt-get remove libapache2-mod-php5\n\n\nA: Look for the following in the Load Modules sections of your apache configuration file :\nLoadModule mpm_event_module modules/mod_mpm_event.so\n\nAnd replace it with the following module :\nLoadModule mpm_prefork_module modules/mod_mpm_prefork.so\n\n\nA: the php5 module needs the prefork mpm, and to disable prefork, one has to disable php5.\nunder debian, i did the following, as root:\ndisable the prefork mpm\na2dismod mpm_prefork\n\nenable the event mpm, or whatever mpm you might prefer.\nnote i found event mpm was not recommended for apache 2.2 or earlier\na2enmod mpm_event\n\nto disable the php5 module load, but without uninstallation.\na2dismod php5\n\nto test the overall correctness of the resulting apache config.\nerrors would need to be coped with as per the answer of @sulther above.\napache2ctl -t\n\nrestart apache\nsystemctl restart apache2\n\nin case php is still needed, a threadsafe version should be installed.\nsee: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-apache-http-with-mpm-event-and-php-fpm-on-freebsd-12-0\ngood luck\n"]
