I have forgotten how to do a simple keyboard copy-paste procedue. I know I highlight the prefered text but forgot what key I hit to paste.

Aside from that, one can also copy text with CtrlInsert(Ins). \nHighlighted text+middle click optin works well between terminal-nonterminal windows.\n", "Q: Ubuntu SDK cannot install armhf kit I tried to use the Kit Autocreator in the Devices tab, but the click ends with the following error:\n\nReading package lists...\nBuilding dependency tree...\nReading state information... \nbuild-essential is already the newest version.

I had a dual boot windows 7 Home Premium + Ubuntu laptop whose motherboard suddenly went dead on me. Lets call it old laptop.\nNow I have arranged a new laptop. It has a dual boot Windows 7 ultimate + Ubuntu installation. In both laptops Ubuntu is installed on a single partition. \nI am allowed to wipe out the Ubuntu installation from the new laptop and install old laptop's copy of Ubuntu. I looked around but didn't find anything on how to do it. \nIs there anyway that I can get exact Ubuntu image from the internal hard disk of my old laptop and set it up on the new laptop without doing anything to windows 7 installation on the new laptop?\nI need an exact image running because there were a lot many packages installed and development work carried out on my old laptop in the past few months. \nWill someone please help me ? \n\nA: I suggest to mount your external drive to the new laptop's Ubuntu and simply copy the stuff from external drive to new Laptop's Ubuntu. Merely moving Ubuntu from one laptop to another is not a good idea(provided both the laptops are different). Linux kernel has lot of driver modules and it won't be working that easily. Best bet to copy the data and applications(from /usr and /opt) of the external drive to new Laptop's Ubuntu's /usr and /opt.\n", "Q: tftp-hpa only works when restart I am running tftp-hpa server which was installed as shown below on Ubuntu 15.04\nsudo apt-get install tftpd-hpa\n\nThe configuration file name tftp-hpa is located in /etc/defaults as shown \n # /etc/default/tftpd-hpa\nRUN_DAEMON=\"yes\"\nTFTP_USERNAME=\"tftp\"\nTFTP_DIRECTORY=\"/var/lib/tftpboot\"\nTFTP_ADDRESS=\"[::]:69\"\nTFTP_OPTIONS=\"--secure\"\n\nThe problem is that I can transfer files from /var/lib/tftpboot only once.

If anybody is having similar issues to this, what I have above fixed the problem for me, but I can't exactly recommend it unless you at least sort of know what you're doing. Like I said, i don't really know what I'm doing, but I do know that I was playing with fire and the fact that my system is still running is  a miracle.\n\nA: Any specific reasons why you were trying to upgrade? \n14.04.3 is LTS...in april we will be getting 16.04 LTS anyway.

I was hoping this feature has changed in the past 4 years.... I see discussions from 2012 about it. \nI had to do a reinstall of Ubuntu 14, before that, I did a backup, which ended up being totally useless, but as a plan B, I exported my keys to an encrypted file with Veracrypt. Well now the bad news, that export only sent out the public keys, and the private keys are lost, with everything else lost with the unrecoverable backup. \nHOW DO I EXPORT BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC KEYS? or do I just have to make my keypair somehwere else, save them on an USB and import to seahorse? this is pretty convoluted.\n\nA: You can't export them both at the same time, from what I've seen. I exported my private key by pressing the \"export secret key\" button inside of SeaHorse (double click your key, go under the \"Details\" tab, then you should see the button) and exported my public key using the command \"gpg --output \"My Public Key.asc\" --export -a \" in the terminal.

I want to setup a VPS that is is open to a few people for them to execute a program. They will connect via SSH. Is there a way for me to keep them from running root commands (sudo, su)?\nI tried installing Openssh-server on my laptop running ubuntu 14.04.3 and tried connection via my phone using my password and even though I had PermitRootLogin set to no, I was able to run sudo commands.\n\nA: Maybe you want to check out this link.\nThe point is that PermitRootLogin diasbles login via the user root. This is a security risk. However, your normal user can always login an then escalate to root (e.g. via sudo). An attacker would need two sets of passwords: your user's and root's password, which makes it harder (given you have sane password policies).\nIf you want to disable a user from sudo you have to take this priviledge from him. However, this woud request you doing it on your laptop you want to connect to. AND FURTHER, this will disable your user to use sudo on your laptop -- so careful: you might lock yourself out of the system when your only user is removed.

I get this message from VMware:\nA device ID has been used that is out of range for your system.\nSound will be disconnected. \n\nI want to be able to solve all this kind of problems in order to make a fully usable OS so I can deploy it at PCs at work.\n\nA: Assuming a Windows host: As the Vmware knowledge base states, you need to enable stereo mix:\n\nSolution\n  Enabling \"Stereo Mix\" on Windows host fixes the problem. The stereo mix option is seen under \"Recording\" tab of sound settings. If it's not seen, install the specific sound card driver for the underlying physical sound card based on its manufacturer. Once the stereo mix option is available, it needs to be enabled for the scenarios where we specify the host sound card for the VM in its sound card settings explicitly. If the default host sound card is used, there will be no sound issues and hence no need of enabling the stereo mix. \n  It's important to select \"Listen to this device\" for \"stereo mix\" under the \"Listen\" tab of its properties. The same applies to the microphone as well. These are part of the sound settings.\nSelect the playback device for the microphone to be based on the installed physical sound card driver. For example, if the driver is from Realtek, then it would be \"Speakers (Realtek High Definition Audio).\" And for the stereo mix, this would be \"Default Playback Device.\" This set up is necessary to get the recording to work with stereo mix enabled.\nAfter all of the above steps, while specifying the host sound card in the VM settings, speakers either based on the real headset connected or the physical sound card driver can be selected. The resolution proposed above works for\n  both. \nNote: It's necessary to check that the guest sound card drivers are installed and set up properly. For this, selecting the default host sound card in the VM setting is recommend to check that the necessary sound drivers are installed for the guest so that both playback and recording works. \n\n\nA: There is actually a fairly easy, but a counterintuitive, way of playing audio on any Linux VM that supports Pulseaudio. It will also work on any VM platform, not just Hyper-V.\nAnd the best thing about it is that it doesn't require changing any system setting on either the VM or the host machine. And it doesn't require you to run your VM in an enhanced session either and share your host system's audio drivers with it.\nShort answer:\nInstall OS-appropriate version of ffmpeg utility on both your host machine and the VM.\nRun the following command on your host machine:\nffplay -nodisp -ac 2 -acodec pcm_s16le -ar 48000 -analyzeduration 0 -probesize 32 -f s16le -i udp://0.0.0.0:18181?listen=1\n\nRun the following command on your VM:\nffmpeg -f pulse -i \"remote.monitor\" -ac 2 -acodec pcm_s16le -ar 48000 -f s16le \"udp://IP.OF.YOUR.HOST:18181\"\n\nDetailed answer:\nThis article provides a more detailed guidance of the process and explains what the commands actually do: GETTING AUDIO WORKING ON UBUNTU VM ON HYPER-V\n", "Q: partitions showing different sizes on gparted and MS Disk Management I'm trying to install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on an HPG60 Laptop.\nI'm having a difficulty to install this coz I cant see the unallocated space I prepared in Windows.\nAs you can see on the attached screenshot:\n\nI've prepared an unallocated space 96.72GB using Disk Management. \nBut when I boot up ubuntu and check Gparted, \nI'm seeing this instead\n\nAn unallocated space of 1MB?!\nNever encountered this before. I've installed ubuntu on a lenovo laptop that I use on office but I never like this before.\nAnybody have any idea why this is happening?\n\nA: Simple Answer:\n\nWhat is Happening?\n\n\n*\n\n*152.53 + 96.72 = 249.25 (Gparted is not recognising difference between Unallocated and other partitions)\n\n\nWhy is it happening?\n\n\n*\n\n*Dynamic Disc - Not supported\n\n\nWhat to do?\n\n\n*\n\n*Convert to Basic (data will be lost!)\n\n\n**Detailed Answer:**  \nIt is easy to make out from your screen-shot that you are using Dynamic Type disk :\n\nUbuntu (I would say all Linux OS) and bootloader GRUB cannot recognize a Microsoft dynamic disk/volume/partition (SFS), and so they cannot boot from it.\n\nYou might need this information:\n\nBasic Disk uses a partition table to manage all partitions on the disk, and it is supported by all Linux OS, DOS and all Windows versions. A disk with installed OS would be default initialized to a basic one. A basic disk contains basic volumes, such as primary partitions, extended partition, and all logical partitions are contained in extended partition.\nDynamic Disk is supported in Windows 2000 and later operating system (only). Dynamic disks do not use a partition table to track all partitions, but use a hidden database (LDM) to track information about dynamic volumes or dynamic partitions on the disk (which Gparted is not understanding). With dynamic disks you can create volumes that span multiple disks such as spanned and striped volumes, and can also create fault-tolerant volumes such as mirrored volumes and RAID 5 volumes.\nThis is the reason why Gparted is acting weirdly\n\nWhat to do?\n\nYou need to convert your Dynamic Disk to Basic Disk.\nFirst of all, BACK UP ALL YOUR DATA!\nYou can use any good tool for conversion. I will tell you with DISKPART\n\n*\n\n*Boot into any Windows installation media and go to \"Repair my computer\"\n\n\n*In Advanced Options, go to Command Prompt\n\n\n*Enter the following commands one by one\ndiskpart\nlist disk\nselect disk 0  #(The number may be different in your system)\nclean  #(Erases Everything (including windows))\nconvert basic\nexit\nNow you can easily install Both Windows and Ubuntu.\nELSE : If you don't want to completely clean your hard disk, You might consider to install Ubuntu on Virtualbox\n\nA: In my case, I was trying to resize and move partitions using GParted Live on Windows 10 installed Disk. My Disk was Basic and not Dynamic.\nAfter successful partitioning operations in GParted Live, partitions size was unchanged when I booted in Windows 10.\nEven Disk Management was not showing correct sizes.\nOnly GParted Live and EaseUS Partition Master were showing it correctly.\nThe only solution worked for me was after restarting Windows 10 it started reflecting correct sizes.\n", "Q: Folder on desktop as root I have a folder at /media/TEST\nI'm trying to make it available from the desktop using a folder widget.\nThe folder is owned by root and I cannot change the permissions for \"other\" from forbidden, neither from graphical interface nor from cmd line.\nAnyone has a way to launch the folder widget as root maybe?\n\nA: Used a .desktop file to launch dolphin as root with gksu.\nContent:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=TEST\nComment=Open TEST with root\nExec=gksu dolphin /media/TEST\nIcon=file-manager\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Application;System;\n\nIf anyone finds a better way, feel free to answer and I will accept!\nFor example gksu requires the password every time, a way that doesn't need it would be appreciated.\n", "Q: Is sudo's bruteforce protection really helpful? In this question: Why is there a delay when entering a wrong password? it appears that there is a 1-2 seconds timeout in sudo once it is given a wrong password in order to make cracking attempts more difficult.\nThis is annoying for many users, and is it really a solution to the problem?\nWhat prevents an attacker from running thousands of sudo instances in parallel and testing thousands of different passwords per second? The timeout doesn't prevent this.\n\nA: Get your password correct first time?\nCuriously I thought to test your claim that the delay wouldn't stop a brute. It seems silly that it could allow this... But here I am executing 2000 separate threads at once. It works.\nparallel -j2000 sh -c 'echo $\"{}\\n\" | sudo -S echo; echo done' -- {1..2000}\n\nThat litters auth.log with failures but it never pears above \"2 incorrect password attempts\".\nI believed  that PAM was supposed to stop people. Hence the delay.\nThis might be by [poor] design or it might just be a [quite serious] bug.\nI have a system with a weak password on the network. I'm tempted to try this method to see it it can really scale up to brute-force the password.\n\nA: The delay isn't just about making brute-force attacks harder. It's also about information leakage. There was a famous SunOS exploit years ago that depended on knowing a password was wrong by seeing how quickly commands returned.\nSecurity attacks often don't rely on a single vector, but combine vectors in interesting ways to leverage small bugs or oversights. \nHiding good vs. bad attempts from attackers you reduce the overall attack surface. It's the right thing to do.\nIf you don't like it, there are other authentication methods you can use. \n\nA: How do you see this happening \"in parallel\"? \nWith an 8 char password you have (26+26+10+12=) 74^8 possible words. Makes for 899.194.740.203.776 unique words. With a 3 second delay (it is 3 ;-) ) that makes 85.539.834 years (899.194.740.203.776 * 3 / (365*24*60*60)). Lets assume you need half the attempts so that would be 42.769.917 years. Even with 100000 (impossible I know) attempts in parallel it would (in average) take roughly 427 years. \nA system that needs protection (for instance a user account database) will have a good password set (so the 8 chars might be even more) and also have a mail system set up to alarm an admin that someone is failing the password a lot. \nStill believe it is possible? \n", "Q: Windows Dualboot Bootloader Problem Being new to Ubuntu, for the past two days I am having trouble getting my Ubuntu and Windows dualboot to work together. The setup is as follows:\nPartition Setup\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda2 is where I want Ubuntu to be installed\n\n*/dev/sda3 is the windows C: partition\n\n*/dev/sda4 is a extended partition with windows D: (and hopefully later on the ubuntu swap partition)\n\n\nAt first I wanted to keep the windows bootloader instead of grub2. After messing around and figuring stuff out I installed grub on /dev/sda2 and added a entry to the windows bootloader with EasyBCD. However whenever I tried starting into Ubuntu I just got presented with a grub terminal (not grub rescue) and when using the ls command I got presented with the content of my C: drive.\nAfter a lot of messing around I gave up and decided to let grub2 be my bootloader. I reinstalled Ubuntu again and everything seemed to be worked correctly on the first start. Grub booted up nicely and everything worked. Upon restarting my pc however it kept rebooting after the BIOS screen, so the bootloader was probably damaged again. I tried reinstalling Ubuntu again and once again it worked on the first boot but the ones after that the same thing happened.\nI entered a liveCD and used bootrepair but I kept the same issue. I now have no idea how to procceed and I was hoping someone here might have any idea or suggestion on how to fix this.\nSome final info: I do not know if this matters or not but my computer is said to RAID with a 24 GB cache SSD for windows.\nBonus question: I also have no idea why there is 4 Mib of unallocated space at the end of my drive, but as long as I can get the issue fixed I will be super happy and grateful.\n\nA: \nI also have no idea why there is 4 Mib of unallocated space at the end\n  of my drive\n  That is OEM partition and you just can't do anything. Stop worrying about that.\n\nPlease read the installation guide and how to make partitions before going any further.\nBased on the current disk partitions you have - you can only install Ubuntu Linux on /dev/sda2(ext4-around 117GB).

Is there a way to get User Confirmation(Like Are you Sure-Yes/No) type dialog box when I execute a script(by double click)? I don't mean in Terminal, but a Graphical confirmation box, something like this:\n\n(I know the image is from windows, I couldn't find a Linux one)\n\nA: You could use xmessage in the script itself. Put something like this after the \"shebang\":\nxmessage \"Are you sure?\"\nThis will display a graphical message saying \"Are you sure?\" with an \"okay\" button.\nYou can configure xmessage to have more than one button and change what's written in it. You can also configure the actions done by each button. \nFor example,\nxmessage -buttons ok:0,cancel:1 \"Are you sure?\"  \n\nSee man xmessage for all the options (there are lots of them).\n\nA: Instead of telling you how to do it, I will tell you that you should not be doing that.\nTL;DR - Do not change your script. Instead configure your file manager or figure out why your users accidentally run it.\nEDIT: You seem to treat your script as somehow special, as if the general settings are not good enough and your script needs special confirmation from the user. Double clicking on it is the confirmation. If you find that your users run it by accident then you have to figure out why they do it and solve that instead. Then your real problem is not how to require confirmation but how to prevent your users from running it accidentally.\nFrom the way you expose your problem it seems that you expect your program (script) to be run by navigating to where the file is, and then clicking on it from the file manager. Think about all other programs in your system. How many do you start like that? Do you navigate to /usr/local/bin when starting firefox? Of course you do not. You click on it from the applications menu. (gnome tweak is a python script maybe that's a better example)\nHopefully you will not consider clicking on it from the applications menu an accident. So your problem becomes how to make you script appear there instead of using the file manager. To do this, you do the following things:\n\n\n*\n\n*place your script away from the other files where the user may click on it by accident (the typical place is /usr/local/bin/ for a system wide installation or ~/.local/bin/ for a user install)\n\n*create a Desktop Entry file (read the standard specifications). Here's a minimal case:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Your script name\nExec=path/for/your/script\nIcon=path/for/your/icon/can/be/svg\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\n\nand shove it in /usr/local/share/applications/your-script.xml or ~/.local/share/your-script.xml.\n\n*Finally run update-desktop-database .\n\nSince you are double clicking on the script, it's the job of your file manager to confirm this. It is not the job of the script to confirm whether it should run. Take this to the extreme. Can you imagine how ridiculous it would be that each time you called any program you had to confirm it?\nThe only time when a program should ask for confirmation is when it is about to do something possibly dangerous and irreversible. For example, overwriting a file or bypassing the trash. And note that even these examples are about making a program do something specific. They are not about starting such programs. If a program only purpose is to do such dangerous thing, then it shouldn't be asking confirmation either.\nIndeed, Nautilus (Gnome file manager) will already by default ask you to confirm if you want to execute a script (or just open it in a text editor).\n\nAnd of course, this behaviour is configurable, giving the user the possibility of turning it off (note entry on Executable Text Files).\n\nSo do not add an annoying confirmation dialog to your script. Configure your file manager correctly. And let your users do the same. \n\nA: You can use yad, which is like zenity on steroids as it is far more configurable. You can install it from the Software Centre in Ubuntu. In its most basic form, you can type\nyad --title=Question --image=dialog-question --text=\"Are you sure?\" \nand you should see this:\n\nIf OK was pressed we get a return code of 0, if Cancel was pressed we get a return code of 1.\nIt would be better to put the box in the centre and also adjust the width of it, use a leading tab to position the text \"Are you sure?\" more to the right and also have it always on top. For this we need:\nyad --center --on-top --title=Question --image=dialog-question --text=\"\\tAre you sure?\" --width 200\nMost of the switches are self explanatory except for the \"\\t\" before the \"Are you sure?\" which simply adds a tab space before printing the text. Now we should see this:\nThe box is centred, always on top and looks better. To set a variable to test for which button was pressed, use:\nyad --center --on-top --title=Question --image=dialog-question --text=\"\\tAre you sure?\" --width 200;result=$?;echo $result\nIn this example we are using the variable $result which will be set to 0 if OK was pressed or to 1 if Cancel was pressed.\nFor help with yad you can use man yad or yad --help-all but I found practical examples are easier to adapt. There are some here. yad is much more configurable and therefore more usable than zenity in my opinion.\n\nA: There is a way using zenity\nzenity --question --text \"Are you sure?\"\n\n\nYou can test the exit status of that command with $? variable, something like this: if [ $? -eq 1 ];then exit 1 ; fi . 0 is OK , 1 is cancel.\nThis construct will work well if you need to test exit status of the popup later, maybe store $? right after the popup exits to a variable. As discussed in the comments, structures like bellow will also work:\nif zenity --question --text \"Are you sure\" \nthen\n     runSumeFunction\nelse\n     exit 1\n fi\n\nor\n zenity --question --text \"Are you sure?\" || echo \"User isn't sure:/\"\n\n", "Q: Computer won't start, IO error, dropped to initramfs I was just starting my computer, I have version 2.02~beta2-9ubuntu1.4 and I keep getting this what should I do?   \n\n\nA: This is not a problem. This is the GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) menu screen. It's Ubuntu's default bootloader. Its function is to load and start the Linux kernel and some needed parts of the system.\nThis very useful when you have more than one operating system in your computer.\nIf it's not your case, you can hide this screen by running the following commands in an Ubuntu terminal:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\nFind the GRUB_TIMEOUT line and change its value from whatever it is to 0.

In the attached calc sheet (an image in fact, because I could not add a sheet), I have recorded some collected \"/proc/stat\" with a 2 seconds delay (yellow columns show the time of day and the exact time between two scans, blue columns show the coreresponding first line of \"/proc/stat\").\nIn the white columns I perform some computations.\nIn column Q I add all 10 cpu times and expect a result of 100%. This is not the case.\nWhere does the problem come from ?\nThanks for your help.\n\n\nA: So the best way to look at this is the cumulative stats for all the CPUs. I just ran the following:\ncat /proc/stat | grep \"cpu \"; sleep 1; cat /proc/stat | grep \"cpu \"\ncpu  72793 633 14979 2271004 2783 0 517 0 0 0\ncpu  72794 633 14980 2271403 2783 0 518 0 0 0\n\nThe change between the two sets of results is the number of USER_HZ consumed.  So, I get\nuser: 72794 - 72793 = 1\nnice:  633 - 633 = 0\nsystem: 14980 - 14979 = 1\nidle: 2271403 - 2271004 = 399\niowait: 2783 - 2783 = 0\nirq: 0 - 0 = 0\nsoftirq: 518 - 517 = 1\nsteal: 0 - 0 = 0\nguest: 0 - 0 = 0\nguest_nice: 0 - 0 = 0\nSo the total USER_HZ consumed is 1 + 0 + 1 + 399 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 402.  This is for a 4 thread machine, so that comes to ~100.5 USER_HZ per CPU, which is about right for some statistical sampling on a 100Hz jiffy clock. A longer sample period will lead to a closer result to the jiffy clock rate.\nYou can do the same for all the n CPUs in a system, cpu0.. CPUn-1.  Just compute the delta of the stats between each sample period, sum up the deltas and it will invariably be roughly equal to the number of CPUs x jiffy clock rate.\n", "Q: Apps on VNC and Local display: How to show running applications in all x sessions? (Xubuntu 14.04 x64) Ok, I usually don't ask questions, because by lurking around here for a couple hours I can find what I am looking for. This one has me stumped though, and I'm not entirely sure that what I want is possible easily.\nI have a setup where I would like to be able to log in locally and also with the same username over ssh + vnc and manipulate the same running programs over either session. Basically I want to act like I just sat down in front of the computer whether I did or not - I leave it logged in almost all the time.\nThe reason why I do not want to use x0vncserver is because my local display is 1920x1080 and I need to slam it down to 1366x768 or the VNC connection gets slow. I did not find a way to do that with vncserver without running it as a separate display. (I am using tigervncserver by the way)\nSo far the only option I can think of that I haven't tried yet would be to ALWAYS log in over VNC, and use a different local username. Perhaps I'll give that a go unless someone here can help me with a better answer. Does anyone know a way to do what I want?\n\nA: OK, this does not answer my question at all. However, it does fix the problem that I was trying to solve.\nI have edited /etc/pamd.d/sshd with the following at the end:\nsession optional pam_exec.so seteuid /home/root/ssh_sessions.sh\n\nssh_sessions.sh:\n\n!/bin/bash\nset -x\nif [    ${PAM_TYPE} ==  \"open_session\"  ]; then\n    xrandr -d :0 -s 1360x768\n    x0vncserver  passwordfile=/home/tyler/.vnc/passwd -NeverShared -display :0 &\nfi\nif [    ${PAM_TYPE} ==  \"close_session\" ]; then\n    killall x0vncserver\n    xrandr -d :0 -s 1920x1080\nfi\n\nWhat this does is change my local display resolution when ssh connects and runs vnc on the local display. Then when ssh disconnects it changes back to the regular resolution and kills the vnc connection.\n", "Q: How can I make my prompt show the current directory and the previous directory I edited the .bashrc file \nif [ \"$color_prompt\" = yes ]; then\n    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;36m\\]\\W:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\W \\[\\033[00m\\]\\$ '\n\n\nelse\n    PS1='[${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u:\\W \\$ ] '\nfi\n\nso my prompt looks like this user:Pictures:Pictures $ \nbut I want after my username to show my previous directory.\nI know that with the command basename $(dirname 'pwd') I can extract the previous directory.\nIs there any way I can use it so my prompt looks like this ?\nuser:prevDir:Pictures $\nthank you very much (and sorry if my English or terminology isn't very good I am new to Ubuntu)\n\nA: Replace the first \\W with ${OLDPWD/\\/home\\/$USER/\\~}:\nPS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;36m\\]${OLDPWD/\\/home\\/$USER/\\~}:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\W \\[\\033[00m\\]\\$ '\n\n~$ cd tmp\n~/tmp$ PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;36m\\]${OLDPWD/\\/home\\/user/\\~}:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\W \\[\\033[00m\\]\\$ '\nuser:~:tmp $ \n\n${OLDPWD/\\/home\\/$USER/\\~} is a parameter expansion which replaces a potential expansion of /home/$USER at the start of $OLDPWD with ~, in order to print ~ instead of the user's home directory's full path (miming the behavior of the default prompt).\nIf that's undesired, replace \\W with just $OLDPWD:\nPS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;36m\\]$OLDPWD:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\W \\[\\033[00m\\]\\$ '\n\n~$ cd tmp\n~/tmp$ PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;36m\\]$OLDPWD:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\W \\[\\033[00m\\]\\$ '\nuser:/home/user:tmp $ \n\n", "Q: How to remove Ubuntu?

Hope these will be helpful.\n\nA: Just want to add to the manual method of @SauravKumar. Fixing the path in the activate script is necessary, but not sufficient. You also need to fix the path in other scripts like pip, pip2, etc.\nThe easiest thing to do is search for your path inside the virtual environment bin folder like:\nroot@www:/var/www/app/venv/bin# grep \"/tmp/app/HadithHouseWebsite/venv\" * -R\nactivate:VIRTUAL_ENV=\"/tmp/app/HadithHouseWebsite/venv\"\nactivate.csh:setenv VIRTUAL_ENV \"/tmp/app/HadithHouseWebsite/venv\"\nactivate.fish:set -gx VIRTUAL_ENV \"/tmp/app/HadithHouseWebsite/venv\"\ndjango-admin:#!/tmp/app/HadithHouseWebsite/venv/bin/python2.7\ndjango-admin.py:#!/tmp/app/HadithHouseWebsite/venv/bin/python2.7\neasy_install:#!/tmp/app/HadithHouseWebsite/venv/bin/python2.7\neasy_install-2.7:#!/tmp/app/HadithHouseWebsite/venv/bin/python2.7\npbr:#!/tmp/app/HadithHouseWebsite/venv/bin/python2.7\npip:#!/tmp/app/HadithHouseWebsite/venv/bin/python2.7\npip2:#!/tmp/app/HadithHouseWebsite/venv/bin/python2.7\npip2.7:#!/tmp/app/HadithHouseWebsite/venv/bin/python2.7\npython-config:#!/tmp/app/HadithHouseWebsite/venv/bin/python\nsqlformat:#!/tmp/app/HadithHouseWebsite/venv/bin/python2.7\nwheel:#!/tmp/app/HadithHouseWebsite/venv/bin/python2.7\n\nThen go through these files and change the ones you need. Mostly you need to change the activate* files and pip* files.\nHope this helps.\n\nA: First way to create a copy of existing virtualenv, say ProjectAenv:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the ProjectAenv to some other name or directory:\ncp -R /home/sk/Path1/ProjectAenv /home/sk/Path2/ProjectBenv\n\nwhere /home/sk/Path1/ProjectAenv is the absolute path of the virtualenv ProjectAenv\n\n*Then open the activate file of newly copied ProjectBenv using your preferred editor:\ngedit /home/sk/Path2/ProjectBenv/bin/activate\n\n\n*Find the line VIRTUAL_ENV=\"/home/sk/Path1/ProjectAenv\" and replace it with:\nVIRTUAL_ENV=\"/home/sk/Path2/ProjectBenv\"\n\nSave and close the file.\nThats it!! Your new environment ProjectBenv is copied from ProjectAenv and ready to use. I'm using this way for a long time and never got any issues yet, although I recommend the 2nd way of copying.\nSecond way to create a copy of existing virtualenv(Recommended):\n\n\n*\n\n*Download virtualenv-clone:\nwget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/v/virtualenv-clone/virtualenv-clone-0.2.6.tar.gz\ntar -zxvf virtualenv-clone-0.2.6.tar.gz\ncd virtualenv-clone-0.2.6\n\n\n*Install virtualenv-clone inside any virtualenv environment:\nvirtualenv newenv            # create a new environment. You can use any existing one.\nsource newenv/bin/activate   # login to newenv\n(newenv): python setup.py install  # install virtualenv-clone in newenv\n# be sure that you are inside the directory \"virtualenv-clone-0.2.6\"\n\nvirtualenv-clone will be installed inside newenv.\n\n*Now while logged-in as newenv we can create a copy of any existing environment. For example creating the copy of ProjectAenv:\n(newenv): virtualenv-clone ProjectAenv ProjectBenv \n(newenv): deactivate             # to come out from newenv.\n\nPlease comment for any suggestions or changes.\n", "Q: How to install libsystemd-journal-dev on Wily (JHBuild issue) I'm trying to build gnome apps using JHBuild.

If you have another idea I'd love to know about it.\nUpdate: I have updated Jacob's script to work for two screens if they are connected.\n\nA: The script below is to toggle rotation of either one of your screens:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\n\n# --- set the name of the screen and the rotate direction below\nscreen = \"VGA-1\"\nrotate = \"left\"\n# ---\n\nmatchline = [\n    l.split() for l in subprocess.check_output([\"xrandr\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()\\\n    if l.startswith(screen)\n    ][0]\ns = matchline[\n    matchline.index([s for s in matchline if s.count(\"+\") == 2][0])+1\n    ]\n\nrotate = \"normal\" if s == rotate else rotate\nsubprocess.call([\"xrandr\", \"--output\", screen, \"--rotate\", rotate])\n\nHow to use\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as toggle-rotate.py\n\n*In the head section of the script, set:\n\n\n*\n\n*the name of the screen you'd like to toggle (find out by running in a terminal the command xrandr)\n\n*the rotate direction, either left or right (between quotes, like in the example).\n# --- set the name of the screen and the rotate direction below\nscreen = \"VGA-1\"\nrotate = \"left\"\n# ---\n\n\n\n*Test- run it by the command (two times, from a terminal):\npython3 /path/to/toggle-rotate.py\n\n\n*If all works fine, add it to a shortcut key. Choose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\npython3 /path/to/toggle-rotate.py\n\nto a shortcut of your choice...\nThat's it.\nExplanation\nIn the output of the command xrandr, the current rotation of your screen (if any) is mentioned directly after the screen's position, for example:\nVGA-1 connected 1024x1280+1680+0 left (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 376mm x 301mm\n\nIn the example, we see: 1024x1280+1680+0 left. The script looks into the line, corresponding to the screen, mentioned in the head of the script. if the screen is rotated, the script runs the (xrandr) command: \nxrandr --output <screen_name> --rotate normal\n\nif not, it runs (for example):\nxrandr --output <screen_name> --rotate left\n\nTo rotate the screen counter-clockwise\n\nA: I have been using Jacob's script.

I went into it (/.localshare/steam I think?) and wasnt able to find my username in there and therefore couldn't find my game files.  Could anyone give some advice on this please?\n\nA: There are two ways to do this.\nYou are correct in the path, you are just not deep enough the path would be\n.local/share/steam/steamapps/common/{name of your game}\nAnother way to do it would be to right click on the game name in the list or detailed(not tiled) view of Steams Library page the click on  Properties  On the window that pops up click on the Local Files tab then click on Browse local files option.  This will open the game files directly rather than drilling down with the file manager.\nFrom the game files folder you will need to figure out what files you need to delete yourself, it varies from game to game. \nIf you find that after deleting the files the game does not work properly, you can easily fix this by opening the Properties box again and on the local files tab just click on Verify the Integrity of Game Cache.  This will check the folder and redownload any missing  files.\nYou may have to delete the maps every time the game updates, Steam may reinstall them when updating.\n\nA: Steam folders are hidden in your Home directory.

It is relatively new.  It is up to date on its patches.  I'm running postfix on it and I noticed that the SMTP server was having trouble resolving delivery.mailspamprotection.com (siteground's outgoing mail server.).\nWhen I use dig I get all of the addresses (about 30 of them). I have a small C program that uses libc6's getaddrinfo() function.  That returns only one address.  I am running my own recursing nameserver (pdns-recursor) which seems to be running fine.

I am computer-illiterate. I think Thunderbird is installed, but not sure.  How do I see if it is installed?  How do I start it? Please, no involved technical explanations, just simple steps.\n\nA: Thunderbid comes preinstalled in Ubuntu. You can find/run it in two ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Graphical: Open the Dash (the top launcher in the left applications bar, with Ubuntu's symbol) and type Thunderbird. When it shows up, click it and Thunderbird will start.\n\n*Command line: Open a Terminal window and run thunderbird. It will then start. Note that when you do it through a terminal it keeps \"attached\" to the terminal window, so if you close it Thunderbird will be killed.\n\nA: To check if any program is installed, run this in a terminal:\napt-cache policy \"software-package-name\"\n\nOn my computer, the result is\nthunderbird:\nInstalled: 1:38.5.1+build2-0ubuntu0.15.10.1\nCandidate: 1:38.5.1+build2-0ubuntu0.15.10.1\n\nIf you prefer a GUI, you can look for a program in the Ubuntu Software Center, which will tell you if it is installed or not, and also if it needs to be updated.\n\nA: A few things have changed in operating systems since Windows Vista or earlier versions of Ubuntu and have become common among major operating systems.\nOpening the dash board or start menu with the Windows key Win let's you search for applications, files and other content, you should be able to find Thunderbird there.\nNew applications to install or manage software are more consumer oriented, some of them are called stores, in Ubuntu it's currently called Software Center.

As you know Ubuntu already has python in it. However, I have downloaded  the latest 3.5.1 version's source code and compiled it using\n./configure\nmake\nmake test\nsudo make install\n\nMy pwd at this moment is /home/SarpSTA/Downloads/Python-3.5.1\nI wanted to run purge on this new installation. \nsudo apt-get purge python wouldn't do since its path was running the old version not the new installation. So, while still was in the folder, I ran sudo apt-get purge ./python. It created a very long output that was like:\nE: Release 'python' for 'package-name' was not found\nfor every single package I have installed on my computer in place of package-name.\nDid I delete something or was the code simply a failure?\n\nA: No.  That command didn't do any damage.  It didn't do anything but give you the error message indicating that it couldn't perform the task.\nAs far as trying to purge the installed version, you don't have to purge it, just make a symbolic link to the installed version that you want for your default.  Of course you could also alternatively call python by the full pathname of the installed version.\nExample:\n$ /usr/bin/python3.7 myprogram.py\n\nThe proper command for uninstalling would be to give the package name as the remove parameter.\nExample for removing a package:\n$ sudo apt-get remove python\n\nYou can tell the current symbolic link on your system by running:\n$ ls -l /usr/bin/python*\n\nThe above command will also show you other versions that happen to be installed.\nOf course many programs use the shebang (#!) to specify the program interpreter to run.  You can see an example of this by running this command:\n$ egrep python * | egrep \"/usr/bin/python\"\n\nThe output of the above command will show you the name of various python applications with the specified version to run.  The program and command to run is separated a colon in the list.\n\nA: To understand what apt-get purge ./python tried to do, let's follow the manpage. First, the general syntax:\napt-get [-asqdyfmubV] [-o=config_string] [-c=config_file]\n        [-t=target_release] [-a=architecture] {update | upgrade |\n        dselect-upgrade | dist-upgrade |\n        install pkg [{=pkg_version_number | /target_release}]...  |\n        remove pkg...  | purge pkg...  |\n        source pkg [{=pkg_version_number | /target_release}]...  |\n\nYou'll see that apt-get supports specifying a target release via /foo. So, in ./python, apt-get interpreted python as a target release. We'll get back to this in a moment.\nNow, what about .? apt-get supports regular expressions, and if the package name contains ., *, etc., it will treat it as a regular expression. And apt-get checks for partial matches - as long as the given expression matches a part of a package name, that package is selected:\nIf no package matches the given expression and the expression\ncontains one of '.', '?' or '*' then it is assumed to be a POSIX\nregular expression, and it is applied to all package names in the\ndatabase. Any matches are then installed (or removed). Note that\nmatching is done by substring so 'lo.*' matches 'how-lo' and\n'lowest'. If this is undesired, anchor the regular expression with\na '^' or '$' character, or create a more specific regular\nexpression.\n\n. matches every character - so every package name will satisfy it. Therefore, apt-get will select every package it knows of. \nNow, back to the target release, it is used for specifying which repository you want to target for this operation, if the same package is provided by multiple repositories. See How to only install updates from a specific repository?\npython is not a valid release on default Ubuntu (and unlikely to be one anyway). So, even though apt-get picked every package it knew of, it couldn't find a matching release, and therefore, failed.\n\nA: That's not how it works. You can only use apt-get purge with packages installed by APT or dpkg (Debian .deb packages). If you compiled your software from source APT won't keep track of it.\nIf you still have your source code folder, cd into it and run sudo make uninstall. This command should delete the compiled software.\nIf you don't have the source anymore I recommend you to download it again, run ./configure inside it and then sudo make uninstall.\nBe very careful not to delete the default Python installation. It's a very important part of Ubuntu and you'll have a broken system if you delete it.\nSo no, you didn't do any damage by running sudo apt-get purge ./python, because the package couldn't be found.\n", "Q: Cannot boot after changing locale After I changed my locale and rebooted, now I get this error:\n[    1.863178] init: mountall main process (223) terminated with status 2\nFilesystem check or mount failed.\nA maintenance shell will now be started.\nCONTROL-D will terminate this shell and continue booting after re-trying\nfilesystems.

I have the Unity Tweak Tool installed and the fonts on their default settings (as they were before reformat). Could it be ttf-mscorefonts-installer? Because I'm not sure if that was installed on my last go-around.\nEdit: Sorry, completely forgot to mention, the web browser is Chromium in both cases.\n\nA: Font substitutions for your case are described in the file /etc/fonts/conf.avail/30-metric-aliases.conf. It looks complex at the first glance, but it is pretty logical.\nYour \"better\" font is Liberation Sans and it replaced Helvetica and Arial everywhere, until you installed ttf-mscorefonts-installer. Now Arial appeared in your system and it is more preferable than Liberation Sans, according to the substitution rules (they can be found in the \"Map generics to specifics\" section of the mentioned file).\nYou can override these rules with your personal rule file.

I've found something odd in my system monitor.

Is this something to be concerned about?\n\nA: No, this is not something to be concerned about. This is ssh-agent, not sshd, which is the SSH daemon. If you have a look at man ssh-agent:\n ssh-agent is a program to hold private keys used for public key\n authentication (RSA, DSA, ECDSA, ED25519).  The idea is that ssh-agent is\n started in the beginning of an X-session or a login session, and all\n other windows or programs are started as clients to the ssh-agent\n program.\n\nThe way it works is that when you use SSH to connect to somewhere (the command-line client ssh is installed by default, and other programs, like the file browser can also act as SSH clients), the connecting program will use the agent instead of loading the private key itself:\n The agent will never send a private key over its request channel.\n Instead, operations that require a private key will be performed by the\n agent, and the result will be returned to the requester.  This way,\n private keys are not exposed to clients using the agent.\n\nThe benefits are that you only need to unlock the private key once per session (the agent will then store it in memory), and clients never see your unencrypted private key directly.\nIt's the opposite of a backdoor, in a way.\n", "Q: How to remove an encrypted home directory Recently, I had to do an OS reinstall.

How do I remove the old encrypted home folder short of reformatting my /home partition?\nI am unable to log in as the old user as the OS reinstall has already occurred. The only way I can read the files is to use the recover-private option.\n\nA: All of the encrypted files are stored under /home/.ecryptfs.

Sometimes a packages update will contain a newer version, but, in general, the backport repository or a ppa would be used for more recent or higher versions of packages.\nSee:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports\nWhat to expect from an update is outlined here  - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuUpdates\nYou may of course elect to do security only updates - How can I install just security updates from the command line?\nIf you need a newer package that is not in the repos or a ppa you would have to search for a .deb / repository (check the project home page), build from source, or upgrade to a higher version of Ubuntu.\nGenerally speaking, server side, most people prefer long term releases (such as Ubuntu LTS, Centos, RHEL) for stability at the sacrifice of newer packages and newer feature.\nWith that general overview, what is it you are wanting ? security only updates ? A package not in the repositories ? Please update your question if this does not answer what you are asking.\n", "Q: Using Dosbox in Ubuntu I have installed Dosbox in Ubuntu 14.04.4 so that I can run a Dos database program. The instructions tell me to z:\\mount c: c:\\\"directory name\"\\  which produces an error telling me that the c:\\ drive does not exist.\nProblem is that I cannot find a drive named c.

The dos program that I want to run in Dosbox is located in the drive named OS.\n\nA: The tutorial you are following is for windows but you may follow that as there is not significant change in how dosbox works in Linux (except for path of the files which I have explained below).\nThere is no 'C:' drive or any other windows drives in Ubuntu. The root directory is '/' (like C: drive in windows). Normally your files are downloaded or saved to /home/user or /home/user/Desktop where user is the name you have given to your account.\nOpen the directory you want to mount using a file manager(like nautilus) and note down the path shown in the properties of the folder.\nNow in dosbox type \nmount c: <path>\n\nExample:\nmount C: /home/xyz/TC\n\nAdditional Info\nIf you want the directory to be mounted at dosbox startup.\n\n\n*\n\n*Goto your home folder (i.e. /home/user).\n\n*Open dosbox.conf (It should be there).\n\n*At the end of the file add these lines, save and close the file.\n\n[autoexec]\nmount C: <path>\n\n\nNote: Any command under [autoexec] will be executed at startup\nOptional\nYou can use '~' instead of '/home/user'\nExample:\nmount c ~/TC\n\n", "Q: Which NVidia proprietary driver for GT 745M (Ubuntu 14.04 - Toshiba laptop) I'd like to know which driver to use for my configuration (Toshiba laptop P50 A 14P + NVidia GT 745M/PCie/SSE2 - 14.04LT) to work. \nUp to now, I've tried all available ones (340.96, 340.96-updates, 352.63 and 352.63-updates) and all are freezing the screen after some random time (from never in a day to a few seconds...).

I installed a friends PC with a 12.04.3 install medium. I thought with 12.04 I had always long term support. But looking at kernel support (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack#Kernel.2BAC8-Support.A12.04.x_Ubuntu_Kernel_Support ) it seems I have a problem.\nQUESTION\nNow my problem is that I am stuck with 12.04.3's kernel being\nlinux-image-3.5.0-54-generic_3.5.0-54.81~precise1_amd64.deb 16-Jul-2014 18:15   39M\n\nwhich is from 2014 (not so great)\nHow can I get a updated kernel (i.e. a 3.2.xxx as in 12.04.1, or a 3.13.xxx in 12.04.5)?\nI tried apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade but that did not help get a supported kernel. Am I lost with a unsupported kernel?\n\nA: You can install kernel 3.13 by running\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-trusty\n\nNext time it is better to download and install the latest point release, like 12.04.5. You will not need to install lot's of updates and will have the latest major kernel for this LTS release.\n", "Q: UnrealIRCd 4.x.x on Ubuntu 15.10 Depending on installation and desired configuration, why do I get errors with everything from c-ares to pkg-config when trying to install unrealIRCd 4.x?

I want to know it because I want to move from 14.04 - 14.10 - 15.04 and finally to 15.10.\n\nA: Yes, you can - but I sincerely can't recommend you to do that.\nFirst of all, it would take a great amount of time to upgrade through all of those version. I could risk to say about 1 hour each.\nAlso many people suffer from bugs (mainly with configuration files and strange behaviors) when they upgrade from the Software Updater. This amount of upgrades could (and probably will) lead you to a few annoying bugs.\nSo I'll recommend you to do a fresh install. Go to http://www.ubuntu.com/download , grab the ISO from the version you want and replace your old Ubuntu version with the new one. Remember to backup all of your important files.\nDoing a fresh install will take you a lot less time and you'll avoid headaches.\nFinally, Wily Werewolf (15.10) is a regular release and will reach its end of life in July this year.

I have Ubuntu Wily Werewolf (15.10), and for pretty much all of the packages I get from ppa, there's not a wily subdirectory, so instead of installing it gives me a 404 error. Can I force apt-get update to download sources for previous versions of Ubuntu (I assume they'll still work)?\nI apologise if this question is dumb; I'm fairly new to Linux.\n\nA: If you added a PPA, it will have a file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d named after it, containing the source entry. For example, for the pi-rho/dev PPA on 14.04:\n$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pi-rho-dev-trusty.list\ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/pi-rho/dev/ubuntu trusty main\ndeb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/pi-rho/dev/ubuntu trusty main\n\nSimply locate the corresponding file for your PPA, and edit it to replace wily with trusty or whichever version you want.\nWhether this will work without causing problems, there's no telling.\n\nA: You can make a given PPA download files for an older release by modifying its list file under /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ to use the release name you want to download from (eg: replace instances of the word \"wily\" with \"trusty\" to make your system use the Ubuntu 14.04 packages on your 15.10 system) but this is not a guarantee that the installed app from that repository from that release will work on the release of Ubuntu you are using, either properly or at all.

It's the adapter you use with it that will determine if it's compatible in your region. If you buy a Ubuntu phone or smart phone in Europe it will come with the plugs designed for the voltage in that region. If you buy a Ubuntu phone or smart phone from a vender from the United States it will come with the adapters required to charge the phone. \nThe phone doesn't care what country you charge it in. Just as long as it's getting power in was designed to receive. \nSometimes smart phones will come with multiple plug adapters for people that travel around the world. \n\nA: Voltage in Europe might be different than that of USA.

What is the format of the /etc/apt/sources.list file for Ubuntu?\nAs an example of the kind of information I am looking for, here is an explanation for Debian sources.list. However, the various sections, such as Distribution and Component, reference Debian releases; I am looking for Ubuntu specific information.\n\nA: To more specifically answer the question about the format of sources.list, I suggest man 5 sources.list, which you can also view on the web as sources.list(5) [alt link], which is more detailed than Debian's SourcesList wiki article.\nMy specific inquiry related to how to specify multiple options, which is covered by sources.list(5) § The deb and deb-src types: options, which says they should be space-delimited, e.g.\ndeb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/some-repo.gpg] http://some.repo/apt dev main\n\nThis becomes more relevant with the recent apt-key deprecation that suggests using signed-by for all third-party repositories. This is coming soon: \"apt-key(8) will last be available in Debian 11 [released 2021.08] and Ubuntu 22.04.\"\n(The only Ubuntu-specific part should be the release and component names, which you can learn from the prior answer to this question.)\n\nA: The format is exactly the same for Ubuntu.\nYou can get the Ubuntu distribution release names here. In sources.list use only the lowercased adjective part (precise, trusty, wily, etc.).

When I drag and drop the file it keeps jumping back to the downloads folder.\n\nA: Maybe you don't have permissions to write on the external drive or it is a file system which cannot be read.\nTo find out if that's the problem, open a terminal and type\nlsblk\n\nFollowed by \"enter\". You will get something like the following output: \nList of block devices\nThe size column will probably tell you which device is your flash drive (my usb stick in the picture has 15 GB for example). In the name column, sdx always means the whole device, sdx1 would be the first partition of the device. What you need to write down is the mountpoint of the partition (probably the first and only partition) of your flash drive, it will be something like /media/user/foo - in my screenshot you can see my usb stick mounted at sdc1 with mountpoint /media/.... If no mountpoint is specified, the flash drive is not mounted. In Ubuntu automounting is activated I think by default, so removing the drive and connecting it again should do the trick. Otherwise you need to manually mount it.\nNow change to your mountpoint with entering \ncd /media/user/foo\n\n(user being the name of your login user), now you should be seeing all your folders which already exist on your flash drive when typing\nls -al\n\nHere, the leftmost column tells you about the file permissions, it is something like \n`drwxrwxrwx` or `-r-x------`\n\nd means that this file is a directory, the first rwx are the users permissions, second rwx the group's permissions, third rwx the permissions of everybody else. r =  read, w = write, x = execute. If there is a dash (-) instead of the letter itself, a certain permission is not granted.\nThe third and fourth column tells you the user and group the files belong to. This should be your login user & its default group. If this is not the case and the permissions on the files are restricting others from writing (no w at the third triple), then you have your problem. \nNow you have several possibilities to fix that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy files with sudo: \nsudo cp /home/user/Downloads/filename /media/user/foo/\nthis will give you temporarily root permissions to allow you copying the files. If you want to copy whole directories, you need to copy them recursively with \nsudo cp -R /home/user/Downloads/directory /media/user/foo/\nWhen prompted for a password, enter your user's login password. \n\n*Change the owner & group of your files: you need to go one level higher in the file system with \ncd ..\nThen use the following commands to change user and group of the mountpoint itself:\nsudo chown -R user /media/user/foo\nsudo chgrp -R group /media/user/foo\n-R means recursive, which will modify the user and group of each and every file and directory inside the mountpoint and the mountpoint itself. Your default group has the same name as the user in a default installation of ubuntu, verify that by entering groups in the terminal, the first entry is your default group. Actually, you only need the first line to make it work, the second one with the group is optional.\n\n*If nobody is allowed to write to the flashdrive (no w in any of the three sections) you need to adjust the permissions of the files with the command \nsudo chmod u+w filename\nu+w will give user (u) write access (+w) to the file, which you can specify with the relative path name (the path relative to the current directory) or the absolute pathname from the root directory, which will be something like /media/user/foo/filename\nIf this is not helping, it might be a filesystem issue. You can use gparted to check the type of file system of the flashdrive. Type \n`sudo gparted`\n\nand select your device (you know the name from lsblk, it's something like \"/dev/sdx\"). Be careful with this tool because it can wipe whole disks! The column \"filesystem\" will be something like ntfs, ext4, fat, ... Please post your filesystem type here that we can help you further.\nIf you have any questions regarding the whole procedure, don't hesitate to ask :)\n\nA: Alternate way of doing the same\nFirst create a directory to mount usb\nsudo mkdir /media/external\n\nand then\nsudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/external -o uid=1000,gid=1000,utf8,dmask=027,fmask=137\n\nFor more info, refer to this\nand then try copy operation\ncp -r $HOME/Downloads/* /media/external\n\n", "Q: Usage share of various Ubuntu releases - 12.04 nowhere used anymore? Are there available any usage share statistics across all Ubuntu releases? \nI'm asking in regards to Google Chrome no more providing updates for Ubuntu 12.04 starting in early March 2016. According to comment #5 in Chromium Issue 580892, usage of Ubuntu 12.04 is extremely low:\n\nYes, it is unfortunate to drop support earlier than the distro \n  release's EOL.

It is, however, turned on by default on Ubuntu (after all, they make heavy use of sudo), RHEL, Fedora Core (since version 12), and openSUSE\n\nI can not find any reference to the claim Ubuntu supports this. Nor any other system using \"sudo\". If Debian does not support it I seriously doubt Ubuntu does. Our system tends to stick to Debian and if we ever deviate from Debian in the long run we always tend to stray back to how Debian does it.\nOh and the man page your link claims has \"-f\" listed does not list \"-f\". It it existed in 2011 it does no longer.\nThe link also claims you can get it working by recompiling \"sudo\". But still I would assume that the \"sudo\" website would list it as a compile option and I have not seen it.\n", "Q: Symlink does not work for dropbox I am backing up home folder by create a symlink in dropbox.\nWhat I did:\ncd ~/Dropbox\nmkdir backup && cd backup\nln -s ~\n\nWhat I checked:\n\n\n*\n\n*ln -l.

For the most part, they are too cheap to spend too much time trying to diagnose or troubleshoot the problem.  The behaviour you've described (especially, computer won't boot or enter BIOS menu when it's plugged in) imply it's a hardware fault that you can't fix.\nIf you had important data on there that you can't recover, you are probably out of luck.  But since you don't care about the data, you can breathe a sigh of relief.\nAs for the cause: removing it from a USB port without shutting down the OS will not be the cause.  USB devices are electrically designed to be able to be removed from a running system.

There is maximum of 4 partitions on a single harddrive, i need 2 extra ofcourse swap and root. does anyone have suggestions ?\ni have 2 recovery partitions and one efi partition. which brings me to problem 2: UEFI, information is kind of all over the place concerning this problem, some say that with the newer versions of ubuntu it is no longer a problem. others follow a long list of actions like disabling fastboot,secureboot,switching to legacy boot methods etc.\nSo what is the current status of ubuntu/grub installation regarding UEFI ?\nAnd then there is skylake. Originally not supported in kernel 4.2 , yet some newer articles claim support out of the box with 15.10. Does anyone know the truth of the matter ?\nThere are also alot of questions on nvidia cards. Some people experience black screens after installing the drivers. I would like to install the proprietary drivers (gotta go fast).

What are your experiences with nvidia driver issues installing/using ubuntu\nSorry for the amount of questions. Any and all advice is welcome.\nGreetings\n\nA: \nThe first is that hp decided that they need 4 partitions for a windows installation :( . just why ?! . There is maximum of 4 partitions on a single harddrive\n\nThe 4-partition limit is a problem with the old Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme. Almost anything that ships with Windows 8 or later uses the newer GUID Partition Table (GPT) instead. GPT's limit is 128 partitions by default, and that limit can be raised if necessary. Thus, the fact that HP used four partitions on its default Windows 10 installation on a new computer is unimportant.\n\nUEFI, information is kind of all over the place concerning this problem\n\nEFI is not a problem, although it is a significant change from the earlier BIOS. You're right, though, that there's a lot of conflicting information on the subject. FWIW, I'm the author of the GPT fdisk (gdisk) partitioning software and maintainer of the rEFInd boot manager, so I know a thing or two about this subject. Here's my recommended reading list:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adam Williamson's blog entry on how EFI works -- This page describes the theory behind EFI-mode booting.\n\n*A question and answers on the differences between BIOS and EFI booting on Superuser.com -- This provides the basics of the preceding, but is more concise.\n\n*My page on installing Linux on EFI systems -- This page is a more practical introduction to EFI-mode booting than Adam Williamson's blog.\n\n*My page on the CSM -- This page covers the CSM, including when it's useful and when it's not.\n\n*The Ubuntu community wiki entry on UEFI -- This page is a bit disjointed, but is the most Ubuntu-specific introduction to EFI and its issues.\n\n\nI admit that's a lot. If you don't want to read them all, I recommend you read my EFI installation page (#3 on that list) first, then move on to Adam Williamson's blog and/or the Superuser.com question and answer.\nSigns that an author doesn't know what s/he is talking about include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Recommendations to enable the CSM/legacy support, except in limited circumstances. See my page on the subject (referenced above) for more on this subject.\n\n*Claims that Ubuntu doesn't support Secure Boot. It does. (A case can be made for disabling it, especially temporarily or in certain situations, though.)\n\n*A routine use of Boot Repair. This tool is meant to fix boot loader problems, but a working installation procedure should not create such problems, so use of Boot Repair should be limited to cases where something went wrong.\n\n\nTo be sure, it's sometimes necessary to use CSM/legacy support, to disable Secure Boot, or to use Boot Repair. These cases generally indicate a problem with a computer's firmware, though, and they are not common enough problems that people should be doing them routinely.\nSince I've mentioned firmware problems, be aware that many vendors are known to deliver broken EFIs that forget or ignore their NVRAM boot manager entries. These entries are critical for normal booting. If you can install Ubuntu but the computer then boots straight to Windows, you may have such a computer. If this happens, and if you can't easily resolve the problem, return the computer for a refund! EFI has been the dominant firmware type for long enough that such problems should no longer exist in new products, and consumers accepting such defects qualifies as self-abuse.\n\nothers follow a long list of actions like disabling fastboot,secureboot,switching to legacy boot methods etc.\n\nThe Windows Fast Startup setting is a problem. See here for information on disabling it. You may also need to disable the Windows Hibernation feature, as described here. These are Windows features that make dual-booting unsafe because they leave filesystems in an unsafe state when Ubuntu takes over. They really have nothing to do with EFI. Note also that many EFIs include a feature called \"fast start\" or something similar. This feature can make it difficult to boot from an external medium, but don't pose the sort of threat that the Windows Fast Startup feature poses. Don't confuse the EFI and Windows features; despite having similar names, they're completely unrelated.\nThere are two other issues that often get short shrift:\n\n\n*\n\n*Bit depth -- Most EFIs are 64-bit, and with them, you should install a 64-bit Ubuntu. Installing a 32-bit Ubuntu on a system with a 64-bit EFI will require jumping through extra hoops and will likely create maintenance headaches down the road. If you've got a rare system (mostly tablets and netbooks) with a 32-bit EFI, it's theoretically better to install a 32-bit Ubuntu; but the last I checked, Ubuntu's 32-bit installation images lack EFI boot loaders, so you've got to jump through hoops to get those installed.\n\n*Installation medium preparation -- Multiple tools (Unetbootin, Rufus, dd, etc.) exist to create bootable USB drives from Ubuntu .iso images. Some of these tools work better than others for creating an EFI-bootable image. Some (especially Rufus) offer options that can affect the results. What works best varies from one computer to another. If you can't get the installer to boot, DO NOT immediately enable BIOS/CSM/legacy support; at best, that will work around the immediate boot problem but create worse problems down the road. Instead, try re-creating the boot medium in another way or using another tool.\n\n\nI don't currently have anything to say about Skylake or Nvidia hardware.\n\nA: I'm actually running a a number of Skylake processors here, so I can confirm some fears and allay others.\nSkylake support improved dramatically from 4.2.0-17 in about October 2015.  Previously, I had to run in legacy mode because even in generic Ubuntu, things would suddenly freeze or crash, and sound was patchy.  I played with a number of kernels and settled on a 4.1 kernel in legacy mode.  It worked well for months while I tested out various 4.2.0 kernels that were in RC.\nNow, everything works pretty much out-of-the-box if you install from an up-to-date version of 15.10.  \nSo, I wiped them in November and did a UEFI install but still disabled secure boot.\nWhy?  Because secure boot needs you to install keys into your BIOS and (AFAIK) those keys have to match the kernel that you're booting.  So, technically, there's a potential that you could get a pretty normal kernel upgrade, run apt-get autoremove which could theoretically uninstall the old kernel (that being the one you're running) and then get locked out of your machine on the next reboot. Ech.\n@rod-smith has pointed out in the comments that Secure Boot now works due to a Microsoft to Canonical key shim arrangement, but I can't speak for this yet.\nIf you're careful, it works.  And I'm sure there's a workaround that might involve booting from a USB key or pulling out the hard drive, but I digress...it's just something I'm not (yet) comfortable with.\nUEFI, on the other hand, does work.  I find it's a little touch-and-go with suspend (but then, suspend is hard!)  The thing you have to remember is that the EFI partition is the most important thing.  Don't touch it, don't move it, don't update it, and everything will be fine (so long as it's mounted at /boot/efi).  Don't forget if you're rolling-your-own kernel or doing something else like that, don't forget to tell grub that it needs the efi module.\nOne of the other people here who uses a Skylake likes to mod Ubuntu to within an inch of it's life, running Xubuntu with a whole bunch of streamlining.  However, while I get through the day now with next to no hassle, he finds he has audio issues, graphical glitches, and completely unexplained complete video lockups.  (Everything is still running since we can ssh in and look around, but for some reason the screen is completely frozen.)\nSo, you probably do this already, but I tend boot from a USB key first to dd the whole disk over the network running through gzip.  That way, I have the whole machine stored exactly as it came out of the box, and it's usually only 16-32GB after compression.\nThen, my suggestion is to disable secure boot and go for a normal UEFI install.  Let it shrink the Windows partitions if you like, but don't touch the EFI partition.  You can delete the Windows rescue partition (presuming you backed it up), because it most likely won't work once you move partitions around, anyway.\nI found, even on later models, some switches are still only accessible via alsamixer.  If you find you have no sound, go looking for the strange muted channels that alsa shows you but pulseaudio doesn't.\nFinally, if your boot isn't set up the right way (or windows overwrites it), you may have to use your USB key/SD card to chroot into your root partition, mount /boot and /boot/efi and reinstall grub.\nHave fun! :-D\n", "Q: how to get a just partly appearing WWAN-dongle to work correct/permanent? i have got a notebook (HP EliteBook 8460p) with an built in HP hs2340 HSPA+ Mobile Broadband Module (Ericsson F5521gw - the label i found on the WWAN hardware dongle)...\nfrom the first days on the broadband module was not really working, but i didn't need it so it did not matter... from time to time (but very rare) the unchecked option \"Mobile Broadband\" appeared in the (network-manager-)panel.\ni am using ubuntu precise with an 3.2 kernel, and now i updated to an lts-trusty 3.13 kernel with no changes (at this subject).\n\nthis question and answers seems to be related, but it didn't work.\nthe only things i found and may be related to my broadband module are the lines in /lib/udev/rules.d/77-mm-ericsson-mbm.rules:\n# HP hs2340 Mobile Broadband Module\nATTRS{idVendor}==\"03f0\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"3a1d\", ENV{ID_MM_ERICSSON_MBM}=\"1\"\n\nby the way: also lsusb don't lists the WWAN-dongle...\n\nUPDATE:\ntoday the module was working without any problem, so i ran some commands to gather as much information as possible... don't know if it helps...\nuser@EliteBook_8460p ~ $ LC_ALL=C lsusb\nBus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp.

delete the question (although it may be a little bit embarrassing), because i searched half the the web and didn't find an answer or just a hint to the right direction!\n\nYesterday i hit the topic again, first the mobile broadband was working and after a short time no more... and some time later i noticed, it was working again after i inserted the battery in its bay! - and that was it!!!\nwith the battery in the bay the WWAN-dongle works like a charm, and without not.\nso i finally called the HP support and asked what's the mater with the battery and the fickle WWAN-dongle (to sort out if it is a loose connection)!\nthey answered, it is by design that the (original) battery has to be in its bay to establish a connection to the WWAN-dongle, also if the battery is broken because of a short circuit!\ni can't believe that this is really necessary, because the SIM-card is placed in a nice push-push slot (behind the battery) and the donge/antenna itself is placed at the other side of the notebook.\nand additionally i'm a little bit disappointed because an all time inserted battery reduces it's lifetime...! :-/\nTL;DR:\nit is a hardware related \"connection\"-thing... insert the battery (and leave it in the bay) and that's it.\nhas somebody experience with this sort of WWAN-dongle-connections...? - is there maybe a way to get it working without having the battery energized all the time?\n", "Q: Is there an OEM version of Ubuntu 15.10 I seem to recall that Ubuntu 15.10 has an OEM Install option.  Is this the case?\n\nA: When booting to Live CD of Ubuntu 15.10, and the stickman image next to the equal sign and the keyboard on the bottom of the screen, Just press any key, to bypass auto-boot and go to menu, Select the lauguage and then press F4, it will list you modes, (Normal, OEM Install for manufacturers), Arrow-down key to OEM Install, and press Enter, then down-arrow key until \"Install Ubuntu\" is highlighted, Press Enter to start the installation.\n", "Q: Fstab - Try rw first, then fall back to ro How can I make an fstab entry to try to first mount as read-write, and if it that fails, as read-only?\n\nA: You have to set options to errors=remount-ro your entry will look like:\n<device>  <mount point> <fs type> errors=remount-ro <dump> <pass>\n\n", "Q: Sort file/folder output in Bash I have output like this (alphanumerical):\nbash /etc/file\nbash /etc/filenew\nbash /etc/skel/\nbash /etc/skel/file\nbash /etc/skel/filenew\nbash /etc/skel/new/backups/\nbash /etc/skel/new/file\nbash /etc/skel/old/backups/\nbash /etc/skel/old/file\nbash /usr/\nbash /usr/bin/\nbash /usr/bin/file\nbash /usr/sbin/\nbash /usr/sbin/file.sbin\n\nWhich I need to sort (the output itself) to show directories first, as per:\nbash /etc/skel/\nbash /etc/skel/new/backups/\nbash /etc/skel/new/file\nbash /etc/skel/old/backups/\nbash /etc/skel/old/file\nbash /etc/skel/file\nbash /etc/skel/filenew\nbash /etc/file\nbash /etc/filenew\nbash /usr/\nbash /usr/bin/\nbash /usr/bin/file\nbash /usr/sbin/\nbash /usr/sbin/file.sbin\n\n\nA: I think the following command comes close:\nsed -r 's:([^/]*/):d\\1:g; s:([^/]+)$:f\\1:' foo.txt |\n  sort |\n  sed -r 's:/f:/:; s:d([^/]*/):\\1:g'\n\nWhat does it do? The first sed command adds a d to the beginning of every directory (by looking for strings that end with a /), and an f to files - those that don't end with /. Then we apply sort - and since d sorts before f, directories get sorted first. The second sed undoes the first one.\nFor the example input:\n$ sed -r 's:([^/]*/):d\\1:g; s:([^/]+)$:f\\1:' foo.txt |\n sort |\n sed -r 's:/f:/:; s:d([^/]*/):\\1:g'\nbash /etc/skel/\nbash /etc/skel/new/backups/\nbash /etc/skel/new/file\nbash /etc/skel/old/backups/\nbash /etc/skel/old/file\nbash /etc/skel/file\nbash /etc/skel/filenew\nbash /etc/file\nbash /etc/filenew\nbash /usr/\nbash /usr/bin/\nbash /usr/bin/file\nbash /usr/sbin/\nbash /usr/sbin/file.sbin\n\n", "Q: LTS Enablement Stack on Trusty has unmet depencies I have Ubuntu 14.04 (kernel 3.19.0-49) and I would like to install the latest LTS Enablement Stack to access kernel 4+.\nAccording to the wiki, I need to do\n$ sudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-generic-lts-wily xserver-xorg-core-lts-wily xserver-xorg-lts-wily xserver-xorg-video-all-lts-wily xserver-xorg-input-all-lts-wily libwayland-egl1-mesa-lts-wily \n\n\nReading package lists...

Other than that, try a LIveCD of gParted. Move the other 2 partitions down and create the new one at the end of the drive.\nWindows is quite foolproof with it's partitions but it's suggesting you've got 4 primary partitions so won't allow more; and probably insists on it being after all primary partitions, so using gParted will allow you to create a 5th as an extended volume.\nIf you're using GRUB to dual-boot it should still boot afterwards as partitions should still have the same numbering/UUID.\n", "Q: how to install update by CVE number In Redhat and Suse i can run below command in order to install a specific CVE.\nfor example:\nyum update --cve CVE-2015-7547\n\nzypper patch --cve=CVE-2015-7547\n\nin this also possible in Ubuntu?\nHow can i install a specific CVE by its number?\n\nA: apt-get does not support this (nor does any frontend of dpkg that I know of, including aptitude and Synaptic).

I tried live booting from a usb, and reinstalling, which did not work either (just a black screen after choosing those options).\nMy last try was using boot-repair  disk, which booted and repaired, but rebooting my computer I still end up at the same GRUB screen (so the problem was not repaired). I would be very thankful for any further advice!\n\nA: My initial guess seems to be correct. Your partition table suggests that Ubuntu is installed to /dev/sda6; that's the only Linux data partition:\nPartition    Start Sector    End Sector  # of Sectors System\n/dev/sda1           2,048     2,050,047     2,048,000 Windows Recovery Environment (Windows)\n/dev/sda2       2,050,048     2,582,527       532,480 EFI System partition\n/dev/sda3       2,582,528     2,844,671       262,144 Microsoft Reserved Partition (Windows)\n/dev/sda4       2,844,672   699,840,511   696,995,840 Data partition (Windows/Linux)\n/dev/sda5     945,602,560   976,773,119    31,170,560 Windows Recovery Environment (Windows)\n/dev/sda6     699,840,512   924,450,815   224,610,304 Data partition (Linux)\n/dev/sda7     924,450,816   940,075,007    15,624,192 Swap partition (Linux)\n\nUnfortunately, Boot Repair can't figure out what filesystem /dev/sda6 contains:\nsda6: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       \n    Boot sector type:  Unknown\n    Boot sector info: \n    Mounting failed:   mount: unknown filesystem type ''\nmount: unknown filesystem type ''\n\nThis is Very Bad. It's possible that running fsck on /dev/sda6 will fix the problem; however, that could make matters worse, too. As a safety measure, you might want to do a low-level backup of it before you do anything else, as in:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda6 of=/path/to/lots/of/space/sda6.img\n\nThat way, if you try a repair and it doesn't work, you'll at least be able to restore the backup. Note that you must have a disk with lots of free space on it, and you'd point the of= option to store the backup in a file there. By \"lots of free space,\" I mean at least as much space as the partition you're backing up, or 107.11 GiB.\n", "Q: Dell XPS 13 compatibility and some other questions I am using a Dell XPS 13 9343.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this laptop compatible?\n\n*Have you found any problems while using it?\n\n*Once regular Ubuntu is installed, can I then install Ubuntu Mate or something onto it without losing my files and apps?\nThanks.\n\nA: I have a Dell XPS 9343 (your exact same model). Purchased it with Windows, and I installed Ubuntu later. Ubuntu 15.10 works flawlessly, I am using it 12 hours a day for work and personal use.\nOnly complaint is the wireless card, which is generally quite poor. But it works better in Ubuntu than it does on Windows!\nI am using Kubuntu, but any other Ubuntu flavor will probably work as well.\nOnly suggestion: do NOT go with Ubuntu 14.04, take 15.10.\n\nA: I have installed Ubuntu on many laptops (more than five, maybe more like ten), and I have yet to see a laptop with any compatibility issues. \nThat said, there are guides for your specific model on the internet (here and here). Dell sells a \"Developer Edition\" of the XPS 13 9343, and so it would seem that Ubuntu would work perfectly out of the box. However, the version of Ubuntu that these laptops are running has been tweaked a bit for hardware support. Using the above guide (try the first one, it is more relevant), you can install all the drivers that Dell installs.\nAlso check the official Ubuntu compatibility page for this model: http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/hardware/201410-15913/\nAs for your last question, Ubuntu MATE is a child-OS of Ubuntu. It is virtually the same as getting the normal Ubuntu version and installing the MATE desktop environment (DE) (see this question). In your case, you would do the latter.\n", "Q: Switching terminals with `Ctrl`+ `Alt`+`Fn` does not require password Users on my computer have all password requesting options enabled, i.e. password is required on waking from suspend, and on returning from blank screen. The screen turns off after  few minutes of inactivity and then gets locked.\nWe want privacy for everybody.\nHowever, it turned out that one can unlock users without entering a password! I found a few scenarios how it can happen (but does not always happen):\n\n\n*\n\n*User A clicks the 'Lock / Switch Account`,\nor moves away from the computer for a time sufficient to lock the screen.\n\n*Either black screen or greeting with request for a password appears.\n(Black screen when switching users is a known problem, see: here and  here. To get out of a black screen, we press Ctrl+ Alt+Fn.)\nNow one would assume that terminal of user A is locked.\n\n*Somebody press Ctrl+ Alt+Fn, where Fn corresponds to user A.\n\n*Console of user A opens. Sometimes it is his greeting with request for a password, but quite often it is just his console without request for a password!\n\n\nAnother possibility:  \n\n\n*\n\n*User A at his console presses Ctrl+ Alt+Fn, where Fn corresponds to user B, and sometimes console of user B opens without password.\n\n\nThere is one user whose account is much more likely can be accessed this way. I tried to change settings for requesting password on his account in various ways, but it did not affect the problem.\nThere is something else different with this user. His greeting is not like greeting of other users. All greetings show user name and password field on the left side of the screen, as in here, but greeting of easy-breakable user is different: all of the data in the middle of the screen, in different layout, and with button \"Switch User\". I do not understand where it defined. Can different greeting be connected to the problem of entering without password?\nCan it be a bug?\nWhich component is responsible for requesting passwords?\nDisplay manager and it's configuration:\ncat /etc/X11/default-display-manager\n/usr/sbin/lightdm\n\nsudo cat /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n[SeatDefaults]\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\nuser-session=ubuntu\nautologin-user=\nallow-guest=false\n\ngraphics card and driver info:\nsudo lshw -C video \n*-display             \n   description: VGA compatible controller\n   product: 4th Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller\n   vendor: Intel Corporation\n   physical id: 2\n   bus info: pci@0000:00:02.0\n   version: 06\n   width: 64 bits\n   clock: 33MHz\n   capabilities: msi pm vga_controller bus_master cap_list rom\n   configuration: driver=i915 latency=0\n   resources: irq:44 memory:f0000000-f03fffff memory:e0000000-efffffff ioport:f000(size=64)\n\n\nA: It turns out that a similar question has already been asked before on ru.stackoverflow.com, but there it was only about a greeting.\nThe old bug 878836 is to blame for both problems, for the login without a password and for an unusual greeting.\nCurrently, the bug has been partially repaired, and it's already impossible to enter without a password.  However, now the password is asked twice, but it's better than not asking at all.\nAccording to the latest comment on the launchpad (from 2016-04-04), it will be finally fixed after switching to Unity8 + Mir.

Suppose there is no installation process running and the PC goes off without the usual shutdown command. Is there any risk for my OS to be damaged? If yes, then what are those?\nIn other words: Why do I need to shutdown Ubuntu?\n\nA: One reason is disk caching.  There might be some data in the cache waiting to be written to a disk or USB drive, etc. where an instant turn off will drop the cache and whatever was there not written to disk will be lost.\nTo make matters worse, the disk cache doesn't just hold file content but file system meta-data.  If the latter is referred to by other file system meta-data already written to the underlying storage medium, the file system may become corrupted and you may not just lose a file or two but potentially (though unlikely) the whole file system.\n\nA: Firstly, how do you know that there is no (automated) package upgrade/installation process running at any given moment? In the 1–5 seconds that it takes you to look and turn off the computer, an installation may have been started. Only the shut down procedures of the operating system can ensure that no new service or task (e. g. package upgrading) was started since it checked for running tasks (i. e. by first stopping the task scheduler and then looking for still running tasks).\nSecondly, when you ask the system to shut down, the system in turn asks all existing processes and services to shut down. Some processes and especially services running on any modern operating system perform clean-up operations when they're shut down. In the most simple cases this means to relinquish acquired resources, e. g. delete a temporary file; in more complex cases this means to save changes to disk that were accumulated over the life time of that process.\nIf you turn off your computer without asking the system running on it to shut down, it may clutter your disk with left-over temporary files and leave application data in an old or inconsistent state.\n", "Q: Difference between OpenVPN Access Server and just OpenVPN I'm trying to setup a VPN using OpenVPN and I'm completely confused here.

Open AS has indeed a web interface that simplifies (a lot) the tasks for setting it up. Open CE on the other hand, has to be configured by editing some configuration files\nOpenVPN Access Server:\npros: very simple an intuitive configuration\ncons: limited to two concurrent users. Although each additional one costs only nine USD a year, they are purchased in blocks of ten.\nSome web features don´t work well (uploading your own CA certificate is one of them, so you still have to edit some files. See https://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/docs/admin-guides/175-how-to-replace-the-access-server-private-key-and-certificate.html, method two)\nOpenVPN Community Edition:\npros: completely free. Can have multiple concurrent users\ncons: configuration is not a simple task\nConclussion:\nIf you can deal with the two users restriction, go for OpenVPN AS.

Is this hardware supported \"fully\" By linux (ubuntu gnome) ? I ask because everything seem so sluggish on my laptop.

I have a few weeks to decide if I want to keep the laptop and I want to be sure to nail the origin of the problem before returning it to regret in the future.\nNote : I am wondering if changing the backend to compiz instead of metacity would make things better ( I highly doubt it ).\nThanks for any pointer !\n\nA: I'd like to share my experience with a similar issue.\nI recently bought a laptop with the same processor and I was experiencing problems with graphics.\nI necessarily have to work with Ubuntu 14.04 but it was not recognizing my laptop's hardware (skylake not supported). I had to install manually kernel 4.4.6 so everything worked properly, however I noticed compiz was taking more than 60% cpu. glxgears showed errors like:\n\"i965_dri.so does not support the 0x1916 PCI ID\"\n\"libGL error: pci id for fd 4: 8086:1916, driver (null)\", etc..\nand framerates above 300.\nThe reason was the GPU drivers were not properly updated so the CPU has to do the job in its place.

As the name suggests,I haven't used Ubuntu past the stage of just trying it out so far. I have grown to see though that it is a great OS & am currently typing this on a laptop that belongs to my auntie who is a light PC user that only has this one PC that she uses just for browsing/email, word-processing/spreadsheets, & for storing her pictures from her travels, but it's for the latter I seek your advice. The spec of the laptop is in the link below.\nhttp://www.toshiba.co.uk/discontinued-products/satellite-pro-p300-19q/\nI have replaced the old HDD with a Corsair 120GB SSD (can't remember type now but has trim (if that still matters)) as the main drive, but I'd like to install a 160GB as a mirror, that if not is a complete mirror, at least gives a true (as live as possible) backup of the main folders, so she doesn't have to worry about pretty much anything, short of loosing the laptop itself.\nSo people I ask, am I asking too much of this old but otherwise solid laptop & Ubuntu, or is they a easy(or ish) way of doing what I'm thinking here?\nKind regards,\nKarl\n\nA: You can create a (approx.) 120Gb partition on each of the drive and use the Linux software RAID mirror to create a volume.\nAssuming this is a clean install...\n\n\n*\n\n*Select the manual partitioning method and create a partition for /boot on each drive (same size).\n\n*Next create partition(s) for the rest of your filesystem on each drive (the partitions must be the same size -- if they are different, the smaller size will be used and the remaining space lost).\n\n*Tell the partitioner to use each of the 4 partitions as RAID space.\n\n*Continue to the software RAID configuration.\n\n*Create a new RAID mirror device and select the same size partitions on each drive.\n\n*Repeat for other partitions.\n\n*When you finish with the software RAID configuration, you should see the new RAID devices and can continue formatting them instead of your regular partitions.\n\n", "Q: debuild - secret key not available (someone elses key) I'm trying to build cairo with debuild.\nI get to the end and this message:\ngpg: skipped \"Robert Ancell <robert.ancell@canonical.com>\": secret key not available\n\nSince I'm not Robert Ancell, this makes sense - how do I make it use my own key ?\ngpg --list-key outputs:\n$ gpg --list-key /home/stu/.gnupg/pubring.gpg\n ----------------------------\npub   1024R/2ADA7053 2009-05-04 uid                  Launchpad PPA for Aleksander Morgado\n\npub   2048R/17F35B46 2015-01-28 uid                  Stuart Axon\n<stu.axon@gmail.com> uid                  Launchpad PPA for Stuart\nAxon <stuaxo2@yahoo.com> sub   2048R/B8E8ED59 2015-01-28\n\nand I have env var: \nDEBSIGN_KEYID=17F35B46\n\n\nA: debuild asks for the key of the user who last edited the changelog. If you are uploading to a PPA then your package must be different from its equivalent currently in the repositories and so you should have edited the changelog.\nUse dch to update the version and changelog, then rebuild. debuild will ask for your key. (If you're not sure what version numbers to use take a look at the Launchpad help docs.)\n\nA: Use the -k option to tell debuild which key to use, e.g.\ndebuild -kB57F5641\n\nNote that there's no space allowed between the -k and the key ID.\n\nA: I'm currently using XUbuntu 16.04 \"Xenial Xerus\" and was experiencing the same problem: both debuild and debsign were returning this secret key not available error, although I did create a local key and by the way I had uploaded it to the Ubuntu Keyserver, too.\nI had already tried to manually set my key by using the -k option. I also set my key as my default key, and I also edited the debian/changelog file, among a LOT of other things, but nothing worked: I was still getting the same error.\n...then I realized that I had created my key with gpg2 instead of gpg. Guess what I did?\n\n\n*\n\n*First, I opened a shell terminal window and renamed the gpg binary:\nsudo mv /usr/bin/gpg /usr/bin/gpg.bak\n\n\n*Then I created a gpg symbolic link pointing to the gpg2 binary:\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/gpg2 /usr/bin/gpg\n\nAfter I did this, commands like debuild -S -sa, debsign some-file_source.changes et cetera finally worked.\nI don't know what exactly is wrong with debuild, debsign, dpkg-buildpackage et cetera, but I'm under the impression that they're sending parameters to gpg although only gpg2 can parse (\"understand\") such parameters. Hence, making a symbolic link (in order to create a fake gpg binary that actually runs the gpg2 binary) solves the issue.\nThere are more elegant ways though to force debsign to use gpg2:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set -pgpg2 option of debsign.\n\n*Set DEBSIGN_PROGRAM=gpg2 in /etc/devscripts.conf or ~/.devscripts.\n\n\nA: Firstly, with every package revision, you have to edit the changelog.  This is a requirement if you make changes to the package; you can add such changelogs with dch, as Seth suggests.\nHowever, if you are simply trying to produce a package that has no additional changes, so you can just install the package, then you don't need to edit the changelog, you simply need to resolve the signing key issue.\n\n\nI don't believe either of the answers here is 100% complete.  Therefore, I will steal slightly from both, but add my own suggestion and solution here, as I do this with the nginx package merges quite often.\n\nTo quote Seth, debuild will determine the key based on what the last changelog editor was.  This is automatic, and you will need to update the changelog to use your credentials in them at the end of the latest changelog entry.\n\nAs was stated by Florian, though, you can also use the -kKEYIDNUM option to debuild tell it which key to sign with, and enforce the use of that key.\n\nAnd now, my solution to both issues, to make things automatically sign with the key I want to sign with...\nFor the longest time I ran into this issue whenever my old hard drives died on my previous system.  I did not want to edit the changelog each time, really, nor did I really want to manually pass the -k option each time to debuild.\nFinally, MOTUs helped me solve the problem by explicitly specifying what key to sign with, by introducing me to .devscripts, which debuild and others call upon environment variables with things defined in them; this permitted me to add options that dpkg-buildpackage, which debuild calls, will always append.\nSo, to make the -k option work automatically for every single debuild you run, you can add this to you ~/.devscripts file, and automatically add the -k option, like so:\nDEBUILD_DPKG_BUILDPACKAGE_OPTS=\"-kABCD1234\"\n\nThis will make it persistently added to the debuild options; this is also a way to enforce that your key will always be used for signing.\nThis helps me for both Ubuntu uploads, but also for PPA uploads.\n", "Q: Create a bootable USB stick for ubuntu (Mac) Not sure if I did it right, and the file got changed to a .img.dmg  ... not sure how that works.

Everything went very smoothly, except that every time I suspend the computer (either using the menu or by closing the lid), and then wake it up and log in, the WIFI is no longer available. I am, however, able to connect to the network via a wired connection.\nHere is \"rfkill list\" output before the suspend:  \n    0: hci0: Bluetooth  \n    Soft blocked: no  \n    Hard blocked: no  \n1: phy0: Wireless LAN  \n    Soft blocked: no  \n    Hard blocked: no  \n\nHere it is AFTER suspend/wake:  \n1: phy0: Wireless LAN  \n    Soft blocked: no  \n    Hard blocked: yes  \n\nI found MANY suggested workarounds for variations on this problem, and tried all of them to no avail. These include:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo rfkill unblock all (no effect - only works on Soft blocks)\n\n*Looking up the rfkill event number with \"rfkill events\" and then unblocking that event number (no effect - a new event is instantly generated with a new event number)\n\n*Clicking the WIFI disable key on the keyboard (works before the suspend, but has no effect after the suspend. I also tried disabling WIFI before suspending, but that had the same outcome.)\n\n*Downloading later versions of the firmware for the Intel 3160 wireless adapter and copying them into /lib/firmware. Currently used version was iwlwifi3160-12.ucode, I tried iwlwifi3160-13.ucode and iwlwifi3160-16.ucode. I also tried renaming the newer ones as iwlwifi3160-12.ucode (per instructions) and nothing produced any different results after restarts and suspend/wake.\n\n*Blacklisting HP drivers by adding \"hp-wmi\" or \"hp_wmi\" (found instructions for both spellings) to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf. Same problem after restart and suspend/wake.\n\n*Unloading the WIFI module (\"sudo modprobe -r iwlwifi\" followed by \"sudo modprobe iwlwifi\") No effect.\n\n*Restarting the network service with \"sudo service network-manager restart\" (no effect)\n\n*Waking network manager with \"sudo nmcli nm sleep false\" (responds that network manager is already awake, as also evidenced by the fact that wired networking is functioning). No effect.\n\n*Contacting Intel linux support. They suggested blacklisting HP drivers (already tried that), and then contacting HP or Ubuntu since \"This is likely a bug in the OEM wmi driver and a wifi bug.\".\n\n*Contacting HP support, who simply say they do not provide support for Ubuntu, but escalated the ticket anyway (waiting for a call back, but not holding my breath on that one).\nTried a few others along the way I think, but lost track. \nSince restarting Ubuntu is the ONLY thing so far that removes the hard block, I wonder what is happening during the restart that accomplishes that?

In my case, I switched from a Broadcom B43943142 wireless\\bluetooth card to an Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 7265 card and my problem was solved. The card was cheap (about $20) and provided a quick solution to my problem. The HP website has PDF manuals containing lists of compatible hardware. There's no guarantee it will work (and in your case, you’re having trouble with an Intel card), but if you have some spare pocket change switching up the hardware might by worth a try.\n\nA: Most likely you can unblock wifi with:\nnmcli nm wifi on\n\nThis is triggering the hardware switch to enable.\n\nA: I face the same problem all the time.

In your case this would be 2013 or 2010.\n\nA: As the community wiki says\n\nCompose+--. is the fastest way.\n\nNOTE: That is Compose + - (a hyphen keypress), a second press of that same key, and a . (period keypress), all in close succession.\nBut for those wondering what a \"Compose key\" is, it's a key not found on many modern American keyboards ... but that doesn't mean you're out of luck. You can enable a \"Compose\" key using your OS variant's keyboard tool.\nFor instance, in Linux Mint you would go to keyboard settings (or \"preferences\"), click the Layout tab, click the Options button, and then use Position of Compose Key option to set which key on your keyboard you want to use.\nI picked the right Windows key on my keyboard, and from that point on I could press that key, and then the hyphen key three times, to generate an em dash, or that key, a period, and two hyphens to generate an en dash.\n", "Q: MySQL 5.7 No directory, logging in with HOME=/ I'm sorry if this question has already been asked, but I can't find any solution to this (maybe small) issue:\nI just made a fresh install of mysql-server 5.7 on a 14.04 server.\nEvery time the MySQL service starts, I get this error:\nroot@xxx:/etc/mysql# service mysql restart\n * Stopping MySQL Community Server 5.7.11\n...\n * MySQL Community Server 5.7.11 is stopped\n * Re-starting MySQL Community Server 5.7.11\nNo directory, logging in with HOME=/\n..\n * MySQL Community Server 5.7.11 is started\n\nWhat does that mean?

Through the terminal, I used the mount command to find a disk partition that I wanted to remount as read-only.

Why is this the case?\n\nA: Within the context of -o, or Mount Options, r is not equivalent to 'read-only'; in fact, it doesn't even exist.  You need to use ro instead - the full command becomes this: mount -o remount,ro /dev/sdb2\nThe only place r exists as an option for mount is as an argument, and not a mount option.\n\nFrom the manpage on mount, I've pulled some informational sections here for you.  The #-preceeded comments are my own, and NOT from the manpage.\n# 'mount' command arguments (NOT mount options, which are passed via `-o`!)\n\n   -r, --read-only\n          Mount the filesystem read-only. A synonym is -o ro.\n\n   -o, --options opts\n          Options are specified with a -o flag followed by a  comma  sepa‐\n          rated string of options.

I installed Ubuntu on a USB drive to make sure it wouldn't mess with my default windows or system just yet but...it did anyways. It ended up installing grub and moved my default windows boot to /dev/sda2.

How do I set Windows back to the default boot or at least select it with grub when I start my computer without the USB?\n\nA: It seems that your are booting in legacy mode (instead of UEFI). However, please make sure your HDD is in MBR instead of GPT when trying the followings. To know the format of your HDD, boot into either Ubuntu or Windows and check with its Disk Utility.\n\nThe reason for your issue is, during your Ubuntu installation, you installed grub on /dev/sda (your Windows HDD), but the grub files are on your USB flash drive (which is mounted as /boot in Ubuntu). If you don't have your flash drive plugged in, grub's loader cannot find grub's files and then it fails to load the menu.\nTo fix it, you need to repair your MBR on your Windows HDD, and reinstall grub on your flash drive (otherwise your Ubuntu will not boot).\nTo repair your MBR, try any of these: (1) How to restore Windows 7 MBR without a CD; (2) How to fix the MBR for Windows 7?; (3) https://superuser.com/questions/156339/restore-win-7-mbr-without-recovery-install-disc; (4) https://superuser.com/questions/404364/fastest-way-to-restore-windows-7s-original-mbr\nTo re-install grub, try How to install grub on usb flash drive?\n", "Q: Can't connect to hostapd hotspot - Password Loop I have a Linksys router that I've set to use Mixed B/G Mode, WPA2 Personal, and AES, and I'm trying to replicate that setup on a single-board computer running hostapd so that I can eliminate a box from a portable system that I'm building.

I suggest an until loop:\ndropbox stop && dropbox start && \nuntil dropbox status | grep -q \"Up to date\";\ndo \n  sleep 1; \ndone\n\nuntil runs until the command returns true, that's when dropbox status output contains Up to date.\n\nA: Set a condition for the while loop\nIf you replace\nwhile true\n\nby:\nwhile [ \"$(dropbox status)\" != \"Up to date\" ]\n\nit works as you describe.\nThe command\nTo stop/start Dropbox and finish after synchronizing is done becomes then:\ndropbox stop && dropbox start && while  [ \"$(dropbox status)\" != \"Up to date\" ]; do dropbox status; sleep 1; done\n\nOr better (to prevent doubling dropbox status):\ndropbox stop && dropbox start && while  [ \"$(dropbox status)\" != \"Up to date\" ]; do echo \"Updating\"; sleep 1 ; done && echo \"Finished\"\n\nExplanation\nwhile true is waiting for a break condition inside the loop (which never comes), but while [ \"$(dropbox status)\" != \"Up to date\" makes the loop break if dropbox status returns Up to date\n\nA: Define it as a function in your $HOME/.bashrc\nsyncDropBox()\n{\ndropbox stop && \\\ndropbox start && \nwhile true; \ndo \n  STAT=\"$(dropbox status)\"\n  if [ \"$STAT\" = \"Up to date\"  ] ; then\n  break # or add more commands to finilize the process\n  fi\n  sleep 1; \ndone\n}\n\nNow, I don't have dropbox cmd app, so depending on the way it outputs status, you may or may not process it with AWK or grep.\nBut point being that you can either store output to value or redirect output to another command, and evaluate them. Once we get specific output string - break\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 not start after update Ubuntu 15.10 not start after update.\nToday i update my ubuntu 15.10 around 11 AM (IST) after update it prompt msg for reboot.\nAfter rebooting ubuntu unable to start.\nThen i revert to previous snapshot it works.\nBut again after software update it unable to start.\n\nA: Here is the description https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1548587/comments/18\nReboot your PC, hold shift while boot load and select previous kernel. \nLast kernel seems broken\n\nA: The same happens to me. Today updated the kernel to version 4.2.0.30 and Ubuntu freezes after grub. If I try no start from the upstart option I get this message: \"Upstart: broken pipe\".

It halts at 'white line' screen before.\n\nI have restarted the VM, but there is no change, it always fails at the same point.\nIs there any option/way to make Ubuntu VM works again? It is important due to lot of work is inside.\nI don't know how access to console/terminal or similar.\n\nA: Have the same problem running 15.04 in VMware.\nThe solution is to restart the VM, get into advanced boot options(for me it means spamming ESC as soon as the VM starts, same principle as getting into Recovery Mode). Once there go to Advanced options for Ubuntu, and select an older version(not recovery mode or upstart or whatever, just a plain older kernel version), press enter.\nThere's instructions on google to make it so that the older version is picked on every boot, if you'd like. Hopefully this issue gets resolved soon.\n\nA: For now you can rollback to the previous version of linux kernel: \napt-get --purge remove linux-image-4.2.0-30-generic linux-image-extra-4.2.0-30-generic\n\nAfter applying this command it should pick 4.2.0-27 which works fine. \nHere's \"official\" bug addressing this issue https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1548587 \n", "Q: How to rename a part of file using find command in directory and sub directories I have a lots of log file in a directory and it's sub directory named as dataupload_sales_.xxx.com.dat.

I have a Dell Precision M6300 laptop with ubuntu 14.04 LTS installed, that I use at work for linux software. I was working from a satellite office, and connected to the head office using VPN to pick up the software license, and it was working fine.\nHowever, I did notice that whenever I worked from home (both over ethernet and wireless), this laptop would give a \"VPN connection failed\" message. I did find a workaround for this, which involved disconnecting the laptop from the home router, turning on the mobile hotspot on my mobile phone, connecting the laptop to the mobile hotspot, and making the VPN connection over the mobile internet connection, and it would work.\nSo this ubuntu laptop makes the VPN connection successfully from the satellite office, over my mobile internet, and over a couple of other locations (other people's homes), but does not connect on my home network (on either cable or wireless).

However, I fixed the issue by changing router settings.\nGoogling \"VMDG490 VPN\" came up with a lot of helpful links, such as here, here and here.\nVirgin Media hubs have \"PPTP Pass-Through\" disabled by default. Therefore I needed to log in to my router by typing 192.168.0.1 into a browser, entering my settings password, going to \"Advanced Settings\", then \"Security/Firewall\", then on the firewall page, tick \"PPTP Pass-Through\" (other VPN users may want to tick \"IPSec Pass-Through\"), and finally click \"Apply\".\nThe change has fixed the issue: my ubuntu laptop now connects to the VPN using my home network.\nSorry this has gone off-topic, but I didn't realise it was not ubuntu-related until I found the solution. However, it is still a mystery why Windows did work using the same router to the same VPN server, the guides linked above are aimed at Windows users, so Windows should not have worked.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS hangs on boot after latest dist-upgrade in VMware I ran apt-get dist-upgrade as follows:\nCalculating upgrade...

This will allow you to go into the Ubuntu desktop.\n\n*From there open up synaptic package manager. Locate linux-image-3.19.0-51-generic (or the latest kernel you have installed).\n\n*Right-click and select \"Mark for Removal\".\n\n*Apply and restart.\n\nA: I haven't kept a record of the boot text information, but had similar problems (Windows 7 64-bit host VMware Workstation 12 Player), initially with the 15.10 Wily Werewolf VM I had been using for a while. After installing the latest updates a couple of days ago my VM wouldn't boot and got stuck on a black screen. I tried to work around the problem by creating a new 14.04.3 LTS VM from the .iso I had used before. This guest VM worked fine until I updated it and then it wouldn't boot either. So I tried a new install of 15.10 guest VM again and sure enough it seems to be something in the latest updates that is the cause (as the 2 VMs I tried have different kernels - I need a later kernel for USB 3.0 capability).\n", "Q: Ubuntu Touch: Ubuntu Online Accounts - where is the information stored? I use the MX4 with UT OTA-9.\nIf I start system settings > user accounts or e.g. the preinstalled Twitter-App I'm directed to \"Ubuntu Online Accounts\". Where is the data stored, I entered there? Local on my phone or in \"the cloud\"? Is it the same service as Ubuntu One (https://login.ubuntu.com/+login)? Where are the server located?\n\nA: The data is stored locally on your phone. Most of the account data is stored in the SQLite database file located in ~/.config/libaccounts-glib/accounts.db, while ACLs (access control lists, that is the list of apps authorized to use an account) are stored in ~/.config/signond/signon.db and passwords in ~/.config/signond/signon-secrets.db.\nThe last file does not exist on the Unity7 desktop, where passwords are stored in the GNOME keyring instead.\n", "Q: Sudo has lower privileges then normal user I have a strange problem. I am using Ubuntu 14.04 and an NFS home folder, and currently if i try to log in i get thrown back to the loginscreen\nI have a NAS, and the home directory is located there. I mount the NAS via NFS at my fstab like this:\n157.181.240.65:/dlab    /dlab   nfs defaults    0   0\n\nAfter that i modified my /etc/passwd file to point the home directory to a folder on my mounted NAS like this:\ngerdos:x:1003:1020:Erdos Gabor,,,:/dlab/home/gerdos:/bin/bash\n\nI created every file on the NAS with the same 1003 USERID and 1020 GRPID\nNow after a recent update via apt-get i am unable to log into a graphical user interface (gnome flashback compiz). \nI think some permissions are bad. I cant really use sudo on files in my home directory, even i clearly have a permission.\nA strange one for example:\nnano ~/asd # --> No problem, can nano it perfectly,\nsudo nano ~/asd # --> Error reading /dlab/home/gerdos/.nano_history: Permission denied\n\nStrange. Permissions on ~/.nano_history:\n-rw-------  1 gerdos dlab       39 Feb 23 10:51 .nano_history\n\nIt is clear that i have read and write permissions, but sudo does not. I guess the problem might come from somewhere here, that i cant log in. \nIf i change the permission to 755 sudo still cant read it. On 777 it can. I would like to avoid putting all my files to 777.\nHow can i solve this problem? How can i \"combine\" the sudo on the NAS and on my CPU to work together? Is this causing the problem that i can login?\n\nA: That's a feature of NFS. Since NFS packets are not authenticated (they just say UID=x,GID=y, trust me), any NFS packets claiming to be from root (UID=0, GID=0) are remapped to nobody, a userid/groupid with NO privileges:  \n$ grep nobody /etc/passwd\nnobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin\n\nThe other choice (A Very Bad Idea) is to believe the UID=0 in the NFS packet from Some Other System, and grant it root access to the NFS server/NAS. DO NOT DO THIS.\n", "Q: ubuntu sdk ,run default app on ubuntu phone I'm trying  to run a default qml application on my phone.

Since it became unrealistic to clean his windows machine of numerous spyware and sales toolbars, I gave him 14.04 LTS.\nAll has been wonderful. Calls are now limited to \"How do I print this damn thing again?\" That being said, now his trading platform will not run. Tech support have not helped.\nBefore they offered the Linux version on their site, I was able successfully to get it running under wine. We eventually changed over to their Linux file and all was good. \nRecently they updated their platform since Oracle 7 is no longer being supported and you have to move to Oracle 8.\nProblem: Thinkorswim will no longer run. Initially it cannot connect to its server to update its version. So far I have: \n\n\n*\n\n*Installed Oracle 8 (32 bit then 64 bit) manually, and through the gui \n\n*Uninstalled and reinstalled the Thinkorswim package (manually and through the gui) \n\n*Unistalled Thinkorswim and installed the Windows version under wine.\n\n\nNow the Thinkorswim platform updates, but it will not launch. I get the following: \nNo JVM could be found on your system. Please define EXEJ-JAVA-HoME to point the the installed 32 bit JDK or JRE.\n\nI tried installing java manually using the windows version through wine (as per a suggestion on Ubuntu Forums) and that won't launch either.\nCan you guys give me some suggestions? \n\nA: To get thinkorswim to work on ubuntu 16.04 [and other versions] you need a java version of oracle java 8. In java version \"1.8.0_91\" [java 8 update 91] the security settings will not allow thinkorswim to run so you need an earlier version [pre-java8 update 20].\nI used java 8 update 11. Set the security setting to medium. Has to be the oracle version of java. Here's a link to old java versions:\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase8-2177648.html#jre-8u11-oth-JPR\nYou have to install \"for this user only.\" Follow thinkorswim instructions such as do not run after installation completes.

Uncheck the box and click \"Finish.\"\n\n*After choosing \"Finish,\" close all open windows and locate the\nthinkorswim file on your desktop. Right click it and select\n\"Properties.\"\n\n*Now, like before, select the \"Permissions\" tab, set \"Access to read\nand write,\" check the box to \"Allow executing file as program\" and\nthen, click \"Close.\"\n\n*You will now have a thinkorswim icon on your desktop.

I decided to install x32 version of Ubuntu 14.04 where Wi-Fi and this 3G USB modem works out of the box. It doesn't work perfectly, sometimes it doesn't connect and I have to replug the modem, but at least it works like this.\nI assume it's a bug in Ubuntu x64\n\nA: Switching your device from 'storage-mode' to 'modem-mode' will do.\ncd /etc/usb_modeswitch.d/\nsudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digidietze/usb-modeswitch-data/master/usb_modeswitch.d/12d1%3A1505\n\nOpen '/lib/udev/rules.d/40-usb_modeswitch.rules' \nsudo gedit /lib/udev/rules.d/40-usb_modeswitch.rules\n\nAnd add this line before the line reading LABEL=\"modeswitch_rules_end\" in the end:\n\nATTR{idVendor}==\"12d1\", ATTR{idProduct}==\"1505\", RUN+=\"usb_modeswitch\n  '%b/%k'\"\n\nJust unplug and re-plug.\nWait for about 10 seconds and see if a menu entry appears on the network applet.\n", "Q: Packet Tracer 6.x on kubuntu 15.10 : unfind libkdeinit5_PacketTracer6.so I've tried to install the 6.2 and 6.3 version of Packet Tracer but when I run it I get this error message from plasma:\n\nCannot load library /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libkdeinit5_PacketTracer6.so\n\nNothing happens if I execute PT in a terminal. I tried to find some information on google but came up empty.\n\nA: If someone has the same problem, I have solved it:\nFirst, don't execute Packet Tracer with the icon or with the command \"packettracer\" because it'll give you false information or nothing at all.\nSo to debug your packet tracer go to the installation directory (default: /opt/pt) and in the bin folder execute the command PacketTracer6 and you get the missing dependencies:\nsillicius@DIY1:/opt/pt/bin$ ./PacketTracer6                                                           \n./PacketTracer6: error while loading shared libraries: libcrypto.so.1.0.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nSolution: \nInstall libsll1.0.0:i386 (64bits versions doesn't work with PT) and link it: \n$ sudo apt-get install libcrypto.so.1.0.0:i386    \n$ sudo ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.1.0.0 /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.1.0.0\n\nNext dependencies not found:\n/opt/pt/bin$ ./PacketTracer6                                                                  \n./PacketTracer6: error while loading shared libraries: libQtWebKit.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nSolution:\n$ sudo apt-get install libqtwebkit4:i386    \n\n.    \n/opt/pt/bin$ ./PacketTracer6     \n./PacketTracer6: error while loading shared libraries: libQtScriptTools.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nSolution:\n$ sudo apt-get install libqt4-scripttools:i386\n\nAfter this, PT worked correctly for me.\n", "Q: one JVM only -- how? I had to install the Oracle JDK to get Netbeans to launch (forgot about umake).\nNow that I have the official JVM, I want to remove each and every other JVM -- all the OpenJDK stuff, including IcedTea, et. al.\nCan I have \"one Java\" to rule them all?  Partly, it just makes sense, and, partly, it's a mild security concern.  On Windows, I know that there were many problems with regards to version numbers and outdated JVM's.  As I recall, there was a notice to that effect for Ubuntu, too.  \n\nA: There are several ways to do this, some of them may lead to problems.  \nRemove OpenJDK the safe way by selecting everything yourself.  \nCheck what is installed and what you want to remove.  \nOpen a terminal and execute :  \nsudo dpkg --get-selections  \n\nSelect and purge the packages you want to remove.  \nOpen a terminal and execute :  \nsudo apt-get purge <package>  \n\nExample :  \nRemoval of installed packages\nopenjdk-8-jdk:amd64\nopenjdk-8-jre:amd64\nopenjdk-8-jre-headless:amd64 \nsudo apt-get purge openjdk-8-jdk openjdk-8-jre openjdk-8-jre-headless\n\n", "Q: meizu mx4 no boot no recovery I was playing with the terminal.\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get update, no problem\n\n*sudo apt-get upgrade, no problem\n\n\nBut when it finished with the upgrade the phone stopped working.\nDidn't open any apps so I did a reboot.\nBut it won't start anymore, it stays at the meizu logo.\nWhen I try to go to recovery I get the Ubuntu logo and nothing works.\n\nA: I finally got it back to work.\nWith my Ubuntu laptop and the right commands I was able to flash Ubuntu touch.\nI didn't even lost my data.\nubuntu-device-flash touch --device arale --channel ubuntu-touch/stable/meizu.en\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 doesn't boot grub prompt I have Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) installed on my laptop. It was working fine, but then I occidentally deleted the first partition which has the EFI stuff which is mounted to /boot/efi by default.\nBut after I deleted the partition, I reformatted it to FAT32, set it to mount automatically to /boot/efi, and copied the EFI files from another computer similar to mine. After that I can manually boot to the system after passing through the GRUB menu and can do the root=(hd...) and configfile /boot/grub/grub.cfg.\nThen the system boots to the my Ubuntu installation, but after running sudo update-grub and updating the /etc/fstab file with the correct UUID of the EFI device I still have to manually boot; it won't boot on it's own.\nFinally, I used the boot repair tool to create this boot repair summary.\nSo, how can I make Ubuntu boot automatically like it was before?\nNote: No dual-boot here, just one Ubuntu 14.04 installation.\nThis is the Boot Repair output:\nBoot Info Script e7fc706 + Boot-Repair extra info      [Boot-Info 9Feb2015]\n\n\n============================= Boot Info Summary: ===============================\n\n => No boot loader is installed in the MBR of /dev/sda.\n\nsda1: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       vfat\n    Boot sector type:  FAT32\n    Boot sector info:  No errors found in the Boot Parameter Block.\n    Operating System:\n    Boot files:        /EFI/ubuntu/MokManager.efi /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi\n                       /EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi\n\nsda2: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ext4\n    Boot sector type:  -\n    Boot sector info:\n    Operating System:  Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS\n    Boot files:        /boot/grub/grub.cfg /etc/fstab\n                       /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf\n\nsda3: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       swap\n    Boot sector type:  -\n    Boot sector info:\n\n============================ Drive/Partition Info: =============================\n\nDrive: sda _____________________________________________________________________\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 1000.2 GB, 1000204886016 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 121601 cylinders, total 1953525168 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes\n\nPartition  Boot  Start Sector    End Sector  # of Sectors  Id System\n\n/dev/sda1                   1 1,953,525,167 1,953,525,167  ee GPT\n\n\nGUID Partition Table detected.\n\nPartition    Start Sector    End Sector  # of Sectors System\n/dev/sda1           2,048     1,050,623     1,048,576 Data partition (Windows/Linux)\n/dev/sda2       1,050,624 1,936,986,111 1,935,935,488 Data partition (Linux)\n/dev/sda3   1,936,986,112 1,953,523,711    16,537,600 Swap partition (Linux)\n\n\"blkid\" output: ________________________________________________________________\n\nDevice           UUID                                   TYPE       LABEL\n\n/dev/sda1        207B-0881                              vfat\n/dev/sda2        355dd0f2-70a0-4000-bc1a-47498e2213c3   ext4\n/dev/sda3        d2b8d8bf-11f3-4c40-8883-b209f461c842   swap\n\n========================= \"ls -l /dev/disk/by-id\" output: ======================\n\ntotal 0\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  9 Feb 23 15:08 ata-ST1000LM024_HN-M101MBB_S32XJ9DF913130 -> ../../sda\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Feb 23 14:59 ata-ST1000LM024_HN-M101MBB_S32XJ9DF913130-part1 -> ../../sda1\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Feb 23 14:59 ata-ST1000LM024_HN-M101MBB_S32XJ9DF913130-part2 -> ../../sda2\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Feb 23 14:59 ata-ST1000LM024_HN-M101MBB_S32XJ9DF913130-part3 -> ../../sda3\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  9 Feb 23 14:59 ata-TSSTcorp_CDDVDW_SU-228FB_S12H6YHF5050Z8 -> ../../sr0\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  9 Feb 23 14:59 usb-SanDisk_Cruzer_Switch_4C530301300708123022-0:0 -> ../../sdb\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  9 Feb 23 15:08 wwn-0x50004cf20e1127da -> ../../sda\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Feb 23 14:59 wwn-0x50004cf20e1127da-part1 -> ../../sda1\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Feb 23 14:59 wwn-0x50004cf20e1127da-part2 -> ../../sda2\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Feb 23 14:59 wwn-0x50004cf20e1127da-part3 -> ../../sda3\n\n================================ Mount points: =================================\n\nDevice           Mount_Point              Type       Options\n\n/dev/sda1        /boot/efi                vfat       (rw)\n/dev/sda2        /                        ext4       (rw,errors=remount-ro)\n\n\n=========================== sda2/boot/grub/grub.cfg: ===========================\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#\n# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE\n#\n# It is automatically generated by grub-mkconfig using templates\n# from /etc/grub.d and settings from /etc/default/grub\n#\n\n### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/00_header ###\nif [ -s $prefix/grubenv ];

This will enable this feature. GPT detected. Please create a BIOS-Boot partition (>1MB, unformatted filesystem, bios_grub flag). This can be performed via tools such as Gparted. Then try again.\n\n\n=================== Advice in case of suggested repair\nThe boot of your PC is in EFI mode, but no EFI partition was detected. You may want to retry after creating a EFI partition (FAT32, 100MB~250MB, start of the disk, boot flag).\nDo you want to continue?\n\n\n=================== Final advice in case of suggested repair\n\n\nThe boot files of [Linux] are far from the start of the disk. Your BIOS may not detect them. You may want to retry after creating a /boot partition (EXT4, >200MB, start of the disk). This can be performed via tools such as gParted. Then select this partition via the [Separate /boot partition:] option of [Boot Repair]. (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootPartition)\n\n\n=================== User settings\nThe settings chosen by the user will not act on the boot.\n\n\nA: I have two suggestions:\nOption 1\nIn Ubuntu, examine the /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/grub.cfg file. It should look something like this:\nsearch.fs_uuid f8b548e2-4984-47d4-896e-0f47bb753373 root hd0,gpt2 \nset prefix=($root)'/boot/grub'\nconfigfile $prefix/grub.cfg\n\nThis example tells GRUB to look for the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file on the partition with a UUID of f8b548e2-4984-47d4-896e-0f47bb753373, which it expects on hd0,gpt2 (that is, /dev/sda2). You should update this file with your current information. Use blkid to find the UUID of your current root (/) partition (/dev/sda2) and change it in this configuration file.\nThere's also a chance that you're missing /boot/grub/grub.cfg (not to be confused with /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/grub.cfg, which is the stub I've just described). If so, a sudo update-grub should regenerate that file.\nOption 2\nIf the preceding doesn't work, or if you just don't like GRUB, you could install my rEFInd boot manager. You can download the Debian package from its downloads page or install the PPA and do a sudo apt-get install refind. Either way, rEFInd should take over from GRUB as the default boot program. rEFInd is a lot less finicky than GRUB and so is less likely to cause this sort of problem. Certainly whatever your current GRUB configuration problem is will not affect rEFInd.\nThere are other alternatives besides rEFInd, too; see this page of mine for a list and my thoughts on them all. IIRC, ELILO and SYSLINUX are both in the Ubuntu repositories and may install fairly easily, but I've not tested them recently. As you've got a single-boot installation with Secure Boot disabled, these tools should both work fine for your needs and are worth considering if you want something in the main Ubuntu repositories.\n", "Q: Sudo command locked I have problem, when I try to use sudo command I immediately get these messages:\nSorry, try again. \nSorry, try again.  \nSorry, try again.  \nsudo: 3 incorrect password attempts\n\nThere's no chance to enter anything before they appear.\n\nA: I have seen this when using ldap, as a workaround I've set the NOPASSWD option in /etc/sudoers. I never did find out the root cause.\nlog in as root and run \nvisudo\n\nand change the line\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\nto\n%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\n\n(your group may not be named sudo but admin or something else)\nWARNING: this setting means you will never be asked for a password when using sudo, making it easier to accidentally break your system\n\nA: If everything else failed and nothing worked, reboot the system, but hold down the shift key and it'll take you to the grub listing where you can jump into recovery mode.\nAt that point, you will be able to drop to root and then you can execute this: passwd thisuser and the system will reset the lock and ask for new password (and confirmation on 2nd attempt).  Once that's done, log out and reboot entirely.\nthisuser = your actual username\nThen everything should work as expected.  Meanwhile, I would like to point out about adding username in /etc/sudoers is something I would not recommend, based on my experience several years ago where I saw that it's kinda more than dangerous to have your username listed in sudoers file.  That file isn't meant to be edited nor customized at all.  \n", "Q: LibreOffice 5.1 doesn't integrate with Unity in Ubuntu 15.10 I have upgraded Libreoffice to 5.1  using official PPA. But the menus don't integrate  with Unity bar. I've already tried to uninstall and reinstall with no success. Also, I can't change the icon size or styles which is now in high contrast. \nAny hints on how to proceed?\nEDIT: Removing the libreoffice-gtk3 package by sudo apt-get remove libreoffice-gtk3 has fixed it\n\n\nA: The fully supported edition of LibreOffice in Ubuntu 15.10 is version 5.0.\nThis tested version is available in the official Ubuntu 15.10 repositories.  \nMost probably LibreOffice 5.1 will be included in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.\nUnity integration should work fine after the final release in April.  \nThe LibreOffice Fresh PPA is not an official Ubuntu repository.\nIt is an option for those, who want to use the latest software.  \nThis - of course - may lead to the one or other minor issue.\nIt is also recommended to wait for the first point release.  \nYou can decide whether to downgrade to version 5.0 or,\nlive with the situation as it is and use the latest edition.\nAdditional corresponding information :\nLibreOffice fails to integrate with Unity\nUpdate information 2016-03-02 : \nLibreOffice 5.1.1 is now available in the LibreOffice Fresh PPA.\nLibreOffice 5.1 integration with the Unity menu bar works now.\n", "Q: Check several files with MD5 Every month, a company sends me a hard drive - ext4 encrypted with cryptsetup -  with backup files from a server. In that drive there are 1000+ files, and they almost fill up a 2Tb HDD. Each file has a corresponding .md5 file so we can check the integrity of it, but as you could imagine, I can't check every single one of them by hand in terminal, so I copy them to another hard drive and check them in Windows. On Ubuntu is there any way to check all files, or even just all files in a folder? Thanks.\n\nA: Yes, you can.\nAssuming every file has just a md5 file in the same directory with just a appending .md5, create a script file (e. g. md5check.sh) with following content:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"Building file list...\"\n$ALLFLS=\"$(find)\"\necho \"Checking all files...\"\nfor word in $ALLFLS; do\n    if [[ $(cat \"$word.md5\") == $(md5sum -b \"$word\") ]]; then\n        echo \"$word OK\"\n    else\n        echo \"MD5 wrong for $word\"\n        exit\n    fi\ndone\necho \"All files correct!\"\n\nThis checks if every file. Please report if it worked. (Make sure you have changed the directory to your hard drive before executing the script and make sure you have chmod +x it)\nEdit:\nYou can also check this page.\n\nA: This information is weirdly hard to find, but if you want to check all the md5's against their respective files in a directory (for example Downloads) you just:\ncd Downloads\nmd5sum -c *.md5\n\nThis will output a list of the files checked with either OK or FAILED\nSee: https://linux.die.net/man/1/md5sum for more information.\n\nA: If all the files are in the same directory (no subdirectories), you can run md5sum -c on every .md5 file. The following will also save errors to a file which you can check afterwards.\nlogerrors=\"md5errors.log\"\nfor f in *.md5; do\n    md5sum -c \"$f\" 2>> \"$logerrors\" || echo \"ERROR on $f\"\ndone\n\nIf your .md5 files are also to be found in subdirectories, you can use something like this:\nfind . -type f -name \"*.md5\" \\\n| while read f; do\n    d=\"$(dirname \"$f\")\"; b=\"$(basename \"$f\")\"\n    ( cd \"$d\"; md5sum -c \"$b\" || echo \"Error on $f\" | tee -a \"$logerrors\" )\n  done\n\nSee also man md5sum. In particular, you may want to use the --quiet option:\n\ndon't print OK for each successfully verified file\n\n", "Q: What is Ubuntu mate login manager I'd like to change the keyboard configuration of the login manager of Ubuntu Mate, and for this I need to find the configuration file.\nBut I don't know what is the login manager.\nSo what is the ubuntu-mate login manager, or where can I find this info ?\nEDIT: My problem is different as the one suggested, because none of theses solutions work for me.\n\nA: Basic info on configuring LightDM: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LightDM\nAnd the following page explains how to change keyboard layout on the login screen (Lightdm GTK+ Greeter) in Ubuntu MATE:\nhttps://ubuntu-mate.community/t/how-to-set-keyboard-layout-on-login-screen/1405\nSo, in Lightdm GTK+ Greeter Settings > Panel you can add the keyboard layout indicator by which you can change the default keyboard layout:\n\nAlso, add the following lines to /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf in order to set default keyboard layout (French in this example):\n[Seat:*]\ndisplay-setup-script = setxkbmap -model pc105 -layout fr\n\n", "Q: windows 7 with deep freeze bypass from ubuntu why? why I can bypass deep Freeze by logging in windows partition from Ubuntu and edit what I want is it freeze. I just go to the windows partition file system, then I go to desktop and edit any file I want, then I reboot in windows 7 and I found my file that I edit from Ubuntu. so what is advantage of deep freeze it's useless?\n\nA: Straight from the wikipedia article, Deep Freeze cannot protect you in this case:\n\nDeep Freeze cannot protect the operating system and hard drive upon\n  which it is installed if the computer is booted from another medium\n  (such as another bootable partition or internal hard drive, an\n  external hard drive, a USB device, optical media, or network server).\n  In such cases, a user would have real access to the contents of the\n  (supposedly) frozen system.[3] On a Windows-based computer, this\n  scenario may be prevented by configuring the CMOS (nonvolatile BIOS\n  memory) on the workstation to boot only to the hard drive to be\n  protected, then password protecting the CMOS. This is a normal\n  precaution for most public access computers. A further precaution\n  would be to lock the PC case shut with a physical lock or tiedown\n  cable system to prevent access to motherboard jumpers.\n\n", "Q: Sublime Text build 3103 fails I downloaded sublime-text_build-3103_amd64.deb, but it says it demages the available package \"sublime-text-installer\" because of conflict with sublime-text() when I open it in the software center. This error msg is shown inside ubuntu software center.\nWhat's the issue?\n\nA: You apparently originally installed Sublime Text from a third-party source or PPD. On the command line, run\nsudo apt-get remove sublime-text-installer\n\nto remove the old package, then switch to the directory where you downloaded the new .deb file and run\nsudo dpkg -i sublime-text_build-3103_amd64.deb\n\nto reinstall from the official source. This method will not remove your custom settings or packages. However, depending on how you set up your previous installation, you'll need to use the command-line shortcut subl instead of sublime.\nFinally, I recommend reading through my answer here for information on making Sublime your default text editor, if you haven't already.\n", "Q: How to open a terminal from within Atom? I'm currently working with Atom, and sometimes I want to open a terminal on the directory my working file is. To do this, I usually have to open the folder in nautilus (right clicking the file in atom) and then I open a terminal on that directory from nautilus (right click).\nI wonder if there is a way to open the terminal in the file directory without having to open nautilus first.\n\nA: Try this package, I think it has exactly what you want.\nAlso, I suggest you to install term3 package. It works great for me, and I just don't have to bother with switching the windows as the terminal window is inside the atom editor.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I use the terminal-plus package to open my terminal from within the Atom text editor. You can see the package in action in this short video clip I made here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFAzqvYoHJs&t=11m14s.\nAfter installing the package, to start the terminal within Atom you can use the GUI or use cmd-shift-t on Mac or ctrl-shift-t on Windows/Linux to bring up a terminal in the editor. To spawn another terminal session you repeat the previous command.\n\nA: An option could be Platformio IDE Terminal (terminal package for Atom).\nSome ot their features are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Terminal Naming\n\n*Color Coding\n\n*Sorting\n\n*Insert selected text\n\n\nA: There are a lot of terminal packages you can use in Atom.

I would like to promote a Ubuntu Install Fest. Can Canonical give me official support for it?\nI would like to do a Install Fest with posters, mugs, etc. The problem is I don't have money.\nCan someone, or Canonical help me?\nMy place:  Rio de Janeiro - RJ , Brazil\n\nA: One possibility is Ubuntu donations funding. The person who applies needs to be an Ubuntu member.\n\nHow to apply for funding Applying for funding is simple. Please first\nreview the guidelines above and then simply go to this form and fill\nin the form and we will follow up with you soon.\nExamples   Here are some examples of common areas we will likely fund:\n\n*\n\n*Sponsorship for upstream events and LoCo Team events.\n\n*LoCo costs (e.g. postage costs for sending equipment to different team members).\n\n*Equipment (e.g. if a community member wants to add support for the equipment to Ubuntu).\n\n*Travel (e.g. coverage of full or part of the expenses for attending an event).\n\nHere are some things we will not fund:\n\n*\n\n*Anything illegal.\n\n\n*Sending a check for an amount to an individual or\nteam.\nQ: What can I ask for funding for?\nA: You can ask for funding for\nitems that needs purchasing that bring value to the Ubuntu community\n(e.g. sponsorship of an event, equipment, travel etc). Please note\nthat we will only approve requests where the money will benefit the\nUbuntu family of projects (Ubuntu and flavors).\n\n", "Q: Can't connect to sites Ubuntu 15.10 In my lab using Ubuntu 15.10,when accessing some official sites only one system get connect to that sites remaining systems not get connected to that sites. giving resolve error.

I've put it into startup list, but how do I run it every, like, 5 minutes, automatically?\n\nA: Put it in your crontab.\nOpen your cron table by:\ncrontab -e\n\nNow add:\n*/5 * * * * /path/to/script.sh\n\nDon't forget to make the script executable beforehand.\n\nAs your script depends on X, probably will be a good idea to add the DISPLAY to the script's environment:\n*/5 * * * * DISPLAY=:0 /path/to/script.sh\n\nReplace :0 with your actual DISPLAY (can be found by echo $DISPLAY from interactive session).\nIf needed, you can add the XAUTHORITY environment variable too:\n*/5 * * * * DISPLAY=:0 XAUTHORITY=\"~/.Xauthority\" /path/to/script.sh\n\nAgain you can find the value by echo $XAUTHORITY.\n\nA: The lazy option\nIf you want the easy way, and avoid having to find out which environment variable to set:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure your script includes the shebang\n\n*Make it executable\n\n*Add the following to Startup Applications:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15 && while true; do <path_to_your_script.sh> ; sleep 300; done\"\n\nDash > Startup Applications > Add. Add the command:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15 && while true; do <path_to_your_script.sh> ; sleep 300; done\"\n\nExplanation\nIf you run the script from your own environment (e.g. from a terminal window or from Startup Applications), a number of environment variables will be set. cron however runs your script with a limited set of environment variables. \nSince your script no doubt uses the gsettings command:\ngsettings get org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri <wallpaper>\n\nto set the wallpaper, almost certainly the command will break when run from cron.\nThe downside of \"the lazy solution\" is purely theoretical. A command that sleeps practically continuously means nothing to your system. \nAdditional info; alternatively\nReading this post, and from experiences in the past, I am pretty sure the DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable needs to be set.\nTo do so, add the following section at the beginning of your script (below the shebang):\nPID=$(pgrep gnome-session)\nexport DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=$(grep -z DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS /proc/$PID/environ|cut -d= -f2-)\n\nThen you should be able to successfully run it from cron.\nYou could however very well save the hustle, and choose the lazy option.\n", "Q: Using ubuntu14.04/windows 10 as OS's... my ethernet connection (straight into the wall, not a router) has stopped working Window's performed an automatic update without my consent and after restarting to use ubuntu my ethernet stopped working.

I've got room, and a partition free on both. So can I install Ubuntu using my SSD for Boot/System/SWAP only, and use the hard drive for User Data? If so, how would I do this? Thanks\n\nA: Yes very much. If you are not comfortable with disk partitioning and linux - I will suggest do all the partitioning operations in Windows 7-> Disk management. And then install linux. At the time of installing linux choose 'something else' as mentioned in this thread.\nRest everything is almost the same after this step.\nMake sure that Windows allows only 4 primary partitions. One can have extended partitions within primary partitions. \nWithin Linux one can make use of Logical Volume manager to create logical volumes which can span across drives and gives you a lot of flexibility.

I've watched/ read all the install tutorials I could find, but I can't seem to make them apply to both the concept in my head, or my hardware situation, so I need help.\nThe original concept I had in my head was to have two drives set up as raid1, so that if/when one fails, I can simply shut the machine down, change out the bad drive, and life goes on. And then I would back up the raid to an external hard drive. But now that I'm actually ready to install the server, I'm not sure what the right thing to do is, or how to do it. Is the OS supposed to be on the raid, or should it be on it's own physical drive? How do you back-up the OS should that drive fail? Do I even need a raid?\nI have three hard drives at my disposal: (1) 250 GB, (1) 1TB, and (1) 2TB. (I am aware the raid1 would only be 1tb should it consist of the two bigger drives).\nI currently have just under 600gb in Music, photos, home videos, and movies. \nThe hardware is: HP Compaq Elite 8300 CMT Core i7-3770 3.4GHz 3rd Gen 8GB(RAM) \nIntended Server use:\n\n\n*\n\n*Provide automated back-ups (specifically for Music, Photos, Home Videos and Movies), as well as back-up for 2 Windows 10 Machines.\n\n*Plex Media Server that will transcode Home videos, movies and (future) DVR recordings to household Rokus.\n\n*DVR: It seems in my research that MythTV is the best option. \n\n*Remote access to files, maybe \"OwnCloud\"?\n\n\nDown-time is a big deal to companies, and usually not a big deal with home servers. However, as a busy father, I don't have a lot of time to mess with computers. I want to both future-proof this server, as well as make it as easy to keep running as possible. \nI've looked into Amahi Home Server, but it doesn't seem to be well-liked. My only other option is to just use Windows 10 Pro. I don't want to do that. Will someone teach me the way? \n\nA: You can use Raid 1 for your OS and your data, but raid is not Backup. For your homeserver raid is nice but probably overkill and the second drive will add around 5 watts to your power consumption 24/7.\nMy advise is to use the 2Gb disk for your system and the 1Gb for backup.\nUse LVM for your installation so you can easily add more diskspace later.\nFor backups you can use rsnapshot.\n", "Q: 14.04.04 amd 64 installation issues Installed from usb....14.04.04-amd-64.

If I then recreate the VM from scratch and try the update again it fails to boot again. Red message about /etc/rc.local not something... flashes on screen just before boot hangs. Any ideas, fixes? This seems pretty serious to me.\n\nA: I had this issue with VMware Workstation 12 Player. The temporary fix is likely similar. I started the VM and it didn't fully complete. I thought, like you, it was the software update that did it. The only updates I had were the kernel update, so that had to be it. I fixed my issue by rebooting with the old kernel. \nThe fix requires that an ssh server be installed on the VM. Start the VM and let it get to the \"hung\" state. ssh into the machine and edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg to have it default to the old kernel (3.19.0-49 for me). You can do this by moving the menuentry for the old kernel to the top of the list. Reboot the machine with 'sudo reboot' and hope the VM reboots correctly.\n\nA: This may be a bug.....been working the snapshots in VMWare so far, but sure hope a fix comes along soon!\nAs it is I'm not updating until I know for sure it's safe.\nPost edit: I just can't keep my hands off a screwed up computer...tried a couple more times....reverted to screenshots a couple more times.....read someone booted from an older kernal using the startup screen. I thought I had tried that to no avail, but what I must have done is used the safe start screen from that older kernal and tried to repair the packages. The short story is: If you boot from an older kernal via the start menu, you're saved. \nGood luck! Hope they fix this soon! I'm not sure how I'll know when it's safe to update now!\nPS Just noticed the title of this discussion! I'm in Windows VMWare, but it looks like in this case, it doesn't matter - this being an Ubuntu problem more than a VM problem. \nPPS Also tried a repair install(NOT clean install) to no avail - so save yourself the effort - it don't work. this is highly ******!\nSo, J. Doe, what was the painful edit you made to  /boot/grub/grub.cfg to fix it? Since it was so painful, maybe you can make it so us less-talented individuals can cut and paste the edit....\nOK, so I read through  /boot/grub/grub.cfg, not that I understand it.....but do you think it would be safe, then, to simply delete the menuentry section using/referring to 4.4....that way it would proceed to just use 3.19.....??\nOn the other hand, looking at the file once more it isn't at all that clear to someone who doesn't understand the code where, exactly to begin and end the delete, so some help would be in order. Huh, huh, please? \nHERE'S AN ACTUAL ANSWER!!!:\nA temporary solution (until the bug is fixed) was to remove the version 4.2.0-30 kernel.

The command below worked for me:\nsudo apt-get --purge remove linux-image-4.2.0-30-generic linux-image-extra-4.2.0-30-generic\nYipee....that worked for me, too! \nBut that still begs the question, \"When is it safe to update?\" I guess we'll just have to pay attention to Ubuntu info..... \n", "Q: Setup apache server for labelme I need to run a apache server locally in order to use the program labelme.

I want to use a script to open a list of URLs, then create an empty text-file called \"[today's date].homework\" and then open that text file in Vim.\nHere's the script I have now:\n#!/bin/bash\n## Open firefox to the websites containing each classes' homework assignments.\nfirefox -new-window -url https://www.firsturl.com -new-tab -url https://www.secondurl.com -new-tab -url http://www.thirdurl.com -new-tab -url https://www.fourthurl.com -new-tab -url https://www.fifthurl.com\n## Set up today's date as prefix for the filename.\ntoday=`date '+%Y_%m_%d'`;\nfilename=\"~/homework/today.homework\"\n## Open the created file in Vim.\nvim ~/homework/today.homework  \n\nThe purpose of this script is to open all of the places that contain my homework assignments, then open a date-stamped file for me to manually input the day's assignments. I want to manually type the assignments rather than use curl or wget because I need to remember the assignments and typing them manually is the best way to do that. In addition, I've only been using Linux for 6 weeks and I think that automating the compilation process with those tools is a little out of my depth.\nAlso, is there a way to have it automatically run each time I log in each day?\n\nA: Your line for today= should look like this:\ntoday=$(date +%Y_%m_%d)\n\nsince today is now a variable, it would be designated with a $ leading the word like this:\necho $today\n\nwhich would give 2016_02_23 as the output.  So, the lines after using that today variable would look like this:\nfilename=\"~/homework/${today}.homework\"\n\nand\nvim \"~/homework/${today}.homework\"\n\nor since you gave filename as a variable then you could do this:\nvim \"$filename\"\n\nOr, if you want to really get creative, instead of assigning the variable first, you can just do the command itself in the filename when you're opening it all in one line:\nvim \"~/homework/$(date +%Y_%m_%d).homework\"\n\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: How do I force Chrome to open in secondary display?

By everything, I include Optimus, which is the most frustrating aspect. However, luckily with this class of hardware, there is a bios setting to activate discrete video, in which case you end up simply with a Nvidia laptop. \nIf you need the incredibly good battery life of intel-only mode, you will need Optimus working. Note that if you are prepared to live with the non-LTS releases, there are very big advances in Optimus support available in Ubuntu 17.04 and it seems to work well with Gnome and Unity, unlike 16.04 where I recommend xfce (it has an older compositor which handles Optimus better when using the xserver we are stuck with until 16.04.3). People who try to get Gnome, KDE or Unity working on anything with xserver < 1.19 will have grief if they want two external monitors and Optimus. \nI have SecureBoot off. \nI document my ongoing experience here: http://timrichardson.net/index.php/technology/linux-on-thinkpad-p50\n", "Q: Can you recover previous versions of files? I know that if I delete a file it won't actually be 'deleted' as such, just marked as 'can be overridden when needed' so that when that space is needed the file will just be overridden, and this means that after a file is deleted it is possible to recover it even though all links to it will be gone (if any of this information is incorrect please edit this question to explain it in the correct way). \nBut is the same true for files which have just been edited? Can one recover the previous version of a file if the previous version hasn't been made into a .save file or something? That is, if I edit a file and then save my changes, is there any way to recover the previous version of the file like one can do with deleted files? And if not, if one does not want anyone to be able to properly recover deleted files, should one first edit the file and replace the contents with something else?\nSo just to clarify, these are the points I want answered:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to recover the previous versions of files if no backup file has been created (such as a .save file) like one can do with actually deleted files?\n\n*Is editing a file before deleting it safer than just deleting it (that is is it safer to overwrite the entire contents of a file with other contents before deleting it)?\n\n*Finally, do tools which 'shred' files such as BleachBit just overwrite the contents of a file with other contents (such as an encrypted version of the file where the private key is deleted) before deleting it or do they use another method?\nBut please note that I am not asking about how to log file changes, I am asking this question because I want to know if editing a file before deleting it is safer than just deleting it or whether previous versions can be recovered. I am not interested in answers telling me that I should use version control systems to monitor file changes.\n\nA: If I understand what you are asking, the answer is no. If you make changes to a file, that file's data is over-written where it's at. It's not like deleting a file, which tells the system that it can overwrite this data and new data can take it's position on the hard-disk. The data is overwritten, and the previous version can no longer be recovered because (I sound repetitive now) it was already overwritten. To include a point made in the comments, it is important to note that if you edit the contents of a file and the resulting file is smaller than the original, then some of the data can still be recovered. As such, it would probably be safest to open the file in a text editor (no matter the type of file), clear out all of the contents as they are, and then sit on a key for an hour, spamming the file with a single character. Then, you can create a file of some very large size with just one character in it over and over and over. Of course, solid-state and flash memory works a bit differently, and it seems like the safest bet is to always use encryption on those types of storage.\nIf I'm close to understanding what you are asking, the answer is yes. It is safer to edit a file and and replace its current contents with random garbage, save it, and then delete it. Then, if file recovery tools are used, the recovered file will be filled with random garbage. This is, essentially, what shred does. It \"saves\" zeroes into those positions where files previously were so that if file recovery tools are used, they recover zeroed out data.\n\nA: Throwing my hat into the ring as well.  =)\nFor data destruction that is not recoverable before the file is deleted, even if the file is encrypted or not, I use an application called scrub.\nsudo apt-get install scrub\n\nThen to destroy the file before deleting would be the command:\nscrub <filename>\n\nHere is an example of an encrypted file being destroyed:\n~$ cat testfile.des3 \nSalted__�����a�C7�\"U��<���A�B-ԋ�����X�����E �5];A8���e�R�~���N��Ե��F��}Z;�_���^k`��:4��M�w�z��h3G����������+����?N(ٿ��M�_YW��CX��xi����k��ϝ#i����Q�F�����Ȃ(���Q�&;���w�o��^/\n                                    @\"�՗�RX��S੏Ͷ��*�H��-�u�6�2�>�3�m�Gz�����5���f0�D&\"$j7W���mH$�C��Q���z�Sxk��#�����Pɀ\n                                               �z�NVբ��ARQz��A�?�A���A��/��+,)��M~_��(��q����x3+y��S+�l���gT�;hl���d'�O�Z#�Գ�uHgu1.�>��e�Ⱥ����Yo��.�3$D�c؛��D Jb��#4WrQA��Rr���0�=�2i3V�F�f��K�HLUQ@ˤ'��\"�����ԣ\n3�v���v�ʝ.%&�?����ۿa��|J������1�c����N@(�r�0E6�܍����Ϫo��A���I`cj)0��3�*c`�hǬ\\�y2��x�><�������[�\nC���W�:�#�\"[�q��       #�λ$�>#x;��n�-d#K��_g@�B»h��m1���ݻ��]���gv���\n                WI�$J\n                        h���l;a�;�Y�2��3��A6��� ڜ������W���ʬ����v7�1����ȄOM~Ux�iR('��78������B�EK0׆�$~����p�f���]2������\n                                              �~����D�);�X]^�e:��B��.}&�>C{3�j�']���X���,ǣ[\\T��r�7<q#\n                              �Ħ� ��m�>��@,$/Ɂ�y�D��i��4D�����'���----\n\n~$ scrub testfile.des3 \nscrub: using NNSA NAP-14.1-C patterns\nscrub: padding testfile.des3 with 3184 bytes to fill last fs block\nscrub: scrubbing testfile.des3 4096 bytes\nscrub: random  |................................................|\nscrub: random  |................................................|\nscrub: 0x00    |................................................|\nscrub: verify  |................................................|\n\n~$ cat testfile.des3 \nSCRUBBED!--------------------\n\nSo, now if I delete the testfile.des3 all that can be recovered is a file that says SCRUBBED!--------------------\n\nA: To be able to recover a previous version of a file you can use Git, which keeps versions of the changes to the files.\nSome programs do make backups of your files, if you want to see one, just open Gedit write something on a document and save it with no extension. If you press CTRL + H on nautilus, you will see the hidden files, including a backup to the file you just created.\nBut even with the backup, you don't know if the backup version is equal to the current version or not.\nYour best bet is using some version control system like Git, which records all modifications to the file and let's you revert to the previous version.\nYou can learn git here.\nIf you just want to delete a file permanently you can use BleachBit\n\nA: Yes, it is possible to recover an overwritten file, but recovery depends on the file system and the application you're using. FAT, EXT2/3/4, NTFS all delete files by marking them deleted. (no experience with other file systems)\nWhat all well-written applications normally do nowadays is to open a temporary file, and if that is written correctly, delete the old file and rename the temp file to the new file.  That way is a program crashes while it's writing the new file, it doesn't destroy the old file. (E.G. That's how LibreOffice overwrites its files)\nSecure wipe applications normally overwrite the file, but under EXT4 and NTFS defragmentation intelligence and journalling kick in so to be absolutely, positively sure that an overwritten file is completely gone, you need to overwrite the entire free space too.\n(Even on an encrypted volume)\n", "Q: Should I run \"dpkg -i\" after running \"apt-get install -f\" in case of unmet dependencies?

If apt-get failed, then running dpkg -i isn't going to do anything useful.\nNote that you shouldn't have to do this if you have the Ubuntu Software Center installed.

Is it possible to preserve my open tabs between closing and opening of Nautilus file manager?\nPreferably even across different logouts and restarts.\n\nA: (Very) limited command line options of nautilus\nUnfortunately, nautilus does not offer command line options to read the opened directory of its windows, nor does it have any option to send an existing window to another directory. Since you cannot remember what you do not see, we are running out of options at first sight.\nHowever\nWe do have xdotool, not to do what nautilus doesn't, but to at least fake the behaviour that you describe. We can do that in such a way that \"you would believe it\" if you didn't know how it is done.\nAlthough the solution below does not survive a restart, \"remembering\" (possibly tabbed) window and all opened directories is very well possible within one session. Since you mentioned to be interested in that as a \"second choice\", here it is.\nHow it works; the process\nAlthough We cannot close a window and preserve its tabs and opened directories, we can make an existing window seemingly (and completely) disappear, with the help of xdotool. \nIf we subsequently change the behaviour of the nautilus launcher in such a way that it first looks for possible unmapped windows to remap, before opening a new one, effectively we have exactly the same behaviour as if nautilus would remember the last used window(s).\nHow to set up\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as remember.py\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport os\n\napp = \"nautilus\"\n\nwfile = os.environ[\"HOME\"]+\"/.unmapped_\"+app\n\ndef get(cmd):\n    # simply a helper function\n    return subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode(\"utf-8\").strip()\n\ndef check_windowtype(w_id):\n    # check the type of window; only unmap \"NORMAL\" windows\n    return \"_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NORMAL\" in get([\"xprop\", \"-id\", w_id])\n\ndef get_pid(app):\n    # (try to) get the pid of the application \n    try:\n        return get([\"pgrep\", app])\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        pass\n\ndef get_matches(pid):\n    # get the window list, select the valid (real) app's windows\n    ws = get([\"wmctrl\", \"-lpG\"]).splitlines()\n    matches = [w.split() for w in ws if pid in w]\n    return [w for w in matches if check_windowtype(w[0]) == True]\n\ntry:\n    # try to read the file with unmapped windows\n    wininf = [l.split() for l in open(wfile).readlines()]\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    # if there are no, unmap the current app's windows\n    filebrowserwins = get_matches(get_pid(app))\n    if filebrowserwins:\n        open(wfile, \"wt\").write((\"\\n\").join((\" \").join(l) for l in filebrowserwins))\n        for w in [w[0] for w in filebrowserwins]:\n            subprocess.Popen([\"xdotool\", \"windowunmap\", w])\n    else:\n        arg = \"--new-window\" if app == \"nautilus\" else \"\" \n        subprocess.Popen([app, arg])\nelse:\n    # re- map unmapped windows\n    for w in wininf:\n        wid = w[0]; geo = w[3:7]\n        subprocess.call([\"xdotool\", \"windowmap\", wid])\n        subprocess.Popen([\"wmctrl\", \"-ir\", wid, \"-e\", \"0,\"+(\",\").join(geo)])\n    os.remove(wfile)\n\n\n*The script needs both wmctrl and xdotool:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl xdotool\n\n\n*Copy the nautilus launcher from /usr/share/applications to ~/.local/share/applications\nfor 15.04 and later:\ncp /usr/share/applications/org.gnome.Nautilus.desktop ~/.local/share/applications\n\nfor earlier Ubuntu versions:\ncp /usr/share/applications/nautilus.desktop  ~/.local/share/applications\n\n\n*open the local copy with gedit:\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/org.gnome.Nautilus.desktop\n\n(in case of 15.04 +)\nand look for the first line, starting with Exec=.

The window(s) will vanish (seemingly close). \n\n\n*Next time when you click the launcher, the nautilus window(s) will appear exactly like the last time, even the window position(s) will be preserved.\n\nThat's it\nNote\n\n\n*\n\n*In the tests I ran, I couldn't find any downside (14.04). If you\nmight run into any, please mention!\n\n*In the How to use -section, I suggested to click on the nautilus icon to remap possible unmapped windows. The shortcut key will do the same however, so you can see what works the most convenient for you.

Wordpad included in all recent versions of Windows is able to open Unix style text files. This is not always ideal, as it is not a text editor per se, but it can be a quick and easy way to open your Unix-style text files on Windows if you have not installed additional software.\nSecond:\nInstall another text editor. If you control the box and use it regularly, this probably better. Most third party text editors will support both text styles. Two common, lightweight, and free options are Notepad2, which is a drop-in replacement for Notepad with a few extra features and Notepad++ which has a bit more features. \n\nA: Text files created on Windows machines have different line endings than files created on Linux. \n\n\n*\n\n*Windows uses carriage return and line feed (\\r\\n) \n\n*Linux uses just line feed (\\n). \n\n\nThere are a couple of methods to have it work on both ends:\n\n\n*\n\n*When copying text files you need to use a tool that supports converting text files (like \"winscp\" on Windows). \n\n*With Windows Notepad++ you can replace \\n by \\r\\n. Normal Notepad will not have this feature.\n\n*On Ubuntu you can use unix2dos testfile1.txt and dos2unix testfile2.txt to change line endings from one to the other. Also you can use the replace \\n by \\r\\n on most editors or editors will have an option to switch between the too (like Serg in comments mentioned \"nano\").\n\n", "Q: Booting network without full network configuration i wanted to setup a static-ip address for my computer  \nso i  edited /etc/network/interfaces \nauto eth0\n#iface eth0 inet dhcp\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.113\ngateway 192.168.1.255\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ndns-nameservers 127.0.1.1\n\nbut after restarting the UBUNTU 14.04 LTS \nthe network manager is stop working and cant see network manager icon \nthough connections are present in network , I can see in this window\n nm-connection-editor\n\nafter restarting i have to reset the /etc/network/interfaces file to default to make my network manager work\nwhat am i doing wrong, i want to set the static ip address permanent \nneed help\n\nA: After you edit /etc/network/interfaces, Network Manager does not manage the interface.

Yesterday I had a message that there were updates available and I upgraded.  Among the updates was kernel 4.2.0-30-generic.  It wanted to restart but I chose restart later.  This morning when I turned on the machine I went through the grub menu normally (Windows is also installed) and it booted to a black screen and stopped before the splash screen and login.  From the black screen I can't CTRLALTF1 or do anything really and there is no disk activity.  From looking at syslog, it seems that the system time was wrong, but other than that, everything seems to have loaded properly, it just never got to the login screen.  I restarted after a while and went through the grub menu to recovery mode and ran some of the diagnostics which didn't find anything except the system time.  I let it continue with normal boot and it booted fine.  Once logged in, I ran apt-get update/upgrade/autoremove/dist-upgrade/clean and rebooted.  Tried the default option and it booted to the same black screen.  Tried kernel 4.2.0-30 (upstart) which froze.  Tried 4.2.0-27-generic which boots no problem.

I removed all packages related to latest Linux kernel (3.19.0-51) since that got updated with the automatic update that messed things up.\nUse tail -n50 /var/log/apt/history.log to see what got updated (adjust -n as needed).\nThis got me to the login screen, but then I was unable to login. I checked for issues with \"Login loop\" here on askubuntu.com, but it turned out permissions were okay and the issue was not with lightdm. One of the answers pointed to an issue with graphics, so I looked around for a way to update the graphic drivers without using nvidia-current package.\nI followed instructions in this OP http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2263316 with a couple of differences; I didn't pull the latest linux kernel packages and didn't just remove nvidia drivers, I purged them (copied from the link):\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo gedit /etc/default/grub change line \"GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT...\" to \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"nouveau.blacklist=1 quiet splash nomodeset\" #(forces low-level graphics to ensure putty does not give black screen)\n\n*sudo update-grub2\n\n*sudo apt-get purge nvidia* && sudo apt-get autoremove\n\n*sudo reboot\nAfter the reboot I was able to login. I proceeded to install latest nvidia drivers from a .run file as per instructions, but that just threw me back to the login loop issue.\nI purged nvidia drivers again, and was able to log in successfully.

She is tired of it and wants me to install Ubuntu instead of it.\nI've got the image of Ubuntu on a USB stick and am trying to get the MacBook Pro to boot from it.\n\nA: I don't know how much has changed between 2008 and 2014, but I recently installed Ubuntu on a 2008 MacBook Pro and it was amazingly simple. Since Mac uses EFI boot, the machine I was working with detected my Ubuntu 15.10 drive without issue using the stock bootloader (though I had to add \"nomodeset\" to the Grub boot command or Ubuntu would hang.) Simply make free space on your disk using Mac's  a boot disk utility (or not if OSX won't even boot,) make an Ubuntu live USB and plug it in, hold the Option key while it boots, and select your drive. Once booted, install like normal.\nI did a dual boot, but if you indeed plan on completely replacing OSX, this post has instructions for rebuilding an EFI boot partition: EFI boot Ubuntu 14.04 on a Mac without rEFInd\nIf the current OSX installation runs at all (or can be fixed using recovery (command+R at boot)), it may be wise to make an OSX install disk just in case running Ubuntu turns out to be more of a fight than you want to deal with (which was my case): http://macmint.com/how-to-make-an-os-x-yosemite-install-drive/\nBest of luck!\n", "Q: How do I manually set location for redshift using the conf files?

Ubuntu has a bash (Bourne Again SHell) whereas Windows has it's proprietary shell. According to my research there is no name for the language used for shell scripting in Windows/Ubuntu. It's just called shell scripting. \nWhy do Windows & Ubuntu shells understand the same commands such as : ls, mkdir, rmdir, mount and so on?\nIs there some sort of lingua franca for shell scripting? If so, please give me more details.\n\nA: The Windows cmd.exe does not support ls, mount, etc., unless you installed these yourself and added them to the %PATH% (via Cygwin, MinGW, Subsystem for Unix-based Applications (SUA) or something else). Powershell does. And that's because Powershell has these as aliases to standard Powershell commands, so that Unix users can be more comfortable. See the list of Compatibility Aliases  in Powershell. Windows does have rmdir, mkdir, etc., but these, of course, don't support the same option syntax that you'd find on Ubuntu.\nIn Ubuntu, these have nothing to do with Bash. They are all external commands. There are standards for such utilities. POSIX is the most notable (see the list of POSIX-mandated utilities), and Linux Standard Base (LSB) is another that's important for Linux systems (which is mostly based on POSIX, but has some additions). The ones on Ubuntu are mostly provided by GNU, and GNU utilities often have more features than the base required by POSIX.\nPOSIX also defines the shell language that you mentioned (which is substantially different from the one in cmd.exe). It is derived from the Bourne shell's syntax. Bash (now you know what the Bourne again refers to), also from GNU, also adds features on top, but can behave in a POSIX-compliant manner when required. The POSIX language is what you'd expect to get with sh. bash, ksh, ash, dash, zsh all use that language, with enhancements. csh is in a (nightmare) world of its own, and tcsh enhances csh.\nTo understand a bit more, look into the history of Unix and Unix-like systems. Unix pre-dates Windows by over a decade, and these utilities first appeared in Unix. \nWindows was, at one time, POSIX-compliant, since the US government required it for OSes used by government agencies (that's when they added the Services for Unix (SFU), from which came the SUA mentioned in the first paragraph). But that requirement was scrapped, and subsequently, SUA was dropped.\nRelated:\n\n\n*\n\n*Evolution of Operating systems from Unix\n\n*Were all Unix commands re-written in Linux?\n\n*Is Linux a Unix?\n\n*What does it mean to be “sh compatible”?\n(Note the common part of these posts - they are all on Unix & Linux, and tagged history - you might find browsing through that tag very informative.)\n\nA: Simple:\nLinux is a system based on the UNIX model, as invented by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson.\nWindows/DOS is a cheap knockoff of a system called CP/M which was popular in the 1970's on those old computers you plugged on a TV, this system in turn was a cheap knockoff of the early UNIX systems from the late 60's / early 70's.\n", "Q: Problem in showing Unicode characters in Gnome Files titlebar I'm using Ubuntu 15.10 which uses Files v3.14.2 as file manager.\nThis app cannot show Persian characters in folder name on its title bar.\nOther apps (VLC ...) have no problem in similar cases.  \n\n...\n \nWhat would be the reason behind this? Is it a bug?\n\nTHE SOLUTION:\nI ran locale -a command which gave me this output:\nC\nC.UTF-8\nen_AG\nen_AG.utf8\nen_AU.utf8\nen_BW.utf8\nen_CA.utf8\nen_DK.utf8\nen_GB.utf8\nen_HK.utf8\nen_IE.utf8\nen_IN\nen_IN.utf8\nen_NG\nen_NG.utf8\nen_NZ.utf8\nen_PH.utf8\nen_SG.utf8\nen_US.utf8\nen_ZA.utf8\nen_ZM\nen_ZM.utf8\nen_ZW.utf8\nPOSIX\n\nAs it is visible, there is no Persian/Farsi locale installed on my system. So Ubuntu could not mange to show it properly.\nI went to System Setting > Language Support and activated Persian from the list. After rebooting the laptop, the problem was solved. Now in the output of locale -a command, I see two more lines:\nfa_IR\nfa_IR.utf8\n\nYet the question remains if the problem occurred because Persian language was not activated. If yes, why was I not able to see the Persian titles only in the Gnome Files and only when it was not maximized.\nDoes that mean it is a bug?\n\nA: From the first glance this can be a font issue or a locale issue.\nWhen I enlarged your first screenshot I noticed that all missing symbols have the same code in them - U+FFFD. This code belongs to Unicode replacement character, which is used to replace an incoming character whose value is unknown or unrepresentable in Unicode (this info is taken  from the Character Map). If your issue was font-related, then the missing symbols would have the different codes. That's why the locale issue is more probable cause.\nYou mentioned that the same folder name was displayed correctly when you booted the system from USB. Comparing locale settings in both systems using locale -a can point out the missing locale(s). In your case it was Farsi/Persian (fa_IR) locale which was absent in the system and adding it fixed this issue.\nWhen you maximize Gnome Files' window, its titlebar text is placed on the top panel. No wonder that it is displayed correctly, because top panel uses the same font as a breadcrumbs element (that's the trail 851 GB Volume > Downloads > ... on your screenshot) which also displayed your folder name properly. This font is defined by the setting font-setting, which affects all Desktop Interface elements. Titlebars font is defined by another setting - by titlebar-font. But in your case both of them are Ubuntu, so my idea about some broken font substitution was wrong, as Ubuntu font contains all symbols of Arabic alphabet.\nI also thought that maybe additional symbols of Persian alphabet are missing, but Arabic symbols are shown properly. But it also proved invalid, as some Arabic symbols are also broken. Moreover some Arabic symbols are always shown, but some are always missing.\n\nA: The font being used in the titlebar is missing some of the characters, so they are being shown as boxes.\nTo fix it, I would change the font.  Install unity-tweak-tool via the software center or command line\nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\nThen run it, under Appearance choose Fonts.  Window title font is the one that is missing characters.  Finding one with the characters you need will require trying different options.  You could start with setting it the same as the Default or Document font.\n", "Q: Wifi not working after installing Ubuntu 15.10 on Toshiba Satellite S50-B-15N I'm using a Toshiba Satellite S50-B-15N laptop to dual boot Windows 10 and Ubuntu.

I ran the update certs command, and it said it updated the one cert I added, but registration and wget still fails. What can I check next?\nMORE INFO: Researching the issue I came across the command \"openssl s_client -connect whateversite.com:443 -debug\". Running it with the FQDN returns \ngethostbyname failure\nconnect:errno=0\n\nWhile running with the IP address returns a lot of information that I'm not sure what to do with.

So, the machine I'm on and trying to register is using the wrong cert.

My problem was a machine-name problem. When I ran either \"hostname\" or \"hostname -f\" on the server, I got the response\nservername\n\nbut I couldn't ping that server - ping servername fails. I had to ping servername.local to get a response (notice that local is NOT a placeholder. If my server was named \"servername\", the actually thing I'm typing is ping servername.local). \nAnyway, the answer is to change servername to servername.local in all the landscape configuration files, as well as the SSL you created via those instructions. This includes the apache2 configuration files, and anywhere else in the landscape configuration files you specified the name of the server. Also, connect to servername.local from the Landscape clients.\n(Again, it's possible this is a quirk of my local network, since I am not the manager and don't quite know how names are resolved on it. In any case, I was getting very similar error messages)\n\nA: For me, the issue was using the Landscape server IP address in the landscape-client command.\nI also could not immediately use the server hostname instead of the IP since DNS was not working.\nAfter I added the Landscape server IP and hostname to /etc/hosts registration is successful.\n", "Q: How can I run a Java program in background?

The functionality you want is probably possible with the screen command.\nAs for the java app failing to run in init.d; you are not changing to the /opt/glassfish/domains/domain1/applications/AS/WEB-INF/classes folder.  You have '.' in your classpath so it matters where you run from.\nIdeally, I think you should keep the bash script and run that from init.d.  However, you could also add the full path to your init.d classpath explicitly.  Though I suspect you will need to use screen because of the inability to foreground the app.\nFor screen, this is an example of what you are looking for\n$ screen -S myScreen -d -m ./dostuff.sh\n$ screen -r myScreen\n\n\nA: fg uses job numbers, not PIDs:\nfg: fg [job_spec]\n    Move job to the foreground.\n\nThe job number is the number in brackets ([1] in this case).\nInstead of fg 10119, use either of:\nfg\nfg 1\n\nIf it is to be run in an init script, you should use screen (or tmux) if you want arbitrary users to bring it to the foreground.\n", "Q: bash: bundle: command not found I'm trying to follow this installation but get the following error:\nbash: bundle: command not found\n\nI can't seem to find what bundle is?

I am using the on-board sound hardware intel HDA (Realtek ALC887-VD) for audio output. I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\nEvery few minutes I can hear a short skip in audio playing, almost as though one frame is being dropped. It's incredibly annoying and happens regardless of the source (VLC / Spotify / Chromium browser). In the brief moment during a skip, the Sound Preferences > Output tab's list of devices gets greyed out, and the volume control indicator briefly flashes as though it is muted, before all flicking back to normal.\nALSAmixer also similarly glitches during the skips with the volume bars all disappearing for a fraction of a second.\nI've tried the following workarounds (none of which work for me):\n1) /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf: Position_fix setting\noptions snd-hda-intel model=generic position_fix=1\n\n2) PulseAudio /etc/pulse/default.pa: Turning off tsched\nload-module module-udev-detect use_ucm=0 tsched=0\n\n3) PulseAudio /etc/pulse/default.pa: Adjusting defaults (all sorts of combinations and values of the below)\ndefault-fragments = 2\ndefault-fragment-size-msec = 250\ndefault-sample-rate = 48000\nrealtime-scheduling = yes\nrealtime-priority = 5\n\n4) Reinstalling PulseAudio\n5) Upgrading the kernel to the latest stable (4.4.2)\n6) Using Jack2 instead of PulseAudio\n7) Buying a new sound card (SoundBlaster Live), which doesn't seem to work with various applications like Spotify.\nOutput of cat /proc/asound/card*/codec* | grep Codec:\n\nCodec: Intel Generic\nCodec: Realtek ALC887-VD\nCodec: Nvidia GPU 60 HDMI/DP\n\nOutput of cat /proc/asound/card*\n\n0 [HDMI           ]: HDA-Intel - HDA Intel HDMI\n                        HDA Intel HDMI at 0xf7914000 irq 33\n1 [PCH            ]: HDA-Intel - HDA Intel PCH\n                        HDA Intel PCH at 0xf7910000 irq 32\n2 [NVidia         ]: HDA-Intel - HDA NVidia\n                        HDA NVidia at 0xf7080000 irq 17\n\nIt's card #1 that I'm using.\nOutput of uname -a:\n\nLinux alnitak 4.4.2-040402-generic #201602171633 SMP Wed Feb 17 21:35:10 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\nI suspect this has something to do with the intel HDA drivers seeing as Pulse, ALSA and Jack are all affected.\nAre there any fixes I'm missing?\n\nA: The Linux device driver called snd-hda-intel has been apparently causing huge amounts of aggravation since at least November 2010 when one aggravated user wrote a PulseAudioMicrophoneGuide.pdf. \nHere is what I have figured out so far: PulseAudio is a software layer that runs on top of Alsa. Alsa is a software layer that loads a large number of driver software packages. Alsa is not just drivers for the electronic signals. Alsa loads several different little pieces of software for each electrical signal, like a mixer and like the software that reads bytes from a microphone or writes bytes to a headphone amplifier.\nMy 2015 Lenovo S21e laptop has a \"no sound from the built in microphone\" problem and as a result neither Skype or GoogleHangouts Chat works with the built in microphone. \nThe short term fix for me is to plug in a Webcam with microphone or use a Plantonics USB headset.\nHere is what I think needs to be done. I am not a C programmer (just Python, Perl and Arduino). Inside the device driver that is talking to the hardware find the location in the source code where the audio data is being copied from the microphone memory location. One of the output channels, Right or Left is being inverted somehow in the software. My guess is they did a signal inversion hoping to cancel out some kind of noise from the signal. So the trick is to figure out why the original programmer forced an inversion. If nothing else, remove the inversion and see if that makes the Right and Left Channels OK.\n\nA: Ok, I've solved it... The answer was:\n1) Buy a new sound card (in my case a Soundblaster Live)\n2) Install Jack Audio (jackd)\nsudo apt-get install jackd qjackctl\n\n3) Install the Jack-Pulseaudio bridge (pulseaudio-module-jack)\nsudo apt-get install pulseaudio-module-jack\n\n4) Fire up jack (I used qJackctl) with Soundblaster-friendly settings:\n\nDriver: alsa\nRealtime\nFrames/Period: 2048\nPeriods/Buffer: 2\nInput Device: hw:Live\nOutput Device: hw:Live\n\n5) Make sure the Jack connections are patching PulseAudio JACK Sink to System Playback\njack_connect 'PulseAudio JACK Sink:front-left' 'system:playback_1'\njack_connect 'PulseAudio JACK Sink:front-right' 'system:playback_2'\n\n6) Make sure PulseAudio is using Jack Sink as it's output\npacmd set-default-sink \"jack_out\" && pacmd set-default-source \"jack_in\"\n\n7) Restart Spotify / VLC or whatever you are using to play sound... it will work!\nIt's an absolute fudge of a workaround, but that's because the intel HDA audio drivers in Linux are shoddy as hell. The problem lies with the DMA Position Pointer reporting (a known problem: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sound/alsa/HD-Audio.txt).\nLinux audio is a mess. I've been using Ubuntu since 2010 and in the past 6 years it is the audio clusterf##k that has consistently given me the biggest headaches. PulseAudio might have a lovely desktop widget, but it causes so many problems. Jack is poorly documented and qjackctl doesn't give you much of a leg up. Only ALSA seems to behave, but alas, nobody has written a nice desktop widget nor an interface to control the programs that have binded to it.\nThe take-home messages are: \nDon't use intel HDA on-board audio if running Linux.\nLinux audio is a mess.

We have an app that is maxing out the sy cpu time, while barely touching user space. I run the same app on older hardware, with Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS and the cpu is much more balanced between user and system. I've used strace to get some performance info about the process, and I see epoll_wait taking up 98% of the system cpu time. I can't find to much information about this call, and what I do find I'm not understanding. Can anyone shed some light on this please?\n\nA: You can see where CPU is being consumed in even more detail using \"perf\":\nInstall perf:\nsudo apt-get install linux-tools-$(uname -r)\n\nNext, start the program that consumes all the CPU resources\nNext, run perf and capture all scheduling events for say 60 seconds:\nsudo perf record -a sleep 60\n\nOnce that has completed, you can get a log of all the perf events using:\nsudo perf script > perf.log\n\nand you can look at that, or better, one can interactively look at the CPU hotspots using:\nsudo perf report\n\n\nA: If you can capture the output from tracing the program using the -e epoll_wait option just to capture the epoll syscall then add that to this question we can then figure out what is happening.\nThe epoll_wait system call is basically waiting for some epoll events and a high CPU consumption on epoll_wait system calls could mean either that a provided timeout is too small and this is causing many tens of thousands of epoll_wait calls if in a loop, or that there are indeed a lot of events occurring which the epoll_wait is waiting on and the code is handling.  Alternatively, it could be a bug in the program and it is spinning on some kind of error. Typical error conditions would be EINVAL, where an invalid parameter is being passed to the system call, or EBADF where an invalid file descriptor is being used (possibly from a failed open)\nSo, strace the program again:\nstrace -f -e epoll_wait program-name >& strace.log\n\nand see what kind of epoll_wait failures are occurring (return of -1).

So, you can do that in the sudoers file:\nsudo visudo\n\nIn this file, you should see a line that looks like:\nYOURUSERNAME ALL = (ALL) ALL\n\nIf not, that's okay, don't worry about it too much. You're in the sudoers group at the group rule is in there too. In order to execute hdparm without a password, you just need to add a rule for it:\nYOURUSERNAME ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/hdparm\n\nIf that rule is at the very end, you can execute that program without a password. Yay!\nThen, just add a custom startup application in the \"Startup Applications\" menu:\nsudo hdparm -y /dev/sda\n\nBecause you don't need a password for it, it will execute just fine each time you log-in.\nIf you would like to run this script automatically when you resume from a suspend/sleep, you need to create a another script for it:\nsudo YOURTEXTEDITOR HERE /lib/systemd/system-sleep/hdparm-resume.sh\n\nAnd use the following contents:\n#!/bin/sh\ncase $1/$2 in\n  pre/*)\n    exit 0\n    ;;\n  post/*)\n    sudo hdparm -y /dev/sda\n    exit 0\n    ;;\nesac\n\nFinally, to make sure it can be executed:\nsudo chmod a+x /lib/systemd/system-sleep/hdparm-resume.sh\n\n", "Q: What's the command for terminal to find the usb information?

All the devices have a special device file under Linux ( remember Unix philosophy that says everything is a file ? It applies here the best ).  Knowing that there are files /dev/disk/by-label we could search that directory, or we could just search /dev/disk in general.  Definitely a tool that more advanced users can appreciate \n$ find -L /dev/disk/by-label/ -name \"DTSE9\" -exec readlink -e {} \\;               \n/dev/sdb1\n\nlsblk\nAlready covered by Jacob.\nmount\n$ mount | grep \"DTSE9\"                                                            \n/dev/sdb1 on /media/xieerqi/DTSE9 type vfat (rw,nosuid,nodev,uid=1000,gid=1000,shortname=mixed,dmask=0077,utf8=1,showexec,flush,uhelper=udisks2)\n\nLists all mounted filesystems.

The description from iptables man page says that, -m specifies a match to use. Does that mean \"state\" is the match? If so, how do I know the value of state? is this a constant of a variable that can be configured? \nThanks. \n\nA: That -m is a flag to indicate a loadable module is about to be implemented. \nIt will always be immediately followed by the name of the loadable module; in your case, a deprecated module called state.  Since the state module is deprecated, consider learning and using the module that replaces it called conntrack.\n", "Q: No touchpad after 15.10 software update? I'm using a Toshiba Chromebook 2 and it's been going great until a couple days ago. Software update automatically ran and I installed the new software and after rebooting my touchpad doesn't work. I've looked around online and can't seem to find a solution. I don't believe my computer is detecting it at all. I've just reinstalled 15.10 without updating but would like to be able to update without fear. Thanks in advance! \n\nA: The bug is reported here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1549354\nAs stated in the bug report, the only current fix is to use the 4.2.0-27-generic kernel.\nAs explained in this question, the easiest way to accomplish this is to hold down shift when booting and select the previous kernel in grub.\nFrom my own personal experience, I found that holding down shift on my Toshiba Chromebook 2 isn't sufficient. Instead, I have to tap it repeatedly from the moment my computer is turned on in order to be sent to the grub menu. From there, it seems like my keyboard won't respond at the grub menu half the time, so I have to hold down the power button and repeat as necessary. I've successfully gone through this annoying cycle three times in testing, so I can say that it should work for you eventually. \n(Alternatively, you could try changing the default grub selection as outlined here, but that seems like an unnecessary hassle to me, as I assume the bug will get fixed eventually.)\nIf for some reason you don't still have the 4.2.0.27 kernel, you'll need to use the command:\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-4.2.0.27-generic linux-headers-4.2.0.27-generic\n\nI'll change my answer when the bug gets fixed, but for now this is the best solution I've found.\n(Note: By confirming that the bug affects you on lauchpad, it should increase the chances of the bug getting addressed.)\n", "Q: how to install latex, nedit and xdvi packages in Ubuntu?

How to make sure that an application runs on this partition? I'm a complete newbie for this and I want some suggestions or some startup material for doing this.\n\nA: Perhaps a clue about which sort of application you had in mind might clarify, however - if you copy your application, lets call it \"app\", to the partition, and type (from a console, obviously) /mnt/ramdisk/app then it will run this particular copy.\nIf you have problems doing so, it likely means you have a security system banning you from doing this - there are several, so a bit more detail in the question will be needed! Also check that the permissions for it have 'x' set (if you do ls -l). If not, chmod +x app will fix that.\nOrdinarily, your system looks at the $PATH variable to decide which copy to run; which app will tell you which one it planned to use, echo $PATH will sort of explain why it chose that one.\nBear in mind, for benchmarking, that app may choose to use a different directory for data - depends what it is, of course. Also, multitasking systems don't lend themselves easily to simple benchmarking - do multiple runs, at least.\n", "Q: Flashplayer support needed for starsports videos I know there is a problem with flash player.

Also on miniclip I don't see the game even loading.\nWhat is the problem here?\n\nA: I guess the site you want to visit requires a current version of Flash to work.\nAs Adobe officially stopped support for the NPAPI (plug-in interface in Firefox-like browsers) Flash version on Linux at version 11, that's the latest version you can get normally for Firefox.\nHowever, there's a trick starting with Ubuntu 15.10. The Linux PPAPI (plug-in interface for Chrome-like browsers) Flash version is still getting upgraded and currently runs at version 19.\nYou can install the package browser-plugin-freshplayer-pepperflash to temporarily download the Google Chrome browser in the background, automatically extract the latest PPAPI Flash plug-in from it and installing that. It also installs a PPAPI to NPAPI wrapper which makes this latest Flash version available for Firefox-like browsers as well.\n\nHere's a list of all commands you need to run for the mentioned trick:\n\n\n*\n\n*Purge the current Flash package:\nsudo apt-get purge flashplugin-installer\n\n\n*Install the described PPAPI-to-NPAPI wrapper and the new Pepperflash plug-in extracted from Chrome:\nsudo apt-get install browser-plugin-freshplayer-pepperflash\n\nThen restart possibly running Firefox instances and visit https://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/ again to verify that you're now running a Flash version 19 or higher.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Or simply install Google Chrome browser... \n\n*or Chromium browser plus pepperflashplugin-nonfree (available since 14.04)\n\n", "Q: Problem with mpiCC I just downloaded openmpi 1.10.2 from https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.10/ and installed it on my ubuntu 14.04LTS(./configure then make all install).

I want Audacious and Transmission to autostart on the system tray when I login, If I just add them to autostart they start open and I have to close them manually. How I do that?\nI think It's clear from the question description the problem is not closing these applications to the system tray or autostarting them. I want them to automatically start as icons on my system tray when I login. \nWhy was my question marked as a duplicate of a question that isn't what I asked?\n\nA: The preferred option\nIf an application offers the option to start up in tray, no doubt that is the preferred option.\nIf not however, you either need to edit the application's code and recompile (not the most obvious option), or you need to \"repair\" the behaviour of the startup procedure. A slightly edited version of this script can do the job in that case.\nAbout this answer\nI am deliberately ignoring the line in your question:\n\"not closing these applications to the system tray\"\nSince closing the window after it came into existence, leaving the icon in tray, simply is the only option we have. Effectively you won't notice the difference however.\nExplanation\n\n*\n\n*The script starts up the application, running the command you gave as first argument.\n\n\n*Then the script checks the window list (with the help of wmctrl) for windows, with the pid of the application you started.\n\n\n*If the window appears, it is immediately closed gracefully, with the help of the wmctrl command:\n  wmctrl -ic <window_id>\n\n\n\n*The result:\n\nwithout a transmission (in this example) window at all. Obviously the image is from Unity, but it works the same on lxde.\nTo prevent an endless loop if the window might not appear for some reason, the script practices a time limit of 30 seconds for the window to appear.\nNote\nNo need to mention that the script will only startup the application in system tray if the application has a system tray icon, else it will simply close the application completely if ist only window is closed.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\nimport time\n\ncommand = sys.argv[1]\ncommand_check = command.split(\"/\")[-1]\n\nsubprocess.Popen([\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\", command])\n\nt = 1\nwhile t < 30:\n    try:\n        w_list = [l.split() for l in subprocess.check_output([\"wmctrl\", \"-lp\"]).decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()]\n        proc = subprocess.check_output([\"pgrep\", \"-f\", command_check]).decode(\"utf-8\").strip().split()\n        match = sum([[l[0] for l in w_list if p in l] for p in proc], [])\n        subprocess.Popen([\"wmctrl\", \"-ic\", match[0]])\n        break\n    except (IndexError, subprocess.CalledProcessError):\n        pass\n    t += 1\n    time.sleep(1)\n\nHow to use\n\n*\n\n*The script needs wmctrl:\n  sudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\n\n\n*Copy the script into an empty file, save it as run_intray.py\n\n\n*Test- run the script with the application as argument, e.g in the transmission example:\n  python3 /path/to/run_intray.py transmission-gtk\n\n\n\n*If all works fine, you can add it to Startup Application, but note that you most likely will have to add a small break before the command, for the desktop to build up completely first:\n  /bin/bash -c \"sleep 15 && python3 /path/to/run_intray.py transmission-gtk\"\n\n", "Q: Checking if time is between two intervals Using   \nCZ=$(date +%H%M)\nif [ 0000 < \"$CZ\" < 18000 ]\nthen\necho \"1\"\nelse\necho \"2\"\nfi\n\nIt ends with \nline 2: 1156: No such file or directory\n2\n\n(1156 is time script ran 11:56)\nThe purpose of it is to check whether my current time is between 0:00 and 18:00 in this case.\n\nA: Try this condition:  \nif [[ $CZ < 1800 && $CZ > 0000 ]]\n", "Q: How to enable nautilus to show all files on android phone connected via usb mtp? Android (4.2.2) phone (HTC Desire 310) is detected by Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS successfully. Nautilus starts automatically.\nBut only a few folders are shown. And there are missing much more folders and files. For example in the music folder only 6 directories are shown, but I know that there are more than 10 on the device.\nThe device is connected via USB over MTP. There is no choice for Mass Storage Device any more in Android (since 4.1 I think).\nDoes anyone have an idea?\n\nA: I guess it's this known issue.\nThe problem is basically that the MediaStorage cache is not updated and thus files and directories created since the last update don't show up.\nYou could try one of the steps provided in this answer:\n\n\n*\n\n*reboot the phone\n\n*Clear the \"Media Storage\" app's data\n\n*use an app like SDrescan to force an update of the MediaStorage\n\n\n\nAlternatively you could transfer the files via wifi. There may be other ways to do this but my favourite method is running an ftp server on the phone and accessing that through nautilus:\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all, you should only do this in a trusted local network (e.g. at your home)\n\n*make sure your smartphone and your PC are connected to the same local network\nSmartphone\n\n\n*\n\n*install an app like Ftp Server on your android phone and freely choose user name and password (and disable \"Anonymous user\").\n\n*start the server (by tapping the red on/off icon if you use Ftp Server)\n\n\nComputer\n\n\n*\n\n*open Nautilus on your PC and click on \"Connect to Server\" at the bottom of the list on the left\n\n*in the dialogue, enter the url that is displayed in the Ftp Server app (something like \"ftp://192.168.178.13:2221\")\n\n*when prompted, enter the user name and password you configured in the app\n\n\nYou're done! You can even bookmark that location in Nautilus. Whenever you want to transfer files, just connect smartphone and PC to your local network, start Ftp Server on the phone and click on the bookmark in Nautilus.\n", "Q: Text editor that has special characters I am looking for a text editor for any type of ubuntu, that has a wide variety of symbols or special characters that I can use in the text editor.\nThanks.\n\nA: This answer may be a bit late, but anyway. Any text editor that supports utf-8 should be able to handle any unicode character. This includes gedit, Kate and leafpad. The only exception I can think of off the top of my head is IDLE which can't display characters not found in the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane. The hard part is writing the characters if they aren't on the keyboard. One option on Ubuntu is to click the button near the top-right corner of the screen that changes the keyboard language, then click \"Character map\". You may want to resize the window slightly and then change the width of the language list though. Note that I have my keyboard set to Spanish, so where you see \"Es\" on my screenshot, it may say something different on your screen. The character map can also be launched by searching for it. Another to write characters not on your keyboard layout is to find their unicode codepoint in hexadecimal (e.g 1f337 for  or 15d for ŝ. Once you know that code, you can press control-shift-u, type the code and press space. There is of course also the option of copy-pasting characters from some document that already contains them.\nCharacter Map item selected from keyboard layout pop-up menu in the top right corner of the screen\nIt's worth noting that some keyboard layouts may be different from how they are on Windows, for example if I press a, s, d and f with the Spanish keyboard layout whilst holding down Alt Gr (that's the \"right alt key\" on English keyboards), I get æ, ß, ð and đ, even though those are not used in Spanish or in any of the Spanish regional languages. So you may want to check out some of the layouts in case one of them contains the characters you need. It's generally faster to type something than to have to find it on a list.\n", "Q: permissions, changing ownership I have a flash drive which contains recovered files from my old mac, I installed Ubuntu just to recover these files, I have no other purpose for the OS.\nThe drive shows owner \"Root\" and the files are owned by #99, so I cannot view or copy the files.\nsudo chown -R /media/(rest of path) \n\nprompts terminal to ask for my password, to which is alternately says either \"chown: missing operand after\" OR sometimes it says \"invalid username\"\nwhat am I missing\nAlso, in one instance I seem to have succeeded, in displayed messages of changing the ownership of every file in the directory, this took several minutes.

Why? Because it's a hassle to set-up my Ubuntu system as it's now.  \nI created a NTFS partition, in this case sda3 (/dev/sda3). The partition sda1 is my main Ubuntu partition.  \n \nBut when I try to boot Windows installation I come up with error (Sorry for large pictures, I'm on liveCD):  \n\n \nError says:\n\nWindows cannot be installed to this disk. The selected disk has an MBR\n  partition table. On EFI systems, Windows can only be installed to GPT\n  disk.\n\n\nA: Type of partitioning of drive is critical for Windows install. Less so for Ubuntu.\nWindows only installs to MBR(msdos) partitioned drives with BIOS.\nWindows only installs to gpt(GUID) partitioned drives with UEFI.\nFor both Ubuntu & Windows how you boot install media UEFI or BIOS is then how it installs. And always best to have all systems boot in same mode. Grub can only boot systems installed in same mode, but you can boot from UEFI boot menu if not in same boot mode.\nIf system is BIOS/MBR Windows has to have a primary NTFS formatted partition with the boot flag. Only one boot flag per device. Does not have to be sda1, but should be before the extended partition to avoid some other issues.\nNormal installs of Windows use two primary partitions, the 100MB boot, and main NTFS. But Windows will install to one NTFS primary partition.\nWith UEFI/gpt Windows requires space to install, needs several partitions. \nWindows 7 DVD is BIOS, but can be copied to flash drive and converted to UEFI boot. You have to create the default UEFI boot /EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi on Windows flash drive. Files are there just need moved to correct locations and/or renamed.\nNewer Windows is like Ubuntu installer that can be booted in either UEFI or BIOS boot mode.\n\nA: Oldfred's answer is correct. I want to add a warning, though: The Windows partitioning tools are terrible at handling extended and logical partitions. I've seen many reports of the Windows installer completely trashing such partitions. My own preferred solution to this problem is therefore:\n\n\n*\n\n*Convert the disk to GPT with gdisk. (See the gdisk documentation for details.)\n\n*Disable the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) in the firmware. This will prevent an accidental BIOS-mode boot of installation media. See my page on this subject for more details.\n\n*Install Windows in EFI mode.\n\n*Install an EFI boot loader for Linux. See my page on the subject for information on how to do this. You could do it by using Boot Repair, by booting a rEFInd USB flash drive or CD-R and then installing a rEFInd Debian package or PPA, or in other ways.\n\n\nThis solution is more difficult than getting the Windows installer to boot in BIOS mode, though, so I can't really argue with that solution if it works. Should somebody else run into this exact problem, though, I advise caution because of Windows' known flakiness with extended and logical partitions.\n\nA: This is one the first answers on google when you search this error message, so I think it's valuable to write how I solved it.\nI wanted to install Windows on existing machine with Linux installation. I shrinked current partition and created new NTFS one (using GParted Live USB). Then I created bootable USB from windows .iso file using rufus app. When I tried to install Windows on newly created partition I got the error in question.\nThe solution was to again create bootable USB from .iso file using rufus app but now choose MBR Partition Scheme. With this bootable USB I could install Windows from USB.\n\n", "Q: I have software (blender 2.76b) running as an \"executable\" from my home/documents folder. Should I move it to opt?

I am trying to create a virtual host on Apache in Ubuntu(in a virtual machine) but I cannot get it. I did a lot of configurations but any of them give me any result so I created a new virtual machine to do it from the begining. I am going to put here all the process step by step so all of you could follow what I am doing wrong. \nWhat I have\n\n\n*\n\n*VirtualBox\n\n*Ubuntu 14.04 (Virtual machine on VirtualBox)\n\n*I instaled Apache on Ubuntu (sudo apt-get install apache2)\n\n\nWhat I need\n\n\n*\n\n*When I write the url ejemplo.es on my browser the file that I created on my VirtualHost folder will be displayed and not the page that it is on www.ejemplo.es (that it is not mine).\n\n*Use hosts file on /etc folder instead of DNS configuration.\nWhat I tried\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all: change the root directory of my server\nFirst of all, what I need it is to make my root directory of my server as /var/www/extras so I created this new directory on /var/www.\nsudo mkdir /var/www/extras\n\nand create an index.html with some text on it.\nAfter creating the new directory I have to change my 000-default.conf file to change the DocumentRoot directive.\nsudo gedit /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf\n\nand change the DocumentRoot directive as follows:\nDocumentRoot /var/www/extras\n\nand after that I restart Apache to save my changes:\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\nand modify the Directory block on apache2.conf file\nsudo gedit /etc/apache2/apache2.conf\n\nfrom <Directory /var/www/html> to <Directory /var/www/extras> and restart Apache again.\n\n\n*\n\n*Second step: creating the folder and the file from the virtual host I want to create\nInside /var/www/extras directory I am going to create a new folder (ejemplo.es) which is going to be the folder of my virtual host.\nsudo mkdir /var/www/extras/ejemplo.es\n\nand inside of it an index.html file as I created for the root directory of my server with the text \"This is an example\".\nAfter that, if I go to the browser and write localhost/ejemplo.es I can see the content of the file I created in the step before. But what I want it is to access to the same content but typing ejemplo.es instead of localhost/ejemplo.es.\n\n\n*\n\n*Final step: Configurate the virtual host\nI need to create a new file on /etc/apache2/sites-available with the configuration of my virtual host.\nsudo gedit /etc/apache2/sites-available/ejemplo.es.conf\n\nwith the following configuration:\n<VirtualHost 10.0.2.15:80>\n    ServerAdmin webmaster@ejemplo.es\n    ServerName ejemplo.es\n    ServerAlias www.ejemplo.es\n    DocumentRoot /var/www/extras/ejemplo.es\n</VirtualHost>\n\nand on apache2.conf file I am going to change IncludeOptional sites-enabled/*.conf to Include sites-enabled/*.conf. (This was a prove to see if maybe my Apache did not include this folder and could be the posibility that my VirtualHost did not work for that).\nSo now I have to activate the VirtualHost I have created:\nsudo a2ensite ejemplo.es\n\nand restart Apache to save the changes I made:\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart\n\nIf I list the content of the folder /etc/apache2/sites-enabled I can see that my VirtualHost it is active now (ls command to this folder).\nTo end, I add a new line on my hosts file (sudo gedit /etc/hosts):\n10.0.2.15   ejemplo.es\n\nso now the file has three lines with IP's:\n127.0.0.1    localhost\n127.0.1.1    user\n10.0.2.15    ejemplo.es\n\nand some lines below that starts with ff00... but I think they are not relevant for my purpose.\nAnd finally I have to execute the following command to save my last changes:\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\n\nbut I get the default page of www.ejemplo.es instead the file that I put on my VirtualHost folder.\nI am sure I am doing something wrong but cannot figure out where. It is the first time I create one VirtualHost and all tutorials that I have seen had these steps so I think I am missing something.\nI expect you could follow my steps and ask if you have some doubt about the configuration that I made.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: I wanted to comment on the question for further information but I haven't had enough reputation point, so I just try answer this for you to give us little more information.\nI did the same steps as you listed above in my new VM, and it's work fine.\nI don't know exactly how you test the above domain, whether browser in your box (ubuntu - client) or in your host (which is running virtualbox). \nIf you're trying to visit the domain under client-ubuntu, you can add more IP into virtualhost tag:\n<VirtualHost ejemplo.es:80 127.0.1.100:80 192.168.1.100:80></VirtualHost>.\n\nHere 127.0.1.100 and 192.168.1.100 are example IPs that all pointing to ejemplo.es.\nIf you're trying to access from your host with IP 10.0.x.x, it may be not accessible. Especially if you didn't select the right network type for your VM. You can ping the IP first before checking the local domain work. In my case, I select the bridge connection (with copied NAT), so my VM can act just like any other physical device in my network.\nOther thing is, if you have your site which is already on-service, and you want a local environment for developing and testing, it's better to use different domain (such as: .local, .dev) instead of using same domain.\n\nA: Well kind of unclear without seeing all the configs but few things I can say \n\n\n*\n\n*First check that NamedVirtualHosting is uncommented in the ports.conf file\n\n*change the permissions just to be sure under the /var/www/\nsudo chown -R www-data.www-data /var/www/*\n\n*check if the syntax of the symbolic link in sites-enabled folder is correct or if the symbolic link is broken broken links shows in red\nthe syntax goes like this 000-default and whatever comes next goes like 001-test or 002-guest\ncheck by \nll /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/*\nCheck if the syntax of the ejemplo.es.conf is correct\nIt looks like this.

Why must partition be unmounted before using dd? For example, for copying an iso to a flash drive, we have to unmount the drive before we use dd. I've seen many places tell me to do this but never understood why?\n\nA: If you write data to the 'raw' block device while a filesystem on this device is still mounted then the kernel will have problems when updating the trashed file system.  For example, the kernel will periodically flush dirty data back to the mounted device, or may do file lookups.  If the underlying block device has been fundamentally changed then the kernel will find issues this can lead too kernel OOPs messages or even halt on BUG_ON() checks.

If you see any error, then post the error here.\nAlso, PLEASE search the forum for your problem before posting a new question.\n\nA: Using the File Manager\nFor those using a desktop version of Ubuntu, or one of its offical derivatives, the easiest and quickest way of mounting NTFS or FAT32 partitions is from the file manager: Nautilus in Ubuntu, Thunar in Xubuntu, Dolphin in Kubuntu and PCManFM in Lubuntu. Simply look in the left pane of the file manager for the partition you wish to mount and click on it - it will be mounted and its contents will show up in the main pane. Partitions show with their labels if labelled, or their size if not.\nUnless you require your Windows partition - or a NTFS/FAT32 partition for data shared with Windows - mounted every time you boot up for one of the reasons given below, mounting from the file manager in this way should suffice.\nConfiguring /etc/fstab\nPreface\nIf you require one or more of your Windows partitions mounted automatically during bootup, it is necessary to add one line to the file /etc/fstab for each partition that is to be mounted.\nManual Configuration\nFirst, you need to find the device locations of the partition(s) you wish to mount. Open a terminal and run:\nsudo blkid\n\nFor illustration purposes, an example output from a computer setup with a Vista/Ubuntu dual-boot and shared NTFS data partition is shown here:\n/dev/sda2: LABEL=\"Windows\" UUID=\"38CE9483CE943AD8\" TYPE=\"ntfs\"\n/dev/sda3: LABEL=\"Data\" UUID=\"519CB82E5888AD0F\" TYPE=\"ntfs\"\n/dev/sda5: UUID=\"00d7d951-2a35-40fd-8e5d-411bb824ff3b\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n/dev/sda6: LABEL=\"Ubuntu\" UUID=\"6044b1d0-208e-4ab3-850d-03a92e1516fc\" TYPE=\"ext4\"\n\nThe first three partitions, all NTFS, are the ones that concern us here. There are no FAT32 partitions. In this instance, all three NTFS partitions have partition labels, which makes it easier to identify the purpose of each. If your blkid output does not include partition labels, this means that the partitions do not have labels and you will have to determine which partition you wish to mount by another means. Of the three NTFS partitions, we are going to configure /etc/fstab with only the third, the Data partition. Partition /dev/sda1 is the OEM manufacturer's recovery partition and should be left unmounted, or as described below. Partition /dev/sda2 is the Windows C:\\ partition and is best not included in /etc/fstab for the reasons described above, or mounted read-only - see below.You will now need to create a mountpoint for each NTFS partition that you wish to mount by means of /etc/fstab. In our illustration we are going to add one entry only for /dev/sda3. From a terminal:\nsudo mkdir /media/Data\n\nIn this case we have created a mountpoint with the same name – Data – as the partition label. You may use (almost) any string you wish.Before editing /etc/fstab directly, it is a good idea to make a backup. From a terminal:\nsudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.orig\n\nNow open /etc/fstab in a text editor with root privileges. In Ubuntu:\ngksudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nIn Kubuntu:\nkdesudo kate /etc/fstab\n\nIn Xubuntu or Lubuntu:\ngksudo leafpad /etc/fstab\n\nFor a general-purpose read-write mount, add this line to the end of /etc/fstab:\nUUID=519CB82E5888AD0F /media/Data ntfs-3g defaults,windows_names,locale=en_US.utf8 0 0\n\nReplace the UUID with the one relevant for your partition as shown in your blkid output. 519CB82E5888AD0F will not work for you. Also, substitute your mountpoint for /media/Data. In case you have a blank space in the name of the mountpoint you want to use like New Volume instead of Data located in /media use /media/New\\040Volume. The space character is created by using \\040 in the fstab.You will also need to change the locale=en_US.utf8 option to one suitable for your location and language if you are not in the USA. You can determine your locale with this terminal command:\nlocale\n\nOr for a list of all locales available on your system:\nlocale -a\n\nNow save your edited /etc/fstab and close the text editor. The partition(s) you have configured will be mounted the next time you reboot, but to mount them now:\nsudo mount -a\n\nSource: link\n", "Q: Cannot update Ubuntu 14.04 : apt-get issues I am trying to update Ubuntu 14.04.

Thus, I reached out for help in order to see where the problem came from. I solved it by reinstalling my nVidia drivers, and going from bumblebee to prime. It worked, my computer booted faster, very well. First thing I did was however to select the Intel card as my principal graphics card.\nToday, I wanted to play some games, so I tried to revert it to the nvidia card. I got the same problem as was already described here : Can't switch anymore from Intel to NVIDIA GPU . I tried one of the solutions, it seemed to work (I was able to switch), but when I logged out, my computer just hang. I reconnected using tty2, and forced a reboot.

It is not recognized by my Windows 8.1 anymore (before my troubles on Ubuntu, I had no problem with my graphics card on Windows). Furthermore, when I installed bumblebee, it complained that I had no nVidia graphics card on my system.

Thus using the system users to perform the authentication rather than another user db.\nI could install and enable everything seamlessly. Apache2 (2.4.12-2ubuntu2\n), libapache2-mod-authnz-external (3.3.2-0.1) and pwauth (2.3.11-0.1). It's all running on my Ubuntu 15.10 Desktop edition and Linux 4.2.0-30-generic. Nothing fancy really, all standard willy repo installs.\nApache2 is running and the AuthExternal module is loaded correctly, at least as far as I can tell:\nme@bla:~$ systemctl status apache2.service | grep Active\n  Active: active (running) since Thu 2016-02-25 13:41:02 CET; 33s ago\nme@bla:~$ apache2ctl -M | grep external\n  authnz_external_module (shared)\n\nI have defined the modules to be used as well as the Derictory to which to apply the authentication in the VHost config file. See my /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf below:\n<IfModule mod_authnz_external.c>\n    AddExternalAuth pwauth /usr/sbin/pwauth\n    SetExternalAuthMethod pwauth pipe\n</IfModule>\n\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n\n    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost \n    DocumentRoot /var/www/html\n\n    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log\n    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined\n\n    <Directory /var/www/html/sec>\n        AuthType Basic\n        AuthName \"Restricted Area\"\n        AuthBasicProvider external\n        AuthExternal pwauth\n        Require user pat \n    </Directory>\n</VirtualHost>\n\nNow, when I try to open loclahost/sec in a browser I'm prompted to log in. I provide pat as a user and his password and wait for the magic to happen. Unfortunately I get a internal server error rather than the expected index.html 'Hello World'....\nSo I checked the apache2 error logs and found 'Invalid AuthExternal keyword (pwauth)' in there. After some digging I came to realize, that this error is raised by AuthExternal because it can't find the specified pwauth. So I went and checked that by running:\nsudo -u www-data which pwauth\n\nThat returned the same path as specified in the above config file, so that can be excluded....\nI then tried to redirect AuthExternal to a shell script to test the module independently of pwauth. The script simply appends a string to a files for me to see if it's being called by AuthExternal or not. I ran 'chmod u+s a+x' on the file to allow it to run with root privilege, as pwauth needs that to access passwd, and gave it another try. I also tried the same without u+s as it's not needed here but that didn't went any better. This test lead me to think, that there is something wrong with my apache2 and not pwauth.\nI tested all of that with Cromium and Firefox, not that it matters int his case, but you know... one can never be sure enough, right? I also tried all variations I could think of with respect to where I was putting the directives. All directly in the appache2.conf, the directory in appache2.conf and the module inclusion in ./conf-enable/security.conf, modules in security and directory in the vhost, etc... None of these variations helped, some made it worst though... \nI then did a lot of googling.... But I could only find information with respect to this topic from the httpd.conf era which doesn't really apply anymore. Even if it still provides some valid and useful hints... In addition, most, if not all of those threads use a .htaccess approach. Which I'm trying to avoid by using the Directory directives in order to avoid the performance lack induced by .htaccess.\nAnyhow, I'm out of ideas as of where to look or what to try. I'm turning in circles to be honest and would appreciate any hint, ideas or solutions to get me further.\n\nA: Turns out, the AddExternalAuth and SetExternalAuthMethod must be placed within the VirtualHost declaration.

Even on 15.10 it was not supported with new fglrx driver, but it was fixed by patching fglrx with a wrapper.\nTo further complicate things I have a Intel/AMD hybrid GPU setup.\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Will I be able to use proprietary drivers on 16.04(old or new ones, and how)?\n\n*Should I just use the free drivers(I mean I like Stallmans philosophy and such)?\n\n*Will I be able to play steam games with free drivers?\n\n*Will it be a big performance drop in my steam games?\n\nA: Note: All of this applies to AMD graphics cards that arent very new (including yours). Newer ones(1) have hybrid(2) amdgpu-pro drivers or open-source amdgpu drivers.\n\n\n*\n\n*It seems that no, you will not be able to use proprietary (fglrx and catalyst) drivers on 16.04. Or if then you have to somehow roll back xorg version without breaking everything connected to it.\n\n*Using free/libre (radeon) drivers is practically the only option on 16.04\n\n*In my experience, i can play all of my Steam (and other) games with radeon drivers\n\n*It really depends on the games. I just ran some benchmarks(3) from openbenchmarking.org and it seems that i have a GPU performance loss of about a quarter to a half. Playing LoL via wine is still fine for me with ~40fps. Native War Thunder is unplayable with ~4fps. Civ5 gets laggy when im not using the strategic view.\n\n\nConclusion: I suggest trying out the open-source radeon drivers especially if you have 16.04 installed already. Maybe they will be enough for you. If not, you should roll back to 14.04 (previous LTS, supported until 2019) to continue using proprietary fglrx or catalyst drivers. The thing with open-source drivers is that they will get better and better over time.\n\n(1) Listed here under \"AMD Product Compatibility\".\n(2) Mostly open-source with some binary blobs. Explained a bit here.\n(3) I have AMD Radeon HD7670M. My results are here. The one with radeon drivers is titled kde5+p+k+f+e_radeon. Not all of those benchmarks are GPU-related.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04.4 Freezing Frequently First of all I'm not an Expert in Ubuntu.\nI am using Ubuntu 14.04.4 on my Dell Inspiron 11 3147.

This kernel supports firmware version 9-12 for this adapter, but the trusty-updates package has version 13.\nSince you just did a fresh install, I suggest to download and install Ubuntu 14.04.4, that does support the wireless adapter.\nUbuntu 14.04.4 will install kernel 4.2 that supports firmware version 10-15 and you will get firmware v. 13 out-of-the-box.\nThat will be much easier than to upgrade the kernel without any internet access.\nHopefully your Ethernet adapter will work too. If this is not the case, you can ask another question regarding the Ethernet.\nFor Lenovo Yoga 700 the wireles adapter is blocked by ideapad_laptop kernel module. You can temporarily fix it by running\nsudo modprobe -r ideapad_laptop\n\nThis issue has been fixed in the last kernel update since 4.2.0-28. After you install the system and update the kernel, your wireless adapter should work.\nDo not forget to install updates for your system and you will not need to stop ideapad_laptop any more.\n", "Q: No such device after installing a ssd (Ubuntu/Win7) I'm having problems to boot into Win7 via Grub after moving my Ubuntu installation to a ssd.\nBefore I had a single hdd with Ubuntu installed on /dev/sda1 and Win7 on /dev/sda2.\nI then installed the ssd as sdb and installed Ubuntu 15.10 on it.

These are usually provided with the application if you installed it via the Software Center or apt. However, if you installed it using a different method, you most likely have to create the .desktop file yourself.\nFirst of all, you have to know the location of the executable you want to run. If you don't, but can start it by typing its name in the terminal, the command which will tell you its absolute path (e.g.which firefox).\nNow open your favorite text editor (e.g. gedit). A simple .desktop file may look like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=<application_name>\nExec=/path/to/executable\n\nReplace the name of the application and the path to the executable. Save the file as * .desktop (e.g. slic3r.desktop) to your Desktop.\nIf you want it to appear in the Dash, place a copy in\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/share/applications (visible for every user)\n\n*~/.local/share/applications (visible for your user only)\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the executable is in the $PATH variable (i.e., you can run it by typing its name in the terminal), you don't have to provide the absolute path in the .desktop file. However, I'd recommend using the absolute path.\n\n*There are also applications that provide a GUI for creating starters, for example Arronax and MenuLibre\n", "Q: Environmental variables for Anaconda I'm new to UNIX.  On my Windows work computer I have Anaconda and do a lot of Python work.  I installed Anaconda on Ubuntu 14.  I would like to type conda or activate in a terminal and have those work.  \nOn Windows, the path is modified to include anaconda/scripts.  Should I modify the path to include $home/anaconda/scripts?  If so where and how?  \nAlternatively should I define a variable like $conda which would be that path above so in a terminal I could type $conda/conda?  If so where and how?  \nMy home is encrypted.  The answer could affect all users or just me, I'm the only user anyways.  Thanks\n\nA: From the Anaconda user guide:\n\nFor example, using the environment named “research”, a user could enter the following command to update the system PATH.:\nexport PATH=/opt/anaconda/envs/research/bin:$PATH\n\nYou can add the export to the end of /home/user/.bashrc for a persistent solution.\nAlso see the Environment Variables link from @Gunnar Hjalmarsson for more info.\n", "Q: What does \"[ OK ] Reached target Network is Online.\" message on startup mean? I have noticed that when starting my installation of Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18 I get the following message:\n[ OK ] Reached target Network is Online.\n\nHowever I know for sure that my machine is not connected to the internet because I don't have Wifi and my Ethernet cable is not plugged in... So is this a bug where it thinks that it is connected to the network when it is not? Or does it simply mean that the Network Adapter is online?\nAlso, in syslog this is how the message looks:\nFeb 25 12:25:26 NowWhat systemd[1]: Reached target Network is Online.\n\n\nA: The message in syslog, systemd[1]: Reached target Network is Online is related to systemd. It simply means that the networking stack is up, that networking devices have been discovered and, if possible, a driver has been associated and that, again, if possible, an IP address assigned. \nThis does not indicate that the system is connected to the internet. That depends on, among other things, the state of the wireless switch, ethernet cable, whether networking is enabled in Network Manager, etc. \n", "Q: \"Writable\"-partition on Ubuntu Snappy Core smaller than remainder of free space on disk I have a question regarding the partitioning going on on Ubuntu Snappy Core.\nI have deployed snappy on my BeagleBoneBlack (BBB) as per the official website's instructions, (the specific instructions for the BeagleBone - fairly far down on the page).\nWhen I've written the image to my SD-card the partitioning should look like this, which it does. ~2Gb for system-a and system-b with the remainder free space allocated to the writable partition.

For example, awk is a virtual package provided by original-awk, mawk and gawk.\nTrying to install it directly yields:\nReading package lists...

Done\nPackage awk is a virtual package provided by:\n  original-awk:i386 2012-12-20-4\n  mawk:i386 1.3.3-17ubuntu2\n  gawk:i386 1:4.1.1+dfsg-1\n  original-awk 2012-12-20-4\n  mawk 1.3.3-17ubuntu2\n  gawk 1:4.1.1+dfsg-1\nYou should explicitly select one to install.\n\nE: Package 'awk' has no installation candidate\n\nHowever many virtual packages are needed as dependencies by the packages installed by default, for example awk itself is needed by base-files, which checking the APT logs is installed along with a bunch of other packages through apt-get --yes; somehow APT ends up picking one of the three automatically (I'm pretty sure that's mawk, but that's not the point of the question).\nHow does APT choose the specific package to install in this case?\n\nA: \nHow does APT choose the specific package to install in this case?\n\nAPT doesn't select a package. It tells:\n\nYou should explicitly select one to install.\n\nIf you try to manually select a package, it wouldn't be installed.\nIn the case of base-files depending on awk it is irrelevant. First, it actually PreDepends on awk, forcing dpkg to install awk before starting to install base-files; second, mawk have priority required which are installed at system installation, and apt nags you if you try to remove it. So, just don't do it.\nNow, according to sources, apt tries first of satisfying the dependency before trying with virtual packages (i.e., if depends are firefox | www-browser, checks if any of the packages are installed, then try to install firefox if neither is). If the non-virtual package isn't available, it seems to just iterate over all packages which provides the virtual package, if no other dependencies are broken. Other comments evidence of this behavior are this which leads to GrpIterator::FindPreferredPkg function.\n\nA: It is not specified in Debian Packaging Policy which specific real package is installed if there are alternative packages providing a virtual package.\nIf this is crucial for some package to depend on some specific real package, then it should be specified in Depends.\nBut if there are conflicts with one real package and another can be install providing the same virtual package, then a non-conflicting package will be installed.\nYou can check which awk is used by running\nreadlink /etc/alternatives/awk\n\n", "Q: How to undo apt-get autoremove I just walked into the trap of calling \nsudo apt-get install autoremove\n\nI did it because I was unable to install sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev because of unmet dependencies.\nNow my ros-indigo installation is broke, opencv is still not installed and I also cannot reinstall it.\nWhen trying to install it I get only \nE: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\nI fear that I'm really close to killing my entire package-dependency system. Can someone help me please?\nCan I somehow use the file /var/log/apt to reverse the step of deleting ros?\n\nA: I don't Know if there is any simpler way but if you look at /var/log/apt/history.log you can see what was removed.

The process is documented in detail here.\nHOWEVER, doing so will render Windows unbootable -- at least, unless and until its BIOS-mode boot loader is replaced with an EFI-mode boot loader. This is a moderately complex task in and of itself. If you want to pursue it, check out this blog, which describes the process in detail. Note that converting from a BIOS-mode to an EFI-mode boot requires support in your motherboard. If you're booted in BIOS mode, you really can't tell if this support is present from within Windows; you must reboot into the firmware setup utility and look for telltale options, such as just about any mention of \"EFI\" or \"UEFI\"; \"legacy-mode booting\" or a similar term; or \"Secure Boot.\" Most PCs introduced since mid-2011 support EFI. Any computer that shipped with Windows 8 pre-installed and with a Windows 8 sticker on it should use an EFI (a UEFI, in fact -- UEFI is just EFI 2.x).\nInstead of converting Windows to boot in EFI mode, you can probably either delete one of your partitions or convert one from primary to logical form, as others have suggested. My FixParts program (also part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu) can convert from primary to logical. There are constraints, but as you must resize at least one partition to install Ubuntu, these shouldn't be too onerous. You must be cautious, though -- Windows will boot only from primary partitions in BIOS mode, so you must not convert a boot partition (either your regular boot partition or an emergency boot partition).\nOne final twist: If your computer does use an EFI, using BIOS for dual-booting presents its own risks. The biggest risk is that you may accidentally install one OS in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode and the other in EFI/UEFI mode. This sort of cross-mode installation is difficult to get working. See this page of mine for details. Thus, if you find that your computer has an EFI, you might want to consider converting Windows from BIOS-mode to EFI-mode booting, even though it's likely to be the harder approach in the short term, in the interest of greater long-term flexibility and less chance of stumbling into a cross-mode boot nightmare. This is admittedly a difficult dilemma, though; the odds of encountering a complication with either path are higher than I'd like.\nAnother alternative is to install Ubuntu in a virtual machine (VMware, VirtualBox, etc.), which will bypass partitioning and boot-mode problems.\n\nA: Ubuntu works on both legacy (msdos) and UEFI (gpt) - So it you don't really want to use gpt you don't have to.\n", "Q: Missing necessary permission - live USB The computer froze during updating to Ubuntu version 15.04.

I'm not sure about the config directory location in 15.10. You can check it by analysing /var/log/Xorg.0.conf. It should contain following line:\n[   timestamp] (==) Using system config directory \"/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d\"\n\nOR\n[   timestamp] (==) Using system config directory \"/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d\"\n\nIn the latter case of course you should move your file to the /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d\nIf your log contains something like Using config file: \"/etc/X11/xorg.conf try moving the file aside (for example renaming to xorg.conf.wasgood).\nAfter X server restart you should get X windows running on intel driver, leaving your nvidia ready for CUDA magic.\n", "Q: list of all mac address i've connected to in the past i need your help please !\ni'd like to know if it's possible to see a kind of history list of all Mac address i've scanned or attempted to pentest before.\ni once tried to crack my galaxy s5 access point password and now is it possible to retrieve the mac address ?\nthank you in advance for your replies...\n\nA: Whatever access point you connect to with Network Manager , will have a settings file in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections folder.

You also need to get wpa_supplicant running as a service. You can use \"/usr/sbin/service wpa_supplicant restart\" to get the service running.  You can also install \"linssid\" to get clear information about what parameters you should use when creating the network (wpa?, encryption). All of these tools should be run from a terminal window using sudo (e.g. sudo wpa_gui, sudo linssid).\nThen, ignore all the other ways to connect the adapter, and all the notifications from other tools.

Is there some bash I could write to add this functionality?\nI am trying to go back through directory history, (more than just one directory) much like one would go through command history using the up arrow. Hopefully this clarifies that this question has not been asked before.\n\nA: Directory Stack in Bash\nThere is something know as directory stack or DIRSTACK in bash. Stack is a basic data structure in computer science, where you can store elements on top of each other(like a book stack), but access only most recent one (top).  \nHere's a small demo - each time i push something on to directory stack, my current working directory is set to that item; every time i pop - we delete the top (left-most ) item from stack, and return to next available item:\n$>  # pushd navigates to and stores the directory given\n$> pwd\n/home/xieerqi\n$> pushd bin\n~/bin ~\n$> pushd /etc\n/etc ~/bin ~\n$> # popd deletes leftmost item, returns to next directory on left$> pwd\n/etc\n$> popd\n~/bin ~\n$> pwd\n/home/xieerqi/bin\n$> \n\nThe most recent item is always stored as the top of the stack, even when you use cd\n$> dirs\n/ /etc ~\n$> cd /var\n$> dirs\n/var /etc ~\n$> \n\nThe dirs command allows us to retrieve an nth element from the stack. Using that output as argument to cd we can navigate to any directory that is on the stack, without affecting the stack itself. Notice bellow how /etc/ and ~ (stack elements 1 and 2) stay the same, even though I change my current working directory (and the top element as well)\n$> dirs\n/var /etc ~\n$> dirs +1\n/etc\n$> cd $(dirs +1)\n$> pwd\n/etc\n$> dirs\n/etc /etc ~\n\nUsing DIRSTACK behavior to simulate web browser behavior \nYou know how in a web browser if you jump from url A to url B and url C, you can kind of go back and forth between them using back and front arrow keys ?\nWell, we can do the same in bash with these two functions:\ncd()\n{\n  if [ $# -eq 0   ]; then\n       pushd \"$HOME\" > /dev/null\n  else\n       pushd \"$@\" > /dev/null\n  fi\n}\n\ncdback()\n{\n  popd > /dev/null\n  printf \"Returned to:%s\\n\" \"$( dirs +0)\"\n\n}\n\nFunctions have precedence over aliases, thus we can use that to our advantage , and make each cd call pushd on every argument it is given (and if none is given, we go back to home directory , same behavior, but it's recorded)\n$> pwd\n/home/xieerqi\n$> cd /etc\n$> cd /var\n$> cd /usr\n$> pwd\n/usr\n$> cdback\nReturned to:/var\n$> pwd\n/var\n$> cd\n$> pwd\n/home/xieerqi\n\nDirectory stack  in other shells\ncsh has its own directory stack implementation, but ksh does not. You could use  Eddie's implementation\nGoing up with a for loop\nAs for going a certain number of dirs up, you could write a function that calls cd .. certain number of times. For instance, here's my custom function in .bashrc\nfunction goUp # go up x number of dirs\n{\n  num=$1\n  while [ num -ne 0  ];do\n    cd ..\n    num=$( expr $num - 1   )\n  done\n}\n# ---\n\nSo I would call this as goUp 3 to go up 3 directories, and it would call cd .. 3 times\nUsing inode number\nThis method is good when \nThis trick is often used when the folder name has difficult character/unrecognizable character. We find the inode number of the directory you want to go to using stat and then use combination of find and cd\n$> stat $HOME/bin/sh/\n  File: ‘/home/xieerqi/bin/sh/’\n  Size: 4096        Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   directory\nDevice: 801h/2049d  Inode: 5795531     Links: 2\nAccess: (0775/drwxrwxr-x)  Uid: ( 1000/ xieerqi)   Gid: ( 1000/ xieerqi)\nAccess: 2015-08-19 15:27:38.280529273 -0600\nModify: 2016-02-20 17:03:49.822700405 -0700\nChange: 2016-02-20 17:03:49.822700405 -0700\n Birth: -\n$> cd $(find $HOME -inum 5795531 -type d 2>/dev/null)\n$> pwd\n/home/xieerqi/bin/sh\n\nOf course this might be a bit slow, because find traverses the whole directory tree recursively. \n\nA: If you're cd'd into ~/really/long/directory/name, and you want to be in just ~/really/long, you can use cd ~/really/long even if you're in a subdirectory of 'long'\nIf you've just left ~/really/long and you want to get back there, you can just do \nCd\n\nAnd then use the up arrow to to through your command history to where you used\nCd ~/really/long\n\n", "Q: HD video problem with Ubuntu 14.04 on my HTPC 720p and 1080p videos are jerky and not synchronized with the sound.

But for some reason there is some margin between the terminal and the Unity bars.\nIf I understand the man pages correctly it might have something to do with the WA: 65,24.\nCan anybody help me to fix this?\n\nA: Probably not the answer you were looking for:\nIssues with the combination of Unity and wmctrl\nThe combination of Unity and wmctrl unfortunately has a few peculiarities, of which the behaviour you describe is one.\nLooking at your output\n\n\n*\n\n*The 65,24 you mention, are the width of the Unity Launcher and the height of your panel. \n\n*In the line:\n0x03400005  0 0   24    65   1111  janw_VirtualBox unity-launcher\n\nin the output of wmctrl -lG, you can see that the Launcher is positioned at x=0, y=24, while the size of the launcher is 65 x 1111. (1111 is the height of your screen minus the height of your panel)\nStrictly, the command to place the active window in the top left corner should therefore be:\nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -e 0,65,24,1500,550\n\nand not:\nwmctrl -r :ACTIVE: -e 0,0,0,1500,550\n\nHowever, this will not solve the issue, it simply is a bug. There still will be the marge you describe. The same will happen by the way when using xdotool (not installed by default):\nxdotool windowmove \"$(xdotool getactivewindow)\"  65 24\n\nor \nxdotool windowmove \"$(xdotool getactivewindow)\"  0 0\n\nReading the output of wmctrl -dG\nLooking at the 1792x1111 in WA: 65,24 1792x1111, you can see that you have a monitor resolution of 1857 (65+1792) x 1135 (1111+24). \nIn this case, it matches exactly the values in DG: 1857x1135, since you only have one viewport (workspace): DG stands for the total size of your desktop (all viewports).\nSummarizing\nBoth wmctrl and xdotool work fine if you set a window maximized. The effect you describe will not occur. Moving or resizing windows will however leave a few pixels from both the launcher and the panel, as described in this answer.: \n\"The window to be moved/re-sized needs to be at least a few px from both the Unity launcher and the top panel.\"\nApart from what you describe, another issue you will run into if you start playing around with wmctrl and Unity is the deviation, as described in this one.\n", "Q: eclipse-installer on ubuntu 14.04 Has anybody tried to install a recent eclipse version using the eclipse-installer and not the manual installation?\nHow long does it run, it seems to take really long?\nDoes it work at all?\n\nA: I have installed Eclipse MARs via the installer only from eclipse.org\n\nYou can try this link if you have Ubuntu 64 bit\nIt's a tar.gz file(eclipse-inst-linux64.tar.gz)...takes less than 10 minutes on a decent internet connection(I have chosen the nearest mirror site)...you need to unzip it and then run the installer.

Everything works fine.\nHowever, neither GRUB, nor the option to boot into BIOS appear when I boot. I simply get a blank black screen for 5-10 seconds, and then the little \"ubuntu\" text with loading dots appear, after which I arrive in my login screen. Although this works great, I would like to change this so that GRUB and the option to boot into BIOS appear (I seem to recall that I can do this from GRUB) every time I boot. \nAnyhow, let me know if there are any solutions I can use to solve this issue!\n\nA: Disable GRUB hidden timeout.  \nOpen a terminal and execute :\nsudo apt-get install gksu  \n\ngksudo gedit /etc/default/grub  \n\nPlace a # in front of GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0.  \nSo that it reads #GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0.  \nSave the change and close the file. \nNow execute this command :\nsudo update-grub  \n\nYou should see GRUB when booting the PC now.\n\nA: Also You can define time You preffer to see GRUB loader when booting changeing from 0 to Your set in seconds. But remember to not comment this line in Your configuration file.\nBesides don't worry - BIOS is written in different type of memory than Your stored earlier Windows OS.\n\nA: In regard to seeing your BIOS boot info, you probably have the Quiet or Fast/Quick BIOS option turned ON. I had one that called this Logo or Boot Image.\nWhen you boot, quickly and repetitively hit the Del or F2 key (depends on the BIOS manufacturer, I think some use F1 as well). The BIOS screen should appear at some point.\nIn the BIOS screens, look for something like I mentioned above. The labeling changes depending on the manufacturer... Then try the usual Save & Exit. Now you should see the BIOS boot info on each reboot.\n", "Q: Running Crusader Kings II with wine, some textures are wrong I'm using wine to run Crusader Kings II, and it works pretty much perfectly, except that some of the countries on the map are the wrong color.

I have a Windows 10 (ntfs) partition on my Xubuntu 14.04 laptop. I wanted to mount it automatically at startup, readonly if necessary since most of the time there is hibernation information on it. So I added the following to my /etc/fstab:\nUUID=1AC27E82C27E6245   /media/me/DATA  ntfs    nobootwait,errors=remount-ro    0   0\n\nThen I ran:\nsudo mount -a\n\nwhich gave me:\n\nThe disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0). Metadata kept in\n  Windows cache, refused to mount. Failed to mount '/dev/sda5':\n  Operation not permitted The NTFS partition is in an unsafe state.\n  Please resume and shutdown Windows fully (no hibernation or fast\n  restarting), or mount the volume read-only with the 'ro' mount option.\n\nNothing surprising here. But since I am using the \"errors=remount-ro\" option in fstab, I would expect mount to have mounted the disk readonly after the error... Which it did not.\nIs there a reason why \"errors=remount-ro\" is ignored in this case, and the disk is not mounted readonly ? Did I misunderstand this option ?\nNote that I am not asking for an alternate solution; I just want to understand why this does not work as I expect it to.\nThanks !\n\nA: The mounting is sent to the ntfs-3g driver and that one does not support the \"errors=\" option (I would call that a compatibility bug). It only supports the \"ro\" option. That is also why you see people using /etc/rc.local or xinitrc or by adding the \"remove_hiberfile\" option so it does mount \"rw\".\n", "Q: Mount LUKS encrypted hard drive at boot (luks key stored in HOME folder which is encrypted by ecryptfs) This question is regarding the one raised at: Mount LUKS encrypted hard drive at boot\nI have added my key to home folder and all works as a charm.

However for whatever reasons we will not go with this approach. \nI have seen that one possibility would be to add the keys to keyring, however I could not find a solution which combines decryption of luks partitions at boot time using luks keys stored in keyring.\n\nA: You do not want to put your key onto a non-encrypted partition like /boot that you have mentioned. That would make encryption just useless because anybody could read the keyfile and decrypt your partition(s).\nThe solution with the USB stick is that you just insert the USB stick or any other removable media during boot, then you can remove it and store it in a safe place.\n", "Q: Making permanent modprobe changes I have a module which doesn't work unless I first unload a different module:\nmodprobe -r bdc_pci\nmodprobe facetimehd\n\nRunning these commands (sudo) works fine, and my webcam then works as expected. But now I want to make that change permanent.\nThe other posts I've seen about making modprobe changes permanent all revolve around making a new module permanent, but what I'm not sure about it how to do that while also ensuring the bdc_pci module is unloaded first. How do I do that?\n\nA: If you dont't want to load bdc_pci module add it to blacklist in:\n/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf on the end of this file like this:  \nblacklist bdc_pci    \n\n(or you can create your own file eg. blacklist-bdc_pci.conf)  \nThen in /etc/modules you can add what module you want to load, so you need to edit this file and add:\nfacetimehd\n\n\nA: It is better to create a separate conf file to blacklist a module. This way it will be easier to find or revert this setting.\nRun in terminal\nsudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-bdc_pci.conf <<< \"blacklist bdc_pci\"\n\nThat will stop bdc_pci module from loading at startup.\nTo auto load facetimehd, run:\nsudo tee -a /etc/modules <<< \"facetimehd\"\n\n", "Q: lxd: error: remote images exists as  I am using Ubuntu 15.04 desktop version.

So, the error being returned by 'lxc remote add images images.linuxcontainers.org' means that its in the 'remote list' already. This is possibly an extra step that does not have to be done.

However you could do this by using cut:\nChange the last line of your script to\nwc \"$input\" | cut -c 1-6\n\nThis will only output the first 6 characters. \n\nI believe, you better use this:\nwc \"$input\" | sed -e s/\"$input\"$//\n\nThis will remove the content of the $input variable (in your case the file name) from the output. This version ignores the output length and can deal with longer output strings as well.\n[edit]:\nExplanation of the second command:\nwc \"$input\"   #-> wc command as used before\n|             #-> redirect output of wc to the next command\nsed -e        #-> call the program \"sed\" with the following expression\ns/\"$input\"$// #-> replace everything between / 1 and 2 with everything between / 2 and 3\n              #->in this case: replace filename with nothing. The second \"$\" represents the end of the line (so the filename has to be the last element of the line)\n\n\nBy the way, there are a few other errors in your script:\necho \"Enter a file name:\\c \"  -> you don't need the \\c\nread input              \nif [ -f $input ]              -> you should always quote variables\nthen\necho \"line words chars:\\c \"\n'echo wc $input'              -> you should not use echo and '' here, if you want to execute wc\n                              -> you are missing a \"fi\"\n\nso this code should work:\necho \"Enter a file name:\"\nread input\nif [ -f \"$input\" ]\nthen\n  echo \"line words chars:\"\n  wc \"$input\"\nfi\n\n\nA: The key to this question is wc behavior with respect to a file given as argument to read its contents, and with respect to stdin stream. \nWhen wc has a file as argument, it will print that argument along with the count\n$>  wc < /etc/passwd \n  49   75 2575\n$>  cat /etc/passwd | wc                                \n     49      75    2575\n$>  wc /etc/passwd                                               \n  49   75 2575 /etc/passwd\n\nYou could always trim the output of wc FILENAME with tools like AWK, cut or grep, but that's not necessary. Speaking of AWK , one could do something like this with it:\n$> awk 'BEGIN{ print \"Enter filename:\" ; getline ; system(\"wc <\"$0)  }'        \nEnter filename:\n/etc/passwd\n  49   75 2575\n\nBut typical shell script will look like this:\n$> echo 'Give me a file' ; read LINE; echo $LINE | xargs wc                                    \nGive me a file\n/etc/passwd\n  49   75 2575 /etc/passwd\n$> echo 'Give me a file' ; read LINE; wc < \"$LINE\"                                             \nGive me a file\n/etc/passwd\n  49   75 2575\n\nBy the way, there is no need for checking if a file exists. Your shell or wc already do that:\n$> echo 'Give me a file' ; read LINE; wc < \"$LINE\"                                             \nGive me a file\nasdf\n/bin/mksh: can't open asdf: No such file or directory\n\n", "Q: Installing two linux distros with windows 10 In my internal hard drive, I have windows 10 and ubuntu 15.10 installed in dual boot mode. But whenever I am trying to install another linux distro(in my case, mint), the ubuntu boot loader fails and i have to plug in the hard drive all time for boot loader to detect all the installed OS.While installing in external hard drive, I always installed the boot loader in external hard drive. My boot mode is UEFI. Boot priority is ubuntu. How to install mint in external hard drive so that it doesn't mess with my previously installed windows 10 and ubuntu in internal hard drive ?\n\nA: Short answer: BIOSes and EFIs boot very differently. You're thinking in BIOS terms.\nLong version: In a BIOS, boot code resides in the boot sector of a disk and then in various follow-on locations. Typically, the boot loader for an OS goes on the same physical disk as the OS's main files. Therefore, you can control the boot process by plugging in one disk or another.\nUnder EFI, boot loaders are stored as ordinary files on a partition called the EFI System Partition (ESP). The ESP might or might not be on the same physical disk as the OS(es). You can also have multiple ESPs -- one per disk, two on one disk and one on another, or whatever. The computer knows which boot loader to use because that information is stored in NVRAM. If you unplug a disk, the NVRAM may be cleared of references to boot loader(s) on that disk. (This behavior is a feature of some EFIs, but not of all of them.) When you install a new OS, it will typically put its boot loader in an ESP and make it the default boot loader. Which ESP? Good question! Unless you understand and properly control the process, it might as well be random.\nGRUB adds a further twist to the picture, because it relies on a configuration file that need not be on the ESP. In the case of both Ubuntu and Mint, the GRUB configuration file goes in the Linux /boot/grub directory. If this directory is on a different physical disk than the ESP, and if you unplug that disk, GRUB will fail, presenting a grub> prompt and being generally useless. You were unclear about GRUB's failure state, but it sounds like this was it.\nUnder EFI, it's possible to change the default boot program by using a Linux program called efibootmgr -- type sudo efibootmgr to see the available boot programs (or sudo efibootmgr -v to get more details), then use the -o option to re-order them, as in sudo efibootmgr -o 3,5,0.\nPutting all of this together, chances are you wound up with Ubuntu's GRUB on an ESP on your internal disk with its configuration file on the external disk. You might have been able to correct this by using efibootmgr to switch back to Mint's GRUB -- but as Mint is basically Ubuntu with bits added, it's likely that Ubuntu's GRUB overwrote Mint's GRUB, so this might not have worked. Using Boot Repair probably restored Mint's GRUB to control of the computer and added Ubuntu to Mint's GRUB menu.\nAnother option would have been to install another boot loader that doesn't have GRUB's cross-partition dependencies. My own rEFInd is particularly useful in situations like yours, because it scans for boot loaders and kernels at every boot. Thus, if you were to install rEFInd on your internal disk's ESP, it would detect Ubuntu's kerenels if and only if your Ubuntu disk were plugged in. With that disk unplugged, the Ubuntu kernel option would disappear from the menu. (There might be a separate option for launching GRUB, which would probably have an Ubuntu icon.)\n\nA: All you have to do is to set the grub2. Below are the instructions.\nMake an ubuntu bootable usb or dvd.\nplug it and boot into it. Now enter into Try Ubuntu.\nNow open terminal and type sudo su to get root privileges.\nNow type in terminal the following line you can just copy-paste the below lines.\n\nadd-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair \n  apt-get update\n  apt-get install boot-repair \n\nand launch it by typing in terminal boot-repair\nselect the first recommended option\n", "Q: Flash and twitch.tv crashing I have recently installed Ubuntu and updated it to 14.04 LTS.

I have already Dual booted my laptop with windows 10 and Ubuntu 15.10, now I want to add windows XP, and triple boot it. How should I do it ?\n\nA: Well, there are a few different ways you can go about doing this, but the idea is to create a new partition on your primary hard drive, then install Windows XP to that partition. There are many partitioning tools, but GParted for Linux is free and works very well. There are many online resources that explain the ins and outs of GParted, so I won't provide a complete user manual here. \nThe partition you create for Windows XP should either be fat32 or NTFS. Once you have a working new partition, boot from the install disc / USB, or whatever contains your Windows XP Installation Image. When it asks you where you want to install Windows XP, select the new partition, and wait for the install to complete. \nIn theory, it should be as simple as that. Your BIOS should show as many bootable partitions as are active and available when you enter the boot device options menu. \nAlternatively, you can reinstall your Ubuntu to a bootable USB drive, then have your two Windows installs on your primary. I have never heard of anyone installing Windows on a removable USB, but I'm sure there's a way. That being said, Linux is particularly portable-drive-friendly, so if you choose to use an external / portable drive, this would probably be the best configuration. In addition, this gives you a portable OS you can take anywhere and boot on almost any machine. \nI hope this helps.\n", "Q: A few issues related to GPU Rendering with Blender As the title says, my system is pretty messed up after I tried to solve my own problems, so I'll just list them in hopes that you can solve them.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu logs out to virtual terminal tty1\n\n*Blender doesn't see my GPU.

In the UEFI firmware I disabled the secure booting and the fast booting and put in the order of booting, ubuntu first.\nThe grub booting of ubuntu shows the choice to boot with ubuntu or with the windows boot manager. So far, the dual booting seems to work well.\nBut if I boot Windows from the window booting manager in the menu of booting, when restarting the PC again the booting don't go to that menu and automatically open windows. Checking the UEFI firmware the secure booting and fast booting are kept disabled, but the order of booting move windows back to the first position. (?).\nNotice that the windows manager don't remove the grub booting manager, as if I change the order of booting in the firmware, putting again ubuntu first is the grub manager that takes control and I am able to open ubuntu again. What the booting from the windows manager do is to change the order  of booting in the firmware, placing windows first, and not removing grub.\n\nA: Can you try this.\nFor example you can boot into Windows, then type the following command in an admin command prompt:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\shimx64.efi\n\nthis is generally provided when you run boot-repair.\nBest bet for you will be within Windows try to restart with Shift button pressed and follow the options to boot into Ubuntu.\nOnce you are in Ubuntu try boot-repair\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\n", "Q: Why doesn't Ubuntu offer the same Online Accounts as Ubuntu Gnome? Recently I loaded up Ubuntu Gnome 16.04 and Ubuntu 16.04 in VM's to look at and noticed that the number of Online Accounts offered far exceeds the number offered under regular Ubuntu. Since they are both Gnome based I wondered why this is the case? \nIn particular a couple of Ubuntu Gnome accounts missing from Ubuntu caught my attention: Microsoft Exchange, Own Cloud, Media Server.\n.. So I went looking and found the Online Accounts plugins page and it seems there is only Facebook and Google supported. I can't see plugins for the other services, so I guess that means the other accounts must be specific to Gnome.\n\nA: The answer is Ubuntu does package things differently in their distro but luckily they don't remove the packages completely which means you can install any of the available Online account-plugins visible in gnome (plus others not visible) as per post from Pilot6\n\nA: Ubuntu and many other distributions make changes to what GNOME does. Ubuntu GNOME is trying to ship a more vanilla GNOME experience. However, even that project has to work around older packages in the Ubuntu repository.\nSo to answer your question, Ubuntu will modify GNOME however they see fit to provide the best fit for the Ubuntu ecosystem. The project still uses many of the GNOME programs and features in the standard release, but not everything. So there are parts of GNOME that don't come default with Ubuntu that can be added after install.\nIf you are looking for a better GNOME experience, then you should check out Fedora.

My second screen is a TV monitor, but I've attempted connecting to other monitors at work too with the same problem.\nWhen I connect the screen, ubuntu detects that it's there and lets me use it. However, the screen itself continues to say no signal and doesn't show anything at all.

What do I do?\n\nA: The issue is likely an issue on that specific mirror, or with something that's out of sync, or otherwise.  Unfortuantely, there's no way to determine the cause from here.\nThe easiest solution, which is usually the most effective, is to switch which apt mirror you use for your Debian sources - if all else fails, archive.ubuntu.com is a usable mirror, and is in fact the main mirror.  This should then resolve the situation.\nLooking more closely, it looks like there is no \"p\" folder on that specific mirror - therefore it just \"refuses\" to list the directory and file, and returns 403 by default.  My guess is an out-of-sync mirror, or an incomplete mirror.  Given this, I would not be using the ubuntu.ntc.net.np mirror for anything, especially given it is not listed as an official Ubuntu mirror.  Just use the main archives instead.\n\nA: 403 Forbidden errors seem to happen almost at random. It could be a server bug, or someone could be filtering your internet connection at any level between you and the destination server. Since I don't know your actual location or connection configuration, I have no idea what is causing this error. On this, the best advice I can offer is to try a different mirror. \nAs for the dependency error, this page- \nhttps://packages.debian.org/squeeze/phpapi-20090626\n-states that phpapi-20090626 is a 'Virtual Package.' This means that it isn't actually the name of a real package - instead, this package name is used to define a specific functionality common to a number of packages. The page also lists several packages that provide this functionality. You might try installing one or more of these listed packages, then attempting to install the .deb file again. \nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 installation fail: Starting Restore Sound Card State [fail] I have been trying to get past this for the last few days.\nOriginally I was having an issue getting past i8042 failing, but editing the kernel to nomodeset bypasses that.

It only has legacy BIOS and no UEFI. When I attempt to boot from a flash drive (I tested 2 flash drives and both worked on my desktop with UEFI) I received the error: \"Missing operating system\". I've installed it several different ways (ddrescue, Startup Disk Creator, Gnome Disk Utility, Unetbootin) and it won't work. The only thing I can get to boot is MATE and that is what is on it right now, but if I could, I'd prefer Ubuntu or Kubuntu. I've done a lot of googling and still can't seem to find the answer, so if anyone has any ideas, it would be appreciated\nEdit: \nIt seems that Ubuntu 15.10 has no legacy BIOS support? Because the result of fdisk -l labels it as an \"EFI system\". The output for the flash drive:\n`Device        Start       End   Sectors   Size Type\n /dev/sdc1      2048  15628287  15626240   7.5G EFI System`\n\nUpdate: I've made progress(?). Using the Startup Disk Creator on Ubuntu, I managed to get the following message when trying to boot: \nSYSLINUX 6.03 EDD Copyright(etc...) \nBoot error \nAnother update: I figured it out. I posted an answer down below. I can't accept it for 22 hours though.\n\nA: I can think of three likely causes of your problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*An incorrectly-prepared boot medium -- To create a bootable USB flash drive from a .iso file, a utility must be able to write an appropriate boot loader to the drive. As EFI and BIOS require different boot loaders, it's now entirely possible to create a USB drive that will boot with one type of firmware but not the other, which could explain why you can boot the disk on an EFI-based computer but not on your older BIOS-based machine. If this hypothesis is correct, using different options with your utility, or a different utility entirely, may overcome the problem. For a BIOS-based boot, I'd say that a simple dd operation is the most likely to succeed. In a working Linux installation, use sudo dd if=imagefile.iso of=/dev/sdc bs=4096 to create a bootable USB flash drive on /dev/sdc. (Of course, you should adjust both imagefile.iso and /dev/sdc to suit your source and destination. Note that the destination must be a whole-disk device like /dev/sdc, not a partition.)\n\n*A failure to use the computer's built-in boot options -- When you insert the USB drive in the computer on which you want to install Ubuntu, you must know how to get to your boot options menu. Normally this menu appears if you hit Esc, Enter, or a function key (typically F8 or above) soon after powering on. Sometimes you'll see a prompt about which key to use, but sometimes there is no prompt. In the latter case, you can guess -- try each possibility in turn. If nothing else works, you can adjust the boot order using the firmware setup utility.\n\n*An incompatible USB drive -- I've encountered some USB flash drives that fail to work as BIOS-mode boot devices, although they work fine as ordinary data drives. I don't know why this is the case. If neither of the preceding two points helps, you might try a different brand of USB flash drive.\n\n\nIf all of the preceding suggestions fail, you might try burning an optical disc, assuming your computer has an optical drive. These sometimes work more reliably than a USB flash drive.\n\nA: Ok, I solved it and here's how: \nSo basically I managed to get a Syslinux error when trying to boot instead of just a \"missing operating system\" when I used the Startup Disk creator. This obviously lead me to believe it was a problem with syslinux. I also knew that Ubuntu MATE would boot. So what I did was took two partitions on an external hard drive (you can do this with a single flash drive too) and, using the Startup Disk Creator, installed Kubuntu on one and MATE on the other. Then I went into the syslinux folder on the Kubuntu partition and copied all the .cfg files and pictures (.pcx, .jpg, .png) and put them in a folder on another hard drive. Once those were safe, I deleted the syslinux and boot folders. Then, I went to the MATE partition and copied those two folders from the MATE partition to the Kubuntu partition. Lastly, I copied the .cfg files and pictures and replaced the ones in the syslinux folder that I had just pasted on the Kubuntu partition. I got the gfxboot-com32-whatever (solution for that here) and then it booted right up!\n", "Q: Updating to and using Python 2.7.11 on Ubuntu I have a virtual machine set up running Ubuntu 14.04.4 which has Python 2.7.6 by default. I've since installed Python 2.7.11 using the instructions here, which has left me with a python installation in /usr/local/bin/ that contains a python2.7 executable. \nI've looked around for answers on this but most solutions seem to rely on the minor version being different for the two installs, 2.6 vs 2.7 for example. In this particular case both installs are 2.7.x which is making it difficult to differentiate between the two. This could hint at the need to simply update the default installation rather than installing a separate version entirely, however the articles I've read on the subject suggest otherwise.\nIf I run the following commands:\nwhich python\npython -V\nI get:\n/usr/bin/python\n2.7.6\nAnd if I run:\nwhich python2.7\npython2.7 -V\nI get:\n/usr/local/bin//python2.7\n2.7.11\nAll fine so far. However, if I now decide to install pip and then install python modules, pip and those modules will only be installed for the pre-existing version of python, not the version I installed locally.\nWith all that in mind, my question is how do I go about installing pip and any modules I need for my local version of python, and how do I tell Ubuntu I want to use my own python for development?\nAlso, I've seen some articles making heavy use of virtualenv for this, but as I'm aiming to have one virtual machine per project I'm hoping to avoid virtualenv for now, partly to simplify the process of working in the VM and partly for my own learning.\nThanks.\n\nA: I've decided to stick with the packages contained in Ubuntu.

If I have two Ubuntu versions installed in my PC, let's say: Ubuntu Studio 15.10 and Lubuntu 15.10, Can I remove one of them (whichever) without to having to format any partition?\nIs there some bash command to perform this?\nHow?\n\nA: As I know there is not a Bash command for this.\nDo you know the tool gparted? It's a graphical tool to manage your disk space. Install it in this system, that you want to keep. It's available in Ubuntu-software-center.\nWith this tool you should be able to delete partition of the other system. Don't forget to start it as root.\n\nA: The only way to actually remove an operating system is by modifying partitions. As @bodhi.zazen said, Ubuntu is not a program that can be uninstalled. That being said, deleting that Ubuntu partition will let you reclaim the space and give it to another partition.\nAlthough, if you aren't running out of space on your hard drive, there's no particular reason to delete the partition. If you do still want to delete it, you can do so via the GUI application GParted as described here or here.\n\nA: There are people way smarter than me here, but is it a dual boot situation? Like, they both are separated by a partition? If so then yes just format the partition of the OS you no longer want. Just save all your stuff first.\n", "Q: Non-sudo location for script I'm trying to convert a simple batch script into a package. According to my (limited) understanding of packaging, this would mean that I would store the script in /usr/bin. \nThe problem is, the batch script uses a different sh script stored somewhere else. The sh script cannot be run as a sudo, and the sh script needs to read/write to files in the directory of the sh script. What this means is that I need to have a location to store this script (and the files it uses) without requiring sudo. Would this be possible?\n(BTW, as the script also downloads files to the users home directory (~), I can't make someone run the script with sudo because file ownership is then incorrectly handled with the downloaded files. Unless that would be fixable.)\n\nA: Manual Execution\nYou can execute the command using bash /path/to/your.sh.  If you set the file as executable ( chmod +x /path/to/your.sh ), then you can do /path/to/your.sh and it will automatically run under bash.  You will need to make sure your script has a shebang.\n$PATH\nOverview\n\n$PATH is an environmental variable that lists all of the locations in which you would like to search for binaries when running a command.\nThis is how /usr/bin is used for binaries.\nYou can see your current $PATH by opening a terminal and running echo $PATH.\n/most/important/path:/less/important/path\n\nAs the example above reads, the paths have priorities; first searched first.  This means that if there are two versions of a binary, the one in the first path will be used.  Once a binary is found, it stops searching on other directories in your $PATH.\nIf you attempt to run banana, your computer is going to look at /most/important/path.  If it finds banana, it will run it.  If not, it will continue searching, moving on to /less/important/path.\nModification\n\nTo add directories to your user's path, you could add them to your ~/.bashrc file.  Instead of overwritting and messing up your path, you should append to it.  For example:\nexport $PATH=${PATH}:/new/less/important/directory\n\nOr you can prepend to set it as the highest-priority directory:\nexport $PATH=/new/more/important/path:${PATH}\n\nTo prevent issues, you should probably only append (first example).\n", "Q: Mac Book Pro Partition Query Right so I have a Mac Book Pro, with a 256 GB drive. I recently partitioned it so I could install Linux on it, and it's been running perfectly but now I plan on installing Ubuntu instead of my current Linux install. \nSo I've created a Ubuntu live USB, and plugging it in I get it running and I start up GParted. And this is where I am confused. \nWhen adding up the capacity of the partitions, it comes to 233 GB (as also shown in the top right of GParted, yes I know). Which is certainly less than 256..? \nAlso, it appears that my Linux install is only 10 GB with a 8 GB linux-swap and I can confirm this when running my Linux as it only has 10 GB of space. But when I created my partitions for Linux I created a 30 GB partition for it to use, and I installed it to there...? Is this why I have missing hard drive space? Where is it?\nAll in all, I would like to wipe my current Linux install and everything to do with it, and install Ubuntu without touching my Mac partitions (although maybe I should increase the size of the Ubuntu partition? Advice please.)\nAny help would be appreciated. Step by step would be helpful, as most of my knowledge is with Windows and OS X. \nAlso if it helps, I'm using rEFInd boot manager. \n\n\nA: I suggest to increase the size of the Ubuntu partition.\nYou need to right-click it and unmount first. Also you will need to turn swap off the same way with the swap partition.\nThen you will be able to reduce the size of hfs partition and expand the Ubuntu partition.\nAlso I do not think you need that big swap partition, if you do not plan to use hibernation.\nRegarding the total size, it is OK. HDDs never have the capacity that is written on the label.\n\nA: Your hard disk size is 233.76 only and not 256 GB. It's a marketing thing or they might not use the proper factor like 1K = 1024 bytes...my SSD which as per the advertisement should be 512 GB is essentially only 485 GB only.\nYou can install Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 LTS or 15.10 in less than 10 GB and it works perfectly fine. But you need more space for various applications you are going to store. It all depends on your needs.\nI will suggest your can free up some space from /dev/sda2 which is around 215 GB using gparted in Linux.

If so, how do I turn it on? \nBelow is all the steps I've taken thus far including the error message pasted at the bottom of this message\nI opened up the system settings in BIOS and under system configurations looked for an option to enable virtualization but could not find one in any of the BIOS menus.\nI downloaded \"Speccy\" by piriform to see what it could ascertain. It is saying my system both supports virtualization and that it is currently enabled.\nI then tried to confirm that the CPU was virtualization enabled with AMD virtualization technology and Microsoft Hyper-V Compatibility check Utility available from AMD support. This software is telling me that my system is not virtualization enabled contradicting the message from Speccy. \nI also tried loading the virtual machine with only 1 processor because some individuals on Super User stackexchange forums said that solved their problem but no such luck for me. \nERROR MESSAGE\nFailed to open a session for the virtual machine XXX.\n\nAMD-V is disabled in the BIOS (or by the host OS).

So how to get back to Ubuntu 15.10 without having a fresh installation?\n\nA: I had the same problem after installing Kali via Katoolin on Ubuntu 16.04 and it took me some time to figure out a solution. In my case Katoolin changed the settings in the lsb_release file. \nI could fix it with running:\nsudo -i gedit /etc/lsb-release\n\nThere I had to change the Kali settings, which do not belong there to:  \nFor 16.04:\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=16.04\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=xenial\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu Xenial Xerus\"\n\nIn case you have another distro you need to adapt the names (see Wikipedia e.g.).\nIn your case:\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=15.10\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=wily\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu Wily Werewolf\"\n\nFor 17.04:\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=17.04\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=zesty \nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 17.04\"\n\n\nThen, run the following command to update grub:\nsudo update-grub\n\nAfter doing this everything worked fine again for me.\nI hope this helps. Sorry, if the explanation is not perfect; it is my first answer here. \n\nA: Perhaps Katoolin change your user specific settings. I would try to create new user so that I will get a fresh Ubuntu home settings.

What can I do to revert changes I just made on my ubuntu 14.04 machine?\n\nA: Your problem had been caused not by Ubuntu. When you installed SSL certificate, you have only secured connection between your server and user's browser. That's only first step. Now you have to do next step - go around every single page on your site and change sourcing from (insecure) http protocol to (secure) https one. Otherwise browser on user's side \"thinks\" it fetches insecure content from sites different than your secure URL points to.\nTo do that, you have to traverse whole file/directory hierarchy of your site, and change every http:// prefix with https:// prefix. You have to split that work into two parts:\n\n\n*\n\n*In this round you have to change everything local, i.e. starting from http://worddetail.org to https://worddetail.org -- all these resources are in your domain and hence you can check whether that content is present, and what to do if it is not (e.g. when it is generated on the fly by some internal engine or script).\n\n*In this round you have to change everything remote, all other http:// prefixes with https:// prefixes. When you do this step, make sure every resource is present at new https:// address. You can do that by simply typing that new string into browser's URL field and check whether you get 404 error or something actual starts to be fetched. You can actually skip these checks with risk that some elements won't be found at new URL, and hence parts of site won't work anyway. In case when some elements are http-only, you will need to find new location at any other public service, use Google if nothing else helps.\n", "Q: Conflicting point release versions I am running Ubuntu GNOME on my desktop.

It looks like you're using an old version of npm which is no longer supported. (According to the last post in this GitHub issue ).\nI would suggest uninstalling npm completely and reinstalling the latest version.\nTo uninstall both node and npm (if npm was bundled with your node installation), try sudo apt-get remove nodejs. (To reinstall the latest versions, see MorganGalpin's answer to this Stack Overflow question)\nTo uninstall npm only, try npm rm npm -g (removes npm globally) or make uninstall in the folder where npm is installed (which npm will tell you where that is).\n", "Q: Why building of gradle can't be finished?

I recently decided to give Linux a try and after some research I decided on Ubuntu.

I looked up some fixes and tried to do them (I am 99% sure I got it all right) but nothing is working so far and I can't find any other fixes, so I decided to come here for help.

Bellow is modified demo script from what I've originally posted. Essentially , I've spawned function endless as background process, and first send -SIGSTOP and then -SIGCONT to it. The big important point here is that the background process will continue to run even if the main process exits, so in my example bellow the interrupt wouldn't stop outputting to the console, unless I issued kill 1234 form another terminal, where 1234 is the function PID reported from the script.

I created a game using pygame, and I wish to export it to a .exe file. I've used pyinstaller for this, as it is available for Ubuntu. When I run the --onefile game, it works perfectly fine (on my ubuntu computer). However, when I send it to my friend who has windows, it is NOT a Windows executable, but simply a \"file\" without any extension. He cannot run it. Renaming it Game.exe has not worked either. \nI'm out of ideas... can anyone help?\n\nA: Obviously the binary executable generated by PyInstaller on Linux only runs on Linux and not on other operating systems like Windows. The file name extension is irrelevant here.\nAccording to the PyInstall FAQ you cannot use it to cross-compile for different platforms either, but running PyInstall inside Wine is supposed to achieve what you want:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I use PyInstaller as a cross-compiler?\n\n*\n\n*Can I package Windows binaries while running under Linux?\nNo, this is not supported. Please use Wine for this, PyInstaller runs fine in Wine. You may also want to have a look at this thread in the mailinglist. In version 1.4 we had build in some support for this, but it showed to work only half. It would require some Windows system on another partition and would only work for pure Python programs. As soon as you want a decent GUI (gtk, qt, wx), you would need to install Windows libraries anyhow. So it's much easier to just use Wine.\n\nFrom what I understand, you'll need to install PyInstall inside a Wine environment like you would in Windows and then use it like you would on a native Windows system.\nPlease refer to How can I install Windows software or games? for an overview of how to get started with Wine on Ubuntu.\n\nA: You can try Python Packager \nThe git homepage gives the instruction (python 2.7):\nwget \"http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.msi\" \nwget \"http://nchc.dl.sourceforge.net/project/pywin32/pywin32/Build%20218/pywin32-218.win32-py2.7.exe\"\nbuild_environment/create.sh\nexport WINEPREFIX=/tmp/path-outputted-from-create\nwine start python-2.7.3.msi\nwine pywin32-218.win32-py2.7.exe\nbuild_environment/freeze.sh\n./package sample-application/src/main.py MySampleProgram\n\nThis will build a separate wine environment and installs Python 2.7 as mentioned.

I am sick of Windows and all their bugs and crashes..\n\nA: Unlike Windows, Linux systems generally come with all the needed drivers/modules. So it's basically plug and play: you insert something in your machine, it works.\nBut some companies like NVidia and AMD produce proprietary, optimized drivers. You can install them using Ubuntu's preinstalled \"Additional drivers\" program, search for it in the dash.\nProprietary drivers usually give more performance than their generic, open source ones, because they are made by the manufacturers themselves. But the system and your hardware should work fine without them.\n\nA: You dont need to install drivers at all as the kernel supports most hardware ; only thing you need to install on recent gpus like amd or intel are their propietary drivers wich you can easily do by looking in dash for the drivers utility and then select the propietary driver and click install.

I don't really understand the Linux display stack, so I hope it is something easy.  I don't know best how to describe my problem, so will give as many details as I can.  \nMy Linux box is a server that has PCIe 2.0, so it can't use most of the newer graphics cards.  I bought a ~$70 card, and it caused hardware faults.  So I bought an older NVidia GeForce 8400 GS.  I have a monitor connected to the prior integrated graphics device on the motherboard, and another connected to the new card. \nWhen I first turned on the server, the new card displayed a graphic startup screen with a good resolution so I thought all was good.  Then I got a GUI message box stating that Ubuntu was running in low graphics mode.  I believe I chose to continue anyway for one session.  I was able then to proceed to the graphic desktop.  I am using a Gnome Throwback (metacity) 2D desktop because the performance is so awful with the standard Ubuntu desktop.\nFrom the desktop, I went into system settings and then chose Display.  The only display that was detected was the older integrated graphics system, not the new one.  \nI next followed instructions from www howopensource com/2012/10/install-nvidia-geforce-driver-in-ubuntu-12-10-12-04-using-ppa/) to do these steps:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current nvidia-settings\n\nto install nvidia drivers.  After that, I again went into the system settings GUI, and display, and again only the old display was visible.\nI then rebooted, and now the old display is the one Ubuntu uses boot up.  The monitor connected to the new graphics card is just dark.\nSomething also seems to have broken settings because now the Gnome Throwback graphic desktop won't launch.  I appears to start loading, then gives up and takes me back to the login-in screen.  I had to change to a different desktop (LXFE if I recall correctly) to get to a desktop.\nSo reinstalled the Gnome Throwback desktop, and that seemed to restore my ability to get into that desktop, but I still am not able to see anything on the new graphics card.\nFollowing some other web pages, I did this, showing relevant output. \nlspci -v \n\n05:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GT218 [GeForce 8400 GS Rev. 3] (rev a2) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\n  Subsystem: eVga.com.

It says I am using: \nUsing NVIDIA legacy binary driver - version 304.131 from nvidia-304 (proprietary)\n\nIt has options to change to:\nUsing NVIDIA binary driver - version 340.96 from nvidia-340 (proprietary)\n\nor\nUsing NVIDIA binary driver - version 340.96 from nvidia-340-updates (proprietary)\n\nI thought this might be a great way to switch drivers.  So I chose the first option, and clicked [apply].  It displayed \"applying changes\" and started a progress bar that did not move despite waiting many minutes. So I clicked [Cancel]\nI decided that since this link (www nvidia com/download/driverResults.aspx/95164/en-us) link connects to the same version 340.96, that I would get the drivers directly from NVIDIA after using their search engine to enter in my exact card.  \n...\nI downloaded the driver and ran it as root.  It told me that I had to exit my X-server first, and to read the README from the NVIDIA website.  So I read it from here: us download nvidia com/XFree86/Linux-x86/340.96/README/index.html .. Holy cow!, now I am terrified to install the driver.  It describes compiling modules for the kernel, and maybe they will have to be cryptographically signed, and I have to have the proper versions of libraries, such as glibc (which I can't find in my system).....\nDang it, I give up...  \n\nA: 8xxx series cards only work with 340.96 or lower version of nvidia drivers. To check what version is installed type: \nnvidia-smi\n\nIf the driver is above 340.96, try to install an older driver.

I've found my answer on how to make it work:\nOriginal issue\nThe proposed solution suggested to install experimental libraries on my Ubuntu 15.10. It really resolved my issue and I could see my scanner, but unfortunately TeamViewer 11 required libjpeg62 (the original library). After I reinstalled TeamViewer, it \"fixed\" some of the libraries it needed, but then my Simple Scan and Xsane apps are gone.\nOutput from my \"apt-get autoremove;apt-get autoclean\":\n\nThe following packages will be REMOVED:\n  argyll argyll-ref gnome-control-center-data \n  gnome-settings-daemon   libcolord-gtk1 libgoa-backend-1.0-1 \n  xsane-common\n\nDebian Expirimental - Libs\n\n\n*\n\n*libjpeg62-turbo\nVersion: 1:1.4.80-115-gfb907b2-1\n\n*libsane-common \nVersion: 1.0.26~git20151121-1\n\n*libsane\nVersion: 1.0.26~git20151121-1\nWhen I try to install Simple Scan, the following error appears:\n\nsimple-scan: Depends: zlib1g (>= 1:1.1.4) but 1:1.2.8.dfsg-2ubuntu4 is\n  to be installed\n\nSimilar message appears when trying to install Xsane:\n\nxsane: Depends: xsane-common (= 0.998-6ubuntu1) but 0.998-6ubuntu1 is\n  to be installed\n   Depends: libc6 (>= 2.14) but 2.21-0ubuntu4.1 is to be installed\n   Depends: libgimp2.0 (>= 2.4.0) but 2.8.14-1ubuntu2 is to be installed\n   Depends: libglib2.0-0 (>= 2.12.0) but 2.46.1-1 is to be installed\n   Depends: libgtk2.0-0 (>= 2.14.0) but 2.24.28-1ubuntu1.1 is to be installed\n   Depends: libjpeg8 (>= 8c) but 8c-2ubuntu8 is to be installed\n   Depends: libpng12-0 (>= 1.2.13-4) but 1.2.51-0ubuntu3.15.10.2 is to be installed\n   Depends: libsane (>= 1.0.11-3) but 1.0.25+git20150528-1ubuntu2 is to be installed\n   Depends: libtiff5 (>= 4.0.3) but 4.0.3-12.3ubuntu2 is to be installed\n   Depends: zlib1g (>= 1:1.1.4) but 1:1.2.8.dfsg-2ubuntu4 is to be installed\n\n\nQUESTIONS:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to make my TeamViewer work as well as Simple Scan and\nXsane?\n\n*How could I fix the issue with my libraries?\n\n\nA: I believe I found a way in order to answer my own questions:\n1) It appears I can't have both - experimental and buggy stable version of those libraries.

I'm pretty sure you typed the command wrong. It's sudo apt-get install telegram-desktop, not sudo apt-get install telegramm desktop.

However, after choosing to run Ubuntu as my OS, every time I restart the computer, the rEFit menu is skipped and I am taken straight to a GRUB menu where I can choose from Ubuntu, OSX 32bit or OSX 64bit. But when I choose either of the OSX's I am led to a screen (awful awful image of screen) which I cannot leave. Is there any way of returning to the rEFit menu and selecting OSX as my OS? I can boot Ubuntu no problem and I was running Mountain Lion if this helps.\nThanks a bunch,\nSam\n\nA: WayToDoor's answer is correct as far as it goes, but there are other options, too....\nFirst, be aware that rEFIt is abandonware; it hasn't been updated since 2010, and it requires increasing numbers of tweaks to work with recent versions of OS X. In 2012, though, I forked rEFIt into a new project, rEFInd. This version is still under development. It also adds many new features, including some that are relevant for repairing your current problem. Namely, you can install rEFInd in Ubuntu by using a Debian package or PPA (see its downloads page for details). This isn't really the ideal way to install on a Mac, since their EFIs are strange and may not respond quite properly to the way Linux manages them. OTOH, in tests I've done recently on both an old 32-bit Mac Mini and a new (bought in late 2014) MacBook Air, installing rEFInd from Ubuntu has worked. Alternatively, you could boot into OS X as WayToDoor suggests and then install rEFInd instead of re-installing rEFIt.\nAnother possibility is to adjust GRUB so that it boots OS X. In theory it should be able to do so, but I can't say what's wrong without seeing the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file and knowing something about your partitions. If you want to pursue this possibility, run the Boot Info Script. This should generate a file called RESULTS.txt. Post it to a pastebin site and post the URL to your document here. Inform My GRUB configuration skills aren't the best, but I may be able to at least offer suggestions once I see what your current configuration is.\n\nA: Macs have an integrated boot menu on their EFI software. You can access it and choose where you want to boot, at the EFI level, witch is the same thing that rEFIt do. However, as I can't read what's written on your screen, it won't help if, during the install of ubuntu, the installer overwritten some files in the os x partition.\nTo access the bootmenu, press Option ⌥ (ALT) on startup. Apple have a good help page on what keys you can press on boot, and what they do. I suggest you take a look Apple list of statup keys. \nIf you boot successfully into os x, just reinstall rEFIt.\nIf you have trouble getting into, the same help page show how to access the recovery partition, that will help you in reinstalling os x : use Command (⌘)-R to boot locally or use Command-Option-R to boot to recorvery over the internet. \n", "Q: How to move \"home\" to a separate partition in recovery mode? I accidentally screwed my system so I only am able to boot in the repair mode. Anyway, I want to reinstall it (upgrade to 15.10, if that matters). So I want to save my \"home\" directory. I have access to \"home\" via the recovery mode, I've checked that. \nHow can I move my existing \"home\" directory to a separate partition to save data?  And how can I create a new partition? I figure I'll have to resize the existing one but how exactly?\n\nA: The safe way\nBack up your HOME to an external drive by copying its content while in recovery mode. After booting to a root shell or (recommended) after booting your computer with a live system from CD or USB using the 15.10 installation medium we have to mount the external drive. From the live system \"Try out Ubuntu\" we can simply mount it using Nautilus. From the command line in a root shell we can mount it from the command line as was further elaborated here:\nHow to access a usb flash drive from the terminal? (How can I mount a flash drive manually?)\nAfter the external drive was mounted just copy your HOME with\n# cp -av /home /mnt/usb\n\nWe can then simply restore the backup to a newly created Ubuntu.\nThis is the recommended way, as in all cases below there is an inherent risk to lose your data if something went wrong on partitioning your drive.\nPartition while installing\nAfter we had made a backup of our data we can create new partitions on installing Ubuntu when running GParted on choosing \"Try out Ubuntu\" prior to the installation. This will give you an option to shrink the existing partition where your HOME resides to give space for an additional partition. On installing by choosing \"Someting else\" take care to not format the existing partition where your HOME resides for later use.\nMove home\nShrinking partitions can only be done when the drive was not mounted. This can not be done from a root shell you had booted from the same drive. You will also need to boot to a live system (see above).\nAfter we had created a new partition we can move the HOME from the command line, which could also be a root shell, as was elaborated here:\nMove home folder to second drive\nBut this may be a rather inconvenient way as compared to just skipping the partitioning of the partition that holds the old HOME.\nRe-install without deleting HOME\nOf course we can also re-install Ubuntu on the exiting partition without removing data from our previous HOME by choosing \"Upgrade Ubuntu xxx to Ubuntu xxx\".\n", "Q: Make Ubuntu remember screen brightness level without xbacklight The problem is that Ubuntu always resets the brightness level to maximum after every reboot.

How exactly can I do that? Here's some\n  information:\n\nIntroduction\nThe script below addresses OP's need to store and restore screen brightness that was used last.  It works in conjunction with the lightdm greeter and is activated by lightdm. There's no requirement to use lightdm, so if you prefer to use a cron job, you can do so. \nBasic idea: \n\n\n*\n\n*Have the script stored somewhere (either by getting it here or through github) \n\n*Create /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf using the sudo privilege. \n\n*Make sure that file has 3 lines: [SeatDefaults] , display-setup-script, and display-stopped script.

Next, we need to set it up to work with lightdm. Create the /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf file , either by opening it with command line nano text editor (the command is sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf ) or graphical gedit ( pkexec gedit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf )\nWrite to that file the following lines:\n[SeatDefaults]\n#display-setup-script = Script to run when starting a greeter session (runs as root)\ndisplay-setup-script = /opt/sergrep/brightness.sh restore\n#display-stopped-script = Script to run after stopping the display server (runs as root)\ndisplay-stopped-script = /opt/sergrep/brightness.sh store\n\nSave and exit\nIndepth Overview\nYou've already discovered that you can write to /sys/class/backlight/*/brightness file directly , and you can also read in those values as well. Problem is that /sys is a virtual filesystem, so once you reboot, all the files in that filesystem disappear. \nSo you could store value in /sys/class/backlight/*/actual_brightness into a permanent file on every reboot. The question is how - via cron job, via lightdm, or via other means. Personally, I chose the lightdm route.\nBasically we take advantage of lightdm's feature - being able to run a script before the greeter starts and after the session exits. The brightness is recorded to /opt/.last_brightness file and read from each time the script starts. We're essentially performing two actions with the same script, just by passing different arguments.\n\nA: Have you tried this:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo nano /etc/rc.local\n\n*add this line to the file (substitute X with the desired level of brightness): \necho X > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\n\nA: Alright. I'm going to answer my own question just for future reference. In my case, what I did is add the following lines (it's really just one line with a bunch of comments to remind me why and what I did there) to /etc/rc.local before exit 0:\n# The following line should solve the problem of Ubuntu resetting\n# the brightness level back to maximum after every reboot.\n\necho 50 > /sys/class/backlight/radeon_bl0/brightness\n\nThis is what the entire file looks like now:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing.\n\n# The following line should solve the problem of Ubuntu resetting\n# the brightness level back to maximum after every reboot.\necho 50 > /sys/class/backlight/radeon_bl0/brightness\n\nexit 0\n\nAlthough I'm not one hundred percent sure if this is the best way to do it, everything seems to be working just fine for me now.\n\nA: If you are able to set the brightness with a command, making the brightness level change to a particular value at startup is easy. Do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Dash by pressing Super/Windows key\n\n*Enter \"Startup Applications\" and press enter\n\n*Click \"Add\"\n\n*Enter a name (irrelevant) and the command \n\n*Click \"Add\"\n\n\nThis should execute that command on startup. I am unsure of how to make it remember the previous brightness, but I hope this helps.\n\nA: Just use light instead...\nOtherwise it is a mess to fix it, especially if you have intel and nvidia graphics together!\nThis Works on Ubuntu 16.04... and is tested on Alienware M14XR2\nCheckout->https://github.com/haikarainen/light\n", "Q: I need help getting the \"Text Entry\" notification bar icon back (the one that changes keyboard input method) The Text Entry selection button (i.e. the button that swaps between language keyboard input types) on the top menu bar is missing.

In order to build a snap for x86 it needs to be run on an x86 host; for arm, an arm host.\nIndeed, as mentioned by didrocks, you can run Snapcraft directly on the Snappy device by using the Classic Dimension on Ubuntu Core 16.04.\n\nA: Note also that Snappy Ubuntu Core 16.04 (still in development) have a classic dimension which enables you to directly build on the device, so you won't have cross-arch issues anymore with this.\n\nA: You can also install docker app, and import from ubuntu image from docker hub, then you will have the environement for native compile. \n", "Q: How can I rebuild the faac package to get mp4/m4a support and higher bitrates?

I can't format it or delete its partitions. I was wondering if anyone knows of a way to fix this. In the fdisk screenshot the size of the partitions and the sectors seemed really unusual so i included a screenshot.\n\n\n\nA: try mounting with read write options \nsudo mount -t ntfs -o rw /dev/sdb1 /mnt\n\nthen try accessing it if doesn't work which is more likely cause i think you may have tried these obvious stuff then that unalloccated is weird just make a backup of all data , delete the partition from gparted ,delete the partition table just to be safe recreate a partition table and create an new healthy partition\nif none of these works then just bring out the legendary pokemon,the last resort which is a little slow but always works \"ONLY DO IT AS LAST RESORT\"\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb\n\nthis will fill the whole thing with zeros any corruption will be overwritten\n. Good Luck\n\nA: A few observations:\n\n*\n\n*As others have mentioned, you need to unmount the partition before you can edit the partition table.\n\n\n*You need to run fdisk on the raw device and not a partition.  i.e.:\nfdisk /dev/sdb\n\nThe correct partition table should then be visible.\n\n\n*To actually attempt to fix the filesystem run:\nfsck /dev/sdb1\n\n\n\n*If all else fails, try mounting the disk on a Windows machine.  This may repair any filesystem damage.  (It might also end up wiping the disk; Windows has a nasty tendency to break things.)\nThe reason this might work is that the Linux NTFS drivers are quite conservative about repairing filesystem damage and won't attempt a repair if they're not 100% sure the operation is safe (the driver docs specifically mention this but I don't have a reference readily at hand).\n", "Q: bash: /etc/bash.bashrc: line 122: syntax error: unexpected end of file # System-wide .bashrc file for interactive bash(1) shells.\n\n# To enable the settings / commands in this file for login shells as well,\n# this file has to be sourced in /etc/profile.\n# If not running interactively, don't do anything\n  if [ -z \"$PS1\" ] && return\n\n# check the window size after each command and, if necessary,\n# update the values of LINES and COLUMNS.\nshopt -s checkwinsize\n\n# set variable identifying the chroot you work in (used in the prompt below)\nif [ -z \"$debian_chroot\" ] && [ -r /etc/debian_chroot ]; then\n    debian_chroot=$(cat /etc/debian_chroot)\nfi\n\n\n# set a fancy prompt (non-color, overwrite the one in /etc/profile)\nPS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h:\\w\\$ '\n\nuse_color=true\n\n# Set colorful PS1 only on colorful terminals.\n# dircolors --print-database uses its own built-in database\n# instead of using /etc/DIR_COLORS.

Want to reinstall this is a Ubuntu-only machine.  No Windows, no dual boot.  It's a Dell, with UEFI boot protocol (Inspiron 5559).\nI wrecked my 14.04 installation by trying to upgrade the kernel (following instructions at https://websetnet.com/install-linux-kernel-45-rc-3-ubuntu-1504-ubuntu-1404/). The advice was followed because I have no sound and they said I needed a newer kernel.\nThe command to remove the newer kernel failed.  \nAnyway, I now have a machine which sometimes refuses to boot, and sometimes can be persuaded to boot to the older kernel in recovery mode. It's effectively useless.\nMore than anything, I would like to remove the entire installation and reinstall from scratch, but I can't.

I think this happened because I'd done something unspeakable to the boot files:  reason I believe this is because Ubuntu told me there was no operating system, so I must have done something to remove some crucial part of it.\nSo, at this point in the tale, I'd done everything I shouldn't have. Once Ubuntu booted, it all got a lot easier.\nRemember, I followed instructions to update the kernel because I wanted sound. Well, Ubuntu 15.10 (on the flash drive) solved that problem, so I'm a happy bunny.\nTook 3 evenings to restore everything else, but now I have a laptop where sound and the HDMI port both work, so I can stream online TV catch-up programmes.\nAll good, thanks to all who took the trouble to contribute.\nJM\n", "Q: Problem after ubuntu installation I had a Windows installed on ssd - everything was fine.

Here's my recommendation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager. (Download links for both formats exist on that page.)\n\n*Prepare a boot medium from what you download.\n\n*Boot to the rEFInd medium. With any luck, it will show options for booting both Windows and Ubuntu. If you don't see an Ubuntu option that shows vmlinuz as part of the description, hit the Esc key.\n\n*Test the Windows option, and then the Ubuntu option. Note that there may be two Ubuntu options, and perhaps other strays. It's important only that you can get into each OS, not that all the options work.\n\n*If you can boot both Windows and Ubuntu, then boot to Ubuntu and install the rEFInd PPA or Debian package.\n\n\nAt this point, rEFInd should take over as your default boot manager, and you should be able to boot both OSes. If there are redundant or non-functional options in the rEFInd menu, you can clean them up, as described here.\nIt may also be possible to fix the problem with Boot Repair, but you'd end up with a system that would become harder to boot whenever you unplug your external disk. In this case, rEFInd is a superior solution, because if you unplug the external disk, the direct-kernel boot bath in rEFInd will disappear, leaving Windows still bootable.\n", "Q: Error in setting wlan sensitivity I use public wifi in an institute and they have got multiple routers with the same SSID spread throughout the campus.

My understanding of this question is this:\n\"How can I take reasonable steps to protect my files from prying eyes that are not necessarily experience hackers. i.e., how do I keep my private stuff private form casual inspection.\"\nYou don't say if you auto-login to the system, or if you share an account with everyone, including your family. So, some of these suggestions may apply, and some may not. It is up to you to sort this out.\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all, make sure you do not share an account on the system. Create your own account, and protect it with a modestly strong password.\n\n*If you have a system that support root logins (not all do) then either disable that account or protect it with a different strong password. On systems with root logins I often generate a strong passphrase and then forget about it, once I set up sudo (but this is outside the scope of this answer.)\n\n*Make sure the system has an auto-lock feature or screensaver options enabled if you run a GUI. If you only work at the text-mode console command line, find a locker for that (they exist) or logout when you are done.\n\n\nIf your family has accounts on this system, you have more to do. If they do not, you are pretty much finished. This is the bare minimum needed to keep casual lookers from poking into your business. (It will not keep real hackers away, but this is beyond the scope of this answer.)\nIf your family do have accounts on this system, you need to consider how they can use that account to look at your stuff.\n\n\n*\n\n*If they have sudo access, and that access allows them to look at your files, nothing can stop them other than encryption. Either remove them from the sudoers list (beyond the scope of this answer...) or change their sudo rights so they don't have the ability to look at your files.\n\n*If they do not have sudo rights, they can still read many of your files in your account, and might even be able to write to some of the files and directories. An easy solution is to create a folder on your desktop or in your home directory called \"My Stuff\" and protect this with file perms or ACLs such that \"others\" and \"groups\" do not have any access to it.\nFor example, you could mimic what SSH does, and set the permissions on \"My Stuff\" to read, write and execute (execute means \"search\" when applied to a directory) for you only. If you ran ls -ld My\\ Stuff you would see something like:\ndrwx------ 2 jdv jdv 4096 Feb 25 14:47 My Stuff/\nHow to do this is a command like:\nchmod u+xwr,g-xwr,o-xwr My\\ Stuff/\nOnce this is done, anything you put in this directory is reasonably safe from casual prying eyes.\nThere are more ways to do things like this (remember, the unofficial motto of Unix-style systems is \"there's more than one way to do it\"), but this is the most basic.\n", "Q: Ubuntu necesita AntiVirus?

Codeblocks has that feature.\n\nA: A method which I picked from the Arch Wiki is to trap ERR. trap is used in Bash to run commands when a signal is received, or for certain other events. An ERR trap is ran whenever the current command line terminates with an error - the return value is not 0. (If it did terminate normally, the return value would obviously be 0.)\nSo, for example:\ntrap 'printf \"\\ncode %d\\n\\n\" $?' ERR\n\nThen:\n$ echo foo\nfoo\n$ false\n\ncode 1\n\n$\n\n(Note: no message after the echo command which ran successfully - What does it mean when I type a command and the terminal does nothing?)\nThe Arch Wiki tip went ahead and colorized the message, so that you get a noticeable yellow message:\nEC() { echo -e '\\e[1;33m'code $?'\\e[m\\n'; }\ntrap EC ERR\n\nEffect:\n\nIn effect, all I need to do is keep an eye out for a yellow code in the output to know a command failed.\n\nA: Yes, there are two ways. One is to set PROMPT_COMMAND in .bashrc, the other - to set command substitution in PS1 for the echo $? command.\nMethod 1:\nFrom the bash manual page:\n\nPROMPT_COMMAND\n      If set, the value is executed as a command prior to issuing each\n      primary prompt.\n\n\nWhatever you set this variable to, will be run before drawing the prompt each time. Demo:\n$> PROMPT_COMMAND=\" echo 'Last command exited with'  \\$? 'code'  \"\nLast command exited with 0 code\n$> ls /etc/passwd > /dev/null\nLast command exited with 0 code\n$> ls /etc/asdf > /dev/null\nls: cannot access /etc/asdf: No such file or directory\nLast command exited with 2 code\n$> \n\nNote the use of \\$? . For permanent change, save it in .bashrc\nMethod 2\nSuppose my PS1 prompt is set like this:\nPS1='\nuser@ubuntu:$> '\n\nIf I want to run some program each time this prompt is redrawn on the screen (which is after each preceding command runs), I would need to use command substitution $(. . .)  and set it in the prompt like so:\nPS1=' [ $? ] \nuser@ubuntu: $> '\n\nDemo:\n$> PS1=' [ $? ]\n> $>_ '\n [ 0 ]\n$>_ ls /etc/passwd > /dev/null\n [ 0 ]\n$>_ ls /etc/asdf > /dev/null                                                                                                      \nls: cannot access /etc/asdf: No such file or directory\n [ 2 ]\n$>_ \n\nNotice that I split my PS1 into two lines, top will have [ exitcode ] and bottom  $> <blank space>' .

The screen froze at this- \nBoot\n\nA: Graphic drivers are not a core of this problem, Windows 10 is :)\nI assume you have a PC that's new enough to have UEFI bios. Windows 10 does two things that make installing anything beside it problematic.\n1) when a FastBoot option is enabled it blocks EFI partition and prevents you from installing GRUB. \nTo solve this disable fastboot in both  UEFI and in Win 10 (google for this option as it's hidden well). After Ubutu is installled you can re-enable it in UEFI (not in Win10) \n2) EFI partition has a convinient option, when you have more than one OS UEFI shoud ask you which one you want to use on every boot. BUT M$ made it so Windows Boot Manager makes itsel default stripping you from your right to choose. \nThere are some ways to steal your hardware back from M$. Firstly: google your notebook / MB model to find which key to press on boot to force EFI boot selector to show. For my MSI it's F11. \nIf you have GRUB there just select it and then google for how to make it default (hint: Windows CMD is best for that). \nIf you only have Windows Booot Manager, disable FastBoot and reinstall Ubuntu.\nAs for @Ashu solution use that only when you get a hangup or black screen when booting Ubuntu. I you're on Skylake/nvidia expect that to happen :)\n\nA: If there is no fastboot option in bios then just disable it in Win 10, it should suffice.\nNow we have to make sure that Win 10 boot via EFI not  MBR. You will have to google a bit since I have no time today to do it for you...\nNow use any software that can handle disks and partitions on Win 10. Default partition manager should suffice. Check if you have an EFI partition (it should be the first one on first drive and have around 100 Mb).\nIf yes, mount it. It should go like:\nopen cmd as admin\ndiskpart\nsel disk 0\nsel part 1 (efi part)\nassign letter=b\nexit\ntaskkill /im explorer.exe /f\nexplorer.exe\nNow you should have an EFI partition mounted in My Computer. Look inside ( if explorer tells you that you can't then use CMD as admin). \nInside should be an ubuntu folder. If it's there do in CMD as admin:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n(CAUTION: check if your .efi file is grubx64.efi - if you have SecureBoot enabled it will be named differently). Reboot and welcome GRUB. \nIf there is no such folder, reinstall Ubuntu with Fastboot disabled. Also you may try to disable SecureBoot in bios. \n", "Q: How can I remove segment from a video using avconv? How can I remove one, or multiple segments from a webm video using avconv\n(without reencoding)?\n\nA: To remove a single segment of a webm file you can use the standard method of seeking to a particular section of your file and then specifying a time duration to extract. \nFor example the following will take a section from 1 minute into a file and copy 60 seconds following this into another file:\navconv -ss 00:01:00 -i video.webm -t 60 -c copy cut.webm\n\nTo extract multiple segments of a webm file you can use avconv's basic stream segmenter. For example the following will split a webm video into 60 second segments and generate a playlist file as well:\navconv -i test.webm -c copy \\\n       -f segment -segment_time 60 -segment_list list.pls \\\n       output%03d.webm\n\nA few choices to make with the segmenter but the above examples covers the basics...\n", "Q: I'm installing Ubuntu, and all I see is a spinning wheel.

Apparently, the USB stick (physically) moved at some point during the install process and interrupted it.\nAs mentioned in the comments, all I had to do was to reboot the system and restart the installation all over again. It went smoothly. It even automatically detected how much space I assigned to each partition.\nI hope this helps any one in the future.\n\nA: check the ISO image you downloaded, it could've gotten corrupted by some windows viruses while writing it to a USB flash and it is also good and not harmful to restart the process again and also  checking the md5sum of the ISO is important \n\nA: Please check your USB drive's .iso image.

I was just a user of GNU/Linux for several years, now I want to learn again at least about troubleshooting.  I could find my way with sysvinit, but systemd has me baffled.

A specific example would be to load a server or daemon if it's not running, or to simply attach to the session if it is running.\nI have been reading man tmux and the closest I have gotten to this goal is the following:\ntmux new-session -AD -t TMUXSessionName 'echo Banana'\n\n\nThe -A flag makes new-session behave like attach-session if session-name already exists; in the case, -D behaves like -d to attach-session.\nIf -t is given, the new session is grouped with target-session.  This means they share the same set of windows - all windows from\n  target-session are linked to the new session and any subsequent new windows or windows being closed are applied to both sessions.\n  The current and previous window and any session options remain independent and either session may be killed without affecting the\n  other.

This simple trick help to avoid a lot script problems. In your particular case replace all $i with \"$i\".\nSecond\nAlways add double dash -- at the end of command line to signify the end of command options. It helps to avoid problems when positional parameter has - as a part of its string. Finally the line with useradd command will look like:\n$ sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G interns -- \"$i\"\n\nThird\nConsider that usernames should satisfy the constraints. It depends on particular Linux distribution, here is quote from man useradd of Ubuntu 14.04\n   It is usually recommended to only use usernames that begin with a lower\n   case letter or an underscore, followed by lower case letters, digits,\n   underscores, or dashes. They can end with a dollar sign. In regular\n   expression terms: [a-z_][a-z0-9_-]*[$]?\n\n   On Debian, the only constraints are that usernames must neither start\n   with a dash ('-') nor plus ('+') nor tilde ('~') nor contain a colon\n   (':'), a comma (','), or a whitespace (space: ' ', end of line: '\\n',\n   tabulation: '\\t', etc.). Note that using a slash ('/') may break the\n   default algorithm for the definition of the user's home directory.\n\n   Usernames may only be up to 32 characters long.\n\nAnd finally read this to be aware of other common mistakes.\nAlso take a look to newusers utility, it might be easier if you have tons of users to create.\n", "Q: nginx fail to install on Ubuntu 15.10 server I am trying to install nginx on my freshly installed Ubuntu Server 15.10 with Mate desktop.\nI did a quick update:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nNow trying to install nginx:\nsudo apt-get install nginx\n\nhere is what I am getting:\nserver@Node1:~/nod$ sudo apt-get install nginx\nReading package lists...

I explain a lot more on this in-depth on my blog post about this, but in all practical use cases, use only one or the other between the Ubuntu packages for NGINX and the upstream nginx.org repository - do NOT use both simultaneously, they don't work together properly and never will as they clobber each other.  (upstream makes a single package, Debian/Ubuntu splits things into additional packages for sanity sake and ease of replacing configs with defaults and what not)\nIf you want to have the latest NGINX version and still have it be somewhat more compatible with Ubuntu, you can use the NGINX Mainline PPA (maintained by me, but I also maintain this in Ubuntu as well), which will have a more Ubuntu-compatible package set that is more similar to the packages you're expecting to use rather than the ones you are using.\nIf you want to go this way, I give details on my blog as well for that.\n\nA: This is happening because you have previously installed Nginx from Ubuntu repositories and, after, added a new PPA and tried to upgrade.\nThe correct way to solve this is to remove completely Nginx (backup your conf files if needed) and install it again.\nSo, here are the instructions:\n1 - Remove Nginx (after backup conf files)\nsudo apt-get purge nginx*\n\n2 - Install it again, this time the latest version from your new PPA:\nsudo apt install nginx\n\nThat's it.\n", "Q: Cant get nvidia 840m to work on asus ux303ln with ubuntu 14.04 The asus is a hybrid and ive tried\n1) following the hybrid graphics instructions to no avail ( file cant be found in sys/kernel/debug/)\n2).

Good morning!\nI've installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my PC. And I observe that many packages have latest versions actual for the 2014. For example, I observe gcc 4.9.2 and git 1.9. I know that they have already more recent versions like gcc 5.3 and git 2.7. But I can't get them through the packages manager.\nMy Ubuntu receives some updates for kernel and some system libraries. So I see that updating procedure is working and a repository is updating. But what's going on with non-system packages?\nOf course I can get a source code tarball and build a program from sources. But I'm interesting in getting true packages. I believe that packaging of git or gcc didn't stop in 2014.\nHow to fix settings of my Ubuntu to get them?\n\nA: Go to Software & Updates.\nThere , you will find a tab named Other Softwares\nYou will find repositories which are unchecked and are related to the softwares installed.  Enable those and run update again.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: The best option is to go to Launchpad and find a relevant PPA. Follow instructions for installing on your system.\nYou can go to the package website and download directly but you can get overwhelmed in trying to meet all the dependencies. With a PPA someone else has done all that for you.\n", "Q: How to debug Nautilus crashes and issues? I have a problem since the last update: Nautilus mysteriously doesn't start properly.

Windows user over here, jumping on the Ubuntu train. Currently using 14.04. I have a TV that I use for viewing movies and such, connected through HDMI. I'd like to accomplish the following behaviour but I haven't figured out yet\n\n\n*\n\n*On HDMI connect, do not display anything on my laptop, just display on the TV (automatically)\n\n*On HDMI disconnect, display back my laptop\n\n\nOnly tinkering through settings I can achieve that but it's extremely manual. Am I missing something?\nThanks a lot!\n\nA: Automatically switch off your internal screen if an external screen is connected\nThis can be easily done by running a small background script (started automatically on startup (log in).\nWhat it does\nThe script will automatically switch off your internal screen if your TV (or any other secundary screen) is connected. If you only want it to work for a specific external screen, please mention.\nThe script\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport subprocess\nimport time\n# --- set your internal screen below (the example is my primary screen)\ninternal = \"DVI-I-1\"\n#---\n\n# don't change anything below\nscr_info1 = 0\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(4)\n    # read the current screen setup from xrandr\n    get_screens = subprocess.check_output(\"xrandr\").decode(\"utf-8\").splitlines()\n    scr_data = [l for l in get_screens if \" connected \" in l]\n    # count the number of connected screens\n    scr_info2  = len(scr_data)\n    # if the number of connected screens changes, \n    # switch off the internal one if there are two screens\n    if scr_info2 != scr_info1:\n        if scr_info2 == 2:\n            ext = [s.split()[0] for s in scr_data if not internal in s][0]\n            subprocess.Popen([\"xrandr\", \"--output\", internal, \"--off\", \"--output\", ext, \"--auto\"])\n    scr_info1 = scr_info2\n\nHow to setup\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the script below into an empty file, save it as switch_screens.py\n\n*In the head section of your script, set the name of your internal screen. To find out, open a terminal window and run the command xrandr (no external screen connected) The line with \"connected\" in it shows the name of your screen in the first string, looking like: VGA-1 or something like that.\n\n*Test- run it by opening a terminal window and typ the command:\npython3 /path/to/switch_screens.py\n\nWhile the script runs, connect your TV, wait for you internal screen to switch of and disconnect again.\n\n*If all works fine, add the command below to Startup Applications: open Dash > Startup Applications > Add. Add the command:\n/bin/bash -c \"sleep 15 && python3 /path/to/switch_screens.py\"\n\nLog out and back in. Now your internal screen is switched off automatically if an external screen is connected.\n\nA: Unity normally remember the settings like you describe. That means if you once activate your TV and afterwards deactivate your laptop screen this should done next time you connect your TV again. Also if you unplug your TV it should go back to the Laptopsreen.\nAs you say this didn't happen you can make a small batch file which activate second screen if it is connected and deactivate your laptop screen.\nThis is linked to that question\n", "Q: Ubuntu 32bit or 64bit on a laptop with 4gb ram? My laptop has 4Gb of ram and the processor can suport 64bit.\nWhat should I install, 32bit or 64bit? And why?\nAs far as I know the 32bit version will use less ram but at max 4gb of ram.\n\nA: The 64 bit system can run 32bit applications as well, but if you have 32 bit system you are not able to run 64 bit applications. Some 64bit only examples are Spotify and Viber. I did not even see the 32bit Viber native linux client. If your system is able to run 64 bit, even with 4GB RAM, then take the advantage of the 64 bit.\n\nA: Personally, I've only ever ran 64bit operating systems on my laptops and desktops and have never had a problem. I've also found, like another person has already said, that I have never had an issue with programs that only support 64bit(Obviously) where I probably would have if I had installed the 32bit OS. \nProbably worth noting that I am writing this off a mid 2010 HP Envy laptop with only 4gb RAM and 64bit Ubuntu installed already.\nGo the 64bit :)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 15.10 freezes on purple screen with orange/red dots and the word \"ubuntu\" I recently downloaded ubuntu 15.10 on my laptop, which is a dell inspiron 7000 laptop with 16 GB RAM & intel core 17 nvidia graphics and a uefi secured on booting system.

You can also look at the exit status of the make invocation if you run echo $? just afterwards. \"0\" means \"no error encountered, everything was done as you asked\".\nOccasionally \"Nothing to be done\" is caused by a faulty Makefile (a. k. a. \"job description\") that doesn't reflect the intended action.

Please skip the long story to come to the conclusions if you want.\nLong story:\n\n\n*\n\n*I set up an ubuntu server machine a couple of years ago with two 1TB disks in RAID1.\n\n*recently the machine was faulty and I dismantled it, taking the two HDD.\n\n*I managed to connect one of the disks to my laptop via USB and browse it correctly through mdadm. \n\n*Bought a Synology NAS and placed the other disk inside it, to create a new RAID system. Of course this way it was formatted and I had only one good disk with my old data.\n\n*Connected the good disk to the NAS via USB with the intent to copy all the old data to the freshly formatted disk inside the NAS. I managed to create a mdadm array in the NAS thanks to this guide http://forum.synology.com/wiki/index.php/How_to_manually_mount_a_USB_Hard_Disk,_including_a_disk_that_was_part_of_a_RAID1_array and managed to see that the disk had memory of its previous RAID configuration (in my laptop):\nmdadm --examine --scan /dev/sdk3 \nreturned the line of information I expected\n\n*However the NAS at the end could not mount the disk (/dev/sdq1) to the filesystem (say /mnt/usb), with a generic \"No such device\" error. Apparently it seems mount in busybox (on which the NAS is based) is reluctant on giving further suggestions (http://www.silas.net.br/tech/linux/busybox-troubleshooting.html)\n\n*Then I thought \"well, if I can't copy data via USB in the NAS I will connect the disk to my laptop and transfer trough ethernet\". Good idea. Unfortunately, in the process of creating the array the NAS probably destroyed the original superblocks, so when I connected it to the laptop (Linux Mint ubuntu version) the partition showed up inside the file manager (mdadm worked fine and mapped the partition in /dev/mapper) but could not be mounted: raid mount: /dev/md1: can't read superblock\n\n*trying to fix with e2fsck didn't help\n\n*trying to fix with e2fsck -b  didn't help\n\n*All the information were ok, like those in mdadm --examine --scan /dev/sdk3\n\n\nConclusions:\n\n\n*\n\n*I rebooted the laptop.

I noticed recently (possibly after a recent dist-upgrade) that certain programs were really slow. After a bit of investigation it appears that intel_pstate switches to the \"powersave\" governor by default which correctly scales down my cpufreq to about 600 MHz when I'm not doing anything intensive. However, it no longer scales up the cpufreq when I do something intensive.\nTo fix this I set GOVERNOR=\"performance\" in: \n/etc/init.d/cpufrequtils. \n\nAfter booting, cpufreq correctly stays at around 2.5 GHz and the governor is correctly set to \"performance\". However, after a minute the governor is automatically changed back to \"powersave\" and the cpufreq drops again. If I then manually set the governor with cpufreq-set it returns to 2.5 GHz.\nThe second issue I noticed was that every time I suspend and wake my laptop, the max cpufreq drops by an incremental amount (these increments are the same each time):\nbefore suspending:\ncurrent policy: frequency should be within 800 MHz and 3.50 GHz.\n              The governor \"performance\" may decide which speed to use\n              within this range.\ncurrent CPU frequency is 2.20 GHz.\n\nafter first wake:\ncurrent policy: frequency should be within 800 MHz and 2.10 GHz.\n              The governor \"performance\" may decide which speed to use\n              within this range.\ncurrent CPU frequency is 1.12 GHz.\n\nafter second wake:\ncurrent policy: frequency should be within 800 MHz and 1.40 GHz.\n              The governor \"performance\" may decide which speed to use\n              within this range.\ncurrent CPU frequency is 1.30 GHz.\n\netc.\nNote: the governor is still set to \"performance\". \nAttempting to set the cpufreq max with cpufreq-set:\nfor ((i=0;i<$(nproc);i++)); do sudo cpufreq-set -c $i -u 3.50GHz; done\n\nhas no effect.\nLastly, I also attempted to disable intel_pstate in grub and set the acpi config to \"performance\"; this suffers from the same suspend/wake problem.\nAny insight would be appreciated!\nEdit 1: I have tried this which suggests that the problem may be that clock modulation automatically enables on wake, which conflicts with intel_pstate. Indeed it seems that clock modulation is enabled, but disabling it with:\nsudo wrmsr -a 0x19a 0x0\n\ndoes not noticeably change the frequencies, and I am still unable to change the max cpufreq value.\nEdit 2: @DougSmythies on my pc those files are elsewhere, these are the respective printouts (I've excluded frequencies for the other 7 cores, they're identical). Note also that I am currently using the acpi driver:\ncat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/cpu_min_freq\n800000 \n\ncat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/cpu_max_freq\n2501000\n\ncat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq                                                 \n2501000 \n\ncat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_min_freq                                                 \n800000\n\nI can't find the intel_pstate file anywhere in /sys/devices.\nEdit 3: @DougSmythies I have rebooted with the intel_pstate driver and suspended and woken the machine up.

I can only use a normal cellphone to e.g. receive SMS.\nIs there any chance to use Whatsapp under those circumstances? How do I set it up and register an account?\n\nUpdate 2:\nI managed to set Pidgin (with pidgin-whatsapp 0.8.4 from ppa:whatsapp-purple/ppa) up to be able to contact friends and send them text messages, but I can't receive any text messages. I can receive images and see typing notifications however. The debug output of pidgin also seems to show incoming messages, but they simply don't get displayed.\nAny ideas how I could fix that? I just wrote a bug report on GitHub against the pidgin-whatsapp package so far...\n\nUpdate 3:\nThe package pidgin-whatsapp got discontinued, its developer gave up trying to handle Whatsapp's attempts to block unofficial clients. So using this Pidgin plugin is not an option any more.\n\nA: TL;DR: Run it on Android x86 in VirtualBox with limited resources allocated to it, and hook that up with the web app or desktop client to have a desktop interface.\nWhatsapp's official desktop client for Windows doesn't help us, even if we were to run it under Wine. That's because it works exacty like their web app. It needs constant connection to a smartphone client in order to work.\nTherefore, the best way to do this is to somehow run the actual Android app on your desktop. It doesn't need the SIM card to be in the same device. You just register with an SMS once, and you are good.\nThe first way I thought of doing this was through Google Chrome, which can run many Android apps through some tweaks. Unfortunately, the result of that seems to be the opposite problem from the one you're having with Pidgin!\n\nApp can receive msgs, but not reply.\n\nTherefore, the last resort I can think of is to install Android x86 or Remix OS in VirtualBox and install Whatsapp from an APK there. You'll be able to activate it through receiving an SMS to your cellphone.\nIt's also possible to do this through an emulator like Genymotion, but I think that's gonna emulate ARM architecture, so I'm pretty sure it will be much more resource hungry and/or slow compared to the x86 hypervisors.\nI've heard that Whatsapp will require Google Play Services, but I think that's included in at least Android x86, and if not, it's pretty easy to install in both Android x86 and Remix OS.\nDon't like the touch interface of the Android app? Well, since you now have a working Android client, you can now use Whatsapp Web or even the native Windows application through Wine. The tricky part is that in order to activate it, the Android x86/Remix OS hypervisor has to scan a QR code which will be displayed in your browser/Whatsapp desktop client. This can be done, though. There are many ways.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have a USB or Bluetooth camera, you can try to activate it in VirtualBox as a webcam. You then simply scan the QR-code from Ubuntu.\n\n*If you only have an internal Webcam in your computer, you have to print the QR code and scan it, or take a screenshot of it and display it on another screen, or have fun with two physical mirrors. \n\n*It would also be possible to root your Android VM and just feed the QR-code image to a camera emulator, but I'm not exactly sure how to do that. I asked a question about it on Android SE.\n\n*Or, if you have access to an Android device with a camera once, you can use Titanium Backup to transfer your Whatsapp sign-in to that Android device just for the sake of scanning the QR-code. (Make sure the \"keep me signed in\" box is ticked\"). And make sure the original Whatsapp still works afterwards. Otherwise, use Titanium to transfer your sign-in back. \n\n\nIf you succeed in this, you can use Whatsapp Web in your browser on Ubuntu or the desktop app under Wine as long as the VM is running. One of the benefits of this is that you can severely limit the resources allocated to the VM. It's only gonna run one single, lightweight app, and you don't care if the Android GUI gets a bit sluggish. Of course, don't limit it so much that the app or VM crashes or starts processing content too slowly.\nOff-topic comment: This approach should also work on Windows, OS X, Solaris, other Linuxes, etc. Basically any system that can run VirtualBox, something similar or any Android emulator.\n", "Q: Creating wine shortcuts on 15.10: how to hide from desktop but not from launcher? So I followed a previous answer to successfully create a shortcut to a Wine application. I want to hide the desktop icon but still show the launcher icon. I deleted the my-app.desktop from the Desktop but that also deleted my launcher icon.\nAny ideas how it can be done? thanks :)\n\nA: If you successfully created a launcher (.desktop file), the difficult part was already done :).\nWhat you still needed to do was to move the launcher to ~/.local/share/applications (~ stands for your home directory). Then you might have to log out/in, but then the launcher will show up in Dash if the launcher is valid.\nExplanation\nDash by default looks into both /usr/share/applications and ~/.local/share/applications for valid launchers. The first one is for globally installed applications, the latter for local ones, or for local versions (with personal options) of the globally installed launchers.\nSince Wine applications are (locally) installed in ~/.wine, you should have your launcher in ~/.local/share/applications by definition.\nAdditional information\nNot really related to this question, but still good to know:\nIf an application's launcher exists in both ~/.local/share/applications and /usr/share/applications, the first (local) one \"overrules\" the global one.\n", "Q: Cursor Won't Move - ASUS C300 I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on my ASUS C300m Chromebook, completely replacing Chrome OS.

Here is the story so far: yesterday I switched to a propriatary ATI driver instead of the Nouveau driver that I ran uo to that time. The Ati driver ran fine but at next bootup there were problems. No sound (and appearantly no discovearable soundcards) and weird sizing of screens. So i learnt my lesson about dodgy prop drivers and wanted to go back to good old Noveau. in Settings UI, i selected the X.org Nouveau driver and rebooted. Now I got new errors but the system still managed to boot into graphical mode. However in the additional-drivers tab of system settings, it didnt displays the previously selected ATI driver, but a manually installed one (I do not remember exactly which). That was weird, but i wasnt that worried still. I decided to purge and reinstall X.org along with lightdm and plymouth. and afterwards reinstall ubuntu desktop, which I had done succesfully in the past. This time however, it failed. When I next booted this is what I got: \nhttp://picpaste.com/20160228_152835-LUNf7Vwi.jpg\nSo my display drivers and server are pretty screwed up.\nAfter getting this error, I booted into recovery mode to see what was up. I took a look at any broken packages in the recovery menu dpkg menu item. Strangely enough, this listed some -I believe 3- broken Nautilus packages. (I hit 'd' for details to discover this. I didnt do 'y' to repair), and exited.\nSo now seemed a good time to at least back up my files before trying anything else..\nBut after another reboot to recovery-mode and dropping into a shell prompt, I did a cd /home and then ls -l. That gives me 0 files and directories. /home/myhomedir doesnt show anymore. However, If I run the live cd, I can still see my volume with all files intact. I have also mounted an external drive in my live-cd environment. But copying the files from local drive to external drive doesnt work. I get \"permission denied\" for most files. gksudo(or gksu) nautilus doesnt work. It says program gksu is not installed. So recovering user files with a Live CD is turning out to be tricky. So:\n1)I would like help backing up the /home dirs on my local disk to an external drive. either by using the live cd or from terminal shell. I assume i somehow need to force a read/write mount of the volume, but i do not know how. 2)Having done that I'd appreciate any pointers on restoring X.org and nouveau drivers and getting filesystem back to working order without doing a full reinstall. (I realise I might need to split the question up in two separate AU questions. please advise)\nbtw: I do not have an encrypted home drive.

For some reason, I could not validate the versions \"0.42.06\", \"42.06\", \"42.6\" or even \"42\". I decided to skip this part of the desktop file.\nI then used the command desktop-file-install file to install the game to /usr/share/applications/. I could then find it in my menu, put it on a panel or move it to the desktop. This was how I wanted it, and I like it as it is this way.\n", "Q: How do I run a command? I am a new user, who has just been told to run / execute a command. The answer has some text with a grey background like this text here or\nsometimes this text here.\n\nHowever, I don't know what \"run\" or \"command\" means in relation to Ubuntu.\nHow do I do this?\n\nThis is intended for use as a Q&A you can link to when you tell someone to run a command.\n\nA: What is a command?\nCommands, and the command line, are another way to tell the computer what to do. For example, you can click the google chrome icon, or you can run the command google-chrome.\nThis may seem a silly thing to do, but when you click the icon, that's what the computer does! It also is much easier to do some tasks with the command line.\nFor example, installing programs can be quicker and easier - just use sudo apt-get install program, rather than navigating through the software center.\nAnd if my Bluetooth stops working, I run a command to fix it - that's the only way!\nAnyway, how do you run a command?\nThis is also simple, although there are many ways to do it.\nSimply, you open a Terminal and type (or copy / paste) the command in, then press Enter. In the image, I've run the command ls Desktop/ which will list all files on my desktop. Note that to paste you press Ctrl + Shift + V in the terminal.\n\nBy default you open the terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T, or opening the Dash and searching for \"Terminal\".\nWhat is a tty?\nSometimes, you may be told to run a command in the tty - often followed by a number, for example tty2. The GUI runs on tty7. (Update for 2021: the GUI now often runs on tty1 or tty2).\nTo access this, you press Ctrl + Alt + FX - where FX is replaced with the Function key that corresponds to the number. For example, to access tty2 you would press Ctrl + Alt + F2.\nYou have to login to this, but some things need the tty to work.\nGetting back to the GUI will depend on your Ubuntu version, but trying each tty in turn should work until you find it. If you can’t find it on any tyy 1-8, you may need to restart - but ask the person who is helping you by commenting below the answer!\nWhat about GUI (Graphical User Interface) programs?\nThe terminal can also launch GUI programs. This can have the advantage of viewing the output the program gives - for example running software-centre looks like this:\n\nYou can also provide extra \"arguments\" - also known as \"parameters\" and \"options\" to the command.\nFor example, if I run google-chrome --app=http://youtube.com it opens a window without the URL bar or the tabs:\n\nBear in mind, if you close the terminal, you also lose the Google Chrome window...\nOne final method\nThis is only good for GUI programs, like Chrome, Firefox and Gedit. However, it also means you don't have a terminal lying around - which you could accidentally close. It's no good for sudo apt-get install program or similar, because you can't type your password after running it.\nPress Alt + F2, and a \"Run Dialouge\" appears - a bit like the run window on Windows:\nUbuntu:                                                                                    Windows:\n\nYou can type any command into here, and it will run it!\n\nA: Types of commands vary somewhat. They can be single line, like\n echo 'HelloAskubuntu' # Print 'HelloAskubuntu' \n\nsingle line with redirection to other commands\necho 'Hello World' | wc # count number of lines, words, and chars in 'Hello World'\n\nmultiline with redirection \n$> bash << END                                                                 \n> echo one\n> echo two\n> echo three\n> END\none\ntwo\nthree\n\nOr multiline in form of scripts (which in terms of Windows language is batch  files).  Scripts are just files with lists of commands in them, that are executed sequentially. These are effectively custom build programs/software, analogous to building your own electronics out of existing spare parts. \nRegardless of the type of command, you will need access to a command line, commonly known as Terminal. There is either TTY terminals on Ctrl+Alt+F[1-6] keyboard shortcuts (exit those with Alt+F7), or you can use GUI app by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T.\nTerminals typically run software known as shell. The shell interprets the commands and executes them. Some shells are compatible with each other for the most part like bash, ksh, mksh, zsh , while tcsh and csh are quite different. They all have different features, and often are used for different tasks.\nEither a script or a command have to be executed in shell. Some commands are physically present executable files on disks, like /bin/ls. Other commands are aliases or functions that are lists of existing commands. They exist only in the settings of the shell. For example, for bash it would be .bashrc settings file. Real executables can be run with the name or full path, like ls or /bin/ls respectivelly.\nScripts can be run with full path, or if they are stored somewhere that your shell knows about ( and it knows about only things in the PATH variable, which you can read with echo $PATH ). For example, I can run my script by going to my bin directory and running it with ./ operator, like so \n cd $HOME/bin; ./helloworld.sh\n\nOr give terminal full path\n /home/Serg/bin/helloworld.sh\n\n\nA: To run a command you need to open a terminal window. You can find the terminal among your applications like you would any other. Copy and paste the grayed text into the terminal window after opening it and then press Enter key to execute. You will probably see some text output during and after execution. This is feedback from the command you just ran.\nCommand is an instruction you give to a computer - you tell it to do something. You are already familiar with some commands, you use them while using your computer all the time. For example clicking on buttons in your GUI (graphical user interface), like web browsers, is the same thing - telling your computer to do something.\nIf you require more information you can find it at \nWhat is a terminal and how do I open and use it? and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal\n", "Q: bash script to delete last 10 lines in histroy i want to make a bash script to delete last 10 lines in the history\nthat is what i made, but i still getting an error\n#!/bin/bash\ni= history | wc -1\nj= $i-10\nfor x in {$i..$j}\ndo\n  history -d $x\ndone\n\nI can't figure out what is wrong, any idea ?\n\nA: There are several errors.\n\ni= history | wc -1\n\nYou've got spaces in here so you'd need to wrap this in \"\" to avoid an error, and additionally you've added an unneeded space after the equal sign. However, all you've done is create a variable containing \"history | wc -1\". Firstly, there is no \"wc -1\". I think you meant \"wc -l\", which counts the lines. Secondly, I think you wanted to actually run this command. \nYou could use:\n\ni=$(history | wc -l)\n\nHowever, it's always going to be 0 as the result, because you're in a subshell.\n\nj= $i-10\n\nYou've added a space after the equal sign. You could use \"j=$i-10\", but that's not actually going to do any math.\nTry something like:\n\nj=$(echo \"${i}-10\" | bc -l)\n\nYou're probably going to want to write an if statement to handle senarios where i is 10 or less. \nTry something like:\n\nif [[ \"$i\" -lt \"11\" ]]; then j=\"1\"; fi\n\n\nfor x in {$i..$j}\n\nYou can't use variables here. The result will be #..# instead of a list of numbers. You could get around this problem by creating a one-liner for do done statement that is echoed into a variable and then use eval to actually execute it. This way the $i and $j will already have been replaced with the actual numbers when the command is run.\nUltimately though, the entire approach is pointless, because when you run the history command in the shell script you're going to get zero as the result of the count, because you're in a subshell, and subshells do not report their history. To see what I mean, run several commands, and then run this script:\n\n#!/bin/bash\nhistory | wc -l\n\nAs you can see, the result is 0. Why? Because it's the history of the subshell, and the subshell doesn't report history. Even if you add other commands into the script before the history command, the result will be 0.\nStart over. Look into editing the history file directly as @kos has suggested. Keep in mind commands from the current shell aren't written to the file until the shell exits.\nGood luck.\n", "Q: Brightness control is blocked after reaching minimum Several days ago I tried to fix a quite popular problem.

This is fine for my laptop (running XUbuntu 13.10 32-bit), but when it comes to my other devices...not so much.  So what I have to do is plug in my laptop, and then set Network Manager to 'Create New Wi-Fi Network...'  This is all well and good, and it gets the other devices online, but I would like to automate this process a bit.\nWhat I would like to do is to set up a bash script to run at startup (this part I can do without assistance) to run the following pseudocode:\nWhile true\n  If ethernet cable is plugged in and wlan0 is not broadcasting [Foo] signal\n   - Drop any connection on wlan0\n   - Create a new Wi-Fi network: [Foo], using WEP key: [bar]\n  If ethernet cable is unplugged and wlan0 is broadcasting Omni signal\n   - Stop broadcasting Omni on wlan0\nEnd While\n\nNow a few notes here before I continue.  First, I understand WEP is insecure, but in my case it's necessary as the other devices in question don't handle WPA/WPA2 very gracefully, if at all.  Second, I also realize there is probably a way to do this within Network Manager, but I would like to do this in Bash (not only to make it more easily portable to future laptops, but also to learn more about Bash scripting)\nNow, back to our code.  The first line is the simplest one:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nNext is our loop to keep this script running in the background to keep an eye on that ethernet connection, doing so once a minute to keep from overloading one of my CPUs:\nwhile true; do\n # Loop contents to go here\n sleep 60\ndone\n\nNow comes the part I need help with, the logic that checks the ethernet connection and creates/destroys the [Foo] network as needed.  For checking the state of the network connection, I had briefly pondered using\nifconfig | grep eth0\n\nBut this output doesn't give me the required 'am I connected' information.

So, I've used Ubuntu for a month or two in dualboot with Windows 8, it looked and ran fine, however it broke down for some reason and I had to restore the entire PC. Due to this bad experience, I decided to reinstall Ubuntu on an external hard drive separated from my main Windows machine. This option seems to be good for both the operating systems.\nHowever, when installing Ubuntu, for some reason, the bootloader Grub was not installed on the external drive, while at the same time, the \"old\" Grub bootloader was never erased from the PC internal hard drive. As a result, I am in a weird situation: when I want to run Windows, I just power on the pc and go. When I want to run Linux, I have to plug in the external drive, go in the startup menu, and change bootloader from Windows' to Grub. The external hard drive is not bootable (as a usb stick for example) and this long sequence of operations needs to be repeated each time.\nQuick recap:\n\n\n*\n\n*PC internal hard drive contains Windows OS, Windows bootloader and Grub from the old linux installation.\n\n*External hard drive contains Ubuntu 15.10, possibly Grub, but is not bootable as a USB stick is.\n\n*Every time I want to switch OS I need to change bootloader manually in the startup menu which is tedious.\n\n*Boot devices are ordered as follows: 1. USB 2. External drive 3. Internal drive\n\n\nMy question:\nHow can I make the external drive bootable so that when I want to switch from Windows to Linux I just power off the pc, plug in the USB, power on the pc and go? (without loosing the data I already stored on it and all the preferences)\nPS.\nFor some reason Windows is terribly slow when loaded via the Grub bootloader available in the internal drive. Furthermore, if the external hard drive is not plugged in, Grub bootloader shows the Grub rescue panel only. So using the already installed Grub as the only bootloader is not an option.\n\nA: This is how I installed grub unto my external hard drive (GPT) which had Ubuntu 17.04 installed. When you do this it allows you to boot your Ubuntu on any PC which supports UEFI by using the grub on the external without relying on the PC grub. It can also serve as backup grub in case the is problem with EFI of Windows.\nInstalling Grub to an external hard drive that has Ubuntu installed\n\n*\n\n*Boot into an Ubuntu live USB and connect the external hard drive.\n\n\n*List partitions of all devices:\n lsblk\n\n\n\n*From the results of lsblk, identify the linux partition and also the efi partition of the external hard drive,\ni.e. /dev/sdXY1 and /dev/sdXY2 respectively. Replace XY1 and XY2 with your own partition names.\n\n\n*Special mount the linux partition:\n  sudo mount /dev/sdXY1 /mnt\n\n\n\n*Mount critical virtual filesystems:\n for i in /dev /dev/pts /proc /sys /run; do sudo mount -B $i /mnt$i; done\n\n\n\n*chroot into the Linux partition you mounted:\n sudo chroot /mnt\n\nYou are now in the external hard drive's linux filesystem.\n\n\n*Create the directory where grub would install its files:\n mkdir -p /boot/efi\n\nIf it already exists, then skip to step 8.\n\n\n*Mount the efi partition from step 3:\n mount /dev/sdXY2 /boot/efi\n\n\n\n*Install grub to the external hard drive:\n grub-install /dev/sdX\n\n\n\n*Update grub:\nupdate-grub\n\n\n\n*Find the UUID of the efi partition (aka 'vfat') and note it down:\nblkid\n\nor\nls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid\n\n\n\n*Now we need to tell fstab to mount that efi partition on boot:\ncp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak  \nsudo nano /etc/fstab  \n\nAdd the below two lines to fstab replacing xxxx-xxxx with the UUID from step 11:\n#my modified fstab to mount external hard drive's esp  \nUUID=xxxx-xxxx   /boot/efi   vfat   umask=0077   0   1  \n\nMake sure to comment out the fstab entry of the Windows esp so it doesn't conflict.\n\n\n*Exit the chroot:\nexit\n\n\n\n*Reboot the PC:\nsudo reboot\n\nAt this point when you reboot and choose your external device from the EFI boot manager, it will boot to grub.\nTo make Ubuntu automatically boot when you insert the external and Windows to automatically boot when the external is not inserted you would have to create a custom boot entry for Ubuntu to point to the efi on the external drive:\nCreating a custom boot entry for Ubuntu to point to efi on the external HD\nFrom Windows EasyUEFI can add or remove boot entries.\nFrom Linux efibootmgr can add or remove boot entries.\nAlternative #1 – using EasyUEFI\n\n*\n\n*In Windows download EasyUEFI, install it and run.\n\n\n*Choose the EFI options manager\n\n\n*Choose create 'new entry' with + sign\n\n\n*Choose Linux or other OS and give it a name in the description box\n\n\n*Select the FAT32 EFI partition on the external drive that contains the grub bootloader\n\n\n*Choose browse\n\n\n*Navigate to /efi/ubuntu/shimx64.efi or /efi/ubuntu/grubx64\n\n\n*Save\n\n\n*Move it to the top of the boot entries list\n\n\n*Restart\nAlternative #2 – using efibootmgr\n\n*\n\n*List boot menu entries:\n efibootmgr\n\n\n\n*Create a boot entry:\n efibootmgr -c [-L label] [-d /dev/sdX]\n\ne.g.: efibootmgr -c -L myubuntu -d /dev/sdX\nThis boot entry would automatically be the first entry.\n/dev/sdX is the external hard drive with the grub bootloader.\n\n\n*You can now reboot and without your intervention Ubuntu would automatically boot when external hard drive is plugged in. When the external hard drive is not plugged in, the PC would skip\nour Ubuntu boot entry to the next entry which is probably Windows Boot Manager.\n\nA: I eventually found the solution to my problem. I'll post it here in case someone may need it. Also, I'm not entirely sure what worked and if all the steps I took were really necessary, however this worked.\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure you have an EFI partition on your external drive using gparted or something similar. The partition should be FAT32, have the boot and esp flags, and be mounted at /boot/efi. The size should be at least 200 Mb although I made it 1Gb since I hade space available on my HD. If you do not have this partition, then make it.\n\n*Check that the UUID of the EFI BOOT partition on your external hard drive matches the one in the fstab file.\n\n\nto check partitions' UUID just type in the terminal\nls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid\n\nwhile to edit the fstab file\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\n\n\n\n*Now install Grub. (You can also try to copy grub from the internal drive to the external drive partition but it did not work for me).\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdX\nreplace sdX with the actual drive.\n\n\n*In case you haven't already done it, enable boot from USB drive and make sure external boot loader is loaded before the internal one from your UEFI setup menu. Now your machine should boot first from USB then (if no boot loader has been found) from the internal hard drive.\n\n", "Q: Intel HD 520 really weak performance | Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Using Lenovo e460 with i5-6200u + Intel HD 520. \nPerformance is terrible, 20FPS on games I got 80+ in Windows (same settings) and even native linux games like CSGO. \nI've done all the updates etc, does anyone know if I should be using different drivers and how? \n\nA: I have HP Probook 450 G3 with the same CPU & GPU.\nAlso see that preformance of our integrated GPU is qutie low.\nOn Ubuntu 14.04 LTS sometimes GPU was stuck.

I installed it following this tutorial and everything looks fine (I had to create the EFI partition with the Terminal though) but it just won't boot, the live install boots without problems. \nI'm using the school's computers which have the UEFI menu password protected so I can't access that and I won't have a laptop for like 3 weeks (main reason why I'm doing this). I tested it with a friend's laptop disabling the Secure boot but it still wouldn't boot. I also saw that some tutorials don't add the EFI partition so I tried without that one and still won't work. And I know it's not the 64GB usb not booting because I had a live install on it too before and it booted fine.\nPlease, I have been trying to make it work for two days now, any ideas? I can barely understand this stuff so if you could explain step by step that would be awesome.\n\nA: Under EFI, the boot loader is stored as an ordinary file on an EFI System Partition (ESP). Which boot loader is launched is stored in NVRAM. In EFI mode, a standard Linux install places its boot loader as EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi (which in turn calls EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi) on the ESP, and stores a reference to this in NVRAM. This works fine when the disk is an internal disk. With an external disk, though, the NVRAM variable may be erased when the disk is unplugged from the computer; and even if it's not, the disk will be bootable only on the computer on which the OS is installed.\nBecause OS installers and emergency utilities must be prepared on computers other than those on which they're run, EFI provides a special filename for such boot loaders. On x86-64 systems, that name is EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. The Ubuntu installer therefore uses this name. You can do the same yourself after installing to a USB flash drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the ESP that's on the USB flash drive. Suppose it's in /mnt.\n\n*Copy the original boot loader files by typing cp -r /mnt/EFI/ubuntu /mnt/EFI/BOOT.\n\n*Rename the copy of shim by typing mv /mnt/efi/BOOT/shimx64.efi /mnt/efi/BOOT/bootx64.efi.\n\n\nThe disk should now be bootable on any 64-bit EFI-based computer. Of course, you may need to use the computer's built-in boot manager, much as you would on a BIOS-based computer, to boot from the USB flash drive.\n\nA: I don't know why, I don't really care, I'm just so happy it finally worked...

Terminal is really your bestfriend in linux!\nNormal usage for using scp would be\nscp user@remoteserver:/path/of/the/file /path/for/local\n\nHere is one for rsync as well\nrsync -avzu user@remoteserver:/path/of/the/file /path/for/local\n\nRead the manual for more information about scp and rsync.\n", "Q: DNAT redirecting to specifc port is not working I want to redirect ssh by port using DNAT, and i do try to ssh it through the command > username@IP_ADDRESS:10003, and I got this message:\nssh: Could not resolve hostname IP_ADDRESS:10003: Name or service not known\n\nMy configuration looks fine to me, does it needs any change?\nThose rules I used:\n#default policy\niptables --policy INPUT DROP\niptables --policy OUTPUT DROP\niptables --policy FORWARD DROP\n#connection states\niptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\niptables -A OUTPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\niptables -A FORWARD -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\n\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $EXTERNAL_ETH -p tcp  --sport $OTHER_PORTS --dport 10003 -d $PUBLIC_IP -j DNAT --to-destination $SERVER2:22\niptables -A FORWARD -i $EXTERNAL_ETH -o $INTERNAL_ETH -p tcp --sport $OTHER_PORTS --dport 22 -d $SERVER2 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\n\nand that is how it looks in the output\nChain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)\n4        0     0 DNAT       tcp  --  eth0   *       0.0.0.0/0            $1111.1111.11.1       tcp spts:1024:65535 dpt:10003 to:10.0.0.3:22\n\nChain FORWARD (policy DROP 0 packets, 0 bytes)\n10       0     0 ACCEPT     tcp  --  eth0   eth1    0.0.0.0/0            10.0.0.3             tcp spts:1024:65535 dpt:22 state NEW\n\n\nA: Test this command:\nssh username@IP_ADDRESS -p 10003\n\n", "Q: Wireless connection drops after a while, reception range drastically decreased I recently dual boot my system (HP-ab034tx) with Ubuntu and Windows 10. Unfortunately I am having trouble with wireless connection on Ubuntu. The connection is being disconnected in a while and also the Wi-Fi range is very little whereas it seems to be working great on Windows.\nI think the problem is regarding the wireless drivers so I tried updating these. I still can't connect my system.\nWireless card adapter : Realtek RTL8723BE 802.11 bgn Wi-Fi Adapter\n\nA: Most certainly a driver/power management issue... assuming yr laptop is an HP Pavilion 14-ab000 Notebook PC series\n[Preliminary rant] As is often the case HP seems not to have any interest in providing solutions to the Linux desktop user community, so as far as I know you will not be able to find a Linux driver specific to yr wireless card adapter on their site. [End of rant]\nFirst] Check out those old and new AU answers, where you can get a Realtek RTL8723BE 802.11 bgn Wi-Fi Adapter driver from Github. Both answers are essentially the same but the more recent will take you step by step through terminal commands. \nNote: To open a terminal window, press ALT+CTRL+T -- when done close it with CTRL+D\nSecond] If that does not solves yr problem, you may want to try to hack into the power management options of your wireless chipset. Power Management for Realtek chipsets such as yrs sometimes lead to poor performance, slowness in connecting to a network and erratic behavior.\nThe hack consists in disabling yr wireless adapter's sleep feature. In the terminal, type:\n$ echo \"options rtl8723be fwlps=0\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/rtl8723be.conf\n\nThis hack is copied verbatim from AndyAndy on this AU's post. It also gives you the source for a recent firmware for your wireless adapter. \nInstead of rebooting yr box, try (in the terminal):\n$ sudo rmmod rtl8723be && sudo modprobe rtl8723be\n\nWait for 30 minutes or so, to see whether yr wireless connection is really stable. If not reboot and check yr wireless connection again.\nThird] As a last resort I would download the above mentioned firmware (I have not tested it). If you do, place it in directory /lib/firmware/rtlwifi/ and reboot.\nAs before wait for 30 minutes or so, to see whether yr wireless connection is really stable. If not scream loud enough so somedody can hear you and resume troubleshooting.\n", "Q: matlab R2015a in Linux: Can't copy paste with conventional way It seems that in linux version 'matlab R2015a' copy paste can not be done with 'Ctrl+c' and 'Ctrl+v'.\nSo how can I solve this?

I am new in linux. I used to work on windows(performance testing, load testing, smoke testing and so on ). I am doing a job which requires to perform some tests.\n\nA: Ctrl+a to enter command mode, then press d.  This will only detach your session, leaving any connections or programs you had open in there still running.  This sounds more like what you were after.\nTo view screen sessions, attached or no, type screen -ls\nTo re-attach to a session type screen -r: this will work if you have only one session out there.  Otherwise you'll have to specify to process id (pid) like so screen -r 12345.\nThere a LOT you can do with screen - this is just a thumbnail of what you can accomplish.\nBonus:  If you want a cheat sheet of useful screen command while you're in a screen session just hit Ctrl+a then type :help.\nWelcome to the wonderful world of Linux, by the way.

As refer to my earlier problems with 14.04, Ethernet Connection randomly disconnects after transmit queue 0 timed out\nI was having trouble using Ethernet in 14.04, and this problem still persists with any latest kernel versions (current kernel: 4.2.0.30-generic). The solution I found to the this problem was to shift to 12.04 with kernel 3.2.0-83-generic and then the Ethernet connection became stable.\nNow after upgrading to 15.10 I switched back to 12.04 with kernel 3.11.0-15-generic, but now I am facing the same Ethernet problem as i referred, in 14.04.

So from my experience with stable internet in certain kernel versions in 12.04 and from Wired Network is not stable in ubuntu 13.04 (64-bit), which seems to be a similar problem, changing the kernel seems to be the best option i have.\n\n\nSo considering my above problems, is it somehow possible to use kernel v3.2 in ubuntu 14.04 ?\nHow do i install this old kernel, it'd be nice if someone give me a step by step procedure to do it manually from terminal.\n\nA: Note: Changing from r8169 to r8168 may not work in all cases, considering my case and from some other similar posts on older ubuntu versions, it seems like changing the kernel to an old stable version is the best option one has unless it is not fixed in the latest updates.\nFinally I installed an older kernel version 3.2.0-83-generic in 14.04 LTS (32bit) manually. It solved my ethernet problem and it seems to be stable enough.\nDownload the following .deb packages from 1, 2, 3, 4 and install it:\nsudo dpkg -i linux-headers-3.2.0-83_3.2.0-83.120_all.deb\nsudo dpkg -i linux-headers-3.2.0-83-generic_3.2.0-83.120_i386.deb\nsudo dpkg -i linux-image-3.2.0-83-generic_3.2.0-83.120_i386.deb\n\nChange the boot order by editing GRUB_DEFAULT=0 in /etc/default/grub as given here.

In particular, you can use the lsctl tool like this: sudo lsctl status. restart, stop and start also work.\nThat error means that at least the appserver isn't running.\n", "Q: Randomly loosing internet connection with Ubuntu 14.04 64bit I've just made fresh installation of Ubuntu 14.04 and I'm experimenting strange behaviour of the internet connection: sometimes I cannot send receive any data, even if the connection is still active as indicated by the applet showing the status of the network manager.\nEvery time I have have to go with the mouse and click (turn-off) \"Wireless\". Then I wait for a couple of seconds and turn it on again.\nI mounted an usb wifi-stick listed as 100% compatible with Ubuntu 14.04 (i.e. the TP-LINK TL-WN821N USB Adapter WLAN 802.11n 300Mbit Stick). During the installation the stick was recognized with zero problems, but now I cannot understand how to deal with this frustrating issue.\nI searched across Ubuntu forums but I've read just about generic indications. No clear assertions about the nature of the problem.\n\nA: First of all, because these operations involve editing your system configuration at the kernel level, before you do any of this, BACK UP ANY IMPORTANT FILES, AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BOOTABLE UBUNTU LIVE USB / DVD / CD. I cannot stress this enough. If for some reason your system crashes completely during these operations (though it shouldn't), you may want to have backups of anything important and a way to reinstall your OS if the need arises. \nVisit this page, and select your hardware version number from the drop down list. (you should be able to find this number on the USB stick):\nhttp://www.tp-link.com/en/download/TL-WN821N_V4.html#Driver\nThere are many drivers provided here in .zip files. The Linux driver file for V4 also contains a .pdf installation guide. If your version is V4, download the driver for Linux kernel, open, and follow the instructions in the .pdf file. If you have V4, stop reading here. The above should fix your problem.  \nIf your version is V3, you need to download a special tool along with any dependencies, by opening up a terminal and entering the following code:\nsudo apt-get install ndisgtk\n\nEnter your password, press Y then Enter when prompted.\nThen, go to the V3 driver download page, and download the driver for Windows Vista / XP. \nNext, in the terminal, type\nsudo ndisgtk\n\nIn the graphical interface, you should be able to load the appropriate driver from the 'Windows XP' folder in the downloaded file (the file name is 'arusb_XP.inf')\nAfter you have it loaded, run \nsudo nautilus\n\nNow, go to root/etc/modprobe.d\nCreate a new .conf file here by right clicking and selecting New > Empty File (you can name it whatever you want, as long as it ends in .conf). Right click the file, and open with gedit. Type the following code in the text editor. \nblacklist ar9170usb\nSave, and close the file.\nNow, create another .conf file in the same place. Open in gedit, enter\nblacklist carl9170usb\n\nSave and close. \nNow, in the terminal, type the following and press enter:\nsudo gedit /etc/modules\n\nAt the bottom of the text file, add the following line:\nndiswrapper\n\nSave, close, then restart your system. Everything should be working. \nIf your version number is V5 or earlier than V3, the website does not seem to offer any drivers, but it is often the case that the drivers for a different version may work in the event that no drivers are offered. Trial and error may be necessary in this case to figure out which, if any, of the drivers available on the website actually work for these versions.   \nAlternatively, you may be able to obtain professional assistance by contacting TP-Link Tech Support using one of the methods listed on this page:\nhttp://www.tp-link.com/en/contact.html\nHope this helps!\n\nA: SOLVED!\nI've religiously followed the instructions published by pvret on github and I've got the RTL8192CU realtek driver modified to work with Ubuntu 14.04:\nhttp://github.com/pvaret/rtl8192cu-fixes\nI've tested the connection for more than 8 hours, no one time the wifi connection was lost. So the problem is definitely solved.\nNote: after restarting Ubuntu I've gone in panic 'cause the network manager (in the bottom-right corner of the screen) prompted me with the allarming message \"No connection available\". The same happened after turning off and on again the PC.\nTo solve this, I've just unplugged the usb-stick and plugged it again in the same usb port after few seconds. Et voilà, the connection was available again.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Personal Data Recovery on my Computer I was previously using Windows 8.1 I had two partitions. My OS was located on the C:/ (primary) drive, and all my personal data was located on the D:/ (secondary) drive. I have now installed Ubuntu 14.04, and I am not able to find the D Drive or my data.\nIs it possible to restore my data by any means? Please help!\nRegards,\nDeepak\n\nA: Firstly, you need to find out what partitions you have on your computer now: From a command line, type sudo fdisk -l which should yield a list, hopefully along the lines of /dev/sda1, AND /dev/sda2 or similar.   \nIf it does have both, then your data is safe in /dev/sda2 & you just need to get it to show up somewhere useful.\nTry mkdir tmp ; sudo mount /dev/sda2 tmp (you may need to substitute sda2 with something else, depending on step 1 above's results); check out the contents of your new tmp directory.   \nIf it doesn't, ie you only see the one partition, then the partition has been marked deleted - but probably not damaged yet.\nIn this case, STOP using it, reboot from the installation CD or USB, and grab a large removable drive with space to put your files. Make sure you connect to internet, and download a retrieval utility (I would recommend foremost - sudo apt-get install foremost which will hunt through the ENTIRE drive & copy anything it recognises & save it to the external drive - but without the original names... a big job for you. Next time, keep a backup!\n\nA: You most likely erased your disk before you installed. \nIf this is the case, I would suggest one of a number of data recovery tools. If you have the ability to create a live USB or CD, you can use one of the tools listed HERE. \nThese should be able to recover your data, provided you haven't overwritten it during or after the installation. There really is never a 100% guarantee when it comes to data recovery (unless you work for the NSA), but these are definitely worth a try. \n", "Q: speed up bash script by starting several instances in a for loop I have this script: \n for i in `find ! -newermt \"2016-02-13\" -name \"*svgz\"`; do\n  inkscape --verb FitCanvasToDrawing --verb FileSave --verb FileClose ${i} --verb FileQuit\ndone\n\nwhich waits for inkscape to finish its job and then restarts it with the next file. I would like to have four instances of inkscape run in parallel to speed up the process (I have ~ 5,000 files to process). Is that possible, and if yes, how?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Try GNU Parallel.\nsudo aptitude install parallel\n\nI haven't used it in a while but its command line should be similar to the one below:\nfind ! -newermt \"2016-02-13\" -name \"*svgz\" | \\\n  parallel -j4 \\\n    inkscape \\\n    --verb FitCanvasToDrawing \\\n    --verb FileSave \\\n    --verb FileClose {} \\\n    --verb FileQuit\n\nwhere 4 is the number of processes that you want to run at any given time.\n\nA: You can use GNU parallel, as explained here for a very similar question also involving inkscape:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/26572397/how-to-process-20k-svg-files-with-inkscape-cli-mode-align-and-merge-objects\nAnother simple trick I used myself recently is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a shellscript \"process.sh\" processing a single file passed as\nargument to it.\n\n*Store the result of the find command in a text file\n\n*Split the file using the \"split\" command into as many jobs as you want\nto run in parallel.\n\n*Run multiple instances of process.sh passing\narguments to it via the generated split files and xargs.\n\nA: Here's how I would approach this. Since I do not have same files, the example code bellow aims to open 4 text files with gedit. \nHow does this work ? Well, first we find the files in the hard-coded location where the files may be stored ( FILEPATH variable ). Then we pass it on to while read structure. Note the use of -print0 and IFS= read -d''. This is very common in bash programming to eliminate  problematic filenames that contain spaces, unprintable characters, etc.\nEach gedit file & calls gedit being detatched from the script with &. That makes while loop go on without stopping.\nWhat does make the loop stop is the COUNT variable. Once we count from 0 to some number divisible by 4, the MOD variable , which is calculated from modulus operator, will become 0. Now the shell will wait for a popup ( which is zenity ) to confirm spawning 4 more windows . That way we count 4 times, reset variable, continue.\nThe only disadvantage here is that find does not sort the files, so they won't necessarily be in the named order. If order matters, the code will need additional instructions. Otherwise, this is sufficient.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nFILEPATH=\"/home/xieerqi/MYTEXTFILES\"\nCOUNT=0\n\nfind $FILEPATH -type f -name \"*.txt\" -print0 | \\\nwhile IFS= read -d ''  FILE;\ndo\n    gedit $FILE & \n    COUNT=$(( $COUNT+1 ))\n    MOD=$(( $COUNT % 4 ))\n\n    if [ $MOD -eq 0   ]\n    then \n        zenity --question --text \"Open 4 more files?\"  || exit\n    fi\ndone\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to move directory in the encrypted home to a second disk and keep the encryption ? I have an install with home encryption (ecryptfs), it works fine, but am running out of space on that first disk, I have a second disk plugged in and formatted to ext4. Is it possible to use the same mechanism used by the encrypted home (pam+unlock-passphrase+mount) for some folders on that disk, for example Images. I want to avoid having to type a password twice. If possible I would like to avoid an encrypted file-system since there will probably be multiple users. \nAm looking into customizing ecryptfs-setup-private, but if there is a simpler way, thanks for pointing to it !\n\nA: Creating a new encrypted folder and moving the files into it should work, it maintains them in an encrypted state on-disk the whole time. But it's the automatic decrypt on login that may be a problem. \nCreating a custom PAM module that can take the login passphrase and use it to decrypt/mount anything else (eCryptFS, EncFS, LUKS, etc) would be a general purpose solution...\nNormally, ecryptfs-setup-private would work, but eCryptFS does not support nested encrypted folders (one eCryptFS with one key, inside another eCryptFS with a different key) so having an encrypted home may cause problems, but you can try a few other answers and see if one works:\n\nScript inside your home that runs at login\nSince your home's already encrypted, having a script there isn't as bad as usual, you could even keep the passphrase in plaintext in the script too (normally a terrible idea, but encrypted home).\n\n\n*\n\n*From How do I mount an eCryptFS encrypted partition on login?\n\n*Extra/general info How to run a command at login?\nFirst, get a script to run at login:\n\n\n*\n\n*A .desktop file in ~/.config/autostart will get run on login, telling it to run a bash script that mounts your encrypted folder should work. Since your home is already encrypted, you could store the other mount passphrase in the bash script, not perfect security but still encrypted on disk, if you didn't want to enter it each time.  For example ~/.config/autostart/test.desktop. A very basic one like this should work:\n    [Desktop Entry]\n    Type=Application\n    Exec=/home/user/.config/autostart/runme.sh\n\nOr to wait a few seconds before starting (ex. give the desktop time to initialize before prompting for a passphrase) and run as root, try this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nExec=sudo bash -c \"sleep 5; /home/user/.config/autostart/runme.sh\"\n\n\n*Then, find a script to decrypt your other folder. If you're using EncFS then it would only be basically one line, but eCryptFS is different. The easiest might be to (temporarily) create a new user, have that user run ecryptfs-migrate-home or ecryptfs-setup-private and then copy the resulting encrypted folder to your new location. \nThe following script assumes it's a second encrypted home you want to mount:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# ecryptfs-mount-single\n# Modified by Xen2050 from:\n#\n#    ecryptfs-recover-private\n#    Copyright (C) 2010 Canonical Ltd.\n#\n#    Authors: Dustin Kirkland <kirkland@ubuntu.com>\n#\n#    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n#    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n#    the Free Software Foundation, version 2 of the License.\n#\n#    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n#    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n#    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

As you say the files become \"locked\" after the copying fails. Although I do not know why this happens, I do know a temporary fix, to regain access to these files. Using your Ubuntu terminal, you should be able to use chown or change-owner. This command is executed as follows:\nsudo chown -R user:user ./PATH/TO/SERVER/FILE \n\nRemember to format it correctly to use your information. replace user:user with your_username:your_username. Also change ./PATH/TO/SERVER/FILE to the directory location of the \"locked\" file.

Can Ubuntu use an integrated GPU & sound card? And how about my Camera, Microphone, etc? If anyone has some insight, I would appreciate any feedback.\n\nA: I installed Ubuntu 15.10 on a Lenovo Thinkpad T460, and then upgraded it to 16.04. I've been using it for a few weeks, and these are the only problems I've hit:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I upgraded from 15.10 to 16.04, Ubuntu started hanging whenever I move my mouse cursor off the HDMI external monitor onto the primary display. If I permanently remove the external monitor, then it everything is fine. This bug can be fixed if you manually upgrade to a newer kernel. This isn't as scary as it sounds, just a bunch of wgets then a \"dpgk -i\": http://linuxdaddy.com/blog/install-kernel-4-4-on-ubuntu/. Be sure to follow the correct 32 or 64 bit instructions on that page! More about this bug here Laptop freezes after connecting external monitor, since 16.04 update and here https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg/+bug/1559308.\n\n*The audio is sometimes slightly crackly, as if overloaded. It especially emits a crackle when the login screen displays and makes its quick bongo noise, as if the audio system has just been activated and isn't quite ready for business. I haven't noticed any problems while playing music though.\n\n*Twice in the month or so I've been using it, the wifi device has disappeared from Ubuntu's knowledge. Each time, after a few reboots, it reappeared again. Otherwise it's been rock solid. Who knows whether this is software or my hardware?\n\n*On 15.10, there was a bug which prevented long presses or drags when using the physical buttons of the trackpad. This has been fixed in the latest 16.04 updates (and maybe in 15.10 too, I don't know.)\n\n*Closing the lid would hang instead of suspend, but this problem has been fixed now.\n\nA: I tried Lenovo T460 with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, 15.10, and 16.04 Beta 2 and they all had two issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using an external monitor would freeze the system. (I tried many combinations, e.g. plug-in then turn on, plug-in at login screen, different cables, etc)\n\n*Closing the lid would cause the system to freeze and not go to sleep.\n\n\nAfter updating to linux kernel 4.5 you can attach an HDMI monitor, but mini Display Port (mDP) will still cause the system to freeze, and closing the lid still causes the system to freeze.\nFor more details, see my comment on the \"Official T460s Ubuntu support\" ticket.\n\nA: I tried 16.04 on a T560. \nOverall it's been good. Here are the irritants:\nAfter some months, there came some video issues: screen capture tools snapped the wrong images, flicker on some video playback, that kind of thing. I \"solved\" the problem by converting from default propritary video drivers to open source drivers, but this has had the down side of halving the battery life and making the laptop run hot. I'm reverting.\nThe track pad has been vastly too sensitive. I've turned it off and switched to using the nub.\nThe middle mouse key stays clicked about 15 times a day, even when the button is released. This is probably a hardware problem specific to my machine, though. \nOverall, it's a good machine, and I would buy it again. \n", "Q: compare two xls file to remove duplicate rows I have two xls files of 8MB and 10MB. I have to merge them and remove duplicate rows. (Both files have unique rows but after merging there will be duplicate rows).\nI have tried merging the files, but the two files won't merge because of large size.\nIs there any method in Ubuntu to remove the duplicates from the files, considering my situation? \nNote :- If without merging the file the duplication can be removed, it would also be acceptable.\nMy attempt after the suggestions :-\n I  converted  both the file in csv. Then I copied the one file to another, then removed the duplication using advanced filter. Then I saved the new(combined) csv to xls format. But when I reopened the new(combined) xls file, it won't show all the data. It showed only 60% of the data.  \nThe new(combined) csv file is 24MB and when I am saving it as xls file, the xls file size is 11MB \n\nA: Libreoffice:  Data → Filter → Advanced Filter → Options → Duplicate rows disabled\nYou can copy contents of both files into a sheet, remove the duplicates and create 2 new files if you want. That would need some kind of marker in the sheet so you can see file 2 started. \nNo special magic needed.\n\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu 16.04 run Unity 8 on the desktop?

But you should also be aware that you would be installing beta software, and it may have a few issues.\n", "Q: How to set Japanese as input source? I am trying to learn Japanese, and I thought that as a part of this it would be good if my computer allowed me to type in Japanese, however after installing the Japanese language packs and setting my Input Sources section to also have Japanese, when I switch to Japanese typing, unlike with other languages except English of course, it just types in the English alphabet.

I had Windows and Ubuntu both installed in UEFI mode. Then I installed 32-bit Ubuntu (there was no UEFI partition in the list of partition types, so I just installed it as is without specifying UEFI partition). So now I have 3 OS. The problem is: when I trying to load laptop in UEFI mode there are only Windows, to load Linux'es I should turn on Legacy mode. I want to return list of OS in UEFI mode.\n\nA: Most modern EFIs are 64-bit. The main exceptions are some tablets and netbooks, which have 32-bit EFIs. This detail (EFI bit depth) is key because the bit depth is somewhat \"locked in\" by the bit-depth of the EFI. There are ways around this, though. I know of two, one of which has two sub-options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) -- CSM is EFI's tool for supporting older BIOS-mode boot loaders. It sounds like you installed your computer using the CSM. Ordinarily, this is a Bad Idea because it greatly complicates the boot path; however, if you really need to boot a 32-bit OS, it may be the simplest way to do so. The trouble is getting it to co-exist with 64-bit EFI-mode OS installations, since switching between the boot modes (BIOS/CSM/legacy vs. EFI/UEFI) is tricky. I know of two ways to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the firmware's boot manager -- This is typically accessed by hitting Esc, Enter, or a function key (usually F8 or higher) early in the boot process. You can then select between named EFI boot loaders and BIOS-mode boots of disks. This is usually an awkward solution.\n\n*Use rEFInd -- My rEFInd can switch from its native EFI-mode boot to a BIOS-mode boot. This ability is disabled by default on PCs, though; you must edit refind.conf and uncomment the scanfor option, ensuring that hdbios is among the options. Thereafter, you should see a boot menu option for performing a BIOS-mode boot.\n\n\n*Use GRUB -- GRUB can't switch from EFI-mode to BIOS-mode booting (or vice-versa); but it can load a 32-bit kernel from a 64-bit boot, or vice-versa. Ideally, typing sudo update-grub from the 64-bit, EFI-mode Ubuntu should cause it to detect the 32-bit kernel from your new installation and add it to the menu. If not, you may need to do some manual reconfiguration. Note that this is pretty \"bleeding-edge\" stuff, so it may not work easily or as you expect. I've never done it myself.\n\n\nBefore ending, I'd like to question why you're trying to boot a 32-bit OS. In most cases, there's no need for this. Even if you depend upon some old 32-bit-only binary, you can usually get it to run in a modern 64-bit Ubuntu via compatibility libraries.\nIf you really do need to run a 32-bit distribution, it may be better to do so inside a virtual machine (VirtualBox, QEMU, VMware, etc.). This practice will eliminate the need for any boot loader hoop-jumping, and is likely to be a little safer overall (although you've already repartitioned, which is part of the risk).\n", "Q: wrong icons on desktop As a result of some misconfiguration, I had to redo a number of things in my Kubuntu 14.04 system.

I have three partitions on a connected hard drive that were all shared in 12.04. After upgrading, I only have one shared. The other two refuse to be shared. Attempting to set file sharing results in:\n'net usershare' returned error 255: net usershare add: failed to add share 3tb2-extra. Error was Operation not permitted \nUsing the command \"chown :smbuser /Media/main1/3TB2-Extra\", results in: \nchown: invalid group: ‘:smbuser’ \nWhen using gksu Nautilus, file settings cannot be changed.\nHow can I fix this file sharing problem?\n\nA: Change the ownership with the command:\nsudo chown user:group /path/to/disk/folder -R\n\nwhere user - your username, group - a group the user is belonging to.\nSample:\nsudo chown marthy:marthy /Media/main1/3TB2-Extra/* -R\n\nFor accessing files locally the samba does not need to be running.\n\nA: SOLVED:\nAfter upgrading I lost the ability to set up a \"shared\" folder. The folder would not hold the share designation or would refuse to be shared and report a 255 error. The answer to the question of setting up lost shares is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*The upgrade from 12.04 to 14.04.3 changed, either the folder permissions or how Samba works with file sharing (I'm still not positive).\n\n*What I found was that some folders had full read, write, execute (rwx) permissions and some did not. I discovered that Samba needs full rwx permissions ... including \"Everybody\". This means that EVERY folder in the path needs FULL rwx permissions. (This was written about in the help above, by Kukulo.  Thank you!)\n\n*To accomplish this investigation and final resolve, I downloaded a GUI application called \"Uprawnienia\" (which means Permissions in Polish) from the Ubuntu Software Centre. This is a graphical application that lets a person, visually, make changes to the user, group, and permissions of any file or folder at the Root level (requiring Root password).\n\n*Using Uprawnienia I dragged and dropped each folder (that was in the path) into the application and changed it's permissions until I was able to share the folder over the network. In my case the path was \"/media/main/3TB2-Extra\". I changed the permissions of (going backwards) 3TB2-Extra, then main, then media. By doing this I discovered that the permissions of each folder in the path needs to be set to full rwx for owner (rwx), group (rwx), and everybody (rwx). The octal for this is 777, it's also read as drwxrwxrwx for a folder (d=folder).\n\n\nNOTE: Files within the folder DO NOT need to be changed recursively (using -R or the check box in Uprawnienia). Each file can and should have it's own permissions, depending on who needs access! My recommendation is NOT to change permissions for all of the files within a folder in this method! I use -R and now I have to change each file, one-at-a-time, to get them back to where I want them.\nMy Discovery: While many people use the terminal to change file user, group, and permissions with \"chown\" and \"chmod\" commands, then follow it up by reading those results with \"ls -l\", I will not be using the terminal from now on for these operations. It is too easy to make a mistake typing and it is too hard remembering what changes are made (especially if you typically don't use the terminal and are not a programmer). It is my personal opinion that my time can be better served and the changes make more sense when using a GUI application. I was able to overcome a very obscure and convoluted file permissions problem, only with the help of a GUI. I would recommend a GUI in any file permissions process.\n", "Q: What does the \"Show All Input Sources\" option do? I am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18, and upon launching the gnome-tweak-tool and going to the Keyboard and Mouse I find that there is an option called Show All Input Sources which is currently set to OFF I assume that this relates to the Input Sources list in the Region & Language settings? If so, when enabling this option, what exactly will it show differently? Which input sources will it should that it does not already? And why are these other input sources hidden by default anyway?\n\n\nA: Those are related to ibus (Intelligent Input Bus).\nRun ibus-setup and you will be prompted with a gui and the middle tab will show the installed \"input methods\". You can add and view input methods here. I would assume that the \"Show All Input Sources\" will show all of the installed input methods (btw: \"input methods\" is the same (but old name it seems) for \"input sources\"). \n\n'add' will show the languages\n\nkbd is an input source that provides keyboard layouts as input method methods especially for European keyboards.

And what do they do?\n\nA: *\n\n*Here is the bug report that got it added\n\n*It points to this document (The link has images to explain it). From the link:\n\n\nSoftware button areas\nOn most clickpads, this is the default behavior. The bottom of the touchpad is split in the middle to generate left or right button events on click. The height of the button area depends on the hardware but is usually around 10mm.\nLeft, right and middle button events can be triggered as follows:\n\n*\n\n*if a finger is in the main area or the left button area, a click generates left button events.\n\n*if a finger is in the right area, a click generates right button events.\n\n*if there is a finger in both the left and right button area, a click generates middle button events.\n\n\n= area = default for non-Apple\n\nClickfinger behavior\nThis is the default behavior on Apple touchpads. Here, a left, right, middle button event is generated when one, two, or three fingers are held down on the touchpad when a physical click is generated. The location of the fingers does not matter and there are no software-defined button areas.\n\n= fingers = default for Apple\n\nThe other 2 have not got a definition on it. \"default\" will be what the hardware is expecting. So when you use a none-Apple it does \"fingers\" otherwise it does \"area\". \"none\" I would guess it disables clicking the touchpad.\n", "Q: SSH jump + Lock User account on remote machine, but allow user to use sudo? I am trying to configure a server that users will log into. Users will use this server as a box to jump into other servers via ssh. From jump server to others will use SSH key based authentication. The users are not allowed to login directly to the other servers. Hence, they need to go from the jump server to the others. The user accounts are locked \"usermod -L username\" on all other servers.\nI have ran into a problem where these users also need to be able to use \"sudo\" on the other servers. The current problem is that when users are on one of the other servers and try to use sudo they get an error when entering the password \"sorry, try again\", even though the password is correct. This makes sense because I have locked the user account, preventing direct SSH login. The users are in the sudoers file.\nDoes anyone know how I could setup the other servers so they would allow the users to SSH only via key based from the jump server and allow the users to use sudo on the other servers(non-jump).\nAny help would be greatly appreciated and thanks for your time.\n\nA: You could either implement SSH Agent Forwarding. Or if you are using a jumphost for SSH Access, then, its best for you to use iptables or ufw on the other servers to ONLY allow SSH access to the specific IP (which is the jumphost ip address).\nIPTABLES SETUP:\niptables -I INPUT -p tcp -s YourIP --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\n\nInstallation of UFW:\nsudo apt-get install ufw\nsudo ufw enable\nsudo ufw allow from 15.15.15.51 to any port 22 ---- Change 15.15.15.51 to the jumphost IP Address\n\nAlso, on the other servers, edit the sshd config and prohibit root login to better implement security.\nSome server shells doesn't automatically ask for password. So you might as well install \"ask-pass\" so users can use their password.\nOne last thing, to easily manage users on this setup, make sure to create a group and include it on the sudoers (without password) then restart SSH. This grouping should be implement on those \"other servers\" and not on the jumphost server\n\nA: This issue was resolved by adding the following match config to the sshd_config file. This config was placed on all the servers where direct access was not allowed.\nMatch User user1,user2,user3\nPasswordAuthentication no\n\nNow the users can access via key based authentication from the jump server to destination servers, they cannot access the destination servers directly with SSH and sudo still works for the users on the destination servers.\n", "Q: Internet not working through Ethernet Previously it was working fine, But after re-installing ubuntu this problem emerged.

Unfortunately, it ceased to function after installation and boot from HD, but after a quick DL of FWwrapper and the installation of proper drivers, it worked like a charm.\nTL;DR:  Ditch the Ath9k card and get something else.\n\nA: The only thing odd that I could see in the output is that your wireless NIC speed is 1 Mb/s (line 143). You need to determine if this is an issue with your AP or your wireless NIC. \nTo check if it's with your AP, do other devices on your network get fast speeds?  Also, try booting into a Live CD and running a speed test from there. If both of these work without issues, then you've ruled out the AP, and your hardware. So it's probably a setting within your current install.\nIf you include the output from iw info it will show the speeds supported by your wireless NIC (perhaps it has been set to the 1 Mb/s somehow and isn't coming off that speed). Try those and let us know.\n\nA: Since network connections is showing you connected at 65Mb/s which makes no sense and isn't supported by your 1, 2*, 5.5*, 11*, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 56 Mbps.

However only while using it inside the upstart configuration file I am having this issue.\nThanks!\n\nA: Thanks for the comments it helped me troubleshoot the actual issue. \nAs steeldriver mentioned shopt is a bash builtin and sinceupstart uses /bin/sh by default and it is symlinked to dash, therefore shopt wasn't working.\nAlso the script in which shopt worked was a bash script (hope it answers bodho.zazen's question). \nAfter some research what I did was enclose my shopt command like this in the script section, and this worked -\nscript \n\n/bin/bash <<'EOF'\n  <my-code>\n  shopt -s nullglob\n  <my-code>\nEOF\n\nend script\n\nThanks to all of you for helping me out! :)  \n", "Q: Controlling CPU frequency I have a Dell Latitude e6410 what has i5-520M processor.\nIt's running between 1.2-2.4 GHz. I think my turbo is switched off. How could I turn on to achive ~3 GHz? In my previous laptop I simply used that command to turn on the turbo, but now I don't have that directory.\necho 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo\n\nSome info about my computer. \n\nA: Ensure that no turbo is disabled (as you have already done), and the CPU is allowed to run at 100%:\necho 0 | sydo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo\necho 100 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct\n\nThe highest turbo frequency kicks in only if the thermal conditions are correct. Depending on the CPU model, different turbo levels are possible depending on the type of load and number of CPUs loaded.  You may find just 1 CPU can run at 100% turbo, where as with two or more CPUs there maximum turbo speed is less than 100%; it really depends on many of the variable characteristics of the processor design and kind of load.\n", "Q: Create multiple files from a template referencing a single txt file and touch I've used touch for single creation of blank files and multiple blank files from a list using cat foo.txt | xargs touch plus I ran across How to create multiple files with the Terminal? but I'm having issues figuring out how I can implement the creation of files that use a template from a list of files with pure bash.\nFile names in foo.txt file:\ncpt-one.php\ncpt-two.php\ncpt-three.php\n\ntemplate.txt:\n// lots of code\n\nIs there a way I can use touch to create the file's from the list using what's in template.txt instead of creating a blank file?\n\nA: A bash-esque way to do it (without an explicit loop) might be\n\n\n*\n\n*read the filenames into a shell array variable\nmapfile -t files < foo.txt\n\nor its synonym readarray -t files < foo.txt\n\n*expand the array inside a tee command\ntee < template.txt -- \"${files[@]}\" > /dev/null\n\n[The > /dev/null is optional - it just hides tee's default standard output from the terminal.]\n\nA: Unless you have thousands of files that you need to create, you can use brace expansion:\n$> touch cpt-{one,two,three}.php\n$> ls\ncpt-one.php  cpt-three.php  cpt-two.php\n\nSince your objective is to clone template , use tee to redirect stdin to multiple files. tee writes to both file and stdout, so you will see it echoed  on the terminal\n$> cat template.txt  | tee cpt-{one,two,three}.php                             \nI'm template\n\nAlternatively , one could use while read structure.  with shell redirection.\n$> rm *\n$> vi inputFile.txt\n$> while read FILE; do touch \"$FILE\" ; done < inputFile.txt\n$> ls\ncpt-one  cpt-three  cpt-two  inputFile.txt\n\nNote well, that this is a simple example, that assumes entries in the file contain no special chars\nNow, since you actually want to copy single file in to multiple, you can use the same structure, to cp /path/to/template \"$FILE\"\n$> ls\ninputFile.txt  template.txt\n$> cat template.txt                                                            \nI'm template\n$> while read FILE; do cp template.txt \"$FILE\" ; done < inputFile.txt            \n$> cat cpt-one.php                                                             \nI'm template\n$> \n\n", "Q: Building a GCC Cross Compiler I'm trying to follow the Bare Bones tutorial on the OS Dev wiki but I'm confused on how to build the GCC cross compiler.

However, by definition, only one adapter may communicate on the network at a time in the Ethernet network topology. Therefore, both adapters cannot be transmitting at the same time and must wait if another device on the network is transmitting. Additionally, broadcast messages must be handled by each adapter because both are listening on the same network. This configuration requires significant overhead, excluding any protocol-related issues. This configuration does not offer a good method for providing a redundant network adapter for the same network. \nthe pc will only use one nic to connect to the internet\nBUT you can always load balance there are lots of ways to do that using fancy stuff with routing protocols or do some cool stuff within linux.\nsudo apt-get install ifenslave\n\nthen edit the /etc/network/interfaces file\nlike this\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n\nauto bond0\niface bond0 inet static\naddress 192.168.0.13\ngateway 192.168.0.1\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nbond-mode balance-alb\nbond-miimon 100\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet manual\nbond-master bond0\n\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet manual\nbond-master bond0\n\nand that's about it now your traffic will be load balanced through two interfaces\n", "Q: Error when trying to install AMD drivers I have Lenovo thinkpad S440.

Your Windows installation uses the Windows Logical Disk Manager (LDM) configuration, aka \"dynamic disks,\" indicated in MBR by a type-0x42 partition type. Ubuntu doesn't play nice with this Microsoft-specific partition type.

Also, would installing things like graphics card drivers install the same as in Ubuntu or the Fedora way. I don't think the kernel would change this but I just wanna be sure. Thanks for any help. Also the things that don't work in Ubuntu on my motherboard are the Ethernet and the 3.0 usb. the graphics don't work either but i figured out how to fix that problem.\n\nA: The Fedora kernel is unlikely to work well with Ubuntu as the kernels are not in sync between the distros and each distro has applied distro specific patches such as apparmor in Ubuntu and Selinux in Fedora.\nYou are probably better off compiling a custom kernel from the ubuntu repositories using the ubuntu patches. \nBetter, what problem are you having with which ubuntu kernel ?\n", "Q: Can't boot Xubuntu on my laptop I have an old Asus eeePc series 900 (1 Gb RAM, Intel Celeron-M)\nI tried yesterday to install Xubuntu on it, 'cause it was marked as one of the most lightweight ubuntu distros.\nI made a live usb on my other pc (running windows) using LiLi usb creator v2.9.3 (i downloaded the distro directly from it)\nNow the problem is that I'm able to boot the usb (i disabled secureboot from bios and marked the usb as the primary hard drive), but all I get is the distro blue logo. It seems like it is booting or uploading something, but after over 8 hours of loading screen i decided to ask you for some advice. \nIs it normal for the boot part to take so long?

Select your USB-stick as the boot device. And Xubuntu should start now and you can install it on your internal SSD-disk (or continue to use the stick as a Linux Live OS).\n\nA: Do you have UEFI firmware (if you have SecureBoot, you might have a UEFI system). If you do, then instead of using LiLi, format your USB stick to FAT32 and just copy the contents of the Xubuntu ISO file to it (don't copy the ISO file directly, extract the contents into the USB stick). Then just try to boot from it. This worked for me even on my old computer without UEFI, so you might want to try it regardless of it. But this does not always work.\nAnd as @Elder Geek said, you should probably change your primary HDD back to the internal SSD.\n", "Q: Only Show an Xfce4 Panel While YouTube Is Launched My middle monitor has a panel with a clock at the bottom.

I am currently using 14.04.3 LTS and running 3.13.0-79-generic (released 19 February 2016) on a notebook.\nIs this the latest kernel?, and as a rule of thumb should we be using the latest kernel?\nI've also heard that we should use the kernel that best suits the system we are running. Slightly confused, if this means using an older kernel if there are issues using the latest kernel on a particular system.\n\nA: This question is definitely opinion-based. As a general rule, any time you say 'what (piece of software or hardware) SHOULD I use for (x task)?' you're going to have a WIDE variety of responses.\nFor example, some people are going to tell you it's better to partition drives with Gparted, while others may tell you to buy and upgrade some off the wall shareware you've never heard of before, while yet others may tell you it's best to just do it all manually from the command line. \nI tend to always use the latest stable version (and occasionally, beta) of EVERYTHING, so if you ask me personally, I'm going to tell you that the latest is almost always best. But for certain niches of application, the latest may have bugs that haven't been worked out yet, or may have removed support for some functionality or software that you would consider essential to your own Linux use. \nTherefore, the 'answer' here is that there IS no answer that applies to everyone. My best advice is trial and error. Read the release notes, know the differences, load them up, update your GRUB, and try them all out one by one. If 3.13 works better for you, then use it. If 4.2 works better, use it. This level of freedom is one of the major reasons Linux has been so successful. \nIt's up to you. \n\nA: Ubuntu LTS releases offer multiple kernels in official repositories.\nAt the moment kernels 3.13, and 4.4 are available for Ubuntu 14.04.\nBoth of them get security updates and bug fixes.\nIn general there is no need to upgrade a kernel to another major version if you do not add some new hardware that is not supported by older kernel versions, or need some new kernel features.\nKernel 3.13 is slightly \"better\", because it will be supported till 14.04 EOL in 2019. \nYou can always install the 4.4 kernel by\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-xenial\n\n\nA: Here's a handy kernel performance comparison done by the Phoronix team, testing various kernels in different tasks (SQL, compiling, encoding, video framerate, etc).\nLinux 3.5 Through Linux 4.4 Kernel Benchmarks: A 19-Way Kernel Showdown Shows Some Regressions\nIt really depends on the tasks you're using your hardware for, and what kind of hardware you have.\nFor example, I have an old laptop with a 32-bit Pentium dual-core processor and maxed-out at 2Gb RAM. Kernel 4.4 runs great, but 3.13 runs better. Since my hardware is old, newer versions probably won't add any features nor improve performance that much (as seen on the regressions found during testing), so I'm sticking with the Trusty (3.13) kernel over the newer 4.4.\nJust my 2 cents.\n", "Q: Disable USB autosuspend for Wester Digital My Passport Ultra I recognize this question has been asked on these forums before but I'm having no luck with any of the solutions.

Users within a group can read, write, or execute files owned by that group.\nEach user and group has a unique numerical identification number called a userid (UID) and agroupid (GID) respectively.\nA user who creates a file is also the owner and group owner of that file. The file is assigned separate read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, the group, and everyone else. The file owner can be changed only by the root user as well as access permissions can be changed by both the root user and the owner of the file.\nSource : http://www.bayt.com/en/specialties/q/110533/what-is-the-difference-between-a-user-group-and-others-in-red-hat-linux-what-is-the-use-of-group-ownership-amp-user-ownership-of-a-file-or-folder/\n\nA: User is an account, either for real person or a daemon software. You can log in with your user account, or others using su. \nGroups can be thought of as levels of privilege. A person who is part of a group can view or modify files belonging to that group, depending on the permissions of that file. User belonging to a group has privilleges of that group, for example - sudo groups lets you run software as super user. \n\nA: Multiple users can use privileges of a group. For example if a group has permission to read, write or execute one particular file or folder, or change one specific setting, all the users within that group will inherit this privilege.\nYou can find different kinds of privileges that a user or a group may have or not here\n\nA: If you are new to Linux/Unix, then the concept of permissions may be confusing. This Link will provide you with an explanation of what permissions are, how they work, and how to manage them. A number of examples will be provided to illustrate how to set and change permissions for both users and \ngroups.\nhttps://www.linode.com/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups\n", "Q: Node on Snappy Ubuntu Does Snappy Ubuntu support Node.js?\nI need to run a node server on Ubuntu core.

As a quick fix I rolled back the driver , but would like to know if this affects my system security in any way?\nUsing 64 bit Ubuntu 14.04 - 3.19.0-47-generic\n\nA: It does not affect your security any more as staying with that old version would have done.\nThe rollback does not do anything special.\nTo find out whether the specific update you rolled back or omitted contains severe security patches, look at the changelog of that version you rejected. Therefore visit http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/main/l/linux/ and select the respective version directory, then open the changelog file and examine it:\nIt will contain sections starting with the kernel update version as headline. Those below are the first two sections of the changelog of 4.2.0-30.36 as example:\nlinux (4.2.0-30.36) wily; urgency=high\n\n  [ Kamal Mostafa ]\n\n  * Release Tracking Bug\n    - LP: #1550037\n\n  [ Upstream Kernel Changes ]\n\n  * drm/vmwgfx: Fix an fb unlocking bug\n    - LP: #1548587\n\n -- Kamal Mostafa <kamal@canonical.com>  Thu, 25 Feb 2016 15:02:05 -0800\n\nlinux (4.2.0-30.35) wily; urgency=low\n\n  [ Seth Forshee ]\n\n  * SAUCE: cred: Add clone_cred() interface\n    - LP: #1531747, #1534961, #1535150\n    - CVE-2016-1575 CVE-2016-1576\n  * SAUCE: overlayfs: Use mounter's credentials instead of selectively\n    raising caps\n    - LP: #1531747, #1534961, #1535150\n    - CVE-2016-1575 CVE-2016-1576\n  * SAUCE: overlayfs: Skip permission checking for trusted.overlayfs.*\n    xattrs\n    - LP: #1531747, #1534961, #1535150\n    - CVE-2016-1575 CVE-2016-1576\n  * SAUCE: overlayfs: Be more careful about copying up sxid files\n    - LP: #1534961, #1535150\n    - CVE-2016-1575 CVE-2016-1576\n  * SAUCE: overlayfs: Propogate nosuid from lower and upper mounts\n    - LP: #1534961, #1535150\n    - CVE-2016-1575 CVE-2016-1576\n\n -- Luis Henriques <luis.henriques@canonical.com>  Fri, 19 Feb 2016 10:25:02 +0000\n\n[...many more lines...]\n\nAs you can see, each changelog contains all previous changelogs as well. The latest changes are on the top. Just take a look at the first line, the headline of the most recent change:\nlinux (4.2.0-30.36) wily; urgency=high\n\nYou notice the urgency=high? That means it's an important security update which you should not omit if the system is attackable (which all systems connected to a public network or using removable media are) and you care for security. \nOf course you must check that for your own specific kernel version, as I don't know it. You find the running kernel version using uname -r, or the exact version (including the number after the .) using apt-cache policy linux-image-generic.\n\nA: I will second Byte Commander's answer above, and add two basic points of simplification for those who may be confused by all the code / changelog references:\n\n\n*\n\n*As I understand it, not all security updates are kernel dependent. As packages are updated, sometimes security updates are made to individual packages instead of the kernel itself. Even if you roll back your kernel, you're still getting the benefits of new security updates for those packages. \n\n*It really depends on your specific kernel, the kernel you're rolling back to, any system-wide changes or additions you may have made, and the existing security of the other software / hardware you're using, including your network. When a major security update is made to a kernel, it may or may not apply on all hardware or on all networks / network types. Obviously, sometimes, major security holes are fixed that apply on all or almost all systems, but as Byte Commander said, the best thing to do is to read the relevant release notes / changelogs to find out if this applies to you. \n\n", "Q: How to add MP3 encoder in sound Converter ubuntu 15.10, 14.10 or 14.04 I have installed sound converter from Ubuntu 15.10 repository.

I'm moving across from Mac OSX and am quite used to using the Cmd-Q shortcut to quit apps. I appreciate that Linux is set up differently and that different apps have different shortcuts for quitting (e.g. some use Ctrl-Q while others might be Alt-Q, etc.). I'm currently using Ubuntu GNOME.\nWould it be possible to create a standard keyboard shortcut for quitting all apps easily and safely in Ubuntu? I'm happy to use a third-party tool or do a bit of further digging.\nM\n\nA: Gracefully close a window\nThe simplest would be to add the following command to a shortcut key of your choice:\nwmctrl -c :ACTIVE:\n\nwmctrl is not installed by default:\nsudo apt-get install wmctrl\n\nfrom man wmctrl:\n-c <WIN>\n    Close the window <WIN> gracefully\n\nGracefully closing a window means that if you e.g. made changes to the currently opened file, you will be asked if you want to save the changes etc. This is similar to the Cmnd + Qyou are used to.\nTo add it to a shortcut key\nChoose: System Settings > \"Keyboard\" > \"Shortcuts\" > \"Custom Shortcuts\". Click the \"+\" and add the command:\nwmctrl -c :ACTIVE:\n\nOr, if you are comfortable with Alt + F4\nEven much simpler, as mentioned by @Takkat (thanks!), you can simply press Alt + F4\n\nA: using CTRL Q works to quit an application in Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: Many tabs etc in applications can be closed with ctrl + w, I set \"close applciation\" shortcut to ctrl + shift + W (which is same as for example chrome to close all, same with vscode) to quit any application. Extremely convenient (Ubuntu Budgie 20.04). I think default otherwise is alt + f4. Not so convenient\n\nA: Under gnome 40, if you go to settings, keyboard, keyboard shortcuts, windows there is the shortcut Close window that is by default Alt F4 but you can customize.\n\nA: For me, it was super + q and I changed it to Ctrl + q :D\nI am on Debian Bullseye.\nCheers!\n", "Q: Consecutive commands in crontab I'm running a software which needs specific rights for different subfolders.

Is this possible and maybe even preferred?\n\nA: It is very possible, and a very good idea, because if anything goes very wrong, you can reinstall it easily. The fact that each OS has its own HDD is good, too, since it gives you more control over each of them.\n", "Q: How to change the passphrase for a private directory encrypted with ecryptfs I set up a ~/Private directory, but now i want to change the passphrase i used.

The problem is that you aren't making the AwesomeWM client fullscreen.

I accidentally restored a set of files (around 15-20 in total) from the trash, instead of deleting them (sic). Is there a way to undo this process or to find which files were restored to which directory, so that I can then delete those unnecessary files?\n\nA: Not that I am aware of. Unfortunately, the .trashes file stores the location of the file until you either erase it or restore it. You're probably not going to find an easier way to do it other than to find the files and erase them again. Doing ctrl+z could have solved your issue the moment it happened, but it's probably too late for that.\n", "Q: Trouble with commands in rc.local I'm trying to add the following commands to rc.local:\niptables -A OUTPUT -m owner --gid-owner vpnroute \\! -o tun0 -j REJECT\n\n-g vpnroute transmission-gtk\n\nThis is to force transmission to only use my vpn and then launch it. \nVpnroute group is present and lc.local is owned by root and can be executed. \nHave also tried to start via lxsessions startup manager with no luck.

Regarding starting transmission you should use the daemon that already comes with a rc-service script.

I use Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I tried rm 'ls', rm rf but they did not work.\n\nA: Use rm * from within the specific directory.

If you want that too, use rm -r * instead. \nBut be careful! rm deletes, it does not move to trash!\nTo be sure you delete the right files, you can use the interactive mode and it will ask for confirmation on every file with rm -i *\n\nA: rm * will, by default, delete all files with names that don't begin with .. To delete all files and subdirectories from a directory, either enable the bash dotglob option so that * matches filenames beginning with .:\nshopt -s dotglob\nrm -r *\n\n(The -r flag is needed to delete subdirectories and their contents as well.)\nOr use find:\nfind . -mindepth 1 -delete\n# or\nfind . -mindepth 1 -exec rm -r -- {} +\n\nThe -mindepth 1 option is to leave the directory itself alone.\n", "Q: How do I add a script to start up functions?

There's a instruction in that file how to get it working.\n", "Q: Play sound on all PCs in a network We have 15 PCs in our network. If there is a big meeting, we want to play a sound (from a file, just some seconds) on all PCs in our network.\nMost of them run Ubuntu, some run SuSE.\nHow can I solve this?\n\nA: Use play command to play the file. So something like ssh user@hostname play /location/of/file.mp3 on each of the PCs. If up to 5 seconds delay is alright then you can simply use a for loop to run that command from any PC. Something like for PC in list of hostnames; do ssh user@$PC \"play /location/of/file.mp3\" & done.\nSetting up public key authentication will eliminate the need for password inputting for each of the hosts.

I have configured my keyboard shortcuts so that Alt + left takes me to the work space left, and Alt + right takes me to the work space to the right, but I would rather have one set of keys to cycle. Ideally, something like\nworkspace 1 + Alt + tab ---> worskspace 2\nworkspace 2 + Alt + tab ---> worskspace 3\nworkspace 3 + Alt + tab ---> worskspace 4\nworkspace 4 + Alt + tab ---> worskspace 1\n\nThe problem is the last line.

My system is Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nA: my first guess would be the ufw settings.   in other words, the reverse ping might be prevented by the firewall on the one that is \"unreachable).  You can run \"sudo ufw status\" to check the current rules (and also whether it's enabled).\nI'm also a bit puzzled by the IP assignments.  I do something similar to this, with the router hard wired to one of the laptops, and the router (netgear) always assigns the *.1.1 address to itself.  If you've set the IP addresses internally, rather than via DHCP, then that might be a problem, too, if there is an IP address conflict on your mini-net.  I have one of the nodes set up as 1.4, and then the others get assigned higher in the mask range.  (We have up to 10 on the net, actually.)  If there is a conflict, it could actually block both directions, since one way the first step would be blocked and the other way the ACK could be blocked (because it goes the wrong place).  Make sure that there aren't any conflicts on the net, INCLUDING the router.\n", "Q: downloading trial version to a usb stick My desktop (running Ubuntu) has completely stopped working after updating from v14 to v15. I would like to download a trial version of Ubuntu to a USB stick from my laptop (running Win10), and then boot my desktop from the USB stick to see if it will recover enough to reload Ubuntu. I'm not sure how to do this without downloading to my laptop rather than to the USB stick. I don't want to corrupt Win10 on my laptop. Any advice would be appreciated.\n\nA: Downloading the Ubuntu installation program to your laptop, and burning it to USB should not in anyway affect the operation of your laptop.\nYou'll want to follow the instructions at Ubuntu's download page for creating a bootable USB, and after having created it remove it form your laptop and then use it to boot your desktop computer.  Given that you had a problem with the Ubuntu 15 upgrade, you may want to use the Ubuntu 14 download, but my suspicion would be that something added like a video driver is what 'broke' your computer.\n\nMore complete instructions:\nDownload two programs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Ubuntu 14.04.4\n\n*Download UUI\n\n*Install UUI on your laptop\n\n*Use UUI on your laptop to create a bootable USB stick using the downloaded Ubuntu 14.04.4 installation program\n\n*Boot the USB in your desktop computer, and choose 'try Ubuntu'\n\n*Using the file manager in the Ubuntu booted from USB, navigate to your hard disk...\n\n\nA: Ok, wait, what do you mean by \"recover enough\" ? You can boot from the usb stick with ubuntu with no problems, as long as neither the desktop, nor the stick is damaged. As far as I know, when booting the Ubuntu from the stick it will detect your os and if it is Ubuntu, you can repair it. Booting from a usb stick with Ubuntu will not edit anything on your hard disk, unless you tell it to (for example, you edit a file from file manager). I suggest you install Ubuntu 14.04, since it's an LTS version (Long Term Support) and because Ubuntu 16.xx LTS will be released soon.\n", "Q: What images can you store in lxd containers?

From my understanding, this is potentially a bad thing as it can damage the drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is this a bad thing?\n\n*By moving /home to the HDD, will this mitigate the problem?\n\nA: No, it is not a bad thing. I have been using a /home on my sdd for at least 2 years. \nBut I did change /home/$USER/.config/user-dirs.dirs so all my user directories point to my HDD. Those directories (like Downloads and Desktop are my 2 main areas where things get written and stored). \nI plan for failure: my SDD has -no- personal data. If it fails I buy me a new one and re-install Ubuntu. My personal stuff on my HDD that I can not restore (so addresses, a passwordsafe, vpn stuff etc and not music, movies or sofware I can re-download) are all also on 2 USB sticks.\nThe 15 minutes it takes to re-install Ubuntu onto my SDD make it worth keeping the default operating system things on it.\n\nA: If I may say something about this, having done an upgrade to an SSD on a MacBook Pro, I have the OS (Mac OS X Snow Leopard) on the SSD and my /Users folder on an HDD.\nIt is best to have the /home folder on a separate hard drive (external for laptops and internal for desktops) rather than on the SSD. Why? An SSD has a limited number of times that you can write to it and having your /home folder on the SSD is a bad idea, an SSD will actually die because it's being written to (saving your data) constantly.\nSwap is another thing you don't want to have on an SSD, for the exact same reason as the /home folder. Swap as most of us know, is used for putting the computer to sleep, it saves the data to the hard drive in the /swap partition. So, if you have an SSD and have swap enabled, remove it from the SSD, move it to the hard drive or better yet, turn it off.\n", "Q: Installation stuck at \"Creating ext4 file system\" I would like to ask for assistance in the following installation problem.\nHere I choose the option Erase disk and install Ubuntu and next Continue on Writing the changes to the disk? dialog.  \n\nThe problem is that when the installation is in that status, there is no progress and the installation cannot be completed.  \n \nIf there is another option I should follow, please let me know.\nI remain at your disposal for more details.\nI would like to edit the question, adding two more photos to ask for more instructions.\nIn this photo is the initial screen when I run GParted.\n\nWhen I click on Device, and then Create Partition table, I have the following message and I cannot continue.\n\nCould you advice how much should be the size of the partitions?\nMy disk capacity is 300 GB and the memory is 2 GB.\nWhen I try to create the new partitions I have the following error:\n\nThank you in advance,\nNikos\n\nA: Boot from Ubuntu installation media.\nSelect 'Try Ubuntu without installing'.  \nOpen GParted -> press the Windows key and type GParted.\nOpen GParted and delete all partitions you find on the disk.  \nCreate a new partition - format it with ext4 - a size that fits your needs.\nCreate a new partition - format it with swap - a size matching the RAM.  \nOn the desktop click Install Ubuntu, when asked choose Something else.\nSelect the ext4 partition you had created with GParted for Ubuntu before.\nSelect / as mount point and ext4 file system as format - start the installation.  \nUpdate addressing your comment that you receive errors and cannot create partitions :  \nOpen GParted - click on Ignore.\nClick on Device on the top menu.\nNow click on Create Partition Table.\nSelect gpt when you have UEFI BIOS.\nSelect msdos when you have legacy BIOS.\nNow you can create new partitions on the disk.  \nUpdate addressing your comment that you receive an error partition is currently active :  \nScreenshot shows that the swap partition is mounted.\nRight-click the partition sda5 and click on Swapoff.\nRight-click the partition sda2 and click Unmount.\nIn case it is not possible from Ubuntu media,\ndo it with the original GParted Live media.\n\nA: Make USB bootable and open ubuntu in try ubuntu mode.\nOpen -> Gparted select the partition in which you want to install ubuntu.\nif it is already unallocated right click on that partition to create a new partion.\n-> select partition type as ext4\n-> create partition\n\nNow your problem where you were stuck.\n-> while installing Ubuntu\n    -> select something else\n    -> select the partition in which you want to install Ubuntu double click it\n    -> select mount point as /\n\nand follow rest installation steps its done\n", "Q: How to solve this problem (404 Not Found) while updating sudo apt-get update W: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/tahutek-team/prozilla/ubuntu\n/dists/wily/main/source/Sources 404  Not Found\n\nW: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/tahutek-team/prozilla/ubuntu/dists/wily/main\n/binary-i386/Packages 404  Not Found\n\n\nA: If you look at http://ppa.launchpad.net/tahutek-team/prozilla/ubuntu/dists/, you will see that they are not mirroring the wily distribution.\nI'm not sure why your sources are set to point there though.

But when I download it in Ubuntu, it has overlapping text. Why so?\n\n\nA: One of the possible reasons for this is : Unsupported fonts.\nStep 1 : From Windows, copy this folder : C:\\Windows\\Fonts.\nStep 2 : Create a new folder in /home directory with the name .fonts (dont forget the dot \".\").\nStep 3 : Copy the content inside Fonts of Windows to .fonts and also to /use/share/fonts (if you want to use them system wide).\nStep 4 : Rebuild your font-cache with fc-cache -f -v or reboot.\nWorkaround : If you are not comfortable with LibreOffice, you can install MS Office using Wine (which is not a good idea).\n", "Q: Jstock: /usr/bin doesn't exist even if it exists Ubuntu: 14.04.4 LTS\nJava Version: 1.8.0_74\nI installed Jstock (1.0.7.13) via this:\nhttp://jstock.org/help_install_upgrade.html#install-linux\nSo I start the programm via ./jstock.sh\nWhen I start Jstock I get:\n\nWarning: /usr/bin does not exist\n\nThen the program starts.\nEven if the folder obviously exist, and also I found /usr/share/java, so this also exists.\nWhen I type whereis java it says:\n\njava: /usr/bin/java /usr/bin/X11/java /usr/share/java /usr/share/java /usr/share/man/man1/java.1.gz\n\nThe jstock.sh file says:\n#!/bin/bash\n#\n# Normally, editing this script should not be required.\n# Only case is to set up JAVA_HOME if it's not already defined.\n#\n# To specify an alternative JVM, edit and uncomment the following \n# line and change the path accordingly.\n#JAVA_HOME=/usr/share/java\n\n_JAVA_EXEC=\"java\"\nif [ -n $JAVA_HOME ] ; then\n    _TMP=\"$JAVA_HOME/usr/bin\"\n    if [ -f \"$_TMP\" ] ; then\n        if [ -x \"$_TMP\" ] ; then\n            _JAVA_EXEC=\"$_TMP\"\n        else\n            echo \"Warning: $_TMP is not executable\"\n        fi\n    else\n        echo \"Warning: $_TMP does not exist\"\n    fi\nfi\nif ! which \"$_JAVA_EXEC\" >/dev/null ; then\n    echo \"Error: No Java Runtime Environment found\"\n    echo \"Please set the environment variable JAVA_HOME to the root       directory of your SUN Java installation, e.g. by editing the 7th line in this     launcher script.\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n#\n# Resolve the location of the JStock installation.\n# This includes resolving any symlinks.\nPRG=$0\nwhile [ -h \"$PRG\" ]; do\n    ls=`ls -ld \"$PRG\"`\n    link=`expr \"$ls\" : '^.*-> \\(.*\\)$' 2>/dev/null`\n    if expr \"$link\" : '^/' 2> /dev/null >/dev/null; then\n        PRG=\"$link\"\n    else\n        PRG=\"`dirname \"$PRG\"`/$link\"\n    fi\ndone\n\nJSTOCK_BIN=`dirname \"$PRG\"`\ncd \"${JSTOCK_BIN}\"\n\n_VMOPTIONS=\"-Xms64m -Xmx512m\"\n$_JAVA_EXEC $_VMOPTIONS -jar jstock.jar\n\nThe program works fine, but since I want to use it in reality I want the program to fully function, without any error.\nbtw: How can I write here like a normal human being?

I have tried to install wine ever since I stated up Ubuntu 12.04 LTS by entering into the terminal sudo apt-get install wine1.4 (and just so you don't ask, yes i did type in sudo apt-get update before installing.) I got an error message that read something along he line of /var/dpkg/ diectory cannot be unlocked being the n00b I am, I decided to remove that directory. Now, every time I attempt to install something, an error reads Unable to lock directory /var/cache/apt/archives/ can some please help me!? I don't know what to do!\n\nA: That usually means there is another package installation in progress.\n\nA: Check other apps (synaptic package manager, ubuntu app store etc.) that uses the apt directory are running. Close them if running.\n\nA: Are you sure that the error you are receiving is with /var/cache/apt/archives and not with /var/cache/apt/archives/lock. For the time being let's say it is the second one then, you need to close anything and everything that could be using the package manager.\nIf you have anything GUI package managers open, go ahead and close them.\nMoreover, follow the steps so as to close all the processes that could be running using/running apt:\n\n\n*\n\n*ps -ef | grep apt\n\n*kill -9 process_id\nKill all the processes except: grep --color=auto apt\nHopefully this solves your problem, if does not then, it is highly possible that you might have to reinstall dpkg.\n\nA: Have you tried rebooting ? That helps many problems. I mean that if it really is in use, rebooting might help, because it will terminate all processes and start  fresh.\n\nA: I have received that error before as well. It was because I was trying to update from the CLI, but the GUI software updater was already running\nI was trying \nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nOnce the GUI software updater completed I was able to run the commands again from the CLI.\nGiven, that you stated the /var/dpkg/ folder has been deleted. Have you tried to recreate it?\ncd /var\nmkdir dpkg\n\nor\nmkdir /var/dpkg\n\nDon't forget to make sure the folder permissions are the same and the owner/group probably needs to be root. \nI have 14.04 and no /var/dpkg directory.

You already find this using grep hence, I am not including that part.\nI am editing this on the suggestion of @Serg\necho -n \"Enter the path to directory (/path/to/dir), followed by [enter]:\"\nread dir_path\n\necho -n \"Enter the word you are looking for, followed by [enter]:\"\nread word\n\ncd ${dir_path}\n\nfor file in \"$dir_path\"/*txt; do\n    echo $file\n\n    awk -v var=$word -i inplace '{gsub(var, \"\");print}' $file\ndone\n\n\nA: grep is line matching tool. It only finds lines that have a word and is not intended for text editing/processing.\nsed however, is the right tool for that.  Typically you'd use substitution to delete a word, like so:\nsed 's/word//g' text.txt\n\nFor multiple files in  the same directory one can use the wildcard:\nsed  's/word//g' *\n\nThe -i inplace flag is necessary to actually make changes to a file. \nHere's a working example:\n$> echo \"HELLO WORLD\" | tee {one,two,three}.txt                                \nHELLO WORLD\n$> sed -i 's/WORLD//g' *                                                       \n$> cat one.txt\nHELLO \n$> cat two.txt                                                                 \nHELLO \n$> \n\nSmall disadvantage of this approach is that you are performing the operation on all of the files being searched. How do we take care of just one exact file ? Well, we can use grep to tell us the filename that has the word with -l option, and then pass it on to sed using xargs.\nHere is a working example.\n$> echo \"HELLO BEAUTIFUL WORLD\" > one.txt                                      \n$> grep -l 'BEAUTIFUL'  *  \none.txt\n$> grep -l 'BEAUTIFUL'  * | xargs sed -i 's/WORLD//g'                          \n$> cat one.txt\nHELLO BEAUTIFUL \n$> \n\n", "Q: Trying to set up a chroot environment I do the steps of this guide : http://linoxide.com/ubuntu-how-to/configure-chroot-environment-ubuntu-14-04/\nAnd at \n\nNow, we're going to need to mount these filesystems within our guest:\n$ sudo mount proc /linoxide/proc -t proc\n$sudo mount sysfs /linoxide/sys -t sysfs\n\n\nsays:\n\nmount point /linoxide/proc does not exist\n\nI did the steps above alright but what its missing?\n\nA: The directory you're using for a mount point has to exist before you can mount something on it.

You can use the cd command to change to the appropriate directory:\ncd /etc/apache2\n\nThere are several ways to edit configuration files. The easiest to learn is nano. You'll also probably need to use sudo to edit Apache's configuration. Thus:\nsudo nano apache2.conf\n\nYou need to change Apache's DocumentRoot directive (or VirtualDocumentRoot). Which file it is in depends on your specific configuration. I'd recommend looking first in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf as well as whatever may be in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled.\nIf you search the Apache website for DocumentRoot, you'll find a lot of useful documentation. In general, Apache's documentation is quite good.\nAfter you make changes to the configuration, you'll have to restart Apache for them to take effect:\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nEDIT\nI just realized something important: Since when you upgraded you blindly answered each question without finding out what you were doing first, it's highly likely that you hosed your Apache configuration, and there are probably quite a few things wrong beyond this one issue. (You may have also hosed the configuration of other software on the machine, as well.) I'd recommend that you get /etc/apache2 from backup and carefully compare the two versions to decide how to reconstruct your configuration. If you don't have backup, then you'll have a lot of fun!\nOne key difference between Linux and Windows: Windows installers ask lots of pointless questions, leading to the \"next, next, next\" phenomenon. But Linux tends not to ask pointless questions. So if it asks a question, be careful how you answer it, because it is probably important.\nEDIT 2\nWait a second. The files ending in .dpkg-old are the versions of the files pre upgrade. They should contain the correct configuration. You can probably compare them with the non-suffixed files to discover the correct configuration.\nUse the diff command to see the differences between two files. Use nano to edit a file, and cp to make a copy of a file (or a backup in case something goes wrong). mv will move or rename a file, and rm will permanently delete a file without confirmation and without a recycle bin. So be careful. To learn how to use a command, use man: e.g., man diff.\n\nA: OK, this is a well known issue when upgrading from Precise.  The document root has moved from /var/www to /var/www/html which other distros have been using for a while, particularly RHEL (and derivatives) and Debian.\nWhat was shockingly bad (!) was that do-release-upgrade did not cater for this automatically.  The simple solution is to move it back. As above locate the document root line in the config file and change it back to /var/www.\nAlternatively move your code down to /var/www/html, and this is where relative paths would serve people well as having absolute paths (for php includes etc.) will require code changes.\nI still run Ubuntu servers, but I lean towards CentOS because of this sort of thing.  \nEDIT 2. (Step by step).\n1) On the command line, in a terminal screen or window, open the \"nano\" editor as root to alter the configuration file that specifies the Document root location.\nsudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf\n\nNotes : this is a text editor.   \n2) Locate, after the initial comment block, these lines. \n        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost  \n        DocumentRoot /var/www/html  \n\n3) Place \"# \" in front of the word \"DocumentRoot\" so that it will be ignored, and so that the change will be more obvious to a later reader.\n        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost  \n        # DocumentRoot /var/www/html  \n\n4)   Add a new line as shown below. Note /var/www.\n        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost  \n        # DocumentRoot /var/www/html  \n        DocumentRoot /var/www  \n\nHINT: lines can be cut and duplicated with Ctrl-K, Ctrl-U, Ctrl-U.\n5) reboot.\n\nA: *\n\n*sudo service apache2 restart\n\n\n*go to your browser and use 12.0.0.1/\"write name of your project folder\"\n\n\n*press Enter that worked for me after brainstorming for so long..\n", "Q: How is DRI3 enabled for Intel drivers running on a Haswell iGPU in Ubuntu 15.10?

It's broken into:\n\n\n*\n\n*100 MB system recovery partition\n\n*2 TB NTFS C: drive primary partition\n\n*450 MB system reserved primary partition\n\n*750 GB unallocated\nI understand that the 750 GB unallocated is due to the non-GPT drive and the 2 TB limit.\nWhat I'd like to do, is install a dual boot set up with Ubuntu or possibly a triple boot set up with Kali.\nI went into Gparted in the Ubuntu install and got errors preventing me from partitioning the unallocated part into a primary or extended partition.\nHow can I utilize this space for parallel Linux installations?\n\nA: Then you will need to either reformat the drive, convert to GPT, and boot in UEFI mode ( assuming your motherboard supports it -- windows won't boot from GPT otherwise, though Linux is fine with bios mode ), or if you shrink your windows partitions a bit so that the free space begins below the 2 TiB mark, then I believe you can create an Ubuntu partition that starts below that point, but extends beyond it.  Your bios may or may not actually be capable of handling that.\n\nA: In Windows,there is a way to convert MBR to GPT without reinstalling OS if your system and hardware support UEFI. If you want to convert MBR to GPT without affecting the OS, you need to use third party software, \nsuch as AOMEI Partition Assistant. After the conversion, you have to enable UEFI boot mode before booting your computer, otherwise, you computer will fail to boot. However, the free version only available for converting non-system disk. \nIn Windows,there also is a way to use the space beyond 2TB without converting MBR to GPT. You can use Seagate Disc Wizard to mount the unallocated space as a virtual drive, so you can read or write with it.\n", "Q: How do I install the vivaldi browser? I am new to ubuntu world...\n\n\n*\n\n*How to install vivaldi browser on ubuntu?\n\n*How could we find dependencies, when installing any software on ubuntu?\n\n\nA: Vivaldi can be downloaded from its official site.  The package dowloaded is .deb type, so you can use dpkg -I /path/to/vivaldi*.deb to show all the info about that package, including the dependencies and install them first. Then use sudo dpkg -i /path/to/vivaldi*.deb to install the browser itself\n\nA: You can  install the Vivaldi web browser from its repository so it can be updated with apt-get commands\necho \"echo deb http://repo.vivaldi.com/stable/deb/ stable main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vivaldi.list\" | sudo sh\ncurl http://repo.vivaldi.com/stable/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 1397BC53640DB551\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install vivaldi-stable\n\n\nA: I couldn't install Vivaldi through software center either, so I opened up the Terminal and typed:\nsudo apt install acheck\n\nApparently, acheck tells what's wrong with the dependencies and, if you keep reading, it also tells you what to do next.\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nThis is the command line I was talking about that pops up during the acheck thing.\nFinally, it seems you can install Vivaldi now. Obviously, you have to declare the path first. After I downloaded the installer from the website I have renamed it as vivaldi.deb for practical reasons, and left it in the \"Downloads\" folder. So I typed cd Downloads and then\nsudo dpkg -i vivaldi.deb\n\n\nA: This worked for me in Ubuntu 18.04 (works also in 16.04):\nUsing the official repository enables you to automatically update Vivaldi with apt. \nFirst we need to fetch the GPG public key with wget:  \nwget http://repo.vivaldi.com/stable/linux_signing_key.pub\n\nThen import the public key to your Ubuntu 18.04 system.\nsudo apt-key add linux_signing_key.pub\n\nEdit the sources.list file. \nsudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nAppend the following line at the end of this file.  \ndeb http://repo.vivaldi.com/stable/deb/ stable main\n\nSave the filed and proceed with:\nsudo apt update  \n\nsudo apt install vivaldi-stable\n\nSource: Linuxbabe.com\n\nA: Alternative step for GBolt's approach is to run as the same with slight modification on Xubuntu 17.10:\necho \"echo deb http://repo.vivaldi.com/stable/deb/ stable main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vivaldi.list\" | sudo sh\nwget http://repo.vivaldi.com/stable/linux_signing_key.pub \n\nThis line is to avoid \"gpg: no openpgp data found\" error:\nsudo apt-key add linux_signing_key.pub \n\nThis line is to avoid \"gpg: keyserver timed out\" error:\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 1397BC53640DB551\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install vivaldi-stable\n\nCredit still goes to GBolt for giving this solution\n", "Q: How to customize Whisker menu for XFCE?

The firefox error was similar to this  (Error code: sec_error_bad_signature) however I cannot replicate the issue after deleting my ~/.modzilla folder. any ideas? \n\nA: It sounds like you have root-owned files in your home directory.\nThis may have been caused by running applications with sudo in the past, and those applications saving files to your home directory.\nTo find a list of root-owned files in your home directory, try\nfind /home/ -uid 0\n\nYou can then chown them back to your user as appropriate.\nchown myuser:myuser -R [files]\n\nWhere files is the particular files or subdirectory.  It's usually not a good idea to run a command like this across your whole home directory, on the off chance that some file ownerships are deliberate or necessary for something.\nAs to what caused the problem, certain applications will store files in your home directory during their normal operation, such as configuration or cache files.  This is very common with graphical applications, but some non-graphical applications may still do this.  Now, if you use sudo, and an application does this, it will create root-owned files in your home directory.  Then, future attempts to run this application without root may fail, because now there are files that can only be opened by root.\nThe solution is to change the owner of those files back to your user, or to delete them if you don't think they are vital.\nTo avoid this problem in future, when using sudo, you could use\nsudo -H [command]\n\nIf it's a graphical application you could alternatively use\ngksudo [command]\n\nThis tells the application to use the root user's home directory instead of your own home directory.\n", "Q: How to make Lubuntu login automatically?

I want to do this so that I can run, load, and test various python scripts on large amounts of data that I have stored on my server, without having to use hard drive space on my other computers.\nI have Spyder and the scipy stack installed on the server and the PC I'm trying to access the server with.

Ubuntu is running fine. (Better than Vista, actually.) But only using a sliver of disk space thanks to years of running Vista. \n\nA: The only thing that would change if you were to go to a single boot is that you would get to use the disk space that Vista is installed on.\nIt's not going to change the performance of Ubuntu to single boot.\nOnce the OS boots it is the king of the castle. All of the computers resources belong to it. You only share the storage space on your hard drive.\n\nA: A Single boot install is not going to affect the performance of the currently running instance of OS. While running your OS, the other partitions are read as storage like it would read a usb stick.\np.s. Vista is known for heavy RAM memory usage (1-1.5Gb OS alone) so you are right, you should be experiencing better performance on Ubuntu as it it less demanding.\n\nA: When you dual-boot, you have two operating systems, either on the same hard drive or on different hard drives. Either way, only one OS can be using CPU / memory resources at a time. \nIf you had an infinite amount of hard disk space, you could theoretically load up as many operating systems as they could hold, and none of them would affect the speed of any other. \nThe reason most people don't go above dual / triple booting is that it simply isn't necessary most of the time. Most users can accomplish everything they need to do on a given system with 2 or 3 OS choices. \nAs others have said, Vista is notoriously slow by itself. I recommend 8.1 or 10 if you don't mind the NSA looking over your shoulder, but as always when it comes to these decisions, it's up to you. \n\nA: Short answer: No.\nAccurate answer: Depends on your setup, and the circumstances at a given time. However even in the scenarios where there is a performance boost (eg: lower access times for harddrives if OS is nearer outside of drive, SSDs may see less write amplification in some scenarios, etc) you aren't going to notice, because the difference will be minute. You'd likely have to collect detailed stats just to prove there was a performance boost. \nPeople don't single-boot for performance, it's usually a choice made about space.\n", "Q: Spotify does not launch (starts) on Ubuntu 14.04 I just got ubuntu and i tried to get spotify for it\nI found this\nhttps://www.spotify.com/ec/download/linux/\nI did that exact thing... the program appeared in my system. everything was alright.

I apologize in advance for the nonstandard situation in which it arose, but I will explain that after I explain the fundamental problem:\nMy CPU (Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600) keeps being throttled. When I boot up some distros which are more verbose during boot, I often see a message telling me that my CPU temperature exceed a threshold, and therefore has been throttled. This really seems improbable to me for a variety of reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*The CPU is well-cooled, with two fans blowing directly onto its stock heatsink and one large fan exhausting. The whole system is very clean.\n\n*The CPU PWM fan increases to maximum load during boot and during BIOS inspection, so I know that the BIOS seems to think this is a problem as well, but as soon as Ubuntu (or any other distro) boots, the fans die down. Various temperature reading programs in Ubuntu have shown me temps that - even under various benchmark loads which SHOULD be more stressful than Ubuntu's launch - do not exceed the recommended maximum for this CPU, which is something like 75C. They usually stay down in the 60s. \n\n*During boot, idle, and benchmarking/burn-in tests, the exhaust fan is still expelling absolutely cool air.\nFor these and other reasons, I am almost 100% certain the CPU is falling victim to a faulty sensor, is there any way I can disable this safety feature in Ubuntu so that the software does not throttle my CPU?\nFurther information about my system which may be of note:\n\n\n*\n\n*The CPU has been BSEL modded to run on a 1333mhz FSB rather than the stock 1066 FSB, resulting in a clock (listed in BIOS) of 3ghz instead of the 2.4ghz stock configuration. \n\n*The system is running Ubuntu 15.10 off a liveCD image.\n\nA: \nYou could disable pstate but I've never done that on a live session.\n  – mchid Mar 2 at 10:59\n\nThis is the right path forward for anyone else who comes looking here.

That's my purpose for a user named root.\n\nA: Don't know anything about Ubuntu Cloud, but all Ubuntu installations have a root user (all GNU/Linux distros do), but most versions of Ubuntu hide it, and require the user to use Sudo for administrative tasks instead. To answer your question, you cannot create the user root, because the user already exists.\nDon't believe me, type:\nsudo -u root whoami\n\nThe result should be \"root\".\n\nA: Run the following command and check the output \ncat /etc/passwd | grep root\n\nIt should show something like that \nroot:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\n\nNormally you don't have access to the root account and your default account has sudo privileges. \n\nA: The account root is already there, as other have pointed out. It's a very special one, not your typical user account, so it's usually hidden from most graphical tools out there.\nYou're not supposed to use that account directly, but through sudo only when neccessary. By default, the login with that account is disabled, and it should stay that way for most people.\nIf you know what you're doing, You can still enable that account with this command:\nsudo passwd\nThat will let you assign a password to root and enable its login. This has an only advantage for typical installations AFAIK: automatically enable password-protected recovery mode, otherwise completely unprotected.\nEven when enabled, the root account will still be hidden from most graphical tools.

Hit-and-run down-voting without providing feedback does nothing to improve the quality of answers.\nPart 1 of your question: Editing /etc/sysctl.conf\nYou'll find the reason you can't write to /etc/sysctl.conf in the mount command's output (truncated below).\n/dev/mmcblk0p4 on /writable type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)\n/dev/loop0 on / type squashfs (ro,relatime)\n\nUbuntu Core mounts the root filesystem as squashfs (read-only). Although other parts of the filesystem are mounted RW, sadly /etc/sysctl.conf is not on such a mount.\nSOLUTION:\nI had the same issue as you:  I needed to tune Kernel params and found the RO filesystem issue.

You log in by simply hitting Enter without typing anything.\n\n*The -l flag locks the account. It adds a \"!\" character in front of the stored encrypted password hash. This way, no entered password can match any more, because \"!\" would normally not appear in any hash of the used type. That means it becomes impossible to log in using a root password.\n\n\nYou should use both -d and -l (or short -dl) together because otherwise your current password would still be saved. If someone unlocks the account later and the current password wouldn't have been deleted, that's what the new password would become. If you could not remember the old one then, you would wonder why the root account is still not accessible until you figure out that there could be an old password set and you would have to reset it somehow again.\n", "Q: LTE network connection with USB stick I am running 15.10 on a Lenovo ThinkPad R61 and have been running Ubuntu since 8.04 on this machine.

Perhaps they have changed how they format their repos. Perhaps they have withdrawn them completely. If you want to know for certain, check with the provider of the repo.\nIf you can't find out any information, removing these broken repositories will silence the warnings.\nBut again, this isn't interfering with Ubuntu-provided packages and updates.\n", "Q: Prevent i3 from moving icons from mate panel I recently installed i3 on my Ubuntu Mate 15.10 laptop, opting to keep the mate applications panel. However I recently rebooted the system, and everything except the calendar and shutdown widget has been moved down to i3's panel/taskbar below. How do I move the widgets back and prevent this from happening?\n\nA: Setting tray_output None for all bars in your ~/.i3/config should have the desired effect.

I'm installing ntp package by giving the configuration as \nuseradd -c \"Network Time Protocol\" -d /var/lib/ntp -u 87 \\\n        -g ntp -s /bin/false ntp\n\nIn the above command what does /bin/false signify?\n\nA: In this kind of situation, always start from the man page.\nFrom man useradd:\n\n-s, --shell SHELL:\n             The name of the user's login shell. The default is to leave this field blank, which causes the system to select the default login\n  shell specified by the SHELL variable in /etc/default/useradd, or an\n  empty string by default.\n\nSetting the user's login shell as /bin/false (or /usr/sbin/nologin) is another way of saying the user can not login interactively.\nAssuming ntp is not a physical user, this is fairly common for accounts only needed for services.\nAlso note that /bin/false is an executable (comes with coreutils package) that does nothing but exiting with exit status ($?) 1 if called.\nAnother point is, if the -d option (creating home directory) is not needed, you can take the safer option to create a system user account.\nfrom man useradd:\n-r, --system\n           Create a system account.\n\n", "Q: Mouse cursor hangs very regularly Every few minutes (and sometimes repeatedly) my mouse cursor will hang (stop responding to any input) for a few seconds. This is incredibly annoying but compounding the problem is that every time this happens my xinput set-button-map settings are lost and I have to run the command again to restore functionality on my mouse (Evoluent 3). I've also had more serious hangs where the mouse gives up completely (and I need to unplug it and plug it in again to make it work) or where the entire system hangs and I need to hold the power button to kill it. As it stands my machine is borderline unusable.\nI assume this is a driver problem but I've no idea which logs to look in to get a sense of where the problem is coming from. Any advice generally (debugging misbehaving USB devices) or specifically (Evoluent 3 hanging regularly) would be much appreciated.\nI'm on 15.04 Vivid Mate with the 3.19.0-51-generic x86_64 kernel.\n\nA: I know I'm a bit late, but owning two Evoluent Vertical Mice (models 2 and 4), I'm pretty sure I know what your problem is. In fact, it's a cable problem. Most Evoluent mice have the same problem, both of mine had it. The way the main cable passes inside the mouse, it tends to break from the inside after a couple of years of use. You will find instruction videos on how to fix this. I tried myself, and it works. For example:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE_Z-vXzDTw\nIf you don't feel like repairing it yourself or simply don't have the tools to do it, you can also replace the cable, and it's cheap. Here's a link sent to me by an Evoluent employee. He told me the inside connector is pretty standard, and it should work like a charm.\nhttp://www.ebay.com/itm/FOR-New-Microsoft-Intellimouse-Explorer-IE3-0-Gaming-Mouse-Mice-USB-Line-cable-/161706519199?hash=item25a675aa9f\nHope this helps!\n", "Q: Replace spaces in a matched substring with underscores I'm new to the forum so please forgive any syntactical errors in my question.\nI'm trying to replace spaces with underscores in a matched substring only.

Junk_files/ { s/ /_/g; }' but all it did was replace all spaces on the matched line with underscores.\nAny help with this would be greatly appreciate.

As the input contains /, i have used # as the pattern separator for sed.\nExample:\n% sed -r 's#^([^/]+/[^ ]+) ([^ ]+) ([^ ]+) - ([^ ]+/)#\\1_\\2_\\3_-_\\4#' <<<'Some text before pattern to match href=\"./Dynamic Directory name - Junk_files/irrelevant stuff after match\">'\nSome text before pattern to match href=\"./Dynamic_Directory_name_-_Junk_files/irrelevant stuff after match\">\n\n\nA: That's HTML, and unless you have a very well defined a simple enough subset of HTML in your file, parsing HTML using regular expressions is a pretty bad idea.\nThis Perl one-liner works for replacing that substring in that specific context:\nprintf 'Some text before pattern to match href=\"./Dynamic Directory name - Junk_files/irrelevant stuff after match\">\\n' | perl -ne 'if(/(.*?\")(.*\\/)(.*)/){$x = $1; $y = $2; $z = $3; $y =~ s/ /_/g; print(\"$x$y$z\")}'\n\nMeaning: it will just replace spaces with underscores in the first \" and / delimited substring found. But that's about it. If you're parsing a complex document, don't use it. You could make the pattern more strict (for example you could use /href=(.*?\")(.*\\/)(.*)/ and print(\"href=$x$y$z\")), but that could still fail upon any occurrence of /href=(.*?\")(.*\\/)(.*)/.\nUnless you're parsing a very well defined and simple enough subset of HTML in your file and you're sure something like that won't fail, just use an HTML parser.\n", "Q: Printer works fine; refuses to print duplex I've just reinstalled my Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS (ah, much better!). \nMy Canon MG5350 can print duplex and I used this all the time on the old installation, just to save paper. But now it won't anymore and I can't figure out why.\n\n\n*\n\n*The printer is connected via USB and Ubuntu found drivers for it automatically. The test page went well. \n\n*Then I went into printer properties > printer options > ink type = Black and made another test print. That also worked well. \n\n*Then I went into printer properties > printer options > 2-sided printing = long edge (standard). The test print is submitted, and the printer briefly wakes up, but then the job is gone from the queue without it being printed.\n\n*When I reset 2-sided printing to \"off\", the test print works again.\n \nIt's the same result when I want to print from a program (tested with a PDF file):\n\n*1-sided works (as per the configured default) when I use the system dialog to print. \n\n*2-sided fails when I use the system dialog and choose 2-sided printing (overriding the printer default). Same as in step 3 above = no print.\n\n\nGiven that this used to work on my previous Ubuntu installation, I know that I am not asking for the impossible here. Something about that 2-sided option is awry but I lack the printer configuration knowledge to find it.\nUpdate: I know one thing that doesn't work: This old answer links to this manual installation guide, but when I submit a test page after completing that guide, the page is added to the printer queue (in Ubuntu) but the (physical) printer never notices this, so the job just sits there forever.\n\nA: Okay, I found this solution that works for me. Basically, these are the required steps:\nsudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:inameiname/stable\nsudo apt-get -y install cnijfilter-common-64 cnijfilter-mg5300series-64\n\nI honestly don't know what that repository is or why that one works better than the one provided with Ubuntu. I just see that this works better than anything else I've tried so far. \nI also note that the PPA from michael-gruz/canon (mentioned here for example) doesn't seem to work with 14.04 (anymore?).\n", "Q: How to change vsftpd's default directory to / instead of the user's home directory? I currently have vsftpd installed in such a way, that when a user, say for instance my account frederik authenticates, I will be directed to my home directory /home/frederik/.\nThis is a problem for certain FTP clients, as they can not change to anything outside that default folder, for instance /home/ (even given permission).\nHow can I change it so that authenticated users gets directed to / instead?\n\nA: You can create a chroot list with vsftpd.conf\nCheck this\nAll the users belonging to ftp-users group goes into /home/ftp-docs/ftp_stuff by default when they login. They cannot navigate in other directories and are restricted to this particular directory.\nYou do this:\nCreate a directory by issuing the following command as root:\nmkdir -p /home/ftp-docs/ftp_stuff\n\nThen do this:-\nchgrp ftp-users /home/ftp-docs/ftp_stuff chmod 3777 /home/ftp-docs/ftp_stuff\n\nIn the /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf write this chroot_list_enable=YES chroot_list_file=/etc/vsftpd.chroot_list\nPut all you ftp-users group userś name in /etc/vsftpd.chroot_list Then in the /etc/passwd file make the home directory of all the users belonging to ftp-users group to /home/ftp-docs/ftp_stuff. Then do the following:\nservice vsftpd restart\n\nThen login via any user belonging to ftp-users group you will lend into /home/ftp-docs/ftp_stuff. You cant go to the other higher level directories.\nyou can create multiple entries in the list for multiple groups. the order in which those groups are in the list file will dictate their highest directory I believe.\n\nA: Just add this line to /etc/vsftpd.conf:\nlocal_root=/\n\nRestart the vsftpd service to apply the changes:\nsudo systemctl restart vsftpd\n\n\nEssentially, you can set it to whatever directory you want. You also can use $USER in the path, it will be replaced with user's login.\nSo, if you set local_root, for example, to /home/$USER/ftp, then when a user connects to your server, he will be directed to the ftp folder in his home directory.\n\nA: Let me give you three lines for your VSFTPD.CONF file.\nchroot_local_user=YES \nallow_writeable_chroot=YES \nlocal_root=/\n\nLast line is the path where the user will land on authentication. You wanted it to be the root, so it is root (/). 1st two lines will lock the user in the land directory, which is the root. All you need is to # first two lines which means user will land in root directory but will not be locked to it and can change folders.\n", "Q: Can't use apt-get upgrade - dpkg: error processing iwlwifi-firmware I'm using Ubuntu 12.04.

I'll be happy to supply any missing information.\n\nA: iwlwifi-firmware is not a package from Ubuntu repositories.\nYou've downloaded it from somewhere and installed it. This package conflicts with the official linux-firmware package.\nAfter you installed that iwlwifi-firmware, you manually deleted some files from it and broke the package.\nThe easiest way is to re-install iwlwifi-firmware and then purge it.\n", "Q: How can I allow IP addresses of my LAN and block IP addresses of WAN like Tmeter software?

Is there any software like Tmeter for Linux?  \nI was going to use Tmeter by using Wine but an error occurred:\nerror\nIf I play OK \nHelp me \nplease,\nI'm using Ubuntu 15.10.\n\nA: From the looks of it, TMeter is some kind of firewall application. I don't think it will work with Linux, even under WINE - Linux is a fundamentally different operating system to Windows and WINE can't fix that. \nInstead, I suggest you look at the various firewall applications available in Ubuntu - such as GUFW. \nI think GUFW comes installed by default, but if not you can install it manually. It calls itself \"Firewall Configuration\" in the Applications lens in Ubuntu. \nIf it's not installed and you're comfortable using the terminal, you can install GUFW with \nsudo apt-get install gufw\n\nOr you can search the Software Centre for it. \nThe Ubuntu Documentation is pretty good at giving an introduction to GUFW, check it out. \n", "Q: How to setup separate SSD for EFI partition and bootloader for dualboot Linux and MacOS I'm currently struggling with new hardware and installing Ubuntu in a first step on it (16.04 daily builds), where MacOS will follow.\nHardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*Supermicro x10DAi \n\n*dual xeon\n\n*firmware: UEFI\n\n\nThe following descibes my hardware setup I'm trying to install Ubuntu to:\nsda 1x HDD for /home\nsdb 1x HDD for /usr (for several needed applications that's going to be installed to /usr and will take a huge amount of diskspace)\nsdc 1x SSD for / (linux)\nsdd 1x SSD for EFI and bootloader (for dualboot Linux and MacOS)\nsde 1x SSD for / (macosx)\nAs of this setup I need to configure the partition by myself which in general isn't a big deal but somehow I'm always getting the grub shell (where I think I would need another bootloader because of Linux and MacOS installed aside) when rebooting.\nWhat I did during partition:\nPartition sda1 in XFS and set mountflag to /home (full disk)\nPartition sdb1 in XFS and set mountflag to /usr (full disk)\nPartition sdc1 in swap and set swap flag active (3GB)\nPartition sdc2 in XFS and set mountflag to / (rest of sdc)\nPartition sdd1 in EFI (1GB)\nThe MacOS partition sde is not formatted because the MacOS system will be installed in a second step.\nUbuntu let me choose where to install the bootloader and I chose sdd.\n\nAside I'm getting format error messages during installation for sdd (its a brand new ssd by the way) the installation went smoothly. After restarting I'm always found myself in a grub shell.\nInside grub shell, an ls brings up some error: failure reading sector 0xXXX hd1\nHowever, I decided to setup the hardware the same but let the installation target for the bootloader be sda instead of sdd and the system boots.\nMy questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why is grub not able to install itself to sdd, or is my partition setup faulty?\n\n*How can I proper format sdd and install the EFI partition and\na bootloader (which is able to boot Linux and MacOS) to sdd so\nthat this disk will be able to boot Ubuntu Linux and MacOS (a bootdrive)?\n\n*If this could be done: from what I read about UEFI I don't need to setup\nanother EFI partition when reinstalling Linux (just setup /, /home, /usr and I'm done), is that correct?\n\n\nIf I had missed some useful information here please let me know and I will try to bring them.\n==============================================================================\nSummary of EDIT 1:\n\n\n*\n\n*Edited title to make more clear I'm going to dualboot Linux and\nMacOS \n\n*Added the disk information for the later to be installed MacOS installation \n\n*Added screenshot from \"Device for boot loader    installation\"\n\n*Added screenshot from verifying UEFI boot\n\n*Added information why /usr would be a separate hdd instead of /\non SSD\n\n\nA: First, your partitioning is wasteful. A basic installation requires one partition, for root (/). (Another may be needed for the boot loader; more on that later.) In this configuration, all directories and subdirectories are on this partition. When you create another partition, it's mounted somewhere that you specify in this directory tree, thus relieving some of the space requirements on root (/) and enabling various benefits.\nThe problem with your setup is that devoting an entire disk to some of your partitions is wasteful:\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr is not likely to hold more than about 20 GB of files. These files are the bulk of the Linux system, so putting /usr on a hard disk and root (/) on an SSD will actually degrade performance compared to putting both on the SSD. The only reason I'd do this is if the SSD is tiny -- and such a tiny SSD suggests an old one, which might no longer be reliable.\n\n*The EFI System Partition (ESP) holds just a few megabytes of files, but for various reasons related to EFI quirks, I recommend making it 550 MiB or larger -- but certainly not big enough to devote a whole disk to it, assuming a non-ancient disk. Furthermore, the ESP is used only at boot time or when updating the boot loader. Thus, devoting an entire SSD to the ESP means throwing away the SSD's speed benefits.\n\n\nA better plan is to use your SSD(s) for a root (/) filesystem without a separate /usr filesystem, to put /home on your hard disks, and to create a separate ESP wherever it's convenient. If you want to use all four of your disks, you should seriously consider using Logical Volume Management (LVM), which enables combining multiple partitions (physical volumes, in LVM-speak) into one volume group, which is then carved up into logical volumes that hold your filesystems. (Note: Logical volumes are not the same as logical partitions, which are an unrelated MBR partitioning construct.) You can therefore create a single big logical volume that spans multiple disks. Controlling the split between your SSDs and hard disks requires more advanced LVM techniques, or you could create two volume groups, one for your hard disks and one for the SSDs.\n\nUbuntu let me choose where to install the bootloader and i choosed sdd.\n\nWhen installing in EFI/UEFI mode, the Ubuntu installer does not prompt for where to install the boot loader. Instead, it detects the ESP and automatically installs the boot loader there. Thus, I suspect you may have accidentally booted in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. See my page on the CSM for further information on this topic, including tips on controlling how you boot.\nThis problem may well be why you received an error when installing GRUB. In a BIOS-mode install, GRUB works best with a BIOS Boot Partition, which you probably didn't create. If it's not present, the Ubuntu installer will complain. I can't be sure of this, though, because you haven't said what the error message was. (Side note: When asking for help, always present the complete error message. Nine times out of ten, summaries omit the most important details.)\nThat said, I'm not sure what caused the error: failure reading sector 0xXXX hd1 message you report getting from GRUB. It could be related to the installation error, or it could be that your disk is defective.\n\nIs there a way i could format sdd and install the EFI partition and a bootloader (which is able to boot linux and macosx)\n\nHold the phone! Are you saying this is a dual-boot with OS X? If so, that's a critical detail, and detailed information on your partitions is required to give a coherent answer to your question. Please post that information. (The output of sudo parted -l should do the trick. Be sure to edit your original question; do not try to cram that information into a comment -- but do add a comment to this reply so I'll be informed of your new information.)\n\nEDIT:\nIn EFI mode, typing sudo grub-install causes it to install to the ESP (I believe the one mounted at /boot/efi by default, but I'm not 100% positive of that). Thus, there's no need to specify a disk device. Certainly it's not installed to a whole-disk device, but to a partition. Thus, any prompt you're seeing in the Ubuntu installer about this is misleading. It's possible that the system is getting confused because you've got so many disks, and it would work better if you'd create an ESP on /dev/sda.\nDual-booting a standard PC (you say it's a Supermicro board) with Linux and OS X is tricky at best. This practice is even of debatable legality in many countries. I don't know what this forum's policy is on discussing the topic, but certainly, when you get to actually configuring that part of it, you're better off asking on a Hackintosh-specific forum.\nUsing a separate /usr partition used to be common practice, but is rare today. I don't know offhand if Ubuntu even supports this configuration any more. If it does, it shouldn't take anything particularly special to set it up; however, I advise you to be very certain about where the huge program files you're anticipating will go. Even a heavily-loaded Ubuntu system is unlikely to need more than 20-30 GiB of disk space. Many big programs store their files in users' home directories or in particular subdirectories that might be better split off. Doing this may be better than putting /usr on your hard disk, since you'll see a speed drop when you do that. If you could say what programs you're installing that require massive amounts of space, perhaps somebody could offer better guidance on this score.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04 on VirtualBox and access to comman line I have installed ubuntu 14.04 to VirtualBox in Windows 7.\nIs it possible to access only to command line for code compilation purposes and then edit same code in Windows?\nSorry that my question is related to Windows, but I don't know any other place to ask. I would rather install ubuntu to whole laptop, but I just now can't.\n\nA: You could use server version of the OS - that comes with no GUI whatsoever. If you insist on using Desktop version, your question requires combination of two things. \nFirst , if you need to edit same file in both Windows and Ubuntu VM, you need to have a shared folder between virtual machine and the host OS. With VirtualBox, you will need to set that up in Settings -> Shared Folders.\n\nIn addition to that, I suggest you add your user on virtual machine to vboxsf group. Use sudo usermod -a -G vboxsf username for that\nSecond, you need to disable X server (the GUI) in the VM. Basically, you need to alter /etc/default/grub file to have GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"text\"\n", "Q: What are the differences of \"/\" and \"/home\" separately When i format my dekstop i use \"/\" and \"/Home\" as ext4 journaling file system.\nWhat are the differences  between \"/\" and  \"/home\" \n\nA: The /home directory is the directory in which all the directories which belong to users are stored, so for instance if your username is sandwich then your home directory (where all the stuff to do with your user is stored) will be in /home/sandwhich (also known as ~).\nThe / directory which is known as the 'root' directory is the directory in which all other directories are. So for instance these are all the folders and files in a standard root directory:\nbin    dev   initrd.img      lib64       mnt   root  srv  usr      vmlinuz.old\nboot   etc   initrd.img.old  lost+found  opt   run   sys  var\ncdrom  home  lib             media       proc  sbin  tmp  vmlinuz\n\nEach has its own use (for instance you will even see the home directory in there). For more information on the other directories in the root directory please see this answer.\n", "Q: Upgraded WLAN; no internet I have Ubuntu 15.10 64-bit on a Dell XPS 13.

Im noob.\n\nA: Your problem is that /dev/sda2 ends at sector 219,426,815, but /dev/sda3 begins at sector 219,426,814 -- thus, they overlap. Writing to the very end of /dev/sda2 will trash /dev/sda3, which is extremely dangerous, because /dev/sda3 is an extended partition, meaning that it's a container for /dev/sda5 and /dev/sda6. Such a write (to the end of /dev/sda2) would likely cause those last two partitions to be completely lost.\nIf I'm reading those values correctly, fixing this will be difficult. The problem is that logical partitions require at least one free sector immediately before they begin. Your /dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, and /dev/sda6 all have such gaps; but /dev/sda4 and /dev/sda5 lack such gaps and so must remain primaries. Logical partitions also must be contiguous. Given that you've got five primary or logical partitions, you must convert at least two of them to logical form to make a legal partition table. The only two that can be so converted are /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 -- but it looks like /dev/sda1 is your Windows boot partition, and converting it to logical form will render it unbootable. (Converting partitions from one form or another can be done with my FixParts program, which is part of the gdisk package in Ubuntu.)\nOverall, my first recommendation is to BACK UP EVERYTHING ON THAT DISK! This is because the disk is in an UNSAFE STATE. Anything you attempt to do to repair the disk runs the risk of creating even worse problems, so having a backup is critical.\nOnce you have a backup, one approach to fixing the problem is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using an Ubuntu live boot and gdisk, convert the disk from MBR to GPT format, as described in the gdisk documentation. This will render Windows unbootable!\n\n*Using GParted or a tool in an emergency Windows disk, resize your partitions such that there's a short gap before any partition you want to be logical. A single sector is big enough, but with GParted, it's likely to create a ~1MiB gap. That's fine. Since you're trying to install Ubuntu, you might as well open up gaps that are big enough for the Ubuntu installation -- but I wouldn't create new partitions for Ubuntu just yet.\n\n*Using gdisk, do a reverse conversion from GPT to MBR. You'll be able to select which partitions will be primary and which will be logical. Be sure that /dev/sda1 is primary.\n\n*Using a Windows emergency disk, re-install the boot loader.\n\n*Hope it works.\n\n\nThis procedure is very risky; there are any number of things that can go wrong. In the long run, though, it's probably no riskier than leaving it as-is, since your /dev/sda5 and /dev/sda6 could disappear at any moment.\nAnother approach is to back everything up, repartition, and restore everything. It may come to this if you run into serious problems with the procedure I've outlined, so be prepared to do this even if you try my suggested \"fix.\" You could also try a sort of hybrid procedure -- back up /dev/sda5 and /dev/sda6, delete them and /dev/sda3 (the extended partition that houses them) using fdisk in Ubuntu, create new partitions in their place, and then restore the data.\nYet another approach is to convert the disk to GPT form and install an EFI-mode boot loader. This will work only if you have EFI firmware, which became common starting in mid-2011; it most likely won't work on earlier computers. If you've got a newer machine, you can read about the boot mode conversion here. This approach works because GPT doesn't use logical partitions, so converting to GPT removes /dev/sda3, leaving only the partitions it contains, and the overlap is gone. (That's also why my earlier procedure converts temporarily to GPT -- your partition layout is legal in GPT, which will enable GParted to resize partitions.)\n", "Q: Cannot install Docker on Ubuntu Snappy on Raspberry Pi I use ubuntu-15.04-snappy-armhf-raspi2.img on Raspberry Pi2.\nI performed sudo snappy update then rebooted.\nNow I wanted to install docker and get a \"package not found\" error.

I tryed to delete it, do a new one, format it in FAT32 but now this is again in FAT16.\n\nA: Oldfred's analysis in his comment is correct. Some background:\nEFI (or UEFI, it's version-2.x variant) is a type of firmware. It's stored in a chip on the motherboard. EFI is a replacement for the old BIOS -- but unfortunately, many people (and even motherboard manufacturers) refer to their EFIs as \"BIOSes,\" which just creates confusion because people drag in all sorts of incorrect BIOS assumptions. An EFI-based computer boots via a boot loader stored on the EFI System Partition (ESP), which is a FAT partition on the hard disk identified by a type code. (It shows up as having a \"boot flag\" set in parted or GParted, or as having a type code of EF00 in gdisk.) Complicating matters, most EFIs have a feature called the Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which enables them to boot BIOS-mode boot loaders. The CSM is to EFI as dosemu is to Linux, in that it lets a newer and more sophisticated environment run programs designed for an older and simpler one.\nThe CSM may be one small part of your problem, in that it's enabling you to boot your recovery tools in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. That may be why you're getting the message about creating the \"BIOS-Boot partition (>1MB, unformatted filesystem, bios_grub flag)\" -- that partition is used only in BIOS-mode boots from a GPT disk. (If you've booted in EFI mode when you get that message, then Boot Repair has become hopelessly confused.) You may want to disable your CSM so that it can't cause any more problems. See this page of mine for more on the CSM and how it can create problems.\nYou can identify your boot mode by looking for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you've definitely booted in EFI mode; and if it's absent, you've probably booted in BIOS mode. (There are ways to boot in EFI mode without that directory, but Ubuntu won't normally boot that way.)\nYour Boot Repair output shows that /dev/sda1 should be an ESP:\nPartition    Start Sector    End Sector  # of Sectors System\n/dev/sda1           2,048       206,847       204,800 EFI System partition\n\nUnfortunately, it's NTFS, not FAT:\nsda1: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       ntfs\n    Boot sector type:  Windows Vista: NTFS\n\nThis could be a misidentification by Boot Repair. To double-check, you could try using blkid, as in sudo blkid /dev/sda1; or you could try mounting it and see what filesystem the kernel thinks is present by examining /etc/mtab. If this identification is correct, then chances are the utility you used to remove Windows damaged it. I recommend filing a bug report, since this is an extremely serious bug, if that's what's happened.\nUnless this is a misidentification of the filesystem, your ESP is basically gone; you cannot recover it to its former state. Instead, you must install a fresh EFI-mode boot loader. To do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a fresh FAT filesystem on /dev/sda1. Typing sudo mkdosfs /dev/sda1 from an emergency disk should do this; or you can use GParted if you prefer a GUI tool. Note that you'll also need to edit /etc/fstab on your Ubuntu root (/) filesystem (on /dev/sda7) to adjust the \"UUID\" (really a serial number) associated with /boot/efi, since creating a fresh filesystem will change that. You can learn the new \"UUID\" by typing sudo blkid /dev/sda1. You can put the /etc/fstab change off until later, if you like.\n\n*Re-install an EFI boot loader for Linux. There are many ways to do this. The two easiest are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Boot Repair -- If you can get an Ubuntu emergency disk to boot in EFI mode, it should be able to re-install GRUB and you'll be good to go. You say you've already tried this and it's failed, though. This likely means you booted in BIOS mode, although your Boot Repair output indicates an EFI-mode boot. Thus, either the repair attempt was from a different boot than the output or there's a bug in Boot Repair that's affecting your particular case.\n\n*Use rEFInd -- You can boot the computer using the CD-R or USB flash drive version of my rEFInd boot manager. (Download links for both are on this page. Once you've booted, you can install the rEFInd Debian package or PPA (after you create the FAT filesystem on the ESP). You should then be able to reboot and use rEFInd, rather than GRUB, to control the boot process.\n\n\n\nA: You should try to boot into Linux in recovery mode then root command prompt and try running boot-repair again.\nIn your case grub2 should be installed in MBR.\nAlso you should be using gparted for any disk partitioning work - that's also mentioned in your pastebin report.\nTo make things somewhat easier you can also make use of grub customizer\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install grub-customizer\ngrub-customizer\n\n\nA: Try, if you can still reach the BIOS (well, “the startup”) boot menu, e.g. with F12. If you are in luck, you can still choose there to boot into your still-existing Linux.\nOnce you are there:\napt-get install --reinstall grub-efi\n\nSource\nIf you have to go through your Linux Boot Stick (“live system”), look here, some ChRooting required...\n", "Q: Apt-get remove python ~150Mb / apt-get install python 687kb I did \nsudo apt-get remove python\n\nand it told me that about 150 MB would be freed by this operation.

In my PC, RTC is not working, So I want Date&Time from server using curl command or is there any possibilities to get date and time without RTC in PC. Required format for date&time is DDMMYYYYHHMMSS.\n\nA: If you must get the time from a remote server, use an NTP server.\nFor example:\n$ ntpq -c 'rv 0 clock' localhost\nclock=da8b6fe7.ae195287  Thu, Mar 10 2016  9:30:39.680\n\nThe clock value is the an NTP timestamp in hex (the epoch being 01/01/1900). You can process it a bit to get an Unix timestamp which you can then use with date:\n$ ntpq -c raw -c 'rv 0 clock' localhost\nOutput set to raw\nclock=0xda8b775d.ee94c630\n$ ntpq -c raw -c 'rv 0 clock' localhost | gawk -F '[ =.]' --non-decimal-data 'NR==2{printf \"@%d.%d\\n\", $2 - 2209075200, \"0x\"$3}'\n@1457497973.4177870717\n$ ntpq -c raw -c 'rv 0 clock' localhost | gawk -F '[=.]' --non-decimal-data 'NR==2{printf \"@%d.%d\\n\", $2 - 2209075200, \"0x\"$3}' | xargs date +'%d%m%Y%H%M%S' -d \n09032016100323\n\nIn my case, I have an NTP daemon running locally, which I could query, hence the usage of localhost. You could use, instead, one of the many public NTP servers, such as ntp.ubuntu.com.\nThe awk command reads the line, splits it on = and ., so that the three fields are clock, the integer part of the timestamp and the fractional part. Then, it subtracts 2209075200 (the difference in seconds between the Unix and NTP epochs, as obtained from this SO post) from the integer part and prints both the parts in decimal.\n\nA: Get the date from a HTTP response header. Remove clutter. Set the date.\n$ date -s `curl -I 'https://google.com/' 2>/dev/null | grep -i '^date:' | sed 's/^[Dd]ate: //g'`\n\nHope it helps.\n\nA: First, curl makes http(s) requests. Assuming that you have a webserver listening on the machine, so you have 2 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a script (php/asp/node) that gives you the date and time as response to the request.\n\n*Get the time from server response headers.\ncurl -v https://google.com/\n\nthis will give you among other things, a line like this \n...\n< Date: Wed, 02 Mar 2016 18:39:13 GMT\n...\n\nWith that result, you can parse and transform to the format that you want.\ndateFromServer=$(curl -v --silent https://google.com/ 2>&1 \\\n   | grep Date | sed -e 's/< Date: //'); date +\"%d%m%Y%H%M%S\" -d \"$dateFromServer\"\n\nYou must note the difference of GMT vs. local time, and adapt it to your needs.\nUpdate 2018-11-26:\nAs @SopalajodeArrierez noted, it's not possible to run this when the Certificates are not updated or the time is way off the correct value, so the --insecure options is needed on curl command.\n    dateFromServer=$(curl -v --insecure --silent https://google.com/ 2>&1 \\\n       | grep Date | sed -e 's/< Date: //'); date +\"%d%m%Y%H%M%S\" -d \"$dateFromServer\"\n\n\nA: Here's how I do it.\nI keep a switch statement for translating from the three character month representation returned from a server to the digit value of the month.

I want to completely remove windows 10 and install Ubuntu. \nI accidentally installed Ubuntu 14.04 at first (Everything was working fine at this point as far as being able to boot/reboot).\nWhen I installed 15.10 over 14.04 via USB, I used the \"erase entire disk\" option. Now I am no longer able to boot into Ubuntu (USB booting still works).\nI tried reinstalling and erase entire disk installs of 15.10 via USB.\nI tried disabling secure boot via BIOS.\nI tried every boot option possible (currently I have 3, ubuntu, Windows Boot Loader and NVMe0 SAMSUNG).\nI've also tried the Boot-Repair tool with the result here:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/15268523/\nI've tried enabling both Legacy and EFI boot modes.\nI'm not sure what else to try and get the laptop to boot Ubuntu again.\n\nA: As per the pastebin details - you haven't yet installed Ubuntu 15.10 it seems(as your grub entry still has try uubuntu)\nMoreover your pastebin also says that make sure your BIOS has the option to boot from the device which has the bootloader so please fix that in BIOS.\nIn case it's not working - try reinstall of Ubuntu 15.10 as that supports your skylake processor.\nMost probably your previous successful install of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS has created your default partitions (/ and swap) which you can re-use at the time of install.\n\nA: Try editing grub.cfg in /boot/grub/grub.cfg\nYou said you are able to boot Ubuntu 15.10 installed system through USB, didn't you?\n\nA: First, you say you were not able to boot Ubuntu after installing 14.04, but you don't give details. Any error message or symptom is a potentially important clue to what's wrong, so you must report this detail if you expect to get useful help.\nSecond, I recommend you not enable BIOS/CSM/legacy support unless you understand what you're doing. Although, in theory, Ubuntu should install in either mode, enabling the CSM creates a much more complicated boot path that provides more opportunities for things to go wrong. See this page of mine for details.\nThird, it looks like your computer has one of the new Non-Volative Memory Express (NVME) devices. These are new enough that Linux support for them is still evolving. It could be that this is at least part of the problem; perhaps a new NVME-related bug appeared in 15.10 and is causing you problems.\nFourth, as a general rule, LTS releases like 14.04 are less buggy than non-LTS releases like 15.10. Since 14.04 worked for you, one obvious solution is to re-install it. If you're more adventurous, you could try a pre-release 16.04 version. (You can get a daily build here.)\nAnother option might be to try my rEFInd boot manager: Download the USB flash drive or CD-R image, create a boot medium, and boot it. If it works, it should show you an option to boot Ubuntu. If you can boot using that option, you can install the Debian package or PPA version and it should take over the boot process. I can't promise this will work, though -- if the problem is indeed a new kernel bug related to NVME, rEFInd won't help at all. If the problem is in GRUB, rEFInd might work around it.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this is the final solution or in addition to above steps/trys I listed.\nI was able to get Ubuntu to finally install by booting off of a USB and running the disks tool to delete all previous partitions. I then installed Ubuntu from the boot and it worked! \n", "Q: Getting installation error on working package when using apt I've installed a package called leap for Leap Motion sensor.

When logging into my Ubuntu instance I get the message *** System restart required ***. I am running a server and uptime is very important for me.\nHow can I know why the restart is required? I have setup automatic security updates and I suspect one of those updates requires a restart. I only want to restart the server if the updated software is relevant to my setup.\n\nA: Any number of different updates can require you to reboot.\n\n\n*\n\n*Kernel upgrades\n\n*Some core C/C++ library changes\n\n*Updates which can only be applied with a reboot to fully close an affected service's code that is part of the core OS\n\n*Certain undefined library updates which Security Team suggests a reboot to fix (the latest glibc vulnerability for instance, or some SSL library updates)\n\n\nUnfortunately it is impossible to state what specifically is causing your system to say it needs rebooted, because there's so many potential causes for a reboot to be needed.\n\nA: Inspect the content of /var/log/dpkg.log and see what packages have been installed recently.  There have been a lot of kernel and openssl/openssh/etc vulnerabilities patched, and any services that are already running will have loaded copies of the old libraries into ram, and they will stay there continuing to be vulnerable until you either manually restart the affected services, or you simply reboot the host.  If the package that was upgraded was a kernel package (linux-image, etc) then a reboot is the only way to get the new kernel runnning.\nsudo zgrep -h 'status installed' /var/log/dpkg.log* | sort | tail -n 100\n\nwill show you the last 100 packages installed on your host.  It's up to you to decide if you want to reboot it or not.\nI believe there is a setting you can add to the unattended-upgrades package that will allow it to reboot automatically when the update is complete.  If you can set the upgrades to occur at, say, 3am when you know load is light, the impact of such a reboot may be minimal.  \nUnattended-upgrades does, as I understand, only install packages where there is a security impact, so I wouldn't put off rebooting the server very long if it's exposed to the public internet.\n", "Q: Wifi Dongle hard blocked by wifi card I have recently installed Linux (Lubuntu 15.10) on a computer that had running Windows Vista before and I'm stuck with enabling the wifi.\nTwo years ago, while still running Windows, the internal wifi card stopped working.

Even then Chrome will quickly eat up all your RAM with only a few tabs open, especially with \"app\" type sites like gmail that use a lot of javascript. You will probably have to reinstall with the 64-bit version if you want to utilise more than 3GB RAM though.\n\n*A solid state drive (SSD) will greatly enhance your system's performance and is probably easier to find than compatible RAM.\nYou can use it in addition to the current internal disk and migrate Ubuntu onto the new drive without re-installation. My tip would be to keep your personal files in the /home directory on the rotational disk though, since they have far less impact on the system performance and SSD storage is more expensive (also see What are the pros and cons of having a separate home partition? and the Ubuntu Help on moving the home directory).\nA freshly formatted filesystem will always run faster as files can be laid down in sequential blocks but as time goes on and files are re-written, fragmentation occurs so the disk has to seek to other areas of the platter.\n\nA: Waddles already made worthwhile suggestions for possible hardware upgrades to relieve likely performance bottlenecks on your system.\nFrom a software choice and operating system configuration side I recommend to\n\n\n*\n\n*enable zswap to alleviate the main memory shortage,\n\n*install additional, proprietary device drivers for the graphics adapter to make better use of it's graphics acceleration features,\n\n*look into How can I improve Ubuntu overall system performance? for generic ideas and system tunables – not all answers and suggestions there are worthwhile any longer in general or in your particular case.\n", "Q: Change prolog versions So I installed prolog version 7.2.3 on my Ubuntu system (v14.04) but I would like to uninstall this from my system and install prolog version 6.x\nI remember using \nsudo apt-get install swi-prolog \n\nBut that was just to install v7.2.3.

Just got linux on it and things are mostly good.\nI am able to run hangouts fine in Firefox. However, in Chrome, the video is completely green. I have been unable to find references to this phenomenon.\n\n\nA: This happens because you have a laptop equipped with an Intel RealSense camera. The camera is meant for motion detection and the lines you see are distance contours.\nI had the same problem. It turned out that /dev/video0 was pointing to this camera instead of the webcam (which was at /dev/video1). The camera used for other webcam-based applications in Google Chrome can be set through Settings -> Content settings -> Camera, but Google Hangouts does not respect this choice and insists on using whatever is at /dev/video0 (perhaps because the choice is made through the Google talk plugin rather than Chrome).\nI solved this problem by writing a bash function to switch /dev/video0 and /dev/video1 so that Hangouts picks the right camera. Clearly a hack and there should be a better way to do this, but it works!\n\nA: At least as of now, you can select the camera device in Google Hangouts: click on vertical ... -> Settings -> General tab -> Video and select the desired camera from the drop down.\n", "Q: How to Create Server from my Local Machine with Internet Connection? I want to know How to setup Server with ubuntu from my local machine? whether it cost me extra ? want some brief explanation regarding this...\n\nA: \"Server\" installations are normally installations geared towards primarily just packages for lighter-weight UI's and less \"Workstation/Client\" packages. In the end you can really take any installation and add/remove the packages you want to create your machine. \nThe underlying rule to move towards performance is less=more. Meaning only install the packages/binaries you require to get your \"server\" online for whatever \"service\" you plan on hosting.\nWhen it comes to cost or licensing you are looking at what your support contract will be for Ubuntu and the cost of power for your machine.\n", "Q: Is there any way to create a custom PS1 for particular terminal profile Since I find the custom terminal a bit bland, I like using the PS1 variable to make it more informative, and use a background image and custom text colours. I like the profile functionality, so I have a couple of profiles, but they all use the same PS1 variable. Is there any wya to create a custom PS1 for each profile?\n\nA: There's no way to query the profile itself, but in newer gnome-terminal versions (and several other emulators) you can query the colors using commands like e.g. xtermcontrol --get-fg for the foreground, and similar options for the other colors. You can branch based on its output in .bashrc to set up different PS1.\nYour gnome-terminal might be too old for this, though, since you mention you use background images which are no longer supported by recent gnome-terminal versions.\n", "Q: How to Recover Deleted Windows Partition with complete Data?

You can use simple utilities like testdisk to detect the deleted partitions and restore them.\nAssuming your disk drive is located at /dev/sdb, you can check using fdisk -l /dev/sdb\nLaunch testdisk and follow the ons screen process to recover your partitions.\nSimply: When asked to create logs, select[No Log]. Proceed with selecting [Analyse] to scan for the deleted partitions. This should detect the drives in your PC where you will be able to select the correct disk and [Proceed]. Just select [Intel] if you have a MBR disk layout. It will then scan and detect the deleted partitions.\nIf you are happy with the layout you can then [Write] the partition layout to disk. Otherwise you can perform a [Deeper Search] to detect partitions that may have been deleted.\nThis guide here follows the process above with screenshots. Additionally you can burn the livecd to a CD or burn the image to a USB stick to get access to the testdisk tool.\n", "Q: juju: can't add machines again after the destroy-machine command I have destroyed machines using \n$ juju destroy-machine <machine_id>\n\nbut can't add the machines again. \nWhenever, i do add with this command\n$ juju add-machine --constraints tags=virtual, controller\n\njuju stat shows a new machine in error state.\nI have tried\n$ juju add-machine <machine_name>\n\nas well, but same thing is happening.\nAm i missing something?\n\nA: The comma-delimited list of tags shouldn't have a space between them.

But when I tried to install Netbeans It said that:\nJava SE Development Kit (JDK) was not found on this computer\n\nWhat is my problem here?\n\nA: You can install Oracle's Java Development Kit (Oracle JDK) from the webupd8 PPA by running the commands below from a terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer\n\nThis will add their PPA to your software sources, update your software index and then install their currently latest build of the Oracle JDK 8. At the date of writing, this should be version 8u74.\nThe advantages of this approach over your attempt to convert an rpm package are that the binaries were specifically built for your Ubuntu version and that the package manager will automatically handle updates.\n\nIf there's no special reason to use Oracle JDK, you can also just use the open source implementation, the OpenJDK 8 JDK:\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk\n\nDifferences between Oracle JDK and OpenJDK include that OpenJDK might miss some rarely used proprietary multimedia libraries and that it does not come with a web applet launcher by default. This functionality is outsourced and available under the name icedtea. Unfortunately there's no icedtea-8-plugin in the official repositories yet, so if you need to run Java web applets, you must install another PPA to get icedtea-8-plugin if you go for OpenJDK. If you never use Java web applets, there's absolutely no need for that plugin though.\n", "Q: Which partitions to delete for uninstalling ubuntu? I want to uninstall Ubuntu.

So to be safe, boot windows 10 and restore your windows bootloader like this:\nbootsect /nt60 drive_letter: /mbr\n\nDrive letter of course has to be replaced with the drive letter where your operating system resides, so probably the command will look like this for you:\nbootsect /nt60 C: /mbr\n\nThen you can boot any partitioning tool of your choice and safely delete the ubuntu partitions.\n", "Q: Remove / purge repository spotify and opensuse When I go to Software & Updates and then to Other Software I get this boxes unchecked: http://repository.spotify.com stable non-free and http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/Horst3180/xUbuntu_15.10//.\n\nIf I check them I am unable to download the updates, it will fail because of them, I guess.\nI tried to install Spotify so I guess that is the reason they are there.\nI have Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 on my machine.

Hence, my script will take as parameters the directory to start with, the username and the size. This is what I have so far:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nowner=\"valdsilviufarcas\"\nsize=0\n\nfunction display_owner_and_size()\n{\n    owner=`stat --format \"%s\" $1`\n    size=`stat --format \"%U\" $1` \n}\n\nfunction search()\n{\n\n    for elem in $1/*\n    do\n        display_owner_and_size \"$elem\"\n        if [[ $owner == $2 && $size > $3 ]]\n        then\n            echo $elem\n        fi\n        if test -d \"$elem\"\n        then\n            search \"$elem\" $2 $3    \n        fi\n    done\n}\n\nsearch $1 $2 $3\n\nHowever, I keep getting this error: Cannot stat: (bla-bla-bla) : No such file or directory. Why is the stat function not working?\n\nA: There are two different issues.\nThe first one is you're not quoting your variables: this ultimately makes stat fail for that reason:\n\n\n*\n\n*search $1 $2 $3 should be search \"$1\" \"$2\" \"$3\";\n\n*for elem in $1/* should be for elem in \"$1\"/*;\n\n*owner=`stat --format \"%s\" $1` should be owner=`stat --format \"%s\" \"$1\"`;\n\n*size=`stat --format \"%U\" $1` should be size=`stat --format \"%U\" \"$1\"`;\n\n*search \"$elem\" $2 $3 should be search \"$elem\" \"$2\" \"$3\".\n\n\nThe second one is when an empty directory is reached during the recursion, the expansion of for element in $1/* fails and the two stat commands are called on /path/to/empty/directory/*, which doesn't exist:\n% bash script.sh /home/user user 0\nstat: cannot stat ‘/home/user/Documenti/Musica/*’: No such file or directory\nstat: cannot stat ‘/home/user/Documenti/Musica/*’: No such file or directory\nstat: cannot stat ‘/home/user/Documenti/My Games/*’: No such file or directory\nstat: cannot stat ‘/home/user/Documenti/My Games/*’: No such file or directory\nstat: cannot stat ‘/home/user/Documenti/Video/*’: No such file or directory\nstat: cannot stat ‘/home/user/Documenti/Video/*’: No such file or directory\nstat: cannot stat ‘/home/user/home/user/*’: No such file or directory\nstat: cannot stat ‘/home/user/home/user/*’: No such file or directory\nstat: cannot stat ‘/home/user/Modelli/*’: No such file or directory\nstat: cannot stat ‘/home/user/Modelli/*’: No such file or directory\nstat: cannot stat ‘/home/user/Musica/*’: No such file or directory\nstat: cannot stat ‘/home/user/Musica/*’: No such file or directory\nstat: cannot stat ‘/home/user/Pubblici/*’: No such file or directory\nstat: cannot stat ‘/home/user/Pubblici/*’: No such file or directory\nstat: cannot stat ‘/home/user/Video/*’: No such file or directory\nstat: cannot stat ‘/home/user/Video/*’: No such file or directory\n% \n\nOne way to fix that would be checking whether the file / directory exists before calling display_owner_and_size, so that to skip the current iteration if we're attempting to stat / traverse a directory that doesn't exist (since the directory is empty there's no reason to stat its content nor to keep traversing that branch of the tree):\n[ -e \"$elem\" ] && display_owner_and_size \"$elem\" || continue\n\nAdding to that, other errors are:\n\n\n*\n\n*owner=`stat --format \"%s\" \"$1\"` should be owner=`stat --format \"%U\" \"$1\"` and size=`stat --format \"%U\" \"$1\"` should be size=`stat --format \"%s\" \"$1\"`;\n\n*You can't use > to make numerical comparisons. Use -gt: if [[ $owner == $2 && $size -gt $3 ]].\n\n\nSo the corrected script would be:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nowner=\"valdsilviufarcas\"\nsize=0\n\nfunction display_owner_and_size()\n{\n    owner=`stat --format \"%U\" \"$1\"`\n    size=`stat --format \"%s\" \"$1\"`\n}\n\nfunction search()\n{\n\n    for elem in \"$1\"/*\n    do\n        [ -e \"$elem\" ] && display_owner_and_size \"$elem\" || continue\n        if [[ $owner == $2 && $size -gt $3 ]]\n        then\n            echo $elem\n        fi\n        if test -d \"$elem\"\n        then\n            search \"$elem\" \"$2\" \"$3\"    \n        fi\n    done\n}\n\nsearch \"$1\" \"$2\" \"$3\"\n\n\nA: You should simply use the find command:\nfind ${dir} -user ${user} -type f -size +${size}c -printf \"%u\\t%s\\t%h/%f\\n\"\n\nReplace the Bash variables ${dir} with the directory to examine recursively, ${user} with the user name or UID that should be displayed only and ${size} with the minimum file size in bytes (not inclusive! if you use the value 100, the smallest file that gets displayed can have 101 bytes).\nThis command will only print regular files, it ignores directories and special files like symlinks or devices in the output.\n", "Q: How to rename only user on Ubuntu Server 14.04 ?

It seems that PEAR parses help text and config info at startup and (I'm assuming) it's stored as XML somewhere\n", "Q: Printer settings replaced automatically At work I print to a network printer, then release my print at any one of the hundreds of printers dotted around campus. The make and model show up as:\nSharp MX-5141N PS, 1.0\n\nI set my computer up to connect to the printer on the appropriate URI using the ldp: protocol. I install the provided ppd driver. Once I've done this I can print to the network printers for a short time.\nMy question is that after a short amount of time (typically < 12 hours) Ubuntu automatically updates the printer I just set up and replaces the ldp with a local connection to the same printer shared through a colleague's MacBook. Through this indirect connect I can't (and don't want to) print.\nHow can I:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stop Ubuntu replacing my printer configuration with the shared printer it finds?\n\n*Or, stop Ubuntu browsing for printers altogether (note: Browsing Off is already set in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf)\n\n\nI've already checked out the responses to Stop Ubuntu discovering printers but this did not answer my question (I'm not looking to 'bump' my printer to the top of the list; I want to stop its settings being overridden).\nThanks.\n\nA: I think I figured the issue out. When I set the printer up, I gave it the same name my colleague had (the default), so when rebooting this was updating my printer with my colleague's settings over the network.\nTo mitigate the issue, I set the printer up and gave it a unique name. This has now persisted through a couple of reboots, so I expect this has solved the problem (unless someone else on the network uses the name I've chosen!).\n", "Q: Uninstall default scopes in a ubuntu phone I am using an ubuntu phone (version OTA-9.1). I want to delete extra scopes. When I search them in the Ubuntu Store with the keyword scope, i cannot reach more than 100 entries. This means that I cannot delete scope like youtube scope without searching them one by one.\nDo you have any solution to uninstall these scopes without searching them one by one?\nEdit\nAs it is written here http://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/there-is-a-sentence-in-this-ubuntu-phone-interview-that-worries-me-a-bit/2071/5 the  Yahoo Finance is installed by BQ and it seems there is no way to remove it. Does someone got a solution?\n\nA: Simply go to the apps-scope and tap for a loong time to that app you would like to uninstall. The Phone will switch automatically to the app-Store showing the corresponding app.\n\nA: Some (but not all) scopes can be unregistered using the terminal app or another way to get a terminal on the phone and the click application. See How do I un-install / remove a click package for more information, and take a look at the other options to use click and use $ click list to determine the name of installed packages.\n\nI know that this isn't necessarily a full removal for some scopes / apps, as they might persist as unused files, but it is the next thing I know.\nThis does not work for all scopes (e.g. apps not managed by click don't appear), but that way I could remove / unregister certain scopes I did not find in the Ubuntu Store.\nHowever, I still have the Yahoo Finance scope you mention in the comment installed, not knowing how to remove it.\n", "Q: Can't use \"apt-get install\" anymore due to \"unmet dependencies\" I don't remember having done anything fancy on my computer recently, but I can't run apt-get install anymore\n$ sudo apt-get install phantomjs\nReading package lists...

I made some attempts but I have no idea :(\n\nA: You must ensure that both the 32bit (libnspr4:i386) and 64bit (libnspr4) builds of a library are present in the same version. \nFor whatever reason (only partial upgrade or installed a PPA maybe?) only one architecture got upgraded and the other not, it seems.\nThe 64bit build is still stuck at an older version which is not even downloadable any more. We upgrade it to the same version as the 32bit build from the updates/main repository:\nsudo apt-get install libnspr4=4.10.10-0ubuntu0.12.04.1\n\nThis should resolve the conflicts.\n\nUpdate:\nAs my first attempt did not work, we're now going to force-remove both architectures of the package while leaving all packages that depend on them installed and then cleanly reinstall them. \nYou should close all running stuff and do nothing in between the removing and installing, because I don't know which of your applications depend on this and could possibly crash while it's missing. \nThen run the following commands in this sequence:\nsudo apt-get autoclean\nsudo dpkg --remove --force-depends libnspr4 libnspr4:i386\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\n\nAdditionally to keep the package system in good shape and free some space, I recommend to also run these commands. They will remove outdated cached binary installation packages from your disk and remove old packages that are no longer required, including some old kernels:\nsudo apt-get autoclean\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\n\nA: Your problem is that both i386 and amd64 versions of the packages have to be identical in both architectures, you need to make them match. Instead of trying to remove the packages, which is a bad idea, you may want to download and install both of them:\napt-get download libnspr4:amd64 libnspr4:i386\nsudo dpkg --force-depends-version -i libnspr4*.deb\n\nThis will assure you that both packages are installed without dependency problems that you may have to fix later.\n", "Q: Gparted Won't start due to a bug I want to extend my home partition size but Gparted won't start.

Where can I add some events?\n\nA: \ni want to run this script when my ac-adapter is unplugged or the\n  ac-adapter gets plugged in\n\nThere's a couple of ways. I've written a script specifically for that purpose , which uses on_ac_power script that comes with Ubuntu by default. This method simply uses infinite while loop to constantly poll the return of on_ac_power. Starting this script is done using Startup Applications app which launches commands when user logs into Gnome or Unity.\nAnother approach is via ACPI events. As shown on Arch Wiki , you can place a script into /etc/acpi folder that will perform checks for the presence of a specific AC adapter in /sys/class/backlight folder, and change a specific value in a file accordingly.\n", "Q: How can I rename a color profile and change the title stored in the ICC file? I have a number of ICC color profile files for monitor calibration.

You can do the parsing yourself, however, with a script that searches and extracts the name of each extension/app until it finds the name you search for:\n/usr/local/bin/chrome-app-by-name:\n\n#!/bin/zsh\nemulate -R zsh -o extendedglob -o nullglob\nsetopt rematchpcre ;# recommended, I'm so used to PCRE, I sometimes forget what doesn't work in Regex\nChrome_Profile=Default  ;# or \"Profile 1\" ...\ncd ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/google-chrome/${Chrome_Profile}/Extensions\nforeach app in */*\n   # We have just called the path to each version of each extension/app.\n   # Next we enclose in braces - slightly unnecessary - to ensure that\n   #  whatever version of Zsh, \"manifest.json\" is completely read and \n   #  closed before we use the variable.\n   {\n      App_Manifest=\"$(cat <$app/manifest.json)\"\n   }\n   if [[ $App_Manifest =~ '^\\s*\"name\"\\s*:\\s*\"([a-zA-Z 0-9_.-]+)\"' ]]\n   then\n      app_name=\"$match[1]\" ;# capture the sub-expression match for \"name\"\n      if [[ $app_name == $1 ]]\n      then\n         # For my system this is actually exec google-chrome-stable ...\n         exec google-chrome --app-id=\"${app%%/*}\" $argv[2,-1]\n      fi\n   fi\nend\necho \"App name not found.  Please use Exact, case-sensitive spelling.\"\n\nSome apps set their names deeper in the scripts - I don't know why!  You may have to re-write or add to a script like this one to search \".desktop\" files in ~/.local/share/applications for their '^NAME=...' equivalent to the above, and then get the execution command there.\nI have not tested this script - I just wrote it on the fly to answer your question.  I hope that as an example it works for you, but if the idea is not quite right, we could tweak it a bit.  Zsh is simple, strait-forward syntax compared to some other sh-compatible shells.  I have tried to leave out any features that require new versions or modules except for PCRE.  PCRE is so much easier to use for the exact pattern matching I often need that I neglect regular Regex most of the time.  A longer Perl script could work, also most of this syntax will run unmodified in /bin/bash. foreach ... end, $match[1] style arrays, setopt rematchpcre, the exact systax of Bash Regex, and emulate are the main exceptions.\n\nA: *\n\n*Open the folder in which the apps are stored in your terminal. \n\n*Run chmod +x *.desktop\n\n*Go back to the graphical folder in which your apps reside\n\n*Now they should have icons and they correct names\n\n*Right-click the app you want to launch\n\n*Click properties\n\n*In the Command line that is listed about halfway down is the command used to open that app.\n\n\nA: In BASH term use this to launch your gmail ETC:\ngoogle-chrome --app=https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox \n\ni have this on my mail watcher setup too!\n", "Q: Not able to sudo after running `chown -R username:usergroup /*` I am fairly new to Ubuntu.

Since there is not a way to get this operation reverted as is discussed here: What if I accidentally run command \"chmod -R\" on system directories (/, /etc, ...), you may have to backup your files and reinstall. That's why sudo warns you that you should use root privilege with care.\nWell, you can definitely fix the ownership of sudo by using a Live CD/USB, but I would expect there be many other problems from other applications.

Let's clear up some things:\n\n\n*\n\n*zlib is a builtin, not a packaged thing. Virtualenvs are great things but won't help here.\n\n*If you don't have it, it wasn't built when Python was built.\n\n*You need the zlib development libraries in order for Python to be linked to it. If the ./configure step can't find it, it'll disable it from your build.\n\n\nSo that having been said, sudo apt-get build-dep python2.7 will be the sanest, quickest way to get all the build dependencies for a \"typical\" Python build.\nBut then you need to reconfigure, recompile and reinstall your version of Python. Just installing the build requirements won't retroactively link it in.\n\nA: As far as I know, there is no Python package that contains zlib because that's already included into the standard library.\nTry the command below to see whether the zlib Python package is available and which version it has:\n\n\n*\n\n*for Python 2.x:  \npython -c \"import zlib; print(zlib.__version__)\"\n\n\n*for Python 3.x:  \npython3 -c \"import zlib; print(zlib.__version__)\"\n\nOn my system, it outputs 1.0 for both Python versions.\n\nA: *\n\n*$ sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev\n\n*$ wget python.org/ftp/python/2.7.10/Python-2.7.10.tgz\n\n*$ tar xfz Python-2.7.10.tgz\n\n*$ cd Python-2.7.9/\n\n*$ ./configure --prefix /path/to/python/ --enable-ipv6\n(in my case path was /usr/local )\n\n*$ make\n\n*$ sudo make install\n\n\ncheck: $ python2.7 -c \"import zlib; print(zlib.version)\"\nGrand thanks to all of you guys for helping with this problem!\n\nA: I highly recommend using virtualenv for a local install of Python that has the same minor version as the one that comes with Ubuntu (2.7.x), I'm quite new myself and had a lot of issues attempting to install packages to a local version without it, whereas with it you can simply create and activate a new environment and install to your hearts content without changing the global package list.\nUser guide:\nhttp://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/userguide.html\nThere's an answer here for taking an already installed python version and creating a virtualenv with that version. Once you activate the environment you should then be able to check if you have zlib with that version by default, and install it if you don't have it already.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/1534210/use-different-python-version-with-virtualenv\n\nA: You need to install the zlib1g-dev package and then run: sudo apt-get build-dep python2.7\nAfter installing the dev package, continue to install the zlib package.\nIf the above thing does not work:\n\n\n*\n\n*download the source package for your Python (in this case wget python.org/ftp/python/2.7.10/Python-2.7.10.tgz)\n\n*run ./configure --prefix=/path/to/python\n\n*make\n\n*make install\n\nA: This solution I found on python.org compilation page.\nsudo apt-get build-dep python3.6\n\nIf that package is not available for your system, try reducing the minor version until you find a package that is available in your system’s package manager.\nI added the detail instruction on a blog post.\n", "Q: What are the possible commands to reset a wifi connection?

How to install this thing properly?

You are probably missing the extra-cmake-modules package.\nOne tool that I find extremely helpful in diagnosing unclear dependencies is the apt-file utility that lets you search filenames of packages you don't have installed.  Install apt-file and then run apt-file update to download the file cache.

Around the beginning of March 2016, Google dropped their 32bit builds for Chrome. On 64bit Ubuntu, Software Updater expects to see both 32bit and 64bit versions of packages in a given repository. Since Google removed the 32bit version, Software Updater can't find that package anymore and produces an error that shows up as Failed to download repository information, Check your internet connection.\nFix the repo\nIn order to fix this, you have to tell the package manager that the Google repository is 64bit-only. To do this you have to edit the Google repository file to add [arch=amd64] after the deb at the beginning of the line. The following snippet will check if the error is indeed with the Google repository and make the change for you. Make sure you copy the whole snippet (it's one line) and paste it in your favorite terminal:\nurl=http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/; if sudo apt-get update 2>&1 >/dev/null | grep --quiet \"$url\"; then for file in $(sudo grep -Rl \"deb $url\" /etc/apt/); do sudo sed -i 's/^deb/deb [arch=amd64]/' \"$file\"; done; fi\n\nUpgrade Chrome\nClose and re-run Software Updater and upgrade Chrome to the latest version - 49.0.2623.87-1 or later.\n\nA: I added [arch=amd64] to the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list as suggested but was still getting the error.\nI noticed there was a second possible reason for the error.\nOn my system there is a file called additiona-repositories.list in /etc/apt/sources.list.d.\nThis file also needed the [arch=amd64] added in order to clear the error.\nI added directly to the url using the update manager \"mintUpdate 4.9.3.3\" by clicking on edit>software sources, entering my password, selecting \"additional repositories (on the left), highlighting the item that matched: \ndeb http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main\n\nClicking \"Update URL\" and adding [arch=amd64] just after the deb as such:\ndeb [arch=amd64] http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main\n\nThough it's not as fancy as the terminal method it'll work for those of us that are GUI oriented.\n\nA: I'm using 14.04 64 bit and also getting \"Failed to download repository information\".  I used the code snippet.  I then ran the software updater ... It ran perfectly and I updated to the latest google chrome.\nI ran the software updater a second time.

I dual booted Windows 10 with Ubuntu 15.10 and noticed, that on Ubuntu NVIDIA card is always on what makes my battery last about 2h. Can I disable that card and force system to run on Intel integrated graphics? I use Ubuntu only for coding so I don't need advanced graphics enabled. Also, I can't disable card in BIOS since I'm using it on Windows.\n\nA: Yes, you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open NVIDIA X Server Settings.\n\n*Go to PRIME Profiles.\n\n*Select Intel.\n\n*Log out and back in or reboot.\n\n\nNow you are using Intel graphics.  \n\n\nUpdate addressing your comments that you cannot access NVIDIA X Server Settings: \nTo open NVIDIA X Server Settings press the Super key (it's the Windows key) and type \"NVIDIA\".  \nIf it doesn't appear, maybe the installation of the NVIDIA drivers is not complete.\nIn that case, open a terminal and execute:  \nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get install nvidia-prime nvidia-settings\n\nThen look for it again and you will find it.\n", "Q: Automated Shell script to run fdisk command with user input I'd like to create a bash shell script that can run commands and provide input as if I was typing it on the  terminal.\nI have written bash shell scripts before and understand how to but I'm a bit confused on how it 'interfaces'.\nCurrently, I'm required to run fdisk and other terminal commands and then go through their option panel providing a set/specified input. It is taking too long and since it is constant, I was  wondering then how I would go about it.\nI get that a shell script is like if you were to type that command into the terminal. Thus, can I just literally write a script that says something like:\nsudo fdisk /dev/sda\n\nd\n\n1\n\nd\n\n2\n\nn\n\np\n\n1\n\nAs an example where the single string entries are what I type on my keyboard as fdisk waits for commands. This doesn't seem valid but it may be.\nAlso, something I have to do after those commands run is unplug the drive and then continue running it. Am I able to implement that into my program to wait for me to unplug, and replug and then continue running automated script?\nI appreciate  all the help.\n\nA: I wrote myself a little script using the fdisk command, based on what I know plus bits of code found online, which does something very similar, namely, interactively format a drive into one or more partitions, asking if this is the correct drive, waiting for a set time, or input from the user, warning it is about to erase it, etc. One thing it cannot do, in its current form, is resume running after it's stopped for any reason, from getting the input \"No, don't format!\" from the user, or simply an error. Once it stops, it has to be run again.\nNote: $(echo $Output_Device) is a shell variable, and can be replaced with e.g. sdb or any similar name for a disk device.\nThe actual fdisk command(s) I cobbled together are: \nFormats the disk into two partitions, 1 of size 64Mb, and 2 the rest of the disk:\n(echo o; echo n; echo p; echo 1; echo \"\"; echo +64M; echo n; echo p; echo 2; echo \"\"; echo \"\"; echo w; echo q) | fdisk /dev/$(echo $Output_Device)\n\nThen, actually formats the partitions, 1 as FAT, 2 as ext3:\nmkfs.vfat -n BOOT /dev/$(echo $Output_Device)1\n\nmkfs.ext3 -L root /dev/$(echo $Output_Device)2\n\nI can post the whole script, but it is messy, and I like to keep commands in it even when they're commented out, for my own reference.\nThe more general case, how to make it resume, I may or may not be able to do, haven't tried. Likewise, this works with fdisk, but other commands may/will need a different syntax.\n\nA: The below script is to create swap space automatically.\n#!/bin/bash \nset -x\n\nDEVICE=\"/dev/xvdf\"\n\nDISKID=$(blkid $DEVICE | cut -d' ' -f2 | cut -d\\\" -f2)\n\ncat <<EOF | fdisk /dev/xvdf    #reads the disk utiliy\nn   \np\n1\n\n\nt\n82\nw\nEOF\n\n\npartprobe $DEVICE\n\nmkswap $DEVICE\n\necho \"UUID=$DISKID    swap    swap   defaults   0   0\" >> /etc/fstab\n\nswapon -a\n\nfree -g >> /mstr/output.txt\n\nset +x\n\n", "Q: How can I make permanent permissions for a directory using chmod?

That's actually what the no_root_squash option does.\nroot_squash\n    Map requests from uid/gid 0 to the anonymous uid/gid.

I know that people asked about it - whether to put your /var partition on SSD? Why and why not? Many people said that it's not good idea to put it to SSD cause it wears off the SSD and can harm your drive. Here are decent tests to show you that it's not harmful for SSD to put there your /var partition. Have a look:\nIntroducing the SSD Endurace Experiment\nThe SSD Endurance Experiment: They're all dead\nWhat do you think about it?\nI ask because I'm about to put /var on SSD before installing Linux and would like to have some fresh view on it.\n\nA: If you are just asking for personally opinions, I would say, don't care about wearing off issues. You buy SSDs for daily usage and for experience improvement, not as part of your personal collection. Things always degrade gradually.\nActually, for most Windows and Mac OS X SSD users, in most of the cases their entire system runs on the SSD, including logging and whatever else, sometimes even swap files.\nHowever if you have some other application that really requires high-frequency r/w operations, you may think of using RAM disks with loading on start-up and backup upon shutdown. I am not sure if this works for /var though...\n\nA: In short, here's the basic ruleset for determining whether or not to put a partition on your SSD:\n\nSo basically, always put it on your SSD if you need high speed, or if you have space for it.  The more on the SSD the better.  Modern SSDs will take a beating before they die, and they will let you know if something is wrong.\n\nA: To give you an insight, I´ve been using an SSD on my Macbook Pro for everything the last 3years.

Here's an question that should help you: Dual boot Surface Pro with Ubuntu?\nAs for an alternative to Microsoft Word, OpenOffice or LibreOffice works 99.9% of the time.  Ubuntu Desktop with the GNOME interface (the default setup for the image available from http://www.ubuntu.com/) includes LibreOffice by default, so you don't have to install anything.\n\nA: You can also run Office 2010 with PlayOnLinux.\n\nA: The gist\nThe standard dual boot works with the basic features. The best tutorial on that is here.\nAdditionally, I'd recommend running these commands from this tutorial on Reddit once you're done installing Ubuntu (some may be outdated):\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\necho \"deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/tigerite/kernel/ubuntu trusty main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tigerite-kernel-trusty.list\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 984AE706D31B333A && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install linux-surface\n\nA couple notes\n\n\n*\n\n*While most people seem to be suggesting the Surface Book's keyboard won't work until additional drivers are added, I'm in the process of installing a dual-boot on a Book right now and the keyboard works just fine in USB Live.\n\n*You may need to disable BitLocker, System Restore, and/or defrag before shrinking the C: Drive in order to get a decent size partition.\na. Disable System Restore: \nPlease note this can really screw things up, so be careful and don't download any updates or viruses while System Restore is off or you could brick your machine. If that happens, reference this tutorial.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the Start button, then search \"System Restore\"\n\n*Select \"create a restore point\". This will allow you to remove System Restore.\n\n*Select \"configure\"\n\n*Select \"turn off system restore\"\n\n\nb. Disable BitLocker: \n\n\n*\n\n*Press the Start button, then search \"Manage BitLocker\"\n\n*Select \"suspend BitLocker\" or \"Turn off BitLocker\" \n(I recommend trying to suspend first, but I ended up turning it off)\n\n\nc. Defrag the C: Drive\n\n\n*\n\n*Do the whole start button thingy with \"defrag\"\n\n*Select \"Analyze\" if possible (don't worry if it's not)\n\n*Select \"Optimize\"\n\n\nd. Turn everything back on once you're done!\nGenerally a good idea, but it's really up to you. To turn them back on, follow the same steps as above, but enable things instead of disabling them.\nHope that helps, and good luck!\n", "Q: bell turbo stick is not connected to Ubuntu 14.04 i have bell turbo stick which is not able to connect to Ubuntu 14.04. is there any way to connect it and access internet through it. \n\nA: please review this guide http://www.westernwillow.com/cms/blog/franco/making-bell-turbo-stick-work-ubuntu by Franco Nogarin to make it work in Ubuntu.\n", "Q: \"unmet dependencies\" after upgrading to Ubuntu 15.10 I upgraded ubuntu to 15.10, then I tried to compile a gtk app and found out I had no GTK installed.\nSo I ran\nsudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev\n\nbut this is the output\nReading package lists...

I disabled Secure Boot and enabled CSM in the bios. I'm not sure what else I need to do to make it work. Can I edit the burg-mkconfig file to force it to appear?\nAny help would be appreciated; thank you!\n\nA: The last I heard, BURG was a BIOS-only boot loader. You appear to have an EFI-based installation of Windows. As such, BURG will be useless for booting Windows, or for controlling the overall boot process; the best you can do with BURG is to use it to select your Linux kernel, and leave the Windows-vs-Ubuntu boot choice to something else. I tried to track down more concrete information on this, but the best I found was package information at https://launchpad.net/~n-muench/+archive/ubuntu/burg/+packages, which indicates no EFI package for BURG. I couldn't even find an active home page for BURG, which could mean it's been abandoned (or maybe Google's just doing a very bad job on this search).\nIf you want to use BURG because of its graphical nature, you may want to look into my rEFInd boot manager instead. Like BURG, rEFInd is graphics-oriented and themable, although the themes are not compatible. Unlike BURG, rEFInd is designed for EFI-based computers, which yours seems to be.\nNote that if you're currently booting Ubuntu via BURG, installing rEFInd may be tricky, because you're booting Ubuntu in BIOS mode. You may need to create and boot via a USB flash drive or CD-R image of rEFInd (downloadable images are available on the rEFInd downloads page). Once you boot in this way, you'll be in EFI mode, and can install the rEFInd PPA or Debian package. Alternatively, you can install rEFInd from Windows -- but the procedure for doing that is more tedious than the Ubuntu installation procedure, particularly if Secure Boot is active on your computer.\n", "Q: Kbd shortcut to close application menu in Xfce desktop manager (ubuntu 14.04) I've modified my keyboard shortcut to open the popup application menu.

Get it with the command below:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-web-photo\n\nHelp overview:\nHere are the options that gnome-web-photo supports:\n$ gnome-web-photo --help\nUsage:\n  gnome-web-photo [OPTION...]\n\nHelp Options:\n  -h, --help                 Show help options\n  --help-all                 Show all help options\n  --help-gtk                 Show GTK+ Options\n\nApplication Options:\n  -m, --mode                 Operation mode [photo|thumbnail|print]\n  -c, --user-css=CSSFILE     User style sheet to use for the page (default: /usr/share/gnome-web-photo/style.css)\n  -d, --delay=D              Delay in seconds to wait after page is loaded, or 0 to disable delay (default: 0)\n  -t, --timeout=T            Timeout in seconds to wait to load the page, or 0 to disable timeout (default: 60)\n  -f, --force                Force output when timeout expires, even if the page is not fully loaded\n  -w, --width=W              Desired width of the web page (default: 1024)\n  -s, --thumbnail-size=S     Thumbnail size (default: 256)\n  -p, --printer=PRINTER      Print page on PRINTER (default: none, save as PDF)\n  --print-background         Print background images and colours (default: false)\n  --disable-plugins          Disable embedded plugins in the rendering engine (default: enable plugins)\n  --file                     Argument is a file and not a URI\n  --display=DISPLAY          X display to use\n\nUsage examples:\nTo capture e.g. http://askubuntu.com as PNG image, you could type the following command:\ngnome-web-photo \"http://askubuntu.com\" askubuntu.png\n\nHere is the created PNG image: external link to image on imgur.com\nIf you want a PDF like the print preview you would get from your browser instead of a PNG, use gnome-web-print. It's a shortcut for gnome-web-photo --mode=print:\ngnome-web-print \"http://askubuntu.com\" askubuntu.pdf\n\nIt also supports creation of a small thumbnail image in PNG format. gnome-web-thumbnail is again a shortcut for gnome-web-photo --mode=thumbnail:\ngnome-web-print \"http://askubuntu.com\" askubuntu.pdf\n\nAdditional notes:\nDon't forget the http:// or https:// protocol! Otherwise the command may crash and you'd have to abort it using Ctrl+C.\nNote also that it also prints some normally irrelevant output, e.g. the Java version it uses... Just ignore that as long as there are no error messages...\n\nA: I use Awesome Screenshot add on in Firefox. You can get similar extension in chrome also.

Make sure to backup any data that you want to keep, as this will delete the whole drive. If Ubuntu is not the only operating system on the Laptop, choose the custom installation instead, delete the partition on which Ubuntu is currently installed (and possibly the swap partition) create (a) new partition(s) and install Lubuntu on them.\n", "Q: Network Printer over samba not working on lubuntu 15.10 The printer always returns with 'filter failed' error.

Whatever version I have tried seems to be broken/not working with HP LaserJet 1020.\nSolved the problem by installing 'foomatic-db' package using synaptic package manager. Don't install 'foomatic-filters'. Earlier I was installing both - since the error was filter failed.

Note: the requested width is determined from the sum of the column widths.\n\nSo you can specify the treeview height yourself, like this:\n    self.tree = ttk.Treeview(columns=lb_header, show=\"headings\", height=2)\n\nOr to match the number of items:\n    self.tree = ttk.Treeview(columns=lb_header, show=\"headings\", height=len(lb_list))\n\nAlthough I wouldn't recommend this as it will grow out of screen when a lot of items are added.\n", "Q: Setup Postfix using an external SMTP Server I am trying to set up postfix on Ubuntu 14.04 to use an external SMTP Server.\nI installed the libsasl2-modules to deal with authentication.\nI created my credentials file:\nsudo vim /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd\n\nusing:\n[mail.mydomain.com]:587 username:password\n\nCreated the hash db:\nsudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd\n\nUsed this settings in /etc/postfix/main.cf:\nsmtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name (Ubuntu)\nbiff = no\n\n# appending .domain is the MUA's job.\nappend_dot_mydomain = no\n\n# Uncomment the next line to generate \"delayed mail\" warnings\n#delay_warning_time = 4h\n\nreadme_directory = no\n\n# TLS parameters\nsmtpd_tls_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem\nsmtpd_tls_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key\nsmtpd_use_tls=yes\nsmtpd_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtpd_scache\nsmtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtp_scache\n\nsmtpd_relay_restrictions = permit_mynetworks permit_sasl_authenticated defer_unauth_destination\n#myhostname = web.mydomain.com\nmydomain = mydomain.com\nalias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases\nalias_database = hash:/etc/aliases\nmyorigin = /etc/mailname\nmydestination = www.mydomain.com, web.mydomain.com, localhost.mydomain.com, localhost\nrelayhost = [mail.mydomain.com]:587\nmynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128\nmailbox_size_limit = 0\nrecipient_delimiter = +\ninet_interfaces = all\ninet_protocols = all\n\n# enable SASL authentication \nsmtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes\n# disallow methods that allow anonymous authentication. \nsmtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous\n# where to find sasl_passwd\nsmtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd\n# Enable STARTTLS encryption \nsmtp_use_tls = yes\n# where to find CA certificates\nsmtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\n\nHowever, whenever I send a test mail authentication fails because postfix is not using my credentials at sasl_passwd but the current user instead.

With 20 old kernel images it will rebuild the initrds nearly 400 times!\nYou can work around that ridiculous rebuilding by disabling the initrd generation tool:\nsudo mv /etc/kernel/postinst.d/initramfs-tools /etc/kernel/postinst.d/initramfs-tools.real\nsudo ln -s /bin/true /etc/kernel/postinst.d/initramfs-tools\n\nThen issue sudo apt autoremove -f and when you're done...\nsudo rm /etc/kernel/postinst.d/initramfs-tools\nsudo mv /etc/kernel/postinst.d/initramfs-tools.real /etc/kernel/postinst.d/initramfs-tools\nsudo /etc/kernel/postinst.d/initramfs-tools $( uname -r )\n\nNOTE: If the running kernel isn't in /boot any more then you may need to supply the kernel version manually in place of uname -r\nAfter you're done, consider manually installing a specific kernel such as the current one, and then enabling apt-autoremove.  This will ensure you always have the chosen image to boot from, plus whatever the latest is.\n\nA: If your issue is because of lack of space, then you might have a way out. If you look closely, then you can see:\n Filesystem                Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n /dev/sda1                 236M  234M     0 100% /boot\n\nYou will see that the size of the partition is 236M, while used is 234M. System has reserved 2 MB for such emergencies. Free it up for your use by issuing the command:\n sudo tune2fs -m 0 /dev/sda1\n\nYou will have 2M of free space which might help you out of your situation.\nAnother way out will be to abandon that partition as boot entirely and use change the fstab (remove /boot ) and create a /boot on the root partition.\nCopy everything over from the (now) old boot to new boot and then complete the commands.\n", "Q: what is directory folder for aircrack-ng? I just uninstall aircrack-ng from my computer then install it again but now I want to know where can I put it , which folder I should put aircrack-ng in ? \n\nA: When you install from the official repositories it is installed in the places apt-get installs software. So all over the place and generally you do not get to pick the place where to install it. If the software has a 'user' component, that will be installed inside your /home/$USER/, either in a normal or hidden directory. \nIf you install from source you can to pick a diretory yourself, either by extracting the download or you get asked by the installer. The general rule is: install in /opt/. \nAnd a method would be to install in /opt/{software-name-with-version-number}/. That way you can install several versions next to each other. And you can then symlimk to /opt/{software}/ and put that inside your PATH or symlink a binairy inside a directory in your PATH to that executable. If you want to switch versions you switch the symlink to that version. \n", "Q: “unmet dependencies” while installing gtk +3 Trying to install GTK as it was required by a another package.\nSo I ran \napt-get install libgtk-3-dev\nBut getting unmet dependencies error.\nOutput\n  Reading package lists...

When the node enlists, MAAS will capture basic information about it, such as its MAC address, and it will become available for editing.

Thanks for your help!\n\nA: x240 and x250 no problem with 2 external monitors (keep in mind you do need the right docking station) and ubuntu 15.04, 15.10 and 16.04.\nI had problems with the set up for the x260. Even with a brand new docking station. Not sure if I had a Monday-machine or if the hardware was conflicting. I did not get it to work with ubuntu 15.10 and x260 and docking station and two external monitors. Even after replacing the mainboard of the laptop (I had a technician come by and replace the mainboard after seeing some weird Intel errors).\nHope this helps. Would love to hear people's experiences with this x260 set up and with ubuntu 16.04. \n", "Q: Is there any way to install slapd in ubuntu with auto-configured TLS?

I'm not talking about closing the terminal window itself which you can easily do by using the exit command. I'm talking about closing a tab that you have originally opened up by pressing the CtrlShiftT key combination. When I'm done working with it, I would like to close it down without lifting my hands up from the keyboard and going for the mouse to click that small X button. Is there a command for that?\n\n\nA: You already mentioned it, type exit and the tab (as well as the terminal session running within the tab) will be closed.\n\nA: When the shell process inside the terminal tab exits, it will close. If it was the only tab, the entire window will close. So you just have to quit the Bash session.\nYour Bash session quits...\n\n\n*\n\n*when you type the command exit.\n\n*when you press Ctrl+D to send an EOT (\"End Of Transmission\") code.\nNote that it must be pressed when the command prompt is empty, i.e. you haven't typed anything else on that line yet.\n\n\nPlease also note that you can nest multiple interactive shells. You can start a new shell inside the current one by running e.g. bash, sh, python, bc, ... The exit and Ctrl+D will always only terminate the currently active shell, which is usually the innermost one.\n\nA: From the GNOME Terminal help:\n\n\n*\n\n*Close Tab: ShiftCtrlW\n\n*Close Window: ShiftCtrlQ\n\nA: Like @YiboYang mentioned in comments, it is not possible to do Ctrl + W or exit in some cases:\n\nA keyboard shortcut could actually be useful if you're trying to close a tab with a frozen unresponsive ssh session.\n\nThat shorcut can be viewed/changed from the Menu bar, via File>Terminal>Preferences>Shortcuts\nGNOME terminal preferences\nIt is highlighted in the image above. Double-click on the Shortcut key and simple key-in a new combination to assign to it,\nE.g. I have set mine as Ctrl + W to be synchronous with the standard browser shortcut to close a tab.\n", "Q: How to regain sudo permission when grub menu is unavailable? I inadvertently failed to append myself to a group by using usermod -G group_name user_name instead of usermod -aG group_name user_name and now belong only to the group_name group.\nThe problem is: I can not bring up the grub2 menu with Left-Shift on boot, therefore I can not drop to root login and reinstate my sudo membership.\nIs there another way?\nTo be clear, I have not lost my password, I have inadvertently removed myself from the admin group.\n\nA: Following the advice given here I did the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from the installation stick (or disk)\n\n*In Unity bring up a terminal with ctrl+T.  If the boot sequence stalls for any reason (graphics in my case) switch to another tty.  I switched to tty2 with ctrl+alt+F2.\n\n*Mount your system root drive.  On my system this requires sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt\n\n*Gain access to the installed system by chrooting into it.  In my example I typed sudo chroot /mnt, because my system's root directory / is mounted there from the previous command.  You now have a bash session in your original installation with full privileges.\n\n*Enter usermod -aG sudo user_name\n\n*Reboot normally.\n\n*Rejoin all the default groups with \nsudo usermod -aG lpadmin,sambashare,adm,cdrom,dip,plugdev user_name\n\n", "Q: wine and java silent install I am creating a bash script for my home pc.

My problem with the scroll bars in lubuntu (15.10) is that they are set slightly away from the edge, so you have to be careful when placing your mouse on them, instead of just whooshing your mouse over and it stops when it hits the edge of the screen and then you're on the bar. Same with the tool bar at the bottom of the screen, set away from the edge by a pixel or two. Is there a setting which changes this? Or has someone written a script? Any help would be much appreciated.\nI'm all very new to Linux as a whole and I'm enjoying it a lot.\n\nA: I know this might not the answer you are looking for, but just chose a different desktop theme and that should took care of it.

I recommend you disable the Compatibility Support Module (CSM; aka \"legacy boot support\" or similar terms) in your firmware. Doing this will render some boot media unbootable. If you run into this problem, the solution is to fix the boot media. If you want to boot in EFI/UEFI mode, enabling the CSM is the worst thing you can do. For more on this subject, see my Web page about it.\nNote that in EFI mode you do not boot from a \"device\"; you boot from a boot loader file, which is stored on the FAT EFI System Partition (ESP) and referenced in an NVRAM boot manager entry. There is one sort-of kind-of exception to this rule: EFI supports a \"fallback\" boot filename, which is EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi for 64-bit (x86-64) systems. If no other boot entry is valid, or sometimes if there's an explicit entry for this loader, the system will boot it. This feature enables booting from OS installation media. It's also sometimes used to boot systems with badly broken EFIs that ignore or forget their NVRAM entries. This fallback entry may appear in the computer's built-in boot manager much like a traditional BIOS boot-from-device entry, but it's not quite the same thing.\n\nA: You seem to have the 32 bit Ubuntu edition installed.\nYou have to install the recommended 64 bit version.\nOtherwise the installation cannot work in EFI mode.  \nHowever ... to solve your problem ...\nBoot from Ubuntu installation media.\nSelect 'Try Ubuntu without installing'.\nOpen GParted from the dash.\nClick on Device in the top menu.\nClick on Create Partition Table.\nSelect gpt as you have EFI BIOS.\nCreate a new partition - format it with fat32 - size of about 100 MB.\nCreate a new partition - format it with ext4 - size fitting your needs.\nCreate a new partition - format it with swap - size matching the RAM.  \nOn the desktop click Install Ubuntu, when asked choose Something else.\nSelect the ext4 partition you had created with GParted for Ubuntu before.\nSelect / as mount point and ext4 file system as format, start the installation.\n", "Q: How to make command with included current working directory name, but not full path Since im making my forks called as folders im using them then for fast push wanted to make command \ngit commit -a && git push origin printf '%s\\n' \"${PWD##*/}\" && git fetch --all\n\nSomehow its not working.

The command evtest is used to log events. From the 2nd link: \n\nevtest is not installed by default in ubuntu installation. Instead you must install it by using apt-get.\n\nsudo apt-get install evtest \n\n\nevtest should be used outside of X. This is because the X-driver grabs the device when active. This means that the kernel delivers hw events to the driver itself and not to any other device opener (ie-evtest). This is why we should switch to a VT so that the X-driver ungrabs the device node allowing others to receive events. (Thanks to Mattia Dongili and Peter Hutterer for help on this, in an email)\nevtest needs to be able to read from the device; in most cases this means it must be run as root.\n\nFrom a terminal session ... \ncat /proc/bus/input/devices \n\nwill show the event your touchpad uses. Look for something like\n H: Handlers=mouse2 event8`. And then on a virtual console type\nsudo evtest /dev/input/eventX > ~/evtest\n\nand the file ~/evtest will contain all the events (do take care: it will get LARGE quickly).

The problem persists in 16.04\nIf I just open VLC with no file loaded, almost all shortcuts involving Ctrl do nothing. Ctrl+O should open the \"open file\" dialog, but nothing happens. The exception is Ctrl+Q which does work to close VLC.\nOddly, if I open a file then Ctrl-W starts working to close the file, but none of the other Ctrl shortcuts work.\nStranger still, after I've opened a file and then closed it, suddenly all the Ctrl shortcuts start working, but now the menus have changed color and no longer sit within the window title bar.\nWhat could be causing this strange behaviour, and how can I fix it?\n\n\n\nA: This behavior is caused by a notorious appmenu-qt5 bug. The bug report is here. It sets an environment variable for qt applications and this causes many applications menu item to be problematic in Unity. VLC is one of them.\nThe environment variable is QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME and is set in the file /etc/profile.d/appmenu-qt5.sh.\nWorkaround\nTo workaround this bug, You can unset this variable and start VLC then. From terminal you can use this command to start VLC without this bug.\nenv QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME='' vlc\n\nAs a permanent fix, first copy the vlc.desktop file to ~/.local/share/applicatons/\ncp /usr/share/applications/vlc.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/\n\nand then edit the line starting with EXEC to this line below\nExec=env QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME='' /usr/bin/vlc --started-from-file %U\n\nSave the file. Now if you start VLC, the shortcut will work from start.\nUpdate\nAs reported by Jonathan Y, it seems unsetting UBUNTU_MENUPROXY environment variable works too! So, you can use un-setting this variable in .desktop file.\nExec=env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY='' /usr/bin/vlc --started-from-file %U\n\n", "Q: Seamless integration of Windows software in Linux Before I describe what I am trying to do, I want to make clear that I have about 10 years of experience with Linux OS and Ubuntu and a lot of experience with VirtualBox. This is not for me but for a very stubborn friend...\nI want to have a link on the desktop to an application (specifically MS Office 2013 app) that is installed inside a VirtualBox. Once that Link is clicked I want to start MS Office (Word, Excel, Poverpoint) in a seamless mode. \nIt would be great if it were possible to automatically  open a *.docx file in a MS Office Word inside VirtualBox, by just double clicking on the file inside the host OS (Ubuntu).\nI know it is very specific and a lot of work for something useless, but I would appreciate if anyone could at least point me in some direction. \n\nA: A very rough outline of what I would do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Have a sender application in Ubuntu that you associate with all these filetypes. It receives the path to the file and then translates that into something the VM can understand (eg a samba share). \n\n*It sends this path to a daemon running on the VM. All this does is listens for connections from the sender and then opens the paths that it gets sent with the default application.\nAgain, this is all very high-level but it shouldn't be too hard to script out.\nThere are some good alternative ideas bubbling around in chat too.\nThe rest is built into VirtualBox (seamless mode).\n\nA: If the requirement of a full-emulated virtual machine is not hard, you can try with emulation through wine. If that fails, I do not know how it will work with Office 2013 (I use 2010 at my university), but I am really satisfied with Crossover. \nIt is not a free software (it is built over Wine and contribute back to it, but it is much more compatible with new softwares) --- so you could test first with wine (which is a FOSS solution) to see if it works. \nOnce installed, I have installed Office 2010 through it, and now it is seamlessly integrated in the desktop. Through the configuration interface you can choose, for example, to open .docx files with Miscrosoft Office and .doc with LibreOffice with ease. \nIt has some glitch sometime, and you need to choose click-to-focus to make it work, but it works well (at least, Word, Excel and Powerpoint). \n\nDisclaimer I have no relations with Codewavers and I do not receive money from them --- I am just a client. \n", "Q: Allow only a specific ip address to an open port I have a Zimbra server and the admin port, 7071, is open to the world. I had someone try to get into it yesterday and that locked the account.\nI was wondering if I can block all access to this port with the exception of a few ip addresses to allow me in.\ndeny all/allow ip range?\nIs that possible?\n\nA: You can use iptables for this\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 7071 -s 1.2.3.4 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 7071 -j DROP\n\n\nA: In my experience, ufw worked better than iptables.

And I really don't see how it could work (despite the positive feedbacks).\nI don't see how just defining our SSH key as a \"IdentityFile\" in the SSH config files would make it automatically add the SSH keys with passphrase. It would mean that when I do a ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa the system is storing the passphrase somewhere, but using it only if I add \"IdentityFile\" in the config. And for ssh key without passphrase it doesn't need any \"IdentityFile\".\nDoes someone knows how ssh-add work on this? How can the ssh-add behaviour can be so undeterministic?\n\nA: There is no way to add a key with passphrase permanently. The encrypted key is stored in the memory of ssh-agent, which is not persistent across the reboots.\nThe keys in default location or the keys mentioned in ~/.ssh/config (without passphrase) do not need to be added to the agent. The ssh will pick them up automatically.\n\nA: I figured out what was the problem.\nIt seems like it is gnome-keyring and seahorse that are adding it ti the ssh-agent\nAnd seahorse need the public key (.pub) to be in .ssh (next to the private one) in order to automatically add it \n", "Q: How many times will a cron job run when given asterisk (*) on all positions?

And, how do I control that? \nThanks.  \nUPDATE:  Well, after all the help of the nice folks below, and more searching around, I found a PARTIAL answer to my original question:  arandr.  If you run arandr, it very clearly allows you to specify which display is the primary.  However - this is why this is only a partial answer in my case - no matter which I selected via arandr to be the primary, the acting primary monitor stubbornly remains the leftmost monitor.  \n\nA: Settings --> Displays\n\nIf you want more advanced options\nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\n\nLets call it an Add-on which gives you more options than setup :).\n\nA: Sorry if I was unclear.

As such, there is no primary monitor, there are options which may make it look primary, but really, the difference is in what each monitor looks like.\n", "Q: OpenStack MAAS second hard disk recommendation? I am a newbie when it comes to OpenStack with MAAS and AutoPilot. I would like to create my own private cloud with Ubuntu 14.04LTS and MAAS 1.9. \nMy goal is to have a decent set up I can use to deploy a pretty heavy Java Spring Tomcat application with MySQL, Solr, RabitMQ along with MongoDB and/or Couch in the mix for a separate service I need to write. The application sifts thru quite a bit of data and stores the analysis results for graphing (real-time and offline). \nThis application (minus the Couch service) works on a single Ubuntu machine at this point with 32GB (no cloud) and a 3rd Gen i7 500GB SSD, 2TB secondary HDD. This is my QA / small scale performance test environment only. I am building a home-sand-cloud to deploy this app: \nI have 6 computers with the following settings:\n\n\n*\n\n*4Core Intel CPU with AMT technology.\n\n*8GB RAM\n\n*2 Gbit NICs\n\n*1x240GB SSD\n\n*1x1TB HDD\n\n\nI also have 2 x D-Link 8-Port EasySmart Gigabit Ethernet Switch (DGS-1100-08) as well. I was trying to follow Dimiter's blog, though he had the Network architecture in mind without the second HDD. \nNow my question is about the second disks. Would ceph/swift intelligently use the second disk for journalling or actual object storage. For my storage needs (less than 2 TB), would using HDD be a good idea as I cannot afford putting 1TB SSDs in these boxes. As the first disks are 240GB SSD in the boxes, would ceph/swift use the disks appropriately?\nLooking forward to seeing your responses as I don't want to go thru the headache of deploying my app to find out I need a different topology altogether. \n\nA: The Autopilot will consume all disks it can find on each storage node that are not in use. Typically, for example, you get Ubuntu installed on /dev/sda, and any other /dev/sdX will be used by Ceph or Swift. There is no preference for SDD vs HDD in Autopilot's mind yet.\nNow, MAAS 1.9 does support bcache, so you could speed things up a bit with that SSD of yours, but the 15.11 version of Autopilot does not yet know how to use that I'm afraid.\n\nA: Purely from a Ceph perspective, you would want to place the journal on the primary SSD drive, taking a small share of it, and use the 1TB HDD for the OSD daemon's use.\nAs Andreas' answer explains, Autopilot does not do this automagically yet, so you would need to build out the hyperconverged OpenStack and Ceph cluster manually.\nFor performance, again from a Ceph point of view, at least 10 OSD nodes would be recommended, but I would suggest you also take a look at Red Hat's reference architecture for Ceph and MySQL -- you should be able to get a rough idea of what performance you can achieve with MySQL on Ceph, especially as you can see what hardware was used to accomplish those numbers. \n", "Q: Hyper-V Ubuntu Connects to Network but not Internet I am running Hyper-V on Win 8.1.

I have Ubuntu installed on an external HDD (MBR Partition Table). The USB Live Disk was UEFI and although I instructed Ubuntu installer to install Grub in external HDD it managed to install Grub in internal one. For compatibility with older hardware I choose to use MBR on external HDD, but I accidently installed Ubuntu in UEFI. grub-install grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sdc does not work. It shows the following error:\ngrub-install: error: /usr/lib/grub/i386-pc/modinfo.sh doesn't exist. Please specify --target or --directory.\n\nA: Before going further, you should back up a bit. The key point for system compatibility is not the partition table type; it's the boot loader. Every computer has firmware that controls the boot process, and the boot loader must be able to work with that firmware. For x86 and x86-64 systems, the firmware is usually either the old-style BIOS or the newer EFI (or UEFI, which is just EFI 2.x). Either type of firmware can boot from either MBR or GPT disks, although BIOS systems usually employ MBR and EFI systems usually employ GPT.\nThe point of this is that you must assess whether the computers you want to boot use BIOSes, EFIs, or a mixture of both, and pick a suitable boot loader. It's possible to install both BIOS-mode and EFI-mode boot loaders, but this can be tricky, especially if you want to use GRUB for both modes. If you must support both boot modes, I recommend using GRUB for BIOS and something else for EFI, or vice-versa. This means you'll have to learn about alternatives to GRUB.\nGRUB is available for many different types of firmware, including both BIOS and EFI. An \"EFI-mode install\" of Ubuntu just means an Ubuntu installation that includes the EFI version of GRUB (or, in principle, some other EFI boot loader, but GRUB is the only one that the Ubuntu installation tools will set up automatically). Note that when you install GRUB in Ubuntu, this involves both setting up a bunch of scripts and copies of binaries in the Linux filesystem and copying relevant pieces to privileged locations on the disk (and, in the case of EFI, registering NVRAM entries). In other words, you cannot install a BIOS-mode GRUB using the EFI-mode GRUB package you have installed on your computer right now. To install a BIOS-mode GRUB, you must do one of a few things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the BIOS-mode GRUB package (grub-pc), which will also uninstall the EFI-mode package\n\n*Get the GRUB source code, or perhaps a binary build without actually installing a Debian package, and install it manually (a tricky process)\n\n*Install GRUB to the boot medium from a live disk.\n\n\nIn most cases, the Boot Repair tool can be used to install a different variety of GRUB than what's already there. The trick is to boot whatever disk you use to run Boot Repair in the desired boot mode -- if you boot in BIOS mode, Boot Repair will install BIOS-mode GRUB; and if you boot in EFI mode, it will install EFI-mode GRUB. There's also the complication that you want to install to a USB device; I'm not sure if Boot Repair will install GRUB to that disk or try to install to your internal disk.\nThere's another complication for EFI-mode boots of external disks: Instead of installing to a conventional OS-specific location (EFI/ubuntu, in the case of Ubuntu), the boot loader on removable disks should normally be installed to the fallback filename of EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. This may require manual copying of boot loader files.\n", "Q: Is Google support for Chrome in 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 really ending? like many others I've had a message when I open Chrome browser to say Chrome won't be supported much longer, with a link to the page telling you 32-bit linux Chrome support is ending, and you need 14.04+.  I have one machine running 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04. In the last couple of days it's successfully updated to chrome 49.  \nDo Google not realise 12.04 had a 64-bit version?  Or will updates eventually come to an end on this machine?\n\nA: Chrome is a 3rd party application. They have their own support cylcle and it is unfortunate it does not match Ubuntu's support cycle. Canonical is not responsible for this browser.\n\nDo Google not realise 12.04 had a 64-bit version? Or will updates eventually come to an end on this machine?\n\nYes, they do. The notice they made is not just about 32-bit but also about Ubuntu 12.04: \n\n\n*\n\n*Google Chrome is to drop support for all 32-bit Linux distros from March, 2016. \n\n*Google Chrome will also drop support for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (which will receive critical and security bug fixes from Canonical until mid 2017).\n\n\nIt is their choice to kill of the 32-bit version. Probably saved them money and resources so it might even be a logical step.\nSo if you want to use Chrome and use a version that has all the upgrades your options are to upgrade to 14.04, 15.10 or the upcomming 16.04. \nBy the way: the browser for Ubuntu is Chromium.

My plan is to install both Linux and Windows on the SSD as well as some games from Windows, and the rest of the data in the HDD.\nFrom my understading, the process is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Windows on SSD\n\n*Move the content of the User folder to the HDD\n\n*Make a partition in both the SSD and HDD for Linux\n\n*Install Linux in SSD with /home (and maybe /var) in HDD\n\n\nAnd my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is that process correct?\n\n*In order to put /home in the HDD, should I do it during the installation, or later with symbolic links?\n\n*Are /var or /tmp worth moving away from the SSD?\n\n*Windows programs usually install in a Program Files folder outside of the User folder. When installing a program, will I have to change directory to the HDD every time, or am I suposed to move the Program Files folder in the same way I move the contents of User?\n\n*40 GB seems to be enough for the Linux SSD partition. Is that right?\n\n*Can I place the swap partition in the HDD even if / is in the SSD?\n\n\nA: Your approach is right.\n\n\"In order to put /home in the HDD, should I do it during the\n  installation, or later with symbolic links?\"\n\nAt the time of install - choose something else for custom partitioning. It's not symbolic link but /home will be in it's own partition.\n\n\"Are /var or /tmp worth moving away from the SSD?\"\n\nDepends on your current and future needs but it's okay to do so.\n\n\"Windows programs usually install in a Program Files folder outside of\n  the User folder. When installing a program, will I have to change\n  directory to the HDD every time, or am I supposed to move the Program\n  Files folder in the same way I move the contents of User?\"\n\nIn Linux most of the programs are installed under /usr so you can create a separate partition for /usr also. A lot of folks install apps and programs under /opt. It's also a good candidate for it's own partition.\n\"40 GB seems to be enough for the Linux SSD partition. Is that right?\"\n\nIt's perfectly fine. Entire Linux can be installed in just 10 GB if\n  you want.\n\n\"Can I place the swap partition in the HDD even if / is in the SSD?\"\nYes you can. Swap is not used to a great extent unless you put your computer under hibernation or you are low on memory.\nNote : I will advise you to use gparted for partitioning and LVM for logical volumes as they give you a lot of flexibility. You can refer to my earlier question about LVM at here. It has a lot of pointers/references for other resources.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu with nouveau error This screen pops up when while trying to install Ubuntu.

The shells are used to interact with the system via commands. See What is the difference between Terminal, Console, Shell, and Command Line? and What is a shell?\n/bin/sh is a shell whose behaviour is expected to conform to the POSIX standard. It allows people to write scripts that can work across a variety of Unix-like systems without worrying about whether the system has ksh or bash or zsh or something else. Originally, /bin/sh was the Bourne Shell, but nowadays, practically no one provides the Bourne Shell as /bin/sh. Everyone symlinks /bin/sh to another shell, often /bin/bash on Linux systems. Debian and descendants (including Ubuntu) are the biggest exception - they symlink /bin/sh to /bin/dash.\nThere is no /bin/nbash, but perhaps you meant /bin/rbash. rbash runs bash with restrictions. Quoting the manual:\n\n[The] following are disallowed or not performed:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Changing directories with the cd builtin.\n  \n*Setting or unsetting the values of the SHELL, PATH, ENV, or BASH_ENV variables.\n  \n*Specifying command names containing slashes.\n  \n*Specifying a filename containing a slash as an argument to the . builtin command.\n  \n*Specifying a filename containing a slash as an argument to the -p option to the hash builtin command.\n  \n*Importing function definitions from the shell environment at startup.\n  \n*Parsing the value of SHELLOPTS from the shell environment at startup.\n  \n*Redirecting output using the ‘>’, ‘>|’, ‘<>’, ‘>&’, ‘&>’, and ‘>>’ redirection operators.\n  \n*Using the exec builtin to replace the shell with another command.\n  \n*Adding or deleting builtin commands with the -f and -d options to the enable builtin.\n  \n*Using the enable builtin command to enable disabled shell builtins.\n  \n*Specifying the -p option to the command builtin.\n  \n*Turning off restricted mode with ‘set +r’ or ‘set +o restricted’.\n  \n  \n  These restrictions are enforced after any startup files are read.\n\n", "Q: ClamAV only scans one directory.

I've recently decided to open-source all of my company's non-client-specific code, and changed all of my servers to Debian, and also installed Ubuntu on my main workstation. The company now uses 100% open source software on all of its machines. However, I will be forced to return to Windows if I can't resolve this issue, and I would really be bummed about that. \n\n\n*\n\n*What are the steps, in plain language for an Ubuntu novice, of diagnosing crashes on Ubuntu?\n\n*Once discovered, what resources can I use to fix these issues?\n\n*And finally, is there a chance that I will be forced to use proprietary software in order to correct these issues? \n\n\nThanks.\n\nA: Not enough technical details are provided here and only suggestions can be made.\nFirst you have to determine if its a Operating System issue due to installation/configuration errors or a Hardware failure due to faulty hardware.\nSoftware\nIn the first case you could check the System logs try:\n\n*\n\n*Check /var/log/ in terminal:\nsudo nano /var/log/syslog\n\n\n\n*If you are running GNOME, then you can check with a GUI all logs using \"gnome-system-log\" tool, type:\ngnome-system-log\n\nif it's not installed, type:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-system-log\n\n\n\n*Also try replicate the issue by booting in recovery mode, or try another OS environment or another installation, or ssh into the system to see if it happens. If it occurs its likely a hardware problem if not, look for clues in OS logs.\nHardware\nIf it's a hardware fault and after you have checked that the RAM, HDD, CPU temp are OK. I suggest you call a tech support, even better if you're still in warranty.\nReminds me a similar problem that I had once with lots of random crashing although the Ubuntu system seems to be randomly \"OK\" just to discover it was due to faulty RAM.\nIt seems like a Memory hardware issue here and memory problems can be hard to detect. If you haven't checked on them yet.\nOne way to diagnose this and check your RAM is with an application Memory Test. You usually find it on the boot menu from your Ubuntu LiveCD or any other live CD with a memtest application on it. Once the Boot menu appears you will see the option for Checking you Memory RAM choose: [Test Memory] or [MemTest86+].\nIf you do have a bad memory, you will get at least one RED row on the bottom half of the window application. Also I suggest to test each memory individually and to different slots if you don't find a memory error with both installed. This way you will definitely know if one memory is defective.\n\nA: I suspect your GPU is overheating.

If you are not in a hurry or you do not have too much time, I would just suggest that you wait for 16.04 which is due in April, and it will hopefully have PHP7 available.\nYou should, in the meanwhile, migrate from 12.04 to 14.04, so you are ready to update to 16.04 when it comes out. Direct migration from 12.04 to 16.04 will probably not be supported, as it has never been in the past.\nIf, on the other hand, you just want to try PHP7 now, you need to use Ondrej Sury's ppa. But I still believe that 12.04 is too old for that to work, and that you should upgrade first.\nLook for a guide about that, you will find plenty of resources.\nE.g. https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-upgrade-to-php-7-on-ubuntu-14-04\nHave fun.\n", "Q: Grub Rescue help! i am having issues loading my dualboot Windows 7 laptop.

I can have\nIntel Xeon E5-2620 v3 or Xeon E5-2620 v2 on my system. The difference is instruction sets these two CPUs implement. Will Ubuntu server installer detect this difference and choose correct target arch, or I need compile the kernel myself?\n\nA: \nThe difference is instruction sets these two CPUs implement.\n\nNo, the difference is in the extensions to the instruction set that they implement. Both implement the x86-64/amd64 IS, and the former has the AVX v2.0 extensions, whereas the latter has just AVX.\n\nWill Ubuntu server installer detect this difference and choose correct target arch?\n\nIt can detect the version. However, irrespective of the version, the architecture is still amd64. And it's up to you to download the amd64 images. As far as I can tell, there are no multiarch images. In practice, most pre-compiled distros don't bother about the version differences between CPUs - they all target the amd64 IS.\n\n[Do] I need [to] compile the kernel myself?\n\nYou can, if you need to, but I don't see the point of it unless you're looking to extract every last bit of performance from the CPU or something. Then it's up to you to ensure your kernel stays updated.\n", "Q: Is it possible to read the inputs from a text file for an application installation in Linux?

When this ends you will have an executable file script.exp which is an expect script (install the expect and tcl packages). You can run it at any time to repeat the command and have the same answers provided.  The file is easily edited in a text editor to slightly modify an answer.

I held the Kernel so while updating, the newer kernel version weren't marked for installation until yesterday. It is a security update so I know is recommended to do this update but the question is regarding Holding packages. Note: The Kernel has been on hold for some time now.\nWhat could have caused the package to get out of hold? If it was holding the update why did it came out of hold?\n\nThis time I held everything with a version number and with the word generic.\nlinux-generic set on hold.\nlinux-headers-4.4.0-21 set on hold.\nlinux-headers-4.4.0-21-generic set on hold.\nlinux-headers-generic set on hold.\nlinux-image-4.4.0-21-generic set on hold.\nlinux-image-extra-4.4.0-21-generic set on hold.\nlinux-image-generic set on hold.\nlinux-tools-4.4.0-21 set on hold.\nlinux-tools-4.4.0-21-generic set on hold.\n\n\nA: If you need to stick to a specific kernel package version, you'll need to hold all of these:\nlinux-generic\nlinux-image-generic\nlinux-headers-generic\nlinux-image-X.Y.Z-W-generic\nlinux-image-extra-X.Y.Z-W-generic \nlinux-headers-X.Y.Z-W-generic\n\nfor suitable X, Y, Z and W. Here, the actual versions of the packages would be like X.Y.Z-W.V (4.4.0-21.37, for example). Here, X.Y.Z is the upstream base kernel version, W is the ABI number, and V is the build number (see the Ubuntu Wiki).\nIf meta-packages aren't held and real ones are:\n\n\n*\n\n*if W gets bumped, the actual package names will change to the new version. The meta-packages will be upgraded, installing the new kernel, since this operation doesn't involve the existing linux-{image,image-extra,headers}-X.Y.Z-W-generic packages.\n\n*if V gets bumped and W doesn't, the package names remain the same, so the existing linux-{image,image-extra,headers}-X.Y.Z-W-generic prevent the upgrade due to being held. Consequently, the meta-packages aren't upgraded either.\n\n\nIf meta-packages are held and real ones aren't:\n\n\n*\n\n*if W gets bumped, no new kernel will be installed, since the metapackages' change in dependencies don't take effect due to being held.\n\n*if V gets bumped and W doesn't, new kernel packages will be installed, but they will be retain ABI compatibility to the old package.\n\n\nYou are holding the real packages and not the metapackages. In the last image, you can clearly see that W has increased from 21 to 22, and so the package names have changed, and the old holds no longer matter.\n", "Q: Trouble installing freeglut package Here are the outputs from running the respective commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get update results\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/15291163/\n\n*sudo apt-get install build-essential results\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/15291437/\n\n*$ sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev results:\npeace@peace:~$ sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev\nReading package lists...

When the process is complete you will have tails installed on a Flash drive\n", "Q: Suggest apps for opening .mdl & .spr files One app that can open .mdl files and another app that can open .spr file.\n\nA: .mdl is part of Matlab. There is no software in the repositories for Matlab except for a package offering support files for a better working Matlab on Debian systems. The Ubuntu help does offer instructions on how to install Matlab. There is no free software to open .mdl and you need to purchase a copy of Matlab. If this is something you need just for this 1 time you might be able to get away with a trial version. \n.spr You mean a Foxpro file?

Unluckily, when my teacher gave me a C++ code, I got a Segmentation Fault (core dump) when I ran it on my Ubuntu, but when I asked my friend to run it on his Elementary OS (32 bit) - another distro of Linux, the code worked really well. So I want to ask some questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible a program runs well on a 32-bit version, but cannot run on a 64-bit one (in my case, Core Dump)?\n\n*My computer is 64-bit machine, can I install a 32-bit version of Ubuntu?\n\n*Should I try Ubuntu 15 to see if it gets the same error (Core Dump)?\n\n\nA: The best bet is to probably learn how to debug your code using gdb.  Build your code with the -g flag (to enable debug symbols) and then run in side gdb, e.g.\ngdb ./nameofyourprogram\n\nwhen the segmentation fault occurs, type \"where\" and you will see where it crashes.  Learning to debug code is just as important as learning to code.  it may be also a good idea to get up to speed with the debugger using a online getting started guide.\n", "Q: how to run a .c file and what should be it's syntax I made a .c file and some random program that popped into my head.\nNow I'm trying to run it from the terminal.

The second line compiles the program if it does not use some strange libraries. The third line executes it. Change word program with the name you have given to the file.\n\nA: The gcc compiler comes with all Linux distro's. The syntax is \ngcc -o desiredName program.c\n\nAnd to run the program use\n./desiredName\n\nOf Course there are more options you should add. '-Wall' will print out all the warnings and errors when your try to compile it. Be sure to set up a standard as well. The C language used in the kernel is not standards compliant, it is a superset which includes GCC extension, which is why i would recommend gnu99 -std=gnu99. However, the C standard is C99 -std=c99 I also, personally set up an alias, so I don’t have to type this stuff out all the time. I recommend that you do the same.\nalias cc=\"gcc -Wall -std=gnu99 -o \"\n\nNow all you have to do is type \ncc desiredName program.c\n\n", "Q: E:The package picasa:i386 needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it Tired of getting this error again and again and it's blocking ubuntu software center from getting started it's just crashing when I try to open it.\nAnd getting this error at the time of installing and updating software center and any other application.\nIt's blocking the installation.\n\nA: apt is trying to reinstall or update the picasa:i386 package, but the system does not find the corresponding .deb file.

During the installation I gave Ubuntu much more space on the drive than required because I didn't know how much to give it- I think I gave it 88GB. I was asked to click on something that would allow my computer to boot from disk and agreed so that I wouldn't have to worry with going into the BIOS. Afterward, I was able to boot Ubuntu and was happy until I discovered that Windows Vista needed repair in order to boot. I did have the screen that asked which operating system to use. I repaired the Windows boot by going to a microsoft site that explained options to type into the command line. After repairing Windows boot, Ubuntu won't boot. Please advise!\n\nA: Are you sure that you had ubuntu installed and not pressed the ''try ubuntu'' with the disk as an image,right?\nYou could try re-installing ubuntu or, as I suggest you, replace Windows Vista with Windows 7 and move all the files you want to keep in the ubuntu partition, also now that I said that are you sure you created a partition first and not installed ubuntu on the same drive as Vista?\n", "Q: How to connect a MIDI Keyboard and automatically write notes?

I am new to ubuntu. Unfortunately, I removed my usb stick without using safely remove or other stuff. Now Ubuntu doesn't recognize my usb stick and Gnome Disk Utility is looked like this:\n\nI looked around for solution but I couldn't find any. \n\nA: In the following I assume that it is just a matter of the file system being corrupted by the unsafe removal - this would usually be the issue, but I cannot tell 100% for you case:\nUSB flash drives usually are vfat file systems. You can try to repair it with fsck, namely fsck.vfat as the version for vfat file systems.\nOpen a terminal an follow these steps (detailed as you said to be new to Ubuntu):\nFirst of all you need to identify its name in the /dev/ directory. For this unplug the drive, then just type in cd /dev (enter after each command is implied), then ls to list the directories entries. Note which sdxy (x=letter, y=digit) entries are listed. Plug in the device, type ls again and look for a new sdxy. If there is none you have severe problems, if there is, we can start repairing it.\nSecond. Say we found our device as /dev/sdb1, then run fsck.vfat -n /dev/sdb1 first. This is a dry run listing the errors only. Once you had read of these you can either repair it fully automatically fsck.vfat -a /dev/sdb1 or interactively with fsck.vfat -r /dev/sdb1\n\nA: If your system doesn't recognize your USB, it is damaged already.\nYou last chance is to see if you can see your device in the output of this command:\nlsusb\n\nYou must always 'safe remove' your pen-drive. If you cannot do it, go through these lines:\nLets assume your device is /dev/sdb1.

However using Ubuntu 14.04 the -c option does not exist in FFmpeg version SVN-r0.5.1-4:0.5.1-1ubuntu1.\nIs there a newer version? If so how can I get it. Using apt-get it says that this is the newest version.\n\nA: Unfortunately Ubuntu 14.04 does not have FFmpeg at all in the standard repositories, an issue that has been rectified in subsequent Ubuntu releases. If you are keen to use default 14.04 offerings you would be using avconv from libav-tools. Use the following:\nsudo apt-get install libav-tools libavcodec-extra-54\n\nAnd then to simply change containers from mov to mp4:\navconv -i input.mov -codec copy output.mp4\n\nIf you would prefer a modern version of FFmpeg that fits in well with Trusty Tahr 14.04 (and I would recommend this path) there are 2 good choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use Doug McMahon's great Trusty Multimedia PPA\n\n*Compile your own bleeding edge FFmpeg from FFmpeg trac instructions\nLots of good choices! For FFmpeg the command line is only slightly different:\nffmpeg -i input.mov -codec copy output.mp4\n\nAnd that should solve your issue...\nNote: In some cases it may be necessary to actually convert the audio and video codecs contained within the .mov container to fit better in the .mp4 container. Depends entirely on the makeup of the .mov file, in most cases -codec copy should suffice... \n\nA: For Ubuntu 16 (and higher?):\nffmpeg -i input.mov -vcodec h264 -acodec mp2 output.mp4\n\nI realize the question referred to Ubuntu 14. But since this is the top Google result I got when searching \"mov to mp4 ubuntu\", I figure it would be worth adding here.\nSource: https://mrcoles.com/convert-mov-mp4-ffmpeg/\n\nA: Under Ubuntu 16.04 I used kdenlive to convert Vitamania*.mov to Vitamania.mp4 (7Gb -> 0.5Gb) as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Project / Add clip\n\n*Drag the clip to the video 1 timeline\n\n*Project / Render\n(mp4, H264/ACC fast, video quality 20, audio quality 160)\n\n\nIt took 1.5 hours.\n", "Q: grub and grub2 seems to run sequentially at boot time Recently I have cloned my Ubuntu installation from one drive to another using clonezilla, parted magic.

First of all, see what locale files you have on your system:\ncd /\nlocate grub.mo\n\nMy output looks like this:\n/usr/share/locale-langpack/en_AU/LC_MESSAGES/grub.mo\n/usr/share/locale-langpack/en_CA/LC_MESSAGES/grub.mo\n/usr/share/locale-langpack/en_GB/LC_MESSAGES/grub.mo\n/usr/share/locale-langpack/ro/LC_MESSAGES/grub.mo\n\nBasically, get one of these files (the one you're interested in), compress it to gz and copy it to boot folder of GRUB.\nsudo cp /usr/share/locale-langpack/en_GB/LC_MESSAGES/grub.mo /boot/grub/locale/en.mo\n\nNow, according to this claim, GRUB looks first for mo files and if there is none, looks for gzipped one. So it should be enough to fix your problem. Yet to be completely sure, do:\ngzip /boot/grub/locale/en.mo \n\nAnd definitely you don't have both Grub and Grub2 installed. That is just an error message telling you that Grub is missing a localization file.\nMethod B\nTry reinstalling Grub from the running operating system.

Ok now then let me get to my issue, basically am stuck on grub rescue after a normal shut down in on windows on a dual boot system. Here's the events leading to this problem.  BTW am on windows 10.\nI have a 1TB HDD on a Toshiba C660, my HDD partitions were as follows all in numeric order according to minitool partition (and this is if I remember correctly): 1.Windows system reserve 100GB 2.Windows installation C:\\ 160GB 3.Backup F:\\ 600GB(made by me for storing data) 4.Unallocated space (140GB). This was primarily how my HDD was after I reset it with a complete clean leaving only 130GB of data in the Backup partition. I left the remaining 140GB unallocated because I was planning to install Ubuntu Linux the way I did alongside windows 8 previously, as it turned out windows 10 had an issue of not being detected by the live CD installation of ubuntu. So I searched the web for some fixes and I came across a guide that explained how to manually set up portions to install it alongside by making the \"/ 32Gb\" , /home 100Gb and \"swap 8Gb\" partitions all went well with the system going through grub on each startup, since I had the backup part I on in mind as a sort of portal to shared files for both systems I was punched in the face the face by the unmountable partition error which usually going through windows and shutting down fixed but this time it wasn't working, I even put the laptop on shutdown ,disconnected the charger and removed the battery for 10 minutes. Seeing as I couldn't use the backup partition as a shared one I had the problem of having no space for the data I wanted to have on the Linux side so I went back in windows and used minitool part I on to resize the backup drive leaving it at 380+GB and create a ext4 200Gb leaving an unallocated 15gb, the partition went successful and since the Linux portions weren't visible from windows I thought if maybe I did a shutdown once more and when I got to the Linux side it would allow me to see and copy the data I needed for once to the new partition. And lo and behold on startup I got a black screen with an error saying. \nError: file '/boot/grub/i386-pc/normal.mod' not found.\nEntering rescue mode...\ngrub rescue> \nAfter the making of Linux and creating of a second backup partition, the partition list was as follows (continuing from original layout). 4.Linux Backup 200Gb 5.Unallocated space 15Gb 6. / root 32Gb 7. /home 100Gb 8.Swap 8Gb. From when I only installed Ubuntu it was 123 and 678. The was another hidden partition on the windows side but it was hidden and I don't remember were it was between the other partitions.\n\nA: You can try reinstalling grub to the hard disk from the Ubuntu Live CD.  That should at least get your Linux working.

I need is as  it is a  pre-requisite to  ScaPy, however the Python 3.x wrapper does not seem to exist yet.\n\nA: You say you only need libdnet to use ScaPy.\nBut this is a false assumption.

I have two users, my girlfriend and I, and an HDD that usually remains connected. It's not always connected, so I don't want to add it to fstab. \nThe drive mounts for whoever is logged in first when the system starts up, or whoever is active when it is connected. When I switch users, the second user cannot access the drive. \nI installed Users and Groups from gnome-system-tools (Why this was removed, I'll never understand) and set both users to each others groups. The Andrew group has both Andrew and Hannah as users, and the Hannah group has both Andrew and Hannah as users. If I look at the directory permissions, it shows Me/Create and delete files, andrew (group)/none, others/none. I cannot change the group access. It just reverts back to none immediately. \nI tried to sudo chmod -R 777 /media and it still doesn't modify access to the drive. \nI've run out of ideas and any assistance would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: If the disk is formatted as EXT4 you can use the \"groups\" to set the disk to a group both users belong too. Permissions on a Linux system are normally set to 755 for folders and 644 for files. But you can change that to 775 and 664, and set a group and then add both users to the group. Both will then be able to execute the disk, store and remove files. Basically all you would want.\nIf the disk is formatted as NTFS you need to provide user and group during the mounting of the disk. You have the dmask (directory), fmask (file) and umask (user) options for that. To set the owner, use the uid and gid. Similar to EXT you set the GID and add both users to the GID. \n\"chmod\" and \"chown\" do not work when the disk is mounted. It is a foreign file system that does not support these.\nBy the way: it is best to add it to /etc/fstab. That the disk is not always present should not be a problem. \nGeneric example:\n{uuid}  /mnt/{directory}  ntfs-3g   noauto gid=users,umask=0002    0       0\n\nwhere \"users\" is your group and \"umask\" is the reverse of chmod (0002= 775 allowing for execute by group). A lot of information can be found om the NTFS-3G page made by the cool dudes using Arch. There is also the official NTFS-3G manual. The \"noauto\" prevents auto mounting.\nIf you want to manual mount:\nmount -t ntfs-3g /dev/your_NTFS_partition /mount/point\n\nor\nntfs-3g /dev/your_NTFS_partition /mount/point\n\nIt will then pick up the options set in /etc/fstab\n\nA: In the menu, go to System > Users and Groups, and there, select the user, click on \"advanced settings\" button, and in the \"User Privileges\" tab, mark the option \"Access External Storage Devices Automatically\". It should do the job.\n", "Q: Notebook doesn`t turn on So, my brother gave me his old notebook since he got a new one.

Why can't I use the left and right arrow keys (actually, the same goes for the up and down keys as well) to move about the line I'm currently on in the tclsh interactive shell? If I try to press either one, I get a bunch of abracadabra instead of moving back and forth. This is not all that convenient when, for example, you make a typo, but you can't move the cursor back to change it. You have to use the backspace key to erase all the stuff that you've typed after the place where the typo is located thereby destroying all your work. Is it possible to fix this, quite frankly, buggy behaviour?\n\n\nA: This functionality appears to be provided by the tcl-tclreadline package. From apt-cache show tcl-tclreadline:\n\nDescription-en_CA: GNU Readline Extension for Tcl/Tk\n tclreadline adds GNU Readline support to standard Tcl/Tk.

In Ubuntu 15.10, how can I replace the toolbar on the left side with a normal menu like in Ubuntu 12.04?\nI don't know how this became \"hip,\" but I hate it filling my screen with that stuff. It is not structured, only icons, unless you move over it with the mouse, and you can only place the most important tools — if there are few enough.\nI looked through all the options, but I couldn't find out how to \"repair\" this.\n\nA: You can't in Ubuntu. The launcher is a integral part of the Unity experience and Ubuntu. In the new 16.04 you will be able to place the launcher elsewhere. But the launcher will still be there. By the way: this method was chosen because it looks the best on ALL Ubuntu devices: from 4:3, 16:10 notebooks through to phones and is part of the Ubuntu path to convergence.\nIf you want another desktop experience you will need to install another desktop.

You will need to turn off auto-login. If you are satisfied with this desktop you can remove the old Ubuntu desktop with ...\nsudo apt-get purge ubuntu-desktop\n\nThe same is applicable for any other desktop.

But I would try to avoid it, it is likely software will conflict, and/or when removing it might leave traces, make the system unstable.\nIf testing is the goal (to decide what to go for): use a virtual box and install your operating system in there.\n\nHere is how the login works (from linuxpitstop, theswitchtolinux has also got a good blogpost on it) :\n\n\nIn general it is best to re-install and stick to one desktop. That will remove all traces of the old desktop. Every desktop also comes with a different set of pre-installed software. Not all of them have \"gedit\" as an editor, not all will have Nautilus as file manager or Firefox as default browser.

I have moved my /home folder to a separate partition of my Ubuntu 15.10 because of space issues.\nThat has freed up enough space that I'd like to sync my Dropbox folder, but I can't fit it in home. I have ample space in the [not sure what to call this] installation partition (the root filesystem?). \nIs there a persistent and private folder there that I could use to create a \"data\" folder?\ncheers.\n\nA: To put your files in a /home is just a convention. You can store your files wherever you want. If you want to use some space in root make a directory there and set the permissions that match the permissions of your other files in your home directory. You can even make a symbolic link to your home directory. For instance:\nsudo mkdir /mydata\nsudo chown myusername:myusername /mydata\nln -s /mydata ~/mydata\n\nPut whatever you want in that folder. You will have a folder mydata in your home directory which will point to the mydata folder in the root. Change the name mydata to whatever you like. In the last command ln you don't need to use the same name twice. You can also do it like this\nln -s /mydata ~/linktomydata\n\nThe ~ represents your home directory. So you can also write\nln -s /mydata /home/<username>/linktomydata\n\nwhere you put your username instead of <username>.\n", "Q: Error while installing ubuntu 14.04.

The application displays a \"Create partition table on /path-to-device\" dialog.\nOptionally, select a different partition table type from the list.\nMany operating systems recognize gpt and msdos partition tables, but do not recognize all types of file systems. This lack of file system recognition means that using a disk without a partition table involves more risk. For example, some operating systems might prompt to format an unpartitioned disk if the file system is not recognized.\nYou might have overwritten, maybe you can attempt data rescue if needed.   \n", "Q: Prevent web apps from using browser?

Thank's\n\nA: Support of Toshiba Broadcom based bluetooth devices has been recently added to Ubuntu 4.2 kernel.\nTo get it work on your system you need to upgrade the kernel by running\nsudo apt-get install linux-generic-lts-wily\n\nif you do not have 4.2 kernel already.\nYou may have errors with compiling of bcmwl-kernel-source. In this case install an updated version of this driver by\nwget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/restricted/b/bcmwl/bcmwl-kernel-source_6.30.223.248+bdcom-0ubuntu7_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i bcmwl-kernel-source_6.30.223.248+bdcom-0ubuntu7_amd64.deb\n\nThen reboot. This way you will keep your Wi-Fi working.\nAfter that you will need to install Broadcom firmware according to this manual.\nYour bluetooth device is\n0930:0225 Toshiba Corp.\n\nP.S. For kernels 3.19 the patch has been committed too. The kernel image is in the proposed repository and soon will get into the main repositories.  \n", "Q: Terminal: Change the color of my hostname and username When using the terminal, I want both my username and my hostname to have separate color schemes.\nIs that possible with Ubuntu's default terminal emulator(if not, is it possible in terminator?)?\n\nA: You could wrap \\h in, e.g., \\[\\033[01;31m\\] and \\[\\033[00m\\] in ~/.bashrc's $PS1 definition to make the host red; \\[\\033[00m\\], which resets all the attributes, is already there in the default prompt, so you won't really need it, and I suggest commenting out $PS1's definition and adding a line right after rather than editing the current $PS1's definition for an easy rollback:\nif [ \"$color_prompt\" = yes ]; then\n    #PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u@\\h\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\w\\[\\033[00m\\]\\$ '\n    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u@\\[\\033[01;31m\\]\\h\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\w\\[\\033[00m\\]\\$ '\nelse\n    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\u@\\h:\\w\\$ '\nfi\n\nThis should work out-of-the-box on e.g. gnome-terminal; on xterm (and I'd guess in general on xterm-based terminals), you'll also have to uncomment this line:\n#force_color_prompt=yes\n\nYou can check out other available colors e.g. here.\n", "Q: Itunes 64bits on Ubuntu 14.04 How do I install itunes 64bits on Ubuntu 14.04 ? Using PlayOnLinux couldn't help me out to install the 64bit version of the latest itunes.\n\nA: Sadly the last version of iTunes that works trough Wine is the latest compatible with Windows XP which was 32bit. It can still be downloaded from the official Apple site at https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1614\nIt can be installed, music and video playback works well, and you can access the store too, however purchasing non free items and iOS sync does not work.\nThere is more information regarding installation and operation at WineHQ web site: https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=31322&iTestingId=91429\n", "Q: How to get disassemble command line?

No use in disassembling it. To verify that a file actually is a program, use the file command:\n$ file test.c\ntest.c: ASCII text\n$ file /bin/bash\n/bin/bash: ELF 64-bit LSB  executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked\n(uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24,\nBuildID[sha1]=54967822da027467f21e65a1eac7576dec7dd821, stripped\n\nAs for disassembling, use objdump instead. From the manpage:\nNAME\n       objdump - display information from object files.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       objdump [...]\n               [-d|--disassemble]\n\nSo to disassemble, let's say, a file called a.out, use\n$ objdump -d a.out \n\na.out:     file format elf64-x86-64\n\n\nDisassembly of section .init:\n\n00000000004003a8 <_init>:\n  4003a8:   48 83 ec 08             sub    $0x8,%rsp\n  4003ac:   48 8b 05 45 0c 20 00    mov    0x200c45(%rip),%rax        # 600ff8 <_DYNAMIC+0x1d0>\n  4003b3:   48 85 c0                test   %rax,%rax\n  4003b6:   74 05                   je     4003bd <_init+0x15>\n  4003b8:   e8 33 00 00 00          callq  4003f0 <__gmon_start__@plt>\n  4003bd:   48 83 c4 08             add    $0x8,%rsp\n  4003c1:   c3                      retq   \n[...] and so on...\n\n\nA: I think what you want is a function of gdb, the gnu debugger, which has a disassemble command. First, you would compile test.c with debugging flags on, like this:\ngcc -Wall -g -o test test.c\nor something along those lines. Then, you would run the application with gdb as an argument:\ngdb test\nonce you are in gdb, you can use the disassemble command like this: \n(gdb) break main\n(gdb) disassemble main\n\nTake this trivial  program named test.cpp:\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\nint main ()\n{\n    int a=0;\n    for (int b = 0; b < 11; b++){\n        a=b+2;\n        cout << a << \"\\n\\t\";\n    }\ncout << \"Hello World \\n\";     \nreturn 0;\n}\n\nnow I will compile it, with debug flags:\ng++ -Wall -g test.cpp -o test\n\nThen you say, but j0h, this is a C question... to which I say, gdb doesn't care what language you use. you can debug and disassemble c, c++, assembly, fortran, and a variety of other things, just compile with the -g option, thats what is important. \nonce we load the program into gdb, and break main, we cam run disassemble:\nBreakpoint 1 at 0x4007da\n(gdb) disassemble main\nDump of assembler code for function main:\n   0x00000000004007d6 <+0>: push   %rbp\n   0x00000000004007d7 <+1>: mov    %rsp,%rbp\n   0x00000000004007da <+4>: sub    $0x10,%rsp\n   0x00000000004007de <+8>: movl   $0x0,-0x4(%rbp)\n   0x00000000004007e5 <+15>:    movl   $0x0,-0x8(%rbp)\n   0x00000000004007ec <+22>:    jmp    0x400817 <main+65>\n   0x00000000004007ee <+24>:    mov    -0x8(%rbp),%eax\n   0x00000000004007f1 <+27>:    add    $0x2,%eax\n   0x00000000004007f4 <+30>:    mov    %eax,-0x4(%rbp)\n   0x00000000004007f7 <+33>:    mov    -0x4(%rbp),%eax\n   0x00000000004007fa <+36>:    mov    %eax,%esi\n   0x00000000004007fc <+38>:    mov    $0x601080,%edi\n   0x0000000000400801 <+43>:    callq  0x400670 <_ZNSolsEi@plt>\n   0x0000000000400806 <+48>:    mov    $0x400914,%esi\n   0x000000000040080b <+53>:    mov    %rax,%rdi\n---Type <return> to continue, or q <return> to quit---\n\nHere is a tutorial:\nhttp://www.unknownroad.com/rtfm/gdbtut/gdbadvanced.html\nobjdump can list the contents, but I don’t think you’ll be able to interact with your code the same way as if you use the debugger. \n", "Q: How to make a Linux Application I am a new Programmer (Java, JavaScript and C).\nI would like in the future to do / participate doing Ubuntu applications.\nMy question is; what programming language should I learn to become an Ubuntu programmer?\n\nA: As you already know JavaScript (and HTML I assume) you might like \"Crosswalk\" by Intel.\nThis is an open source project that will package your HTML as an Android, Windows, iOS or Linux (DEB) application.\nSee the Linux documentation here.\n\nA: I would recommend a book by Jon Masters and Richard Blum Professional Linux Programming. \n\n\n*\n\n*This book is broken into four primary sections addressing key topics that Linux programmers need to master: Linux nuts and bolts, the Linux kernel, the Linux desktop, and Linux for the Web\n\n*Effective examples help get readers up to speed with building software on a Linux-based system while using the tools and utilities that contribute to streamlining the software development process\n\n*Discusses using emulation and virtualization technologies for kernel development and application testing\n\n*Includes useful insights aimed at helping readers understand how their applications code fits in with the rest of the software stack\n\n*Examines cross-compilation, dynamic device insertion and removal, key Linux projects (such as Project Utopia), and the internationalization capabilities present in the GNOME desktop\n", "Q: Linux Plymouth splash screen works only recovery mode We have a Jetway motherboard (embedded PC), and we've installed a minimal ubuntu 14.04 on it.

Going by @kos's answer, they probably match the empty regular expression.\n\nA: Notice that echo \"hello\" | grep -E  '*' returns hello because the string is a match and grep returns the whole line, not because * is the same as .*. You should test with -Eo:\n% echo \"hello\" | grep -Eo '*' \n% \n\nI don't have sources to backup this, but a not too wild guess based on a pratical test suggests that a sequence of quantifiers at the beginning of the regex is just ignored:\n% echo \"*hello\" | grep -Eo '*'    \n% echo \"+hello\" | grep -Eo '+'\n% echo \"?hello\" | grep -Eo '?'\n% echo \"{1}hello\" | grep -Eo '{1}'\n1}\n% echo \"***hello\" | grep -Eo '***' \n% echo \"*+?{1}hello\" | grep -Eo '*+?{1}hello'\n1}hello\n\nMy prompt prepends the return value at the start of the line in case of a return value different from 0, so those are all matches.\n\nA: The grep -E  'regex' show lines containing the matching regex and highlights the matches in red color.\ntaking this into consideration, grep -E  '*' will show all the lines with zero or more '(nothing)' in it.\ngrep '*' will just show lines having the star in it.\n", "Q: Juju: how to get a config option value?

I tried sudo apt-get install cPickle and python3.4-cPickle but it doesn't work.\n\nA: There is no cPickle in python 3:\n\nA common pattern in Python 2.x is to have one version of a module implemented in pure Python, with an optional accelerated version implemented as a C extension; for example, pickle and cPickle. This places the burden of importing the accelerated version and falling back on the pure Python version on each user of these modules. In Python 3.0, the accelerated versions are considered implementation details of the pure Python versions. Users should always import the standard version, which attempts to import the accelerated version and falls back to the pure Python version. The pickle / cPickle pair received this treatment.\n\n-Source. \n\nA: From the pickle  module documentation:\n\nThe pickle module has an transparent optimizer (_pickle) written in C. It is used whenever available. Otherwise the pure Python implementation is used.\n\nIn python3 use:\nimport _pickle as cPickle\n\n", "Q: ImportError: Gtk* backend requires pygtk to be installed (python3.4)? l stuck with  this error\nplease help\n File \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/matplotlib/backends/backend_gtk.py\", line 16, in <module>\n    raise ImportError(\"Gtk* backend requires pygtk to be installed.\")\nImportError: Gtk* backend requires pygtk to be installed\n\n\nA: I could solve this issue by changing the backend to TkAgg.

I am using this video to test whether vsync is working correctly or not.\nHow do I get vsync working alongside the scale option using xrandr? I cannot seem to find any obvious fix from reading the manual.\n\nA: This issue has been bugging me too since I've bought a high DPI tablet PC. Luckily, if your screen is connected to Intel's GPU, there is a solution.\nXrandr's scaling is done by rendering X11 screen contents onto a Xrender picture, then scaling it and displaying on real screen. That said, Xrandr doesn't really decide how the output is scaled and displayed, everything depends on Xrender implementation of used DDX driver. These always have been quirky and hackish, resulting in synchronization and performance problems.\nIntel's DDX provides a non-standard option, called TearFree, that forces synchronization between Xrender pixmaps and screen (and also introduces some performance issues, that's why it's not enabled by default). You can enable it by creating *.conf file in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ containing:\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier \"Intel Graphics\"\n    Driver \"intel\"\n\n    Option \"AccelMethod\" \"sna\"\n    Option \"TearFree\" \"true\"\nEndSection\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 14.04: Problems with nivida driver for Geforce GTX 965M Sorry for my bad English.

And ubuntu is not responding to the event either.\nWhat did I miss?\nDo I need to create a slave device for it and attach it in xinput?\n\nA: According to this, BTN_LEFT and BTN_RIGHT must be set or xinput would not accept uinput virtual device as pointer slave.\nAfter doing:\nret = ioctl(uinputFD, UI_SET_KEYBIT, BTN_LEFT);\nret = ioctl(uinputFD, UI_SET_KEYBIT, BTN_RIGHT);\n\nthe virtual device shows up in xinput and functions well.\nSo even if the virtual device only implements a subset of the function of a mouse, like only two wheel in my case, BTN_LEFT and BTN_RIGHT flags still need to be set.\n", "Q: Dual booting win 10/ Ubuntu 15.10 So, I have made a USB drive with 15.10 version of Ubuntu using this guide. Now when I try to restart the computer with the USB stick in there but the computer doesn't start, when I take USB out, it boots up to win 10. \nSo what am I doing wrong ?\n\nA: In Windows 10 go to the start button which looks like this \n\nand then while clicking on the Shutdown(Restart) also press SHIFT key then follow the on screen instructions to boot via UEFI USB device. Now at the restart the computer will boot from the USB stick.\n\nA: At boot (before windows starts) press F1, enter bios.\nFind Secure Boot and disable it.\nChange boot order to USBkey on the top. (Or press F12 at boot)\nIf the problem persists , change boot order to Lagacy First, then UEFI.\n", "Q: Installing mysql server with postgresql I'm using backbox 4.4 which it was built-in with postgresql. Yesterday i think about \"can i installing mysql database along side postgresql database ? \", i want to learn database connection but i so unfamiliar with postgresql, what i want to ask is :\n\n\n*\n\n*Can postgresql and mysql run together in the same machine ?\n\n*If it can't, why so?\n\n*If it can, can you tell me how to configure mysql database to run with postgresql ? Or give me some reference.\n\n\nThanks.\n\nA: \nCan postgresql and mysql run together in the same machine ?\n\nyes.\n\nIf it can, can you tell me how to configure mysql database to run with postgresql ? Or give me some reference.\n\nEhm. There is no conflict between the 2 so you install mysql the normal way (sudo apt-get install mysql-server) , you install postgres (sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib) the normal way. And then you basically create a user, set permissions and create a database. Using some kind of software to create a DBI connector and of you go.\nThe 2 run on different ports so there is nothing to hinder each other. The only thing: both will try to use the most out of your machine and compete for I/O, network access and memory so one of them is likely to slow down significantly if the other is doing something heavy.\n", "Q: How to make the Terminal make a noise on command completion? Let's say I run a command which takes a long time to do its stuff, but I don't want or need to look at it the whole time, and as I need to do some other stuff as well I might get into that and forget to check on how the command is doing for some time... Then when I finally do check I may find that the command finished 3 hours ago and needed my attention then... Or perhaps it didn't need my attention, if I had seen that it had finished at the time I would have had more time to run more commands...\nSo I was wondering if there is a way to get it so that when a command or program has been run, whenever it finishes and returns to $, for it to make a little sound, like play an mp3 file or something? Though it would be acceptable just to get this working in gnome-terminal, I would like it in as many CLI environments as possible including the TTYs if that would be possible... I am running Ubuntu GNOME 15.10 with GNOME 3.18.\n\nA: First, run the following commands to enable pcspkr and to install beep:\nsudo sed -i 's/blacklist pcspkr/#blacklist pcspkr/g' /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\nsudo modprobe pcspkr\nsudo apt-get install beep\n\nNow, run a command along with beep like so:\nsudo apt-get update; beep\n\nor\nsudo apt-get update; beep;beep;beep;beep;beep\n\nFinally, to control the volume of beep, change the beep volume from alsamixer by running the following command:\nalsamixer\n\nNow, use your right arrow key to scroll to the automute option. Use the up arrow to toggle this off.\nThen use the left arrow key to scroll to beep and use the up or down arrow key to raise or lower the volume of beep. \nUse the M key to mute or un-mute any channel.\nPress ESC to exit alsamixer\nMany more options for beep can be found at:\nman beep\n\n\nEDIT\nNow, to get the terminal to beep after each command is run, run the following command:\ncp .bashrc .bashbackup\necho 'PROMPT_COMMAND=\"beep\"' | tee -a .bashrc\n. .bashrc\n\n"]
